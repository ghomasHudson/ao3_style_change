The last spell cast was an
“Stay.”
“I keep feeling like I’m pushing too much.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“There are pillows,” he grunted, pretending to be more interested in his arm than the resonating thought he was - had - slept in Harry’s bed for the night.
“I’m not used to everyone just jumping to conclusions like that. Aurors have training to make sure you don’t.”
“Wake up.”
“I would’ve bet Granger in Potions if I could’ve sat my O.W.L.S. Fool,” Draco sniffed.
“Too soft,” Harry slurred and fell back into a slumber Draco wasn’t going to wake him from. That was a little bit of a relief and allowed Draco some time to sort out his own thoughts before Harry interrogated him.
Draco fought against going back into the darkness. Lethargic and unfocussed, Draco stared at Blaise, who stayed unmoving on the floor.
Trainee scoffs, gives him the same look the boy did. Harry doesn’t know what Draco knows. Still doesn’t. Not until the memory shifts and Harry’s crying, Ginny’s nearly knocking down the door to ask what’s wrong. For him to come out and talk to her.
She worked in silence, only the occasional hoot from the owl to break it. He hadn’t been nice to Potter, even if his magic had flared and shattered a window of a nearby shop. His face had spoke volumes, how horrified and sickening it all was. Potter should have cured his magic problems. They were still there even as Potter panicked, Luna trying to soothe him, Draco had reverted back.
No one waited in their seats to greet him, although from the look of the kind of seating they had here – Draco didn’t blame anyone he knew from forgoing sitting on those abominations. His side ached a little, nothing like what it was and Draco wondered just what dosage he was on for pain.
Nothing new or exciting: Draco still could not summon a Patronus.
“Similar likes like, Malfoy.” Not many of the Weasleys were as forgiving as the others.
Instead of being flustered, Hermione relaxed at the interruption. “Since Blaise and Theodore are-- have a warrant for their arrest, we didn’t want you to be sitting on your own for too long.”
“You’re as bad as him. Write something up, both of you. Then, Harry, you will explain how this all connects, get a move on I want a report from you by tonight.” Hermione didn’t take no as an answer and on one of the numerous mahogany tables set some parchment down, the ink and quill charmed and rushing over at her beckoning.
“Fuck, if I apparate they’ll swarm you. And you--” Draco closed his eyes for a second, wanting the mist in the room to dissipate a bit. His eyes stung terribly and Blaise slapped him. “You stay awake you absolute wanker.”
“What do you remember about the attack?”
“Look,” Draco scratched his head, not sure where to start. “I’m going to say a bunch of things and they might be accurate, they might not. But it really is impossible for a human’s magic to do this to a Casting Tree, this takes more - mythical creature means. Or near an enchanted spring, or cultivated over centuries of numerous different families. One person just doesn’t take a Casting Tree seed and make a bloody All-Mother.”
Unexpectedly, Harry brightened, leaned forward. Pleased. “Owl?”
“Uhuh.”
What was he supposed to do? Pray his friend had only – what – been under the same kind of torture? Or face that he had betrayed him and had taken the cowardly way out? Only as his arm was yanked did Draco see Harry at his side, pulling him up and Draco’s legs were like a newborn deer. “Sit.” Draco sat. A cold sweat across his brow. He'd curse the two of them if he saw them. He'd never been so- so--
Blindsided and reacting out of anger Draco was not.
Someone had impersonated Siobhan Goven, saved Harry Potter taken Draco Malfoy’s money, lived in his house. Draco tweeted at the gall of this woman. If he wasn’t so furious he might manage impressed. For now, he needed to know how much of a threat she truly was.
APPEARANCE
Also noticed some weird formatting stuff (like double periods and the spaces between italicised words), will have to go back and tweak that at some point.
Draco shook his hand, the tingling magic not yet dissipated. He ignored the triumphant idiot and the whispers he could totally snog Harry out here, with the Muggles who didn’t know who they were, who would never see them again. Draco kept his eyes on the exit.
Draco made a noise. No, no he wasn't. Just having some rodent issues. Draco devolved into laughter at his joke.
Got a charger delivered yesterday so, update schedule fine. (Phew!).
Harry dropped him into the bath. Water barely reached over his feet and Draco tried to look at his reflection in the water. He stretched his wings out, the left twinging and he tried to lower it. The pain flared again and blood, a scorned pink bled into the clear water only to stop a moment later. He must have stained his undercoat. Whether it was from the attack a few days ago or the activation, Draco was glad to clean away the blood. His blood. Another loss for him in his plan - he had thought to escape unharmed and superior. Nipping at the feathers around it, Draco was glad to see it was scabbed and dark. Not bloated with pus or an itchy red.
– he eyed Blaise and with as much force as Draco could manage, migraine not easing, he sent a few of his own to deter them. It was the sludge’s fault. As each bolt and wisp, each Dark spell fired, the air turned smoky and thick. Draco thought himself safe, if only because whoever was at the top of the stairs had a shit aim.
“I’d like you to close your eyes.” Luna stood waiting and Rolf pulled out a quill and parchment. Right. If people ever said Snape watched them as if they were curious, dumb little creatures well, he suddenly felt that way too.
It was weird noticing the damage, the ruin on his clothing when he wasn’t sure where or when it came from. Was the pain in his arm from jumping between locations too fast, or was his cut arm from glass? When? Draco hadn’t considered himself capable of hyper fixating on something, not like Nott does. He liked to multi-task, do several things in tandem for the most efficient time spent.
The majority of the birds were sleeping as they arrived to the Owlery, the windows open and the air billowing the delicate strands around Decimus’ ears.
Like what? Whether this was a Muggle-thing or simply because Draco was too tired for mental gymnastics, he didn’t really care for another apology.
That was a joke. An unfunny joke. Pushing himself up to follow, Draco didn’t believe it. Until he saw it, Harry shoved them into the sink. He actually saw it. With his eyes. Water sloshed about as the plates slid under the bubbles.
“I don’t want your apologises, Harry.”
He was going to die unless he saved himself. Unlike before, he had no blood in his lungs to frighten him. Tying up the cloak again, Draco tried to think through the heaviness.
“Unless he’d like a heart attack, he’ll get one.” Siobhan offered the two up, one yellow and sparkling the other a soft lilac. Harry didn’t say anything and Draco had a moment, where he thought maybe now, maybe now Potter was going to say this was in fact madness. Sheer madness, and how could Draco even think this would work.
She wrapped one on each arm, thick and winding and Draco listened to her as she walked through the steps. If all went well, he’d use them up as fast as possible. “Remove them when they dry, they’re done at that point, and get another. The mixture won't last too long itself, so we need to keep it hydrated and used as soon as possible.”
"A dragon parasite."
-Too loud, too stifling and Draco pulled out of the pensive.
“Because I can’t provide you anything but platitudes, they can help you process--”
He might have started to cry as he clung on. Draco didn’t look to see, his vision focused on the door. Watching the light shift as those outside moved around, grounded him. He would have to walk through a room of Aurors before reaching the Ministry Floos. Calm, collected, detached.
“How about Marco Glass?” Albus finally spoke up.
So about 2 hours late on this one. Wee bit longer though? I think?
Ha, as if he would. Not as if it hurt to make Harry Potter appear wrong. He cooed at her and accepted the pat over his beak with no qualms. He couldn’t see him but Draco heard Harry tut. Good.
Harry was starting to feel better. His eyes were starting to see again - no longer those sightless dull eyes that Harry fought to keep from closing. And after another few minutes of him blinking, rolling onto his side Harry broke the silence.
Blaise was a Zabini. A family which solidified its image by being as far away from political, social and moral scandal. This might have him running for the hills panicking. A Malfoy? Excuse him while he sharpened his talons, he’ll answer this when necessary. Draco shrugged, not bothering how Blaise and Harry interacted so long as no secrets were shared.
“Theo knows the ring’s worth, he’s not letting it go and I don’t want, can’t, risk this again.” For a second, Draco was sure Harry was going to argue, refute his desperation as also being foolish. “Destroy them, for good.” Please was the word Draco didn't say but Harry seemed to hear it loud and clear.
“It’s customary to go to a new opening of a friends business or venture - something about having many magical cores in the one place bringing luck.” Not that Draco ever believed it, never not even as a child. It was too easy even as a child who played as many games under the sun, luck was never easy. Luck should never be counted on: any business that tried that might as well melt their galleons and drink it.
They descended into a tiny room of harsh brick and wards marked in parchment which hung at the wall. Levitating in the centre were two rings, the Rings of Celius. The larger of two was adorned with a green stone and a dragon sitting around the framing. The smaller was blue and held no animal. It was plain in comparison. And out of the both, Draco knew the most powerful and horrid.
“Let’s not interfere with crups being adopted. That’s not going to help anyone.”
Well, he couldn’t say he didn’t snort at that one. “I wonder who he gets that from?”
Just be cordial. After all what if Harry was here to pick a fight? To lord over some failing Draco showed him before?
None fazed Neville, claiming all of them rather novice in terms of herbology and growing them wouldn’t take much expertise. Expecting Neville to ramble about plants was always the go to for Draco and yet Neville seemed eager to change subject too.
“I’m not really sure.”
A few days prior, Harry had refused to answer anyone after Draco didn’t redo a dressing. They'd argued, not surprisingly. All the leaves were gone now, the mixture grey and too old to be of any use. Draco had then asked Siobhan if they were addictive in any way. She had giggled at him and Draco didn’t need any words to feel daft.
“Are you doing better?”
Draco inhaled sharply, tense and sick all at once. Scorpius the chickenpox mad leper decided not only to do that ridiculous move, but narrowly missed colliding with one of the stands. How many times did Draco have to say people had to sit on the broom properly instead of flinging himself around and hoping it’d still be under him? Spines were not supposed to bend that way.
“Sensible if someone is after my vote or influence. Which according to this, is exactly what’s going on.” Draco tossed the letter, fell to the couch and sighed. Now things really didn’t make any sense. “Why try and kill me beforehand if my vote’s so precious?”
Albus wasn’t distraught over whatever was contained within the letter. Whatever Scorpius wrote had put a frown in place, one not removed even as he ignited the parchment to ash.
“Draco?” And he closed his eyes shut, bit at his lip and told himself this was stupid: he was being stupid, this shouldn’t be difficult. He could hold his wand - and that had been pointed at his most treasured person in the world. Why couldn’t he just write a bloody letter?
One of them, was it him, was it Harry, Draco didn’t know who started to tug at robes first. But Potter had his hand slide under everything, fingers against his collarbone and whatever noise Draco would have made, was swallowed down by Harry’s mouth. Potter’s hands were hot coals, imprinting onto his skin no matter where he moved them. He was taller as he hopped up onto - what was it, the chest of drawers - and Draco’s neck thanked him.
What kind of life would that be? What kind of relationship could he and Harry really have if all he did was have to comfort Draco’s paranoia? Harry seemed to understand. But he shook his head. Since when was rejecting a break up a possibility? Harry was stubborn but this was being idiotic.
“Draco? Malfoy? Blondie? Oi, you?” Harry rambled, his cheek leaning on his hand. “I shouldn’t have given you it,” he huffed and slouched onto the table.
“You’re going to lose. And pre-made microwave meals don’t count.”
“Well, what activated it?”
“You’re in a shitty mood, did I interrupt?” Blaise’s smile was always a bit blinding and more than a little crude. Draco shifted his weight, away from Potter, where he stood and decided to explain that one.
He couldn't control it any longer.
“I need you to listen,” Draco said and hoped the seriousness in his next request came over as a demand. Not a plead which Draco hoped would work. “Harry,” he heard Harry stop sniffing, “You're coming with me to Matthews. I know you didn’t show me everything.” Too much missing.
The second shop was dead in the dead ends of Knockturn Alley, where no one cared to linger. The bell above the door didn’t work and no sign hung over the shop.
“I wasn’t jealous.” Harry bit it out like Draco had insulted him. (My, my, how defensive). But it told a great deal more than a few heated stares could ever tell.
“So, who came up with the idea to give me a crup?”
“Bloody hell,” said Harry under his breath before, tried as he might, a smile struggled to stay off his face. “I was actually worried for a second.” There was no point revealing Draco wasn’t so confident moments ago. He wasn’t going to have that talk, here, with Harry anytime soon. Best keep ignorance in this scenario. “Keep going then, I’ll get you back. Eventually.”
“What does it look like, then?” Harry argued back and Draco wanted to abandon this. Was Potter really going to let Charlie release some unknown creature on him? Without seeing it? Without seeing the teeth? Oh, Merlin. How had Potter lived this long?
“Popcorn.”
Scorpius for once didn’t have anything to say and slinked away, Lotty following after.
“I warned you. This is your fault.” Was all he said and left the room too. Unfortunately Draco couldn’t leave his seat even as his leg cramped. This was awful. This was terrible and Draco closed his eyes, tried to put up some walls, some maze of mind so he could protect himself.
This was taking too long and was entirely too much for Draco to do much other than give some appreciation, he tugged at Harry’s hair, not able to get the best grip as Harry continued bobbing his head and making him whine.
“He won’t say he likes one in particular but he’s not going mute because you don’t like him.”
Was the warmth on his hand more blood of his own or someone else trying to rouse him from these phantoms?
“The fever, I’ll watch for now. But he just needs rest, and food when he wakes,” she said and that’s when Draco had had enough, enough of this swanning around and acting like she knew all. Like she expected Harry to wake and thank her for the pain, for the lies. She was only here for necessity. Right now, she was cooing over Potter with an affection reserved for close friends, not a Healer and patient.
Scorpius eyed the phantom dancing partner and its lack of facial features. Oh, wise up a little faster, please.
The night continued and somewhere in it, Draco dozed off again a vague acceptance that Harry had taken to stealing some of the covers leaving his back cold.
Was Harry always this obedient if the promise of affection sat at the end?
“If it attacks unprovoked, it can be put down.” Unimpressed with the threat, Draco stayed put. He half wanted her to try and see how she’d explain this to Potter. Just try it, dear.
Spluttering and coughing, reminding him of the past Muggle Nonsense, Harry slammed his hand on the table. Draco sipped at his tea and waited. Sounding much too meek he continued, “No? You don’t sound too bothered over the idea.”
The referee took it upon themselves to call Puddlemere the winners by default as the Seeker had eventually sang sweet nothings and promptly headbutted a Bludger, marking him out for at least the rest of the season.
“It’s okay, isn’t it?” Regretting it as soon as it caught the air. What he wanted would never happen, Astoria was gone. She could never give him permission. Astoria was gone and she would want him to move on and not sulk, not ‘be lonely’. They’d always promised one another to be each other’s world against the world. To have each other and have no one else matter. And Draco missed the assurance.
“I know you’re on the wards, you shit!”
Harry grabbed at his wrists, tried to ease them away. “Are you okay? What’s going on?”
At his home, Draco never chased much prey or fellow wildlife. He did like to harass the peacocks. Which demanded he leave their territory with those puffed up tails and Draco would flutter up and down the field and he’d have his revenge after being bit by one, aged eight.
“Sorry.”
“Is there any other votes that matter coming up?” Harry asked, seemingly wanting Blaise to answer. But Draco didn’t want to delve into too much political talk out in the open.
And just like that, Draco laughed. “When this is all over, I’ll show you whatever memory you’d like of her spoiling you.” He was fond of her cooing over Scorpius as a toddler, just before he learned to speak instead of babble. She laughed when he did, and he laughed when Astoria laughed. On and on it went and Draco wasn’t sure how it started.
How foolish, how could he ever face Blaise again--
“Thank you.” She was still staring and Draco excused himself without looking at her in the eye. “Scorpius and I will be in the inner sanctum, I have to try and undo some of the damage James may have done.”
“Where’d you find this one? Or did he find you? He seems out of your league, Harry.”
Harry stood there in his silly Muggle clothing, holding a stack of parchment tied haphazardly together, looking as comfortable as Draco felt.
“You deserve more than my leftovers. Have Lotty make more, why are you--” Draco squirmed away more, Harry’s breathy laugh tickling at his neck as he hugged into him tight. “What?” Draco grumbled, awkwardly trying to keep Harry away with his shoulder and ear nearly pressed up to each other.
He could hear them accuse Draco already of tricking or manipulating. A drink, that’s all Draco wanted. Nothing dramatic or newsworthy was to happen tonight. Fixing his collar for the third time, Draco told himself how he was perfect and shouldn’t be too worried. Luna would be there.
“Yes, send a letter to Ginny. You’ll both need formal attire.” He moved on fast, hoping to have as little contact with Harry as possible until after the party. So, Siobhan was next. “I expect you to attend too. Paid extra if you manage to keep the reason why you’re here out of the air.” He offered her galleons, as he expected the Healer had used more funds to just purchase new ingredients. She took them, though seemed a little annoyed at the ten galleons he'd fished from his pocket.
“Lotty! Potter’s awake!” He wasn’t dealing with Harry if he was still near death. Meanwhile Harry surveyed the room and, either he realised he was in a completely different room or he was more curious on the table of bitter smelling spills.
“A muscle relaxant would put me in a brain fog for days, never mind the complications abound with spells.” Not trusting himself casting complex spells was one thing, trying one on himself while he felt the call of sleep was another. Also, Draco was fine with this discomfort not so much the pain brought by those unknotting muscle spells.
The early morning turned into a late lunch and then, the night came again.
Ginny was pulling on his arm to sit down and have another round. “You most certainly do not.” Draco grabbed the scruff of Harry’s clothing and yanked him far away for Ginny to lose her husband and apparated. Least this way, Draco was only making a point. No one would think it was all to steal Harry Potter from Co. to get off with each other like they were teenagers who couldn’t control themselves.
“Let’s go find out what’s going on with Siobhan.”
“I--” And Harry was there but not. A ghost, a walking death, like those after the War who couldn’t handle what they’d seen or done. About to break if they ever stopped, ever slowed and thought over it. Window glass fragmented, though did not shatter, lines of damage growing.
And that’s when Draco blamed his parents for him not being patient in people responding. Siobhan didn’t message that day or the following and by the third Draco was snippy and sniping. In response, Harry had announced, with Lotty as a witness, he was being an absolute git. Was it really his fault when Siobhan could’ve lied again? What if they were losing her trail? What if--
“Draco? Did I hurt you? Are you okay?” He sounded out of breath and tried to open Draco’s bedroom door but it stayed locked. “Open the door.”
Another week passed and Draco was glad at the routine which allowed him to squirrel himself away in his lab following no interruptions. Sixty potions and counting and Draco understood Charlie Weasley’s desperation. Either the potion’s half life was too short and would be ineffective lasting a whole night or the ingredients themselves counteracted with each other and boiled over.
Sadly, Scorpius was a terrible liar. Potter showed patience, not reproaching him as soon as the lie hit the air.
First matter of business was to refresh himself with a shower. He’d looked around for his wand, found it in the little cabinet next to him and spelled a series of quick, quality of life spells. Like combing his hair quickly and cleaning the awful taste out of his mouth.
Letting Harry fall back would do no one any good. Hermione hadn’t a clue this time. No doubt saving face for her own job. Best not allow Harry too much leeway in case it blew up in her face. And with the fact her lack of knowledge over Theo and Blaise? Harry had shortened his own leash quite considerably.
“More FireWhiskey,” he managed to say without slurring. But if only the bartender stopped moving so much.
Considering the last to apparate into the grounds was Pansy, perhaps the crup was trying to protect him. Or perhaps… He spied Lotty scowling from the door at Harry, her head half-through it. Lotty was never the most subtle of the house-elves, but certainly the most loyal.
It didn’t make any sense. If she was planted, why did her presence make whoever did this kill her. If she wasn’t one why not simply offer her more Galleons than Draco.
He crossed his legs, leaned back and the way Harry gulped. Not helping, Potter. Not helping. The chill seeped into his back, gave him something else to focus on. He didn’t know what to do with his hands – other than putting them back on Harry’s skin – he clasped them, sat them on his knee.
Protecting himself was easier than protecting everyone else. There was no danger being caught, betrayed when his secret never made it to anyone’s ears. So, Draco kept re-adjusting his feathers, ignoring the woman and the magic which eased away after a time. He could only imagine how many people would buy an owl, do a crime and blame it on him.
They left, got out the house. Mr. and Mrs. Squib refused to say anything. The Boy ended up going back with the Trainee.
“Are you sure, Hermione?” Potter’s turnabout was a curious thing indeed. His anger, the magic and glare previous melted away and now was left looking at Hermione as if she was talking nonsense. Perhaps the idea Draco was this owl - Fornax - was too much for his brain to process.
“Maybe you should see a Healer.”
Everything stopped. The magic stayed, no longer sinking or floating, no longer strangling or burning.
The ring’s heat seeped through his clothes, bearable but uncomfortable. Draco wasn’t keen to remove it.
“You’ve made that quite clear.” It wasn’t as if Draco was going to appeal to have Albus return. History said how Harry would most certainly not do the same either. Maybe Harry would be happy at this?
He wasn’t sure what to say to Lily as she appeared to take to staring at him like a guard dog from the stairs.
“What can I do?”
“Yes.”
“Deliberate? It doesn’t make a difference, he’s dead and it’s my fault.”
“No Pansy?” Draco didn’t know whether to laugh at the ignorance or the implications.
Harry paid attention to the dog that sat watching as some of Draco appeared and reappeared. He hid under it fully a few times till Harry spoke up, “Still there?”
Blaise handed him him the small vial, cast inside was a thick purple liquid which reminded Draco of Astoria’s favourite flowers. Charms and hexes went hand in hand but a curse was not so easily removed. What did one potion do? Rather, what did one potion brewed by Blaise Zabini hope to accomplish?
A fairly decent plant but not so convincing. Draco shook his head.
“So, which is it? The Will or the Magic that’s royally buggered?”
“Are you sure?” Draco needled, “I’d hate for you to try this again. Please, do carry on, get it out of your system.” Not that seeing an ill person, once strong enough to destroy the Manor, now pitifully squirming on the floor was an enjoyable spectacle. Harry was not one to follow boundaries and the sooner he learned to take everything slowly, the better for everyone. The easier Draco could sleep and not worry about the fool leaving, thinking he knew best and doing more damage to himself in the long run.
“I suspect they might suspect.” Watching as they both seemed to chat excited and confused the next, Draco wasn’t sure if this was a positive or a negative.
“I knew it, you’re only after me for my Muggle technology.”
Good. Couldn’t be having it too easy.
Nope. Not happening.
Changing topics was a relief, a boon.
“You have to move, okay? We need this.”
This was a cult wasn’t it? Why such apathy? He shot a look down at the bucket of puffs and realised he’d eaten most of it. A cult, a mind-controlling cult is what this was. What didn’t help was when an explosion - and again, such apathy - Draco flinched. How could they all be so calm? A huge Muggle Transport had just blown up, plumes of smoke and raging fire - and the heroes of this story weren’t even safe yet.
So he sent it:
“What are you talking about?” Theo was guarded but thankfully listening.
“It’s all Potter’s fault.” He snorted at the line. “You made everything easy. Potter certainly doesn’t. He’s a mess.” If Astoria were to ever converse with him, it would be to argue that point. “I’m a mess too, yes. Thanks for that,” Draco replied to the phantom in his head. It helped to think she was listening, still interested in his living.
(See the end of the chapter for
Grime and soot covered his feathers now. But Draco had a mission, make sure to appease Scorpius’ worry. His wing ached and by the time he fluttered to the ground he admitted his time of flying grand open areas were over. Walking wasn’t the quickest but it gave time for Draco to squash his own worry over his injury. Three days was a long time for a wizarding owl to be injured. What spell had that idiot cast on him?
“I’ll help, once these Cauldrons don’t need to be attended to; fifteen minutes give or take.”
“Can’t wait. You've a week to do your absolute best.” He always did like Lotty’s enthusiasm. She left, humming loudly to herself.
“It’s a house, it doesn't have feelings. You’re a threat or not and after your show yesterday, I imagine you’re squarely in the ‘threat’ category.” Draco decided then he’d had enough time spent in this dining room. No more minutes of his life needed to remind him of the past - even if his house was covered in history.
The shower was biting cold and Draco didn’t bother to change the temperature neither did he care about the Manor’s suggestion of a meal. He slept in his bed for the first time in three days and he took hours to fall asleep. Awaking, Lotty stood at his bedside and he waited. She wasn’t upset or distressed so Harry was probably still alive.
“If you’re still annoyed, we can continue.”
“You could use a bath.” Harry rubbed his finger and thumb together and Draco didn’t need the eyesight of an owl to know how thick the soot was. He ruffled his feathers at the thought so much dirt clung to him. If a mirror were around, he would take stock of the damage. So, Draco agreed and allowed the sobering Harry to scoop him up in his arms and relocate to the bathroom.
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry said, sounding like he was the victim in this talk.
“Lords and their houses, right?”
“Sure, then we can both head to the Ministry.”
Fuck.
“You’ll be safe here,” Harry said with such a serious expression it didn’t sound like a platitude but more of a promise. Draco laughed, something so insignificant shouldn’t make him feel at ease, not at all. “I mean it.”
A suspicious Harry Potter was easy enough to handle.
He really wanted to return to bed.
“What did you think was stolen last time?” Freezing, he couldn’t ask why Harry was asking, they might be connected, they might not. “You panicked over it.” Harry prodded him and he didn’t know what to do, did he keep this secret? “And you're panicking over it again.”
Draco knew never to trust a Potter that tried to suppress a smile.
How had Harry married anyone was beyond him. For once, Draco wanted to extend his condolences to Ginny. Quelling the obvious anxiety on Potter’s face wasn’t as urgent as Draco was finishing his morning cuppa.
“We are not friends,” Draco said it on auto-pilot because for a while, that’s all he said, all Harry said if either of them were seen having a civil conversation and someone pointed it out. No one could befriend Harry Potter after the War. No one. Not even the overt and fresh faces of the Aurors. Draco was not one who misjudged civility with friendship.
“You wake up from nightmares. About a case, the one in your office you don’t go near. I’m no fool, I know it’s all connected somehow.”
“There’s a lot of reasons why magic can go haywire.” Even to Draco she sounded patronising. Harry set him down, maybe a little too gentle on the floor before he followed too and picked up the strangest object Draco had ever seen. Was this the ‘hairdryer’. Did Potter know nothing? Owls had feathers,
“I could be enjoying a kiss but sadly, my easily manipulated self must be protected from the Muggles.” Draco couldn’t even keep a straight face and burst into a series of giggling laughter. He was so glad he came out on this Muggle-date.
Draco never asked anything else. What was the point when he could ask Scorpius? What was the point in prolonging this awkward affair that made Draco’s normal still hands tremor slightly. No one would notice. Harry wouldn’t notice. Get over it.
Anyone who came here for a crup didn’t leave with a quarter-blood.
What Draco really wanted was—The game had continued on. And Harry didn’t so much as glance in his direction. No, he chatted with Ginny and Draco scowled. Another few rounds, some opting out if they hadn’t finished their drinks. Draco refused to join in at any point now. Luna was just making things up as she went but Draco couldn’t remember her losing any Whispers.
Rubbing at his face, Harry let out a sigh to render all others obsolete. Ah, and the fluttering returned - as if they’d ever really left - Draco hadn’t a clue how to handle this, these, feelings a crashing and consuming tsunami.
Draco shouldn’t have come here; this would have him faint. Although, it would be a lie, an awful twisting lie if he ever said he was disappointed by how Scorpius handled himself. Scorpius was much better at Quidditch than Draco could ever have hoped to be.
“Wilks, great, someone just curse me dead and get it over with. Why not have Voldemort just reappear and mutilate me again? Why not? Everyone get their kicks in now.”
“You’re enjoying this.”
“We’re going. I need to see your reaction to a platypus.” Draco was rushed to dress to go to Muggle London and while Draco wasn’t too fussed on leaving his more wizarding attire behind, leaving the safe house was the issue. Would anyone really expect to see Draco in a Muggle zoo?
What exactly was he doing?
Maybe Harry would realise he never had to write to Harry much because he was always in his bloody house. Or Draco sat perched in the middle of the Aurors without fuss.
“So, guess you’re in love with Harry after all? When did I say that? How long ago?”
He didn’t need the papers any more and left to deal with the biggest issue he would face. People he didn’t know. They’d be here, in his house and he’d have to make them happy and comfortable enough for them to listen and hear what Hermione said. The only way he knew how to do that was what he was taught. A guest list was expected at five, Hermione claiming there were a few problematic people who hadn’t said if they were bringing someone else or not.
But what if Blaise really hadn't chosen to betray him? He chirped, he had hoped one day he would awake and it all be a nightmare not worth another thought. Forget it. Kill the false hope, destroy the inkling of light out of all this. This mess. He flew around, going wherever the wind decided to blow. The Muggles were out in large numbers today, most with one-tailed crup look alikes, and Draco perched on another roof, though not or long. An owl out in the middle of the day would probably alarm most.
“About what, Harry?” Luna asked as she wrapped her scarf around Draco - he didn’t mind even if it restricted his ability to flap his wings as she tied it in a firm knot. “If it’s quite alright with you, Mr. Owl, I’d like to see inside your mouth for a second.”
“You’ve offended Lotty,” Draco announced as he swept by the mangy birds. Harry fell into step, not bothering to ask him to slow down.
“Unless you want to see the inside of my family Mausoleum, I suggest you stop talking Ms Goven. Heal him.” She didn’t move. “Now.” Whatever argument went on in her head, she relented and set about smoothing the mishmash of skin and muscle. Draco oversaw her every step. He wouldn’t call on her again.
“He said as much.” Harry stopped dead by Draco’s side, “Though, I remember Blaise not being very good at Potions.”
Draco made a noise he refused to dignify as his. “I am not in love with Potter. I haven’t seen in--” He shook his head. Forever. “--Months.”
Wood slid together and the noise made Draco turn back to the Manor. Standing by the window, opened wide and with a cracking voice as if he were straining himself Harry yelled, “Fornax! Draco needs you to come inside!”
It was an old case of Firewhiskey, some out of date promotion about catching a novelty snitch on the packaging. Six bottles and Draco still didn’t know if this was the wisest of decisions but today was-- too much, really. Wilks dug at an old wound that would most likely never heal.
Draco read about people he wasn’t sure he’d never met.
It took longer to get into the blasted thing than for either of them to fall sleep. Draco dreamed and found himself back at Hogwarts, staring over at Harry again over breakfast. And then he was back at the Ministry doing his best to converse with someone Hermione might need only to Harry pop up and ruin it.
“Unless you want Blaise knowing you’re sick, sit here.” Draco slid off his chair by the lab and waved Harry’s seat over. Harry nodded, a little frantic and tried to push himself off and onto the other. It was a mess, really. Harry shifting himself over to a chair shouldn’t take that much time. But Draco didn’t offer help, not until the door opened and he heard Blaise yell down.
“That was fun.” Harry admitted and seemed to scuff his shoes at the already scuffed marble of the Manor.
Harry shifted around, rotated the empty bowl in his lap. “Sorry.”
“No. Now, off you go. Stay out of trouble.”
“Well, that’s unfortunate.” He ran a hand through his hair – dried and no longer flat and lifeless after two weeks of no attention.
Ron took his sweet time returning. Draco did have to wonder how the Weasley family operated. Did Charlie not talk to Ron as often as Ginny? Was that how siblings worked? As an only child, Draco had nothing to compare the way the Weasleys acted.
“You want me to spy for you?”
“Don’t be jealous, Decimus.” The crup argued back, a grumble and howl, though the crup seemed more energised the more Draco spoke to it. And it started to circle him more, like some overgrown cat. “Okay, okay, I’ll show you where you live. Come on you ridiculous hound.” Shaking his head, though he couldn’t stop the bubbling excitement and sheer happiness at the fact he was showing a crup around. A crup! In Malfoy Manor!
With orders given and well received if the cry of anger and the booming bark said anything, Draco went to the Healer he’d decided on. Waiting rooms weren’t for Draco so he went inside, found the place ten minutes behind and left to find himself walking back towards the Floo and back to the clinic. He'd searched around, found this one and read up on him a bit. Nothing too extensive.
The first point on the checklist was: TELL THE CRUP ITS NAME (Master Imprint will start after it is said, please follow all instructions to complete the Imprintation process, no one else should be involved during this step).
And somehow despite it all, Harry and Draco went to Diagon Alley. They’d Floo’ed to the Leaky Cauldron, Harry still bumping into Draco as they moved through the crowds. Since Harry wasn’t too steady on his feet, Draco ignored it but it didn’t stop.
“Heard you were out,” Blaise didn’t sound too pleased at that revelation, “I take it that means you’re out of the woods and all that?” Turning to look at the once proud Manor made Draco squirm. Hating the blasted place and letting people see it like this were two very different beasts.
Draco was furious and hurt and irate. But even with those muddling his perception: Neville, like usual, held no hint of malice. He wasn’t cackling away like Theo would, or feeding him excuses like Pansy, or minimizing and dismissing like Blaise had done all those times before.
“He’s so small.” Draco’s pinky was stolen away by Scorpius’ whole hand and he held on as tight as a newborn could.
“And we do have an owl that can return them.”
Only the thump as Harry fell to the floor, a groan from hitting his nose - glasses squashed against his brow - and Draco laughed. In relief, honestly, and in no way sadistic despite Harry’s attempt to glare back at him. Harry flailed a little, rolling onto his side and Draco rolled his eyes. He should call Siobhan, let her deal with this.
Revenge, tree, wards. That was the plan.
“Draco, seriously, can you listen?”
A bit of fluff as next chapter will be super long, since it's sorta the climax for Draco's mystery. I'm not sure how long it will take me but I'm getting it done. It's in two parts, though so it shouldn't be too long between updates. =) Thank you for reading!
“Worst joke I’ve heard all day and Lotty only knows one.” It wasn’t a polite manufactured laugh that passed between them. Potter erupted and Draco nearly flinched, Blaise didn’t so much as chuckle and the damned self-conscious itch was back and a flutter in his chest at the sound of Harry’s unabashed laughter was the most confusing thing about it all.
Meanwhile Neville, poor, poor Neville held up his hands and waved them like a mad man as Draco used him as a leaning cane.
“Neville, yeah, that’s right. Really? Cheers. No. It’s alright, you’ve done loads. I’ll send you a picture. Yeah. See you. Hope so.” It took all of Draco’s self-control not to ask about what was making Harry’s eyes practically twinkle. Paranoia said it was a conversation all about him - or was that his ego? Offering the phone back, Draco refused, not now when he knows it might yell at him on someone else’s behalf.
...Draco snorted. What was he up to?
“Tell them the ring’s a fake.” Draco blinked. Looked down at his hands and nearly died at the sight. Certainly there was a ring, one which looked identical on his opposing hand. It wasn’t one of the rings of Celius though, Draco couldn’t feel any of the malice and regret seeping through.
“Harry.” he tried at first to coax his hands away but Harry didn’t budge. They struggled a little, until Draco pushed his thumbs between Potter’s jaw and wrists. The potion hissed as it boiled over into the flames and Draco dismissed it as a failure. What a lot of good it would do anyway. For another struggle, all his own, Draco panicked if his handling of Potter had made him far worse.
“So, me leaving. Is there a time limit?” It was an off comment, really. One instantly recognised as not a joke, despite how lighthearted Harry tried to pass over it. He’d stilled, stalling in fidgeting or examining Draco’s hand.
Draco liked to think he was a bit of a Secret Keeper now. Despite a vast majority of the texts were labelled deleted. Okay, so maybe Neville might be closer to a Secret Keeper.
“They’re pretty cute.”
“You have access to an All-Mother?” Siobhan’s scepticism was refreshing, if only it meant she really hadn’t seen the giant hole in the Manor. “We’ll need everyone to cooperate… do you have five mortars and pestles? And pure distilled water. We can make a salve from the paste.”
“You really do wear your wedding ring all the time,” Harry said and ended up groaning, his fingers rubbing his temples. His wedding ring was still on too.
Rounding the corner, Draco saw Harry and Blaise but saw no sign of his son or Albus. Neither were lying on the floor, no blood or pools to indicate they were hurt. Setting him against the wall, finally being left to fend for himself, Theo had his wand out but wasn’t aiming it at either Harry or Blaise. Not yet anyway.
Hermione had really mastered the art of sounding threatening without being here. He smirked, knowing if he was too upbeat he'd be questioned on it. Right, he would have to find Lotty and Harry. Harry first. This would be the easiest and smoothest way to segway into the invitation for Harry to invite his wife. Both of them were still with the owls - most which had left to hunt. The little pygmy owl was nuzzling into his hands and being fed. Siobhan was looking out the window, arms crossed.
Draco narrowed his eyes. He was unconscious for a while. Right. This wasn't going unanswered.
“--Like I care about your little friend.”
“Hopefully he’ll be happier to see you. The Minister’s furious, I’ve never seen her so mad.” Hermione? What had they done wrong? The Auror-In-Training, Draco couldn’t image her being anything else, went to pet him and he eyed those fingers with ill-intent.
“It wasn’t that bad.”
“He did good, now he’s useless. We got hammered in parchment and it’s his fault. Thinks ‘e can do whatever he likes.”
Nathan left with a snort and a freshly signed ink. The door closed. A familiar blanket of magic wrapped around the room. Draco shifted, talon to nail. He didn't speak, the question easily in the air already. Harry could try, and fail, to avoid explaining. He scratched at his temple, looking away from where Draco perched on the table. Harry closed his eyes, sigh heavy.
“Could you repeat that?” Draco narrowed his eyes at both Harry and his mother on the opposite sofa. What could they possibly be up to? The both of them weren’t on the greatest terms, not after Scorpius and Draco had ran back to France. And here they were, drinking tea and the form which they alluded to covered up in the middle of the table with more parchment.
His eyes watered for a moment, and then everything went blurry.
Really? Was he supposed to weep over everything? Let Blaise take his sleep and take his mind when he’s awake? No. Draco refused. Enough thinking over it. Right, Potter had forgotten no doubt about him being in the Wizarding World again. Muggles typically didn’t just leap from windows unless something was terribly wrong. Draco had done nothing too bizarre, a midnight stroll at best.
“You arse.” Draco's head fell back against the couch and he stared up at the ceiling. Oh, he could feel it. The Manor being too alert for its own good. The magic twinged his arm no longer but did double its efforts in giving him a headache.
Oh. “Finally, some competence.” Lotty’s ears perked up before she gave a nervous look to the ruined marble floor.
And Harry just seemed quite happy to leave it at that. At least he hadn't ruined anything last night.
Draco wondered why Belarus and what was there. Even more so, he wanted to know why Hermione didn’t think to buy a few seeds and deal with Potter’s problem in a single night. Did she honestly not know? “Only one way to find out.” Draco looked at Harry expectantly, “Come on, I don’t have all day.” He waved him closer.
“Yeah, okay.” He was disappointed. Which was a curious and frankly crazy reaction. Had he forgotten about keeping this as far away from the newspapers as possible? What if Rita was sniffing around? What if someone overheard? Draco would never be pleased at being a secret – he liked attention especially from those he liked. Really, was there a better feeling than walking into a place and the one person who everyone clamoured for attention only wanted to talk to him? But the idea of revealing to Harry’s friends - and Draco still wasn’t sure this was sane even going to the Leaky - and telling them all about it was madness.
What should they talk about? If not those two? If not themselves both, once a time, wrapped up in each other and their pains of the world. Draco kept an eye on the amount of people milling around. If he wanted to fly, there could be no one around. Too busy here. Too busy here to really talk too.
“Come on, Lotty.” Draco wasn’t sure how he managed to pull himself back together. Maybe the Floo helped, maybe having Lotty whimpering at his side was what scolded his own panic away however briefly.
Albus was again, trying not to look him in the eye. Apparently Draco’s silence hadn’t been taken as a blank refusal. What good would teaching Albus some potions do? Perhaps he could show the kid how to make the potions for Harry – and maybe it might help mediate between the two. It was no secret to anyone who knew Harry that his relationship with Albus was at times frayed and worn like an old blanket.
Mary gave him another few pats, ones that Draco didn't want to accept, especially when Harry noticed. Self-conscious again Potter knew he was hiding, he hooted Mary's hand away.
“Sir! Sir! Your owl’s gone barmy!” Collins yelled in the distance and Draco followed not the sound of that too gruff voice but the scraping of a beetle panicking. He fluttered over another desk, another chair, landed on the corner to see the bulbous back disappear under a hole in another desk.
Pretended he had read nothing. He could push this back for a time. It was a short note, nothing urgent.
“Don’t you start--” Harry panicked, clear as day and everyone including Draco gauged this with interest, no doubt for entirely different reasons. Ha. This was going to be easier than Neville.
“Sir, I can handle an uppity pureblood.”
“Fuck.” Draco touched his side, blood pooling through his shirt. It didn’t hurt, not until he tried to stand. Then it burned and sapped the strength from his legs.
The Malfoy Manor was quiet upon entry. Both Harry and Draco glanced at each other because they could hear the silence die at the yelling. And they both knew those voices. Draco marched to the foyer, panicked and furious at seeing his son losing and wounded. “Scorpius!” Draco saw Scorpius on the floor, flailing and fighting like a Muggle. The same mess of hair eased the panic into confused annoyance. “Separate, the two of you.” Albus and Scorpius were flung away to the opposite sides of the room. A dull thunk as they both were dropped back onto the floor.
“I’m helping your precious underlings.” Draco took to hunting for what he needed. Had to be in this mess somewhere, but let’s not start casting magic just in case someone would sense it.
“I wish Albus lived on his own. James is always saying--” Draco turned to see if Scorpius’ face matched his brooding tone but all he did was stop talking, features blank and revealing little. When did he learn that? His son gave another shrug and Draco decided not to ask.
“Hey. Yeah. It’s me. Hi.” Harry smiled. And a smile from someone else should never make Draco giddy. Don’t think about how nice it was to hear Harry’s voice again. To hear the lilt in his voice when he was pleased.
It stunned him. Clear as day: Luna and Neville probably argued. Draco bet they never cast curses and hexes at each other. The Golden Trio too. He-- He pocketed his wand before Neville spied his trembling hands.
When it was clear Harry wasn’t going to turn around, wasn’t going to look and when the thoughts were focused on him Draco found it easier. So much easier to write random crap which helped. It wasn’t stressful. It was ridiculous.
“What happened to your hand?” Harry frowned and glanced between it and Draco. Draco made a point of looking innocent.
Doing the math in his head Draco scowled, at first believing himself wrong that in his age and weariness had him unable to do simple sums. “Potter, that’s--” He did it again, the weeks in a year multiplied by three, times seven. Draco knew he was right. “You bloody idiot! That’s over a thousand vials with dragonblood.” He gave a once over to Potter again. How was he still sane? Blood of any creature had enough to cause addiction — and that was the kindest results.
was impressed by Potter’s magic and he coughed into his hand.
“Missing breakfast won’t help.” Harry was frowning, probably expecting his gracious offer to be returned not shot down. Draco didn’t even need to look, not when his voice tightened and it was clear that the dismissal had hurt, if just a little, “Fine. I’ll leave. Just promise to eat—”
Wringing his hands together he rubbed at the missing ring and couldn't say if the weight upon him was guilt or not. “Sorry.” Never, not once had she ever wanted him to burden himself with the blasted thing so he shouldn't mind the mangled mess. He spent his time talking in half-sentences, curious questions he didn't quite want to speak fully. Would it be possible for him to be with anyone else? Harry's name was never said but her pictures never seemed to scowl. As much as he liked to feel he was talking to her, he knew he'd never hear her voice again unless he replayed a memory. And the worrying part was as time marched and waited for no one, Astoria's voice wasn't so clear in his head any more.
Maybe Harry was as equally still on edge as his idea of a drink was back home. Draco couldn’t complain, not when Lotty greeted them, relieved they’d voted and not, as she put it, ‘been terribly murdered’.
“Always wanted to be a Hufflepuff.”
This is first part -- wasn't going to split this up but it just kept going and going and going and yeah. Big chapter for you all. <3 Next one is similar in length too. :0
Harry knelt down, kept the intensity in his eyes – the same he had back in the Hogwarts bathroom - and hands on his. “Do you think Theo’s capable?”
The last thing he remembered seeing was the miasma and some antlers.
A yell that sounded much like Harry was having far too much fun on Draco’s account followed him, “You love me!
“Bloody hell, you’re freezing.” Harry set him on the armoire covering him with a towel, not so fluffy and not warm like before. Unlike the rest of the wizarding houses, the Malfoy Manor was old - plumbing might be installed but electricity was not - a shame really. As Harry manhandled his feathers, the Muggle instrument that blew warm air seemed like a luxury.
“I’ll buy you one when I’m allowed to walk around again. As thanks and all.”
“Why not?” Scorpius glanced in the direction of the study.
Harry grabbed his hand, sticky too. Urgh. Along with the wind a gust seemed to carry away the sensation from both leaving no trace behind.
Draco sulked till Happy Hour was over and returned home for a new day. His attempts to remove himself from the his next outing failed. Scorpius sulked, dramatics and all.
“Malfoy.” He froze, not at the distant name but how it sounded far different from anything Draco ever heard. Now he was back in there, in that room, with Harry clawing at him.  “Stop it.”
Harry’s face was by large too close and before Draco could do anything, Harry rubbed his cheek against Draco in a way, reminded him of a fond cat.
“Forget I said anything.” It was the bludgering way he’d forced the words out - they couldn’t be said quick enough. Draco wasn’t sure what in this room was funny - other than him and all he was doing was now getting rid of that foul smell from his hands. What remained a vague curiosity ended up having Draco’s full attention even as Lotty entered with another meal.
“Albus?” Neville spotted him first, putting his wand away and walking over. Albus gave a more excited greeting to him than Draco had ever seen him give anyone bar Scorpius. He should leave. Leave the two of them to talk.
“Master! The creature shouldn’t stay in Master’s room, that’s for Master and Madam Astoria and Mast--”
Being outside eased the nerves. Draco knocked at the door before being yelled at to come in already. Hermione’s mood wasn’t what Draco expected as he slipped into her still chaotic station. She’d sounded run off her feet with no broom nearby.
“Dad--” Whatever Albus was going to ask was cut off as Scorpius’ attention went to Blaise who didn’t seem to care about the idea he’d have to deal with two.
“Lonely? This one?”
“You let go when you feel dizzy or light-headed, not before. I imagine the speed this grew at - you’re not even half-empty.” Draco shook his head, he was a little jealous over how magic seemed so easy to Potter. Too easy, as if Draco was the abnormal one.
“Do you want to go to Muggle London for a bit?” Harry tacked on, “on a date?”
That was cruel.
Now, to find something decent to wear. That old suit from before, he might manage to pull it off. Not as if he’d had any other parties to show it.
Sitting up, Harry was more than curious, eyes twinkling like it would be the answer to all his questions. “Do you still have it?”
“I’ve only thought I’m going to die twice in my life, Potter and this was one of them. It’s called a Smothering Cold for a reason.”
Awkward.
“Blaise! Enough. You’re not controlling anything, take it off.” Theo wasn’t a constant fixture in Blaise’s house and Draco wondered if he had been asked about Draco’s disappearance. Defending him didn’t make much sense otherwise. But here Nott was standing with his own wand ready to duel Blaise.
For another second, Harry’s silence made Draco want to gulp and have the ability to mute his ears at will. What could he say, Draco was used to suspecting everyone and their motives. Being told he was a bit on the paranoid side by someone who supposedly liked him would hold much more weight than a prissy Blaise who said whatever came to mind when annoyed enough. What did he do if  Potter did think him too suspicious?
“Want to try that sentence again?”
It took another few mouthfuls of freshly made dessert for him to reconsider. “Ever since they’ve shared that flat, Albus hasn’t been Albus. He’s like some hybrid James-Albus who--” Scorpius cast his glare down as if he was embarrassed. “Who calls you a Deatheater and thinks you should have went to Azkaban.”
Urgh, feeling Blaise’s emotions sohot through him and – Draco didn’t need to feel like about Theodore Nott.
He nipped whoever tried to crowd him. Get out of the way! Rita Skeeter was the vilest human being to live and Draco would rather be friendly with Collins. Another person tried to calm him and he hissed and nipped those fingers too. While she was stuck in the bullpen of Aurors and their paperwork, the chances she’d transform back were nill. She would flee first and Draco could only hope to find her now.
Feeling a tad awkward, not sure if Harry would point blank refuse, Draco edged closer and hugged him. The ridiculousness of Harry’s wild hair tickled at his face and cheek as he rested on his head.
What was he getting himself into? Draco left with the intention never to return.
“I really don’t think this is good idea.” Charlie only gave them a quick look before he continued. “This could kill you Harry. Please.”
Amused, Harry didn’t stop. In fact this seemed to be of great entertainment to him. Why, how could washing dishes like this ever be entertaining? He even had to put the still soaked plate up on its side and the soap dripped down. They weren’t even dry yet!
Was it risky? Yes, of course, it was bloody the riskiest Draco was going near while Potter was in the Manor. Siobhan and Harry however were not entirely trustworthy or honest. Trading in pain potions and Harry reluctant to demand walking help from Siobhan whilst she refused was a curious scenario. What else was going on? Lotty had not raised any alarm.
Sorry but updates will be a wee bit slower for the next week or so and should pick up again after that. (Just got a lot of running around the last few weeks and next week to do and that should be me back to my normal routine).
In the night, a blanket of anonymity to most, Harry started talking against Draco’s neck. Head between Draco’s and the pillows like he was trying bury underneath and hibernate.
“You’re not mad from this morning? That got a bit rough.” Again he tried to fix the already perfectly sitting glasses.
Bloody what? Tilting his head all the way around, seeing Potter from upside down did not help explain what Potter was talking about. Again.
“Dad. It’s-- It’s okay.” To say Scorpius was ready to duel him wasn’t even in the realm of possibility. If Draco duelled Scorpius his son would die.
He awoke again, hungry and listless. The plates he cleared was half the previous night and Draco found the luxury of having a lie in that following day did wonders for his mood. That morning he spent grooming away that which he couldn’t do previous, making sure if anyone appeared in his house, he’d look as a Malfoy should. Perfect.
“And as soon as you heard you rushed over, is that it? Should I thank you?”
Oh. No. Of course not. Draco had only ever mentioned specific details to Matthews to explain, to reveal the chills and trembling whenever Draco didn’t rest well. He had to write what happened down? No. He didn’t want to do that, to have whatever Auror wanted to simply wander in and read it like a gossip rag. To comb through it as if Draco was lying or the one at fault.
“Blaise?” Draco called out, trying to pinpoint where exactly he was. Blaise was loud like his magic, all show and not much substance. Out Blaise popped from one of the rooms ahead, wand in hand and he seemed confused at first. Then he put it away, eyeing Draco’s all the same. He might know who but not the why and so Draco kept his wand at the ready.
Oh. That was true.
“It was just a stupefy, she’s fine. You may have a headache for a few hours.”
“Fine.” Draco turned to fetch the soaking bandages. If he saw Harry’s satisfied face at winning (again) Draco would suffocate the man with them. They smelled worse, the older they were. Bitter but reminiscent of peppermint, something that stuck in his nose and throat and opened up his lungs with a breath. Draco sat on the bed, decided even though Harry offered that mangled arm of his - no longer mangled but Draco couldn’t see anything else - he took the other to rewrap first. So, Draco picked and pulled the top of the material and it crackled further and he hated this.
“I believe you.”
Luna gave Harry a hug - one not even he was expecting. It was awkward. They didn't normally hug, then.  And they awkwardly said goodbye as Luna too, left Harry alone.
He wanted desperately to have someone else to appreciate and have as his, as an equal and on his side without having to second guess all the time. He wanted to wake up without an empty bed. But was this – did this count, could it?
Draco whistled. It skidded and bounded towards them before barking at Neville. Curious, Decimus sniffed. Wagged its tails. More curious over Neville than Harry for once.
“It is a bear.” If Potter thought saying it enough then it be true, Draco was going to have to disappoint.
Should he open it here? In front of them? “Was it my fault?” The question was a strange one. “That you two don’t talk any more.” Neville snorted behind him, Draco scowled and shoved the letter into his robe pocket. Best distract the boy.
Three routes of play reared its head. One: Draco could leave and in time reveal to Potter he knew or use it against him. Not the best manner to deal with this kind of lie. Once Draco revealed he knew, then Potter had no reason to speak the truth and ultimately could deny everything and Draco wouldn’t find out why. Why in Merlin’s name was Harry Potter keen to stay in the Malfoy Manor? Did he not trust Draco with so many Dark Artefacts? Or was this more Gryffindor bullshit to try and protect Draco from another attack?
“The sink’s a little small, yeah?” Small was an understatement, the sink itself was toty for a full grown owl of his breeding. An unfurled wing wouldn’t even fit inside it. Never mind asking Draco to try and roll around in the blasted thing. Potter nudged him to take a perch on the bath-side and watch as it was filled with an inch or so of cool water.
“Maybe I’ll leave this to the Ministry.” Blaise dropped his arm and looked triumphant. Draco leaned forward and whispered, “One.”
Draco wasn’t counting it as convenient that when Harry did show up it was with Albus and Scorpius by his side. The three were ready for what seemed like a fight wands already drawn.
Emotion fluttered inside him, knowing Scorpius had figured it all out. He hooted twice. The boy might have involved Potter but it was a Malfoy motto that family was first in all things. Scorpius wouldn’t say a word because now he knew Draco was safe.
“Where’s the other two?” Draco hadn’t seen much of them but surely it meant only good – Scorpius and Albus had taken the advice to leave, unharmed. Harry began calling on Albus and Scorpius to reappear. Wherever they were hidden before couldn’t have been too far away as they apparated back. Draco nearly died at the sight of his son popping back and honing on the sight of blood on his clothing.
“I didn’t know,” she mumbled and Draco found it terribly uncomfortable to watch her lower her head. She stuttered for once in her life. “I didn’t know how far they were willing to go.”
So, what now? Once Harry was able to move around without aid Draco had appointments now? With Harry? To two places that were explicitly on his no go list. They might end worse than the first time he’d shown his face. Harry was being odd. Really, really, really odd. Perhaps a side effect from the pain potions? For one, he hadn’t shifted from his awkward position neither did he complain about Draco having to lean almost over him for access to the the third cauldron, or the occasional shoulder bump.
“You shouldn’t be so quick to jump in front of me,” Scorpius said as he sat and Draco uncorked some of the weaker wine.
He didn’t. One minute then two and Draco could say Harry probably could tell exactly where he was in the room being so close by. Still, Harry didn’t move and Draco didn’t either. He didn’t know what he would say. He didn’t have a plan, no idea or reason why he was urged away from this room and wanted into - and Draco couldn’t say he even wanted into Harry’s room specifically.
Potter was on the couch, palm of his hands in his eyes. “I’m going to lose everything.”
Was Potter having a laugh?
All of it happened just a bit too fast and Draco couldn’t stop much of anything.
“And Blaise? Still a wildcard?”
And then out of instinct, he raised his wand and readied a hex. But he hesitated. “Blaise?” He squinted, the headache was turning fast into a migraine.
But as Hermione stared him down, hands on hips and puffed hair following her stance, he knew she was not a friend. Hermione was a contact. Potter might side with him, the bloody stars might align and Potter might not consider him hiding his form a big deal. Even if right now as Potter’s magic was strangling him, it was Hermione that was pissed. It was her rules he was ignoring, her position would come under fire if this became well-known.
Albus might as well have become moss on the carpet for how he slouched so low, “I’m really sorry. I just--”
Beauxbatons, then. The near flirting made sense now - never too obvious and never a complete rejection. Everyone knew sending a daughter to Beauxbatons meant to make her a lady of distinguished reputation. In the same vein, Krumstrang made their men rough and belligerent, the ladies from the French school were
Well. Well, then. He just-- what did he say to something like that? “I fail to understand your marriage.”
Maybe something did show on his face because Harry paused. “What is it?”
If condescending could thicken in the air, Draco would lay unconscious at Neville’s feet.
“More of a cat person myself. Sulk all you want but growing a bone is simple. You’ve had to regrow muscle, nerves, tendons, ligaments - everything the leech cut. Why you think that would be painless, I have no idea.” A tut followed which reminded Draco of the times he disappointed his mother in a small way.
“You harassed my Aurors.” Draco cooed under that compliment. Why yes, yes he did. Folding his arms didn’t help Harry’s attempt as the scolding minder as he failed to wipe that smile from his face. “You look real pleased with yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was her.
“Suppose potions it is then.” With great effort Harry got back up on his feet as if he’d been asked to run around the Great Lake and wouldn’t last a step.
If she was upset with Harry showing her a room – a human sized room – she didn’t show it. But if Lotty ended up curled up in the corner with a few pillows he told Harry not to scold her, she wasn’t great at taking what she needed.
“Lotty was taken by surprise, Lotty didn’t see who did it. Lotty is sorry.” Tugging at her ears, Draco sighed as she hadn’t answered the question.
“I told him, then if he was so disgusted with Malfoys I’d make it easy for him. James laughed, said ‘good about time’ and you know what Albus did?” Whatever it was, was too unbelievable for Scorpius to say immediately after he played with his food, biting his lip and looking miserable, he continued, “Said, ‘ok’, like everything, everything we’ve had to deal with in Hogwarts meant nothing.”
“I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive myself for raising my wand against you.” All it did was make him more and more guilty, heavy and sticky tar sitting in his throat. He should have done his job and never allowed the situation to escalate.
“What?”
“See?”
Upon reaching the bed, Decimus stirred, gave Harry a look before Draco motioned for it to drop off the bed. The crup lay on the floor, not eager to leave and not pleased to be demoted. Harry practically slithered, in a manner quite Slytherin, back into bed and he murmured again.
“Favourite, really.” Scorpius piped up and the boy was quick – much quicker than Draco thought to account him. They left her scowling in petty defeat, Draco’s win no less petty. Most people knew Longbottom not as the one to kill a snake with the sword of bloody Gryffindor but a man with green-thumbs and constantly growing list of references which used him in their herbology books. Maybe he really should contact Longbottom for supplies?
Harry was slow to move, and while Draco was cautious over the new health issues he wasn't too worried. No, this was quite normal – these flushes and flares of heat and magic, his potion hadn't just become obsolete, Potter's body was practically considering it poison.
At some point, Draco slept, for how long he wasn’t sure. When he awoke, it was with a jolt - the book he last read lay haphazardly on the ground. Harry grumbled under his breath. His face was flushed now, and if Draco had not ordered Lotty to stay beside Siobhan, both now absent from the room, he would have thought Lotty had failed to wring the damp cloth and soaked the pillow.
“Why did I ever consider you enough? Leave, just leave.”
Draco was never one who liked too much responsibility, unless it somehow benefited him in some round about way. Having a child had settled most of his hubris by the door – that happens when vomit made it in hair – but not all. Best do everything he could because it wasn’t as if there was a line of people waiting to help him.
“As if. I know you have this
“What can I say? I’m ambitious.” She half-shrugged. “A clinic of my own is what I want. I could have an entire ward of people rushing around to Harry Potter’s every whim. I certainly don’t need to be doing all this… trainee cleaning.” Her nose scrunched and Draco wondered how long she’d been resentful at casting cleaning spells. “I don’t just want your Galleons, Mr. Malfoy. These too. I could give a list of patients who need someone… decent at brewing a potion or too, not that they’d take a potion from a Malfoy. I’d happily mediate, for a fee.” She smiled, not unpretty in the least and Draco froze at the sound of her voice, “It could benefit us both quite well.”
“Not a word, yeah, yeah.” Despite assurances, Draco was unsettled at the smile. Were the Muggle classes that bad? Or was this simply because Neville knew he held the upper hand here? Or was watching him alongside Muggles really so amusing? Huffing to himself, Draco returned to the Leaky, cloak once forgotten and apparated home.
I really dislike the whole romantizing mental illness/trauma and stuff so, yeah, they were both gonna go their separate ways for their own health. Draco needed a proper friend, Harry needed someone who would hold him accountable. Which is one of the reasons I didn't want to end an update on them breaking up? In case it got super frustrating and someone might think I was just keeping it going etc.
Door closed tight and magic against him, Draco turned back human.
Draco didn’t consider himself an emotional sort (both Pansy and Blaise had oddly laughed at that admission back in the day).  Even if the soggy patches on Harry’s shirt said otherwise, Draco would still say it. He didn’t do crying. Complaining, ranting certainly but in this moment? How he was supposed to argue he was fine when his sentences would be punctuated with sniffling and blinking bloodshot eyes. Draco could sleep for several summers right about now.
Some might be truth. Some.
This was too much, too intimate despite being fully clothed and sitting intertwined. Intimate in the fashion of being comfortable in the nooks and crannies of another person - like how Harry’s hair tickled at Draco’s temple or how Draco could feel how Harry’s muscles shifted as he squirmed closer, comfier, warmer.
Low-key panicking I'll delete one or publish the wrong one in the wrong order or something. :d
“He’s okay, so far.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Indirect-kiss thing?” Ron squinted his eyes and suddenly, Draco found himself furious. What?
Thank you for reading!
He wrote the first and Blaise accepted it without hesitation. And on the fifth, Blaise scolded him for not being neat enough. And the tenth, Blaise started to rant to Theo – confused as he too could see the parchment were near copies of each other – how Draco was trying to make a fool of him.
“So, you forgive me.” James nodded to himself, like this was all going according to plan. The absolute fucking idiot.
“Doesn’t make it any easier.”
“And remind the brat he can stay holed up here, I wasn’t speaking sentiment!” Draco called after him, on route to sign the R.S.P.V.
“No, guess I’ve been lucky.”
“I can buy a dozen mouthpieces, the problem is so can everyone else.” He shrugged the hand from his arm and glared. How could he have been so stupid to think this would end well. Harry Potter, centre of attention no matter what. No matter what Draco was always the bad guy.
He scoffed. “Cutest, Harry. Keep up.”
And they would whisper, like the blue did to him and Scorpius to wear it. From the notes he’d read and research conducted anyone without Malfoy blood simply was beckoned to wear and ask - because it would give them the truth, one they desperately wanted. And infatuation was a greedy thing that wanted everything, every little secret and still it would never be enough. Draco blinked at the idea, Harry might become worse if influenced.
He picked her up, careful despite her flailing little limbs and returned to Harry. Who recognised the beastie immediately.
Wait until Harry commanded him to jump up onto the perch. Now, an owl might not understand what they needed to do as Harry kept the treat hovering just near the wood, but would follow the food regardless. Draco didn’t much like the idea he was following Harry’s every whim. But Potter probably knew that too. Fine. He settled onto it, not letting his eyes off the cut of meat.
Oh the pity. This was a Lockeheart of Potions. All chatter no substance. Why had Albus taken this man as his potionmaster was beyond comprehension. Harry must have interfered. No one decent at potions would ever believe this ‘writing out’ behaviour acceptable during the Optimal Time. Why-- Why even bother?
“When is Scorpius playing?” Draco leaned forward to see the Keepers and Seekers moving off the grounds. How long would this take? How long until someone here noticed him?
If anything, it was the exact opposite.
Right, Potter wasn’t the type to sleep without assistance. Having Potter go back to the Manor on his own wasn’t ideal, what if Moran was lying in wait? Would he be dumb enough to try and attack Harry Potter? Maybe, he’d waltzed into a shop with him inside it after all.
Harry was going to die and it was all his fault. How was he going to explain that to Scorpius and Albus? Luna? Hermione? Anyone?
“You own it?”
Fan, he understood. Girl he understood. Together it seemed off. “I don’t know what that means.” Perhaps something bad with how pinched Harry’s expression became, how he huffed and sighed.
What was that drivel? “You better explain that one, Potter.” That was reaching. Hard. Even Matthews had paused in his note-taking.
“Is he an animagus?” Thankfully, he wasn’t without some defence and Scorpius remained silent, Malfoy-glare in place. “Scorpius.” As if trying to scold him into an answer would help. If anything, the threat of trouble was always a point of contention. Scorpius got worse and more outspoken the longer anyone tried to tell him off. Draco included. He blamed it on the last few years of being in the Quidditch team. Thinking of it, Draco hadn’t managed to scold Scorpius much in his life but neither had Scorpius ever been declamatory.
Pretend everything was fine? He pawed a little at Harry’s ridiculous hair.
“I’m relieved you’re okay, Lotty.” She hid behind her ears, pulling them while making a high-pitched whine. “I don’t want you to think what you did was bad. You did what anyone would have. In fact I’m pretty sure the only reason you heard anything was so whoever did this could have access to the Manor without it alerting me. You were tricked and hurt and I don’t blame you, understand?”
Toddlers, that’s what eighteen year-olds reminded Draco of - they assumed they knew better, they assumed they knew everything they needed to know and huffed when things didn’t go their way. How Potter decided to have more than one child sounded like a recipe for madness. A dose of reality, cruel as it was, was necessary. Albus not unlike his father had inspired a great deal of loyalty in those he called friends. Scorpius held him dearly, and it was the only path open to Draco to force the issue.
“So, he’s warning you about someone who might steal these rings. But why not just say a name? He seems to know exactly who it is.”
No more Potter. None. Depottered. Undone. Forgotten.
Draco considered what Blaise might have told Harry. He most certainly did not tell Harry about his curse-breaking side-business, “Hardly, he supplies me potions. Nothing else.”
Without missing a beat Albus answered, “No one who’ll beat Scorpius.” And it brought a relieved smile to Draco’s face. At least he didn’t need to worry about these two any more. Draco would give his son anything. However friendship wasn’t something he could ever buy or bribe in Scorpius’ stead.
“Right. I knew that.”
“Oh, sorry I--” Harry grabbed inside the bag and froze as Draco nipped the cut of meat from his palm, ignoring the guilt rushing over Harry’s face in red hives. “Draco?”
“Mr. Potter, I believe today is your day off.“ She stood outside as if daring to come into the office of one Harry Potter was offensive. Ha, Draco rolled his head to the side and wished he could scoff. The Ministry gave the impression they wanted Potter here twenty-four seven. A few years after the war and all the Daily Prophet had ran was story after story of Potter and Weasley and their successful capture of Dark Wizards and Witches. Justice got dull by the ninth issue.
. One Weasley was enough. Now, Draco was expecting to open up wounds Ginny probably wouldn’t want to share. Perhaps, Harry would have owled her and softened the blow, stopped it being about Ginny’s secrets and more about trying to find a solution to Harry’s.
“Collins he won’t bite.” Draco heard the warning in Harry’s voice despite the smile.
A swirl of brilliant blue caught Draco’s eye and he stared as it whispered in his head:
“Luna did say that its eyes were weird, wrong even.”
“Break this and cure me.” Draco revealed his problem and Blaise leaned forward. His hands were far too cold. Twisting his arm around, Blaise kept a cool expression as he read each. Blaise wasn’t the greatest cure-breaker out there but he was discrete and money motivated. A hobby turned freelance and all the more for Draco to count on him. No one in the Ministry would stay awake at the crux of discovering how to remove this. Blaise was an obsessive fellow, a details man.
“Albus. Is Scorpius with you, I need a word.”
“Wait a second.” Wilks grabbed his upper arm and for once, the blasé act dropped. “I’m not exactly being subtle here. I deserve a chance.” If the Fates enjoyed Draco’s misfortune, they loved adding more and more problems onto the heap. The bell over the apothecary rang.
He laughed, relieved for a distraction.
I do love misunderstandings so long as the don't veer into Big Misunderstanding territory where no one talks to each other. Y'know the, "I saw him with a girl (who's a relative), whaa, why must he cheat?!"
Luna was held high, much like Hermione,  because of their capabilities to look passed the past. Before, before everything, Draco would have mocked and refused Hermione when she asked for help, would have laughed at Ron and Harry trying to change the law of Aurors. But these days, accepting a compliment from anyone was easy enough, be it legitimate or not. The war made compliments rarer and Draco found Luna’s opinion mattered, more than anyone else. She was a clear honesty, without a hidden agenda that Draco was so used to these days.
He wasn’t interested. He wasn’t. It didn’t matter what Harry said or did. “What are they talking about?”
Was this really a Muggle Thing? He had heard some Muggles push on someone’s chest to keep them breathing and heart beating - that didn’t really work, did it? - and this sounded just as useless. What did he have to lose? A sigh, trying to sound irritated and demure of this whole affair, Draco turned back around. Harry wasn’t going to throttle him at least.
He was younger than he was expecting. Or maybe looks were deceiving with such long hair. But his handshake was strong – not overbearing or flimsy and weak – and he didn’t seem to care it was Draco Malfoy in his practise. Not at all.
Was he fucking kidding?
I did keep writing over the holidays but I wasn't entirely sure I liked what I was writing (whether I was just stressing at the arbitrary time limit or what I don't know) so I held this big boy chapter back and reread it and tweaked it until I felt it wasn't so bLaH and kept writing other scenes. Then my friend blew up my phone and I oops that I forgot about actually uploading the fecker and it's already January. Time is scary.
“It’s over,” Harry said, face now blank.
And Draco kept his lip firmly between his teeth because when a section of tension practically disappeared after months of being there, so obviously being there and being a pain, it was the only way to stop it. Stop whatever noise was stuck in his throat and Draco was not making, never ever.
“Don’t be stupid. Do you seriously think I won’t come out there?” Draco called him a series of names, none which came out as anything but a long drawn out cry. Potter would absolutely jump out of a bloody window to save an ordinary owl, never mind Draco as an animagus. He hopped down to the windowsill, not so gracefully now his feathers were muddled and weighing him down like a thousand tiny chains.
"What's wrong?"
“No.” Draco hid under the covers, the darkness calming and quiet. The bed shifted under Harry’s weight and Draco peeked out of his makeshift cocoon as Harry sat the empty vial down on the floor.
Oh. Just Albus. Draco put away the watch.
“Don’t proposition him,” Harry snapped.
The fact that Harry was saying this and all they were standing in was a red-bricked alleyway, with soggy newspaper stuck to the tarmac and the smell of foul, wet rubbish, well, Draco wasn’t keen to agree.
Malfoy Manor had only ever told him about one forced entry inside. It hadn’t dared interrupt to say Scorpius was home. The glass was removed with a flick and few words and the real ring, shining and gleaming and Draco looked away from it.
“No, no they were all okay. Ron. Ron helped keep them safe.”
“No, after all, what does it mean if I tried and can’t summon one?”
He span around, seemed to pinpoint where he was with such ease… Was this real? Was Harry playing?
“Some variation of I told you so, hurry it up. I don’t think I could deal with you acting like this all day.”
Muggle in origin going by that tail their inventions had so often and it wasn’t a box, though it was rectangle. Muggle’s Third Favourite Shape only second to the Circle.
Blaise pulled out his wand to cast a shield or a counter-hex but the jinx knocked it from his hand. Swelling fast, with painful blotches made Blaise yelp and hiss as it bloated in size. He cradled his hand and Draco was satisfied. The sight gave Draco a rush, not many people got under his skin and less likely were the people Draco could retaliate against without qualm. Draco made sure to keep his on target, Blaise was known to fake injury if it helped in the long run.
Wrek didn’t think it safe to talk in his own store. Moran wasn’t so powerful or connected, his father had used up a fair amount of both keeping out of the war. Paranoia threatened to set in as the dark cobblestone turned smoother and brighter as he made his way between the busier, more common streets.
“I’ll leave you to your books. I should go feed the crup, it eats more than I expected.”
“Is that how you see me?” Strange. Emotions were strange and difficult for Harry’s words didn’t hurt. No lashing of the heart or flinch at how he came across towards others. What Draco did feel was clued-in to everyone else, whose gaze met his eye but never for very long and swept over and dismissed him at every step.  “Not as a Death Eater but someone who’ll laugh at others’ misfortunes because I’m not fit for much else?”
Draco glanced back to the door. He’d said he wouldn’t command the crup, wouldn’t push for it to imprint on him. He waved the beast over to get a better look at it but it didn’t move. Another look back before Draco moved slowly to sit in front of the chair. He wasn’t brave or stupid but an opportunist and this was one he was happy to gamble on.
“I’d have married you if you hadn’t pulled the arrangement for Astoria.” She tucked some hair behind her ear.
What would happen if Hermione caught the two of them – an urge to snog Potter resurfaced at the idea – he was never one for public displays. Replaying in his head the image of him marching over and grabbing at Harry—it was never going to happen and yet. He’d very much like to greet him like that just for a reaction. Hiding away his thoughts from anyone who wished to fish for them, Draco stared down the spines of books, squashed tight and forced onto the shelves.
“Well, if I have to see those at the door I need someone else to sacrifice the stares to.” Siobhan didn’t appreciate the joke but relaxed once she realised it wasn’t true.
But one spell, maybe, was all Draco had in him. If he beckoned the Healer’s supplies and there was nothing that could help him he was dead unless Blaise returned with someone who could heal competently.
The smile was unexpected considering he’d refused the kid any leeway from the hiccup with Scorpius. No one else was here. Harry marched away, rubbing at his hand. And Draco refused to look his own. It didn’t feel so cold any more.
“Was hiding under the chair,” Draco whispered back not wanting to go just yet but knowing the time was approaching. He really would have to leave this one here. Harry sat next to him - he tried to give it a pet but it moved away to sit at Draco’s other side and rested its head on his knee.
His nostrils flared like a spooked horse and he snapped, “You’re a git, how hard’s it to say you had a good time out?”
True to his word a few days after, an owl appeared, a little dark-speckled one with amber eyes and a hoot that sounded more like an insult than a greeting.
But he was still hesitant to speak, just in case. Where was his wand again?
“This wasn’t here before...” Draco heard Harry’s words and hooted a swear. He should have known it was taking too long for his wing to heal. A curse, one set off when an animagus tried to transform back. The end result? Draco had no idea.
“I have to ask you to sign this,” she slipped over a long document. His stomach dropped and he shifted at the sheer outspoken gall she had to do this. He wanted turn and run.
Draco’s words only managed to make Scorpius falter more but not leave – a dangerous combination and one he had to blame on the ring and its manipulating as it wormed its way into his head.
Draco followed till they reached the stairs and Harry descended them alone. He couldn’t believe this. How could the Manor not alert him to harm done to Lotty? (She wasn’t in the wards). Damn it. He bit his lip, he was used to the Manor and Lotty herself warning him of issues. Having Lotty being hurt by someone who might have killed Moran was--
Well, it would seem his mother had some explaining to do. Why was Rose here too? What was going on? The last Draco remembered was the nape of his neck tingling.
“Glad to see you haven’t been cursed and hexed to pieces. Was worried there for a minute.” Blaise snorted, crossed his arms and said, “I mean, should I be worried? You leaving the Manor and your potions on stasis? What’s going on? There a sale for griffin guts on or something?”
“What?” That did terrible, awful fluttery things to him and Draco looked away.
“You know you’re blushing, right?”
“You say that Neville but it’s a fine line,” Draco spoke over his pint and glared. He sipped at it, not allowing Neville to speak. Why was it so warm in here?
The beetle jumped from Harry’s hand and morphed and twisted as it fell. Rita was older, her hair grey and her glasses thicker. Though, her lipstick still was a vibrant red and Draco spied the notepad and auto-quill. Those, he’d need to rid her of those. Thankfully, the department couldn’t be held responsible for an owl’s actions.
Draco stared at the thermometer, still within an acceptable heat range. “You left?”
“It worked.” Hermione’s shock removed all admiration she’d built up over today.
His life would be so much easier if—he wouldn’t hurt this much if- “I wish I’d never met you.” The words washed over them in the bitter air. All except Harry who barely blinked. Draco turned away, his stomach grumbling painfully and shoved Neville away. He promptly vomited. He hoped he got Potter’s shoes. Neville pulled him back, spell cast before Draco had even as sense at what it was.
“We have this beautiful Australian Masked Owl--”
The muddled groan, pulling away and Draco turned desperate. He wasn’t stopping this now, was he? But Harry, “Wait-- Wait.”
As if Harry had been waiting on the question he squirmed, not out of discomfort but settling himself into a snug position to speak. “Just a few traps to catch anyone who thinks themselves smart. It’s well, been bugging me. How Moran just charged into the shop to kill you. Why not wait till later? Out of all the days to attack, he picks the exact timing two Aurors are inside?”
“If I was so valuable why did you keep trying to kill me?”
Ruffling Harry’s hair, he stayed silent. Sometimes, and there were many times these past few years alone, Draco wanted words to cease existing. Make it impossible to think. He’d have to interact and how draining it really was when all he wanted to do was lay in the dark and have it swallow him.
He was calm in giving the crup a pet on the head, a few stokes over its ears and Draco wasn’t sure how he was supposed to stop and tell the brown-eyed (cute) crup to leave. Ever. Absent-mindedly he checked what Harry had handed to him in more detail.
Probably knew a lot of spells Harry knew too. Hmm.
“I assure you, I am more than capable.” Scorpius snorted behind him and Draco tried to move passed the young man. He just followed suit and continued to stay in the way. Who would worry if Draco left too soon?
Wait.
“It’s Nott’s, it’ll bite if you don’t feed her first.”
He hadn’t been this concerned over his personal appearance in a long time. The last he’d been near obsessive when he’d started dating Astoria, wanting her to like him as much as he did her. But looking good - an easier task for a Malfoy, certainly - would ingratiate himself to some. And now, as Draco made sure the entire ensemble was straight lines with no creases, no lint and certainly nothing cheap looking - he sighed in the mirror. Nerves were starting to eat his common sense. At least Hermione and Ginny would be here before the guests, making sure they could cover up if Harry went missing mid-party.
Draco slumped forward, his hands on his thighs as he sighed in such crushing relief. Definitely, undeniably, he was going to vomit. Not seeing to Lotty or Harry, Draco went to the nearest bathroom and wasn’t sure if he felt better. The tremble in his hands or burn in his throat didn’t say he did.
“Stay,” Draco said and Harry did. A calming stroke on his back as Draco nuzzled into Harry – always warm and trustworthy – he relaxed and he slept.
A madman was what he was. Mad as a bag of weasels! The spinning of the room shunted his balance violently with each step and Draco shut his eyes, the vertigo too much to deal with along with a wing that might just fall off. Or be pecked off because right now, it was the pain-free path.
“You’re a Death Eater, how many people are going to give you the time of day?” Maybe Wilks thought himself a gentleman because he was whispering it in his ear, so Harry couldn’t hear it.
“And I’m pretty sure Puddlemere has the worst Keeper I’ve ever seen in the league.”
“You could sit over here. Or’d you think I’mma do something.”
“And Luna is Luna to me.” He watched as she left the shop and he wanted Harry to leave so he could ask how well received his gift was. The urge to swoop her up and thank her was both overwhelming and promptly murdered. He couldn’t look too giddy over things going his way, that would raise some questions.
Blaise held it out and Draco gave a scolding look to Potter. “Don’t touch anything.” He left the station and skimmed the first page.
Draco was quiet as he watched everyone relax as Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World left. Potter didn't acknowledge a single person on his way to the Floos and no one regarded this with any ire. But Draco noticed the way Potter’s magic flared just as he got to the fireplace and how a witch ahead of the queue flinched.
“But we wouldn’t be giving them magic.”
It was easier to have a conversation there, between the bookshelves than out here in the open, rows of tables and chairs and a few people doing the same: reading or looking as if they’d set fire to their parchment.
“Want to go back to sleep?” Draco whispered back not entirely sure if he should allow it. Harry’s answer was a hum. He glanced at Harry’s shoes, still worn and really they seemed older than Draco and Harry combined. This was a man who was worth more than Draco was - maybe even twice over - and he still wore these awful scuffed shoes. Probably best remove them. “Lot--” Right. Not here. He was quick in casting a few spells to remove them and to pull the cover a little higher. The nights could be cold in the Manor not just because of the weather but Muggle plumbing might be a fixture but their heating was much more intrusive and not added.
“Does your Healer know about this?”
Since both are now more aware of their baggage (not specifics) they can start having some funz now they know there's some boundaries. >:3 Awkward cutsey date activate! Cue slightly miffed/jealous Draco too.
“I’m sure he does.” The old fart didn’t shift from her slouch over the counter and Draco bristled. Sure, let everyone see him in his bloody pyjamas, freezing and arguing for one bloody seed that didn’t cost more than a pound of rat guts.
Harry made a noise, possibly of a man dying of embarrassment as the towels continued to pile up. When Harry popped his head out of the mountain of feverishly found towels, Draco laughed in his own linen-made avalanche. Laughed so hard he knew his human part would return because he couldn’t keep up with trying to breathe and laugh and try to focus on staying an owl. He turned back, soaked to the bone and teeth chattering and a trembling laughter, giddy and the only thing which was warming him. The very sight Harry Potter was buried under his own outlandish worries tickled.
“You need to sign this, without looking.”
But he really did want crup. Another look at the Prophet showed the little thing wagging its tail and Draco needed to think and talk about something else. He threw the Prophet to the floor, the distraction gone and the work back in front of him.
He’d need to keep on top of this and in that vein, Draco bid his son an early night leaving his son to finish the wine before Draco took the choice out of their hands.
“Help me up?” Neville held out his hand all the same. A stare without a glare. Neville really was-- He really wasn’t planning anything. Draco expected a hex back.
Never stopping, never checking on how Harry was taking these little revelations, Draco kept talking. Telling the truth was much easier when Draco couldn’t see the consequences of it, couldn’t see Harry’s face morph into how he was feeling about said truths. No, it was easier to admit secrets away from those ridiculous green eyes of his. Draco told him everything. Well as much as he could put into words and somehow compliment him because – he was sure – that was what Potter had secretly wanted. Acknowledgement and affection without the gushing selfish manner of a fanatic that knew nothing but factoids from a paper.
“Doesn’t he already know?” Harry didn’t sound remotely bothered, didn’t so much as open his eyes. Maybe he was answering in his sleep?
“No. That’s why I brought her--” His mother twitched, and Draco wondered if she was annoyed not to be announced by her name. “She can see it, she can read it so you don’t have to worry.”
“Never been married.” Dusting off the larger debris, Blaise sat down on the space beside him.
Neville tried to explain why, Draco would stay pessimistic to the idea - no one would be able to hit him. A bee? Why would anyone think that was cool? Even Draco’s owl form was much, much cooler – and being honest – elegant than a silly bee.
“Draco?” Harry didn’t sound convinced but unlike the other attempts, gave a tentative pet Draco on the back of his head.
“It ends when someone tries to get into the Manor. Or you annoy me enough.” Draco finished the last of his tea. “Or someone annoys me enough.” He disliked the idea anyone would chat to him out there, in the world, but hanging around with Potter might embolden some.
“Thanks.”
Ginny looked guilty and again, Draco was proved wrong in his assumptions over her behaviour as she sipped her drink and crossed an arm over her chest. “Keep an eye on him. He lies. A lot. I think we’ve all heard he’s fine more than enough to know he’s not.” Her bitterness was overshadowed by a strange morph of hurt and resentment. Draco wondered how far gone Harry was to lie so often - was he lying? Was Harry lying over his flirtations too? Was this because Draco was in charge of his potions now? How serious was he?
Draco had far too much fun yelling at the Aurors who tried to enter Harry’s office. Especially the ones who did so when Harry had been pulled out by a memo from Hermione. As much as Harry had left, curtains and blinds drawn, door locked and Aurors told not to step foot inside, they still did.  They flinched, they jumped back, they eyed him like he was a dragon. It was great fun. Much better than shuffling about in the Manor.
The sound of several doors closing told him it was from the ballroom.
Now, owls might have the ability to track down whoever but to have it come here wasn’t the most convenient. Not if someone witnessed the owl fluttered into seemingly decrepit building. Someone’s curiosity might cost Harry his hideaway. The bird was unimpressed, eager only to eat the cut of meat Harry had retrieved for it.
Really, he only kept this place here for Scorpius since he hadn’t a negative memory of the place and it would be his one day. To do as he pleased and if he so pleased to burn it down and start anew, Draco would rejoice.
He was quick to locate it but he made a decision to spell the memories of Astoria to the inner Vaults, they didn’t need to be so need to be so close to him these days. As he pocketed the vial of the memory, he wandered back to the Floo to make sure Scorpius hadn’t decided to ignore his warnings and slipped away from his grandmother.
They joked, reluctant to stay on heartfelt topics for too long. Neither of them had it easy but dragging it back up wasn’t helpful. Draco went through a series of what ifs – Collins would have a heart attack clearly – and Harry giggled alongside him at the idea of the Prophet knowing. Impossible as it was – Draco wouldn’t be able to deal with people, not in the way the uniform required – it was funny to imagine.
Next was the man whose name escaped Draco’s grasp. All he knew he was on the list for Magical Creature Protection and the list for Profits Potion Dispensary. An interesting life, really. How could someone who thought dragons shouldn’t have their scales taken, pixies wings unplucked think about protecting said Magical Creatures while also in the group that was listed as possible blackmarket? A hypocrite at worst, a liar at best. Draco chatted about his lab and the Liar chatted about his. Luring out the information was easy enough, as this one wanted everyone to know how much of an undiscovered prodigy he was.
for weeks. The man complicated everything he touched.  “I’ll be sure to remind him this is time sensitive.” She scratched her forehead with the back of her wet hand, as she kept an eye on the paper.
“You’re off your trolly.” He shook his head like an actual teacher would, disappointment coming off in waves. “Smashed. Legless. Wait here, sober up a bit. I’m going to call Harry.” Harry wasn’t his caretaker, not his keeper. Why bother? Why even think to call Potter when he couldn’t even go talk to someone on his behalf? As if he’d even come find him.
Potter really thought he just had to save everyone the Gryffindor sap.
“I thought you were jealous, but you weren’t were you?” Draco tried not to goad him but his arrogant lilt wasn't so easy to avoid. Some habits were more difficult to break. “Not even when you heard I complimented Neville. Isn’t that interesting?”
Completely refused.
“Is there a reason my door’s open?”
Muggle classes too had them all standing around and waiting for the instructor to finally start their lesson.
“You’ve done a good thing, a bloody good thing.” A much older wizard clapped him on his shoulder and he and Hermione shared a bewildered look. What was this all about? Hermione excused herself as the crowds thinned and Ron waved her over, frowning and giving Draco an uncomfortable nod of acknowledgement. He wasn’t sure why he was being thanked so soon by so many people but he eyed Harry from over the crowds that were gravitating towards the exit. Once his duties ended he went to see what Harry had to say for himself.
Circe, if Potter so much as believed for a second Draco should be let go because he asked nicely then he was dumber than Blaise trying to keep his own sanity. The issue Harry considered it, argument with himself clear on his face.
Draco didn’t understand at all. Why would someone wait till now? Voting rules were clear, he couldn’t rescind his choice, he couldn’t change it once he’d written it. But as everyone plodded in, not at all fired up over this, Draco glanced over to Potter who was trying his best to observe as many people as possible.
Letter came and went. Whatever the Prophet wanted, Draco didn’t read much past the passive-aggressive nature of its accusations and set them alight. Why he would ever willingly agree to an interview, he’d never know. Daphne had sent one, a quick check-in, no doubt from Scorpius’ fretting over his health and he wrote back a short – much shorter than normal, and unsigned at that – reply. She would know something was wrong.
And the months bled into one another. Harry did not appear again at his his doorstep. The Yule ball came and went. Draco refused to hold another party. Theo and Blaise were still out there. Maybe. Draco had never heard anything from the Aurors. Harry had taken his word: He hadn’t shown himself again.
Decimus jumped up onto the couch and started to dig into the cushions. “You. Calm it.” The crup turned to give him such an accusing look. The beast threw itself down, nuzzling into the very seams of the furniture as if trying to hide its muzzle between the cushions. Tails wagging and hitting Draco on the thigh, he tried to ignore the time and petted the pet. Decimus agreed this was the best plan and nearly ended up on Draco’s lap again.
Albus hadn’t just hurt Scorpius, he’d betrayed him. Somehow. Draco wondered what Albus would say to Harry, what kind of advice he was expecting back. Harry would probably want them to patch things up, ignore whatever made Scorpius cry. That wasn’t something Draco could do, ever.
“...Do you have any plans for today?”
Decimus whined. Draco apparated away. The problem which Draco hadn’t considered was Britain wasn’t the warmest or driest of countries and so when Draco landed in the last field to the east he noticed how the grass underneath his feet was waterlogged.
“The meeting overran and the minutes weren’t even the slightest bit accurate.” Hermione didn’t seem at all phased by his presence and took the last butterbeer from the centre of the table.  She seemed to have some power of presence as the chairs were eager to move. One tried to flee to the bar itself and was stunned by the mean looking bartender back into place.
“You better not die.” Draco doodled on the corner of number seven’s recipe. “Luna will kill me.” The doodle was given a violent scrub through before Draco set about the batch of potions. Each were boiling, some the same purple tint others turning more grey and number three was bright pink. Smelling the air stung his lungs, his eyes were as if mint was sprayed into them and it had nothing to do with Lotty reappearing, her simple blouse was damp around her shoulder, blood splattered near her face and Draco didn’t let her speak.
He ordered the drinks and waited. Waited and hoped the tingle on his face would leave. “You alright there?” Harry said close in his ear, the Leaky now jumping - the furniture occasionally trying to make a leg for it out the door. Too many conversations made the Leaky sound like a droning Ministry office. They could talk and Draco doubted anyone would be able to make out the conversation. No wonder they’d met so early, else they’d never have found a place big enough for all of them to sit and drink.
Stone against stone, grinding harsh and loud that startled the guests below. The floor quivered and lurched, Harry grabbed onto Draco’s arm as the balcony morphed beneath their very feet, thick side railings raising higher and impassable. Unbelievable. The double-doors, once white and its panels of pretty glass vanished and left them alone, isolated. A box with no roof. No sightseeing guests.
“I’m buying it for him. So we have to see them.” Draco’s eyes went to the ground and he hated it. Hated how he knew what was coming and he wanted to interrupt to say Harry was here by his means. Harry was kidding, he would laugh and the receptionist wouldn’t do what everyone else did.
“James. Enough.” Harry sighed and Draco was all too familiar with the look of a parent struggling to understand why his son was behaving like this.
“Not interested? Good. Stay out of my business.”
“That’s--” More than double the price of every street-seller, apothecary and potion apprentices skimming from their master's supplies combined, “Fine. Malfoy’s aren’t a Sickle family.” As his money clattered onto the counter, rotten and eaten by woodworms, Werk grabbed at his arm. Pulled him to the side and for a second, Draco considered himself dead, caught and stupid. But the fingers, nails which needed cut and cleaned, dug into his arm in a grip that made Draco wonder if he would even be able to cast a spell in time if he were to reach for his wand.
“I can spare a few Galleons for some,” Draco said, repeating what might as well be a mantra for whenever Scorpius ever entered a new shop or wrote to him in Hogwarts.
“Night,” Harry whispered back and Draco left Harry there not knowing if he was rejected or not.
A few details escaped him and Draco stilled at the memory. Antlers.
Draco took a breath to calm down. Scorpius wasn’t dead, he wasn’t targeted by Moran. This boy would be the death of him.
“I’m just here to get the paperwork for this,” said Harry, motioning towards Draco as if he was a suspect. Cheers, just blame the owl, what an arse. Draco wasn't sure how often live specimens were added to the 'evidence' locker but if Potter could hurry up and hide him away, he wasn't going to complain about morality. If he did manage to transform back, he would need a reasonable explanation on why he, Draco Malfoy was coming out of a locker. That might be trickier to explain away considering most Aurors loathed his presence.
“They aren’t going after Muggles,” Draco supplied him with the only truth he could give.
“Your suggestion is to hide away from the world? Until someone finds us?” A naive idea. But a nice one to imagine, to be hidden away from everyone and everything, from his past and all it brought to him. Even back when he and Astoria left the limelight, there were still people snooping. And if Harry was just going to disappear, Hermione and Ron would eventually ask and then pry if those answers weren’t enough. Someone would notice. No one could leave Potter be for long.
So, as Draco let the letter go, he peered at the half-written letter that Goyle worked on. It was the same as Luna’s, Old Wounds and asking for alliance. Another, a seal of Theodore Nott, his signature at the bottom, that letter read:
“Harry. This is--” By hand? Really?
“Luna.” A squeak, a plea between teeth. A groan as Draco whispered to Luna about what on earth she was talking about. She didn’t tell. Draco didn’t think she would.
Pop, pop, and Draco turned around to see if his fate lay with Longbottom or Weasley.
Harry didn’t go and the day ended. Harry still didn’t go.
He was an owl. The magic did not respond on his third or fourth attempt. His fifth or sixth and Draco wondered how he couldn’t see how coincidentally the fools had opened fire only after Draco flung himself out of a window.
How often had he done that?
Harry just watched by the door and Hermione beckoned Fornax over as she offered a hand. In the spirit of things, Draco furled his wings and waddled over keen to keep the peace between them. Not his usual role (Hermione was the peace-keeper, the scolder and setter of boundaries, all of which Draco was grateful for: Potter couldn’t just say his piece and leave). Potter probably felt similar.
“If you stall for one more second no one will find your body, I promise you that.”
What exactly was he supposed to do with the information Harry might want to get off with him right there and then in a house no one knew existed. Why? How? Draco hadn’t heard Harry being interested in men. Only the names of girls back in Hogwarts made their way through the gossip mills and managed to be overheard by a Slytherin. What was more likely was Harry had mistaken Draco’s care for romantic affection.
“I will, but we’ll pretend I never did.”
He nodded. Notice-Me-Nots stopped most Muggles from paying attention but best they not try their luck on fellow wizarding folk. Wouldn’t that make a headline? ‘Malfoy Dark Wizard Confirmed?’
It was, despite its dangerous nature, the bloody most adorable creature ever. The little ears and their little paws and their wet noses and their--
Who else would do this? This was a Muggle thing - Siobhan would just cast a charm if so inclined and Lotty wouldn’t have dared put such a flimsy garment over him. He sat in the dark for a time, thinking. Harry hadn’t chosen to awaken him, show off his attentive details and show off his affections. Not like all the Wilks and Jasmines of the world, who Draco was used to bragging about how much they could care. But unlike them, Harry only had reputation and credit to lose. Nothing Draco Malfoy had done in recent years ever said Harry would benefit from it.
The very reason Nott's rendezvous hadn't made it into such a scandal as Pansy and Blaise's was simply because it was more than likely he was shagging another man. And who would dare talk about that in mixed company?
Had he fucked up? Really? How badly? Going by how sour his face was made Draco panic a little. This wasn’t a pet peeve, this was a curse Draco had reawakened. Harry sighed, drawn out and glaring at the pages in his hands.
“Y-yeah. Maybe.”
“If you and Blaise are--” Harry the ever courageous Gryffindor lasted all of two seconds meeting Draco's eye.
“Me coming to see Matthews with you,” Harry elaborated.
He was glad his Mother named it because Draco as much as he wanted a crup for a lifetime had never thought of a name – that made the fantasy too real, too easy to realise he’d never have a need for a name because he’d never be allowed one. Best just wish for a few pets, a few rounds of fetch and be done with it.
“That sounds about right.” If the situation not so dire his collected response would’ve made him preen in superiority. Right now, he nodded and stepped over to Harry. Harry who fought to keep his eyes open every second. Four casting trees worth of magic Harry might have lost. A tragedy indeed if true. As Draco tried to keep the magic over the palm of his hand - to focus on one point and only one was harder than it sounded - he refused to touch Harry’s arm but hovered over it. Speaking of which wasn’t scarred from the scale leech. An insignificant mercy.
So, Draco did so. Instead of returning to the Manor, they both slipped back to walk amongst the Muggles. While Draco had his fun and Harry didn't mention his soon to be revenge again.
“Just keeping a promise. Is everything okay?” Really, how he looked around the Manor as if he was waiting on something popping out was silly. Did he think Draco would just have what was potentially stolen with him, on hand for him to see?
“Don’t even think of stealing food. Now, outside you can--” Decimus started to chuff, bounce around like it was the greatest word he’d ever heard. He supposed he should check to see how fast the crup was or rather how eager Decimus would be if he was called. Really how often would Decimus, a non-pureblooded crup be allowed to roam free anyway?
“I said not to drink--” Harry must have seen the non-Manor-ness of this house, of his secret hidden away house. Harry’s words had a nervous edge to them. Whether it was because they were closer again or because Draco was making it very obvious he didn’t appreciate the lie, Harry stumbled over his words. “Oh, you remembered this place? I have to see somewhere a couple of times before I can--” he didn’t, wasn’t allowed to finish such a dull anecdote.
“Want to head to the Leaky? Luna’s free again tonight.”
“That’s me.”
Tilting his head – which reminded him too much like Decimus these days – Harry said, “This is what you look like when you’re deflecting. Or losing at Quidditch.” He kept coming closer and closer. Too close to the writing table and its secrets.
WHY LISTEN; SOUNDS OF WAR OR PEACE, NOTHING BUT THE TUTTI
“No, no, come on,” Harry laughed and pulled at his arm and in a whirl of colour and a pull that started in his belly, Draco was apparated away.
“The robe and cloak off?” Draco rolled his eyes, he hadn’t really thought to remove them when returning. He’d half expected Harry to demand to go somewhere else. He’d mainly been attached to his phone the last few hours. Draco scoffed and sat both to the side. In a manner closely resembling his animagus form, he watched Harry walk around the couch and Draco wasn’t even sure what he was supposed to think.
Muggles were absolutely barmy with their clothing and their entertainment. If something had gone wrong, Draco could have – to the grave with the Act of Secrecy – turned into an owl and saved himself. But them? To go on that willingly? For fun? Barmy, absolutely mental, all of them.
“She’s a little shorter than you.” Draco stared down at the newly bought cloak. Exquisite in terms of taste - Draco’s tastes - but it may very well be the worst cloak Mary ever laid her eyes on. Did she like green? Perhaps a blue would have been better. Draco smoothed the corners of the parcel before turning it over in his hands. Why did people not wrap up items correctly? It was all wrong, all crinkled and ugly.
“Oh, did ‘e now?” He didn’t budge and so Draco, patience worn thin already decided not to take much crap from the man who smelled of owl shit.
“So, Potter, are you going to be a permanent fixture around here or what?”
Draco looked back to the tallest, a hulking and madly intimidating load of paperwork. Harry knew what was there, he’d looked at it. He was scared of it.
His feathers puffed up. Heavens above, someone silencio this man before he says anything else. Speaking with an owl, remember? He tried to say, what if— what if someone overheard that? The fool. He made sure to glare his best, vilest, most intimidating look yet.
He let the beast sniff at the air before it crawled on its belly forward. Draco gave the creature a well-deserved pat on its head once it poked its face out from under its hiding place. The crup wriggled out of its hidey hole and sat up, open mouthed and panting - the goofiest, most ridiculous smile on its face. Now that it was standing proud and pleased, Draco could see it wasn’t just a little bigger than the typical crup. No, this was easily sitting at his hip if he stood up. The fur wasn’t close cut either.
Fuck.
“So, Theo and Blaise.” Draco didn’t expect the flinching at hearing their names, but he did. Grimaced at how Harry sat up to explain himself. “They went to France so, it’s taking some coordination between the different authorities. Theo disappeared, left Blaise behind. We think Theo's next move is to pretend he has nothing to do with this, but considering you've already shown me the--” Harry cleared his throat. “The memory of him trying to warn you - he can't take that route if he tries to go home.”
“First, I’m taking Blaise in--”
“Don’t forget. This was a favour to Albus.” Draco fled, apparated directly to his kitchen, a snivelling Lotty asking for forgiveness for allowing Harry Potter to come into the Manor again.
Harry invaded his space again, and with a delicate touch as if the metal was close to snapping Harry checked it over.
All the windows slammed shut.
“Feeling okay? Why? What’s going to happen?”
“Hush, come along.” Lotty made noises on the way to the Floo as she tried to formulate she wasn’t worthy. Trying to make a point to calm her, explaining it would help with work since she would know exactly which of the Malfoys were in the house.
“Tell me, did you trust your boyfriend--” That sounded so, so… juvenile. Like they were in Hogwarts and worrying over tests. And also wrong. Wrong because Harry hadn’t even messaged him once and surely any sort of boyfriend would have messaged once. It wasn’t as if Harry lacked any means to send one. “Don’t call him that.”
Neville laughed and Draco found himself uncomfortable at the idea he too would laugh about his parents like that when the day came. “More than most gave me. Gotta admit though,” he sighed and sunk into himself. “I was a bit relieved. They weren’t good near the end.”
Was Harry beyond saving? Was he broken, never to be put back together?
“Yes, Sir. Excuse me.” Abbie did not look pleased as she retreated back to a cubicle. No one ever looked happy in the Ministry so a moot point but this atmosphere was closer to working near Umbridge than a celebrity. Harry shut the door, leaving Draco to check to see if Potter was going to start yelling in private.
Albus’ potions were important for now and Draco couldn’t risk it. Decided to check ingredients and cut out the hardened stems and remove the turning mouldy-moss. Following on, an attempt at what this Alice wrote.
“Soon? I’ve been researching since I left.” Blaise seemed tired, his eyes redder than usual. The potion in his hands was not labelled and Draco eyed it more than his friends well being. “Drink this first."
Siobhan returned, two potions in hand and Draco saw how Harry sank back into his chair.
“We haven’t found him yet.” Just Blaise? Just an Oblivated Blaise who might’ve been under an
“Get out, and don’t come back.” It was the glare, the Malfoy Glare, not the sneer or the overconfident banter, Draco saw the contempt and for Scorpius to show it to Albus? Well, he wasn’t sure what was going on but Scorpius, as the Manor still told him, was hurt and Draco was still keyed in to halt that.
“Albus just wants to talk to Scorpius. Let’s not make this bigger than what it is.”
“Home, then.” He remained as passive as he could, pulling Harry’s arm over his shoulder and apparating where he crouched. The destination was the only home Draco knew Harry lived like a wizard of his accolades and prowess. Ginny lived there too and Draco wanted to see how she would react at a defenceless Harry Potter landing on her front step.
“Do either of them know about Fornax?”
Ridiculous? That Harry was as thick as a plank?
“Not really? A bit. Can’t blame him though. I’ll make it up to him one day.” Harry turned to him, determined. “I will.” Draco had the fullest confidence he would. He nodded, dropped to look at how much he had left. Less than half empty. “So, are you still seeing Matthews?”
How was he supposed to feel, knowing what he did now, knowing what Harry had done to Draco’s own neck the previous night? How was he supposed to reconcile these two? Perhaps, no – definitely Harry hadn’t considered them linked until he saw the marks the next morning. It spoke on how his mood had soured and – not a mood – guilt had settled so strongly.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Gulping back a snarky comment Draco looked away. Best not upset him further.
Well, he couldn’t very well apparate out of this place. Wherever it was - though the dreary weather and street signposts hinted they were still in England. For all Draco knew this was a Muggle city a few miles out of the Manor. Inside this curious building - Muggles did like their glass panes and walls - such voyeuristic tendencies, Harry dropped his hand and Draco wasn’t sure why. Until he started to rummage in his pockets.
“Think your shirt’s ruined.” Harry put a finger through it and prodded him. The smile didn’t reach his eyes and Draco couldn’t feel any warmth from those hands. It was a hole in his chest and Draco laughed a bitter and petty laugh because how poetically shit this whole thing was?
“It’s not that big a deal?” Harry tried to return to the book but Draco kept watching him. How was he supposed to ask for the memories of them? Or the story on how he managed to gain all three? Or if he’d ever eluded Death with the cloak. If feeling the Elderwand under his command was somehow different to his own. Harry set the book aside. Attention directed at Draco.
“This is what’s going to happen. We’ll leave.” His stomach dropped, he hadn’t really considered being able to adopt one but hearing Harry give up was disappointing. Now, now surely he saw how useless-- “Once we sit in a room and get to see the available crups.”
When the destruction stopped and the night air chilled the room Draco returned to see Harry with his hand against the trunk. Clambering over the oversized roots, Draco pulled him away before it ate everything. Harry eyes were bleary, his face ashen. Draco looked around his sitting room, then to the roof - which no longer sat fully on top of the house, but in pieces at his bare feet.
Well, it would seem so. What was Hermione doing? She must know about how to deal with this. It was simple.
“I love Harry,” her voice warbled but she didn’t cry. “I, something’s you can’t get passed.” Draco spelled away the mess, sat down on the opposite of the kitchen counter and waited. “He lies a lot, I told you. I bloody told you lot. Why don't people listen when I say it?” Rubbing at her temples she seemed to try and calm down from the thought of that magic, that dark magic Harry had only ever shown him once.
“Come on, find me again.” Draco apparated again.
“Tell me,” Harry said and tried to grab at his wrist again.
He was a Malfoy, this shouldn’t be such a big deal. Get over it.
“Yes, of bloody course I am.”
It took some manoeuvring, Potter silent and face like a smacked arse - Draco chapped the letter box before waiting. The footsteps were fast and unlike what Draco expected, it was Lily who answered the door.
He made a horrible shriek and took enjoyment from the jump Harry made out of his skin. Potter rubbed his face with his hands, “I’m fine. I'm fine.” The hearing of an owl was impeccable and so Draco knew they were words to soothe a frantic mind than for soothing of precious ‘Fornax’.
“Argh.” He’d labelled a vial wrong. Kept thinking about-- “Potter.”
“I’ll tell you, okay. Just, just put the wand down.” Draco lowered it, a fraction, if only to stop Blaise from panicking, “Look, I was helping. I just said some stuff when you were sleeping to make Potter uncomfortable so he’d leave the room.”
Sighing, Harry closed his eyes and Draco stayed still even as Harry rested his chin on his head and quietly - not as if anyone ever need to say anything loudly for an owl - said one word and Draco cooed back not wanting to disturb the normal Harry returning. He knew how to deal with this one. But an upset one? Never again--
“Ollie, shut up.”
“He’s been dead a while, the blood is black and congealed under his skin and I think you or Lotty would’ve noticed before.”
Harry started again and Draco nearly - but did not because he had something known as impulse control - sighed, and bit his lip. “He was… He was calming Lily and Rose down. But he wasn’t hurt.” Scorpius who had been scared of attention had changed by the end of his fifth year. Seeker for Slytherin and more than eclipsing Draco’s skills created a swell in confidence within the boy that at time Draco wasn’t too fond of - it sounded that this wasn’t one of those times. He’d done well to keep his cool.
“I’m just perfect.”
Recognition flashed over Ron’s face and Draco froze believing himself caught before he’d even managed to formulate much else of his plan.
Looking around the Leaky Cauldron, Draco followed the shadows to the back and sat by himself. Chattering between the few patrons was enough to blanket even the sound of someone asking him what he wanted. He ordered a cheap drink all the while unfolding the note under the table.
Fine. Bloody fine then. And Draco slipped out the Manor before Lotty made a scene.
“He can have whatever he wants; I don’t want to hear ‘boo-hoo where’s the seafoam?’ one more time.” Astoria tried her best not to laugh and Draco was well aware he wasn’t the only one who wanted to launch this book out of the window and tell Scorpius it must have disappeared because a pixie took it. Neither of them did, they kept reading the adventure of Charmy, the Changeling and hated every second of it.
“Can I stay over?”
The letter he wrote to Harry informing him of their time together was officially over – Draco had had fun but that was all it was and Harry should make sure to have everything out of the Manor and never try to apparate inside again as he would be removed soon from the wards making it impossible to see him again.
Is this what Harry meant?
It was strange to know Harry was scared of something. A little scary, really.
Out of all the emotions, Draco expected anger, some sort of denial. A twist and a lie to try and get out of being caught. But Blaise sighed deeply and slouched forward, leaning his head on his hands and muttering the words, “I’ve never shagged Pansy, never even thought about it.”
Potter wasn’t expecting Fornax to hop up onto the table and try again to swoop. It failed. Draco failed, as much as the letter was in his beak and Potter was (hilariously) shocked at a random owl barrage, Draco fell. Fell out of the air as if he was a creature that wasn’t meant for it. He expected to crash into Manor’s marble, the cold and harsh ground of centuries built. He wished he had smashed into it. Knocked himself out so he didn’t need to process that Potter had grabbed him with that - utterly ridiculous - magic and levitated him.
Huffing out a breath - Draco felt it across his cheek more than hearing it, Harry asked, “What’s wrong? Did he say something to you? He did, didn’t he?”
Well that was mortifying. That’s it. He was moving to France. Ready to deflect, defend his ego and dismiss whatever Harry was going to say, Draco glared as he shifted. He waited to hear something smarmy, something snarky which would make Draco’s blood boil and show them both this couldn’t work. Never work.
He choked on the butterbeer he stole from Neville. His night got worse when he spied the curly hair by the bar.
Because she was scared. She knew death was closing in on her if she stayed. Was she warned to leave? And if she was, was it simply a fail-safe to make sure Draco didn’t hear back about who was sneaking around his house. The Cherub, Nott warned was a liar. Could they also be a killer? Was this vote truly so necessary to fail and never be uttered again? Why the desperation?
“Forget it, I’m staying in,” Draco huffed but after another glaring contest and Draco hated he hadn’t managed to pull out where Potter was planning on going  he complied with Potter’s barmy request. If Potter did snog him outside someone would see it, most definitely, Draco wasn’t so lucky to dodge the gossip-mongers  for this long.
What did happen afterwards, that Scorpius then understood those Muggle books were all fantasy and not tutorials was he seemed to mellow. If not turn into a ridiculous reader of those same books himself.
Harry didn't speak but the crup did. Howling and grumbling low for all of Draco's attention - really his duty to provide it to such a creature - and Draco monopolised the time. This was the first and last time he'd meet a crup. Now, he just had to remember every detail, everything so he could rewatch it in a pensive for years to come.
Harry might be very mad, or not, Draco couldn’t tell, only he seemed to be so tense, hands clenched into Draco’s robes so tight he could feel the tremble. But now, Draco rambled unable to think of how to backtrack if Harry was somehow offended or thought to find no truth in these words. So, Draco kept going.
“That’s it?” Harry accused him and it settled under Draco’s skin.
Lotty appeared along with a curious snout which sniffed at his face and Draco hadn’t the energy to shoo either of them away. Time blurred and Draco woke with a hideous taste in his mouth and a hunger he hadn’t felt since he was cursed.
Harry near bristled at the order and Draco could hear how confused and bizzare it sounded to him - he didn’t seem to know much about crups. He knew, Draco could hear the implications he was untrustworthy in every which way.
Thwump.
“You--” Harry looked him up and down.
“Incarcerous.”
“I used to like my lie-ins.” Half hoping the creature would take the hint and leave proved futile. An unmoving stare followed. He didn’t move either. Then the whining started. And what a noise that was.
“Did you hear anything before?”
It was visceral and instantaneous. Wilks shoved him away, disgust and revolution on his face.
The next Monday came and went and with it Draco’s last trace of patience. Muggles were barmy, the two ladies from earlier continuing their gossip: something involving ‘hair dye’, ‘coloured contacts’ - whatever those were – and staring. Always staring. Draco was certain they were talking about him but couldn’t fathom how.
“I know,” Draco said as he stretched and sighed. “That’s why I’m doing it.” Harry’s jaw twitched again and Draco knew he was close to losing his patience so, he stopped. Let Harry read over his work and scratched away at Draco’s own patience.
Drained and wanting nothing more than to sleep seeing the crup bound towards him as he returned home and Lotty pop back into existence to ask about what sort of snack he'd like to eat made everything just a little easier. He spend his time crouched down, hugging the crup and be attempted-licked-at that he still didn't believe was quite his - not really - and muttering possibilities of food to Lotty.
Even if Draco didn’t know how good an Auror Neville had been, he was without doubt better at taking care of flowers and weeds and everything in-between than hurling hexes at the designated bad guys. They were dare he suggest it: pretty.
’ Neville invited him over, to join in and there’s no reply, no text till several days later. By then, it’s long texts of Quidditch and eventually devolves around the mention of Hannah. And then, Neville’s answer grows longer, snippy almost in a manner Draco saw as an argument they’d had before but never finished. Some more deleted messages litter their go betweens.
“You can’t stay here forever. You have my word, I’ll find discrete people. We can all help you then.” Draco had to wonder if Siobhan had asked for galleons from Harry before coming to him. She was trying to play them both - two payments for one task. He’d keep an eye on any expensive Siobhan’s suggestions.
“Tell Longbottom I’ll see him on Monday. Him here first.” He’d let the man know he hadn’t some nefarious plot waiting for Harry. If he didn’t believe him, fine.
“Time’s up, off you go.” Waving him away to go stall his son. Harry shook his head, spelled away the dampness and left the bathroom.
“I suppose and he’s hardly mine.” Harry slotted his drink into the arm of the chair with a little too much force.
“Just one or two.” Harry threw one over his head and rubbed at his hair, and Draco kept his head as low as he could. Was it him being too cold or Harry’s worry which forced its magic to respond?  He didn’t know, but another ran down his back and he could barely keep his wand in his hands as he cast a warming charm. It might make him feel better but it didn’t dry out his damp and cold skin. The Manor sent him another, anxious and too concerned over the Head of House being cold. Too cold, Draco heard it say, a vision of himself shivering in his head.
“So, Mr. Quartz receives some money from--” Harry went searching through his stacks of chaos, and they won. “Some ministry subsidiary, his house is old. Anyway, it’s his son that has a trail of spending whenever the money comes in. People rarely change, not unless something happens to force it and the fact Moran is suddenly making quite a lot of purchases, says something is different.”
“You can read these too.” Draco threw Pansy’s collection onto the bed. “Blaise’s letters to Theo. I don’t want to know what’s in them.”
Not rolling his eyes at the arrogance, Draco told him to follow. They'd need more space and Draco wasn't going to have the possibility a hex might lodge its way into the house or the furniture. This was going to be delightful. And yet, Draco needed to make sure his anger wasn't overriding his sense. Harry wanted him to lose, but not be hurt. He supposed, he could use a spell to nip at him, a very mild stinging hex if any.
“Draco, come on, stop. You know what I meant.”
“We should talk,” Harry said and shut up.
“Decimus is a good excuse to leave the Manor.” Draco shifted, not sure what to say. Was he better? He didn’t feel better, didn’t feel like he’d been put back together again with anything stronger than tissue paper. “Today’s been… better than most,” Draco admitted spending the day outside had done wonders for his mood, those phantom and intrusive whispers not ruining his time even when they had debated on whether or not an attack was incoming.
“Mr. Harry Potter needs Master Draco Malfoy’s help.”
And as Draco fretted over ingredients of a soon to be potion, Siobhan stretched and yawned. “You must be tired, Mr. Malfoy. Your friend will be fine, I won’t leave my station until he is out of the woods, so to speak.”
“You have to look forward.” Harry was far too pleased with whatever this Muggle thing was and reluctantly Draco turned back around and stared at the closed Floo.
“Humble too. Alright. So, what’d want?”
"A common monstrosity, good to know."
“I accept.” How naïve, they way he puffed up – as if somehow, there was a chance he'd ever, ever be able to beat him. This kid, who'd done his homework and listened well in class and hadn't ever been in anything other than duels overseen by teachers and lecturers.
They laughed a bit before a Muggle child ran around the exhibit shrieking and Draco made an immediate exit with Harry tapping away at his phone. Was this over now? Not that Draco was keen to return to stagnate in one house but he was tired.
“I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking.”
“James,” Albus near growled the name like a curse.
“What if Astoria refused to marry you if you were poor?”
Luna smiled and nodded, “Mm, how did you know?”
Best check in with the Minister given all that had happened. He had been putting it off. Tell her not to expect too many letters for a while. No, maybe he would leave it till she had calmed? Till Draco could talk about it to someone who wasn’t there.
How that bloody Hippogriff in Hogwarts was the very proof Potter was far too good - and he didn’t mean it in a Saintly Potter way either. The beast was awful and clearly crazy and too proud to be around students and somehow, somehow the beast escaped its fate to die. When he’d heard it alive and Hermione had hinted towards why, back when he held the last timeturner around his neck. Most people would have given up. Most people wouldn’t dare mess with a bloody timeturner. And Harry had done that because he always did seem to try and do ‘the right thing’, whatever that bloody meant and went out of his way to save a creature that he didn’t actually need to save.
All he had to do was make an edible meal. Passable. That’s all. And then he could gloat and make Potter want to make another meal in return. Thankfully the Muggle machine daunted Draco more than was necessary – it was simple, really and Draco ignored the barbs from Neville.
One of Harry’s hands had firmly clamped onto Draco’s own, fingers and nails digging into each other. Draco didn’t feel nearly as in control any more, not when he started kissing at the scars.
Potter’s home was a mess. Never mind Draco knew this wasn’t the home he shared with his wife or the one where his children were reared and taught. Where was this and why had Potter returned to bachelor behaviour that didn’t show any responsibility for anyone, including his own person? What was that smell?
Hermione was too sharp for her own good as she settled on asking, for the third time, “Are you okay?”
“Come on, little fella--” Granger received a sharp look and a threat to keep those fingers away.
(I apologise for the pun. I couldn't resist!)
Harry used him as a distraction and Draco shifted on the armrest, turning his head around and grooming at the feathers on his neck. Then, Harry regarded him again, as if he was debating on whether Draco was just an owl. Or maybe, maybe he knew Draco was in the room and didn’t want him to hear what Siobhan would say. Offering his arm in a too familiar manner was strange to see. He wasn’t happy over it, that much was clear as he pulled up his sleeve.
“If this works, I might be impressed.”
Every week from then on flowed with routine.
It only took five minutes for the first Seeker to snatch it out the air and triumphantly set the tone for the others. It was quick, too quick and Draco tried to see how Scorpius took the news.
People weren't interested in Draco, they were interested in Malfoy. Nothing from any previous encounters of those who had flirted and made their intentions clear ever made this make sense. Where was Harry's endless sea of compliments and ego-bolstering comments, or boasting about feats that Draco thought bogus? Where was the questions about his money? Why had Harry asked about the Mark instead, like everyone else, ignoring it as if it was the dirty secret they would allow him? Where was his nattering that begged to be liked and happy to side only as a substitute to his dead wife?
“Real proud of yourself, aren’t you?” he sneered. Harry’s magic was by far the most ridiculous Draco had ever encountered.
“Right. Right, I’m up.”
“Albus.” People pushed by them as they stood apart, awkward at the bottom of the Quidditch stands. It was unlikely a proper game would be played but many people had come to keep an eye on the new blood, cheer on family and friends or jot down names which might be good enough to write a quick column about.
Lotty blinked into existence by his side. The necessary order had came through without any issue. It was in the lab. Sent from Neville. Looks like his day would be making more potions for Harry. Opening the box, thick wood and handwriting neat: We still on for Monday? messaged upon the top. Lotty asked if there was a problem and Draco dismissed her.
“Just if we’re coming back here drunk it’d make us sitting ducks, so let’s not drink too much.”
His solitude didn’t last long as Harry returned, clothes in tow.
“I wasn’t glaring.” Harry wasn’t lying, he supposed as Draco took another sip. Eventually, once Hermione made her speech the evening would run down and most would start to leave. Whatever impression Harry had left along with them. Harry still had time to undo the damage he’d done.
“Draco?” Harry called out, “are you that tired?”
“Thanks,” Harry smiled and Draco wondered who it was directed towards. His Auror robes were off, hanging up over his chair and revealing more Muggle clothing. Outrageous, really but the Auror-trainee, whatever she was, didn’t so much as blink at the sight. Harry left his own pile of parchment and Draco wasn’t sure why. Fornax could fly, he didn’t need this escort.
Draco hadn’t expected his mother to speak of that or an answer to the question but Albus spoke up again. “Astoria’s here, isn't she?” He sounded quiet, and Draco wondered when his son had shared it.
“Mr. Malfoy?”
Someone might have rushed down the stairs but Draco couldn’t see anything not while the memories buried themselves into his head. He didn’t really want to see these. To see Astoria smile and chatter and talk like she was still here. But here she was whirling around in her wedding dress and Draco wanted to weep at how he was now stuck, dying and his last sight wasn’t even of reality.
(See the end of the chapter for
“When’s the next vote anyway? What’s it over?” Typical Harry didn’t know.
“I can run out of magic?” Harry asked and Draco might as well have headbutted the tree to stop him from scoffing at the sheer ignorance of this whole debacle.
“Mr. Potter always does more work when it’s here. You think it’s like a support owl or something?” The idea revived him. “Oh! Oh! Or a spy from the Minister making sure he does everything he's supposed to!”
It was a calming activity, one with simple and obvious progress. Taking the mixed herbs, he added them to the mortar, crushed them until they were still crisp - not yet mushed - but broken and battered enough to break open each fig. Draco magicked the water in the cauldron. Then he started to measure the broken herbs. He removed half from the mortar, two measures worth. Adding to it, his sprigs of  lavender, and a touch of water too and this time created a paste. Thick, but not clumpy or sticky. He measured it three and a half, more than he needed. The cauldron got its first ingredient, then its second - the mucus and the other two measures of herbs. The heat underneath, Draco kept an eye on the thermometer, making sure it was not rising sharply and boiling too strong.
“I like tea, I just don’t--”
“Look here.” Draco pointed to his own eyes, and Harry just blinked and stared back. Two different sizes. His pupils were two different sizes. How didn’t he see this before? The one time he didn’t stare Potter down. “You took a pain relief potion, didn’t you?” Draco leaned closer and squinted at the left - it was changing size again. Well, what Siobhan had done was clear enough.
And then he was sent to bed like he was a child. Sleeping wasn’t what he did because he hadn’t specifically been ordered to, no he stayed awake trying all manners of ways to remove the ring.
Harry knew - Draco knew he knew - detrimental or not - but not what - Draco was hiding something from him. Fifteen minutes should help dry those stains in pretty well and give time for Harry to add in more.
“Scorpius, I’m fine.” Somewhat. “I’ll be fine.” He corrected once Scorpius pouted and didn’t believe him. “How about a drink?” A tad early, really to drink but this was a unique event.
The Master and Owner of the Malfoy Manor… was an owl.
“I just hurt an owl by mistake.”
“Where-Where are you going?” It was the stumble over the word that stopped Draco. Potter didn’t sound fine. Turning back, he saw that Harry was like a kicked crup, desperate to not be left on its own and ever eager to follow. Knowing how sapped of energy Harry must be, Draco doubted he could stand never mind stand. But the bloody Gryffindor was trying to stand up, pushing himself again.
Harry didn’t notice him, for he was flying around and watching the last few owls grab some food and return to their alcove nests. He landed shortly after Harry began to read the short and faked letter. So, Draco groomed his feathers, keen to seem like an ordinary owl. He sat for what felt like hours. As the fake message of wishing Harry well was read more than once. Going by how many times Harry struggled to put the damned thing down. Draco heard his old Hogwarts owl call for him and twist her head around as she waited for a reply.
Scorpius was by his bedside again, hovering and wore an expression Draco wasn’t used to – he was holding his emotions in, a half-sneer and discomfort twisting to an obnoxious or near petulant attitude. He’d been told never to cry in public, where people he didn’t know might see.
“You know, I’m supposed to say that to you.”
“That’s enough Rita. Unless you want me to hand you back to the owl, turn back,” Harry commanded and the entire department seemed to wait. Some wore confused faces, looking to their seniors to see if Harry Potter had really lost it.
“It’s done.”
“Harry, never get into politics, you’d never manage it. Promising something I know I can’t deliver is a sure way to have a vote. But only one, once.”
Harry’s cheerful visage was all the more explainable then. A rest, without potion. All because Siobhan - who else could it be - gave the impression his house was a giant dream catcher. Bloody idiot. No, that’s not how it worked. Draco was going to correct the mistake until he saw how Harry did look well rested. Instead of bloodshot eyes, they were their bright green again and Draco faltered.
“I can’t be the only one tired enough to sleep for a week,” Draco muttered, shutting his eyes and not sure how it was possible, but he was comfy here, on this horrific couch. Harry hummed back, seemingly happy enough to fall asleep on him.
This was – was a- the door handle lowered and Harry said, “Draco? Decimus is wanting--” Whipping around, Draco must stop Harry. He could not see this.
Can’t find anything, Sir.
“Is he now?” Damn it. Not even the possibility of Harry asking Draco for help entertained Blaise for more than a few seconds. This had to end fast and with as little chatter as possible because all Blaise would do was dig and dig.
“Slow down,” he hissed against Harry’s skin, an unsettling anxiety starting to make him second guess. Harry relented, if only enough to catch his breath and Draco considered it enough. This was enough, he was fine. Everything was fine.
They Floo’d. Somewhere more up North is what Harry had said.
Harry needed more magic to fight off whatever the leech had left inside. Draco only knew of one place that could potentially have enough magic if Hermione and Ron failed. Casting Trees said four and it was impossible to hand over more than half a person's magic without force being a factor. A large dose of magic is what Harry needed and the irony wasn’t lot on him. But as Draco’s eyes closed it came to him, he shot up, heart beating fast. He knew what might help.
“Probably best for you to have a quick shower,” Harry advised like Draco was in any danger of being ill. It took all of Draco’s control not to smile as he closed his eyes and let Harry dry the stray droplets running down his face. The giddiness morphed like an owl to a dragon and Draco couldn’t stop it. He really wanted to kiss Harry, pull him closer - soaking clothes and numb fingers be damned.
“I think he likes the denial more than me.” What an awful truth to blurt out to a stranger.
An errant thought he could kill her now and no one would be the wiser - he could swallow the evidence and Rita Skeeter, the woman who’d posted all the cruelest and worst things about his son - all those awful bullshit stories about his only son - and his wife would be gone. Finally. He pushed his foot against her, saw the beetle squirm more and screamed at her. He wished sometimes, he was capable of murder.
Hermione held out a hand, a treat of meat on it and Draco ignored it. He wasn’t happy with this revelation, not keen to share the real situation with one of the smartest witches of his time -- not happy at all to be stuck because someone planned better -- but he had no intention of being passed over to Weasley. He’d stay here because if Harry’s lack of control counted for anything, it meant even if someone did appear to kill him. Potter wouldn’t even have to use his wand to defeat them. He might blow up the house in the process but Draco wasn’t against such revenge. If he had to go out as an owl, so be it but he wanted those who might cause his family harm out of the way too.
Going by how the Aurors treated Draco and his father they wouldn't be leaving Blaise's side for a while either. Theo, Draco had heard, was bound by his parents to remain home. Pansy hadn't so much as shown up to even her own charity functions. She may as well be stuck home with the prick too. So long as he got what he deserved.
“I can fix it.”
This one was alone and Draco heard the Auror Trainee say something about Dark Magic. And, the memory blurred, unfocused and dizzying as Draco tried to keep track of what was going on. A woman opened the door – the discussion was bloated - yet static sounded and Draco couldn’t make out a word. They were allowed inside, a wide smile and a call upstairs. Harry thought over how his forehead might hurt, might catch the squibs in a lie, so loud and clear it was as if Draco had thought it.
“I think it caught something.”
“Do you even know what the word restraint means?” Draco caught his arm hoping Harry wouldn’t fall back and smash his head bloody.
“No, not yet. Though keep them close,” Hermione sighed, “Thanks for letting me know. I imagine I’ll know more soon too.”
“How is Harry?” He turned the bottle of FireWhiskey in his hands.
“Are you sure you’re okay? You’ve got a weird look on your face.”
Draco had the distinct thought he couldn’t breath fast enough to keep up with him.
He checked the clothing individually, more focused on Harry’s chatter – a nervous tic really, he obviously hadn’t been so comfortable speaking with Scorpius after snogging him in the bathroom. Then came the extra cloak, blood turning it a blotchy brown.
Audiences and acquaintances made every mistake, every flaw and embarrassment seem worse. Anthony spoke in innuendo, crude and outspoken flirtations and cringey pick up lines. Draco experienced each and everything he said several times over, only a few details changing each time. Anthony was not romantic or creative in his wooing. But while every other time Anthony’s words glided over Draco’s head, easily ignored and never provoking or causing discomfort (because Anthony was a gibbon trying to convince people he was a peacock) and as such, looked more ridiculous the more he tried.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Closing his eyes he tried not to panic at the idea of being a squib, of no longer having magic in his life.
Draco wasn’t sure why – but it brought him a great joy to see how fast Decimus was to run towards him. Less so that the crup didn’t seem to slow. Until Draco was jumped up on like Harry had and the weight and force was a bit too much, a bit too unexpected for Draco to so much than fall too.
OF THE RING OF CELIUS, YOUR RINGS OF CELIUS; HIS RINGS, CHECK ITS FLAWS AND YOUR FEARS
“Of course.” Finally, she stopped resting against the couch and Draco took that as a sign to move. He wouldn’t specify exactly what he required – he wasn’t sure – did he want to know? Did he want to look? See it? What should have been a reservoir of memory and happiness for himself and Scorpius wrecked.
And when Hermione’s guest list arrived, it came through the opened Floo. A swarm of files flying on through. They stacked themselves high up on the nearest table; how neat and polite of them. What Hermione had sent was a mass of information on the most prolific organisations. He would need to comb through each the guest list and the organisation member list to have any understanding on those guests who he’d never so much as met once.
“If you haven’t gathered, she wants you to be bored stiff and drop her galleons to take you away.” She was a wily one, he gave her that much. So, Slytherin wasn’t too far out of her grasp.
“Mr. Potter, please be reasonable. I will have to ask you to leave the--”
Really, it would be nice, to have someone… someone else to share the time left now Scorpius was out of sight. Draco Malfoy had a lot of time and potions weren’t engaging conversationalists. He sighed. No more thinking, damn it.
“You two have quite a lot of history.”
“What?” Harry actually sounded surprised. The oblivious-- Perhaps the chatter was an excuse for more attention.
Draco huffed his way from the table, despite Luna offering to go for the next round. He wouldn’t do as anyone said. Never, ever again. A few others bumped into him and he stumbled literally into the bar. It didn’t hurt. He could still walk and so his night wasn’t finished.
“Who’s Granger?”
Harry was tired, his eyes back to being dull and far away. The same gauntness that seemed to remind Draco he’d never really been better. Just better at hiding it. “Harry.”
He’d kept them for Scorpius, really. So he had somewhere to see her, tell her the things he was too scared or embarrassed to tell Draco himself.
“It doesn’t work like that, Blaise is a murderer.”
“See him, you need to do something you probably won’t like.” He didn’t point but motioned to the man in the obvious blue robes which were the worst fashion choices made this night. “Go remind Blue you killed Voldemort.”
“Just playing Harry, don’t worry. We’re all good.”
“It’s obstruction if you don’t tell me what you know.”
“Just leave the report there!” Harry covered his ears and Edgard was out of the office so fast Draco considered maybe, he was one of those wizards who was scared of owls. They weren’t like cats or dogs, that enjoyed pets and being spoken to. Most liked being with another owl, left to eat and hunt. Collins slammed the door as he retreated, white in the face.
Wilks.
“Your potions can bloody well wait.”
“What, trouble in paradise?” Draco snorted, he didn’t like the attention some people gave him over his still worn wedding ring. To him, it was an absurd concept. He shouldn’t wear it because his wife was dead. But he still loved her, still thought of her as his wife no matter how long she’d lay buried.
“You’re not going to go are you?” This was just another attempt to convince him. Another agreement undone. It took him by surprise at how his words were level. Cool and composed, Father would be proud. He was not. He hated this. This was it, then as far as they could go.
“No. But I’m not kissing you with that taste in your mouth.” Harry shrugged, kept eating his abomination and Draco sulked. Plan failed. “Now my hands are sticky. You arse, don’t laugh at me. It’s disgusting. It’s not even food. Whoever came up with this needs an Oblivate to the face.”
Harry’s feel-good attitude died, a swift murder where his face turned an ashen grey to the point Draco wanted to pull him close and wrap Harry in his cloak and check if he was still breathing.
“Was there a need to destroy the china?” Draco’s mood levelled. He’d done what he needed. Potter had shown his affliction and now Draco could offer help. Ignore all the word vomit from before, all interaction. That didn’t matter, that wasn’t necessary because if Draco could help Harry then he was indebted. An indebted Harry Potter could be forced to look the other way. Once. But it was all he needed.
Well, he tried to. If Harry’s behaviour was an interlude of highs and hallucinations then tomorrow morning would be worse than the tears tonight. It wasn’t as if Draco wasn’t aware Harry wanted him in his bed. But he’d probably had grander ideas than walking Draco to the bed and promptly sleeping.
“Fine.” Draco stood away from the door, clenched his hand tight because there was no way it was going to allow him to remove it. This one liked to dig in and as much as the teeth were small and sharp, the ring itself would tighten and cause more damage in the long run. Astoria’s mother was adamant to check it every time they met and his hand was always flawless - of course it was - and no scars or quick healing magic used. “Take the specs off.”
“She’s dead, you idiot.”
What Hermione used him for was testing the waters of up and coming ballots and countermeasures. See who really thought subsidising Muggleborn households for school was an ingenious idea or disingenuous. Who best to hear the worst of a witch or wizard when they always assumed they were the morally superior whatever they piffled on about with a Death Eater in the room. Some weren’t so bold but Draco knew more about social circuses and twisting words to benefit Hermione’s ideals than even she did.
Everyone else, I hope I haven't murdered some obvious HP-fandom rules. (Eek, have mercy!). If I have do let me know and I will offer sacrifices for your forgiveness! I'll make changes post-haste.
“I was wrong. There, happy?” Draco snapped. Harry wasn’t but he returned to eating the soup Lotty had served. Etiquette was not Harry’s strong suit and he scraped and hit the bowl with his spoon too often, too loudly and Draco wished he’d kept the conversation going.
Was this him simply clinging onto Harry because he was lonely and Harry unto him because he was hurt and Draco soothed the nightmares with potions? Draco wasn’t sure when he would be able to tell otherwise.
What should he say to that? What would happen to a squib Harry Potter? Was he to blame for this? This should never have happened, Draco shouldn’t have allowed this. Harry would be so pissed, maybe it would be best for him to lack the same magical prowess.
Draco didn’t rebel against that one.
"The wards were down, seven people forced their way through the threshold. It's not some prank that he's decided to leave without a word." Scorpius snapped, he may have heard the thinking Potter and confused it with the dismissive. Not anything Draco could blame the boy for: Potter thinking was rare.
“Things aren’t like that anymore. She wouldn’t--” Harry actually frowned, embarrassed and sulking when Draco laughed, a murky and dark feeling of having beaten Potter resurfaced.
Draco needed tea and tea he had.
“Goodbye, Blaise.” Uncharacteristically, Blaise hugged him but Draco passed it off as playing the part of the good friend so he clapped the man on his back twice so to keep up appearances in front of Potter. Blaise was a decent curse-breaker but taxes and licenses weren’t Zabini’s thing and doing either under the new Ministry law was a surefire way to see the inside of a cell.
“Theo has never bothered about Pansy or their obvious lack of feelings for each other. Ever. They didn’t even dance at their wedding never mind kiss. That’s why no one was surprised when they heard rumours about Pansy sleeping elsewhere.”
“I have no use for names I’ll never use,” Draco said. He didn't want to know this Muggle's name, not even how he knew Potter was worth knowing.
“It’s not like that,. He just thought relationships were all about...” Harry’s poor habit of talking about feeling and affection rose in his cheeks leaving them red and splotchy as he spoke. “I was used to having someone to natter on with, be on my side no matter what and he just- well, I think he was the type that thought affection was sex and that was it.”
While rotating it in his fingers, he must have spied the inscription, although Draco wasn’t sure how familiar Harry was with Latin. Cheaters never prosper wasn’t the most endearing to wear but Draco had done so with pride all his own. Each time Madame Greengrass wished to see it, she’d shut up for the rest of the evening. And that’s when Harry’s behaviour was explained so easily too: Harry wasn’t wearing his wedding ring either.
Wilks grinned, sided up to him and purred, “Draco, why I didn’t think Diagon Alley was within your purview much these days.”
Oh, how it was to be young and cocky. To believe every word out of one’s mouth was somehow ingenious or overflowing with wisdom or wit. “If you dare to even imply I – or my belate wife – so much as disliked a hair on Scorpius’ head ever again, I will duel you seriously – and you will lose.”
“I get it.” Harry faltered then, and Draco frowned at that voice. The ‘I Know Everything’ one. The fucking teeth-grinding arrogant one. It must have shown on his face, must have as Harry looked away, confidence lost. “Maybe not exactly but you had something from someone you cared for and now they’re both gone. I get that.”
Only one option then, Draco decided. The real Siobhan Goven, whoever she was, was dead and the fake took her chances at another life. A motive Draco could understand but didn’t trust: who was she, why did she decide this was better? The dread was back, tougher and thicker and stayed no matter how often Harry patted his feathers. Everything was closing in, everything was just a little too much. How was he supposed to navigate this?
Snogging him in Diagon Alley would be a simple answer to Harry’s question.
And that brought the question: what on earth was Draco doing? He’d never slept with another man before so how was this even a thing? How could he be lying here in bed, with Harry Potter, once a brat who’d rejected and almost killed him and saved him and given him mercy when the world didn’t want to. Was it even possible for him to give Harry what he wanted?
And then Draco was dragged into the Muggle world by Neville bloody Longbottom and Draco wanted nothing more than his normal clothing – the lack of cloak and robes was uncomfortable – and the whole time Neville watched him. As if he was a wild dog who’d turn on the mundane as soon they wandered too close.
“Practically gave me his wand too.”
“Under no circumstance have you to ever put the blue one on. Ever. Even if I ask you to. Never, not for a second.”
“Harry said they got everyone.”
Right. Draco didn’t trust this. “Sure. Give me a minute.”
No way had Wilks not noticed him, he’d seen that damned grin and Draco sighed. This was a terrible morning already with his soup being too salty and Lotty sobbing in fervent apologies. Dragging Harry out anywhere was not an easy task. For one, the man didn’t seem to like anywhere in particular, each place Siobhan suggested he’d shot down and any Draco suggested he wasn’t familiar. So, Diagon Alley wasn’t the best place for Harry Potter, ill and weary. Potter was going stir crazy and even Lotty’s reinventing the menu every few days held little appeal.
