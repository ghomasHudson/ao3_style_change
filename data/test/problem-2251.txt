A couple of Muggles came in, laughing boisterously. When they noticed Theo and Draco at the sinks, quietly standing close to each other with Draco’s hand on Theo's shoulder, they gave each other pointed glances and then started sniggering.
particular sore point — there were so many in their relationship history, it was hard to keep track.
“Right, yes,” he agreed anyway, and Harry stared at him for a long moment before turning away, retrieving his clothes from where Draco had thrown them. Not wanting to be the only nude one, he picked up his gown from the floor and pulled it on.
“This is just a quick diagnostic,” Bill explained as he drew more shimmering white lines in the air. “It shouldn’t hurt at all.”
Draco stiffened. He didn’t look at Harry. “Are you going to report me?” he asked, and his voice was cold as ice.
Seeing as he also refused to let anyone else help him finish the robes and would rather die than see Potter face-to-face, the only rational course of action he could think of was to finish the robes. When Potter came to pick them up, he’d simply hide in one of the Muggle washing machines.
His skin was tingling with anticipation as he sat next to Harry on the two-person sofa. The cushions’ stuffing was uneven and even though he sat by the arm, Draco slipped down towards the middle of the couch.
“Holy motherfucker,” Pansy swore, her mouth dropping open. Draco watched her eyes dart down to the robes on the workbench and then back up. Blaise followed, staring at Potter’s robes for a moment longer before it clicked. His eyes widened and then he started laughing maniacally. Pansy joined in a moment later, the two of them falling over each other as they cackled.
They pounded at the door again and Draco hurriedly pushed himself out of bed, ruining the post-orgasm bliss, and grabbed his dressing gown from the back of the door and his wand from the bedside table. He pulled the robe on and tied it around his waist — for the first time, regretting the black satin choice. It was better suited for haunting the manor halls on Saturday mornings with a coffee morning than confronting midnight visitors, but it was all he had at hand.
Ron taught him how to cook a beef wellington and Harry showed him the secret for getting the cheese perfectly melted for cheese on toast. He entertained Rose with little charms that made multicoloured lights burst from his wand and hang in the air above her head. He listened to Hermione talk about Muggle advancements in space travel alongside Ron, who kept chuckling to himself and saying things like, “Those Muggles!” in awed disbelief.
There was a dandelion growing on his father’s grave. The flower had bloomed, leaving only the puff of feathery white seeds. Draco bent over to rip it from the ground and throw it over the fence. He didn’t worry about disturbing the body below: Azkaban hadn’t returned one, just a small urn.
the one turning up at my house in the middle of the night and sucking me off. Pardon me for being a bit confused by the turn of events.”
Theo was in the middle of telling the other Slytherins about the events in the bathroom when Draco returned. He took a large gulp of wine as Theo described Naismith being dragged away by MLEP.
Draco’s smile slid from his mouth, and he glared at Harry fiercely. “I just spent hundreds of hours sewing these stupid robes.
He dropped his eyes to the whiskey tumbler, his finger tracing along the pattern etched in the crystal. He swilled the amber liquid in a smooth movement and took a sip. Seamus’ whiskey was smooth — sweeter than the usual mid-shelf bottles that Harry usually bought.
He shook his head and cast a folding charm that stacked the robes into a neat pile which he pushed towards Potter. “You should go talk to your uniform suppliers.”
But instead of peppering him with questions like he expected, Maggie laid her head on his shoulder and said, “I’m glad you had someone with you.”
Draco hardly ever got to work on mens’ dress robes — especially not ones where he’d have basically free reign. There wouldn’t be a constricting budget put upon him; Potter could afford the nicest fabrics and however many hours of work Draco wanted to invest.
She pointed to the thin line of silver embroidery that ran around the hems and cuffs of the robes. Draco had let the self-stitching needle do the monotonous embroidery stem stitches with small leaf detailing, monitoring it to make sure it kept to the same pattern and didn’t add any swear words. He grabbed the lapel and pulled it (and, by extension, Harry) up to his face. Sure enough, what he’d thought were leaves were definitely miniature penises.
He crossed back over to his desk and the drafts of Potter’s robes, putting his coffee on a coaster. He didn’t sit, though; instead, he crossed his arms across his chest and said to Madam Malkin, “Shall I call the Knight Bus for you, or did you walk here?”
Potter’s eyes darted from side to side and Draco could practically see the cogs turning slowly (probably fighting against years of rust from not having to deal with a single thought).
Draco didn’t want to go back to the party with everyone else monopolising Harry’s attention — he selfishly wanted him to stay with Draco, just the two of them. But he couldn’t admit that aloud, and it
He followed the line of leaving witches and wizards. They had temporarily opened a Floo Network in a nearby Muggle church, and everyone trickled through the doors into the echoing stone building. Draco waited his turn and then took a good handful of Floo Powder.
“Putting them in a bag so that you can take them and leave,” Draco said, summoning a paper bag with a large black ‘M’ printed on the front.
It was nearly ten o’clock. Ron was also coming off night shifts but he’d probably be awake by now. If not, it wouldn’t be the first time the Granger-Weasleys had come downstairs in the morning to find Harry on the couch eating their weetabix. He grabbed Hermione’s books and a handful of Floo Powder.
, Harry thought as they walked in silence. They were both too stubborn to apologise after a fight, even when they both said things they regretted and the little things began to stack up, until Harry couldn’t look at Ginny without first having to slash through so many layers of unresolved, petty disagreements. After all, how could you address the fact that it annoyed you when your partner left her hair stuck to the shower wall when you knew it would inevitably escalate to the point you were promising to try therapy again because your nightmares woke them up every night? Even then, at the end of an hour of tears and pain that left you feeling like all the skin had been scraped off with a steel brush, the fucking hair would
The sun had long since set, but the London sky was never truly dark. It was a risk to mount his broom and kick off for the brief moment that he hung in the murky brown sky, illuminated by the artificial glow of streetlights and car headlamps, but he ducked his head and soared higher, faster. Once he was certain he’d be nothing but a nearly invisible inky speck against the polluted sky, he turned his broom north and flattened himself against the handle, staring ahead straight as if the snitch was in front of him, just out of reach.
“It’s all moot, anyway. He doesn’t like me. Quite understandable, really, given… Given everything…” His eyes fell on the black lines that were just peeking around his forearm. He swallowed and blinked angrily.
He gestured around at the foyer again. He briefly wondered how Potter had got past the wards, but then he remembered that one of the terms allowing him to stay in Malfoy Manor had been to grant the Auror department access to the house at all times.
” he moaned, come lubricating his hand as he continued to stroke himself through the last waves of his orgasm.
McGonagall levelled him with a steady stare, and the three of them stood silently for a long moment. The seconds ticked by and Draco counted,
His skin prickled, not unpleasantly, and he caressed his chest, following the lines of the criss-crossing scars without thinking. He rubbed his thumb across his nipples and gasped as a lightning bolt of desire streaked to his toes.
He couldn’t say who moved first — he wasn’t even sure if either of them moved. As far as Harry was aware, one moment they were apart and the next they weren’t.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh, though the sound was mirthless. He finished the cooling dregs of his tea and the tea leaves stuck in the mug's bottom. Out of habit, he tried to discern any pictures in the swampy residue, but as always, all he saw was old tea leaves.
Malfoy put down his tea. “The robes you dropped off,” — he looked at the clock on the wall behind him — “about twenty minutes ago?”
to Harry, wouldn’t accept that maybe reality didn’t match his twisted perceptions. Harry didn’t care about his job. He cared about protecting people. Hunting dark wizards? Well, yes, in order to make the world a safer place. But the
She shouldered her bag, and they did an awkward dance as they tried to settle on a farewell gesture, dancing from hug to cheek kiss to wave until they exchanged a weird thumbs-up crossed with a fist bump that was so awkward they both broke into hapless giggles.
“I love it,” Rolf said with a big grin. “No idea what I’d be doing if I couldn’t be a magizoologist — I couldn’t work behind a desk in an office, I’d go mad.”
Harry surrendered himself completely to Draco’s savage thrusts. He was sure he was leaving scratches and bruises all over Draco’s back, but he’d never felt more alive, never this out of control and never so much like his true self. There was no discord in his mind, there was just room for him and Draco in this very moment. This absence of guilt, shame and worry was liberating and with every one of Draco’s thrusts he met, he let himself go a little more, letting the freedom of his position wash over him.
Draco waited whether he would say more, but Harry had fallen silent again, all his courage seemingly spent on those few words.
When the figure finally looked up and focussed on Draco, he felt like he was being perused by a steam-powered metal snail. It was a disconcerting experience, because the other man could probably see him quite clearly, while Draco could not even make out his features properly. He was grateful when the hand that had only moments ago been working with, what he could now see were the inner workings of a clock came up and pulled the magnifying goggles over his head, revealing a pair of circular glasses and the intense still slightly magnified gaze of a pair of familiar green eyes directed at him.
“Ah,” Percy replies, he smiles kindly. “You’re not the only one who still has trouble with that from time to time. Sorry I said something to trigger you.”
They were both naked from the waist down, their shirts hanging open and exposing their chests. Draco once again pushed Harry back onto the sofa and climbed back into his lap. He leant forward, his hot breath ghosting over Harry’s ear making him shiver.
When he reached the Manor it was more heavily warded than he remembered and he had to wait for a house elf to pick him up at the gate and accompany him to the heavy oak front doors. His heart began beating faster as he beheld Draco. He’d become almost too thin, but that didn’t seem to diminish his beauty in the least. His gaze was distrustful, completely unlike the last time Harry had seen him, and it stung.
Draco’s laughter was loud and carefree and Harry couldn’t help but join in. They laughed until their bellies hurt and each time they looked at each other they started all over again. When they finally managed to calm down Draco was half hanging over Harry’s back, trying to keep himself and Harry upright. Their faces were close to touching, Harry would only need to lean forward a few inches to close the distance and taste. He held Draco’s gaze and leant in slightly only to have Draco blush furiously and disentangle himself quickly.
“For one, you could bloody well let me through your floo like the gracious host you always pretend to be.”
This time he barely made it out into the observatory, the diary shrunk and hastily stuffed into the pocket of his shirt, when he heard his mother call for him. She rushed over to his side and before he could stop her, her cool fingers where on his forehead and cheeks.
Draco knows who is waiting for him on the other side of the gates. He knows tonight will be the last night he’ll be here, like he’s been here every night since Draco came back from Hogwarts for the holidays. What he doesn’t know is why the man is here, or what he wants from Draco and that worries him more than he is willing to admit.
The evening was already approaching when he made his way back towards the Manor. He passed an elder tree whose thin branches were bent down by the weight of hundreds of ripe elderberries. Draco couldn’t resist stopping and trying a few berries, their slightly bitter, heady taste exploding on his tongue as he ate. His fingers were stained with the dark purple berry juice, looking too much like blood for his comfort in the fading light. He’d spent too much time outside he realised, when he saw just how long the shadows had become.
With every grain of sand tumbling over his outstretched hand came the memory of a shared moment, a touch, an emotion flashing through his mind. The flashes came quicker and became clearer the more sand got into contact with his skin. Overwhelmed by the raw emotion in them, he tried to tilt the bottle up again but suddenly found he couldn’t. One image slowly began to push all others aside. Not unlike with a Pensieve, Draco suddenly found himself immersed in one of Harry’s memories.
His dreams became ever more vivid, he could hear the scratching of the creatures hands on the glass and the outside of the lighthouse, whether he was awake or asleep. He knew it wasn’t the wind, couldn’t have been the wind, when he discovered the deep gouges in his front door and on the wooden shutters.
Potter was on Draco’s side of the desk in an instant, grabbing his arms and pulling him upright, slamming his back into a nearby wall.
“Oh stop being such a drama queen, Potter!” Draco chides him, because he won’t stop moving in his arms.
He shouts and tries desperately to free himself, but it is no use. Draco gets steadily pulled downward. The last thing he sees before his head vanishes into the floor is the dark knight’s form, desperately waving and shouting and then throwing himself into the waves.
When he walked along the landing that lead to their bedroom, it felt longer than usual; the only people who could understand what Draco felt at this moment were the ones who had been shouted at a lot, been confined to a small room and were then led to a platform where a man wearing a black hood to hide his face was waiting for them. Everything inside of him screamed at him to run away, to avoid the last piece of evidence that things would never be the same but his feet weren’t listening, they steadily carried him forward.
Potter was dragging him into a lift. The doors seemingly closing in slow motion, framed the advancing horde of whatever they were. Draco still couldn’t believe his eyes.
“Do I look like I care?” Potter snarled, flicking his wand at the open door, making it slam shut with a resounding crash, without even once looking away. Sudden fear washed over Draco. Nobody would care what happened to him here. Nobody would even ask questions why Death Eater scum had accidentally tripped down a flight of stairs and got hurt in the process.
He kept returning to the topic of Draco and of how he felt with Draco around him. Even now those memories were overshadowed by guilt, but when Hermione made him talk more about it and tell her what he felt beside the guilt, the enormity of his feelings overcame him once more. When he told her about the diary he’d been keeping, she asked to see it, but he refused, claiming it to be too personal to share with anyone.
Pansy raised a questioning eyebrow at the expression that must have shown on his face. Draco envied her for a moment. Oh how he wished he could still do that. One only knew how much one relied on facial hair for expressions when it was gone.
“How far is this from us?” Harry asked, because the solar system in front of them obviously wasn’t their own.
Draco spoke sharply with him and Harry mumbled an apology, finally voicing his desire to speak to Draco again.
Potter’s gaze was intense and Draco barely kept himself from shuddering and trying to shrink to appear even smaller under such scrutiny. He nodded again.
Draco could see Harry’s eyes widen in shock as he realised who was about to step into the room. It was Draco’s parents, a set of matching concerned expressions on their faces. He could see his father do a double take when he realised the position his only son and one Harry ‘vanquisher of all evil’ Potter were in.
Suddenly he caught sight of movement out of the corner of his eye, just by the window. Without conscious thought, Harry rushed over there to check. A relieved sigh escaped him when he saw that everything was alright. He could hear thunder in the distance and decided that he must have included the natural phenomenon in his dream. He stood by the window, resting his hands against the cold glass, the solid feel comfortable underneath his fingers.
Harry pulled Malfoy close to him to make sure he didn’t fall. Malfoy was as cold as a corpse, his face covered in rain and the strands of his hair wet from the rain. How long had he been out here? Harry removed his parka and draped it over Malfoy’s shoulders like a cloak.
Draco looked over his shoulder once more, grinning at Granger and thinking that maybe this Christmas was beginning to look up after all and he couldn’t resist one last jibe.
He didn’t even notice someone speaking to him until the person repeated what they’d said, sounding more urgent this time.
Harry felt gobsmacked. Adding this to his mounting guilt of still not having come clean to Draco made their becoming friends or whatever it was that they were headed toward even harder. Harry knew that he was already lying to himself where Draco was concerned. The little time he had spent with the man and most of all the still vivid memories of that night told him that the last thing he wanted from Draco was friendship.
“No, but here — try this first.” Pansy pushed a crystal glass filled with a suspiciously pink liquid into his hand.
It had taken Pansy years after the war to find a job. He hadn’t known any of this for the first year; he’d been too preoccupied with his mother, and his friends had been so busy trying to distance themselves from any Death Eater links that they hadn’t spoken except for the condolence letters.
Harry stared at her gormlessly as the house-elf grumbled something and he jumped from the chair. He disappeared with a crack, having given up with stairs.
Harry paced the length of his office. From the open desks on the other side of the door, he could hear murmured conversations. No one had tried to speak to him since he returned (for the second time) and stormed past everyone without a word, slamming the door behind him. They could probably see his restless silhouette in the fogged glass and were no doubt gossiping about his foul mood.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said and exhaled sharply. He shook his head. “Sorry, I’m not sure why I came in, I was just passing by and, um. I dunno. Anyway, Wednesday is fine, don’t bother Malfoy about it.”
Harry snorted at the perfunctory note and lack of question mark after what was clearly a question and glanced at the calendar hanging on his wall. It took a moment for him to remember what day it was, and then another long minute of staring at the blank boxes, trying to remember if he’d made any plans and what his work schedule was.
“Don’t worry, you look like the same-old prat to me,” Ron said and Harry threw an empty inkwell at him. Ron dodged it easily. “What did Robards want?”
“Yeah,” Draco agreed. Nothing would ruin the serene atmosphere in the bedroom quite like Pansy’s mad witch cackle.
name’s here too, Potter,” he said, then sighed and turned his palms outwards — a conciliatory gesture. “It was perhaps a rash decision. I can see now that our evidence was weak and we should have examined the validity of our sources. I’ll schedule a training day to refresh everyone’s memories and I’ll talk to the Minister about adding additional clarity to the Auror policy on raids. You can contribute your opinions on how to improve in the meeting. What do you think?”
“And what did you find out?” It was impossible to tell from his dry tone whether he was interested or sarcastic.
He walked back to the funeral, keeping his head down as he crept back to his chair. Thankfully, it was just as the speakers were swapping over, so he didn’t interrupt any touching memories of Madam Malkin. When he sat, Maggie immediately latched on his hand.
“Yes, yes, I said it’s not a big deal. If you want me at the wake, I can come. Neither of us is about to die, I promise.”
He waited until the latch clicked before turning to Harry, arms crossed and a frown etching deep creases into his brow.
and being helpful. The pile was so tall it was becoming unstable — threatening to collapse any day now. All Harry had to do was go through them and throw out the ones that had nothing relevant, maybe circle anything particularly interesting. That was it. But each time he considered making a start, his stomach would shrivel into a dense pit and he would suddenly think of a hundred other chores that he’d been putting off — like watering his tomatoes, or Vanishing the leaves out of all the gutters — and he dodged it for another day.
Another issue they had to overcome: Muggle money. None of them had a clue how it worked and there were so many different pennies and rectangles of slippery paper that they didn’t know where to start. Eventually, Greg came to the rescue and said he’d handle all of it. After all, he got paid in Muggle money so was having to make weekly trips to Gringotts to convert his wages. He started paying for their drinks with his elektrick money card during his shifts and then charging them back in Galleons every few weeks once the tab had racked up.
There were several concealment charms on the door between the Muggle front and the sewing room. They were so strong that Draco would sneeze if he lingered by the doorway for too long, but Maggie was terrified of accidentally breaking any of the secrecy laws and having her business shut down, so she’d spent far too much of her start-up money hiring the kinds of security professionals that were more used to warding the Quidditch World Cups than a small, independent business.
“Oh, er, right, yeah, will do,” Potter mumbled and, food in hand, left, glancing over his shoulder at them as he left as if worried they would follow him.
He’d been vaguely aware of the various investigations going on into Statute of Secrecy Breaches, but they were the sort of cases that constantly ticked by in the background — he hadn’t realised there was anything special about the latest one. There were two separate anonymous tip-offs. Harry could hear the whining tone of voice of the kinds of people who’d written them, busybodies with nothing better to do with their time. They sounded a lot like Aunt Petunia in his head.
“But we’ve talked to everyone here,” Harry said. “You’ve shown off our robes and I’m sure there’ll be fifty new clients on your doorstep tomorrow morning — can’t we go?”
,” Potter said, and Theo’s nose jerked back into position in a way that looked incredibly uncomfortable.
He had no intention of giving himself paperwork over the weekend, especially when he knew for a fact it would never go anywhere. For all the talk of unity and recovery after the war, the Mark on his arm would forever make him an outcast. He deserved it, and he’d come to terms with that. He’d carved out a place in society that accepted him, for the most part, and he didn’t see any reason to interact with the rest of it.
“Uh-huh.” He sighed deeply and got a quill and parchment from his pocket. “So, what are your individual relationships with this shop?”
Harry gaped at him wordlessly. His mouth opened and closed silently a few times like a goldfish. “I never said that,” he protested. “I
Dressed and with several metres of space between them, they stared at each other. Potter’s lips were swollen and pink, and his hair was even messier than usual. Draco could feel the beard rash on his cheeks and knew there would be dark bruises on his neck and collarbone already. He watched Harry’s eyes track down the marks he’d left and definitely didn’t imagine the satisfaction in his eyes.
“Of course, sir,” Harry said as he followed the Head Auror to his office. It was a large, luxurious room. He gestured for Harry to take a seat in one of the two polished wooden chairs on one side of his desk as he walked round and sank into the high-backed leather desk chair. Over his steepled fingers, he watched Harry sit down.
“You’ve definitely got a pretty good support net,” Harry said. “Which, speaking of, I ran into Pansy Parkinson the other day.”
Hermione smiled at him, and Harry sighed and nodded at the vacated armchair. “Sit down,” he said, and Draco did as ordered. “Hold your arms out — no, not like that, you’d drop her. Like you’re holding a baby.”
He pursed his lips and tilted his head to one side. “I have a few ideas that might work. Taboos are pretty easy to deal with, thankfully, but it’s the summoning thing I’m not sure what to do about… If you two just come and stand here, front and centre.”
They waved goodbye to the other three as they ducked into a side alley to Apparate back to their homes. Besides their modest country home, Pansy’s parents owned a townhouse in Marylebone which she’d moved into after the war, desperate to forge a new life away from them. It had saved the Slytherins multiple times when they’d drunk too much at Greg’s to Apparate and so stumbled back to Pansy’s instead. The half an hour walk would take at least double that in their intoxicated state — partly because they kept making wrong turns, but mostly because of the godly peri peri chicken Muggle restaurant on the way.
“I put my entire hand in her vagina at one point, I don’t think it’s unreasonable that we’re on a first-name basis now.”
They walked back towards Harry’s as Rolf explained the mating rituals of yetis (confusing and, frankly, terrifying) and imitated some of their grunting calls, attracting strange looks from passersby. Ten minutes away from Grimmauld Place, the other two left Harry to browse an outdoor shop for some cross-country skis.
Ron pulled his head from the fire and ran his hands through his hair, dislodging bits of kindling. He froze for a moment as he took in Draco holding his daughter.
ed his work from the mannequin and kicked the door shut, closing the sewing room off from view of any customers who had a habit of ignoring the signs to keep out and interrupt his work. Although he wouldn’t mind being distracted from the robes he was working on.
Ginny didn’t appear upset though, she just rolled her eyes at him. Now he wasn’t her boyfriend, she was a lot more lenient with him.
“Please call me Harry,” he said, feeling more and more ancient every time Maggie called him ‘Mister’.
“Neck, fifteen-point-eight,” he said, after a few calming breaths. His voice sounded normal enough but he still wandered over to the Quill to check the measurements it had recorded so far — though it had never been wrong before, it didn’t hurt to be careful, he reasoned.
Once everyone had finished eating, Hermione took the plates to the kitchen sink while Harry boiled a kettle for tea as Ron and Ginny went out to the garden to blast away the carnivorous mushrooms before they attracted gnomes. It was a comfortable, well-practiced dance.
Still trying to put on the final robe, Harry scuttled from the changing cubicle. The material felt flimsy, and there were a few threads hanging down across his hands and dragging on the floor. Silver pins glinted in the seams. He walked with his arms held out and his legs wide to avoid tearing anything. It felt like everything would unravel with one wrong move.
working on it, alongside the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts department. You can be spared for a few hours a week to work on other projects, which have been given so you can get used to multi-tasking and delegating.”
“Yeah. Thanks, Potter.” Theo’s voice was nasal and his hand flew to his face to try and stem the steady flow of blood from his nose. Draco tossed him one of his spare handkerchiefs.
Malfoy did nothing to assuage his awkwardness. He pointed to a small cubicle set into the wall with a heavy velvet curtain pulled aside. A set of robes hung on a hook.
“Must have been a big problem to upstage the birth of your best friend’s first child,” Belinda said, and Harry laughed awkwardly.
He didn’t remember giving the plan much thought: the burial was to be held at the Manor at five o’clock that evening, so after work he went home to grab a nondescript black robe and then Apparated straight there. Crucially, he hadn’t stopped in the kitchen, where he might have glanced at the calendar hanging on the wall and the circle around the day’s date:
Someone paused by the door, interrupting his train of thought. He watched their blurred shape through the glass, hovering with a hand raised, poised and ready to knock. They hesitated and lowered their hand. Annoyed, he marched over and yanked it open, causing a startled Ambrose to jump back.
He clenched his teeth and looked away from Harry, his eyes landing on the splinching posters. He stared at the diagram of the person messily torn in half from right shoulder to left hip: head in one half, heart on the other. Could a person survive that?
“What are you doing?” Potter grunted. He was holding his wand — not pointing it at Draco, but the implication was still there.
Bile rose in his throat, coating his mouth with its acrid taste. He clenched his teeth against the urge to vomit and drew in a sharp breath.
Harry took them and hurriedly pulled them on, eager to regain some modesty, then a shirt. That was about the number of layers Harry was used to. If he threw on a travelling cape, it was an ordinary outfit.
Desperately, Draco tried to find the exit, but everywhere he turned, Harry triumphantly stared back. He was enshrined in marble, showing off the Quidditch Cup. He was riding on the back of a dragon. He was in a bathroom, standing over a boy with a ferocious expression and the floor was painted red…
Draco swallowed hard and once again, the dark clouds were hanging heavily overhead and it was only him and a modest row of empty seats — just in case someone arrived.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and stepped closer to adjust the weird, upright collars. Harry blinked, not sure where to look as Malfoy fussed around his neck — no one had been that close to him since… Well, since Malfoy had measured him and before that it must have been months. When had he and Ginny ended it?
“Of course I do but leaving you alone right now will just add to the never-ending list of unforgivable things I’ve done to hurt you.”
With little else to do, he made his way down to the great hall where a few Hufflepuffs were already eating breakfast. He sat alone at the Gryffindor table and tried to force a few spoonfuls of porridge into his churning stomach, groaning when he realised that he had potions again that afternoon. At least Hermione’s accusing glances couldn’t get any worse and thank Merlin she didn’t know it was Malfoy of all people that had left him like that.
Hermione and Luna had both been right. He was an idiot and he acted impulsively and without concern of what his actions meant for everyone else.
He shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts of Harry and chocolate cake. That way madness lay. His eyes fell on the shell in his hands, surprised it was still there and still in motion. There was something distinctly odd to it. How he kept forgetting it was around, how he hadn’t been able look away from the glow, which had vanished since the night before.
“You’ll regret this Harry, I promise you, you’ll regret those words! And don’t you dare come crawling back to me if she realises what an ass you are and won’t have you anymore!” She shouted as she rushed from the room, grabbing her coat as she went and slamming the front door behind her. The resounding crash still reverberated around the house when the rain of tiny flecks of plaster falling from the wall and ceilings ceased, making the hallway look like it had been hit by a miniature blizzard.
Draco shook his head. He thought he knew what Harry was talking about, but surely it couldn’t be right.
It’s the sudden desperation in Draco’s voice that is tearing Harry apart inside. He wants to stop Draco from hurting, but it seems like he is the cause of that hurt, the only way to help him is for Harry to leave. He stares at Draco’s motionless form until the house elf begins to drag him away.
Potter cleared his throat and looked anywhere but at Draco, who was again facing the doors, which closed just shy of the first hand stretched out towards them.
Draco would have never thought that he would ever resent his mother. But at this very moment as he walked beside the man he might at least be slightly interested in, but who was only there out of a sense of obligation, Draco wished that he could have stayed oblivious of all the facts a little while longer.
As far as it went, this was the worst Christmas Draco could remember. There were some viable choices for second and third place, like when a certain hairless wizard had taken over their home and even his mother had felt awkward decorating the tree in fat happy cupids, or that time little Draco had had a nightmare about not getting any presents and accidentally set the tree on fire. This year however… Draco didn’t even know where to start or whom or what to berate first. He sighed.
The parchment fell from his limp fingers, sailing to the ground as if in slow motion. Draco had fretted for days about whether he’d exposed too much of himself in that letter, whether he’d come across as too needy. And now it had been returned unopened like the one before it.
“You don’t mean that. Tell me that you don’t mean that Draco!” He didn’t even care how pathetically pleading his voice sounded.
Harry walked up to the bar and ordered a cider and the first type of pub grub on the menu. He didn’t really mind what he got, as long as it was warm and he didn’t have to make it himself. Looking through the pub revealed several of the men in the room to be fishermen, discussing today’s catch and complaining about the strong currents that appeared every autumn, making the navigation of the passage out to the open sea treacherous and nerve-wracking. Feeling was slowly returning to his limbs, the low beamed ceiling keeping in the heat and the beer warming him from inside. When the food arrived it turned out to be some local variation of a cottage pie with a side order of chips and a sad looking salad consisting of three tomato slices, half a carrot and a limp piece of lettuce. Despite its appearance the food was delicious and it wasn’t long before Harry put his cutlery to the side, ordering another beer.
The pain obviously floods back into the areas where the curse is still active, but everything else remains unaffected. They are on the right track.
Harry can’t show up at Malfoy Manor without hard proof of the conspiracy he knows is going on inside the Ministry and it’s tearing him up inside. Weeks pass and still there is nothing going on and still no word from Draco either. Millicent comes by his office several times but they don’t really do anything but talk about how fucked up everything is, them included. Eventually Millicent brings a bottle of Firewhiskey and despite his better judgement Harry helps her empty the whole bottle. He’s never been drunk at work and rather than getting caught he decides to apparate home. Splicing be damned. It’d probably hurt less than his heart does even thinking about Draco.
Harry’s boots were warm and comfortable, he enjoyed walking along the cliffs, glancing down at the shore below, wondering whether any of the driftwood he could see was from some old ship that hadn’t been able to navigate despite the lighthouse. The sea was rough promising cliffs and other dangers beneath its surface. The view gave him pause and he unfolded the map he had taken with him. The island depicted on the map should have been directly in front of him, he had certainly walked far enough by now. Even if the scale was completely off, which Harry decided it really couldn’t have been, he should have been able to see it. Maybe the island had been worn down by the elements. It must have been made of chalk like the rest of the white cliffs.
Harry leaned in for a quick kiss and whispered against Draco’s lips, “I love it when you say my name!” Draco smiled and kissed him in return.
Draco was stunned for a moment, so stunned in fact that he missed the rest of Harry’s proposal. He was fairly certain though that Harry would have sounded earnest and endearing, a bit like a fortune cookie. Harry was looking at him with wide eyes and only the slight tremble in his hands gave him away. Draco realised it was his turn to say something. So he did, only he didn’t use words at all.
Well, who was he to complain about Muggle Monday, at least Harry had made an exception today, leaving the knitting circle early and actually agreeing on flying – apparition would probably have been too much like using magic, while flying was the wizarding equivalent of taking the tube. If only Dobby hadn’t been there.
Months had passed since Harry had handed the parcel over to Parkinson and he had given up hope. She probably hadn’t even given it to Draco like she’d said she would and incinerated it on the spot. Or maybe it simply hadn’t worked; maybe it hadn’t been enough to convince Draco that what had existed between them was worth salvaging.
Draco remembered intending to throw the small scroll away but never quite managing to. He’d folded it neatly and tucked it into his wallet at the time. Unbeknownst to Harry, it was still there, still treasured even though it was only the first of many such notes Harry had sent him over the years. No matter what happened, even if it would only serve as a painful reminder of what they’d had and what he’d foolishly thrown away, Draco knew that it would stay with him till the day he died.
When he felt Draco’s prick nudge against his hole, he shivered in anticipation. This was it. This was the moment he’d been waiting for. Draco pushed slowly inside, his prick feeling huge and stretching Harry so far it hurt. All breath left his lungs in a hiss and Draco stopped moving with only the head of his cock buried. The burn subsided faster than Harry would have thought possible.
“You are hurting me Potter. I sure hope you treat your prisoners better than your charges…” Draco could feel his lips curl into a sneer.
Ginevra had been gone for almost two weeks and Draco was spending more time with Harry than ever before. Harry had taken it into his head that Draco was too pale and needed to be out in the sunshine more.  He’d taken two weeks off work and insisted he needed Draco’s help in cleaning out Grimmauld Place’s back garden and reclaiming the overgrown area from nature. Manual labour had never been particularly appealing to Draco, but he had to give it to Harry that being outside in the sunshine working with plants, nurturing new life and giving shape to chaos was cathartic.
They took their time undressing each other and finally fell into bed. Their lovemaking was tender and slow, both of them mapping each other’s body with care and committing every piece of skin revealed, every word uttered and every whimper and moan to memory. Sated they finally curled up beside each other, neither wanting to spend the rest of the night alone.
It really hurt. He knew he was lucky that he hadn’t cut any tendons, but with his luck recently, he probably had infected himself with some rare disease. He had had enough of research and adventures for one day and viciously kicked against the desk. A sharp pain shot through his foot, causing him to heavily lean onto the desktop trying to keep his balance, while he desperately hoped that he hadn’t just broken his toe.
He could feel Draco’s breathing change through the hand that was still resting against his chest, the man was waking up. Harry knew he should remove his hands from Draco’s lips but he couldn’t make himself. He could feel those gorgeous lips stretch into a smile under his fingers and was rewarded with a kiss to each fingertip, before Draco opened his eyes.
Harry looked away, not leaning into but also not withdrawing from Draco’s touch. All the fight had gone out of him, his entire posture one of defeat.
“What were you hoping for?” Draco asked. He had to know, he couldn’t just let Harry walk away. Especially if what he said was true and it seemed like whatever had restrained him from telling the truth in Draco’s room had been lifted, as Harry had been speaking freely all this time. If the only reason he had lied to Draco was because he had wanted to keep him safe, that changed a lot.
“So, you are saying the first thing you did, after breaking up with her was seek me out to mend fences?”
He felt the warmth of Harry’s skin seeping into his, as he drew soothing circles over his marred skin and then traced the pattern of the twisting snake to the mouth of the skull and back again. Somehow a simple drink after work had become uncomfortably intense. Draco reached for his glass of firewhiskey to calm his nerves and accidentally spilled some of it on Harry’s sleeve, causing him to withdraw both his hands. He brought the glass carefully to his lips and took a gulp swallowing quickly without savouring the flavour, before looking at Harry again.
Love was supposed to be this gentle fragile thing, but his mother knew to wield it like a blade and as much as he appreciated it being wielded in his defence, it still terrified him sometimes. He was twenty-six years old and as far from settling down as he had ever been, and he was still scared of his mother.
There was another pop, this one quieter than Harry’s arrival, who still seemed to do everything with a bit of fanfare, without even being aware of it.
“Promise me you will not do any such thing Draco! Promise me you’ll stop yourself whenever the urge to jump overcomes you. Give yourself some time, things will get better and your feelings will change. We all need to deal with this brave new world; it’s a world we need to create together, to make it better. Who cares what side of the war you were on, this is our chance to make the world right again and you need to be part of it to make it work.” Even Harry was surprised at the conviction in his voice. He was clueless about what the future held for him.
Draco could have very well Apparated back by himself, but for some reason Harry wanted to take him back and Draco didn’t mind, not really.
Draco was sitting propped up against several pillows, his eyes closed, listening to the sound of Potter’s voice as he was reading to him from one of the books Granger had brought over a few days previously. He didn’t even pay attention to the particular words, just enjoyed the sound and flow of them coming out of Potter’s mouth. He was content, but something nagging at the back of his mind still bothered him.
Harry had run out of options. He wrote a letter to Mrs. Malfoy explaining that Draco refused to see him and that he had no means of keeping his word if he didn’t have access to the Malfoy heir. After sending Sophia off with the missive, Harry felt dirty, like he had betrayed some kind of trust by betraying Draco to his own mother. But it wasn’t like Draco was giving him much choice.
He knows they are causing a commotion. His breeding kicks in and he tries to calm the angry creatures around him down, but every calming motion seems to only aggravate them further and all his apologetic words vanish unheard in yet another stream of bubbles. Draco feels scared again as more of them crowd around him and as if that wasn’t bad enough the air begins to grow cold.
“So, basically, my theory is that whoever they were, they terra-formed our planet, which caused at least one of the mass extinctions. Their planet is a lot like earth. Our planet is a bit colder and we’ve got more landmass, but otherwise they are suspiciously alike.”
Draco watched his body lift its arms at the appropriate moments. He saw more than felt his friend cast a heating charm on his skin. The skin must have been ice cold, if her shrinking away from him was any indication.
Potter came ever closer and Draco was both afraid and excited of what might happen if he let Potter touch him again.
It was exhausting to play by a set of rules that kept blurring and changing, he didn’t even know whether these were rules of friendship, of former enemy-ship or a budding relationship. Draco doubted that even Harry could tell. The only thing he knew was that neither of them seemed to be able to do terribly well without the other in their lives to challenge them.
“It’s not that I don’t care, I care about how it affects you, but I’ve always thought of us as a forever kind of thing, where at some point we’ll be so old and wrinkly that the only people who’ll say they are attracted to us will be each other.”
“Thanks for your help. I’ll let you know if I find anything else and you’ll keep me updated if one of your patients is willing to talk to me?”
It was like a fog had cleared. Draco remembered everything. He was too overwhelmed to speak for a moment when it all came together. He looked down at Harry again and finally realised why the black knight in the dream had seemed so familiar.
While Parkinson hadn’t gone into details, she had strongly hinted at there being more just like her, both men and women who had been less lucky than her, who had to go to St Mungo’s after what had happened to them and who had been encouraged not to go to the Aurors. Hermione had suggested they both go back and talk to people to see who would be willing to report what had happened to them, at least to Harry that is, possibly even anonymously to protect them.
The dew clung to Draco’s hair and eyelashes, making them sparkle in the bright light. His entire body was covered in tiny drops of water, the light from Harry’s wand turning them into liquid diamonds as it hit them.
Harry sees Luna’s fists clenched at her side; not punching him again appears to be a conscious effort on her part.
Draco is a still as a statue before he nods in response, he gently frees himself from Harry’s grip and beckons Harry to follow him.
Draco found he agreed, but instead of telling Potter he was right, Draco simply took off his shoes, folded his socks and carefully stashed them in his footwear, before helping Potter to do the same.
“No, but whatever happened to you last night, the diary is part of it. I just had to shake you for a full two minutes before you even knew I was here.”
Every evening in the park the phial and its allure became stronger, but he’d made a promise, he would wait.
Draco remembered eating it and then trying to leave the house. Last night had really been full of ups and downs.
She makes him sit in one of Luna’s comfortable armchairs and hands him a mug of hot tea before sitting down in the only other available chair, sipping from her own mug. Silence stretches between them and Harry feels powerless to it. Somehow in this entire bizarre situation, Millicent is the only one that seems able to break the silence, which she apparently chooses not to.
During the next few days, Harry became an even more permanent fixture in Draco’s life, reading to him during the day, even though Draco was recovering quickly and would have been perfectly able to read by himself and cradling him protectively by night. Suspecting Harry enjoyed the shared activity as much as Draco did, he didn’t say anything.
“Oh, I think their boredom should be none of your concern. There are so many more interesting things right here,” he replied while squeezing Draco’s leg.
The entire day and its horrific ending had left him exhausted. It wasn’t even time for dinner yet, but Draco was too tired to even make his apologies to his mother. He sank down on his bed, barely awake enough to cover himself and immediately fell asleep, his last thoughts on the diary and what might have happened to it.
“Sometimes I wish I could exchange my life for all of their suffering. Maybe things would have been better if I’d died with my parents.”
Harry’s gaze was guarded as he approached. He seemed agitated and Draco had no idea how to deal with it.
Draco’s stomach tightened in anticipation. This could mean anything. Usually Harry would come by himself and deliver his instructions. Maybe it was time for his final review… instead of worrying himself further he decided to just go over to Harry’s office and see what he wanted.
Harry showered and changed, getting ready for dinner with Draco, trying to convince himself that this was by no means a date, but rather a friendly get-together. It was an important reminder, especially in the light of Harry’s churning guilt. Somehow everything had become tainted and no matter how much he tried to push it away and chalk it up to drunkenness, he had lied to Draco that very morning and was left with nagging doubts. That fact alone made it impossible for them to ever be anything other than friends, no matter how much Harry wanted it to be different.
“I never really got to see that directed at me, while we were at Hogwarts and after the war I only ever saw you from a distance.”
“You are safe now, Draco. I’m here and I won’t leave. Don’t ever scare me like that again!” Whoever held him appeared to be too overwhelmed by their emotions to continue.
And finally, hearing his name spoken with such reverence, Draco smiled. “I think you’d better come inside Harry, we have a lot to discuss.”
“…with a fucking toothbrush no less. What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you know the kind of trouble I could get in, if this gets out? Abuse of a prisoner under my care… If Hermione ever finds out… No Ron, I am not finished. Go. Go home to your girlfriend and let me deal with this mess you’ve made. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”
“Great.” Harry seemed to relax and then held out his hands for Draco to take. They were warm and dry against his skin. He felt foolish standing there, holding hands like a child.
Harry unravels the strand all the way up to Draco’s cheek and has to sit on his chest to keep him still. The sickly yellow light floats up and then disperses in a shower of sparks. Both of them are panting from exertion.
Harry shrugged in reply, but he had to admit to himself that not much of the snarky prat he remembered from school and from the morning after the incident at the pub had survived the change that had slowly come over Draco.
Harry ran his hand along the doorframe, enjoying the rough texture as he stepped over the threshold. Inside the lighthouse was dark and quieter than he had anticipated. The sound of the wind was almost inaudible. Once his eyes had adjusted to the darkness, Harry saw a card and a bottle of something or other standing in the middle of a rickety table. A quickly cast Lumos revealed the bottle to be a cheap brand of firewhiskey and the note written by the previous owners, wishing him luck.
Sophia’s anxious fluttering of her wings made him open his eyes again and look around himself. He was in a small attic room, half of the ceiling had collapsed, most likely when he had barrelled into one of the rotten beams, which had then graciously enough, knocked him out for his efforts. It was hard to see by the light from the observatory, because every tiny movement would cause a cloud of dust to rise and obscure everything. Draco could make out a desk and some shelves on the other side of the room, which stood beneath a filthy window, its glass too caked with dust due to years of neglect to let in any light at all. How strange was it that nobody had even known of this room’s existence?
Like every day for months, Draco had waited till everyone else had left. Harry watched him carefully glancing around the room before making his way to the exit. Draco was easy to follow, he always took the same way home, making one stop in a park and then walking back to his flat. The fact that the Wizengamot  although pronouncing Draco “not guilty” had found it necessary to place a binding charm on him that prevented him from apparating made it even easier for Harry to follow him home.
“Draco, I told you I wouldn’t leave you.” Potter said as if that was explanation enough, not even commenting on Draco’s use of his surname.
This was seriously the worst, sure, Draco had experienced his fair share of hexes and curses directed at him and had inflicted quite a few in revenge, or if he was completely honest, in jest, but never had he faced a curse quite like this. He had not told Harry, but even his pubic hair was gone, he had checked the day it happened and somehow that had freaked him out even more than his lack of eyelashes or eyebrows had when he had first seen his reflection in a hastily conjured mirror.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…” but Draco doesn’t let him finish. He realises that he doesn’t need to hear the words. He knows he’s forgiven the man already. And just like he knows that, Draco also knows that the man will never leave him now. He is all Draco’s and they will never be parted again.
The thought of just how much Draco meant to him was what finally drove him out of the bed they’d shared for what had been left of the night. He was terrified of the strength of the emotion running through him. He wasn’t ready to name it yet, let alone come to terms with it.
It took him longer to cross the room and descend the stairs than he anticipated, but he had to stop every now and then because his legs threatened to give out. Sophia had alighted on his shoulder again as if she owned it. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he sank down and leant against the banister.
One of Harry’s special memos materialised in front of him, startling him just as he was about to slam the stamp down on another report. Instead the memo ended up with an ‘EJECTED’ stamped across it. After scratching at the red paint with a letter opener for a minute or two, Draco was able to make out the writing.
It was past noon when Draco woke and he should have been back at work, but somehow he couldn’t bring himself to care. He stretched his long limbs, enjoying the feeling of every little twinge that served as a reminder to the activities of the night before.
Draco couldn’t reply and only nodded, acutely aware of everywhere they were touching. Potter’s hands on his hips almost stinging, as if he was trying to imprint his brand of ownership on Draco. And for the shortest moment Draco allowed himself the thought that he didn’t quite mind as much as he pretended to. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself and relaxed further into Potter.
“Could you take this to my friend Hermione, please? And tell her to test it for magical signatures? It’s urgent.”
The part of him that was still trapped in that horrible moment in the shop where Harry had taken Draco’s heart so freely given and crushed it, hadn’t cared. That part would throw itself at Harry’s feet, begging for another chance, begging to be let back into his life.
Harry reaches up to touch the back of Draco’s hand, it feels ridged in parts and then soft and sticky, like it’s covered in mucus.
“Sorry Ferret, Harry isn’t in today. He’ll not be around for another week if you must know. He’s enjoying some well deserved time off with my sister. I am sure that gets your poncy knickers all in a twist considering how you’ve been all over him lately. But lucky for you, he’s not interested in the likes of you. Now, get to it!” Weasley had shouted the last two words, forcing Draco to take both the instructions and the toothbrush. He crushed Draco’s fingers around the items so hard it hurt, making unwanted tears of pain spring into Draco’s eyes. Weasley leaned close, still not letting go of Draco’s hands and whispered into his ear. “Don’t make me teach you your place Ferret.”
After that awkward morning, Harry saw Malfoy more often, but only from afar, around the village, in the fields and most often down on the seashore, carrying a folder of some kind with him and obviously searching for something. They never talked, only ever nodding at each other in recognition, if their gazes caught over the distance.
Draco huffed and tried to disentangle himself from Harry’s embrace, not getting far as Harry’s arms immediately tightened around him. And if he was honest with himself, he hadn’t really been trying all that hard.
“Here, look,” he said and went to show Harry how to effectively twirl the fork in the noodles and wind them around it without making a mess and ending up with a bite sized amount of pasta on the fork.
“You have hands like an aristocrat!” Awe filled Harry’s voice. “I have peasant hands. No wonder I’m so clumsy all the time.”
Draco made is way over to the small figure and smiled when he saw the red dot next to the plaque listing, date of completion, material and provenance. As he leaned closer to inspect the figure once more someone bumped into him and almost made him drop his drink. Draco felt himself fall forward into the sculpture and could already see it smash in front of his inner eye, when someone grabbed his robe and yanked him backwards into a warm and hard chest. When Draco turned around, the first thing he saw was a big frizzy head of hair and it took a moment for him to realise that it was because Hermione Granger was standing beside Potter who was still holding onto him.
“I see they were all out of manners when they threw you together,” Malfoy said and slumped down at the table. However the prat managed to make even that motion look graceful was beyond Harry.
“I’ve read the family chronic too, Draco. Your mother showed it to me. The book cannot be damaged by Muggle or magical means. There are no pages missing.”
Harry was surprised at the wave of relief he felt at Malfoy’s words. He watched the other man stride through the field for a little while longer, before he let his feet carry him back to the lighthouse.
They sat there, time passing slowly and the awkward silence growing to something almost tangible. Draco sighed in annoyance and Potter flinched.
“You won’t believe…” Harry fell silent. “No, you know what, I was going to get you, but I’m going to take care of this right here, right now.”
She was standing in the hallway beside her packed bags, her demeanour painfully remindful of Draco’s departure years earlier. So it was starting, they would all leave him soon and the empty soulless being he had become didn’t know how to stop the people he loved from leaving him, short of tying them up and hiding them away inside his house forever.
The other man angrily pulled up the shirt sleeve of his left arm shoving the tainted skin into Harry’s face.
“I’ll put it on your tab then, Mr. Potter, shall I?” The bartender said, raising an eyebrow at the display in front of him and Harry found himself nodding dumbfounded before he took a sip of his own ridiculously sweet cocktail.
“What do you want me to say, oh Learned One,” Draco replied, wanting it to sound sarcastic to get a bit of his own back, but what came out sounded nothing but breathy and desperate. Maybe how buggered he was, wasn’t something he should be thinking about right now.
“Harry!” he whimpered into Harry’s mouth between kisses. Draco was clutching the man’s shirt hard enough for the fabric to be at its tearing point. For the first time in months he couldn’t take it any longer and took charge. He pushed Harry away and kept pushing him backwards until they encountered the small ugly sofa at the back of the office. Draco pushed Harry down on it and climbed into his lap straddling him so their crotches were pressed firmly together. Harry’s hands were on Draco’s arse and he was moaning into Draco’s mouth whenever Draco moved his pelvis, causing their cocks to slide against each other through the thick fabric.
“Come on, we have to go, we’ll be late for dinner!” She shot Draco a filthy look as if to say that she was quite convinced that he’d taint her precious saviour by proximity alone. “Hurry up, mum won’t be in a forgiving mood if we are late for no reason again.”
As much as Harry wants Luna to be wrong, the fact that no investigation had followed such an obvious attack leaves him very few options. He’s an Auror, he has a responsibility to society to serve and protect. Even to those members of society that have less than a clean slate and might not deserve it. Which is why he begins to look further into attacks against former Death Eaters or because he begins to worry about Albus, against members of Slytherin house. Strangely, he doesn’t find any further reports. When he digs a little deeper, what he finds are reports on accidents, to investigate those further, he will have to requisition data from other branches of government which would mean starting a paper trail.
After he was finished, he placed the closed and addressed envelope on the kitchen table and made his way up to the bedroom. He would have to go back to the Village tomorrow, to find out where the closest post office was.
“Merlin, but aren’t you thick! I said that I wasn’t coming downstairs unless you’d give me shoes or slippers of some kind. The floor everywhere is sticky and frankly, I don’t even want to know what makes me stick to the floor. All I want is distance between my bare skin and it.” Malfoy said making air quotation marks around the word “it”.
After the firecall Harry slumps into his favourite armchair and fills a tumbler with firewhiskey. He doesn’t drink it right away, just sits there staring into the now orange flames, trying to figure out where the hell he went wrong in raising his son, that he became a Slytherin. It has to be his fault. Ginny had always been kind to the children and even to Harry when he had confessed to her after the final battle that all he wanted was a family, but that he wasn’t in love with her, never had been. Somehow she had been ok with having children with him and living as friends and parents. It couldn’t have been her.
Draco gasped for air and almost wept with joy at the taste of sweet dusty oxygen on his tongue. There was a commotion outside and Draco began calling for help. His hands were grasping in the dark, trying to find his wand, to no avail.
Despite the constant glamour that he wore that ate at his skin and left him in agony for hours afterwards, he felt like an impostor, like everyone was staring at him, like they all knew what he was hiding from them. In the end, Draco was unable to differentiate between dream and reality, withdrawing completely from society. The glamour though stayed on, there were too many reflective surfaces in his home and no escaping what whoever had attacked him had turned him into.
Harry had chosen his favourite Sicilian restaurant to put himself at ease while trying to get more information out of Draco. It was only when Draco flat-out stated that this wasn’t a date that Harry had realised just how much he had wanted it to be. He had blushed and the rest of the evening had been so awkward that for the first time Draco didn’t seem to be the only person that actually wanted to go home early. But what choice did Harry have.
“Don’t be like that.” Harry murmured planting a series of wet open mouthed kissed along Draco’s jaw line and neck, before suddenly fiercely pressing him to his chest. “Come home with me.” He whispered into the shell of Draco’s ear, causing a strangled moan to escape him.
Harry was just getting ready to meet Draco for a Quidditch match that they had both meant to attend anyway and found they already had purchased tickets to see, when an unfamiliar owl pecked against the window. Harry let it inside and retrieved the letter tied to its leg. The owl gave one disdainful look at Sophia’s water dish and owl treats and left without helping itself to either.
“Oh Lord… Oh Merlin…” Oh God, he was being fucked by a tongue. It was inside him and wriggling, pulling in and out and so slick and
“Good morning Draco.” Harry said pleasantly beckoning him over. “Come on, have a seat and have breakfast with us.”
So Harry told him, in stinted sentences, about the dreams he had been having, about the strange noises and the scratches on his door and about his experiences in the village.
“I am glad, because this gives us a chance to get to know each other better. And I really want to, get to know you better I mean. Do you want to come and have dinner with us?” Harry asked sounding like he was grasping at straws to come up with a reason to prolong their encounter.
Harry was beginning to worry that he was losing his mind. He actually began to treasure the moments when he caught Malfoy’s eye and the man nodded back at him. It was as if Harry had somehow ceased to exist in people’s memories. And there was something else. A feeling like a creeping menace that came in from the sea and getting stronger every day, like a terrible smell full of death and decay carried on the wind.
“Alright Potter, hand it over. I’ll give it to him, but I expect you to keep your word and stay the fuck away from him.” She grabbed the parcel and slammed the door in his face, making him feeling foolish as his ‘thank you’ went unheard.
Furious with himself for how shaky his voice sounded Draco replied: “I am sure you’d like that Weasley, but I am really not into that, especially with poverty stricken red-haired wankers like yourself.” He tried to free himself to no avail. “Now let go of my hands!”
The entire scene felt staged and Harry knew it was only a question of time before the accusations would start flying. If it wasn’t one thing, then it was another. Lately nothing he did or didn’t do seemed to be enough to make her happy. He absently wondered how long it would be this time until she acknowledged his presence. If he was honest with himself, he didn’t really care anymore. Quickly tiring of her act, it was him who spoke first.
“You probably think it’s strange that I still have house elves, don’t you Potter. Especially with that Granger friend of yours.”
Scorpius was excitedly tugging his luggage along while Draco carried the cage containing his son’s snow owl. Much like the one Potter used to have. Draco hadn’t liked the idea, but when he had seen the joy in Scorpius’ face, he hadn’t had the heart to say no. Not everything was about Potter after all. Although Draco was having a hard time going even a day without thinking about him. Potter had made sure that he wouldn’t.
While Draco removed his own and gracefully stepped out of them, Harry scrambled off the sofa, almost toppling over when he got entangled in one of his trouser legs, because he couldn’t get them off fast enough. Apparently the man had some idea of what was going to happen next.
Pansy had come by on Christmas Day and made him observe all the traditional wizarding customs before getting him roaring drunk and taking him to London with her, encouraging him to take someone home with him. He’d let a bloke suck him off but hadn’t taken him back to the Manor. Of course he’d spent that night, like so many others, alone in his bed. The only person he wanted to share his bed with didn’t want to be with him, and if he couldn’t have Harry, he didn’t want to have anyone. He’d only been able to come earlier that night, because he’d squeezed his eyes shut just so that he could pretend it was Harry on his knees in front of him.
“No, there’s another department that’s already working on that. I’m focussing on domestic violence between adults.”
“No, Minnie, it’s fine, you’re forbidden from ironing your ears or punishing yourself in any other way. You’ve served your master well, thank you.”
Draco shrugs, it is entirely possible. Even this fleeting reminder of what could have been the source of the noise makes his skin crawl. As Harry begins to draw his wand, Draco shakes his head furiously, pointing at a small fresh pile of plaster dust to their right emphatically. “No magic” he mouths and arms himself with an old table leg instead. Harry follows suit and they slowly creep towards where they have heard the noise the first time. The darkness does not follow them.
“You’re lucky that I don’t take offence as easily as you do. As it happens, my owl spends more time with you than I do. And as far as I know she’s not trying to be friends with you.”
As they talked Potter moved ever closer. First there were tiny shifts of his legs and then little by little he covered the distance between them, until he was flush against Draco’s side. Draco tried to follow Potter’s narrative but was distracted by covertly having to push against him, trying to keep him at bay. In an attempt to get to the story straight, Draco decided to ask some simple questions, repeating what Potter had said earlier.
The mantelpiece was lined with delicate china figurines and maybe to spite the elf, Harry stepped up to them and was just about to pick one up, when the sound of the door opening behind him made him jump. Only the tight reign he had on himself stopped him from babbling out something as embarrassing as “I wasn’t touching anything, I swear.”
He quickly looks behind himself as he runs and there just out of arms reach is a dark-masked rider on a horse reaching for him and shouting for Draco to come with him. But Draco only runs faster. He casts another look over his shoulder and suddenly the rider is held in place by fast-growing vines that shoot out of the ground faster than he can cut them down. Draco doesn’t look back a third time.
“I’ve booked a seat at my favourite restaurant. It’s a Muggle restaurant, so we’ll have to walk part of the way.”
“Do you have to shout like that?” Harry asked, seeing the morning shag he had been promised vanish into the distant future, if it even still was on the table at all.
“Harry, where have you been? I’ve been looking all over for you. I was worried something had happened.”
“I… may I come in Harry?” Stay calm and stick with the plan he told himself, trying to not to show just how much Harry’s coldness was affecting him.
An emotion he hadn’t felt since he’d returned to awareness made him wonder idly how hard it would be to get his hands on another phial like the one he’d had before.
He splashed cold water into his face, trying to calm his shaking hands. Watching his reflection in the mirror and following the rivulets of water slowly trickling down his face with his eyes, Harry realized that he was scared. Scared of what the future held, scared for Draco’s life and most of all scared of how far this obsession would take him.
He stalked out into the dark, his wand raised with a Lumos as the wind beat his parka around his slim frame.
“No, Draco, you keep it. You deserve it.” Harry smiled and then took out his wand and cast a quick stasis charm on it. “So it’ll stay fresh longer.”
Draco tenderly reached for his neck, trying to massage the crick out of it. He turned his head left and right to loosen the muscles and on his second turn he saw the eerie light again that he had last seen in the room adjoining the observatory. The glow came from the box on his nightstand. Draco retrieved it carefully. The box was heavier than it looked but for once seemed to be one of the few of Pyxis possessions that wasn’t locked or charmed. The lid opened easily and there, wrapped in thick layers of dark velvet, lay a conch shell that appeared to be suffused with a blue-tinted almost aquatic glow. This close the glow wasn’t eerie, it was rather mesmerising and without conscious thought Draco found himself reaching for the shell, taking it out of its container and running his fingers along the jagged outside to then slide them along the smooth inside.
Silence stretched between them only interrupted by the constant patter of the rain on Potter’s umbrella.
And so it had continued. Draco had shut himself away from the world more and more with every passing month, only going out to restock his potions supplies and even then only if he was running so low improvising wasn’t an option anymore.
Outside in the bright and warmth of a splendid summer’s day, the only thing that reassured him his encounter had been real was the comforting weight of his pocket watch settled in its rightful place in his waistcoat.
The pleasant respite is interrupted when a shadow falls across him. Harry reluctantly opens his eyes, a half-arsed excuse already on the tip of his tongue when he comes face to face with Draco Malfoy.
Harry carefully reached up, taking a hold of the shoulder he had squeezed so hard the night before. He shook him gently.
“But he never…” Draco pondered before continuing to speak. Then he pushed Harry away with a shove that was harder than intended and stood up. Harry followed him and tried to hold onto him. His fingers scrabbling for purchase against the fabric of Draco’s clothes. This time Draco didn’t push him further away than arms length. He looked him in the eyes to make sure he was listening.
Draco’s hand was holding onto Harry’s neck as his thumb caressed Harry’s cheek. Draco’s fingers skated over Harry’s skin with feathery touches and ended up tangled in Harry’s hair as Draco kissed him passionately. Harry revelled in the feeling of those fingers on his scalp, moaning softly into the kiss, as he gave himself over to Draco’s ministrations completely.
“I don’t care if I wake him” she said, her voice rising even more. “He doesn’t deserve to rest and recover after what he has done.”
Before he knew it the arms around him had disappeared and there was no sign of Harry. For a moment Draco wondered whether he had hallucinated the entire episode. His fingers reached for his lips which still tingled slightly and were still wet from Harry’s.
The books in front of him were all very old, their pages crackling when he turned them. All of them were on navigation and how that could relate to what was obviously happening to Draco, Harry didn’t know. Another book that Harry was eying thoughtfully was the Malfoy family history. Mrs. Malfoy had opened it for him, because it had turned out to be illegible if opened by someone not Malfoy by birth or marriage.
“Close enough I guess. I’m glad there is still something of the old Draco Malfoy left.” She winked at him.
“As upsetting as this may sound, this is not about you, as much as it is about everyone who went through the war.” Draco’s heart fell and his face must have given away some of his feeling, because Potter, smiling briefly, squeezed his shoulder reassuringly.
“I need to go home now, but I can’t leave you in this office unsupervised. Did you get what you needed? Otherwise you can always come back when I’m back in the office. Also you’ll still have those files I’ve requested be forwarded to your office.”
Every day was the same; he’d get up early, earlier than anyone else to beat the rush to the ministry. He’d put on his assistant librarian’s robes, drink a cup of lukewarm coffee as he couldn’t be bothered to apply a re-heating charm, grab his bag and head out the door of his entirely unremarkable second floor flat.
Those five little words finally pushed Harry into action. If he didn’t try to fix things now, to do something, anything to make Draco see, he wouldn’t get another chance.
Harry had been wandering aimlessly for over an hour, when he finally made up his mind. He had to do something about it, but before that, there was someone he had to see.
Harry took hold of Draco’s hand and spun him around. “Don’t Potter me, Draco, not after-,” he had to collect himself for a moment and then looked straight into Draco’s eyes,” not after everything that happened. Please don’t pretend things haven’t changed.”
Draco could feel Harry’s left hand sneaking underneath his partially untucked shirt, caressing the coarse pale blond hair that led downward from his bellybutton. Harry’s other hand was busily running along the unmistakable bulge at the front of Draco’s trousers. His nails were digging into the rough fabric as they traced the distinct shape of his cock, causing a moan to escape Draco with every upward motion of Harry’s hand.
Potter looked about ready to protest, but Draco somehow managed to expel several angry looking red sparks from his wand and Potter backed off. He sank to the floor in the corner opposite and Merlin help him, the man actually pouted at Draco.
“Well, face it, karma is a bitch! What do you expect me to do Potter? To just forgive and forget because you’ve been down on your luck?”
No sooner had he spoken and the entire space around them was taken up with glowing dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes, slowly moving around them, diving through the air or circling overhead. Harry couldn’t hold back the wonder. He whooped with joy and ran up to Draco, throwing his arms around him. They both kept gazing up at the ceiling for a while, enjoying the images of life that had long been gone from their planet before they or their families had even been born.
“Harry then, I have it from reliable sources that you have no plans for Christmas Eve, is that true?”
They hadn’t spoken in years, and the rational part of Harry knew that he had no right to show up like this, but the part of him that knew what Harry needed had brought him here. It made him knock.
Malfoy gestured to the empty barstool beside him and urged Harry with gestures to take a seat. The chairs were so close together that their thighs touched. Malfoy’s leg was warm against Harry’s and all of his senses were suddenly on high alert as he felt Malfoy rub his thigh alongside Harry’s own. Malfoy still talked, his demeanour giving nothing away. It seemed as if he didn’t even know he was doing it, but if anything it made Harry uncomfortable. Or so he told himself.
Somehow catapulted into motion, he found himself outside on his balcony, his arms stretched out in front of himself shaking them rapidly and letting the cool rain water soothe the ache in his hands. As soon as the rain touched the conch shell it fell to the floor and rolled clattering along the stone until it rested against the banister. Draco was almost too scared to look at his hands, because he feared what he might find. In the end uncertainty became worse than knowing and he turned them upwards into the rain, inspecting them closely.
Christmas and New Year had come and gone, seeing Harry alone inside of Grimmauld Place, sick and tired of making merry with his friends and surrogate family and pretending everything was all right, when it so clearly wasn’t. He had thrown himself back into work once the holidays were over and Kingsley had threatened to suspend him for the second time only a week ago, because Harry had fallen asleep at his desk one time too many again.
Panicked Draco turned around but for once luck was on his side and the coat Harry had chosen was the same one he would have picked. Instead of throwing a tantrum like a child, he admitted defeat and simply nodded.
Pansy must have taken him home, because now they were standing in the same drawing room as before. She was shaking him, but it all felt like it was happening to someone else.
Harry wonders whether she is implying that Draco is suicidal, or maybe it has something to do with why Harry wasn’t allowed to see whom Luna had spent her day with until he showed up. He grinds his teeth to calm himself as jealousy once again grips him.
It was dark by the time the knock came. Harry had been unable to settle down all day and was glad that the waiting was almost over. When he opened the door however, there was no one there. Harry looked around frantically but couldn’t see anyone. The sky was dark again and thunder sounded from the distance.
Wales? Draco couldn’t breathe. It was all true. It hadn’t been a nightmare, it had all really happened. But then what was Harry doing in his bed? Was he just some convenient plaything to the man? Or had last night been a farewell shag? The questions chased each other around in his mind as inside his heart turned to ice. His arms were still tightly curled around the man in his bed, but he couldn’t feel them anymore. Nothing made sense, he felt adrift in a sea of confusion and there was nobody he could turn to for advice. What was he supposed to do?
“I, …what? I don’t understand.” Harry whispered, clinging to Draco’s shoulders. Draco nuzzled the place behind Harry’s ear that he now knew drove him to distraction and then traced his nose along the shell of his ear, before beginning to speak. “You drank the potion, not me. You got yourself drunk and that’s why you couldn’t keep your naughty hands to yourself, but when I kissed you, all traces of the Firewhiskey and what was in it had already been washed from your system. You didn’t drug me, you understand?” Harry still looked confused when Draco pulled back.
Harry craved safety more than anything else and somehow having Malfoy in his home seemed like the best option. Malfoy looked at him enquiringly for a moment before shrugging and climbing into bed beside Harry.
Harry turns around and sees Draco already putting his clothes to right. The cold expression is back on his face. Harry feels vulnerable under Draco’s hard gaze and clumsily begins to get dressed in what remains of his clothes, while Draco’s sticky come starts to drip out of his hole. When, what amount of decency that can be accomplished is achieved, he doesn’t know what to do.
“It’s obvious these instructions aren’t from Potter, he’s the only one who’s allowed to delegate tasks to me. I want to speak to him.”
Draco felt like a complete fool. For some reason Dobby had seen fit to gift him with one of his knitted atrocities in front of Harry, which meant that now he could not take it off. Granted they were currently on their way to St Mungo's because some punks had seen fit to make all of his hair disappear and nothing he or Harry had done had made it grow back. Even his eyebrows were gone for Merlin's sake. Still, Draco had caught his reflection in the window and he was not sure the beanie was any better than no hair at all. If it had not been snowing quite so much and if his new lack of hair had not been so spell resistant that even simple weather protection spells were not working, Draco might have managed to wriggle out of it, but the mixture of Harry's worried expression, Hermione's earnest joy and Dobby's hopeful smile - that little shit - had totally done him in. He might have lived with the Dark Lord for several weeks, but Harry's disappointed face was something he was powerless against. Plus, it tended to be around for days and now that Draco had actually chosen to live with Harry it meant he would get to see it every day and probably dream about it too.
Pansy must have sent whoever it was away, because a few minutes later she returned, carrying a package and handed it over to Draco.
If he remembered correctly, nobody knew who they were or what their goal was. There was always some dark wizard on the rise somewhere. Harry certainly knew that, but Voldemort was dead and gone. He still wasn’t sure whether the reason nobody knew was because they actually didn’t know, or because Luna Lovegood had taken over editing of
“What is it Poxy?” Draco cringed inwardly at the name he’d given the house-elf when he was younger. He’d thought it funny at the time.
Draco panicked and scrambled off Harry’s lap quickly getting dressed and setting his clothes right, while Harry did the same.
“I went to the library trying to find you, but you’d already gone to bed. I wanted to apologise for Ron’s behaviour, he’s having a harder time moving on than others…”
In the end he chose the cowardly way out and Disapparated before Draco could respond in any way. Harry stood in front of Grimmauld Place, clutching the rusty banister with clammy sweaty hands waiting for the tremors to subside.
“I think we did it.” He said looking at his handiwork, not quite managing to keep a note of awe out of his voice. “Go ahead, have a look.”
There he was; his Harry, his saviour, the man who had not an hour ago stood in front of the Wizengamot and testified on his behalf. They’d argued with him about how Draco should have known better, how he was a marked Death Eater and needed to be punished for his actions, about how they needed to make an example of him, but Potter hadn’t given an inch. He’d talked about Draco’s youth, his circumstances at the time, about mistakes in education, about setting an example, about forgiving, about their responsibility to society to lead by example, and about giving this brave new wizarding world a chance to move on towards the light, finally laying the dark of the past to rest.
As it happened nobody had anything bad to say about their ceremony or wedding picture and if they did, neither Draco nor Harry found out, because nobody they knew subscribed to the Daily Prophet anymore and the article in the Quibbler was as expected bizarre but also strangely uplifting.
Silence stretches between them after that. Harry’s eyes are slowly getting used to the darkness in the room and he thinks he has correctly identified one of the shapes as Draco. He’s not sure if he should go over there or leave. Since he still hasn’t anything to show for the weeks without contact since they slept together, he decides to leave. Harry pats his pockets but can’t seem to locate his wand. The Draco shape speaks up again.
Something between them seemed off. The silence had become awkward and Draco didn’t know where to look or how to make it alright again. He wanted to ask why Harry had returned his letter unopened, but he was scared of what the answer might be.
“No, seriously, don’t you have anything better to do, like make babies and conform to everyone’s expectations of what our Hero-Boy should be like?” Draco tried again, something inside him wanting to pick a fight.
“I am not seeing another woman Ginny. You know that I have to work longer hours because we’ve been so busy with the anti-Death Eater hate boiling up again.” He replied calmly, this lie coming out much more smoothly than the one he’d told only a moment ago. A tiny voice at the back of his head piped up and wondered why he even bothered.
“Potter, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone freak out over a hangover potion as much as you did just now...” a sardonic voice says. Harry turns towards the sound, he knows that voice.
“Mother?” he asked, assuming he had been found by the Aurors and was now in his room with the curtains drawn. Draco decided that he must really be out of it, because his bed had never felt this uncomfortable.
They’d found out she was pregnant three months ago, and for the first time he could remember, Harry had been completely and utterly happy. The life growing inside her was their future. He’d somehow managed to help create something good. All his sacrifices finally had meaning and all his sins had been forgiven in that single moment. When he’d found out, he’d dedicated his life and entire being to his child, and finally it had felt like he had done enough.
They eventually broke apart for air. Harry’s warm breath ghosted over Draco’s lips, mingling with his own. Draco’s hand was between them, on Harry’s chest. His forefinger and middle finger rested on Harry’s pulse point. The heartbeat underneath Draco’s fingers fluttered and it took him a moment before he noticed. He knew that heartbeat, had fallen asleep listening to it for many nights and finally he had found it. He took a step back without breaking Harry’s embrace and stared at his face in wonder as if seeing him for the first time.
Draco spent most of his days in his room, absorbed in Pyxis diary or with his ear pressed to the shell. He didn’t care that time got away from him, that he couldn’t remember what he had done for hours at a time, all he cared about was getting away from having to think about his own life and where he was headed.
Malfoy nodded eagerly before a look of such mischief crossed his features that Harry couldn’t help but worry at what was to come.
Harry eventually closed the umbrella when the rain stopped. Draco didn’t know what to do with his hand so when Harry put it back onto his arm, Draco let him. They walked through the flea market, Draco letting Harry’s excitement for all the odds and ends on display carry him along. Draco ended up buying a delicate china figurine for his mother, which he knew was still missing in a set that stood on the mantelpiece on her favourite parlour. Harry bought a stack of cheesy romance novels that Draco mocked him for mercilessly until Harry admitted that they were for Hermione who claimed she read them as a palate cleanser after all the research she did. Draco could have commented on the fact that those were cheesy gay romance novels, but decided to let that one slide. When they grew hungry, Draco made Harry buy them crêpes with chocolate filling.
They stared at each other, both panting and if Potter’s pupils were anything to go, Draco’s must look just as wide. Then again, a small thought reminded Draco, Potter had been drinking. Before he could say anything though, Potter was slowly inching back across the space separating them, a predatory glint in his eye. Draco was wary.
He woke up panting and drenched in cold sweat from yet another nightmare. Harry had been lurking in the shadows of the Manor wherever he went. When in his dream he had finally gone to bed, Harry had advanced on him slowly and menacingly. He still hadn’t said a word. Draco cowered under his covers like a child. His hopes that Harry wouldn’t find him there were quickly shattered. The covers were suddenly torn away from Draco and there he was, eyes blazing and bearing down on him. “Pretty little Slytherin, ‘m going to make you scream your lungs out,” he’d whispered and made a grab for Draco, who had finally been able to move again and run from his bedroom.
“I got a concussion when part of a secret room in the observatory collapsed while I was in there.” Draco was almost as surprised as Harry when he revealed that piece of information; so far he hadn’t been able to mention anything related to that room to anyone. Something was definitely going on.
“Mrs. Malfoy, I’m truly sorry, but I don’t know what else to do. I haven’t found any indication of a dark object within Draco’s possession and him reading those books just seems to be a genuine interest in navigation and cartography. Maybe he’s just bored or has trouble sleeping.”
“He’s the Saviour of the Wizarding World, of course it’s front page news, it would be if it was a small ceremony.”
Draco didn’t want to go. While his every waking thought had been about getting away from Harry when he first began his sentence, it was the other way around now. They’d talked about what Draco was going to do with his life once the sentence was over and Harry had encouraged him in everything, had talked him through his anxieties and held him when hopelessness had overwhelmed him.
The closing of the massive wooden doors behind him sounds final. Harry had come here to try and make amends and he’d made everything so much worse. Harry sits down on the hard steps, his dishevelled appearance no longer a care. He needs to think.
A flicker of motion from the corner of his vision disturbs his reverie. Did he see something there by the window? Draco is suddenly worried that something like that Muggle writer wrote about might happen to him. He knows he won’t be able to bear being visited by the ghosts of the past. When did the first ghost show up again? Was it one hour to midnight?
“Don’t lie to me!” Harry screamed, waving his wand around agitatedly. It was the opening Malfoy had been looking for, because he disarmed Harry and pushed him against the wall.
It was only when he removed the picture from the broken frame and turned it over that he saw the inscription on the back: “Pyxis Draconis Malfoy and a family friend in his study, 1836”. Draco’s hand covered his mouth in shock. He hadn’t known that there had been someone in his family who shared his name. Why hadn’t he known? Why was there no sign of this man, either in the portrait gallery or on their family tree? Why was there this strange room, hidden away and invisible to anyone but him?
“So you remember? God, I’m so sorry, I should’ve told you, but I didn’t know what you would do. I want you—“ Harry said, before Draco interrupted him.
Draco sighed. There really was no point in staying, everything reminded him of just how wrong he’d been, of what he’d destroyed and he just couldn’t bear it anymore. He would just go into their bedroom and get a few of his things out of the wardrobe and then go and spend yet another night at the Manor with his parents.
Weasley was standing beside him, his wand pressed against his throat making it hard for Draco to breathe or swallow, his eyes filled with vicious glee.
“I managed to date some of the structures, actually, this has been here for several hundred millions years.”
Potter didn’t reply but hit the button that would take them to the Atrium instead. Draco felt his mouth open to berate Potter further, but closed it again, when what he saw sunk in. Potter was barely managing to stand up, he looked haggard and his cheeks were red as if. As if he had been crying. It seemed impossible now that Potter had been able to manhandle Draco into the lift at all. Something was wrong. Draco took a step forward and as if waiting for that, Potter’s legs gave way, Draco barely catching him.
