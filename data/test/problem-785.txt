Malfoy, not trusting his voice, shakes his head no as he can feel the poisoned truth bubbling and rushing to the surface.
There was alot of things the Gryffindor wanted to say in that moment, but he chose to remain silent. Waiting and playing out the scenario to see where Blaise was going with his comments.
Draco stiffens at her insinuation, and pushes her pointedly away, dusting off his rich green emerald robes as he shoots his friend a dark look.
The unexpected dark thought has Draco sputtering in indignation, desperately trying to pull away while keeping his air of dignity about him. Unfortunately, it was of little use, the other boy holding on securely and
There's a heavy silence at which the Slytherin girl realizes her slip of the tongue and pales, glancing nervously at her best friend.
"Right? That's what I thought," the ginger puffs out proudly as he snuggles up closer to his girlfriend.
," and the Slytherin boy doesn't have to turn his head to know who's speaking behind him as he whips his head ferociously around.
Malfoy, upon seeing the brunette, simply says nothing, refusing to acknowledge the Gryffindor as a wave of shame began to blanket the creamy white face.
Ron seemed to have the opposite reaction, going almost as pale as Malfoy. "Bloody hell Harry, like I'd want that image in my head."
Malfoy panics at the loss of contact, terrified he had just ruined...  whatever was going on between both of them.
He wants to sharply cut back, to put Potter in his place, but his delicate body shakes and he finds he can't trust his mouth to say the proper words so he chooses to say nothing, instead throwing his trademark scowl and hoping it would be suffice.
would find him attractive, Harry had eyes after all. Blonde silky hair slicked back to perfection, the way he carried himself with such poise. The man had also grown alot over the holidays and Harry couldn't help but notice the pure-blood had grown at least 4 inches over his time away and somehow gained muscle while keeping his slim lean figure at the same time. Not to mention the rare time he saw Malfoy actually smile a genuine smile was nothing short but breath taking.
A sharp stab of pain reminds Draco of his head colliding with the wall only moments ago and the blonde winches, desperately wishing he can clutch at his head; feel for the bruise that will surely make itself known on unblemished white skin.
"Oh oh, trouble in paradise Harry dear?" a mock tone that expressed  Malfoy's ridicule leered out with a wolfish grin.
Draco can feel the raw power the brunette possesses in his grip as the other palm moves to skirt lightly against the blonde's sharp jawline.
Blaise refused to look away and it only fueled the Gryffindor even more as he cocked his eyebrow in a challenging stance.
A horrible thought nagged at the back of his brain, but Draco was a Malfoy, and there was no way in hell he would ever indulge in such...
"Good one Weasley, come up with that one all on your own did you?" the voice is directed as cold, cutting and perfect for the tone he wants to portray.
So instead, Harry just growled, jaw clenching tightly as he swallowed dryly, watching the other boys movements. His fingers itched, ready to grab his wand if things needed to escalate past him threatening and scaring the other boy off.
When neither happens, the Slytherin's not sure what to think as an almost animalistic growl escapes past the Gryffindor's lips before the brunette is pushing hard; trapping the lithe blonde against the wall.
He walked slowly and elegantly out the hall, moving past Harry's table as he glanced at the brunette, smiling a cocky smirk as he passed by which simply grated on the Gryffindor's already terrible mood.
It was true being gay wasn't as taboo in the wizarding world as it once had been, but it also wasn't common practise for a typical pure blood to be anything but straight; the constant obsession of keeping the 'blood lines' alive and passed down.
He was used to him and the Gryffindor trading barbed taunts with each other with every passing year, but this… this was too much.
"Y-" he stops himself, the familiar taste of copper filling his mouth with fresh blood as he tries to hold back through the broken flesh; biting hard.
"Yes, well, we all can't be compulsive manipulators," Draco grumbled back, lips barely moving above a whisper.
"You two just shut your filthy mouths up about my sister! Not one more god damn word you hear?" Ron puffs up his chest with each breath, ready to defend his baby sister if need be. Not that she needed it, but he would always play the protective big brother role.
"I... I ... I can't..." he feels the torment of tears sting at his eyes as he desperately tries to fight to keep his emotions in check.
fucking off and leaving or 'accidentally' knocking the rest of the Veritaserum potion seemed like a good idea, he feels the tight bunch of his robes cling to his chest as he's yanked forcefully forward.
It's a notion that disturbs the Slytherin to his very core, but he can't bring himself to correct himself, nor will he flee like a common coward as he straightens up with a clearly practiced poise.
And then if the spell was broken, Harry moved quick without thinking, as he caught the almost collapsing man and hauled him up, hands digging into his collar so as to not let the blonde fall.
The Gryffindor was holding on so tight that Malfoy wondered if he would have bruises as proof of how strong Harry truly was.
Even now, Malfoy was a stubborn git, the thought not shocking Harry as he retrained his eyes on the taller man.
"Bloody hell, it's Filch," Pansy bulks, looking around frantically for somewhere- anywhere- to hide.
"Always so fucking full of himself, isn't he?" At this he grabs the blonde, turning him around so Draco's back was pressed into Blaise's chest.
"And what, two Gryffindors being out is completely fine?" The platinum blonde arrogantly calls with raised eyebrow.
Then in a blink it was gone, but not over, as Nott nudged the Slytherin and Blaise finally broke the contact to address the other man; but not before puckering his lips up and blowing a taunting kiss towards Draco, who thankfully had his head down, clutching his plate of food tight to him. Sending one last knowing wink Harry's way, Blaise turned, poking his friend in the ribs as they began to banter about some trivial thing.
Malfoy makes a point of shifting further away from his friend on the couch as he straightens his posture with indignation. "Maybe for
"Fuck you and your muggle loving family," The Slytherin seethed, making to get up before Pansy puts a well-placed hand on his knee, forcing him back down.
The man in question blinked before training his eyes on the voice. His trusted friend Hermione was looking at him, a concerning look on her face.
Harry's thoughts came to an abrupt halt when eyes caste on someone familiar coming in through the doors and his body stiffened automatically.
"Go on, Draco," he whispered soothingly, and his tone seemed to finally ease the other man as he blinked gingerly, looking back up at Harry before averting his eyes shyly, as if afraid.
Draco is sure that this is where he meets his end. Not in a bloody battle of worth or horribly in a weird twist of fate. Not by the hands of Voldemort or by a stinging hex gone wrong, but by
"Fuck it, well lets bloody well get on with it, then. The faster we start, the quicker will finish."
"I… I.." a low, needy moan escapes Malfoy's lips before he's able to stop himself as he trembles against Harry's body that's pressed against him.
He knew what his friends would think, getting up so hastily after their completely absurd conversation, only to follow the blonde Syltherin but the boy was looking...nervous.. and Harry had every intention of finding out why.
Harry seemed to watch the other boy almost thoughtfully before deciding something between himself; startling the blonde
It's an automatic reaction, moving before Draco can fully register what he's doing, but slim hands move awkwardly to cover his lap in embarrassment.
. Whatever you say, j-just please-" he’s not even ashamed, just desperate as he rolls his hips up into what he hopes is some
"I just...I.." he was trying his best not to shake, refusing to be seen as weak; pathetic, but failing miserably the more his 'friend' pressed; closing the gap between the two of them.
"YOU DIDN'T MEAN?! What the fuck Pans, do you bloody well mind!? Bad enough sharing shit on this god-forsaken potion, I don't need my best friends fucking help for Merlin's sake!!"
"Well, that's simple Malfoy.." the brunette runs a finger suggestively along the edge of the lithe blondes throat as the shorter man trembles at the touch; Adam's Apple bobbling nervously.
Harry's fists began to shake with rage, balling as his sides as he made to stand before a quiet voice, " Don't," called out to him making him stop in his tracks.
He's standing again to assert some level of dominance as he makes himself taller, chest slightly puffed as he waits with a scowl.
Draco's eyes are wild and unsure, though he bites the inside of his cheek to hide the tremble of his body.
," the ginger Gryffindor mocks, "Don't be so angry, if you ask nicely I'm sure Ginny would be more than happy to take you to pick out some nice muggle underwear," and the
Pansy says nothing, just laughs as Draco follows her gaze and realizes in horror that he's been staring at his nemesis, Potter, during their whole heated argument and hadn't even realized it.
" he called loudly, without hesitation, as the Slytherin growled in too late realization before getting hit in the back and sprawling to the ground unconscious.
The question is random, but Draco finds that despite himself, he's genuinely curious of the answer, even if
He nuzzles his head against Harry’s neck who holds without falter; Draco keeping his legs wrapped around the muscular waist.
He hated to admit it to himself, but the way Potter held so tight to his pale white wrist with barely a strain, well... Draco couldn't hide the disgust over the little rush of thrill that the Gryffindor was much stronger than he was.
"You??" He says the pronoun tasting the way it feels on his tongue before he shakes his head in disbelief.
that he's losing his typical Malfoy composure, and rapidly but knowing and doing are two separate things and the blonde feels powerless to stop it.
"No, I don't know," Ron responds with no hint of malice before his lip betrays him, twitching before he's set in a howl of laughter. His feet
A quiet whimper of need betrays the blonde as he can't help but feel his legs shake in anticipation against his will.
All he's aware of is the constant strain of pitiful, " Please… please…" that keeps tumbling out of his mouth with fevered abandonment.
"I was just telling Harry here that he really should stop eyeing Malfoy all the time. It's only going to cause more problems."
A stutter and then Malfoy is angrily grabbing at his robes, pulling aggressively at his tie. He was panting again, breath ragged and uncontrolled.
." the voice is husky and dark, as Potter doesn't once take his lips off the pale flesh of the Slytherin boy.
"Oh, yeah?" Harry lets out a breathy little laugh and Malfoy wishes he was strong enough to wipe that stupid knowing smirk right off his face.
"What's the matter Malfoy, I would have thought you of all people would be used to it by now. Did Daddy dearest not put you in your rightful place all those years ago?"
Harry's arms still remain curled along Draco's body, though the Slytherin knows there's really just no other place for them to go, his own hands firmly against the Gryffindor's chest.
"Uh-huh…… right, SO anyway," her voice breaks loud, catching the attention of the other two boys in the room as Ron jumps with a start.
," he blurts out breathlessly and needy against Potter’s skin and Malfoy absolutely hates himself well and truly for admitting such a thing until…
"You seem to not ask for alot of stuff, Malfoy, yet here we are. Should I of left you like the slut you truly are to Blaise then?"
Remembering wearily how he had tried to convince himself not that long ago how straight he was and how good a woman felt underneath him.
Harry may of saved the boy for an unholy act, but he had still acted like an asshole, enemy or not and as both boys headed inside Harry swore he would make an Unbreakable Vow if need be to set things right.
Draco doesn't have to see to know that all eyes in the room are on him as Malfoy pretends not to feel the way Harry's eyes are burning into him.
"Perhaps you'll find out before me though Malfoy, what with your father's lovely connections and all," the mark hit's deep, the brunette cringing as he bites his lip in mortification; as if he can't believe what he just said himself.
"Yes, well suppose you don't Draco," she eyes her friend with an exasperated glare, before she nudges past him and leads the way to a darker section in the castle.
The Slytherin shoots for casual, though there's no mistaking the thinly veiled threat behind his austerity.
Pansy shields back into the couch, looking positively miserable while even the ginger Gryffindor seems unsure what to say, deciding to remain quiet instead.
"Like you can aim Weasley,honestly, but I implore you to try" and he's sneering up at the pathetic excuse of a wand that Ron is desperately clinging to.
make him out to be some massive git, and it seemed he had done just that, while Draco himself had pissed away his chance of asking something equally embarrassing.
had you wrapped around his little finger from the start, didn’t he?" she winks, ignoring the embarrassed sputtering coming from the blonde at the insinuation as she slips out past the doors with a click of her heels; not once looking back.
his attention. "Common mate, ask something already like… like… " he pauses in thought, and Draco watches as the dusty gears rolling around in his head seem to
"Close is an understatement. I'd rather not be stuck with the choice of being caught and having points taken from Slytherin or being stuck next to two..." He slicks his platinum hair back, fingers running through his hair as he glares darkly at the brunette. " Sweaty Gryffindor's. A hard choice indeed."
At her words It's as if someone had broken a spell, Pansy yawning and cracking her spine as she gets up from the couch, grinning like the Cheshire Cat as she does so.
"What's the matter Ron, would you rather Draco dominate me instead?" Pansy calls sickly sweet, sending a knowing wink in the ginger's general direction.
Exchanged whispers heat between both Gryffindors with pointed looks, and Malfoy swears he can hear the Weasley argue with Potter, before the echos of feet against stone bounces and Draco continues his quest.
Reaching for the vial, Harry ignored the gesture, instead moving to press the bottle against Slytherin lips.
He's unsure if Pansy or Ron noticed the position of the two nemesis, though Malfoy didn't think there was room for anyone to do anything other then wait.
"Just didn't realize it was Blaise you were a submissive slut for," and there's no denying the obvious distaste in Harry's tone; nor can Malfoy hide the flush of shame blanketing his face at his enemies judgement.
He was so close to the Gryffindor Draco could smell him, like fresh-cut grass of a Qudditch field and something sweet like treacle tart.
He knows he's got three sets of eyes piercing at his back as they wait for an answer and Draco can't help but find it disturbing that he had for a moment completely forgotten about Pansy and the bloody Weasley boy.
A breathy pant leaves the thin lips of the Slytherin as he tries to hide the groan of arousal at being kissed so well, at lips moving so expertly against his pale throat. He shivers at the way his nemesis bites his neck,  quick to leave little marks and bruises that send a dark pool of ecstasy hot in Draco's body.
He had balls, the Gryffindor would give him that much as he watched with disgust as the man in question laughed at something Pansy said; as if nothing had even happened earlier, before scanning the room; eyes stopping to rest on Harry; a clear challenge, warrant.
The word curls instantly, a dark thought surfacing to the brink of the blonde's mind. It was a well-known
"Let's just get this over with," Ron growled, coming to stand beside Draco as he eyed the room cautiously before pushing past Draco aggressively as he opened the door and headed in with shoulders back. The lithe platinum blonde scoffed, shifting his robes so as to have them sit better on rested shoulders as Pansy quickly followed suit behind the ginger.
The thought of embarrassing himself in front of his nemesis is enough to snap the blonde back to reality.
against the blondes temple, a simple random gesture that sends Draco Malfoy melting into a puddle of goo.
"W-What the fuck, Potter! I'm... He's..." Draco falters, biting desperately at his lip to keep himself contained.
"We just weren't what each other  we're looking for is all," he says finally with a small shrug as Harry
"That you do," Zabini growled back, as he licked his lips nervously while trying to decide his next course of action.
He can feel the burning shame creep up in his throat as the mortified blonde tugs his body away from the loose grasp that the shocked brunette still had him in.
Harry was sure the git was up to something no good, and now, Harry couldn't image the blonde doing anything bad especially seeing how...vulnerable the blonde looked and suddenly every regret Harry had been feeling vanished, thankful he had stopped things before they had gotten out of hand.
She observes the boys for a second longer with a quiet quirk of her eyebrow before smiling slightly with a
Malfoy is all too aware that the Gryffindor boy hasn't let go of his wrists yet- arms still pinned high above his head with a firm grip that
gapes like a flounder, unsure what to say or do as luckily he's rescued by the Room of Requirements door returning, and an angelic face popping up into view.
Malfoy winces, squeezing his eyes shut. He can feel his fists tremble in Potter's hands as he quietly seethed to himself.
"After you Malfoy," he calls innocently, voice twisting and curling something deep in the pure-blood's insides.
"What are you doing you idiot, are you trying to get us all caught?" and a harsh quiet whisper beckons as lips press against the edge of Draco's ear. He knows Harry isn't doing it on purpose, that there's simply no other place for him to move, but the knowledge doesn't stop the shivers that spark against Draco's body as he tries to calm his racing heart.
Malfoy half expects his nemesis to hex him unexpectedly with his guard down, to curl in disgust at being around a dirty little pure-blood faggot, but
"Oh, fucking hell it's Moine, thank Merlin," the ginger breaths easily as he hurries to the door and further away from the madness and insanity.
be from the Gryffindor. In fact, it's a question he's been acutely aware of since their little game begun.
At the words, something in the blonde snapped, as his eyes heated up and he released himself glaring daggers at the brunette.
"Though you're a right shit liar," she giggled, elbowing him in the ribs again; though much lighter, as he scowled back at her.
in surprise, Harry grabbing him firmly by his pale hair and pulling sharply; his neck snapping back, exposed and vulnerable.
"I suppose it depends on the context of the situation." Harry muses thoughtfully. He blinks long, dark eyelashes as he surveys the petite blonde from under heavy-lidded eyes.
Draco wines- an absolutely retched sound of fear that  clearly shakes  with every note, but he say's nothing; allowing the Slytherin boy to do what he wants with him.
have a father Potter doesn't mean you need to get all jealous. It's not a very becoming color on you."
He kissed him then, fingers move and force the pale skin of Draco's jaw to snap up as the other Slytherin boy takes his lips hungrily.
"And trust me Potty, if I was flirting," Malfoy's eyes narrowed into dangerous slits as he fights to keep trembling balled fists contained.
"I...I.. I w-was thinking about you tying m-me up and p-punishing me," he answers with a flushed voice as Malfoy refuses to meet Potter's gaze, eyes transfixed to the floor.  It's not until the brunette tilts his head up does he gaze into bright emerald eyes that spit fire.
"Did...did..." Voice hesitant and despite himself, Harry couldn't help but offer a small smile to the other man, encouraging him to continue.
up fully as tears spring to his eyes. Draco can also vaguely make out Pansy giggling quietly to herself and Harry...
She does her best at trying to hide her amusement as she puts both hands on her hips. “So… what’s going on here?”
It takes four steps and Harry's now in front of him, hands splayed on either side of the lithe blonde trapping him in.
It shouldn't of been a surprise when Blaise ducked his head low a mere 30 minutes later, slithering towards the Slytherin table as he sat between Pansy and Theodore Nott.
But when the Slytherin thought back on all the memories they shared, good and bad, his newfound feelings for his long-time nemesis suddenly didn’t feel so unexpected.
of you," he glances at Pansy for a second before emerald eyes lock back in place, glaring daggers at the pale blonde boy.
considering the lack of touch the two boys have experienced together other than the odd physical altercation when things really got violent.
Let it be known, that even the bravest of Gryffindor's can be a coward at times for he found himself saying nothing of such comforting things that he was sure would help the pure-blood in some way or another, instead replying softly, "Come on Malfoy. Let's go get something to eat. I got you okay? I'll take care of you."
"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?" Draco hissed before realizing he didn't really want to know the answer, anxiously picking up his pace as he registers just how truly late it really was, and not wanting to be anywhere near Pansy to hear her retort.
And Merlin, if that name doesn't send the Slytherin in a full out whine, eyes closing and squeezing tight to fight back a fresh wave of arousal.
He's flustered, and he knows it, can tell by constant years of being teased by his friends of how 'pretty a shade' Draco turned when embarrassed. Pale ivory skin that left little to hide. Body pressed flush against body, Draco feels suddenly stiff, moving despite his best judgement as he realizes the position is now far worse then the first and is now faced with the reality that he's now forced to tilt his chin to rest his head on his nemesis shoulder or risk pressed lips against lips.
to handle such foreign territory as he swallowed dryly, the pit of his stomach twisting in anxious knots.
Potter seems to have the same idea, fingers coming to curl around the blondes sharp jawline as he yanks him firmly; forcing the thin-framed man to look up at him.
Suddenly Blaise got an idea. Harry could tell by the way his eyebrows crinkled a slow smile struck out stupidly on his face. He had a thought, and hoped he didn't miscalculate.
She'd be lying if she said it hadn’t surprised her, but the moment quickly passes and both Gryffindor boys
"He wasn't fucking asking you," Draco hissed, ignoring the fact that his face was turning a bright flushed red.
"F-Fuck you Potter," Draco stutters in horror as he stands up suddenly and angrily before catching the brunette's stare and nervously backing up- and into the wall.
He can feel the hot shame spread across his pale skin, but thankfully Malfoy was no stranger at hiding his outward appearance as he masks his weakness with arrogance instead. "What, because I'm a faggot that instantly means I want to suck every blokes cock, including your own does it? My you must think pretty highly of yourself Potter," he scoffs with a raised eyebrow, glaring daggers at the other boy.
"Will talk about this later," Harry mumbles sheepishly, having the decency to look at least slightly guilty.
Draco hates himself for wondering what exactly it is that the Savior of the Wizardly World could want.
"Let's see how good it looks when I...." and Harry's voice carries out in a quiet husky tone for only the two of them to hear.
charm. Besides, the T-shirt reminded him of nothing more than his night-shirt, and the cloak helped him to feel a bit less underdressed.
Lucius reached down into his boot and brought out a small silver knife. He kept it below the level of the table, so that no-one else could see it.
He really didn’t want to go out there. There was no-one in the castle who would be pleased to see him. At least no-one would be able to capture him. He set his jaw, straightened his back as much as he could with the crutches and swung himself through the arch in the stone and into the corridor, which was mercifully empty.
The conversation was not plentiful, but it wasn’t stilted either, and it centred mainly on the food. When Draco had finished scraping the little box for the last taste of the curry (without even transferring it to his plate first - mother would have been shocked), he sat back on his chair with a replete sigh.
Potter had taken the box back and was tipping it over his plate so as to better scrape a portion of the sloppy orange foodstuff over his rice, splashing a bit on the table. Draco goggled for a moment at such a blatant lack of table manners, and then, feeling rather daring, emulated him.
He tried to settle with the SAS survival guide again, as it had been quite interesting yesterday, but he couldn’t focus. He
“It stops people from holding me somewhere against my will. Apparently it doesn’t care if someone wants to hurt me or kill me, which is a shame. I was rather hoping that it would offer me more protection than that. I expect a lot of people are going to want to finish what Peeves started, and…” Ugh. Did he really have to say it? “That scares me.”
Draco nodded his approval, and they both reached for a glass at the same time. They lifted the tumblers and clinked them together, and then Draco took a sip and Potter attempted to drain his whole measure in one go. He cut himself off, spluttering, after only one gulp.
The room beyond it was much larger than the wine cellar. It covered the space underneath the entrance hall and the rooms either side of it, and continued out under the gravel and gardens for a good five hundred yards.
. And now he was too. Even with the carnage, Draco could see obvious traces of their lives on the run. There were books all over the place - Granger, of course; a Chudley Cannons mug still intact on the kitchen floor; one of the surviving cabinet doors had a piece of parchment stuck to it, displaying a neat chart. Draco carefully shuffled over to read it.
“Do stop apologising, I’m sure you needed the sleep. Come on, you’re the last here, we’re ready to start.”
Shacklebolt cleared his throat and spoke for the first time, in a calming rumble. “So, it appears the first order of business is to discuss where you will stay for the summer months, Mr Malfoy. Since Malfoy Manor is currently in the hands of the Ministry - ”
She stepped down from her stool and moved it up until it was next to Draco’s head. Then she hopped onto it again.
They were all silent for a minute. This was bleak. Potter may be sickeningly noble, but there was a difference between spur-of-the-moment heroics to prevent Draco’s fiery death and preventing Draco from going to prison. Potter would want to see all the Death Eaters brought to justice. He’d lock Draco away forever and throw away the key, and probably enjoy it.
An uncontrollable growl escaped Harry's lips before he could stop himself, moving without thinking as he curled his arm around the lithe blonde beside him, pulling him tight and possessively.
Panic pierced the Slytherin as he screamed wildly like a trapped animal, fighting and squirming against the Gryffindor.
"How dare I?! Oh, please Malfoy. I'm sure you make a fantastic little submissive slut for Pansy," and there's a growled edge to his tone, something the blonde notices but is unaware of context.
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, as if also surprised, "You'll still be dizzy but it'll at least look better, which for
He followed Harry's gaze to his face and gingerly placed a well-groomed hand on the corner of his eye, tracing it up to the side of his head. Sure enough, a nasty lump was
Seemed almost silly, the sudden change in thought, but as Draco nestled close to him, body practically ontop of Harry's, the brunette didn't comment. Instead, simply moving his hand behind the blondes back to rub soothing circles in the back of his spine; causing a quiet purr to escape past thin lips.
"I couldn't agree more," his nemesis scoffs  and the thought of Potter agreeing with anything he had to say leaves a sick taste in his mouth.
Harry is acutely aware how riled up his best friend is, but he doesn't comment nor even acknowledge his mate, instead eyes focused on Pansy, waiting for her answer.
"Well, I… I don't know.." the ginger shifts uncomfortably as he clears his throat, rubbing at the back of his neck.
"I wouldn't say that. In fact, I wouldn't say it's paradise at all..." and  it's obvious that Harry had planned to say more but thankfully
Malfoy hissed at the unexpected rough contact. His body; much to Draco’s distress, eagerly gives in to being manhandled.
"Nothing wrong with looking good Potter," Draco sits straighter, trying to present an air of confidence even if his reality feels like it's crumbling from the inside out.
"You mean besides in the company of you two? Yeah, I'm sure I could find somewhere better to be- like anywhere."
The boy got lost in thoughts, head still reeling over everything that happened in the course of two hours. He still couldn't believe one of Draco's supposedly friends had tried to rape him, and was stunned when the blonde had actually agreed to letting Harry help him.
He let's go of his nemesis jaw suddenly, and Draco stutters at the unexpected drop of his chin as he growls angrily.
It's hot and erotic and god, Draco isn't sure how much more he can take of the Gryffindor teasing him with all the down right filthy things he planned to do to him.
He wanted to argue, to press, but Draco looked absolutely stunning, all pout and pleading eyes and Harry simply couldn't deny the pure-blood as he sat back down.
The Slytherin can hear his heart racing in his chest, but he pretends he's fine as he squeezes his eyes shut and does the only thing he can do, he waits.
tell you what to do and you listen like a good Little Slytherin and do as I say," and the way he voices such directed words has even the Gryffindor's best mate giving him a weird sideways glance, but the redhead is smart enough to keep his mouth shut.
"Drink." Voice gruff and for a moment Draco almost thinks of refusing out of spite as the flask waves heavily between them both.
Filch is getting closer, lamp swinging back and forth as an eerie light bounces up and down with each step.
"Yeah? Your going to tell daddy dearest the way you act? Praddling around the school grounds like your just waiting for a fresh cock to take you? I'm sure Lucius would love to hear about his purebred son acting like a common whore, and no doubt a
"Sod off Malfoy, you go first." It's the first time Harry looks unsure, eyes wearily trained on the small coffee table and where said item of discussion
of what his nemesis was about to do to him, refusing to look away. He stared wide-eyes as Potter shifted, and before the blonde could realize what was happening, he sealed the gap between them, kissing the Slytherin deeply and
Squirming desperately against the brunette's grip and gaze, Malfoy's pale body flushes with heat at the use of his first name. It felt unfamiliar…
"W-wait what? So the sodding thing has already worn off? Harry, did you know that??" he turns with a bewildered expression across his face as he looks at his best mate in question.
my involvement. I am already going down for life, Draco. It will not really make things worse. But it will prove to them that you are not leaving anything out. The more you can show that you are putting distance between us, the better.”
Potter nodded, and rubbed his hand across his face as if searching for the energy to set out dinner. Draco was struck by how generous it was of Potter to stop at the Indian on his way here. He was sure that Potter didn’t really care about anything but finding a way to stop feeling right now, so he must have been thinking of Draco - even though Potter didn’t want to care.
Draco’s eyes widened. Oh, Merlin, he had forgotten! How could he have done that? “I was trying to get to the hospital wing. I needed to see Prudy. She - Winky told me - about Dobby.” He fixed his gaze firmly on the ceiling, but could still see Potter stiffen. “I - I have to tell her. She doesn’t know yet, or didn’t, maybe she does now. I wanted her to hear it from me. She is - she was - she
With deep breaths, he gradually got himself back under control, wiping away the last tears with the back of his hand. Gods, he was so tired. When had he last slept? How many days had it been since the battle? He had passed out when his father had given him the old magic, and when the Path of the Penitent had triggered the vision of how he had wronged Potter, but neither of those counted as rest. The last time he’d slept properly was in this very bed, and that night he’d woken in the early hours to his Mark burning, and the news that Potter was back.
He already felt a hell of a lot calmer. There was something soothing about slowly seeing the tent get put back together. Potter started with the crockery, levitating things back into the cabinets as they were fixed and then reattaching the cabinet doors. When he had finished putting the kitchenette to rights, he filled a kettle with an
Weasley ducked out of the tent, and Potter turned back on his way out to hold the flap back for Draco.
There wasn’t chance for any of the pomp and ceremony that would normally go along with this. But luckily, at heart, the magic was very simple, and ancient. It didn’t even require any specific words, or a wand.
“You don’t, I suppose.” He paused, as if chewing over the next thing he wanted to say. “Snape invented it. I’m surprised he didn’t teach it to you. It’s bloody useful.”
The house-elf - Winky, Potter’s note said - wore a dress, which was surprising. Draco had never properly met any free elves before and now in the space of a few days he had met two of them. She placed the tray holding his breakfast on the nearest armchair and turned back to him, her wide brown eyes nervous.
She crouched down on the stool and doubled over with grief, clutching her hands to her stomach and bawling. Draco’s chest clenched even tighter and he sat up, unsure how to comfort her. Eventually, he settled on laying one hand across her tiny back.
Potter shrugged. “If I had been in your place, and lived your life, I don’t see that I could have done things much differently. I never had to find a way to be in Tom’s presence for weeks at a time. I never had the option to try and appease him. It’s not courage to fight him when it’s the only choice you have, and it’s not cowardice to adapt to survive. Maybe I wouldn’t have bullied people at school, and
Draco wanted to say, but he knew he would have to state that it was sarcasm, which rather took the fun out of it. He deposited the plates and hopped back to the kitchen for cutlery. “Well, at least the taxi driver was nice. I really liked him, actually. He didn’t ask any questions, and let me tell you, that was a good thing, because
“I really should have been expelled though…” Potter finally let it go with a disgruntled sigh. “Whatever. I suppose it can wait. Um, I’ve brought Prudy here with me.”
“Hang on, you want the Ministry to control what tasks people give him?” said Harry. “Shouldn’t that be between him and them?”
slump. He would keep his shoulders back and look at Potter, no matter how much he wanted to shrivel up and die.
“I couldn’t wait that long, for a normal trial, I mean. I need to be at the Manor every new moon.” He tried to stop himself continuing, but the spell clearly knew he hadn’t properly explained. “There’s a blood ritual I have to do every month, in a room in the Manor, to keep the spirits of my ancestors alive.”
Draco was still facing her when he heard the door bang open and a man behind him starting to shout a spell. He whipped round, cursing his lapse of attention, but his left leg cramped at the sudden movement, and he crashed down onto his knees. The fall saved him, as a bolt of green light flew close over the top of his head and exploded against the far wall.
“There we go. So, your left arm is fine, although your wrist joint was pretty much pulverised - all rebuilt now, of course. It’s your lungs and spine I’m more worried about. Your left lung was completely crushed and punctured at several points by your ribs, and you broke three different vertebrae. I’m confident that your spinal column has re-knitted itself correctly, but with these kinds of injuries it’s best to stay still and not aggravate the wound site for at least forty-eight hours. I tried to add some magical restraints to your bed to make sure you couldn’t move around too much, but they kept failing to form. Mr Potter tells me that you are currently under some kind of magic which prevents you being held captive, is that correct?”
Didn’t see you doing much fighting. Typical Malfoy, always ready to let others do the real work, eh?”
“Huh. That’s quite a reaction.” Weasley’s voice was distant. “I could almost believe he might feel bad about it, you know?”
“Prudy, I - I want you to go and stay with your grandmother for a while, okay? Frona needs to know what happened, and she can look after you better than I can right now.”
Draco threw his left arm up, using his right crutch and leg to desperately fling himself out of the way, but it was point-blank range and Peeves, like his aunt Bella, had excellent aim. The stone crashed into his left shoulder and chest, crushing his arm in between them, and Draco’s feet left the ground with the impact. He fell back and kept falling past the level of the ground, and after a long moment his back crunched into the stairs, the boulder landing on top of him. It bounced off, avoiding his face by less than an inch, and Draco rolled brokenly down the rest of the stairs, landing in a heap on his side at the bottom.
Draco nodded, swallowed, and followed the instructions. His cloak got in his way a little but soon he was at least turned fully towards the pavement.
“I can’t go, Potter - no, well, the truth is I don’t want to go. It doesn’t feel right or respectful, I’m a Death Eater, for Merlin’s sake - ”
It seemed that the battle had not reached down here. The clock had fallen from its mantelpiece, presumably during some of the heavier artillery barrages, but otherwise it looked exactly the same. There was even some abandoned homework on a table at the far side of the room.
Draco rolled his eyes, but he didn’t actually feel as exasperated as he normally did by Myrtle’s wheedling. In fact, he felt a sense of warmth unfurling at the sight of her. He hadn’t thought there would be a single being in this castle who would voluntarily come to pay him a visit.
Draco turned his head away from the livid face looming above him. Lestrange’s hand darted out and seized him brutally round the chin, forcing him to turn back and look into his uncle’s dark eyes. Lestrange was panting with fury, but as Draco watched, his expression shifted into an altogether different emotion.
,” she said, and Draco couldn’t prevent the way he startled back, holding his hands up to try and ward it off, panic flaring. But just as before, the red light dispersed harmlessly about a foot away from him.
How strange it was, to be in the Golden Trio’s own tent. For all those months, so many people had been wondering where they were, and they’d been
“Never mind, never mind. You’ve missed your chance to meet Teddy, Molly has already taken him in. I’ll have to introduce you to him afterwards.”
“Oh, I’m sorry. Well, you’re a little early, so if you’d like to take a seat in the waiting area, the doctor will come out and call for you when she’s ready.”
“It was a war. At the time I was livid, but I understand now how important it was that you took it. Giving up my wand was apparently my small sacrifice towards a world without the Dark Lord. Anyway, my mother lent me hers when I came back to school, which was a lot better than nothing. So it was her who went without.”
“Dobby - Dobby raised me. He cared for me from when I was a baby and all through my childhood. He, I think maybe he - loved me.” Draco felt the burn in his eyes spill over, but he ignored it. “And I, I just - I never - father always - oh, Gods. I treated him so badly, Winky.”
Draco tentatively shifted up onto his elbows. The ache was gone now that the old magic had settled. He could still feel it inside him, like a second layer of skin; strange, but not uncomfortable.
Potter skidded to a halt, wand pointed directly at Draco’s head. He could clearly see Potter debating whether it was worth trying to aim a stunning spell past Prudy. Draco staggered to his feet, wrapping one hand lightly around Prudy’s neck and trying to look menacing.
Potter sighed. “Do you mind if we don’t go into all that right now? I don’t really like thinking about it.”
“Right. Um.” Potter turned to him, looking slightly sheepish. “Malfoy, you’d help the Ministry with all this - post-war stuff, right?”
Draco felt a thrum in his bones as the old magic ignited, and the cane suddenly twisted in his hand, the wood thickening. It was growing at an incredible speed, ropes snapping against the strain. Lestrange made a startled noise as the wood slammed into him, throwing him off Draco. Draco let go of the cane and struggled free of the remaining ropes. Right in front of him, the cane was still growing, roots cracking the flagstones as branches boiled upwards, bending towards Lestrange. The branches seized him, and he screamed as they wrapped around his neck and torso and lifted him off the ground. It was over in seconds. The branches, thick as pythons, coiled around his arms and legs, and Draco heard four distinct snapping noises as the branches clenched deliberately around each of Lestrange’s limbs in turn. Lestrange screamed in earnest, completely suspended in the tree. Thinner tendrils of wood were coming towards his eyes…
She drew herself up in mock haughtiness. “I am not! I am the height of compassion. That Olivia Hornby,
Draco shuddered. All at once, he remembered visiting his father in Azkaban. The awful, clammy cold of it, the sunken despair from the dementors.
Draco took a deep breath. “As you wish. A house-elf called Frona told me about it. She’s the grandmother of my house-elf Prudy.” Potter’s eyes went hard again at the mention of her name, but he didn’t interrupt. “Frona is ancient, and remembers her people’s ways. She said that the Path of the Penitent used to be invoked by house-elves back in the old days, when they served wizards and witches without being magically bound to us.”
Anne Liston smiled. “Poppy and I go back a long way, Mr Malfoy. We did a good deal of medical training together. And unfortunately, you are not the only patient that she has needed to refer to me during this terrible war you’re having.”
The man tugged on a grey strap that was running across his chest, and Draco followed it down to where it seemed to be lodged securely in some kind of latch mechanism with a bright red button. Draco looked around, but couldn’t see where his was meant to come from.
Dobby’s sister.” The pain in his chest was back, a totally different kind from the ache in his lung. He allowed himself to clench his hands together so he could keep his face impassive.
When Winky finally lifted her head from Draco’s knee she left a large damp patch behind. Her face was red and blotchy. Draco half-expected her to start apologising and punishing herself for messing up his robes, but she appeared to have a bit more steel than that. She gave him a sympathetic look - much kinder than he deserved - and said simply, “Winky is leaving Master Malfoy to his breakfast now, sir.”
Very deliberately - it almost seemed slightly reluctantly - Potter drew his wand too, and now Draco had three wands pointed at him.
Draco looked down at the parchment. Names, written in many different hands, almost covered it completely. Draco’s eyes widened.
and set it to boiling, and then started on the rest of the room and then the bedroom. As soon as the bunk-beds were standing upright again the tent felt so much larger. Draco felt his breathing become a little easier.
For a moment it struck him that, however uncertain his future was, he was most likely stuck as a cripple for life. Every stupid little task was going to be that much more difficult. He would have to be constantly guarding his movements to prevent his calf muscle from searing with pain.
He felt Weasley’s long hand come reluctantly to rest on his left shoulder, Potter’s hand on his right. Draco hesitated for a second, looking side-long at Potter. He didn’t want Potter seeing this stupid salute, but he didn’t want to have to explain why either, so he lifted his left arm to get it over with as quickly as possible.
former childhood nemesis returned. Potter must have come in quite quietly, because the first Draco knew about it was when he stepped into Draco’s restricted field of vision.
Potter drew up another chair and sat opposite him, cradling his own tea. For a while, they sat in silence, letting it cool. Potter took a sip and then looked over at Draco.
Shacklebolt gave a melodious chuckle. Draco wondered what in-joke he was missing, and why Shacklebolt and Potter had one.
Draco negotiated the tufts of moor grass as best as he could without snagging the damn cloak under his crutches. Potter was well in the lead in a few short moments. Looking ahead, Draco saw Potter skid to a halt in front of a tall woman stood in the shadow of the tor. As Draco got closer, he saw that the huge granite formation was actually made up of two boulders, with a small gap in between them.
, but Potter was not under any magical obligation to tell him about it. Even answering Draco’s questions to this extent was surprising. Perhaps Potter’s noble ideals made him think he should be fair or something, given how much Draco had revealed. Well, Draco was going to have to rely rather heavily on Potter’s noble ideals now, wasn’t he, so he shouldn’t really sneer at them.
He reached down and pushed aside the charred, tattered remains of his trouser leg. A chunk of muscle from the back of his calf was missing, a smooth bite-shaped crater, and the skin over it had become the shiny twisted tightness of a healed burn. Draco stared, and remembered. In the Fiendfyre, a griffin of flames had snapped its beak at him as he dragged Goyle up that tower of desks - he had felt heat at the time as he had snatched his leg up higher, but thought nothing further of it - through the rest of the battle he supposed that adrenaline must have kept him going. How could he not have noticed it? But since sitting down on the bench in the hall after the battle, he hadn’t tried to move anywhere, and perhaps the burn had been bad enough to kill all the nerve endings…
“You are all well come.” Andromeda paused just long enough for all eyes to settle on her. Draco had known her for fewer than five minutes, and already he could tell that this woman had not forgotten her aristocratic training in presence and performance. “We are come together to lay bare our loss to the sky. We are come together to pool our memories as water. We are come together to give our dead to the ground. We are come together to bear the blaze of our grief.”
how hard it was to avoid killing anyone these last couple of years. The Dark Lord tried to make me, you know.” Gods, he wished he could stop talking. He closed his eyes. “He fucking had me up in front of a M-Muggleborn boy and his sister and his parents and he - he told me I had to practise the
Draco took his mouthful at the same time as Potter. The flavour was unfamiliar but delicious. He swallowed.
The door closed, and after a few seconds, Potter reappeared, looking confused. “I thought you were following me? Do I need to hold the door for you?”
“He did mention it, yeah. Gods only know why you’re taking him in, Harry. Mum and dad are going to flip their lids. I remember picking up the pieces after your recent experience of the Malfoys’
“Yes. I have to atone to the seven people who I’ve most badly wronged. Each of those people need to set me a task, and I have seven cycles of the moon to make sure they’re all done. If I fail to complete all the tasks by then, I will start to get sick. If I’ve not completed the tasks by the end of the next full moon, then I will die, and then return as a ghost.”
They crossed the road, Draco bringing up the rear. Weasley opened the gate into the tiny paved area that passed as a front garden. The stone steps up to the front door were worn with age and a trifle uneven, and Draco took care not to stumble in any way under Weasley’s examination.
Draco felt a flicker of hope, which, for some reason, in the next second, made him angry. “Quidditch, Potter! Seeking! I’m not interested in flying if I can’t do it well enough to keep up with
Potter’s face hardened, which was much better. But the words he said were still far too kind. “Malfoy, no-one deserves or doesn’t deserve a life-changing injury. It’s just a thing that happens, that has to be dealt with.”
“It isn’t.” Draco could feel himself go pink at his clumsy interruption of the Minister, but he needed to set this straight. “I am now Lord of the Manor, and as I am not in the Ministry’s custody, the Manor and all the assets of the estate are under my ownership.”
Draco hurried to speak before Potter did something stupid, like offer to go away again. “I don’t mind in the slightest, Potter. In fact, I’m glad to see you. And if your intention is to get black-out drunk, you’ve come to the right person.”
“I only wish they hadn’t torn the posters in Sirius’s room…” Potter sighed, and ran his hands through his messy hair. “Anyway. You’ll be glad to know Bill got rid of Old Dusty too.”
Anne Liston held open the second door on the right for him, which led into a large, airy room, with, thankfully, a wooden floor and no marble anywhere. The wall on his left had another pair of large windows looking out onto a different muggle street, and in the far right corner was a desk with couple of chairs - another shiny black armchair on the ‘patient’ side and a strange chair with wheels on the ‘healer’ side.
A part of Draco almost wanted to laugh, but he knew he would sound hysterical. He pressed his lips together and hid his face in the relative safety of his arms. No-one had ever seen him have an attack before. He had always managed to hold it together until he reached privacy. He willed himself to get a grip, but it was far too late. He just couldn’t do it. The pressure in his chest was crushing and a pins-and-needles numbness was spreading across his scalp and down his arms.
Draco walked with his head held high, like all pure-bloods did, as he took a few right turns followed by a sharp left. He had no idea where he was going truthfully, and was hoping if enough time passed the annoying Gryffindor prats would just up and leave out of annoyance.
He closes his eyes, trying to concentrate on quieting his heart that races anxiously, but finds it even more difficult when he's forced to
Sides he had been with Ginny for 6 months and at the time he enjoyed making love to her. But if he was being honest, he knew something had been missing, and in short, both parties decided to go their separate ways with thankfully, no hard feelings.
He knew how insensitive and heated the remark was, but he chose not to care about anything other than removing his disappointment and shame he was
Malfoy flushed at his tone, the clear interest in his cock obvious as the once prim and proper Slytherin now stood reduced to nothing more than a trembling boy with need.
If anything it had the opposite reaction, Balise growling animalistically as he pressed a leg between the blonde's thighs, prying them apart. He let's go of one of his hands, using one arm to still force Malfoy's wrists above as the other moves Over eagerly, roughly pressing and touching where ever he saw fit as Malfoy squirmed at the feeling.
in a question, making him able to hide back the sick fantasy that's scattered across the lithe blonde's mind; though just barely.
attention, now you need to do something about that." And Harry watched wide eyed and jaw slack as the taller Slytherin pressed against the pure-blood, pushing him against the tall oak tree and trapping their bodies against one another. Long arms reached, grabbing the thin wrists of Draco as he pulled them up and above Malfoy's head, sealing his head in as Blaise smiled slowly, a wicked grin gracing his face.
Harry couldn't help but feel his heart begin to beat louder in his chest at the tone of Zabini's voice and the way Malfoy suddenly stiffened in discomfort.
He's surprised at the level of strength the brunette had displayed, wondering with morbid fascination if he were to gently run slender fingers against the top frame of Harry, how much muscle he would feel if he just stroked...
"Answer the question Malfoy," he snarls in a low hiss as Draco bites back the choked moan of clear excitement beginning to grow and stiffen in his cock at the way Potter addressed him.
Surprisingly, the blonde didn't resist, just simply nodded almost shyly, as he followed meekly by his nemesis's side as they walked back through the tall grass of the outside courtyard.
He imagines the look is good as any though the way slim fingers rest pressed against a muscular frame, Draco wonders how much weight his trade mark frown really has, if any.
It's this trademark Malfoy arrogance that causes the blonde to pause a second, eyes still forward as he calls out angrily before he can stop himself, " Well, Merlin's beard, are you coming or not? Let's do this then," as he moves without waiting for a response.
Both men stiffly moved as Harry with almost mild amusement, watched the blonde approach the red and gold colored Gryffindor table with meekness.
that Potter was taunting him again, the familiar banter putting him more at ease though he notes his nemesis softness behind his voice.
"Shove off Blaise,I'm nothing of the sort." And there was no mistaken the painstakingly arrogant voice of Draco Malfoy though as Harry got closer to the scene outside the court yard he couldn't help but notice that there was something...different sounding about it. What that was, the Gyffindor was unsure of until he crept closer, remaining hidden to both Slytherin boys as the three of them remained undisturbed and alone.
Harry's warm breath is ghosting against Draco's neck, tickling the light blondish hair's on the Slytherins neck as the lithe blonde wishes he was anywhere but here.
the blonde boy drawls in his usual demeanor; though Ron is all too aware of the disturbing sight of the Slytherin wrapped up in Harry.
"Maybe you can just pretend to drink it?" she whispers quietly, voice barely fitting to the blonde's ear.
-" at this Draco pales, elbowing his friend hard- and thankfully she gets the message, grimacing with a scowl before looking away.
"P-Please…. Oh Merlin PLEASE," his voice is ragged and choked, a wretched and uneven tone ringing in the too quiet room as
was you, why am I not bloody well surprised. What is with you Potter, do you enjoy seeing me all bruised and mangled up or something?"
"Ron!" Hermione beamed, attention drawing to her boyfriend and Harry hoped that would be the end of the discussion.
"And so what if I do?" Draco retorts in a desperate pant, no longer caring how pathetic and needy he was
He'll get her back later for that one, make no mistake.But for now... his only instinct was survival, to escape whatever horrid nightmare he has somehow found himself in.
by the call of a Gryffindor," and Draco doesn't have to see to know the exact smug look blanketing her face.
"Now, now Potter don't be greedy. You can have a turn after I'm done playing," and his back was fully turned away now, and Harry smirked. It was exactly as he wanted.
"Christ, I love when you beg Malfoy," and the brunette’s lips are back on the Slytherin's, tongue licking at his bottom lip as he fights his way in for dominance. A trail of saliva drips down and onto the shaking blonde as Potter takes a moment to pause and greedily lap it up.
"Yes you did," Draco shoots pointedly back at her. "When we had to hide from Finch, you pulled me into the corner and my head got smashed against the wall."
he wanted, didn't he?" She can't help but shoot back, an unreadable expression blanketing her pupils as she studies her friends face curiously.
Suddenly Malfoy wasn't looking his usual cocky arrogant self anymore, in fact Harry could practically hear the worry radiating off the blonde's body as Draco tried to take another step back and put some distance between himself and the other Slytherin, getting trapped instead.
The room had no house colors, likely for good reason, as the walls were a beautiful turquoise finish.
-oh hell- f-fucking shit!" the blonde curses as he arches up unconsciously into the touch, unable to control his bodies need of skin on skin- the feeling of friction and MORE
Potter nodded, fresh tears making their way silently down his face. Then his eyes lifted back to Draco’s face in sudden hope.
Madam Pomfrey flinched. “No sudden movements with your arms, Mr Malfoy, you mustn’t jar your spine - or I will have to sedate you again. And no matter what else you may be, Mr Malfoy, you are still a student under my care. Besides, no-one deserves to have an undead vigilante deciding whether one lives or dies.”
“It already has been seen to, by a house-elf. It’s a curse wound. I doubt that there’s much else that can be done for it.”
“Pity.” The spell made him continue. “Although I suppose it’s nice to still be a person who hasn’t killed anyone.”
They emerged into the midday May sunshine. Potter whirled and settled the cloak over Draco in one smooth motion, then immediately grabbed for Draco’s arm before he could move out of range and thus give Potter the slip. Potter tugged him forwards a few more steps, through the wards.
He fished his pocket watch out from the jeans with one hand, awkwardly using the rest of his arm to prevent the crutch from falling over. It was already five to two. Shit! Where had the time gone? He must have been warding off his panic for longer than he thought. He had to leave the protection of the wards, and he didn’t feel ready yet. He swallowed and took a deep breath against the resurgence of nerves. He would never feel ready. All he had to do was get himself to the pavement so that he would be visible to the muggle chauffeur when they arrived in the taxi.
angry, she hated him, but she was too much of a professional to let it affect her standards of care.
), but he’d never before had to deal with injuries that stuck around for any length of time. He was a fair hand at healing spells, if he had a wand. These endless aches and twinges - especially from his damn leg - were beginning to get to him.
He had slipped into an attack as soon as Potter and the Aurors had left. Draco had done nothing but cower on the sofa, sobbing and quaking, for hours. He didn’t remember when he had somehow dropped off to sleep, but he would guess it was at some point in the late afternoon. Now he thought it was probably the early hours of the night. At least he’d managed a proper stretch of real, not-spell-induced sleep.
Draco shuddered. No, he wouldn’t think of that either. He counted his breaths up to ten, again and again, and kept a vicious rein on his thoughts.
“Thank you, Master Draco!” Prudy clapped her hands together and actually did a little gambolling hop-skip of happiness. Draco couldn’t imagine why she would ever want to come back to Malfoy Manor. He felt really rather touched by her loyalty.
, maybe hit him with his cane, but he couldn’t seem to move. Even his breath had stopped. The next moment, Lestrange had got his bearings and slashed viciously with his wand, and Draco heard a pained squeak from Prudy as she crashed into the kitchen cabinets.
“We come back to the original point. I presume that, once the Manor is declared safe, you will take up residence there?”
Draco nodded as he got his breath back, and felt another surge of gratitude that he had somehow found such an astute muggle with whom to converse. First the kindness of the man in the taxi, and now this doctor’s no-nonsense compassion; talking to muggles was truly going better than he would have dared hope.
He began struggling madly, writhing against the ropes, trying to find some leverage with which to push up off the floor. But there was none. Lestrange growled and pressed down even harder on Draco’s windpipe, and Draco’s panic reached new heights as his vision began to blur from lack of oxygen. In desperation, his right hand tightened around the cane down by his thigh, and he wished it was his wand. The rough wood of the cane felt friendly, almost comforting, and Draco thought wildly of the ancient tree down in the cellar, and wished it was here to reach down with strong branches and knock Lestrange out of the way, shield Draco, encircle him in safety -
A bright shot of red light fizzled a foot from where it would have collided with his left shoulder. Ropes hit the air a foot from his right. He had to do this before they stopped casting spells designed to trap him and started casting to hurt, to kill.
“Listen, Malfoy, what do I do about this life-debt I owe your mother?” He smirked slightly. “I don’t know the proper traditions, you know.”
It was glorious to let himself melt into this comfort. He choked on a breathless laugh. He had forgotten that comfort was even possible. He couldn’t stop himself from falling apart just a little bit, held up as he was by the soft mattress and protected by the achingly familiar curtains, the posts like sentinels rising from each corner.
Madam Pomfrey winced. Draco felt a strange stab of anger and sympathy. He couldn’t decide if Potter had insulted him.
. Thank Merlin the spell didn’t care about him telling the truth to McGonagall. “I heard Peeves got told what for, so it’s all completely sorted out now, isn’t it.” Sweet, sweet sarcasm.
The ground fell away in a great bowl shape, the rim forming a perfect circle from the natural grass and granite of the landscape. Down below, in the centre, Draco could see the two bodies laid side by side under a stasis charm. At a glance, the werewolf looked older and his cousin looked younger than he expected. They lay on a bed of woven branches and twigs, which in turn lay in the middle of a large, shallow dip in the granite - for all the world as if it was a naturally-occurring pensieve, only one the size of Dumbledore’s entire office.
He felt over the wound with his fingers, wincing at the wrongness of the dip where there should have been a smooth, strong line. The burned skin was indeed numb, and felt just as shiny and tight as it looked. He could feel the ropey remains of his calf muscle directly underneath it, flexing as he gently moved his foot up and down. There didn’t seem to be nearly enough muscle left for the leg to function normally. Draco gingerly got to his feet and tried putting weight on his left leg, only to hiss in pain as his calf immediately cramped up. He sank back down to sit on the floor and tried not to let any tears escape as his fingers coaxed the rigid muscle to relax again. Eventually, after maybe half a minute, the intense pain faded, and he took a deep, shaky breath.
The remnants of his extended family flashed through his mind. Literally every one of them was now dead or incarcerated - no, except for his aunt Andromeda. Whose daughter had just been killed in the battle in which he had fought on the wrong side.
Potter’s light-brown skin paled. “No, I - no - I didn’t, I didn’t mean to…” Draco raised his eyebrows at the extent of Potter’s discomfort with the memory. It looked like he was going to be sick.
wouldn't want to upset the pure-blood princess, now would we?" Harry mimics his nemesis indifference, though tightly pressed lips grinding against teeth say otherwise.
He wants to thank Potter, and not because of the potion but because he genuinely wants to and is about to do
"I.. I was thinking about it," Malfoy hisses internally, feeling the way his tongue goes lax, the truth properties from the potion already starting to kick in with its effects.
"'Fraid she's right mate. The way your looking at him isn't the best look. People might get....ideas.." the last part he whispered as if afraid anyone else would hear.
Harry felt the curl of shame bubble up in his chest at his heated words from earlier, desperate to take them back. As he swallowed dryly, he couldn't help but notice that for the first time ever, Harry was unable to look at Draco.
"I-If you must know you nosy git, it was a spell book of sorts that deals heavily in Seducing and Wooing," Draco grits out between ground teeth as his fists ball up to his sides.
"But if Harry's been under Veritaserum this whole time that I’ve been trying to find you two, then sweetheart you realize what this means, don’t you?"
"Now if you don't mind..." he calls dryly, as he arrogantly makes a show of sweeping his robe as he turns around with a flourish. He hopes to god that Potter hadn't heard Pansy's crude remark at a sick joke.
"Now, now," he tries to school his voice into his calm demeanor though failing miserably, "Just because
The man in questions sighs, carding his hand through his unruly red hair. He loved his girlfriend to death, but sometimes he wished she would just get to the bloody point.
A moment later, Prudy clambered up and over the edge of the mattress. She settled herself almost primly on the bed to the left of Draco’s chest, tucking her pillow-case and purple waist-coat down around her crossed knees. Draco scanned her all over.
They had not spoken on their way here, both of them staying alert, but there had been no sign of anyone. Draco wondered whether his absence from his cell had been discovered yet. He couldn’t decide how the Aurors would respond; surely they wouldn’t think he would do something as stupid as to go straight home, but then on the other hand they wouldn’t have anywhere better to start the hunt. The ritual was nearly completed, but if the Aurors came now, it would all have been for nothing. Draco tensed at the thought, turning to face the two doors leading back into the house, standing guard as Prudy busied herself behind him with filling the kettle with water and placing it on the stove.
His eyes prickled. It wasn’t fair. He’d survived so much, and he knew he had no right to expect to be unscathed, but having to limp around like this was so fucking undignified. He couldn’t bear to be seen clunking around on crutches and failing at basic tasks. He had no wand and he could barely even walk. He was pathetic.
“That should be sufficient to deter Peeves,” said McGonagall. “I will see to it that your possessions are packed and your trunk ready to go by tomorrow, Malfoy.”
“Harry, if you would be willing to confirm that with Lord Malfoy yourself, then that would certainly satisfy me.”
to fulfil his life-debts. A few days ago it had worried him to be so indebted to Potter, but now he wouldn’t have been surprised if Potter never claimed them at all.
The entrance was an imposing marble portico, flanked with pillars and black railings and approached by three broad steps up. Draco awkwardly hopped up them on his crutches. He paused before the huge, shiny black door, his heart beating madly. At least the man in the taxi had been friendly. This place was designed to be intimidating.
“I do not know what state they will have left it in, but I believe that Voldemort himself went through it, looking for clues of your whereabouts.”
Eventually, he roused himself, glad no-one was here to see him drag himself along the floor on his backside. He laid down on his back on the sofa and contemplated the gothic arches of the ceiling, holding the parchment against his chest and letting the remnants of terror from his dream fade.
Draco kept his expression calm, even as he felt himself freeze up. He hadn’t meant to say that, especially not in front of the Aurors.
Not that he had drunk enough to black out yesterday. Potter had succumbed to unconsciousness shortly after getting Draco to say he would come with him to the funeral. There was still a quarter of the bottle of fire whiskey left, but Draco didn’t actually want to drink it. (Definitely out of practice.) So he had tucked Potter up in his nest of blankets as best as he could (if he’d had his bloody wand, he would have levitated him to a bunk-bed) and wobbled into the bedroom on his crutches to pass out in a new bunk-bed, in the vain hope that its mattress would be more comfortable than the one he’d slept in before.
“Hello, Mr Malfoy, I’m doctor Anne Liston - please follow me,” she said, not batting an eye at his cloak, and walked away with the unquestioning expectation that Draco would follow. He did, somehow soothed by her air of authority.
For a moment they just looked at each other. Draco was impressed to see how calm she looked, even while her eyes were wide with shock. He wondered whether she would approach him to try a more Muggle approach to restraining him, but perhaps he had been deemed too dangerous for that, because instead she turned away from him.
. He thought of Potter, and whether he would really keep the Malfoy family secrets, and what his new powers over wood and water could do. For a while he pondered on who else might be on the list of seven for the Path of the Penitent, but a thick swirl of guilt made his chest tight, and he wrenched his mind away before he could give himself a panic attack.
“Yes.” His voice came out as a whisper. He cleared his throat and met Frona’s gaze. “Yes. I’m very sorry.”
The Path of the Penitent! Hagrid was one of the seven people he had most wronged - and now the spell was compelling him to kneel before him and ask his forgiveness.
“Gods, no, Potter, that goes against the etiquette. Let alone the number of reasons which are perfectly obvious. And anyway, if you’re a talkative drunk then I’ll know all about it in an hour or two, unless I forget it by the morning of course.”
As soon as they landed, Draco yanked his hand away from Potter’s arm. He hadn’t taken enough time to make sure he had his balance. Instinctively, he put his left foot down as he lost his centre of gravity. His calf immediately flared in agony.
“Potter - would you find her? I can’t move from this bed. I’m sorry to ask you, I know I have no right, but if you could bring her here, then I’ll - I’ll tell her…”
Prudy sniffled and nodded, looking absolutely wretched. Draco squeezed her back. “I’ll see you in a week, Prudy. Take good care of yourself.”
Potter just smiled wider. Draco gritted his teeth against asking more questions. He wouldn’t give Potter the satisfaction of seeing his curiosity get the better of him.
Madam Pomfrey nodded, lips pursed. “Well, as you have probably deduced, I’m afraid that as it is an injury inflicted by the darkest kind of curse magic, there are no spells or potions which can heal it - ”
“Yeah, my bones are fine. I still have that hole in my leg though. I need to make myself some more crutches, but I don’t want anyone seeing me use the Old Magic.”
at that." At the heated words, Blaise makes a point to fully grab the front of Malfoy, fisting the bulge of the blonde's cock into his hands as he strokes, unwantingly by the boy.
But fuck, risk or not, it was tempting, Draco would admit to that. Being able to ask the Boy Who Lived ANYTHING without the Gryffindor being able to lie in return was something that seemed almost impossible to pass up. But with the perks and stakes so high, so to could the Gryffindor do the same as well.
Harry realizes he’s no better as he can’t help but take in the platinum blonde’s ethereal beauty as he smiles softly down, lips brushing lightly on the other’s head. It’s when he notices Malfoy is watching, that his grin is quick to turn lecherous.
Harry winces as soon as the words are out of his mouth, his breath inhaling sharply. He turns without a second look as he moves away from the blonde and awkwardly sits beside his best mate, Ron.
Years of being a pure-blood, a Slytherin, a heir for his father and mother had taught him better then to show weakness and he growls darkly instead.
"It's Malfoy, it's in the bloody gits blood, ain't it Harry?" The ginger boy sent a sly wink to his best mate and Harry nodded, relaxing slightly to have someone on his side.
form and to his horror, his resolve breaks instantly, as the obsessive need for **more** takes over.
Harry's blood began to boil at the implication of the words, shaking his head hotly as he could feel heat rise up on his cheeks.
Harry couldn't help the warm feeling that spread through his body at the sight of that, but he didn't dare comment. It was highly inappropriate considering everything that had happened...and was currently happening.
"Yeah well keep it up and that'll change right quick Malfoy!" and he's growling pulling him even closer as the petite blonde angrily struggled against Harry's grip.
The need to taste Potter is heavy on Draco's mind, and he's desperate to escape; body clumsily pushing at the other boy to get him out of his way so he can rush to the nearest exit.
Well I FINALLY finished!! *Does happy cheer!* It took literally a WEEK just to edit. So  if you liked this story PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE leave Kudos or comments, it makes my literal day :')
Ron sighed heavily before groaning and slumping in defeat against his girlfriend. "Oh bullocks, why am I not bloody surprised."
"No, I was thinking about you, you bloody git!" he snapped back, although no sooner had the words left does the blonde desperately wish he could take them back as his eyes widen in horror; clamping his hands over his mouth in a futile attempt.
He absolutely refuses to acknowledge that image that slots itself in his head; knowing full well his nemesis couldn't of possibly meant what he was
His head is spinning, feeling dizzy as uncertainty whether from the bump on his head from earlier or because of the compromising position the two boys seemed faced in, wondering if Harry noticed as much as he did.
With each touch the brunette gives, Draco is more than eager to receive, finding he was losing himself more and more with each possessive caress.
around Harry fucking Potter. Not for all the Galleons the Wizardly world has to offer, Pansy, and your fucking mental for thinking such a thing."
The tone cuts sharp and serious, voice curling a new wave of nausea and terror in the blonde's throat.
He sniffs the glass vile containing the Veritaserum once, stomach rearing in protest as he shudders away the thought; quickly handing it over to his nemesis before sitting back down beside the other Slytherin.
Draco was shaking again, terrified as he clutched the Gryffindor, nuzzling his head into the crook of Harry's neck and seemingly uncaring of anyone who might see the bizarre scene.
"Has Blaise touched you like this?" the Gryffindor demands suddenly and it takes a bit to blink through the haze of arousal to realize Potter is asking him something.
Knowing full well Lucius would likely disown him in a heartbeat for even being around families such as the Weasley's and especially Harry Potter.
"Merlin, Harry, that was close. We should get out of here before he comes back," Ron hisses, coming out of the back as Pansy steps out, making room for him to stand next to Harry once more as he eyes the other two wearily.
The Gryffindor girl watches, confused, as the two boys from different houses stumble away and out the door before anxiously meeting up, kissing desperately and passionately when they think they're free and clear from watchful eyes.
Blaise on the other hand, simply laughed, uncurling the blonde from his arms and throwing him back against the hard oak in their first position; eliciting a pained yelp from the blonde as Zabini called casually over his shoulder.
"Hmm let's see, let's see…"  a slender finger taps at his lips as he mockingly takes his time to think.  The Slytherin notices how he's got the Gryffindor's full attention; though completely misses the reason
..." and the name sent a wave of disgust down the brunette's spine, knowing he wasn't going to like whatever came next.
you-know-who had to damn well hear it and now look at us, how do I seem to always get tangled in some shit or another??" the blonde hisses in quiet ire.
"Why don't you do something, then you bloody cow-" Draco freezes from a hard fixated glare from his friend when he recoils in horror at his mistake.
Draco's hoping that if he's lucky enough, the Gryffindor might just ignore this entire awkward conversation.
The reality of his situation, of being honest and vulnerable around his enemies, sits heavy in his mind.
"Do you think it wise to say such words to me Potter?" the blonde hisses, growing more irrate when his nemesis smirk only grows wider.
fight the answer, if his thoughts weren't straining with every ounce of strength to keep the dirty truth from airing.
With each moment that passes, the Slytherin boy grows redder and redder with embarrassment. Almost at his breaking point, the blonde considers voicing his indignation when a concerning thought comes to mind.
"You are so dead," she agrees, though it's Pansy's face that has Draco worried rather than the empty threat.
He wasn't quite sure what he was doing exactly, and neither it seemed did Malfoy. But as timid fingers curled and wrapped around the Gryffindor, Harry swore he would do everything in his power to protect the boy.
if he didn't admit that he enjoyed the secret little high of ecstasy he received upon witnessing the Gryffindor's reaction to using his first name.
Unfortunately, Harry wasn't thinking rationally. Body and mouth already easily slipping into the easy heated words and exchange he was grown accustomed to when speaking to Malfoy as his eyebrows narrowed pointedly.
"They were all.. you know, touchy feely and stuff.  Hell, you just saw them! They were… they… ta.. THEY MADE OUT EARLIER MOINE!" The last words are a heated, loud whisper as he darts his eyes around nervously.
He wants to put his fingers over his mouth, but he knows it's futile, the action happening before he can stop himself as he bites his lip venomously in retaliation.
The salacious image of the blonde being held down against his will sends unintended heat stirring in his groins; a desperate want that angers the Slytherin.
If the blonde was being 100% honest with himself, he was having a hard time keeping up with the constant shift in Potters demeanor. The way the other man seemed to go from guarded and annoyed to something
Hating himself but knowing he had to play coy, his dry mouth found the words to utter darkly, "Do I get to have the first go?"
"So..." the redhead coughs nervously, "Are you two going to ask each other something or are we just going to sit around here all night?"
No, rather the blonde was out of sorts with his current friend and HIS nemesis. The Slytherin girl didn't need any extra attention.
"Well you know me, always have a nasty habit of sticking my nose in other people's business," he calls dryly, no humor.
"Then what do you have to hide, Malfoy? If you do it, then I will as well." At his words the Slytherin stops cold, the words slowly registering in his mind.
need- ah-um I mean I need… well it's getting late I should head back now," Harry blurted out awkwardly and Malfoy would've laughed if it wasn't for the quick little secret lecherous look that Potter shoots his way that has Draco  instantly engaged and even more eager to leave.
Despite his protest, he couldn't stop his betraying mind from conjuring up images of eager hands moving, constricting and tying him to the bed without the luxury of being asked; instead being taken.
"Nothing, nothing..." Harry growls with narrowed eyes. Even with Slytherin and Gryffindor constantly fighting, Malfoy had never seen the other boy look at him like
and Pansy is on tip toes, whispering such sensual words as she makes a point to look at Harry while speaking softly to her friend.
Both look away from each other in embarrassment, though neither boy moves further from the other; a steady contact of arm against hip bone.
Truthfully, he doesn't understand what's going on besides the complete helplessness of his situation…
It was one thing for a quick hate fuck, but a forbidden book of wooing? Well, how could the Slytherin boy possibly explain that one, especially on
, mate," the brunette spits out angrily and it perplexes Malfoy  to see his nemesis is glaring at Pansy rather than himself as he speaks.
Body stiffens for a minute, as a look of guilty fear crashes over Zabini at being caught before realizing it's not a Hogwarts teacher, and rather just a student.
Draco nodded slowly and Harry gently cupped the other man's jaw gently pulling him to look up at him. He didn't want to startle the blonde or seem like he was forcing or pressuring the other man after the events of today. But still he had to ask...
"You fucking wish, Potter," he hisses back as he turns quickly, storming on his heels without once looking back.
"Well don't you think Malfoy should get a little taste of his own medicine? Bout time he learned a thing or two... if you know what I mean."
Harry and Draco have the good sense to flush, the brunette hastily but safely putting the lithe blonde gently down beside him.
The intensity of the stare has Draco desperately pressing himself further back into the couch cushions as he tries to calm his racing heart.
Draco's not paying attention, body still in fight mode, unaware, and doesn't notice the taunt feeling of his robe being pulled before he's already moving, letting out a startled yelp as his head collides with the castles brick wall before he's being stuffed in a corner nook with too many bodies pressed close together.
A worried look flickers across the Slytherin's face for but a second as he's reaching down for his own as well. However, before he can react the sound of heavy footsteps break through the tense air as the group of students can hear the rapid approach of a gritty voice that quietly swears, as the noise fills the echoed halls.
Unfortunately all thoughts of escape soon depleted when he turned once more and realized he had reached a dead end.
"Don't worry Ron," Harry speaks up, his demeanor quiet but demanding as he puts a hand on his friend's shoulder for moral support.
Draco growled angrily, shooting a pointed look before he sniffed, turning and walking in as Harry waited for the blonde to pass, a coy smile etched across his Gryffindor strong features as he followed closely behind.
As the door slammed closed, sealing everyone in the room, Malfoy couldn't help but happen a quick glance back at his nemesis who was still smiling his almost lecherous and malicious grin at him.
Potion has instantly stripped all dignity of that as panic rises and Draco desperately fights to keep it down and off his perfectly placed face as he gives a mock look of indifference instead.
He shifts uncomfortably and finds himself accidentally pressing himself closer to the brunette Gryffindor as a result.
"What was the book Malfoy," and the lithe blonde doesn't miss the softness of the tone as the boy continues to stare into the fiery embers.
"God! M-Malfoy I didn't mean-" he winched waiting for the shouting to start and was shocked when instead,
"Yes, I can tell, the girls must be ever so thankful." Malfoy drawled, half amused as the ginger's ears turned pink at the insult.
Quirking an eyebrow, the brunette stretched high, broad shoulders moving high above the petite blonde as he holds the door open.
The Gryffindor doesn't answer at first, just stares at the Slytherin boy with an intense fire in his eyes. He watches the trapped boy for a moment longer before he shifts his movements so that his one arm is holding both of Malfoy's in place.
Neither boy's said a word, only the quiet sounds of Draco breathing alerted Harry that the other man was still beside him and following.
"Knock it off, Zabini or my father will have words," the pure-blood hissed hoping to deter the other man with threats as he squirmed against the tight grip his 'friend' had him in.
He hadn't noticed the truth serum when he had first entered the room, but Draco's not the least bit surprised that the Room of Requirements would somehow
Harry Potter was a Gryffindor, and he hated not having that power over everything; of ALWAYS being in control.
self preservation that has the Slytherin desperately struggling to fight back the truth from spilling out.
bloody well mention about that stupid fucking…" the Slytherin boy pauses, as if the very word would make his predicament further exceedingly worse; and perhaps even more real.
"Come on, drink up now, I don't got all bloody night," he's waving the vile arrogantly, the crystal clear liquid sparkling and swashing around as the blonde eyes it wearily.
pure-blood ties so rooted to the Malfoy name.  He had thought about telling his mother and father on
" he sneers, "And what do I owe this obvious unpleasantry," he's surprised to see the Gryffindor in question in the halls, but he doesn't show any sign on his face; instead remaining a complete mask as he turns to the voice in question.
Harry chuckled darkly, breath tickling and teasing at the nape of exposed pale skin on his clavicle.
Heavily recycled words of his parents ring out, hollow and ill placed and empty; beating through his skull.
"Well Malfoy? I asked you a question." the condescending words barely register, the blonde fighting a losing battle for control.
"Don't tell me your scared,Malfoy." The brunette taunts, using famous words that he knows the Slytherin will no doubt pick up on as he quirks a small unseen smile as Draco scowls angrily.
Fingers curl around the perfectly tailored and pressed pants that clung to the Slytherin in all the right way, as Blaise hungrily drinks up how small and weak the blonde looks underneath him as he slides a finger down the front of Draco's pants, teasing the hair just above his naval before moving further down, stroking against the inside of Malfoy's clothes. An unwanted whimper escapes from scared lips as Blaise finally responses to the threat.
He hadn't been looking for it, hadn't asked for it, but somehow as if the room had known, it appeared.
what the Slytherin was thinking as he grabbed onto the lithe blonde's wrist, forcing Malfoy firmly back against the wall.
Now that his best friend had outed him, Draco's too mortified to see what kind of reaction he might get from his nemesis, fully expecting Potter to express his disgust with the blonde's sexual preferences.
"Yes, oh god please, yes let's..." as he curls his arms around Harry’s neck tightly, refusing to let go.
Draco yelps in pain, mouth automatically opening as Harry expertly uses the moment to stick his tongue down his throat, no longer waiting.
Conversation soon laxed into better, safer topics. Discussion over the hottest Quitch players they where putting on starting field this year and up coming classes.
"The likelihood of me and Pansy going at it like the beasts with two backs is about as likely as you ever coming out of Potter's shadow."
"Malfoy, it's okay. He's gone now..." when the shaking blonde still said nothing, instead curling in on himself, Harry pushed on, desperate to fill the awkward silence of witnessing such a moment between his enemy and what was supposed to be Malfoy's 'friend.'
“Fucking hell…” the Slytherin hears the Gryffindor curse quietly, and Draco can’t help but smirk before he discovers the reason of the brunette’s distress.
"Oh, and I'm sure you're so much bloody better Malfoy, I bet you're just right proper in bed. Stiff as a bloody board," Ron shoots back heatedly.
Harry freezes at his words, a look of horror breaking through the irate stance as Draco's skin burns hot to touch; a dark red against his snow white complexed skin as the Slytherin can do nothing more than sputter in mortification.
Harry knew all too well how it was easy to hide feelings and truths when too busy arguing and driving a wedge as nemesis. But after today, Harry knew Draco was no longer his enemy, knowing there was no going back to the way they where before. He had seen such a vulnerable side of Draco that he never even fathomed the boy had, and it was just a shame that he had come across it with such dire circumstances.
"W..what?" Harry blinked lazily, trying to make sense of his surroundings before he realized. He had been caught staring at Malfoy....again.
instead of see. His head is getting worse, swimming in edged blurs by the minute and he wants to relax, to rest his head and he's almost tempted, eyes growing impossibly heavy before realizing he'd have to rest his head on Potter's shoulders; would have to nestle close and bury his angled chin in the crook of the
"Well your not helping any," she hissed back, before more then aggressively needed, inking her quill again. She hated when she had to explain something more then once.
. But only because you promised me such nice things," he huffs with an exaggerated pout that Harry no doubt finds irresistibly charming as he dips slightly to capture Malfoy's lips back with his.
would like that very much, would he? Surprised he let you out to play at all tonight without your leash." and there's that unfamiliar sultry tone that the Slytherin was getting used to hearing, though the blonde was still unsure what it meant other than it was doing something awful and disturbing to the pale boy's insides.
Hermione’s eyes widen at the interaction between the two houses, unable to hear what either boy had been saying; but their body reaction making it apparent.
at full steam as he contemplates before, "Like, does Malfoy wear women's knickers," the off-hand comment is not something Malfoy would have expected from the ginger to say in a million years, and apparently the man feels the same way as Ron
potions and tight proximity has the Slytherin veering as he panics, attempting to wedge himself away before surprisingly strong arms wrap around his torso and pull him back, close.
she responds with fondness in her voice as she finds herself unable to stop from grinning ear to ear.
"O-oh..." is all the blonde can manage, startled by the gentle compassion from his nemesis as he lightly touches the spot again.
"Y-Yes a-a- all the time..." a quiet whimper of want escapes as he lets himself breathe in the Gryffindor's scent; his inhibition for subtle going right out the window.
"Really? You can brush your teeth all on your own like a big boy?" Potters quick, voice cutting sardonically.
..." and this his eyes grow heavy and dark with an expression Malfoy is unfamiliar and unable to place. He doesn't miss the way Potter eyes him up and down quickly with a sly smirk, and Draco can feel his ears burning red as he cocks his head slightly to the side to mask his betraying flushed complexion.
, Draco hates himself a little more inside. He's all too aware of the distant sound of sobbing, the noise to his shock, was coming from his own throat.
things on my own. Just because you have trouble walking and talking at the same time doesn't mean the rest of us struggle with the most basic of functions."
Draco huffed quietly to himself, annoyed at the shotty interrogation Potters friends were giving him as he rolled his eyes, tugging on the brunettes sleeve subtly.
Later the blonde would blame it on the possible concussion he was suffering from, knowing it was a good enough excuse as any as to why he would agree to such an idiotic idea.
He could feel his eyes grow heavy, eyelashes fluttering ever so slowly as he fought to keep awake. Thankfully and unfortunately, he didn't have to fight long.
"Thank you," he whispered quietly, a small smile gracing his lips and Harry's heart absolutely melted at the scene, wanting to replay it over and over again.
"Not always, but I enjoy a nice pair perhaps on a right special day or when I'm feeling extra promiscuous and want to show off. They're very soft you know and I love the way the lace feels against my skin,"
Both Ron and Hermione stopped eating at the same time, glancing at the Slytherin with pointed looks but thankfully said nothing when Harry came up behind the smaller man and coaxed him to sit.
me to take the damn thing!" His trademark snarl is back, ribbed and etched across pale skin as Malfoy fixes the brunette with as much disdain as
The wand moves, steadfast and quick, and it takes everything in Draco's being not to bolt, as he digs his knuckles into the couch and waits.
