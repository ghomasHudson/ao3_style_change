Draco clears his throat. “It’s Draco,” he says, voice coming out soft and small.
“Ginny and Luna are visiting Luna’s father. Bill and Fleur are at her parents’. Hermione’s at Viktor’s. Charlie will be here shortly.” Molly continues stirring her bowl of cake batter. “Now, I want for everyone to be
“Of course I am.” Harry pulls Draco closer to him.
“Seven? He only bet me three!”
the one he needs to worry about. Bill’s drinking a butterbeer, nonplussed like this has happened a thousand times before. Fleur next to him staring at baby Svelte like it brings her memories of the Triwizard tournament as well.
Draco scoffs, louder this time. Harry just hums.
“We should get going,” Harry says to Draco. “You really don’t want to see them fight.”
Draco turns to Ron with a sharp look. “I didn’t choose to leave my family,” he says. “My father disowned me.”
The time Harry and Draco spend with Narcissa makes Harry ache for the Christmas memories he might have had with his mother, or the ones he does have with Molly and the rest of the Weasleys.
“Aww, Ronniekins, we’re just having fun! Right, Perce?” Fred looks to Percy, now a very impressive maroon color.
“She’ll be happy to see you,” Harry says.
“Yes, Molly,” Draco says, though he sounds like he has to choke out her name. “I’m not used to the informalities,” he apologizes.
“You may,” Draco permits.
make sure to make yourself comfortable.” Molly opens up a pot atop the stove. The smell of cooking meat fills the kitchen.
“You could always ask Molly for a jumper of your own.”
“What are you going to do, now that you know my plan? Thwart me?”
“My family’s holidays were far less… chaotic,” Draco replies. “We mostly sat in silence and drank wine.”
Percy shakes his head at that.
“Hm. It’s something important to you. If… If my father still wanted me around, I would’ve asked you to go to my Christmas.” Draco leans his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco pauses. “Can we?” he asks, hopeful.
“Mum, it’s just a little one!” Charlie insists, back turned to Draco and Harry, showing his family something.

“I don’t care what anyone says about me
way. It’s more of an
They stand there, embracing as mother and son. Harry wonders what it was like to grow up with a mother. Molly is a lovely surrogate mother, but he wishes he had grown up with a mother like his friends and Draco had. Those formative childhood years with a mother didn’t happen. They happened in his teens. He had Petunia and his childhood of abuse instead.
“Because you’re always so convincing.” Draco curls up against Harry, sighing contentedly. “I suppose we should make a visit to the Burrow then.”
After a long drink of butterbeer, Ron grins at Harry and Hermione.
Molly smiles a little at him. “Well, you’re not exactly the most subtle person, are you? You and Draco started getting close, and Ron said some things that made me wonder… Oh, I should’ve asked, just in case.” She glances over at him. “I thought you’d make a good couple since you retook your last year of Hogwarts together. You’ve always rather liked him a lot, haven’t you?”
“Three?” Fred covers his heart with a hand. “My dear Ronniekins, you’re trying to cheat our dearest Georgie out of his due!”
“Well, it’s…” Harry looks up from his tea, but doesn’t want to look into Molly’s eyes, so he looks at the family clock over her shoulder. Most of the hands are at Work, or even Bed (Harry notices it’s Ron, and smiles to himself at that). He sees his own at Home, further warming his heart. But there’s another hand, also pointed at Work. “Hang on, is that a new hand on the clock?”
“Hello everyone! Sorry we’re late!” Ginny grins at them all. “Harry! You brought Draco!”
Percy goes an even darker shade of red. “This really isn’t something to discuss at-”
They apparate into the Leaky Cauldron and ask for Narcissa Black (it’s Draco’s idea to use her maiden name, brilliant Draco). After getting her room number, they travel up to it. Draco takes a moment to steady himself before knocking.
“Yes, yes,” Harry says, running his calloused hand through Draco’s silken hair.
Oliver waves cheerily. “Happy Christmas, Harry!”
“Thank you,” he whispers, because he never felt like he’d thanked her enough when she’d saved him. He probably never could. As far as he’s concerned, there will never be a way to thank her enough for what she’s done for him; he has so many debts to people that he will never be able to repay, so many people who have died for him and sacrificed everything for him. There are people he will never be able to thank properly. He continues to profusely thank those he can. It’s the least he can do, in his opinion.
“You’ll be able to come, won’t you, dear?” Molly asks, face falling. “Christmas isn’t the same if everyone isn’t there.”
“Are you going to take me behind that shed?” Draco asks playfully.
“I’m stealing your identity,” Draco says, slipping off his coat and scarf. “This is simply the first step.”
Ron hands them both a butterbeer. “Charlie just came in with- with
“Hey, Harry! Check this out!” George yells.
“And Harry, dear, feel free to sit down and get comfortable with Draco,” Molly says, sweet as can be with her adopted son.
“We can stay out here for a while,” Harry suggests. “Getting away from all the people… it’s nice, isn’t it?”
“Don’t be,” Harry says. “It’s alright.”
Even being in the Burrow- the second home he’d ever had, after Hogwarts, and one that has certainly never tried to kill him before- fills Harry with warmth. Between the homely feeling and Molly’s maternal worrying, he feels right at home.
Ron comes in with a butterbeer. “Harry! Bloody hell, I was worried you weren’t gonna come.” He looks at Draco. “See you’ve brought Malfoy. Good for you, bringing ‘im. Prob’ly needs some time out in the real world.”

“Thanks, mate,” Ron says, taking his from Harry.
“Shut up, Perce,” Ron says. He drinks from his butterbeer.
Molly’s smile returns, full-force. “That’s absolutely
Draco stops walking to lean against Harry’s side. Harry wraps his arm around Draco’s shoulder, pulling him close. “This is the nicest Christmas I’ve had in a while.”
“How did it go?” Draco says, as if he doesn’t care.
“Very, very wonderful. Be careful, this time of the year. There’re Nargles in the mistletoe.” Luna looks at Harry and Draco with her pretty, wide eyes. “Try not to kiss underneath it.”
Ron pops around from the kitchen. “Oi, then, you two! Bloody hell, we’ve been looking ‘round for you

“Oh! Umm, thank you, Dudley. You know you didn’t have to. This morning was an accident. We aren’t about to kick you out for burning toast-”
“For being here, with me. For always being here.”
“Draco?” Harry murmured, blinking in the darkness.
“On the top shelf in the cupboard in the bathroom,” Harry called back, sighing quietly as he did so.
Lilies.
He waved at briefly at Hermione from where she stood in the corner talking to some high-end official. She was campaigning for a new Rights Act to be passed, but from what he had heard, it was a long road. She was patient though.
“Are you off to Hogwarts as well?” The other boy, having apparently only just noticed him, turned.
He was an idiot. That was the only way to describe him. Harry was an idiot. Why, oh why, oh why, did he think going out and getting drunk on a Sunday night was even remotely close to being a good idea?
“No hexing each other in the halls,” he agreed.
Draco stormed out, muttering something along the lines of, “You’ll regret this, Potter.”
By seven thirty most of the small dorm were making their way down to the dining hall.  A few were still getting ready, and a couple had wandered off to the library to return the books they had finished, but most were there.
“g- morning,” murmured a still sleepy Harry.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat, his heart lodged somewhere nearby, still not quite functioning. Useless thing. Despite his body’s useless organs, his eyes never strayed from the blonde kneeling before him. Dashing and sweet. Handsome and kind. Beautiful and honest. Had he mentioned he was good looking?
- enough. It was never enough.
As far as he could tell, he received the same tie every year. Red wasn’t really his colour but there wasn’t much to be done about it. He had had a couple extras the ‘crush’ year, but the same one was still there. At least, he guessed it was the same one. He didn’t know where his own tie ended up, and honestly, he wasn’t too keen on finding out. What if they were in fact wrong for each other or the other person hated him? There were way too many ifs for Draco to consider it even close to a good plan.
He often traded rooms with Hermione. She was a silent waker, who liked to be left alone to cry into her pillow, and Ron gave her that, but Harry… He woke screaming.
He felt and heard his aunt come in like a jolt of electricity as she announced the two other people she had found. Having been convinced of their identities given the companions obvious traits, the three were quickly locked away downstairs with his cousin, Luna.
The Draco’s eyes shone as he plucked the blossoms from their place and spun them betwixt his fingers, humming a very familiar tune among couples.
Despite the mixed messages of the flower, it was beautiful.
“Harry!” Dudley almost yelled as they arrived home, “I’m sorry about early. And I am really sorry Mr. Malfoy about all your appliances… And so, I wanted to make it up to you both!” The pair exchanged a worried glance as Dudley turned excitedly to get something off Mitsy behind him. “I baked you these!” he said thrusting the…
Despite it all, there was trust between them. They knew what the other was feeling. From the look in each other’s eyes and the tilt of their heads, they could tell.
“Alright, that’s enough!” the headmistress said one day, having called the offending heads of houses into her office. “I don’t know why I expected you two of all people to have any of the maturity or dignity befitting of your age or position.” She shook her head. “I don’t know who started this-” Harry made to interrupt but she raised her hand to silence him, “and I don’t particularly care. I’m ending it. This will be the end of it, correct?”
His knees had given out under him a while ago and he was kneeling down beside the boy’s grave, his chest leant forward in a semi-fetal position. His hands were holding his head, as though they could contain the screams in his chest.
He ordered a water for himself and sat down to wait, glancing at his watch from time to time. Most wizards didn’t use them and favoured a tempus charm instead, but he liked his watch all the same. It was functional, even without magic. When he was young he’d taught himself how to tell time, and been fascinated with clocks ever since. It had been hard tracking down a watch that could cope within the magical worlds, and he really loved it now.
He didn’t think it was schizophrenia. He had brought in a few cases as an Auror and it wasn’t like what he was going through. The voices, seemed to be… his own. One after the other telling him he wasn’t good enough; that no one loved him; that his parents had died in vain. They just kept going, and kept getting worse.
Draco really didn’t like Valentine’s day.
Draco had always thought rain was a bit cliché, but he was glad of it now.
No, he definitely hadn’t thought too much about it. But it didn’t matter anyway. No matter how much he overanalysed, or changed his behaviour to suit others, nothing seemed to work. No one stayed. No one cared.
Usually the blossoms appeared on important occasions. A celebration. A birthday. A promotion. A memorial.
It was about five thirty when a knock sounded on the doorframe and in walked Granger and Greengrass. Without a word the two girls sat down in the circle and waited to be dealt into the game. They couldn’t sleep either. It was an unspoken, unanimously acknowledged, truth that no one need speak aloud. The silence was comfortable.
… feathers?
“As I recall, I turned
“I wasn’t sure you’d come.”
When he finally did sleep, he dreamt of the fiendfyre. Dreamt of Draco yelling his name. Dreamt he was racing toward the blonde. Always a little out of reach. Always a little behind the mark. Never catching up. Never enough. It wasn’t going to be enough. He had to-
“Yeah, but I figured you’d earned it. We can worry about that tomorrow.”
“What do you mean you aren’t sure? If this is the boy, the dark lord will forgive our mistakes. Take another look,” his father called from behind him.
“Wait… you stalked me?” Draco asked Incredulously - quite probably focusing on the wrong point - and burst out laughing. Harry’s face turned beet red.
Legends spoke of how the grey eyes were like an illusion. They merely masked the colours of everyone’s eyes. Everybody could see their own eye colour, and that of their soulmate.
It had been six months since the War and since then a lot had happened. For the most part though, it all just boiled down to him being pardoned and becoming and Auror. Potter and Weasley were accepted as Aurors too. Big surprise there…
“I heard you were the flying instructor this year,” the blonde said, seeming to be struggling for conversation topics. Nevertheless, he was still trying to be cordial for some reason yet unknown to Harry.
“Yes. He is for the moment. It shouldn’t be long now.”
“This- This is because of me, isn’t it?”
---------------
“What wasn’t?” the raven asked, blinking innocently.
“Friends?” Harry said raising his eyebrows, making Draco more nervous than he was willing to admit. Then the boy grinned. “I think we can do friends. I bet we will be friends like no other. We will be the absolute greatest friends. No one will be as a good a friend as I will be.”
“Yeah, that’s pretty accurate. You were a prat though.”
“-or destroying the rest of the kitchen,” muttered a still petty blonde.
Lips pressed against Harry’s, gentle at first before he pressed back, desperation and sorrow and love fuelling him.
“I am afraid of ducks, okay!” he yelled, then clasped a hand over his mouth.
“The fact that I nearly died… it changes nothing. You weren’t speaking to me! The fact that you now somehow feeling responsible for me doesn’t change the fact that we have issues to work out.”
“Evidently not,” the raven said, pulling off a grim smile as he tried, and failed, to wipe away some of the snot and tears streaming down his face.
It wasn’t that he didn’t like the day exactly. He thought a day based around love and loving people was sort of sweet, if overly commercialised and marketed to the point of being annoying. Since he was young, it had become tradition for him to get something for his mother. He liked the day itself, but at Hogwarts, it was just a pain.
“Why do they change like that?” Harry had to admit it was kind of cute watching the blonde choke as he refocused, coughing and spluttering on Harry’s question, though he was curious as to why.
“Phones.”
“I wanted to, but with everything that’s been happening, with you being judged for your past-” Draco flinched, “-it was just never the right time. I wanted to be there to support you, and I would never want to be a burden-”
“So, they only sharpen around people you don’t trust or believe might have ill-intent?” Draco swallowed nervously, but nodded.
--------------------------------------------------------
It just didn’t make sense.
“What’s gotten into you Harry?”
They sat down together in the space left of them at the end of the table. Hermione was on the other side, reading, with Ron was beside her. Ron was… well. Ron was whining.
“So, just to be clear, if I wanted to take you somewhere none-duck infested, that would be okay?” The boy nodded, a blush still evident on his features. “Great, then I will see you tomorrow night for dinner. I’ll come and pick you up at seven.”
“I hate you.”
Draco had always thought rain was a bit cliché, but he was glad of it now.
---------------------------------------------------
The blonde smiled down at the growing piles of jars, glasses and vases scattered around his office ranging from his desk to the windowsill and even his bookcases. Several shelves of which were Muggle botany books about flowers and weeds. Dandelions and the language of flowers. Ultimately he found nothing of use, nothing that he could link to a sender or purpose let alone an identity, but it was a relaxing read when life became hectic.
As morbid as it sounds, everyone in each boy’s life was either dead, not worth knowing, or ‘off making goo goo eyes at each other’ as Draco put it, in one of his more ineloquent moments.
“…I was going to,” Harry replied quietly, his eyes lowering as he spoke. “I really was, but it was never the right time. You were having a hard time at work…” he smiled weakly, mostly at his poor reasoning but also because of the memories of the two of them. The days they would spend together. Happy or sad, Draco was his.
It was never the right time.
With a small smile, he continued on his way down to the great hall. There were only a few teachers there. More would be arriving throughout the day, but it didn’t matter. They’d be here in plenty of time to greet the students that evening.
“Third floor, room 6. The doctor is waiting…” the voice trailed off. Okay, maybe the voice wasn’t trailing, but it didn’t matter. He was already running again.  The doors passed by him in a blur, and when the elevator wouldn’t come quickly enough, he ran up the stairs instead. He barely had time to breath before he had burst out of the stairwell on to the third floor, and had bolted for the sixth room.
“Same cupboard, two shelves down.”
“Harry, you seem to be in a good mood.” He looked up from his reverie to greet the new Headmistress. The war had aged her, but she was still just Professor McGonagall, only with a few extra white hairs.
,” Draco moaned, head in his hands. Harry supposed he was having a rough morning.
“Are you going to give me any kind of straight answer?”
“Hmmm? Oh, this- this was a… gift, for tonight.”
“What?” the other boy said, finally seeming to come out of whatever trance he had been in, consumed by his own emotions, as he raised his head to look Draco in the eye.
“Draco… we are not dilly-dallying so that my cousin gets mauled. Now come on.”
“What about this afternoon?”
One minute since his heart had fallen to the floor and shattered.
Finding little elsewhere, the raven returned to the bookcase, skimming the spines and titles…
“The Boy Who Lived, Twice, loves you, and we will not take that away from him, not yet. It would be cruelly ironic to have him save the world only for him to return having lost the only thing he found worthy of saving the world for, don’t you think?” the voice continued humourlessly, but seemingly, strangely, pleased with itself for its assessment. “So, scoot,” was the last thing he heard the voice say before he blacked out.
--------------------------------------------
Draco was starting to stress due to a certain potions final he had later, evident by the now burning toast.
Some days just sucked, and Harry, being Harry, always comforted his boyfriend. Harry listened to his complaints, found ways to cheer him up, cooked him his favourite meals. And just generally comforted him, and the talk of voices and depression was left for another day. It wasn’t the right time.
“What’s going on, Harry? You want to talk about something?”
“I have a few scores to settle with this lot. Call it… repaying a few debts, blood debts,” he grinned sadistically. He knew he looked sadistic. He had been studying the look ever since Voldemort started living in his house, whether he wished to see it or not. It was becoming a little too easy to fake emotions now. He thought though that it was a shame it never worked on one person… Said person was now staring at him, smirking coldly, playing the part, but his eyes were still soft, forgiving even. It hardly mattered. If you had not spent half your life staring into them you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference, and the blundering idiot of a man beside him, quite evidently couldn’t.
Maybe he was wrong. Maybe this year wouldn’t be quite as depressing and horrific as he had previously envisioned it.
“Humans.”
“So, I guess nothing has changed then… git.”
“A bad place!?” the raven said, startling the young witch out of her monologue. “Sure. A bad place. I respect Fleur all the more for not telling you, but you have no clue Hermione!”
“Harry so help me if you get distracted again and point that lumos in my eyes one more time I swear to Merlin-”
“Did you just- Did you just… agree with me?” Harry mock-gaped.
At the last second, a student rushed past him, very nearly pushing him into the blonde, but Draco flinched away, somehow making himself even smaller than he already seemed, avoiding any contact.
“No,” the mop huffed, squeezing himself between Draco and his pillow. “Not going… Day off.”
He sighed.
It continued that way, people just walking in and joining each game. By seven o’clock there was one game of Uno going, a round of Sorry, one chess match, and a game of checkers going in the corner. Laughter filled the room, friendly accusations of cheating were made, mostly around Ron’s chess board.
“Because Draco chose you. The magic in this place is very old Harry. It values traditions. And Draco, consciously, or unconsciously, chose you, and tied your magic signature in doing so. The manor, and the elves here, see you as much of a young master as they do Draco, because you are his intended bonded, and-” The witch paused, as something seemed to claw at her throat. “-And, should Draco, not make it, you will be the sole heir.”
“No! Really? What was your first clue?” he asked, the sarcasm almost as heavy as the smell of liquor in his breath.
“This is young master Draco’s room, young master Harry. Tibby will leave you here. Be sure to call Tibby if the young master should need anything,” and with that, the elf was gone.
“I wondered where you had gotten to,” a voice said from behind Draco. He knew Harry was there. He had been there for the last few minutes. He wasn’t sure how he knew but there it was. “I didn’t see you in the great hall.”
--------------------
“So, for goodness sake Ron stop pestering us about it!” Harry continued still in good humour. The table, or at least their end, laughed.
“His eyes are the most beautiful shade of emerald green you could imagine,” he smiled. There was a pause.
“She always is,” Draco added.
“Thank you, Tibby,” Harry murmured, following the elf out with a final glance at the unconscious blonde.
They strolled around Diagon Alley in silence, quiet but comfortable, glancing from shopfront to shopfront; watching the people coming and going; seeing children excitedly dragging around their guardians to prepare for the coming school year.
So, he kept watch on the dark forces at work, and mingled among them as their own. He watched the green-eyed boy and taunted him.
“No, I suppose not.”
“Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Did they hurt you anywhere?”
Harry took a breath. It was just a door. It was a door. A simple door with a human being on the other side of it. Nothing to be afraid of. Only it wasn’t just a door. This wasn’t simple at all, and to some extent Harry wasn’t even sure the person on the other side of the door could be called human.
“Well, thank you.
“Yeah… It -It’ll be fine,” Harry mumbled, his voice barely audible with his face buried in the blondes shoulder.
Regardless of their mutually agreed upon cease-fire, or perhaps as a result of it - old habits die hard after all - not even a week after the beginning of term, nor even a week after the forming of their tentative truce, saw Harry and Draco in the midst of a prank war.
“That’s great!” Draco announced, much to the other boy’s confusion. “I’m Draco by the way. I came here with my family. My father is off getting me a broom. I wanted him to get me a racing broom, but he said I wouldn’t need one…” he rambled on. He didn’t usually ramble he noticed absentmindedly.  He wanted to put his mate at ease, but it didn’t seem to be working as the boy cowered, somewhat subtly, into himself the more he spoke. He paused, notice the boy’s unease and was just about to ask what was wrong or if there was something he could get him, before the boy spoke.
“It’s not funny! They’re terrifying!”
Pain filled him, just before he was enveloped in darkness.
The last one had barely hit the floor when Draco had return to him, grey eyes clouded with concern.
“So… um, how far how away do you live?”
“But… I thought you chose me…”
It wasn’t until he passed a mirror, that he stopped dead. His eyes, they were grey again. Of all the- Of course. If anyone was going to stop their soulmates heart and then promptly rise from the dead to fight the Lord of Darkness, it had to be Harry. Show-off.
Okay so maybe it wasn’t her fault. That was possibly, slightly, over specific and demanding, but that didn’t change his current predicament. No surprise there.
“That wasn’t fair,” the blonde pouted.
“You’re welcome…” Harry mumbled, as Draco’s arms snaked around him, his breath a warm tickle on his ear, the cool air of a silencing charm a stark contrast.
“Shut up Malfoy.” The blond smirked. “There is a slight issue with your plan though. We are three now. We have a guest. We can’t go wandering around for hours and leave him alone.”
“Veela magic?”
A month later and they were coming several times a week. Sometimes even more than one in a day, but only ever one at a time.
His brain, apparently noticing the lack of attention he was paying to… well anything, decided to revert to his automatic, formal, pure-blooded dialect. To put it more simply, he acted like a stuck-up prat. He didn’t mean to, really, he didn’t. He would curse himself later for ever speaking those words and making such a terrible impression, but speak them he did.
Resolutely deciding that this was a terrible idea, he left the Slytherin common room - a blanket under one arm in case the other person was in fact still out there getting cold - and headed for the lake, all the while his brain chanted “This is a terrible idea, Draco!” or the like, as he walked.
And, he found such a lady to court, though he did not love her. The lady beseeched him to replace his heart, but it was not to end happily. The Warlock could not so easily undo the mistakes passed, and there he died, at the side of the fair maiden he might have called his wife, had he not been so foolish.
“Well, what are we supposed to do? Banish him away to his room for even longer, or say ‘sure why not, the more childhood bullies for cuddle time the better!’?” Draco pouted. “Fine, sorry, that wasn’t fair, and I don’t see you that way anymore my love, but you know what I mean.”
---------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
Harry didn’t really think too much about it at first.
Two flowers sat on the windowsill that afternoon. The blonde didn’t even notice as he glanced at his… seventh? Eighth? Tempus charm in the last fifteen minutes.
----------------------------------------
2. The potions he made were working.
“Fair, but there was at least one person down there that wanted to talk to you.”
They had somehow been able to form a routine at the very least. He ate dinner alone, and lunch beside the sleeping blonde, but he joined Narcissa for breakfast. The elderly witch had seemed to age in just a few days, or perhaps weeks. She had seemed so removed at first, but even though she hardly spoke, it was softer now, and a little fragile.
“Yes, you went to get me more apples for pie. So what?”
“I see.”
“No worries, Draco. We will inform everyone that you are off limits,” the green-eyed boy replied, seemingly without a second thought. Did the boy ever take a second thought? How was he still alive?
It was perfect. Okay maybe a little wet, and he hadn’t figured out what to do with his tongue yet, but otherwise… He imagined living his entire life just for this moment. It would have been worth it.
“It will pass Mr. Potter. I assure you-” He whirled on her then.
“Someone found Mr. Potter at the bottom of a bridge. The official story is that he had a broom accident, but we suspect…” the doctor trailed off, seeing the pain and understanding flash through the other man’s eyes. “His wounds have been, or are, currently being healed. He will make a full physical recovery,” the man stated, and then paused. Merlin, Draco hated pauses.
“Yep, just let me wrap up this last order-” Harry started to say but was cut off by the sound of Draco’s laugh.
“You do realise that this is a crappy plan and we will probably all die?” the blond asked grimly. It had been a long day, long year really. Draco acting as a double double double dou- you know what, he’s just given up trying to figure it out. Long story short he is a spy for the good guys - without half of them knowing it - and agent of the dark lord, but not really. Draco had received word about Voldemort coming to the school, and, amongst everything else, the two boys had come up with a plan. A terrible, idiotic, ridiculous, mostly Potter’s idea, kind of plan.
No matter how stupid his plan was, was he going to do it anyway?
“Then what is it?” Draco screamed, before he could think twice about it. Harry took another breath.
They trudged out of her office, tails between their legs, though when Harry had made comment on that fact later Draco had most ardently denied the fact that a Malfoy would ever have done such a thing.  Harry merely smiled knowingly, at which Draco just glared.
“So, what now?” the raven-haired boy asked.
“Not everything in life can be planned for, Harry.”
Finally, there was no one left, not that he could see anyway. Draco crept forward easing his way between the floral arrangements that were laid out several metres out on each side. There had been a lot of people in attendance.
“Don’t go, please.”
“You… wanted to kiss me?” Harry murmured, still blinking.
-----------------
“It’s our day off! I thought we could go to park for a stroll, or maybe the shops, and then have a relaxing afternoon to ourselves.”
“As the young master wishes,” the elf nodded.
“Well maybe except for me, Scar-head.”
“Harry, I spoke to Fleur.” He tensed. “Don’t freak out. She didn’t spill your secrets, but she did say you’d be in bad place for a bit-”
The days passed slowly.
It didn’t start as much. Simple sighs or grimaces when they walked away from first dates. The disappointed looks when they said it was over. The same looks that only made his insecurities worse.
! Sorry, umm, but he is mostly right. Draco and I are married, going on three years,” Harry smiled. A pale and confused Dudley finally put all the pieces together and started blushing.
“Because whoever did it is a freaking genius,” he said, tears running down his face as he shook from laughter.
“Good morning, Harry! I wasn’t sure if you’d be awake, so I just thought I’d make some breakfast, but the toaster, didn’t really want to work for me. Or the fridge, or umm…. Sorry…” Dudley mumbled, as Harry’s eyes roamed over the destroyed kitchen. Previously charmed items were apparently resistant to… muggle use. Not surprising, really, but it would seem kitchen repairs was about to take priority on their list of things to do today if they ever wanted to eat again. There went their Saturday… Oh well. It would happen. Eventually.
He was so going to get Potter back for that…
“Hey Harry,” the young witch greeted giving him a quick hug. “I’m glad you could make it.”
“-on his last mission.”
“And you wanted until this year to tell me because why?”
Well, he’d been right, for once. He had told Minerva he’d ‘burn that bridge when he came to it’ and things seemed pretty well toasted.
There was a boy sitting at the edge of the lake. His hair was dark, and messy, and hard to make out given the fact that there was no longer a sun in the sky. Just when he thought the night couldn’t get any colder, the boy spoke as heart his stopped and the night turned colder, or hotter, he wasn’t really sure any more.
“What am I going to Mrs. Malfoy?”
----------------------------------------------
? What will pass Mrs. Malfoy!” he asked, staring at her, something dangerous lurking beneath the surface.
(ps. I make no promises about it being any happier, but A for effort? No?)
I am going to make this three parts (this is part 2/3). So, I hope you stick around :)
“Young Master, Harry. It’s unusual to see you here, is there something Tibby can get for you?”
“Where is she?”
“Which one of us?” George grins wickedly.
“That’s what they’ll say, at the least.”
“The people worth keeping in my life are the ones that’ll be okay with our relationship,” Harry says.
Draco smiles, so brightly Harry could light the night sky with it. When Draco is happy, he rivals the sun. “I’d like that.”
Draco looks at Harry with pure terror written across his face.
encourage this!”
“Yes, Mrs. Weasley.”
“No,” Harry says. “I’m being realistic.
Harry laughs at that. “I’m pretty sure you don’t want me to defile you behind a shed in
“I think you might want to answer this,” Harry says.
Molly rests her hand on his shoulder. “Does it upset you?”
Ron hardly blinks before slinging his arm around Harry’s shoulders. “Ah, so you two
“We can visit, if you’d like.”
“Some wanker I picked off the street,” Harry answers drily.
and every tabloid in print, right? Everyone will be talking about us.”
“Do you have to ask?” Draco looks pale, and not in his typical
“Harry, dear! Come in!” Molly moves aside, ushering Harry and Draco in. “Almost everyone’s here!” She leads them to the living room.
Draco awkwardly clings to Harry’s side, glancing around the room. “You’re missing some people,” he observes.
“Well, if he makes you happy, then we’ll like him well enough, won’t we?” Molly squeezes his shoulder. “Draco’s welcome for Christmas, just like everyone else is. I’ve already started on his jumper.”
Ron glances at Hermione, ready to inch away at the mention of
Harry flips the page of his paper. “Maybe I’ll steal yours, then. If you keep stealing mine.”
“Of course,” Harry says. He stands and shows Draco into the kitchen. Butterbeers and other assorted spirits rest in the sink.
Harry picks up a few butterbeers. He hands Draco one and walks back into the living room with the other two.
“Maybe we shouldn’t be doing this,” Ron suggests, also flushed in embarrassment.
“We could go see her,” Harry suggests. “I have a feeling Molly is going to take a while with the twins.”
“It’s just a jumper. Don’t make it mean something.”
Draco's face must have fallen because the healer placed a hand on his shoulder, "You should not feel guilty, this was not your fault. You could not save him from this."
"Of all the things I've done while I was - not me - abandoning Teddy feels the worst," Harry groans.
"What's the matter?" Harry looked her over with concern.
"Just leave," George sighs.
Draco was very upset with Harry when he met him at the Burrow with the children, but he was mollified by James' mortified recounting of the entire story (with some key details removed).
"Harry bought me a Crup, she arrives next week," Draco sniffs but gives Harry a watery smile. Everyone laughs at Harry's coddling.
Draco watched Nott flick a curse at Hermione and had no time to think of anything clever, he simply threw himself in front of her and hoped he'd get there in time. As he felt the blood pumping out of his chest, Draco felt eerily calm. She was safe, his friend 'Mione was safe. He'd never been brave enough to use the nickname out loud, but whenever she gave him one of her stern talks he'd thought it gleefully.
He shifted to lean against Draco's leg and propped up his Herbology textbook on his lap and tried to continue reading about Moondew. Harry felt Draco's hand card through his hair idly and relaxed into the touch. His nightmares had been worse than ever after he hurt Draco and had been sharing a bed with him since the first night Draco was back in their dorm. Blaise had switched rooms with Harry once he and Justin started dating seriously. Harry felt a little guilty at how pleased it made him to be sharing Draco's bed again. He knew Draco would never love him back, but Harry was just happy to be close friends again.
"Healer Malfoy assures me you have no memories past the moment of injury until you awoke three days ago, is that correct?" Luna asked.
They laugh before Senior Auror Dawlish points them over to a cabinet to work on.
"You hated every man I ever dated, you try to get along with my mother more than any casual friend should bother and you make a point of ensuring I am invited to any and all social events that you are," Draco rumbled a laugh.
"I have another gift for you." Harry pulled out the hastily wrapped box from his jacket and held it out.
"Oh, er." Harry cast around for something to distract Charlie and saw Celia's faintly annoyed expression while watching Draco help Molly. "I'm going to tell Draco that I love him."
Sneaking another sidelong glance at Draco, who was fondly smiling at George while he pulled Ron into a headlock, Harry felt another wave of irritation wash over him. The monster in his chest had been pacing and snarling for weeks. Harry sighed, he wasn't going to to calm down sitting here with everyone. Pushing off while grabbing the cradle, he grunted a goodnight to everyone and headed upstairs to put Teddy to bed. He heard light steps behind him, sighed again and faced Hermione. She put a finger to her lips, gesturing to the sleeping baby. Harry activated the nursery charms to his wand and headed upstairs, following Hermione. She wandered into the library and cast a
"Fourteen weeks," Draco gives Harry a glowing look.
Narcissa, Andromeda, Draco and Teddy were seated together, but were joined by Molly, Arthur, George, Hermione, Ron and Ginny. "Harry!" Hermione had crushed him into a hug. She looked thin, he was sure he did too, but clean and rested. Harry relaxed, he had felt unsettled being without his friends after months with only each other to rely on. Harry moved to sit in the empty space between Andromeda and Molly and was immediately confronted by a large plate of food shoved in front of him. He looked at the source, but it wasn't Kreacher as expected, but Draco. Draco slipped a cool hand under his collar again,
"Just generally being a massive cunt to everyone. We put up with it for a good year and a half. The wedding day and then the thing with Ginny pretty much sealed our family shutting you out," Ron supplies.
"What do you think happened to his lip?" Arthur asked Molly under his breath.
"She's wrong. She's dead wrong. I can even tell you the moment I realised I was hopelessly gone on you. You'd brought me a cup of tea, unasked, at the exact moment I was thinking that it was time for one. You put two ginger biscuits on the saucer, because you know I don't like sweet things with my tea. I was about to say 'I love you' in response to that and I panicked because it was true." Harry swallowed and reached for Draco's arm, to turn him around.
Ron started sobbing and clenched his hand around Harry's lifeless one.
Harry is crushed under the weight of the cabinet but doesn't feel too badly injured, until a strange looking gem slides down a shelf and onto his forehead. A blinding crimson light envelops Harry, his last thought of Draco and the engagement ring sitting in his desk at work.
Harry had a problem with his sexuality, maybe he was just uncomfortable because they'd shared a bed most nights before Draco went away. Both of them had consistent nightmares after the funerals had started and it was easier to sleep with the warm weight of someone else beside them. They'd shared so many secrets in the quiet hours before dawn, Harry had told Draco about his cruel Muggle relatives and Draco had shared how his arm had been carved up by Death Eaters as revenge for not taking the mark and failing Voldemort so many times.
They slowly descended the stairs, stopping twice more for kisses, before rejoining their family in the dining room. Harry flushed deeply at the knowing looks both Hermione and Narcissa gave him.
"So, you've got a good idea why everyone hates you, then," Draco states bluntly.
Harry knew he wasn't really angry at his friends, he was angry at himself. Draco had gone to Australia and kissed a boy. A boy who was not Harry. Harry hadn't been handling the information well and had been moody with Draco since. Narcissa - who had insisted on Harry calling her Cissa - had noticed and quietly told Harry that "one does not punish a beloved when one does not own one's feelings entirely". Harry didn't quite understand the statement but gathered she meant that he couldn't be pissy at Draco when Harry hadn't told him how he felt. Harry indignantly thought that Draco should
Susan and Harry comply, the cabinet glowing a soft mint green.
here with my son?" Narcissa's eyes were softened by the wrinkles from her frequent smiling but her flinty glare was as effective as ever.
Harry sits down cautiously opposite him, "Yes, I understand completely."
"Ron told me." George threw his brother under the bus, followed by Bill and Charlie.
Hermione heard the doors to the Hospital Wing open, a familiar mess of black hair caught her eye and she stood with her wand pointed at his chest. She registered the hurt on Harry's face and gripped her wand tighter. Harry was her brother, but Draco had barely survived Harry's Knockback Jinx. She was consumed with how devastated she had been to have to re-inflate his lungs after Harry broke all of his ribs. Harry looked miserable and drawn, like he hadn't been sleeping. "Er, 'Mione, I just... I just want to know how he is." Hermione's temper flared again. Draco hadn't woken up yet, between the damage from the Slytherins' attack and Harry's Jinx. "He's alive, Harry. You nearly took care of that though."
"Harry, it's the 2nd of March. In 2005," Draco crosses his arms.
"Why won't they be yours?" Harry was confused.
Harry yawned and stared out the window. A cold and dry February had turned into a miserably chilly and wet March. He was curled up on Draco's bed with Pansy and Luna. Luna was twisting conjured flowers into Draco's hair while he sat on the floor reading. Ginny was gushing about her new Harpy robes which had arrived that morning on Neville's bed, her back resting against Neville's chest. Neville looked like he had never been more content, just smiling to himself and staring at the rain thrashing the dormitory window. Pansy was flicking through a Muggle magazine, Cosmopolitan. Harry had been shocked when he saw the magazine in her hands. Pansy shrugged and told him Muggle clothes were cuter.
"Sliced him up with a spell before Mother could get her wand up," Draco shuddered, "Then Anja turned on me, Mother stepped in front of the curse. It was a Wasting Curse, it takes your magic, your mind and then your life."
Harry hears laughing upstairs, the gleeful shriek of a child and stands up, "Teddy?"
Narcissa drew herself up, "Alright, well, we have much to do, lets determine who will organise each task, it will be less overwhelming if we share the burden I think." Hermione nodded from the end of the table, she already had her quill hovering over parchment, restlessly waiting for something busy to do. Harry spoke up, "I'd like to help with everything. What I can do?" Narcissa smiled at Harry and Andy squeezed his hand. "Agreed, Harry. Hermione, I wonder if you and Ginny could contact the florists. Arthur, could you contact Kingsley for help with a secure location?" Harry settled into his chair, feeling finally that he had a real place in a family and smiled to himself.
"It's difficult to get much appetite going," Draco mumbled.
"No..." Ron is on his knees.
"Draco fucking Malfoy. Boy, did you blow the right hero, huh?" Nott kept his wand dead centre, pointing to Draco's chest. Hermione cast a wandless Shield Charm, cursing internally about not practicing wandless
"I was an idiot. I panicked. I knew I'd found men attractive, but it was an abstract thing. I'd never loved one. I thought I'd never love anyone after Gin died. I ran to Ron and Hermione's and after a day they managed to get it out of me. Ron told me I was a right tit and that no-one was going to begrudge me for falling for the man who'd become the second parent to my kids. Then Hermione tore into me about leaving you like that and I felt so guilty I stayed another night." Harry stepped closer to Draco, who was still watching him like he was a circling basilisk.
Draco's chair scraped as he got up and left without excusing himself. Harry dithered for a moment before everyone's eyes turned to him and he raced out after Draco. He heard thundering steps going up the stairs and took them two at a time, coming to a halt behind Draco who was looking around Ron's old room with a disconcerted expression. Harry closed the door behind himself quietly.
Harry chugged down the rest of his drink and met Andromeda's knowing gaze. Narcissa and Andromeda would never be so childish as to name a group 'Phoenix Team' but he didn't doubt they encouraged the antics.
Harry grabs some jeans and a shirt off the floor and races down the hall to the bathroom there. He locks himself inside and steps into the shower, scrubbing himself frantically. Harry catches sight of a tattoo on his leg and stares.
Yes, I'm fine. Let me out of the damn bed. Why am I restrained? God, Healers are pricks. Who cares if I had internal bleeding from the blast? I'm fine now, let me go home. Well, to Hogwarts. Oh, they've called Molly in. Fuck, I feel awful. She has enough to deal with without me being her problem. I know she was upset when they wouldn't agree to let her and Arthur adopt me, just because I'm 'of age'. It's nice that she wanted to.
Hermione and Ron fall silent as Harry grapples with this new information, "Anything else?"
"I dunno about enemies," Harry snuck a look at the blonde, "Cautious acquaintances?"
"Harry!"
He Apparated to the small flat that Hermione and Ron shared and banged on the door.
"Er, 3rd March 2000?" Harry frowned, trying to remember the date of the first field assignment.
Hermione pressed a kiss to Harry's nose, a gesture echoed by Ron, both of them wishing Draco a good night.
"I didn't," Draco speaks up.
"Where is this going?" Draco grunted.
"No, all fine. We missed you though. Did you enjoy your evening?" Harry tried to keep the wistful expression off his face while watching Draco and his daughter.
"Believe it, I had to pick up the pieces of you telling Drommy that she was some money grubbing spinster who was clearly trying to con a 'celebrity' out of child support," Narcissa scolded. "Never mind that she has never asked you for a Knut!"
Draco sighed, "I only left once a day to shower and get new clothes. Molly's been feeding me and I've been sleeping on Arthur's old stretcher."
"Get him sitting up, Draco," the healer ordered, "Here, drink some water, Harry."
died on the 2nd March 2000."
"So, what now?" Ron ambled over to the group of Andromeda, Harry and Draco.
"Where's Ron?" Harry eventually asked, his throat dry.
"I know, I'm sorry, Draco..." Harry wasn't able to get more words out before Draco shoved him away and stormed off towards the children playing Quidditch.
"Which my friends, Weasley, are able to use at their leisure," Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Living room," Harry hurried ahead of them and placed the box on the coffee table. Draco and Luna hoisted the Pensieve onto the table beside it, Hermione casting a Strengthening Charm on the table as it groaned under the weight.
Susan gives Harry a cheesy look, "I still cannot believe you two are together, you're both so handsome. What a waste."
"We grieved you and moved on. We had to, the person you turned into..." Ron's face twisted again.
"You should not feel guilty, this was not your fault. You could not save him from this," Healer Gurjeet reminded him kindly.
Where the fuck am I? There's a witch in ugly green robes... St. Mungo's? Why am I here? Hermione's in the bed next to me at least. I don't know how Ron's sleeping like that, surely his back hurts? I get it though, he'd not leave Hermione's side for anything right now. I want someone to stick by me like that.
"No, it was about the Fiendfyre," Harry confessed, "I just wanted to be sure you were still okay."
"Yeah?" Harry half turned to face her.
He batted away her hand, "I'm fine, I'll not stress my body at all. I'm just going to rest here."
Harry's scream startled the group, Draco grabbing onto the man as he clawed at the air.
Hermione noticed Harry leading Malfoy towards the family and gently nudged Ron. She knew this was going to be a difficult conversation. "Harry, mate, we're going to head home soon," Ron greeted the pair with a strained smile. Molly and Arthur looked up and realised that Harry wasn't alone. "Er, everyone's met I suppose, but um, this is my godson, Teddy Lupin." Harry chewed his lip and watched the family stare at the bundle in Draco's arms. Draco shifted the baby so they could see him more easily, Molly reaching out and stroking the soft hair on Teddy's head.
Draco crosses his arms again, "We pulled the gem that cursed you out of storage, Unspeakables have been testing it since you... became you again. They've cracked what the curse was. Nasty little thing called
Ron sat up and cracked his neck from side to side, "'Mione, did we fall asleep? Oh, sorry love. Let me get you home."
Dinner was an uncomfortable affair for Harry. Draco was back to his polite and charming self (Audrey having fixed Draco's bruised and bloodied mouth while they watched the Quidditch game) to everyone except Harry. Harry was picking at a Yorkshire pudding when a pile of greens appeared on his plate. Harry looked up to catch Draco holding the spoon that applied the greens, his conversation with Percy on applications of lilac in Replenishing Potion uninterrupted by the action. Harry didn't allow himself a smile but ate the greens with gusto.
Andromeda looked away again, "I don't know. I just don't know."
Lucius was covered in grime, the blood matting his clothes and hair barely of consequence as Draco silently observed him. Years blindly following this man's lead, trusting Father to know best. Now he was dead, laying on a dirty floor like a spider someone had swatted away carelessly. Draco felt a bubble of hysterical laughter form in his chest and squashed it down. While the Dark Lo- Voldemort was being dealt with by Potter, a furious Death Eater had cast a curse towards Narcissa, deducing she had lied to their Lord about Potter being dead.
"Charge to 220!"
Draco settled against his mother, "He'd better wake up. I'm not going to bloody America on my own."
Harry hung his head in shame, "I know. Or - I don't know but I'm starting to get the idea."
"Sorry, sorry, shhh. I'm sorry," Harry took Winky's wrinkled hand, "Sorry, I'm just tired and I couldn't remember what mallow-sweet is."
Draco rasped in what he was sure would be his final breath, amused that he'd gone and done exactly what a bloody Gryffindor would have done by sacrificing himself.
Harry belatedly noticed that they had reached the family, trying to focus his senses he saw that Ginny was clutching Neville's arm. Neville's lips were in her hair and he seemed to be whispering words as she stared down at Fred's body. Neville looked up at Harry, fixing him with a look that was determined but also - in Harry's mind - apologetic. Harry nodded absently at Neville and half shrugged to himself. He hadn't considered that Ginny would have moved on in the year apart. Harry knew though, that he had changed fundamentally and he couldn't love her as his past, more innocent, self had done.
"Very understandable, like I said," Luna replied, "It would be more surprising if you weren't."
Draco gasped and his arms wrapped tight around Harry, pushing him back against the closed door. Harry thought he was going to combust he was so aroused, until it kicked up a notch when Draco's erect cock pressed along the length of his own. Their kisses turned into shared breath and brushing tongues while they furiously rutted together, it all coming to a climax sooner than Harry would have liked.
Hermione placed her head on Harry's shoulder, "Do you think you'll ever rejoin us in the land of the living, Harry? Your goddaughter needs you to be up and about before she arrives."
"So, I..." Harry felt the twist of hope in his chest.
"The black ones!" Harry demands.
"Merlin knows why, it's not like I thought you would ever want it again," Draco drawled.
"A week?" Harry glances at Ron, "I mean, I deserved that, sure."
Harry fought the urge to cry again, "Thank you for coming to see me."
"You were never charged with a crime," Luna said simply.
"What did he - I do?" Harry asked, dreading the answer.
"He trying to talk you into another baby?" Ginny glares at Harry jokingly.
"And even those can have horrible physical consequences," Justin added, looking sickened.
Draco pulled his scarf tighter and huddled into his cloak. It was still bloody cold but the entire group had come to support Ginny at her trial for the Holyhead Harpies. December's frost had seemed like a summer's day compared to what January had brought with it. Draco was glad it was the middle of February, though spring seemed to be dragging its feet. Hermione shuffled closer to Draco. He was glad he'd sat next to her, she'd conjured some blue flames in a jar and it was warming him slowly.
“So do I, and I still like you. That counts for something, doesn’t it?”
“We’ll be happy to see him. Do tell him not to be too nervous. That poor boy’s been through a lot, hasn’t he?”
“Hi, Luna,” Harry says. “Yes, I brought Draco.”
bring this up at our
Harry nods obediently, finding a spare place near Percy and Oliver on the couch and ushering Draco to sit next to him. Ron sits between Harry and Percy.
“I love you, too,” Draco says. He rolls his sleeve back down. “Are you sure Christmas will go well?”
“Yeah, Perce,” Fred says. “Shut
“Thank you,” Draco mutters to Harry.
“Yes,” Harry says, quietly. “We all have.”
Draco leans in to kiss Harry back, smiling against his lips. “Isn’t it a tradition?”
“They’re- well, they’re tiny creatures that live in mistletoe,” Harry says, feeling a touch stupid. But at the same time, it’s something Luna believes fully in, and he loves her and her friendship dearly.
“I wasn’t expecting anyone for Christmas,” Narcissa says.
“Ron owes me seven Sickles.”
“They don’t,” Harry says. He squeezes Draco’s hand tightly.
“Yes, it is.” Molly stands at Harry’s side.
“I talked about him nearly as much,” Harry says, light and joking. “‘Draco’s eating a different thing for breakfast today’. Or, ‘Draco must’ve gotten a haircut over Christmas’. Or, ‘there must be something wrong with him, because he hasn’t insulted me today’.”
“Don’t let me keep you,” Molly says, carefully and lovingly shooing them away. “Go ahead and have a good time.”
Harry stands to get a closer look. The person in the picture is blond, so for a moment, he thinks it could be Fleur, but Bill and Fleur’s hands are both at Holiday. The closer he gets, the more Harry’s convinced that it’s Draco, but that’s… impossible, right?
“As if you and Lee don’t get up to the same things!” Percy shrinks into his jumper.
“I’m used to it. Are you?”
“You know it’ll be plastered all throughout
Luna smiles dreamily. “Hello, Harry.”
“Yes, Mrs. Weasley,” Lee says, politely.
“We won’t,” Harry says.
, as if he’s trying to remove the skin. He’s tried, before. It pushes up his sleeve to expose the mark. “Are you sure you want to do that?”
The door opens. Narcissa peers out, looking less like her usual well-kept self, haggard in appearance and exhausted. Her face fills with joy upon seeing her son’s face. “Draco! You should’ve told me you were coming. I would’ve…” She smiles at him brilliantly, reaching out for a hug. Draco hugs his mother for the first time in more than a year, shuddering as though holding in sobs.
“They’ll love you,” Harry says. “They’ll love you because I do.”
Harry takes him out the door they came in. Draco breathes in the chilled air and opens his butterbeer, exhaling a cloud of hot air.
“Sorry,” they mutter.
“And be
Harry shakes his head, a lump forming in his throat. “How long have you-?”
Harry smirks at him. “The sooner you admit you actually enjoy it, the better. I’ve seen you steal them every year.”
Ron leans forwards. “He’s been on our cases about the bets,” he stage-whispers.
“Since you graduated Hogwarts.”
“Percy sounds like he gets up to a lot,” Draco says. “For a Prefect.”
“How d’you do it? Hm? Lee and I, we like-”
Harry looks to Draco.
Draco takes Harry’s hand in his chilled one, allowing Harry to lead him from the living room. Harry’s jumpers aren’t the only thing that keeps him warm, and- in Draco’s most humble opinion- Harry does a much better job, anyway.
“Oh, Draco! How nice to see you here.” Hermione smiles at Draco. “You remember Viktor, right?”
“Yes, Molly,” Draco says.
“Yes,” Percy says. “This’s my boyfriend, Oliver.”
Draco’s never cared for Harry’s dress sense, which is why he steals Harry’s clothes. It’s only for the best, you see. If Harry doesn’t have his ugly, horrible shirts, then he has to wear some of Draco’s (much more fashionable) clothes instead. There are no ulterior motives.
“Oh, poor dear,” Molly says, getting that maternal, worried look. “Is it a lot?”
“Are those our Christmas plans?”
“Only when the twins bother her,” Percy says. He lays his hand on top of Oliver’s with only a little hesitancy.
“Let’s see, shall we? I’m a Malfoy, a former Death Eater, a Slytherin, an arsehole- the list doesn’t end there, Potter.” Draco presses himself closer to Harry’s side, slouching down so he doesn’t have to look at him. “They have every reason to hate me.”
“Young love is always interesting before you realize it’s love,” Narcissa says, fondly and with minimal bitterness. She moves aside to allow Draco and Harry into her room.
solve your weird sexual tension,” George adds.
about us.”
Draco, still staring at his Dark Mark, sighs. “I don’t care for it, anymore.”
“I see.”
“Hello, Narcissa.”
“Don’t worry about him,” George says.
Fred.” She points at George. “
“They won’t.”
“If you weren’t sure, there
Everyone shifts uncomfortably. Draco exhales from his nose.
!” Molly turns around again to glare at Fred and George, positively venomous.
sad if I’d left her all alone, mum. She loves me.”
“That’s good.” Harry leads Draco around the lawn. There’s something beautiful about the dreary, half-melted British Christmas when it’s at the Burrow. Harry admires Draco in the weak sunlight. He’s beautiful, really. Harry’s been aware that Draco is handsome for years, but he’s still stunned by his boyfriend’s beauty.
this year.” She points at the twins. “Lee, I trust you to keep them in line.”
“I’ve never had a holiday like this,” Draco says.
“Someone needs to tell Ginny!” George says. “How much’d she bet, again?”
Draco scoffs and drinks his butterbeer. “You wish you could find someone like me on the street,” he snarks back, equally as dry.
“Funny. I don’t think you were thinking about being decent when you and Oliver were-”
“It’s comfortable.” Draco crosses his arms.
“Oh, is it, now?” Harry stretches out on the sofa.
The room was adorned in black and white party decorations, and the space was huge. There were probably a total of a hundred or more people, and Draco felt claustrophobic just looking at everyone.
Before he could even register what was happening, Harry’s fingers were under his chin, pulling Draco’s head towards his. It wasn’t a fast motion, nor was it incredibly slow, but Draco was lost in time while their lips grew closer and closer together; time was non existent, really.
said Gryffindor bed. On top of the covers of course, but really, really close to Harry Potter,
“So, yesterday when you were standing in front of the open window, you
Draco promptly fled from the scene, moving past the dozens of students who had stopped to watch his and Potter’s altercation. As he moved through the halls, he subconsciously kept tugging at the sleeve that covered his left arm, pulling his robe sleeve down way farther than it needed to be. He kept feeling for his cufflinks that were clasped to his dress shirt that he wore under his robes, making sure they were secure. He knew he was being paranoid, but he just couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that a person- Harry Potter for that matter- actually touched his left arm. He felt like he was going to be sick.
He walked in even deeper, regretting every step he took, because he knew he should be searching for Harry, but he also knew he heard a noise in Slughorn’s room and it couldn’t be left unchecked, even though his mind enjoyed screaming, “HARRY, HARRY, HARRY…” every half of a second to remind him where his sole focus should remain.
"Saved by the clumsy two year old," Harry winks at Draco and hands him the baby.
"Hermione wasn't as nice as you are when she joined me," Harry admitted. "Plus I had Lily and Minty in my bed with me and they both kick."
"I - I cheated?" Harry sniffled pathetically.
"Yes," Harry is broken.
had the same idea and cast a Stunning Spell at Mr. Nott at once. The combination of the spells has put the young man into a serious magical coma, he's here in St. Mungo's under Auror guard until he wakes up." Draco nodded, Kingsley muttered something at this point that sounded rather like, "Not that Aurors are good enough for
, something that settled in his stomach like dread.
Harry squeezed back and concentrated, Hermione had been helping him work on a surprise for Draco.
"I did enjoy a rather long bath but I missed putting Araminta to bed and without your midnight trudge into the kitchen for tea the house felt a bit too quiet." Draco's words settled into Harry's stomach like warm treacle tart, sparking hope in him once more.
Luna hands him the first one but places a hand on his wrist, "The black ones are the worst. You won't come back from knowing about these and rest easily."
"How's Gin?" Harry waited, his whole body tensed. Draco made an aggrieved noise and Harry felt the tears prickle and run down his cheek.
"I need to leave, get him to St. Mungo's for a check up," Draco's voice is in the hall and Harry hears the front door slam.
Tony threw the mug of tea at Harry's head and stormed out. Harry fixed the wards so he could never come back, headed upstairs and cast an Incendio on the entire bed. He stomped into Sirius' room down the hall and crumpled into the bed, sobbing for the life he had lost.
"I'm going to sit in Potter's room until he wakes up," Draco pulled on his robe and stood.
Draco's mouth twitched in amusement, he took Harry's hand firmly, "Draco Malfoy, nice to meet you."
Draco took it gratefully and thanked the Elf. He shifted his cousin from Harry's shoulder to the crook of his arm, ignoring Harry's shock at Draco touching him so casually and prodded the screaming infant's lips with the nipple of the bottle, "C'mon, you need to eat if you're going to scream Hogwarts down all day." The cries quieted and Draco looked into eyes that rapidly changed from brown to grey before hearing the quiet suckling noise coming from the baby's throat as he drank. The baby's hair was flickering between brown and green, Draco suspected the baby was a Metamorphmagus, a trait from his Black heritage.
"Time to get home, late night, big day tomorrow!" Ron boomed out, gathering their children and pushing them through the Floo to 'Liber Glen'. "Harry, you're staying with us tonight, yeah?"
Harry's hope crumbles, "What do you mean?"
"Yeah, I have to get up and do the paperwork now," Harry refused to move.
"You cannot blame yourself, you couldn't know that the barb would go through your back and puncture him instead," Draco's mother wrapped him in her arms.
" The force of Harry's spell crushed Draco into the wall behind him, he slumped and dropped his wand.
" ripped her and Draco's wands from their pockets. Hermione whipped her head around, suspecting it was a joke by Harry. She was stopped when she realised the man who had thrown her wand aside wasn't anyone familiar. Draco must have recognised him because he swore and breathed out, "Nott?" Hermione looked closer, recognising the young man who had never spoken a word to her in six years.
"'Mione," Harry whispers.
Ron and Pansy were already sitting with an extremely bloody Hermione. Harry snapped to attention when Aurors appeared behind him, transporting the unconscious body of Theodore Nott. Harry didn't know why Nott had gone after Draco, but he didn't care. He started towards the boy again before he was pulled back sharply. "What the fu-" Harry was drawn up short when he found himself looking into the teary eyes of Narcissa Malfoy. He was about to ask how she had known so quickly that Draco was injured when he saw who had an arm around her shoulder, Kingsley nodded at one of the Aurors and turned back to Harry.
A Muggleborn sent Malfoy a bomb. A fucking bomb, to a fucking school. It's common knowledge he's at Hogwarts - didn't they think about the others who would be injured? I'm so relieved that Marcie is okay. She told me I was her hero. At least I deserve the title this time. I don't think I'll be able to save these robes though, they're covered in her blood.
"Charge to 210," the healer urged.
Harry made a whimpering sound and shoved his face into Draco's neck, breathing in the smell of his cologne, something spicy that had an undertone he could only describe as
"It's a boy, our first boy!" Ron yells.
"Thank you. And the rest of you lot, for supporting this." Harry swallowed heavily, trying to dispel the lump in his throat.
Draco leaned in and pressed a kiss to Harry's cheek, "You need to wake up, Harry. I don't want to be anyone else's partner. Don't be selfish, Potter."
She felt a push of Legilimency in her mind and almost pulled back, before realising it was Draco.
"Go on, leave! Fuck off!" Ginny screams once more.
Ron knocked half the chess pieces into Harry's lap, breaking his reverie. "Sorry mate, bit tired, y'know," Ron yawned and gathered up the pieces. Hermione had gone up to bed an hour ago, Harry was sure she was already in Ron's bed reading. Ron wandered into the dormitory towards his covered bed, followed by Harry and Draco. "Night Harry, Draco," Ron yawned while he closed his curtains behind him. Draco settled on Harry's bed and smirked at Harry, "Goodnight Ronald, and goodnight to you too, Hermione." Harry heard Ron's guffaw and then a thud and an "Ow! 'Mione!" Harry smiled, stripping his trousers and pulling on pyjama pants. He crawled into his bed while Draco adjusted the hangings, producing one of the prototype Safe & Sound orbs and suspending it from the ceiling with a flick of his wand.
"I don't want to cast offensive spells anymore," Neville's voice was shaky, "I don't ever want to hurt anyone again. Defence is really difficult."
"Where do I begin?" Harry gave her a hopeful look.
Harry looked up into Draco's eyes and smiled weakly, "Okay."
Harry had barely left Draco's side since Madam Pomfrey had released him. Draco had forgiven him using his Legilimency and Harry ached at how much he'd missed Draco communicating with him secretly. Hermione was still unhappy with him, but was helping him with homework again. Ron and Draco were currently playing chess in front of the Common Room fire, quietly discussing what Ron should get Hermione for Christmas. Draco pressed his ankle against Harry's knee, a reassuring pressure that he was okay. Harry was still drowning in guilt for his part in Draco's assault.
"Come on, you promised I was stuck with you," Draco managed to get out before the words failed him and the tears fell.
Once they'd finished their soup - and lavished more praise upon an extremely grateful Kreacher - they moved upstairs into the sitting room. His mother and Aunt Andromeda were quietly going through photo albums over tea. Draco and Harry slumped into a sumptuous leather couch, Draco was reading a Potions book, while Harry had Teddy cradled into his chest and was murmuring things about Teddy's parents. "They were so brilliant Teddy - your mum was the coolest Auror I've ever met - and your dad, he was... He was one of the closest things I had to a loving parent. They were so brave, they loved you so much but they had to help make a world for you to be safe in."
"The day you told me that I shouldn't presume to know anything about you or what you want in response to a cup of tea and disappeared for two days." Draco's cautious expression hurt Harry deeply.
George was sitting quietly beside him, while Pansy and Luna filled Draco in on the gossip. "-and then Blaise kissed Justin, right in the middle of Charms! Flitwick looked like he wasn't sure whether to take points for lewdness or give them for such a wonderful display of Inter-House Unity," Pansy was delighted by Blaise's grand gesture, Draco knew she always was a bit of a romantic. George frowned at her, "Hang on, Harry said you and Blaise were dating, Blaise had his arm around you after the Battle or something?" Pansy snorted, "Weasley, Blaise is about as straight as Draco. He's my bestfriend and a bit affectionate, that's all." George looked at Pansy with new interest, Draco knew he had found her snarky intellect entertaining and that she was easy on the eyes.
and stretched out to sleep.
Hermione felt her heart clench. It was all over, Harry had fulfilled his role, which meant they could finally feel everything they had put aside during the War. And suddenly, all Hermione felt was anger at Dumbledore's manipulations and planning. She pushed the anger aside, they'd come out victorious and mostly in tact. Harry smiled over Ginny's head, "You better go Gin, but I'll see you soon okay?" Ginny smiled back and walked past Hermione, over to where Harry had been looking at Neville and his grandmother. Harry turned to Ron and Hermione, pulling them into a hug so tight Hermione felt her throat catch.
"Here's hoping Draco is correct in his... colourful declaration," Narcissa commented from her seat in the corner.
"Well, I'm going to build a new house," Draco pointed over at a large expanse of ground, "Near the Quidditch pitch there."
Harry just smiled and scooped a pile of eggs in his mouth, already used to their silent communication, he revelled that no one else seemed to know about Draco's talent. Molly served him a cup of tea, and Andromeda began talking again of the funeral arrangements. Harry stopped eating and it dawned on him the conversation he must have interrupted. Andy fixed him with a stern look and nudged his arm discretely to force him to continue eating. Harry dutifully finished his food, not wanting to disappoint
Harry felt his concern for Draco being Marked bloom into something suspiciously like horror. Draco's arm was indeed marked - but not how they had all expected. Scars ran over his arm, clearly making words which overlapped and crossed each other, some livid and red, some a dull lilac that had been there for longer. Harry caught a few of the words,
Harry's fear subsided a little, "I'll see you around, Draco."
₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
Ron tried the door to the classroom, finding it locked. Neville blasted down the door of the classroom in a flash of light, immediately knocking out two of the students who stood too close. Hermione entered immediately, beginning to duel with a Seventh Year that Harry thought might be on the Quidditch Team. Harry took down another Sixth Year, turning to where Draco had crawled to his wand, still blindfolded and bleeding from his mouth. Hands shaking, Draco slowly turned around, facing Harry with his wand raised. Harry Stunned another Seventh Year girl and caught Draco's mouth moving, wand still pointed at Harry. Light formed at the end of Draco's wand and Harry reacted without thinking, "
Ron thundered past with one Keepers Glove and a frantic expression. Hermione squashed another wave of irritation, they still had a half hour before they had to leave, but she was anxious. This was Harry and Draco's first time in public together since the War ended. There was going to be press all over the platform and Hermione wanted to be prepared for any fanatics who wanted to hurt either of her boys. The Floo flared green, the long lines of Draco Malfoy stepping through, followed by Harry's clumsy stumble. Draco's arm shot out automatically to steady Harry, Harry grunted his thanks and strode away from Draco.
"Mum and Dad know too." Ron had stepped beside him, his arm snaking around Harry's shoulders. "They approve." Harry felt the drops slip down his cheeks and he leaned into Ron's embrace.
"Which bastard? Wait - she said bastard?" Harry was shocked and forgot to let Draco's hand go.
Hermione was browsing quills at Scrivenshaft's, comparing nibs with Draco to find the best option for their exams. Harry and Ron had rolled their eyes at her and Draco when they announced their plans to buy stationery for their N.E.W.T.s. They had begged off to Honeydukes and promised to come back with Tooth-flossing Stringmints for Hermione and caramel fudge for Draco. She and Draco had found three exceptional candidates for their exam quills, and were going to use them for the next month to determine the best choice. Hermione also bought a handwriting improvement quill for Harry. She was fond of but pragmatic about his atrocious scrawl, Harry could use some help with his penmanship.
Harry was sulking, trying not to look at Draco, seated with George and Ron, arguing about their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. He rocked Teddy's new cradle with his foot, angrily regarding Hermione reading by the fire. She and Draco had come back from Australia thick as thieves, Ron loved Draco, and George and Ginny had accepted him into their mischief making trio as if he had orange hair and freckles. Harry wished Ginny was here, she would be cooing over Teddy and talking to Harry about the different outfits they could be dressing him in now the weather was cooling. Ginny and Neville were spending the last week before returning to Hogwarts visiting Augusta Longbottom, who had retired to Italy at the start of July.
Harry had just watched the man he loved take a curse for his best friend. The monster in his chest roared for revenge, Harry drew his wand and threw a violent
Harry was on Draco's left side, an arm slung around Draco's shoulders and Luna leaning into his other side. Draco smiled as the breeze ruffled Harry's messy hair. Harry finally seemed comfortable with Draco's sexuality, they'd been closer than ever since Christmas. Draco thumbed the band of the ring on his right hand through his glove, Harry had gifted Draco with a new signet ring, replacing the one he'd destroyed to hand the Manor over to the Ministry. A handsome platinum ring with an engraved dragon decorating the face, it was Draco's most prized possession now.
Draco turned to Harry and smiled, Harry felt his breath hitch, Draco had never looked at him so openly before. "Thank you Harry, I can't tell you how much I am in debt to you for your actions today." Harry still couldn't find his voice after that smile, so Malfoy continued, "I can't apologise for everything without taking up a week of your time, but, for what it is worth, I am sorry and I hope to repay your forgiveness." Harry grinned and gestured towards the two Black women, "Er, lets head off?" Draco nodded, still smiling gently and rocking Teddy in his arms as he followed Harry back to his family.
Draco pulled her into a tight embrace, mindful of her distended stomach, "I will owl you if he so much as twitches, Granger. I promise. I'm sorry I couldn't protect him. I'm so sorry."
Draco had inhaled sharply at the mention of fire, but he hesitantly reached out to take Harry's hand. The warmth settled the fear in Harry's chest somewhat, but he was still unsettled.
I hate this bed. We've only been at Hogwarts a month and I can't remember why I agreed to come back. I'm in a room with Malfoy, Seamus and Justin. It's not the same. Well, I guess Dean is in here too, judging by the whispers and giggles from Seamus' bed before he cast the Silencing Charm. I miss Ron and Hermione sleeping with me. I know they love me, but they love each other too... It's all different.
"Harry, we need to talk about this." Narcissa's tone immediately worried Harry.
"I'm good, Gramma. I just want to hug Uncle Harry. I missed him," Teddy buried his black hair into Harry's shoulder.
Harry surfaced from his nightmare about Sirius's death, gasping like a fish out of water. His bed was soaked in sweat and his body was shivering from the cold.
"I haven't been able to go back to the Manor since the Ministry gave it back to us," Draco chimed in, "I spoke my first words, learnt to walk, to ride a broom there. But it's not my home anymore, it feels like a prison to me."
"Kreacher, I wonder if you would mind making us something to eat, simple but comforting? Perhaps your chicken soup, it was always my favourite as a girl." Draco turned and realised his mother and Andromeda must have been standing behind them during their exchange, he had forgotten they were there. They were staring around the room with barely disguised wonder on their faces. Andromeda gestured up the stairs, "Let us find some rooms, shall we?"
Harry nodded and stumbled back through the Floo.
"You always make dinner and never let Father clean up. You always bring home flowers for Father when he's had a success at work. Oh, you look at him like you want to eat him!" Scorpius listed gleefully.
"Do you ever feel like you... don't deserve to be happy again?" Harry whispered.
"We don't care, so long as it's healthy," Harry stands to fill the kettle and presses a kiss to Draco's temple.
Kingsley remembered himself after a moment and coughed lightly, "Alright, you are free to go." He gestured for the Auror to hand Malfoy back his wand - Harry was finding it painful to think of him as Draco after seeing his arm - but Malfoy handed it off to his mother. Harry remembered that he still had
. He thought the words gleefully, trying not to feel guilty about the despair he should be feeling while funerals were being discussed.
Harry smiled at Draco, the moment interrupted by the loud clearing of Celia's throat. Harry cheerfully wished her a 'Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year' and stepped through the Floo to Hermione's library.
"We'd better get downstairs soon, or they'll all know what we were up to." Draco cast a wandless cleaning spell over the both of them and tucked his shirt back in.
"I have questions, mainly when did you all know about... my feelings for Draco?" Harry looked particularly askance at his children and Draco's.
"Minister Shacklebolt kept it out of the papers," Draco's voice was bitter, "Didn't want the public to know there were more wolves like Greyback who could turn without the moon."
"I'll never be able to make anything right, with any of you," Harry stared at the carpet, "Will I?"
"Thanks," Harry felt a small weight leave him.
Draco raised an eyebrow imperiously, "What?"
Harry's wails startle the witch into action, she hikes him up in a rather firm grip on his elbow and drags him off into a consultation room, "Wait here."
Harry leaned forward and threw his breakfast up into her waste paper basket.
"Okay, I wanna play with Jamie and Teddy." Minty scrabbled down to the floor and ran off to demand attention from the young men.
"Yeah, Luna thinks it will help with my treatment," Harry agreed.
, wedged between a pouting Lily and a cheery Ron on a two person couch in the Burrow, watching Draco and his girlfriend, Celia interact with the Weasley family. Ron had guilted him into coming, because 'you can't miss family events because of her forever, mate'. It wasn't that Harry was avoiding Celia, so much as just refusing to deal with the fact that Draco was in a relationship at all.
“Please, just let it go. I’m-” In distress. Absolutely torn to pieces having to constantly lie to you. Carrying the weight of a lot of lives on my shoulders at the moment. Having to keep that burden to myself. Worrying that the potion we’re brewing right now is for nothing- “Okay.”
“Come on, Potter. Stand up,” Draco admonished as he pushed in his own chair and settled a book on defensive spells under his arm.
Much love <3 <3
“Hurry, follow me.” Potter started running towards the back of Hogsmeade, to the part where the village met the land where no Hogwarts student was allowed to go. Potter had pulled out his wand, and the tip was casting a bright light, illuminating Potter’s outline as he ran farther and farther away from where Draco was still standing.
Draco was ready to protest that no, he wasn’t crying, but to his horror, for the third time that night, he felt tears falling freely down his cheeks. Harry was already there, brushing away the teardrops and slowly but surely holding him closer.
The first thing Draco noticed when he woke up was that there was a hand- most certainly not
one man could create just from practicing spells.
Turning back and walking towards Drys, Draco said: “You said you’d tell me everything about your little plan.”
“It's from my mother, I’m guessing, from the crest on the front. My father obviously wouldn’t be writing to me from Azkaban.”
“You know you love me.”
He knew what he was about to do was entirely impulsive, a trait that most (all) Gryffindors had in them, and he didn’t care. Yes, he wanted to be brave,
“Will he be alright?”
“Are you sure that’s all there is?”
“Excellent question, Miss Granger. At the end of class, we will add a hint of Bundimun Secretion to your potions, and if your mixture turns a dark purple, you will know you have made it right. Now, any more questions?” No one moved or said anything. They all look too frightened. “Alright then, pair up. No more than groups of two. Once you have your partner, come and collect your ingredients and dragonhide gloves.”
Harry was now practicing a handful of new spells, now that he’d mastered
Draco felt his heart crack. The sight of Potter crying, the sight of the Wizarding World’s savior breaking down in tears, was gut-wrenching. He wanted to do
He was upset thinking about how one of the main reasons they were now closer than ever was because Lucius had died. Narcissa also spent a lot of time thinking Draco might die, too. The suffering his mother went through was terrible, and he wished he could do something to fix it. Take away her pain for good.
“Maybe I should try casting a different spell. Maybe this one is really old and outdated, so it just doesn’t work anymore. The one where you trap your opponent in a bubble sounded pretty cool.” Potter twirled his wand with his hand, keeping his gaze focused intently on the movement.
“Can we try to open it in the morning? I would like to go to bed now,” Draco said.
Draco shook his head and bit down hard on his bottom lip.
Draco swallowed, and now he was the one licking his lips in nervousness. “I don’t really dance.”
It had to be a dream. No way, in no reality, would Harry be willing to bring his face so incredibly close to Draco's, not after Draco turned into a murderer.
Draco avoided looking in Theo’s direction and sat down next to Pansy on her left side, which was the farthest he could get from Theo.
mean anything. He executed way too many horrible deeds in his past, and Harry was probably going to laugh at him for his lame attempt at asking for… whatever he was asking for.
“Partly.” He lifted his wand higher, pointing it directly between Draco’s eyes.
“That's… interesting,” Harry stated.
“I didn't mean to do that. I swear. I just pointed my wand at the corner and I guess excess magic shot out of it, doing
Draco huffed in annoyance. “Why don’t you just consult
“I felt the same exact way, the first day the curse started,” Draco said, “And I’m also glad I got to know you better too. And let me tell you, Harry, you’re not alone. You’ll never be alone. Whatever happens tomorrow, I’ll be by your side. As well as all the days after that.”
Drys’s mouth tightened. “Yes.
watch this.” He promptly cast
Harry stayed still, his breathing only just heard over the crackling of the fire, and Draco didn’t mind. He didn’t mind if Harry didn’t speak for hours. Draco would wait, just like Harry did for him.
Draco hated when Harry gave him that look. He tried to ignore the pulling in his heart whenever Harry gave him that incredibly disbelieving and I-know-you’re-hiding-something look, but it became increasingly hard to ignore the more he saw it.
“Draco!” Harry screamed. Draco rolled his eyes and gripped the sink harder. “I will break down this door!”
He added in a drop of Bundimun Secretion to his and Potter’s yellowish looking and foul smelling potion, and much to Draco’s relief, it turned purple. He and Potter had made it correctly.
“Who cares? Let’s get out of here before someone finds us. I think we did some good damage.” That was definitely Theo’s voice.
8) Literally every single person on the planet. (Except his mother, of course).
book, but he did find Severus Snape’s.”
Draco felt a hint of jealousy at the mention of Alec Kaspian. Okay, maybe more than a hint, probably a huge serving size of pure jealousy with a dash of annoyance on the side. “Can you play that song again?”
“Looks like we’re here.” Potter said as they neared Hogsmeade. Draco was extremely grateful that they had arrived. He desperately needed to sit down. His chest was absolutely killing him, and he wouldn’t have been surprised if he had looked down to see that his cuts had opened back up again and were leaking blood through his jumper and coat. He supposed he could have taken a rest in the snow if his injuries had gotten really bad, but he didn’t want to freeze his arse off, so he had kept walking alongside Potter, making no complaints.
“Honestly, yes.”
He was seeing stars, and not the ones that were stuck up in the night sky. The back of his eyelids were surrounded in stars, stars created by Harry’s touch.
At some point Draco had stood up; probably mirroring what Harry was doing, but now he found himself sitting back down on the picnic blanket, drumming his fingers on the ground.
“And Harry, I wanted to let you know I'm sorry. For abandoning you. For making you wait for this talk. For just anything imaginable that I have to be sorry for.” He closed his eyes briefly, taking in his own words. “I hope that after all this time, after all that’s happened, we can still be friends.”
after his and Potter’s little fight. Draco was tremendously happy that Potter had not followed him, and extremely upset that Potter did eventually find where he was hiding, even if it did take him a few hours.
Ever since the offer, Draco wanted to enforce the prospect of learning new defense spells now more than ever. The figure made it clear he wanted Draco to comply with him and only him, and since Draco obviously wasn’t going to take the figure up on his offer, the next best thing for them was to be prepared and ready.
” That spell did nothing.
“Oh, you know, the usual. Talking to the shelves. We were having a tea party, you see, with the brooms, right before you interrupted.”
A Pensieve from the Headmistresses office was brought in, and they immediately began the process of taking the strands of memories from his brain into the mesmerizing water.
Draco looked down at his outfit. He was wearing his usual dress shirt and Slytherin robes. He had thought he’d looked decent in the mirror that morning, but Potter’s comment was starting to make him self-conscious. It was the first outfit that had come to mind and the Room of Requirement had given it to him.
He was about to jump out of bed and wake Potter up when his eyes moved to where Potter should have been laying.
He jumped up from the ground, and ran directly in front of Harry, just as the killing curse rolled off of Drys’s tongue.
“Thanks,” Potter took a deep breath, “Here we go. I’m not exactly sure if this counts as a secret, but we’ll see.” Draco waited in anticipation as Potter took a couple more breaths. “I’m not okay.” Draco wanted to laugh at how
Draco pulled Harry closer towards his chest, his arms still squeezing tightly around Harry’s body.
“And you know what sucks about that?” he continued. “I can’t even stand to be around him for more than a minute. Not because of him. Because of me. Because my mind has convinced me I don’t deserve to be around him. That I’m making his life worse; him associating with me. But the funny thing is, I’ve worked it out for myself that he doesn’t care about all that shit. That he loves me back. But I haven’t been brave enough to even talk to him. I keep running away, and I’m just waiting for the day that I don’t.”
With one last look at the Room of Requirement, he set out into the corridors, attentively searching for anything out of the ordinary.
But, as he stared harder at the surrounding area, he realized that they
“Uh.” Harry was now standing over Draco. “Okay.”
Draco continued, “I reckon he wanted me to feel like the hero. Like risking your health was something that had to be done to save hundreds of others. But in reality, I didn’t want to hurt you anymore than I already had. Which sounds stupid… but it’s true. And, like you said, I thought if I refused there would be some other way I could prevail. There’s one thing I learned from you hero-type people, and that is there’s always another way.”
Draco smirked. “I’m surprised you even had the decency to wake me. I would have thought you’d have just left me to wake up in the morning covered in blood and bruises or something.”
He decided he needed to do
For a split second, he thought,
, Draco chewing furiously at his lip. The room was transformed into a spacious bedroom with two beds pushed up against a wall. It was decorated in different shades of green and red, to match his and Potter’s houses. There was a couch in the center of the room with many blankets and pillows folded neatly on it, along with a tray that held a variety of different snacks and drinks. A huge fireplace with a roaring fire was near the couch, and there was a door that presumably led to a bathroom in the far corner. The Room of Requirement had really hit every mark on the list of what they so desperately needed at the moment.
He traced the deep lines of it, and made sure Draco was doing okay every second. Draco thought he was trapped in a dream.
“Agree to disagree.”
“Come in,” came McGonagall’s voice.
Potter glared at Draco. “Not helping. But, how long could this thing last? Like we don’t know that if we just wait it out, it will be okay, and everything will go back to normal. Because what if we do wait it out and that's the wrong move, and it ends up with people seriously injured or dying? Ugh, I just don’t know what to do.”
Draco wanted to scream back at Harry, but all his energy was focused on not having a massive anxiety attack, and not raking the razor across his forearm. Both things that were incredibly hard not to do when someone was banging on a door and yelling at you, aggravating you even more.
He was describing the exact same situation Draco had encountered with Madame Pomfrey. Draco felt sick. So something really
to be kissed. So that was what Draco did.
Potter started to grin very wide, and Draco thought for a brief moment,
“Sorry, it’s just-” Draco winced as he moved his shoulder a tiny bit to the side. “Everything hurts.”
It made him sick to his stomach every time someone said it. He hated being reminded of what he was.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed, his attitude perking up.
“You just seem… upset. About something. I’m not mad at you for sleeping next to me, really.”
After the throbbing lessened greatly, he muttered the password, and stepped into the Slytherin common room. He immediately stood still, gaping at the sight of about ten students of all different ages, just sleeping.
lose this battle.
“Why do you care so much, Alec?”
Draco patted the flower, fixing it slightly so it wouldn’t fall out. He wished he had some reflective surface he could look in to see himself, but the way Harry was looking at him, told Draco everything he wanted to know.
to attend.
As if he was reading Draco’s mind, Harry cast a spell that detected presences of dark magic. Something he probably learned during his Auror training over the summer. The thought made Draco’s blood boil for a second; Harry becoming an Auror. He could do something so much better with his life.
Someone what? Someone who would be Draco’s friend? Someone who would be there for Draco to cry on? Someone who wanted to be in a relationship with Draco? He wished Harry would stop being so cryptic.
That was when he realized something was very odd. His arm seemed… cold? Like there was nothing covering his left arm. But that was ridiculous, since he made sure he always wore long sleeves.
Harry shook his head. “Just- just wait. I’m not talking about all that yet. I’m saying, in the library, that day when you wrote that letter to your dad, you could have told me. I could have written a letter to the Ministry while you wrote Lucius and everything would have turned out okay. We could have possibly had a solution, before the Figure told you to not send anymore letters.”
Harry settled in closer to Draco. It was almost like he was trying to tell a secret. “You were the first person I had met in the Wizarding World, besides Hagrid.”
“Right.”
So sorry for the long wait! But it is finally here! I hope you all enjoy, and my suggestion to everyone is to read carefully as to not be too confused; a lot of information is uncovered in this chapter and it really is A LOT!
“The one I had originally made had a dark red streak going across the cover. That one does not.”
“Please don’t leave me,” Draco said.
where the two of you might’ve gone off to.” Pansy wrinkled her nose in disgust.
The kitchen was spinning so fast. The lights were blaring. “I-”

“Harry
They stood outside a hotel called the Claridge, and Draco was about to ask what they were doing when Narcissa walked through the front entrance. Draco followed her, still confused, but he never doubted his mother. Well, he didn’t anymore.
that was supposed to bring him into Drys’ thrall. He didn’t want to talk about his Dark Mark, and how
It was also lucky that Potter didn’t catch on to the fact that the reason why Draco had asked if his scar had hurt at all, was because Draco’s scar
Theo sat closest to him on his right, though at a separate table, and was looking utterly bored. He could relate.
“But I was here
And with Harry looking at him like that… how could Draco not believe him?
“I wanted to tell you something,” Harry said, desire poorly hidden in his voice.
Draco’s heart nearly burst. “He used
“That is what I said, yes.”
“Ron! For goodness sake, can’t you see he’s in distress!” exclaimed another voice.
“But, earlier you called me a ‘prejudiced Death Eater,’ and Friday you didn’t give me any credit for our potions assignment.”
Now Draco was rummaging through his trunk trying to find his set of Slytherin outerwear. If Potter was going to go full on Gryffindor, Draco was sure as hell going to do the same with Slytherin. The house rivalries were stupid now, considering everything that happened with the war; it seemed so childish, but despite everything he still felt Slytherin was the best and had to prove it to ever so Gryffindor Potter.
Or maybe not by himself.
Draco shifted his eyes to look at who just spoke.
It was all too much.
way at all.
“Okay. Whatever,” Draco said. Only, he found himself quite complacent with Potter’s offer.
“You’re not telling me everything,” Draco said suddenly, earning everyone’s full attention. “There’s people in the woods.”
Pansy and Blaise sent him questioning glances before noticing for themselves what was going on.
Kaspian probably thought it was a hilarious joke, The Savior being paired up with the Death Eater.
A nagging thought filled the back of his head, though. Something he wished would just
to you, and you talked to him, and he made you some sick offer, it sounds exactly like something Voldemort would do. And I hate to break it to you, but Voldemort was very much real.”
Harry was standing in the middle of the room, with a blanket wrapped up by his feet, along with a brown basket. In his hand was some sort of black box, and Draco assumed it was a weird Muggle contraption.
After a long and tiring discussion of whether or not he and Potter should go to Snape’s portrait the very moment they found the book or the next day; they’d finally decided on making the trip to the Headmistresses’ office the next day, which was a Thursday.
Harry was frowning. “Don’t think about that. Just- what’s your dream job? Anything you’ve had your mind on?”
he had to wait inside the bathroom. But after a minute of arguing, Draco finally gave a dramatic sigh and went and sat on the edge of the sink. He didn’t want to waste any more time.

“Alright. I’m listening.”
That spell made the long cut across the forearm shorten, but the part that mattered most- the underside of the wrist- remained the same.
Just like it had done yesterday, words inscribed themselves in cursive across the page, revealing what looked like a counter-spell. Provided on the page was the wand movement used to cast the spell, how to pronounce the spell, its origins, and what exactly it was used for.
She brought both hands up and squeezed his shoulders endearingly. “Thank you, Draco. Apology accepted.”
Draco gave a half-hearted shrug. “Not exactly sure.”
Draco was so lost in the moment, he didn’t even feel Harry’s face lift off of his shoulder until he spoke to Draco in a whisper. “What happened to your hair?” Harry lifted trembling fingers to graze at pieces of hair that were falling into Draco’s eyes; something his hair never did. “Lemme fix it for you.” And so he did. He brushed back all the strands that were out of place, settling the pieces behind Draco’s ear.
Draco looked. In Harry’s hand, which he was sure wasn’t there a second ago, was a small photograph. Whatever spell Harry had cast, the product of it was a small picture, about the size of his hand. Draco inched closer to get a better look, and saw that the photograph wasn’t moving. The picture of the night sky and snowflakes it had entrapped was perfectly still.
“Prepare to be disappointed. No, I didn’t find it. Whatever ‘it’ is.” Harry closed his eyes, and leaned back against the stone that built up the water fountain.
Harry yawned again, which made Draco yawn. “Okay, well try to get some rest, Draco. Goodnight.”
“I’m here,” Draco finished the sentence for him.
“Whoa,” Draco said, fascinated. “How’d you get it to stay still? What spell was that?”
“Hey,” Harry said. He was loud enough so that Draco could hear him over everything else, but quiet enough so that no one else could easily hear. “Can I talk to you?”
He could barely look his mother in the eye at times.
“How about I go check on McGonagall, and then I’ll head towards the Great Hall. I'm sure there has to be someone else awake. Maybe they're looking for others too?” Potter said.
If his Professors still hated him, and wanted to give him Poor grades and converse with each other about his work and other things about him specifically, all because he had been stupid enough to work for the Dark Lord, then how was Draco supposed to save Harry, let alone the whole school? Every single person in the world was working against him, even his teachers; conspiring against him to make his life hell, even after the war was over.
He had to tell Potter what had just transpired. He was worried that if he didn’t speak of what the figure had told him, he would forget everything.
The Garden of Mystics suddenly felt freezing, the air going frigid with silence. Draco wished he hadn’t said anything at all.
Weasley’s face contorted into one of astonishment, which caught Harry and Granger’s attention immediately, causing the pair to turn around.
. I thought you said you would lay off on me a bit.” Draco raised an eyebrow.
What Draco had said to McGonagall had lit a flame inside of him, and he wasn’t ready to let it burn out before his mother left the castle. He knew he had to tell it to her now, or else he never would.
“So, you’re sure you want to test this out on Nott?” Harry asked warily.
Potter
“Wait, so what happened to me? Like, what were all my injuries?”
He walked in, and his mother was surprisingly there, standing next to McGonagall.
know how to save the Wizarding World. Only Potter had completed that task, and Potter had certainly not written that book, unless he wrote it under the alias of Maria Streinburg.
“How did you know?!”
Harry dropped his hand suddenly, like fire had seeped through Draco’s scar, burning his fingers. “No. Oh God- No. I’m- God, Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry said, and Draco could tell tears were starting to form in Harry’s eyes. Draco frowned.
He knew he was crossing a line. A huge line between friendship, and more than friendship. Across a line that was uncharted, that was full of infinite possibilities.
Previously, he had been skeptical to continue leaving his mental wards down every night when he went to bed. It took a lot of energy out of him to constantly keep up his Occlumency, but he thought he might as well not use it as he didn’t need to compartmentalize when the only other person around didn’t even know how to compartmentalize- he thought he’d level the playing field.
“Uh- so, truce?” Potter held out his hand for Draco to take.
Harry nodded slowly. “It is.”
Draco snorted. “Potter you are truly a travesty.”
“Hey, Potter,” Draco said.
Alec Kaspian was a confusing bloke. He was brainless and malevolent, yet charming and attractive. Though the brainless and malevolent part far out-weighted the other part. He was usually seen around Potter, they had evidently become close friends this year. But, Draco was skeptical that Potter actually liked Kaspian.
The world felt so cold. Colder than it had been the night before, when it had been snowing. When they had laid in the snow. Together.
When they both arrived at Hogwarts’ front entrance, Potter and him turned to each other. Potter stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets, and Draco crossed his arms.
“Why were you reading it then if it’s a children’s book?”
He’d thought he was a changed man. He’d thought he’d never let anyone take advantage of him ever again. He was so incredibly naive to believe all the lies he’d told himself.
“It’s on.” Only, the song that had been currently playing died down, and was replaced with an exceedingly slow song. That didn’t seem to have any words. And did he mention it was exceedingly slow?
“Once I cracked the enchantments on Snape’s book, which was around this January, I finally had the spells I needed to complete everything. I had the spell to keep you and Potter locked in, the sleeping curse, and the spell that would ensure my victory; the control of Death Eaters. It’s quite ironic, isn’t it? Having the Death Eaters back me up on the murder of the Purebloods.
Draco was not stupid. He knew someone was messing with him. But, he was curious nonetheless, and had time to spare before his next class. He guessed the letter meant for him to go as soon as possible, so after he finished his breakfast consisting only of tea, and had reassured Pansy that he would meet her in Transfigurations in a couple of minutes, he had set off to the seventh floor.
The kiss was so deep and so slow, Draco felt time had frozen. It was just him and Harry, kissing, hands interlocked, Draco’s tear-streaked cheeks hitting Harry’s glasses.
“We’ll get through it all, like we always do.”
Prophet
Theo continued, while Robin’s menacing figure stood slightly behind him. “I can’t even fathom which one of these stories is true. Except, you know, the ones where people are calling you a ‘hero’ and whatever fucked up shit goes along those lines. Those are so obviously not true, I laugh every time I hear someone say it!”
That night, in his room at the manor, he had begun to write a letter to McGonagall, asking if he could attend Hogwarts to redo his Seventh Year, if he got the okay from his probation Auror. She had messaged back the next day, saying that it was absolutely alright, and that she was glad to have him back.
“Harry…” Draco started, unsure how to start the conversation that had been nagging him during his stay in the Hospital Wing.
. I have to go to the bathroom
Draco was so lost in thought that he barely heard what Elizabeth was saying.
“Thank you, Harry.”
but he had to be brave, he knew.
Draco swallowed. “Yeah. Oh.”
In fact, she made a whole career out of party planning. She found she was quite good at it after all the events she planned during their eighth year at Hogwarts, and all the Ministry parties she had helped throw years after Hogwarts. Now she ran her very own business:
Draco felt sick. He wanted to tell Harry that he had done nothing wrong at all. That it was Draco’s own fault for distancing himself and avoiding Harry. He didn’t want Harry to feel guilty at all; he didn’t deserve that weight.
, was Potter that thick? Could he not tell he was causing Draco unbearable amounts of distress? He
“You mean did I find what I was looking for?”
Granger: Apologies
Draco glanced around the library, looking for any lingering students, and wasn’t surprised to find no one at all. Everyone was either outside, enjoying the setting summer sun, or eating a delicious dinner in the Great Hall. No one save for Draco would be working on school work the night before their last day of classes.
He couldn’t believe he had said all that, that he had just ranted to them about his love life, or lack thereof. But it was Blaise who spoke next.
With the Minister under Drys’ orders, the rest of the Ministry approved of the death of the rest of the Purebloods. No one ever knew who had been the ones to do the messy killing, but everyone knew to follow and listen to Drys and Draco. Everyone admired them and looked up to them. Everyone loved the new world where Halfbloods and Muggle-borns got to live freely, and not in fear anymore.
Sorry this chapter is like extremely boring and nothing really interesting happens until the very end.
you would have survived the killing curse, but the rest of my body kept screaming to me the opposite. Honestly, thinking at all was incredibly hard. My sole, almost incoherent, thought was to get to Hogwarts, so that's what I did.”
“Except Potter and I,” Draco agreed.
Their relationship before this year was not so much as friendship, but acquaintances. Eighth Year was when they had gotten close. Not a lot of people liked Pansy very much, and everyone absolutely despised Draco. They had every right to despise him too. He was the only Death Eater at Hogwarts. The only Death Eater who wasn’t dead, hiding from the Aurors, or in Azkaban. Draco hated to use that word.
He cast a quick
Pansy had visited him every day before and after classes, and she, Narcissa, and Draco would usually play Exploding Snap to pass the time and to forget all of life’s troubles.
Harry was blushing, and it was plainly obvious the red color darkening his cheeks wasn’t due to the cold.
“Well, get it into your head that it wasn’t.” Harry’s hands found their way into Draco’s hair. “You know, I never spoke to you about what you said to Hermione and Ron. When they told me you’d apologized to them, I swear my brain stopped working for a second there.”
He still made sure he looked presentable every day, but it didn’t take him as long to get ready in the morning this year than it had previous years.
He was surprised an article in the
Fuck.
He thought about the other night before he had slept, and what he had said to himself. He had wished the world would stop. He had gotten that wish, to an extent. He was stuck with Potter, of all people. But they were currently searching for others who were wandering around Hogwarts, probably just as confused as Potter and him. Draco was certain there had to be someone else. It was just too weird to think that out of all people in Hogwarts to be stuck with each other, it ended up being The Savior and The Death Eater.
Draco had been wrong.
Somehow Harry’s hands had moved from grasping at Draco’s shoulders, to hooking his arms around Draco’s neck. Before he knew it, Harry rested his head against Draco’s shoulder. His arms that were still flung around Draco’s neck began to tighten, almost as if he were holding onto dear life. Almost as if Draco was Harry’s only saving grace.
“Yeah, well,” Potter laughed.
surprised he said something he hadn’t planned on saying. He just wished it hadn’t been what sex he was attracted to.
“Are you going to tell me what’s up or not? I want to help you with whatever it is. You were happy earlier, what changed?”
for saying his name.
. He never ended up finding
His silent cries quickly turned into violent sobs, and he found he honestly couldn’t care less at the moment.
“Draco, tell me what’s
Once Draco had stepped into the Room of Requirement, he bolted to the bathroom, locking the door manually and with multiple spells.
“I’m-” He sputtered, no words coming out of his mouth.
The simplest answer would have been Harry. Harry was making him dreadfully unhappy. And, quite frankly he was. Harry was annoying as ever, trying to get Draco’s attention and talk to him any chance he could get, giving him all sorts of looks, just over all making Draco’s life frustrating. But that was the simple answer.
Draco didn’t dare pull up his sleeve and look at the dark ink. There was a Muggle razor on the sink, and he was not strong enough to resist the urge to drag it across his arm at the sight of the Dark Lord’s Mark.
I most certainly don’t hate you anymore.”
“The song with the ‘ruling the world’ or whatever.”
He tried to sit up, but was immediately hit with a burst of pain, coming from pretty much everywhere.
Drys sneered. “The more people who can live under my empire, of course. And trust me, no one will want to stop me. I’m going to be making the world a
Suddenly Pansy and Blaise were sitting on either side of him. Pansy rested her head on his shoulder.
Even though he didn’t really want to ask the question, he had to know the answer. “Did anyone else see- you know.” He lifted his left arm up for a second.
return for eighth year?” Draco countered.
The Dark Mark gave a sharp sting, which made Draco realize he was still sitting at the edge of the forest floor, his clothes ruined and the rain pouring over everything, and Drys and Alec were watching him and Harry with disgust.
and not having the courage to properly thank Harry, and maybe apologize to him for everything at the same time.
So Potter was back to calling him Draco again. He had to admit, he liked hearing his name come out of Potter’s mouth.
Thanks to his probation, he was under the watchful eye of Minerva McGonagall. If he ever wanted to leave Hogwarts to go down to Hogsmeade, he’d have to ask for permission from her, which he was dreadfully scared to do.
“Help! I’m stuck in this broom closet!” Draco yelled at the top of his lungs. Though, he made sure he didn’t sound desperate, just wishing for freedom, in an urgent fashion. Yeah.
Finally, when he felt her wrapping the new bandage around his forearm and cast a healing spell on it, he turned his head and looked at Pomfrey who was now gathering her things.
Draco didn’t say anything.
Draco almost forgot to breathe.
And just like that, a flash of green light filled the room, illuminating the shiny masks and highlighting Alec and Drys’ faces of horror and disbelief. Olive fell to the floor, her lifeless body opening up a void of grief and un-realness.
“Draco!” Harry smiled as they pulled away from each other. “Happy-” but he never got to finish his sentence. Ron grabbed his arm, saying something about impressing a Ministry official, and just like that, the trio was gone.
blood? Definitely not to admire and keep in a jar, although Draco was sure some crazy fan out there would do that.
He rubbed at his eyes and yawned, while feeling around for his wand on the couch. Once he found it, he cast a quick
Harry lifted his head. “It’s good to see you.”
Pure surprise was written all over Harry’s face. “Of course,” he said.
“Stop rambling, Potter. I’m fine. It- it wasn’t a nightmare.” Draco said. He sat farther up in bed, pulling the blankets up with him. Should he tell Potter about his dream? No, it was definitely some sort of vision-message thing. Not really a dream at all. He was sure of it this time. He could remember the difference now between whatever the vision was, and a genuine real dream. Maybe he couldn’t tell the other morning, after he had the first vision, because he had been drugged on potions thanks to Madame Pomfrey, before he had slept.
I can create a very special spell just for you right this second, that would
“Don’t call him ‘the Dark Lord’ then. I thought you were better than that.”
“We could write a note. We could get one of the owls to send a note to the Ministry, and see if they are alright. If they are, then they can help us.” Right as Potter finished speaking, he realized how dumb of an idea that was. Draco could
All three charms hit him forcefully right in the chest, and Draco was honestly surprised by the complexity of the charms cast.
For a minute no one said anything, and the only noise that could be heard was the crackling sounds of curses and spells hitting Draco’s protective shield.
Harry went on, “I think I want to be some kind of teacher. I haven’t thought about it thoroughly, but I like the idea of helping and teaching kids.”
“My son is a smart young man,” Drys said, “I've also taught him most of everything I know, so there’s that, too.”
all the key ingredients to what I planned to enact. I was missing a couple small parts, however, and those small parts were located in Hogwarts. I needed two types of blood: the blood of someone prophesied and the blood of the youngest and eldest Death Eater.”
After searching all his pockets, Harry had collected a handful of things, and set them down carefully on top of the table in front of them both.
“So, uh, get in- closer.” Harry cleared his throat.
Pansy was inviting a good amount of people. She made sure to invite all of Draco’s closest friends, which consisted of Blaise, Greg, and of course herself. Then she made sure to invite some of his acquaintances: Hermione and Ron.
go back to normal. He didn’t know how feelings worked, since he’d never experienced this type of affection towards anyone, but he did know that he needed to snap out of his crush and go on with his life, not pining after someone who still hated him.
He was dying to leave but his understudy would arrive until six and he couldn’t leave the ward without someone managing it.
“No.”
He held out his hand to the boy on the stairs of Hogwarts, his gaze still encapsulated by the other boy’s emerald eyes.
“I know you’re lying to me, Draco. I’m not upset. Well, I don’t know. Maybe I am. But that’s my issue to deal with. I deserve fair worse, and if I was prying, I’m sorry. I’m not accusing you of anything, and if you don’t want to tell me that’s fine, just have the guts to say it instead of trying to lie to my face.” He went to walk away, but found himself held back, embraced by two soft feathery wings.
---------------------------------------------------
He watched crestfallen, as his soulmate walked away, with some other bushy-haired girl and the young Weasley. That wasn’t how it was meant to go. His soulmate… was his. He had to be. Someone to love, someone to love him. This wasn’t happening, right? It was all just a nightmare.
“Well who did you expect, dumbass?” the apparently now
He supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised. Draco hadn’t woken up. And, why would he? It hadn’t even been a day. He was weak. Maybe too weak… No. If it worked.
Maybe Malfoy wanted to dress him up.
“You would know,” Draco said at last, joining in the conversation. “You’ve eaten the same breakfast every day for the last seven or so years. You took a couple of days to find your favourites, and you haven’t changed since. The last time I can recall you eating anything else for breakfast, at Hogwarts, was in year five. You went through an eggs and sausage phase.”
“Well, I suppose that’s true. What do clothes matter really. They only define the impression we give off to well… everyone. I’m sure it would be all the same if you simply went about life in a sheet, seeing as clothes are so tiresome,” Malfoy smirked as Harry glowered.
“No, Minerva, I’m okay.” She raised an eyebrow. “No, really. I’m doing okay. If I get the chance to formally apologise then it will be all for the better I’m sure. Really, it’s fine. I’ll burn that bridge when I come to it.”
“I don’t see how you could want anything different,” Harry said, shocked, “but I am fairly certain Hermione is right.”
---------------------------------------------
A chill shivered down Harry’s spine, but he didn’t allow himself to dwell on it. He had nothing to fear. Just a grudge several decades long not to mention the murder of their master and lord and basically the entire reason they were sent to Azkaban.
Draco just watched, confused, pain and disappointment evident in his features. He longed to see the green-eyed boy again, longed to make him smile and laugh, longed to make him happy.
“What colour are my eyes, Draco? Draco? What color are they?” the boy persisted, and finally becoming somewhat annoyed, he answered, truthfully.
It always was. No surprise there, but after the gardens, surrounded by light and colour and an array of bird-song, it felt stifling. Harry made his way towards the edge of the bed on the opposite side as the blonde, clutching and releasing the unconscious man’s hand to…
He sighed. He did know that he just wished it didn’t have to be… well a Gala?
And they were staring. It hadn’t quite gone silent, like in the movies Harry had recently acquainted Draco with, but it became quieter, and numerous questioning gazes settled on him. To be perfectly honest it was unsettling.
Of course, his actions had not gone unnoticed by his partner, but with the relatively simple explanation of trying to get away from the war and the Press, the subject was left neglected.
His first few weeks back hadn't been eventful, it had helped that he was proven to not be a Death Eater and his public apology had gone a long way to people seeing him as another survivor of the War, rather than an aggressor. He spent most of his time with his friends, the Eighth Year students were housed together because there wasn't room in their house dormitories. Draco shared a room with Ron, Blaise and Neville. Harry was with Dean, Seamus and Justin Finch-Fletchley. Justin was the only male from either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw to return.
Hermione sniffed and nodded, finally allowing Ron to lead her away without a fight. Draco flung himself into the chair she'd vacated next to Harry, hanging his violet lined cloak up on the hook beside the door.
"Hello, Mr. Potter. Healer Malfoy has referred you to me, stating that your retrograde amnesia has turned into something of an anterograde amnesia," Luna's voice had the same clinical tone as Draco's.
Draco wasn't sure where they were going to sleep, but noticed the stairs to the attic - maybe there were more rooms? Draco wandered up to the attic floor, followed by a quiet Harry, where they found two comfortable looking bedrooms and another bathroom with a large bathtub. The tub sat under a huge window, too grand to be considered a skylight. Draco thought longingly about a luxurious bath looking out at the stars.

"Araminta, dear, settle down!" Narcissa was reaching for her granddaughter who stood on James' groin in her rush to jump into Narcissa's arms.
₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪
"Okay, but Draco?" Harry holds his hands in a prayer gesture.
Hermione hugged Molly and Arthur goodbye as they headed through the Floo to join Andromeda and Narcissa at Grimmauld Place. Kingsley thought that it was best if they said their goodbyes before heading to Kings Cross, the returning students could arrive just before the train left and spend minimal time being gaped at on the platform. Hermione turned her thoughts again to how their family had pulled together in the aftermath of the War. Molly could be found most afternoons laughing and crying in the Grimmauld kitchen with Hermione's mum, Andy and Cissa. Arthur and her dad had taken to walking Teddy around the gardens of The Burrow, talking to him about the plants and delighting in his hair changes when he saw different coloured flowers. Ginny and Neville had roped Harry into redoing the small garden at the back of Grimmauld, smearing dirt over each other and pelting each other with flower bulbs. George and Draco threw themselves into Wheezes, Draco filling the role of potions expert and surprising font of obscure magical theory. Ron and Hermione helped in the shop during the months before George had hired full time staff. She had overhauled their inventory system and Ron had a surprising flair for creative displays.
"You cannot possibly apologise for something you have no memory of doing," Hermione snaps.
"You may not remember it, but I do. You heard about your two year old godson and told us in no uncertain terms you didn't want anything to do with him," Andromeda scowls, "He has no memory of you. As far as he knows, Ronald and Draco are his godparents."
Harry grinned at him again and winked. Draco's heart stuttered and he blushed deeply. "Shut up, Potter."
"I cannot believe you're sleeping on such filthy sheets - I'll change them," Molly flicked her wand at the makeshift bed Draco had arranged against the wall. George had smuggled in a Muggle camping cot that Arthur had in the back shed.
"She was furious. She came after us, the week before we got the Manor back," Draco whispered, "We were staying at the Hogs Head. Aberforth doesn't care who you are as long as your gold is real, so he didn't mind us staying there, we'd paid him extra to keep it quiet. Aberforth kept his word, but she'd spotted Mother buying some new clothes at Gladrags and followed her back."
