But Draco was lighter than he had been seconds ago.
“Do you know what these are for?” Malfoy asked.
Or maybe Draco was being too fanciful and imagined these noises. After all, he hadn’t been able to sleep without a valium for a long time now, which he invariably forgets to pack every time he leaves London.
Cross looked disappointed. “Really, Lucius, you’re not going to help me? What a disappointment. Just like your son, you’re always too coward when it came to taking action.”
Granger shook her head. “There isn’t anyone on the team with his credentials. And we can’t risk moving the artifacts. We don’t know what kind of spells and traps there are at the place. We might only get one look at them before the whole place explodes.”
Draco did, in fact, had many clues about the Shield’s existence, like the fact that he had held it in his own hands. Disappointingly, he did not have any idea about its current location except that it was likely headed to the hands of a madman.
“What were you thinking, running around London like that?”
“And I trust you followed all the procedures, yes? Transmitted a cease order to them and tried to cut off their chip?”
“Watch your tone, Potter,” McLaggen warned. “You might be Shacklebolt and the Minister’s favorite, but I’m still your immediate superior.”
“Sorry,” Draco said, wiping his mouth. “That was uncalled for.”
“I can leave whenever I want, actually,” Harry said. And now Draco was certain Harry did smile. “Perks of a nontraditional job. Although I haven’t realized how much I missed having an office, a secretary and receptionists, all the works.”
Granger looked at me sympathetically. “Don’t think about that. And no matter your faults, you’re reformed. You were just a child.”
“There’s actually an entire hoard of treasure down there,” Draco said, laughing at Theo’s crestfallen face. “I’ll give you the exact location later. And the pictures of it. I want my name on the discovery, but you’ll get the salvage rights and the rewards associated with it.”
“I said your boss, not this glorified lackey,” Harry said to the Afghan man.
Trust me, Harry mouthed back.
Harry scoffed. “Don’t be stupid.” Heat rose up Harry’s neck. “You think too highly of yourself.”
I wonder what I would feel when I ground against him. Would he be as controlled and cool as ice? Or would he return with equal fervor? I imagined the press of his erection against my arse: it would be long and thick and hard with need as I was right now.
Now Granger looked discomfited. “He — ahh — he left. He told me he had an urgent call and needed to leave immediately. I can drive you to the train station tomorrow. Molly can get one of the rooms upstairs ready for you tonight.”
Potter’s body was long and lean, even wrapped up under that tent of robes. I longed to press myself against that broad chest, wrap my legs around his waist – my hand quickened its pace – as he mouthed my neck, his hands roaming and kneading with callused roughness.
Very well, Hedwig replied. Activating Immobulus Protocol for the suspect car.
Harry glowered at Draco. He looked not unattractive, even when – especially when – he bared all that nice teeth, Draco decided. Draco forbore to share that little insight with Harry, though. Draco was a gentleman; he wouldn’t use underhanded tactics to unsettle his opponent.
“Then why did you leave?” The question was out of Draco’s mouth like a bullet. “Why did you go when I needed you the most?”
He reduced me to a bundle of sensations, before his finger was replaced by the real thing.
“I know that,” I said. Then, more quietly: “They seem to want me to help them find it.”
It was a statement more than any kind of greeting or acknowledge. “Weasley.” I tried speaking in as cool a manner as I could, though the effort was ruined by a slight quiver of exhaustion.
If the artifact – the Decoder, that ridiculous name – was too fragile to be moved, then they would take pictures, imaging it from all possible angles, to be studied back in London.
“Initiating exit protocol.”
Draco went still as Harry’s hand brushed over his thigh. He couldn’t help it – all the blood in Draco’s body seemed to rush downward, and Draco’s brain fizzed out.
He sank back into the seat, his consciousness flowing like the sand from an hourglass … he was tired, and he leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, allowing the movement of the car to lull him ….
“It’s ancient history now,” Shacklebolt said, staring at the holo-projection. “Or it feels like it. In any case, young Malfoy had nothing to do with Riddle’s coup. I believe he was under car at St. Mungo’s hospital at the time, undergoing treatment for the injuries he sustained when he was kidnapped as a child.”
I brooded on Potter as I made my way to the Atrium. Quitting the Aurors did not sound like him. He made an enormous fuss about becoming one during school. That screaming match McGonagall had with the old toad Umbridge about Potter joining was legendary.
“If we can learn to stand and walk, I don’t see why Sentient Intelligences can’t learn to adapt to a body,” Malfoy said. For a second, a shadow crossed his face. “Human bodies are much more difficult, though. I don’t think any experiments with Sentient Intelligences and human bodies have ever worked.”
Potter helped me gently off the broom. I refused to let go of his arm, knowing that if I did, I would immediately collapse on the floor.
Of gossip, I had too much to count. I’d deny if anyone asked, but I had devoured every periodical that he featured in. There were breathless accounts of his marriage with the female Weasel, from portraits of domestic bliss to rumors of rancor. One memorable headline screamed: “HARRY POTTER AND PERSONAL TRAINER: MORE THAN FRIENDS?”, complemented with photos of a shirtless Potter looking annoyed at the camera as he did calisthenics. All the blood in my body had flowed downwards, and I had to excuse myself from the meeting I was for a quick trip to the lavatory to splash cold water on myself.
“He couldn’t have survived that, could he?” Those black flames, I had researched later, were kin to the Fiendfyre, a lesser known but more controllable version called Ignis Diablo. Cursed fires were a fascinating branch of the Dark Arts. Perhaps they should be the focus for my next project.
“It is unjust, master,” his acolyte said, in a low voice trembling with fanaticism and awe. It called to mind the reverence with which my aunt Bella had regarded the Dark Lord with. I wondered at it, the quality that allowed one to so enthrall others so wholly, that they would devote their dying breath to you.
It always startled Harry to see himself reduced to a complex set of facts and numbers. He saw the statistics on his cybernetic parts follow, scrolling up in a tiny font that Harry would need to squint to read.
“I might be old, but apparently life still has surprises in store for me,” she continued. “You here with Mr. Potter being one. Perhaps the results of your inquiry can be another. I assume you’ll let me know after you’ve ascertained the results?”
“It’s been five years,” Harry said. “When I was in between places at the time ….”
“No. The book-key won’t respond to you.” I tried to keep my voice still. “And I need to go back. I need to be there. It’s my home.”
“Oh.” Potter was mercifully silenced as we entered the room at that moment. Here, my parents still kept the pretenses of the old days, that we were amongst the first families of the Wizarding world. A grand tapestry dating back to the Norman Conquests hung on the walls, and a great table covered by a white tablecloth dominated the room. It was lit by two ornate silver candelabras and a Venetian chandelier that tinkled softly every time it swayed.
“What my colleague meant to say is,” Shacklebolt interjected hurriedly, seeing Draco opening his mouth for a furious retort, “is that we need your help. There’s no one alive who understand your father better than you do, and we need your expertise on the matter.”
“Restless?”
“It is my house,” Potter replied mildly. Whatever shock or embarrassment that he had must have faded, and he leaned back against his chair, looking at me with a cocky expression. “Besides, you’re usually sleeping about now. Why are you up?”
“Four,” Draco said. His mind, though still bumpy, had recovered to a state of relative clarity now.
“So far, all the discovery and clues have been linked by blood,” I said slowly, thinking back on everything that had led us here. “It’s reasonable to assume that this would the same.”
“Potter, I don’t want your pity.” Malfoy bent down – and in a quick motion, kissed Harry.
Draco spoke rapidly: “The object in question dates from around 1300 BC, judging by the style of the engraving and the intricacy of the enameling. It suggests that this Shield is not entirely Mycenean in origin, as the Myceneans used a technique called cloisonne, which is when thin flat strips of gold separate the enamel. The technique here used is much more reminiscent of what the Celts did, which is when cells or impressions are filled with the powdered glass. It would make sense, as the Myceneans had a very developed trading network, with Mycenean products being found in even Wales.”
“Sodding Gryffindors,” Draco muttered. The old House rivalry didn’t die an easy death. At least whatever Granger was doing numbed the pain. It was beginning to get difficult to think.
Laying it out on a towel, Draco began to methodically wipe down the Decoder. Parts of it were crusted with sand and kelp and rust. They came off surprisingly easily.
It’s true, Harry said sharply. We don’t deal with missed tax payments. Then, more hesitantly, do you remember the man’s face?
“Thank you.”
It was a stroke of luck that I remember the Life-Sharing spell. It was an even greater fluke that it worked. Blood magic was unpredictable, particularly one that I had never used before.
“It’s hard to have your sangfroid when I’m out on the street actually doing my job,” Harry said sharply.
“I do remember there was an article published in my father’s magazine about it,” she continued slowly. “I don’t remember the details, but the gist was that there’s a secret society after it. They’re part of a conspiracy since the medieval times that seeks to influence Magical society to their pureblood agenda and will not let anyone get in their way.”
Malfoy waved that aside.
It was intoxicating, the sensations and Potter’s small rocks going straight to my groin and overheating my brain. My hands explored his body, feeling the muscle, the iron strength beneath the skin. My fingers clawed at his back as he pushed against me, his mouth hot and insistent.
We had all grown up. Harry had grown up, too. No longer as brash as I remembered, though still very much impulsive. Afterall, he leapt in front of me to take the hit from an unknown curse.
“We’ll go look for it,” Potter promised. “And after? What do you plan to do? Since it’s possible it’s a memory, it means we’ll have to go find a Pensieve.” He looked at Granger. “Where can we find one, other than at Hogwarts? Malfoy mentioned that there was one at the British Museum, but given that this Cross fellow is the head there ….”
… It faded into a plush living room with a roaring fireplace that gave off a claustrophobic impression. The librarian faced someone in an ornate armchair that was almost a throne. The figure in the chair was cloaked by the brightness of the fire and the resultant shadow thrown.
“You know him?”
“Dinner at the Manor. And come back later; I’m already running late.”
Draco remembered his actions with a flush of shame. Schoolboy antics, to be sure: immature and stupid, they still stung, and Draco understood now that even the smallest slight hurt disproportionately in childhood. Not to mention Harry’s other best friend, Hermione Granger, now completing her pupilage, was the subject of Draco’s worst misogynist insults. Perhaps Draco couldn’t stand a girl beating him for top marks, perhaps it was his father’s taunts that he couldn’t outsmart a girl, but it was still no excuse. But Draco was too proud to apologize now, and in any case, he had no idea how to broach the topic without opening another fresh wound.
“You know what I’m talking about. The key to Grimoire. You, the blood of Slytherin. You will lead us to it or feel even more pain –”
“Don’t you know that’s the moment when you figure out what’s really important? It’s what all the novels say.”
Harry looked torn. “I’ll think about it,” he said finally. “I’m not fond of Ministry politics, and I don’t want to be some figurehead for whatever Department that needs me to make a play for a bigger budget. But if it’s some substantial work….”
“Understood, sir. I’ll start in the kitchen.”
Draco’s first instinct was to reject Mr. Weasley’s news. It couldn’t be true – his father was not shortlisted for canonization, but his father had no need to do anything as risky and illegal as laundering money for a criminal organization. And – his father would not be so foolish to be caught.
I know it – it’s there in my mind – I just need to pull it out of the morass of facts and memories. I glared. I rubbed my temples. A headache pressed; I longed to shut my eyes for some relief. What I had just experienced left me winded and disoriented. I needed to organize my thoughts.
Cross cursed and turned to deal with them. In the split second that he was distracted, Potter grabbed me and pulled me aside. With a wave of his wand, he vanished the window and threw me out.
“Cross. He’s Cross. And my father’s body is in the center of the fire!”
“Harry, what the hell?”
“She’s notorious,” Harry answered shortly. “Responsible for some of the most brutal assassinations and kidnappings in this decade.”
“Busy with what?” my father said sharply. “You can’t tell me that you’re willing to give up your heritage as a Malfoy to traipse around the country instead of taking up your rightful place here.”
He took the Decoder from Draco’s hands, his fingers grazing Draco for the barest second. Draco suppressed a shudder – they were colder than stone, and just as unyielding.
“Ah.” Draco supposed this was a peace offering of some sort, in the form of a faded Nirvana t-shirt and baggy jeans. “Thank you. That’s kind of you.”
There was a delicate cough from Malfoy. “In that case, I suppose I won’t escort you out,” he said. There was an expression in his eyes that Harry might have thought was disappointment.
The hours intervening since our tense exchange had eased that strain. I was reluctant to break that détente, but curiosity made it impossible to keep silent. “What exactly is your job now? I’m sorry if I don’t understand it completely.”
“There’s been an upsurge in the use of Elixir, sir. As you know, Elixir was originally created to deal with burnout from cyber-immersion in the Web. It forms a neurochemical compound that acts as a relaxant for the center of the brain linking the virtual simulacrum. It makes me think that there must be a corresponding rise in the burnouts too.”
Draco had only seen Granger this ferocious once before, and on that occasion he had gotten punched. But he was reluctant to go in all the same.
“That isn’t what a typical addict has.” Harry’s stomach rose queasily at the continued sight of it. With a harsh effort, he tamped it down. “It’s much worse than the usual damage. What happened?”
He had been escorted into a room dominated by a large table in the middle and a large screen depicting a map of Afghanistan. Next to it was a whiteboard with what Draco supposed was a detailed diagram of military operations. It looked more like a child’s scrawl to him.
Potter kept his eyes on me. “Keep them,” he said quietly.
It had not occurred to him how difficult it was to leave Harry again. They had met again in the morning for breakfast, a paltry meal of insipid tea and overcooked bacon, for the final briefing. Neither of them had mentioned what happened between them last night.
I shook my head. “No. Thank you.” It was odd, this polite professional behavior between us. “I suppose I should tell you why I’m here.” I eyed him hesitantly. “Unless Granger already told you.”
Well, this was just the liquor talking. Now I had to get home and tidy up for Potter.
Then he closed his eyes.
The lights were on. They hurt my eyes. I did not recall leaving them on when I left. Then again, my mind was so fuzzy right now, I could barely remember my own name. I should not drink this much. But they seemed to have dulled the knife’s edge that I felt myself standing on. That altercation with the librarian shook me. It raised so more questions than it answered, and they plagued my mind like locusts.
“Don’t blame yourself too much, mate,” the man from Yorkshire said. “You did some of the quickest spellwork I’d ever seen, mate. You should’ve seen him, ma’am – it was impressive, the way he just cast spell after spell like bam! And then he did this weird thing with his palm and blood and there was a light and –”
Despite the overcast sky, the lake was still beautiful to behold. I stared at it, the waters rippling slightly, and thought I saw the shadow of tentacles underneath.
I shrugged off my waxed field jacket and my Slytherin House scarf. Despite the clear day, it was still autumn, with the attendant biting weather. I would have preferred a cloak, but wandering through Muggle London, it would have looked odd. And the streets were dirty; I didn’t want it dragging through.
“Well,” Rosa smiled, “I am also a licensed psychiatrist. I’m only doing this as a sideline. And because I enjoy it.”
Harry glowered at Tom the Bartender. “You knew what Blaise was going to do and you didn’t stop him?”
“That’s a good idea,” Potter said thoughtfully. “And this Circle has links to Voldemort. We can ask your father if he knows anything.”
“They’re somehow linked to my past,” I told him quietly. The room seemed to grow shadowed at its mention. Potter tensed, his hand gripping his fork a little tighter. I watched the strong, callused fingers with unmanicured nails. “They mentioned something about the Dark Lord being a candidate. And now it’s me.”
“Wonderful. Let me just get my keys….”
“More like poison me to death.” I glared at Potter without heat. He was right; it did relax me, just a miniscule amount. But it was enough to restore most of my mental functions. “We need to inform the Ministry of what happened. Or at least Granger. And have someone go to the Manor to – to retrieve the bodies.”
“You shouldn’t doubt my competence. But my good intentions?” Malfoy barked a short, sharp laugh. “If you haven’t figured it out after thirty years of living in this world, Potter, you should realize that none of us have good intentions.”
“Alright.” Harry gave me a peck. “Let’s take a nap. I want to get some food later, and then there’s a place I need to visit.”
Goyle had been part of Draco’s little clique, both being of the same Hogwarts House and the same age. He was one of the few Draco kept in touch with, though it mostly was limited to contracting for the Manor’s repairs.
He gritted his teeth. Communication with HQ was blocked; it was too far underground here. And even if Harry could call for help, it would likely arrive too late. He had to keep moving and get back to the surface. If the men from the club caught up to Harry in this condition –
“Wasn’t paying that well,” he said lightly. “Public sector salaries being what they are.” His eyes shadowed and he glanced away quickly.
“The symbolism is apt, isn’t it?” Malfoy smiled a wolf’s smile. “The group that calls itself after the creature that births itself from destruction. Interesting. Not that I much object. The current Ministry … well.” He shrugged, a motion that could have meant anything.
Fletcher leered at Draco. “Oh, come now. You can’t be that sheltered. From the sound of your accent, you went to those posh schools where things like this happened on a regular basis. I’m not asking for much.” He leaned in close to Draco, his mouth opened. Gin combined with tobacco was an unpleasant combination, and Draco scrunched his nose.
“Yes.” Harry was thankful too.
Harry cursed. Hunting like this was not a solution; his Firebolt had greater speed, but it was too crowded an environment for him to go full-throttle. He could chase the car out of the grid, but this was London and the urban sprawl stretched for many more miles. He couldn’t keep the pace for too long either; the Firebolt might be the fastest vehicle, but it lacked the power that the target’s more conventional engine had.
The bar was in an uproar. Fists flew his way. Harry’s combat mode flicked on. He dodged them, returning with his own, well-aimed blows.
I waved it aside. “It’ll give me an edge my colleagues don’t have. And maybe it’ll be fun. You’ll have to bear with me, though. I’m a poor duelist.”
“You’re thinner,” Blaise said, his hands running down my chest. “You need to eat more.”
“What is it?”
It was a Harry that was taking over. The flinty eyes, the harsh lines of the mouth — Draco knew that eventually, they would harden until the easy smile disappeared beneath the hardness.
I can calibrate your bolts to cancel the car’s shots, Hedwig said, but it would mean that you will not be able to fire anything that might disable its engines.
“I can’t just let him die in front of me.” My voice was a dry rasp. I coughed. “Do you have some water?”
“Oh. Sorry,” I gave a tinkling laugh, one that I witnessed Blaise using on the most recalcitrant of models. “It’s been a while. I haven’t thought about school in a while.”
Harry ignored the profanity. “You’re staying here in the base, so it’s more accurate to say that I’m your handler. I’m not letting you anywhere near the operation. You’re a civilian – we can’t risk you getting hurt.”
“Don’t follow any attractive stranger home,” Malfoy called out, his feet propped on the table, one hand swirling a crystal goblet. “I don’t fancy coming to your rescue twice in one night.”
Harry walked into a long corridor with holo-frames decorating the walls. Some of them showed the view outside the building while others were of swirling abstract art in pastel colors that made Harry slightly queasy. These could be changed to broadcast emergency messages or be used as consoles if the need rose.
“Sorry, Harry,” the Weasley said.
It jerked and Draco’s face hit the front seat. Next to him, Harry dropped instinctively, ducking. That saved him. Where the driver’s head had been was now shot through with a bullet.
I had no idea what the man was talking about, but the Dark Lord seemed inexplicably excited by this.”
“Hello,” I said politely. “You came just in time. I would like to request,” I looked down at my notes, “Manuscripts 102A and 15C, please.”
“He is,” Harry said. He couldn’t help but give Malfoy a fond look. “I think so too.” Harry by all accounts should be nervous, but he wasn’t. Not with Malfoy helping.
Alright.
“No,” Harry concurred. He drew in closer, ominously.
“I wouldn’t want to with one eye open and a wand under my pillow for the rest of my life. Speaking of, where is my wand?”
He laughed. “All right, sounds fair. What are you going to do?”
“However, we can rule most of these out as diversions for the unintelligent,” Metis said. “I have eliminated them from my analysis.”
I looked around warily. There was no sign of the blue flames. I knew that meant little; they could still burst out in any minute. If we took the wrong step ….
It was Draco’s own interaction with Weasley children which provided a greater source of conflict. Ron Weasley had been the target of Draco’s schoolboy abuses and taunts – and incidentally also Harry’s best friend. The news that Harry had begun dating Draco had caused one of worst arguments between the two friends – it was the only time that Draco had opted to sleep on the couch in his own flat, not wanting to intrude on Harry’s obvious emotional turmoil.
“No. We have regulations that disallows us from doing so unless you’re one of us. But if you have your own, feel free to bring it along.” Shacklebolt gave Draco a crooked smile. “You won’t be flying commercial, after all.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “And remember, this is covered under the Official Secrets –”
“’Course not, Mr. Malfoy. My concoctions are works of art. It would be an insult to tamper with them.”
“We need to talk.”
I wanted to rail at Potter for taking me away, for not helping my parents. I should be there. But I couldn’t blame Potter. He was right — we would be no use in that inferno. He was the only one thinking clearly here. If it had not been his help ....
“Oh, this must be your first time.” Goyle gave Harry a pitying look. “You think this is the Underground? This is only the cover for it. It’s far beneath us.”
“What happened?” Harry was appalled. “What was your father doing?”
Draco waited for Mr. Weasley to elaborate. He wanted to shake the older man for every sordid detail, never mind that they had a rapt audience now. Draco couldn’t look at the others. He knew what they were feeling – glee barely covered by a mask of shock, the judgmental pity and condemnation accompanying the schadenfreude.
Harry furrowed his brows. “And?”
“Then I’ll be coming with you,” Harry said. “We have to see this through together.”
The Shield and Decoder were not far away.  Draco hadn’t kicked hard enough. He picked them up — and ran.
“Then how are we supposed to see?” Harry snapped. His nerves were frayed – the heavy silence intermittently punctured by indistinct noises was suffocating. He had already switched on his infrared vision, but his bio-enhancements weren’t extensive, and the effect was limited.
“I can’t do that,” I said. “I can’t ask you to leave your wife and children to go on some wild chase that probably will have us traipsing all over the country.”
“Are you sure we can rely on him, Draco?” Harry asked, staring at Fletcher with disgust. “He’s not exactly reliable, is it?”
It was unlike their kiss earlier in the day. This time, it was gentle, sensual, exploring. Harry’s mouth parted, and Draco pressed in, soft as a feather.
It was Harry. Draco almost jumped off the bed, though he supposed it was logical that Weasley and Granger roomed him and Harry together.
“You underestimate us, Malfoy,” Bellatrix said, and Draco swallowed involuntarily. “However, I do like to avoid any … inefficiencies. What is it you are proposing?”
Harry glared at Malfoy. One battle at a time, he reminded himself. “Then you can help me.”
Stop. What was I doing? I couldn’t kiss Potter. This was a mistake of colossal proportions.
“Fine hospitality, this.” Draco gestured at the ropes that trussed him up. “Untie this, at least.”
“Hold it over the Shield,” Draco said, recalling parts of Rosier’s paper. “And then you shine a light through it so that as the Decoder moved, it would shed light – literally – on the pictographs of the Shield that would unlock it.”
Cross looked at my father, who had a curious expression. “What do you think, Lucius? Think about it … your family honor, restored. Your dreams … achieved. You as his father will share in the glory of ushering in a new world, where we don’t have to hide anymore. Where we will be restored to our rightful place guiding the wizarding world.”
“What? You mean booby traps or spiders?”
“Really likes you,” Granger said with a wink. “Show up in a sexy nurse outfit and I bet you’ll improve his mood.”
“That’s probably about to change,” I said. I looked at Potter wryly. “I take it I’m not allowed to go back to my own flat?”
I took his arm. I was ready as much as I would ever be.
“I thought you said you weren’t informants,” Fletcher said accusatorily.
I thumbed over it, relishing the little grunts of encouragements. I dug my thumbs into the waist of his pajama bottoms, about to pull them down –
“You’re new here, aren’t you?” a smooth voice asked. It was so close that the breath tickled Harry’s ear. Harry almost jumped, drawing out his wand.
“I went to place a tracker on their car,” he whispered. “We’ll be able to follow them once they leave.”
Harry sighed. Perhaps he was being naïve in his hopes. I suppose you’re right.
“No.” Potter’s voice was quiet. “It makes sense. I didn’t have any friends until I went to Hogwarts. That’s why I was so defensive of them when I first met you.”
Potter laughed out loud this time. “Credit card. But you’re not off the mark.” He surveyed me. “When did you begin paying attention to Muggle money?”
“I don’t feel it right now, so I’ll have to take your word for it.” I stepped out of bed gingerly and stretched, my muscles finding some long-needed release. Potter gave me one final look. And then he left.
Draco kicked the gas. The car crackled to a start and zipped off.
That object was created at the behest of Aristotle, Alexander the Great’s teacher, to whom Alexander had entrusted the secret of the Shield. Aristotle, a most learned man, had finally deduced the deeper meaning behind the engravings, which related the astronomical movements and complex calculations. Aristotle then commissioned artisans to create what Rosier quaintly termed ‘the Decoder’, to release the Shield’s full ability.
Unfortunately, Harry had learned his lesson since last time; he refused to help me with any more research. “I have faith in you, Draco,” he said, before beating an inelegant escape to his office.
“It works!” he protested. “My hair’s not falling out, isn’t it?”
“Alright,” Harry said, disappointed. “I’m sure we can think of another angle to investigate. If we can just –”
He was not sure exactly what they meant. The Greek inscriptions were clear enough; Draco had been reviewing his knowledge of the language ever since they had returned from the Aegean. Rosier had said that the outermost ring dial matched zodiac signs, but those were rubbed off. There was only the faintest of lines that indicated they had even been there to begin with; silvery traces that might have been mistaken for glimmers of light from outside the window.
“Well, even if this turns out to be nothing, at least I can always say I’ve taken a private jet to the Mediterranean,” Harry joked. “It’s quite nice, too.”
Ron, on the other hand, had sprouted from the tall, gangly boy into a broad-shouldered man with a suspicious gaze that was now directed at Harry.
“I have no idea you were military intelligence,” Draco said, settling on the first of the numerous questions running riot in his head. Well, the second. The first – the urgent need to know why Harry left-- hurt too much for Draco to voice.
“Apparently arranging deaths in car crashes is a specialty of theirs,” Harry said, and the bitterness made Draco want to reach out and hold Harry.
“Rosier did indeed possess the necessary expertise, but he was much too close to the truth of our actual plans,” Riddle said. “He was also beginning to cost more than he was worth. And who knew if he and Lucius had planned their little shenanigans together? It was better to be safe than suffer traitors. You do understand, don’t you, Wormtail?”
Harry obeyed. Silence ballooned between them again, and Draco wished that there was a way to return to even just a moment ago.
That would mean he needs to separate the two in order to persuade the Malfoy boy to bend to his will. Cross curses Malfoy’s obstinacy. If it were not for that, they would have possessed the Grimoire by now. That, and Lucius’ unexpected interference.
“There’s no point in false modesty,” Metis said. “We SIs are better than humans at this sort of thing.”
“Where are you?” Shacklebolt’s voice suddenly sharpened. “I’ll send backup.”
I raised a hand. “I’m not trying to justify any side of the argument. I’m only explaining what likely would have been Slytherin’s mindset in his preference for purebloods. Of course, it’s an outdated idea now, and we know that people will react with fear and violence towards anything they don’t understand. Both wizards and Muggles.”
“A hotel? They might come after us there. Not to mention we’re driving a car that’s been shot at and I have bloodstains all over me. Not mine,” Draco added hastily at the squawk on the other end of the phone.
“We need a place to stay for the night,” I said. “And someone who knows their way around here. Perhaps someone who knows the natural geography, the mountains and trails.”
Mors Mordre … Death Eaters. Draco poured himself a cup of tea. “I’m sorry, but this is all getting to be a bit ‘James Bond’. You’re saying that my father is part of this organization? That’s ridiculous. The criminal group he was accused of laundering money for wasn’t so impressive as this. They dealt in drugs and helped kleptocracies, yes, but what you said is a bit dramatic, isn’t it? And why isn’t the police dealing with this?”
“No,” Hedwig said. “There isn’t. At least not from what I could tell.”
“What else?”
And then he kissed me.
“I believe he was met with unforeseen obstacles, my lord. The Potter boy, for instance –”
“This has been an interesting way of filing an incident report,” I said. “I come to you for help and instead you’re asking me to assist you in a dangerous case.”
It was small and cozy looking affair, the sign cheerfully proclaiming rooms available. We entered to see a cantankerous looking fellow and his daughter, a buxom blonde with a bright smile that lit up even more when we entered.
“It has.” Blaise surveyed me. “This was fun.” He paused, one hand still on my chest as he pushed himself up. “It’s just … that, right?” He reached over for his own wand and Vanished the sticky cum off of us.
“We’re not old,” I said. I favored Harry with a small smile. “Just mature. And you more so than me – you’re the one that’s a father.”
But Granger had warned me to be careful … even as that memory entered my mind, my anger became suddenly tempered by a chill of paranoia. I had to be cautious. If Granger was right – and annoyingly, she was rarely wrong – then turning to the Aurors would be a mistake.
Potter laughed at my expression. “Don’t look too disappointed. At least nothing’s exploding in our faces.”
“Now, what is it you would like to know?” she asked. “Any questions on careers? Love? Or perhaps a general reading would be for suitable. We’ll have half an hour for this session, unless you wish to prolong it.”
“Fuck. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean –”
Potter glanced up. “That’s terrifying.”
Both Potter and Kreacher were instantly at my side. The elf’s tiny arms tugged at me as Potter scooped me up in his arms.
Maybe he should have confided in Shacklebolt from the beginning. It hadn’t occurred to Harry to do so; Harry knew that were it not for the bureaucratic restrictions, he could have well managed on his own.
“That’s how Theo makes his business,” Draco said. “Every year, there are people who fancy themselves treasure hunters here looking for sunken gold or artifacts. There are probably hundreds of wrecks here. And a new law recently passed by the Greek government opens the coastline to scuba divers.”
“Don’t shoot,” Draco yelled into the squawking radio. “I’m joining Commander Potter on his mission. You can confirm it with him when he gets back. Or ask Shacklebolt and Dawlish –” Draco read off the number they provided him, the one they warned not to give out indiscreetly. “I’ll bring the car back in one piece, I promise!”
“I think my plan is the soundest,” Harry said. “We’ll go inside, and I’ll check to see where Riddle’s office is. And then we’ll wait until they finish their work and leave before we go inside and take the Shield and the Decoder.”
There was a beat. Then Hedwig said: “You do not. Only the Head and Deputy Head have sufficient clearance to access this information.”
“Yes, a magical object that allows you to review memories –”
My hope was not in vain. The scents of toast and eggs and coffee drifted out of the kitchen. I grinned. That smell always put me a good mood. Strange, too, since I was not a morning creature by nature, and only rose early by the necessities of responsibility. Perhaps instead of thinking of the restrictions on my movement, I should try and imagine this as a vacation of sorts.
“Can someone get me a pencil and paper?” he called out.
Touch! Touch was what triggered the book’s magic. Touch and my proximity: the book responded when I physically approached it. If spells were not an option, and staring at it did no good, then maybe my fingers might find the answer.
“It’s fine,” I said. “I’m used to it.”
I almost slammed the thick volume into Potter’s face as he appeared at my shoulder.
“I didn’t know you knew about that,” Shacklebolt said. “It’s not a secret, but time passes, and most people forget about their history. And we did try not to broadcast the finer details of that coup all those years ago.”
“Thank,” Harry said. “It’s a good thing you were there when you were.”
“—Hogwarts,” I finished for him. The stone walls were instantly recognizable, the castle’s silhouette towering over us in the afternoon sun. “The stones look newly cut, though.”
“We don’t use the Dining Room anymore,” I said. “It’s where — was where we had the meetings.” A body suspended over the table, rotating ... a flash of green and it fell, heavy, with a wooden thud....
In that moment, I regretted my decision to deny my attraction to him. That simple act had set my heartbeat pounding harder than a ship’s broadside.
They drove into the dawn.
I recoiled from the double vision. But I needed to press on. An opportunity like would not present itself again.
Draco pulled up a chair and took a handlamp from the side. The etched symbols were definitely not a figment of his imagination. He relaxed slightly in his chair.
“Those were some of my best work, you know. The song, not the badge. The badge, admittedly, was a bit common.”
“How do you get in contact with her?” Harry asked.
But Draco didn’t ask that, much as he had a mind to. He definitely disliked Harry’s tone. In the olden days, Draco would have definitely responded. Right now, so short after their implicit détente, it would have been the emotional equivalent of the Soviets invading Afghanistan. And unlike the Soviets and the Americans, neither Draco nor Harry had any inclination to avoid mutual destruction when they argued.
“What now?” Draco panted. Perhaps this whole episode was a sign for him to revisit the gym.
“Good. The Americans are overconfident and distracted with the idea of terrorism.” Riddle’s face twisted. “Unlike their British counterparts, they are much less competent when it comes to dealing with us. However, they might still pose a danger. It is good that we have the opportunity to eliminate the leaks before they become threats. Anything else?”
The book! That must be what they came looking for. There was no other explanation. It was not an ordinary robbery; no burglars would expend this much effort into penetrating my wards. And nothing of value were missing. Smashed and destroyed, yes, but none were taken.
He sighed. It might mean he was back to trudging through dusty rooms again.
“Well … I suppose an arrangement could be made,” I said slowly. “But only if you grant me unfettered access to the Grimoire. And of course, we need to discuss my compensation.”
“Molly would kill us if we stayed at an inn instead of the Burrow,” Harry said with a laugh. “Besides, I can guarantee you her cooking is far better than anything they can serve.”
“Did he live alone?” Harry asked, more to break the squirming silence that would ensue had none of them answered the manager. Harry had already guessed the man would be, which was confirmed with a shaky yes.
“Yes, Draco, get out of here,” Bellatrix cooed. Draco’s eyes fixed on the barrel that was leveled at him. “You don’t want to see little Harry all sad, do you?”
I inhaled. I was ready as I would ever be. I strengthened the wards on my flat until the effort of casting them made my eyes water, then departed.
It almost didn’t register to Draco; he had pushed Harry out of the way, but his knees were giving out. His ears registered a roar and a more feminine gasp. Draco fell to the floor, his hands reaching out to brace himself even though he knew the man with the gun would fire again, this time at a closer target – him.
I would like to have a body like that owl, she replied. Though not exactly that model. But an owl nevertheless.
Draco froze.
There was a mechanical fluttering and a streak of silver that landed on Malfoy’s arm.
I wasn’t aware that I was doodling him until I felt a tap at the knee and a house-elf popped up.
“I’m taller now and not as sprightly as before. The perils of old age.” He gave a dramatic sigh.
“Let’s get you out of those briefs too,” Harry said and Draco heard the raw need.
“Sorry about your parents, mate,” the Weasley said to me, somewhat gruffly. “I don’t like them, and I don’t think I ever will, but I understand how you’re feeling right now.”
“Harry Potter, you need to use your imagination. Besides,” Draco took Harry’s hand with a grin. “I’m sure we can make it work.”
They turned and walked back to the castle, the sight of them dissolving like mist as I felt myself lift ….
“I think I’m older than you by a couple of months.”
“Thank you, sir.” Harry tried to stifle his yawn.
I did not respond.
Draco gave Theo a thumbs up, and Theo responded with a toothy grin.
“This is a lack of imagination,” Hedwig’s voice sounded, with a note of disapproval. “He could have set up his main console home as anything and he decided to go with his boring flat.”
“I don’t know,” he said finally. “Logically, it would be very difficult to. But my intuition – he didn’t seem like the man who would commit suicide, not even to take his enemies with him.”
“Alright, thank you, Sergeant,” Granger interrupted. “I get the picture.” Her voice was tempered with amusement, however. Two people in the periwinkle blue of the field Healers hovered over Harry. One took his vitals while the other was casting spells to stabilize his condition.
“I disabled your SI for now,” a familiar voice said.
Draco tensed. “I’m not. Why would I want to help people who think I’m scum?”
What was I going to do? I had several leads but nothing substantial on the mysterious book in my possession. “I’ll be in the Gringotts Reading Room,” I decided aloud. “You’re welcome to join me after if you want.”
“What is the progress on activating the Decoder, Wormtail? Have we found out how it works?”
Again, that green glow. But this time, it did not fade.
“You, Mr. Potter. He tried to kill you. Admittedly, he was a little rough with Draco here, but I have to excuse him for it. He’s never liked him.” Cross looked at me contritely. “You might try being more polite to others next time. It does wonders.”
“You don’t,” Draco said. “But I’m impressed that you know I’d probably do that.”
“You have a lot of nerve, Mr. Malfoy, for someone who might be an informant to ask for favors.” Fletcher had not shifted from his position next to Draco.
I looked at Potter. His face was earnest and set in determination. And, even in the midst of all that, he softened with sympathy when he caught my gaze.
“We’re not,” Draco said. “These people took something from me and I want it back.”
Draco looked at Harry sourly. “Thanks for that life lesson, Mother Theresa.”
They had walked from the Leaky Cauldron to the Tube, then to a rather insalubrious part of Outer London.
“Why the hell would we have anything to do with any attacks on Harry?” Ron burst out. “We might not talk anymore, but he’s my mate and we would never hurt him –”
Bellatrix nodded. “Yes, my lord. Dolohov believes he has the papers regarding the Shield which disappeared around the time Lucius defected.”
“There’s urgent business I need to discuss with you,” she said. She looked at us with amusement, clearly recovered from her shock already. “I didn’t know you two were busy. I can always come back later,” she offered.
“I hope you don’t intend to just talk at me,” I said. “Let us discuss this like civilized people, over tea. I assume you are amenable to that.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “Get in the car. Come on, I’ll drive.”
Granger laughed. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Just in time — black flames erupted in columns, the very picture of hell. The air vanished from my lungs, burned away by the heat. I gasped, black spots dotting my vision. I smelled the incinerated fabric of my robes as they caught in the fire, and searing pain edged my skin —
Not just a Web engineer, but a cybershrink. Someone who worked to develop Sentient Intelligences and ensure that their personalities and programming remained stable – and more importantly, stayed within the bounds of ethical parameters.
I rubbed my eyes. That had been … something. I wasn’t sure what I was trying for, but I provoked a reaction from the book-key. I knew I was on the right track if the book-key did something. Now I just had to figure out how to use what had happened.
“Yes. It is too much of a coincidence, though there is a chance that the hooded man is unrelated to what Commander Potter is investigating.”
“Infiltrators, not ‘filth.’” I gave a twisted smile. “Of course, paranoia isn’t a particularly endearing trait either. Especially in a pedagogical setting. And we know that the solution to fear isn’t more fear, but understanding and empathy”
“I’m not toying with you,” Harry snapped, stung. “I just want to figure out who attacked me. You’re linked to the manufacture of the weapon – just help me find out whoever it is. People are dying, Ron. People who are innocent in all of this.”
“You really should learn how to do this yourself,” Draco huffed. “It really isn’t that difficult.” Their closeness made it difficult for Draco to finish. He kept redoing the last step, the smell of Harry’s soap in his nose.
“From this direction, we can reach them in a few minutes. We can lay low with them for the night.”
“I told you,” he said. “I know what I’m doing.”
“How did you get in?” My father’s wand raised threateningly. “And get out. I’m having a private conversation.”
I whirled around, wand whipping out, ready –
Even through his trousers, I could feel his erection, rapidly thickening and hard, straining at the seams. He rutted against me, his breath hot on my neck as I arched to meet him.
Harry realized he was staring at Malfoy. With an effort, he pulled his attention to Fudge. “Yes, Minister?”
“You can regain all you have lost,” Cross said. He waved his wand and a great serpent made of flames flew out at Potter. “But I’ll give time for you to think about it over when I take you back –”
“It’s not that bad,” Draco conceded. He knew that along with the filth, being in this place stirred unwelcome memories in Harry. “There’s a lot of interesting objects in here. I feel some of my coworkers at Christie’s will definitely want to pay a visit sometime.”
“That wasn’t so hard, was it?”
There must be centuries worth of artifacts in here, not to mention thousands of galleons in value. Some of these objects, too, exuded dark power; I would not approach them absent any form of protection.
Harry slipped it into the sleeve-holder with a sigh. He didn’t like how exposed he was without it; it was like walking around with his eyes closed and hands tied.
They sat, Draco making a face at the streak of grime on his pants.
“Oh, Goyle was the one who brought you here?” Malfoy wrinkled his nose. It was a surprisingly endearing gesture. “Dirty, smelly man. Never liked him. I’m going to assume you’re here because of Ministry business and not, as Blaise suggested, because you need your prurient needs fulfilled?”
“So what do we do now, sir?” Finnegan asked, staring at the body. “Write that the man died of natural causes in our report? This man isn’t important enough to warrant media attention from the looks of it. I’ve never seen him before.”
I shook myself out of it and forced myself to consider the possibilities. A simple glamour was possible, though it should not have been able to resist my Revelio. It might be a Concealment charm of some sort, but that complicated my efforts –multiple variations existed and needed different combinations of counter spells to unlock.
“Protecting the innocent?” Granger looked at him. “You can always come back, you know. There’s always going to be a place for you.”
“I can toss this back into the ocean before you made a move,” Draco said. “It’s heavy; it’ll probably drift somewhere completely new, carried by the current, before you can dive to find it. I notice neither of you are wearing diving gear. You know that any delay will mean a higher chance of the Decoder becoming lost.”
I nearly jumped.
Draco looked at Harry in surprise. “But your flat might be exposed too.”
“I wouldn’t do that,” he said. More men came out. They wielded the same automatic rifles Dolohov held.
Harry felt it too. They ran harder, throwing all remaining effort into their sprint. They fell, knees deep in the sand.
“I hate to see you get hurt, too.” Attraction tugged at us as our eyes met. The air grew heated; I became hyperaware of my body, the little itch at the seam of my shirtsleeve, how my chest rose and fell with every breath.
“You look pale.” Potter examined me. “And you’re still shivering. What exactly happened?”
“No. Actually I called because we’re all getting drinks at the Cauldron. Wanna come?”
“We’re not asking you to. But we need someone who can reasonably verify the artifact once we’ve obtained it. It needs to be in the field — it’s too dangerous to risk any delay to ship it to any of the locations we typically use.”
His offer touched a raw, unguarded part within me, and I turned away quickly, blinking hard. “Thanks,” I said, staring resolutely at a spot on my hospital bed. St. Mungo’s really need to wash these sheets better. “I think I’ll be fine. Maybe I’ll ask my mother to come.”
I woke too warm and with a splitting headache. I missed the days of my youth when I would down an entire bottle of Firewhiskey without ill effects. Blaise was stirring next to me with a soft moan.
The Afghan man returned, followed by Greyback.
“Oh. Right. Yes, I heard that.”
“Ah … yes. I noticed that. Don’t worry about them; our men have already taken them. We’ll take good care of them, I promise.”
“Nothing. Well, except it’s from the 16th century and used for card games originally.”
His hand came, unexpectedly, on my shoulder. I noticed just now that there was a tea set on the bedside table. Evidently Kreacher the house-elf had come and gone with it.
“That was a long time ago,” Draco said. “Another life ago.” He allowed the very real bitterness of his past soak in. “Good intentions are seldom appreciated. I assume you know better than most what happened?”
“Draco!” Harry shook him. “Don’t freeze! Relax. Breathe. Focus on me. Listen to my voice.”
And now both they and the Manor were gone.
Besides me, Harry stirred in his chair. Unlike me, he had reached for a biscuit when McGonagall offered. I noticed Snape watching him coldly as Harry chewed noisily, and I almost smiled. Some things never change.
“Do we know who the man is?” Malfoy asked. “Metis, can you zoom in?”
Perhaps any spell cast on the book-key would be stronger with my blood. Since ancient times, blood had been used by wizards as a catalyst, a binding agent, and a source of power in its own right. It was a potent ingredient in potions and spell-casting. Maybe in this case ….
“Afraid of letting old Slytherin spy on you in the loo?” Harry chuckled. “But I’ll hold it for you. Can you manage to find your way around?”
Draco also had to smooth over matters with Theo. Theo was justifiably enraged about being kept in the dark and his boat being damaged by gunmen after his clients. Draco had explained everything to Theo.
He couldn’t suppress a twinge of envy as he stepped onto the tarmac. The polite doorman smiling at Harry, even more so when Harry flashed his warrant card; the quiet, almost noiseless ride up to the penthouse, with the elevator flying up seamlessly – it all screamed of obscene wealth.
Over the light music playing softly from the hidden speakers, Draco tried to probe the man for more information. How did he find business? Was there an influx of Afghani artifacts, or any Middle Eastern artifacts lately in the country?
How many surprises did this car hold?
“Thanks,” Harry said dryly, provoked into unwilling laughter. “I did pass Auror training, you know.”
“You?” I looked at her doubtfully. “Don’t you have a million things to do? Not to mention, all the paperwork that’s probably piled on your desk?”
I withdrew my finger, watching as the vapor flew out, slowly, into the blue flames.
“Yes, my master?”
Draco stared at Harry’s back as Harry exited. There was a nagging hunch that something would go wrong.
“I do,” Draco said. “But I do also know that the competition for these goods are limited. You can only sell them to so many who are, shall we say, less than curious about their provenance.”
I jumped into the kitchen, ready to unleash whatever hex my drink-addled mind could come up with on the intruder– and froze.
“That simple,” confirmed Draco.
With a bow and an expression of relief, Wormtail left.
“What? What makes you think I’m any more suited to dealing with poorly behaved patients than either of you?”
Draco didn’t hesitate to obey, pushing his head down beneath the seats. The metallic scent was even stronger, and Draco gagged. His control came back just in time, even as spots dotted his vision.  Blood was everywhere, moving in a creeping spread.
My heart skipped a beat. “Like Death Eaters.”
Granger made a face. “How was that?”
Draco’s hand was starting to numb from the cold, and his back ached. He used to be able to do this for hours at a dig, though he hadn’t had the opportunity to in years. Not even while he was aboard, since most of the work had been in an office on a computer.
McGonagall nodded. She likely had heard about Harry’s exit from the Ministry, though probably not the actual reason, but she was much too discrete to pry.
Riddle clutched his eyes, screaming. It was an awful sound, one full of pain and fury and despair that had everyone in the room grabbing their ears.
Draco ignored him.
“How did they know we were here? You don’t live here, do you?”
“Umm ... I understand that you’re happy to each other, but can you do that later?”
“Yes,” Harry answered, equally husky. “Let’s go back.”
My tote bag banged against my leg as I walked along the busy London streets, swerving to avoid pedestrians and obstacles. The knowledge that the book was in there burned, a distraction, and I barely managed to avoid a double-decker that came barreling down the road as I crossed the street without looking. It was in the nick of time, the red of the bus cutting so close that I could almost feel its paint rubbing on me.
“Huh? Oh. I was just thinking.” Quickly, I tidied up. I loathed letting others see mess, even old friends like Goyle. We had drifted apart after — well, after our last year at Hogwarts, the cataclysmic events overshadowing our friendship. Difficult was an understatement — dealing with Crabbe’s death, one that we witnessed before our eyes, the choices I had made leading up to that day — it broke us.
The elf dipped low. “I have served the House of Blacks for three generations and I recognize a member of our family anywhere. You have Mistress Narcissa’s eyes.”
“There’s a shower here on the plane,” Harry said.
“This was your bright idea?” Theo shouted at Draco from behind a wooden bench. “You’re wrecking my ship!”
“You’ll find your inspiration,” Luna said with conviction. “Or you can set that aside for now and find a new topic. There’s no point in forcing yourself to investigate a subject you’re not interested in.”
And it wasn’t like I was much better. I kept on becoming distracted, glancing over at Potter in between making notes of dates and locations. His profile shone in the sunlight streaming in from outside.
“Accessing Ministry database for Hopkirk, Hopkirk, Department of Transportation, Grade 5A.” After a moment, Hedwig said: “Access is denied under insufficient clearance.”
He dialed with numb hands.
Taking in a deep breath, he ran with all his might to grab the Decoder, gritting his teeth and bracing himself to be hit. He saw Dolohov raise the gun –
Shacklebolt nodded gravely. “That is my job, young Potter.” Though Harry heard the note of amusement in it, it was a clear dismissal.
“What was it to you then?”
That was the Riddle behind all this? The man who was responsible for setting this chain of events in motion, the man responsible for his father’s death, and the narrow escapes Draco and Harry had had?
I squinted at her. “I know. I can drink now.” She briefly cleaved in two before coming together. “Perks of growing up.”
“What do you want?” he said in flawless, if accented, English.
The car careened into the traffic while Harry issued his orders. Angry honks and sharp shrieks from protesting aluminum created a din that pierced Draco’s ears.
Harry glowered at the body. That was irritating. But there was excitement blossoming in his chest. This twist added some color to an otherwise banal example of modern life. “Hedwig, how else can you access the file?”
“The same way Mr. Malfoy did. Except I contact them first with what the buyer requested. And then they respond. We use post office boxes that arrange the drop-offs at a warehouse.”
Harry made a face. “What do you mean? They’re fine. I bought them a month ago.”
Harry moved with the surety of the site’s foreman and the agility of a dance, making his way through the dugout holes and the cranes. Draco willed him to hurry – any minute and Bellatrix would be finished with her inspection. Harry had to do whatever he was planning fast, leaving a window for him to escape.
“But no one loves you unconditionally. Even the most loving of families: they love you because you are one of them, that you share – something, blood ties, relations – with them. They don’t do that with a stranger. Family bonds are conditional; it’s just that we choose not to see it or think about it most of the time.”
Theo frowned at Draco. “I thought you were treasure hunting.”
It was deserted at this time in the night. Not even a squirrel or bird fluttered. Harry and Draco had propped themselves against the wall of a nearby outhouse, watching for any movement.
Not for the first time, Draco wondered how it was that he and Harry ever managed to enter a relationship in the first place, buffeted on all sides as they were by disapproving parents, friends, mentors. He supposed it had only been a matter of time before what they had ended in tears.
“Yes.” Fletcher bit his lip. “Do you need anything else?”
“I’m surprised it’s not completely in gold,” Harry commented.
“I wish it was a vacation,” Draco said, his gaze faraway. He wanted some time with Harry alone, just the two of them, without spies or hitmen interrupting. “It’s been so long since I’ve been in this part of the world. Though the last time I came, it wasn’t in such style.”
Draco was unapologetic, though he tried for everyone’s sake to project a meek and contrite demeanor. Somehow, he didn’t think it worked.
I approached the Grimoire slowly. My body tensed, ready for the reappearance of the fire at any minute. But none came and I reached the plinth which the Grimoire rested on with no incident.
“I’ll be starting with the household ledgers in the library. Then maybe the catalogues and some of the older reference books and house records. Maybe some of our ancestors’ journals.”
“I didn’t have a choice.” Malfoy didn’t look at Harry. “It was either let you go mad or this. You’ll suffer some small ill effects, but it’s not going to affect your life. I won’t let it.”
Harry grabbed the man’s hand, forcing the shot to go wide. It hit not two inches away from a man in tails, who fell back, his opera hat flying off. His companion, similarly attired, shifted to shield him. Harry caught a glimpse of gray eyes before turning back.
“I should’ve sleep with an Auror a long time ago if I had known you lot had this kind of reaction and this body,” Malfoy murmured. His hands traced Harry’s ribs.
Ron gave a sigh. “What do you need help with? I admit that we make wands equipped with the type of modules that you see in the schematic, but we haven’t provided anyone with those in over a year.”
McLaggen raised an eyebrow. “Touchy tonight, aren’t we?”
I gave her my stock response as my father turned on her with wounded outrage. “You’re having tea with Andromeda?”
She sobered. “But the investigation is highly classified. I only told you because you’re somehow linked to it already and I think you need to enter into the situation with all the facts.”
I poured a cup of coffee, the liquid almost splashing out and burning myself in my haste. “Is it usually your habit to wander around the house half-naked?” I didn’t look at him, focusing on making my way to the table.
“Be nice,” Harry chided. “You’re both important to me, you and the Weasleys. I want you both to get along.”
“It might take a while,” Harry said, “though Hermione told me they bumped it up to the highest priority when they failed to find Cross’ body in the wreckage.”
“Yes.” Draco jerked his head away from Fletcher. “You won’t find any reason to regret this.”
“I was trying to get information out of him,” Draco said. “That was why I didn’t plan on being too rough, Though I have to admit, your unexpected appearance added a healthy dose of terror that was more helpful than I thought it would.”
I looked at the book-key with its unassuming appearance. Only Slytherin’s brood were able to activate it – perhaps it recognized the blood in me.
“It failed, obviously,” Harry said, with a mimicry of a smile. “And I was wounded in that attempt. It had been close, but I was overconfident, and I had gotten hurt almost as badly as Riddle was.”
It was slightly displeasing for Draco that Fletcher mistook him as one of these scraps, however. Pressed suits and soft hands didn’t necessarily mean a soft man; Draco wondered if this experience would impress that lesson on Fletcher.
“You know I can’t do these things on the spot, right? I need a lab and specialized equipment— “
I swallowed. Reading between the lines, what made them more terrifying than the Death Eaters was their coordination and unity. The Death Eaters were dangerous, but they -- we -- had been a fractious group, held together only by the Dark Lord. This Circle, though … it reeked of something far older and expansive. According to this article, they were also deeply emmeshed in Wizarding society, to the extent that removal would need to be slow and surgical. Any mass action would result likely in destabilization and mass chaos. Yet like the hydra, I had no doubt that as soon as one cell was destroyed, another would take its place.
Harry stared. “What is that?”
“What do you suggest then?”
Already done. You need to be careful. We are in the middle of Covent Garden now, and friendly fire is a higher danger here.
“He still might know something,” Potter said, not conceding the point, but not pressing it.
I gripped my wand, aware of how exposed we were. Though all of us had threw up Disillusionment charm, and hid behind the white fence, it was still easy to spot us if one knew what they were looking for. Not to mention if there were any detection spells that Granger’s team had failed to disable.
“When I heard about your father being involved – I hadn’t known. I thought – I thought –”
“Is there any way you can direct the light further away?” Draco asked. His voice sounded calm. Collected. It was a reasonable request.
Draco shuddered. “Well, size isn’t everything.”
“It’s just a little lightning,” I said. I raised my wand, tying him up in neat knots. “I dated the instructor for the London Dueling Club for a few weeks. He taught me this spell. It’s more flash than practical, but,” I shrugged.
“Be careful,” Dolohov warned. “He’s a crafty son of a bitch, that one.”
But at the moment, he had more pressing matters to attend. A woman who had remained still as stone now rose.
“And here I was careful to use a low dosage,” Malfoy said, with a faint trace of amusement. “Though I would have to agree with you there. This drug isn’t one that anybody should take.”
Something about what Luna said stuck with me. Even as I walked out of the Leaky into Muggle London after cheerfully seeing Luna off to the Magical Menagerie on the way, her words struck a chord.
Locating the crank Riddle mentioned, Draco stared at it. He tried to dredge up the information Rosier had postulated or discovered. Its calculations were related to various astronomical signs and phenomena. Would he need to ‘reset’ the Decoder? Draco wasn’t sure he knew how. He was an archaeologist and historian, not an engineer. He said so to Riddle.
And was met with air as I was stopped halfway. There was an invisible barrier around the bed that blocked me from leaving.
“Who is your master?” Draco asked. “What else do you want from me?” He narrowed his eyes. “Was this just all a trap to lure us out here?” It was awful to think that he was the reason he and Harry were captured.
“Master, are you sure about the Malfoy boy being connected to the Grimoire?” he asked, in a respectful tone. “With all due respect, he does not seem like someone who would aid us in our goals. Particularly since he betrayed his last master.”
“Actually … I was wondering if Draco wants to come. You’re always welcome too, Harry, but I thought you needed to be at the office today.”
“Yessir.”
That was a bit of disconcerting information. I couldn’t imagine Potter and my mother being pen pals any more than I could imagine a centaur dancing with a goblin. “She’s well. Nagging as usual, but that’s mothers for you.”
“Elixir?” The manager’s face contorted. “But we’re a respectable building – we don’t have that sort here. We screen our prospective tenants before we let any flat; you can check the records –”
Potter chuckled at that. “No, I suppose you’re right. Still, it can’t be easy living with that all your life.” It explained how you are the way you are, I could hear him think.
What happened? Harry squinted. His vision showed a blurry ceiling with delicate motif moldings and a rather extravagant chandelier with crystals dangling from its many arms.
Even to this day I missed him. He had protected me, in his own way, when my family had fallen into disfavor, his acidic words and his cold presence fending off harassment from the others who relished at our disgrace. I had gone to his portrait after that last battle at Hogwarts. To apologize … to confess … to mourn. He had looked upon me with an uncharacteristic softness, extracting from me a promise to live with my head raised.
He hovered over me, looming like an overgrown bat. Even though it had been my plan to lure him out and question him, I still had a thrill of danger run through me. Yet I was not afraid. It was strangely anticipatory, and I found myself eager for this confrontation.
“I’m not letting you take this,” Draco said, moving in front of the Decoder, as though shielding it from their view would protect it from being taken. Theo, Draco noticed out of the corner of his eye, had discreetly backed away from the deck railing. Harry was less than a foot away from his gun, but he didn’t move, likely out of fear that it would catch Dolohov and Bellatrix’s attention.
Harry realized he had stopped in the middle of the hallway for a split second. He always forget that conversing with an SI looked odd to outsiders; all they could see was him making faces without context.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked, climbing into the seat beside him.
“What is it?” Shacklebolt asked. “You typically don’t come into my office for anything unless I call for you.”
“I assume you’re filling in the Weasel too –”
It was a chilling thought. If the Dark Lord had found it ... the one who was capable of splitting his own soul. And the Circle thought this man could be used.
There was no other choice. Either Harry ducked and weaved and risked getting hit, or he could return fire but prolong the chase. It was a pity the wand as a weapon could not handle rapid changes in the bolt’s caliber.
She always did have a flair for the dramatic, Riddle mused. Perhaps it would be helpful his time around too.
Hell, from the ensuing boom that followed, it could have been artillery. Draco prayed to whatever deity watching above that they weren’t about to be caught in a firefight between Coalition and Taliban forces.
Draco considered his answer. It was easier to focus on an academic debate than it was to think about Harry.
Malfoy snorted.
This time, when they kissed again, Malfoy sucking on Harry’s tongue, Harry allowed himself to be taken over by raw sensation. He wanted to do much more than just lie there, wanted to touch Malfoy everywhere.
Malfoy shrugged. “I probably designed half of those. And my scanners are better. More than good. As you will soon find out if you ever decide to tell me what the issue you want to consult me on is.”
Harry sneered. “I’m not afraid of you, you overgrown piece of — oof!”
Harry’s body was on fire. He ripped off his tie, pulled at the buttons of his shirt. The cool air hitting his skin only provided momentary relief as Malfoy continued.
It was old – I knew this even at a glance. Yellowed with the years, the leather bindings looked worn to the point of decomposition, the pages crisp and flaking off in parts. There was a strange buzz in my ears, and a hum across my skin, the hairs on my arm rising, as my entire body seemed to react to this book. I reached out to touch it –
“Money is of no matter,” Riddle said. “My patience, on the other hand, is.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Instead of smoothing it, it seemed to have left it even messier. “No, it’s alright. It’s best to get this over with.”
“Go away, Blaise. I don’t want to repeat myself again.”
A howl of alarm broke the relative stillness. Ignoring the bleeding cuts from the glass, Draco grabbed the flashlight, bypassing the extinguisher. He debated for a moment whether to take it. If need be, it could be used as a blunt, one-time weapon in a fight.
I looked around. Sprawled around me was a moat of papers and books, some piled precariously in a mound that threatened to topple over at the slightest whisper. Thankfully, no one sat near, scared away by this mess and my glares and the knowledge of who I am.
“Yeah, like that time you had to get old Slughorn to give you that memory.”
Potter nodded. His face was still flushed. It was ruddy with excitement. “I miss this. The rush, the adrenaline. Capturing bad guys.”
“I bet Harry feels ‘well-handled’ right now.” The Weasley winked at me. I resisted the urge to toss a pillow at him.
If he closed his eyes, Draco might have mistaken himself to be on the field of battle, with the roar of the warriors and the scream of the swords. Then, as quickly, that sensation disappeared, replaced by an equally vivid one of revelry, of oboes and harps and the unmistakable murmurs of intimacy, followed by the rustling of crops and the baying of sheep.
“Thank you for dinner,” Draco said as they waited in the carpark for a taxi. The night had deepened until the sky was a swath of black with smears of light from the city. It was decidedly cold now, and Draco, lit by the warmth of good company and cuisine, didn’t want to extinguish it by walking. “I would normally suggest drinks and clubbing at Heaven, but it seems too late.” He smiled ruefully. “I think I’m getting old.”
Draco forced himself to take in a deep breath. Perhaps it was time to learn more about the Shield the old-fashion way: by consulting with an expert. Not a historian or an archaeologist specializing in objects from that era, but someone who knew and understood the murkier world of conspiracy theories and was less skeptical about the correlation between legends and reality.
“Can I ask you something personal?” Potter swirled his wine. “Why history, if you’re so afraid of the past? And why history of the dark arts? Doesn’t that field especially make it impossible to escape?”
Draco wasn’t surprised that Theo knew of the Antikythera Mechanism. His job was ferrying divers and would-be treasure hunters after all. Draco nodded. “We found a reference to a possible prototype in a colleague’s papers, and it led us here.”
“Great.” Potter stood up. “Let’s go.”
Besides, I was tired of my flat. It was tiresome to wander from the bedroom to the kitchen to the living room whenever I needed to stretch my legs. Not to mention I had been practicing my dueling; the pillow on my couch bore evidence of that.
It probably didn’t extend to hiding them in someone else’s house, Draco thought, but that was the least of his worries.
Draco took a sip of his coffee before it went cold. It would make sense, then, to explain what the Shield did when he was examining it.
“I’m actually doing more research with old artefacts now,” I said. I took another bite. My father could not have waited until at least the main course to start. I should have started drinking before I came. “That’s part of the reason why I’m here. There are some records in the Manor Library that I wanted to go over. I think they have clues to my next project.”
Harry told himself that making any rude gestures would be unprofessional and unbecoming of a Commander of the Auror Force.
“Oh. But what about the investigation? It’s a serious charge this time, and it isn’t something that his lawyers can brush away or his cronies can cover for him.”
“Really? Not even to try casting your horoscope to find your soulmate?”
Looking at him lying in his bed, even though he appeared to be in good spirits, made me feel even worse.
The Auror Force was formed when it was deemed that the ordinary Law Enforcement Agency was no longer capable of handling the more specialized operations that dealt with crimes concerning information and national security. Cybercrime, counterintelligence, and extremist activity were all within the purview of the Aurors. Elixir was a special case – it was theoretically under a joint task force between Law Enforcement and the Aurors. However, because of interagency fighting and the lack of funds, investigating the supply of Elixir gradually became the responsibility of the Aurors.
Cross’s amusement did not diminish; rather, his smirk stretched wider until it cartoonishly encompassed his entire face. “I hope you would have a better opinion of me. I’m nothing so crude.” He gave a dramatic sigh. “It must be a remnant your time with Voldemort. He was always so unsophisticated in his methods.”
It never came.
I slapped his hand as he moved to fidget at it. “Don’t pull at it! Or I’ll have to redo it. And we’re going to be late. And no, we’re not. We’re just friends. And occasionally roll around naked together.”
Draco crawled into bed. It was warmer than he expected and the mattress firm. He laid down and thought about Harry, about the events of the past week.
Thankfully, Mother had a repertoire of small talk refined over years of entertaining that managed to put Potter at ease. She broached the silence with a genial question asking Potter how his day was. He responded by launching into a description of what he did today at the office. I half-listened, half poked at my tuna crudo.
Fletcher appeared conflicted. Clearly something Harry said had struck the right chord. Draco thought Harry was better at this than he had expected.
I looked at Harry. “What do you think?”
The pages flipped in a soft whisper, like a million indistinct voices were in hushed conversation. I closed my eyes, willing it to take me away.
He was angry. Both at Harry and at the circumstances which had placed them at odds. It was a position which could have been resolved by a simple ten-minute chat, and yet it had dragged on for five long years.
Harry left before waiting for a dismissal. He itched for hot water and the freedom out of his suit.
“So what happened?” Harry asked. “If you changed your mind and feel uncomfortable, I won’t ask.”
“What would you have done if he weren’t?”
Harry took it tentatively. It was warm. “Harry.”
The mention of Harry seemed to have shocked Fletcher back into cooperativeness. “Yes, yes. You are a very intelligent young man, Mr. Malfoy. I would be happy to help you. However, in my line of business, trust is everything, and confidentiality is of the strictest importance.”
“I had,” Riddle said. “But the delay would have taken too long to find another expert to decipher the Decoder. Wormtail,” here he gave Wormtail a glare, “failed to find any other who would be able to assist us in breaking the encryption.”
We walked in silence, the soft noises of the night – the hooting owls, the scratch of racoons – only serving to highlight it.
“He is the last living descendant with Slytherin blood,” spoke a voice from the armchair. It was a mellifluous baritone, one that lulled a feeling of soporific calm. “The key will react to blood.”
“You would have,” I said softly. “Because if there’s anything I’ve learned about you over the years, it’s that you would done what you felt was right. No matter what anyone said.”
Shacklebolt sighed. “Never mind that. What can you tell me about this latest bust? Not what the reports will say, but your impressions of it.”
The hallway was deserted and dusty. It reminded me in a way of the disused corridors of the Manor, with its air of dilapidated neglect. Unlike the Manor, this lacked the grandeur of bygone days. Thick carpet lined the floor and faded wallpaper covered the walls.
“They shouldn’t be here like this,” Draco hissed. “It’s sacrilegious to treat humanity’s cultural treasure like this, like they’re trash someone picked up from the ground.”
“Let’s go,” I said, holding my wand out at the ready.
He turned to face a gaping Draco. Harry had not changed much in all these years. Even with so much time past, the mere sight of him still left Draco’s knees weak – though this time, it was from a heady potion of anger and pain rather than desire. But that was in the mix too, an unwelcome heat rising from his belly, the urge to touch Harry again.
The Shield of Achilles was mentioned in the Iliad, and one of the theory for the Antikythera Mechanism's origin is that it was based on an earlier prototype, perhaps from the island of Rhodes. There's been a lot of articles and even documentaries made on the Antikythera Mechanism. If you want to see the device in person, most of the fragments are held in the National Archaeology  Museum in Athens, Greece.
“That’s very interesting, Draco, but that isn’t what my master wants to know. He doesn’t care for the historical background or the intricacies of the art. What he would want to know is how to activate that power you felt earlier.”
And no matter how time seemed suspended right now in a state of sybaritic ease, the ocean could easily turn on them. From gentle swell into raging tempest.
“What if the Shield did have these clairvoyant properties?”
“It’ll be fascinating to examine it though,” Granger said, voicing some of my desires. “To see what Slytherin himself wrote in it. It’s a pity that Voldemort turned most of the Founder’s Objects into Horcruxes, or otherwise we could have looked at them in greater detail.”
At the same time, a ladder unfurled from the helicopter. Bellatrix took hold of it with the dexterity of a trapeze artist. The helicopter flew up, lifting her into the sky. She wore a triumphant grin that stretched like a slit from ear to ear.
“That’s … quite a bust,” Malfoy murmured, the mockery in his voice gone.
“Same.” Harry looked up at the castle. “My godson will be starting here soon. Can you imagine? I was there when he got the letter. I had never felt so old.”
Draco strove to prevent himself from surging forward. It was whole, intact, and completely undamaged. The device was circular and flat, almost like a disc, but with intricate clockwork gears. It was wholly constructed of bronze, silver, and gold, though why it remained so durable was beyond Draco. There were small notches on the side, with clear writing that was too small to read clearly even with the camera’s aid.
“I do.” We were in what appeared to be a spare bedroom, the bed pushed to one side, the pillows laid out around us to break our fall. They had not yet managed to be of use yet. “It’s hopeless.” I had agreed to Potter’s training in the hopes it would take my mind off being stuck in the house, but all it did was make me more anxious. “I think I’m better off studying ways to break the protection spells on the book-key. Are you sure you think it’s not safe to leave the house?”
“He has proven as lucky as ever,” the woman replied without a flinch. Her face caught the city lights sliding through the floor-to-ceiling windows. She had thick black hair and deeply hooded eyes, and would have been considered a great beauty once, were she not reduced to a gaunt and skeletal appearance.
He moved away, with a small pop sounding. He reached out and a small vial flew into his hand from his duffle.
Draco only nodded. His body was still numb.
Harry eyed those with an expression one usually reserved for trips to the dentist. “Better you than me.”
“Same.” Potter waved his wand and the room rearranged itself back. “I’ll see you later at dinner.”
The puff of breath hit Harry’s nose, and he responded with the only way he could think of – by lunging up and kissing Malfoy.
“We’re being squeezed into this half-life of scurrying around like rats, Potter.” My father didn’t bother hiding his contempt in his voice. “Aren’t Gryffindors meant to be brave? Instead of running around scared?”
The window tinted to darkness and a three-dimensional display came to life over the bed.
Harry hushed him with one hand over Draco’s mouth.
“Say, isn’t that the Minister?”
Surrounded by his warm arms, I was certain everything would be.
“No!” The word tore out of Harry’s throat. “He’s using you! Don’t you see that? He’ll toss you aside as soon as you’re not useful anymore.”
“Yes, mother. Harry told me he particularly enjoys Nandos.”
Granger handed him a gun. “So first you –”
“Well, it’s not exactly that. Harry’s an orphan, but the people we’re visiting – they’re the closest he has to a family – they don’t get along with my family. And my father – well – “
“You know why I was out of sorts,” Draco snapped. His sense of aggrievement, combined with what he had just learned, lashed out. “I know all of you think we’re just a family of crooks and you’re waiting for us to fuck up. So spare me the false pity and fuck off.”
“What can I do for you today?” I asked, affecting a cheery tone that contrasted with how I felt. “I’m not aware of any Reading Room rules being broken.”
“I’m sure I’ll manage,” Draco said. Really, Fletcher’s proximity was giving Draco a headache. “You don’t need to worry about being paid.”
“What?”
“And if I don’t.”
“Mr. Malfoy is here already. It is an act of providence that he was sent to us. We can begin our preparations tonight.” Riddle looked at Draco. “Any equipment you need will be provided to you. You would be surprised at how well-stocked we are.”
Harry noticed. “You’d like that, don’t you? Letting me have my way with you, do whatever I like?” He shifted up, his bulge direct in my face.
“What do we do now?” Draco asked. “Please tell me you know how to get out of here.”
It made no difference; it was my flat. And Blaise had seen all this anyways.
A loud clatter echoed. I winced. There was a strict no noise policy in the Reading Room, and heads were already turning to stare at me.
Shacklebolt shook his head. “We’re not sending you into the field per se; you’ll be staying at the forward operating base, where you’ll be relatively safe. If you have any equipment you can bring with you – books, laptop, a magnifying glass – feel free to do so.”
“Nothing?”
“You don’t need me,” I said, finally. “Or the Grimoire. In fact, it sounds like we’re both extraneous to your plans. Why don’t you just leave me and the Grimoire in peace? If there’s anything of note, you can read about it in the next edition of the Magical Histories Journal.”
“I think that’s all.” Draco glanced at Harry. “You?”
I scowled. He didn’t need to rub it in that my last sexual encounter was months ago, and my last meaningful relationship even longer ago.
“What do you mean, different?”
Then righted itself. A secondary propulsor stabilized the car, and it continued, at the same pace before Harry had shot at it.
“If I give you my sources, will you leave me alone?” he asked finally.
I threw the soiled shirt onto the bed. It made an unsatisfying noise. It was time for dinner. Though usually taking place in the kitchen and being a casual affair, I suddenly had an urge to impress Potter.
Their limbs twined. Harry’s nails scraped Draco’s back. Harry was in need of manicure, but Draco decided it could wait. It felt good. So did Harry’s shirt against his bare skin.
I shook my head. It could wait until tomorrow.
“Wow. Thanks.” I was at a loss for words. “They’re beautiful. Thank you.”
There was a small chime at the fireplace, and a delicate cough.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked. “Why are you here?”
“Where were you?” I asked.
Harry frowned. “What do you mean? I don’t have clearance to access the man’s file?”
Draco deflated, too drained to continue arguing. “I’ll stay. But only because of the archaeological importance of the object and to find out what really happened with my father’s death.”
“You’re a fucking idiot,” Draco told Harry. “If any part of your plan had gone wrong….” The consequences were unimaginable.
We broke for air, and he looked at me, his eyes lidded.
“I’m a magical historian,” I said, rather sniffily. “Of course I’m upset. In addition to the whole murder and ripping your soul affair, of course.”
“It’s done now,” Harry said. His face was shuttered. Draco knew he was still thinking of his own failures too. “There’s nothing we can do about it now.”
In response, a jet of green light arced over our heads, hitting the shelf across from us. It burst into green flames.
I would have to write to McGonagall for her permission to visit the school.
“Did they tell you who they are?”
Malfoy pulled up his sleeve. There was a nasty gash that in certain light could be mistaken as a tattoo of a serpent and a skull, but Harry didn’t miss the small puncture marks around it. “As a matter of fact, I do.”
Blaise had readily agreed when Draco told him he needed to take a trip with Harry to Greece.
“Sorry.”
“I see why you dressed up now,” he whispered to me.
“Well, if you believe the myths, it was a gift from the gods. So it probably would have powers, though not in the way one would think about it in this age of Dungeons and Dragons.” She smiled gently. “It would be much more subtle.”
“I take it that is the code?” Riddle’s voice shook Draco out of the reverie.
“Have you ever seen my father in jeans and a t-shirt?” I asked rather snidely. “No, don’t answer that.” I knew the answer, and frankly, it must be difficult for Potter to return to a site where there was nothing but dark memories. “Besides, you can dress however you like. You’re the Chosen One after all.”
“Oh. Well, they don’t look like it.”
“What if they ruin the sites?”
“No, no. Just tell me now.”
Draco chased. He landed in crouch, ignoring the concrete plant box cutting against his shins. He pushed off his heels — the intruders moved at a much faster clip than Draco expected, and they had the advantage of a head start.
Harry stared. “What?”
Shacklebolt sighed. “Yes. Unfortunately. Why else do you think we joined the Elixir task force? It’s growing to be a real problem. But it’s not a phenomenon that more diligent policing can solve. You know that too.”
Heat filled the room, so rapidly and with such intensity that I choked, the air in my lung burning out for a second.
Draco was at a loss for words. What could he say to that? Anger burned – it was Harry, all along, that orchestrated this. He was the one who gave Shacklebolt the suggestion to bring Draco to this miserable place.
Harry took a cautious step out. Then another. And another.
Then I opened my eyes.
Even when discussing such trivial subjects, Draco had learned a few facts about Harry since their separation. Like how he had been stationed here long enough to familiarize himself with the local languages and climate, or that he seemed like he genuinely loved the place.
Though he did look on the verge of apoplexy right now.
“Are you going to tell me it’s plebeian for Malfoys to get cold now?” Harry asked with amusement.
“What about the people they interacted with?” Harry asked. “Anything there?”
I moved cautiously towards him, Potter following in my wake.
We had been engaged once, bonding over our shared rejection of our parents’ ideals. It had been a commitment of convenience, Astoria being in love with a man completely unsuitable for her family and me having a fondness of cock too powerful to overcome. But then her beau had made a name of herself and she had apologetically though firmly tossed me aside. I couldn’t find it in me to begrudge her that — someone deserved an opportunity to be happy.
“Well, you’re alright to have as backup in a fight, though your form is terrible,” Harry said with a slight smile. “But in any case, I don’t think it will do much good until we’ve both recovered a bit.”
Quickly, Potter and I filled them in on what transpired at the Manor, Potter punctuating the story with some colorful language. The Weasley listened, his brows knitted in puzzlement as Granger’s face deepened in concern.
It shocked Draco to admit to himself. For him to be so open about his own emotions was a foreign mindset, one that fitted him like a pair of overly snug shoes.
I studied it through watering eyes. “I’m glad it isn’t. We’d be dead if it were. Not that this is something we can warm our hands with.”
“No. Have you?”
“I suppose not. Those kinds of problems are far too pedestrian for me. Any third-rate hack can do that. Anyways, what’s this problem you have for me then?”
“Well.” Theo didn’t seem to know how to respond to that. “You at least know how to swim, right?” He laughed as Draco gave him an annoyed look.
Finally, Harry said, “Let me indulge my curiosity. I promise you: if I don’t find anything suspicious in three days, I’ll close the case.”
jewelry, coins. Some of them still were relatively intact, and Draco wanted to take them in hand and examine them.
“I don’t know how to order Muggle take-out,” I said. “Besides, I don’t have a Muggle bank account.”
I agree, Hedwig said silently.
She paused, then raised her wand and casted a quick Muffliato. The irritating buzzing filled my ear as she looked at me. “What do you know about this group?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco said, but he smiled. “I was going to just point out I can handle a short walk. We are almost there, aren’t we?”
“I’ll go,” Granger volunteered. She got up.
“Language, Draco. And I thought you were a proper gentleman. I felt what you did too, and I certainly did not suffer from heatstroke. From what our experts divulged to us before Lucius stole the information, the inscription on that Shield is a code, and unlocking that code will unleash the Shield’s true potential.”
I gritted my teeth, forcing myself to stand through the haze of pain.
I took it, looking over for any signs of damage. It was remarkably well-preserved for a book that lived in the damp for the last thousand years. Likely, there were spells on it that preserved it against time.
“I added some gin to it,” Potter said. “It’ll help take some of the edge off.”
“So I’ve been told already,” Draco agreed. Harry turned his laughter into a quick cough at Dawlish’s face turning puce.
“You’re going to catch something if you stay out here longer.”
“Oh! That reminds me. They need to be filled in triplicate now!” Harry called after him. Finnegan gave him the finger from a distance.
Draco kicked the rock. Damnit.
This book I saw in my vision – it must be Slytherin’s Grimoire. My breath came in hitches. It had to be. The admittedly scant signs all pointed to the book in the vision being the Grimoire, and what I had in my possession the key to finding it.
“No.” And Draco wasn’t. He was agitated, yes, but from the anticipation, and he could barely control his nerves, but he wasn’t frightened. Strangely, the knowledge that he should be, that danger lurked, only made him more eager. “I’m excited. This is the first time I’ve done any thing substantive in a long time.”
“I’ve never actually read Catcher in the Rye,” Draco said. He sniffed.  “I hate American literature. So tedious. Always going on and on about something angst related to the human condition.”
Draco shouldn’t have been irritated that somehow, he had been the one to pay for dinner. There were much bigger issues than professional courtesy at stake here.
“Not yet. Right now, we need to ask my father some questions.”
Both Potter and Granger turned at the sound, like they had forgotten my presence.
“Thank you,” Harry said quietly.
“I assumed you met my staff,” the man continued, as though he was in the midst of a guided tour for the office. “Bellatrix, Dolohov, and Wormtail. I am Tom Riddle, though you may know me by my call sign Voldemort. Welcome to my office.”
Blaise scowled, tossing it on the counter. The leather slapped against the surface.
“I did too,” I admitted reluctantly. “What are you saying?”
One man rose to his feet. He was a tall Black man, bald. There was a spark of gold from a single hoop earring.
“You’re just stating the obvious now,” I said. I knew I was being deliberately difficult, but I knew no other way to face this conversation.
Especially a madman with delusions of world domination.
“Oh?” Luna raised an eyebrow. “I thought you said that my research often veered into the ‘fanciful suppositions with no realistic backing.’”
Had he made a mistake? It was possible, given the circumstances Draco had worked under. The Shield was quiescent now in his hands, nothing out of the ordinary. It was simply a very old antique.
Harry grinned. “I think that will.”
“Maybe that can be your next expedition,” Harry teased. “Finding Atlantis.”
“Then it’s settled. Harry will keep you safe while I try to figure out what our friend and his group wants.”
“I haven’t, either. It’ll be an interesting job, that’s for certain, but I’m not sure if I can handle it.”
“That’s the one.”
He was brought out spitting with rage and disbelief; Draco watched as they spirited him away in an armored van.
“Sir,” Finnegan said, “we did discuss the possibility of the Department of Mysteries’ cyber defenses being better than ours. Maybe this is a sign that we should just return the file to them and continue with our work.”
The first thing Draco did upon stepping inside was sneeze.
I gave his assistant my most dazzling smile, the kind that charmed both my mother’s cantankerous dowager friends and partners at the bars alike.
“Good.” Slytherin looked unseeingly at the lake. The setting sun lit the surface on fire, a fierce orange blaze that reflected off the water. “I will also need to task you with another matter, my friend.”
Goyle snorted. “Well, I can’t say much, but it sure doesn’t look comfortable to me. But I know how you like a hard thing under your arse.”
“Well, they are, in a way. These figures have become so engrained in our culture that their historicity doesn’t really matter anymore. Sometimes, belief is all that makes a difference. If people are willing to buy and kill for the shield that purportedly belonged to Achilles, then the object is real enough to be taken seriously. And who’s to know what happened thousands of years ago? Maybe there was a warrior named Achilles and he did have a lover named Patroclus a long time ago.”
Professor Rosier, of Durham University, Department of Classics and Ancient History. Draco frowned. It was odd that the results turned up news clippings and past academic writings but not the faculty page.
“I don’t know how you’re able to drink it without milk or sugar,” Blaise said, making a face as I downed my coffee. “It’s unnatural.”
“Yes.” Harry felt the bandaged wound on Draco’s shoulder. “Does it hurt?”
Malfoy laughed. “You really don’t think a person like me would be the generous, civic-minded type, do you? I assume you’ve read my files before you came. Or maybe you didn’t. Not that it’s my place to comment on the intelligence of our vaunted Auror force.”
The reality of his situation sunk in. Draco glared at Dolohov. “I’m not going help you.”
“Come out, Malfoy,” the discordant grating voice rang in the space. “Having Potter here won’t help you. Pity he had to be here tonight. I wasn’t in the mood to kill, but I can’t have any witnesses.”
“No.” Draco shook his head. There was too much bad blood there. Draco didn’t think he could ever walk past the porticoed façade without that burn of anger. “I have a research question actually.”
“Listen here, you little –”
“Draco,” Harry hissed. “Don’t listen to him. They just want to use you.”
They were visitors to an entirely different world that existed here, under the waves, the realm of Poseidon. It was here that Aegeus, king of Athens and father of the legendary Theseus, drowned himself in grief when he mistakenly thought his son had been killed by the Minotaur.
“It’s usually me who do this sort of thing,” Draco remarked once they were ensconced in a secluded area slightly to the side. It didn’t offer the best view of the windows, but it was remarkably private, quiet enough that one were able to hold an intimate conversation. “Barge into restaurants and demand to be seated, I mean.”
“I think your plan is good,” Harry said, breaking the silence. “But don’t be reckless, okay? Riddle is dangerous, and he has more resources at his disposal than entire governments. We need to approach this carefully. And yes, I mean we.” He looked at his wine. “I’m not leaving you on your own to do this.”
Potter grabbed the man by the collar. “Tell us what we want to know.” He hauled the man up to his feet roughly. He stared back at Potter in cool contempt. Despite myself, I had to admire his composure. Not many could keep it under this circumstance.
Horror stomped on Draco’s insides. “He already left. He’s walking into a trap.”
Then again, that would have risked our anonymity.
“Alright.” Maybe Draco should relax and give this a try. After all, it might be fun, and even illustrative. If Rorschach tests were useful, why couldn’t this be? They were both ink on paper.
I raised a Shield reflexively. And felt the heat of his spell hammer at it with a heavy impact that had me winded and taking a step back.
This was what he wanted: the thrill, the chase, the tightening nerves. He loved this part of his work, far more than the politicking and the paperwork. Sometimes he wished he had remained in the rank and file so that he could be in the field, instead of passing his boards.
And Harry might get shipped off for another deployment.
Blaise laughed. “Glad you like it. I don’t want your first drink down here to be dull as water.”
Potter poured out a cup and held it to me. “Drink,” he said sternly.
Three-point-four to be precise.
“Nah.” Theo waved his hand. “I haven’t heard from this one until two days ago when he called out of the blue asking for a boat. ‘It’s a good thing you picked the off-season’, I told him, since it’s still kind of cold this time of year.” He gave them both a look. “This isn’t some exotic vacation you two have planned, is it?”
He must be insane; Draco had stolen a military vehicle and was running blindly into danger.
As the smell of smoke vanished, I looked around and saw that we were in a spacious but dusty room. I sneezed. My olfactory senses overloaded with odors that I was unable to differentiate. It was dim, with faint rustling amongst the curtains like a flutter of moths lived inside. A chandelier dripping with crystals but only one candle hung from the high vaulted ceiling.
They weren’t ordinary burglars. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather spread across his chest. What had his father gotten himself involved in? Even his death didn’t end this quagmire he had brought upon himself.
“It’s real?” Despite the dire straits they were in, Draco’s pulse quickened for a different reason. The idea at finding the fabled Shield of Achilles…. “Are you sure?”
“I knew it was too easy,” he muttered.
“Be careful, Draco!” My father’s bark coincided with a painful bump at my hips. I steadied the table just in time before any plates fell.
Draco ignored Harry’s proffered hand. He had half a mind to stand up and stalk out of the room, but it was pleasant to be sitting with enough room to stretch his legs after spending so long on a cramped military plane.
Hedwig, can we disable the car? In case we don’t reach it in time.
“What the hell is this?” Draco managed finally, his voice a rasp of disbelief and tiredness. “What the hell are you doing here?”
Riddle gazed at the two objects in front of him.
Draco had scowled but didn’t bother enlightening Blaise otherwise. Blaise was a good friend but there was no point in burdening him needlessly with secrets. He was glad that Blaise had access to his stepfather’s jet, though. Draco had never met the man, but this sort of generosity was endearing, at least to Draco.
“That’s for making us worry,” he said. His voice was deeper than I remembered, and he was taller too. “Running off to Malfoy Manor like that – what the hell were you thinking?” Then he caught sight of me. “Malfoy.”
He led me to a private room in the Leaky Cauldron. A number of our friends were already there: Granger, Weasley, Goyle, Blaise, Millicent. Luna and her husband sat in the love seat in the corner, in conference with a strained looking Pansy. I hid a smile.
“No.” Harry made a split second decision. “This needs to be discreet. We can’t bring any more men into this or it’ll attract attention. You and I will need to do this ourselves.”
The Weasley took Granger by the arm and thankfully pulled her away from me. “He said he’s fine.” He gave me a look of the deepest suspicion and I had to stifle my smile at that. It was almost comical.
The raid ended with them capturing most of the men inside the cave, including a Greyback that was still unconscious when a platoon led by Harry went in to scour the remnants.
There was a groan and a stir from the floor. Potter stood up and banged into the sofa. He stumbled to the side and bumped his shin on the end table. Jerking back, he straightened up, crossed his arms, and stared at me.
“Hallo, Malfoy. I brought a bottle for your parents,” Potter’s voice came from the living room. “I know it’s a business call, but it can’t hurt, can it?”
The man tried again, his hand coming down in an arc –
“They’re not from me,” Harry said. “They’re from your aunt.”
I gave a strangled laugh. “This does make it more interesting.”
“I need to be in London for work,” I said. “Most of the libraries and the resources are there. It’s simpler that way.” I wanted to stab myself with my fork. This conversation reminded me why I limited exposure to the Manor as much as I could. I took a sip of Potter’s wine. It burned pleasantly down my throat.
Draco ignored him. He ran up to the car. “I need to borrow this,” he shouted. “It’s life or death.”
Potter laughed. “Explains why you showed up soused. How is she? Ron’s back from the States. Bet she’s excited for that.”
“The serpent is a symbol of Slytherin’s. The ouroboros is a symbol of infinity. Slytherin recorded all of his magic in there, all his knowledge, and created the Blood Circle to defend both the book and his ideals of a pure world.”
Draco saw with a glance that these men worked for the government. And not the usual bureaucrats, either; these two had an air of efficiency and hardness. Draco searched their faces: they betrayed nothing.
“Yes,” Slytherin said, his voice in a whisper as he turned to look upon the castle, what must be the culmination of his life’s work. “But hopefully, I give to you the seeds with which the injustice can be rectified.”
“Draco! What do we do?”
Draco swallowed, suddenly uncertain. What was he doing? It was like he was on a car careening out of control, and the exhilaration, the trill of the speed was only a temporary excitement before he crashed.
He was holding a mug decorated with ‘I Love London’ on it, his face opened in surprise as he took in what must be the ridiculous sight of me in crumpled robes and smelling strongly of scotch.
“There you go.” Malfoy plucked the glass out of Harry’s hand, drained it. “Ah … you made this weaker than usual, Tom.”
They had been at the office for hours now. Harry’s eyes were blurry with fatigue from staring at the screen and, next to him, Finnegan let out a loud yawn.
“You should stay in bed,” Potter said with a frown.
The console beeped.
Draco seethed. Though he agreed with her sentiment, it was clear from her tone that she did not include Draco in her statement.
I turned to look at him again. “When do you think the Ministry will finish examining the Grimoire?”
Harry supposed it was natural that men like McLaggen, hot-blooded and eager for recognition, were drawn to this branch of the National Security Department. He couldn’t imagine McLaggen as an Unspeakable working in the Department of Mysteries, unable to boast of even the smallest success. It would be a special hell for him, Harry reflected with grim humor.
“No.” Harry shuffled into a more comfortable position. Draco could sympathize. They had tied the ropes tight; it cut into his skin, the fibers burning raw whenever Draco moved. At least they didn’t gag him and Harry, but that indicated their location was too far away from any help.
They arrived at the Manor in Harry’s car, Harry deciding it was much more secure to use that mode of transportation than taking the train.
“No, it’s fine.” I smiled gamely at him. “I don’t think we can avoid it, us being who we are. I mean … we’ve known each other for how long now? Almost two decades.”
“So you see, I don’t intend on dying here,” Harry said. “Nor do I intend on letting them take you with them.”
We Disapparated once we were far enough from the Manor’s protective charms. I was numb, deadened even to its hurtling sensation.
“This wand is specially designed to blend in urban environments and made specifically to counter people … well, people like you.” Malfoy waved at Harry. “People with the advantage of biomechanical enhancements and Sentient Intelligence connections. Whoever made it won’t be that easy to find, especially for Aurors. You understand the implication of what I’m telling you?”
Harry, encouraged by this reaction, increased his pressure. His hand moved up. He didn’t even know why – a whim, a desire propelled him to do so. He waited for Malfoy to bat him away.
“That’s not the point, Draco! What would people think? No Malfoy has been caught in a compromising situation like this since the 1950s.”
He laughed. “No, thank you. I have a thick head, but I don’t think having a pillow thrown at me is high on a list of things I fancy.”
He was gratified to see the gleam in her eyes. That was one thing he could always count on about her. She always anticipated his needs.
A clarity came over him, one that told him he had made the right decision. Draco would see this through, in his own way.
“You seemed to, too,” I said, “back at the flat.” I treaded lightly, my steps barely registering.
It was odd, to experience that while Draco was standing in an ordinary room – albeit one with well-furnished equipment – and it was uncomfortable, like crossing his eyes. Riddle was fixated, his face enraptured by excitement and eagerness that bordered on the obscene.
“Don’t talk about my father like that,” Draco snapped.
Riddle laughed, a hair-raising, high-pitched sound that clawed at Draco’s ears. “You hold me in such high opinion, Potter. I’m almost flattered.” He turned to Bellatrix. “Perhaps you can demonstrate to Draco here an example of what would happen to Potter if Draco doesn’t comply.”
Me neither. If I had told my younger self, he would probably have me checked into the mental ward at St. Mungo’s. “Free drinks,” I said with a grin. “The Ministry paid.”
“Come with us, Draco,” he said. He fended off a jet of red from Potter. I strained against his Body-bind, my fingers flexing on the handle of my wand. If I could only aim it ….
I looked at Harry, my face burning with exertion and arousal. Just having my hands on him made me hard; I never expected that I would enjoy touching him so much. I never experienced this before, and it surprised me.
“Wouldn’t that have automatically set up an alert?” Harry asked. “Access to the Underground is highly restricted.”
“What did you find out?” Harry asked, all soreness gone. “Did you see who attacked me?”
There was also Dumbledore’s portrait, I remembered. Say what one does about him, he was a brilliant man, with vast knowledge spanning all the fields of magic. Not to mention he had been Headmaster of Hogwarts for so long – he might have found clues that could reveal more. In any case, Hogwarts was on the itinerary after more research, Hogwarts being Slytherin’s crowning achievement. Physical clues were most likely there than anywhere in the world.
Shadows played on the Shield, like a figures dancing across the surface. The illumination from the lamp fell at odd angles on the grooves and dips of the metal. The engraved scenes sprang to life. The sun and the moon at the center were almost moving, like a time-lapse of the dawn.
This was interesting. I had never seen anything like this before; yet, it became apparent as day what I needed to do next.
“The Deputy Head of Magical Law Enforcement here to see you, sir. And her husband.” He disappeared again.
Instead, he put one hand gingerly on Malfoy’s stomach. The chiseled panes flexed under his palm.
This man … Harry repressed his irritation as he took out his wand. “Naturally, all of what we talk about is covered under the Official Secrets Act.”
It was tedious work. I was used to this; writing my thesis had been the same. I could tell Potter was chafing, though. He would stare out the window every ten minutes or so, and he fidgeted so much that I banned him to the other table. He kept on tapping his quill and drumming his fingers.
I let out my breath. Well, that was my good deed of the day. I needed to remember Muggles don’t call it healing anymore – not that I planned to interact much with them in the future. But one never knew –
“Malfoy …” Harry was still touching Malfoy’s arm. “I’m sorry this happened.”
Right on cue, the heavy thud of combat boots and the buzz of radio registered in Draco’s hearing. He heard the elevator open distantly, as well as the door bang against the wall.
“You’re in shock,” Potter said. His mouth was set in a grim line. “You need rest.”
He had a full, almost avuncular face that contrasted sharply with his threatening air.
“Yessir.” Finnegan saluted. He grinned at Draco. “Hope all goes well sir. For the record, I think you were brave, coming out here like that for your friend.”
“Pity.” My hands were slack on the bedsheets. “I guess I’ll miss having Harrods within walking distance.”
“Are we taking the lift?” Draco asked, seeing that Harry was headed towards the bank of them tucked behind the reception. “Won’t it be like walking into a trap?”
I didn’t mention that Potter would not likely find a friendly welcome with my father. My mother, perhaps, especially if they were in contact, but definitely not Lucius Malfoy. I expected Potter knew that too.
Potter merely nodded.
And even should I choose to trust him, I could not live with myself helping a gang of ruthless criminals achieve their dream of pure blood supremacy.
Kreacher snapped to with an agility that would have shamed a younger elf. He scurried out of the room as Potter carried me up the stairs, one arm around my knees, the other around my back.
“They live here?” Draco recognized the area they were in as one of the outlying suburbs of Greater London. Rows of semi-detached houses lined a quiet, leafy boulevard. “I thought they lived in one of those trendy, gentrifying areas somewhere in East London.”
The Weasley sighed. “I guess that’s a good a plan as any we’ve ever came up with. Though I still don’t like the sound of this book. Doesn’t sound like some good thing to me.”
Nothing in Malfoy’s files had suggested that he owned an illegal business. Harry pulled his memory, trying to recall if there were any investigation or indication that linked Malfoy to the Underground.
“None, but some need a change of underpants.” Finnegan grinned at Harry. “Only two of them, sir? Surely the great Harry Potter doesn’t need our help taking only two down.”
“It’s alright.” Potter didn’t look it. “Let’s just … not talk about it for now.”
“Follow my lead,” Harry whispered back.
“Or you could pick a duster and do it yourself.”
“Let me down!” This position was not all that uncomfortable. “My legs are fine.”
Harry laughed. “Definitely not. I’ll see you when I get back, Draco. Don’t let any strangers in.”
They had taken one look at the scene and would have clapped both Draco and Harry in handcuffs if Harry had not casually mentioned that he was holding a member of one of the most wanted criminal groups in Europe under gunpoint. Their leader had shown more sense than most police Draco encountered, and acquiesced to calling a number that Harry had provided. In the meanwhile, the other men took away the unconscious Dolohov, Wormtail, and Riddle.
Draco was left alone as Harry left.
Potter stared just a little off to the side. “You know I’m not going to. They’ll just stick me behind a desk and wheel me out once in a while to boost morale.”
“Likewise.”
“No ….” Granger looked at me, her face unreadable. “You’re making a lot of sense. But I don’t think we should be having our conversation in the middle of the hallway. Let’s move this to my office.”
“I called to let them know I’d be working from home for the next few weeks,” Draco said. “I told them I have a new project with an undisclosed university that I’m consulting for. These auction houses usually like their staff to burnish their credentials.”
“I –” But Malfoy was right. Harry deflated. “Sorry. I wasn’t thinking. You’re right; Goyle did warn me.”
“You and Blaise are close,” Potter said after a while.
“Well, you got the basics down,” Malfoy said. “These are blueprints for a new chip that can allow SI to control body functions.”
