He stared at the corpse, ordered his thoughts, and started.
“Has anyone been making sure to do that?” he asked, indicating it.
Philomena’s mouth fell open. “You wouldn’t!”
Draco nodded in acknowledgment.
They finished dinner and moved what remained of their drinks over to the coffee table, above which the fairy lights were still twinkling. Draco awkwardly sat next to Potter while the other two fetched snacks, trying and failing to find a clever topic of conversation.
“Hey Draco,” Pansy calls cheerfully.
“I’m realistic!”
“That’s quite alright,” she said. “I want Lena’s killer caught so badly. She didn’t deserve what happened to her, not one bit. They say it’s a poison – is that true? How could that have happened?”
“Neither do I,” Draco confessed, and wondered why he wasn't more shaken by what had just happened.
“So, they’ll still be in the blood but harmless, and it gives me time to create something that’ll actually eliminate them,” Draco finished.
"Yes, of course four of us."
In the end, Molly and Kingsley enjoy the lemon cake and sweet biscuit crumb sand, but they’re left a little disappointed that the beach ball decoration isn’t edible. The crowd applauds politely, the cake disappears from the table – to be cut and distributed as soon as judging is done – and another takes its place.
“The things... some of the...” Potter trailed off and sighed. “I had a mental connection with him. I could see things through his eyes sometimes. Things like, well, you, and what he made you do.”
Draco held up the photograph, then thrust it forward when it occurred to him that Harry probably couldn’t see that much detail in the low light.
She directed a large, silver-wrapped something to float over to him. Several minutes of careful spellotape removal later, Draco was staring at one of the wooden pyramids he’d seen at the Christmas Market, with hand-painted figurines and candles that would cause the entire thing to spin when lit. He’d forgotten all about them on his second visit to the market, but then, he’d been too busy trying to find a gift for Harry.
“Well, because Hermione said your flat looked sad, and then Marielle pulled these from somewhere and shoved them at me and said I had better spruce the place up a bit. And I am not about to fight with either of those two about it, sorry.”
“Because,” Harry said, “magic doesn’t work from one realm to the other.”
Of all the things, it had been Fiendfyre that had trapped the Golden Boy in a basement after he’d been disarmed and gone recklessly charging in anyway, like the blasted Gryffindor he'd always been. It wasn’t fair, Draco thought, that Potter, who had risked his bloody life so many times for other people, who had risked it to save
Granger repeated, even more disapprovingly.
At thirty-seven minutes, Potter’s eyes fluttered open.
“What, you didn’t look inside for the signature?” Draco asked drily.
, you know. It seemed unfair to tell him and expect him to just keep working like nothing’s happened, but it’s also unfair to George if Ron’s distracted because he’s worrying about Harry. If Harry wakes, I’ll tell him in a heartbeat, but now…” She sighed, looking conflicted.
“That actually makes a lot of sense,” said Granger. “I mean, as much as this entire thing
.” He hadn't been able to articulate just what he needed, gray eyes searching Harry's face as though he might just have all the answers.
they had wasn’t clearly defined, it turned out that being in trouble for forgetting your sort-of anniversary was still very much possible. At least, he was pretty sure that was why Draco had been ignoring him for the entire last week, because they never bloody
“Yes. Three people. I was able to cure it in one, and that was a pain in the arse I was only able to pull off because there was a True Stasis spell involved.”
“Mate,” Weasley said, “why does all this bloody weird stuff
Even after Snape had left, Harry continued to stand by the doors of the hospital wing. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply in and out. He felt tired, thoroughly exhausted.
"Of course I know." he said through his teeth.
“I’m not a complete idiot, Malfoy,” Granger responded without venom, and sighed wearily. “I checked every way I possibly could without breaking the stasis charm.”
“Lab?” she asked.
“Huh?” Harry asks eloquently.
Draco stared into the tarnished mirror, his reflection swimming before his eyes, as Harry used his fingers and tongue and a little bit of conjured slickness to loosen and prepare him, and Draco’s own moans rang in his ears. It felt so good, so right that this should happen here and now and with this particular person. Eventually, he couldn’t keep his eyes open at all as Harry found all the spots where he was sensitive, all those nerve endings begging to be stimulated.
Parvati wiped her eyes again with the base of her palm – Draco found the lack of dainty mustn’t-smear-makeup fingertip dabbing very refreshing – and stood. “Harry, I am so happy that you’re here, and I’m tempted to talk to you specifically for several more hours, but I’ve already been here too long. Armadill will be wondering where I’ve run off to. I’d love it if we could talk sometime soon though.”
“Maybe I should floo her later, commiserate about Potters walking back into our lives like it’s nothing.”
“The wine is empty,” Weasley said sadly.
, exactly, but I think that getting away from my flat will help, and, er, well, I.” He faltered, because the girl flicked her head up to the sky and Harry realized he was standing there like a bloody idiot, getting rained on. “I’ll…I’ll just get on, shall I?”
sort of sound, and that was the important bit.
She rolled her eyes. “Of course. We still have the photo album as well, the one of your parents. I realize it might feel different for you to look at it now that you’ve spent so much time with them –”
“Yeah.” Harry grimaced. “They’re a lot worse than they were when we broke in here, years ago, and frankly, I’d rather not have to deal with them.”
“Ready!” Ron bellows.
Neither of them seems surprised by it. Draco returns the gentle pressure, reaches up to run his fingers through Harry’s filthy, sweat- and blood-soaked hair. Harry lifts his hands to touch wherever he can get to, feels Draco’s wince as he brushes a bruise.
“No.”
“Did you have something to say, young man?” Babs demanded to know.
Draco sighs, because for the first time he has something of an idea what Granger has to put up with at all times. Potter is lucky he’s got charm and fame. “If we can trace the path that the infection has taken, we might be able to determine its origin. That is the whole
Harry looked relieved – probably because it meant his gift hadn’t been inadequate, Draco supposed, and he had to admit he’d been relieved about the hat for the same reason.
“I wasn’t paying attention to anyone else,” Harry whispers back.
“Julia. Her last name…something with an ‘F’. ‘Fin-‘ or ‘Fil-‘…something. I don’t know, I’m sorry.”
, but it was somehow drawing power from a ley line, and essentially it was designed to keep every living thing
“Of course we’ll come along,” Harry said immediately. Draco found he didn’t mind him speaking for the both of them. “We can tell her about how no one else is in danger of getting poisoned.”
“I found him like this,” Pansy said immediately.
“And by Goldstein, MacDougal, the Patils…even Longbottom. People do forgive, you know.”
“What? No.” Selwyn crossed his arms.
So Harry chronicled the events surrounding the painting and Malfoy’s reaction and explained the conclusion he had come to.
“I need you. I do. And you need me too, and it’s okay, Draco, it’s really okay that you do.”
They had been talking for a quarter of an hour and gotten through about half of the material they needed to cover when something occurred to Harry.
Potter cleared his throat. “Thanks,” he croaked.
“Parvati? So this is for the Aurors?” Victoria asked.
Apologies for the long absence, and a great big thank you to all the lovely comments I've received on this piece during that time. I suffer from cyclical depression among others, and it's been a difficult few months. I'm doing better now. Hopefully this new chapter meets expectations.
“Hermione.”
“Now then, Mr Malfoy – what sorts of alterations were you looking for?”
“Are you talking about former Death Eater Draco Malfoy?” Ron asks, probably thinking he’s being sly. Harry does not approve and tries to catch Ron’s eye, an act that is probably at least partially to blame for caramel sauce suddenly dripping all over his workspace.
“Sit down, Harry. You’re already here, so we might as well get this over with.” She pushed a chair his way while she leaned back against her desk.
“Since when are you a stickler for rules?” Draco asked absently while he counted out money for the owl service. “You basically ignored them all through Hogwarts.”
Prompt #10 – A Christmas card with ornaments and printed text “I Like Your Balls”
“I want you to leave it alone,” he announced.
“Did you know I like these, or did you guess?” he asked.
Harry supposed he could accept that, because he’d gotten there in the end, hadn’t he? “What now?” he asked. “I can’t just walk in there and start making out with him like Ron said. And I did run away from him
“I doubt it, but I also doubt that Orval was capable of casting one.”
“Holy shit,” he said, “those are
"What's that, then?" Weasley asked when Blaise hovered several small, red fruits over the mint.
After a long moment of silence, Harry said, “Susan’s wand was made of rowan. Her second one, after the war. She told me it helped her decide to become an Auror, knowing that her wand was made to preserve life and not destroy it.”
Prompt #2 - Snow falling in a park
“It was itchy,” Harry said as though glamours were made of coarse wool.
Draco winced.
“Not as such, no. But I did want to let you know that I think…I think I might’ve actually figured it out.”
Granger gave a nod of acknowledgement and looked thoughtful.
Harry, whose spell had also been stopped, slowly lowered his wand and said with dread in his voice, “That’s from a barrier cube, isn’t it?”
“I’ve asked Pansy,” he says. “She won’t tell me anything, she just mutters things that make no sense.
“Er, nothing. It’s not important.”
“Mate, when it comes to Malfoy, I’m genuinely shocked every time you act in a rational manner.”
“Well, I find it less annoying than walking down the same street fifteen times.”
Now he just needed a good opportunity.
“And you’re not involving the hospital because…?”
“We’re healers, Malfoy. It’s a part of the job. You did what you could, you always do.”
“Done,” Potter says, and just like that, they have formed an unlikely alliance.
Draco nodded briskly. “You don’t owe it to me,” he said. “Granger, probably, but not me.” Another spell, lungs this time, searching for any damage. Looking intently at a patient’s chest had never been an issue for Draco – until now. Of course. He decided to busy himself with feeling for weak spots in the tissues of Potter’s right arm at the same time, just to keep busy.
It’s a pain to get all the sponges made. Harry can’t imagine it’s terribly exciting for the audience either, watching them all mix batter for so long. At least they are allowed to make use of the sideboard with the cooling charm this round, else he’s sure people would be starting to fall asleep from the boredom of watching them all fan their sponges for a sodding hour. The only thing of note that happens is Ernie throwing his ruined sponge at a heckler in the crowd in frustration, and starting over.
It still hurt a little when Harry pressed into him. Draco greeted the pain like an old friend, savored it, let it heat his skin and make him float. He blinked, and green eyes met his own in the mirror. Harry’s face was intense but his expression caring even as he bit his lip and dug his fingers hard into the skin of Draco’s hips.
“Potter found it.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed.
“Oh,” Sky said, sounding disappointed.
“Barely. Every time I see them, it gets more difficult to keep from hexing my father into oblivion.”
Draco lowers his wand and stares at his utterly dense temporary ally. “Are you paying attention at all? Observing Daphne for signs of insanity!”
that anyone and everyone is after the Selwyn fortune.”
“And some vanilla as well, unless I’m mistaken.” Molly smiles. “What a wonderful start to the competition.”
Sky shrugged. “I don’t mind. Everyone always expects me to be ashamed of it. But it’s fine, really. I can still experience all of this magic.” She gestured at the bus in general. “I think not being able to use it makes me appreciate it even more. So many wizards end up taking it for granted.”
Draco’s mind still hadn’t managed to wrap itself around that.
They agreed to have Potter stay at the Ministry for one more night to give Draco time to move the last of his lab equipment and prepare his guest room. He returned to casting cushioning charms on delicate beakers and vials and wrapping up herbs, but he worked slowly. Clearwater had promised to bring him an official “Thank you for not throwing a fit because we borrowed your potions specialist” note to present to St Mungo’s, and even though he didn’t think any of his superiors would make a fuss, it couldn’t hurt to be careful.
“No, no,” Draco assured her. “So you fitted the fuchsia robes, yes? Did you have a nice chat with her while that went on?”
“Both,” Potter said brightly, which was not at all helpful.
“Uh-huh.”
Potter’s skin was covered in four colors of markings now – the mysterious writings in black, then dots for the blood antidote in red, and for the cell antidote in blue, and now the occasional, strategically placed X in green for the serum. It was by far the most complex detoxification he had ever attempted.
“What –”
“Oh, right,” said Sky, and came over to drape the knitted blanket that had been lying there over Harry’s lap and tuck him in. “See?”
Draco was about to take the card back and let it go, but then he glanced Potter’s way and realized that one corner of his mouth was quirking up, and, hell, Potter could use a little cheering up.
“That only means that you go back to where you started,” Sky pointed out, “and that’s what you’re doing.”
“And I promise I’ll be better in the future,” Granger added, and finally, Weasley’s shoulders dropped and he sighed.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “So get a bottle and two glasses, Draco, honestly.”
Draco burst out laughing. He hadn’t meant to, because the fact remained that Potter had been presumed dead for two years, and there was nothing funny about that, but hearing about something so mundane when he had expected some manner of epic tale, well…
“Well we could try our luck with Games and Sports if you like, but I don’t think we’ll find much.”
to think back.
This late at night, the corridors of St Mungo’s were close to deserted, although the place was never truly quiet. There were only six people waiting in the reception area. Draco thought it might have been the emptiest he’d ever seen it, although it was possible that it was a trick of the eye. The area had been expanded and modernized the year before, making it bright and welcoming, with comfortable chairs and sofas. It was an extreme contrast to the cramped room it has been before, where six people would have been a much bigger, much more obvious presence.
“I’m sure it’s related,” said Hermione.
“More like absolution,” Draco said, realizing it was true the moment he said it. “Afterward, I feel better. Like I've suffered, and it's over with, and I'm allowed to forget just for a little while.”
“Oh,” she said. “No. It’s not real.”
“I…fuck, I don’t remember.”
Blaise calmly kept reaching into his satchel and placing bottle after bottle on the counter in a neat little row. "Because you need to stop being annoying and stubborn about Christmas, Draco."
“Potter!”
said the note when he had finally managed to unroll it.
“Yes,” Potter said cheerfully. “This is why I was almost never caught out of bed back when we were in school.” He moved his splayed hand over the parchment. “My dad and his friends made this, actually. Back in the cairn, they told me some of the magical theory involved. It’s quite interesting, I’ll have to keep in mind for when I need something to bribe Hermione with.”
“That’s because, if it is what I think it is, it’s pretty much unsolvable unless you’re who the message was meant for.”
“Of Mysteries?”
“You got it,” Blaise responded, and dropped the spell without ceremony.
“Yes, I know, Harry,” she said. “It’s harmless, I promise.”
“Bones said he wasn’t in the habit of carrying one. No reason he would have had one for this particular mission and not tell her. Besides, even if he’d had one, there were Anti-Apparition wards up, and I can’t think of another way he could have gotten past the Fiendfyre. Regular fire, maybe, but not this stuff.”

“Does Parvati know who we’re suspecting?” Draco asked her.
; she didn’t focus on getting through the defenses of one opponent at the risk of leaving herself vulnerable to the other. Instead she used the environment to her advantage to buy herself time. A chandelier came flying at the man and forced him to dodge, distracting him just long enough for Bones to turn the floor beneath the woman’s feet to slippery ice. As she flailed, a spell hurled two chairs at the man to keep him occupied, and the woman only managed to cast a single curse, which went wide, before a bright light flashed right in front of her face and messed with her eyesight.
“Me too, but I’m worried I’ve overlooked something obvious. I can only do this once, Briar said he’d bury his brother as soon as I was done. I don’t plan to take up grave robbing.”
Draco sighs deeply, suddenly presented with an explanation for a lot of strange happenings over the years. “Of course you do.”
that makes Draco’s brain explode a little bit. “Surely that doesn’t count!”

“Excellent, excellent,” said Philomena. “
Draco looked at the painting, at the long elegant lines, the dark spots that might be kitten ears but that, to him, looked like dark, messy hair. He couldn’t put his finger on why, but the only thing he could think of when he saw the painting was
“I didn’t mean it the way it came out,” Potter said then, again. “I only meant…well, I’m not sure what I mean. I think I’m just so used to being the one defending her that it felt strange to be on the opposite end of that, with you on her side.”
Draco hates how much sense it all makes, now that he really thinks about it. “Wait,” he says when something occurs to him. “So what were you and Weasley talking about in the hallway then, Theo?”
Draco swallowed hard. This wasn’t the impossible task it had been before, when he’d held everything back and within himself like a deadly secret, but that didn’t mean it was easy.
He figured Clearwater's possessions wouldn't take as long to search, so her desk was where he started. He felt jittery with nerves as he leafed through the papers in her desk drawers, cast
“Circumstances worked in my favor. I heard from more than one student who saw Potter racing past with Malfoy, I only had to follow the track of blood. And then your apprentice came running up to me in the corridor.”
“Yes, but Parvati needs to understand, because we can’t afford to lose her trust,” Draco pointed out. “And if that happens, we might not be able to solve the case, and you know who needs us to solve this? Fucking
“And you painted...”
“Are you thinking of starting a new career then, Mr Malfoy?” McGonagall asked, just before dismissing them. “Auror work suits you surprisingly well.”
“Does that tell you anything?”
so he hadn’t been as much help as he otherwise might have been.
Granger –
Harry sighed, sounding disappointed, and Draco had to work really hard not to feel guilty.
“You know what, Malfoy –”
Draco nodded, mouth dry and belly tense with longing at the memory. “And just don't,
Draco promptly felt his cheeks warm.
“No!” Harry yelped, because destroying Draco’s garden was decidedly not the sort of non-romantic gesture he’d been trying for. “Don’t you dare! Nothing can be damaged, there has to be another way!”
Is she doing that
“Mate, we’re all in the same boat there,” Weasley pointed out, then glanced at his wife. “What was it?”
of me?”
“Just a scratch, Harry,” Draco says gently.
“Good. And... I want you to promise that you'll tell me if it gets to be too much, or if there is anything more you need. I can't read your mind. So you have to tell me.”
“Yours,” he rasped. The word was heavy on his tongue.
When they were finally inside a lift, Draco carried a gigantic wreath and Potter clutched a garland made of tinsel.  One end was draped over his shoulder. Draco was not sure whether that was on purpose.
“Sorry, sorry.” He took the parchment and tried to smooth it out, noticing that there were moving dots on it with…names on them?
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “Says the boy whose hair has been fighting a constant battle with gravity for the past seven years. And I’d stick to my glass house if I were you. You’re not exactly looking hale and healthy yourself. Celebrity getting to you?” A flicker of amusement built in his gaze, mouth tugging up to one side. “Or are you wasted without a cause to champion? Find you just can’t get out of bed in the morning without whacking a few death eathers—”
Maybe Dumbledore had been wrong about all it. Maybe Harry had never been whole. Who could do something like that to a person, even by accident?
The white beach was quiet and cold, the waves lapping at the sand before his feet. The sky was grey and bright and he thought he heard a voice on the wind singing. He walked for a while, toward something he couldn’t quite name. He recognized the coast and then it shifted the pebbles taking on a shining, pearly light. There was something ahead of him. A thread pulling at him maybe, or a lighthouse. A glint far off in the distance.
Malfoy had come out of that explosion looking like he’d only been in a bit of a scuff up but he didn’t seem to be anything but shaken. Tired. His right trouser leg was pockmarked from where Bellatrix had caught him. As Harry watched him, he toyed with the left sleeve of his shirt, like he wanted to roll it up but kept stopping and clutching his forearm. Like it hurt.
His voice was still unnaturally smooth. It sounded horrible, but she was looking at him like he wasn’t the boy she’d been friends with for seven years. The boy she’d fought a
Why did
by accident?
“Can I keep this?” he asked before he could stop himself, his voice rough in the oppressive silence of the room.
Also the distressing knowledge that an angry spirit was living inside Grimmauld Place had only been unearthed once he did a bit of blood magic, so it was all a wash anyway.
The next week passed slowly as Harry desperately tried to hold on to the sense of peace he’d been able to find out here on the edge of everything. But he had known it would fade, known it would eventually spoil and leave him unmoored again, slip through his fingers and eddy through the air until he could only stare at the empty sky.
Harry was the Master of Death. What a fucking joke.
“Well,” he said when he got his voice under control. “I guess that’s something.”
A shadow flickered across her face. “You don’t mean that.”
“Is there somewhere you’d like to keep it? I don’t think it needs…” What was he talking about? He didn’t have the first clue what it needed. He might have pulled an Exceeds Expectations out of his arse for Herbology, but he wasn’t exactly wild about plants. He made a mental note to owl Neville, before he realized Neville might want nothing to do with him after his violent defense of Slytherins at the trial.
If the weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts were a series of clipped images, people and places blurring past Harry like he was peering out the window of a train, June felt like flying into the Whomping Willow, only it didn’t incite the thrill of being nearly smashed to paste.
you especially.”
Between the two of them, the second felt darker, or at least less bright and safe than the greenwood book. And if he was going to do something stupid, he might as well be smart about it.
The part which made him want to include Hermione most was Regulus’s abstract and near-incomprehensible musings on the nature of magic and where in the body it was stored. Harry had always assumed it was a blood thing, the underlying justification for pureblood supremacy. But there seemed to be something else, something Regulus wouldn’t move on from—only here Regulus lapsed into German, his notes presumably mirroring the text he’d slotted in with all the others, and Harry could only guess at what conclusion he’d come to. In the same vein there was a book all in French sporting some truly terrible drawings of what he could only assume were meant to be outcomes of spells, or more likely, curses. Regulus had mapped a few out in his notes, but they were all labeled in French and though Harry knew a bit thanks to Fleur, he couldn’t make much sense of them. Whoever Madame Chastel, the author of the spell book, was, she’d clearly been a sadist.
“Not seriously, you—”
“Sounded like it was voluntary.”
The house was alive now, and it was listening. All he did was ask it to hide.
things attending Hogwarts for six years with Peeves. Remus had touched on them briefly in Harry’s third year, but went no further than explaining how dangerous they were, and how hard they were to banish. If possible, it was better to make nice with the restless spirit and figure out how to cohabit. And if you couldn’t, it was probably best if you left the house to the spirit. Much easier to pick up and move than deal with an angry poltergeist.
“No, of course,” he said before Bill could cut him off again. “I was going to say I’ll come in and confess. I have to tell—an auror, or someone, right? I have to turn myself in.” What else was he going to do? He had no intention of hiding what he’d done. He might hate the Ministry but he wasn’t about to start breaking laws just because he could. This… He’d done something horrible and of course he needed to go in and tell someone. “Bill, I can’t just stay here and—”
“Wiggle,” Bill repeated.
If he could get to Nagini, if he could finish this now…
Bill nodded. “Kid’s the best curse-breaker I’ve ever met. Instincts like his would land him any job he wanted in the field tomorrow, if he wasn’t—you know. When I was his age I couldn’t get myself out of a Victorian tomb, but by the time anyone showed up at Malfoy Manor to bring his parents in, he’d apparently already emptied out the first level of the family cellar and had removed most of the nastier curses he could find, all on his own. That’s why they called me in. It was a veritable treasure trove of dark artifacts, just sitting out on the lawn like a fair. Makes Grimmauld Place seem like a laugh.” A dark look passed over Bill’s face. “I’m surprised nothing worse happened to you when you were taken there. From what I could tell, the curses Voldemort worked around that place were incredibly powerful. The kind of dark magic that makes you wonder how anyone could even live in the midst of it.”
“That’s the problem,” he muttered. “Thanks, though. You’ve been—”
When Charlie Weasley appeared through the smoke, followed by an army of house-elves, Slughorn charging after with another wave of witches and wizards, Harry’s heart picked up pace. It wasn’t hope or relief but it was enough to cut through the deadening anger working its way up his throat.
He thought again about the Resurrection Stone just sitting in the dirt somewhere, covered in leaves and roots. He thought, for the first time, that maybe even shadows would be better than nothing.
Harry didn’t respond, but just moved through the hall and into the sitting room. He hesitated when he saw who was waiting for him—Robards, Faye Kamau, for some reason, and a younger woman with a severe blonde bob and large yellow glasses Harry had never met before.
And he wasn’t about to share any of this with the man who’d recently manipulated him into having a very public breakdown.
Of course, he still felt guilty. He didn’t think he’d ever stop feeling guilty.
“Did he try something?” Hermione’s voice dropped in anger. “If he threatened you—”
“I didn’t actually mean—,” Ron started slowly.
Harry swallowed tightly. “Of course.”
He found himself asking, without thought, “Why not punish the parents if…”
Her eyes narrowed, but she was still smiling. “You’re joking, aren’t you?”
and right, fuck, yeah, he needed some fresh air. Okay. That was the priority. Once he heard back from Bill and Robards about the investigation, he was going on a very long walk. At night. When it was cold. Where no one would see him or hear him while he reassured himself that he did not, in any way, feel any kind of attraction to—
“Hold still.”
The hair on the back of his neck stood on end. In spite of himself he chanced it.
A baby in a crib. Sleeping. His parents dead.
he understood the magic he was performing, but he wasn’t being entirely stupid. He knew it like he’d known the moment he touched his wand that it belonged to him.
That he didn’t even want to try made him want to curl into a ball and never speak to anyone again. It made him feel like the biggest git on this planet. Like the lowest, foulest idiot. He was broken. This was his fault. It had to be.
“I don’t want to impose.”
“Harry, steady,” Bill said, face a mixture of anger and worry, “you’re not going anywhere. You can’t even manage to stay on your feet.” He stood and braced Harry when he swayed, a fit of nausea making him dizzy. “You can’t just rush out and—”
“I said we’re not close,” Harry said, anger getting the better of him, half his mind still reeling from the idea that Malfoy would turn on his family and friends. “I’m not privy to his inner thoughts. All I can do is tell you that the kid I knew wouldn’t have turned on his family for anything, so whatever made him risk that is probably pretty damn important. I’m the last person who will sit here and defend the Malfoys, but I know that Draco and Narcissa both independently chose to save my life. So I don’t know if Draco is different, if the war changed him, but I would
Slowly, he turned back to Yeats. She was watching him with wide-eyed fury, her olive skin sallow, her hands still braced against the desk as if they were permanently fixed there. When Harry met her gaze, she flinched.
It was nice too, well-kept with a lot of light, a window seat in the kitchen, a clawfoot tub, pleasantly scuffed wooden floors the color of caramel. It was small but once upon a time it would have been unthinkable to the little boy who had been locked in a cupboard with only spiders for company. It creaked in a homey way. There were little sanded-down ticks on the corner of the hallway wall, measurements of the children who had lived here before him. He even had a walk-out which was apparently weather-proofed for anything barring large hail or hurricane-force winds. The agent had told him it was a good place for a plant. If he fancied himself a hobby.
She had been fourteen.
Felicity, face flushed, did a half-bow as she shuffled along after. “It was an honor, Mr. Potter. Truly.”
His voice rang through the room, pinging off the high ceilings. He couldn’t help but remember how Bellatrix’s crazed laughter had rebounded over the sleek black tiles in Dumbledore’s memory, filling the space and making it feel like a tunnel you were falling through.
“How much younger?” Proulx asked, interest sparking in his eyes.
But at the time, he hadn’t cared. He’d been glad to see them go.
And wouldn’t that be better, anyway? Harry wasn’t going to have a normal life. He couldn’t. Ron could have a normal life. Ron could live. He could live an easier life without Harry.
didn’t want this.
He exhaled shakily and made for the door, and only when he was outside in the brisk early autumn air did he realize that it’d been two weeks since he’d stepped out into the open air.
“No, I’d better not. I have to be in all day tomorrow, too.”
“What if I did?”
“All the Slytherin students, of course. You know, the ones McGonagall sent down to the dungeons to lock up before they could start murdering their classmates.”
Harry opened his eyes to find Bill staring down at him, shock and horror twisting his features. “Bill,” he tried to say, but his throat constricted so badly he could barely make any noise at all.
“You could try hard drugs,” Harry suggested pleasantly.
to hurt her.”
“I’m all right,” he mumbled, shifting Teddy carefully to the side so he wasn’t as distracted by the kaleidoscope of colors battling for ground on the boy’s head. He usually favored teal or some variation thereof, but it was still a journey sometimes.
“Is master wishing for something different to be eating?”
Hands shaking slightly, he pushed his hair back where it had gotten stuck to his face. Sweat had pooled in the small of his back and under his arms. It was cold and damp down here in the cellar, but the act of drawing the diagrams, intricate, horribly complicated things, seemed to draw on something more than artistic ability. He compared his sigil, his fifth attempt, to the one in the greenwood book, unable to find anything wrong with it.
Ron caught himself before he could fall and straightened up, face red as he pushed past Harry into the hallway. He opened his mouth but was cut off by Walburga Black’s shrieking voice.
It was odd, her looking like a normal person. He’d gotten so used to seeing her dirty and tired and haunted, her hair even more insane and unkempt than Harry’s had gotten, by the end. She was wearing a soft pink jumper and simple khakis and she looked healthy and relatively happy—and Harry didn’t know why that hit him so hard all of a sudden. She looked normal. Tired, but normal. Just like Ron.
Draco stupidly looked down and realized he still had the falafel clutched to his chest. He cleared his throat and took another bite.
“I’m sorry for snapping. I didn’t mean…I’m just nervous.”
“What?” he asked.
"You think it's best if we stick as close to the previous iteration as possible but make one change that will get us just slightly closer to our goal."
Weasley’s expression was unreadable as he stared at ‘The Pregnant Witch Is Always Right - A Guide to Communicating With Your Partner As You Prepare for Childbirth’. He opened his mouth, closed it again, looked at Draco, then away, then cleared his throat and put the book on the coffee table.
“Yeah, so?”
“Oh,” Victoria said meaningfully.
Well, at least she'd gotten
Draco was unsure what happened next. It felt like an orgasm, except his body was doing nothing but hurting and it was his emotions that suddenly felt amplified and intense, hurtling towards some peak he didn't understand, and then everything went bright white with physical and emotional pain.
“What do you need, then?” Harry wanted to know, standing up.
Potter traced a circle around the writing he’d been indicating. As he laid the wand aside with a clatter, the blur that had been there resolved itself into a cluster of numbers, and above it the words
“Only because I decided to knit you a vest, and your pride got in the way of you accepting it gracefully.” Ermintrude waved her own knitting project, pale pink and fuzzy, in illustration.
Draco glanced over at Potter, who was patiently reassuring Parvati, arm around her shoulders, and it suddenly hit him how very lucky he was to have gotten this chance. Less than three weeks ago, he’d lived an average and rather boring life, content but lonely, feeling distantly sad about the fact that Harry Potter had died two years prior. Now, his heart squeezed painfully at the thought, and…Merlin, he’d sat on Potter’s lap the day before and they’d…
“No,” Granger said and accepted the sandwich Clearwater held out for her. “I’ve only just come back myself. Malfoy hasn’t had the chance to have a look yet.”
“How soon can you get started?” Granger asked.
“Yes, you bloody do,” she said. “Go look in a mirror.”
“What?” Draco asked faintly.
“Oh,” Draco said, feeling extremely foolish.
gentlemen!”
“We should tell her,” Granger said. “I think we may have to.”
He’d gotten Hermione and Weasley three of the handmade paper star lanterns from the Christmas Market, with intricate cut-outs that looked like lace. Two of them were larger than Draco’s head, one gold and one silver, and in between them dangled a much smaller white one.
“Why do you do that?” Potter asked.
“Nothing,” Draco complained. He knew he looked petulant, sitting there with his feet on his desk and his arms crossed, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “Nothing since the flowers. Who does that? Who sends flowers and then
The boy cringed at the last few words.
The fact that Granger didn’t even protest told Draco she needed sleep just as badly, and he was glad when she Flooed home without delay. His pillow was calling, loudly.
“We had the hen party last night.” Eden said as she crossed the room ahead of them. Glass crunched beneath her trainers. “Obviously. It got a bit wild, we figured since June’s in for a life of stuffy formal pureblood dinners, we should show her a good time.”
“Is he emotionally abusive?” Sky asked with concern.
And then Harry blinked a lot and swallowed hard and didn’t appear to know what to say as he held something Draco was certain he hadn’t expected to ever see again.
“I didn’t want you to be caught unaware,” Granger answered primly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s gaze is fierce. “I don’t care.”
“No! Absolutely not!”
“What?”
“Oh. Well, can you wait until next Wednesday?” Theo asks eagerly. “Because then I’d win the betting pool.”
fabric, he realized a moment later, when he was frowning down at something grey with a large bobble on top.
both of them.
“I came to talk to you.”
Harry hadn't realized it was true, not until the moment he said it. Malfoy had looked at him with astonishment.
“Reasons,” Malfoy repeated flatly.
“Right, well, it might be a bit late for that,” Potter points out, finally letting go of Draco, “seeing how you rushed me of the library in a panic and all.”
“Could have done worse,” Blaise sniffed as he led the way into the kitchen. “Could have named it ‘Draco’.”
Wait, where had
It went on like that, with Draco trying his best to coax information out of Charlotte and Harry’s quill scratching almost constantly. She gave them quite a few names at first, but eventually his attempts to get more out of her was met with helpless shrugging. Draco had no desire to upset the headmistress, so once her expression began to morph into impatient disapproval, he thanked Charlotte for her time and sent her on her way.
“It’s time, dear audience,” says Ron. “This is the contestants’ final chance at improving their overall score. As a reminder, the bottom two from this weekend will be eliminated, and the top six will bake once again for us two weeks from now.”
“No.” Draco frowned. “I’m not sure…now it says twenty-five years and seven months. I’ve never seen this happen before, it shouldn’t… Merlin.”
He was afraid that one of those days, he would blurt out how he really felt and that would be it for them. Harry hadn’t said anything about the matter, but surely he’d noticed the way Draco couldn’t help but look at him. He couldn’t stop himself from wishing Harry was his, really his, and he was afraid the emotion was written all over his face whenever Harry stripped him down to the core.
Harry shrugged. “Haven’t got a clue, honestly. Maybe the poisoner didn’t want to stick around to see Orval die – or they couldn’t, for whatever reason – and that was where they set the cube when they made the barrier so it wouldn’t be discovered before they could come back and get rid of it.”
Malfoy was on his mind. That was all. Harry had just killed one of his best friends. Of course Harry was thinking about him.
He swallowed, strangling off the immediate shout of panic, and instead whispered, “…thank you?”
“Oh,” Harry said with a laugh, feeling a lick of heat warm his chest, “this will be good. What am I supposed to be misunderstanding, then?”
“I can hold him for a second, if you need,” Bill said, helping Andromeda set down the tea tray.
pile, thinking Charlie might be interested, when he spotted a hole in the back of the armoire. Peering through, he saw with surprise a small window and the corner of the attic. He’d reached the end.
Harry stared at the condensation on his mug, a confusing mess of conflict in his chest. “Might have something to do with attacking Voldemort before anyone else.”
Her lips pursed. “I was.” It took her a few moments, but she seemed to decide to let this go as well. She leaned back and slumped in her chair. “They haven’t said so in as many words, but I think they do. My father keeps saying I might benefit from a more well-rounded education. There’s a program at the university there that seems interesting.”
But that was the whole problem, wasn’t it? The board had been upended and he didn’t know anymore whose side he was supposed to be on.
Harry stared. Burbage.
It was a thin excuse, and he could tell Kingsley hadn’t missed the shift in Harry’s demeanor. But Robards seemed none the wiser. That or he didn’t care.
There was writing on the page. He blinked, startled, slid his glasses back on—and it was gone again. Confused, he tipped his glasses up, and there it was. Faint, just like the carvings on the top of the green box, more the impression of invisible words than true lettering. He chewed on his thumb for a while, leg jostling.
Kreacher stopped so quickly Harry had to brace himself on a highly unstable-looking armoire that buzzed the moment he touched it. Remembering their long and arduous campaign against the doxies of Grimmauld Place three years ago, Harry balanced as best he could and moved away at once.
Not for this.
A book with a wooden front plate, into which was carved the symbol from the outside of the box, followed by a few lines of runic script.
He actually wanted Goyle to get back up and attack him. He wanted Goyle to groan, twitch, so Harry could reach forward and take his wand back and knock him out. He wanted to flip Goyle over and make him look up into Harry’s eyes so Harry could see that he was—
“Oi!”
“If he is not guilty—”
“You said there were two others?” Hermione asked him, her eyes a bit too focused.
“Yeah, well,” he said coldly, “I’m special, right?”
Harry didn’t know if he pitied the man for thinking a little courage would change things, or if he envied him to have that kind of faith in the people he worked with.
Harry narrowed his eyes.
He swallowed down the tight knot in his throat, blinking against the wind, the warmth building behind his eyes.
But Malfoy looked like a completely different person too. Like he was trying as hard as he possibly could to leave, to be as distant as he could from this room.
He knew nothing.
“Ah, but the ‘nearly’ bit makes all the difference.” Charlie cocked his head. “Wait, you’re not talking about Norberta, right? She was just a baby. Not that she wasn’t up to it, but I got the impression she took most of her love out on Hagrid.”
Goyle was choking him. Beating him to death.
“Thanks, Percy,” Harry said after a moment.
Problem was, the idea of going back to Grimmauld Place until the trials started up was about as enticing as the prospect of listening to his two best friends fuck. It was the only place he could store all his stuff, though, so he’d made a go of it. He tried to sleep there his first night alone—he even made himself have a pleasant conversation with Kreacher about all the work he had done to fix the place up, so he was,
It seemed for a moment as if Malfoy wasn’t going to let him move the conversation, but then he sighed. “And bring down more trouble on my head? No, thank you.”
Harry’s grip was slick with his own blood as he lifted his wand—in his left hand. His right was still pulsing and cracking every time he moved it.
Come say hi to me on
“Kingsley approved it, didn’t he?” Harry asked after a tense silence.
Robards nodded, taking a seat after raking another sharp look over Harry’s body. His eyes tightened.
“They didn’t do anything to stop it, either. You heard what went on at school last year. The Slytherins were given free reign to do whatever they wanted, and it was a fucking nightmare.”
“It does, actually,” Bill said mildly, meeting Harry’s look with a pointed one of his own. “Intent matters when deciding how to charge a witch or wizard for committing a crime. So does the state of mind of the individual at the time the crime was committed. You were nearly incapacitated. You reacted without intent to kill. You notified a Ministry official within minutes of the act. Your wand was tested and every spell you cast was one of defense, a fact witnessed and attested to by several members of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. All of this matters.” His expression hardened. “And even if none of that were true, even if you insisted on undergoing examination, taking Veritaserum, allowing a legilimens to examine your memories, it’d be moot, because you have two senior Ministry officials from two different departments speaking on your behalf.”
It ended between the space of one breath and the next. The magic and the light died as the final shrieks and haunting notes of the bond between them faded out.
Dobby had still been young when he died.
Bill laughed, draping an arm around Harry’s shoulders and tugging him out toward the exit. “Oh, you crossed paths with Proulx, did you? Never met a man I’d like to punch more, let me tell you.”
“But we can’t say so out loud, is what you’re saying? We have the right to think what you’re doing is harsh and immoral but we can’t do anything about it. We can disagree, but only in private. Anything else is discouraged.”
It came to an excruciating crescendo one night when Molly and Arthur were off visiting Ron and George in London. He and Ginny had the whole house to themselves for the first time in a month, and it should have been a godsend. It should have made him nervous and excited and anxious. All he felt during dinner and after, curled up on the couch listening to the wireless with the girl he was supposed to be in love with, was a sense of impending unease.
had done might not have been the most thorough, but the softness of his bed was a powerful deterrent.
“Outside of all this,” Bill pulled his other hand out of his pocket and gestured, “are you doing okay? I realize this is a bloody nightmare but I haven’t heard much from you since you left Shell Cottage. Settling into London all right? I know Ron kicked you out, the little bastard.”
“Sure. I can do that.”
“The look of the future is sleek and simple, and the New Millenium will be christened with chrome.” Harry snorted. “Must have gotten that out of a brochure. There was also something about the silver balls balancing out the energy but I stopped listening at that point because otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten out alive.”
He lifted his left hand, showing Bill the scars there, vindicated by the quick look of disgust on Bill’s face. “Because from my experience, it doesn’t work. You know what you get when you terrorize kids? A bunch of terrified kids.” He dragged a hand through his hair, agitated, and said, harshly, “You know I almost thought for a second things were different, that the Ministry might actually have learned something. But they’re the same. They’re the exact fucking same.”
“Yeah, I got that impression.”
But he knew the look in her eyes. Desperate and scared, relieved someone else knew and was trying to help.
**this song is the one I listened to eight months ago and cried big fat ghibli tears about because it so perfectly fit my idea of post-war Harry that I started writing this fucking thing**
He was filling Grimmauld Place with light. It was every bit as invigorating as the first time he’d picked up his wand and
It was the sadness that pricked Harry’s mind. Bits of the dream began to crystallize and harden, refracted as if through a prism. A tremble went through the beach and Harry nearly felt the oncoming dread of a storm.
She was
Harry tried to give her a smile. “Thanks.”
He was confused. He was tired. He’d just done some seriously dangerous blood magic and his mind was a bit wonky. Or, wonkier than usual. It wasn’t…
Slowly, his blood spread like a shadow across the sheet. He pulled his finger away when he thought he’d held it there long enough, watching with a mixture of apprehension and awe when three words appeared above a symbol—a simplified version of the symbol on the front cover.
Harry stopped breathing. He waited. The tension solidified. The distant sound of stone crumbling echoed around the ruins of the castle. The whisper of dust slid over broken cobblestones.
But he still couldn’t bear thinking about it. Hedwig was gone, but he couldn’t imagine replacing her.
“Here in the Ministry or here in the atrium? Funny, because I’m pretty sure he’s got as much right as anyone else to
“Is that—”
He rooted through the box the agent had left him, realizing the package was actually a bunch of shrunken furniture, to find something to sit on. Picking at random a little red armchair, he released the enchantment and sort of tossed it in front of him, wincing when it made a loud thud on the shabby floors.
He’d gotten all the hallows. He’d done it all, the impossible, by anyone else’s standards.
“You don’t have to explain it to me, Hermione,” Harry said quietly, smiling. “It makes sense.”
He couldn’t help but picture Sirius doing the same, drifting through the halls of his childhood home, hating every room with its moldy plaster and peeling wallpaper, wanting nothing more than to get out of this mausoleum and fight. Wanting it so badly he’d left to save Harry.
His pale eyes were empty. There was a horrible, barren resignation in them which stoked alarm in Harry’s belly for the first time since waking on the forest floor, though he couldn’t say why. There was something to Malfoy’s emptiness. Something Harry recognized.
Kreacher glowered at him. “Kreacher is needing to make Master Harry eat. Mistress Andromeda was being very clear with Kreacher that—”
exactly what he was and what that meant. He wanted to be able to defend himself when he next met someone who wanted him dead or hurt.
Harry stared at the place he’d disappeared for a long time, rubbing the ring between his thumb and forefinger. He considered putting it on, just to see if it fit, but it’d be his luck if he got stuck with a cursed ring after everything else. Better to keep it off, for now. He slid it into his pocket. With a distracted sigh, he eased down into the chair, staring warily at the gas lamp. He assumed it wasn’t real fire. Kreacher wouldn’t risk Regulus’s things being so near an open flame, even one caged in by glass.
the old woman hissed.
Harry stared. “Grindlewald.”
Harry’s hands clenched, pulse kicking up as he heard Yeats thank Hermione for her testimony and dismiss her. He wanted to think Hermione was only being honest, that there was nothing more to her statement, but he couldn’t help but hear a note of accusation directed toward him. As gentle a reminder as she could give him in the midst of so many other eyes.
“It’s still unplottable. And there are a few leftover spells from when Mad-Eye—” Harry blinked away his tears, trying to sound certain. “Kreacher’s there too. He’s a lot more willing to help these days.”
“Where’d you learn about it?”
off into the world on their own with little more than a vague goal and a fool’s conviction, tasked with the death of a wizard so powerful
He fought the urge to cross his arms. He knew exactly what Kingsley was thinking, and it wasn’t like he hadn’t thought about it himself sometimes. Pain was a good way to clear your head, if it was the right kind of pain. But he’d never hurt himself like that. He’d never really wanted to.
or did you not realize when you stepped in and stopped him—”
“Look,” Bill said, leaning in, “he didn’t have a lot of other options. Half the Wizengamot wanted to throw the children of anyone suspected of being a death eater or a Voldemort sympathizer in jail with their parents. It was all Kingsley could do to keep them out until they got a fair trial. This was the best we could—”
“A cuff layered with a tracking charm and a dormant curse if I violate the terms of my conditional freedom? Yes.” Malfoy released the material and Harry had to blink a few times once he realized he’d been staring at the strip of pale skin where his sock ended. “It’s a fun new toy the Ministry’s trying out. If I don’t come in once a day, this will clamp down and shoot a
“Right. What’s your grandson’s name?”
Would he leave if Harry shouted him out? Did Harry want him gone?
As he walked back to the kitchen, he could swear he heard a happy tinkling of china or glass.
“So, what,” Ron started, his voice wavering even as he screwed up his face, “I’m just supposed to leave you alone? We’re just going to pretend like you’re not imploding? You expect me to just walk away and leave you in here by yourself? You think I’d do that? After all the shite I’ve been through with you, you think I’m going to just—leave you here on your own?”
Harry just nodded, the idea turning his stomach.
“Fine. Throw it away then.”
“Stupid.” He bit his lip, shook his head. “So,
But if anything, Regulus’s notes just confirmed that no one seemed to have any bloody clue what was true or not when it came to the forces surrounding love and the soul.
“Patrick Van Buren?” a posh, unhurried, immediately familiar voice called from a startlingly short distance away.
Kingsley looked every bit as steady as he always did, his presence calm and commanding and utterly unflappable. Harry thought he might see some tension in his eyes, but it wasn’t in his voice when he spoke. “I asked Gawain if I could be here while he talks this all out with you. I hope that’s all right.”
He had hidden himself away from the world. It was what he’d wanted, but it still sat heavy in his stomach. He wondered if everyone who’d known where this place was would realize right away, or if they’d be none the wiser until they tried to remember where he lived, only to find a blank space.
Charlie grinned. “Well, if you ever need a bit of a break, you’re always welcome to visit. Romania is very beautiful. Mountains, forests, lakes—and your favorite Weasley.” He gave Harry a small wink. “Plus, I already know you’re good with dragons.”
Kreacher popped into view. Harry only just managed not to jump out of his chair. “Is master needing something of Kreacher?”
It took them two weeks just to let me leave the house alone. It’s perfectly reasonable for me to take a few months off and spend time with my
“Lucius Malfoy is a cowardly, vile, evil man, and deserves to be in prison for the rest of his life. That’s my opinion. He’s threatened the lives of my friends, he’s hurt people I care about, and I think the world would be safer if he weren’t allowed to get off clean and rebuild his life, because he would, in a heartbeat. Narcissa—,” he thought of Andromeda and frowned, “I don’t know her well, I don’t know what she’s done or if she deserves to be charged with anything, but she saved my life, so take that for what you will. And she’d do anything to protect her son. So if he’s working with you, my bet is she’s amenable too.”
No one did.
Just as he stepped into the designated apparation circle, he heard Bill call out his name. He must have run out after Harry. But he was already disapparating. He’d regret it later, but he couldn’t bear the thought of speaking to anyone right now and he didn’t know what else would come out of his mouth if he opened it. He was riddled with cracks, brittle with anger, and he didn’t want to fight. He’d left all of it down in the courtroom and he could feel the drop hurtling closer and closer toward him, the moment his rage died out. He was so tired of fighting.
A cut opened up on the back of his leg and he cried out. Warmth soaked into his pants as he hit the ground again. Large, unforgiving hands grabbed both his ankles and then he was face crashed down into the dirt as Goyle pulled him back. He threw out an elbow and caught Goyle on the chin. He twisted himself, trying to point his wand toward where he thought Goyle’s face was.
Right, so Harry had spaced out then. Okay.
He still didn’t know if he believed it. Malfoy had been an arrogant snake his whole life—right up until sixth year when his fangs proved to be far less lethal than anyone expected.
because he needed them to survive.
Late and trying to pull himself together, he went to the fireplace. He shook his hands out, grimacing at a small twinge in his left, braced himself, and stepped through the floo while saying clearly, “Gracemorrow Cottage.”
Of course he wasn’t out of the woods. He still sometimes felt like he was lying on the mossy, cold ground in that dark clearing. Like he’d never left.
There was nothing for it but to start, he guessed. Carefully, he slid the first piece of parchment off the stack, feeling rather guilty for reading through the notes of a dead man.
Harry fought himself, wondering why they fuck he felt he owed Malfoy anything more than a kick up the arse.
Andromeda took everyone else’s orders, eyes coming to rest again on Harry when he remained silent. He felt terrible for making her go through all this.
Harry pointed to Parkinson, sweeping his gaze around the room again. “You’re going to blame her for wanting to give me up to Voldemort?
“I know what it’s like to be blamed for something that isn’t my fault, Hermione. You—you
Harry blinked, startled. He’d forgotten someone else was there. “Yeah. Sorry, who—”
“Of course.” The creak of wood and the sound of footsteps announced their departure from the kitchen. “Are you sure you don’t want to stay for dinner? You could talk to him yourself.”
Harry thought he should be congratulated on not swallowing his own tongue. Instead, he just gave a little choked sound of surprise.
He’d never given much thought to the house system before. It had made sense, putting people who were similar together, judging people by their values and their morals.
Had it really been five days already? With a growing sense of alarm, he counted back the mornings. He remembered them all, but they’d blurred together in his mind, his sense of time warping the longer he spent in the attic. He wasn’t forgetting, it was just that time had ceased to mean anything to him. He’d stopped paying attention to it.
“Ah, I understand now,” she said, taking a seat. “Are the posters still up as well?”
“In three-a-side,” Harry said with a laugh, looking down when his cheeks started to warm. “Using a summer melon for quaffle. Don’t think that counts.”
Summoning his last bit of willpower to be polite, he put on his glasses and straightened up. An elderly woman’s face came into focus, her lips painted a garish neon pink and her hair shifting colors from orange to white then back to orange like a demented swirling ice cream.
“Come,” he said, beckoning—and if Harry could feel anything more than anger or alarm he might have stalled at that. It was soft—horribly,
“The Wizengamot now calls to the stand Mr. Harry Potter.”
Her forehead creased. “Oh, Harry. If you like I can send you some of Daddy’s clover tea. It might help clear your head out. You could also try wearing your shirts inside out for a few days to scare them away. Might help you think a bit more brightly.”
A silver-blue animal, long and thin with a fluffy tail, it looked almost like a squirrel but sleeker and longer, burst from his wand, zipping once around the room before he dispelled it. “Now you know. I’ll send a warning before I come.”
His voice was thin and breathy, frightened. Harry waited, tense.
Kingsley turned from the window, walking out of Harry’s sight line. “So,” he started, his voice softer, “how’s our boy doing?”
Bill nodded after a second, confused. “Sure thing.” As he came over, Charlie shot Harry a curious glance, but he stayed where he was.
A tight, hot coal was burrowing into Harry’s chest. Kingsley was standing there, debasing himself, admitting fault to Harry. He was treating Harry like an equal, and the only thing Harry could think was that he wanted none of it.
Hermione staggered backwards and hit the door. Eyes wide, face draining of color, she tried again,
the woman—sounded like a woman, anyway—exclaimed and clapped her hands. “I say, I never thought I’d be able to meet you myself.” A white shape shoved toward his face. It was probably her hand, but Harry had been wrong before. Another woman had asked him to sign the handle of her umbrella ten minutes ago. Five minutes before that a man had wanted him to touch his handkerchief for luck. As if that made any kind of sense. The six others before them had only wanted to introduce themselves and thank him and then leave him alone, which had been fine when he was eleven and still found it novel when people didn’t actively sneer at him or ignore him entirely, but now it was somewhat annoying. It made him feel like a circus attraction. Difficult even when he had the patience, near impossible now when he wanted to piss off and go scream into a wall for a few hours.
It was oddly disconcerting to imagine Draco Malfoy laughing just
“I—am.” He exhaled sharply. “Yeah. I am.”
“That girl attacked—”
Because unlike Kingsley, Harry had never been given the choice.
Harry shrugged. “It was pretty standard, and after a while I think they realized I didn’t have much to say. They asked me about Hogwarts kids today, mostly, which I didn’t know much about beyond…” He cleared his throat, trying not to think about Malfoy. “Just weird. They brought in people from outside Britain to help, you know.”
Something brushed his cheek. A soft, gentle finger, catching the diamond tear which had slipped down Harry’s face.
He rolled himself out of bed, toeing off his shoes and discarding clothes as he trudged his way upstairs to the bathroom—not the bathroom on his floor, because the pipes in the third floor bathroom liked to smack him in the head sometimes if he took too long. As he passed, though, he felt a weird tingle on the back of his neck. Out of the corner of his eye, he…
For some reason, the image of Malfoy walking into his house alone after it had been witness to so much horror made him intensely uncomfortable. It wasn’t pity. It was too angry to be pity, but he couldn’t for the life of him pin it down.
“And either way,” she went on, “we’re researchers, not necromancers.”
had predictably developed into a full-blown crush.
“Harry, you can’t just pitch yourself into the Veil, you daft arsehole, all you’ll do is
“What’s unpleasant about him?” asked Ermintrude. “Do his feet smell?”
“I don’t think so. There was this turquoise-haired Squib woman, and two old ladies who were knitting, and a Kneazle, and a goblin mom and her –” He broke off when Draco pulled away from him.
I've decided to post the mostly-unedited drafts of the remaining chapters, since I'm not in a good place currently and have no idea whether I'll ever be able to get this done otherwise. I'm sorry about the long wait and the lack of polish, but for right now, it's unfortunately the best I can do. I hope you can still get some enjoyment out of it, as well as a satisfying reveal of the mystery. Much love ❤
Draco rubbed his eyes and said, “Oh, right. Yes, we should do that, I’m terribly behind with buying presents.”
So they stand there, in a crumbling corridor, swaying with exhaustion, and hold each other like a life line, kiss each other like they’ve found their truth. Harry is still free-falling, but it feels like he’s soaring, and he isn’t doing it alone. Draco is with him like a revelation always meant to happen.
“You’re one to talk,” said Philomena.
Draco shared a look with Potter before shaking his head. “No, thank you, Mr Selwyn. You’ve been very helpful.”
Potter had really hit a nerve. There were still people who reacted to his name with disgust, patients who refused to be treated by him. Shops who refused him service. Hell, only this morning, a parent had insisted on monitoring his every wand movement during Draco’s routine set of diagnostic spells just to make sure he didn’t cast an Unforgivable. He tried to tell himself that he’d earned it with his terrible choices, but it still hurt to be shown so clearly that he could never make up for it.
Draco’s lungs burned as he sucked in air trying to calm himself. His head spun. He couldn’t think, couldn’t grasp on to any solid thought, because if Potter wasn’t dead then which truths were even still safe?
“What happened to your painting?” Pansy asked, her tone soaked with
Oh, blasted
“So, you’ll brew two antidotes and inject them both,” Granger summed up.
“What kind of stirring rod?” Blaise asked, knitting his brow.
been eating dinner.”
“No,” she said, dark eyes narrowed dangerously. “No, I can’t believe I let you talk me into this, I never should have agreed. You’re putting my career on the line, all this Hank person has to do is–”
“I’ll tell you one day,” said Harry.
“You are a saint, Victoria, and your sacrifice shall not be forgotten. They should name the next hospital after you. But no,” he waved her off, “I won’t need you after today.”
“I’ve got the cloak with me, I’ll be fine.”
He was no longer worried, Draco realized right in the middle of one particularly intense session, watching Harry brandish his wand to shoot hot sparks at Draco that stung and fizzled on his skin. There was no hesitation, no clenched jaw that indicated Harry’s inner turmoil over what they were doing. He’d grown comfortable with his role. He was calm and confident and there for Draco to lean on if he needed it, and it was all so much more than Draco deserved.
“That, and while she’s a good potioneer, I don’t think she’s good enough to figure out the entire formula and brew it at such short notice. And how would we get a message to her anyway?”
“Go straight back in there, grab him, and start doing things I never want to know about,” Ron advised and stuffed the other half of the scone in his mouth.
Granger made a face. “Harry, he doesn’t exactly…”
to act natural the entire time, and how would we even
“What you’ll be making today,” Ron says, and it seems like everyone is holding their breath, “is a caramel chocolate ombre cake.”
“Wait, we weren’t supposed to know about this? Oh no,” Hermione said with a gasp, looking horrified. “I should have pretended I didn’t know what Molly was talking about when she asked me whether Draco and you would finally get married next year. Harry, I’m so sorry.”
Potter only shook his head.
“About poor little death eater me? Whatever for?”
Weasley rolls his eyes, muttering something about self-serving Slytherins, and Theo bumps shoulders with him as he laughs, and then the two of them make their way down the corridor and up a stairwell.
“No, nothing like that.” Harry frowned and looked out of the raindrop-covered window to his right. There was nothing but darkness beyond his reflection. “It seems a bit ridiculous now.”
Hello everyone! Yes, it's been quite some time.
“Get on with it, then,” Draco growled.
“What?”
A basic diagnostic spell was first to monitor both heart rate and breathing rate. Another more advanced one allowed the larger veins and arteries to shine through Potter’s skin. As Draco watched carefully for any irregularities, Potter watched

“Piercing.” Harry had finally settled on a word. “This piercing stare, like, really intense.”
Prompt #4 - Fire in a fireplace
“No, didn’t work.” She put the strip of parchment aside with a sound of frustration.
“What does it have to do with, if you don’t mind me asking?”
Draco whispered, “do you have Dumbledore’s wand?”
“Draco asked me to cleanse the house of Wrackspurts while he’s gone,” she said. “But this is much more interesting.”
He awoke, soaked with sweat and still feeling the unsettling fear he seemed to have taken away from the dream. It was always like that, always seemed to follow him from his sleeping into his waking hours and shake him up for long hours afterward. Kicking off the blankets, Draco sat and tried to calm his racing heart. The rest of the dormitory lay dark and silent, and his suffering amidst the content dreamers made Draco want to scream, so they'd know, so someone would know what it was that his head did to him. But of course, they wouldn't care, no one would. Except, perhaps, one person.
“Give me a hand, yeah?” Potter asked. He was apparently trying to get up but struggled to find a way to pull himself up safely. As a healer, Draco should probably have insisted on a monitoring spell, but he doubted that Potter would wait for him to cast one, so he moved forward with a mental shrug and pulled Potter to his feet.
Draco opened his mouth to ask who in Merlin’s name that was and then realized he already knew. “Blaise, you utter twit, you named your peppermint plant
Right,” said Draco, who realized then that despite the intrigue of it, he didn’t have much desire to revisit that night either. “Sorry.”
“There is no fixing it,” Draco snarled, agitated now. “What will you do, make me good enough for him somehow? Change the past? Make everyone forget the bad things I’ve done so Harry won’t look at me in disgust? What, Granger?”
Draco reels back as though slapped.
Parvati said sharply. “And you brought someone else in on this
This had to be one of the most surreal situations Draco had ever found himself in.
“At least consider the possibility! It’s very plausible.”
“Yes, and then she helped me plan it.”
Draco tried to look at Potter without making it obvious, which was a little difficult because both Potter and Blaise were staring at him now.
“Problems?” Draco asked.
Prompt #24 – A rowan berry
“I just, I need...”
“It’s why I became an Auror in the first place,” Parvati said, methodically shredding the tissue she was holding. “Lavender, I mean. I remember sitting in the Great Hall after the Battle of Hogwarts, next to her…her body, wishing so hard that I was somebody who could have protected her.”
He spent the rest of the day trying to think up a way to get Potter to leave him the hell alone. By the time he went to the little bathroom he had inadvertently discovered during his panic attack in Charms, he still hadn't come up with anything, and when he saw Potter already there, pacing, he sighed and closed the door, feeling like his Slytherin mind had failed him.
“Is this…are you serious?”
“Draco as well,” Theo says, and Draco goes rigid. “But he’s been rather secretive lately too, and that makes me worried. Won’t ever tell me where he goes when he leaves the common room, and spends a lot of time staring into space when he
“From Lyman Selwyn?” Potter asked.
A little while later, as they were all busy clearing plates, Hermione said, “Last night, just before we all went home and left the aurors to clean up the mess –
“As soon as I’ve had some sleep,” Draco said immediately. “I’ll need to take the sample to my lab, and – “
“Don't!”
“No idea, but it can’t hurt to ask when we go interview the witnesses.”
Blaise made a noise of satisfaction. "And he finally understands how doomed he is."
Draco shifted his hand, which drew a gasp from Harry. The movement was calming, back and forth like the tides, and Draco loved it. He licked his palm for lubrication, like he did on the rare occasion when he pleasured himself, and tried for simple enjoyment of the act. The knot in his gut was still there, but it was no longer quite as tight, not now when he had Harry before him with his eyes closed and his lips parted, barely suppressing a moan. He, Draco, was doing this. He was making Harry feel pleasure.
Ron and Parkinson count down from ten with the crowd, and they’ve reached three when Harry realizes he’s forgotten the final flourish on his decoration, and he flings himself across the counter with a sieve and a spoonful of icing sugar, barely managing to get it on before the countdown ends and a stasis charm wraps around his creation.
– and we weren’t able to figure out how because it was so bloody
He invited Draco to walk ahead of him with a ridiculous flourish. They made their way to the lifts, and Draco wasn’t afraid to admit he was looking forward to daylight and fresh air. He had no idea how the Unspeakables managed to work in these oppressive surroundings day in and day out.
“Why would anyone put a fake snowman in a telephone box?”
“I’d planned to ignore it, although I have to ask – who in Merlin’s name is
Draco wanted to interrupt, but he wasn’t at all certain that that wouldn’t make it worse. Harry knew Clearwater far better than he did.
, isn’t it, doesn’t mean he actually thinks that.”
“What are you on about?”
“No need to sound so surprised.”
“Have you thought about how to get past the headmistress?” he asked.
Draco grimaces. “I think the raspberry filling ended up too wet,” he says, apparently seriously concerned. “How about yours? Looked good, from what I could see.”
Potter’s eyes widen. “Step one of what? Of some grand plan?”
“I have a lot of possibly-misplaced faith in him,” said Draco. “Time will tell, I suppose.”
“Yes. Now it’s over. For now.”
“That isn’t much of a plan.”
Draco retrieved the poor owl that had flown into the window glass and checked her over for injuries while Harry untied the letter. The parchment was heavy and gilded around the edges.
“Oh.” She grimaced. “Right.”
The little goblin, Bug, nodded in very serious fashion and then whispered loudly, “Is my name horrible, mama?”
Victoria rolled her eyes. “You’re an idiot.”
“What do I do?” Harry asked, utterly lost. “I just took off like an utter berk, he must think I’ve gone ‘round the bend. What do I
“Why?”
“Yes. Important ones.” Harry stood so hastily he nearly swept a potted plant off the corner of Malfoy’s desk. Fuck, he just couldn’t concentrate, not when he’d suddenly realised that Malfoy
Draco carefully turned the arm a bit and realized that some of the messages were crossed out. Perhaps those were hints that had turned out to be unhelpful? Then there was a message to Granger that was also encoded.
“Luna, if you
“Sorry,” he whispers, and draws away.
“That’s a very good point,” he said to Sky. “And a good attitude. We do need to stop treating Squibs as though they’re a dirty secret, as a society.”
Draco is about to start listing them, but then Potter displays some fiendishly clever distraction skills when he slips one warm hand beneath Draco’s sweater and lays it on Draco’s lower back. Draco shudders involuntarily.
“Ready?” he asked, and when Draco nodded, they opened the letter together.
Granger breathed and looked suitably impressed.
Harry cleared his throat again. “I wouldn't mind being friends, actually. If you want.”
He was acting like a teenager with his first crush, and it was beyond embarrassing.
Madame Chastel.
Malfoy looked at his watch, a sleek silver piece with black and gold threaded around the face, forming a delicate snake. “I only have seven minutes before I have to meet my nanny, and I don’t much look forward to getting reprimanded today. But sure. What do you need?”
Potter had the gall to look confused. “To what?”
“Bullshit you don’t. The other Slytherins-”
“There is nothing left in there except for clocks and instruments to
“One of the old ladies from the bus.”
“Who’s it from?” a nosy first-year asked, making him glance up.
“Don't hurt me tonight,” he requested shakily. “I couldn't stand it.”
“Malfoy,” Potter replied evenly. “What are you doing here?”
Draco tried to ignore the tingling sensation the single word caused to run up his spine.
“Heard you and Granger were arguing?”
“Of course. I’ll leave it on the table under a stasis charm, shall I? It’d be a shame if it were to go soggy.”
Draco knew all of that, but he couldn’t deny it helped a bit to hear it from someone else as well. “Thanks. It’s just…she was so young. It’s hitting me harder than usual.”
“How did talking to Cristina go?” Harry asked once Parvati had finally dried her eyes and seemed able to focus on something other than his unexpected reappearance. “Did you learn anything that might help?”
He was so angry. He was so
They didn’t talk about Sirius in the same way they didn’t talk about any of the people they’d lost. He was present, like Remus, Tonks, Ted, and Bellatrix were present. It was hard to imagine Bellatrix with a family, especially with Andromeda as family. She was so different, he sometimes forgot she’d left that life.
“You seem surprised, Mr. Potter,” Kamau said slowly.
Harry felt like his mind was sinking down the back of his spine. A slow, inevitable plummet into that cavern of darkness which had opened up inside him two weeks ago.
Harry started as Ron snapped his fingers in front of his face.
it doesn’t mean I’m going to let someone get away with that shite while I’m standing here.”
, and it filled him with panic at the idea that he was so woefully unworthy of the job of protecting him.
“Yes.”
“Why didn’t you talk—”
He thought of Dumbledore’s obsession with the Deathly Hallows, the deaths of his parents, his little sister. How this must have been his ultimate goal, to bring someone back. To bring his sister back after he—or Grindelwald, had killed her. He would have wanted this desperately. The secret of resurrection. Of returning life.
Harry only half-listened to Bill make pleasant, mostly one-sided conversation as they made their way to the Leaky Cauldron. The night was warm and Harry had his coat and robes bundled up under his arm, but he still felt a lingering chill at the back of his neck, like someone was watching him. Or like he was aware of the Ministry he’d left behind, the building itself like a crouching dragon, waiting to swallow him if he ever went back.
Robards didn’t look at all disturbed, but nodded. “It seems whatever magic you performed, your wand didn’t register it. I’m inclined to believe Ms. Kamau, that it was simply an act of unconscious, uncontrolled magic.”
No. Bullocks.”
Daphne remained, regarding Harry like he was about to attack her. “Potter,” she nodded, eyes flicking again to Hermione, “Granger.”
He thought about going to Ron and Hermione. He wanted to. To explain everything he had seen in the pensieve, how Snape had loved his mother and that was why he’d betrayed Voldemort. How Dumbledore had known all along that he was a horcrux. To fill in the gaps they deserved after the last year, the last seven years, really.
Hermione grabbed his upper arm so hard he nearly yelped.
Draco’s eyes were wide in horror. They were fixed on Bellatrix’s body. His mouth was open as if he had only now realized what he’d done. The grip on his wand grew slack, hand shaking as it dropped a few inches in the air. He took a step back, seemed to lose his footing.
my parents. Stealing my title as best Gryffindor seeker in a hundred years. Very rude, you know.” Charlie grinned and winked. “If I were a lesser man, I’d be jealous.”
Bill looked around, making sure there was no one listening in, but the Leaky Cauldron was mostly empty now, only a group of witches in the corner who seemed sloshed out of their minds.
Black hair. Handsome, pale face. Still in his school clothes.
He managed to get off the path, realizing only too late that he’d left Goyle’s wand in plain sight. Hopefully if any muggles did pass by they’d think it was a stick. And then they’d see the blood and maybe mistake it for water.
possess him, even if it was excruciating, even if he couldn’t bear whatever Dumbledore’d meant by Harry
Later, when he was lying awake in Ron’s room, staring at the Chudley Canons poster stuck to the slanting wall over his head and trying not to hear the small, soft sounds of crying a few floors below, he wondered if he wasn’t the smallest, most pathetic excuse for human being who had ever lived.
Bill shook his head, mouth tight. “I heard people talking about it a few weeks ago but I never thought they’d actually go through with it. Hogwarts has never closed down.”
As if experiencing a phantom pain he felt the echo of Voldemort’s outrage before his scream pierced the chaos, causing everyone except Harry to flinch. Knowing instinctively where he was, Harry whirled around in time to cast a Shield Charm before Voldemort’s curse hit Hermione and Neville.
A soft pop of noise signaled Kreacher’s arrival. “Master Harry is wanting dinner? Kreacher is not wanting to disturb Master while he is reading so intently, but Mistress Andromeda—”
“Are you planning on telling anyone else?”
“Thank you both for telling me how terrible I look. It’s nice to know after all we’ve been through we still make an effort to be kind to each other.”
boy?” a horrible, rasping voice spat into the courtyard. It sent a shard of fury into Harry’s heart. The sharp click of heels punctuated Bellatrix’s outrage as she continued, “You should be prostrate at his feet! You
Her hand lingered on Harry’s cheek as she studied him. They stood in silence for a while. Harry kept looking into her eyes expecting to see someone else looking back at him. But it was just her. Just Andromeda Tonks. A woman who had lost her husband and daughter, a woman whose family had turned their backs on her. Someone else without a family.
angry. He didn’t know how to be anything but angry and hurting and he
“I won’t be working with the Ministry anymore,” Harry said. “I think it best if I keep my distance. I’ve got no interest in being a public figure or a mascot. I realize there’s little I can do to keep out of the papers, but I don’t want anyone in the Ministry thinking they can use my voice to win points or influence opinion.” A knot formed in his throat, but he forced it down. “You’ve got a lot of work to do, and I want no part in it. I know you’re trying—” He faltered, exhaling as he pushed his hair back where it’d got caught in the wind. “I hope you change things. I really do, but I need— I can’t be what you want me to be and I’m not interested in trying right now. Maybe ever.”
Malfoy’s eyes dropped to the ground at Harry’s feet, halting the confusing train of Harry’s thoughts. His mouth twitched into a smile which looked almost unconscious—a smile Harry could never remember seeing on Malfoy’s face before. He straightened and slid his hands into his pockets, a mirror of Harry’s own posture, and made to turn only to stop and glance at Harry again. It was all so casual, so simple, but Harry felt the intention, the performance, behind every movement. His eyes held on Harry’s face before they flicked down the length of his body in an obvious inspection. Harry’s chest filled with buzzing, like a beehive had woken up in his ribcage—violent and heady and strangely exhilarating. Malfoy met his gaze again, brow lifted, and tipped his head in what looked like the smallest gesture of approval.
of them weren’t death eaters, but their kids are still being treated like war criminals. Proulx suggested it, I think, but the new Head of Magical Law Enforcement agreed. She was the one who made sure Hogwarts closed. So it’s not even from the outside. It’s our own people putting those bleeding cuffs on those kids. Treating them like—”
“I don’t, actually.”
“Actually, I’m glad I caught you,” Bill said with a sheepish yet still charming smile. “You mind if I get your opinion on something, while you’re here?”
Hermione thought he was under some kind of enchantment.
It wasn’t until he started looking through the books himself, following Regulus’s process as he tried to understand what Voldemort was doing, that he started to learn how a horcrux was formed.
“Let me wrap up your ribs, at least. Then I’ll get to work on something for your hand.” She frowned. “I’m pretty sure I still have some Skele-Gro left—”
Ginny’s breath grew ragged and Harry hated himself because he knew she was crying. Ginny, who hadn’t cried when he’d broken things off after Dumbledore’s funeral, when he’d said goodbye to her in this room before Bill and Fleur’s wedding. He was the reason for her pain, again, and he couldn’t justify it this time. He didn’t have to go off and kill a dark wizard and save the world. He had his whole life now, to figure this out. He had no excuse not to be with her.
talking about it?”
Malfoy’s name made his stomach knot. He had thought about the git more than he would have liked over the summer, unable to forget that horrible expression on his face the last time Harry had seen him.
If anything, he hated himself more for understanding it so thoroughly.
Harry stared. “Lycanthropy? Is that even possible if you’re not—a werewolf?” He looked at Bill in alarm, but all he got was a wry smile in reply.
The stupid thing was that there was no reason to be nervous. He was just answering questions. He wasn’t accused of anything, he didn’t need to defend himself. He was going to the Ministry for the first time as an actual guest, not someone wanted for performing underage magic. There was no pressing matter of life and death which needed to be resolved. He was a witness. That was all. He might not even need to testify in front of the full council.
“Gracemorrow Cottage in Binsey,” Harry coughed, something came loose in his chest , “Oxford.”
A hum of pleasure echoed through his mind.
“Like you said,” Harry finally muttered, hands clenched in his pockets. “I’ve got morals.”
One of the other Slytherin girls had joined her, speaking softly. Harry recognized her at once. Daphne Greengrass’s hand hovered over Edlefina’s shoulder as she gave Harry a small, tight smile. Her auburn hair was tucked up into a neat bun, her robes austere and fine. She looked far older than she had the last time Harry’d seen her.
“Yeah.”
“Kreacher is sorry,” he said, his low voice rougher and more gravelly than normal, “so sorry, Master.” The elf picked himself up gingerly, looking around like he didn’t know where he was.
He might have stood there staring at the floor for hours, if another weird
that.” He was crying now as the whole ugly knot of words untangled and sprang out of his lips like Devil’s Snare, Hermione’s face blurring as the feeling burrowed deep into his brain and screamed at him to run,
“No, I don’t think so, Bill. You’re right, he’s been cooperating, but I don’t know if his goodwill reaches that far. I don’t want to push and scare him. He’s too much of an asset to lose right now while we’re still trying to round up the rest of Voldemort’s followers. Maybe, once we know more about what happened…”
Harry scowled, choosing not to answer. He didn’t look away either. It left him and Malfoy just staring at each other.
“I was—her husband, Remus, was…” Harry swallowed as heat rose up his throat. He blinked furiously, trying not to start crying again. “He was good friends with my dad, and he taught me at school. We were—close.”
His hand was shaking around his wand—
Also, he suspected they weren’t too happy with him right now in any case. He’d asked Hermione for time. Maybe they needed time too.
He fought the urge to scowl. “I told you exactly how I felt a week ago. I haven’t stopped thinking what they’re doing is wrong. So yeah, I thought people should know what the Ministry’s trying to do.” He knew it was a low blow, but he added, “I thought of anyone you’d understand needing to tell people the truth.”
He’d been running his thumb over his wand, the little groove in the wood where he’d mended it with the Elder Wand—when he felt something splinter ever so slightly.
But they didn’t
the war, though?” Harry asked. “Seems like we could have used the help a year ago. Now it’s just a slap in the face, isn’t it? ‘Sorry about all those people who died, but here are a few aurors who can come in and start telling you how to punish your own bloody citizens.’ ”
After what felt like an hour, Kingsley nodded, his dark eyes unreadable. “I understand.”
Harry tried to find his voice. He didn’t know why Malfoy knowing about the Elder Wand changed anything. He didn’t think Malfoy would try to kill him now, not after he’d gone to all the trouble of saving his life.
“Yeah. Sorry, Kreacher.” Harry grimaced and stepped up to the desk, hoping it was sturdier than it looked. “I’ll—I’d be happy to look through this stuff.”
She pulled him after her with a strength Harry was startled by, too surprised to do anything more than follow. She slammed open one of the private toilets, shoved Harry inside, and pulled it shut behind her.
“Maybe we should all sit down,” Bill said after another tense moment, hands still resting on Harry’s shoulders.
Of course, if they were in a position to tell him what they thought, he wouldn’t have gone through a war and learned exactly what it felt like when your protectors failed you.
“You mean the aunt who tortured Neville’s parents, killed Sirius, and carved a slur into Hermione’s arm?” Harry watched Ron’s conflicted guilt morph back into stubborn defiance. “You’re gonna call me out for defending Slytherins and in the same breath—”
what I’m going through. You couldn’t.”
Heart beating fast, Harry looked back to the book and this time he could clearly see all the writing even with his glasses. On a hunch, he flipped back a bit, noticing details he hadn’t before, connecting diagrams with symbols and text, patterns where there had only been confusion. It was as if those three words had been a cipher, and now that he had the secret he could begin to understand the rest of the book.
“—pint after, yeah? Harry?”
“Well,” Harry said to himself, frowning, “not sure what I expected.”
Hermione crouched in the corner of what was once the Entrance Hall, one hand shoved into the Sorting Hat. Ron wasn’t with her, lost somewhere in the fighting. Harry caught sight of a slither of emerald green weaving through the fighters, heard Voldemort’s voice shout in Parseltongue, “
“Percy’s been handling a lot of the finer details,” Bill said, nodding in greeting with a warning smile to a few people in bright green robes who stopped and pointed at Harry. “He’s one of the only people in the administration who stayed on and isn’t on trial.”
He’d seen Malfoy less than an hour ago. Was it less than an hour? It couldn’t have been that long ago…
He clenched his jaw and met her gaze. “Move out of the way, Hermione.”
But as far as he knew, Malfoy had been the only death eater still under age during the war. And Malfoy had very openly defected before the end.
“That’s enough, Mr.—”
For some reason, he wanted this to go well. He didn’t care about anyone else, but…
“SHUT UP,” Harry screamed, throat burning as the fire caught and raged behind his eyes. “Shut the
Harry blinked. He certainly seemed to be feeling worse than normal, but Harry’s normal wasn’t exactly healthy either.
Harry waited to feel guilty but it never came. He just held Robards’s gaze. “Are you going to tell Yeats, then?”
Leaning over with his elbows on his knees, Malfoy was frozen. Staring into space with vacant, unmoving eyes. His long body folded over, almost hunched. The same hollow, lost look when he had walked down to Voldemort in the courtyard.
This was stupid. So fucking stupid. He didn’t want to fight anymore, not even with Malfoy.
He forced himself back to the present. It might be hard to see the resemblance to her sisters when she was laughing but sometimes he felt like he was staring into the same face reflected three times, all of them complicating until he was unsure what to feel.
Hermione squeezed his hand. “Things will get better, I promise. You two love each other, you have for so long. Give it some time, all right? I’m sure you’ll make it work again.”
Harry had made sure not to mention Malfoy, or even allude to him, and Lovegood hadn’t included his name, or any names, in the piece. He knew it was likely Malfoy’d be angry at him, but he didn’t care. Harry hadn’t done it because of him. Not entirely, anyway.
“Mr. Malfoy is due to check in with his probation auror at seven,” the auror said. “I was merely arriving to escort him.”
His heart was beating hard—he felt like he was hurtling forward, thrown toward a barrier he knew was coming but couldn’t see.
Breathing hard on the other side of the kitchen, Harry smoothed his hair back from his forehead. The room fell silent except for the faint shifting of leaves, like it was sitting outside and stirred by a soft wind. The smell—heady and smoky, with a deep, almost familiar sweet spice he could feel on his tongue—wafted through the room and Harry swore he could almost hear tinkling bells.
The slash of white disappeared behind a door. Harry ran, wanting to cry out but afraid that if he opened his mouth he wouldn’t be able to close it again. He’d drown in that oozing black. He held out his hand—white light seared into him, cracked his palm open.
“The fuck was that, Potter?” Malfoy spat, voice low but still echoing through the broken castle.
ANYWAY I love you all very much and thank you for being so wonderful in your comments, I know I'm kind of plodding along with this fic right now but I'm hoping to finish drafting the thing by the end of the month and then I can start posting a hell of a lot faster. there are just a lot of moving pieces and I want to make sure things are cohesive-ish.
Of course.
Bill gripped the back of his neck and rose to kiss his forehead. It felt like he wanted to give Harry a hug, but was holding himself back so as not to hurt Harry. “You’re all right,” he murmured, and if Harry hadn’t already been crying he would have started then. “You’ll be all right, Harry.”
“I told you to reply sooner. You can’t let her build up steam or you’re going to start getting howlers.”
Still, Dumbledore had been right about Malfoy, in the end. He had turned. He had helped Harry. He had nearly died himself more than once.
Harry could actually hear Dumbledore’s voice in his ear, that soft, patient voice, a voice Harry had clung to for so long because it was the only thing he had, the only thing he could trust.
him? To destroy his home? He’d only had the flat for three weeks. Three weeks.
After three days he felt ready to start experimenting. He began with a rotting plant Kreacher had produced from some corner of the house Harry had never seen. He trusted when Kreacher told him it wasn’t dangerous, that it had been a gift from Walburga to her husband in the final years of their lives. A special kind of flower Kreacher didn’t know the name of, which apparently only grew on the slopes of a mountain in Bulgaria.
anything…
Harry said nothing, properly chastised. Felicity gave a small, awkward cough. Kamau was still watching Harry like he was a puzzle she couldn’t quite figure out.
“Draco Malfoy has also been cooperating with the Aurors’ Office to search his family estate for powerful dark artifacts left over from Voldemort’s occupation, and to bring in any death eaters who fled after the final battle at Hogwarts.” Robards watched Harry’s reaction closely. “Based on your foreknowledge and current opinion of his motivations, would you characterize this aid as genuine?”
“Er, sorry.” Harry scratched his head. “I could have sworn those were the tree ones.”
“Mate, I really don’t know-”
“Malfoy, I have the Elder Wand. I will obliterate the fucking wards on your house and apparate straight into your bedroom if I have to.”
If Malfoy knew what it depicted, it wouldn’t have made sense for him to hang the painting in his office unless he simply hadn’t been worried about people’s reactions.
The numbers changed.
Even if Harry had known what to say to this, he couldn’t have managed to because Draco was too busy doubling over with laughter. “Oh Merlin,” he howled when he finally managed to draw breath, “oh Merlin, ‘your shortsighted decision which you are sure to regret’. That’s some bona fide optimism right there.”
“I’d let you.”
“Our apologies,” said Harry and dragged Draco over to the stool, murmuring, “If she thought the
Draco regretted the words as soon as they had left his mouth, but Potter surprised him by laughing like he found it genuinely funny.
keep telling yourself that, it’s driving me bonkers.” Pansy reached for a dahlia and plucked it out of its arrangement. “I’m taking this as compensation.”
The woman who waited for him was pale, red-haired, and completely unfamiliar until he’d invited her into the lab for privacy, like she’d requested. By the time he’d closed the door and turned toward her, she had taken the glamour off.
“What complicates things is the fact that I don’t know if it was the poison that caused you to be unconscious when you came through the Veil. I’ll have to run some tests and equations later, when I’m back in the lab.”
“Happy Christmas,” Draco told her and held out a cracker for her to pull. One agonizingly shrill
“I can’t think of what that obvious thing would be. You’ve covered everything I’d have thought of and more.”
“Is there a rhyme or reason for placing those as you did?” Blaise asked. “The green ones, I mean. Obviously, they’re not following the same pattern as the other two.”
“Why don’t you three start pulling a few crackers while I assemble the deserts?” Hermione suggested and raised her wand. “Someone monitor the noise-dampening charm though, please. I am
Pansy was silent for a moment, studying his face. Then, she said, “Potter saw it, didn’t he? Last time you were this emotional was when you overheard him agreeing to go out with that utter twat from the Spirit Division.”
“Probably better,” Draco agreed, but he sounded distracted as he stared at the letter. “What the fuck?” he said then.
“Do you really think we’d attack you?” he asked, surprised and almost a little bit hurt. He supposed he couldn’t blame her for not fully trusting him, but he had expected her to trust the friends she met for dinner at least twice a month.
Draco frowned at him suspiciously. “You just made that up.”
“What do you need?” Harry asked.
“Have you asked anyone else about it?”
"Oh Merlin, now you two tossers have joined forces."
"Voldemort couldn't make me use the killing curse, but you lot might actually manage."
With all those secret, personal things Potter knew about him already, it made little sense to lie.
“Still.”
“I don’t want to go anywhere,” Draco groaned. “I’m bloody tired!”
“Accio
From the corner of his eye, he watches Draco mix his batter with determination. The two of them had talked the evening before, as they’d returned to their common room after dinner.
was up to.
"Ron, play nice.” Hermione elbowed him hard enough to hopefully cause bruises.
“Can we eat these ones?” Molly eagerly reaches out, takes one of the leaves tumbling in the breeze, and pops it in her mouth. “Oh, it’s made of dried apple, such a nice idea. And the pumpkin?”
The snowman in the telephone box kept smiling cheerfully.
“Almost?” Ron splutters, offended, Harry guesses, on general principle.
“I didn’t know what the spell would do,” Potter said quickly. He looked Severus directly in the eyes, as though trying to underline the truth of his words.
Although Harry was very much counting on the fact that his chosen style made the identities of the men impossible to determine with certainty.
Granger’s eyes had gone large and round. “That’s brilliant,” she said. “Oh, that is
, Harry had told him once,
Draco kept pounding, eyes firmly on his work. He didn’t want to think about Harry’s words. It was no use to go back to what they had, only to have to go through this same pain again when it ended. He would have to stand firm.
it. It’s…scary.”
“I as well.” With a decisive swipe of her wand, she severed his hood entirely, and Draco wanted to cry. “But as for what we talked about, she told me all about her vacation, and then she mentioned visiting her aunt later in the day – she’s in the Janus Thickey Ward, you see. Ah, I recall now, that’s when she started shivering. Must have reminded her she’s got Mumblemumps, talking about St Mungos. We didn’t stay on the topic long, it’s really rather depressing, and Miss Brown said she was not feeling well and left soon after. That was probably for the best.”
“Yeah,” Granger said quietly next to him.
“It’s
“Well, we aren’t eliminated yet, so calm down, will you?”
“Wonder how Penelope figured out it must have been Sylvana,” Hermione mused.
Draco did not answer until the last bead of Coradine Silver was properly cushioned and inside the warded case. He closed it with a flick of his wand and turned around.
“Hello,” said a young woman with pink hair and cheekbones that many would have killed for. She was holding the missive they had just sent, still sealed. “Um…how can I help?” She sounded confused.
“I really am sorry,” Potter continued. “I had no idea it was all still so raw for you. I suppose I should have…I never really thought about it.”
“What was the name of the Auror who did that, ma’am?” Draco asked. It wasn’t why he was here, but he was not above a bit of petty revenge on other people’s behalf, and he knew without even looking that Potter was outraged over the treatment as well. Besides, Clara had kindly served them tea and scones with clotted cream - that was not the sort of woman anyone should be able to get away with shouting at for no good reason.
Prompt #9 – Chestnuts roasting over a fire
As soon as he could, he got to his feet and stumbled out of the room and past Clearwater, who called his name, sounding puzzled. Left, left again, then on his right the door to Granger’s office. He burst through the door without knocking and stared at a surprised Potter, who’d frozen right in the middle of airing out his bedding.
“Yes! Yes, that. Have we stopped?” He looked around wildly.
“Someone could see,” Draco finally breathed when they separated, shaking a little bit.
“Harry?”
“What now?” Draco asked warily.
Draco suddenly felt the chill on his skin despite the charm. “Do you think that’s what’ll happen?” he asked. “Once he wakes up?”
Draco was silent as she led him out his front door and down the street. His mind was racing. He kept wanting to explain, didn’t know how to start, ran through possibilities and ingredient combinations in his head.
Draco nodded, and Blaise turned to leave.
“She called June a gold-digger. It’s not true, of course, but…how is this relevant?”
“Honestly, I don’t see how that will help.”

Prompt #19 – "Love" spelled in candy canes
Weasley’s eyes widened. “You mean you…you lost the baby?”
“Hermione could probably tell stories for hours about how oblivious and inconsiderate and thoughtless I can be. I…Malfoy?”
Granger gazed up at him and blinked several times. Then she said, “Sorry. Yes, of course you can use the left arm. It’s just, I kept thinking of you as a potioneer who happens to work at a hospital. I’m feeling like a right tit because obviously you
A lot of flowers.
“Give us a few minutes before coming back,” Draco said.
“Great,” said Potter, “now that that’s cleared up, do you know where Hermione is?”
“Hank is right,” Draco agreed. He was using every opportunity to say the name he’d chosen for Potter’s disguise, mostly because it annoyed Potter to such a delightful degree. “This sort of behaviour is outrageous.”
Draco prayed Potter would just say yes and go away already. And someone up there seemed to be listening for once, because a moment later he heard the scraping of chair legs, and Potter's deep sigh. “All right. Fine.”
