"For Merlin's sake Potter wake up!"
“If you’re gonna do the ‘how many fingers am I holding up?’ I swear I’ll-“
“They’re down there already, catching up on some notes and practicing. You know how they are.” He nodded.
He felt lightheaded and heavy at the same time. Every word had hit it. His brain felt like a hailstorm, words like pebbles of rain racing around his mind, battering against the walls of his head. He faintly heard someone knocking at the door of the classroom but he didn't care. He couldn't breath.
“Nice going ‘Drako’, never knew you had it in you.” Blaise slid up beside Draco and elbowed him suggestively. Draco scowled at him.
“Wait, summoning ghosts?” Draco asked them to clarify.
I snort out loud at that thought and attract a curious glance from Ron and Hermione.
"Hey Draco!" He greeted. "What's it like being a Ravenclaw?"
Potter.
Draco is caught reading in the library, Hermione swears for the first time, and Octavia doesn’t know how to deal with the drama around her.
“I-I don’t know actually.” He mumbled. “It’s probably nothing, I don’t know why I think it’s such a big deal, I’m probably just being weird.”
All Octavia could detect from Draco’s gaze was how truly glued it was to Harry Potter.
“I thought you’d prettied yourself up for the Beauxbatons boys?” Octavia asked, grabbing one of Martha’s self made ringlets.
How the boys are handling sharing a room.
“It doesn’t matter anyway, I’m beautiful. Some could mistake me for a Veela.”
After tiring themselves out, they eased into chatting among themselves, trying to learn more about one another. Draco learnt that Michael was from a very conservative Halfblood family, and was constantly in the shadow of his younger brothers. Michael didn't seem to mind, because as a young boy the pressure had apparently been suffocating. Even though his family lived in Scotland, his parents were planning to send his younger brother's off to Durmstrang, leaving Michael at Hogwarts by himself. He seemed happy as he explained this, saying that his brothers were "nothing more than pompous twits that think the world revolves around them."
“I prefer to affiliate myself with Slytherins, Ravenclaws if I must.” Draco said with an air of pompousness. Viktor only tilted his head.
This lesson was less eventful than the previous ones. After everyone was seated, Professor McGonagall gave them all a strict talking to, one with significantly less flair than Snape, but with no less fear and respect from the students. After her short but sweet introduction, she turned her desk into a pig. Unfortunately, none of the students would be doing any furniture-into-animal transitions anytime soon. They had to make numerous complex notes on the topic, most of which Draco could already cite off by heart, and were given a match to turn into a needle.
“Looks like you have nothing to lose then. Come on, we don’t have to be “Bestest Friends’ or whatever,” Draco grimaced, “but we just won’t be arch rivals anymore.” Draco bit his lip in thought. “Come on. Truce?”
“Yeah, my older brother Draco. He’s in fourth year and really good at magic. So, you know, he can help me.”
His voice was caught in his throat and he realised he was unable to speak.
The Sorting Ceremony. 1st September 1991
"It's taken a while to find you. For some reason I was the only one who noticed the library's counter still said that there was a person inside." She mentioned as they walked.
I tumbled out of bed and onto the floor blindly, the sun streaming through the window not helping one bit. From the carpet I grasped at my dresser, squinting angrily when I couldn't locate my glasses. I heard a soft snort from across the room.
“I know.”
"Huh?" Harry asked, cocking his head. "Isn't Ravenclaw the smart house? Why would he be mad?"
“And I swear,” Pansy put a hand in front of Potters face, “I don’t care! Why are you here. Drakey, why is he here?” She asked him and Draco took another sip of his wine.
Draco sighed.
“Take a look at the paper Weasley,” he snatched it out of Blaise’s grip to brandish it, “your dad has a front page feature.”
“Breakfast?” Potter asked and Draco nodded.
“Diggory! As in Cedric Diggory?” Blaise exclaimed, aghast.
-matter-of-factly. He looked at Blaise’s face. Blaise had really long eyelashes. Draco told him as much.
Leave a kudo, a comment on your feelings, how you’re doing this spooky month, any constructive criticisms, or any prompts! I am very open to prompts!
This was very contrary to the other three tables, all filled with sadness and anger. This tournament may have been started to promote school unity, but it may destroy any semblance of house unity in the process. Many Slytherins were cursing at the table and each other, feeling the verdict to be very unfair. Some even seemed to be plotting Diggory’s death, and they couldn’t be the only ones.
"Rule Number 12; A Pureblood is always calm and collected. Rule Number 13; A Pureblood child must be seen and not heard. Rule Number 14; A Pureblood is well educated. Rule Number 15; When one is of age, a Pureblood will court another Pureblood of the opposite gender and will create a heir between them. Rule Number 16; A Pureblood is punctual and never late. Rule Number.."
In the hallway of the train, Draco walked. He wasn't looking for anything or anyone, he just wanted to get away from that awful Weasley. So lost in his own thoughts, Draco almost fell over a student who was crouched down on the floor.
“I don’t think of you much Potter, going to be honest. But I do think that you’re being far too loud for someone wandering the hallways at night.” He pulled his hand back. “Now as entertaining as watching you being distressed is, I did not sign up to be your Mind Healer.” Potter scowled.
“Always scheming you Slytherins.”
“Misunderstood antagonism?”
“We did! It was all incroyablement effrayant!” She waved some more Beauxbatons girls over to her. “Filles,  c'est le gentil garçon! Ze one I told you all about, from ze Cup!” Immediately many French girls surrounded him, clucking and pecking at him.
“Sure.”
"Eh, personally I think the so-called sentience is a bit over exaggerated. It can only sing after all. I know of plenty of brainless singers. C'mon, Celestina Warbeck?" Neville laughed at that.
Comments always encourage me to work harder and continue writing, so if you can please share your thoughts on the chapter!
They continued walking in silence until they reached the dorms and the little snake things they had to talk to.
"Since I was seven Mother wanted me to learn about the inner workings of the ministry so I'd know how to get the best jobs. Father taught me how to infiltrate the archives to rise to power quicker and/or change any laws for the Malfoy's benefit. He wasn't just a good politician, he also knew people who could make things happen." He shrugged again.
“Yes but you’re the one that blows it up out of proportion-“
"Who are these guys?" Octavia asked him.
“What is Parkinson dressed as?” Potter asked him after taking a disgusted sip of his wine. Draco sipped his leisurely.
"That sounds nice. Maybe an Eighth and Seventh year bonfire on the grounds."
"Hiya Harry, how's it goin' mate?" Seamus asked me with an awkward one armed hug.
And this is where Draco Malfoy lived for nearly 18 years of his life.
They all bid him goodbye and ONCE AGAIN he had to re-adjust his jumper and brush himself off. His skin was writhing. He met the gaze of the golden trio who were standing there, staring at him. His shoulders hunched up in embarrassment an he scowled at them.
Unfortunately, the hilarious moment was rudely interrupted by Dumbledore welcoming the other schools and introducing the two impartial judges; Ludo Bagman and...Bartemius Crouch.
“That’s exactly the look we’re going for! You get it.” She beamed up at Potter and Draco supposed that was Pansy won over. Only took a couple of minutes and collective Draco teasing for it to happen.
“I suppose I did. Father would be pr-“ at a look from Pansy he sighed at corrected himself. “
He looks up at Potter’s face. It’s hopeful and nice and stupidly so. It’s so genuine it hurts.
"My brother's said that Professor Snape is terrible, and that he's always upset and very dramatic. My sister's said that he's fine, but my brothers say that's just because of Slytherin favouritism. Christopher's in Gryffindor and says that Snape HATES Gryffindor with a burning passion. Don't know why though." Terry added as they jogged to the dungeons.
“He. Did. WHAT?!” Octavia yelled, trembling slightly in anger. “I’m going to kill him. I’m going to kill him and make it look like a BLOODY ACCIDENT!” Her yelling was drawing attention from others in the dorm, but Octavia didn’t care.
“I didn’t get any today. It’s odd, mother’s usually never off kilter.” He muttered, and Octavia rolled her eyes.
if you've a ready mind,
“Dressed like what?” Draco tried to deflect, before realising that sounded worse.
“Oh...brilliant...just what I wanted...” Potter says, only making it more difficult for Draco to conceal his laughter.
Thinking fast, he cast a spell on the door, causing it to violently fling back into place, nearly hitting the intruder. Using that as a distraction, Draco jumped out from behind the drawer and ran at the intruder, pinning them to the wall with a wand at their throat.
I hope you enjoyed all of that! What was Draco leaning on, or who 👀
“Don’t call me that. And I’m fine.”
Draco smiled onto Blaise’s mouth and chuckled. Blaise hooked his arms round his head and tugged lightly at Draco’s blonde locks. He bit Blaise’s lip in surprise and whimpered. This really was fantastic!
"I was going to study in the library to catch up, but it seems my talents are needed elsewhere. Your welcome Potter, for my courteous nature in helping the less fortunate. I'll even have to use glamours to disguise myself, all in order to help you. You better be grateful, you realize," He started emptying all the books from his satchel and instead put in a satchel of money.
“Don’ ee ‘ave clath doday?” Vince asked, walking out of the bathroom with a toothbrush in his mouth.
Please leave a kudo and a comment, they are so appreciated! What you thought of this chapter, constructive criticisms, and any mini one shot ideas you’d like me to add to another fic I am welcome to! Have a great one, until the next chapter!
“This is bleeding incredible! You’re bloody brilliant, you are!” Martha exclaimed and giggled. Danny looked to Octavia for a similar reaction.
"I uh, I um, went shopping." Ron looked at me questioningly.
Draco walked out into the hallway and (surprising himself) decides to knock on the side of the open door to the Gryffindor cart.
Still, to show support, he caught her eye and gave her a big thumbs up, and saw Neville mirror his motion from behind. Neville stood to attention as soon as Professor McGonagall called out, "Longbottom, Neville!"
“She had a little go at me beforehand for my use of the ‘
” He heard himself scream out loud and he jerked his arm away, spilling an inkwell all over himself. He gasped as he felt the curse let go of him. He looked upwards, ignoring the stares of his classmates, to Professor Moody.
“Serious talk.” Draco finishes. “You rouse each other up. I’m sure if you give him a bit of time and apologise it’ll be fine.” Draco squeezes her shoulder.
He was supposed to though, they were both meant to like each other, and Pansy did for a couple of years. She’d gotten over him in early on however, and their friendship only grew stronger.
“How come? That’s age-ist!” He told him and he heard Blaise and Pansy stifle a laugh.
"Goddamit first years! I've been trying to drink from my goblet for the past two minutes! Stop slamming the table!" Meredith's voice carried down with a chorus of agreements.
Vince ushered Greg out of the room quickly, leaving together. Octavia wanted to leave with them but the shock hadn’t subsided.
“Who would want to dress like a mutt?” He said. Octavia rolled her eyes.
“Well you’re not a Lestrange.” Kreacher hummer. “Perhaps a Black. Your mother was.”
Pine green.
“Ugh, I hate him! He’s such a pompous jerk! And now he’s going to try out for Hogwarts Champion? As I’ve said before, I would make a far better contestant!”
“Okay, maybe weird vibes IS how I look at my friends, but Vince isn’t the incredible Blaise Zabini or a common slag like Pansy,” Draco hit him on the pec, “Vince is just Vince. And Vince is totally into Greg.”
A dingy and colourful little room. Three sofas were in front of him, and a window straight ahead. Through the window was... grass. And trees. A lot of bright colours that he only thought existed in storybooks.
After an hour of practice and a simplified explanation of the theory between wood and metal from Draco, nearly everyone had managed to turn their matchstick into what could properly resemble a needle. This was far more difficult than charms, and had everyone tired with the effort. The only one to not manage it was Michael, who'd accidentally melted his matchstick in a move that Draco didn't even want to dwell on. This magic relied far more on control and concentration for only one thing, something that Michael lacked in buckets.
worked.
He would like curly hair. Or at least hair that wasn't supposed to be slicked back all the time. He thinks it made him look like his father, and it gave him terrible cow licks after he washed the gel out. He preferred Narcissa's long hair to Lucius'. It was lovelier, less harsh and perfect.
He turned back to see horror dawn on Potter’s face. Draco grinned.
"Potter, that vault you saw  was probably only your trust fund. You most likely have multiple far larger ones, to do with products the Potters created, or families they might have married into, not even including the Peverell fortune they inherited. Fleamont Potter, your paternal grandfather, started up various companies, and amongst them was Sleekeazy's Hair Care and Scalp Treament, which quadrupled the Potter wealth before he sold the business, thus tripling your family fortune yet again. Although, the Potters were very honest and kind in their businesses, so they didn't earn as much as they could have, and were subsequently poorer than the Malfoys.
"Sure. Oh, and Harry Potter will be coming with us."
"Go on Weasel, tell us all how that makes Potter a poof, because now I'm very fucking curious you see." His voice took on a dangerous tilt. Ron's eyes flared up.
Blaise smirked. “Of course. Why didn’t I catch on sooner?”
Although Draco already knew quite a bit about Terry's family, he didn't know that his family had the bad luck of having three squib children. His older brother Nelson, his younger sister Mauve (though there was still time) and his cousin, one of the triplets, Barry. Apparently this didn't cause a lot tension and only opened the Pureblood family up to the muggle world a lot more. His brother Nelson worked at a popular muggle law firm in London.
“Um...” he tried to stall, but Potter had reached over already and was grabbing for the actual book. “Hey!” He tried to bat him away, but not before Potter reached his novel and opened it.
“But Draco,” Vince began, “you made friends with Viktor Krum.” Draco flushed happily again.
“Too late.”
He went to a corner of the pitch and tried to shoot upwards, high in the centre. The aim of the move was to fly as high as possible in the centre, take on leg and arm off of the broom as the broom goes vertical, then let it drop back down free fall for a bit until you mount yourself again.
“I agreed to the truce.”
The break was filled with desks being lifted and a couple of close calls. Michael wasn't the best at charms, and could only lift an inkwell, which he was very disappointed with. Neville had similar results, so they resigned themselves to discussing Herbology. Terry was quite good at Wingardium Leviosa, but didn't feel comfortable lifting anything heavier than a hardback book. Anthony and Hermione however...
"It was pretty good. Managed to get Potter a new wardrobe that isn't composed of disgusting tattered hand me downs. Would you like to help us burn them after tea?" She giggled.
Icarus was a fucking idiot anyway. Wax melts? Gee, what a shocker! That’s why you don’t take risks. That’s why you don’t fly close to the sun. You either get burnt or your wax wings melt. It’s not worth your time.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be staying with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter you lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop Chop!”
“Fucking fine then, be a bitch.” He muttered as he collected his school supplies in a satchel and walked out of the dorm.
The Great Hall burst into applause at it's finish and Draco couldn't help but do the same in sheer confusion. He heard a voice near the back start yelling a bit but it was shushed as quickly as it started. Professor McGonagall stepped forward holding a large roll of parchment.
“A...cheerleader?” He spat. She nodded with a smirk.
“Are you alright Drako?” He prodded her brother’s shoulder concernedly. That snapped him out of it.
“He’s obsessed.”
"Do you want to talk about it?" Harry's voice asked. Draco peeked over his legs and shook his head. Harry smiled awkwardly. "Okay then, that's cool. Can I ask a couple of questions, though? Just yes or no ones, so you can nod or shake your head, no speaking needed." Draco hesitantly gave a nod.
It had been a pretty big fight about coming back to Hogwarts, for all three of us. After Hermione had traveled to Australia to fix her parents with the help of a Healer, and had explained the situation to them after they remembered, they flipped out. They were so worried and scared for her and the danger she had put herself in that they nearly banned magic for her. She had to stay in Australia for another couple of days to console them, and then another couple of days to get them to agree to let her go back to Hogwarts for another year. They decided to stay in Australia for another couple of months to experience being out of the UK and she was happy with it f it meant that she could continue living in the wizarding world. She got off easy compared to Ron and I.
"In private." He saw Potter raise his eyebrows. He rolled his eyes skyward.
Blaise looked like he had been slapped in the face. Draco slowly took his hands away from his ears and stared at Pansy. Pansy looked the most shocked.
"Hogwarts Houses?" Harry asked.
If u saw spellibg errors no you didn’t
And it’s never going to be.
"Hi Draco." Harry greeted him with a smile as they entered their corner of the library.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “By yourself?”
“Here here.”
“They’re well written! The whole point of them is that they’re supposed to garner sympathy and emotional attachment from the reader!” He defended badly. Thank god the common room was empty.
"O-oh, right, that. Uh, I suppose my parents were magic but I was raised by my aunt and uncle. They're muggles." His parents 'were'? Ah, an orphan then. His parents probably died in the war.
"Hush now, your most attractive friend is telling a story. Anyway, our darling Drakey has decided to make the hilarious mistake to curlify his hair again."
The next curse mentioned was the Cruciatus curse. By Longbottom of all people. It made draco feel
Potter then did something stupid.
Moody went on to review their previous years, and how they were very behind on curses. At that, Draco heard some Slytherins scoff. Their tight knit group all had access to their many mansion’s libraries, all filled to him with text on curses and dark magic. Sure DADA helped in practicality and mindset, but little with teaching them spells they didn’t already know. Many already had a step above the other houses. No doubt the Ravenclaws did as well, but they probably weren’t as familiar with the Dark Arts as Slytherin was. Something to do with morality and whatnot.
This was fun to write and i hope you enjoy it!
--------------------------------------------
Draco was shaking. His hands were shaking. He clenched and unclenched his fists but it didn't help. He was still shaking.
As soon as the word was uttered Draco was leaning forward towards Blaise, eyes locked on his lips. His eyes began to flutter closed involuntarily as his head closed the gap between them.
SLYTHERIN!" It called out. She took off the hat happily and flounced off towards the Slytherin table. She could see and hear her brother cheering loudly for her, with a big gin on his face. He was using his hands to project louder as the whole friend group celebrated her sorting. she blushed happily at their support and sat down next to them as the rest of the first years were organised into their houses. She noticed the muggleborn boy Danny Keett, and one of the twins, Martha Robinson, were both sorted into Slytherin. Still, she sat next to the older years. That's where her brother was.
“Quite. I live fast.” She tossed her hair. “I’d also like to nab him before you steal him first.” She teased back. He went a bright shade of pink again, and internally she still swooned. Him being gay didn’t stop him being cute.
But he doesn’t. He doesn’t have the balls.
Immediately stars of all different sizes filled the ceiling above my bed, now having more than Malfoy did previously. I mumbled a "thanks" and watched as he nodded and returned back to bed.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I've been trying to create the #RavenclawBois personalities so I've added more interaction. I kind of wrote up a Comprehensive school shedule for Ravenclaw, and who they have it with, so if you're confused about the way the subjects are working or the order of everything, just know that I've taken it into my own hands for my sake and less confusion. JK Rowling introduced the subjects thematically. I do it according to whatever the schedule I wrote up says. boom. I am so tired it's 1am.
"May I introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher," Dumbledore introduced brightly, "Professor Moody."
“Conversus Animalis Mónimos.” Draco muttered and the pillow began to glow brightly. Sirius got out his wand in preparation for any freaky fucking thing this wandless magic kid was gonna transfigure.
"Welcome to Hogwarts." Mcgonogall's voice broke through the chatter. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room." This whole talk was simultaniously making Draco feel more excited and more nervous. He would be in Slytherin, and his father had already explained the way the dorms worked and how he would be at the top of the class hierarchy because of his family's wealth and prestige.
Draco pushed down the small, tiny, STUPID part of him that said it was nice to make Potter laugh. Because it wasn’t.
Pansy shook her head. “No, that’s just friends.” She dismissed. “But don’t worry, I’ll wait until you’re more grown up. It’s not your fault that girls mature faster than boys.”
“Incredibly spicy, that’s what I’ve been called. And kissable too. Everyone I’ve kissed has said so. They couldn’t wait to jump this, but I said no. I’m so attractive I’m worth everything. But I’m holding out for you Draco.” Blaise tried to bat his eyes flirtatiously but they got caught on still tears. “Fuck, I am so amazing you know?” Blaise cried a little bit. “I’m stunning.”
He’d only become better with age, and he’d finally began to stop wearing that ridiculous hair gel. He had grown much taller than her, and was beginning to lose quite a bit of that baby fat that stuck to his face for so long. Truly growing into the aristocratic look all of his family possessed.
"I need to talk to Potter."
"Oh, alright then, we'd better go! I want a seat at the front. Goodbye Draco, I'll see you in Charms!" Hermione waved him goodbye as she rushed off to class. Neville waved behind as well as followed after Hermione, at a bit of a slower pace.
“Oh my gosh, are you okay? What happened?” Martha came up to her and perched herself at the edge of Octavia’s bed.
By the time I was done with my brief modelling career, it was 7 o'clock.  I'd just finished changing back into my original clothes, and had walked back down the stairs into the common room. Ron was in one of the armchairs, with Hermione of his lap, weaving her fingers through his hair gently, both of them gently dozing.
She set down the plate of fairy cakes and Draco took one of the ones that had butterfly wings on it. He looked up at her cautiously as she ate one of her cakes.
"Don't be such an old man Michael, I've heard they're charmed to be safe," he looked up at Draco, "don't worry about Michael, he's just grumpy because he's tired."
Just in case.
Sirius attempted to cast a couple of shield shattering charms, but his tongue was tied for that. Draco mimed casting the counter jinx, and Sirius got the other boy to do it stubbornly. It didn't help his cause, as any jinxes and hexes he did cast didn't effect the shield.
He then reached down and picked up the surprisingly light boy and tossed his over one shoulder, securing a sack over his head just in case. The ugly pink cat jumped down from where it was held but followed Sirius obediently.
He couldn’t risk fire as the chair was made of wood, and he didn’t know whether the ropes were charmed for that stuff now. He couldn’t risk it.
The second time she asked him out was much the same, only far more heartbreaking.
End of story.
"Well last night we both decided to let go of our ridiculous rivalry in favour of a truce, and since we're dorming together he got right down to judging my wardrobe, and unfortunately I agree that I need some new stuff, so he's coming with me to Hogsmeade. He doesn't feel like getting recognised though," I gave them both the short explanation. At this point Malfoy started playing with Virgo being wrapped around his hand, looking uncharacteristically awkward.
It was nearly his 18th birthday, and according to the muggle novels he’d found under a mattress in one of the bedrooms, that was a very important birthday. You’d want a large celebration, a party, which you’d invite all of your...
SIBLING POV CHANGE
"Yeah, I appreciate it too. Makes for great comedy." I scowled. "You really should get some new glasses, those ones are rather hideous. Though I suppose they match the owner." My scowl deepened.
"Oh no, I'm rubbish at magic. I don't even know the wand movement." Neville looked sheepish.
“Don’t feel like racing with a sad little orphan tonight. I never signed up for community service.” Potter frowned at him and he was doing that
Octavia distinctly remembered Martha grabbing Danny’s hand out of fear multiple times and hoped her best friend hadn’t moved from Beauxbatons boys to the gawking boy that was Danny Keett. Even if his knowledge of secret passageways was pretty cool.
"It looks the best on me, so I went all out. I'll be looking the best in all of Hogwarts."
“So am I going to have to sing a duet with him later? To the Backstreet Boys?” He asked Draco. Draco shrugged with a smirk.
“And he wasn’t going to! Professor Moody, please! Stop hurting my brother!” Octavia begged helplessly, but Moody continued to bounce Draco’s ferret self around. He probably had a hundred bruises by now. Octavia fumbled for her pocket and pulled out her wand, pointing it at Moody. “Stop it!” She yelled at him, threatening him with a wand. Draco would have felt proud if he wasn’t currently being thrown around like a small sack of potatoes. “Stop it or I’ll curse you! I will!” He voice quavered but her wand stayed strong on Moody. Moody snickered at her. Blaise just looked on in horror.
Gale and Rowan were regarded as some of the best known Wizards in 11th Century France. Gale excelled in charms and Rowan excelled in potioneering, both helping the muggle community secretly while in La Rochelle.
"Come on then, let's go!" Granger grabbed Potter and Weasley by the arm.
“A Veela huh?” He slapped a hand to his head in realisation. “That’s why you’re covered in glitter! Really adds to the magic of it all.” He gesture broadly to Draco cheekily. Draco rolled his eyes and took the final sip of his drink
"Malfoy, Octavia!"
They made it to the Slytherin dorms soon enough, giving the password to the snake.
He collected some phlegm in his throat, used his wand to tear a slight incision in the shield, and spat through the hole at both Potter and Sirius, closing it up immediately after. Sirius’ eye twitched and Draco smirked widely.
"Huh. I guess you were serious about the whole 'must be in Slytherin' thing," Hermione mentioned.
"He's not my- I don't like- It's not- OH SHUT UP!" He stuttered out, taking off his Omnioculars and showing off circular red marks around his eyes. Octavia snorted.
"Don't worry, I'll be sure to be the most embarrassing and soppy girlfriend ever!" She told him, batting her eyelashes. He smirked.
“There. Was. Not. A. Girl.”
“Whatever. Point is, where did you go? You said you were going to go common room but we got here and you were nowhere to be found! What happened?”
After Octavia was done brushing Martha’s brown locks, Martha pulled out the strange contraption again.
Eventually Granger stepped in to stop it. It was almost like Moody enjoyed it. So she was asked to name the final Unforgivable.
"Go. To bed." Draco was cut off. He flushed and looked down, walking into the tent. Octavia followed him.
"No thank you, I am fine." Draco said. His face and voice softened a tad when he saw Harry's expression. "I'll see you when we get to school. Maybe." He looked to Ron. "Weasley." He managed to make it seem like a greeting, a farewell and a slur at the same time, with a careful derision he was rather proud of. He heaved his suitcases out of there and closed the door behind him, his trousers now covered in chocolate stains.
Octavia saw Draco tense up. How could she not? His entire body froze at the sight of Crouch and his eyes glued to the man. He resembled a bunny caught at noon, eyes wide, frame still, his paranoia very evident. It even threw off Viktor.
"Of course, he nearly destroys a classroom, and then he gets rewarded for it." Weasley provoked. Draco cooled his emotions and flattened his facial expression.
“Keep it down you hussies, I’ve got a head the feels like it was steamrolled by the Hogwarts Express.” Theo Nott complained, hugging his pillow over said head.
He was right about the curliness. And the ringlets. And, uh, the frizziness. It was a mess. A curly frizzy bushy blonde mess. It wasn't quite an afro, but it was close. The sheer volume was kind of amazing actually. Was it just really spread out now, or was it really concentrated before? It was hard to tell, especially with the way it was bouncy about as Pansy and Malfoy had a cat fight.
“Kind of a kinky death though.” With that last phrase Draco got up from his chair and walked over to a wall before proceeding to slam his head into it, causing multiple other stray Slytherins to look over with concern.
"Don't worry about it, I hardly sleep anyway. I just want you to get some rest in an actual bed before you mess up your back. The library isn't the most comfortable place to sleep, you should save yourself from when you really have to, like during O.W.L and N.E.W.T revision." They were next to the boy's dormitory steps. "Now try and make it all the way up to the top, don't fall asleep on the staircase, because I know for sure that some of those idiots won't check twice before they step on you." Draco grimaced and she chuckled. "Next time take the books up to your dormitory, okay? Get some sleep." She patted him on the head and shuffled him off.
"Yeah..."
“Just Draco.”
“That is true.” Blaise fingerguns her. “But he
"Uh, Tom, we're going to have to put some of this back." I told Malfoy while sifting through the pile, in the middle of an internal debate of whether or not underwear is really necessary.
This was their first mistake.
“What are their plans? What have you been doing this whole time?”
"Thank you for my wand back Potter." He embraced me tightly and I could barely process it before he was stepping away with a pink tint high on his cheekbones. Without any further context, he wordlessly waved his wand and all of his bags sorted themselves at once, some items rushing across the room into the bathroom, into and onto the desk, the wardrobe, under the bed. A set of glow in the dark stars had stuck themselves to his half of the ceiling, and while this all was happening, he'd managed to change out of his clothes and into a pair of silk pyjamas, a bright grin still on his face. I grinned as well, resuming my unpacking until I was at a similar stage to Malfoy.
Instead of facing those questions, he decided he’d rather storm to the Slytherin dormitories. It was lazy Sunday after all. And he did have a quite a bit of homework to do, and to help Pansy and the boys with, and his tutoring session he promised Via and
After the famous sorting hat song was sung, it was time for the children to be sorted.
So he did.
“Night Sirius.” He gritted and Sirius offered a fist for fist bump. Harry took it.
"Thank you Finnegan, Thomas," he returned a smile gratefully while Dean smirked.
“So Draco’s going to be okay?” She asked.
“It has been 4 years since I last asked. And you were just talking about how far ahead you are at spell work than Potter.”
“Liar!” He was.
“Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point. Because we're on a roll, you ready?” She pushed at his chest and he backed away dramatically.
"We don't have quials, Father thinks they're too common, but we do have peacocks. Some of them are albino. I tried riding a horse, but it didn't work out." Turns out riding a horse is a lot different to riding a broomstick. "I do do archery," and had pretty good aim, "but I've never played polo. We do own a small vineyard, but I don't really care because I don't drink wine. And sorry to disappoint, but I've never owned any exotic pets." Unless you count the blue butterfly his mother had gifted him in a jar. "We're not really those kind of rich people."
“And that is all? I bet Drako finds me...att-rac-teev. Don’t you?” Aleksander confronted him and Draco backed up, before rising from his seat.
“What on earth is that squid doing?” Danny Keett said warily, inching backwards into the second years.
Everyone knew who he was.
“Great!” Martha yanked Octavia so that she was kneeling on the floor facing her bed. “Do you mind if I brush your hair?”
"Granger! Hermione Granger, yes." She answered immediately. Draco nodded and turned back around to his original carriage.
The television was a peculiar item, a big black box that you have to ‘plug in’ to a wall. Apparently there weren’t any ‘plugs’ in the Hogwarts walls (the only one’s Octavia knew of were for sinks) so the first years had to bully the seventh years into making a charm for them so it would work. Then you put a small disk in a slot on the black box, and it’s spinning would play a moving picture on the ‘screen’ of the black box. It was all incredibly complex, and Octavia was rather proud of how soon she’d picked it up.
So in terms of information, Sirius was still missing a who, what, why and a where. At least he had a when.
Draco buried his face in his hands to try and drown out his embarrassment.
“On the catwalk, yeah, on the catwalk, yeah, I shake my little tush on the catwalk!” And then Blaise smacked his own arse. In front of everyone.
Greg and Vince tried to go behind him as his entourage, but he shooed them off to dinner. They both looked hungry.
“Yes, I am now in my last year at Durmstrang, am not old enough to leave yet.” Viktor said.
* Total Eclipse of the Heart - Bonnie Tyler
Surprisingly, yet unsurprisingly, Michael didn't run out of things to say by the time they were at Charms. In fact, he seemed to have talked himself into a tangent about the ways the rich were hogging the exotic yet medically benficial plants, and how "-they don't even know the proper use for the flower! They just think they look pretty, even though you're supposed to cut the bud off the stalk before it blooms so you can create the best kind of dittany! But no, sure, look at the pretty flower, because that's sooo useful. I even heard they use them to make a special kind of toffee, called Petal Toffee. Really? They're just finding more ways to waste-" Once Draco walked into the classroom he saw that there were only four kids already here.
“Well, I mean, yeah. I may hate him, but it was still a bad move he pulled, and he shouldn’t get away with it.” Octavia told her.
“You don’t think that’s gonna take a bit of time? That maybe asking a testy death eater in training for lessons on wandless magic might be a bit hurried?” Sirius glanced at Draco, who was trying to back away from the two. “Look at him, an evil little villain petting his cat.” Draco levelled his gaze and rose an eyebrow.
I am halfway through the next chapter for Double Trouble I SWEAR! I am so sorry about my update schedule but I am making progress and have been writing a drarry Rapunzel AU in my meantime but besides the point I hope you enjoy whatever this is!
"That's if I don't look better than you. Octavia picked out my dress robes." Draco added smugly.
Thankfully Pansy came in to save the day.
Octavia was glad she'd caught up on the rules of quidditch or she'd be even more lost. Everything was moving so fast, and it just kept moving faster. But if she slowed it down on her Omnioculars then she'd miss more of the game!
"We'll see you then. Come on Harry," he tried to be confident as he led them across the Platform. Around them cats crawled and hissed at their feet while Owls hooted at one another. Draco tried to keep a targeted mind to keep himself from getting lost in the euphoria that was going to Hogwarts.
"SHUT UP! Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up you drunken bint, before I steal your implants and give them to that Seventh year creep, Charlie Rattigan."
"Egotistical git."
Draco was thrown off again, and quickly searched for a response. "I like Quidditch as well, but I'm terrible at playing it. I wanted to be a Seeker, but I never caught the snitch fast enough." Draco thought about his timed Quidditch practices with Lucius, the panic and stress that came with it. He just wanted to fly.
Malfoy smirked. "The ministry may have rooted through the Malfoy vaults, but they didn't go through mine." At my probably bewildered look, he began to explain, using his hands to gesture wildly as he went. "The summer after first year, Lucius was getting angry at me, not only for being beaten for seeker by Mister Harry Potter, but for coming second in the year to a Mud- to a Muggleborn." I smiled at his correction. "It was at this time that I feared a chance of being disowned. So I lettered Gringotts and asked for a new, secret vault to be opened under the name "Tom Richardson". Every month, an couple thousand Galleons would be filtered into Tom's vault from the Malfoy vault, enough for me to be safe and get by, but small enough to be undetected in the grand scheme of things. I'd thought that my disowning would happen sooner, but since it didn't the vault has ended up gaining about 250 thousand Galleons from the Malfoy vault." I gaped at him. "So Potter, in conclusion, I think that if I can afford to send my mother to France, I can afford to pay for your new wardrobe."
At that point they both heard a tap at the window. They turned towards it to see Narcissa and a large hairy man, both with two ice creams in their hands and both smiling widely.
The kid tried to get a few kicks in before he grew tired. Sirius clutched his bleeding nose and sighed. Was he still going to be kind?
“No.”
“I’M UP! I’m up!” The idiot rises from the sofa after being shaken. “What’s going on?”
“Didn’t Greg and Vince ask you to socialise with them?” Draco groaned again.
”Father isn’t evil! He isn’t a death eater anymore! He was innocent in the beginning!”
The lady working there was very kind, and got him set up right away for being fit at the back of the shop. He stood on a footstool and waited patiently while another witch pinned his clothes. He heard some footsteps behind him and turned around to face the intruder.
There were a lot of bottles, he could barely carry all of them. Some smaller ones filled with fire whiskey and Goblin vodka fit in his short pockets, while he carried the large bottles of wine.
He went down to the dorms to take a shower, and after doing his hair (and getting every single speck of glitter out of it), he dressed in his most comfortable outfit. A grey knitted sweater, black trousers and dark grey boot slippers. A bit unprofessional, but in his hungover state he couldn’t really bring himself to try very hard.
She huffed again. “No, like a proper boyfriend! I want you to be my boyfriend like Leopold is to Kristina in ‘Star Dancing Love’. Romantic and stuff.”
“I know you’re there Potter.” Draco told the shoe, watching as it shuffled and he heard a muffled gasp. He heard the sound of fabrics moving until Potter revealed himself awkwardly.
“Yep.” And he almost sounded proud.
“Please, call me Pansy.” She simpered and that was her completely over Potter’s past. Draco might have been mad at her sell out nature, but not when it was good for his clause.
"Well in that case, I already got a great present" I grinned and pointed to the beanie, which even in it's deformed state, was very comfortable. She smiled gently in return.
I hope you enjoy and I hope you stay strong in quarantine my amigos!
“Yah.”
The first thing you see when you walk in is a desk where a young witch sat, looking at her nails. The sign above her had written 'I Repair Equipment". Further on, there was a wall filled with a million magic items that I couldn't even begin to decipher. One looked like a flute...kind of? With multiple little bird cages on top of it? I saw a piano that was strapped to the ceiling and walked under it uneasily. Everything was haphazardly thrown around with no rhyme or reason. I like it. There was a wall dedicated to things like Sneakoscopes and Remembralls, and other little do-hickeys that I didn't even bother with. Despite the haphazard organisation system of shelves and items everywhere, Malfoy still managed to walk with grace and ease around the shop, knowing exactly where to go to get what he wanted, while I awkwardly tripped after him trying to avoid getting poked in the ribs by many miscellaneous items.
“You’re hardly old!”
“W-what?” He squeaked, another thing Draco never thought he’d describe Vince as doing.
"What are there names?" Draco tentatively interrupted. "Your brothers and sisters and cousins?" Terry looked at him for a second before facing forward again.
“Finally! Someone believes me!” Potter said happily. His gaze turned towards Draco questioningly. “Um...why are you dressed like that?”
After everyone was done with the feast, Professor Dumbledore began the school announcements. He mentioned some more forbidden items that the school caretaker, Mr Filch, had asked to be taken care of. The Slytherins all tittered at this, and Octavia could faintly hear some new items being planned right then and there.
Leave a kudo, bookmark, subscribe, comment, all of the things if you enjoyed and would like more content, my other fanfic Double Trouble is where actual effort is placed.
"That goblin told me that it was PROUD to have you in their HOUSE. In RAVENCLAW." Draco could hear the sneer in his father's voice. "Of course, at first I thought that he'd made an idiotic mistake. What with all the other nonsense it was spouting about your potential. You know as well as I do that your magic has always been pathetically weak for a Malfoy, especially with your lack of control. He acted like you charming a desk instead of a feather was something to be proud of! Are you so ruined that you can't even discern a table from a feather? Are you so ignorant that you'd embarrass your family in front of a class of potential allies?" Draco opened his mouth to reply again, but was cut off. "It's obviously rhetorical Draco, this is a letter." Draco shut his mouth and flushed with shame at the loathing in his father's voice.
He spun round to the music and shook his head side to side. He smirked at Blaise and spun the taller boy. How the tables turn. Blaise grinned widely.
No one could find her. Aurors searched for many months, but to avail. They could not track the last death eater, or the stolen boy. They were soon forced to give up.
“Well that is even more adorable, childhood friends turned partners. How sweet, right out of a romance novel.” Pansy nodded with Potter’s assessment while smiling.
"Well I wasn't! Why'd he even think I was gay anyway?" At a smirk from Luna, he furrowed his brow at her. "Don't answer that. Point is, he was being as annoying as you, Potter." Luna sat there with an amused smile on her face.
“That’s what Ron said.” Draco sneered in disgust at the thought of having anything in common with Weaselbee.
Immediately Vince’s face went up in flames.
”We are
But his absolute favourite thing to do was learn new words. Long words. With 20 or more letters. The longest word in the English language was pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, and was a Muggle lung disease. Many of the words were very scientific, and would probably never be used, but he liked to keep them there in the back of his brain. Just in case.
“What on earth do you me- is that a student?!”
"Well, if you were to wear green then it'd have to match those eyes that everyone's always going on about. And this is only dark green, and your eyes are emerald green, so it just looks tacky," he circled me like a shark. "And furthermore, this shirt isn't even your blasted size, it's far too big, and is practically falling off of one shoulder, even though this material is supposed to be form fitting. Let me check the size." And in an instant he was behind me, tugging at the back of the shirt for a label.
“Nothing happe-“
"Other than being a disappointment to my family and the person who single handedly took down a 500 year old lineage that has been so ingrained in the Malfoy name that the identity stems from it, It's alright. A lot of blue, though." Draco said in a casual tone while dying on the inside.
“Yeah I know. And I am getting somewhere. It’s just..difficult. Especially with you bothering me about it everyday...”
"We're going to apparate back to the tent. Wouldn't want to go through the crowds at this rate." Narcissa told them as both parents disapparated.
“Really?” Blaise asked him, eyebrow raised. “What a friend you are.”
The boy’s eyes glanced at the sack that lay at Draco’s feet, and then at Cushion, and then at the sleeping idiot.
Said three all gasped in unison and flopped against each other.
It was his ticket to Slytherin.
“Yes.” She smiled. “I would like you to be my boyfriend.”
"Uh, what are you doing in here?" I asked her. She waved me away in favour of gasping for air. Her cackles were interrupted by a low groan coming from Malfoy's closet.
“I told you I was a drunk!” Blaise ruffled Draco’s already messy hair. His eyes focused slightly to the other boy in the trio.
“You don’t know? It seemed like everyone could hear us.” Octavia replied tearfully.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I was going to make this longerbut I will simply add on another chapter later on to try and give you more regular updates. If you would like me to post longer chapters with more waiting time, or are okay with the system I'm working with now, please let me know. If you have any ideas you'd like me to add in please let me know as I am open to suggestions. Stay safe in quarantine amigos, I hope ou're coping well, I send my best wishes to you my readers!
He looked upwards and saw Mad Eye Moody with his wand out.
Potter reached for his ears and unhooked the stupid glasses from Draco’s face and moved away. Draco was frozen. He thinks his cheeks must be bright red.
“What brings you here then, Just Draco?” She asked, using the same stupid joke Sirius had. Draco sighed, as he built up the dramatics needed for it all.
“How?!” He asked her loudly, knowing deep down he was overreacting, but being too disgusted to care.
"Salazar's bikini Potter, if you don't shut up with that fucking voice I will stab you in the back, cut your body into limbs and sections, and drop them off in a sack near the kitchens for the house elves to roast like a duck and serve for dinner."
"I'm expecting a Howler from Father by tomorrow's breakfast."
“I don’t care about the tournament,”she interrupted. “I mean about Draco.”
After another twenty seconds of supposed soul searching, Pansy pulled away with a gasp.
“If he’s so evil then why are we trying to get him on our side?” Potter rebutted. Then Sirius’ face went blank. He looked lost in his head and it made Draco uncomfortable. It reminded him of the expressions Aunt Bella got whenever she was about to snap. He glanced at Potter worriedly. Why wasn’t he scared?
"Our talk had me thinking, it was never my choice to straighten and manage my hair, It was always Lucius. So I figured, why not? I still know the straightening charm if it goes wrong, and I kind of miss having curly hair. It was fun to style and play with. And it'll probably look pretty cool with hair dye." I couldn't argue with that logic, so I shuffled my arms around and added it to the pile in my arms.
“Thank you Octi, I’ll take him from here.” Blaise said.
Time to try out some moves.
I cocked my head in confusion. "What do you mean I'm the richest man in Britain?"
And unafraid of toil;
"But sir, it was me who had that job. I didn't do it well enough. I'll take her to the nurse." He lied to Snape's face.
Another boy was being set up on a footstool, a large robe covering him alike Draco. He looked scrawny and nervous, with circular glasses and the messiest black hair Draco had ever seen. He had dark skin which made him bright green eyes stand out. He made eye contact.
After I was done battling with my locks, and after multiple instances of having to lather generous amounts of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion onto a section of my hair before brushing, I could finally see the final product.
“And why were you in my room?”
After a couple of hours of Draco reading and the boys talking, Ron suddenly turned to him.
Since the party, Blaise had been constantly talking about him and Pansy’s kiss and how funny it was to get Draco drunk and singing. Then Pansy would rebuttal with a cruel comment about Theo, and they’d get caught in a screaming match, with Draco stuck between them, trying to ignore them both in favour of his book. That was the common room ticked off.
Something was off. It was almost like they were exchanging banter. Without malice and bullying. Teasingly. Friendly.
“How did you learn French anyway?” That speccy git that
And now he never would.
"It's a weird aesthetic, I have to admit. Who was the one who told Rowena Ravenclaw to add that feature?" The tall boy, Michael, asked.
"Give him some space!" The same voice yelled out and everyone moved back a meter. He clenched his nails into his legs tighter, digging into the trousers to the skin.
"I think I have that later!"
He spotted Greg and Vince sitting next to each other and managed to catch a moment. They’re hands were resting next to each other’s, pinky’s about to link together. Draco caught Vince’s eye and Vince beamed up at him and not so subtly gestured to Greg. Draco gave him a supportive thumbs up.
She was 8 years old the first time she tried to ask him out. Just like the book characters did, she walked up to him and asked him if he wanted to grab a bite to eat. He summoned a house elf for her. Oblivious.
“It’s called offering an olive branch, Potter. Paint it as pity if you’d like, but I need hep getting these bottles back to Slytherin.” He explained snippily. “Are you gonna follow or not?”
“-a model, you know what I mean! And I do my little turn on the catwalk!” Potter and him entered the common room to everyone gathering around the makeshift stage, music blasting and Blaise Zabini above them all, belting the words to a song he was reading off a screen. Draco attempted to ignore this display by putting he bottles on the drinks table, followed by Potter, but Blaise wasn’t finished.
“And I’m not? Why pansy, I’m disappointed that you’d imply such dastardly things about me!” Blaise called out, distraught, inching towards them.
I'll eat myself if you can find
“Language.” Potter commented offhandedly. Octavia rolled her eyes.
"Oh really? But I heard that the amazing, incredible, best seeker in the world Viktor Krum was on the Bulgaria team!" She batted her eyelashes, imitating him.
"What, running away?"
Potter was still asleep.
"Yeah mini Malfoy! Go quidditch! Woohoo, Ireland!" The two boys who looked like twins cheered, encouraging the others in the family to join in. Octavia wasn't sure whether or not they were twins, as all of the ginger family looked quite similar.
"Poncy git."
“You wouldn’t be saying that if it were Viktor Krum trying to get in your pants.” Draco nearly kicked Blaise off the bed and his face darkened.
“Good thing Vince is a reader, but not much of a talker. You guys sure are the perfect fit.” Draco comments casually, but is elbowed by Vince.
"I wouldn't worry about him, he's probably just a dirty death eater spy."
As she entered her room, she unlocked her trunk. She started pulling out odd items that she thinks could be turned into a vampire costume. Not quite like an actual vampire, but maybe something a bit similar. She distantly thought whether or not this was cultural appropriation of vampires, but ignored it in favour of finding a cloak she could use as a cape.
"Yeah, sure, quick question; how big is your Christmas tree?"
A couple more freezing minutes passed as Octavia could feel her nose freezing off.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Welcome home Auntie, will you be wanting any dinner?” She put up a hand to silence him as she rubbed her temple.
What he was meant to be.
“I didn’t put my name in.” He looked down angrily. “It must have been someone else, I didn’t actually want to compete, I didn’t have a death wish!” He tried to defend himself. It was Draco’s turn to snort.
He’s taken aback, but finds his footing quickly, sending a Stickfast Hex towards Sirius, sticking his stupid boots to the ground before running to the other side of the room. Sirius sends a spell Draco’s way, but he dodges it. He sends another and this time it does hit Draco, causing tiny spikes to erupt all over Draco’s arms. A targeted Sea Urchin Jinx. It stings harshly, so Draco casts a Tongue Tying Spell towards Sirius. It hits, and Sirius can no longer cast. One down.
"Mother, could you get us both some ice cream while I get my robes fitted over there at Madam Malkin's please?" He pointed to the robe shop so she wouldn't get lost. He handed her a small pouch full of sickles and galleons.
They walked through the muddy camp site, both being overly aware of their very expensive shoes. The sun had fully risen by this time, and they could see some other campers waking up. They saw three boys drag their very tired looking mother outside to play, poking her and bothering her and begging for breakfast. The two Malfoys grimaced.
A great sob wretched itself from his throat. Sets of footsteps pattered around him and he felt arms reach round his back and hug him. He tensed up. Was he going to be strangled? Choked? He ripped himself out of the grip and spun round on the floor to face them.
“So...made any friends yet?” She tensed up slightly.
“...nothing.”
Harry came running out of the house towards him with excitement.
“Miss Malfoy, what are you doing threatening a teacher?!” McGonagall’s voice sounded, but Draco couldn’t make anything out. He was too dizzy.
Draco goes through a bit of a breakdown in the snow. Just a bit of rambles, angst and no shipping.
ferret, limped towards her.
As the music continued they began to near each other.
“Promiscuous boy,” she tilted her hips, “you already know. That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?” She let it ring out, allowing the common room yell out a bit.
. He then free falls, careening downwards and spinning every which way before he grasps the broom with both of his arms and legs again and pulls up before he hits the ground.
Another girl with a short black bob flounced to the front as McGonagall called, "Bones, Susan!"
"O-okay." Neville held his wand out and waved it in a curve. "Accio Trevor!"
“Okay Draco. Our Slytherin lovebirds aside, have you heard of whose going to try and enter the Tournament?”
"Yesss, finally, excitement! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!" Michael began chanting. Terry put his hands over his ears and tucked his legs up onto his chair, while Draco once again thanked the gods that he remembered to set a silencing charm around this part of the library. Neville looked like he was about to be sick, and was clutching the edge of his chair with a death grip.
“Let me see the news, wont you?” Blaise scanned the front page and then let out a laugh. “Have you seen this? The Weasleys are at it again. Particularly Arnold Weasley...isn’t he the dad?”
"My brothers are Nelson, Christopher, Clement and Albert, my sisters are Bella, Cory, Mauve and Diana, and my cousins are Barnie, Cecile, Laura, and the triplets Harry, Larry and Barry," he looked back to Draco, "I assume they were going with a theme."
“You’re the worst.”
“Hey, I didn’t cheat! I swear I-“
He knew he wouldn’t actually die. That when it’s get too cold he’d pull himself up and would walk back to the dorms in a damp and frosty silence. That he’d hold out for his beloved Pansy, because while he didn’t tell her how much he cared, he did promise her he’d stick around.
Draco chuckled lowly. “Yep.” He popped the ‘p’. He leant into Blaise’s shoulder. “You’re warm...”
Draco sighed deeply as he tried to upright himself, but every movement with every limb was a struggle. He eventually managed to sit himself on a chair, but his energy had been taken out of him.
After my shower I went to go get dressed and could see Malfoy filling up a satchel with multiple books. Virgo was wound loosely around his shoulders, slithering round and down one arm before resting on top of his wand holster. Today he was wearing a dark grey hoodie and a pair of ripped black jeans. His shoes were the same pair of pink converse he'd worn yesterday, and he had a plethora of silver earrings on, to contrast with his new black hair. Now that I was looking at him properly, I had to admit that the new black hair definitely didn't suit him. Or maybe it was my being used to him having pale hair all these years that I'd gotten used to his overall lack of colour. Palest skin, platinum blonde hair and grey eyes.
“To be a kidnapper I’d have to take you to a secondary location-“ he stopped. He grinned. “Which is not a bad idea.”
“Now I know that in less than a week you will become eighteen. My little Draco will become a man!” She rested her face in her hands and looked at him with what he dubbed her ‘crazy eyes’. “And just in time. I estimate that we will be capturing the Potter boy within the week, and the Dark Lord may rise again!” She nearly swooned. “And what that will mean for you is that you will have the great pleasure of becoming an official death eater! Long overdue if you ask me, but I am so looking forward to you joining the ranks!” Draco smiled widely.
“A truce.” Potter sticks out his hand at Draco and Draco stares at it. He feels a strange sense of deja vu.
.” The boy finished his sentence with a wink that immediately lit Draco’s cheeks ablaze. Blaise snorted loudly, scaring off the girl he was chatting up as Octavia smirked at the knowledge she had the same complexion as Draco.
"Ah, now let's see here," the short little man flicked through the pile he kept in his hands. "Ah, here we go. Herbology first lesson, very nice." He handed Draco the weekly schedule. He read it through as Terry collected his. He imagined they'd all be the same as each other, but took comfort in knowing if they lost each other, he would know where to go.
“No, I mean some actually interesting games.”
at some point i might share my more public insta where I could post updates in case this fic gets anymore traction because OVER 4400 HITS????? WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!!!!
“Makes sense. Hey Potter, do you mind getting me a refill?” He shoved his cup unceremoniously into Potter’s hand. Potter looked grateful for a small excuse to leave.
"So we're not going to bring Aunt Andy any fairy cakes?" He checked carefully.
Hermione and Neville stared at him.
“Drakey?” She shook his forearm. “Lets go organise the Halloween party quickly. We’ve still got to set up the stolen desserts and drinks. Lets make sure the decorations aren’t crooked. We also need to get in costume! C’mon Drakey-poo, let’s go and fix some stuff up.” As if being woken up from a spell, Draco came to, fluttering his lashes.
“Because carrying you Auror style would have been pretty painful.”
Hyperthermia is always an option. Pansy usually stopped him from listing off ways to go, but it’s a fun past time. Keeps his brain occupied. Pansy joined in only once when they were both very drunk. Most of her suggestions were funny and lewd. This was apart from one suggestion, when her face closed up and her wine bottle was held in a tighter grip.
"Me neither. So this is why I've been concocting a revenge. You see, we have Potions tomorrow, so-" Anthony began laying out his revenge scheme wickedly. Hermione stepped in.
) looked embarrassed.
Potter was grinning down at him, his head peaking over the potion shelf. Draco slammed the book shut in embarrassment and held it to his chest.
"Ah! Salazar's sparkling bikini! You nearly gave me a heart attack!" Draco yells at him, wiping the drool off his face.
“What.” Draco said flatly, and he fidgeted again. He was currently being tied to a chair with magic rope, but clearly knew his spells as he hadn’t struggled much. With struggle these ropes only tightened. The kid’s wand was in Sirius’ pocket, so there was no way out for him.
"Potter, to be as frank as possible, I have no sodding clue why we are paired up together to share a room. Believe it or not, I am not as thrilled as I appear to be to share a room with the Golden Boy, but never the less, I am tired. So you can either room as a three with someone else, or you can come in here to sort something else out. Your arm looks like it's being pulled out of it's socket by your bag by the way, and it's rather disconcerting witnessing the skinny little twig hold it up, so I would recommend coming in." He explained calmly, a mix between a smile and a grimace on his face, a ghost of a sneer behind it all, as if he were holding it back. I scowled at the comment about my arm, but begrudgingly walked into the room and placed my bags on the bed opposite Malfoy's, turning to look at him while crossing my legs under me.
Unfortunately he’d given Viktor the book with the more ancient tournaments, and those contained far more death, which probably wasn’t best for Viktor’s nerves. He subtly switched the books over to give Viktor the less gory ones to study, while he took notes.
“Good thing no one asked you then.” Draco smiled threateningly.
"You'd be better off running along. Don't want them to know you have Granger with you?" He nodded his head towards her.
"But Draco! They are coming towards us! And what if Father isn't with them..." She said the last part as barely a whisper. Draco froze.
“Okay so if you see here, the most common first tasks that have been held are ones including large magical creatures. They are usually held in Durmstrang or Mahoutokoro due to their extensive Care of Magical Creatures curriculum, but it wouldn’t be that surprising for Hogwarts to indulge. So while we do more research, I believe you should focus on your offensive magic, maybe some darker defensive spells, and larger displays of- are you listening?” Draco stopped his lecture as he noticed that Viktor was looking past his book at another side of the library.
“Um Blaise...”
"Fine." He spat out. He was too tired for this. "If it's okay with them." He spoke through gritted teeth, adjusting Octavia on his back. The trio exchanged glances with each other, Weasley looking to detest the idea.
Shit.
The whole hall was quiet, staring at the hat. The hat twitched. Once. Then twice. It then opened a rip near the brim wide, like a mouth - and the hat began to sing:
"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce...the Bulgarian Team Mascots!" Ludo continued as the right hand of the stands cheered louder.
"So Harry, what have you done today? Been shopping?" She gestured to the bags littered about.
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
"Yeesh, that jacket brings back
McGonagall had come to the front of the steps and everyone instantly quietened down. I muffled a snicker at everyone's unfathomable respect for her, although deserved. If everyone didn't already appreciate and/or fear her, then the stories of her in the battle of Hogwarts ought to have done it.
'You think she knows?"
“Nice Viktor Krum poster.”
“What? It’s the truth! I’m fine with it, they’re just dancing.” His brow furrowed. “It’s not like Pansy’s in a really daring and pretty costume and I’m just a dope in a quidditch uniform...” he muttered. Draco took in Vince’s costume, a fake uniform for the Ballycastle Bats.
After Thomas was Amanda Green, who was Imperio-ed into picking up her books and parchment and tossing them all into the air.
"I'm o-okay, I was just about to go onto the Platform for the Hogwarts Express." While they were having their second meeting, Draco could spot the nice woman leading her twins through the platform, leaving only the nervous boy and the excitable little girl.
"I wouldn't mind being in Hufflepuff house, but I should be in Slytherin house." Draco said.
“Dating?” He asked her from the common room sofa.
"Never call me that again or I will tell Tom Vicars you like him." It was Pansy's turn to look disgusting.
He read over the list and folded the parchment over. He lay it on top of the many books and magazines that hid under the mattress in the smallest bedroom. He folded the sheets to exact so that Kreacher wouldn’t bother looking or feeling the need to clean the room, and returned to the library. That elf was such a snoop sometimes. He especially loved to snitch.
He’d never left Grimmauld Place before. He really wanted to. But he couldn’t. He could never go against Auntie’s wishes.
As I tried it on I noticed that it fitted me far nicer than any normal clothes ever had. I looked at myself in the crappy smudged mirror they provided and managed to make out that this colour did match my eyes way better. For one of the first times...ever, I felt like I looked good in something, and this was just a random shirt. I walked out of the booth to check what Malfoy thought.
"We've got to put away our winnings!"
“What’s in it for me?” Potter had the audacity to ask. Octavia smiled.
“Why do you want him to think you’re sexy?” Draco changed the question.  Blaise pouted.
"You're on par with Potter for circular eyewear."
But if there was ever one thing that shook open all of his doors, it was Potter.
“I’m not ‘mini Malfoy’ either. My name is-“
She sat on the stool and slipped on the tattered hat. This time it took a little longer before the hat called out:
"Huh."
"I honestly have no clue what "these" are, Malfoy. I'm rather blind, you see, so if you could tell me what you probably stole from me that would be appreciated." I could practically hear his smirk. I tried to glare at the blurry figure but it probably came out as an angry squint in his direction.
Octavia progressing a little with making more friends but she’s still a bit attached the others. Let’s see how this plays.
Slytherins are people too btw, if you didn't know. And crabbe and goyle are 2d, and their names are vincent and gregory and I may make them gay in the future, idk.
"Anything to do with the chosen one would. You could try selling his backwash and there'd still be some poor sod who'd pay every galleon."
“Get up or you won’t get your hangover potion.” Draco told him coldly and that was convincing enough. Blaise snatched a bottle out of his hand so fast he nearly dropped the others. After chugging it swiftly Blaise looked around the room with confusion.
“Only seventeen!?” Sirius cried. Draco rose an eyebrow.
Potter shrugged. The nerve... “I’m tired of fighting. And I’m tired of you insulting Ron and Hermione. I reckon if we agree to a truce, the fighting stops on both fronts. Hermione wont have to punch you in the face because you called her a Mudblood, and you wont be turned into ferret due to-“
“Stop it! I was excited to go to Hogwarts to get away from Mother’s pecking! Get off!” She shook away his hand. “Why are you up so early anyway. One wouldn’t think you’d leave your bat cave (AKA your bed) earlier than 10 on a Saturday. What gives?”
"You'd need more than my help to look "Fabulous" Potter. Our goals for today are focused more on you not looking hideous. Starting with, pick out a shirt, and I shall judge accordingly." He bossed me about with enough of an ego to power the Hogwarts Express. Still, I listened to the git and began searching through the shirt racks.
“Maybe you stole it to impress Potter?”
But he supposed he could forgo that wondrous plan for a more humble and peaceful one where he died in the snow. Where he let go of everything and let the grass grow over his body. Becoming a boy of the ground as it consumed him. The snow would fall over him and he’d freeze to death peacefully in his sleep.
Draco huffed and blew a strand of hair out of his eyes. “What are you doing here?” He asked.
“Especially his voice cracks.” They laughed together. Octavia felt the dig was justified.
"I thought he promised to be done with it last year."
"There isn't  a test, don't worry. I've read about the sorting, they put the magic sorting hat on your head and it reads your mind to deduce which house you would fit best in by your qualities. There's no way to fail. Unless you have a very diverse personality, but then the sorting hat just makes a decision. I've heard it even takes opinion into account sometimes. So I wouldn't worry." He was saying that to himself as much as he was saying it to her. He saw some people as well as Hermione sigh a little in relief when he explained this.
“I’m gonna leave you two with the nutter while I get changed into my costume.” She told Pansy and Blaise.
“Okay, okay, damn...” Blaise trailed off with wide eyes. Then Pansy snorted.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! If you don't know about my other fanfic, It's Easier Than Hating, then please check that out, it's an Eighth year fic, and if you do know I apologise if chapter updates are a little slower because of me working on this. Your support means the world to me so I hope you have a great day and a great life! Catch you later, BisexualGurrl! xoxo
"I'm doing great, thanks. I've just been in Neville's room learning how to knit." She held up her progress. It was...something for sure. It was an emerald green thing that could of resembled a hat? Maybe a beanie? A scarf? It was an attempt at least.
“Am I not pretty enough?” Her eyes began to fill with tears. “You’re my friend well enough. Do you only like me that much? Is it my face? Is it my weight? Am I really so similar to a pig?” A couple tears began to fall in the dramatics and Draco began to panic.
Vince scoffed. “He’s his own person you know, we’re not glued together or anything.” Draco raised an eyebrow. Vince flushed. “He’s dancing with Pansy.” He mumbled.
“Night Prongs Jr.” Sirius replied before making himself comfortable on the sofa.
A louder bang sounded from outside the trees, causing many people to scream, and more to jump. Octavia hid her face in the hood of Draco's cloak and Draco grimaced.
"Do not lie, boy!" Crouch aimed his wand at Draco's face. "You've been discovered at the scene of the crime!"
“Oh.” He looked awkward all of a sudden. “Via. Um, look, I’m s-“
“I don’t think that’s how fate works. And even if you could affect fate, how does dropping Draco in Potter’s arms do anything?” Blaise shrugged again, that infuriating smirk becoming more infuriating.
Draco glanced upwards over the large book and saw Potter looking at him pensively. As he was caught, Potter quickly turned his gaze back towards his own book. Draco furrowed his brow in confusion but continued to read.
“Since we don’t really have any clue to what the first task is, I say that we read through the previous Triwizard Tournaments to see if there’s a common theme for the first task. Then we can plan for that.”
i promise promise promise i love love love Double Trouble and I will be updating it soon enough. pls dont give up on me. any input you have for more chapters of DMTD and any constructive critismsms or little details you'd like me to include in Double Trouble help a lot and every comment reminds me to KEEP WRITING. my motivation is just pretty skewed.
“It’s been alright so far, though I don’t usually wake up this early. My friends wanted to see who entered their name in the goblet of fire.” Draco said. Borislav fidgeted a bit at the mention of the goblet.
“Just Draco.” He told her.
They were manageable.
"I'm going to go with Hermione, probably to the library. I'll see you guys next lesson!" He got up and waved to them. All three of them had their mouths full, so they just nodded and waved back. He walked down the table to the doors, and saw Hermione mirror him from the Gryffindor table.
"And why did you let her go with you?" Lucius' voice had taken on an angrier tone. Her picked another heavy book from the shelf and slammed in onto Draco's head with force. Draco wavered.
"I haven't recently. We can't see, uh, Aunt Bella and Father forbids any communication with Aunt Andromeda." She frowned.
But then Draco looked at Harry and saw him mouth 'The Messed Up Group' and things seemed a little less grey.
The next song that played was one Draco actually knew. It was by a British singer called Bonnie...something? He really was terrible with names. The song was called ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart’ and he absolutely adored it.
“You never were a man Alek! Get over yourself!” Another boy yelled at the crier. Octavia turned her eyes back to the goblet like many others.
“Um, this is probably a stupid question, and more likely the alcohol talking...” Potter began, talking a sip of his drink, “but you aren’t like, part Veela, are you?” Draco scrunched his nose. He
“Dobromir! You said s’at I could try ‘flir-teeng’ with s’is one! It vas my turn!” A shorter boy with a strong accent yelled at the deep voiced one. Draco’s continued to look like he was going to die of heatstroke from the heat in his own cheeks.
"Okay then, who's going next?" The plump woman addressed the first years.
, Draco thought.
“Shut up nerd.”
"Pardon Harry?" Mione asked after snapping out of her Ron filled vision.
“I mean, what do they do? What is the point of them?”
"It's j-just that in h-her s-story, she's re-really g-good at c-convincing and p-persuading p-people to do what sh-she wants, and c-can t-turn people into m-mice w-with j-just one lo-look." He mumbled, embarrassed. Hermione was quiet for a minute. Then she began laughing. Oh gods, oh gods, this is why you don't blabber, this is why you don't stutter, this is why you keep quiet this is why-
"Aw, fuck."
Pansy Parkinson was a winner.
The trip to Hogwarts.
They looked at each other. Then they started laughing.
Stupid pale complexion-
(See the end of the chapter for
And he was supposed to date her. Or at least pretend to. He’d gotten a letter from his mother that Sunday about the arrangement. She was kinder about it all than Mrs Parkinson probably would have been, not treating it like an engagement, but merely a form of socialisation, almost practice. The way she had phrased it around his unfamiliarity with courtship was a bit embarrassing, but he accepted the letter. He would pretend to court Pansy properly.
“Well you’re gonna have to keep it in your trousers, this isn’t for you.” She turned away and Draco gagged.
Being passionate is never for pure bloods. He should know this. He NEEDED to know this. But every time he saw Potter his guts started to feel weird and he just had to do something stupid to try and impress him. To prove that he was better and a good rival. He was worth Potter’s time.
Fo some reason the fact didn’t bring him as much malicious glee as it would usually.
“Oh...hello Dobromir. What a surprise...”
“How did you know I was there?” He asked, as if he was the one who was entitled to questions.
“Mr Malfoy, do you need to go to Madame Pomfrey?” McGonagall asked him, concerned.
“second year...”
"Oh lord, not this again!"
“My...deal? You mean with the tournament? Because I swear I never-“
"Well, then, what did you want?" Potter asked him, crossing his arms.
Blaise blinked. “Wow.” He blinked again. “Merlin’s beard Draco, how are you still alive? You’re doing all of that yourself while still looking fantastic? You’re a bloody miracle!” Draco scoffed but smiled at Blaise’s attempt to cheer him up.  “How about I help out with Pans and the boys, and maybe help with the quidditch strats. I’d also love to help fake date Pans, but unfortunately I’m to out of her league. No one would believe it.” Draco snickered and punched Blaise in the arm.
“Vampire, emphasis on horror.”
Blaise snickers. “Think he has a thing for Seekers?”
“I guess I’m a bit drunk too.” He forced out, looking down. Draco squeezed the boy’s hand.
"What a pleasure it is to see you Mr Potter."
We made our way out of the common room, thankfully without bumping into anyone else.
“Just vait until Dobromir hears about s’is, his blood vill be jealous!” Draco smiled at the dorky phrasing.
I’m sorry to put Blaise in a not very healthy relationship, i rly am because i love him and he is my child.
“Why would you do that?”
“He started it.” He muttered a bit childishly.
“Just contemplating why I let you refer to me as Drakey three times.” He told her as they meandered off the great hall.
"Want to know why I had all that hair product in for the first three years?" He asked me conspiratorially.
A blurry figure with really soft hands carefully puts my glasses on my face. I take a second to take in my surrounding's and see Malfoy sitting at the edge of my bed with wild eyes and mussed black hair, his hand on my knee. He's staring at me intently and his mouth is moving and he's making words and talking to me and-
The next week passed strangely. Three half and half siblings, fifth year Leo, fourth year Abi, and second year Ross, were all filling the Slytherin common rooms with Halloween cheer, to commemorate their favourite holiday. They had been sent many ‘tech-no-logical’ devices to play muggle music from, as well as copious amounts of Halloween ‘films’ to watch on the night itself. All from their rich muggle father who apparently starred in such ‘films’. The ones who were familiar with the concept didn’t believe them.
The Weasleys went to join the other Weasleys' moving as a sea of red hair. Lucius and Narcissa caught up to the children and each took a child.
“Dance with me, you ponce!” He yelled over the music and grabbed Draco’s hand to spin him round and make him dizzy. “Boorrrn in the U-K, I was, boorrrn in the U-K!” He sang loudly, encouraging others. Draco rose an eyebrow as he bobbed to the music.
"Wow, I am getting a serious sense of deja vu right now," he chuckled. "Wait wait wait, let me just quickly-" He turned away from me to fess up his hair, and then quickly transfigured a small lamp into a...pair of glasses? He put those on, then turned to me and said in what must have been the most annoying voice he could muster.
I liked it way too much.
“Well he is still our
“Danny-“ Martha tried to interrupt.
“I suppose I could use it as ammunition, but I was originally editing the spell for a pet.” Aunt Bella’s face froze.
“Your wish is my command!”
“I can practically see the bigotry emitting from that hand. No thank you.” She rejected him in favour of her reading material. He glowered.
“Give it here!” Draco’s whisper yelled, not wanting Pince to kick him out.
“Draco.”
“Don’t just stare with your mouth open like that, you’ll catch a fly!” She hissed at him, trying to show that Hogwarts also had decorum and respectable students. He glanced at her shyly and nodded, but still stared up at the tall lady in awe.
“I’m a shitty person.”
Regardless, he opened a scroll of parchment and began to dot down some ideas to how he could use transfiguration spells for torture. That would please Aunt Bella.
“...”
Draco did.
"Oh yes, I forgot to offer a free 'Sleep With Blaise Zabini' pass. Oh wait! You never need one of those to sleep with the school..." he covered Octavia's ears, "slut." He let her ears go.
“Sure, you do that.” Just as he took another bite of toast, Viktor Krum sat next to him and Draco nearly choked. He was definitely not used to Krum being in school. Definitely not.
I looked at the bottle. The label said it was a bottle of Hair Magix's new line of colour change hair dye. According to the instructions, when applied it would sift through the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple over and over again, changing every ten minutes. Malfoy had been released from Luna's death grip and was throwing a small fit over Luna's spilt tea on the carpet and sofa. He set about charming it clean and getting her a new mug full.
"Oh you poor sod. I will not stand for this hetero-normativity in the group!" Draco snorted.
“That was really something!” He said. “You guys should duet on stage!” Draco exchanges a look with Pansy and she shushes him before he can answer.
TW: kind of a toxic relationship being set up between Blaise and Theo, with some mild manipulation so if that might affect you please try and avoid a part of Octavia’s POV.
“But it’s true!” He stomped his foot to the beat. “Born in the U-K! I was born in the U-K!” Others joined in. “I was born in the U-K!” Draco gave in. “Born in the U-K!” They all sang together to the strange song, stomping on the ground. Thank god for the silencing charms guarding every entrance and exit. Seventh years were a good thing.
And it did feel like kissing his cousin. But with his family history, he didn’t think that was a good enough excuse.
Viktor found Granger attractive.
"Oh! So you're of Hogwarts age aren't you! When are you going? Have you got all of you're things? Will I go to Hogwarts as well?" And with that last question, the illusion of a normal adult was broken. Draco forced out a chuckle.
One of his calloused thumbs -
And they moved on from it. Octavia would be keeping the argument in the back of her head, but she just wanted to have a nice Halloween. She she’d try and have one without fighting with her brother. If that was possible.
“I uh, went for a walk.” Octavia could tell he was lying. Pansy could as well.
“This song is called ‘Promiscuous’. I’m sure you’ve listened to it before.” He could remember some parts, yes. “You sing the parts in blue, I sing the parts in yellow, and we both sing the parts in green. Got it?” He nodded. She smiled. “Try and keep up. We’re going right into it.” She tossed her hair and looked to the screen as a beat began playing.
Looking deep into Potter’s eyes through those damn specs, Draco realised that he might have a small crush on Potter. Just a little bit. He might be a tad attracted to his messy raven locks, his smooth almond skin, his pine green eyes, and his calloused hands. He might be a bit attracted to all of those, and then some.
He blushed and tried to organise his hair. “I still won.”
“Ooh, ‘e really does speak française!”
"Well I thought I'd start off small. Do you think it went okay?"
Well, developing makes it sound like a new occurrence. Truthfully this feeling had been growing over the course of many years.
"I suppose so."
Moody took the register, his robotic eye swivelling around the students once more. Then the class began.
“Octavia! They were joking!” Draco hissed. “I don’t actually look like a Veela!”
"What happened to the Hufflepuff girl?" Neville asked them, a bit more sad after his Herbology buddy had gone. After Anthony explained the situation angrily, Neville turned white. "Professor Snape really took points away from her while she was in pain?"
"I am. Off to your rooms you two, and please take off those...accessories. It's quite late, so we should all get some sleep."
“I think I vould like to know her. She seems...dedicated to her studies.” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“How do you know?” Draco blinked.
She glanced at her brother again. He was no longer comforting the boy Aleksander, but his expression was still blank. He was staring oddly at the great hall’s entrance, where Potter had exited moments ago.
"Nous sommes désolés, nous n'avons pas vu madame maxime." Draco replied to them after a touch of thinking.
Without being with Draco, what more did that leave her in terms of reputation?
On the other side was a library that could practically rival the school's. The room obviously had a lot of extension charms on it and extended forward. You'd go down a small set of stairs that led up to the door and would come face to face with a sign and a basket.
"Go into the woods and STICK TOGETHER. Draco, you're in charge, act responsibly. Stay safe and in one spot while I find your father." The mention of his father made his stomach churn.
“You don’t tell me what I will and won’t do.” She hissed at him and he nodded sombrely. At his somber look, she tapped him on the head. “Don’t look like that Draco,” she stretched the ‘o’,” I’m not the bad guy.” She pinched the same cheek she slapped. His cheek felt like it would soon bruise. “I shall be pitiful. I’ve always had a soft spot for begging.” She smiled and Draco tensed. “Gravibus Artus.” She cast and immediately Draco’s every limb felt twice as heavy. Even keeping his head up seemed like a struggle.
"Go figure, I don't tell you everything." Draco said, rolling his eyes.
And they Disapparated.
"Hey!" Lucius turned back around. "What did I just say!" The Malfoy kids rolled their eyes and stayed quiet for the rest of the walk.
"Whoo quidditch!" She called out, realising soon after that she was the only one in the box cheering. She quieted down awkwardly, before two Weasley boys began cheering as well.
Ever the amazing and caring friend, he grabbed a hangover potion for her and practically fed it to her, all while stroking her hair back.
I swear I am so close to finishing the next chapter of double trouble I am just swamped in school work and my own procrastination.
“Agree to never do that ever again unless under extreme circumstances?” He asked.
“Don’t worry, the feeling’s mutual.” Pansy’s voice called from the doorway. “You’re lucky we have potions first lesson or you boys would be fucked. Now grab your textbooks and shit and let’s go. There’s only so much Snape is willing to be patient for.”
Draco could feel his heart sink to the bottom of his shoes and frowned a little bit, before hiding the expression away. He breathed in deeply.
“I wish I had an older sibling! All I have is my twin brother Felix, and he’s a real pain.” Martha told her.
not worse drama queens.” He corrects. “We are by far the worse.”
“What’s the matter, Potter? Got something on my face?”
“Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me,” he tried to continue, “you know what I want, and I got what you need.” He tried to smirk.
She breathed in deeply and shakily. "It's just...we were having a- a good time and then Father had to...had to ruin it." She gestured to the disastrous campsite.
“Good morning Aunt Bella, how are you today?” He asked politely. She grinned and pat his head.
“Right.” Theo tugs Blaise’s head again and looks like he’s about to unzip his trousers-
“Fine. Grab a broom.” The other boy looked stupidly happy that Draco wanted to punch him in his dumb face. Draco grumpily walked towards one corner of the pitch. Potter followed once he got out another Nimbus 1000. “We go in this direction round the pitch...three times, was it? Until we reach here again. Whoever crosses this line first,” he pointed to a painted white line on the grass, “wins the race. Afterwards I will show you the Malfoy Fall ONCE and you will be amazed and will not be allowed to steal it. Then we say our goodbyes and forget this ever happened. Deal?”
"Draco!" Hermione greeted, running across the front of the hall over to him. Before he knew what was happening, she was holding him in a tight embrace. He didn't know how to react. "How are you doing?" Before he could do anything she let him go. "How is Ravenclaw?"
“The same as me. We match. My idea.” Vince grinned shyly. Not a word Draco would usually use to describe anything Vince does, but okay.
“Are you certain ve should? If she is close with Harry Potter, she might not vant to help another champion.” Viktor held his hands uncertainly. Draco waved it off and breathed in again.
He huffed into the night sky. The kid was barely a kid, and looked about twenty years old. Twenty years old and still stuck in that evil house. Sirius couldn’t imagine. He got the fuck out of there before the word go, as soon as James’ parents let him.
Draco shrugged. “Not sure. Teenage rebellion? Granger got a real stick up her arse about it.”
“Promiscuous girl, wherever you are. I'm all alone, and it's you that I want.” He pointed to her again and this time made an hourglass shape with his hands.
“At least my mum’s not a slut! Going through a husband a month, I’ve heard! And then they die under ‘mysterious circumstances’. Say, do you even remember which one was your dad?” Weasley countered brutishly. Granger gasped. Blaise clenched his fists in anger and Draco and Octavia were right there with him.
Moody performed it on a spider. The spider danced and performed acrobatics. Most of the class laughed, including Pansy. Draco tried to laugh, but it came out as a forced bark. Moody yelled at the class for laughing.
“I thought cheating was Slytherins whole thing? Wouldn’t that impress you lot?”
“I have got to talk to him about that.”
"I-I'm s-s-sorry Fa-Father, I-I-I d-did-didn't th-think." Draco stuttered out fearfully.
"You're Harry Potter..."
"Draco! It's so good to see you, how has your summer been?" She leapt up from her seat and hugged him tightly.
“Like...covered in glitter?” Potter gave him a once over. “And is that...the poster you stole?” He pointed to Draco’s shirt. Draco sighed and looked upwards in annoyance.
He just has to watch his mouth.
“This here is Draco Malfoy. He’s something of my second cousin, his mother is my first cousin. Part of the Black family.”
"Haven't decided yet."
“Ah! Fu-!” He muffled himself with his hand, his other hand holding onto his calf. McGonagall and Moody were still arguing, with Potter butting in at times.
“Yeah, really terrifying. I thought I was gonna piss myself.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Octavia shook her head.
than a
"No way, this is hilarious. Mum is in the win, and I wanna see how it pans out."
"So you didn't like how the potions sounded and decided to act out like a toddler?" Snape spat out. Terry looked like he was going to cry from frustration. "Your idiotic hand motions could of spilt the half-made potion everywhere! It could have hurt someone! Did you take that into account?" Draco raised his hand hesitantly. "What is it Mr Malfoy?"
Something was just missing. He’d been reading his novels for years, and every time the leads kissed something was meant to happen. He was meant to feel butterflies in his stomach, or fireworks going off, or just happiness and warmth down to his core. He was meant to feel safe and excited and- he was getting into cheesy romantic territory. Ugh.
"I can't find it!" The other two shone their Lumos' on the ground and area around Potter, but to no avail.
"Actually it's 15." Draco added sheepishly.
“Finally meet another person and he’s a fucking sociopath.” Draco muttered and Sirius raised an eyebrow.
“I wasn’t feeling bothered.” Draco shrugged. “I could bother you if you want some familiarity.” He smirked. “Send some hexes your way. Insult your dead parents. Like old times.”
"Draco!" He heard Octavia shriek in fear. He heard the other three being Stupefied and couldn't help a sense of sick pleasure knowing they were being taken down same as him.
"Are you Duke Richard Robert Hensington The Rich?" He asked the ghost, who was looking at him with newfound interest.
“No. You’re really not.”
Hermione had been quiet during his outburst, and after Malfoy had his say was the first one to talk.
The morning started off uneventfully. Draco guided a very tired Octavia to breakfast, where he recieved his usual treats from Narcissa. This time however, it was doubled, his owl Pluto looking strained from the amount of packages attached to him. Draco untied the paper bags from Pluto's leg and fed him some of the sausage off his plate.
After a few minutes, they all formed a line and were led out into the Great Hall.
. Draco began to race in the direction which he thought was the dungeons. He needs to get out of here before he gets stepped on! “On no you don’t!” Moody yelled and he suddenly felt himself being lifted my magic.
. Once he underlined it, he began to add goals.
Draco's shoulders raised. "M-M-Meredith, you r-really don't h-have t-to, it's f-fine." She looked at him sharply.
“Donc a la mode!”
"Who says I can't be both?" Draco asks, unclipping a poster from the four corners which it hung.
Octavia stormed off from the silence of the common room to her dormitory, tears streaming down her cheeks. She jumped onto her bed and got out a large hardback, ripped it open and because to frantically flick through.
“How’s your day been?” Vince interrupts their cycle of squabbling. They glowered at each other for a second.
"Yeah, we'd better get to class...I'll see you later?"
“Oh shit I don’t have time to brush it and clear it.” He panicked, biting in his nails. Then he looked down at his nails. “Oh double shit!”
So the library was the next best option.
"Malfoy? Wasn't your dad one of You-Know-Who's supporters?" Harry's eyes widened and Draco cringed. He had hoped his father's past wouldn't be brought up.
"Are you quite done, mother duck?" She asked snarkily. Draco coloured slightly and let go of Neville to wipe at the chocolate on his own trousers. He wondered why all of his nicknames featured ducks. Neville instead smiled thankfully and focused once more on McGonagall.
“And you’re...okay with that? It being ‘very muggle’?” Potter used quotation marks. Draco grimaced.
"But that's the fun of birthdays. Not needing to buy stuff yourself."
"Ugh, too true."
"And what does spew intend to do?"
"Really? Why’d you do that?" I saw Malfoy open his mouth to sarcastically reply but I shot him a glance that said 'please don't'. He thankfully understood and closed his mouth back up.
! We are calm collected purebloods who have certain qualities and beliefs we must stand by!”
"And why were you 'handflapping'?" Snape asked condescendingly. Draco saw Terry scratch at his arms.
“In the common room it looked like you were getting pretty chummy.” She smirked. “On the sofa.” She watched in delight as his brown complexion managed to take on a slightly red hue.
“Concerned about what?”
No regard for the fact that it was a cold and grey winter day without a ray of run to be seen for miles.
"It's fine, I struggle with languages. And you're right anyway, you
"What's that supposed to mean?" She tried standing up for herself.
I’ll give you a hint: only one of those things was true.
Stupid embarrassing Potter.
"Sure!"
"Eh, I'm afraid our version will probably be wayyyy tamer and wayyyy more boring. Or, at least, I don't think they'll let anybody die." Octavia tuned back in to Dumbledore.
You can’t hold that against me!”
“Yes, thats right. And if you don’t mind, I have a couple of questions.” She told him.
“You’re not a reporter are you?” He joked. She didn’t laugh.
They set off where Danny lead them, past the passages to the second year dorms, a couple of lefts then a right, tapping a snake statue on a head with a wand, and turning through a more slimy passageway that opened because of it.
"How did you remember it word for word?" I asked through my wheezes. He smirked and took of the glasses, Transfiguring them back into a lamp.
"Do you know about the recent discovery of a new kind of sentient Myosotis variety? Apparently they can sing." Neville asked Michael.
Then he started laughing.
“Yeah-um, I mean no! That’s fine, you can go ahead. To brush my hair, that is.”
Terry started handflapping to ease the discomfort he felt. Draco cast a small containment charm around the cauldron so that it wouldn't spill anywhere, and to let Terry flap his hands more freely.
"Once a baby sister, always a baby sister, now cover your ears. Who knows what other swears he might teach you!"
“It isn’t just a ‘swear’, you- you- you-!” Granger began to fill with rage, her hair seeming to frizz up even more. Draco tried not to snort at the funny picture she made. “It’s a slur. A filthy awful slur that tries to demean muggleborns purely based on their blood status , which is completely arbitrary since we can both do magic just fine!” She scolded him.
Draco woke up happy. He didn’t know where he was, but he did know that he felt safe. He was leant against something comfortable, and was being held safely. Draco wasn’t very used to affection, but he had to admit in his dream addled state, he could see why others liked it.

"Why did you take the blame for it? I know you wouldn't have made that mistake, so why subject yourself to Snape's wrath?" Draco asked him, Anthony and Terry nodding to this.
Who would even like a stupid fool like Potter. He’s silly and self sacrificing and is a right cunt at the best of times. He can take a punch and keep on coming, but that just means he doesn’t know how to quit. He’s a pretty good wizard, but it’s all an over exaggeration, and he doesn’t even get that good grades. He smells bad, he’s unfashionable, he doesn’t know how to groom, he’s talked about far too much, he’s full of himself, needs to be brought down to earth all the time, and he’s a dick to all Slytherins.
“Did you just compare my parents’ murder to rumour spreading?”
"Well what was I supposed to do? You were acting suspicious, and in the end you were up to something!" I pointed out.
He did so for another few hours, but couldn’t quite focus on his work as the birthday list stared at him.
“Do you think I could come with you for this one?” Draco bartered. Aunt Bella cooed.
Before she was imprisoned in Azkaban to atone for her crimes, she made a daring escape from her holding cell. She stole back her wand, Apparated to Malfoy Manor, stole the Malfoy child in the dead of night and fled.
A beat of silence.
“Why do you have to carry me like this?”
Martha had so much to say, a real motormouth. And all of her incredible stories and drama made Octavia feel pretty boring. All she’d known all her life life was the manor and it’s grounds, maybe their holiday home in France. Her social life was strictly her parents, her tutors, the portraits on the walls, and Draco. Martha seemed to have lived more than Octavia, and it made her a bit jealous at times.
He snorted. “Hermione said that. Can’t see why he would be, unless he really wants to die while at school four years running.”
"Hello there dearie, are you okay?" It took Draco a second to realise the woman was talking to him.
He thought he heard a noise, like a footstep, near the Gryffindor entrance and assumed McGonagall. He spun round in fear, gripping his wand tightly. After a quick check around the area and not seeing anyone, he continued on his way.
“Hey.” She said.
“I always think about going to a potions shop in Knockturn and taking a whole bunch of sleeping draught vials.” She’d said. “They wouldn’t care, they don’t balance amounts. Then I’d go back to my flat and drink them all. It might take days before anyone finds me, no one would even care. My body would be rotting by then.” She’d told him. Then she had started crying. “I think about it all the time. My body lying there on my carpet, dead as Greg. Only if have no Vince to mourn me.” Then she’d started laughing, and Draco took the wine bottle from her.
