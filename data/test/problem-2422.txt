“I know, I know. I was never bitten, but she did strangle me a few times, until I was close to death, as a punishment for not being quicker with the Vanishing Cabinet, or for any other thing I have ever done wrong in Riddle’s eyes. Sometimes, she would wind her tail around my upper left arm, so that the blood circulation was blocked. Riddle liked to see how far he could push people until they broke, either mentally or physically.”
“Scorp, you realise that it’s for the better, that he doesn’t fight. It’s better this way,” the second –obviously Potter’s- voice sounded. Scorpius mumbled something Draco didn’t hear, but it made Potter chuckle. “You should talk to him about this, not to me.”
“They can, if they would skip two Potions lessons. Two, Malfoy; surely, you can miss them.”
“Yeah? Well, I can’t believe
“And you have four children. How are you going to divide it between them?”
“Where is Scorpius?” Draco asked, frowning.
Draco heard the underlying question and saw it in Scorpius’s smirk. Apparently, Potter noticed too, because he chuckled and shook his head.
himself, but the other members in the rehabilitation centre did. It was the talk of the day, how Draco had been attacked on Memorial Day, and how it was a curse that no one knew, and the Healers couldn’t counter. As soon as Greg heard about it, he asked his mentor whether he could go visit Draco in the hospital. He arranged to be picked up by Pansy, since members of the centre weren’t allowed to Apparate on their own. Blaise joined their party.
“Are you trying to be sarcastic? Because let me tell you something, sarcasm only works if you show it in your tone of voice as well.”
“Papa, this is how
“What are you talking about?” George asked.
Draco and Potter didn’t get a chance to answer, because everyone started talking at once, giving Draco the opportunity to send Phi off to bed, give Cassie her good night hug, explained some insignificant detail of the workings of Patronuses to Aquila, and share a loaded look with Scorpius. Potter finished his own rituals quickly enough, and they were alone again.
When he threw the door open, he was glad to notice all students were seated at their desks, and not flinging spells around.
At dinner, Draco had a long and enjoyable talk with Potter, mostly about Boxing Day and the Weasleys, to try and find out what he could buy for them. It would be small presents, since he didn’t know them very well and he had no idea what was expected of him.
“Are you sure that that wasn’t your gay awakening?”
The children all picked up their bags and hurried towards their rooms, leaving Potter and Draco smiling at each other.
“That’s all right. Mull the idea over in your head, it’ll only start sounding better.”
“Well, it does heal scars. Not all of them, though; one has to apply the potion within 48 hours after the thick crust having loosened. Especially combined with dittany, it works incredibly. Well done, James. You have successfully made your own potion. Theresa, if you would add the last ingredients and stir twenty times clockwise, please.”
Draco hummed. “Care to explain?”
They had been relatively safe, but ten years after their daughter was born, they had to run away from a new wave of Death Eater imprisonments. Jackie had lived the last year before Hogwarts with her grandmother, a half-blood Slytherin, and she was a second-year student now.
“I know that, but why do that thing you always do?” Potter sounded slightly distressed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This afternoon, he decided to ply me with Veritaserum. Luckily, it’s just Neville, so I know he knows he owes me big time.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, me too. Ehm, I enjoyed our evening.”
“You don’t have the right to say that. You don’t have the right to insult my papa like that, at all. He has made mistakes, I know he has. I know he was on the wrong side of the war. I know he has cast Unforgivables, and I think he may have killed people. He was a child! And he is trying to become a better person. Ever since the war, he has tried to make up for his mistakes!”
Potter grinned apologetically, moving to the kitchen and returning with another steaming mug, offering it to Draco. “And she woke you?”
“Because it’s stable –“ Another round of giggling. “- and when I pulled it up, I didn’t want a magical constructor to come around. You would have gotten suspicious.”
“Behave like you taught me to?”
Draco heard Potter’s breathing hitch from time to time, eyes wide open in surprise and confusion. He smiled softly to reassure Potter.
I hope you enjoyed it! If you did, and even if you didn't, leave me some comments! Comments get Draco and Harry get together faster! And it makes me feel good, so yeah, leave comments!
Draco nodded. “To ‘protect’ me, they had to know my whereabouts and my secrets. She told ‘em everything.”
It didn’t work. Cassie only moved away from him whenever he made the shushing sounds. Finally, Potter understood.
Potter laughed, and they both moved to the sofa to sit down. When Potter looked at him expectantly, Draco sighed and thought about something fun to tell.
Around midnight, Draco and Narcissa could finally go home. Narcissa was happily chattering about the success of the evening and all the new acquaintances she had made. She seemed very happy to be hosting parties again, even if she wasn’t the official host, and no one really came for her. Narcissa said, in a bout of honesty in between her exclamations, how much she had missed being responsible for the welcome feeling of guests.
“Jackie’s parents are found,” he then announced.
“As I said, classes start in twenty-five minutes. You don’t have time to change and have breakfast. Also, you are not leaving my room, dressed in only pyjamas.”
“No? You don’t want that? What do you want then? I don’t know many other dance moves. Should I sing for you? I’m not good at singing, but –“
“Papa?” “Dad?”
“Well, what do you want to do?” Potter asked, knitting his eyebrows together when he saw Draco push away his plate.
Potter didn’t want to think it, but –very fleetingly- it occurred to him that Draco was a very attractive man, and he was a wonderful papa.
He cares for Potter. Alright. He can live with that. And if Potter would want to try again and perhaps give him a chance of friendship, he wouldn’t refuse. Being friends with Potter, how would that be? Being able to laugh with him. But then he would also have to be friends with Mudblood and Weasel.
“Dad! You managed to get the Aurors in, then?”
Draco had always loved to sing, as was evident by his way of cheering up his fellow Slytherins during the war. When his children were born, he always sang for them, to calm them down, get them to sleep or just because.
“You’ve had a bad influence on me.”
“I think I will be, as long as no one offers to bring me alcohol or gamble with me.”
“You shouldn’t let people walk all over you. Harry, you have to make sure people don’t walk all over him. He lets that happen,” Pansy complained.
Potter’s finger halted for a split second before it continued its route, almost going unnoticed by Draco. Almost.
“Sometimes, Cassie drives me crazy,” he admitted with a grin. “She is so wild, it’s a miracle she’s still alive and well. Her energy is just too much sometimes. But other times it really lifts the mood.”
“And when I think that, I feel guilty, I feel filthy, because he’s my
“I think he is, yes. At least, I
be alone together tonight, do you understand?” he warned half-playfully.
Anyways, enjoy!
“Because I really,
“Which spell?”
“How close we are getting to finding the person that is behind all this. What if we find them?”
Downstairs, the Potters and Malfoys had put on a movie, pausing it until Draco and Phi had returned. Draco pushed the two best looking cookies in his son’s hands and directed him to one of the chairs in front of the television.
“Papa, sing Jason Mraz! Will you do that?” Aquila asked enthusiastically. Scorpius grinned and nodded. Draco knew he would do whatever they asked him to do. He couldn’t deny them anything.
Potter leant in to kiss him again. “Hmm, couldn’t agree more.”
Potter frowned. “Aren’t those highly addictive?”
Potter sidled up next to Draco, leaning against the wall of one of the hallways. “Do you want something to drink? They’re making mulled wine.”
“Dare.”
“How awkward would it have been if you didn’t.”
“I don’t know what this has to do with you.”
“I’m Terence Goldstein, fourteen years old, and former student of Professor Malfoy. Oh, and Housemate of his daughter and classmate of his son.”
“They actually accepted me relatively well. I tried to communicate with them like we sometimes do in the Slytherin dorm through the glass, but they weren’t the ones that come close to the castle, so they didn’t recognise it. They felt threatened by my movements, I think. When I had to go up for air because my Gillyweed stopped working –“
“There is a note, saying it is for you collection. What collection does he mean, Draco?” Blaise interrupted. Draco paled and blushed. With pink tinged ears, he closed his eyes.
piece?”
“Of course I am. I always am.”
George laughed. “I believe Ophiuchus is preparing for next year. He is thrilled to go to Hogwarts.”
, I tell you!”
“Your jokes are no fun, George. You should treat guests with kindness.”
Pulling Cassie a little bit closer, Harry nodded. “Aquila is in St. Mungo’s, Draco is with her. She has been tortured with the Cruciatus Curse. Healer Brinsbridge is treating her as we speak.”
Only, it was empty. Potter came to a halt in front of a large, man-sized portrait of a Scottish laird in hunting plaid, posing with his early twentieth century gun and a dead deer behind him. Potter double-checked the Map. Draco’s name was pacing up and down the very hallway Potter was standing in.
Draco turned around to see Potter holding something in his hands. His mouth fell open and Draco’s posture stilled. He swallowed heavily.
“With me, now,” he growled. Pushing them in front of him, not caring for gentleness or kindness, he marched them towards a silent corridor to have a very rigid interrogation. Because no matter what everyone said about the Malfoy family, Potter knew Draco would never allow his children to do such a thing, and Ophiuchus would never do something like this without being bullied into it.
Potter grinned wide at Draco. “And pray tell, how does good underwear keep them close?” he chuckled. Draco scowled slightly at him, and Pansy answered for him again.
“Ah.” Lucius shifted in his chair and folded his hands. “It weakens that which an individual values most about themselves. Quite tragic.”
“What?”
“How would you know?” Lily challenged.
“But what if people would like to know what I have to say?” he persisted. “Are you going to detract points for that as well?”
to testify in my favour, not be forced into it. If they believe I’m innocent, they will testify. I’m sure.”
He smiled at his mother and offered his arm to walk her outside to Apparate to Malfoy Lodge, where the children were waiting. Narcissa frowned lightly.
Hope you liked it! I'm craving for your comments and opinions!!
“Because I don’t see why I wouldn’t be. Are there any real objections to me?” Potter returned, feeling his old ire against the man rise.
BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THE OLYMPICS?!?!?!????????? IREEN WUST WON 1500M ICESKATING TODAY. FOUR OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS FOR HER. THAT'S MY GIRL RIGHT THERE. SHE DID THAT. SHE FRIGGING DID THAT. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE I CAN'T. IREEN WUST DID THAT. FUCKING HELL FANTASTIC. I CAN'T BREATHE. I'M CRYING
George’s warning didn’t sit well with that voice in Draco’s head that had been uttering similar warnings all day, but Draco shrugged it off and stepped outside with Potter’s hand in his.
The robes were the exact colour of the logo, and there were many house-elf figurines on it, all charmed to move. Some Apparated to another spot, others waved and even different ones were carrying protest signs. It was tastefully done, even if they were a bit childish. It didn’t really matter.
“We’ll be at the Department of Mysteries, Cassie. You can’t just get in there, let alone while carrying dungbombs or firecrackers. They won’t allow it.”
Need to talk about love, life or loath? I'm available :D i-am-and-proud
A yellow flash, a scream and a disgustingly broken leg before the Floo roared and Albus was swept away.
that Potter had.
Afternoon classes were stilted and tensed, in Draco’s classes, as well as Potter’s, as well as all children’s. It only added to Draco’s irritation and he irked to let out some steam. Unfortunately, right after afternoon classes ended, Draco was supposed to be at the duelling demonstration, and actually take part in it. He didn’t feel good about it.
!’ and a slap on the wrist from Lily. “What? Don’t tell me you don’t agree with me, I heard you say the exact same thing yesterday,” Phi threatened.
Potter sipped slowly from his wine, not wanting to get tipsy while he was steering the boat. “Really? How do you know?”
“Then you or Dean!” Ginny chirped, pinning Draco to his chair with fearless curiosity.
Scorpius and James were shouting, hurt plain on their faces and anger in their features. It took an Auror force of four men to calm them down.
“You gave all kinds of personal information away to someone I didn’t want to be vulnerable with! That’s not very kind either,” Draco defended himself, a high blush on his cheeks. “Anyway, I didn’t get very far because suddenly
“That’s all right. Are we going to make a plan or are we just going to barge in?”
a Weasley jumper? What is that twisted logic?” George snickered.
“Right. No, I don’t. Ted, I hate you. I’ve nothing.”
? How?”
“You’re an idiot.”
“Please, Malfoy, you must be here somewhere?”
“Ah no, it’s really just a shack. But, you know, it’s…”
“You’re overlooking the fact that Neville actually cares for you and he feels bad for letting you think that he doesn’t. And you know I don’t approve of your manipulative tactics, but they are good.”
“I know.”
James saw a flinch in Mr. Malfoy’s expression, only belatedly realising that naming that name in the Malfoy Manor might not be the best idea.
“I look like shit, papa. Aquila is so beautiful, and then I come along, with my stocky limbs that have no curves except for muscles. I should have been a guy, with the body I have. I was hoping it would look better if my hair was done.”
Draco grinned. “Oh no, Potter, I don’t do relationship advice. People have to sort out their relationships by themselves.”
“Yes, James?”
“Papa, why do we have to go to bed? It’s only half past eleven! Let us stay up a bit longer, please!”
“And that isn’t a big deal?” Potter said in a high-pitched voice, slightly panicked. “It was a
“I told you,” Lucius said. “He is dying.”
Meanwhile, somewhere in London, a family of three children and their dad were seated in the sitting room, all holding a glass of drinks.
“Since this is a Death Eater we are dealing with,” Whithal said with the most infuriating smirk. Belatedly, he added with a sneer, “
“What about Ron?” Draco asked, swallowing a bite.
Gaping a bit, Draco stared at Potter while the latter opened the door to the guest room. “Th- thank you,” he managed eventually. “That’s very considerate of you.”
“Is that necessary? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’d love to beat the shit out of whoever is responsible for all the hurt you’ve been through, but we won. We already won, Malfoy. There isn’t a reason to fight anymore.”
Smiling slightly, Draco nodded. “I suppose. Do you want to continue walking?”
“Thank you for bringing them.”
“No.”
“Why was he rejected?”
“Sit,” George ordered. Draco raised an eyebrow, but sat down anyway.
“Why?”
“Professor Malfoy, you are forgetting that this is a highly complicated potion, not accidentally brewed. Only skilled witches and wizards can do such a thing. Besides, why would anyone brew an Animagus potion without intending to become an Animagus, and why would that person use the mandrake’s leaf in their mouth? Coincidentally during a full moon, nonetheless!”
“That’s because I keep getting better. Anyway. How is rehab, Greg?”
“And you have apparently hit puberty. Come on, on your own two feet.” Draco put her down just as Phi curled underneath his arm and made his own place right there, close to him.
“Not my hair, not my hair, not my –“
“I said they were Dark so you wouldn’t tell anyone that I used them,” Draco deflected. He opened his mouth to say something else, when he saw the expression on Harry’s face.
“Exactly. It’s a Slytherin thing. But I know a bit and it’s going all right.”
“I was wrong, I was so, so wrong,” Cassie whimpered in Draco’s collarbone. “What can I do, papa, please, help me. I don’t want this anymore. I want them gone from our lives, I want to pretend that this never happened. Papa, I did so many bad things.”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Scorpius took over. “You look dashing in those robes, but is today a special day?”
Somewhere around the end of the party, Potter had stopped following him. Draco was relieved about this; he was supposed to have fun. At the bar, he asked for another Coke, when a hand very softly and very fleetingly touched his lower back. He turned around to glare at his assaulter, when he met bright green eyes.
Albus opened his mouth to answer, but was shushed by Cassie.
the SHS was about Albus? Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Your tea is spiked with Veritaserum,” James shrugged simply. “Unfortunately for you, Draco, you now have a healthy dose of Veritaserum in your veins.”
“So?”
“Please, Potter. If there is anyone that could trigger a gay awakening, it wouldn’t have been Vince.”
Seeing Draco become agitated and annoyed, James cut in. “Theresa, I know that they are in agreement over whatever it is. Draco is treating him like Dad wants him to. I mean… Everything is okay.”
“How is he?” Narcissa asked softly.
Shit.
of yours wasn’t rich or famous yet.”
He kept thinking about it while walking away from the courtroom. When he moved to open the door and go outside, he was stopped by a hand on his shoulder. He turned around and saw Potter and Kingsley Shacklebolt standing behind him. Potter quickly removed his hand from Draco’s shoulder.
“Where did you find this?”
“The third stage of our courtship.”
“An AK can be countered by love, right? That’s what Draco also told us. It doesn’t always work on the victim, but it does on the person they try to protect. So if an AK can be countered, why not this stupid little curse?” Blaise complained.
Locking the office behind her again, Ms. Euripideia turned left, following the witch. Draco felt a light tug on his arm as he went out of the Department.
With a nod, Potter and Lucius seemed to come to an understanding. A truce of sorts, where the only binding factor is their love for Draco.
And all was well.
“It looks new,” Dean observed.
“Oh,” Neville responded. After a while, he added, “What about you? What’s your preference?”
“So. Sorry. I am just so angry at you.”
Draco smirked. “That’s because I’m unnaturally handsome.”
“Yes. As I said, they seem to be discussing stuff and whenever one of them says something the others agree with, Scorpius scribbles it down in that notebook he always carries with him. They won’t show any of us what it is, but they said we’d see when they were finished. Aquila told me they’d be finished this afternoon, probably, so that we only needed a bit more patience.”
“He wasn’t punished, but instead got a new house, married and lived happily ever after. Don’t you care about those he killed? People he murdered and tortured?”
“Quite right. I still don’t approve, though.”
hit, I’m still alive.”
“Just like old times. Thank you, Draco.”
Malfoy huffed again, followed by a deep, shaky inhale and something that sounded like a word.
“A collection I had, when I was younger.”
“’S not important,” Draco mumbled. After Lucius rolled his eyes, Draco copied the action and exhaled shakily. “I’ll need tea for this.”
“What did you expect? A hug, a kiss and a story before bedtime?” Draco snapped.
“Oh, you’re going to love this. So, there is this new House Secret. Apparently…” she started in a whisper. “…there is a Slytherin who’s in love with a Gryffindor! That’s so much fun, right?”
“Hmm. Well then. I assume you heard all about it?”
“Do you see my youngest sister Cassiopeia over there? She looks ill, doesn’t she? That is because she has trouble sleeping. She has nightmares. And last three weeks, she hasn’t had a full night of sleep, because there was no one to calm her down and care for her. This is how Cassie looks when papa is not with us.
“Have you never heard of a glow-in-the-dark Snitch?” Potter grinned.
“Thank Merlin for Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes,” Cassie remarked dryly.
“It’s a home. You grow adapted to the sounds, the smells, the texture. If you’ve lived in the same house ever since you were born, it becomes a part of you. It’s been built by your ancestors, the history is in your bones. Why do you think many pure-blood families have an entire gallery with portraits of their forefathers?”
“Four weeks isn’t that long. Most courtships take months, some even years. The third stage is supposed to last four times the time of the other two combined.”
“Why not?” Draco challenged.
Did I say that out loud?
by any chance? Apologies, son, my hearing is not what it used to be. Ah yes, I have seen the Malfoy lad. Just to be clear, you do mean the man of your age, yes? Not one of his children?”
“Potter, stop staring, it scares me,” Draco laughed, wrapping an arm around Potter’s waist.
He bit his lip, closing his eyes and wrapping both hands around Scorp’s. His humming slowly developed into soft singing, the song he always sang for Scorpius, in the hope that Scorpius might hear it through his unconsciousness.
Suzanne pushed James away laughingly before focussing on Draco. “Well, some Healing potions are a form of counterpotions. They can counter a charm, potion or spell. However, counterpotions aren’t always as successful as the proper countercharm, but they are easier to invent. And there is a lesser chance of mucking up.”
Cassiopeia Circinus Malfoy
McGonagall was just preparing a cup of tea when Draco walked in and immediately offered him a cup.
“Why, what did he want?” Blaise asked.
Draco tugged his arm free, looked at him murderously and walked away. He just couldn’t handle Potter right now.
Those stories begin at the divider, and end at the second divider. If you'd rather skip it, you can! (It's mostly canon re-writing, with here and there a bit of my own headcanon or ideas of what might have gone through Draco's head.)
He immediately dropped on the divan, but sprung up again when he saw Pansy and Blaise playing Wizarding chess.
“That’s because you were flabbergasted with my skills.”
Potter frowned. “There is niche behind you?”
The ‘old gang’ consisted of the required Gryffindors, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Seamus, Dean, Ginny, Parvati Patil and Lee Jordan, and Neville of course. Then there was Hannah who represented the Hufflepuffs, together with Susan Bones. The Ravenclaws present were Luna and Padma Patil. Pansy, Greg, Blaise, Theo and Draco were the Slytherin counterparts for this evening.
“Perhaps. If you could explain it in a letter, it will be fine. And ignore Father, he’ll be in a strop about not seeing Phi or Aquila.”
When he strode through the Great Hall to meet Astoria in the entryway, he knew he attracted attention. His children gazed at him with sharp eyes and obviously looked at each other to see if either of their siblings knew what was happening.
A wild grin appeared on Potter’s face. “Do you have any other plans, then?”
“Since when are you so into the communication thing?”
“Yeah, yeah, well enough. Where were you this morning, though?”
“And by the way, if the two of you would finally stop acting like skittish little pups around each other, Draco might just be more than just a professor to us.”
pathetic. No ‘almost’ about it).
“Well, you’re close. It’s right here, actually. I’m surprised you didn’t realise.”
“So, you and Harry are quite serious, aren’t you?” Pansy chuckled.
“You couldn’t have heard that, the magical spheres were soundproof. Never mind, I mean that we can’t get the branch, because Neville doesn’t want us to. I’m not going to take one of his plants without his permission.”
“Shut it. It’s not about gender. It’s about compatibility. As I was saying, a male and a female are compatible, because they balance each other out, most often. They are drawn to each other like no other pair. It is inevitable. And therefore, relationships between male and female – or relationship between highly compatible counterparts – can’t be stopped. Whatever there is between them, can’t be surpassed by relationships between two individuals that are too alike. Counterparts will… are unstoppable, and it is no one’s fault that the counterparts choose each other. It can’t be helped.”
They were silent, Potter fiddling with a loose thread of the pillow he was leaning against, and Draco looking at his hands.
They stared at one another, after which James continued in a quieter tone. “My aunts and uncles, and grandparents, and my cousins most of all, would fight for you, always. Teddy keeps asking when you get back to another family event, because he feels you are the closest he will ever get to his real parents. We all love you so much, and you just… You just don’t have faith in us.”
“Scorp, I’m sorry,” Albus whispered.
“Yes, I can imagine. Professor Lupin was a good teacher. He actually taught us some useful stuff.” He ignored the amused look Blaise and Pansy exchanged, before agreeing with him.
“I don’t know about Cassiopeia, really. Scorpius stood up for Albus, when Albie had gotten into the Hospital Wing, and then Scorpius became their next victim. If you want to know what they’ve done to him…” Potter broke off and hesitated some more. While catching Draco’s eye, he shows the most sincere and regretful face, and said:
“What can we do?”
Potter was also trying to catch his attention, but Draco studiously ignored him. Ophiuchus was still a bit more subdued than he normally was, and he was also spending most of his time in Draco’s class, but right now, he was sitting with his siblings at the Slytherin table. He wasn’t cast aside by anyone, except for a few students who were already not very fond of the Malfoy family. They could live with it.
When Draco kept silent, George touched his hand –with no interruption from Smiths, because he was humane enough to know that Draco needed
“What a coincidence,” Draco then drawled. “Phi, I’ll be with you in a moment. Potter, if you would like to join us, you are more than welcome.”
“What does it say?” Draco ripped the note from Potter’s hands, quickly scanning over it.
“Yes, yes, I can,” Draco snarled. “Give me a pain potion, moron.”
“We would be spending two night at your house, then. Are you sure that’s all right?”
says that it’s someone who works there permanently, with all the gossip and rumours of Wizarding Britain. They just never see this person, as they send their articles in by owl and never personally. Is he the one that has always been writing about you?”
“Telling me your nightmare. Which you should, otherwise it’ll become worse and worse and you’ll have no one to talk to.”
“It is not proper to not go together,” Lucius persisted.
“You idiot,” Scorpius whispered. “Don’t ever go do something alone, okay? You don’t have a double last-name for nothing.”
Merlin, was it a Gryffindor trait, or were Potters so easily riled up?
“My nickname for her. So they have been in regular contact, sometimes even more than once a day, and on New Year’s, Aquila got a letter from Matias, on which he had listed his New Year’s resolutions. It was a long list, but Aquila read it all because Matias had all these funny comments on his own resolutions. And then somewhere in the middle, very inconspicuously, there was this resolution saying ‘ask Aquila out on a date’, and nothing else. According to Aquila, Matias had thought she wouldn’t read the entire list, unless she was at least a bit interested. So the next day, Aquila sent an owl back with her own resolutions, one of which was ‘say yes to a date with Matias,’ and that was that.”
“I’m not sure that is a good idea,” Potter started hesitantly. Surely Draco wouldn’t want to talk about this, especially not with his children around. Besides, what would they need to discuss? What’s in the past, is in the past. And he knew the facts already.
every time! Papa, you
“Yeah, but Aquila was sweet enough to teach me how to make a Patronus and how to get it to talk. Did you know I have an owl as my Patronus? How cool is that!”
“Don’t you think Colin is hot?” Potter said, talking about the character Colin from
It was safe now. Draco was safe. He would never have to see the box again, either. He could stop this obsession with Potter. He could start living a life without the influence of Harry Potter, without the boy making an appearance in his mind every now and then. It was a chapter Draco could end.
Lily nodded seriously, glancing at Draco again, who was talking to Manila, the Gryffindor girl Albus was rumoured to have a crush on. At least, the rumour was only known to James, Potter and Draco, and probably Scorpius as well.
James took a few steps so he was closer to Draco and less people would overhear them.
“What do you suggest then, Malfoy?” he glared.
Potter still didn’t answer right away. Draco rolled his eyes at him, prompting Potter to quietly murmur ‘yes’ and looking at his feet. “I can sleep on the couch, it’s no problem at all,” he hastened to say.
Don't hesitate to comment! Comments make these oblivious men realise their undying love for each other faster!
“Finally, we see the most recent memory. Ms. McGonagall is explaining to the children why Mr. Malfoy is arrested by the Aurors. When she says that he is charged for mistreatment of his children, their first reaction is to laugh and think it a joke. Ms. McGonagall needs about five minutes to convince them that it really is true, and that some people really do think Mr. Malfoy mistreated them. All seven of them decide that it is nonsense, and resolve to help Mr. Malfoy.”
“That’s very nice for the concerning Slytherin. And there is also no suspicion of who it might be?”
“Malfoy, I’m serious. I’ve grown up, I’ve gotten more relaxed,” Potter now insisted, annoyance clear.
“Don’t worry, we love you too,” James’s voice sounded behind them. “Hi. I was just checking up on you. Wanted to talk to you for a moment. If that’s okay.”
Draco was saved by the appearance of Albus.
“I know, I know, it was stupid. But I think that perhaps this was the only way to make you understand I wasn’t imagining things.”
Now and forever more.
“My mother read it aloud for me. Was that Jackie’s?”
“Because, Ms. Zarnel, I could use an extra pair of skilled hands. The potions we’ll be making, can be difficult and even dangerous if done wrong. Precision and complete concentration will be necessary. Speed can also be important. I’ve seen you make two potions, one of which was a Mastery potion, in one lesson. But of course, I could just choose an actual Mastery student, instead of you. I’m not the one who would lose.”
Because he was a professor, he was let in easily. The Ravenclaw common room was beautiful, with pretty blue colours and a friendly atmosphere. The students looked at him in surprise, some with a scowl and others with a smile. “Where is Aquila?” he asked one student who looked nice enough. The girl stood up and moved to the stairs towards the dormitories.
Draco had been right to call it a maze: several dead-end corridors made it difficult to navigate, and tracking spells all dismantled as soon as they were cast. Potter kept grumbling his protest, until it become lighter and they arrived where he had first seen Tom Riddle. Draco had managed to avoid the basilisk’s body, still rotting in the dungeons, but its tail could be seen from their vantage point.
Harry sat down on the sofa, staring at the box like Draco had before. “So now we know the name.”
Upon hearing this, Zarnel’s mouth fell open and she gaped at Draco.
He stood up, signed for Theresa to stand a few metres away and grabbed his wand to cast the newly made up spell for the first time.
“And, because every aspect of a spell has a separate effect on the subject, all those aspects can be countered with a potion. The trick is to invent a potion that counters all effects, without any nasty side-effects or unwanted results. It takes a lot of research, knowledge and dedication. You’ll need great capability in potions, spells, wandlore and Arithmancy. All in all, not many can invent one.”
Aquila was not only clever and witty, she was also very beautiful. She had the thick, black hair of her mother, but lacked the air of arrogance that seemed to waft around Astoria. And where Astoria’s hair was sleek and static, Aquila’s locks curled and always seemed to be softly touched by a breeze. Draco strongly disliked having such a daughter. She was bound to attract boys, and what if a Weasley or a Potter laid their hands on her? Draco also knew that there was a danger of unwelcome attention. He raged inside, whenever he thought of someone touching her without her permission.
“I – I hadn’t thought that far ahead yet. What do you feel like doing?”
“I do that sometimes, yeah. When I had to put it away quickly because there were people coming. So my question is, how could she get her hands on the Map if I’ve got it with me all the time?”
“Sir? You’re the boy’s father? Can I see you identification, please, so I can start filling out this form?” a third nurse, a calm-looking woman with mousy brown hair and blue eyes, said gently. A Healer came rushing past, walking into Scorpius’s room. Draco thrust his papers to the woman.
Cassie rolled her eyes. “We didn’t get lost. You knew where we were going. What’s the problem?”
“What consequences?” one of the Weasleys asked.
It resulted in a deep sigh from George. “I know Harry wants to befriend you. Why don’t you let him?”
“Don’t be angry about it.”
“Morning, Potter,” Draco greeted cheerily. Potter smiled at him with a small glance, but quickly turned his head to face Draco fully. His smile broadened.
“Oh! No, the tutu is Aquila’s, from when she was younger. How did that end up here?”
have a competent teacher. I was saddled with a man who hated teaching and hated me even more.”
“You don’t have much say in it, do you?” James grinned. “Unless you would be my papa.”
Potter nodded. “I am aware. However, if I remember correctly, this is the proper way to file a complaint without stepping directly to the Department Head, isn’t it?”
“Exactly. So I won’t be attending many more of these evenings. You are my replacement,” Lucius pointed out.
“That doesn’t seem very relaxed,” Potter said, nodding to Draco’s arm.
“That’s too bad. Aren’t you curious to know what Professor Flitwick would think of it?” Priscus now narrowed his eyes in suspicion. He was catching on to what Draco was doing.
“And you needed my help?”
Okay, so I just wrote an entire chapter in one day. I guess I was inspired. And I still owed you a chapter, because I had skipped one. Perhaps even two. Anyways, a new chapter. Yay!
“But who? I know you’re not the most liked person in this country, but people also don’t want to have blood on their hands. People don’t like to kill, Draco.”
The Malfoy, Potter and Weasley children, who had now started to call themselves the Order of the Unicorn, eventually came up with sixty-seven ideas to achieve their goal, all of which were wonderful and worth a shot.
Potter leaned back in his chair, resting his head against it. “Even from me?” he pouted, fluttering his eyelashes jokingly.
Seeing that Harry was at a loss for words, and seeing the grins on their children’s faces grow wicked, Draco decided to do something about it. He took Harry’s hand and pushed the silver band on his finger.
“Okay, okay. I have one question, though. Cassie was a Hatstall, Slytherin and Gryffindor, right? How does that match up with resembling you?”
“Merlin,” Pansy sighed. “He has three different types of plates. Do you really think he needs extra in case one breaks?”
“Do you regret it, Malfoy?” Potter asked. “Our first meeting? Is that why Ophiuchus insisted you shook my hand, that first night here? Because Merlin knows I regret it.”
“All right. Oh, I have treacle tart, if you want?” Draco offered then, thinking of the tart in his kitchenette. He saw Potter’s jaw slack and he started nodding vigorously. Draco huffed out a laugh at that.
Biting his lip, Potter turned back to Draco. “I don’t know Whithal very well, but Septimius is a bit of a nitwit. He’ll believe anything anyone tells him. He was the worst trainee that ever made it through training. Auror Smiths? Can you tell me something about Whithal?”
Harry smiled. “Can we? Yay, I like that. Okay, so, yesterday we went to the beach. It was really beautiful, we had a lovely meal –“
Draco shrugged. “You had your reasons. And good ones, may I add.”
“Yes, and that Wizengamot hates you. If they have allowed the case to include your Mark, you stand no chance.”
“Yes, like Aquila. Because you are curious enough, and critical, and very smart. If you like, you could be in Hufflepuff. Politeness and supporting people is important to you, right? You want people to go to you for support and a friendly face?” Phi nodded eagerly.
“But he’s just so –“ the girl with the crush started.
“I know,” Draco frowned. “What does that have to do with this?”
Potter quickly plopped down on one of the chairs at the dining table, waiting until Draco had brought down the plates of food. They ate silently, glancing at each other and smiling around their forks when they were caught looking.
Draco’s mind supplied. To be quite frank, he hadn’t thought Potter would pull such a childish prank. Especially because he must have known Draco was in this for real. It wasn’t something Potter would do. Something wasn’t right here.
“No, they weren’t very good. I – I know that you were the one who called their names. But if you hadn’t done it, someone else would have. Anyways, they had the Mark. It was kind of their own fault, even if they took it out of fear instead of beliefs. So I want to apologise for the way I’ve been ignoring and freezing you out.”
“It was worth a try. Then my question is… Was he a Slytherin?”
Draco frowned. “Who is Sirius Black, mother?” he asked as softly as she talked.
“I really really like you, Malfoy. You’re a fantastic human being.”
“Absolutely. Does this mean we will be Malfoy-Potter from now on?”
“Sap,” Draco chuckled, but burrowed closer and whispered, “I love you too.”
“Yes.”
“You know… Who he is, who Harry is, what they did when they were younger. He doesn’t know what to do with himself.”
“You’re the definition of ‘desperately-needing-some-styling-advice, my friend.”
Albus shook his head disbelievingly. “Your papa can’t have said that last bit. He wouldn’t. Would he?”
“Why am I always challenged by Potters?” Draco asked Aquila. She laughed heartily in response.
Potter looked surprised. “Yeah, well, he is Albus’s best friend.”
Draco leaned back in his chair. “Among others. I also want presents for the Weasleys.”
“You don’t trust them to make the right decisions?”
“Perhaps,” she gasped. “Perhaps one of our treasures will even get involved with one of the Weasleys! Can you imagine the pain you would inflict on your parents? The shame that will wash over the Malfoy heritage?”
“Papa, I really don’t know who is doing this. I’m not even sure it is about you and Ha- Mr. Potter, since there has been an update while you were hiding out, and they speak of a blushing Slytherin, which is so far from what I would ever describe you as. I’ve been trying to find out, but whoever is doing this, is extremely good at being stealthy. Or at spell work.”
“I don’t know. I get the idea he is withholding his anger. Perhaps he’s blaming himself, and it’s eating him up.”
“And Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream from Ben & Jerry’s. Who knew you would prefer Muggle brands over Wizarding ones!”
“You and your white chocolate. Gross. But I wanted to ask you something. About me being an Animagus. Am I going to be registered?”
“How did you get in?”
Movements that were exactly on the beat, where Draco checked his wrist as if checking a watch, his hands imitated mime movements to suggest feeling up a wall, and thrusting his balled fist through the former mentioned wall.
“What if Albus is in there? He’s
“Yes.”
“Do you want more tea?” Potter offered softly. He picked up the two mugs and went to the kitchenette to prepare fresh tea. While he was gone, Draco managed to finish one essay on the effect of stirring clockwise instead of anti-clockwise, but didn’t get much further.
“Well, it’s not just boy advice, because you also helped James get a date with a girl.”
Draco’s right hand had closed itself around his forearm, around the Mark, that twisted and turned and bit. He was petrified, metaphorically and literally. Draco couldn’t move anymore, too invested in standing upright, in not screaming his lungs out, in breathing in and out and in.
“Potter,” Draco whispered with a horrified voice and wide eyes. “We have become the Weasleys.”
“Not, but
“You shouldn’t have given me a taste if you didn’t want me to beg for the rest.”
“Then, we see Mr. Malfoy speaking to his colleague, the flying instructor, with his youngest son Ophiuchus on his lap. Ophiuchus is tired and quiet. After a moment, Mr. Malfoy bends forward to whisper in his son’s ear, after which Ophiuchus smiles and curls up on Mr. Malfoy’s lap. Not long after, Ophiuchus falls asleep. Mr. Malfoy winds both arms around him and rocks him softly, caressing his hair without ceasing his conversation with the flying instructor.
Scorpius and Cassie shared a wide-eyed look. “Courtship?” they mouthed at one another. Albus raised an eyebrow, hugging Aquila while they tried to wrap their minds around possibly becoming siblings. James and Ophiuchus grinned, with Phi’s hair turning a vibrant green.
”Malfoy –“
Wincing, Draco pasted a smile on his face, but Andromeda had already seen it.
I’ll be there from this day on,
“Yes.”
“Malfoy, give me a proper kiss.”
“Let’s go upstairs and go to bed,” Potter said in lieu of answering. He led the children away, leaving Draco to follow a bit slower with James – and deliberately too, if his look was anything to go by.
Potter laughed. “It’s a good story, though. Isn’t your family French in origin? I believe Phi said something like that once.”
McGonagall had gotten a pinched expression and Flitwick looked like he was about to explode.
“Another professor,” Roxane mumbled.
“What for?” Draco asked, half-sitting on the table.
So, being the good human being he is, Draco opened the door further in invitation and walked to the kitchenette to pour him a glass of water. Potter silently followed him in and went to sit at the sofa.
Merlin’s beard.
“If you cut the leaves, I will prepare the cauldron and the fire. The first few times, I will do the checking spell myself, until I am sure it works correctly and without troubles. After that, I can teach you. Sounds good?” Draco explained. Theresa nodded sharply, while also paying attention to cutting the leaves in the right size.
At breakfast the next morning, Potter sat down and greeted him cheerily. The tension between them of last couple of weeks had lessened considerably.
“I must say, Phi, that I have had the best times of my life at Hogwarts. It was my first real home, even with the war going on. I didn’t have the best childhood, you know.” Why, why was Potter sharing this with a nine-year-old Malfoy of all people? And why did he have to mention the war? What was wrong with him? Draco clenched his jaw and tried to keep calm. Phi noticed his discomfort -or knew Draco well enough to know he would get uncomfortable- and leaned back heavily against his father’s chest.
Draco smiled. “My signature is on that paper, isn’t it? Potter, I want you to know that I love you a whole lot, and I have no idea what I would have done without you. So. Would you please forgive me for not telling you?”
Third, he sees Potter’s stance. Ready to fight, to defend. To die for people he loves. Determined.
“Only the three of you did, right?” Draco asked.
He was now sitting sideways, feet under his body and head lying on Draco’s chest. Draco’s arm rested on his thigh, the uncomfortable place where it had been before.
“Do you know who it is?” Neville tried.
Annoyed mumbling sounded from their bedroom door. “You two are hopeless and I absolutely despise you,” Aquila’s voice piped up, with a giggling James behind her.
He stood up and marched to the Slytherin common room, to see if there were any more notes on the SHS.
“All right, if you’re not willing to talk, I’ll start.” Draco lifted his hand to his chin and tapped it twice in thought. “Where shall I start? Ah yes. The girl is a Slytherin –“
“Yeah, are you coming out of your stupor yet, or are you going to stay there?” Dominique joked.
Cassie’s smile turned into a wicked smirk.
Smiths sighed before waving his wand. After a few seconds, the door opened, another Auror peeking out to hear what Smiths had to say. While George, Potter and Draco went over other mundane parts of their lives –like how George had pranked Narcissa with his teabags- the Aurors behind him seemed to have a quiet discussion. Eventually though, the door opened again and the two Aurors that had arrested Draco walked in.
When he left, Aquila had dragged Phi back to Matias and Cassie was searching through her bag, Scorpius and Albus bent towards each other.
Draco stood up, taking the four mugs and two wine glasses, to clean the tea mugs Pansy and Blaise weren’t using anymore and to refill the other glasses.
Of course, it had been orchestrated, that all of them left at the same time. The truth was, everyone had been completely on edge ever since the first year told them about the note. Therefore, a deal had been made, that when everyone was done eating, they would go to the common room and have a nice Slytherin evening. With the ultimate goal, of course, finding out who the Slytherin was that had fallen in love with a Gryffindor.
“He isn’t with you or Blaise? Not at the Manor?”
James grinned. “It was a consensus. But will she come back tomorrow?”
lucky. It served us well as a headquarters, to be fair. But it was only after the war that I managed to get it redecorated properly.”
“I’ll be back in half an hour,” Harry said firmly, taking his apron off and taking it into the back room to swap it for his cloak.
“That won’t be a problem,” Draco said softly, still gazing into the pen. Mr McGregor had moved closer to the glass now, looking at them curiously. “I’m rather housebound at the moment myself, thanks to this leg of mine.”
“Oh really? Why’s that?” Draco asked, also taking a sip from his glass.
Draco checked his watch again and nodded. “Yeah, go on then. Get coffee as well.”
Pansy raised an eyebrow. “You haven’t told him how you feel either, Draco.”
“Hmm, well, I’m not short of offers, put it that way,” Draco said, turning back to his mopping. “I’m picky though. I’m not going to settle for just anyone.”
As they worked side by side, their shoulders pressing together, Harry couldn’t help but think that Draco smelled good. He glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eye every now and then, taking in as much detail as he could about the other man’s appearance, from the tiny curl of hair at the nape of his neck to the minute freckles that were just visible on his cheek. Yes, he thought, Draco was certainly a very attractive man. Then he groaned softly.
“Well, I suppose so,” Pansy nodded. “I just don’t understand why he’s kept it secret for so long.”
“Thanks,” Draco said gratefully, accepting the cup. “I think I might need this.”
Harry blinked in surprise. “What? No, I–” he broke off as he, too, looked up at the display. “Oh.”
“I’ve been the same,” Draco admitted, taking another sip from his mug. “I’ve spoken to Pansy a few times, and Mother, of course, but other than that I haven’t done much at all.”
Sitting back, Draco watched as Harry began to stir.
“It’s been worth it though,” Harry said with a shrug and a grin. “Especially for this piece of treacle tart. Seriously, you made a good choice.”
Harry shook his head slightly. He still couldn’t quite believe that Ron and Hermione had children, even though Hugo was their second. He often wondered if their eleven year old selves would have believed this was how their lives would turn out.
“Is this better than last Valentine’s Day?”
“Mmhmm,” Pansy said, a smug smile appearing on her face. “That’s what your mouth says. Your face says different.”
“This is all quite new to me,” Harry said. “I’ve never really thought about the wider wizarding population of London before.”
Harry nodded. “I know. I’m happy to admit that.”
Harry sighed and slid off the stool once more, going into the back room to hang his cloak up in the cupboard. Then he moved to check the board that was situated on the wall. They had a couple of orders to make up today; bouquets for a hundredth birthday and a new baby. Making a note of the colours needed, Harry was in the middle of checking the ribbon drawer when he heard the bell above the door chime.
They fell silent for a few moments as they began to eat. Harry concentrated on his sandwich, while simultaneously trying not to let his coffee go cold.
“Are there any rules?” Harry asked, his brow furrowed slightly. “Flower arranging is subjective, isn’t it? So what looks good to one person might not look good to another, anyway.”
“Ron, shh!” Harry glanced around, his eyes wide as he dragged Ron to one side. “We haven’t told
“Well, yeah, but I mean, I didn’t think I’d have to make an effort outside of the shop too!” Ron said. “That is, you
“Ah, nice. I suppose that makes sense,” Harry said, looking around again. “You do have some electricity though?”
“I thought so too,” Draco replied, gesturing to Harry to sit down. “But you know what Mother is like. Very traditional.”
“Ha-ha,” Ron replied sarcastically, the tips of his ears red. “If that was the case, they’d all be for you.”
Draco settled into Harry’s side, leaning against him comfortably. “I think that next week, perhaps, we might need to have dinner with Pansy and Theo. Just so you know.”
“Well that’s something at least. Does he, er, know that I work here then?” Harry asked, unsure of what he wanted the answer to be.
“Even so… what do you say to dinner tomorrow?” Draco asked, biting the inside of his lip.
“Fancy a bacon sandwich?” Harry asked forty minutes later, looking over at Draco. “We’ve got time before we have to open up. My treat.”
Draco smiled and began to eat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked into the bowl and then up at Draco. “Is this treacle tart?”
“No, good point,” Harry nodded. “I suppose it is a bit harder to make a whole row of wizard-owned houses Unplottable.”
Draco grinned and headed up the steps and into Bookworms and Brews, making his way to the café counter.
“Maybe a bit,” Draco admitted. “But, you know, what are friends for?”
“It was
“No. But I’ll go and find out,” Pansy said, standing up. “The wine is chilling in the fridge anyway, so I have to go into the kitchen.”
Draco shook his head. “Don’t be. I might not be able to have the same conversations with him, but at least that means he’s not belittling me for coming second to Granger, or you in Quidditch.”
Hermione laughed again and shook her head as she stepped back into the fire, giving him a wave as she disappeared.
“Sounds good to me. Do you want me to go and get the cake while you get the books?” Draco replied.
“I think they should be in one of these boxes,” Draco said, frowning slightly as he looked at the pile of boxes. “I think it’s lots of green for the lead up to St Patrick’s Day.”
Harry smiled. “Alright then. So, maybe we should start today?”
“So what about you? When did you realise you’re bi?” Draco asked, propping his chin on his hand.
“This is actually perfect,” Harry said with a smile. “I can only imagine how much effort you put into making the badges in the first place.”
“Hey, you never lose the skills,” Harry retorted with a grin of his own.
“Exactly. But everyone else seems to think she would,” Draco sighed. “It just gets tiring, that’s all.”
Harry nodded, quickly sketching some fern-y looking plants.
Charlie grinned and lifted the lid off the Snitch, plunging his hand inside to extract some biscuits before moving to sit at the table opposite Harry.
“Good. I just wanted to be sure that there was nothing I needed to worry about,” Narcissa said. “You two work well together, against all odds, and it would be such a pain if you did anything to ruin that.”
Harry shook his head, making a face. “No. I did have a blind date the other night, but it didn’t go well.”
Harry flushed as he opened the cupboard to get their cloaks out. “I was moving one of the big plant pots, you know the ones that have the ornamental trees in?”
“Oh. Alright,” Harry replied, allowing Draco to lead the way now. It was even quieter in this part of the shop, he noted, and the lighting was softer although he could still hear faint music playing somewhere.
Harry laughed and came up behind Draco who had, by now, turned back to the mirror. He slipped his arms around Draco’s waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. “Trust me, this is absolutely fine. No-one else will be dressed up, I promise you.”
“I’m going, I’m going,” Harry said, swatting at Draco slightly as he set off down the aisle. Reaching the chairs and table, he took his cloak off and hung it on the coat rack that stood beside the wood burner.
“No, I bet it won’t,” Ron muttered under his breath.
“In a restaurant?” Harry said, sitting forward slightly.
“Yes, sir,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes but taking his cloak off at the same time.
Draco snorted as he leant over to press a kiss to the top of Harry’s head. “Hark who’s talking! Alright, I’m going. See you later.”
Ron snorted. “Is he always this dramatic?”
“Of course,” Arthur replied, standing up and reaching for the carving knife and fork.
“I’ll get them,” Draco said, waving a hand. “You can get the next ones. Any particular kind of coffee?”
Buttering two slices of bread, he layered the ham on top and finished it off with some lettuce. Cutting the finished sandwich into two, he sent the butter floating back to the fridge and dropped the knife into the sink. He didn’t bother with a plate, but got himself a glass of water and took the sandwich into the living room to eat.
Harry glanced across at him. “When was the last time?”
“I do, as it happens,” Draco replied. “I’ll tell you more about it once we’re inside.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on, we’d better bring this lot in,” Harry replied, and Draco took this as a sign that the conversation was over for now.
“He’s never brought anyone home before,” Ron replied in a low voice. “This is a big deal.”
Ron took hold of Harry’s arm and Harry whirled them away.
“You too,” Draco replied, returning the smile as they parted ways for the night.
“Oh. Well, thanks… what kind of wreath?” Harry replied, still confused.
“Oh, well, obviously. We’re at a good part,” Harry said. “And I can’t wait to see what happens next.”
“Zabini,” Draco replied, turning to look at his former housemate. “You missed our news.”
“Whatever do you mean?” Draco asked, feigning innocence. “The meal was lovely…”
Draco threw a stack of buckets to Harry with a grin. “You do those three boxes and I’ll do these ones.”
“Something like that,” Harry said, pulling the Danish out of the bag and taking a bite. “I had a date on Sunday night.”
“Well, that’s a surprise,” Draco replied. “Like I said before, he has always liked his food.”
“Yeah… so, how did you two meet?” Harry asked, changing the subject.
“He’s still that petty?” Ron asked, raising an eyebrow. “And you’re okay with this?”
They both settled back into their chairs, books propped open as they began to read. They were quiet as they were absorbed into the world that the author had created, the only sounds being the turning of a page or the occasional sound of one or the other of them sipping their coffee.
Harry crossed the shop floor and stood in front of Draco. “I know. I know that we haven’t been on the best terms over the last couple of months – and I know that’s my fault – but we need to move past it at some point. These last three days have been insanely busy and I just think we really need to unwind, so why not now? It’s just coffee…”
There was a sudden rise in volume as everyone reached for the tureens full of carrots, peas and cauliflower. Harry stood up and reached for the tureen of mashed swede first, dolloping a spoonful onto his plate. Then he offered the tureen to Charlie.
“How’s the pain today?”
Half an hour later, they were shutting the shop door and pulling the security gate across.
“I have my sources,” Pansy replied mysteriously as she gave him a little nudge.
They continued to make small talk as they ate and before long, their plates were empty. Harry leaned back in his chair, a soft groan escaping. “I think that I have eaten far too much today.”
Harry laughed. “I don’t mind at all, because I got you something too,” he said, also turning slightly pink.
Then, as the sun began to set, they boarded a private gondola manned by a traditional gondolier. Sitting side by side, they leant against one another as the gondola moved down the canal.
Harry shuffled backwards, realising that he was still holding the bucket. “I was, but I didn’t expect George to… he asked what I was doing on Saturday and I was up to my neck in orders – which I’m now behind on – and I didn’t think he was going to ask if I wanted to go on a date.”
“Then sit back down so we can start reading,” Draco exclaimed, patting the sofa next to him.
we didn’t do them. They seem like the ‘in’ thing.”
“I could,” Draco conceded with a nod. “I might go this weekend. Don’t tell Mother though, just in case I change my mind.”
“That’s not the point, and you know it,” Draco replied, narrowing his eyes at Harry. “We’re supposed to be getting along.”
“Hurt, more than anything else, I think,” Harry said with a sigh. “And I can’t blame him.”
“I know, but at least we changed our ways before it was too late. We were only kids, Pansy. Kids who were raised with the most awful prejudices before we were old enough to know better,” Draco replied. “We didn’t stand much of a chance.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, laughing again. “I appreciate it. Right, well, have a good night. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I don’t know,” Pansy said, leaning forwards slightly. “He’s been cagey about who he’s seeing for a little while though, so probably longer than any of us realise.”
Finally, when they could eat no more, they lifted up their wine glasses and headed back to the lounge, Draco assuring Harry that he’d take care of the washing up later.
“Hopefully long enough to actually enjoy the food,” Draco replied. “But I can already see people who are just watching us.”
“Neither did we until we got his owl this morning,” Molly replied with a shake of her head. “I must say it was a bit of a surprise, he normally gives us a bit more notice.”
Harry shook his head. “No, definitely not. I prefer plain to the fancy drinks to be honest.”
“Oh… maybe?” Harry said with a frown as he fussed with the flowers and foliage within the bouquet. “I hadn’t noticed, to be honest. I’ve not been over to The Burrow for a few weeks, what with being so busy here.”
! Oh, yes, hello Arlo,” Molly exclaimed after a moment. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” She hurried forward, her hand outstretched.
“Yes, that was the last slice,” Draco replied as he sat back down on the sofa. “I thought you might prefer this to the chocolate cake.”
“Have at it,” Draco said, stepping back. “I’ll go and find a box to put the votes in. And some cards for the votes to be recorded on.”
,” he sang softly.
“Vaguely,” Draco replied, nodding. “Alright, I’ll do that one. You do the one after.”
“It was good to see you,” Harry said, smiling. “I hope you’ll make the next family dinner, though. I need someone else on my side. Charlie wasn’t enough.”
“Oh, he’s good,” Charlie smiled. “Enjoying life in Romania, for sure. The work isn’t too different, of course, although I think we probably have a few more of the tougher dragons to deal with than his old reserve.”
“Did you tell Hermione that?” Draco asked as the driver turned the engine off and got out of the van.
Draco nodded. “Exactly. You never know what’s going to take off. Whatever is in the magazines usually takes off so I suppose we should also check those to see if there’s anything we don’t already have.”
Theo groaned as he settled himself onto the sofa. “This had better be good, Malfoy. We were in the middle of something.”
“Sorry, my mistake,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes with a smile. “I definitely didn’t doubt us.”
Harry laughed. “I don’t think I want to know what dessert is, in that case. Tell him I said thanks for letting me steal you for a bit.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said as he sat down in one of the armchairs. “It seems quieter in this part of the building, and the wood burner keeps it warm.”
“I would never have thought we’d be this comfortable with each other, never mind each other’s friends,” Harry replied. “Would you?”
Harry smiled. “Of course I do. Your opinion will always matter to me.”
Harry glanced at the clock that was on the wall. “Molly said she’ll be doing dinner for half six, so I’ve got enough time to go home and get myself cleaned up.”
Harry laughed and pushed open the kitchen door. He was greeted by a wall of noise before he could even see anyone. He could hear the chatter of adults punctuated by the giggles of children, and he smiled. He could never be in a bad mood in this house, there was always something going on and somebody to talk to. After he and Ginny had split up, he hadn’t been sure how welcome he’d be at The Burrow, but he needn’t have worried as they’d parted on good terms. They’d both known it wasn’t working and had had enough sense to end things before they got too deep. Molly had been very good about it, although there had definitely been some disappointment on her face the day they’d told her.
“That’ll be the hardest part,” Harry replied with a frown. “I don’t know what I can tell them without accidentally telling them it’s you. Because then they’ll assume that you and I are seeing each other and it’ll just get… weird.”
Sighing, he headed back along the street to Paperwhite’s. They had an afternoon of wedding flowers to prepare and he was sure that he would need all of his concentration.
Draco frowned. “Of course I will. I’ve managed so far.”
Draco finished eating and sent his plate soaring off to the sink where it washed itself up and put itself away. Smiling to himself with satisfaction, he went to the fridge and took out the bottle of wine he’d put in there earlier that day, then he turned and headed to the lounge, picking up a wine glass on his way. Settling himself into his favourite armchair, he poured himself a glass of wine and set the bottle down on the table. He lit the fire using his wand and picked up his book, allowing himself to become immersed in the story.
Harry smiled. “I think we are, don’t worry. I mustn’t be as quick a reader as you, that’s all.”
“Why don’t we use this all the time?” Harry asked with a frown as he looked at the sign.
“When we were on the run, some of the Ministry Death Eaters caught up with us and when we tried to Apparate away, one of them had hold of Hermione,” Harry replied, shrugging. “So we landed but had to take off again straight away before he knew where he was. And there was a point we thought it might have passed to Bellatrix, but it hadn’t.”
“Sometimes,” Draco nodded. “If there are lots of people around, it can be quite off-putting. I like a quieter atmosphere for reading.”
Ginny turned and gave George a funny look. “Bit of a different scenario, don’t you think?”
Harry returned the smile and they were both silent for a few minutes as they finished their main course.
“Yes,” Harry replied. “Because I didn’t know what else to do while I waited for you to get back. So I checked on the plants.”
“Well, let’s hope she becomes a regular customer,” Harry said, nudging Draco slightly. “That would be a big help each month, don’t you think?”
Harry nodded. “That was one of the first interactions we had. I know it wasn’t particularly positive, but it was the first time I knew that you would be a constant in my life. I just…didn’t think it would be this way back then.”
Harry shook his head. “No, we thought we’d surprise everyone at the same time.”
“Very well. I’ll be back in a moment,” Pansy replied, disappearing through the door that led to the kitchen.
“Oh, well, thank you,” Draco said, taking a bite of the cake. “Mm, it’s delicious.”
“Quite right. I was actually going to ask you to do some things that I’ve always forbidden.”
James chucked the ingredients into the cauldron and went on with the next ingredient while Draco stirred.
“All right, here we go. Suzanne… Okay. I found that Suzanne was acting oddly during your trials, and especially after the curse. So I did some research and… well. Her parents are very close to the Head f the Department of Mysteries. They go out for dinner almost every week. It turned out that I had given Suzanne all kinds of information about you, which they used to get to you. It’s my fault, papa. That curse was
Also, my
“That guy you had a crush on was strong-willed, perhaps even stubborn. He was probably able to make fifth year into something good, for himself or for others. He –“ Potter broke off suddenly, flicking his eyes to Draco’s. Draco stared back, wondering why Potter would stop talking all of a sudden, until he saw the glimmer in Potter’s eyes and a smirk pulling up.
“Yet, a suspect always has to be fully informed of the charges and accuser.”
“Is that good?” Bill wondered.
“So eh Draco, you’re Potions professor now?” Ron asked, a little uncomfortably. Draco nodded and forced himself to smile.
“No.”
The question seemed to take Draco by surprise.
“Papa,” Albus interrupted absently. “They call him ‘papa’. French.”
“None of that now. We want to hear all about your new job. The apartment is very charming. And I believe the dungeons are redone?”
“I know.”
“Obviously. I don’t want my children to be prejudiced against you, or address you the way I would,” Draco scoffed.
Draco chuckled. “I’ll tell you when I know.”
Draco laughed. “I’m sure. Most Gryffindors don’t particularly like me, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they come up with the craziest things, just to throw me off.”
But Cassie had disappeared again, and Draco heard Euripideia finishing her conversation outside. He undid every one of his spells with a flick of his wand, and bent over to get his bag.
“Mr. Malfoy? Will you come with me?”
Cassie clenched her fists tighter in the front of his robes, but Draco caught on her hands in his and intertwined their fingers.
Whoohoo more angstiness. A chapter filled with meddling children, some more meddling children, a third scene containing meddling children, a splash of Amortentia, and a mysterious hoodie.
Draco chuckled. “Were you thinking of asking someone on a date, then?”
“Do… Did you realise what you just said?”
“I’m not sure I will. I think I might die if I don’t get my chocolate. I could pass out. Do you want to have that on your conscience?”
“Potter… you do know you’re allowed to come here, even if you don’t have a nightmare, right? Even if you just want to talk. Or have a fun night.”
Scorpius looked at his hands and nodded. “He better be. He’s my best friend. If he’s not worried, we should have a stern talk of what friendship means to him.”
Frowning, Pansy looked around the room for any confirmation of Draco’s feelings towards Potter. She understood what he meant, and even though she knew the children had given Potter hints on how to deal with Draco, it wasn’t a surprise that Potter didn’t know how to read the tiny little signs of affection.
Now, he was gliding his finger over all the books on the book cases, and admired some ancient Potions encyclopaedia. Someone had made notes and had doodled here and there. Draco frowned disapprovingly.
But, here we are now.
Potter nodded to indicate he was listening, even though it didn’t seem that Draco was paying him any attention. He was staring in Potter’s eyes, intently, with a fire burning behind the veil he was trying to configure.
A soft thud has him looking around him. He is not the only Hogwarts student intently watching the tension build between the Dark Lord and Potter. They seem to be talking, but no words reach his muddled brain. He knows there can’t have passed more than a couple of minutes between when he though Potter was dead and now.
Teddy looked up. “It’s your birthday next week? We’ll have to have a party!” he said to Phi, who had moved and sat on Teddy’s lap.
He had never had to decorate his house, because they had always celebrated Christmas and New Year’s either at the Manor, or in France.
And now he was standing beside his bed, with his illegally acquired wand in his hand. It was a children’s wand, given, but illegal it was. With a soft “Accio”, he summoned the box in his hand. It was dusty and filthy. A gentle cleaning spell was cast over it. His finger traced the edges of the wood. He didn’t know what kind of wood his wand was, but it was just as dark as the Ebony box. He loved the colour.
When Narcissa looked up from the paper, she saw that Draco was smiling slightly, which wasn’t surprising. What
“Good. Because I do too.”
“How sentient is the Whomping Willow actually?” he asked.
Andromeda laughed, leading Narcissa towards the table to sit down. When Draco saw how easy it was between them, how eager they were to update each other on their lives, he allowed himself to pay attention to other things.
Thank you so much for all the comments, I really really really really really like you. I try to respond as much as possible, but in case I haven't resplied to your comment: THANK YOU YOU ARE AMAZING AND I LOVE YOU.
Albus took the note from him and tried to stuff it in his back pocket, but Draco nicked it from his fingers and read it over himself. “It seems like
Potter blinked a few times and rearranged his legs so they were tucked under him. “And you?” he asked. “What are your nightmares like? Do you still dream of the Fiendfyre? I’m not trying to make you feel guilty, but do the deaths of –of Lupin, Dumbledore, Fred, Lavender or Snape mean anything to you?”
“However, if I hear you or any of your siblings–“ Draco pointed at Albus, “whispering as if something inappropriate happened, I will personally ensure that you will receive a very heavy punishment.”
Miguel hummed. “He’s a pureblood, isn’t he,” he stated, more than asked. Alexa exhaled heavily.
“Apart from focus, there also needs to be a proper emotion. Anger will make the potion take effect too early and too abruptly. Sadness dilutes it, as if you’ve added too much water. Desperation isn’t good either. Desperation makes a potion unreliable, as it will affect the body desperately, affecting parts of the body that do not need to be affected, or becoming far too strong in its effects. Potioneers must therefore always be in full control of their emotions, able of presenting the emotion the potion needs, even if they don’t feel that way.”
And Draco… Draco was sure of himself, and that made him realise he was even more of a disappointment. He was not only unable to obey the Dark Lord, but he would also be unable to produce a Malfoy heir. He could not and would not ever touch a woman voluntarily. He knew it. It just didn’t feel right for him.
“Of course, rules are fine. We could have a sort of safe word? Everyone only takes three drops, which will prevent any babbling. That way, if someone asks something you don’t want to answer, you can call out the safe word and another question will be asked, something incredibly basic, like your favourite drink. Everyone agreed?”
Most of the people present mumbled their consent, but a few –Draco, Greg, Potter, Hermione and Seamus- remained hesitant.
“Lily is better than I would have expected from a Gryffindor, not to mention, from a child of yours.”
“I know. That’s not what I’m asking. I want everyone to pay close attention to the people Aquila hangs out with. I want everyone to protect her, without her noticing that we are watching her like a hawk. Is that too much to ask?”
Draco nodded to himself when he let Potter in, and moved to the kitchenette to make Potter’s standard Firewhiskey on the rocks, while Potter himself walked into the living room. Draco saw Pansy stand up with lightning speed. She locked eyes with Potter and tension rapidly build. Draco was about to send Potter on his way, when the two offered their hands at the same time. Blaise, tipsy as he was, giggled, which made Pansy and Potter relax as they shook hands.
The Daily Prophet
Pansy nodded, thanking her, and led Greg to Draco’s apartment in the dungeons. When they opened the door, the concerned expressions of the children turned hopeless.
“I’m not saying you are, but truly, we are not together in any way.”
“Rissa May, born September 4
Harry laughed, taking the box and opening it. Draco took the ring, a simple rough gold band with tiny green gems in it, and slipped it on.
“Remember that Pansy told you I got letters and pictures during the war with information from my father?”
“The Sword of Gryffindor is not a regular sword,” she tells the crowd. Draco flinches, moves to get away again, when the next words are spoken. “Today something extraordinary has happened, and the Sorting Hat would like to explain how it could happen. I will tell you what the Hat is telling me.”
“Are you just cuddly, or is something wrong?”
Harry shrugged. “And here I was thinking the Malfoys were as impeccably trained as lap dogs. Must have been wrong.”
“You’re cute, Potter. I do feel better now. Next time, write it on a paper. It might make it less illegible.”
“Cassie, you know that that isn’t true. You look wonderful in that dress.”
“Merlin,” Potter whispered. “And you have to regulate all that?”
Draco sighed exasperatedly, too tired to be angry (and not wanting to be angry). He was about to shoo the three oldest out of his apartment and Phi into the bedroom to change, when Scorpius spoke up.
“I understand, but it’s not the water, nor the sunset, nor the wind or the view.”
Draco and Potter shared a look. “Tea?” Draco offered softly, smiling when Potter nodded eagerly.
“Oh! You promised we would have a Muggle Christmas!” Aquila exclaimed.
“Ingredients for the Apothecary. There are only a few ingredients that we don’t grow ourselves.”
“Have you got nefarious plans, then?”
“I was right, pay up,” Greg grinned.
“Has he told you, then?”
“Maybe he just didn’t have the right ingredients?” Pansy tried, desperately.
“Worst decision of your life, huh?” Hermione asked, a knowing look in her eyes.
. I thought the Malfoy name had been diminished?”
Draco searched his father’s face for any sign of knowledge or realisation. Upon not finding it, he straightened his back a bit. “My children have become friends with the Weasleys and Potters. I don’t want them to be disappointed.”
“Hiya, sir. We came by to take your statements. Is it okay to start with you, sir?”
“That, it is. We don’t play often. My father dislikes it as well, because he is the only one who can’t enjoy it. So to keep the peace, we only play when he is out or hiding in the library.”
Scorpius looked around with an expectant look on his face. “Say whatever you think is important. Aquila is our secretary. Shoot,” he ordered while sitting down. It stayed silent for a while, until slowly the ideas came trickling in. A grin spread over Scorpius’s face as he listened to all the ideas and caught Albus’s gaze. This was going very well.
They met the other professors –the younger ones, not the ancient ones Draco had had as a student- at the Three Broomsticks. Neville raised an eyebrow when he saw them walk in together. A few weeks ago, this wouldn’t have been imaginable.
Swallowing a couple of times, Potter blinked away the tears brimming in the corners of his eyes before walking over to Draco and hugging him close. Smiths wore a wisp of a smile in his otherwise impassive expression, still blankly staring at the wall in front of him.
“Well, Neville dear, at a certain moment, one might see a man and find him attractive.”
*coughs*
you are. Your daughter is just like you. She doesn’t want anyone to know she’s hurting. Did you tell her to never give anyone the satisfaction of seeing her crumble? What a very Slytherin attitude for a Ravenclaw.”
Albus frowned as well. “It sounds like he is very determined about not letting this influence their strange connection.” His face cleared up quickly. “Perhaps he has some ulterior motives,” he smirked.
“It’s open for all the people I care about. Friends, family above seventeen. I want you to feel welcome here. I thought it a good way to make that clear.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We gave ourselves the liberty to break in,” Pansy shrugged at Harry’s surprised look. “How are they? Where are Draco and Aquila?”
Now he not only had to fix dresses for his daughters, but also find something presentable for himself to wear.
Chuckling, Potter caught Draco’s eyes. “He shared. I doubt he would eat caramel sea salt, though. He seemed very fixed on his hazelnut flavoured ones. And I liked them. How did you get them in the shape of those potions bottles?”
Draco let himself relax somewhat. “Very much. It’s far better to teach Potions and brew experimentally in my free time, than to be forced to do it as a student.”
Draco rolled his eyes at her mothering and stood up to join the others at the table. Breakfast was a short affair, since they were a bit late and James and Phi still had to change out of their pyjamas.
“I told you about your lying disabilities. But even without you blinking your eyes twice quickly when you lie, I would know that your toothbrush is red. You’re sentimental and nostalgic for the Gryffindor common room, to the extent that your ex-wife’s hair is red. It isn’t bad, it’s just… Interesting.”
Draco very pointedly avoided his son’s gaze.
“I have guests over, and I’m not sure you would want to talk to them,” he said apologetically. Potter’s face fell.
“Ladies, gentlemen, settle down!” A voice booms through the chatter. All Death Eaters have gone, if they were still alive. The body of Voldemort –‘The Dark Lord!’– lies alone, in the middle of the Hall. Professor McGonagall successfully makes everyone turn towards her, to make them stop staring at his bones. “I believe it would be better to assemble outside, so I can make some announcements.” She herds the students towards the place outside, which was so lovely when covered in snow. The Sorting Hat wriggles in his hand. “Bring me to McGonagall” it hisses. Draco, who has never wanted anything to be gone from his vicinity so badly, quickly sends it to the Professor with a wand he finds lying next to him. The Sword disappears as well.
“Why’d you call her Isabella?”
“What’s our leverage then?”
to be hurt.”
Standing up, he left the paper on the table for someone else to read or clean, and went up to his room. He closed the door. He didn’t exactly know what to do with his spare time. He didn’t feel like reading, and wasn’t keen on writing his letters. An idea sprang to mind. He knelt at the side of his bed and pulled the wooden box from under it. He hadn’t picked it up in a few months.
“Neither would I. I would have bet my life on Potter being the jealous type, but here you are, being properly wooed by George the Weasley!” Blaise exclaimed.
“Only if you do it publicly.”
Draco grinned. “Yes, even from you, Your Highness.”
“So you came down here?” Draco asked.
“If he would greet me or Phi or Cassie like that, he would only say that he’s doing fine. Which we already know, because he’s wearing orange. Orange is a ‘determined and stubborn’ colour.”
Draco didn’t respond, even seemed to relax his jaw again. Not third year, then.
Draco turned to face him fully. Potter was glad to see fury in his eyes, because apparently, he was still able to rile Draco up.
Rewind.
“And you?”
His children. Yes, his treasures and the best things that ever happened to him. He couldn’t even regret marrying Astoria, because this marriage had given him the kind of happiness he would never have hoped to have. And now that Astoria was gone from his life, it was perfect.
James sighed again. “Said she had homework to do. Which is… fine, I guess, if there had been another date. But there hasn’t been.”
“Does it?”
At the last repeat of “I will survive,” Draco suddenly let go of Potter and slipped down in a split, only breaking his pose when the applause died down and Potter pulled him back up.
Draco growled. “That day, I realised I had been polite enough to you. I was done with being nice to you. I do not feel the urge to stroke your ego any further. Good day.”
“But the Healers are all so positive. They are certain that Scorp will make it through. Healer Thornbecke said that there was no reason to think he wouldn’t wake up.”
Scorpius snorted, close enough to whisper as well. “That’s the tenth time he almost spilled the secret. He’s an idiot.”
Potter’s mouth fell open when he understood what Pansy had said. He attempted to catch Draco’s eyes, but Draco strategically looked away.
Potter kissed him again, short, soft and annoyingly sweet. “Well, we could try again.”
“Where now?” Minerva asked. “Where is the magic coming from?”
“Tada!” Potter called out proudly, bowing. At Draco’s unimpressed stare, he frowned and squinted his eyes. “Are you not entertained?
Draco rubbed his eyes. “Cassie is a disaster with every one of my children. She can’t sit still for a second and she’s so incredibly loud. But with Phi, she gets a little worse. Phi loves to go along with her plans, which only makes her plans grow wilder and wilder. You won’t believe the things she’s tried.”
“No, but it makes it worth it. Here, look at this.”
Potter used the distraction to slouch a bit, one leg dangling from the couch and the other pulled up. Draco’s arm was not lying relaxed against his thigh anymore because of this move switch, so Draco replaced it across Potter’s stomach without thinking much of it.
“I suspect your lycanthropy student isn’t the only one,” Lucius frowned. “What did you say the last names of Terence and Priscus were?”
Draco groaned. “I had a feeling. Maybe tonight we can talk about it?”
“Malfoy was attacked this afternoon.”
“Then who were they abusing?”
“Evidently, whoever is writing these notes doesn’t want anyone to know that it’s them. Can we agree that no one will actively try to find out? You know, to give that Slytherin a safe feeling and he or she will continue updating us?”
“And so do I. I will track her down, papa. No matter how long it takes, no matter what I have to do. I will track her down and make her pay. She is killing you, and she deserves Azkaban, at least.”
“Hmm?” Draco hummed, not able to tear his eyes away from the wonderful materials in front of him.
Draco promised that he would, after which the common room was empty, apart from him, and he went up to his own apartment as well. His three children –the absence of Scorpius stung sharper than Draco had expected- were lying on top of each other on Draco’s bed, clothes and shoes still on. Draco just shrugged and joined them.
“Because I had it tested.”
“Slytherins may not have liked the man much,” Draco explained at Potter’s happily confused expression. “But we know when to appreciate what we’ve learned. It’s a gift.”
Draco sat down at the large dining table and placed the bag and the papers he had taken out of his trunk in front of him. Grabbing a quill, he began contemplating again on what Christmas presents he should give. Mostly how he would get three more pictures for the pretty frames he had bought.
“So,” Draco sighed, sitting down opposite. “Spit it out.”
Draco grimaced. “I kept it a secret for about four years. Severus was the only one who knew, and he found out only after three years.”
. Draco nodded slightly. “I can tell, because this book is nowhere to be found. Only in old family libraries,” Bill explained to his family.
George choked on his breath. “What kind of sick dreams does she have?” he exclaimed.
“Well, we have employees, of course, to control the everyday happenings. And it helps that those estates have been ours for centuries. We barely have to pay any taxes. And since the properties in the Midlands are agricultural lands, worked by farmers who lease it from us, then sell a third of the goods to us, we make quite a lot of money on it, while not having to do anything but some paperwork.”
“That is unfair! I have not done anything to have points detracted. This is foul play, Professor. I will complain about this,” Lazarus exclaimed.
“No sorry, I was rather busy with wrapping my mind around the fact that I pulled the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Hat, for Merlin’s sake.”
, I know I have no chance with him, because
“Not much better. Jamie, believe me when I say that this movement, this
The final refrain was sung by all of them, a bulk of voices sounding up in the Great Hall. Lucy and Dominique were having fun together, and greeted the students they were standing next to. The procession had almost reached the High Table now, as they had walked during the song, and when Lucy went to the Ravenclaw table, and Dominique to the Gryffindors, it finally became obvious who had been singing the main vocals.
Albus smiled. It was a promise they had made at their first day at Hogwarts. Scorpius wouldn’t worship Albus, and Albus wouldn’t resent Scorpius. At least not because of what their respective fathers had done.
“Very well, Mr. Malfoy. Could you tell me what happened?”
“Jackie, our dear Jackie. She hated you so much at first, but then she noticed how
Harky opened the door for them, and set about making tea while James asked Mr. Malfoy to bring him to the laboratory.
“Good. Can we move on to another subject? Or, well, slightly related subject?”
“Understandable,” Potter managed to say after a few seconds of silence. “How does he cope?”
“There were also many things I had to believe in. I had to believe in pureblood superiority, in the Malfoy superiority and in everything Tom Riddle had ever said. I had to hate Muggles, bully people that were beneath me, and use others to make myself look better. That’s the way Malfoys are, they said. It’s how you live, they said. You don’t have a choice. That’s what I was told from my infancy to now.
“What’s the use of denying it? I won’t be accepted for any job, no matter if I am honest about this or not. Yes, Potter, I might have a tiny bit of a crush on you. And that’s enough grovelling for today. I will be going inside to pack my trunk and chat with Pansy for a bit. Have a nice life. Good day, Potter.”
to be. I’m trying to act differently, especially now that I have children. I don’t want them to make the same mistakes I made. But that’s exactly it.
Two can play at this game, Draco thought. He raised an imperial eyebrow at his daughter to match her glare. “If your own behaviour would be tolerable, I would not need to insult you.”
he heard Amycus say.
“You know how.”
“All right. I think I will see you tomorrow then. And contact me when there is a change. Middle of the day, middle of the night, it doesn’t matter. I will come here straight away.”
“Deal.”
Draco smiled, but it lacked the usual brightness. He knew what was coming and was not looking forward to it.
Potter grinned cheekily. “I’ll take the tea.”
“French? Parles-tu Français ?” Dominique enquired.
“Only my arse or can the rest of me come in as well?”
Placing a soft hand on George’s hunched shoulder, Draco stepped closer. “No, it’s not. It’s not your fault. I understand what you’re trying to say, but it’s not your fault. Never.”
“And happy.”
“Morning. How did you sleep?”
“If Ron can forgive you, if George forgives you, the rest don’t really have the right not to. Besides, the Weasleys are a very loving family. They will accept you if they notice you are trying to make it right.”
“Since I have seen where it leads if you don’t communicate properly in a relationship. Do you think your mother wanted to join the Dark Lord?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope. Didn’t tell.”
“And you also said, at one of those evenings with Potter, that you might die sooner than expected,” Pansy frowned. “You tell us the truth right now, Draco, or I’ll call your mother.”
Blaise scoffed. “Her children, yeah right. She just doesn’t want
“You are the biggest idiot I have ever met,” Blaise agreed.
It was silent for a few seconds.
Yes, unnerving. That is what Potter has always been. He wasn’t arrogant or attention-seeking or rude. He was unnerving.
A few weeks passed, in which most things went back to normal. Aquila came back home, Scorpius was no longer sour and nervous, Draco and Harry got around to planning a wedding. All of that wasn’t important though on the day of the trial.
“Well, I could use it right now. A reminder of what we have.”
“Wait, what is going on?” Scorpius muttered.
Albus just groaned and dropped his head in his hands. “I can’t believe I didn’t realise earlier.
“Draco, how do you take your tea? I’ve got a thousand different flavours, and sugar and milk. Take your pick,” George announced, puttering about to make sure his desk was empty of papers.
“Oh. I know they have been bullying Slytherins for three years, but I just feel like it reached an extreme this year. Scorp said that the way it
Pansy fiddled with the hem of her blouse, but never once looked away from Draco’s sneer. “Then you’ll go somewhere else, because I am going to tell the story.”
“Right. Family bonds,” Potter murmured. “You speak fluent French?” he asked then. Phi nodded, and started showing off his French.
Potter turned around with a sigh. “Can you please stop talking? I’m trying to concentrate.”
Well...
“Pourquoi ?”
“Oh, sorry.” Lucius quickly cast a charm, and saw Draco’s eyes light up.
First of all, Potter had never had a relationship with a man, although he couldn’t imagine it was very different from a relationship with a woman. But the
The girl just let out a few more snorts, and crossed her legs.
As the Potter and Malfoy children started chatting, telling him all kinds of excited stories, Cassie slowly relaxed and dared to look up again. Her smile brightened with every passing minute and her face gained some colour again.
Draco hummed. “You?”
Harry chuckled. “Then you have nothing to worry about.”
“My best friend is called Ron Weasley, have you heard of him?” Potter asked. His voice was light and joking. Draco arched an eyebrow at him. He knew Potter was trying to goad him into insulting Weasley again, just like their first real meeting.
Draco nodded, spine straight and shoulders square, trying to mask the feeling of utter loss he felt. He knew he should have stayed with Astoria. Life had never treated him well. It had been foolish to think that this time, it would be different.
Rose’s eyes got a mischievous glimmer. “Of course I can convince them. We really are going to get them together?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Quiet down. Lazarus, I would like you to remain silent. Five points from Ravenclaw for disrupting class. If you are set on insulting me, please don’t hesitate to do so. After class. This lesson, we will talk about –“
Aquila smiled. “Papa and Harry.”
“Chocolate isn’t the answer for everything.” Draco felt Potter smile against his neck, warm, and soft, and far too intimate for the Great Hall with students around them. “Although, I guess I could be persuaded.”
“They’re not just dreams,” Cassie wailed. “You always said they were just dreams, but they aren’t. I’ve seen
Draco extended his hand, letting Potter take it, and pulling him nearer to the bed. “I want to apologise. For not telling you everything. It was stupid of me.”
Draco laughed. “Blue. I’m not sure whether I like dark or light better, but I think I’m leaning towards byzantine.”
“What? What is going on then?”
Potter tutted smilingly. When he looked at Draco’s plate, he saw that Draco still hadn’t eaten more than that single bite, and his smile faded. “Malfoy… Malfoy, eat something. You’ll feel better when you do.”
The moment the Motherwort was added, the potion began bubbling and smoking.
“I’d rather not.”
“Exactly. They would fear your magic –“
“What was I saying? Oh right. Cass, you can’t –“
“Why are you still in a relationship then, if you know that neither of you is really into it?”
Dominique was frowning at her parchment and seemed like she had no idea what else she should do. Then, she turned around and softly asked the girl behind her a question. It was a red-headed girl, definitely a Weasley. Draco was sure it was Molly Weasley, the daughter of Percy. They whispered a bit, until Dominique’s face cleared in understanding and she smiled gratefully. Molly nodded in acknowledgement. She was very clearly Percy’s daughter, with the same pinched expression and slightly turned up nose. It wasn’t on purpose, probably, because her entire personality wasn’t arrogant or proud. She always worked very hard in class, and her assignments belonged to the top of the class. She was all right, for a Weasley.
“Potter, just keep silent, will you?”
“Do you think I’m leading him on?”
“Have you finished your research?” Draco asked when James was seated opposite him.
“Malfoy, guess what.”
The gashes he had gotten when James had been cursed were open again. Scorpius was dabbing Albus’s face with Dittany – copious amounts, by the smell of it – but every time Albie winced, a trail of blood left the gashes, making his face some kind of horrific mask.
Potter sat down again on his chair, with Whithal grinning widely and Septimius still standing on his earlier spot.
“Furthermore, we see Cassiopeia sitting in the Great Hall after curfew, crying with her face in the crook of her arms. Before Ms. McGonagall can move towards her to ask what is going on, Mr. Malfoy is seen crouching next to Cassiopeia. The moment Cassiopeia notices Mr. Malfoy, she throws herself at him and doesn’t let him go until her sobbing has stopped. Mr. Malfoy doesn’t blink, just wraps himself around her in an effort to protect her against the world.
“Me neither. I’m sorry for leaving so abruptly.”
“Why not?”
“According to pureblood tradition, the man is supposed to woo the woman. In our case, there are two men. Are you truly trying to apply pureblood traditions to our situation?”
Draco bit back a bark of laughter. Look at that, Potter admitting that this kind of clothing could actually feel comfortable. Draco would raise him well after all.
Draco stayed very quiet, trying to hide his own slice of cake from Potter’s view, but the movement only caught the latter’s eyes.
Another silence. Lucius shared a look with Narcissa, taking in the shocked faces of both Pansy and Blaise, and Potter.
Oh I almost forgot! Next three weeks, there won't be an update, because I will be on holiday. Sorry! Just remember that we are - in the story timeline - still on June 10th. Next chapter will be June 17th. Remember that!
Greg smiled. “It’s okay. My mentor says I’m doing well. He wants me gone by next December.”
He hadn’t been ready for what he saw now, though. Apparently, his Boggart were his children.
“No, I have not.”
“Anyway, Albus, I’m glad for you, and I hope that you and Manila will be very happy together. Please, in the future, tell me everything. And papa… I don’t even have words for you,” Scorpius stated.
“Expelled? Malfoy, don’t you see? You were never expelled, and you got in a weekly fight with another student. Now, I know those were different times, but the principle is the same. If you weren’t expelled for everything you did, you can’t expect me to expel Terence and Priscus.”
, it said.
Outside, Hermione found Draco leaning against one of the trees and staring over the vast nothing of the landscape surrounding the Burrow.
“Yesterday, actually. Long story short, we –“
“How about a kiss? Like, a peck good morning. Simple, but clear.”
Phi rolled his eyes. “I’m serious. All of us are much more mature than others of our age. Without you, Scorpius is constantly angry, focusses it inwards and is self-destructing. Just like you actually.”
curse, made to attack your most valuable asset. Of course I recognise the symptoms of the spell
When Draco nodded, James frowned. “But that doesn’t count, then. Because he set it up.”
is why someone would give her a Weasley jumper.”
“Look at your papa, he suddenly turned so soft,” Albus grinned. “How did that happen?”
“You shouldn’t worry about all that, though. I’m sure Headmistress McGonagall has it all figured out.”
Scorpius laughed. “Though if James’s recollection of that moment is correct, I think papa definitely knows the hoodie was Harry’s, no matter when he realised it was. He already accepted that he likes Harry, so he will have no reason to deny it anymore.”
“Is it – she easy to calm? How much time would it give us?”
Potter hesitated, but at Draco forlorn gaze, he sighed. “Snape was in love with my mother,” he whispered.
Rose Granger-Weasley shuffled to her cousin’s side.
“I don’t care. Read this.”
Scorpius and Albus shared a smug look. “To get papa to drink his tea.”
“Well, Aquila is the only one of that family that didn’t get into Slytherin, and she was visibly miserable during her first year at Hogwarts. Especially the first couple of months. Also, she has an arrangement with her father to meet him every single day, which I find a bit odd. She never wanted to tell us why she had to meet him. It just doesn’t sit right with me, that she
They stayed silent for a bit, Lucius waiting for Draco to elaborate, and Draco trying to find the right words.
So I asked which continent you thought I was from. I am from Europe, correct, so most of you were right. Now I've got two questions: why did you think Europe, and which exact country do you think I'm from?
Draco was able to quietly wake his children, to get them inside and in bed. He even carried all five trunks so they didn’t have to. Half-sleeping and too tired to disobey, Aquila, Cassiopeia and Ophiuchus waddled into their respective bedrooms to fall asleep again before Draco had even brought their trunks upstairs.
“You lost your brother. Not just your brother, though, your other half. You were attached to the hip. You did everything together, and now, you have to do it alone. That’s tough. Your siblings, your parents can’t imagine the pain you went through.”
“How are your nightmares, by the way, Harry? Are they still as bad?” Pansy then asked, suddenly serious. Potter blinked at her change in tone, but shrugged when Draco sent him a concerned glance.
The chairman gestured to continue, so Doctor Selaminder faced Draco, smiled encouragingly before asking his questions.
Cassie swung around with an imperial fling of her hair and marched back to her siblings on the Slytherin table.
Draco trudged a bit behind them, enjoying the wild diversity of items. At a certain point, Potter slowed down to join him, while both kept an eye on their children.
Potter protested, until Draco sent a glare his way.
Draco looked him in the eye. He nodded slowly. A wide grin stole over his face. “Magnificent. You’re still not allowed to call me Draco, though,” he joked. Neville snorted.
Draco sighed and cringed at the words that came out of his mouth. “As you know very well, I bullied at Hogwarts. I used to think those people were unworthy of me. And I feel so guilty about that time, that I won’t ever be able to fall in love with them. It’s a barrier that keeps me from falling.”
“We can wait until Draco’s back and the school year is done. I think it’s for the best if we do this during the summer,” Lucius decided.
“And yet, the two of them have been able to pay their fines, keep their estates and get decent jobs, without resume. Coincidental, don’t you think?”
“Papa, do you ever think we are overthinking this?” Scorpius suddenly asked, his nose in a dusty old book with a list of all pureblood families in the UK between 1176 and 1990.
The four of them deliberated, seemingly communicating without words, until they chorused, “Another song first.”
Rolling his eyes, Potter picked up the dishes to bring it to the kitchen, but Draco stood up just as quickly and put the dishes back down. “We have to go to the beach now, otherwise we’ll miss the sunset. Harky will do the rest. It’s okay, he doesn’t mind. Will you please go to the beach with me now?”
?!” he whisper-yelled. “He wears
While Blaise laughed, many disgusted sounds were heard around the table.
Draco tried to bite back his smile, but couldn’t stop his light flush. “Preferably just your arse, but I guess it’s a package deal with the rest of you.”
“Potter, if you were serious about the pureblood courtship –“
Draco caught Potter’s eye and let his mask slip away again. Questions, answers and agreements seemed to pass between them.
“Not very polite, James, to talk with your mouth full. Do you know what he was looking for?” Draco asked.
Scorpius pretended to think about it, but eventually shook his head. “No, not really. Come on, fill me in on everything happening at Hogwarts.”
“Foolish,
“Are you saying you think someone is out to fight you?”
That time, he had been caught up in one of the articles. When knowing the full background story, it was utterly terrifying. Even though he knew he should never say this out loud, he was glad You-Know-Who was dead. He seemed mental.
They remained that way for a while, until they both spoke in unison.
Potter grinned. He was impatient as they walked to Draco’s apartment within the castle, pushing and pulling until Draco finally managed to open the door. Potter immediately went to the kitchen to prepare some tea and get the chocolate, while Draco went to say goodnight to Phi.
“There were more important things he had to worry about. The Cabinet was one of his lesser worries.”
“Help? With what?” Draco asked innocently. From the stairs to the girl’s dorms, a loud scoff sounded.
“Oh? What was your idea?”
“Don’t bother. I’ll stop. It is fine, I understand. Would you like some more wine?”
“Listen. I know you do, infallibly. Because of the counterpotion. The curse hit me in the heart, right? That can’t just be cured by a simple counterpotion. My heart was weakened, and it had to get strong again. The counterpotion had to be brewed by someone with the same values, the same feelings, the same way of thinking as I have. Someone with a strong heart, who not only knows what to do, but also has the intrinsic motivation to help me. To save me. Someone who
“I know, I do,” he said softly, hanging his head low.
“I might need his help with something. But thank you –“
“Oh, trust me, I’m sure they have snogged,” Albus snorted. “Have you seen the way they look at each other?”
Can’t be broken.
He hadn’t heard the footsteps. He was lucky he had shoved the box under his bed after taking the article out. When his father opened the door, he only had to place his unfinished letter to some friends over the article.
“Mrs. Malfoy?” he asked, after throwing a quick glance at Draco.
“Who brought you this? Because if it would have been your children, or your friends, I would have known. Right? And I can’t imagine your
“Adoption records, maybe even death. Could they have pretended that the child had died but got rid of it illegally instead?”
“Why doesn’t this surprise me, at all?” Draco snarled. “Saint Potter, being all good and brave, forgiving Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, oh goody, what a perfect human being. But all the while, he can’t get over one tiny little mistake of one of his classmates. How generous you are, to speak up for the poster boy of a new generation of Death Eaters, yet refusing to speak positively about other Death Eater children. How proud you must be.”
Aquila gasped. “Papa! Why? That’s not kind.”
“I won’t hurt him, knowingly. If only because you would kill me if I would.”
Suddenly, Draco burst out laughing. “You aren’t actually jealous, are you?”
“Seems like it,” Phi piped up as he eyed the shiny black fabric with pride.
Draco felt tension leave his body and nodded. “Right.”
“Oh! I almost forgot to ask. How are Aquila and Matias doing?”
“No, I didn’t. You can imagine how worried I was. Until I found out she had just been hiding in some corner in the attic, where no one’s been for ages. And she always reappeared the moment I called her.”
He said it like it was nothing, but Draco was rendered speechless. Albus’s smile turned smug, but he winced when the skin around the cut on his face was pulled tight.
“Okay. What kind of note are we even looking for?”
“Good. Since when are you such a hot-headed Gryffindor?” Blaise joked to ease the tension.
“You are already better than Higgins was, last year,” Albus added.
Let it go, let it go
Ugh I need to get more discipline.
“No, it – it really was,” he grinned. “You – you just vented all your teenage frustrations, didn’t you?”
Cassie grinned evilly at Draco, who immediately groaned. “No, Cassie, this is
“Just feel like it. Thanks for the tea, by the way.”
Draco responded with a jerk, before sitting down carefully and grabbing his wine.
Potter grinned. “He has plates for us?”
“No, you will not. Why would you want to?”
“I’ve got to show you something,” Draco whispered, pulling back. “It’s a little awkward, so… Actually, it’s
“Potter, stop,” Draco whispered. “Hold on. It’s not an object.”
When he made eye contact with Scorpius, his son beamed. Draco couldn’t help his huff of laughter and shook his head fondly. Suddenly, he heard a deafening silence from his left side. He chanced a look at Potter and saw him already watching him. Phi was slowly pushing his food around with his fork.
The weekly stories about Potter hadn’t subsided yet. Lately, there were rumours about where he lived. Apparently, he lived with some Muggle-family. They had no names of the family, and no address. Draco almost snorted, before he realised that it was unbecoming. But honestly, how could they say Potter lived with Muggles, if they had no definite proof? How had they found out?
Minerva nodded, and Auror Whithal continued. “Mr. Malfoy, you are allowed one letter the moment you arrive in the holdings, which you will dictate to our scribe. This letter may not be longer than five inches. Headmistress McGonagall, good day. We will stay in touch.”
“But they were always hidden so well!” another voice exclaimed, this one distinctly Albus.
Pansy nodded. “Will it kill you? The curse?”
is the pattern in this case?” Potter snarled.
After deciding on the exact time and date, they left with another handshake, and Draco with photographs of the office. He had done it to cover up for the high level magical signature in the room, but it could actually come in handy. He would have to consult with his team.
“Scorpius. Scorp. Scorp, it’s me. Scorpius, it’s me, you see me? Scorpius? Scorp. Scorp, Scorpius. Hey. Hey, Scorpius. Scorpius, hey.” Draco kneeled at his son’s side, stroking away the blond locks now clotted with blood. Vaguely, he heard the man behind him say something angrily, he heard the sound of a wand being pulled, but he ignored it. He picked up Scorpius, on arm under his knees and the other under his neck.
“Who knows about it? I mean, you and Neville, obviously. And Theresa. So what would you do with her?”
Mr. Malfoy laughed. “Come on.” He pushed James in front of him and walked to the gates to offices and staff areas, moving as if he knew what he was doing and as if he did this all the time. Unsheathing his wand without anyone noticing, he mumbled a charm that James didn’t recognise, and the gates waved open.
“Potter, you do not have to doubt that. I wouldn’t have agreed to any courtship if I didn’t feel some sort of affection for you already.”
“Sir, I can’t. The patient is resting.”
“No.”
to stay with him until he wakes up and bother everyone in St. Mungo’s for their reassurance. But I also want the others to be all right and stay calm. If they start panicking or crying, I would break down myself. So it’s a bit of a dilemma.”
“Well, I never would have thought,” Greg smirked.
One of the parents snorted.
After dinner, it was –finally- time for presents. They gathered round the tree, James on the floor to choose which gifts to go next. He started with a present for Ophiuchus, one that Draco didn’t recognise. Potter, next to him, was doing a terrible job of hiding his pleased smile when Phi burst out laughing after tearing the wrapping paper apart. It was a calendar called ‘Handbook for the Metamorphmagus Wizards and Witches,’ in which every day held an anecdote of metamorphmaguses.
“But it’s for a good cause, you know. Gryffindor righteousness.”
James rolled his eyes grumpily. “Obviously. But how do I know?”
“You sure? I have a very interesting story about your crush, you know.”
“I believe so. It’s never pretty, when Mother and papa talk. Mother does not like papa.”
“You know you can call me Draco,” Draco smiled, trying to postpone answering for just a few seconds. “You wouldn’t be the only one.”
“It’s all right. I’ll cook for us tonight. And then we’ll go to the beach, as you wished. Although I have never understood why people think the beach is romantic.”
“Is he expecting your visit, sir?”
“It’s not what we’re here for though,” the first woman reminded her consorts. She walked up to Draco with a familiarity that had chills running over his spine. She didn’t even
“Objection. We were only allowed three witnesses,” Doctor Selaminder frowned.
As the others laughed, Draco pulled Albus in a hug and messed up his carefully styled hair. “You wait until I get to grade your NEWT, you won’t be laughing then!”
is what’s wrong. I can’t go in there. They don’t want me there. They feel sorry for my children, but I shouldn’t go in. It’s so wrong. Just let me leave.”
“Good. That’s all I need to hear.” He smiled at the Healer and walked into the room, not hesitating to sit down on the bed and giving Draco a kiss on the temple. “Hi, Malfoy. I hear you’ve been troubling the Healers. Why can’t you give everyone some rest, even when you are in the hospital, huh?”
The Healer swallowed twice, not looking at Harry. “I’m sure he will be relieved from his pain very soon, sir.”
I have a joke, and I think it's really funny but no one else seems to think it is. I hate people.
Potter shook his head, drifting closer to watch Draco’s fingers move silently, as if he was already playing a song in his mind.
“Sounds like a bad relationship,” James remarked carefully.
“Scorp! Scorpy! Scorro! Scorpius! It’s snowing!” he called from the other side of the Hall. “It’s snowing, come on, let’s go outside! Time for a snow fight!”
“Mister Malfoy –“
she was home, we slept very far apart from one another. Physical contact was sparse, especially in our latest years.”
At least, it was wonderful to Potter. He still didn’t know exactly what the point of the story had been, but he felt elated just watching Draco’s Patronus unfold.
“Children. Got to love them, even when they’re being brats,” Potter echoed his early sentiment.
“No, no, I’m not doing that. Potter has already seen that one.”
Arthur winked. “Exactly. Now, where are Victoire and Teddy? I want my presents!”
Tentatively taking a sip, Draco racked his brain to come up with a new conversational subject, but was interrupted by Potter’s voice. He and Hagrid exchanged a few pleasantries, before Witherwings was called and they took off without much trouble. Potter even let Draco steer, which meant that Draco could ensure no one saw them.
Potter bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, in order to keep himself from crying. “I understand. I really do. And trust me when I say that I feel the same fears. Perhaps a lesser version of them, but I feel them too. But I am telling you that you don’t need to worry, until the Healers say something is wrong. He will be all right. And you need to be cheered up. Are you in the mood for some music?”
“I don’t think so.”
When the nine of them were piled into the car and their luggage had been put in the trunk, they drove off into the sunshine. The light bothered Draco while driving, blinding him so much that he almost slammed into another car on one of the smaller country roads on their way to the Malfoy Lodge. It was in Flitwick, a fact that had led to many a laughing afternoon since his twins went to Hogwarts, somewhat away from the business of London, but close enough to have a short trip to Diagon Alley if needed. Flitwick had no magical inhabitants except for the Malfoys, and they were very happy that their house had many acres of land around it: accidental magic could easily be hidden from the Muggles.
“So. That’s a pretty long list of people we know personally – or semi-personally – that are involved. Imagine how many more are part of it. If all the parents of these students are part of the movement, we have a lot of trouble coming up.”
Theresa laughed again, standing up to clean their work table. “It’s obvious, Professor. Don’t even try to pretend you are not together.”
“Did Aquila deserve it? Really?” After a pause, Albus pressed on, taking a step closer. “Are children really supposed to pay for their parents’s mistakes?”
Sharing a surprised look with Potter, Draco let his head lean back against the pillows and groaned. “Fine. Lily, you are wise and responsible and good, just like the others. Now go tell them so I can tell these adult-ish people what they want to hear.”
“I don’t drool over him like most people do. I’m not afraid to tell him how stupid he is being. And in return, he helps me protect my little snakes. Though no one knows about that, just me and McGonagall. I wrote you about Terence and Priscus, at the start of this year, right?”
“Yes, Victoire has something to say,” Teddy offered, making Victoire gape unattractively.
in their bedroom.”
“Well, I challenge you, all of you Gryffindors, to write an assignment about a potion I have never heard of.”
The last verse had Aquila and James in the front, their black hair standing out against the still fizzling fireworks behind them. Aquila’s clear voice was definitely the voice that had been the main back-up vocal, but the male lead hadn’t been James. At the end of the verse, James twirled Aquila before she went to Ravenclaw and he to Gryffindor, ruffling Keira’s hair and patting Arthur’s shoulder to be annoying.
“Truce?”
James grabbed the feather from Mr. Malfoy’s hands and put it down with the other ingredients. “No time to talk. Something unique for the victim, something unique. How can there be an ingredient unique to the victim? What is this nonsense?”
“No, Potter. I am merely trying to be the more mature one.”
Cassie frowned at him, tugging him back when he made to enter the warehouse. “They can’t be stupid enough to let Aquila keep her wand, can they?”
“I have only just revived, we should really not overly burden my heart. No heavy conversation, only fun. Jokes. Happiness. Yay, I didn’t die!” Draco tried.
McGonagall looked at him with an open mouth. “How was Albus after that?”
“We have two options, and we’re not yet sure what to do. We could either set our eyes on Aquila,” Zarnel continued casually, “since she isn’t as protected as the others are. She doesn’t sleep in Slytherin dorms, so she can be easily gotten to. We can hurt her, break her, make her our victim. You know as well as I do that Scorpius won’t survive that. Or, we could change tactics and turn to Jackie.”
the sign above the door read. A large area around it was marked by a fence with only one gate. Harry guessed the gate could only be opened if your magical signature was approved beforehand by Draco himself.
At that, Potter blanched, but shrugged it off – even if with a strained smile. “I dare you.”
“I’m not angry that you interrupted anything, because you didn’t –“
And please let me know what you thought of this chapter. It doesn't even have to be full sentences, just GIBBY GABBY GOO I SAY BOO is welcome as well :D
From all around you.
“Papa is
“I saw them talking last week. They are so… mature about their relationship. Like they expect for it to last a lifetime.”
When he returned, Draco decided to throw up a subject of himself, just to make sure the conversation wouldn’t go in any unwanted directions.
“Unless your Grandmère didn’t ask officially, in the board, but just a few members. You once told me that she was still a bit wary of Hermione?”
“Sure. Where will you keep Alistair, by the way?”
One. I will not tolerate any jokes at the expense of me or any of my colleagues, here at Hogwarts.
“He never told me. He told James however, and he can’t keep a secret from me.
“Well, Mr. Potter, that is the secret of the gift-giver. I’m glad you liked them. I wouldn’t want any of Draco’s friends to dislike their chocolates.”
Jackie? Draco thought, but didn’t say. Better let Zarnel do her talking.
Yep. So yeah, everything goes to shit. Sorry.
Draco stumbled during his landing, heart rabbiting in his chest and hands clammy. “I now know why I didn’t become a professional criminal,” he breathed. “That was terrifying. They’ll come and find me, you know.”
So, Potter moved a bit closer. His thumb and pointer finger hovered over Draco’s ring finger and pinkie at Potter’s inhale, and faintly stroked over them at his exhale. With lightning speed, Draco removed his hand and placed it on Potter’s thigh again, where it was so distinctly uncomfortable that Draco’s entire chest tensed with keeping it there against gravity.
Draco sighed unnoticeably.
“I’ll call in sick, and either sit in the audience or be an official witness for your barrister. I know how trials work, even the Red Cases. I’ve had a few of them myself. I can help you, Mr. Malfoy.”
“But papa –“
“Hey Albie,” she whispered when the lesson was being continued. “Is it just me, or is there something going on between Uncs Harry and Professor Malfoy?”
“Am not.”
“Have you guys done all your homework? No essays or assignments left to do?” Potter asked sternly. His son shook his head dramatically.
Draco seemed to think about that for a second, before he closed the drawer and locked it tight, grabbing Potter’s hand and pulling him out of the office. In the hallways, he released Potter’s hand, but the smiles he kept shooting Potter were enough. They twisted through the dungeons, into hallways Potter wasn’t even sure were known on the Marauder’s Map, and ended in front of a heavy brass door.
“I only thought you would help us, since you owe me, and all.”
“Yes, I know. What kind of picture? It might be easier to find if we know what we’re looking for.”
Draco supressed a frown. “Ah, well, he is much the same, really.”
Scorpius’s upper lip curled somewhat in distaste and anger, but he quickly turned it into a smile as everyone present laughed and nodded in agreement.
“Why not? Isn’t that the only way to make people accept you?”
They Apparated back to the outer quarters of Hogsmeade while an alarm started ringing in the Ministry.
Just to their left was a greenhouse. Harry saw an elf puttering about, watering the plants and cutting those that had grown too long.
“I believe that you all have something for me. An essay to hand in, perhaps?” Draco asked. Almost every student took out a piece of parchment from their bags and books, some students having written barely a few lines, others having created an entire booklet of knowledge. James Potter, however, raised his hand.
“Oh no, you misunderstand. Your failures make me happy, not you. Details matter, Professor Potter.”
being put in Vince’s trousers.”
is not new at all. We’re not stupid.”
“How were you cured?”
“What?”
No answer. “What are you doing here?” Draco asked instead.
Draco stood still and looked down at his outfit. It was a very pale blue, matching his skin in paleness, but his eyes in electric blue. A bit like the transparent blue of ice caps. Draco liked these robes. But his children might be right. He only wore them when he was planning something. This morning, however, he had pulled them out without thinking much of it.
“Because the thestrals don’t like it.”
Draco grimaced. “You were the only one who thought I was a catch, Pansy-poo.” Pansy scowled at the ancient nickname. “But no, I don’t think he has much of a love life. He’s far too obsessed with the Potter kid.”
“Oh yes. He most certainly did. He wouldn’t have greeted you as
else would be susceptible enough to be roped into following a movement that is trying to kill me?”
“It’s all right if you don’t want to tell me, you know. It’s your life. I’m just wondering why you would even need my approval for your date,” Draco said, while the beginnings of a smirk tugged the corners of his mouth up. Potter narrowed his eyes at him, while Draco stayed focussed on James.
“Is it okay if I get you down from your hook for a second, so I can see the wall behind you?” Potter begged. It resulted in another shrug.
“Anyway, papa is the most stubborn person I know. He sticks to his own plan, even if it is disastrous.”
Eyes widening and valiantly trying to suppress his chuckles, Potter stared at the plate. “Malfoy, this is a quarter of that upper tier. And this is your
“It seems everyone’s love life is going great then, doesn’t it? You and Suzanne, Albus and Manila.”
“And do you clean, or does Kreacher do that?”
“Fifth year it was. What happened during fifth year? We had Umbridge, we started the DA…”
Deep down inside, however, Scorpius was the sweetest child. He hated everyone who would stand in Aquila’s way and protected his youngest brother with his life, when they walked down Diagon Alley. His smile could light up the world, and his laughter actually tinkled. He was a very proud boy, though. Proud of his family and proud of his heritage —if one just skipped the part his family played in the Wizarding Wars. He didn’t dislike Muggles, but did tend to be attracted to purebloods. But, Draco reasoned, Scorpius had always chosen the old brooms of his father, rather than a new Firebolt, even when he couldn’t see the difference yet. He probably just senses old magic.
Aquila owned all attention when she casually flicked her hair and raised and imperial eyebrow. “I don’t see how any House could be better than Ravenclaw.”
“I want to be your best man. Can I be your best man?”
“Typical,” Draco grumbled, tugging on his –rather fashionable- Muggle coat and winded his scarf around his neck. “Everyone wearing warm enough clothes? Aquila, do you have your gloves? You know how cold your hands get.”
A few other Slytherins also tried to convince Draco, but he was adamant about not doing it, until a soft voice from the rug in front of the fire sounded.
“How do you know it works?”
Draco grinned, looking down at his vegetables. Potter thought he saw a blush on his cheekbones, but he couldn’t be sure. Mostly because he couldn’t quite believe Draco would blush now, of all days.
Draco was stopped from walking to his seat at the High Table by James, who was standing squarely in front of him.
While Scorpius seemed calm and in control, his eyes couldn’t hide his emotions. They were burning with so much rage, so much hatred, that Draco almost feared for Potter’s well-being.
“I think it does. You are an adult, you count twice. Come on, let’s go,” she ordered.
“We do need a lot of help now to get them together. We should arrange our first meeting,” Scorpius mused, meaning the Weasley, Potter and Malfoy children and Neville, Pansy and Blaise. They would have to make a solid plan of approach for this task.
“How much would you value a promise, if Draco gave you his word on it?” Doctor Selaminder asked.
“You’re not angry, are you?” he asked softly.
“Are you going together?” one of the girls that had been with Draco asked disbelievingly.
“Would you be willing to take Veritaserum now?”
“Harry, my man! Long time no see! Tell us everything that’s happened, we’re curious!” he yelled, as he wrapped Potter in a big hug. Potter, to his credit, didn’t even hesitate before returning the sentiment with a grin and uttered some sincere-sounding words of interest as well.
“Goodnight. I love you.” Draco pecked on his cheek before moving away. Phi was waiting on the other side of the door with a fond smile that grew into a fond grin.
All three of them laughed loudly, attracting attention from the rest of the students.
Harry laughed. “Well, you shouldn’t have proposed on the beach then.”
“Sure. I’ll make sure the children will be ready to go when you get down. Don’t rush.”
“All right. Okay, yes, okay. Sit down, please. ‘Bout five years ago, a movement came up, very hush-hush and very much in secret. Aim was to ‘ensure justice to victimised families.’ They stole money and houses from Death Eaters, gave them to those families that lost stuff. Last few years, it got worse. Started killing Death Eaters, got sneakier in assaulting them and finding them. I’ve always been high on the list of Death Eaters that had to be paid back, preferably in the worst possible way.”
After she had left, Potter sidled up to Draco. He didn’t say anything, but took his hand and squeezed it, still staring at James, who was now whispering with Scorpius.
Potter held out his arm, not sure how to do it right. Draco took his wrist and twisted his arm a quarter of a turn, so it was in the right position for Draco to give Amber. Potter slowly petted the ruffled feathers on Amber’s head and cooed a bit. Draco read the letter he had finally managed to open.
Now and forever more.
Draco shook his head. “Because, of all people, Phi is the one with the most experience in controlling magic. He knows best how to calm oneself to stop outbursts. Scorpius, stop shielding James. You’re making it worse.”
“Take your pick,” Draco said, offering the paper to Potter. “I have everything that’s on that list.”
“How do you know? I mean, Draco always told us that
“Cassie needs to learn to deal with her nightmares on her own. One day I won’t be here, Potter, and that day may come sooner than we all think.”
“Really?” James exclaimed. “It works? That is so cool! And what now?”
“Severus gave me the strength to not give you away, in the Manor. Severus gave me the strength to practice my Occlumency so Tom couldn’t look into my brain. Severus gave me the strength to keep my head high, my back straight when Tom lived in the Manor and threatened my parents. Severus saved me from dying. His death took away the one father figure who didn’t fall for ambition without regrets, the father figure who taught me that it was all right to show weakness, every once in a while.
The magic tingled again, and Draco knew Phi had changed his appearance, from the Hufflepuff boy he had pretended to be, to his normal, jet-black character. Before he could apologise, Potter cut in.
“I’m good. Wanna get out of water though.”
“Maybe better if you keep this with you. I shouldn’t be betting. Sorry.”
“Goodnight. Will you sleep well?”
“Except that Draco has always had a relatively good relationship with the kitchen elves. They have probably taken care of him.”
He was halted by a cynical laughter. “How’s Scorpius doing then?”
Bill frowned. “So? What use is that?”
“Malfoy, listen to me,” he demanded. Draco stilled for a moment, but turned to face Potter.
“Oh, they’re easy. It’s all based on leverage. As long as there is mutual leverage, there will be a friendship.”
“That has never been enough, has it?” Flitwick asked suspiciously.
Potter wasn’t there yet. Hagrid, however, shoved a large mug of brown, sluggish liquid in front of Draco and offered him a cookie.
“Are you waiting for a date, Professor?” a Hufflepuff girl asked.
“And yet, you did, in the War. You killed Nagini, for Merlin’s sake. You already once broke into Mysteries. Why worry now, with people you’ve got far less to fear of?”
Smiths slowly turned red, eyes widening and fish-mouthing dumbly. Then he cast his eyes downward and mumbled, “A suspect was uninformed of the case, with resulted in being sentenced to the Dementor’s Kiss. However, a week after the sentence was fulfilled, there was undeniable proof that the suspect had been innocent.”
On his first check-up round, he saw Lucy Weasley have a lot of trouble with cutting the beans. Her partner was stirring the bubbling liquid in their cauldron and couldn’t help her. Draco walked up to their work table. Lucy visibly startled at his appearance.
Potter was literally pouting, with a tiny little crease between his eyes and the kind of look that Phi gave whenever Draco didn’t allow him to go flying.
Among loud cheers from the others in the room, including Potter, the traitor, Draco stood up to take away Pansy’s dangerously swirling glass and have her sit down. A sound of disappointment went through the room when it became clear that Draco was not going to sing in front of them, and no, Pansy, he would also not be dancing, especially not on
Lily and Cassie shared a look, after which Lily stood up and asked for attention. “Dad, Draco, we want to say something. You know how much we want you to be together, and we understand that it may take time for you to give in to it. Therefore, we will not force you to answer any questions. However, we think it’s for the best if the two of you talk honestly. No chance of lying, no pretending and no hiding things. Even though you may feel you have bared your soul to one another multiple times now, we know for a fact that there are many unspoken problems between you. We have tried to get you talking about it, but it never worked. Veritaserum was our only option. Punishment is all right, as long as you talk. Please.”
Draco nodded. “You’re right.”
“I merged the Malfoy crest and the most recent Potter crest I could find. You see, it now says ‘Malfoy-Potter.’ I wanted to try ‘Potter-Malfoy’, but it turned out that the Malfoy name can only be legally merged, if it is the first name, so there it is. Ehm, the snake is curled around the lion’s cubs, protecting them.”
Phi made an indignant sound, while Potter chuckled.
“He is going to push everyone away if we let him. He is going to be miserable. We have to do something.”
to the Slytherins had changed, that it now felt more vindictive than before. As if there was more purpose behind it.”
He was silent and seemed to hesitate to say something. Draco suspected it was about their schooldays. He took a deep breath and started talking.
His children must have understood Draco’s meaning.
“What’s going on, Potter? Why are you so restless?” Draco frowned. “Out with it.”
Draco scoffed, but couldn’t help being pleasantly amazed at how easily Potter seemed to read his mood. Had he been wearing purple last week in the hospital? Apparently.
otherwise. He would have smiled at you, or nodded in greeting. But not this. Albus, we are becoming brothers!” Scorpius stated confidently, hugging Albus close and sending a private smile at Aquila.
Whooooo I'm late again, I'm such a prodigy and I am so good at keeping to deadlines. (Forgive me.)
“Ooh, so I’ve got a chance with you?” Neville snickered.
Comments are very welcome! Comments are my life and my love. Comments are the Minnie to my Mickey, the left sock to my right sock, the oxygen to my red blood cells, the sugar to my cake, and the Scorpius to my Draco. I'm just not complete without your comments.
“I should go.”
After the musical, Potter led him to the Thames, where a small boat was waiting for them. There was a bottle of red wine and a cheese plate on the small table. Potter easily got the boat moving, after which they drifted along the London shores, enjoying the lights of the city and its monuments.
“I told you I’ve never been in love. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. The only thing I can do, is courting someone in the pureblood manner, but I hardly think that is what he wants. If he even wants me to do anything. And courting seems a bit too serious, doesn’t it?” Draco said with a deep rumble to his tone. He was nervous, but trying his best to trust Neville like he might trust Pansy and Blaise. He wanted Neville as his friend, and he was sure Neville wanted that as well.
Cassie grinned at Draco’s miffed look. Sitting opposite of him, she leant forward to pick a small piece of the white chocolate covered cake and ate it, making a show of enjoying it. Draco narrowed his eyes at her playfully.
“Good day, Professor. I will owl you sometime. Please extend my apologies to Malfoy and all victims.” With these words, he walked away as well, not releasing his deathly grip on his son’s collar.
“Think of the entire year. What happened between papa and Harry?”
That caught Potter’s interest. He glanced at his students to see them all working –the Weasleys seemed to be working very hard today- and turned to face Ophiuchus fully.
“He can take it. But since you’ve just rejected me, can I have a free pass on all pranks you do?”
“Sure. Night, Malfoy.”
“My essay is a report of an extensive experiment. The experiments end today, at five o’clock. I need to measure the results and after that, I need to work those into a passable essay. That is why I don’t have my essay yet.”
Hiya! Here's another chapter. I hope you still like it. Sorry for being so slow on the updates, I'm trying to have one up every week. Comment if you want to, and thank you!
, I have to face the hard truth that
“Sure. That’s why you were so shocked, and that’s why you tried to deny you fancied someone, even though you were dosed with Veritaserum.”
“I know,” he continued in a softer tone, “that there are people among you who do not trust a Malfoy. Let alone a Malfoy with a twisted scar on his forearm. I know that I have to earn your good opinion and fight for your trust. And I will. That is a promise I intend to keep.” When he locked eyes with Scorpius, he saw his son’s eyes widen in surprise, and then soften in encouragement. Albus, next to him, was squirming a bit uncomfortably, but when he caught Draco’s gaze, he smiled as well.
“You still have my Bordeaux robes, Potter. I am not gifting you with my entire wardrobe.”
“Aquila, I believe this one is yours,” Draco announced, handing one over.
Potter’s frown deepened. “Why don’t you expel them?” he wondered.
Draco crouched in front of her. “That is a very long story, Cassiopeia. I don’t want to bother you with it now.”
With a sigh, Draco picked up his fork and started eating. The bites he took were small and slow, and he scowled at his plate the entire time, but he ate.
“Yeah.”
“Hi.”
They flew for an hour, after which their hands were cold and they returned to Hagrid’s for another mug of hot, brown, sluggish something.
“I don’t think
“Inherited from their father, who’d been bitten by Greyback in the war.”
“Do you remember that evening that Blaise and I were visiting Draco and you were there as well? Draco told us that Neville plied him with Veritaserum. Apparently, Neville asked him what his type was. When it turned out to be a very specific description, he forced Draco to think about what it meant. Then, you and Draco played a Seeker’s game, if I understand correctly?”
, 1985, died March 26
“And who has killed or badly hurt someone that meant a lot to or was family of another person at this table?” Draco continued then. Without opening his eyes, he snapped, “Potter, put your hand down
started playing.
Clearly hesitating, Scorpius stalled until Cassie nodded at him. Immediately after they had all lowered their wands, a blast of magic sprang free, blowing Phi against the wall. He quickly scrambled back up, towards James to speak to him in soothing tones.
Fifth, he sees Potter’s friends. Strong, powerful, loving and loved. Looking at Draco like he was trash.
“Dead?”
“Just so you know, I haven’t played an actual game where I had to work to get the Snitch,” Draco warned. “And I still can’t take a loss. So if you dislike playing against Ginny because she can’t take a loss, you should back out now.”
After what felt like thirty seconds, but was more like thirty minutes, the door of Draco’s room opened again to let in the other three Malfoys, guided by his Healer that came to check up on his vitals.
When Draco left the greenhouse, the door swung close with a bang behind him. He watched through the glass to see Cassie peek between some plants. At their eye contact, she ducked away and continued with her plants, pretending she hadn’t noticed a thing.
“Exactly. But in fact, Cassie would be the one that is most like me. Everything about her is so incredibly recognisable for me, it’s frightening.”
“Not even after hearing the testimonies?”
Draco chuckled and did a one-shouldered shrug. “It’s not like I sleep a lot at night. But will you be all right? You came here for your nightmares, after all.”
He noticed, however, that the blond man was scrutinising him. Draco looked at him, actually
“Draco, Ms. Granger and I are on polite terms now, so I would like you to be kind to her. Of course, she is Mr. Potter’s best friend, so I expect you’ll be nice if only for his sake. I was very glad to hear from Cassie that you were getting close. It’s good that you are making friends. Oh look, here we are.”
“I’m not really an animal lover. I much prefer to look at them from a distance.”
Sighing, Draco snuggled into the corner of the sofa he was sitting on for more comfort and took a sip of his wine.
Nagini attacked.
“James and Suzanne. They’re revolting, aren’t they?”
Draco nodded. “Exactly like that.
“It’s to counter Boggarts. You just say the incantation, and the Boggart will turn into something funny,” Albus told the class. Scorpius frowned.
Draco ushered Potter to the hallway, so he could lock the door behind him and rushed towards breakfast. Potter was a mess next to him, with uncombed hair and continuously yawning. Together, they marched towards the Hall. When they arrived, there were only fifteen minutes left. Draco let Potter go in first, straightened his own robes, and followed. Scorpius’s eyes were bulging out of his sockets and Aquila was having trouble containing her laughter. Cassiopeia was told by Scorp and Albus what was funny, and she seemed to start crying from her mirth. Potter was striding to the High Table, quickly piling his plate with food and started eating. Draco rolled his eyes. So much for tact.
You can’t lead him on like this. It’s not healthy, not for you and not for him. If the reasons of your inhibitions are so strong, let him go entirely. I don’t want you hurting him. You’ve hurt him enough in your life.”
“If you’re going to sing, sing like you mean it,” he demanded laughingly. Potter put down the ball of dough he had been kneading and looked Draco straight in the eye. When he had caught Draco’s gaze, he started dancing abominably while increasing his volume of singing.
what is going on here? I can’t believe
“Definitely. At least try?” Scorpius asked.
“Idiots,” Draco mumbled.
And Salazar, how
“I can teach you, if you want.”
Groaning, Draco tried to sit up, but didn’t manage until a passing Healer stopped at his room and helped him up with a pitying smile. Lucius sneered nastily to chase the Healer away as soon as possible.
Casting a quick Tempus charm, Draco saw he only had twenty more minutes. His classes were over, and he didn’t have anything to do until dinner, since it was exam week and the Potions exams only started tomorrow. His children were freaking out.
“And happy. Very happy.”
Draco chuckled wetly. “The same way as you are. Lift your head up, straighten your shoulders and pretend everything is fine.”
Theresa hid her confusion almost as soon as it hit her, but Draco saw that first unguarded second when it flitted over her face. He sighed inwardly. Of course it would take everyone a lot of time to get used to Draco and Potter not talking anymore. Draco would have to up his game, if he wanted people to know they weren’t interacting at all.
He nodded.
All three watched Harry and Draco, who watched each other until Harry shrugged. Draco rolled his eyes. “Only when completely distracted,” Draco muttered then. He elbowed Harry before he started to grin and glared at the children, but to no avail. Soon enough, all four of them were snickering uncontrollably.
“Of course. The research consisted of brewing potions, as I said, with magically adapted ingredients. I am not sure which ingredients have been adapted, and how, but I know the result was that less enhancers were necessary.
“How about Truth or Dare?” Pansy offered.
Laughing softly, Draco put his feet up on the coffee table to drink his tea, while Potter went to the kitchen for something. The latter returned with a bar of white chocolate, which he handed to Draco with a kiss.
“Mr. Malfoy. Pleasure to meet you,” Ms. Euripideia said, standing to offer Draco her hand. Her manner of movement struck Draco as familiar, but he couldn’t quite place it.
“Where did you even get Vicuña robes, dad?” Albus asked. “Like, if you don’t know what it is, why would you buy it? I suspect it costed more than the rest of your wardrobe combined.”
Potter grinned. “Something good?”
Draco chuckled. “That’s true. Apparently, it’s not just the Malfoy bloodline that people like to assault.”
“Oui, Ophiuchus, tu as raison. But perhaps you shouldn’t speak in a language not everyone can follow. It is not polite.” Draco chastised softly.
“Papa, come,” he said, bringing Draco to a side corridor where they could speak.
“Perhaps. I’m not aware of any families with that name. What I want to know is what Septimius’s role was in this thing. Did he support Whithal’s case, or did he just do whatever his partner wanted?”
“How do you control the amount of magic, then?” he asked.
“Yes,” Draco said, not sure whether he was confirming the statement of answering the unsaid question.
Potter sighed softly, tapping Draco’s hip with two fingers in understanding.
“Which leads me to the conclusion that you still do. Like me.”
Phi purred softly, sitting down instead of standing, and let Draco take a good look at him. It was obviously still a young panther, bigger than a cub but very clearly not yet adult.
next week, you would still get an O. It’s your best class!”
I'm sorry, this is a rubbish chapter. I don't have enough time to think about how to formulate things, with all these festivities.
“No, he isn’t. I saw him in Hogsmeade. I think he is too young to be at Hogwarts, but his family doesn’t love him. Should I do anything to help him?”
Draco frowned. If he lived with Muggles, he probably wouldn’t know about Hogwarts. Was he a Squib, after all? Now,
