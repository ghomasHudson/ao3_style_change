"I might... fancy you too. A little bit, just a little bit, mind you," Draco says, his face growing warm.
This is beyond his locking charms. Annoyance mounting, Draco unleashes a barrage of unlocking spells, but to no avail. He steps back and glares at the dungeons, before lunging forward and banging on his own door. “Let me in!" he yells. "I've got piles to mark, and I just want to sit down somewhere and eat, you meddling castle!"
Draco bites hard on his Quidditch gloves — his hands are already full with his jersey, knee pads and broom polishing kit — as he hurtles through the courtyard. Salazar, he's so late for training, why did he have a lie-down after dinner? He skids around a corner—
Thank you so much for reading! You can show your appreciation for the author in a comment here or on
badge, the magic in it already long gone. "Did you expect that we'd be here, years into the future, laughing at this?" Potter asks thoughtfully, turning it over.
When the strippers finish their set, Harry gets up and threads his way to where they step off the stage. He can only proceed a few steps along the narrow corridor when he sees a pair of bouncers lurking around a corner. The Invisibility Cloak presses against his thigh, and he's just about to use it when he hears a door open and footsteps drawing closer. He hurries back to the main area and watches as a fresh group of strippers emerge, flanked by the bouncers, who stand guard at the spot where Harry stood mere seconds ago. Harry spots another pair of bouncers and strippers crossing the adjacent walkway.
Lust storms through Harry’s blood, his grip tightening on Malfoy’s thigh as he hits that spot over and over. Sweat gathers in his lower back, his body going warm all over. Malfoy trembles like earlier, and Harry clenches his teeth at the familiar sensation of his balls drawing up, the intense pressure signifying one of the best, if not the best orgasm—
Dean is perusing the largest painting — Times Square. His arms are folded across his chest, and his chin is held between a thumb and a forefinger, deep in thought. He takes a step to the left, looking at it from another angle. Harry approaches him, keen on hearing his thoughts about this particular piece — the best so far, in his humble opinion.
Compared to his last visit, Draco is at a much better place now. He has a stable career, and his new book about tidying is at its final stage of editing — in fact, he was busy selecting the cover of the book with Harry's help yesterday. Harry, meanwhile, quit his job of drudgery at the Department of Magical Transportation and is working at Morgan’s, where he teaches guitar and goes for jamming sessions. He wrote his first song last week, and Draco loves how excited and alive he was when he played it for Draco. On top of all of that, they also have Hermione and Weasley's wedding to look forward to.
He can't help but look towards the closed door of his kitchen, knowing that Potter's only a street away. So close, yet so far. He's sat in Azkaban for six months and lived in another country for two years, but he's never really forgotten about Potter — his schoolboy infatuation since fifth year morphed into a full-blown crush when Potter saved him twice — in the Fiendfyre and by testifying for him even though Draco was never his to save.
) after declaring that the Malfoys' tea service was too stuffy for their flat. Draco had hated it at first because it stuck out like a sore thumb, but over time, he had developed a particular liking for it.
"Three days? I call a week," Hermione pauses to catch herself. "Oh what am I talking about? It's Malfoy. Five days."
Draco’s tempted, but they’re not familiar enough to be nicking food off each other’s plates, so he declines.
If life is like a Hollywood movie or some sort of fairy tale, Draco would come charging in with grand gestures and touching words, bags and guitar in hand, ready to go home with him.
"We don't know if there'll be other opportunities like this," Kingsley adds. Harry exhales heavily, knowing that it's true. Once again, Harry finds his gaze wandering to the picture of Malfoy.
on love letters and Glamours on love bites, but how could he? How could he forget everything when every single time he turned his neck he felt the soreness of Harry’s secret lingering bites stinging, marking his skin?
Draco relaxes his throat as he closes his eyes and sucks hard, easing it deeper into his mouth. Potter's abdomen clenches, and he longs to pull off to look at Potter's expression, but he has to concentrate. He paces himself, breathing through his nose while his mouth works its magic. His eyes watering, Draco swallows another inch, and another, until it nudges the back of his throat, and even so, it’s not fully in yet.
This is a familiar refrain of Draco’s clients, and this is when he would firmly point them to the right direction. But what sort of direction is Potter inclined to?
"I'll do anything you want," Draco murmurs. He pushes in further, his stroke slow and sure, until he's fully seated, so deep that his hips are pressed flush against Potter's arse, his balls brushing against Potter's flesh.
"But I think we're not ready for marriage yet. If you ask me why, I can't give you an answer. As of now,
Pansy gestures to a bottle of water near Potter, and he tosses it at her. She pops the lid open and raises an eyebrow. "Book club? Don't tell me that Granger finally managed to infuse some semblance of culture in you after all these years," she says. Her lips curve into a bland smile, taking the barb out of her words. Before Weasley can muster a reply, her eyes swivel to Potter's outfit, observing his scuffed boots and the oil from his bike stained on the thighs of his jeans. "You'd think that with all those Galleons you have, Potter, you'd get some decent clothes."
Out of the many Potter-related scenarios (that he had thought would never happen, but apparently he was wrong) that Draco daydreams about, he had never imagined a scene whereby Potter would be asking him out in a roar right in the middle of the courtyard. Draco's face grows warm when the surrounding students stop and stare at him as he dashes back to Potter.
The window trembles when Potter slams his forearm against it and thumps his forehead on his arm. Draco presses his front against Potter's back and covers his neck and shoulders with kisses.
Encouraged by his sweet tooth, Draco agrees. He licks his lips when Potter brings over a plate of croissants. They look absolutely exquisite — the pastry is flaky, with glossy, thick chocolate oozing out from the croissant. He takes a bite, closes his eyes and hums his approval, savouring the rich flavour of the chocolate and the buttery crunch of the croissant. Conscious, Draco passes a thumb over his lower lip, wiping away smears of leftover chocolate.
He's gonna buy Malfoy the biggest and the most extravagant bouquet of roses tomorrow, so fancy and impressive that it'll put all other rose bouquets to shame.
It’s already November, and term will end soon for Christmas. He’s mostly glad, as he can return to France to see Mother and Pansy, and also take a much-deserved break from the busy humdrum of school, but a part of him is disappointed, because he can’t see Potter every day.
"A few lessons you can learn from this," Malfoy says, addressing the class. He counts them off his fingers. "Use the environment to your advantage, have a wide variety of spells at your arsenal, the utility of disillusionment charms, and knowing your enemy, especially if you've fought him before. It is also useful to be physically responsive with excellent reflexes." He gestures to Harry. "And that's why I highly recommend participating in Mr Potter's lessons — they will go a long way in developing your reflexes.
Harry’s anger drains out; instead, he’s filled with a blank, empty horror when he visualises the Dark Mark — the exact replica of Snape’s own Mark that he had flashed in the hospital wing — marring the perfect, pale skin on Draco’s left forearm.
There's a long moment of silence as they simply hold each other, taking their time to return to reality after a bout of phenomenal sex.
Harry thinks of the Empire State Building, of a kiss so gentle and sweet that his heart breaks apart all over again.
Draco blinks, and now, it's his turn to raise his eyebrow. "I think that's enough gossip for today."
"Stop being a git," Potter says good-naturedly and pats the space on the bench beside him. "It's nice and quiet here."
It's different now — although the school year has officially ended, Draco doesn’t experience the usual sense of closure.
“Yeah?” Potter says, his breath hitching. He speeds up, fucking into Draco harder and faster, quickly matching the intensity of their coupling at the teachers’ table. “Love how you look, how you sound, so wild, out of control, love how you feel, so fucking good, love how you…” Potter babbles, his head thrown back and his palms braced on the table. He pumps his hips steadily, his cock slamming in and out, as he chases his orgasm. He stares at Draco with wide eyes, fuck, he’s so close—
"Well, that depends. Am I gonna get some sort of compensation if I do offer my help?" Draco snarks back in an unhurried drawl. Despite the question, he shrugs off the blanket and pads towards Harry. He yawns and stretches his arms high up into the air.
"Let's just leave him to it," Hermione whispers. Ron nods and leaves the bag on a nearby counter. They close the door behind them and head towards their booth.
Charlie looks at the injury and winces at the memory. "Yeah. She's a right fighter, that one. She and I go a long way back, and... " He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. "She's not doing too well at the moment." His expression of concern morphs into irritation when his fingers catch on air instead of his usual ponytail.
"Hang on," Draco says, stopping Harry when he's in the middle of wiping down the counter. "With the exception of Humphrey, you've known the other owls previously. Does this mean that only I received the letter?"
It doesn’t matter if Potter slept with Wood or not, because there’ll always be some little worshipper eager enough for a quick, meaningless shag with him.
Draco picks up the box and hugs it hard, trying to feel his heartbeat through this box of memories, because he can no longer feel it in his chest.
Ron shrugs and spears a sausage. "It didn't go so bad, did it? Malfoy didn't make fun of you, come to think of it."
There Potter sits, on his own broom in his Quidditch leathers, an eyebrow raised and a cheeky grin playing on his lips.
Harry's laugh cuts off when the doors of the Great Hall swing open, revealing Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini.
Potter considers the question. "Lighter. Like there's more space, both outside and inside," he says, pressing a palm to his chest. He beams — a proper one that makes Draco's heart stop for a second before beating in double quick-time.
"You're squeezing my bum," he says in a horrified whisper. He seems more aghast at his own reaction to Harry’s bum-squeezing rather than the squeezing itself, George is amused to note.
Humphrey screeches in annoyance, but settles down at Draco's side. He starts to groom himself, nibbling at his claws and toes with his beak.
Potter has breathed life into Pansy and Draco's design. The harsh, unforgiving darkness of the Mark is rejuvenated with a vibrant firework of colours. Inside the snake's coiling, sinuous body, Potter has tattooed a winding chain of green and silver narcissus flowers—colours of the Malfoy crest—although the flowers surrounding the Dark Mark are in shades of white, light yellow and pale pink, these delicate colours a pleasing balance to the deeper green. Instead of the two hollow sockets in the skull, there are now two golden Snitches, their white wings spread in flight. At the bottom of the tattoo, nestled between daffodils and narcissus flowers, lie a smaller row of pansies, the colours of these pansies matching Pansy's tattoo.
," Harry muttered, feeling the monster's roars subsiding as it stood down, satisfied at Draco's answer.
"I want you to watch," he says, his voice hoarse. He coats Draco’s cock with more treacle and dives in again. Draco watches, burning the image of Harry sucking his dripping cock like how he can never forget the memory of Harry riding him last night, his cock pushing into Harry's arse just like how it's pushing into Harry's mouth right now, oh
Malfoy lifts his chin and stares at George, incredulous. "I absolutely do not! He is entirely distracting, makes a complete fool of himself and messes everything up!"
Malfoy puts down the photo, turning incredulous eyes on him. "Excuse me? I can't do that?" he snaps, baring his teeth. "Did you exert any self-control when you stopped my wedding? You went and did that, and I can't even say you’re selfish because you saved the bloody wizarding world!"
"Don't ever do anything like that again, please. At least talk to me about it before dropping a bomb like that. You... you really shocked me," Potter says, his voice small and vulnerable.
Sniffling, Hermione takes her daughter into her arms, balancing Rose on her hip and angling Rose towards Ron.
Draco pulls his box towards him. "You told me your stories as we packed," he says. Even though his words are addressed to Potter, he only has eyes for the plain white box. He takes another deep, fortifying breath. "So, I thought it's only fair if I told you some of mine."
," he rants, dangling it in front of Potter's face. "Not only am I a brilliant tidying consultant, I am also extremely stylish, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms that this went out of style seasons ago. The colour does nothing for your eyes and skin tone. This can't look good on anyone, let alone you."
Ron, best mate that he is, offers Harry his tea for a bit while Harry promptly spirals into a "I Can't Believe I Said That" meltdown at the serving line in the Ministry canteen.
“I’d like to get to know you better, too. A lot better,” Draco replies, his words low and sultry as he presses their hips together. Potter’s breath hitches at the slide of their clothed erections. He leans in and licks his way down Potter’s neck, a corner of his lips ticking up into a smile as he kisses the words into Potter’s skin.
Harry stalks out of the suite, wincing and limping slightly — no, he can't leave now, he didn’t take the potion — but before Draco can explain, Harry's gone.
Malfoy's standing at the stove serving up spaghetti Bolognese — Harry admires the elegant turn of his wrists — paired with skinless grilled chicken and garden vegetables. Malfoy flicks his wand and two plates levitate over to the table. He turns to face Harry and casually sucks sauce off a finger, his lips turning up in a coy grin.
Only thirty minutes into the game, and that was the eighth time that Campbell showed visible discomfort.
,” he mutters in shock and sudden arousal, his wide eyes glued to the view of Potter shaking his head vigorously, flicking water everywhere. He recognises the tell-tale shimmer in the air, signalling a strong warming charm around Potter. Potter approaches his pile of things, removes his goggles and bends down to pick up a towel. His mouth dry and his cock hardening, Draco’s hungry gaze follows the route of the towel working its way down Potter’s body — a quick ruffle of his hair, his shoulders, the slopes of his chest, his taut stomach. Merlin, look at the vee of those hips, and more importantly, look at that bulge tucked beneath those ridiculously small swimming pants (which must be Muggle, no decent wizarding shop would sell something that scandalous).
Harry pushes himself away from the door and slumps down against the wall, a fist jammed in his mouth to silence his own cries. Eyes shut tight, a few more pulls on his cock, fuelled by a parade of pornographic Malfoy images prancing in his mind, just a
"Don't tell me you-" He places his hot chocolate on the table, pops open the box and peers at its contents. "Oh sweet Salazar, you
“Jason and I really like Mr Potter’s classes, and basketball is really fun, like football, although we’re still learning. It’s loads of fun, I swear!”
Instead of leaving, Potter blunders into Draco’s bed, which creaks at the additional weight. Draco yelps at the unexpected action and scoots back to make space for him.
"Oh, I've changed," Draco murmurs. A ripple of annoyance surges in Draco when Potter makes a thoroughly unimpressed sound and turns away to make his way to the adjacent rooms.
They look so fucking hot—Harry sprawled out, thighs splayed apart, his head flopped on the back of the sofa, his eyes closed and mouth open in an ‘o’ of pleasure, his hands tugging at soft blond hair. Malfoy kneels in front of him, his head bobbing as he sucks, licks and kisses Harry’s prick, his hands groping him all over—his balls, thighs, legs, abdomen.
A cool breeze flutters over Harry through the open windows, refreshing the musty air coated on his skin like dusk.
Draco — touch yourself right now too, just like I'm doing, make yourself feel good. If only I was there to do it for you. Touch your hard cock for me, stroke it hard and fast, just like that." Every other word is punctuated with a whine. Biting his lip, Draco increases the pace
Fighting to keep the smirk of triumph from spreading across his face, George passes his mug of tea over to his other hand and asks Malfoy in a casual tone, "What's going on?"
"Yeah, we finished it about a month ago. He taught me how to keep things that spark joy close to me, and... er," Potter trails off, slanting a sideways look at Draco before clearing his throat rather awkwardly.
Troubled, Draco looks up and sees Granger and Weasley lounging a distance away, sharing a chaste kiss. They laugh and rest their foreheads together, all frothed up in the summer flings of love.
"Then you didn't mean what you said that day at the High Line. When you said it's alright to get away from it all," Draco snarls, his chin jutting out in combat.
Malfoy unfastens Harry’s trousers and works his hand into his pants. Harry rests his forehead on the other boy’s shoulder, his own hand stroking Malfoy’s hip. They’ll get each other off yet again, with Malfoy's touch overpowering Harry's rational thinking every single time. They'll pretend that there's nothing between them, but with every encounter, Harry's aching heart says otherwise, and he doesn't know how much more he can take—
Taking that as approval, Draco closes his eyes and swirls his tongue around Potter's rim, circling it in a steady pace. It's Potter's extremely good luck that he's especially skilled at rimjobs, having had lots of practice to prepare his previous lovers for his cock. Since he's already fucked Potter, he's loose enough for Draco's tongue to go slightly deeper, but not too deep as he'd rather his fingers do the work later.
he shouts, and Malfoy's eyes widen. He opens his mouth, but only a croak comes forth. Looking wonderfully cornered, he backs away towards the eastern wall of the courtyard.
On multiple occasions, Draco had hurtled into Harry's hospital room barely five minutes after Ron's call. Draco's trousers might have potion stains, or he might even have a nicked finger; he must've been cutting ingredients when he first heard the news of Harry’s injuries.
"Wanna fuck it all in me and make me come so hard I lose my mind?" Harry's voice breaks through Draco's fog of lust and arousal.
His shoulders slumping, Potter gets up and goes to the living room. Draco follows him, and they sit on the floor near the coffee table. Potter pulls out his wand, gulping audibly. He closes his eyes, squares his shoulders and casts a summoning spell.
Malfoy blinks and stares at him. His face then breaks into a smile, a genuine, bright smile that lights up his features and makes Harry’s heart flip-flop in his chest. “I’d like…” His grin dims abruptly. “Oh, but I’ve given Theo the other ticket, so…”
Yawning, Harry almost falls off his chair in mid-stretch when someone clears his throat rather loudly. Harry closes his mouth at once and turns to his left.
It's times like this when Draco suspects that, despite knowing Potter's idiosyncrasies, he's never really figured Potter out at all.
Harry can’t help but to lean in towards Malfoy, and Malfoy's moving closer too. Their lips are so close... just a bit more and they'll be kissing, but neither of them wants to be the one to make the first move.
Draco flashes him a winning smile. "Of course. I am doing business, after all." He whips out a glossy catalogue from his briefcase. "May I interest you in these products to keep your house neat?" Even though he knows Potter won't buy anything, Draco goes through the motions anyway, flipping through pages advertising sleek storage containers for organising things like clothes and cutlery.
When he had started working in the canteen, on some particularly bad days, he thought that Azkaban would be better than being spat on and verbally abused every single day by Ministry employees (however, if Potter was within earshot, he’d scowl at the person, who would shut up immediately. Draco never figured out if he should be relieved or annoyed at this). His pride, ripped into shreds, was a bitter pill to swallow as he served them their lunch (and sometimes dinner), but it was the most mortifying whenever he saw Potter and Weasley. The delight on Weasley’s face, the pity and embarrassment on Potter’s…
They have no way of predicting the future, no way of knowing what horrors lay lurking in wait for them.
The two identical cupboards at the right side of the Room intrigue Harry. He walks towards them, Malfoy behind him. Harry opens one. He steps back in astonishment at the wide selection of silk blindfolds, handcuffs, Slytherin ties, leather restraints, and Merlin, is that a… a paddle?
Draco doesn’t know what to say to that, so he gives him a watery smile. He thinks of Potter’s Magpies tattoo, and he’s suddenly consumed with the urge to know about his story — the Academy, to pro Quidditch, and finally, to this surreal day of them sitting together, naked, in the prefects’ bathroom in Hogwarts. So, he asks Potter about it.
. Draco’s flat in New York will be ready in a few days, and it was generous of his paper to temporarily put him up in this posh hotel. Tomorrow he will reconnect with a few contacts over meals, but tonight, he's alone.
"You're even fitter now," Malfoy murmurs, resting both hands on Harry's shoulders and squeezing. Harry grins and flexes his biceps, an invitation for Malfoy to feel him up, and he does so rather enthusiastically. "Arse," Malfoy says, his cheeks going pink with pleasure when Harry rubs his hands up and down Malfoy's sides.
"I'll miss you so much," Hermione says, her face crumpling in sorrow and her words dissolving into tears. She lunges towards him and pulls him into a hug. He wraps his arms around her at once, inhaling the minty scent of her shampoo and the feel of her curls against his cheek. Behind her, Ron nods at him.
Draco holds his breath, his wand pointed at Charlie, every nerve ending standing at attention as grey eyes dart between Charlie and the beast. When its long snout twitches, its mouth opening, a defensive spell is already on Draco's lips, halted only when Charlie throws his hand up at Draco—
"Fuck!" he exclaims, pulling out and squeezing his prick, his breaths hot and heavy. "Was gonna come. Not yet." He closes his eyes briefly, waiting for the jagged edge of his impending orgasm to fade.
hours ago, but how much time does Draco need? Harry doesn't think he can stand it anymore, he's never understood how Draco does it — bottling it up, sweeping it under the rug until it explodes in both of their faces. Harry doesn't know if he’ll make things worse or better, all he knows is that he has to do something,
wild — then his hand, with his fingers pointing southward, is ghosting down his abdomen... his abs... going down even more, tips of his fingers resting on the waistband of his thong.
Draco lifts up his head to glare at him, but shrugs on the blue shirt. He gets out of bed and finishes dressing. He looks at his reflection in the mirror and smiles at the memory of that night in the courtyard. Satisfied with his appearance, Draco waves to Greg and makes his way to the almost-empty common room, just in time to see Pansy lean forward, fix Potter with a hard stare and ask him, "Do you have dishonourable intentions towards Draco?"
"C'mon, Malfoy. Fuck me, I want it so bad," he begs. "I'll fuck you some other day, but right now, right here, I want you in me so bad. Wanna come all over again with your cock up my arse." He turns his head, his chin resting on his right shoulder as he shoots Draco a gaze so sexually potent and smoulderingly hot that Draco aches to please him in any way possible.
Malfoy nods. "Stay there. Wanna memorise how you feel. So thick, so full…" He closes his eyes, savouring the moment. Harry pulls out an inch and thrusts back into him, eliciting a moan from Malfoy, whose cock begins to fill. "So good. Fuck, Harry, so good."
Harry looked over the two who were still whispering, before Malfoy sat back up, grabbing his wine glass and slowly raised it with a smile on his face.
"Yes. I would like that." Harry smiled, reaching out his hand across the table for Malfoy to shake. "Hello, I'm Harry James Potter."
Valentine's Day that year actually fell on a weekday so all the festivities would happen during school, which harry was glad for. His heart swelled anytime one of his students would bring him sweets. He also passed some out to all of them like he does every year to make sure no one ever went home empty-handed. Overall, he definitely grew to like the holiday more and more each year.
Harry listened as Malfoy talked passionately about what he loved to do and Malfoy listened to him talking about his job, asking questions about Teddy, obviously wanting to get to know his little cousin more.
Potter nodded, already halfway through taking off his wetsuit. "Yeah, everything went great. You, Draco?"
Harry's hands reached down Malfoys body and Malfoy let out a strangled groan as firm hands wrapped his hand around his cock.
Harry hummed and continued to lick. "You taste delicious," He blew on the skin before kissing it. "Can't wait to get inside you."
On Monday afternoon, Harry walked inside the coffee shop with a smile on his face. He waved to Mimi and ordered his coffee while asking her about her weekend. She told him about the weekend she spent studying for midterms and Harry listened with a smile, wishing he himself had gone to muggle Uni at one point.
"Let's do it," The two hugged and cried and kissed and spent the entire night curled up in their bed reminiscing their Hogwarts days and their new prospective futures.
"Just go enjoy some coffee. I'll give you another cup on the house, Drake. Go sit, talk, discuss your plans for the weekend," Mimi smiled grinned, trying her best to appear innocent.
"We're here?" He asked. The cat titled her head and Harry looked at the door, noticing another piece of paper attached to it.
There was definitely magic between the two of them. Harry heard Draco sigh a happy sigh as he cupped the back of Harry's head with his own hand, deepening the kiss.
Harry was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that he was being set up with Draco sodding Malfoy.
"Well thanks for the coffee Mimi," Malfoy paid for his coffee and smiled at the barista behind the counter before turning to Harry. He stared at Harry for a while, making him slightly uncomfortable under his intense long gaze. "Potter," He nodded before walking off.
"Come on, clean up time," Harry smiled at his godson who groaned but started cleaning up the small mess they made. The paper Harry wanted to pick up manually to help Teddy get in the habit of cleaning up after himself while he couldn't use magic, but the glitter will definitely have to be magically cleaned.
"She's seen some families but none of them have ever gone ahead with the paperwork. You've met her, she scares them away but they just need to be patient with her," There was a pause. "She keeps thinking her mother will be out of prison soon and they'll be a big happy family but she's in there for fifteen to life. Ellie just doesn't understand and I don't know if I have the heart to make her understand."
Six years later, Harry felt pressure from everyone in Ginny's family to propose. He did, she said yes, they married a year later only to divorce after just three short months.
That's when he heard it. or him. A voice Harry could never and could never forget no matter how hard he tried to. A voice that terrorized him for most of his adolescent years.
Mimi grinned, taking the bag from Harry and rummaged through it. "Harry if I didn't have a girlfriend and you weren't crushing on Drake, I'd kiss you right now."
Harry was speechless, to say the least. He hadn't seen the man in over eight years, not since his trial where Harry testified and later shook his hands thanking him after he was pardoned. The last he heard, Malfoy had left the country. And here he was in the same resort as Harry.
He then floo called the Weasley household. Hermione answered and Harry heard the shrill cry of his one-year-old goddaughter in the background. Harry offered to come over to help but Hermione said she was just teething. The two talked and Ron eventually joined after he put Rose to bed.
"He has our gear. He's going to explain everything once we get there but we're getting our tanks ready first, then change into our wetsuits on the boat on our way to the diving spot." Draco simply nodded, reflecting on how relatively nice it was being around him when they weren't trying to bite each other's heads off.
"I'm asking you to marry me," Draco said softly, leaving forward to kiss Harry's cheeks before bring up his thumb to wipe away the tears.
Harry gasped when the door opened in front of him. It was definitely just as luxurious as it looked in the brochure.
The brochure Hermione gave him was on the coffee table covered in stains from the scones he had for breakfast and didn't bother cleaning it up. He lived alone and he was prepared to make the best of it. Starting with a two-week vacation to Hawaii.
He made his way towards the table, smiling when Malfoy noticed him walking towards them. The group was sitting on the opposite side of where they sat down a few nights ago.
"Happy Valentine's Day, Mr Potter," Harry looked up from the stack of papers he was in the middle of grading and smiled at the little girl standing in front of him. She had a small pink bag in her hand, her face red as a tomato as she handed the bag to him.
He smiled all night and each time they were directed towards Draco, his knees went weak under the table.
After his calls, Harry headed down the corridor leading to his bedroom, picking up spare toys he found on the ground and smiling fondly at them before opening the door to Teddy's bedroom and putting them away.
They slowly approached the dive platform on the boat and looked at each other. Potter gave him a small nod and a smile before looking back into the water.
"No. You will have a hearty meal complete with vegetables. You're grounded so no dessert," Malfoy said, taking a sip of the water a different waiter had just put in front of them.
Nervous for what? He wasn't sure. He wasn't sure if he was nervous to meet up with Potter or the fact that he willingly agreed to go explore the ocean.
The cat seemed to understand and made her way down the small corridor leading to the two bedrooms in the house. They passed several pictures on the wall. Most of them were of Teddy. Some of Harry and his friends at Hogwarts and from a few years ago. He smiled at the new additions to the wall, several pictures of him and his boyfriend. Everything else in the hallway looked normal.
"Of course," Luna beamed, ruffling the boy's green hair as they part, making him giggle. Teddy then walks over to Ginny and gave her a hug.
Draco rubbed the side of his head, the place where she Margot him still stinging a little, "Nothing happened. We just made plans to go scuba diving today."
"Did you do that?" Harry laughed because of course, Draco would be playing Queen to celebrate their engagement.
Malfoy got up and pulled out the chair between him and a beautiful brown-skinned woman. Sitting next to her was a woman with bright red hair who Harry assumed was her fiance. And Ellie sat between her and Malfoy
He felt giddy as they reached his bedroom, thinking that whatever the surprise was would be in there. His heart started beating faster when Olive stopped and looked up at him.
"Thanks, babe," Margot said, reaching forward to place a kiss on her fiance's cheek. "Now. Tell me what happened last night Ellie," Draco was about to interrupt when Margot gave him a look that shut him up.
Harry beamed at the name. He reached forward for Draco's hands, pulling the two up from the ground. Their chests touched as the soft tune of I was Born To Love You by Queen played in the record player in their room.
This continued for the rest of the week and by the fourth note, Harry concluded that the notes were left there for him, raising the question of who exactly was leaving them. Harry hasn't dated anyone since whatever he had with Ginny Weasley about eight years ago during his seventh year at Hogwarts. Since then, they've both come to terms with their sexualities. With Ginny being a lesbian and happily engaged to Luna Lovegood and Harry being bisexual but by himself.
"Are you all ready to order?" she smiled, flipping the notepad in her hand and scribbling something down while she waited for them to place their order.
By the time he woke up, it was pitch black outside. He checked the alarm clock on the nightstand and it read 7:28 pm. He essentially missed an entire day of fun on the island but decided he still had time for dinner. Harry lowly cursed at the crick in his neck and made his way out of bed.
They laughed, Malfoy nudged his side gently and their arms rubbed together raising goosebumps on Harry's side.
Harry smiled. "It would be my pleasure. Thank you for the invite." He gave each a kiss on the cheek before bidding them good night.
"No, not at all." Harry quickly answered, "They're basically harmless. I'd just like to know who's leaving them."
Harry grabbed the base of his prick with his right hand, spreading Malfoy's cheeks with the other. He felt the blond jolt at the movement. Malfoy's face rested against the cold tile and Harry was glad they moved away from the water spray. He wondered if Malfoy's has done this before but decided that this was no time to ask such a question.
"Yes," The boy grinned a toothless grin. Harry rolled his eyes fondly and kissed him on the forehead before telling him to go find one of Luna and Ginny's many animals to play with.
The three made their way inside the restaurant, Harry walking in front of Malfoy and behind the waiter who led them to a round table at the back of the restaurant near the bar.
His outfit was much like Harry's. Instead of blue jeans, he wore black faded ones, with a white sweater and a coat on top of it.
Harry's eyes widen. No way was Mimi trying to set him up with Draco Malfoy of all people. He was the blond Mimi told him about the week before. Malfoy was gay? "You're gay?" The words rushed out before Harry could stop himself and immediately regretted it afterwards.
His platinum blonde hair reached past shoulders but it was fuller than his father's had been and curlier. His eyes were still that beautiful grey but they looked more full of life. His perfectly small nose had a red tint to it, no doubt from the cold outside. And his lips -- Merlin, his lips. Harry had never wanted to kiss a pair of lips so much.
"We're here!" Lionel shouted over the loud roar of the boat motor before turning it off. "You boys ready?"
Harry chuckled, "I'm afraid there's not much dirt. He was a little shit, and I assumed he never grew out of it?" The entire table erupted in laughter, even Malfoy, and Harry felt a little better.
He was wearing a white short-sleeved button-up with a dark blue sweater vest and matching blue shorts.
"I am," he chuckled, ignoring Malfoy's smirk next to him. "It's so nice that you guys are getting married. I didn't think it was legal yet."
"Aloha, Mr. Potter," A nice lady in a floral dress greeted him as soon as the elevator doors opened, and put a lei around his neck. Harry thanked her and bumped into another woman, who handed him a blue drink.
"Hello, Olive," He picked up the small kitten and kissed her fur gently. "Hello, sweetheart. Where's Daddy?" The cat meowed in return.
"Hey, Drake!" Mimi chirped while Harry was picking his scarf up from the counter to make his way towards his usual table. Harry cursed under his breath but turned around nonetheless. Standing in front of him was once again Draco Malfoy.
Harry's brows furrowed in both curiosity and confusion. He looked down to find the small cat staring up at him, her eyes just as wide as his. "What's your Daddy up to huh?" Olive meowed, making Harry laugh. "Well, lead the way, little miss."
Thank you so so much to @sugarquill88 for helping me with this story. You're the best mwah. I hope you guys enjoy this short little Valentine fic.
Malfoy's eyebrow shot up, his lips twisting into a smirk, "I didn't realize you owned the state of Hawaii, Potter."
He looked around the restaurant for a while longer, almost taking a mental picture. He'd never experienced anything like this before. Even though he spent a good part of his life living among muggles, he still found it enthralling how different they lived from wizards.
He opened the window to sleep that night, the music and activity from outside reaching his room. He didn't fall asleep until three in the morning, heavily engrossed in some American crime show playing on the TV.
"Mione, you're six months pregnant. You did not have to come help me pack and make me lunch," Harry said, taking a seat at the installed island in the middle of the kitchen. Hermione's pregnant form walked towards him and set the bread on the table next to a spread that looked like it could feed an army.
Harry pumped against him, feeling the muscles around him clench and loosen as he fucked him with everything in him. He moved his hands around Draco's chest, finding one of his nipples and squeezing it.
Harry thrust faster as he chased his own orgasm. "Do it. Come inside me." Draco commanded in an urgent and who was Harry to deny him that. It was more than Harry could handle and with one final thrust, he felt himself spurting deep inside Draco at the same time he heard him shrieking in pleasure, coming against the bathroom tile.
Valentine's Day was that Sunday and everyone at the school would be exchanging gifts Friday the 12th instead. Harry had Teddy come over to help him make his cards and take him shopping for muggle sweets.
The two sat in comfortable silence, staring at the clear water in front of them. Draco started to feel the afternoon chill on his shirtless body and involuntarily shivered.
Margot was very friendly and Harry could see that Jane wasn't quite chatty but she always jumped in the conversation whenever she could. But she mostly sat back in her chair and listened to her fiance interrogate Harry, a fond look on her face that Harry could only describe as love.
When his best friends told him that their wedding would be held in Hawaii, he was over the moon that they actually picked his suggestion.
"I would appreciate that, thank you," Harry smiled as the man closed the book in front of him, disappearing inside the restaurant. He didn't ask Harry to follow him so he stood outside awkwardly, his glass now half empty as he leaned on the wall, closing his eyes and inhaling the fresh ocean air.
Making a mental note to call Hermione later that night to tell her he arrived, Harry took that much anticipated and needed nap.
"Harry," Draco whispered and that's all it took for the tears to start spoiling. "Oh love, please don't cry."
People walking alongside the water, some hand in hand, some with families and others alone. There was a seating area near the pool, an outdoor bar, and what looked like a restaurant. Harry took a sip of his drink and decided he couldn't finish the drink without at least eating something.
Ron would no doubt tell Hermione and Hermione would tell Ginny who would, of course, tell Luna meaning the entire Wizarding World knew at that point. Harry smiled at the thought, resting his head on Draco's chest as the chorus of the song started playing.
Draco felt a smack upside his head and winced. He looked up and saw Margot sitting back down, resting her hands under her chin.
Harry was fully aware of what happened the last time Malfoy offered his hands to him. He pushes the memory in the back of his mind, still slightly disappointed at his younger self for being so rude to Malfoy. But they weren't eleven anymore. They were adults and Harry had a crush on him. A crush he was sure that Malfoy returned.
The walk felt like a hike but eventually, they were near the water. Harry stopped for a second taking off his shoe and watched Malfoy do the same, he held them with one hand and the two continued walking along the beach.
Malfoy went back to his food, taking a fork full of vegetables, and answered before putting it in his mouth. "The prophet. Went to visit Mother at the manor and saw it lying on the kitchen table."
Harry wasn't blind. He wasnt blind, so he noticed things. During his fourth year, he noticed Cedric Diggory. He noticed his bright grey eyes and how full of life they were. He noticed his hair and noticed how much hands itched for just a touch. He noticed his long slim legs in his quidditch pants.
The restaurant was lively. That was the only word Harry could think to describe it as he took a seat on a yellow chair. The tables were sound and each of them was filled with grinning people deep in conservation with whomever they were dining with.
"It was actually Ginny's idea to get a divorce. If she hadn't said anything I wouldn't have and we probably would've been forty by the time we realized that it's not what any of us ever wanted."
He took a seat on a small white couch, rubbing his hands on the black shorts he decided to wear that day. He was the only person in the room, apart from the receptionist.
There he was, Draco Malfoy in a muggle coffee shop. Harry's muggle coffee shop. No Harry didn't own the place, but he was there every weekday for about an hour for the past four months and not once had he seen Draco Malfoy come in. Harry would've definitely remembered seeing the face of his old school nemesis in his favourite place.
"No, I don't. And it's okay because I don't really need one," Harry tried his best to explain to the seven-year-old why he was happily single.
Narcissa became well two months ago but she was still very weak. Draco decided it would be best to move Narcissa in with her sister. Once she moved in with Andromeda, Draco was all alone in the manor. The memories of Voldemort living there and killing innocent people in his very home became too much for Draco. He decided to sell the manor and for the time being, he was living in the inn at The Leaky Cauldron.
About two months ago Ginny came home and Harry was crying in the study. She assumed he was upset because he missed Sirius, so she went to comfort him. Then she noticed he wasn't looking at Sirius's burnt out photo and name on the Black family tree, but at Draco's. She was quite confused at this point but didn't want to push Harry into sharing anything since he was already hurting.
Curiously enough, he didn’t feel nervous at all. The conversation he’d had with Sirius had somehow also been like a simultaneous conversation with himself and now Harry was convinced that, in spite of the result, he was doing the right thing.
When Malfoy opened his eyes, Harry could see that they were holding back tears. He laid them on his and asked, “Are you planning on keeping it?”
“But you don’t have to.” Hermione had that look on her face that could only mean she was about to say something brilliant and wise. It was
“I’m sure Healer Sallow is remarkable at his job.” He turned to address the other man sincerely. He was looking extremely uncomfortable and desperate to abandon the little assembly in which he was so obviously not required. “But from what I’ve heard,
Harry didn’t say anything, willing himself not to cry so soon in their conversation. Thank Merlin his stubbornness had gotten the best of him.
After another quick glance at Hermione, he spoke the words before he could have time to back out. “This
He spent the next hour talking to some of his friends and former classmates about life post-Voldemort and answering questions about his well-being. He even stumbled upon two or three individuals whom he apparently knew, but didn’t have the heart to ask to remind him of their names. He’d ask Ginny about it later.
He turned around to find the extended hand of the newly appointed Healer-in-Charge; a man Harry had met before and who always had a fake smile for the people he knew he could somehow benefit from, and a sneer for those who didn’t represent any usefulness to him.
"Anything’s fine," Harry said, his voice muffled by the table underneath his face while quiet, relaxing music filled the room at a low volume.
Draco listened attentively as Lionel explained the process. He helped each of them with their tanks to ensure proper functions.
"I love you," Draco whispered in between kisses. Harry's face was red and puffy, salty tears showered his cheek and no doubt his lips but Draco didn't seem to care as their lips moved together, tasting each other. The feeling so family yet new and exciting every time.
Harry set the book down, making sure to mark his page. He knew Ellie would probably keep talking to him and he wasn't going to refuse the girl polite conversation.
"I can see that," Mimi said. "You sure you don't wanna sit a while longer and have coffee with Harry? He's all alone"
Harry ate dinner alone in his hotel room that night. At first, he felt bad about wasting his vacation days to room service inside alone when it was such a nice day to eat outside or go to a nice little restaurant. But Hermione called him so he decided to order in and stay in his room to talk to her instead.
Harry loved it. He relished in the fact that he the one was making Draco feel this good. Harry was close so he reached around and replaced Draco's hands with his own as he pumped Draco's cock himself, milking it.
"So are you going to tell us about this mystery man?" Ginny crossed her arms, her brown eyes narrowed and piercing into Harry's green ones.
He quickly spotted Malfoy the second he walked in. His hair wasn't in the signature bun, but laying flawlessly on his shoulders, swaying slightly while he laughed at whatever the four were talking about.
Harry took in the man before him. Malfoy still carried himself like the proper prince he was. But now with more confidence than arrogance. His face was spotless, free of acne and any scars, unlike Harry's. His hair framed his face perfectly and Harry smiled at the way he was constantly moving and or two away from his face.
That would be a good idea except Harry goes every day after work. Mimi herself said she would keep a lookout but the girl did have a job to do. Harry doubted she would be able to see what everyone inside the shop was doing at a certain time.
He glanced up at the boy in front of him, Draco looked thoroughly fucked and Harry's spent cock twitched at the sight. He reached up and captured Draco's lips in a kiss and moaned when their tongues made contact.
He passed the picture to Potter. The man smiled at the picture before declaring that he should take one of Draco too.
Harry laughed, ignoring the part about him crushing on Malfoy. He took off his scarf and leaned on the counter waiting for Mimi to finish his order. "You flatter me."
On the eight note Harry received, it was hinted that his admirer might not be a muggle after all and Harry finally decided to go to Hermione for help.
"Harry!" She smiled. "Hi love, come sit," She patted the spot on the couch next to him and Harry happily obliged, taking his goddaughter from her mother. "What brings you here?"
Draco pecked his lips one more time before taking the ring out of the box and sliding it in Harry's ring finger. The beautiful silver band was decorated with two bright diamonds. On the same hand just one finger over was the beautiful stone ring Draco gifted him on their very first Valentine's Day together.
"Yes! Yes yes yes!" Harry sank to the floor before Draco could get up, he tackled the man in a hug before cupping his face and slamming their lips together. "Yes," Harry sobbed, pulling Draco closer.
An hour later, everything was in place and Lionel started driving the boat while he told the two to put their wetsuits on over their swim shorts.
He went to bed that night thinking about how and why Malfoy was so bloody gorgeous and secretly hoping it was him leaving the notes on his coffee table every day.
After finding the sixth note, he decided to finally ask Mimi if she's seen anyone weird lurking around his table. After drinking his coffee and getting a few chapters into his most recent book, he made his way towards the counter, smiling at Mimi.
"Lay back down for me," He said, not bothering to look at Potter. He took the time to study the small camera, eventually figuring out how to use it.
The park was really nice -- well kept but not crowded. Harry smiled as he walked alongside Draco and pondered whether or not to take the man's hand in his. Their fingers were brushing past each other as they walked. The whole scene was so cliche and Harry held his breath, reaching out and intertwining their hands.
"He quite likes being alone," Malfoy repeated to Mimi. He didn't look like he wanted to be in this situation no more than Harry did.
He pumped hard as he thrust in and out of him, biting his neck and his back and anywhere he can get his lips and teeth on. "I'm close," Harry moaned.
"You're welcome," She giggled before turning around and running out of his classroom, her pigtails bouncing in every direction.
Stepping inside, Harry was immediately engulfed in the scent of baby powder and lavender. The lavender was a gift from Luna to their entire friend group, claiming that they all needed some harmony in their lives, and apparently, that's what the lavender was for.
"I am a child," Ellie huffed and crossed her arms across her chest as the first waitress came back to the table.
Malfoy smirked and pulled Harry back up, kissing him hard. "Be my guest," He whispered against Harry's lips, "I prepped earlier but you're welcomed to check."
And Draco did. The piece of fruit sliding into his mouth, Potter's finger slightly grazing his bottom lip leaving an almost tingling feeling. Draco didn't even register the fact that the fruit was now inside his mouth and that Potter was in fact right, it did taste amazing.
"Malfoy," Harry whispered once again, pushing his glasses further up the bridge of his nose. "I'm sorry, I wasn't looking."
He looked around the room, taking in the white simple interior. He heard a low instrumental coming from the speakers attached to the wall. It was soothing.
Potter threw his head back in laughter. Draco watched his chest move up and down and his arms flex as they leaned back on the boat supporting the rest of his body. Why was he so fit?
He stopped counting the number of times she's tried to set him up on a date and the number of times he's refused. Her intentions were always in the right place so sometimes Harry even indulged her and tried to hear about the people she wants to set him with.
"It's a pleasure to meet you guys," Harry finally took a seat, scooting the chair a little and cringed when he heard the legs squeak. "Hey Ellie," he smiled at the little girl sitting next to Malfoy before whispering "hi" to Malfoy himself.
"F-fuck," gasped Malfoy as he struggled to hold himself up. Harry's reaches around him and grabbed his stomach holding him up.
"Oh!" Potter exclaimed, shuffling to sit back up before reaching for his bag. "I actually do. Mione gave it to me to take pictures."
When he had heard about his divorce to the Weasley girl, he told himself he couldn't care less what the Wizarding World's golden boy was up to, but now, after seeing him, a small part of him secretly hoped Harry was queer.
"Thank you, Haku," Harry suddenly remembered what Hermione said about tipping the hotel staff and reached in his pocket pulling out the muggle cash he had converted from galleons and handed a twenty to the man.
"Is someone in here?" Harry asked, clutching his wand in his wand to prepare himself for whatever was making that noise.
Eventually, the subject changed, much to Draco's appreciation, and they started talking about their rehearsal dinner.
The pool itself was filled with people -- mostly screaming children. But most of the chairs were empty. Harry found one on the side, in the shade, and laid on top of it while swapping his regular glasses for sunglasses.
This was his routine, dull, mundane life. He loved it relatively alone and he was pleased with it. but at night, he almost wished he had someone to come to bed to, a body to keep him warm.
"Teddy no!" Harry yelled while being chased by an overenergetic seven-year-old with a bottle of magical glitter in his hand.
Several days after Voldemort’s defeat, Harry had been having breakfast along with the group of people that were helping with the castle’s reconstruction. Every single person Harry loved and cared about was there; but there was a horrid atmosphere of grief and sorrow. Ginny had then stood up from her seat and returned minutes later carrying a small camera she’d found inside one of the classrooms. She’d delivered a small speech about how life goes on and how they should focus on enjoying it and the people who were still there, on behalf of those who weren’t. Touched by her words, everyone gathered for a photo to commemorate the moment.
She nodded as if what she had just said made complete sense. “Remember what I told you about our things coming back to us?”
He was now currently leaning against the ornamented banister that had a perfect view of the front door, opting to stay there so he wouldn’t have to be moving from one place to the other to greet the guests and accept their congratulations.
Harry climbed the stairs one by one until he reached the top floor. He had adopted his godfather’s room as his own since the day he decided to move there and hadn’t dare to move one single thing, wanting to keep everything as close as possible to what had been Sirius’ bedroom.
Two weeks after Harry and Hermione’s deep talk found the three of them, plus Ginny, amongst dusty boxes, magically-extended trunks, and just piles and piles of all kinds of ancient things. Harry’s friends had offered to stay with him for a few days and help him tidy everything up.
“Oh, that won’t be necessary,” Harry said, but the man had already begun approaching them after hearing his name being called out.
It was nice to have them there, though. And also extremely convenient. For some reason, he’d been feeling absolutely exhausted for the past few weeks; never in a million years would he had been able to do it all on his own.
“Well, if it has it must be because it’s got something to do for you. Something important.” She blinked adorably and, against Harry’s better judgement, he let himself think about her words. “Besides, I can’t think of a better person to keep it safe.”
His godfather looked bemused. “For having fallen in love?” Harry blushed deeply, so Sirius tried to lighten the mood. “I can’t really blame you; the boy is quite handsome.”
Malfoy looked up at him, silently asking the million questions that he couldn’t voice at the moment. Harry managed to understand and answer all of them with a simple nod.
“The ‘I don’t know what to do’ game,” Sirius clarified. “You resist to acknowledge the fact that you’ve always known.”
“Yes, it was… interesting.” Hermione wasn’t paying much attention to her boyfriend, though; her knowing stare focused intently on Harry. “Ron, dear… Would you mind getting me another cone? I’m not really in the mood for mint, after all.”
House of Black...” He regarded him lovingly. “You’re the best thing that’s happened to my lineage in generations.”
He let himself play with the piece of metal for a few minutes. He liked that piece of metal; he liked it
He turned the Stone once in his hand and thought about his smile; twice and he recalled the way his hugs felt. Harry turned it one last time and focused on Sirius’ voice…
When the room came back into focus, the first thing he saw were three pairs of extremely concerned eyes. But in all honesty, Harry felt okay, albeit just a little woozy.
He seemed so fragile like that… Enclosed and suffocated by the walls he had built up himself and all the unsaid words he kept insisting on swallowing.
“Yes, you are!” They locked eyes and he could see that the blond really felt that way. “Because you love to sabotage yourself… And I’m terrible at protecting the people I care about.”
He opened his eyes to find the shade of his godfather smiling warmly at him. As real and unreal as it had been during that night at the Forbidden Forest.
“Here.” Harry looked up from where he had been rummaging through some drawers and was met with a steaming cup of tea that Hermione was offering him. “How are you feeling?”
“I just know I already love this baby with my whole heart, Ron. If I have to do it on my own, I will.”
“Yes, Hermione. I’m not into forty-something-year-old men, if that’s what you’re wondering.” Harry still resented Lucius Malfoy, there was no hiding that.
Earlier that day, he had woken up to one of the worst waves of nausea he had ever felt and had consequently woken up the other three teenagers on his way to the restroom to throw up. That had marked day number five.
The word “disappointed” came to his mind, but he refused to hold that thought. Even if that was the case, Harry was feeling miserable enough as it was. And there was no use tormenting himself over something he would never get to ascertain. Not when he could torment himself over the very tangible reality that was currently nestled within him.
Harry hadn’t thought of that before. The baby was actually related to Sirius. The realisation only made him love them more.
Sirius broke it with a gentle laugh. “Who would have thought? You’re technically carrying the rightful heir of the House of Black. The
Harry had taken a glance and felt like crying when he saw all the effort his friend had put into organising all that just for him.
“I’m sorry.” He truly was sorry, but he was also incredibly relieved. However, this was just one less obstacle; and Harry had two more to go through with Ron that day. “There’s more to it, though.”
“I don’t know, mate, this has been going on for far more time than it should be… Maybe we should consider going to St. Mungo’s.” And Harry didn’t fail to notice the way Ron had used the word “we” instead of “you”. He truly did have a family now; what would Harry do without them?
When she moved to give Ron space, Harry was sure he was about to get punched; or at least yelled at. But all the redhead did was take him into his arms. “I’m so sorry I overreacted.” He let go of him only to look into his eyes and tell him with absolute genuineness, “You’re my brother. And you can fucking bet I will love any child of yours just as much as I love you.”
“Remember all the vomiting and dizzy spells?” They nodded. “Well, I did go to St. Mungo’s a few days ago…”
He’d already finished skimming through one of the worn-out issues of Witch Weekly when the door creaked open and the person he’d been dying to see walked in, looking all professional in his lime green uniform.
Hermione’s eyes were incredibly soft when she spoke. “It is. But it’s a good kind of different, isn’t it?” Her face dropped a little. “I mean, I’m sure Mr. Fortescue would be pleased to know that his shop is still up and running.”
