“Are you going to say anything to the headmaster? Perhaps he could find a way to let you stay at Hogwarts during the summer.” Harry thought back to the last time he had talked to Dumbledore and shook his head.
But they were only kids, for crying out loud. There wasn't any hate based off of fact. It was just a childhood argument that lasted for the better part of five years. It was always stupid things that they hated each other for. Harry hadn't decided to get to know him better and Draco had hated him because he hadn't gotten what he wanted. It was foolish, really.
He had noticed that not only had the boy been getting thinner, but he hadn't been getting very much sleep. His eyes slowly started losing what little light they had to begin with. His hair lost its luster. His skin, albeit tan, was almost sallow-looking. He looked sickly.
"Harry, you need to do something about it. You can't just live your life alone."
"Lesson learned." And that was the last thing he'd say consciously for quite some time.
Draco welcomed him with his arms and wings open. They both encased Harry in a blanket of warmth. He pulled Harry back to the bed and they went to sleep encased in each other’s arms and wings.
"What do you say to finding a way to thank our dear old Severus?"
Harry’s breath caught in his throat, the loneliness suddenly backing away much more than before. It was still there, a very apparent ache. But that was less than the heart ripping pain he had endured earlier. He got off the bed and rushed towards Draco.
“He doesn’t? I don’t like being concerned about my friends but that’s because I don’t like knowing they were in danger or injured. Is it that he doesn’t like it when you’re hurt or he doesn’t like being concerned for you when you are?” Harry shrugged.
Or maybe they wouldn't.
"Draco?" The pained look went away as quickly as it came.
When they arrived back at the castle, Draco needing to levitate Harry there as he was too relaxed to walk, the two boys noticed that there wasn't anyone around. Wondering what could have possibly driven everyone away from the Great Hall, they made their way towards all of the tables that usually held the dinner.
‘Mum’s gotten into a few arguments with me lately. I think she’s under the impression that I’m lonely and that I’ll never be bonded-or even married-to anyone if I keep going the way I am. Personally, I think she’s off her rocker. I’ve still got time to find someone to fall in love with; after all, it’s not like I’m going to keel over.
Turns out Dudley’s idea of a breakfast in bed involved Harry filling every spare centimeter of his bed in plates of breakfast foods. He was unceremoniously kicked out when he delivered the last plate and was immediately accosted by his aunt to clean the kitchen from cabinets to floor to be followed by pruning the roses. After that he was sure she’d give him a million more chores.
“Do people really have that much to agree upon?”
“Thank you Professor, for being so accommodating.”
Harry had just gotten about halfway through his plate when he went to sip from a glass of orange juice when Draco started talking.
They barely had time to regain their footing when they returned home before Draco was snapping out orders.
"Now, this is an extremely complicated potion, even for me. Everything must be done exactly as the instructions say, or we could all be severely injured. Got it?" The two nodded, pleased that they could be trusted with such a complex thing. "Today, Harry I want you to show Draco some of the things I've shown you over the summer. He's very good at this, rather like you, so don't worry about him not understanding. He will, he's brighter than he lets on." Severus gave them a book and a page number before walking back to his desk to start correcting the summer homework from the first class-an attempt to get it out of the way before he had a splitting headache from the first years.
"Harry..." The blond walked to the bed where Harry was sitting and pulled him up and out to the living room. He sat him down on one side of the rather large window seat, he on the other, and took Harry's hand. "Look, I can tell you're probably worried about me saying no. And just to let you know...I would be too. But if I wasn't going to say yes, I would have given the necklace back to you. It's a family treasure to you, I couldn't take that away from you without giving you something in return." Not believing what his ears were telling his brain, Harry looked at the blond disbelievingly.
He didn’t know which route would be harder for him to handle.
Damion led the two men towards the back rooms that Draco had rented for the year. He was suddenly very happy that he had felt the need to spend the money to book the back for an entire twelve months over the summer. He could practically feel Harry's curiosity pouring off of him in waves. They passed by several doors, all of them leading into different rooms specifically designed for specific tasks. Shane motioned for the others to walk in while he held the door open for them.
"Of course." He was taken aback. Why wouldn't he be happy? He was having a baby and living with one of the hottest men alive. "Why do you ask?"
He stopped when he heard a thud and bolted upright. Who could possibly have gotten into the Manor? He walked over to the French glass doors and saw the brunet passed out on the floor.
“Prat. Enjoy your time away from schoolwork.” Harry even had the cheek to wink at him, something that did funny things to his insides.
"You startled me." A sparkle in the light brought his sight to Draco's neck, and his breath was taken away by the sight Draco made in the necklace. He was gorgeous. Absolutely nothing could compare to it, and only after he got over his mild shock at the beautiful display before him did he notice that Draco wearing it must have meant he accepted. Right?
At three in the morning, Harry woke with Draco lightly shaking his shoulder and him screaming his throat raw. He wondered what questions he'd have to answer, and was surprised to find that Draco didn't ask questions. He thanked him and they went back to sleep, both knowing that the other was hiding major things from the other. Harry knew he'd have to come out with his entire story to Draco sooner or later, and Draco to him with his. He just didn't know when, and he was afraid it would be the next day.
“Thank you Draco.” He pulled away and hugged the bear to his chest before laughing.
"Well yeah...he's a great friend..." He could tell that he didn't give the right answer. "Did I miss something?"
“Wow,” Harry breathed. Mr. Malfoy smiled.
"You'll be okay. No one knows you here. You're someone that they'll want to please because you're a paying customer not because you're Harry Potter. That and because you're with me-I'm rather well-known here. I'm infamous for plaguing the place during the holidays and weekends." He watched as Harry nodded slightly and pulled him out from the alley and onto a very clean sidewalk that wound its way throughout the town.
Oftentimes, their mate either isn’t of age, or is another creature who hasn’t gone through the complete inheritance change yet. The latter is most common, as bonds with underage wizards, witches and creatures will still form. There is only one case in which a mate bond didn’t form due to being underage…’
The next few weeks he spent going to Severus and asking him for advice on what to do about it and the teacher had given him the best idea ever. A secret admirer!
He found a compartment with one first year on it, and he jerked his thumb behind him. She scrambled to get up and he nodded after levitating her trunk down and into the hallway. Someone else could play the good student card. But not him. He was done helping others unless it helped him in the long run.
He spent an hour or so scouring his personal library, trying to find the book he had on mates and their bonds. When he finally found it, he cracked it open to the page he needed and started reading.
“Such a pretty hole you have.” He inserted a finger, joined quickly by another and worked the flesh until it was considerably looser than it had been. He slicked up the bottle and lined it up, loving the way Harry sounded when he was breathless and begging. Harry was more than ready, the rosebud of flesh twitching in an attempt to be filled quicker.
There was one shirt in particular that Harry had seemed to take an immense liking to and had bought on impulse. He had gotten a medium, much too large for him and Draco had questioned him on it.
“I was wondering if Hogwarts had a program similar to the one over the holidays.” She looked surprised at the question, but answered nonetheless.
Not at all.
“Oh is he? Well I hope whatever is on his mind isn’t too much of a bother for him. Come, are you joining me for tea?” Draco nodded and she transfigured his outfit to match hers. He smiled and sat down on the sofa with her before they tucked into their cups.
"Well, do you plan on staying with us?" He nodded. "Then you march your arse right back in there and fill out a resignation form for me."
"I am going to keep that a secret. And it'll seem foolish at first, but trust me. You'll feel absolutely wonderful afterwards."
Harry leaned into his embrace, clutching at his shirt for dear life.
He was amazed that Draco said yes.
The two avoided talking about the contracts, determined to simply enjoy each other’s company. Draco took pleasure in spoiling Harry rotten with surprise packages of sweets and small trinkets while Harry learned to accept them.
By the time they were done with the debriefing, it was dark out. They left, and Harry told him that he would meet him at Malfoy Manor.
“No, I didn’t know…”
Harry ducked as flashes of light flew around him, too shocked to get up. After a few moments, his body detached from his mind and sprang up, ready to cast as many spells as he could.
“And what are those reasons?” Harry sat up and smiled at the blond.
“Yes?” His voice was just as soft now, barely a breath against his hair.
“Why do you stay, Draco? I know how you used to loathe him...how adament you were about him not staying with us.”
Being that Draco wanted to think on what had just happened, he rushed into his room and shut the door quietly before casting a silencing charm. He then proceeded to jump up and down like a little schoolgirl.
Classes were to start on Monday, and they had arrived at the castle on Thursday. The two spent most of their time together, just talking and enjoying each other’s company. The rest of the school was giddy with excitement at having the two of them there, and they had plenty of people vying to get their questions answered when they showed up to meals.
He’d made sure he was safely ensconced in his bed before Ron came up for the night each day and was proud to say that his wards around the bed worked rather well, if the loud complaint was to be believed when Dean touched the curtain.
He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but he was so relaxed that he didn’t even flinch when fingertips stroked through his hair, In fact, he smiled and leaned into it a bit.
"I...Draco you...oh bugger. Look, lay down. You'll stress yourself more if you don't." He laid down. "Okay here's the thing..." And so the truth came out. When Harry was done explaining, he looked up from his shoes, which had become objects of extreme interest during his explanation. He did a double take on the current bedridden man.
He reveled in finding out more about the man.
A few hours later, Draco decided to turn in for the night. However, Harry wouldn't let him as he had been ill earlier. He decided to stay for the night instead, although it wasn't exactly his decision. It was more of Harry telling him he was to stay here for the night.
It was almost the end of the year when Harry snuck out of the common room and went to find Professor McGonagall. She didn’t check in on the Gryffindors as much as Harry had thought she would, but she made sure each and every one of them knew where her office was and that they could come to her any time day or night if they ever needed her.
They paused outside the Quidditch shop, glanced at each other and decided to go in. Neither one of them really wanted a new broom, but new gloves were always a must. Harry would go through five pairs of gloves just during the training alone, and inevitable would end up ruining another several pairs throughout the year just blowing off steam. The shopkeeper suggested that he invest in a nice pair of dragonhide gloves to prevent wear and tear. Draco happened to overhear their conversation and politely disengaged Harry from the conversation. They went to look at the other end of the shop while Draco explained the interruption.
"I...I want to see where this can take us. I think that we could make this work even if it's not the best circumstance. Can we just...Let things play out? I mean, after can we just be friends? And then let it go from there? Even if we don’t end up a couple, I don’t want anyone to grow up feeling like they missed out on a part of their life." Draco nodded enthusiastically.
Draco just laid there, running his fingers through Harry's hair until he saw the tear fall. He wasn't expecting that, but what really caught him off guard was that once one fell many more fell in quick succession, seeming to fly down his face.
So he did what he did every other night he couldn't sleep. He walked out to the library and sat down right in front of the portrait of Sirius. He opened his mouth to talk, but no sound came out when the picture put a finger to his lips and pointed behind him. Harry looked.
Draco Malfoy.
"You embody what is important to me. Strength. Courage. Hope. Determination. Seeking help when you need it and not letting pride get in your way. Self-preservation. You have everything that I wish I could have learned when I was younger. Because if I had learned it when you did, the way you did...I never would have gotten involved with everything that I did get involved in." Draco looked down in shame, worried that the one person he had hoped to call a friend had just been pushed away by his open honesty.
"Ah Mr. Malfoy. I've been awaiting your arrival in the atrium, I guess we just missed each other." Draco was caught. He had to go through with this now. And he wasn't sure he wanted to do it anymore. He could feel his heart beating fast and hard inside his ribcage and he wondered briefly if he'd pass out.
“That’s why it was so big to begin with, I think. Back when it was built it was common for people to travel to balls and huge parties but no one wants to aparate drunk for fear of flinching and hangover potions hadn’t been perfected yet so they only worked with a small portion of the population. Therefore, everyone would stay at wherever the ball was and aparate home in the morning. I like it though, I’ve got plenty of privacy away from my parents when I wish for it.”
“You’re right. But would it help you if I told you I think you’ve got a bit of an infatuation with Harry?” Draco sputtered as she smirked at him over her teacup.
Harry’s head spun and he swallowed before putting his head down.
Harry couldn’t help but think that this would be his best summer ever.
“That’s Lavande. She owns this place. She just wanted to offer her personal congratulations at finding you. If there’s one thing about Lavende, it’s that she loves seeing her favorites come here with a partner.” They looked through the menus, Draco describing everything to Harry, and the waiter suddenly appeared for their orders once they had decided.
"Draco? You're staring."
He saw Pansy Parkinson. She was standing by him and glaring at everyone talking about the two men.
Curious, Draco grabbed the box his mother had left and opened it. A blush swiftly covered most of his face as the realization that his mother had gotten all this for them.
‘Dear Harry,
"You sure you want to do this?" Draco took his hand in both of his and kissed it before giving his answer.
Draco stumbled out of the fireplace, his cheeks reflecting the color of the flames around him. Note to self: don't floo anywhere when you're already nauseated.
He should ask about that later.
Harry hadn’t expected Narcissa to come knocking on their door, nor did he expect her to barge right in past her son when he opened the door to start tossing clothes on Harry.
“I went and bought a reasonably priced bottle to drink, but I may have tried a sip of the one you opened just before you left instead.”
“I don’t see why, though. Sure I can master spells and stuff a little faster than some other students here, but I’m complete rubbish at other things.” He took a long drought from his goblet of pumpkin juice.
“I see now this is important to you, although I cannot imagine why. I want to be here, to support you Mother. You’ve done so well with helping me through...well everything this last year. And especially my changing. I just want to assist you. And I tire of fighting with everyone. With my friends about what classes are rubbish, with others about things they cannot control...with Harry. Really, was I so childish that I decided to hate him because he didn’t want to be my friend straight away? It’s just so foolish. I don’t want to waste my time on any of that. And so here I stay.”
"So, you had a sister?" Draco ignored the question and looked around. They had landed in a forest, full of trees and lots of cover.
She ushered him into the room they’d been keeping him in before Vernon and Dudley pounded their way downstairs to eat breakfast and Harry vaguely wondered if they would leave any sort of food for him to eat while they were away.
“His wand is a hand me down?” Draco’s sharp tone snapped him to attention and he turned back to the blond.
“Harry?” he called softly. His feet whispered across the floor in his haste to give the boy some sort of comfort. He felt, rather than saw, the wings stiffen at his approach. “Oh Harry.” He dropped to his knees beside him and gathered him in his arms softly, careful not to touch his wings too much. He knew just how sensitive they could be, especially when emotions run high, and he didn’t want to cause more harm.
Draco’s face flushed bright red, giving him away immediately.
The effect was more powerful than Harry remembered. Draco’s wings were snow white with metallic gold speckling them and a few sky blue ones here and there. The silver glow around him remained, although it wasn’t blinding this time. Upon closer inspection, his eyes weren’t just mercury. They had small pools of the bright sky blue floating around, almost dancing around in his irises.
“We all just want to be like we were. Friendly with one another. I knew we were on opposing side of the war, your mother and I. And we still owled each other when we could. She was so happy to have you in her life, you’ve no idea. Sometimes I really thought she was happier to have you than your father. Her and I were so excited to have our children only a few months apart, we had so many plans for after the war. Lucius was not a member of the inner circle back then, you see. He was doing the bare minimum to make sure his family didn’t get hurt. And when I read in the paper what had happened...needless to say I was heartbroken. I devoted every waking moment I had mourning my best friend for the first year of Draco’s life.” She looked down at her tea, took a deep breath to steady herself and continued.
He greedily drank the potion and swallowed, not even caring that it tasted like dung. The sweet sensation of his throat healing as the liquid coursed through his throat was heavenly.
They soon reached the hall only to find it jam packed with people, all intent on getting to some notice or another. They silently assumed it was for the next Hogsmeade trip as most of the students looked to be about third years and up. Draco gently but firmly led Harry out the massive doors, his arm still wrapped firmly around the other's waist, and out of the school grounds where he took his hand and apparated them to an alley in a muggle city.
"Harry, don't give me that look. Say something, it's scaring me."
That was a hard question for Harry in some aspects and not in others. On the one hand, he absolutely didn’t want his spouse to cheat on him but on the other hand he didn’t want to be tied to having a specific amount of children or have a requirement on how often they’d have sex. When he voiced his concerns about it all, she put her quill down.
Testing:
“How dare you? After all the things I’ve done to watch your back? I’ve done so much for you and you’re just going to piss all over that? What the fuck gives you the right to take my loyalty and not give any in return? Huh? Are you going to answer me, or not?” Harry shivered in fear, but desperately tried to stand his ground.
“Oh, is that the pulling sensation I get every now and again when you’re across the hall?” Draco nodded, happy that he had caught on so quickly. “So how can we strengthen it? Before you leave, I mean.”
A few hours later, they sat on cushions Draco conjured in front of the fire.
“You’ll let me stay. I’m your only friend, aren’t I?” Ice and dread spread through Harry like the plague.
Harry opened his eyes to look up at him, and Draco’s breath caught. While Harry’s eyes were bright during the day, when he just woke up they were dark green and threatened to drown him in their depths.
“I...well, I guess I trust you and Hermione.” Draco gave him an odd look at that.
“I think the answer is obvious, my angel.” He essentuated his words by carefully placing Harry down on the bed under him and crawling over him. He pressed gentle kisses up his stomach, leaving Harry’s skin covered in goosebumps.
“It’s quite stunning, isn’t it? My family has worked very hard to ensure the manor is well kept throughout the generations.” Harry saw the door open as they walked and suddenly he was plowed over by Draco.
He went back to the bed and gingerly sat on the side of it, fidgeting with the last letter he hadn’t sent off with the owl. What was the point, if it was meant for the man that was right next to him?
“When you’re dealing with family wealth the size of the Potter and Malfoy accounts then it’s typically recommended that each is kept separate and managed by accountants. You’ll be expected to review the financial reports but most only check quarterly and yearly. Lucius checks his every quarter but Draco’s been telling him for years it would make more sense to review them monthly. Less work if you do them monthly. I think he just was upset that accounting days took up all of his attention and didn’t leave any time for him to play with Draco.”
“You gave us all quite a scare, Harry.” He jerked with confusion. He knew that voice, but there’s no way Draco Malfoy, of all people, was talking to him so normally. “Shh, relax.” A hand rested on his chest, trying to keep him from moving too suddenly. “You were unconscious for a week. And since you had, indeed, gotten an inheritance, we couldn’t give you any potions. We had to just watch and wait for you to come back to us. But it’s all right, there should be a healer coming in any moment now.”
"Keep going, I can see the head!" That spurred a bought of pushing Harry had thought Draco incapable of up until this point, and he watched in amazement as Draco screamed his discomfort and pain to the world. As he heard a sharp cry from the other side of the room, Draco continued to scream. Harry was completely confused as to why he was screaming still, and looked at a Healer next to him in askance.
"Please...Do something. Anything. Just don't tease me like this." Harry realized that the man actually wanted this, actually wanted him and wasn't doing this all for the baby inside him. Harry smiled and took pity on him.
He was beaming at his mother, and suddenly felt a slight tug inside him. He turned to face the manor, still radiating joy. His father was in the window of his study, waving and smiling with pride.
“Mother, I think we both know where it’s pulling me.” She waved him away and resumed her tea.
The two grew closer as time passed, mostly with Harry putting aside some of Ron’s more obnoxious traits. He loved talking about quidditch with someone that actually had a deeper interest with it rather than a superficial enjoyment of watching a game or two and that alone was worth ignoring Ron’s degrading comments and occasional joke that took it just a bit too far.
The jingle of the little bell greeted them, and Madam Malkin herself walked out of the back room to greet them. She had hired help over the years, one such girl was currently fitting a young first year.
"You're not just talking about the baby are you?"
"But I would have if I was in your position. Would I have actually done it? I guess we'll never know. But I would have considered it seriously, for sure."
“Wait!” She paused. “I want it in there somewhere that under no circumstances are any possible children to be punished physically, by food or water being withheld or by being stowed away in small spaces for misbehaving.” She gave him an odd look but nonetheless wrote it in with the word ‘nonnegotiable’ next to it to drive the point home. She’d done that with the fidelity clause as well.
I suppose that since you're a pureblood, you understand what giving another such an expensive and precious gift means.
“Oi-Harry! Blimey mate, where’ve you been all summer?” Harry turned to see Ron and Hermione running towards him. Smiling, he hugged Hermione and nodded at Ron. His stomach twisted with dread for when they realized who he was with.
It wasn’t until Halloween that anything out of the ordinary happened. Hermione had asked Harry to go study with her for ancient runes, a tradition the two had come up with to distract Harry from what day it was. Ron had interjected before Harry had an opportunity to say anything.
It must have been charmed, as it was cold when it touched him but quickly warmed much too quickly to be normal lubricant. It sent shivers down his spine.
"Draco!" Rushing to the blond's side, he cast a few diagnostic spells. When they all came back black with a crimson edge, Harry paled. He packed everything by a wave of his wand, not caring if their things got mixed up.
Draco was lying on the bed reading a book Harry had conjured while he was waiting and had never finished.
"Or what?"
When they got to Hogwarts, Ron told him about the different houses and although Ron made a point to downplay Slytherin as much as he could, Harry couldn’t help but think that they wouldn’t be that bad if Voldemort hadn’t been in Slytherin.
He collapsed on his bed, the shock leaving as quickly as it came and rendering his body a shaking mass of sobs and terror.
“What a right state mum was in. Do you know about Harry Potter starting school this year? It’s all in the papers, of course.”
"So Draco. You went through all that pain, so what do you want to name them?"
"Shrunk it and added a band. Easier than lugging a bag. Now seriously, one bag only. And it must be smaller than your forearm before shrinking it."
He wondered about who Draco would want to be the second father, who he would trust enough not to leave him and the baby, whom he clearly adored even though he could die because of it. Obviously he never pegged him as a father type of guy, but after seeing the look on his face at the mere prospect at having a child would be enough for even Tom Riddle to admit he was wrong. Appearances went a really long way with the Malfoy family then.
He didn’t respond, but Draco took that as a good thing. He hadn’t fought back on it.
He moved in between Harry’s legs, spreading them wider while he moved his fingers within the tight canal that was soon to be stuffed full of him. He gently pulled the fingers away, leaving Harry’s hole open and ready. Upon the sight, Draco moaned and placed the head of his member in. Harry closed around it, clearly expecting more and disappointed at having to wait.
Harry noticed his discomfort and turned around. When they were about two hundred yards away from the back door, they slowed to a walk.
It wasn’t until something warm and wet licked his member from base to tip and he keened when that delicious sensation moved to his sack before his dick truly got to appreciate it.
Once he realized this, his body started struggling in panic. He knew in his mind that he was only making things worse for himself, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop his legs from attempting to fight back. He felt the large hand make contact with his face.
“Narcissa?”
He forced his mind to shut down; he knew what he had to do and he knew what needed to be done to get him there. It wouldn't be easy, but he'd do the best he could. After all, he'd lied before to save others from knowing the horrors he had to live through. What was the difference, really? This was just one more lie to cover up what he knew the general populace couldn't handle.
The morning before he had been eating breakfast. So where was he now?
“And now they're trying to recruit more followers. They want to make your father the next leader. So we have to stop them. Naturally, I got a hint of suspicion when they both disappeared at the same exact time. I did a little research and came up with a few files of evidence. I gave Kingsley the file six months after I started.
"Sirius?" Harry spoke in a voice so quiet he wondered how Sirius had even heard him.
“Yes, but Gone With the Wind? Seriously? I never thought you’d read anything written by a muggle but especially not that one!” He downright loathed that he could feel his cheeks grow hotter.
“I was reading one day and he asked me what it was about. Since I had just started, I went back and started reading out loud as a joke but he said he was interested in hearing the rest only a few paragraphs in.” He shrugged. “I simply obliged him and it became a part of our routine.”
“I think that’s enough for one day, dear. Come back down tomorrow for tea and we’ll pick up where we left off. We’ll be covering properties and household management next!” Harry nodded and slowly made his way back upstairs. He couldn’t get one particular thought out of his head.
"And your is just as silent as mine is vocal." Draco shrugged and conjured a tent while Harry set up many extremely complicated wards and continued to talk to the picture in a muted voice. Oddly enough, the picture was being just as quiet. Well, until Potter apparently said something to tick him off.
"It's fine. I just wasn't sure if you were aware you were staring." He sat up and walked to the kitchen to get a glass of water.
“I don’t know, but I should at least give him the option, shouldn’t I?”
He flung binding curses at the two traitors, and heard two distinct thuds. His anger covered any surprise at catching them that fast and effortlessly. His footsteps fell slowly, distinctly, and he saw their eyes widen.
“But that’s exactly it Harry!” Hermione’s voice rose with excitement. “You’re magic has been getting stronger. When you perform more complicated spells, the air around you practically cracks with how badly it wants to be let out. And simpler spells are becoming harder for you to control. Go ahead, try to make that goblet float.” He did, and the goblet soared much higher than Harry intended for it to go. It returned slowly, after Harry had reigned in his magic a little. “See? That’s your magic trying to burst out. I would be incredibly surprised if you don’t have an inheritance coming.” Harry’s eyes widened. Has this been why everyone was avoiding making him upset lately? He had pushed it off as the news spreading more rumors about him and stress.
She left them to their own devices for the rest of the train ride.
"I don't...Why are you telling me this? All I'm going to do is hinder you from finding someone you really do care about." He thought he saw a hurt look flash through his eyes, but he was probably mistaken. Malfoys were prided on having no emotions. But, then again, he had been wrong about that earlier, hadn't he?
Draco hadn't planned on Harry giving him such a long explanation. It was rather sudden and unexpected, especially since in all the time that Draco had known the boy he hadn't been one for long speeches. Rather, he was a man of very few words.
He sped up when he heard a small rustle. It had sounded like someone shifting when they were upset. Small, fast movements, almost to the point of being jerky. He paused at the door to the tent and looked back at the pictures of Sirius and Elizabeth. Two complete opposites, yet Harry suspected that if they weren't cousins they would have made a great pair.
Eventually Harry was large enough to fit into the shirt-if he tied it behind his back and tucked the tail underneath, of which he was immensely proud of. Draco smiled at his antics when he first saw what Harry had done to make the shirt fit him.
“For the things Ron does. And says.” Harry looked into his lap, his hands twisting together nervously. “I don’t like the way he treats you. It’s not like you start any of it.” Shame curled up from his stomach, making him feel quite warm in his cheeks.
Walking through the bathroom to Harry's room, he wondered if his classmate had managed to get dressed for bed or if he'd have to do it for him. He was slightly relieved and a bit disappointed that he didn't need to help the other into his pajamas.
But...hadn't he caught himself admiring the way his muscles strained when he was doing push ups? Hadn't he thought on more than one occasion that Draco Malfoy was maybe, just maybe, sexy?
“We’ll talk about that later. For now, let’s finish on the subject of marriage contracts.” She cleared her throat and started moving parchments around to show him a few sample contracts. “Now once the courting period is through, you revisit the marriage contract. Both parties will have a copy to edit as they see fit and then you’ll both meet with whomever is representing you. A mutual friend of both parties is also there to act as mediator and to create a version with all the edits and compromises. Once that’s done, you all reconvene to go over the final edits again and make minor adjustments as you see fit. And this can happen as many times as necessary-your father’s and mine took nearly seven meetings to finally hash out all the nitpicky bits.”
“What about Weasley? Don’t you trust him?” Harry looked down and shrugged.
"All the same classes." He handed it back and Harry pocketed it before getting up. The three of them practically ran to potions, Pansy panting and clutching a stitch in her side. She wasn't used to running like the men were.
"Shortly thereafter, I got some of the most wonderful news. I was pregnant. And a few weeks later, when I tripped over that blasted umbrella holder, I miscarried. I lost everything that was dear to me within the span of two months-besides you of course."
Consequently, as soon as he looked at the picture, he almost dropped it.
Grasping the pendant around his neck, he tried feel their bond. Draco might not be able to feel him from this far away, but he was going to spend as much time as possible trying to send him warmth and comfort through it.
It was a piece of artwork that had to have been the finest goblins had to offer. When he looked up at Harry, he tried telling him it was beautiful, wonderful, that he loved it and that it was too much all at the same time.
Silence was the only thing he could make out when he tried listening through the door. Slightly panicking, he turned in frantic circles looking for his wand until he realized the bathroom was silenced. He suppose that made sense, as it was a hospital. Patients wanted privacy and the Healers would be damned if their patients couldn't take a shower without everyone knowing that.
On the right was their bathroom. Large blocks of white marble lined all the walls, continuing into the walk in shower. The shower alone was the size of the bathroom Harry had used at the Dursley’s.
“Narcissa, I know your motherly instincts are coming out to play, but if you could just listen to reason-”
"Draco?" He looked up, curious as to what he had to say. "Do you want to go to dinner tomorrow?" Clearly taken aback, he quickly agreed and a smile graced his lips.
“Mother! You’re supposed to help!”
"Yes."
"What?"
“I used to have one when I was little. You spin it around your finger when you’re nervous and it warms or cools depending on when would work best to help you focus. And it disappears when it touches your skin so no one will know you have it on.” Harry smiled at him and Draco handed him the last present. It was relatively large compared to the others, about the size of Harry’s torso, and prompted him to open that one too.
The next month went rather like the date containing their first courting kiss.
"Harry bloody Potter, if you do not simply take the chance on this one then I swear I will burst forth from this blasted canvas and castrate you myself!" Harry, eyes wide with fear, nodded quickly. He knew his godfather only wanted the best for him and he knew that he would do anything to please him unless it put his life in danger. Maybe...maybe it was worth a try, to go after someone that he actually liked. And maybe hatred could be traded for passion someday.
"He's...oh there's no point arguing with you. You'll win anyways." She giggled.
Draco set him down, and Harry dragged him through the doorway to see what was in that direction.
“And with what the Minister has been saying about me being dangerous I’m sure that won’t work.”
When he realized that that's all he wanted. He wanted a husband that would care for him and cherish him. He wanted a child that would send him letters from the other side of the house with their new owl they picked out for their birthday. He wanted a happy life, not one filled with fighting.
“Well, I can’t tell about your body now can I? You’re wearing rags at best, and you were starved for a few months. You probably won’t know about that until you start eating and rebuilding your strength again.” He took a deep breath. “Your eyes...your eyes changed a lot though.” Harry scoffed.
Draco opened the gift, much more carefully than he wanted to, and hesitated when he revealed a flat, rectangular, velvet box. He looked up into the eyes of the father of the life growing in him and gathered all the courage he had just to open the unoffending thing.
"I just...I guessed I just wondered what you planned on doing now. Where you planned to stay and if you even planned on dating although I don't know why I bothered asking. You have huge mansions across the globe and you never did seem like the type of person to trust someone enough to be in a relationship with them. It was just a stupid question, forget it." Draco thought for a moment.
"I'm sorry, I'm being terribly rude. But my day has been pushing my patience to its end. Please don't think I'm like this every day. You can sit down if you'd like. Just throw the file down where you find room." He waved around indicating to the many chairs filled with stacks of similar files. He felt the other side of the couch tentatively lower as his companion sat down cautiously.
“I’m sorry.” Draco looked up, confusion evident on his face.
"Yes." No doubt could be heard in his simple answer. He was going to do this and he was sure about his choice. He knew what he wanted from life.
Try as hard as he might, Harry simply couldn’t remember a time when Ron had been as good of a friend to him as he had been to Ron. Sure, Ron had talked trash with him about the Dursleys, but how much of that was being a good friend and how much was simply rolling along with it because it was convenient?
“I’ll get the healer straight away.” She sighed a breath of relief. “I’m so glad you’re awake Harry.” With that, she turned and closed the door softly behind her. The moment of peace let Harry wonder why his hand was still being held, and he had the answer shortly.
"Mr. Potter, can I help you?" His lazy drawl was slightly strained, as if in anticipation. Which, Harry knew it was, but no one else knew that.
About an hour later, Harry started feeling a dull aching through their bond. He remembered wondering if that was the separation that was causing the ache, or Draco. Pushing the feeling aside, he tried to focus on his potions essay that was due. It was the last piece of homework that he had left, as soon as he was done with it he could relax.
"And then, all too soon, he went out to spy for Dumbledore...he promised he would come back. He never did.
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I have." Harry cocked his head to the side in curiosity, not unsimilar to a bird listening for worms and bugs in the ground. "I believe that a friend of mine can help." Harry watched Draco carefully, analyzing his every emotion and movement, hoping that it would give him a clue as to who he was talking about. He finally gave in, silently admitting that he hadn't the foggiest clue who that person could be.
"Interesting. I used to watch you watch me so that doesn't really surprise me. What surprises me is that you're the only one who could deduce that." Draco felt proud of himself that he could figure out the one thing that no one else could. He shrugged. After all, he had done the same thing. Doing things with mental detatchment came easy to him, after all he was a Malfoy.
"I...sorry, you were just really peaceful like that." Harry watched as Draco blushed and smiled.
"If you don't take the time to go over there and make up with that boy, so help me I will come back to life and castrate you!"
“Have you given any thought as to who would represent him? He is a Potter, after all. That is a pureblood line, he’ll need someone to teach him how to care for his estate and fortune.”
The rest of the school year proved to be uneventful. Harry managed to keep his distance from Ron, more so than he had thought he’d ever want prior to the holiday break, and spent more time with Draco in the Room of Requirement. They mostly studied, occasionally played exploding snap or chess and often they found themselves just enjoying each other’s company. It was strange, in the beginning. Harry hadn’t ever really been around anyone other than Hermione that was okay with silence. Everyone else seemed to be agitated when they were quiet and that usually meant Harry needed to diffuse the situation by trying to change the topic or by staying overly upbeat about something ridiculous. Bringing up the latest gossip floating around the school seemed to help as well, and had even resorted to making things up just to keep Ron entertained.
“I used these,” he handed Draco a pair of nipple clamps which Draco quickly decided needed to be adoring Harry’s chest. “And then I used this,” Harry was breathless now as he handed Draco a vial of minty lube. Draco didn’t use this on Harry very often, it was something that he reserved for easier nights when Harry had been especially good. “And when I finally felt like I was stretched enough I used these.” Harry gestured to the two dildos on the floor. They were both smaller than Draco, but combined they would have been a little bit larger than him and the one doubled as a vibrator.
"I'm making an apple dessert dish, would you like any?" Draco nodded.
His mum met them at the station and the three flooed from the Leaky Cauldron. Harry told Draco to spend some time with his parents while Harry started in on the essay he had planned on finishing the night before but never got to.
As Harry was laying in the warm embrace that eased his hurting, he thought about Draco revealing himself as a veela. He couldn’t remember much about it, only the brilliant silver glow that surrounded him and his eyes. He couldn’t remember what his wings looked like.
He ran into Ron and Hermione and gave them both hugs. He was so rushed that he hardly got out where he was going and wishes for them to have a good holiday.
He was truly worried that no one would buy his made up story. He was afraid that someone would question it and come up with something much closer to the truth. He already knew that's what Severus and Draco had done. They just didn't ask about it-yet.
“Draco?” Narcissa slowly creaked the door open and poked her head in. The two were still under Harry’s wings, but she could see they were much more relaxed now than they were before. Draco poked his head up through the feathers.
“No,” the younger boy answered cheerfully. “I’m supposed to tell Ron where you went so he can find you. He’s been looking for you, you know.” Harry felt a flash of panic but managed to push it down.
He only had a few more days before school started and then he’d be able to talk to her to his heart’s content.
‘I truly don’t want to be a bother. I can stay here by myself, it’s not like much will have changed. Do your parents even know you offered to let me come stay?
He couldn’t believe what he saw in the mirror. He really had wings. Large, billowy, soft wings. He vaguely wondered if they worked or if they were just for decoration. Reaching next to him and grabbing onto the chair, he slumped over. He really had bloody wings. He looked so different, yet so similar to what he had before his birthday. He stumbled to the bed and sat down in the middle of it, staring off into his own little world where his reflection was everywhere around him. He was flabbergasted.
“I’d say that amount is worth the danger. It’s a lot of bloody money, isn’t it? I’d walk through a maze for it, that much is obvious.” Normally, Harry would simply charm his curtains shut to block out their noise so he could get some shut eye, but they’d started this conversation on a Friday night when he didn’t need to get up early the next morning, thereby rendering his usual excuses for class the next day useless.
“Mr. Weasley, I presume you are aware that all guests must have their invitations on their person?” Ron gave him the same spiel he had just given Harry. “Perhaps you have forgotten to whom I am married. I happen to have the entire guest list memorized because of Narcissa’s obsessive planning and I know for a fact that you were not on that list. Now remove yourself from my property or I will have you arrested for trespassing.” Ron paled and left quickly, but the damage had already been done.
“It does sound peaceful. But what about friends? Company must be fleeting, at best. You wouldn’t have any relationships that mean anything. And talking helps people learn, helps them heal and let’s face it; it feels pretty damn good to complain about things every now and again. And love; you’d never find love if you were a snowflake. You’d never be around anyone long enough to develop that sense of trust-”
He took that as a very good sign.
Harry made the trek down to dinner, hoping his friends would make him feel better. Hermione had saved him a seat and invited him to sit next to her. The plate was already heaping with some of his favorites and his goblet was practically spilling over with pumpkin juice.
“Now board the train and mind your manners. I’ll see you back at the school Mr. Potter.” He nodded and made his way to an empty compartment.
“Did you mean to get one the same colour as your hair?” Draco blushed. He had indeed sought out the one that best matched his hair colour but he refused to admit it. “It’s too bad it doesn’t smell like you.”
They didn’t know how long they sat there, tied up in each other’s embrace. Both were benefiting from the prolonged contact, experiencing the loneliness subside a little. It was like this that Lucius found them, holding each other under Harry’s vibrant wings. Lucius softly closed the door, letting them be.
“Oh please, don’t be so dramatic. Here, get dressed so we can go to sleep.” Draco tossed Harry some silk pajamas and Harry cleared his throat.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t have any issue studying with anyone.”
The four of them apparated to platform 9 ¾ and they said their goodbyes to Narcissa and Lucius. They were both wiping tears off their faces as the train pulled away from the platform.
As they neared the section he had used his full authority on, he began to notice that butterflies weren't only just flying from flower to flower, but also in his stomach. He swallowed and took a deep breath while Draco openly cooed at the different flowers and plants. By the time he saw the daisy archway, the butterflies had evolved into giants, wreaking havoc on his nerves. Another deep breath, and they walked under the arch.
Draco sat up and took Harry's hands in his own, looking down at them.
“That’s a bit complex, don’t you think?”
"What?"
Draco dropped the paper. Rita Skeeter? The crazy old bat that made things up and twisted everything that people said? She couldn't be serious. Like Harry would want an interview with her.
"Oh really?" Draco noticed the slight edge to her voice. "And exactly how did he behave?" She turned slowly, giving her brother a look that could only be described as the stink eye.
Reuniting:
He set a plate down in front of him with slightly more than he'd seen the boy eat so far and waited patiently until Harry opened his eyes. When he did, Draco looked pointedly at the food in front of him and got to work on what was left.
And on Christmas Eve, the two went to the Room of Requirement to find the same cozy room that had been there before but this time it was decked out with a large tree near the side of the fireplace. Baubles were sparkling, but not necessarily in an annoying way. The couch was large and plush with the table full of special holiday treats to munch upon.
‘I appreciate the offer to send things I need-which mostly consists of anything edible that can be kept at room temperature. Aunt Petunia has decided she doesn’t want her curtains closed when I’m home for the summer and she simply cannot stand the idea that a neighbor might spot me with the family so I’m not allowed out of my room.
Ulysses had a difficult time getting into the room, seeing as the bars on the window were barely large enough for him to fit. Harry had to stick his arm out, let him perch on his forearm and then gently pull the owl in. The reverse had to happen for him to leave as well, but it comforted Harry knowing that the owl would have to wait for him to write out a response to Draco.
"YEAH YOU CONNIVING BITCH! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU FINISHED ME OFF, MAKING IT TEN TIMES HARDER FOR ME TO MEDDLE IN MY GODSON'S LIFE! WHY, MY OWN MOTHER-" and so the picture ranted for another minute or two.
“Oh, hi Harry! I heard you were getting married and figured my invite got lost in the post so here I am!”
"Yes, and I rather like everything where it is thank you very much."
“She’ll need to see your wings, Harry. She’s fitted me robes for mine and I couldn’t have asked for a better fit. Just imagine them stretching out from your back and reappearing by your sides.” He did just that, and suddenly they were there. He smiled his thanks to the blond.
“I want to do right by Harry and court him.” He started screaming at himself, wondering why in the bloody fuck he thought he could resist telling his mother anything when she gave him that particular look. It made his insides twist to know he was hiding something from her.
Harry marched forward, recognizing that the only way to get these men to stop was to physically enter their personal wards and manage to tie them up separately. Then someone else could deal with them and Harry could get back to trying to control his thoughts. He shoved the men back and managed to get all but two tied and sent to the Head of the Department. The remaining two were ex-partners of Harry.
He found that he didn’t mind it as much when Draco told him what a good boy he was for keeping it all in overnight.
Harry was struck dumb. Draco, Draco Malfoy, his partner, Draco Malfoy, was pregnant. Pregnant and dying.
To this day, Draco has been known to walk into another room that needed more cleaning, only to find a small gift and a charm next to it for his bracelet. Those days they took for themselves.
"Harry...please what's wrong with me, really?"
He rather liked his head on his shoulders.
"Hey! Careful there, dropping your cousin isn't exactly the smartest idea!"
"Okay." With that, Harry took his hand and he felt the familiar pull of apparition.
“N-no, I just...well I grew up in the magical world and you didn’t. I just thought that maybe you wouldn’t know all the types of magical creatures that walk the earth yet, especially since dark angels are so incredibly rare. I didn’t mean to offend you…” His voice got quieter with each sentence until he just gave up on arguing.
"So, anyways, here's a file on your next case and I need this to be copied and sent to the Unspeakables ASAP, you got that?" Harry nodded, clearly not pleased that the newbie's work came before his own, and more importantly, not paying attention. And then something sank in. The newbie, THE NEWBIE, of the department was telling him, HIM, HARRY FUCKING POTTER, what to do.
“I’m ready. I don’t want to be, but I have to be if we’re ever going to get past this.” Draco packed while Harry stopped him every so often to plant gentle kisses on his face. When he had a few outfits stashed away in an overnight bag, he turned around and held the man against his chest.
"Harry, I must stop you. Firstly, you've done nothing but talk about Draco for the past five minutes and secondly you can't stop complimenting him. What's going on there?" To Harry's great embarrassment, he blushed.
“Luke, you really don’t think…”
It had been four months since Harry had opened up to Draco. Three months of the relentless puking and odd cravings and slight mood swings. And as far as he knew, cravings weren't supposed to start until the fourth or fifth month. He was just overworking his mind.
“No,” Harry’s voice was barely a whisper now. He felt small and exposed; vulnerable, and he didn’t like it. Powerlessness bothered him, but he felt compelled to answer Draco honestly. “No, he started complaining about his school robes. About his second-hand books, nevermind that they look just like the books you get for new and hold the same information, and his wand. It’s a hand me down as well apparently.”
But eventually Draco did come and find him, if the presence next to him meant anything. He looked up, his face only inches from Draco's.
During dinner Hedwig glided down towards Harry. She was carrying a rather large package. He gave her a large chunk of his meatloaf and opened the package.
"Oh dear Godric, you didn't?"
When Harry's body was so exhausted it stopped letting him sob while the tears slowed, he felt a slight movement on the bed. He looked up and saw what he thought he'd never see again.
And, after all, Draco was a Malfoy. They always made sure they were right in the end. And he was certain he'd never have to kill Harry Potter.
"No, I won't. You get ten months of pay for sitting on your behind and shopping. And if you go back you only have to do a desk job and you pick your hours as long as you hit thirty hours for every week. It's easier this way. So you get ten months off with pay and then work one month behind a desk and take a two year leave-of-absence with pay. Then you can quit."
"Yes. Me." She left shortly afterward. Harry sat and held onto Draco's hand. He wished the man were awake, but he knew he'd have awhile before hearing his voice or seeing his eyes again.
The interview consisted of five questions: his testing scores, his current residence, what hours he was willing to work, if he wanted field or desk work, and if he was willing to put his life on the line. He answered all of them in a dull monotone and bounced his foot repetitively on the floor to get rid of his extra energy. In actuality he kept waiting for the questions about why he wanted a job or why he would need one. He had prepared for those, but he kept fearing he would be asked about his father and other things such as why would someone want to hire the child of a scumbag that betrayed the Ministry before. He didn't want to answer them but he had expected them; it was surprising to him that they didn't ask those questions
“You called for me, Professor?” Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, just a few steps inside the room. There had to be a good reason to pull him out of potions, Snape was going to have his head for the urgency in which Dumbledore had requested his presence. And to send Dobby, of all the house elves...Snape had fire in his eyes as he told Harry to get lost.
Harry pulled him closer. In fact, he had been thinking about that exact thing earlier in the day. His overactive imagination had helped him find a plausible solution. “Draco darling, I wouldn’t mind you doing anything you want to me and then riding you in order to get to your neck a little easier. Actually, it sounds kind of fun.” He pressed their foreheads together and sent the entire scenario that was in his head to Draco. They both moaned as Draco begged for him to bite his neck and their lips crashed together as waves of desire swept over them.
‘Harry’
Narcissa walked in carrying a tray full of tea, crumpets and vials filled with potions.
Draco kissed him.
Harry felt like he was swimming in a very dark pool. Memories swirled around him. He was looking in on snippets of his own life. The last run-in he had with Malfoy. Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes. The last feast of the year at Hogwarts. Having to say goodbye to his friends. Dudley beating him up, over and over again. His uncle slamming the door open-
The next several years went by with nothing too exciting. Harry had started to eat normal portions at every meal and was starting to get a healthy glow into his skin now. Mind you, he was still pale, just not sickly so. Draco had learned to get along with the muggle world (mainly due to Harry's obsession with their shopping centres-which Draco had to admit that he liked quite a bit) and Severus spent the better part of a day attempting to give the two of them the silent treatment for pulling a prank on him.
Draco seemed completely oblivious to Harry, and just stared at the wall vacantly.
"Draco, I haven't left this chair since I got here." He looked up with bright green eyes, misted over with unshed tears. They pierced holes into Draco's soul, burning the pain and relief into his mind forever. In that moment, Draco felt like he was just permanently branded.
That was only accentuated by the sudden proximity of the brunet, and his eyes widened. The other man stayed like that, considering what to do, savoring the moment. Draco just wanted him to let the Gryffindor side out, but unfortunately, before he did, a Healer walked in.
Draco cared for the brunet-that's why nothing really ever came out of their fights in school except a few detentions. And the thing with the dementors? He did that because he thought Harry had been exaggerating with his Patronus abilities. He was a child and children don't think about the consequences. But he'd just been so good at getting under Draco's skin.
"Just keep doing what you've been doing." They were all bustling around and suddenly another Healer told him that if he wasn't going to tell his husband to push, then he might as well leave. He did as they said, completely bewildered.
"That doesn't look like it'll blow over." The front cover. He was on the front cover. With Harry Potter. This couldn't be good.
"Oh. I'm...sorry I didn't know. Had I known...I wouldn't have made fun of you for having no parents." Draco aimed his apology towards his companion, so he didn't see Sirius's eyes darken. He did, however, hear the malice and danger in his voice.
After he finished, he felt all the bad symptoms leave, he had a moment of clarity.
“Draco and I hadn’t gotten to discuss how marriage contracts might fit into his life prior to your winter break. He wanted a bit of time to explore his wants and desires before worrying about the technical part of it and I wasn’t about to force it on him. His father wanted to, but Draco deserved a bit of time to figure out what he likes and I didn’t want him to think of it as a business deal.”
“Oh Draco, you know it’s not-”
“Still don’t trust me, eh? What about now?” He stood up and allowed his veela form to show. “My mother’s side of the family has a few veela. I knew this is what I would look like since I was young enough to know what an inheritance was.” Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away. The blond hair turned into liquid silver his shoulders were broader, his skin got lighter and his eyes….they were pools of mercury staring back at him. The changes were so many, and so subtle that upon further thought you wouldn’t notice one or two. But combined, it made for a hell of a difference. “You’ll catch more flies with honey than spit, Harry.” He quickly shut his mouth, forgetting that he had fangs now. It resulted in him almost biting his tongue. He would have to remember about that.
"Just physically?"
“Well...I never really thought about it but, which one of us is the dominant one?” Draco laughed.
Needless to say, Draco was taken off guard. His father had never asked him that before.
“I’m afraid I don’t think there is. But we’ll revisit that in a moment. Is there any particular reason you don’t want to go home? Or feel that you can’t?” Memories flashed before his eyes, phantom pains rearing their ugly heads with the imagined voice.
“Hey, watch where you’re going Scarhead!” Harry, startled out of his all consuming thoughts, jumped.
"Tell me."
“You know my best subject is defence, I thought this would challenge me a bit.” Harry went back to the book, only getting a sentence in before Ron snorted and started talking to him about how he wished he were good at anything and how easy it must be to not have to worry about homework for one of his classes. Harry tried tuning him out but from the way the comments swirled around in his head, it must not have worked out so well.
"So Draco. Ready to throw away your figure and position in society for something so small you can't even see with a microscope yet?" Draco bristled, angry that he could assume Draco wouldn't be anything but ecstatic he was with child.
“Wait, that’s what we’re doing today?” She waved his concern off and turned to preserve his modesty while he tossed clothes on to cover himself.
He dressed in what Harry told him to get dressed in and ate a light breakfast before Harry arrived. Apparently he wasn't meant to have his entire breakfast before Harry showed up because he hadn't finished when he heard the Floo open. He watched at green flames flickered and flashed before letting Harry out of its warmth. He tried not to look too long at the grey tank top and loose black shorts.
“And if those were not expectations of you?”
“Let’s go to Diagon Alley. I’m sure you’ve noticed I need new clothing by now…” Draco’s eyes lingered over his body, assessing the poorly fitting clothes.
Draco was besides himself. Did he just flirt with Harry bloody Potter? Yes, yes he did. And he had no idea why he had done it.
He sent the letter off and resisted the urge to simply urinate out of the window. He’d been holding it for longer than he thought and had been waiting for the locks to let him use the bathroom when it dawned on him.
"Draco, you ready to go?" Upon seeing the three bags, Harry shook his head. Sirius, on the other hand, decided to be more vocal.
“He’ll have it written and likely submitted to you today. But I’d like to be prepared with our own version so we can compare.” Deciding to drop it for now, Harry finished dressing and followed her downstairs to her parlour where tea and a light breakfast sat on her desk. Parchments were spread out around the plates.
“You’ll meet resistance with that one from Lucius.”
“Well...I’d better learn before diving headfirst without knowing how to swim.”
Their meal was consumed over simple topics, such as the muggle society and the conveniences of being an animagus. After Draco had eaten his fill, the topics got a little heavier, delving into Harry's opinion on Dumbledore and Snape. Draco had loved them, and hated them. Harry didn't know what to think of them.
“Well, are you bloody well going to let me get up so I can see myself?” Seeing the look on Draco’s face he snapped, “I bloody well know what the healer said.” Draco just watched him, clearly not giving in that far. “Alright then! Help me sit up at least.” He struggled to get his hands under his wings so he could prop himself up without plucking some feathers out and wasn’t succeeding. Draco took pity on him, apologized so softly he was amazed Harry could hear it and gently lifted his back up.
"You know mine aren't good enough." His voice was soft, hoarse from not speaking in so long. He didn't have the energy to flinch at how small he sounded.
As he watched, Draco began to doze on the seat across from him. When Harry was completely sure that the other was asleep, he moved him into a less cramping position. He then moved back to his seat and pulled out his book again.
Harry paused in front of the stationary shop, thinking to himself. He hadn’t bought himself ink or quills since first year...he’s just been nicking the ones in the library or using the ones left forgotten in the common room. Shaking his head, he opened the door and walked in. He was going to treat himself to a new quill, ink and parchment if it was the last thing he did.
Draco hit the floor in a dead faint.
“I’m sure he told you about what an inheritance in, yes?” She continued after his nod. “I thought as much. Well, in this book it says that true inheritances are rare, but not unheard of. It most often happens to witches and wizards who have an ancestor that wasn’t human-commonly a parent or grandparent. But it does say extraordinarily gifted witches and wizards are prone to receiving an inheritance in order to better tame the magic inside them. I suppose that’s why he called you to his office, really. He must be worried you’ll receive an inheritance.”
“I understand, it’s incredibly delicious. I imagine I did the same thing the first time I had it.” The two smiled at each other and moved on with their breakfast.
"So, it's not about having an heir is it?"
She arrived a few minutes later, and sat down at the table, pulling out a quill and parchment as she walked. Her heels were no longer the bright colors she used to favor-now they were a flat black and brought no attention to her feet whatsoever. Harry was glad that at least something of hers had changed.
"Elizabeth Malfoy at your service. And you're Harry Potter. Pray tell, why have you never been able to talk to me?" Her whimsical voice was pleasant to listen to.
"Relax. I'm going to get pajamas, I'll be right back." Draco left the room and came back a few moments later dressed for bed. His legs were covered with some silky material and his chest was hiding underneath a black wife beater. Harry could have drooled, if he was awake enough to.
Narcissa lightly scolded him about fussing, and reminded him that Harry most likely wouldn’t want to read straight away awayways. She told him to relax, and if he wanted to he could always just apologize in person if Harry wasn’t too strung out.
“I’m merely disappointed in how easily our son caves to negotiations. I would have thought the Malfoy name was better than that.” Narcissa didn’t even have a chance to reply before Draco had stood.
He hardly paid any attention to the food he was cooking. He was too preoccupied with the thoughts of Harry he had running through his mind.
“You’re Harry Potter?” Harry nodded. “Blimey, that’s wicked.”
But who would stick with him, to love his baby, and maybe even him? His mind wandered. Blaise and Pansy were mad at him for working with the Ministry. Nott was a cruel bastard and got landed in jail a few months ago. Severus...well that was just weird. Severus was his godfather and old enough to be his actual father and then some. He didn't really have anyone else in his life. Unless...
“With our family, yes. There’s the entire Malfoy fortune and estates to think about; not to mention heirs. That’s not including if you want to include fidelity clauses, how often intercourse happens, where you’ll live, who is in charge of daily finances, law wizards-”
“It’s a combination of breakfast and lunch. Trust me, you’ll love it. Now come on, you can share the bed with me since it’s plenty big enough.” He was about to protest when he saw the size of the bed.
She smiled warmly. “Think nothing of it, Mr. Potter. I trust you will stay out of trouble this year. Goodness knows, I’m tired of seeing you in detention. I would like to ask, though, would either one of you be willing to teach a lesson in the care of magical creatures classes about yourselves? I imagine everyone will be incredibly curious. It would have to be on the weekend of course, so as to not interfere with normal lessons.” The both nodded, excited about the idea of getting to teach their classmates about themselves.
She placed her wine glass down incredibly softly, giving her husband a sweet smile as she did so. In a dangerously sweet and soft voice, she asked “May I ask what’s bothering you so that you’re ruining dinner?” Draco swallowed his mouthful of food, all colour gone from his face.
This music was different from Severus's. It wasn't the type of music to change pace often, and left him in a state of constant being, where he could just exist and not have emotions or thoughts. He just...existed.
“Harry?” Draco was softly knocking on his door. “Harry, can I come in?” He tuned into his veela hearing and heard a faint sob. So faint, he thought he didn’t hear it until it happened again.
He had just reached up to sip from his water when Draco leaned over and handed him a glass of wine. A treat indeed, Harry had been banned from wine several years ago when he got completely plastered off a rare vintage he had found in Sirius’s cellar. Draco had been so furious that he didn’t even bother to savour it that he’d been restricted to butterbeer and firewhiskey ever since.
“He spent most of the summer with me, you know that. This relaxes him.” She sighed in resignation and sat down.
"Why are you here?"
The pair will be reunited after the aforementioned 72 hours. The first night is usually spent laying side by side in order to soothe their bond. Dark angels, whether submissives or dominants, must talk to their partner about their future together. Since they have the power to transform their mates into dark angels, this needs to be brought up, as do living situations, plans for procreation and the first declarations of love are normally made. Dark angels are highly recommended to talk about procreation, regardless of gender and position as they are highly fertile creatures. There are no known birth prevention methods for them, and by extension, their mates.
He smiled and sipped, smiling at the approving look Draco gave him. The foot on his thigh crept closer and pressed into his crotch.
Leaning forward to play with Harry’s wings he whispered, “I thought you were a virgin, my angel.” Harry nodded, moaning at the sound of his voice.
“I’m afraid not, I’ve got grading to resume. Mr. Potter here might have a few free minutes for a cup of tea, though.” She left then and Harry followed the headmaster up to his office on a set of spinning stairs.
"Easy. I pay attention. I know more than you think.
“Malfoy.” The name wasn’t said with hostility, but Hermione’s voice didn’t leave any room for warmth either. Draco stepped forward, his hands held up in surrender.
He gave it to one of my grandfathers as payment for his protection and it's never been taken out of the Potter vault at Gringotts until now. All of my grandfathers waited for the perfect time to put it to use, but none found a pure enough reason to use it.
"So, have you thought about what you're going to do before it's too late to do anything?"
The first gift he sent was a daisy, yellow in color, and everlasting. It had arrived and Draco hadn't known how to react. The next was a small purple and blue butterfly that was spelled with an everlasting charm as well. A small lily followed that, this one red. A miniature dragon followed suit. The last he gave him was a charm bracelet with one charm to represent each gift he had given him.
"OH MY GOD! HARRY I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY! I'M A DAD!" Before Harry could do anything Draco had pulled him up and was jumping up and down like a schoolgirl.
Wait, sexy? He meant to think that he was cute. Didn't he? A little voice told him that he didn't and that he had a major crush on the man.
“And does it get worse when you’re near Ron?” He wanted to scream no, that she was wrong, that Ron was a good friend and was just going through a phase. He always had a temper and Harry wasn’t about to let that ruin his friendship. And yet, a very small part of his mind told him that not even Seamus would treat him the way Ron had been for quite some time.
“Harry…” His voice trailed off as his finger tips grazed Harry’s face. “I...just...wow.” Harry inwardly chuckled at how hard the usually eloquent blond had to struggle for words. “Did you get shorter?” He shook his head.
No such luck was bestowed upon him. His vegetable stock soup was on time: noon as always. He just wished he could stomach drinking it faster than Dudley could bust through his door. He awaited the sound of the lock...and it didn’t come. He sipped his soup as silently and as quickly as he could handle without throwing it all up again and once he was done put the bowl on the other side of the cat flap for the first time in days. Dudley had been gracious enough to shatter the rest on the floor for him.
"Yes?"
“So, anything on your mind?” Harry shrugged and gave Draco a half smile.
"You can't sleep without someone you trust, but only one person, and I'm not sure how to solve that problem! You can't sleep in here." Harry hung his head and lowered his voice considerably.
Taking a deep breath, he walked in quietly and stopped when he saw his partner huddled in his blankets. His blond hair was the only thing that could be seen, the rest of his body covered and bound tightly inside the blankets.
“Once bitter rivals put their differences aside to see the beauty the other had to behold. Harry Potter, the Chosen One is now a dark angel. Draco Malfoy, the Slytherin Ice Prince is now a veela. They put aside personal differences and disregarded their different races in order to pursue a life of happiness and love instead of rivalry and bitterness. I am thrilled they took the first step towards a happier future, and I wish you all to do the same.” She nodded and they went to sit at the Gryffindor table. The Gryffindors were more open to Draco’s apology letters than the Slytherins were.
Draco sighed, listening to his pitiful excuses of why he took multiple trips to wizarding towns across the globe. He even went to Russia for Merlin's sakes! But, he knew he was honestly trying and it couldn't be anything bad since Harry was telling him where he was going. Hell, he even took one of Draco's house elves with him whenever he left the house so Draco knew what towns he was going to and to prove he wasn't being unfaithful to him and the baby.
“No Ron, I told you this morning I had to study with Hermione today.” Ron turned back to his breakfast, muttering something under his breath. Harry was pretty sure he heard something about ‘not being a very good friend then’ and sighed. He had really wanted to go study with Hermione, it was something he had been falling behind on.
He gradually fell asleep on the grass while watching the stars. His dreams were filled with Draco; their dates, the way he smiled, the way their lips felt pressed together, the softness of his feathers…
So Harry went into work that Monday a little earlier than usual...as in, three hours early. Whichever dumbfuck that gave him the wrong time this time would be sorely wishing they had picked a different career...in another country...with their mommies.
“Don’t be so bloody dramatic, you’ll turn into a book character before long! Although, I do see your point. By the way, what was your opinion on the homework for history of magic…”
"I could and I did for a little while. But my memories were so distorted, so clouded by instinct, pretty soon no one could make heads or tails of my memories, rendering them useless. I've simply been through too much to give accurate memories about any interrogations and fights. They make sense to only those who have fought to live, not to do their job. They won’t hold up in court. And that's always what I get landed with. I know I can't help what missions I get, but it would be nice to just not worry about getting a menial task because I can't provide a decent memory."
Draco shrugged. “That’s a bit of a multifaceted answer. On the one hand, I felt it was time I learned about it so I could go into it prepared and decide what I wanted out of a life partner. And on the other hand, I finally found someone I’d be happy to present a contract to.” Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Did that mean what he thought it meant?
The next day Harry spent five hours calling Luna and making arrangements, trying to keep Draco from noticing his uncertainty, and picking an outfit to wear. Finally deciding on a dress shirt the color of pine needles and dress slacks, he forewent the tie and came out of his bathroom looking extremely cleaned-up. He had spent almost an hour trying to get his hair to cooperate with him. Now it only looked windswept instead of a war zone.
He'd fix that later.
Flowers of all sizes and colors bloomed in full, with the surrounding area charmed to create the perfect weather, while maintaining the perfect conditions for each individual plant. They walked to the center where Harry had set the picnic basket only an hour before.
“Thank you for your time, Madame Pomfrey. I appreciate it.” Suddenly feeling quite numb, he turned and made it to the entrance of the hospital wing where Draco was leaning against the wall. Draco held his arm and guided him to the Room of Requirement where they both slid under the duvet in the bed provided and fell asleep.
“You are both difficult to love. Your hearts and souls are guarded, but with each other they are open and willing. Heed my warning: together you will be the happiest you could possibly imagine but separated you will only suffer.” She paused and held out her hand while turning to Draco. “Scroll.” He handed it over and she opened it before placing her palm in the middle of it. A white flash covered the parchment and she handed it back, her eyes less dim but no less enchanting to look at.
Harry was elated. The only reason he joined the Aurors was so he could catch the rest of the Death Eaters who chose their fate when his parents were murdered. And these were the last two that weren't dead. He was going to change that. And very soon.
Draco made a bloody good pillow and he was going to take full advantage of that for as long as humanly possible.
Lucius and Narcissa seemed to think that wallowing in his own mind was the best punishment for him. Draco and Severus stood there, shell-shocked. The looked at each other, both knowing what the other was thinking. How could they have treated him with such hatred when he had been on the brink of breaking from the stresses and horrors of what was supposed to be home?
"Remind me again."
"Ah! Malfoy, you twat! What was that for?"
"Well you're in luck. I had someone resign today so you'll get their position. Come in on Monday morning at eight AM. You'll receive further instruction from my assistant who will find you." Draco nodded and left fairly quickly. He just wanted to go home and go to sleep for the next forty-eight hours.
“Do you feel it?” It didn’t take long to figure out what Draco was talking about. As soon as his eyes fell on him, his entire body started pulsing with magic. Tiny dots of if were flying off his body, growing in volume and strength the closer Draco edged towards him.
Harry wasn't sure how long they stayed like that, an he was pretty sure he had fallen asleep at some point, but after a long time there was loud, sharp rapping at the door. Harry jumped up as Draco stepped back hurriedly.
night after the one before.
“I’m here, if you ever want to talk about anything. And I promise you, I won’t treat you differently if you’re worried about that.” Harry recognized the moment for what it was. He could choose to trust Draco, here and now, and that would either make or break their relationship. Draco would either stick by his side and they would grow closer or he’d turn and run. Possibly sell the entire story to the papers.
Harry put the necklace on. As soon as the clasp latched, the gem started glowing faintly. A smile graced his lips-it was nice to know that Draco was thinking of him even if he wasn’t there.
As the sun crept over the horizon more and more, Harry briefly thought about bargaining with his aunt again. If he could just get out of here to do some chores, maybe he could avoid Dudley and his anger. But the last several times were met upon deaf ears. She didn’t want him out of this room and wasn’t allowing him the opportunity to plead his case.
Eventually he must have drifted to sleep, because the sound of his uncle pounding up the stairs awoke him with a start. He jerked up out of bed, silently hurried across the room and sat on the floor behind his dresser. The smaller and more insignificant he made himself seem, the less likely they would bother with him. He heard Dudley stomp to his room and heard the soft rattle of one of the locks being undone.
The next day saw him with pain much worse than the day prior. It was difficult, but he managed to find their bond. It had taken more time than ever before, but he had also never felt prolonged pain like this before.
Bonding is when the angel gets to drink from their mate for the first time. In extreme or rare conditions in which the angel was forced to drink prematurely, the bonding will happen during the first time they participate in intercourse. Drinking of their mates is instinctual, and cannot be stopped without dire consequences. It is then that the bonding will truly begin. Up until now, the angel didn’t have to drink any blood to be sated, although many drink blood from animals to supplement their bodies. Once the bonding is complete, the angel must drink from their mate daily. Over time they will be able to space out feedings.’
Falling asleep came easy for him that night and he welcomed the darkness with open arms.
Draco had to leave under the rouse that he needed to use the loo to try and hide his pride that Harry had trusted him enough to start eating more than he usually did. It made him happy that he wanted to listen to Draco, even after all the years of hell he had put him through. He went back fairly quickly.
“Oi, it’s not like I’ve thought about it much! Just passing thoughts every now and again. More curiosity than anything, I think I’ve thought about kissing most of the students in our year at some point or another.” Harry stomped down the brief wave of disappointment he felt.
"Black shut up. You might wake him." Draco picked the paintings up and put them face-down on the ground before picking Harry up. He carried him to the tent and pulled the sheets over his still form. The least he could do was make sure he didn't wake up with a sore back.
When Vernon was done with him, he yanked Harry’s pants back on quite roughly and tossed him to the floor, spitting on his face. He left and Dudley came in, oblivious to what just happened, and kicked Harry into unconsciousness.
"No, you won't. You're going to go to your cubicle with your files. You're going to do this paperwork by yourself. You're going to do that, and then if you want to live, you're never going to come near me again. I don't work for lesser people. And I don't take orders from worthless pieces of scum like you. Dismissed."
"I'm fine. It's just the DNA changing in the baby, it took me by surprise that's all." Harry nodded and pulled him in closer. They fell asleep holding onto one another with smiles on their faces and one hand each on Draco's stomach.
"Because I was worried about you. Now get some sleep."
They mulled over the information that Lucius had found and Draco let a small smile, full of hope, grace his face.
And the amount of food sitting on the bed was staggering. Each one was clearly charmed with some sort of stabilization spell to keep the food from tipping. Everything he could imagine was in front of him. Draco was busy making himself a plate and turned as if to ask Harry why he was staring when he could be eating. He grabbed a small bowl of oatmeal, covered it with some sausage gravy and topped the whole thing off with an over-easy egg. He settled in with a glass of orange juice and tried not to laugh when he saw Draco devouring some sort of food that he didn’t recognize.
"You don't scare me, rather...my nightmares scare me. Sometimes they're so similar to what I woke up to today that I can't tell the difference between dream, memory, and reality. This was just one of those times where the lines blurred together. It's not your fault, really. You were really the only thing that grounded me as a child, and as such you don't scare me anymore.
Harry gasped and lifted his head. He didn’t feel the horrible loneliness as strongly as before. It was still there, aching in the background, but Harry could finally think again. It wasn’t consuming him anymore. He laid back, opening himself up for the first time in days. The stretching would do him good.
"I like the sound of that," Harry snickered.
"Well...You came at a good time. I was just making dinner."
Draco kept to his word and didn’t send an owl until the second week of them being out of school. It was some sort of pygmy breed, small enough to be mistaken for a regular bird if you glanced at it. Harry let the bird rest on his shoulder and read the note attached to its leg.
“Harry, you do realize how serious this is, right? You would have died if I hadn’t sent you any food.” Harry nodded. He knew how bad it was, but he didn’t like admitting it. After all, it wasn’t like they were holding a gun to his head or raping him or anything. Other people have dealt with worse, so he had no place complaining when others could benefit from the help more than he would.
When they headed back up, Draco took extra care to make sure he flooded Harry’s senses with his scent. He fluttered his wings if they were anywhere near each other and stretched them out when they weren’t as if he knew Harry was looking. He even went so far as to bite his lip when he caught Harry staring.
"You know I'll overdose if I take any more potions to help me sleep." The picture scowled.
“Since babies aren't made with spells of this nature, his body is rejecting it while his magic tries to save it. His body will literally kill itself unless someone were to either donate sperm or actually commit the act with him. I thought you should know as you clearly care about his well-being."
Or...that wouldn’t have made sense to him when he was younger and he wondered why-or even when-his opinion on that changed. Sure it would make sense if you had something major that was taking up a lot of your time and energies but wasn’t being romantically involved with someone supposed to help you improve yourself and your life?
“Mrs. Malf-”
The next meal, Hedwig landed right in front of Harry while Draco was at the other end of the table discussing some of the changes with Hermione and Neville. Draco turned to watch as Harry opened the letter he had written just this morning.
All in all, it was pretty interesting and before Draco even thought about taking a shower he was sitting in the nearest chair and completely enraptured. After a few minutes, he decided that he was confident he could figure out the simpler spells without the hints and notes written in the margins.
“The vampire negates that, I think.”
He refused to marry anyone he didn't love, and no one would love him back enough to marry him. He wanted kids, but he knew he'd never get them.
Draco woke up at three-thirty to the sound of his wand-alarm. He picked it up wondering why in the hell he made it go off this early. Oh right-training.
"Everyone SHUT UP!" The students stopped their torrent of curses for the moment to listen to their Savior. "Look, just stop. Fighting is not what school is for. Now control yourselves. You think I haven't heard all the whispers? You think I don't know the rumors floating around? I know about them, I hear the comments. But you didn't think about the most important factor. I DON'T CARE! There's nothing you can say that will hurt me, so stop trying. And to everyone else who has decided to defend us-it's not worth your breath. They'll never stop. So just don't bother wasting your time." He cancelled the volume charm and let his protection spell fall. "C'mon Draco, let's go. I can't eat anyway."
And he surprised himself by wanting that, with Harry Potter nonetheless.
“What, and possibly scare him off? How absurd, I don’t want to be the hero; swooping in and rescuing him from the big bad villains and then expecting him to swoon. How atrocious. No, I’d much rather friendzone myself than lose whatever it is we have right now.”
Suddenly the room was entirely too hot, his trousers entirely too small and the looks Draco started giving him were entirely too full of lust. Harry took a deep breath and somehow made it through the boring dinner service.
He could deny Draco and have him try to find someone else and then see if he could manage that. But if he denied him, then he would never have a child to call his own. And if Draco couldn't find someone else soon enough then he would die, taking the child with him. Harry couldn't let that happen.
“Yeah,” he admitted. Madame Pomfrey sent Draco on his way and instead of just giving him a potion so he could sleep for the night, she had him sit down in her office. The plush armchair was soft and comfortable, much more so than the old, worn-out armchairs in the common room.
He looked up when he felt Harry's hand next to his own, into the jade eyes.
"You need an alarm?" He watched Draco nod. "Oh. I guess once you get used to it you don't need one anymore." Once Draco was dressed, Harry handed him a bottle of water and a banana. "Let's go."
He paused. The man in the office next to his was kinda cute. Light brown hair, dark brown eyes. Good build. Too bad he already had someone in his life. Harry liked the quiet ones. He never really dated, but he thought someone quiet would be good for him. He needed a quiet atmosphere after the War.
“Anything else you’d like to tell me?” She paused before continuing. “You know, as his honorary sister, I’m sure there’s something you must have forgotten to mention.”
“Sod off, you’re fine. Mother just updated my account credit for the holiday, so if you see anything you’d like to try or anything you fancy just grab it.” Harry raised an eyebrow.
"Bare minimum." He watched Sirius's face fall. "And I'm shrinking you down to size, of course." They beamed at each other.
“Draco I can’t stand it anymore. You teasing me was fun the first day but I want more. Can we please, please take things just a step further?” Draco beamed, he was delighted that Harry wanted to move things along to the courting stage. He had been spending a lot of time with Hermione, trying to get a good idea of what to shower Harry with when he was ready to progress their relationship further.
“Yeah Hagrid. Thanks for holding up the train, Ron took forever eating and didn’t pack until after breakfast.”
"So, it's not about having an heir is it?" Draco looked affronted.
He didn’t wake up to hear the locks being redone on the outside of the door, and he didn’t wake up to the loud POP’s signalling people apparating outside the house. He didn’t hear the shouting match Vernon was having with the strangers, and he didn’t hear Narcissa Malfoy rush up the stairs, blast the door open, or yell for Severus. He didn’t even flinch when she apparated him away from the Dursley’s forever.
He then realized that he was supposed to be up and practicing spells already. Shortly after realizing this, Draco told his conscience to kindly shut up. He planned on sleeping in, damn it.
Draco nodded after all of this and picked him up after he had caught his breath again. Carrying Harry to the kitchen was no difficult feat, and he managed easily. Harry looked at him in askance, wondering why they were in the kitchen of all places.
"It's yours now. Don't think about giving it back, I gave it to you knowing full well the implications behind it." He reached out and took Draco's hand that wasn't occupied with the box. "I hope you'll accept." After saying a quick goodnight to the baby, he got up an left Draco sitting on the couch. Draco knew Harry wasn't going to be spending the night in a bed tonight. The look on his face said it all.
After several minutes, Draco was finally able to lift Harry off his lap so they could fall asleep in each other’s arms. With the bond finally complete, they relaxed into each other’s embrace.
"He means it. I never saw him cry until that day. Not even when he was a baby." Draco sat down and hid his face in his hands. He really messed up when he was a kid. Which was why he would never be able to have someone.
"What's pizza?" Draco inwardly berated himself for seeming ignorant about something. Surprisingly, Harry didn't tease him for his ignorance, rather he quite nicely summed it up for him.
"That's where I come in, isn't it? To provide documentation and to file said documentation? Not that I'm adverse to that..." Draco trailed off. He really wasn't adverse to the idea, he rather enjoyed watching Harry fight. He went at it with more passion than anyone he'd ever seen. Plus, he came up with some useful spells on the spot. He could learn from that, just like he used to do back in school.
Needless to say, the sudden turn of their conversation took Draco off guard. He shrugged and simply said that abuse was abuse; hurting people wasn’t okay, no matter how it was you hurt them. Draco’s response put Harry at ease, knowing that he wouldn’t have to beat around the bush with the issues back at the Dursley’s should it come up.
"Draco, where are we?"
“Prat, you’ve always been enough for me.” He hadn’t thought twice about his words, until he felt Draco’s foot nudge his leg.
“Yeah, I know. I guess I just got used to the way they treat me so I didn’t think to say anything.”
"LOOK YOU, I AM NOT LEAVING MY HUSBAND NOW BACK OFF AND DO YOUR JOB!" The Healers left him alone after that and let him hold Draco's hand.
But, he wasn't. He was currently on his side, tense, yet half asleep. It was only when he felt another body slide into the bed next to him that he woke up fully. His eyes widened after they shot open, and his voice failed him as the words he wanted to say tried forcing their way out.
"Harry...do you like him?"
He washed himself down, and feeling considerably cleaner than before, he dried himself off and dressed in his clothes someone had washed for him.
“Fine. They weren’t feeding me and then they just decided to leave me locked into the room they put me in. Aunt Petunia said they were going to attach automatic locks that would let me out every few hours for the toilet but I guess they forgot.”
“Draco? You seem to know more about all this inheritance stuff than I do...and I know we have to complete our bond but...how do we go about such a thing?” Draco summoned a book from the bookshelf, one that he recognized from his personal stock at home. Opening it to the bookmarked page, he cleared his throat.
“But?”
"Harry?" He looked up, indicating that he should continue. "Who's this admirer person? It's driving me insane." Harry stood up and walked over to him slowly, thoughtfully.
The next week he sent an owl. On it was a parcel labeled to Draco and it landed on his shoulder. It was elegant and black with a few white feathers here and there.
He went to sit in the garden in the hopes that it would soothe the pain he felt. He missed Draco dearly. The roses seemed to do the trick-their soft perfume caressing some of the pain away. It reminded him of the times they had sat out here watching the stars.
"It's an Italian dinner. Come here, I'll show you." Draco moved next to him and watched as he explained how to manipulate the dough to do what he wanted it to do. He then spent the next ten minutes tossing pizza dough. He was amazed to find that he actually had fun throwing food around a kitchen, even if he messed up once or twice.
“Then the fidelity clause, I can’t stand the thought of someone leaving behind my back to get off with someone else. And a privacy clause for the press, the last thing I need is my sex life advertised to the papers.” She started writing and he continued on. “I don’t want a restriction on kids, I want to choose that on my own. I might not ever be ready to have a child-that’s not a good environment to grow up in.”
"Draco..." his voice was hardly audible from disuse. "Draco...wake up. I miss your company, I miss pissing you off. I miss running with you. I can't let that go-how can you just lay there when you know I'm torn up inside? I can't love you-I can't love anyone. But I have grown to care for you.
“Isn’t there anything we can do for him? We can’t just watch him suffer like this! Draco wasn’t this bad when he got his inheritance! I wasn’t this bad with mine! What is happening? You had better tell me now, or so help me Albus…” She got up and threatened him with her eyes. The intent was clear.
“Defence Against All the Arts? What on earth could you possibly need that for?” Irritation coloured Ron’s voice.
"As you probably don't know this, I'll just tell you everything. Our paperwork documents everything from every situation we find ourselves in. Since it wouldn't do to have me recount the information to you, my boss wants someone with me. Just like with other teams, it would make it more...professional if you were to go with. Not to fight, although you do have to be trained somewhat before you can come with, but so you can document information and lend memories as necessary."
"Oh hell no! I've covered for you working with every questionable person so you wouldn't have to! It's your turn!"
“About that, when did you want to bond? I think everything that could be said has already been said, seen and felt through our bond.” Draco softly pressed their lips together.
"Um that's all fine and dandy but couldn't you do that? Provide memories, I mean." Draco watched the other man's face turn thoughtful and slightly dark.
“Would you make your favorite thing to cook? I don’t care what it is, I’m sure it will be delicious.” Bonnie stood there, shocked. And then, she practically vibrated with happiness.
"So you're going to hurt yourself more by continuing a job you despise and seeing the man you love live his life out without you? I don't think so. You've survived a lot, but that can kill you. Harry, I love you, you know this. I can't allow you to let something this good walk away."
Although, as he looked through some of the notes, he noticed that they were all apparently hints to mastering the spells. In some spots, he even found spells written into the ends of chapters with brief descriptions as to what they did and how to perform them.
“Wait, doesn’t the courting come first?” His mother sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. “I’m sorry, I’ll listen.”
“It’s the smallest wing of the house and really I only use the library, bedroom, sitting room and en suite. I think my parents are hoping I’ll have more use for it when I start having people over. Personally, I think this sort of lifestyle intimidates people. Too much space for typical families.”
“Mr. Malfoy, as I’m sure you’re aware, your parents contacted me a few days ago once you found your mate. I’ve taken the necessary steps, and converted your private rooms into a suitable place for you both to stay.” She paused, thinking about how to go about this next part. “Normally, I would say that you two need to behave yourselves but since there are necessary steps to your bonding...well at any rate, no other students are allowed to visit you after hours. You two will have free reign of the school, except the house dormitories after hours, in order to further your relationship.
"I only ever did that one once and that was because I didn't know how bad it tasted. I never did it again. So Remus asked me what I wanted from life. I told him basically what you just told me, except I wanted kids too. Or at least one kid. In a roundabout way we ended up having the best sex of my life, not to mention all the sweet things we did for each other.
"Remind me to put a silencing charm on you when we leave."
Later that night, Draco watched Harry build a fire. It was strangely quiet in the forest, and he wasn't sure he liked it. He didn't dislike it. It was just...different.
They both had filled their money bags with as much gold as they would hold, and decided to start at Madam Malkin’s and working their way back to the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was excited to see what Madam Malkin and Draco would pick out for him, and he was even more excited to have new clothes. Draco was just happy Harry had agreed to let him pick out clothes that would look good.
“So I haven’t been spending as much time with him. It’s no big deal.”
"Fine. Just promise me that you won't change your opinion of me once I tell you. Not even Ron and Hermione know. Consider it a debt repaid." Draco shuddered. It must have been bad to know that Harry wanted him to not change his opinion of the other boy so much he'd call on the incident when he'd rescued him from breaking his neck in Charms. He nodded, showing his agreement.
At three in the morning the next day, Draco had to wake him up again. His blood curdling screams were almost too much for him to bear any longer, but he bit his tongue and resisted asking what he was screaming for. He knew that if he asked questions, he'd be less likely to receive an answer from the distraught man.
Somehow they had managed to attach glue to him and then sprayed feathers all over the glue so they'd stick. Not even magic could get them out easily-he had to make up his own cleaning spell to rid his person of the idiotic pieces of fluff. Draco and Harry had laughed the whole time.
“How delightful, I so rarely receive visitors! Come, come, you simply must stay for a cup of tea.”
His hair was as wild as ever, but Harry’s face looked much more relaxed then he’d ever seen it before. At the nearly silent snore he realized Harry had to be uncomfortable so he scooped him up and carried him to the bed before tucking him in. As he brushed Harry’s fringe away from his face, a thought slammed straight into him with the force of a speeding lorry.
“Mother sent me an owl. Specifically, she asked about you since I mentioned we’d been getting along quite swimmingly.”
Draco was more cautious, and he took his time walking around the place. When he was done, he met up with Harry in the kitchen where Harry was making a small meal of pasta.
"Why do you care?" Harry looked at the blond, seeing that he had fallen asleep. The question had been him sleep-talking.
“I-I j-just don’t k-know wh-what’s w-wrong. I-I’m just s-so s-sad,” He tried to keep talking through the sobs, but the sorrow eventually won out, effectively cutting his speech off.
“Yeah, I have been.”
He greeted the man with as much politeness as he could muster and led him towards his office so he could just relax for once. He sat down on the giant couch and heaved a heavy sigh.
You look wonderful sleeping in bed next to me. Your wings hardly wanted to let me slip away to write this. But that’s alright, I caressed them until they let me leave for a moment. Maybe when you wake up those caresses will have caused more than your wings to stiffen and relax with delight
To say that Ron was livid was an understatement. He’d heard that Harry and Hermoine had been studying with Draco and practically lost his mind over it. Hermione had appeased Ron in the common room, telling him the three had been paired into a group by the teacher and needed to get the project done. In the dormitory, however, Ron laid into Harry.
"Harry?"
“Come in, Mr. Potter. Have a seat.” He walked to the comfy looking chair in front of the fireplace and she sat down in her chair before summoning a tea service. “What can I help you with?”
"Well, at least you tried. Don't hurt yourself thinking about it if you can't recall it. Now how about a game of chess?" Draco knew Harry was hiding something, he just didn't know what.
Harry finished the three-hour long class and sent his students on their way. He then promptly flooed to Grimmauld Place and collapsed onto the nearest chair to eat lunch. He loved teaching his classes, they kept him in shape, but sometimes he just wanted to sit down at home and think.
Harry thought over his answer carefully. The truest of answers was that he was almost afraid to bring anyone into the dynamic Harry and Ron had created-it hadn’t worked out the best with Hermione and everyone that tried to get close to Harry always kept their distance when Ron was around so he hadn’t even bothered trying after second year.
Harry walked through the station ignoring the stares around him. It wasn't any of their business how he decided to dress or look like. He was done pretending for them.
"Draco?" The soft voice practically begged for Draco to lift his head up, and he did. Harry was closer than he originally thought, and he was caught in pools of green, flecked with gold. "Draco, why are you upset?" He felt a tear fall.
Draco slid the neck of the bottle into him, going slowly so Harry could feel the full effect of the twists the glass made. When the bottle bottomed out, Harry keened and pressed back in the hopes that there was more he could take. The blond, not in the mood to disappoint, withdrew the bottle and pushed it back in. He sped up and slowed down as he pleased, basking in the noises Harry was making below him. It was then that he had an idea.
Harry was surprised to note when he woke up that he had woken due to hunger and not his aunt screaming or dormmates shouting at each other to get out of bed. He smiled, kept his eyes closed and stretched languidly. The mattress must be stuffed with clouds, there’s no other possible explanation for how soft and soothing it was.
“Now,” she sat down and motioned for him to do the same. “Time to get down to business. And please remember you can change your mind later and this isn’t binding. You can decide to say no later on. That being said, what are some things that you consider non-negotiable for your partner? No matter who that partner is?”
“Well, why not?” That took all the steam out of his ramblings. “He’s an attractive young man. You’re always talking about him during the summers, you offered to take him into our home, you’re constantly finding ways to be around him during school and you’re nervous around him when lewd subjects arise. It makes sense to me.”
It was half an hour of unadulterated bliss for Draco, being brought to the edge and denied release over and over again. Harry’s mouth was just too perfect, and that tongue did wonderful things to him.
"SLYTHERIN!" The entire Hall gasped and whispers, murmurs and shouts alike were thrown around and ignored as Harry walked to the appropriate table. He didn't care what they had to say, anyway. He sat down at the end of the table closest to the teachers where few ever sat. His eyes never left Snape's as he mouthed a thank you.
Half an hour later, and no walking breaks, Draco was delighted to see that they were done running. Harry smiled at the relieved look on his companion's face. Too bad they couldn't stop for the day.
Harry did and his face lit up when he saw the incredibly soft, super plushy teddy bear. Harry looked up at him, half afraid it was a cruel joke.
“I’ll let Hedwig know to meet you there Harry!” Ron called after him. It was obvious he was in too much of a rush to even worry about it.
'Draco~
But unlike last time, this time he was scared.
“I-I don’t really know.” Honestly he had no idea what to expect that contract to contain. So they spent the morning and early part of the afternoon discussing what could be included and what’s commonly included. By the time afternoon tea came around, Harry was more confident in the things he wanted but was still unsure how to ask for them.
Harry woke up on the floor, sore but sated. Draco had drifted off to sleep on the couch. He moved, trying to get to Draco so he could wake him up with a spectacular blowjob and realized he was incredibly full of liquid. He thought back to the previous night and made a bit of a face. He was full of wine.
“Who was that?” Draco smiled, clearly getting amusement out of the faint trace of jealousy that laced Harry’s voice.
It was, by far, the best Christmas Harry ever had.
"I'm assuming that they made you go through a few testing situations?" Draco nodded, remembering the ridiculous situations he was put on before they would even take his resume. "Well good.
"Didn't you read the letter? You don't need robes, you're seventh year was fucked up. Anyone that was seventh year last year and going back to finish school don't need robes unless they want to wear them."
Harry did say that he'd be there no matter what. And obviously with the Weasley family and their productiveness with kids he was used to it, or at least exposed to it frequently. He supposed that being the godfather of several kids had to be better than nothing.
"What are you taking?"
“You’ve never kissed someone that’s shorter than you?” Harry suddenly felt a flash of insecurity but quickly gathered up his Gryffindor courage (with a bit of help from a large swig of eggnog) and shook his head.
“Cool, I’ll come with you. I need a book about defence as well.” Harry did his best to figure out a way to get Colin to leave him alone but gave it up as a bad job and went to the defence section. As he passed by the usual study table, he shook his head ever so slightly and completely ignored Hermione before selecting a book and making his way to Madam Pince to check it out.
Merlin above, I’m attracted to Harry-Bloody-Potter.
“Nothing dearest,” Lucius spat.
"Now, I hope you two have a wonderful visit. Damion and Shane will take care of everything." Draco nodded his thanks and saw the two men start heading towards the front as he felt Harry lean towards him. He leaned in as he could practically feel the curiosity pouring off the other teen.
Giving the answer would be a little awkward though.
He couldn't believe that he had just kissed Harry Potter. He couldn't believe how much he had enjoyed it-how little butterflies swarmed in his stomach at just the mere thought of what had happened. His lips continued to tingle up through him losing his conscious mind to sleep.
Of all the people he expected to see, Draco wasn’t one of them.
At the end of dinner on Wednesday, Draco blew him a kiss and winked. Harry, on the verge of going insane, jerked up from the table. “All right, that’s enough!” He stormed out of the hall, Draco hot on his heels.
He watched the last two run off and stared at the brunet man in front of him. He still hadn't turned around to face him and he wondered if he was ever going to get to touch those broad shoulders.
Harry walked in first, eyeing the dark colored walls. Each room was a different color, however they all matched as they were all dark colors with black accents. He loved that. He also loved the fact that there was a kitchen, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, a library, a large office with two desks connected to the library, and a den. He loved it.
"Push ups. Now." Draco's face fell.
“Just held you until you calmed down is all. We fell asleep like this.” Harry yawned and stretched before moving to sit up. Draco followed suit and Harry leaned on his side as Draco levitated their gifts straight to the bed. Their gifts were a bit jumbled when they landed, but Draco rolled his eyes and handed Harry one. “We’ll sort through them as we go, yeah?” Harry nodded.
“Well, students who don’t go home for the holiday break, or-or students who can’t go home over the holiday break...is there something like that for the summer?” She looked thoughtful as she sipped her tea.
And who would want that?
When he rounded the corner, he almost ran smack into none other than Draco Malfoy.
"Sure. I think I'd like that a lot better than where I am now." He took a deep breath as the Hat yelled out the name of his new House.
"I don't know! He's been so helpful and nice to me I just don't know what to think of him anymore! What am I supposed to think?" Severus took him by surprise.
"I'm doing the interview. And I'm overseeing the entire thing from start to finish. If so much as a comma is put where I don't like it, then I'm making them fix it. I don't care if you do or not, but it would make it easier on me if you at least went with me. I don't think I can face her on my own." He quickly nodded, eager to see Rita put in her place, and curious as to what Harry would say at the interview.
“You mentioned you have nightmares a lot a while ago so I figured it couldn’t hurt if you had him around. I thought it might help. At the very least, it has a silencing charm on it so you don’t have to worry about silencing charms failing in the middle of the night. Just put it on your bed and it’ll charm the whole bed for you.” Harry’s tentative smile turned into a large grin as Harry hugged him.
He thought about how he'd never be able to get another charm for his bracelet and let the tears fall as they formed. He didn't bother trying to stop them and before he knew it they stopped.
"Yes I did. You knew I wasn't Severus and you didn't know what to think, so I scared you. I'm sorry, I should've said something so you wouldn't have gotten upset. I don't like upsetting you, you know." Harry's face wrinkled in confusion. "Even when we were kids. I never liked hurting you. I just didn't know how else to get you to pay attention to me. And then when I figured out I was going about it all wrong, I thought that you and your friends would never believe me because of the way that I had treated you in years past. So in my mind, I was forced to continue to hate you for you to keep talking to me. Even if it was shouting in my face like you did."
"Castrate?"
“Wait, you have an entire wing of this place to yourself?” Draco nodded and smiled when Harry’s jaw dropped.
He ran another quick spell on the smaller boy and seeing the same result a before, he sighed. Stable was as good as he could hope for at this point.
“I’d be delighted to. Now, I believe you have someone to talk to? It’s gotten quite late. I’ll have dinner sent up for you both.” She gave him a knowing smile and shooed him off.
A lot had changed in a week.
“No, I think I get it.” Harry closed his eyes, and concentrated on sending a wave of desire towards his better half. He opened his eyes when he heard a tiny gasp. “Like that?” Draco nodded, his cheeks warming. He hadn’t been expecting Harry to grasp the concept so quickly, or to be able to send such a strong emotion to him and he especially didn’t expect his angel to send something so naughty his way.
Draco had always been a curious boy, ever since he could remember. He always found something just so appealing about not knowing and then finding out about it through his own observations. Like memorizing where different places were or how to make something work. So the case with Harry Potter wasn't any different-or so he had thought.
“Well you wanted to consume this so much I thought I’d give you a hand.” Putting the opening of the bottle against Harry’s rim, he slowly tipped the bottle.
It felt like an eternity later, but the burning in his back subdued itself to a throbbing that he could handle. The pain in his chest finally slowed to a dull ache. His skin no longer felt like it was on fire, just too warm. But with a sudden vengeance, all the pain that had dissipated came back and attacked his mouth. He wanted to scream, but the pain was too much. His back arched, feeling lethargic in the pool of his consciousness.
"So...I have to have sex?" Harry nodded. "But who would be insane enough to have a child with another man? Actually, who would do it without taking advantage of me and then ditching...?" Harry just sat there, completely at a loss.
"I was busy Sev. But I'm here now so I obviously didn't miss your dry company." He smiled.
"He didn't give anyone else the case because I told him I'd stay to the end of my contract before quitting. Although at that point it's pretty much just not resigning up. He in turn told me after I got a steady partner that wouldn't leave I could have the case." Harry sat down in his chair and pulled out a bottle of rum.
Draco sat up and took Harry's hands in his own, looking down at them.
“You should laugh more. I like it.” The last of Harry’s giggles faded as his face flushed bright red.
He didn’t stick around to find out more.
Dark angels are most often the dominant in the mating relationship, and are usually the ones initiating all the steps. If the dark angel is not the dominant, then their partner is usually informed via a friend or ally of the two and nudged into the right direction. Teasing comprises of multiple things, such as blowing a kiss, winking, giggling, flirting, fluttering wings and pheromones in the direction of their submissive, et cetera. This stage usually lasts only a few days, although it has been known to last months in more extreme cases.
"What about me?" They scrambled off to follow the other three without a fuss, both trying to yank the other one back to get away sooner. Draco, having seen all this, looked like a porcelain doll that got tossed into a box full of matchbox cars, and Harry wasn't sure he liked that he scared his newest partner so soon.
“And do you think that maybe your issue with him is making you too tense in the dorms to sleep properly?” Harry simply shrugged.
Apparently Draco was still in bed because he felt the mattress dip near him and the duvet was pulled off of his face. He scrunched up his face in protest at the bright light and yawned before sitting up, eyes still closed. Harry was busy trying to locate his glasses while Draco watched with a smile.
"Patience dear. Patience." He gently opened Draco up and licked the pink pucker he found there after flinging the boxers elsewhere. He shuddered underneath him and Harry licked harder, loving the heady taste and the reactions he was pulling out of him. He tired of just licking and pointed his tongue, pressing it against his opening and waited. He tensed, but slowly relaxed, turning into putty in Harry's hands. He loved it.
“Bite me, Harry. Bite me while you ride me.” He held Harry’s head to his neck and Harry could hardly contain the inhuman growl that escaped his chest before he bit down on Draco’s neck.
To say that Draco looked shocked was an understatement.
Their bond and emotions only grew over time. Only a year after buying their home, the two decided that Harry would turn Draco. It wouldn’t make him a dark angel, just a dark veela. If the only thing that came of it was that Draco needed to feed from Harry while Harry fed from him, then they’d take the trade off. Feeding was always an intimate thing for the two of them and if they got to do it for all eternity then they’d take the opportunity.
Bending over them, he smirked.
He found him in his room reading a book with new glasses.
Approaching the door, he sighed. He wasn't too sure he wanted to walk through, he supposed he could just walk away. But Harry was too noble for that. So throwing away all of his self-preservation and remaining pride, he opened the door just enough to get inside and quickly shut it again.
“Are you alright?”
"I asked you to let me court you because I wanted to get to know you. Yes more physical contact would have been great. But it never would have allowed me and you to have a lasting relationship.
‘If I remember correctly, you weren’t too fond of herbology; what makes you an expert on jasmine plants? I have more important news though. The Dursley’s left for a holiday today. I’ve no idea when they’ll be back; they said in a few weeks but the last few years Petunia has said a few weeks it was just the rest of the summer. Last year, four weeks turned into two months. Can you send more bread? Crackers couldn’t go amiss either. They’ve effectively locked down the entire house except the loo.
“GET UP! YOU’RE MAKING BREAKFAST TODAY, FREAK!” He groaned, having just been jolted from a restful sleep and shuffled to the door of the bedroom they’d shoved him into at the beginning of the summer.
"Um..." He looked pointedly at the Healers and they left quickly. He waited until they were out of earshot and closed the door.
"Okay I'll tell you. But you first."
He slowly fucked him with his tongue and after the shock of what he was doing wore off, Draco started moaning and grinding against his face.
“So...I did get an inheritance…?” He let the question hang in the air, wary of the answer.
Draco could tell it hadn’t been very long when he was jolted awake by a breathy silent scream. He sat up and looked over to Harry who was screaming, but almost silently. He was definitely exhaling like he was screaming, but it had a high pitched little squeak every now and again.
A quiet crack sounded outside of his window and he looked out to see a man dressed in a black suit with a crisp white shirt underneath complete with tie and the glint of cufflinks. His hair was fairly long and just a tad greyer than Draco’s hair.
"I don't want pity. I just want to make sure that you don't make the mistakes I made." Harry got up and started to leave the room. He turned in the doorframe. "And Malfoy? Be sure to be up tomorrow morning by nine. Preferably dressed." He laughed at the slight blush on the pale man's cheeks and flooed home.
For today was the day that he came up with a believable lie for the entire Wizarding World to read in the newspapers. He hated the fact that people made assumptions, but this time he wanted to be the one to be feeding them the right assumptions to make. It really irritated him that he had to do this, make up another lie about himself, but he also knew that he'd get a lot farther along in life if he just spewed out what he knew the public needed to believe. In due time he might, perhaps, tell Draco and Severus what really went on and explain the real reasons as to why he had all the nightmares and why he was dressing as he was. Maybe they'd understand, in time.
"Josephina Marie and Jasper Alan? That okay with you?" Draco nodded and kissed him lightly.
He walked to the main fitness room and saw his class ready to go and without missing a beat started the young adults' aerobics class. He was going to hurt tomorrow, but it would be worth it to get a new partner-one he knew wouldn't scare off as easy as the others had.
Only twenty or so minutes had passed before he heard everyone filing out the door, the front door being shut, the car being turned on, car doors slamming and then silence.
When Harry woke up the next day he dressed mutely and didn't eat anything for breakfast. His throat burned from the previous night and his stomach couldn't handle food when he was this stressed, and stressed he was.
“Time to get dressed, you and I have much to discuss! Draco, your father expected you an hour ago. You’d best be going now.”
“Oh heavens, no! It used to be more like that, back before my generation but as time goes on purebloods have realized that love has to come first or the relationship will only result in many couples being completely miserable. That’s why the courting period is there; to allow the two to get to know one another and without all the insane hormone rampages you teenagers get yourselves into.” Harry blushed. He’d never really felt as sexually inclined as the other boys in his year were, but he refused to bring that up at the moment.
“Harry’s magic, Ronald. And I’ll thank you to refrain from talking with your mouth full, I have to return this book to Professor Dumbledore when I’m done reading it.” Ron closed his mouth, decent enough to look sheepish, and swallowed. “So you’re telling Harry about how his magic has been going a little haywire, huh? We thought you were just playing it off, have you really not noticed?”
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the dinner feeding each other and answering the questions of their classmates. Even students from other houses were walking over to them to ask questions.
"I'd like to be resorted, Sir." His voice was quiet, yet he was certain that everyone in the hall could hear it. The silence was so deep in the next two seconds that it actually had a noise to it. Without preamble or words, Snape turned and picked up the Hat. He placed it on his head and the rest of the castle waited with bated breath.
They had only been on their honeymoon for two weeks when Draco suddenly bent over clutching his stomach and crying out. It had hurt, a lot, and he knew this was no mere joke. The baby was coming, and it wanted out.
He was so lost in his thoughts, he didn't notice Draco walk into his room wearing the necklace he had given him until he cleared his throat.
"Well, dry as my company may be, my wine stash is not so be on with it. What's gone on this week?"
The entire time he spent with them, he was thinking about Draco. At least they both had people they cared about there to take care of them when things got too bad. He had his friends and Draco had his parents there to help.
"To think that the reason so many people can't get a job or a spouse or have kids is nothing but a scar so light you have to know what to look for. To think that this is one of the few reminders of why I can't live a normal life." Draco shuddered slightly but corrected him.
“Mother asked if you had anyone to teach you about managing your estate when you come of age.” He was glad to hear that his voice didn’t waiver.
The common room was less of a common room and more of a large living room. Emerald green with gold accents made the space feel cozy; there was a huge fireplace off to the left, with oversized chairs and a smaller couch. Behind that was a kitchen and an island with bar stools on the other side. To their right was a study nook with a large table and chairs, complete with a tall bookshelf against the wall. Just beyond that was a doorway that presumably led to their rooms.
“I wasn’t aware you knew the size of my entertainment if you catch my drift.” The way Draco was trying-and failing-to hold in his laughter made Harry’s breath catch. He was flustered and he could feel the blush he was now sporting, but he wasn’t completely sure what to say so he turned back to the window and chuckled nervously. That seemed to do the trick and before he knew it the two were giggling like schoolgirls.
That was always the conclusion he drew. Of course, Harry thought he was overworking himself too. Now that Draco was pregnant and the brunet didn't have to work, he actually had time to sit down and think. He had the time to think about the curse he endured that promoted the growth of his baby.
“Hey Colin, is there something I can help you find?”
Harry curled up into Draco’s chest, seeking comfort from the blond in his sleep. Draco wrapped an arm around him and sighed happily. He didn’t want to move from this moment, ever.
And not only courting. Traditional courting.
"How'd you figure out how to cheat the system though?"
“Albus, I wish I could tell you the extent this boy has been traumatized tonight. Not just with his changing. I can smell it on him, the kind of pain he was forced to suffer through. Why would you not come to us sooner, if the boy was being punished this way? You knew, and yet you ignored it. That is truly unforgivable.” Her voice was lowered, a sadness that was overpowered by a dark threatening undertone towards the end.
He was fully prepared to beat himself up for being such a crappy friend when he thought about Draco. He must not be such a terrible friend if Draco had stuck around, right?
This was how he liked Hogwarts best. It was quiet, the walls splashed with the moonlight from the windows and Harry loved it. You could practically hear the castle breathing magic. While he walked, his mind wandered. He desperately wanted to know why he was having such a hard time falling asleep.
“No, Harry. That’s not true. Wands that don’t belong to a wizard simply don’t work. He would either be blowing things up every spell he cast or he simply wouldn’t be casting spells. Why else would your dormmate-Sean? Seamus?-be such a pyromaniac? He’s using his uncle’s wand most of the time.” That got Harry’s attention. If what Draco was saying then Ron was lying about his wand.
"DRACO! DRACO GET UP! WE GOTTA GO, CLASS IS GONNA START!" He picked up a pillow and threw it across the room at the general area of Draco's head and proceeded to search the room for his shoes. Draco groaned and rolled out of bed, literally falling onto the floor.
"What are you chicken?"
They were clouded with lust and desire, the bond was flooded with pure need and Harry happily got on his knees.
"Oh it was rich. He just now came to an important realization and it made him pass out in shock. I'm never letting him live this down!" And try as he might, he could not get another word out of the painting, no matter how many times he tried.
It wasn’t unpleasant, but it wasn’t nice either. Just weird. Nothing had ever gone in that direction before and he wasn’t sure what to think about it. That is, until Draco started moving his finger in and out.
The two were enthralled by how magical Professor McGonagall had made their accommodations. Finally tearing his gaze away from the magnificent view, Harry looked up at Draco. The two smiled at each other and made their way into the living room where they settled into the couch.
"I suppose you're going to tell me I'm nothing but a crybaby and a loser for breaking down like this." His voice was broken, clearly conveying the hurt inside of him. He was amazed to find Draco protesting.
Some time later, he had stopped crying. The pain remained, but it was becoming easier to think through with the sharp smell of grass assaulting his senses. As his mind gradually cleared, he reached out to his bond. It was still there, but it was fainter than it was when he fell asleep.
"Draco?" After the seventh or eighth time Harry called his name, he finally looked from the wall to Harry. The same expression remained, but he took it as a 'I'm listening' gesture. "I'm going to take a shower while you process this okay? It'd be nice to feel hot water instead of a spell for once." Draco nodded and looked back at the wall.
“I hope you don’t mind, but I’m rather curious. The staff and I have noticed you’re avoiding Ron Weasley and I was wondering why. And keep in mind that anything you tell me I won’t be allowed to tell anyone else. Just between us.” Harry hardened himself, preparing for an interrogation.
“Not to worry, I’m just headed for the library for a book on defence. I should be back to the common room in the next quarter hour or so.”
“I don’t care. I refuse to be told I’m going to have a child if I’m not the one making that choice.” She clearly saw the resolve he had in his eyes and smiled at him before motioning for him to continue. “I guess I don’t know enough to be able to say about the finances and estates and stuff. What do you suggest?” She seemed surprised that he had asked her opinion but she gave it nonetheless.
Harry got a nagging suspicion and had to voice his question. He did so before his nerves could settle in.
Harry had gotten so few presents that Draco wondered if anyone cared about him at all. Not even Ron had gotten him anything, but Ron’s mum had sent packages with homemade snacks and Hermione had gotten him a book about Quidditch as well as a small box with several different healing salves, potions and a small booklet of spells for general healing. The note with the box said ‘Just in case’ and Harry smiled sadly.
After a light lunch, Harry bid Draco a good afternoon and reminded him that he would be there in the morning to repeat the training.
"Me? I broke both of your hands at least seven times each! I think you should get a say."
“Uh...I couldn’t sleep again,” Harry muttered. He mentally kicked himself for the ‘again’ slip but hoped that Draco wouldn’t latch onto that little chestnut.
And the worst part about that entire envious monster problem he had-he couldn't say a word against it. He had to abide by the courting rules. He didn't exactly know for sure what the reprimand was for not following the rules, but he shuddered to think of the consequences. After all, the rules had been made long before Dark Magic was considered Dark. Who knew what kind of magic bound them to the rules?
Pansy stood and yelled at her to repeat what she just said and when the insult was repeated Pansy sent a hex her way. She tried to dodge it, but didn't manage to get out of the way in time. Then one of the biggest student fights in Hogwarts history broke out.
When he was finished and dressed he went to the bed and climbed in, barely having time to put his glasses on the bedside table before he was out like a light.
Now everyone knew why Harry went partnerless. They were all honestly afraid of him. Even Mad-Eye Moody at the back of the room flinched at the look he was directing to the newbie. Everyone was thinking the same thing. That newbie must have a death wish, because people all over the Ministry knew about the status quo when it came to Harry Potter. He was the Savior of the Wizarding World, who didn’t take kindly to being told what to do. But clearly this person didn't fully understand the repercussions of what he was doing by defying Harry Potter...or he was suicidal.
Turns out, Harry didn’t need to worry about canceling on Hermione. He sat in the common room for two hours before Ron finally came through the portrait with Lavender Brown in tow. The two were practically glued to one another and Harry sighed. He’d wasted hours of research for his essay due on Monday and Ron was getting it on with some twit.
"Please. I know you don't eat much, but please. For me? I only want to help you." Harry watched him closely and after a few seconds slowly started eating the small portion.
When his breathing was somewhat normal again, Harry looked up at Severus-he was searching for some form of condolence, for someone to tell him it was all right and that he wasn't insane or weak.
"Get some sleep. I'll keep watch." Draco fell on the bed, intent on getting some shut eye. But try as he might, he just couldn't let the darkness take him. After about half an hour he heard voices outside.
“Well-I…” Harry hesitated, trying to remember the last time Ron was a good person to him. It was harder than it should have been, but Ron had been through a lot of hard times lately. “He’s been through a lot lately, but that’s what friends are for. They support you most when you’re having a rough go of it.”
Draco’s contract was rather intense, in Harry’s opinion. Narcissa had taken the stack of parchment and started crossing out entire pages.
"...AND ANOTHER THING! I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT ISSUE! YOU NEED TO SUCK IT UP AND DO IT! Or are you just that chicken? Because if you can't do that, then how the BLOODY HELL can you finish the one thing you ALWAYS wanted to do?"
They went to a curious bank filled with slightly scary goblins and endured another sickening form of transport before Harry was blinded by the gold in his vault. Having been told his entire life he wasn’t worth anything, he only took a few pieces, but conceded easily enough when the professor tutted and filled a small pouch.
And when Draco Malfoy was determined, he always found what he was looking for.
He named her Hedwig.
Draco had only sent one sentence with the food simply asking if Harry would stay at Malfoy Manor for the remainder of the summer. Harry mentally thought about his options. On the one hand, yes he desperately wanted to spend the rest of the summer literally anywhere but here. One the other hand, he didn’t want to be a nuisance.
Draco was hastening ahead of him, practically on the brink of running when he shouted something suspiciously close to “Alcohol!”
He woke up with a start, his member throbbing hard under the sheets. Draco’s voice was suddenly in his mind, husky and filled with desire. Jesus Harry, don’t make a promise you can’t keep. He sent back his confusion, settling into the pillows more. You bloody well know what you did. Would you really let me tie you up… The rest was just a tidal wave of lust.
“But that’s not the coolest part,” Ron continued for her. “See, most of those creatures have a mate right? Someone they can be with forever. Takes all the guesswork out of a relationship. Plus a lot of them have extra abilities.” Harry just rolled his eyes.
He took a particularly large gulp of pumpkin juice and suddenly saw the dining room at Malfoy Manor. Specifically, he saw Narcissa smiling at him. Juice flew over the table and Harry choked, causing the picture to vanish. That couldn’t have been his imagination, he was sure of it.
"Harry..." Draco's voice was raspy, and it scratched his throat as his vocal chords struggled to say his name.
“So what are the rules of courting then?”
“Y-yeah, happy Christmas to you as well.”
“That ought to last you for your supplies and a few galleons as pocket money if there’s time left over and for the train.” He thanked her and they continued looking for school supplies.
“I’d give just about anything to see his eyes open right about now.” He looked back at his mother. “I owe so many in Hogwarts an apology. Do you think any of them will accept it?” She nodded, and assured him of it. People did change, after all.
He loved hearing Draco laugh at the things he did. He loved being large enough to finally not have to worry if he was going to snap in half. He loved having somewhat of an appetite back. He loved every little bit of it.
"Mission X is a major mission in which not very many people know of. Possibly only five or six people know about it and I know only me and Kingsley know the entirety of it's details.
"I wanted the same thing once. And...I guess it's time you had the whole truth." Upon seeing Harry's confused expression, he continued. "I wanted someone to hold me at night, and someone for me to hold when they're upset. I wanted another man, someone who would understand. And I fell in love without realizing it. We both did when I was set free from Azkaban.
“Headmaster, I need to get to Malfoy Manor. It’s urgent.” He wasn’t even out of breath from the running he had done-he was that excited to see Draco again.
With their shopping done, and Harry now slowly gaining easier control of putting his wings away and unveiling them again, Draco decided that maybe it was time to talk to Harry about mates.
“You haven’t done anything wrong. Weasley’s a bit of a prick, nothing I can’t handle.” The urge to defend Ron welled up inside him, even if a small portion of his mind told him he didn’t need to stand up for him.
‘I do appreciate you sending me food. Honestly, you’d think they’d be more concerned about what would happen if I starved to death in their house. But anyway, I’d better let Ulysses out. He’s getting antsy.
“Oi, my arm’s liable to fall off here if you start dumping things like that!”
"Listen, Harry, this is great and all, but I think that you should sit next to me, not by my feet." Harry took his hand.
Daisies of white and yellow twisted in and out of red, white, and pink roses while lilacs mingled with tulips. An apple tree touched leaves with a cherry tree, and monkey faces dusted the edges of the walkway of field grass. A bunny hopped from one place to the next calmly whilst birds of all sorts flitted around, flirting with the birdbath and mist from the elaborately simply fountain.
"No, we've got nothing but trials for either people to remain in Azkaban or execution. It's nothing that'll let them get away. I don't need you until Monday."
"It is. But it's good for you and necessary. So down it fast because it needs to be consumed." He motioned for Draco to follow him and walked outside. He walked around, occasionally stomping on the ground. He said it was to find the right amount if firmness. Eventually, he was content and motioned to Draco.
It wasn't long before Sev was walking through the door and Harry jumped up to meet him. After a hug and some pleasantries, they sat down to some red wine.
“Oh don’t worry about it dear. Your father and I talked about it and we decided you don’t need to follow through with the ridiculous Malfoy traditions. It’s really too much pressure to be putting on someone so young. Honestly, I can’t believe I wanted to teach you about it when you were younger.”
"Look, are you sure you want to watch this entire process? After all, it is a bit lengthy-" Harry cut her off.
“Harry, I was worried when Hermione said you ran from the common room instead of meeting her in the library.” Draco sat down next to him and Harry took a deep breath to calm himself down.
“Why would you even ask that? You’re a bloody great friend!” Draco must have sensed Harry’s disbelief because he continued after a moment. “Look, I don’t have many friends. Acquaintances, yes. Friends? Not really. In the time I’ve gotten to know you, you’ve done nothing but exactly what friends are supposed to be for and more. I don’t think you understand just how amazing of a person you are.” Harry shrugged and looked towards the sky to watch large puffy white clouds drift along the grey expanse above them.
Both men groaned as Harry’s fangs sank into the pale flesh. Blood rushed into Harry’s mouth and Draco whimpered as the venom raced through his veins once again. Harry was done after a few mouthfuls and healed the wound before looking into Draco’s eyes.
“Of course it bloody well bothers me! I keep hoping that he’ll come around and that he’ll even out and maybe that’s true but I haven’t seen it happen yet! And that sucks! I know he’s capable of being a really good person and a wonderful friend but he’s so wrapped up in his own little world that he doesn’t care to be a better person. I keep thinking that maybe if he spends enough time around me that maybe he’ll start being better, that he’ll learn by being around it all the time but…”
"So what do I owe you the pleasure of, Malfoy?"
Draco held onto Harry as they soared through the halls to their rooms and landed. He readjusted Harry in his arms, cradling him and walked through the entrance to their rooms.
"Draco. Since almost a year ago you were put into my traineeship, I have grown to trust you and get to know you like I never imagined. I saved your life and the baby's when I had sex with you, but then I decided to do it right.
"Draco?" He realizes that Harry was trying to get his attention and stopped in his ranting. He was losing steam anyway.
"Wait a minute-how do you know I don't have allergies? What if I died because I couldn't breathe?" Draco chided himself silently for making the brunet feel bad, but the feeling didn't last long.
“But I don’t think that will happen. I’ve got to try, though, or what kind of person does that make me? The kind that gives up on everyone? I don’t want to give up on people, that’s a horrid thing to do.” Draco reached out and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
He opened his eyes only to find himself staring straight at Draco Malfoy.
He went willingly, but Harry saw a flash of worry spark through his eyes.
Harry woke up thinking it was six-the time he needed to get up by if the both of them were going to make it to class on time. He just didn't look at the clock like he normally did.
"I...Nevermind. It's stupid."
“I’ve never woken up this well rested before. Or without waking throughout the night. Whatever you did helped a lot.” Draco chuckled.
“I am the only one allowed back here, and Mr. Malfoy says you have some...special fitting requirements, yes? No need to worry, I’m sworn to eternal secrecy as to who needs to be fitted for what.” Harry blushed, and looked at Draco.
Don't underestimate your enemy.
He drank his fill and licked the wound until it healed over. The inside of his mouth tasted like Draco and as they declared their love for one another, orgasms ripped through both of them. Bright light flashed in their minds, blinging them as raw pleasure coursed through their bodies and their bond.
He turned and made his way to the hospital wing. The bags around his eyes had caught Hermione’s notice that morning, and he wasn’t about to let it happen again without seeing Madame Pomfrey first so she couldn’t lecture him again. He took off the cloak and turned the corner while hoping that he wasn’t going to be disturbing her too much.
"Whasgoinon?"
“I presume you had something in particular that’s on your mind?”
"I...I was just a kid! I didn't understand what was doing on back then. I was just rejected friendship by the most famous wizard ever! I was hurt and I did what I was taught to do. I'm sorry for ever doing it." Draco put the canvas down and walked into the tent with his head down. While he walked away, he could hear his older sister start to talk.
He knew why and he wasn't sure it was good.
"Not sure whoever is on your neck is exactly pleasant."
"I was planning on spending the day cleaning. Why?" Draco shrugged. He didn't mind much, and had given Harry the choice to pick what they did. He especially made sure that Harry didn't feel pressured. That was a task, but apparently unnecessary as he still wanted to stay home. They remained there for quite awhile before Harry spoke, a nervous and worried edge to his voice.
Harry apparated them to his cottage out in the country and Draco breathed in the clean air. That night they spent making love and chocolate chip cookies together.
“Harry!” She hastened over to the bed, smiling at him. “You’re at Malfoy Manor. When Albus approached us about keeping you here for the rest of the summer I was delighted to accept. I was hoping I could apologize, on behalf of the entire Malfoy family, for the way we have acted in the past.”
She really wasn’t that difficult to find. In a rare turn of events, she was wearing a large pair of baggy velvet pajama bottoms and a tight long sleeved cotton shirt. Draco’s jaw nearly hung to the floor when she didn’t start shrieking about how he couldn’t see her in such a state and to turn around. She wasn’t even wearing shoes-not even a pair of slippers!
Draco had to think about that one. Sure, there were attractive people at school, but he wasn’t attracted to anyone specifically.
“More like I was restless and didn’t want to be around Crabbe and Goyle any longer than necessary today. Their stupidity is going to rub off on me one day if I’m not careful.” They chuckled and Harry went back to watching the snow outside.
"You didn't scare me..."
“Your parents were particularly gifted and although neither one had received an inheritance, they were extremely powerful together. And since you are a product of them both, I am worried about your wellbeing this summer. Your aunt and uncle are not kind to anyone of this world, I can only imagine what they would do to you should you receive an inheritance there.” Harry flinched. It was a move his friends wouldn’t have noticed it was so subtle, but you couldn’t sneak anything past Dumbledore’s shrewd gaze.
He didn't want to spend the night in giggles-he wanted to spend it planning their next date.
"What if something happens to me? How can I contact you?" Harry stared but kept his confusion to himself.
Bits of food were everywhere, strewn about the Hall as if there had been a giant food fight. Harry hadn't been too interested, so Draco just took him back to their dorms and levitated Harry onto his bed. He pulled out a pair of pajama pants and laid them next to Harry before going to his own room and putting on a pair of silk ones. Coincidentally, they had been the same color.
Eventually she paused and turned to Draco.
"Potter...Sorry. I'm just trying to get to my...POTTER! Move, I have a very important meeting to be attending." Harry sighed. Not only was he mad because of idiotic newbies, but he was also ticked he was getting yelled at for something he attempted to prevent. And it wasn't like Malfoy had been offended at first, only after he realized he had run into him specifically. Apparently he was destined to be hated my Malfoy forever no matter how many times they would save each other’s livesl.
"Oh I beg to differ. He's usually very well behaved, if not a little perverted. I don't know why he's decided to be such an arse lately."
