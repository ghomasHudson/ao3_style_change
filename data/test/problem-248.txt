Draco collapsed into the chair, dropped the crutches, and wrapped his arms across his chest. He thought if he just kept staring at the opposite wall, he could ignore how fucked up he was, and this tent was, and the world was.
“Damn it, Malfoy, don’t bring all that up again. No-one thought I was actually going to manage it, you know, so you were only being rational.”
He lifted his head off his knees and looked towards the door of the cell. He felt drained as always after an attack, and wanted nothing more than to curl up in a corner and attempt to feel somewhat normal again. But he had to find Potter. The world didn’t give a damn about him feeling ready or not.
“Then I think… I think the best thing to do is to offer your full cooperation to the aurors.” His father sounded resigned. “Tell them everything you know. It should help them capture and get convictions for much worse offenders than you. It will give you something to bargain with for leniency in your own sentencing.”
Myrtle settled again near the foot of the bed, bobbing upwards slightly as she gave a theatrical sniff. “You haven’t been to see me for
“Yeah! It was her I thought of, you know, just before I, before he - and every night in this fucking tent, I’d look at her little dot on the map - I just thought, you know, that we’d, that we were meant to - oh, it’s so fucking stupid. I’m not supposed to be upset about this! I’m meant to think about Fred, for God’s sake!”
There was a sound like Peeves hitting the wall. Draco could no longer see beyond the lattice of branches.
had already poisoned him, at his request! He was already dying a year before that, from that curse that burnt his hand up. Look, Dumbledore arranged his own death, okay? He had it all planned out. Even if it had been you - if you’d cast the
Lucius turned back to look at him. He lifted his right arm, and Draco did too, and they clasped their bleeding hands together as if they were about to have an arm-wrestling match.
Potter was now literally trying to tear his hair out. To hell with whether it was appropriate or not, Draco couldn’t let him just sit alone like this. He scooted over, the blankets coming along too in a tangle around his legs, got in as close as he could to Potter’s side and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. Draco felt his own eyes prickle as Potter choked and curled tighter in on himself, his whole body juddering with misery.
Well. Let it never be said that Malfoys didn’t have manners. “Thank you, Potter.” And then, because of the bloody Path spell, he added, “I’m really quite confused about why you’d be nice to me, but I like it.”
movement of the neck, you must lie absolutely still! Do you think it might be possible to apply the restraints now that you are awake and able to consent to it?”
Draco couldn’t stand it. She just looked so sad. He rubbed her back in small circles and met her pleading gaze, unable to speak, and he watched as she read the truth in his eyes. He watched her hope disappear.
Draco fumbled with the cloak fastening, suddenly embarrassed to be wearing it. It was warm enough in this room without it, anyway. He slipped it off his shoulders so it lay on the back of the armchair. Still, despite the slight humiliation, it was getting easier and easier to talk to this woman. It was nice to meet someone who knew so little about him, he realised. She seemed to have assumed that he was on the winning side in the war and he wasn’t about to correct that assumption.
The man stood only three steps away, framed in the same doorway that Draco and Prudy had come through. It was his dear old uncle, Rodolphus Lestrange, wearing torn, blood-stained robes and clutching a bag stuffed full of what Draco recognised as silverware and various expensive heirlooms.
Draco shivered. Now that Frona’s magic was no longer bathing him, he could feel the cold of the dungeon against his bare skin. He reached behind him and picked up the cloth that had been cushioning his head. It was his shirt and the remains of his singed and filthy school robes, which he pulled on again eagerly. The dirty fabric felt disgusting against his skin, but it cut out the worst of the chill.
Draco nodded, and slowly eased his left foot onto the floor. He was able to touch the sole of his shoe down with no ill effects, but as soon as he actually pressed rather than hovered, the cramping gripped his calf. The pain radiated all the way down to his heel and up to the back of his knee. Draco gripped the desk tightly and couldn’t help the way he hissed, squeezed his eyes shut, and tensed. He couldn’t even reach down and knead his leg with his knuckles to help ease them faster.
Draco just looked at him, and knew Potter was thinking something along the same lines: that this connection felt strangely profound.
“Dobby!” She wailed, and flung herself forward across Draco’s chest, clutching at his hospital gown. He kept rubbing her back helplessly as her entire frame shook with almost-soundless sobs.
Potter hesitated, and then sat down on the edge of Draco’s bed. Draco wondered for a moment why he hadn’t just taken the chair placed right by the bed-side, but then realised it was so that Draco could still easily see Potter’s face without having to move his head.
She frowned crossly, but reached up and grabbed his hand in her small one. With her other hand, she dragged one finger an inch along his skin. Draco flinched slightly, but it didn’t even hurt that much. His leg was worse. A shallow cut had opened, enough for a few beads of blood to rise to the surface. He wiped his hand across the wall in front of him, wincing as the rough stone caught the cut. Immediately, the stone melted away to form a rough archway.
“Well, Malfoy, looks like, astonished as I am, having a Death Eater around is going to be of some use today. It’s your time to shine!”
As they came through the gap the path widened again, and Draco caught his breath at the sight before him.
For several long minutes he sat questioning whether this could really be the obscure piece of kindness it seemed to be. He ran his fingers over the parchment and felt the tightness in his chest ease, as if loosened by a sort of warmth. It appeared that, no matter how unbelievable his conscious mind found it, his subconscious felt fairly sure he could trust Potter and his unshakeable, ridiculous nobility.
The elf was shaking her head back and forth so hard her ears flapped. “Prudy is forbidden to harm wizards and witches - ”
Prudy instantly stopped crying and beamed. “Now that Master Malfoy is the head of the family, Prudy will be very happy to serve him!”
The paint was flaking from the door in large curls, but the serpent door-knocker still managed to look imposing. There was no handle to turn. This house was only intended for wizards, after all.
He turned the handle, pushed open the door and did his best to stride in confidently, if striding was possible using only one leg.
“Yes, I will. Thank you, Potter. And I’ll even put my money in the pocket of these jeans rather than in my money pouch. It’s a lot less secure when it isn’t underneath a layer of robes, anyway.” He deposited a handful of mixed cutlery on the table and eased himself back down onto the opposite bench to Potter, before reaching into the bag and beginning to sort out the little plistac and foil boxes.
The stiff black fabric of the chair creaked as he sat down. His cloak made it a little slippery to sit on. He sat with rigid posture, unable to relax. He thought about picking up the top magazine, but it didn’t look at all appealing and anyway, his breath was beginning to come short again. He worked to keep it silent in this quiet room so that the rude receptionist woman wouldn’t notice. He didn’t dare look directly at her, but he thought that he wasn’t imagining the glances she was giving him out of the corner of her eye. What did she think of him? He knew his discomfort must be obvious and he wanted to cringe.
He was in no shape to go anywhere. Fuck. He would have to lie here, flat on his back, and wait for Peeves to come back and finish the job at his leisure. His breathing immediately started to speed up. He cast about for something wooden, so he wouldn’t be completely defenceless, but there was no wood within reach - the bedstead was metal.
The red light shot directly towards him and Draco flinched - but the spell never hit him. Potter stared at him, looking stunned himself. Draco carefully laid Prudy on the table and used one hand on the table’s surface to support him as he limped around it until he was facing the three people under the tree. Distantly, he knew that the compulsion driving him forwards was the tea doing its work. He fell to his knees in front of a nonplussed Potter, bowed his head, and said, “I have wronged you. I beg your forgiveness.”
Draco took a deep breath. “It aches a little, pretty much all the time. If I put any weight on it or even move it too quickly, it cramps up. It takes about a minute for the cramp to subside. I was using crutches to walk around.”
- to let Draco know that he wouldn’t be asking him to talk about things he didn’t want to? Draco reeled. It fit, it felt right, but it made no
She swooped away and back again, seemingly too overwhelmed to stay still. Draco followed her progress with his eyes, wishing he could turn his head. It was now evening, and the sun was low enough to pour directly into the room. Myrtle all but disappeared in the golden swathes of light.
He needed to cut himself, but he didn’t have a knife. He considered asking Prudy to fetch a kitchen knife, but he didn’t want her going anywhere alone before they knew that the rest of the Manor was empty. “Prudy,” he whispered to the elf at his feet. “Can your magic cut me?”
“They’re not my - oh, whatever, Malfoy. You’re coming back to your cell, right now. Then you’re going to answer our questions.”
The granite of the basin was rough on his skin as he dragged himself along the edge of it, and then he was where the spell demanded him to be. People must have noticed him by now, but he could not hear them beyond the rushing in his ears.
“ - but today is a day for firsts, Potter, and if I can talk to a muggle and survive, then I’m sure I can figure out how to put plates down on a flat surface.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Yes, but you don’t need to tell us every waking second of the day, Harry. You know, it’s okay to admit that you’re attracted to him.”
the first time draco came to harry, he felt an unexplainable ache tearing at his chest. really, harry didn’t know why he felt hurt. him and draco were friends–
and as if realising the sudden weight of his own words, harry ran, not caring about the way draco shouted after him.
blaise snorts. “you could literally go up to him and tell him you’d want him in bed and i think that git would say yes in a heartbeat.”
if anything, things weren’t improving much either on harry’s side. he still thought draco was courting someone else which was already painful enough. hermione and ron certainly wasn’t of any help either. to top it all off, harry still had to give draco advice and hear him talk about that stupid git like he had climbed up on the moon and put stars in the sky.
"I'll get all my things out by the end of this week." Harry had said, before grabbing his wand and his coat and walking out of the door, out of
Harry turned over to Ron, clearly looking for some sort of backup on this. Ron just gave him a guilty look.
him and draco were sitting on top of the astronomy tower and harry had to listen to the other boy talk about his dumb crush again. harry had to listen to the slytherin talk about the boy like a lovesick idiot, harry had to bear with the stupid ache in his heart, harry had to bear giving advice to draco day after day and watch as draco got happier by the minute (seemingly, because every advice harry gave worked.
was. it didn’t help that ron and hermione weren’t helping him trying to figure it out. they just kept on exchanging glances with each other and laughed to themselves.
Draco knows the starting signs of a failing relationship, he had seen it countless times before. In his parents, at Hogwarts, outside on the streets as he passes by a fighting couple. He knows the signs of people falling out of love, of people not being as enamoured with their lover as they were before. When the light starts to dull in their eyes, when the smiles don't quite reach their eyes anymore, when the 'I love you's start to seem more forced than genuine.
Maybe it was the fact that Harry’s heart was beating so fast that he could hear it or maybe it was because blood was rushing and pounding in his ears so quick that made Harry dizzy. He could feel the nervous energy radiating off Draco as he tilted his head ever so
” Hermione glared at Ron as he rubbed over his stomach where Hermione clearly just elbowed him. “– But, you do talk about him an awful lot. I’m just saying, it’s not such a bad thing if you like him. He’s changed.”
They were perched over a rooftop sitting on conjured chairs. There was an awkward silence that hung in the air between him and Malfoy, and it wasn’t until Harry had made an exceptionally loud noise trying to open a bag of nuts that Malfoy broke the silence.
Harry looked up at Malfoy who was currently picking at his quill again, biting the tip of it. His eyebrows were furrowed, the way it always is whenever he’s concentrating or something. A strand of his hair fell over to his eyes and the sunlight from the window was hitting Malfoy in all the right places. He looked–
“i didn’t want to court you the normal pureblood way because i know you don’t like dramatics and so i thought asking you on ways to court you would be a good idea.”
started playing from the radio and Malfoy turned around to face Harry, his face split into the biggest grin Harry had ever seen. “Blaise got into muggle music lately, said this would be the appropriate song choice for when I, inevitably, win our bet.” Harry grumbled and glared at Malfoy. He could hear people clapping around him and waiting for Malfoy’s next move.
draco smiled before getting up and brushing the grass off his robes. harry ignored the way his heart swelled when draco helped him up.
He was sitting in the living room, a wine glass in his hand. Pansy had come over in a hurry, trying to stop Draco from reading the latest edition of The Prophet. Blaise and Theo had followed after her, holding Draco back as he tried to snatch the newspaper from Pansy's hands.
and a light blush on his cheeks, asking harry “how do you court someone without being dramatic and over the top?”– well, harry couldn’t quite say no, couldn’t he?
His eyes rake over the article on the front page, once, twice, three times, before his wine glass drops from his hand and shatters onto the ground. From the corner of his eye, he sees Pansy flinching but that's about the least of his concerns right now. Not when Draco's heart feels like it's been ripped out from his chest and stomped all over. Not when tears are prickling at the corners of his eyes and his vision's blurring and his head is spinning. Not when Harry and the Weaslette's happy faces are planted on the front page of the Prophet, a bejeweled ring shining on her forth finger.
Hermione and Ron were clearly messing with his head, trying to butt into his life just because he’s single while everyone else around him was getting hitched.
Malfoy had skimmed Harry’s outfit from top to bottom, making Harry a little bit insecure if he was being honest, and smirked. “Very nice outfit you have there, Potter.”
“Antoinette Dolohov, sister of Antonin Dolohov. You’ve heard of him, haven’t you, Potter? Famed death eater, currently rotting away in Azkaban–“
Summoning up his courage, Harry took two decisive steps towards Draco, cupped his face with his hands and pulled him into a kiss. The angle was awkward– seeing that Draco was a tad bit taller than Harry– but Harry’s heart soared at the fact that he was finally kissing Draco again. It took a while but soon Draco was pressing his lips back and was holding onto Harry’s robes as if it was his life.
and as harry smiled and grabbed the pale boy’s face into his own hands while leaning in, as draco met his lips halfway and
draco had only smiled before shaking his head. “no. not yet, at least. but you’re pretty witty, aren’t you potter? you could figure it out.”
the next resort draco could come up with were granger and weasley who he wasn’t exactly on the best of terms with. and so, as much as he didn’t want to, draco met up with the two a week later.
, he could certainly get over a certain grey-eyed, platinum blonde haired boy. “i’m in love with you, draco. i can’t do this anymore because i’ve fallen in love with you.”
“Yes, well, try telling the entirety of Wizarding Britain that and we’ll see how that goes, shall we?”
They stood alone in the elevator together, the tension high between them. If Ron was here, he would’ve tried to get out as quick as possible. If Hermione was here on the other hand, she would’ve pushed the two together and forced them to work it out. Harry took a deep breath, summoning up what’s left of the courage he has and turned to face Draco.
They pulled away after a while, gasping for breath, and Harry leaned forward, resting his forehead against Draco’s. “I want to be with you, Draco.”
Malfoy motioned to Antoinette, who had her wrists bound and was getting her fingerprints magically extracted. “Couldn’t have done it without you, Dolohov! Send your brother my regards, will you?” She promptly glared at him before spitting on the floor. Malfoy chuckled.
“you like potter, don’t you?” pansy had asked him one day when they were both in the slytherin common room, a book in draco’s hand. draco’s eyes had widened before he huffed, feeling his face grow hot. “is it obvious?” there was no point in trying to hide it from pansy anyway. that girl knew him inside out which annoyed draco sometimes, knowing that there’s nothing in his life that pansy wouldn’t find out.
Malfoy seemed to try even harder to make Harry really have the worst date ever– he prepared a choir who followed them around Diagon Alley for approximately 10 minutes chanting
this earned harry a surprised look from draco, who had now turned around towards harry. “harry.. are you crying?” it was only then that harry realised the wetness of his cheeks,
harry’s heart lurched with happiness. “thanks, malfoy.” draco smiled, dismissing it as if it’s nothing before asking him if they could walk together to potions.
– her eyes twinkling. “Oh, Harry! This is great!” she said. “I’m sure you’ll have lots of fun! Maybe you and Malfoy can finally come face to face with your feelings!” Harry refused to talk to Hermione for the rest of the night.
through Diagon Alley in his hideous robes which garnered a lot of stares and hushed whispers. Malfoy, on the other hand, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself as he strolled along Diagon Alley beside Harry. He was dressed in another one of his posh robes which was extremely well-fitted and hugged his arse perfectly– not that Harry was staring at it or anything. When they eventually made it to the Leaky Cauldron, Harry was horrified to find Seamus, Dean, Zabini, Nott and even
Draco can't pinpoint where or when he went wrong, when Harry had realised that Draco was not a person who was deserving of love. He had done everything right too- had tried to his best capabilites- he had apologised to Granger and the entire Weasley family, had gotten down on his knees and apologised, had apologised to Andromeda, had kneeled for hours on end in front of the Weasley twin's grave, Sirius', Lupin's, Tonks', Dumbledore's and had apologised and begged for forgiveness through sobs. He had tried his best to understand Muggles and Muggleborns alike, had tried to his best ability to restore the Malfoy name, he had donated to hundreds of charities and good causes anonymously, Draco had tried his damned hardest to show Harry that he didn't make a mistake in choosing to love Draco. How could he have been so foolish? So stupid? No amount of apologies or donations could undo the hurt and pain he had caused upon so many people, it could not undo the things he had done and the things he had said. He knew this and yet he had stupidly let his guard down, thrown out all his Slytherin self-preservation abilities. He had foolishly believed Harry, had foolishly let himself hope that maybe,
“it’s just that... pansy and blaise suggested it and at the moment, i thought it was such a brilliant idea. i guess i didn’t think about how you would feel.”
Harry laughed, an actual laugh, that startled Draco. “Since when do you care about what the Prophet thinks? That’s your reason? You kiss me, then decide it was a mistake because you’re scared of what people will say?” Harry could feel himself starting to get angry, his tone rising higher in pitch.
draco had sounded so soft, pleading. and harry felt his chest tighten. he took in the way draco’s cheeks looked a bit sunken in and the way draco’s eyes looked a bit redder than usual. harry pushed away the urge to pull the boy in for a hug.
Draco opened his mouth to say something and then stopped, as if he was contemplating whether it was the right thing to say. Alas, “Mine is green.” he whispered.
as professor mcgonagall had suggested, harry and draco became friends now that they weren’t at each other’s throats constantly. harry would join draco at the library sometimes as they studied, there were some insults and light banter thrown here and there, but the two knew there weren’t any malicious intent behind it anymore. even parkinson and zabini had started warming up to the rest of them, which was a huge shock considering how hostile the two had been to the other houses at the start of the year.
It’s two years and three months into Draco and Harry’s crumbling relationship when Draco finally comes to terms that it–
Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Him? Attracted to Malfoy? Sure, Harry found him attractive now and their snarky banter actually amused Harry whereas it would’ve annoyed him if they were still at Hogwarts and maybe Harry wasn’t completely opposed to the idea of holding Malfoy’s hand and snogging him and waking up with him in the mornings–
How could Draco not have noticed? The late nights, the weekends away, Potter smelling like women's perfume-
“how? how do i court him?” draco asked, his voice soft and meek. pansy’s eyes softened. “do it the way you’d normally court someone? maybe a little less over the top, though. i don’t think dramatics are potter’s thing.”
Draco isn't stupid, he knew this would happen eventually. Who could love an ex-Death Eater? Who could love
harry noted the way draco’s eyes instantly lit up at the mention of the mysterious boy. he saw the way draco smiled, the way his ears turned pink even in the dark. “good, i think. i took your advice and gave him his favourite food the other day. it went well.” harry smiled, that familiar sting in his heart returning. “that’s good.”
With all his baggage, and his faults, and his insecurities, and his problems. He had foolishly let Harry in, had foolishly believed that this could be different, that Harry's sweet nothings and promises were true, that Draco was still loveable even after everything,
harry was on his way to potions when draco had caught up with him, a box in hand. “potter! here!” draco shoved the box into harry’s hands. “what is it?” draco only grinned. “treacle tart! didn’t spot you in the great hall today, so i packed some extra for you. you like it, don’t you?” harry only nodded, fighting a blush from spreading across his cheeks.
This leads to them a few hours later standing outside a chip truck waiting on some chips for him and Draco as he fishes out his emergency stash of cheerios for Teddy to eat before they head home.
“Don’t be stupid.” Draco says immediately, but he follows it up with, “But I am right about this. Let me be with him today Hermione without any of yours and Weasley’s bloody interference.”
“Protego!” the intruder shouts back almost at the same time Harry casts his own spell, and as a result he is forced to take a few steps back.
Blaise is silent on the other end. Draco picks absently at the carpet while he waits for Blaise to respond.
“Well Andromeda needed a break for the weekend, so Draco and I thought we’d take the weekend off and spend it with Teddy.”
The conversation drifts to safer topics, and Harry let’s his mind drift again. The visit draws to a close as night begins to fall, and Narcissa hands Draco a present before pulling him into a long hug and whispering in his ear. When they break apart Draco’s face is a perfect mask. But, once again, Harry is good with disguises and recognizes both the relief and fear that are at war beneath it.
Malfoy leans in closer, having noticed the 6 players eavesdropping on their conversation, “You’re the one who wants this thing a secret, so you’d better stop staring at me instead of your players.”
He can feel her glare trained on the side of his head, but he makes no move to acknowledge her or move from his position.
“Yes Mr. Malfoy, I suppose that is all, you may go and I’ll send one of the house elves to show you to your room at the end of the day.”
He sits back and rubs his eyes, not wanting to reenter the bad head space but knowing he hadn’t really gotten out of it. He hasn’t had a nightmare like this in a while. And he certainly hasn’t had one that’s woken Draco up before.
He’s in the Forest of Dean again and in the pond, but instead of Ron coming to save him the locket twists tighter, and the water gets colder. He. Can’t. Breathe. He kicks his feet harder against the water but he feels himself being pulled down into the inky pond. His toes touch slimy plants at the bottom-
And there’s the million dollar question. Harry hasn’t told Draco this, and he’s not ready to tell Draco this, but he can’t deny Ginny the truth when she so clearly already knows the answer. And he can’t lie about Draco, has never been able to lie about Draco.
Smiling, he lays back in his bed and thinks about how in just two days time he’ll be in his bed at Hogwarts. With this happy thought in his head he drifts off into sleep, and for the second night that week has no bad dreams.
“Well maybe they should.” Hermione says, crossing her arms and looking across the room to where Ron and Harry are standing in the corner talking lowly.
“Of course we deny it Ginny!” Harry says, sounding a bit shocked and exasperated, “It’s a load of bollocks, anyone with half a brain can see that.”
“Barely.” Harry groans, stretching slightly before wrapping his arms around Draco. “What was that about?”
Harry smiles at the wicked grin on Ginny’s face, happy to see something so like the old her shining through. Before he can say anything, he feels Draco come up behind him.
Malfoy continues to ignore him but Harry goes on anyways. “I have Christmas gifts for all my other friends that I’ll give them when we see them at the reunion in a couple weeks, but I might need your help.”
Harry can feel himself blushing and stammers out, “I don’t think so Malfoy. I’ve got a baby to take care of.”
“Well in that case I can help you with the homework.” Malfoy makes to stand up, but Harry is already leaving.
Malfoy scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Yes because that’s totally your business Potter, and we always share where we are going and who we’re meeting?”
“Of course.” Harry says immediately. “We’ll be the presidents of the Ginny Weasley Fan Club, I’ll make posters and everything!”
Draco’s eyes meet Harry’s, and Harry can see the relief at being distracted evident in the slouch of his shoulders and thumb brushing along the back of Harry’s hand.
Groaning even louder, he throws the blankets off and stumbles towards the sound of one of the phones. His eyes are barely open and he searches blindly through a pair of pants and fishes out a phone.
Malfoy flushes, and begins packing up his books. “Fine Potter. If you’re struggling to focus there’s no point in me lecturing you. Let’s meet Granger for dinner.”
Harry nods quickly, and gently pulls Draco with him, even as the other boy argues over his shoulder with Ron.
“Good heavens Tilly, again?” Narcissa is already exclaiming as she enters the room. “Go to the kitchens and fetch another and don’t-”
Draco looks at him for a moment clearly weighing his options for what to say. “She works for the Daily Prophet as an editor. So I thought I’d ask if she had seen anything concerning our little situation at Mungo’s. So far nothing’s crossed her desk.”
One of the regular baristas greets him. She’s a face he sees often during his late night work sessions here. She’s one of those artistic types with pale silvery blue hair and a septum piercing in her nose. She’s probably only a little older than him, and judging by the copious amounts of eyeliner being used to hide the enormous bags under her eyes, is probably a college student just trying to keep up.
Malfoy snorts again, Harry idly thinks he might change Malfoy’s name in his phone to the amazing snorting ferret.
It’s a quick note, the ink blotching in places from how quickly she must have been writing. All it says it, “We love you, Harry. Bring Draco round for dinner tonight.”
As the mother and son whisper quiet greetings to each other, Harry picks out more gray hairs on Narcissa’s head. He notices lines creasing her forehead that weren’t there the last time they spoke. He sees that her hands shake slightly when she pulls Draco in for another long hug.
But when the reporter says, “And what are your plans for the future, boys?” Harry draws a blank and Draco steps in.
She cuts herself short as she sees first Draco standing un-moving in the center of the room, and then Harry kneeling on the ground and struggling to pick up the glass.
Draco rolls his eyes and mutters a charm to heat up the eggs and sausages on his plate before turning to Harry. “It won’t kill you to dress up, Potter.”
Malfoy’s mouth is very close to his ear when he whispers, “I know for a fact that I’m what you’re thinking about right now.”
Draco slowly pushes back the blankets and moves with careful precise movements to sit on the edge of the bed in front of Harry.
“Don’t kill any of your housemates Potter, they likely wouldn’t appreciate it and I’d get the blame.” Malfoy murmurs this so only Harry hears.
Ginny is the only one who keeps eye contact. She looks at Harry consideringly before dragging her gaze to Draco still eating potatoes off his plate. Harry isn’t sure what she’s looking for, but seems to find it, nodding once before turning to say something to Bill.
Harry shakes his head and scolds himself for thinking he deserves any better than what he’s  got. He survived and that should be enough, right? But he can’t help wanting more.
“Do you want to go to Hogwarts is the real question here, Potter.” Malfoy responds neatly sidestepping Harry’s question.
Harry sits with this for another moment, thinking that Malfoy might be just as messed up as him. After all, he has a reputation as well, it just isn't the kind that prompts starry gazes and autographs.
“Sallow came by.” Narcissa mentions, glancing carefully at Harry and then back to Draco. “He’s threatening to go talk to your father about all of this.”
Harry looks at Malfoy entreatingly, practically begging him to introduce himself. Malfoy seems to get the hint because he takes a small step forward and holds his hand out to  Andromeda.
Harry actively decides to close his mouth before answering, grabbing his wand and slipping it into the pocket of his jeans. “Ready whenever you are.”
“You get one too Draco. I wouldn’t wear it just yet around Ginny, but you’re a part of this family as long as Harry wants you to be.”
He’s gotten used to Malfoy too. He’s gotten used to his snark, the twist of his mouth when Harry says something he thinks is funny but doesn’t want to admit to. He’s memorized what makes Malfoy’s anxiety act up, and knows which dessert he likes best (chocolate mousse).
Groaning, Malfoy looks at Harry and then says, “You do know that we’ll be living together right? Torturing me this early is only going to make your life miserable in the long run.”
“I was thinking more quidditch and the feasts, but sure, we can pretend I was thinking about the study benefits too.”
“Professor, I would hardly call opening the doors of a shed breaking in.” Harry replied, not ready to admit the real reason he was there.
With that being said Harry definitely notices heads craning in his and Malfoy’s direction. He subconsciously shifts closer to Malfoy in an attempt to shield him from the various stares and sneers. Malfoy looks at Harry in some confusion as their thighs press together but doesn't make a move to shift away. Out of nowhere a shout cuts across the hall.
After showering Harry meets Malfoy at the Slytherin table for dinner. Malfoy’s hair is pushed back and still wet from the shower but he doesn’t seem to care as he is pouring over the notes he had taken at practice.
Malfoy pulls away first and rests his forehead against Harry’s, a slight smile on his lips. Harry thinks he might be dragging his jumper through his eggs.
But the smile gives Harry pause. The secretive smiles when no one is looking and the bruising kiss in the cupboard suggest to Harry that there is something more to Malfoy’s affections than just messing around.
Harry is struggling to keep his eyes open after a while, and knows that he’ll never hear the end of it if they sleep on the couch, so he brushes his fingers gently over Draco’s jaw and mumbles, “Bed?”
And so it hadn’t. Blaise had told him he didn’t think he was gay after all, and Pansey had asked him to go to the Yule Ball with her. So he did.
Harry almost misses the slight smile that graces Draco's face as he watches the lions roam around, but luckily he looks back at him at just the right time. Harry turns away before Draco catches him looking and grabs the other present he has for Draco.
She searches in her calendar for a moment before saying, “Excellent. How about Saturdays at 1:30-2:30?”
“If you’re talking about Hermione and Ron I’m assuming so, if you’re talking about Ron and I, well let’s just say that Ron really isn’t my type, too much like a brother.”
Harry slowly opens his eyes and picks at a loose thread on his jeans, searching for a way to answer the question without sounding like he most decidedly has not thought about it. Hermione has asked him about this before, and he knows it’s her way of making sure he’s all right.
Harry looks at her once and shakes his head. But before he can say anything Hermione says, “You know, Ron said he would be here if I needed his backup, but really I think he was glad to get to spend time with Draco.”
Without a word the elf had apparated away and about ten minutes later returned with Andromeda and Teddy in tow. Teddy was crying after the apparation, but Kreacher calmly took him in his arms and into the kitchen, leaving Andromeda with Harry.
Malfoy flushes a bit at the question and turns away slightly, “My feet get cold.” And then more confidently, “What’s your excuse for the total abomination that are your pajama pants?”
Draco focuses back on the potatoes and lets the steady flow of conversation around him, fade into background noise. When he finishes the potatoes, he stands up and hands them to Mrs. Weasley before turning back to find Harry standing in the doorway talking to George with his hand extended backwards for Draco.
“And how is it that you’ve come to know that Mr. Malfoy when Potter here still seems rather confused by your conclusion.”
Harry laughs and Draco’s eyes open to watch, “It wasn’t that bad, Draco. Admittedly, I could have gone without jerk-face Sallow coming along at the end, but it’s been a good night.”
Draco looks down and sits silently. Harry is rather tired of people being so shitty to Draco and tiptoeing the fuck around him when he is right there.
Another silent and stiff moment passes before Narcissa finally looks over to her son, “Well let’s sit down, I’ll have Tilly bring us some tea and sandwiches.”
When they get to the Starbucks, Harry orders their drinks while Draco grabs their normal seats at the back. Marissa’s familiar face grins at him when he gets to the register. Her trademark silvery blue hair is now bubblegum pink.
“No Hermione, I really don’t. Ron’s the one who came in here and started the whole thing, why don’t you ask him.” Harry says impatiently.
Harry smiles at the sight, normally Malfoy drooling on anybody would be fuel for weeks of teasing, but all Harry feels is a small warmth growing in his chest.
The house elf drops to her knees to clean up the mess, Harry darts forward to help and the elf’s eyes grow wide as she hears Narcissa walk in behind her.
“Yep she’s pretty proud of you from what I can tell,” and without thinking he adds, “You have some explaining to Malfoy to do though, he was right pissed when he heard you’d abandoned him on those projects.”
It takes a moment for Ginny’s words to make their way through the alcoholic haze in Harry’s brain, but when they do he can’t stop the smile spreading across his face.
Harry tells her, Draco joining in in the conversation to show her his new socks. Ron makes his way over at some point and argues with Draco about the merits of various quidditch teams, and who he thinks is going to make the playoffs.
Harry thinks for a second before saying, “So you called me? Weren’t you supposed to be having dinner with your mom tonight?”
Harry had been watching Malfoy’s reaction to Hermione and taking note that he had flushed when she accused him of being oblivious to other people. He wonders why Malfoy gets so upset about people calling him oblivious. He then realizes that Hermione had asked him a question and turns to answer her.
They finish their food relatively quickly, but sit at the table for a while after drinking tea and talking about where they want to go shopping. Draco says that there aren’t many people he has to shop for, and almost all of them require going to Diagon Alley or Hogsmead. They both agree not to head there today, but rather get some of Harry’s shopping done in Muggle London.
He’s gotten so used to it that he misses it like he’d miss his arm or his leg should he wake up suddenly find it missing.
“Potter,” he says between gasping breaths, “I would pay good money to have seen Chang demolish you in public.”
Now that Harry is a registered Auror, he could begin work immediately if he chose, but being the contrary little shit that he is, he refuses to go into the field without Ron by his side. This leads to Harry stubbornly sitting in on the uncomfortably long lectures, taking notes (no matter how messy), participating in lessons, and doing all the work. All done just so he can prove that he actually deserves his certification.
“If it’s what you want, I’m sure Mcgonagall could make some adjustments to your curriculum and I could help you catch up probably.”
“Okay, I’ll think about it.” Harry says, letting go of Draco’s hands in favor of putting them on his hips and slipping his thumbs under the hem of Draco’s jumper, “Can we kiss now?”
Chuckling, anger forgotten, Harry grabs the plush grey fabric of Malfoy’s arm, and together they apparate to Hogwarts.
Harry turns to see a gobsmacked Mcgonagall looking at the three of them. It appears that the commotion at the front of the room had been a student running to get Mcgonagall. He shrugs in response. Hermione makes a sound in the back of her throat that has Harry and Mcgonagall turning to look at her. She’s crying and looking at Harry and Ron in shock. Harry decides to try another answer.
Malfoy grunts his consent from the other room and Harry hears him shuffle towards the bedroom with the door clicking shut behind him.
This train of thought is promptly derailed when Malfoy pushes Harry backwards onto the couch. Harry looks up at him, startled. He and Malfoy have certainly gotten physical before when their  arguments have gotten too intense, but Malfoy has never pushed him quite like this, with a fiery look in his eyes, and his lips red from where Harry has been kissing them.
Harry rolls his eyes, “You’re so over dramatic, you weren’t drinking at Hogwarts when you were dealing with us.” and then adds, “Are we walking, or apparating.”
“Hmm.” Harry says, pushing his nose against Draco’s neck. “I’ll just wear something of yours, that way no one can say I look like shit.”
She moved him into her home temporarily, insisting that is was no hassle and that she would enjoy the company. Mostly she let him be, but slowly she started asking him to help with Teddy. Running the bath water, mixing up his baby carrots. The small tasks interrupted his dark thoughts, and it was difficult to hate the world when a perfect smiling baby laughed up at you, hair the colour of violets, grass, or sometimes the night sky.
He takes a breath before continuing, “But it’s also my house, and I figure you can make pretty much any venue enjoyable. Hell, I even enjoyed myself when we got stuck on the tube for 4 hours last week. There are enough rooms in Grimmauld Place that we could get away from each other if we wanted, but it would also be our home. I don’t want to go back to not seeing you every day.”
Draco’s eyes had drifted shut at the kisses but shoot open at that and glare at Harry, tension returning full force to his shoulders, “Of course I did. I wanted her to want you there, I wanted her to say she loved me. Not loved me despite of me loving you, but that she loved me full stop.”
“You like it then?” Harry asks, pulling Draco closer and slipping his fingers under the hem of Draco’s jumper to be on bare skin.
Harry knows that this is the moment to ask Malfoy what this thing means to him, so he sits up slightly and pulls out from under his arm a little.
Harry tucks this information away and says, “I’m sorry that happened to you.” He runs his finger along Draco’s cheek, “It should never have happened to you.”
The mere thought of Malfoy makes his heart speed up. He lolls his head to the side to stare in Malfoy’s direction once more.
It comes out accusingly but he doesn’t mean it to. Hermione stops what she’s doing and turns to look at him.
The last part is yelled, ringing in the big room. He tries to not take Ginny’s rage too personally, after all she’s working through a lot too. He looks at her and then down at the floor, “No Gin. It had to be him. It is him.”
Harry had grown quite fond of his snitch pants, they even came with a matching jumper, but Harry REALLY doesn’t think it would help his situation if he tells Malfoy about it.
Hermione’s voice is a normal occurrence in his ear, so it helps Harry orient himself with the here and now.
But it’s hard to feel hopeful when the Daily Prophet still picks apart his every move. When his ex-girlfriend now attends therapy 2 times a week. When Harry can barely get 8 hours of sleep without waking up at least once, plagued by Voldemort’s eerie taunting and Fred’s body on the floor of the Great Hall. Is someone as ruined as him even meant to have love?
Harry feels warmth flush his chest and steps in between Draco’s legs before kissing the other boys forehead lightly, “And you’re telling me that I’m the sweet one in this relationship?”
“How’d that go?” Harry asks, finally looking up, worried that Draco went back there by himself and absently playing with the end of Draco’s tie.
“Harry, you just called me Harry, for the first time like… ever.” He can tell he’s smiling, a great big shit eating grin that he can’t seem to get rid of.
Harry smiles and claps Neville on the shoulder. He turns back to find Draco sitting on a street bench with Luna and Teddy, attempting to feed Teddy some of the peas while Luna holds him. Harry smiles at the sight.
Draco looks back down at the menu, seemingly noticing for the first time both the prices and lack of edible food for babies.
Draco is silent, and before he can think of a response Blaise says softly, “I’ve got to go, I have work in the morning. I’m sure you’ll be fine.”
Draco nods and makes to get up when Harry’s hand is suddenly in front of him offering to pull him up.
Harry looks up to see a frowning Malfoy pointing a wand at his face. Harry glares, and reaches to push the wand away, but Malfoy tuts and shakes his arm away from Harry.
At first Harry doesn't realize what Draco is saying, but with a fair amount of horror Harry realizes that Draco is saying he knows what the cruciatus curse feels like.
He holds the powered off phone up to his head, and breathes out, clenching his eyes shut as he does.
Without waiting for a response Harry turns on his heel, and before he knows it, is staring down the lane way at the crooked old house he knows and loves.
He smiles slightly, before turning his head to press a kiss to Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy’s breath hitches, and Harry’s smile widens.
With the pressure of school getting to Malfoy, and Hermione shooting them questioning looks whenever they’re in her line of sight, Harry is desperate for the weekend to come.
With effort Harry looks back up at Draco and notices that Teddy isn’t in his high chair anymore. Food is sitting in front of him but he has no recollection of it getting there. There are dishes in the sink that weren’t there before.
Draco catches Harry’s eyes flitting over the sweater and sees a change in his face, but it’s gone before Draco can fully process it.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand once but doesn’t ask for details, knowing that Harry will tell him when he’s ready. And Harry doesn't really want to talk about it anymore, he’s done enough talking and emotions for today. He just wants to eat food and go to sleep and have some semblance of a normal night with his boyfriend.
Harry crosses the kitchen and takes the pop out of Draco’s hand and replacing it with a bottle of orange juice. Draco scowls slightly but lets it happen.
It starts slow. Calm in a way that doesn’t normally happen on Christmas day. They laze about in bed, trading kisses and a mug of tea between them. They stay in their Christmas pjs but with ugly Christmas jumpers that Harry insisted they buy on top. Draco’s hair is a complete disaster after Harry runs his hands through it so many times, and Harry is certain that his doesn’t look much better.
Narcissa has not changed much since the last time Harry saw her. She still dresses herself in the same dark green dresses which compliment her tall figure and emphasize her small waist. She holds herself with the same confidence and air that comes with being raised a pureblood and knowing that people stare when you walk into a room. When she hugs her son Harry can point out their resemblance, the same pointed chin and pale skin, the same high cheekbones. Yet, he also notices where they contrast, Malfoy’s long delicate fingers against her rough stout hands. Draco’s grey eyes full of emotion, hers a carefully controlled blue void.
“What are you playing at, Malfoy?” He says sitting on the end of his bed and rubbing a hand through his hair. He knows he sounds tired an irritable and that Malfoy doesn’t deserve that. But he can’t help it, his brain is still a little foggy with lack of sleep.
Afternoon comes sooner than Harry is expecting and he and Draco apparate over to Andromeda’s, hopeful after last night when Teddy didn’t kick up a fuss.
“Shit,” Harry says, his hand groping for Draco’s under the blanket, “That’s all they have though right? Pictures?”
“Okay.” He murmurs into Harry’s hair. “If you don’t mind being seen with me, I definitely don’t mind being seen with you.”
There’s silence again and Draco leans his head against Harry’s shoulder. As much a comforting weight as it is a way for Draco to take comfort himself. Harry watches Ron track the movement of Draco’s head, before flitting his eyes back to meet Harry’s.
Harry feels Malfoy freeze slightly at his side before he drops Harry’s hand. Harry glances to him questioningly while trying to answer the question, “No no, he’s just one of my friend’s kids.”
Harry rereads that last letter and glances over at a still sleeping Draco. He taps the letter absently against his leg before setting it down for consideration later. He turns his attention back to the two unopened letters. Harry hovers over them both, not sure what they contain and hoping that they’re both supportive.
“Alright Ron, I’ve gotta go. I’ll text you later.” Harry says, already focusing on Malfoy instead of the conversation.
To his surprise, it’s Draco who answers. “No Potter. It’s a bunch of bullshit that is an attack on me for corrupting you.”
Harry thinks this is an incredibly important question and gently turns Malfoy’s face towards him before breathing one word in answer.
Harry desperately wishes Hermione would stay, but he nods when Ron asks her to go. Clearly, whatever Ron needs or wants to say is something he’d rather only Harry hear.
Harry snorts and looks at Ron, “Grounded is the word I’d use, but sure less broken works too I guess.”
Draco gasps, before tossing the socks to the side and crawling in Harry’s lap, “Take it back! The slander! I’ll never recover from the indignity of being associated with you.”
“You look nice.” Harry comments, “I was gonna wear sweats but if you look like that I suppose I should put in some effort.
Harry grins crookedly before leaning in and pressing a quick kiss to the corner of his mouth, “I don’t mind.”
Harry visibly grimaces at the memory, he could still feel the stares of his fellow customers as they eagerly watched Cho tear into him.
The two boys wake up some time later, and blearily pull on sweats. Draco’s hair is an absolute disaster, but for the first time ever he doesn’t seem to care. Harry runs his hand appreciatively through the mess and Draco’s eyes close, clearly enjoying the feeling.
Just as this thought enters his head, a hand gently brushes along the back of his neck. He jolts and whips around only to see Harry sliding into the chair next to him.
“Yesterday was really hard for him, it was hard for all of them.” Hermione says, smiling slightly as Teddy toddles over in her direction and reaches his arms up to be picked up by her. “It was good that we were all together though. It would have been nice for you to be there too.”
“It’ll be okay, mate.” He murmurs, low enough that the Weasley’s know not to respond but Harry can still hear.
Harry things for a moment and adjusts a now sleeping Teddy into a more comfortable position. He finally decides that even though it would be faster, the fuss Teddy kicks up afterwards really isn’t worth it.
Hermione nods tearfully and pushing up her sleeves casts the same charm Tonks used on his nose not that many years ago.
Hey guys! So today is the day. The final big chapter for this story. Writing this fic has been an amazing experience and I was completely overwhelmed by y'alls support. This chapter is, personally, my favouite and I know that Brek is really proud of it too. Hope you enjoy, and are staying safe out there<3
Hermione hums slightly in his ear, and he can tell she desperately wanted to pry but is holding back for his sake. They sit in silence for a few moments, Harry gathering comfort from Hermione’s steady breathing on the other end of the phone. Abruptly, Hermione started talking again.
“I got the idea from one of those muggle advertisements about the weighted blankets for anxiety. I figured your nightmares are improving a little with Luna’s help, but this can’t hurt.”
Harry snarls at Malfoy slightly, but its a weak snarl as he’s almost grateful that Malfoy stopped his train of thought. There’s no use being angry with the dead. Malfoy had dropped his hand from Harry’s arm and moved away slightly to allow Harry to compose himself. After getting his grief and anger fully under control he sidles up right next to Malfoy so that their arms were touching. Harry would never admit it, but the physical touch grounds him a bit too. Malfoy raises and eyebrow in silent question.
Both Mcgonagall and Harry turn their heads in Malfoy’s direction, with almost identical looks of confusion on their face. When Malfoy catches sight of Harry’s face turned towards him he rolls his eyes and sighs.
Draco looks into Harry’s eyes for another second before stepping close and using his extra height to brush a kiss across Harry’s forehead, stilling over Harry’s old scar. Against it, he mumbles, “I’ll think about it.”
At this Harry sits up and rakes his eyes over what Draco’s decided to wear. It’s not what Harry was expecting. Draco is wearing dark form fitting jeans that do wonders for his arse, a stylish light grey jumper that looks incredibly soft while also appearing incredibly expensive, and over it, he has a leather jacket that Harry recognizes as dragon leather.
Still breathing heavily and not willing to move out of Draco’s arms just yet, Harry reaches blindly for his cell phone. When he finds it, he searches through his contacts and hits a relatively new number.
Draco looks at it for a moment before setting his phone face down on the table without answering. Harry will find him soon enough. He just needs time to sort through his feelings and compartmentalize a little bit.
Harry just nods, sure that she can feel it. He holds her tight, thankful that he has her back in his corner. The hug breaks and Harry leaves the room, closing the door behind him. And although Ginny had said she didn’t need an explanation now, when he hears something being thrown across the room, he’s sure she’ll need one later.
Draco watches Harry step into his washroom to have a quick shower before dinner, and once the door closes Draco allows himself to panic for a brief moment.
Harry feels his face heating up and shrugs one shoulder trying to avoid the question, “I don’t remember.”
And that concludes the fic! Thanks for sticking with it until the end. Brek and I hope to write more stories about Draco's and Harry's journey, but we'll be taking a break for now. Thank you for reading, we appreciate y'all so much<3
Harry slips his own chain on over his head and settles it beneath his jumper on his skin. “I figured that we won’t always have classes together or be with each other when things get shitty, so it’s as much a present for you as it is for me.”
Harry shakes his head and moves his eyes to Malfoy’s face. “There are other things I’m more interested in focusing on Malfoy.”
Take a peek inside Draco's head to see how he's dealing with being the chosen one's latest charity case
Her face is determined as she says this and Harry feels Draco tense slightly before saying, “Thank you. I understand though, so it’s okay.”
Draco smiles slightly again and gestures towards the sitting area where they try to find seats near Hermione.
After this task is completed Malfoy’s hands are back on Harry’s shoulders, pushing him none too gently towards the back wall. This results in Harry tripping and nearly pulling Malfoy and a shelf full of cleaning supplies to the ground with him.
Draco isn’t sure why the handshake happens, he just knows that Ron is likely doing his best to support Harry in the face of everything. He decides to let it slide without comment and turns to Granger.
Harry isn’t quite shocked by Draco’s reaction, but he desperately needs him to explain why this is bothering him so much.
Malfoy mutters something that sounds suspiciously like “You’re telling me” and Harry steps in front of him, casually kicking him in the shins as he does so.
“Is that such a good idea mate?” Ron shakes his head and rephrases the question, “Do you need me to come with you?”
Before he can think of a response she’s stepping back and hugging her son again. Harry decides to ignore it and takes Draco’s offered hand, not sparing Narcissa a glance before they’re swept into the dark of Draco’s apparation.
He bolts upright in his bed, his sheets twisted around him completely, and the scar from the horcrux burning. He hurriedly pushes the sweaty sheets and blankets away from him and swings his feet down to rest on the floor.
As he is walking, a familiar glint of white blonde hair catches his eye. Harry stops short. Surely it couldn’t be who he thought it was. It was only wistful thinking, his mind had been full of Hogwarts and pumpkin juice, and was grasping for something familiar. Surely he would never deign to set foot in a muggle restaurant, let alone something as common as a Starbucks.
“Oh piss off Harry, you don’t even need to be there if you don’t want to be. Talking to someone who has training to help you after a particularly scarring event is perfectly normal in the muggle world, I’m not sure why you’re kicking up such a fuss.”
The other boy flushes and immediately runs his fingers through his hair in an effort to remove the dust.
The two boys hurry along to Harry’s apartment, being careful so as not to slip on the slush filled walkway.
Harry sends up one last prayer to anything that’s listening and says, “So I wanted to tell you all that I’ve started dating someone. And the press got a picture of us together… I didn’t want you guys to find out in the gossip columns so here I am.”
When they get back to their room, Harry goes to pull out a charms essay that he needs to have done for Hermione and Flitwick, but Draco takes it out of his hands.
Not Kreacher then. But that doesn’t make sense, the only two people who should be able to get inside his wards are himself and Kreacher.
Harry shrugs and says, “Honestly, I’ve never thought about it before… it certainly felt safe at the time.”
“Both of which can wait until later Malfoy.” Harry says lifting the blanket slightly, inviting Draco to climb under.
“Is that why there’s enough food for ten people?” Malfoy questions “The Weasley’s are all coming here to to mock me.”
“You can go back to sleep in the bed if you want,” Harry calls over his shoulder, “I don’t mind. We don’t have plans until later anyways.”
“Wipe that smirk off your face Potter, there’s no reason to look so happy entering a pub full of Gryffindors.”
“What the bloody hell do you think you’re doing in my kitchen Potter? Where did this food come from?”
Even though the Starbucks is directly below Malfoy’s apartment, Harry is glad to enter the warm interior. Rubbing his hands together for warmth, he looks at the sandwich selection in the display case, as well as the drink menu. Malfoy sidles up beside him.
Malfoy rubs his eyes blurrily and grunts something that sounds like “Hello,” but really could have been any number of words. He runs his hands through his hair and stares at Harry through one cracked eye. Harry smiles and pets Malfoy’s hair once while passing him on the way to the kitchen.
“We should probably think about what tattoos we’re getting too.” Harry adds, knowing that topic will relax Draco even more.
That night, when Harry wakes up tangled in his Gryffindor sheets, screaming from a nightmare. Draco pulls his gasping body closer to him, and Harry makes a decision.
Although Teddy fusses at first, not wanting to give anything new a try, he eventually starts enjoying the banana baby food and tolerates the fruit and yogurt one. Harry, although happy that he got Teddy to eat it, sighs when he sees the banana that got into Teddy’s hair.
Draco returns with a pure white envelope but just as he stretches out his hand to give it to harry, he pulls back. “I have to say something before you open this one.”
It dawns on him that Malfoy had been in the middle of a sentence. “Sorry I didn’t catch what you said.”
“What did you expect, Malfoy? There’s a reason I told you to put on muggle clothes.” Harry says, bobbing in place with Teddy as he hands the diaper bag to Malfoy. He doesn’t mention the jeans and the level of satisfaction they bring him. “He hates apparating and the floo network will make him sick. Flying is definitely out of the question as he’s a literal infant. There’s only so many options.”
Harry turns his body to lean against Draco’s chest, and Draco’s arms immediately go up to wrap around him.
When they get to the top Malfoy looks over at Harry expectantly, as if waiting for a laugh or smile. Harry is too deep in his memories though. And although the events of the year before should have been at the forefront of his mind, the memories that present themselves more clearly are the ones from third year. He remembers Ron’s broken leg, him standing wobbly on it when he thought Sirius would try to kill Harry. He remembers Sirius’s laugh when it was revealed that Peter had really been the on to betray Lily and James. He remembers Hermione’s shaky voice when she realized they had attacked Snape. But mostly, he remembers the feeling when Sirius asked him to come live with him. Desperately Harry wishes he could live in that moment again. He misses Sirius with an all encompassing sort of grief. For a moment his thoughts turn to Dumbledore and how he had let so many awful things happen to Sirius before helping him. The old anger rears its head, and for a moment he would like nothing more than to destroy something. Abruptly, he’s shaken out of those thoughts when Malfoy’s hand comes down on his arm and squeezes.
Harry had nodded, understanding because that’s what he sees whenever he looks in the mirror. He can't help but picture everyone who had died; Remus, Tonks, Mad Eye, Collin. The difference is that Ginny doesn’t have to live with that and Harry does.
Harry calls to mind how Malfoy is the only person who has treated him like he always has, most people are either begging for his autograph and swarming him in the streets, or they are insisting there’s no shame in going to therapy. Malfoy has always treated him like any other stupid Gryffindor.
“We are taking what I’ve heard Muggles call a ‘mental health day.’” Draco says, adding air quotes without letting go of Harry’s hand.
He and Malfoy are still laughing and pushing each other, hands pulling at each others robes, when they reach the entrance to the charms room. Hermione meets them outside the door when she hears their voices and she raises an eyebrow at Harry’s hand still holding on tightly to Malfoy’s tie. He slowly retracts his grip and looks to the ground, fighting a blush that he’s becoming all too familiar with.
“Well Malfoy, your shock explains the lack of food in the house. There are these things called grocery stores where food is bought. Surely even rich wizards like yourself need grocery stores.”
“Isn’t it?” Malfoy manages to somehow make this comment sound insincere. Harry glances at him before responding.
Yet, as Harry straightens the movement catches Narcissa’s eye and she turns and casts a semi disgusted look in Harry’s direction. Some things may never change.
The emphasis on the word boy makes Harry dislike this man quite a bit. And he goes to open his mouth to say so when Draco cuts in.
“I’ve packed everything up already.” Draco says, standing up. “And I sent it to Hogwarts with Kreacher. We just have to get Teddy home.”
Harry searches his mind for something that Hermione needs to know and comes up blank, Malfoy is his roommate, his friend, his partner in quidditch training, but none of this is news her.
After the paper is torn off a nondescript black box slips out. Draco casts a confused look at Harry before lifting the lid and revealing two identical gold chains with a circular flat pendant with a snitch etched onto them.
“I know.” Harry says, looking up at Draco’s eyes, “The fact that I know that doesn’t change what happens in my dreams though.”
“As I’m sure you all know, it’s New Years Eve and we’re about 20 seconds out from midnight. So we’re gonna do a countdown and ring in the new year before the music starts up again and the party continues!”
“Oh thanks Harry! I hadn’t even realized I’d forgotten it. This is my favourite one, of course it’s fake leather, I’m all about keeping animals out of the fashion industry.” she exclaims softly.
“Come on.” He says, holding his hand out to Malfoy. “Lets eat some dinner and play with my stupidly adorable kid.”
“So bloody Malfoy is one of the boys now?” Ginny asks scathingly, “What’s next, his very own Christmas sweater to replace the one you would have made Fred?!”
Harry breathes a sigh of relief. Luna is going to act as if this situation is completely normal and Harry couldn't be more glad.
Harry goes to respond hotly but Ron is already holding his hands up in a placating gesture, “All I meant by that is they lost a lot- no. We lost a lot in the war. They don’t get to see you operating with Malfoy. Give them time Harry. They’ll come around because they love you.”
Yet, Harry squints and is greeted with the same pale skin and face made for sneering. About the same height from what he can tell of the person sitting down. Just slightly taller than him. The hair is uncharacteristically rumpled though, as if the owner had spent a lot of time running his hands through it in frustration. And he looks less put together than he normally does, wearing an old knit jumper with the sleeves pushed up to the elbows as he stares at his laptop in focus.
After the first class, Harry rushes back to his and Malfoy’s room and pukes into their toilet. Malfoy finds him lying on the floor hours later and wordlessly sits at his side.
It’s all the same, except the blood splotches that once covered the floor are no longer present. A record plays quietly in the corner, the soft notes of a cello ring throughout the room.
“Fuck.” Draco says, dropping Harry’s hand to lean against the building and press his hands to his eyes, “Shit.”
“What was the whole defending Draco thing about? You and Ron disagree all the time, but I’ve never seen you push back so hard against Ron about a person before, especially Malfoy.”
It’s almost midnight, and Harry finds himself on some sort of makeshift dance floor with Draco. He’s well and truly drunk by this point and happy to cling to Draco and sway to music while other people dance around him.
Harry takes his own lid off his cup to let the drink cool off a little bit. He watches as Malfoy unwraps his breakfast sandwich and carefully peels off the egg before reassembling the sandwich and taking a bite.
Before he has time to ask, he’s swept up by Kreacher apparating them back to Hogwarts. He lands with knee buckling grace in their room and moves to sit on his bed, noticing that they have been pushed back to the original closeness. He doesn’t think he’ll mind this time around.
“Malfoy would you shut up!?” Malfoy closes his mouth and focuses his wide eyes on Harry.  “Hermione wanted to talk to me because she felt it was time that someone explained to me how crazy I am about you, because apparently I couldn’t figure it out myself!” He flings his arms out dramatically when he finishes.
“I’m actually doing pretty well.” Harry says, feeling Draco’s thumb brush softly over the back of his hand, “How was your Christmas yesterday?”
They walk to the shop hand in hand, hair still wet from the shower and wearing relaxed but nice clothes. Harry has a beanie pulled over most of his hair. Draco is wearing one as well, but Harry suspects that Draco looks considerably better in it. He finds he doesn’t mind too much, just tightens his grip on Draco’s hand when he catches some guy on a smoke break looking too long in the other boy’s direction.
A cheer goes up in the crowd and before Harry knows it, he and Draco are shouting the numbers down from ten. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, George and a few others find them on the floor and link arms with each other.
Laughing, Draco takes a step away. “Christ, you’d think he was ignored every single moment of his life with how he’s acting.”
Malfoy himself proves just as distracting as the window situation. First off, he is constantly taking notes and moving. Harry barely lifts his quill in Binns class, but Malfoy never puts his down. His leg shakes relentlessly and he is constantly biting his lip in focus.
“Anyone who spends literally any time with him can tell he’s not happy in what he’s doing. He’s missed Auror training for over a week, and doesn’t seem the slightest bit torn up about it.”
Draco just offers a curt nod, tightening his grip on Harry’s hand while tucking the chain back under his sweater.
It dawns on Harry that if Draco is done then it must be his turn to get a tattoo. Contrary to Draco’s belief, he has done some thinking and investigating regarding possible designs, he just hasn’t picked anything specific. He scrambles for what to ask for, knowing that the poor tattoo artist probably hates clients like him.
Harry looks back to see that Malfoy’s pale grey eyes are full of worry. This causes Harry to turn back to face him fully. He looks at Malfoy for another moment, shocked by the sadness that he sees in Malfoy’s eyes before answering.
“I just thought it was right that you knew,” Harry says firmly, “But, I can disappear from your life if you want me too. I’d get it.”
“It was okay. We went to see my parents in the morning, but we came here yesterday afternoon. It was hard.”
Yet, despite the stiff mattress and goddamn pokey springs, Draco would take that bed with Harry over his family manor any day.
Harry flits his eyes to Malfoy before saying, “I will, but he needs to eat first. It’s almost his bedtime. That’s why he’s so fussy.”
“Could you have made yourself any more difficult to find?” Harry says lightly, before pressing his foot against Draco’s under the table.
Maybe Harry flirts with everyone. Pansy used to be like that, charming boys with her seductive comments, sometimes not even realizing that her smile made people melt.
Hermione’s shaky voice, fills his ear much closer than before. She must have taken it off speaker phone.
Ron nods hesitantly, clearly wondering where this is going, Harry helplessly thinks that the acknowledgement of Ron’s all encompassing nightmares is probably not helping the situation.
Both Molly and Fleur look over at that, seemingly bristling at his tone, but both back down when they see Harry’s grin. Some tension Draco didn’t realize was there bleeds out of his shoulders.
“Uhgh,” he groans, taking inventory. He is very very hungover. The Weird Sisters are ringing from a phone somewhere in the room, and there is a very naked Draco still asleep pressed along his side.
“It was one of my muggle neighbours, they’re saying they need to talk to me about something. I’ll see you later.”
It’s heavier than he expected and he nearly drops it. It’s square shaped and fairly squishy so Harry isn’t sure what it is. He tears off the paper quickly and is looking at an emerald green blanket with a silver snake etched on it.
“It’s definitely just some pixies messing with him, but no matter what I said he wouldn’t listen and insisted on having a security charm set in place, I realize people are paranoid after what went down last year, but bloody hell, all this fuss over pixies?”
“Well,” says Hermione shrugging, “Ron knows all this, I just needed to talk to you without Malfoy. You two are bloody well inseparable. Ron said he’d rather not have this talk with you and would like a few minutes of unblocked access with Malfoy.”
Ron doesn’t look at Harry when he says this, but Hermione does and her gaze is filled with sympathy.
After the end, Harry had been unreachable for a while. Too many people had wanted pieces of him, but he really wasn’t ready to give them up. He was sharp edges and a mean mouth. Unapproachable, yet people insisted on trying to get closer. Ron and Hermione were truly the only people who he could stand to be around, and even then, he preferred to be on his own.
A man in his early twenties is standing in front of them. He’s clearly a wizard who doesn’t often have to dress for Muggle appointments, judging by the way he's decided crocs are appropriate footwear to accompany a suit, so Harry assumes it’s the reporter that Luna sent. Harry stands up and clears his throat, offering his hand to the reporter.
Harry laughs slightly at the memory, remembering Malfoy’s shocked face and scream when he realized that Harry was the one doing it.
Harry leans back against the couch, and grabs hold of Draco’s ankles while waiting for the other boy to hastily tape up the tear in the paper. He rubs circles over the prancing lions and watches the small tree they have sitting on their table sparkle with enchanted icicles.
There's silence across the kitchen so Harry starts doing food train motions to get Teddy to eat. This goes marginally better than it had for Kreacher, and Harry’s so caught up in it that he doesn’t notice Malfoy settle down at his side.
Surely, Draco thought sadly, he had not done anything that bad to deserve being tortured by Harry Potter for the rest of his life? I mean sure, there had been the whole death eater thing, but desperate times call for desperate measures! Couldn’t they boil that all down to teenage angst? Was seven years of pining not enough? Was seeing Harry in ridiculous heterosexual relationships not enough? Merlin, had Draco not paid the price for his stupidity?
He knows, realistically, that nothing has changed, so he can’t pinpoint why it feels like something monumental has happened.
He pushes his hands into Malfoy’s hair like he wanted to do this morning and is pleased when Malfoy sighs happily into his mouth.
“How’d your talk with Weasley go?” He asks abruptly, tearing his eyes away from Harry’s overladen fork.
Harry looks over at Teddy who is munching on some of the cereal he hadn’t gotten to beforehand and thinks. As much as he wants Hermione and Ron to see Teddy he kind of wants to spend the weekend with his boy and his boyfriend. It’s when he comes to this realization that he makes a split second decision.
Dully he notes that his cell phone is ringing. It’s set to some new single from the Weird Sisters that Harry usually finds quite enjoyable, but right now just leaves him feeling annoyed. With movements that seemed slightly separated from his body, he stumbles to his night table where he had left his cell that morning.
“Pretty okay actually.” Draco says, chewing some potatoes before turning his head so that his own nose knocks against Harry’s, “I’m exhausted after arguing with so many people about their atrocious quidditch preferences.”
Taking a deep breath, his heart pounding, Draco opens his mouth and says, “I don’t expect you to like me.”
It’s loud in the kitchen. George walks through the door and Ron apparates in not long after. It’s hectic. Molly is desperately whipping up some food for everyone to eat, Arthur is discussing changes in the Auror lineup with Ron, George is sitting silently at the table, tracking conversations with his eyes but barely contributing. Ginny is still in her room.
Hermione laughs and mutters, “God you’re oblivious Harry.” she shakes her head and lets out a short laugh. “I thought maybe that auror training might have brought you more in tune with your surroundings, but it appears not.” She looks at him in silence, at her wits end.
“Well it’s certainly not good.” She says, stepping back to sit down on the other couch, wordlessly moving a discarded pair of jeans.
This had led to a short argument about Harry’s questionable taste in furniture, which had in turn been resolved by a lengthy snogging session on the aforementioned furniture.
This leaves nothing for Harry to look at besides Malfoy, which he does. Malfoy is slightly taller than him by about a half inch, but with his pale hair hanging in his grey eyes, and a worried look on his face, he seems smaller, and far less intimidating than he used to. Harry realizes that Malfoy is staring right back. They stand in silence for a moment before Malfoy breaks it.
“But I want you around.” Harry says, hearing an edge of desperation enter into his voice. He does his best to quash it before repeating, “I want you around, Draco. I always want you around.”
Hermione looks at him and replies in a tone that brokers no arguments, “No. I need your help with something and I’d rather not involve Draco or Ron.”
“Oh.” Says Harry sitting up straighter and helping himself to some more food. He waits for Hermione to show up and sit down on his other side before turning to her.
“Maybe.” Harry concedes, “But we would have had to have dinner with them eventually. It’s better to get it done now.”
After that, they stumble into the flat without breaking apart, clothes coming off with every step. Harry’s shirt gets stuck coming off and Draco growls something that sounds sort of like ‘fucking nuisance’ before ripping it off carelessly and throwing it onto the back of the couch.
Malfoy freezes from where he was rooting around in his bag. Unconsciously Harry leans in closer to Malfoy and says, “Smart, good looking, insanely good at magic- like could beat me up if they tried hard enough.”
Harry knows Malfoy’s words hold some bite, but he’s also come to recognize that he’s usually snarky when he’s nervous or afraid, so he waits quietly until Draco calms down a bit.
“Could you not?” Malfoy shoots back, crowding into Harry’s space, “Didn’t you grow up in a broom cupboard? Shouldn’t you know your way around it?”
Neville seems to struggle for a moment but finally nods. “Alright Harry, you’ll have enough explaining to do at the next Gryffindor reunion dinner, you don’t need to explain to me too.”
Harry nods and squeezes Draco’s hand before continuing in the direction of the kitchen where he thinks Mrs. Weasley disappeared to. Before he can get there though, Mrs Weasley’s head pops out of the hallway and she beckons with one hand before turning away again.
Suddenly, as if they share one mind, the kitchen falls silent and everyone is sitting looking at Harry. Harry absently wipes his hands on his jeans, Arthur and Molly are looking at him from across the table and Ron claps Harry gently on the shoulder.
It’s lengthier than the rest, but has the same sentiment as Hagrid’s with an added word about it not affecting their schoolwork, and a final sentence that seems to have been written after the rest. All it says in a hasty scrawl is “be careful.”
His hair is slicked back and he’s wearing dark jeans and a pale blue button down shirt. He eyes the plate of fruit and pops a strawberry in his mouth before looking into the fridge for something else.
“I’m so glad you could be here today Harry, and you too Draco. I know it wasn’t a very warm welcome last time you were here, but you matter to Harry so you’re going to matter to us too.”
Harry looks around and grinning like an idiot makes to stand up, but Malfoy’s unruffled facade cracks and he grabs Harry’s sleeve forcing him to sit down again.
“I mean we can pop over if you guys are at the apartment, we haven’t seen Teddy in ages! He’s probably getting so big.”
Harry hears Hermione sigh before answering. “It was going to be a surprise before Harry ruined it. I’ve tested out of everything already so I’m helping Professor Flitwick with his charms classes until the end of the year. Just marking and stuff.”
“But maybe,” a quiet voice in his head says, as Harry’s face flushes slightly, “Maybe his heart is pounding too.”
Harry squeezes Draco’s thigh and then picks up the baby fork again, spearing a strawberry as he goes, “Of course I’ll come with you.”
Harry had said of course at the time, but is now wondering if maybe she just needed time to mourn during the first Christmas without her daughter and husband. Either way, they’re at the Weasley’s now and Teddy is excited to see more people.
“Listen Christine, I’d love to catch up but I need to feed Eugene here and it’s awfully cold out. I’ll talk to you later.”
“Morning to you too, Malfoy.” Harry says, squeezing tighter for a moment before releasing him and turning back to his pancakes on the grill.
“It’s perfect.” Draco says, planting a kiss on Harry’s neck before leaning back and slipping the chain over his head and gripping the pendant.
“Hermione,” he starts, “it’s just that it’s Luna. She’s my friend and she's friends with everyone I'm close to, I just don’t feel comfortable baring my soul for her alright?”
Harry laughs again, and lets Draco take his hand and lead him over to the bar. Harry crowds into Draco’s space as they lean against the bar and wait for Tom to pass a drink to Draco. He doesn’t particularly care if anyone sees because they all already know, and he rather likes the way that Draco’s hair feels falling against his nose.
Groaning Harry takes a step away from Draco, “Fine. But I hope you know I’m gonna complain the whole time.”
“I’m almost one hundred percent sure you’re wrong on that, but okay.” Harry shoots back, leaning slightly to get a good grip on the package in front of him.
Harry considers it, and would rather do that than go to the manor, but also knows that putting off the inevitable will just make it harder. It doesn’t help that Draco looks like he’s going to combust if they don’t see his mom soon. The other boy will never say it, but Harry knows he’s slightly anxious to be bringing Harry home to visit with his mother for the first time.
He knows it’s a weak comeback, and Malfoy knows it when he turns to his own bed with a teasing smirk on his face. Harry turns over in his bed and gets the lights.
Draco looks at Hermione coolly. He has never divulged his emotional state with her before and he isn’t going to start now.
Malfoy turns to Harry with a disbelieving look on his face and shoves his shoulder in retaliation. Harry nearly plants his elbow in his macaroni salad. He turns back to get even, but not before catching a slight smirk on Hermione’s mouth as she looks at where Malfoy had pushed Harry’s shoulder. Wondering what that’s about, he turns back to Hermione to ask her why she’s looking at him and Malfoy like that, when she abruptly gets up.
Draco freezes, and leans back to look at Harry in the face. “I hate your flat, it's disgusting even by muggle standards.”
Ron catches Harry’s eye as Hermione squeezes onto the bench next to him, and Harry gives him a quick close lipped smile before lowering himself onto the bench next to Malfoy.
Harry doesn’t jump like he would have a few months ago, but he does somewhat throw himself in front of both Draco and Teddy, reaching for his wand and finding his pocket empty. Panic rears its head, but a steadying hand on his arm from Draco brings him back to the street outside the chip truck facing down two of his friends.
Afterwards Harry goes in search of Malfoy. He finds him in the bedroom, looking uncertainty at one side of the bed and holding his bag.
Harry grins and turns back to his team. “Alright, we’re gonna scrimmage with the Slytherins, don’t do any serious harm or you’ll sit out the first game got it?”
“Essentially, that she wasn’t surprised, she just wished that I had picked someone that wasn’t you.”
He leaves out the sharing with Malfoy part, not wanting to turn the conversation in that direction again, though he feels that somehow Hermione will find out eventually.
Of course, breakfast is the best part of the morning. The sausages and porridge he eats distract Harry from the fact that he has literally no clue what any of the professors are saying. He understands some of it, but is struggling to remember his lessons from sixth year. It certainly doesn’t help that Malfoy and him sit by the window each class. Harry can see the quidditch pitch and Hagrid’s hut all morning. Both of which he would much rather be at than in History of Magic.
Harry chuckles a little and rubs the back of his head, “Sorry, I know. I hate being asked that too.”
“Hello all.” She starts. Harry casts his eyes around for her, before shrugging and leaning back against Draco’s chest.
Draco smiles softly at Harry and says, “I went to class but it was a spell I already knew so asked if I could be excused.” Breaking eye contact with Harry he looks at Luna, “Hello Lovegood, good to see you too. Thank you for last night.”
Finally, Harry turns to look back at his friends. Hermione looks sad, and Ron looks unhappy. “What should I do?” He says simply.
He lashes around for his wand and is on his feet in a matter of seconds. He registers the shock on Draco’s face before anything else. His mind is telling him to lower his wand but his body won’t listen.
Your guys's comments and kudos mean the world to us and makes writing this even better:) Thanks for sticking with us so far, we hope you enjoy this chapter<3
“Well, he’s certainly not who I would have picked for you to be with, but as long as you’re happy dear, I can be happy for you.”
“I can disable the charm for now if you want Harry. Or you can tell me where we are and we can go from there.”
“What do we have on the docket for today Malfoy?” Harry asks, swinging his leg over the bench and sitting down.
Harry notices the use of Potter, but decides not to mention it for now. Instead, he joins Draco in his blanket pile, allowing Draco to pull him down so his head is resting on his chest.
Harry shrugs, not ready to tell Malfoy what happened, and how he’d become panicky at any prospect of falling for him. Malfoy looks at him for another beat before scoffing and shoving Harry away.
He hastily puts his phone in his pocket and slides onto the floor beside Teddy. He doesn’t want to worry Draco any more than that nightmare probably has, so he tries to look as unruffled and calm as ever.
Harry misses Hogwarts with an all encompassing sort of pain, but he also knows that he can’t go back. Not yet anyways. He isn’t ready to see the place where so many people died. He follows this train of thought for a while before realizing that Hermione had asked him something.
“I’m telling him you said that!” Draco says, looking triumphant for a moment before his face falls into worry. “She wanted to see both of us?”
“How are you still cold? You’re literally under five blankets and also me, and we had warming spells on us on the way back.”
Draco wants a time turner so that he can go back to his fourteen year old self and explain to him that all his feelings were valid. That eventually he would end up with Potter, who somehow doesn’t mind his snark and stupid drink orders.
Harry starts forward again, and gets a handful of floo powder before Mcgonigall interrupts once again.
Once again, your guys's support is amazing! We never thought we'd get this many comments or kudos, so thank you for supporting us and our little story. Hope you enjoy this chapter<3
“No,” Harry says, looking at Draco’s face he realizes that he knows what he wants, “I think I’ve got this, but you can’t look until it’s done.”
Harry smiles into it, but Draco breaks it off fairly quickly, “Have you decided what you’re going to get tattooed?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face falls slightly and Harry realizes his misstep when George walks past silently with a drink in hand. Before Harry can apologize, Draco squeezes his elbow and Mrs. Weasley is called to the kitchen by Bill.
“Alright,” Ron says moving in to hug him goodbye, “We’ll see you then. And don’t stress too much about this Harry. My family adores you, their love is not something you need to worry about.”
He has another week before Christmas though, and tonight he and Draco are going home to Draco’s flat where they’ve agreed to spend the holidays together. Harry had suggested his place, but Draco flat out refused, saying that he was not spending what little time off he had sleeping on the world's most uncomfortable bed.
As he turns to leave, Luna pulls him in for one last hug. He feels her lips next to his ear as she whispers so only they can hear “I don’t know if Hermione’s mentioned it but I’m always here to talk Harry, you know I’ve received the proper training and you’re one of my closest friends. It wouldn’t be a burden, no matter what your brain is telling you.”
Harry quickly shrugs on a shirt and pair of pajama bottoms before venturing out into the cold world outside of Draco’s bed.
Harry is laughing uncontrollably at the look on Dean’s face as he watches Seamus and Draco both race to finish their pints, and laughs even harder when Draco slams his down first and yells, “You lost Finnigan! That means you’re buying the next round!”
“No, Harry says, struggling into a pair of boxers from the floor, “But we know the pictures are out, so what?”
“Can we just apparate home?” Draco asks, his teeth chattering in the cold, hair falling in his face, damp from the rain.
Draco’s mind hums happily at the contact, but he forces himself to sneer and say, “What, is walking in a straight line to difficult for you Potter?”
Mumbling, so he can reclaim at least some of his dignity, Harry says, “The socks are still fucking ridiculous.”
He sinks onto the corner of his bed and fishes out his phone from his pocket. He sees a message from Blaise wishing him luck for tonight, and hovers over it for a moment before opening the other unopened message on his phone.
When Harry doesn’t say anything Malfoy looks at him again and says, “You weren’t serious right? You aren’t actually babysitting are you? Who do you even have to babysit?”
With that Draco stands up, grabs his book bag from the end of the bed and walks out of the room without looking back.
Harry stands looking at the floor for what feels like an eternity before Malfoy squeezes his arm once and says, “Thank you Potter, I’m sure that must have been hard.”
Now Blaise was on the other side of the world. He had gotten out. Gone to Canada, or somewhere equally as ridiculous. He was the only person in the world who knew who Draco was, and he was gone.
“Alright mate, talk to you soon. And Harry,” Ron adds just before they hang up, “I’m really glad you told me about Malfoy. And I’m honestly happy for you.”
Harry moves his eyes from Narcissa for a moment to glance over in Draco’s direction, but the other boy is already crossing the room to stand at his side.
Draco closes his eyes, feeling the knot in his stomach ease slightly at the brush of Harry’s fingers through his hair and against his scalp. He feels Harry sink into a crouching position so that their faces are level, but he doesn’t open his eyes.
Gasping slightly he glares back at Malfoy who just kicked Harry’s ankle in retaliation to the shin kicking, but Malfoy is looking at Mcgonagall as if nothing is wrong. Harry turns back to Mcgonagall, and catches Malfoy smirking out of the corner of his eye.
“That’s rubbish.” Harry scoffs and then jostles Malfoy’s shoulder with his own, “After all you were supposed to hate me and now I’m like your best friend.”
Harry does indeed know that Ron had wanted Malfoy locked up. They’d argued about it before his trial. Harry had disagreed saying that Malfoy was just a boy like them, who had had a fucked up family. Ron saying that him and Harry had both made conscious decisions about right from wrong and so had Malfoy. Harry maintained the idea that Malfoy was merely trying to survive just like the rest of them, and had told the court that. Harry wonders idly if Malfoy knows that Harry had provided testimony against his imprisonment. Probably not.
Harry had agreed at the time and was now spending his time waiting to see Luna by remembering the feeling of Draco’s lips on his and trying to breathe through the panic of having to talk about things that he’d much rather forget or pretend hadn’t happened.
Draco seems to be holding his breath while Harry speaks but exhales slowly at the last half of the sentence.
When he hears Draco’s hiss of breath he says, “We could always move into my flat at the end of the year if you’re that set against going back to yours.”
Without looking for Harry’s reaction, Draco sticks his head back into the sitting room where everyone is still talking to one another.
Malfoy and Ron are sitting across from one another, and appear to have been studiously ignoring each other before the arrival of Harry and Hermione.
Malfoy scoffs. Harry looks up to see Malfoy already staring at him in something that looks like confusion.
“It means,” says Draco, maneuvering Harry so that he’s standing directly in front of Draco with only a few centimeters between them, “That I knew her and my father weren’t crazy about me being gay, but that she could have said worse things than she did.”
Harry swallows and Malfoy looks on with disgust, his eyes following the food down his throat before flitting back to Harry’s eyes.
Draco hums along to the music with his eyes closed, and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen anything so beautiful. He tucks his head into Draco’s neck and allows himself to be pulled even closer.
He wonders if maybe he loves Malfoy enough, but honestly the idea of loving Malfoy terrifies him. What would people say? The wizarding world would turn against him, and even though he has Hermione and Ron in his corner he really doesn’t want to ostracize himself from the only world that he’s ever been able to call home.
Immediately, Draco’s arm drops in an attempt to give Harry space if he needs it. Harry just shakes his head, and crawls back into bed. He looks back, confused when Draco doesn't immediately follow him.
“What’re the plans you have for today?” Draco asks, leaning against the counter after grabbing a soda from the fridge and popping it open.
“I lived with the Dark Lord for a year, Potter.” Shrugging his one shoulder, he says, “It was inevitable that it would happen at some point.”
Harry lowers himself into the chair across Teddy and picks up the bowl and spoon. Teddy looks at him with big crocodile tears in his eyes, and Harry tries a spoonful of food.
At the beginning of the year Harry was lost. Tired of going through the motions, tired of being Harry Potter. But the last few months have proven to be entirely worthwhile. He’s started working through his nightmares, an agonizing process that will undoubtedly be helpful in the end. He’s back at Hogwarts for one final year, and he thankfully isn’t dodging death eaters and snakes while he's at it. And to top it all off he’s got one fine looking Slytherin by his side for it all, someone who Harry is glad he gets to call the love of his life, Draco Malfoy. He’s proved to himself that maybe being Harry isn’t so bad after all.
The house elf shuffles a short ways down the hall then disappears with a loud snap and Harry is left standing by himself in the corridor. Hesitantly, Harry reaches for the handle to find that it feels completely normal and cool in his hand. He opens the door to find Malfoy lounging on a couch and already looking at him.
But being on your own isn’t always great for someone who is spiraling. He stopped eating and barely slept. His mind was too busy with thoughts of bodies littering the corridors for simple things like food or sleep.
Draco looks up at that and Harry is a little shocked by how vulnerable he looks. “It’s going to be dreadful. I’ll be dreadful.”
Harry, who was about to defend his honour, suddenly would much rather focus on the leg touching him underneath the table.
The air is sucked out of the room at that but George doesn’t seem to notice and keeps talking, “Like I said, I’m trying to be happy for you. But I just can’t. Give me some time. I need some time with this.”
His close friends had understood when he had abruptly moved to Muggle London, but that doesn’t mean that they never worry.
Maybe it’s the alcohol that’s giving him all this courage, but Harry suspects it actually has more to do with the fact that Draco makes his heart race more than anything else ever has.
That forces Harry’s eyes open, and clears his head of the buzzing. “The photos got out today didn’t they?”
“Rita Skeeter got pictures of me out with someone, and she’s going to publish them, and I thought it would be best for you to hear it from me first.”
Harry takes a sip of drink but almost spits it out when Draco says, “Already assembling the guest list to our wedding, Potter? I think that’s a bit premature.”
Harry is puzzled by the letter for a brief moment before he recognizes Andromeda’s shaky handwriting on the front. He tears into the letter eagerly hoping for some more recent pictures of Teddy, instead he finds a quick letter asking if he’s free for the weekend to watch Teddy.
She looks at him for a second and says, “I’m doing okay. I’m seeing someone to help with the whole grief thing, and I started flying again so the Holyhead Harpies have asked me to try out for their lineup in the spring.”
Laughing Harry grabs Malfoy’s arm and pulls him down to the bench. Malfoy tumbles into Harry’s side before ripping his arm away and righting himself.
“Ever since that dreadful article was written about you boys there have been reporters just outside the gates begging for a comment.” She flips her long hair over her shoulder. “Obviously, I haven’t given them anything, I just hope you boys aren’t being harassed as much.”
Harry shakes his head and continues silently tapping away at his laptop. Malfoy sighs as if Harry’s presence greatly inconvenience him, but allows him to remain where he is. Neither boy comments on how different the situation would be if they were at Hogwarts. Glaring at each other across the Great Hall from rival houses. Instead, they simply type away in harmony, each focusing on their own task. After a couple of hours Malfoy begins packing up.
Harry nods and starts jogging in the direction that the other pair had been heading. The Muggle streets are crowded with the dinner crowd, but sure enough he spots Luna’s bright head of hair right outside the door of some restaurant called The Elgin.
“Ya, I think it went pretty well. If Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are down I’m gonna ask them to scrimmage with us too.”
“I’ve been better, Granger.” He says, letting her work out what that means herself, and making to cross the room to stand at Harry’s side again. He doesn’t mean to be short with her but, this visit is driving his anxiety through the roof and Harry makes him feel at home.
Harry refrains from saying that where he really pictures Malfoy living is a gothic manor surrounded by a moat filled with dangerous creatures for sacrifice. He’s incredibly proud of himself for his self restraint. Malfoy seems hesitant to answer, but also seems to know that Harry won’t leave him alone until he tells the truth.
He feels like he is hyper fixated on Malfoy’s every action. The hand on his thigh, the delicate movement of his wrist as he gathers food onto his fork, the quirk of his mouth that hints at a grin when he tries not to laugh at a joke Ron makes. How has he not realized this before, that the person that occupies the majority of his thoughts is Malfoy?
“It’s better this way. The Muggles aren’t scared of me and wizard press doesn’t think to come looking in muggle London for ex death eaters. I can come and go as I please and just be without every single person watching me.”
“And instead of waking me, you decided that cuddling with Teddy was your burden to bear?” Harry snorts, using his hand to turn Draco’s face back towards him.
Harry laughs, thinking that not leaving doesn’t sound like the worst thing in the world, but heads to the kitchen to get food ready, only slightly worried about the fact that he has to figure out both a tattoo and what he’s going to say to a reporter in a few hours.
The next morning dawns bright and early, Harry’s phone alarm going off halfway across the room so that Harry is forced to detangle himself from the mess of arms and legs that is Draco Malfoy.
A month passes with no release of the photos from the hospital. Pansy informs Draco that she hasn’t even heard whispers about them. While Draco seems slightly comforted by this, it only serves to make Harry more paranoid. But with Christmas coming, he has other things that warrant his attention. Namely, projects and tests that various professors want done before break.
Almost at the end guys! One more main chapter after this one, and then a short epilogue. We hope you're staying happy and healthy, and appreciate any and all kudos and comments you leave<3
Hermione cuts him off straight away. “You loved her Harry, I don’t deny that. I’m just not sure you loved her like this. All consuming.”
“Umm there are quite a few things to be honest!” His eyebrows have darted up in a confused manner, ever fantasy Harry had about him and Malfoy being accepted without consequence has been shattered.
The night goes on in much the same way. Harry sees people he hasn’t seen for months, and they all act normal around him and Draco. He has a sneaking suspicion that it has to do with the huge volume of alcohol being consumed by the party, but he doesn’t really mind.
Harry hums but doesn’t give an actual answer, content to just stand with Draco and wait for their food.
Draco presses a kiss to his forehead and mumbles, “Point taken, Potter.” While wrapping his arms tighter around Harry.
“What? What does it matter? It looks good on you.” Harry says, clearly confused by Draco’s panic, bringing a hand up to brush Draco’s hair to the side, “What’s wrong Draco? Talk to me.”
Harry jerks his thumb all over his shoulder, “Gotta ask Binns about the History of Magic homework from last night.”
She says it’s pointless for her to stay in the dormitories alone, but Harry knows it’s because she’s worried about Ron and him. Either way he’s grateful. Hermione is such a permanent fixture in his day to day life that having to go months without seeing her would have been incredibly difficult. He knows Ron feels the same, probably even more so. As he enters the kitchen, Hermione’s back is to him so he clears his throat and greets her so that she can hear him over the noise of the cooking food, and the fan over the stove.
“I don’t want to do that Hermione.” Harry says, closing his eyes for a second before continuing, “The wizarding world doesn’t deserve every single detail of my life just because of who I am.”
Ron appears in the doorway and grins at Harry clapping him on the shoulder. He glances in Malfoy’s direction and manages to keep any disgust from showing on his face, though it’s a close call.
Draco sighs dramatically, and Harry leans in closer. “Of course Weasley would think that, it’s just because his team is awful-”
Harry shakes his head, smiling, before turning to the kitchen. Kreacher had gone back to Hogwarts last night to help out with Christmas dinner, but had promised Harry that he’d left breakfast in the fridge for the two boys.
“Okay,” Harry says looking back to the article, his eyes catching on one particularly awful paragraph.
“Ya it’s bad Potter, but the teachers respect the fact that I’ve come back and most if not all know that I’m no longer living in my family's home. Hogwarts was a lot of bad for me, but it’s also the only chance I’ve ever had at a life not painted with my family’s mistakes. I can’t succeed in the world as I am now, my only chance is getting good references and a proper education.”
“Breakfast Potter. I’ve been up for hours and still haven’t had a cup of tea thanks to your incessant nagging. I’m desperate.”
Draco is still looking at Harry so Harry adds, “I’ve mentioned it. It’s just after Christmas before school starts up again. I’ve already told everyone we’ll be there.”
Harry decides not to bring up his question for Malfoy until the weekend. Malfoy is too stressed to be much help in a conversation throughout the week, and they’ll actually be alone on the weekend with no one listening in on their conversations.
When Harry looks at her questioningly, Hermione supplies, “Ron said to me the other day, out of the blue that he knew you and Draco had a thing for each other but he didn’t know if Malfoy was good enough for you. He thinks the world of you Harry. And he’s willing to give Malfoy a chance because he makes you so happy.”
He knows realistically that the reason he’s so tired isn’t because of laying on a stiff mattress all night, or even because of the early Starbucks trip. It’s because he was steamily snogging the chosen one into the wee hours of the morning, and displaying an extreme level of vulnerability. Seriously, who would have guessed that after all the fights and arguments they’d had that he and Harry would get together- even if only for a moment.
“Okay, I’ll just be a few minutes. We should probably shower before leaving the flat too.” Draco says over his shoulder as Harry leaves the room.
Harry leans forward to try and catch a glimpse of the gift before having to dodge a lion clad foot that was aimed in his general direction.
“I suppose,” Harry says, tilting his head back to kiss the underside of Draco’s jaw, “But do you really think it’s necessary? Anyone can tell from the pictures that I’m in love with you.”
Draco shrugs, “More than you think.” He stands up and rifles through the wardrobe, “Here, wear this one with this shirt.”
The muggle park is practically empty, parents probably not willing to walk around with their kids in the cold weather, but this just means the swings are wide open for Teddy to enjoy. Draco and Harry take turns pushing Teddy, and chat about where they want to go for dinner. Draco wants to go somewhere fancy, but Harry points out that somewhere fancy may not be best for having a 7 month year old baby whose mood and appearance change at random. Draco concedes that that is a good point, and agrees to go to somewhere less fancy but still a sit down dinner.
“Ah,” whispers his traitorous mind, “But that doesn’t mean you don’t want to snog him messily in front of everyone, right this second.”
Harry Potter is tired of being the chosen one. He’s tired of people watching and analyzing his every move. Tired of having everything just given to him when he’d rather work for it. Tired of reaching for his wand every time someone shouts his name in a crowded street. Tired of the nightmares. Any one of these things is enough to drive a person mad, but when you’re 18 and just trying to get by, the weight of it all is crushing. This is what led to Harry Potter, the chosen one, saying “fuck it” and moving out of Grimmauld place and into a shitty little flat in Muggle London.
He feels Malfoy’s eyes on him, and when he turns to look at the other boy Malfoy gives a funny twitch of the mouth that could be his attempt at a comforting smile. Harry nods slightly, and they begin making their way past Hagrid’s darkened hut towards the brightly lit doors of the school.
It’s not subtle in the slightest, but no one pays it any mind. Or at least, Draco thought no one was paying him any mind. But when he looks down the table he sees Ginny’s eyes glued to the arm around his shoulders. He looks away quickly, not wanting her to know he saw her watching. He casually brings his one hand up to hold the hand wrapped around his shoulder.
When Harry enters the room, Draco shoves a bundle of what appears to be Draco’s jumper and a pair of sweatpants into his chest, and gently shoves Harry in the direction of the bathroom.
“You didn’t have to say what you said to the Weasley’s.” He breathes before sucking a mark at the place where Draco’s neck and collarbone meet.
Harry hurriedly taps his card and waits for their food. Grabbing it and hastily thanking Marissa he makes his way over to Malfoy. How is it that the entire world realized that they had feelings for each other before they did?
He makes it to the library and heads towards a dark corner with comfortable chairs, and pulls out his potions essay and transfiguration questions. He makes it about five minutes before feeling his phone buzz in the pocket of his robe.
“All these pictures are completely out of context.” He says finally, looking up at Hermione and Ron handing the newspaper back, while his other hand drifts to Draco’s thigh beneath the blanket. “Seriously, nothing they’ve said there is true.”
Draco reaches up and grabs Harry’s hand from his hair. “It’s like I’m flaunting that I’m with you in their face. It’ll just make them hate me more when I’m wearing one of their family sweaters when I’m not actually a part of the family Harry.”
He grabs Malfoy’s hand, and continues. “You’re one of the most important people in my life right now, which sounds absolutely ridiculous, but it’s true.”
Draco is nervous. He never used to get nervous. He used to be able to walk into any room and have everyone else hang on his every word. He was untouchable.
Harry thinks for a moment before glancing at Draco who looks scared but resigned. Harry takes a deep breath and turns back to Rita.
In a whining voice Malfoy responds, “Potter, it’s six o’clock in the morning, I most certainly don’t need to be up until 8.”
“You’re ridiculous.” Malfoy mutters before finally turning back to the barista and placing his order.
As they clamber off of the train, Harry is quite glad that Malfoy had pulled Teddy’s hood up. It’s gotten significantly colder and is doing a weird sort of rain and snow mixture. It’s actually beginning to look like Christmas which in and of itself is ridiculous when it was only late November.
“So about last night-” Harry starts, letting the sentence trail off in the hopes of Malfoy picking it up.
This Draco holds himself back, and still doesn’t let most emotion play out on his face. Harry can read the language written in the small ticks and movements of Draco’s face, but that’s only because he’s spent a very long time studying the book. He glances in Narcissa’s direction and wonders if she can read it too.
Ginny nods once, and adjusts her bag on her shoulder, clearly wanting to say something else. Harry waits her out, good at this now from interacting with Draco so much.
When Harry finally sits down in his old chair in Mcgonagall’s office, all he can focus on is how different Dumbledore and Mcgonagall decorate their offices. Fawkes’ old perch is gone, as is the table of trinkets that Harry had smashed during his fifth year. In the trinkets place is a teapot patterned with smokey gray cats moving across the glass, sitting next to it is what Harry suspects to be a tin full of biscuits. Much to Harry’s amusement there is also a lovely cat perch that Harry thinks Mcgonagall must use when in her feline form. All of these things provide enough distraction that Harry doesn’t have to look at Dumbledore’s picture hanging behind Mcgonagall’s head. His focus is pulled in that direction though when Mcgonagall clears her throat.
Harry feels it warm up and leans forward to kiss Draco gently. They spend a few minutes like that, only stopping when Draco’s foot hits Harry’s present at the end of the couch and they hear a crumpling noise of almost ripping wrapping paper.
Hermione holds his stare for a moment, she appears to be searching for something in Harry that he can’t identify, before shaking her head, “Nothing Harry, I’ll let you figure this one out on your own. I’m gonna go see why Ron was here.”
He’s breathing heavily by the end of this and seems to think that’s the end of the argument when Hermione calmly says, “I appreciate that you are concerned about my safety, but Draco and I have been working together all term-”
Above it all though Ron’s voice raises above them, “Everyone quiet!” He glares at everyone until they’re all looking at him before continuing, “I know you lot are upset and confused by Harry’s announcement. Hell, I’ve known longer than you and I’m still confused. But Harry is still Harry. He’s not being tricked or blackmailed. He hasn’t been put under a curse. Believe me I’ve checked.”
“Ya I know.” Draco says stiffly, catching sight of Harry and waving with one hand before leaning back against the wall and focusing back on the phone call.
He finishes the bowl quickly, and inhales some treacle tart to distract himself. When that’s done, he goes to the sitting room and turns on the telly. The only things on are reruns of Muggle shows called
Harry stands for a moment outside the restaurant, a light mist has begun to fall as he makes his way back to Malfoy and Teddy. He contemplates Luna’s words and Hermione’s suggestion. Maybe he should talk to someone, maybe it would lessen the night terrors and paranoia. Maybe, just maybe, it might make that fantasy with Draco and Teddy just a little bit more achievable.
Harry shrugs again, and makes no move to pull away from Malfoy. He’s enjoying these final moments of casual touch where he can get them, because as soon as he tells Malfoy what Hermione said, he knows Malfoy will want nothing to do with him.
Harry springs away from Malfoy’s side and whips around with his wand raised, only to see Hermione looking at him with one eyebrow raised.
“Listen to me,” he whispers, stepping closer. “This is something that is going to be incredibly difficult, but it is also something that you need to do. Those people didn’t die for you. They died to kill the Dark Lord. And if you think about it, plenty of good things have happened in this courtyard.”
Harry gently moves one hand up to Malfoy’s head and runs his fingers through Malfoy’s fair hair. It’s just as soft as Harry remembers from the night before, and no less lovely.
“Oh the fact that it will drive Ronald absolutely mental also has its perks. Perhaps I can write another quidditch song in Ginny's favour.”
She waves her wand and a bowl full of potatoes plops down in front of him. He considers using magic but decides he’d rather do it manually and take up more time.
“Alright boys. Potter I think it’ll be best for you to just take all the same classes as Malfoy, so you can just follow him for today and get the book lists from his as well. For now, I’m sure that you can share books, as you’ll mostly be working independently together.”
Malfoy’s eyes slide back to staring at nothing and Harry sets the serving spoon he had been holding down. There’s ice in his tone that hasn’t been there for a long time, Harry almost chalks it up to nerves about quidditch, but he knows Malfoy too well now, and knows that this won’t be about just anything.
Harry grins over at Malfoy, “Malfoy are we talking about our crushes? We’ve reached that level of friendship?” How exciting, I’ll have to tell my my journal.” He continues on in an eerily high voice, “Dear Diary, today Malfoy and I chatted about the objects of our affection over a glass of pumpkin juice-
Kreacher nods and disappears to the castle without another word. Caring for crying babies doesn’t seem to be his forte.
They start off with basic questions, careers, classes, the occasional Azkaban inquiry, before rapidly diving into the deeper more personal questions. Harry answers them as best he can, knowing that Luna wouldn’t have sent this guy if he wouldn’t do a good job. Draco stays silent for most of it unless asked a direct question.
She hands him a sheet and reads it over quickly. It asks questions of insomnia, diet, fatigue, bursts of anger or other strong emotions, nightmares, medication, potions or charms he’s tried, current methods of coping and a few other columns as well.
Without another word, Harry stands up and grabs Draco’s hand to pull him up after him. Draco follows wordlessly, and shrugs his coat on in the kitchen while Mrs Weasley hugs Harry and tells him to visit anytime.
The silence that follows from Hermione is as good as a confession, Harry tries to soften the blow, who knows how Ron might react with Malfoy of all people sharing classes with his girlfriend, let alone projects.
Thinking about Starbucks makes him smile. Starbucks is where it all started. All it took was a familiar glare across the cafe and an entirely new relationship had begun. Now, 4 months later they had spent the past night snogging until their lips were sore. Harry can’t believe it took them so long to get their shit together, but then again, he could be quite oblivious. It’s a good thing he’s got friends like Hermione and Ron.
Molly hesitates for a second longer, teetering on the edge, before making her way towards the stairs and gesturing for Harry to follow her. They go up the first flight of stairs and Harry waits for Molly to knock gently on the door and have a brief conversation with her daughter. After a few moments Molly leaves, and Ginny is standing in the door looking at Harry.
“What did Granger want?” Malfoy asks quietly after making sure Ron and Hermione have started their own conversation, bringing Harry’s attention back to him.
Harry’s eyes lock with Draco’s at that, he hadn’t known Malfoy had talked to anyone, he’d just assumed he was good at putting the past behind him. But how stupid is he to think that you can live in the same house as Voldemort and just put it behind you?
As he stumbles around the room, tripping over Malfoy’s discarded socks, Malfoy burrows deeper into his blankets and looks for all intents and purposes like he is never getting out of his bed.
Much more gently than before, Hermione says, “I’ll just ask you this Harry, if this is just friendship, what's Ron’s favourite dessert?”
Luckily none of the letters appear to be full or curses or howlers like what Hermione had to deal with in fourth year, and he recognizes handwriting from both McGonagall and Hagrid and sets those ones to the side for later.
He quickly picks up his drink and sandwich, heading back to Malfoy and completely missing the confused look the barista sends their way.
She raises her one hand up to play with Teddy’s hand. Draco looks vaguely shocked that anyone would come near him, but Harry knew that Luna will be the most kind to him out of everyone.
There’s silence for a moment before Molly says, “Well that’s wonderful Harry dear,” She’s smiling, “We were worried it was bad news! Now who is she?”
She pulls away from their hug and plasters a smile on her face, her pale eyes wide. “Right well have a good night Harry, give Teddy a kiss for me.”
“What did Weasley want?” Draco asks, pulling his beanie off Seamus’s passing head and pulling it down over his own ears.
This has him on his feet with his wand in hand in an instant, prepared to cast an expelliarmus if need be. He hears mumbled cursing, a couple chairs screech and what sounds like a bag dropping to the ground.
“We could.” Harry says, rubbing comforting circles on Draco’s back under the leather jacket. “We’d just have to put up some extra spells.”
Harry snorts but wraps his free arm around a shivering Draco’s waist. “I’m sure you’ll survive, let’s just go home.”
Eventually, Draco pulls his hand out of Harry’s and Harry realizes he must be done. His arm is still turned away from Harry.
Draco gives a small closed lip smile and Molly Weasley looks at him for all of a second before pulling him into a hug as well.
The alcohol makes Draco’s smirk come easier, his laughter louder and puts a nice rosy tint in his cheeks. Harry has no reason to complain.
Harry lets out a short laugh, “Bit rich coming from you Malfoy when your place looks like it's hardly lived in. Tell me how much did those couches cost that you don’t even sit on?”
Sorry for the late post today friends! I'm just starting reading week and Brek has a pretty full plate. Hope y'all enjoy this chapter<3
Harry’s heart catches on the words “confess your love,” but he remains speechless, trying to process everything that the girl is saying to him.
Without waiting for a response or for Draco to catch his breath, Harry takes the last few steps needed and knocks on the door.
Draco’s face is bright with a huge smile, “Oh no, you definitely do.” He pulls Harry in a little closer and Harry laughs trying to twist out of his reach.
Andromeda had sent an owl during dinner to ask the boys if they could watch Teddy for the night, and Harry had happily agreed. They’d taken a risk and apparated to Harry’s apartment. Teddy knew it better, and would be easier to comfort if they had access to all his toys.
“Granger. I talked to Mcgonagall already. We’re taking the day off. And if you don’t shove off I’ll whisk Harry away for a week and not tell you where he is. Goodbye.”
“Fine, Potter. It’s not like I have anyone to tell anyways.” Malfoy says finally, looking away and taking a sip of his drink.
“Better than expected, love.” Harry says, absently squeezing Draco’s hand and making to walk towards the next stop.
“I thought we agreed we weren’t going to say anything to the press.” Harry says, placing his hands on Draco’s thighs.
A strange look crosses Malfoy’s face before he says, “Potter you adjusted them ages ago to let me in.” At Harry’s confused look he continues, “Right around the time we had our third coffee date... you insisted I come over afterwards to give my input on what colour you should paint your kitchen?”
“Harry you’re in love with Draco Malfoy. Literally everyone can see it. You and Draco seem to be the only ones who don’t know.”
He wonders why fate has to make all the people he cares about in his life unavailable. First his parents, then Sirius, then Ginny, and now, Malfoy. Surely the chosen one deserves a break too?
Dean and Seamus are already drunk, and seem to be having trouble focusing on everyone, but Seamus realizes who’s at the table soon enough and says, slurring his words slightly, “Malfoy, you bastard. Ron says you have some pretty fucked up ideas about Quidditch mate.”
The two boys leave the tattoo shop an hour later, with promises of showing their tattoos to one another when they get home. Harry is ridiculously happy. Happy he has a tattoo, happy they’re going to an interview, and most of all happy to be with Draco. Malfoy is wearing his distinctive scowl, but Harry can read the current of happiness running under the surface like a stream.
“Harry, I think it’s time we had a little chat.” She has that look on her face that she gets when she knows something you don’t.
Malfoy looks blank for a second before straightening and saying, “Granger punched me in the face when I was being a giant twat over there.”
Another breath, “But I won’t hurt Harry. I love him. And I won’t hurt him. And I just wanted you all to know that.”
“Because I said so, Granger.” Draco snaps, barely keeping his voice at whispering level. “He had a really bad day yesterday. We’re taking today off.”
People bustle around him, but Harry makes good time and pushes the Starbucks door open. It is warm inside, and the air smells like pumpkin spice, which has Harry thinking longingly about Hogwarts pumpkin juice for a moment.
Sighing, Harry pulls away and walks towards the living room. Malfoy lets him go easily, he seems to have let go of his intimidation tactics and now just hopes to pester Harry until he gives him what he wants.
He isn’t foolish enough to believe in a happy ending for himself, but maybe Harry is foolish and brave enough to dream of a happy ending for both of them.
Harry yelps and jerks away from Draco, but not far enough that Draco doesn’t manage to slip his cold hands under Harry’s shirt and pull him back down to him.
Draco clears his throat and they both whip around to look at him, “Is there anything I can help with?”
Harry shakes his head and grabs Draco’s hand, squeezing gently, “Of course I’m coming. There was never a question.”
Harry wakes up the next morning to the sound of Teddy crying. He cracks one eye open and waits to see if he settles down, but after a minute it becomes apparent that it’s time to wake up. He presses a kiss to Draco’s shoulder before quietly getting out of the bed and going to get Teddy.
“You know what Rita, I think I’m good.” Harry says, starting to walk away, “Come on Draco, let’s go.”
To the untrained eye, Narcissa Malfoy has not changed much since the last time Harry saw her, and yet it seems that in all the hidden ways she has changed the most.
Draco trails off mid-sentence to look at Ginny, opening his mouth to say something, but Harry squeezes his hand and gets up, clambering over a nearly unconscious Ron and nearly falling on his face as he makes his way after Ginny.
He hears Draco snort, and then feels his fingers card gently through his hair. “Do you want to go out tonight?”
She looks at him shocked for all but a moment before saying, “Okay. I don’t need the details. I’m not ready to forgive him, but you don’t need to explain anything more to me. You’ll have enough trouble explaining to the rest of the family.”
Harry takes a moment to think, and doesn’t look at Neville for a moment, too focused on looking at Draco and wondering what it is about him that’s different.
At a glacial pace Harry lowers his wand, and steps forward towards Draco. Draco stands up, looking unsure. Harry takes another step and then rests his head on Draco’s shoulder, face turned in towards his neck. After a few seconds, Draco’s arms come up around him. Feather-light, and easy to knock off if he felt like it. Instead, Harry just presses in closer and wraps his own arms around Draco’s torso.
He doesn’t wait for Harry to reply but begins walking down the street towards the various Hogsmead shops. Harry scrambles to follow before saying,
“I don’t know Hermione! We get coffee and insult each other while we do our homework.” sighing and rubbing his eyes with his free hand he adds, “I suppose we’re sort of friends now.”
Malfoy settles down at Harry’s side and spoons some eggs onto his plate and adding a  disgustingly large pile of ketchup before answering, “We have potions this morning, care of magical creatures, lunch and then transfiguration.”
“What do you think of Teddy?” Harry asks, fisting his hand in Malfoy’s sweater and snuggling imperceptibly closer.
With that George gets up from the table and starts making his way up the stairs towards Ginny’s room. Harry hears Ginny’s door open, low voices and then the snick of it being shut again. There’s silence in the kitchen.
Their feet slam into semi frozen ground, and dry leaves swirl past them. Malfoy curls his hands into his sleeves for warmth. Harry recognizes the outskirts of Hogsmead and as he lets go of Malfoy’s arm his mind unhelpfully supplies a barrage of memories including caterwaul charms, gripping a dying Dumbledore’s arm and a large black dog bounding towards him with a newspaper in its mouth. Harry closes his eyes against the onslaught of grief that overcomes him at the last memory. Maybe it’s too soon, maybe this is a bad idea. Trying to get a hold of himself he turns to Malfoy who is squinting into the mid morning sun.
But Draco is the worst of all. He has everything he could possibly want, and the only thing that seems to bring him actual joy is teasing Harry and warm sugary drinks from Starbucks. So Harry is stumped.
“You’re not the only one who can get branded merch, Potter.” Draco says smugly, the corner of his eyes crinkling somewhat.
“Alright where to next Malfoy? I think I need more convincing as to why it was a bad idea for me to come back.”
Malfoy looks at him from where he was pulling on a high collared wool coat, fair brows raised in question.
Harry grins at Malfoy’s side when one obnoxious fifth year demands to know why, “Fucking Potter is at our goddamn tryouts?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes and says something along the lines of, “Sure entrust the man who grew up in a cupboard to know what’s good for children.” But Harry isn’t really listening anymore.
“Well,” Draco says pulling the corner of the blanket to be over both their laps, “As we’re in my flat and you sleep in my bed at the castle, I think it’s fair for me to pick what goes on the bed.”
At first, the flat had been a sort of summer home for Ron and Hermione, but Hermione had gotten permission from McGonagall to live there throughout the year and use the floo network to get to and from Hogwarts each day.
Harry smiles into it, and pulls Malfoy down onto the couch with him, happier than he’s been in a long time.
He closes his eyes again against that thought and leans his forehead against Draco’s, taking a deep breath. Those are thoughts for later, he’s not going to ruin this moment by overthinking everything to death. That’s normally Hermione’s job.
“That’ll be good.” Hermione says seemingly content to talk about Hogwarts itself. “Give you lots of opportunities to use the library and everything.”
“Well you are the The Boy Who Lived, Potter.” Draco says, breaking his silence but not looking at Harry, “I’m not sure why you’re surprised.”
“Catch you later Harry, I’ll see you at the reunion in a couple weeks.” Neville says, his eyes hint that there will definitely be more dating interrogation in the future. Regardless, Harry him in for a tight one armed hug.
Harry glances at Draco just in time to see the relief swoop across his face and then go into hiding in the glittering of his eyes.
He barely stops himself from shrinking into Draco’s side as she stares at him. He knows she’s posturing, and won’t do anything to him, but in the moment he can’t help but remember that she was in the clearing when Voldemort cast the curse.
Draco handles it with an eye roll and nothing more, too focused on finding the tattoo shop, and content to let Harry fill the silence with mindless observations.
The owls are all relatively silent, each swooping in and waiting their turn for Harry to untie their letters before swooping out again.
Mcgonagall nods once before saying, “Alright Potter, you’d better get going or he’ll think you got lost somewhere along the network. I’ve been told it’s happened before.”
Harry allows it, but almost pulls away, but then Draco mutters against his lips, “I love you too, Scarhead.”
“I’m not sure,” he says between mouthfuls, “Would I be captain again as I’m the only remaining member? I’ll  have to talk to McGonagall. What about you?”
Draco stands up and goes to leave the store, but Harry scrambles up and grabs his hand before he can get too far.
“God, you’re such an emotionally stunted 𝘣𝘰𝘺 Potter!” Malfoy scoffs before adding, “You had a good time? Just say if you want this to be a thing or not.”
Harry barely has a chance to let this sink in before Hermione adds, “Also the fact that neither one of them have come back up here either means that they’re both dead or are getting along for once in their lives. I call that progress.”
“Seriously Potter?” He turns his attention back to Mcgonagall before continuing. “He hasn’t worked it out yet, but he wants to come back to Hogwarts because being an Auror is too much like the war. Ya he’s good at it, but he’d rather be doing something else. He just doesn’t want to let people down because he’s their ‘Chosen One’.”
Harry lets those words float around in his head for a bit before shaking them off and saying, “Tell me about Hogwarts.”
Harry grins and quips back, “Eat with trolls often Malfoy? That manor of yours must have been something else.”
“Um,” Harry clears his throat. “Andromeda this is Mal- Draco Malfoy. He’s a friend of mine and is going to help me out with Teddy this weekend.”
The chosen one has fallen onto Draco's bed and has his face smushed into his pillow, arms stretched loosely in front of him curled around the cushion.
Harry quickly loses track of any conversation going on between Malfoy and Hermione as his mind laser focuses on Malfoy’s hand.
“Oh shove off Potter. It was a nosebleed. Calm down, I’m sure you had worse when you were out with your merry men in the forest.”
Harry’s heart drops to somewhere near his stomach, “Just ones from our dinner last night probably, right?”
Harry pauses to look at Malfoy, and intentionally shovels more food into his mouth before leaning in closer and saying, “Why, does it bother you?”
“Ohh not so fond of that idea are we, Malfoy?” Harry grins, leaning in towards Malfoy, shoulders clacking together.
Before the person has the chance to get the jump on him, Harry throws himself around the corner and shouts, “Petrificus totalus!”
“I said, do you want to come over to Ron and mine’s place tonight, Mrs. Weasley sent us leftovers from whatever big meal she had last.”
Harry presses the base of his hands to his eyes and black dots swam into his vision. He attempts to focus on his breathing, and most importantly slowing it down. It could have been minutes or hours or days, but gradually Harry feels his heart beat slow and his breathing even out.
“Ugh fine,” Malfoy says releasing his grip on Harry and standing up with him, “Let’s feed the brat.”
“I have a few ideas.” Draco says, standing in front of Harry and holding out both hands for him to grab onto.
The fact that Malfoy just called his apartment ‘home’ makes butterflies float lazily somewhere near his rib cage. Harry nods his head in approval and the four classmates stand up for hugs.
“I’m not sure Professor.” he says finally. “He just gets it, he doesn’t hold me on a pedestal or treat me like glass. It’s a nice change.”
“I know… it doesn't make sense.” Harry starts, anxiety becoming a pit in his stomach. He rings his hands in front of him. Luna says it’s a nervous habit. He actively wishes Draco were here with him,  “But it’s the truth. And I don’t want to have to lie to you when the story comes out, or have you hear about it from someone else when the story breaks.”
Luna nods and they sit in silence for a couple minutes, Harry content to look around the room and be in Luna’s calming presence.
He feels his phone buzz in his pocket but ignores it, instead reaching for his wand. Hesitantly, he adjusts the wards barring Ron and Hermione from apparating directly in. He loves them but right now he doesn’t need to see them. He needs to think.
Malfoy slides his eyes in Harry’s direction and says, “Obviously. I’m meeting my mother for dinner tonight at the manor. I need to get ready.”
“Hey Hermione, I was thinking of coming over for dinner tonight if that's alright with you? I kinda skipped out of Auror training today and need to grab some notes.”
“Life’s not fair.” Malfoy replies, though he pauses to help Harry undo the rest of the buttons on his shirt.
Harry hears him say those words, but his mind has already run down the path of seeing Snape die, Lupin transform, Sirius getting injured. With a hurclean amount of strength and effort he pulls himself out of his own head and shakily follows Malfoy up the frosty hill.
That earns a chuckle from the group, Harry included, and Ron’s eyes dart over to him before saying, “Somehow, Harry sees something in the smarmy bastard that is Malfoy. I’m not going to pretend to understand it, but I do know that he’s the happiest that I’ve seen him in a long time when he’s with him.”
At the sight of Harry still lounged across his sectional, Malfoy throws his hands up in exasperation, “Oh my God Potter, why aren’t you gone yet?”
It’s at this precise moment when Harry is staring into Malfoy’s face that he remembers the 12 players on the field who are undoubtedly watching this exchange.
Ron and Hermione show up exactly ten minutes after the phone call with Harry ended. Harry has managed to get Draco into a pair of jogging pants and a jumper, and wrapped in a blanket on the couch. He settles in beside him. Draco is shivering, but Harry doesn’t think it’s because of the cold.
This seems to make some of the tension in Malfoy’s shoulders ease, and he sneers, “I don’t need your pity Potter.”
Harry ducks his head slightly and shrugs. “I don’t know, it seems silly to commute there and back each day and travel is expensive.”
The sentence is set up as a question, but Harry knows it’s just kindness and that the man clearly recognized them as soon as he walked in.
“I’ve been looking for you for hours.” he growls, “Mind telling me why you didn’t answer your bloody phone?”
With that Harry agrees, hangs up the phone, and closes his eyes. He loves and appreciates Ron and Hermione, and he knows they’re only hovering because they’re worried about him, but he wishes that people would stop treating him like he is either going to break, or suddenly become the next Minister of Magic.
He’s got a charms book out in front of him, too tattered and worn to decipher the title. But his eyebrows are drawn in with focus, and a stray hair has fallen out of place where he leans forward to read. Harry has the sudden urge to smooth the stray hair back with the rest of them. Malfoy slams the book shut and picks up his fork, shaking Harry out of his thoughts.
“I’ll never be ready.” Draco answers, holding his hand out to Harry solemnly, “I need a few drinks in me before I’m ready to deal with the entire Gryffindor house.”
Harry rolls his eyes at that and says, “That’s what I told Hermione, but she seems to think differently.”
Draco doesn’t say anything. Harry slips his cold hand under the hem of Draco’s sweater and presses it against bare skin for a response.
