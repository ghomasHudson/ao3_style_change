Reaching out a hand, he makes to silence him when a flash of ginger interrupts him. The weasel raises his wand, looking scared shitless, and yells something.
The death of Tonks had been hard on him, Harry knows that. But when he sees Teddy’s gurgling face, growing up without a father, he’s less sympathetic. Being an orphan is something he’s painfully familiar with.
“Hi.” The dickhead says, like an absolute idiot.
And then it’s the day before he has to leave, and he’s not ready. He’s finally started properly showering, yes, and he wears clothes in the day, yes, and he eats a small meal twice a day, yes, but… no words ever come out. He’s cold all the time without his blankets. His hands shake when he remembers. He screams every night when he is able to sleep, which is not very often, and his tongue bleeds every morning after. His mark still throbs, under all the permanent bandages. He’s only talked to house elves and his mother since the trials ended.
“Harry-”
Alright, I think I've babbled enough. Probably too much.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“Pans.” Blaise, lip curled at the weasel, rests a hand on her raised arm. “Don’t listen to the poor, foolish thing. His brain must have overheated.”
Quidditch. Late nights in the common room, playing dumb games. Mother reading to him by his bed. Father smiling at him for once. Pansy tearing into another girl for insulting him. Snape giving him a wink when he gets full marks.
Oh great. Now Ginny’s calling him that. Sure, she looked a little disgusted as she said it, but she said it nonetheless.
Harry stares, certain he's read it wrong. But no, there it is. Potter, Harry above Malfoy, Draco. Whipping around to Ron, he stammers in aggressive bewilderment. Ron, who gives up on trying to understand him, shrugs.
He glances at him, recognising the man from somewhere. The knight jogs along with him, shoving disgruntled people out of his way as he moves from lush greenery to taverns, glaring at Harry the entire time.
He can feel Pansy’s glare on him now, practically restrained to her bed by Blaise, both of them with healing boils and slime from a new hex. Madam Pomfrey fusses over them, mostly ignoring the younger students, who are constantly sniping about how Draco deserved it. They’d left Harry alone when he started growling at them, but their conversation is still itching at him.
The pacing stops, Nott standing right next to him. His hand comes down softly onto Harry’s shoulder, who can’t help but tense, knowing that Nott will definitely hit him. Instead, the boy kneels down next to him, looking straight into Harry’s face, anguish struggling to be contained under his mask.
“Wait, Harry!”
Any ideas, questions, or random babbles are always appreciated, especially if you've seen something in earlier chapters that I haven't explained.
“I suppose that means it’s midnight.” Harry casts a tempus, and nods. “Happy New Year, Draco.”
Oh, and one more quick one: Would you rather have more time with Slytherins or Gryffindors (+ Luna)?
“No! I was thinking about the looks Parkinson and Zabini keep giving him.” He sits up, scowling at Ron, who looks relieved.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
As usual, any ideas or questions or random babbles are always appreciated!
Begging, now. They should all beg. He is powerful. He is far above them. He could set fire to this world and build it anew.
The smoke is thickening, darkening, the edges sharpening into spikes. Is this really what Malfoy is thinking? He wants to deny it, but the smoke is reaching down, wrapping around Malfoy’s hands, which have a tight grip on both ends of his wand. As though he’s going to snap it.
“You have a lot of wrackspurts in your head today.”
Now he knows. Because Malfoy was planning to die anyway.
“Hello?” A faint voice calls out near him. He startles, scrambling to his feet and staring at the newcomer. For the first time in a while, he finds he can stand easily, with no shaking or pain. However, this revelation is quickly outshadowed by the shock of the man standing before him.
‘I don’t know. Work in the Ministry, I guess.’
‘We killed their families.’
Luna smiles, setting Jaebo down on the coffee table. The animals painted on the walls start to gather around, eager for attention too. “Hello, hello, hello. Oh, snakey, you look especially shiny today!”
‘When?’
“Did Pansy paint you?”
(‘Harry, stop.’ White smoke, still new to him, and hard to conjure without his poor wand. ‘I understand. You did something stupid to try and make me happy. I’ve done a lot worse, I think I can forgive you for one stupid mistake. I’m alive, right?’)
“Yes.” He had a lot of time to think when his friends were busy ignoring him and Draco was hiding in his room. It seems like only Neville will talk to him any more. “This isn’t on a whim. I know what I’m doing. I’m not as talented as the rest of them, headmistress, no one will have any reason to accept me despite my mark. Hogwarts might be the only place left for me to live a good life.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
(Draco’s eyes, staring blankly at the ceiling, glassy and glossed over and dead-)
“Me and Luna were just talking. About wishes, you know?” Potter says keenly, sitting on the end of Draco’s bed. He still hasn’t eaten the tart, which is bizarre, as both him and Weasley have the disgusting habit of shoving food into their mouth like there’s no tomorrow.
He doesn’t like to see her worried. He wants to see her smile. Does she not like this?
“L- l-”
(“Even if Draco had been given everything in the world, he would still have had to deal with his own thoughts. Magic couldn’t fix him.”)
- E.D.
“Yes, I know.” No, bad move. Don’t interrupt. “I’m sorry, headmistress, but I’ve thought about this a lot. They only want me here so they can keep an eye on me.”
“Oh.” Ron pauses. “I forgot to tell you.”
“I don’t know. Isolation is bad for him, he needs someone there to talk to. Perhaps I should go.” Hermione stands, but Ron quickly leaps over and pulls her back down again.
Question time!
- E.D.
“I l-l-”
“At the Manor.” She smiles at the memory, one of the few bright sparks in the darkness of that time. “He brought us food, and we talked as long as he was allowed. When he told me about Blaise, I tried to help him in return, by- oh. Can you not tell him I told you?” She’d promised not to tell anyone when he’d asked, and now she’d broken that twice. Maybe he’ll find out, and not want to be her friend anymore. She hopes he doesn’t. She likes being his friend, on his good days.
“What?” Neville clutches his plant tighter, eyes flicking between Harry and McGonagall. He must have seen them talking.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“You are an asshole, and a dickhead, and a stupid murdering scumbag, but I’ll help you.” Pansy huffs, throwing a piece of paper at him. “My family funds some of the Unspeakables’ experiments. Call that number, tell them you’re a Parkinson, and they might let you in. Don’t you dare say who you really are. I don’t think they’ll ever forgive you for destroying half of their rooms, killer of the Dark Lord or not.”
“Draco-”
“Master Malfoy, sir, you should calls the nice Madam Pomfrey. Your face be very pale!” The drawing squeaks - his drawing, the drawing he’d done for S.P.E.W., the drawing that’s now talking and moving around.
Merlin’s beard. Now even Potter knows about him and Theodore.
Draco blinks, startled into silence.
Theodore sighs. “We learnt about her in History. I know Binns is dull, but if you make a game out of his words, you can convince yourself to listen. In third year, us slytherins used to cast another mist charm word every time he said a date. By the end of class, we could usually barely see each other through the fog. I guess that’s why Draco could make those black letters so easily. He always made the darkest mist.”
-----
Draco swallows. He schools his expression blank, gets to his feet, and tries to pretend that Potter wasn’t standing right in front of him expecting an answer. A nod is all he gives to the stranger (he’s just a stranger don’t look don’t look don’t look) as he picks up his trunk and marches off.
She snorts, standing and folding her arms. “There’s no way you’re as fabulous as a phoenix. Only I could achieve that.” With that, she flicks her hair and turns to march off, waiting for him to argue back.
“It is.” Harry says simply.
Draco buries his head into the dark, and tries to slip away into nothingness. It doesn’t work. It never does.
Harry stares at the word, Crucio, as it fizzles out above Malfoy’s head, dropping them into the darkness once more. He lifts his wand once more, muttering a Lumos, and gazes around at the calm after the storm. The room is a mess, pillows burst open and scattered on the floor. Corner really won’t be happy about this.
(See the end of the chapter for
A mass of fur shoves past him, running towards- running and leaning over- hand pressing to the pulse of-
He glances back at Luna, a wicker basket swinging from her arm. “Yeah?”
‘To send an enemy into a deep sleep, raise your right arm and…’
“Okay.” Ginny takes her hand, shoving her skirt back down with the other. “Bye, Parkinson.”
“We can come back after.” Remus insists, glancing at Draco. He takes the hint, and nods at his mother, slipping his hand from hers.
“Sir?” The bushy-haired lickspittle hesitantly enquires.
“Don’t be stupid, Parkinson, I can hear the music. Let me in.” He glares, folding his arms. He looks like a child. An ugly little brat having a temper tantrum, actually.
Harry stares at his feet, fully visible, sticking out underneath the invisibility cloak. Ah. He’s grown a bit since his earlier school years, clearly.
‘The least known spell for making a wizard or witch obey certain commands is the puppeteer curse. This involves…’
- E.D.
Once more, their eyes lock. This time, Malfoy refuses to shy away, but there's no responding flare of challenge. He arches an aristocratic eyebrow, posture unusually slouched, and sighs as though this silent battle is the most exhausting one he's ever been in. Harry stares him down, determined for an unknown reason to win this. Malfoy rolls his eyes, and looks away.
“I can see that, you idiots. Come on!”
“Yes, father!” He raises his voice.
“Harry. May I call you Harry?” Narcissa stands as he walks back in, setting the empty cup down. “How are you feeling? I know this must not be a pleasant place to be.”
Harry lifts his wand again, preparing to hex someone, but then the ferret moves again. He points with his right hand, one finger on his left hand moving up each time.
He turns and- He’s completely wrong. There is a house elf in the hospital ward, staring up at him from a piece of paper on his bedside table.
Luna darts over to the two of them, sweeping her wand in a circle and muttering words. A large blue bubble surrounds the two of them, rippling when they move.
Mixed houses
He shakes his head. The last thing he remembers is falling asleep as usual, in his own bed, thinking about Harry bloody Potter and his lips. He flushes.
“Accio!” He yells, giving in to having to use words.
I'm spending far too much time flicking through instagram instead of writing or talking to people, so to get myself motivated, I'd like to know more about you! I love knowing what people are thinking about my work, but most importantly, I love seeing what you're like. Therefore, I'm going to start asking a short question at the bottom of every chapter or work I publish, and see what you say.
“Draco?”
When this is over, I will be taking a small break from large fics to gather ideas and make a plan for a new one. However, if you've read 'You're Going To Poke Someone's Eye Out', you'll see I've been thinking of writing a story of Gakushuu (from Assassination Classroom) going to Hogwarts. This will include Draco, however Gakushuu will be the centre of the story. I realise not many other people will know AC well enough to be interested in this, so should I:
“I found a spell to give someone a wish and I asked Draco for his and he said that he wanted his Dark Mark gone and I cast the spell without anyone knowing about it and then I came in the next morning and the spell had worked but it killed him, Nott, it killed him. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to do it.” He rushes out the words, voice strained and panic building again. He can’t look at Nott’s face, knowing the anger and disgust must be building on it.
She takes his arm gently, looking relieved. “Yes?”
Piercing green eyes suddenly meet his for a split second before he wrenches his away, glaring at the stone slabs under his feet. Potter. Interfering holier-than-thou Potter with his irritating rat’s nest of hair and constantly cracked glasses. Yes, Draco used to be a stunner, but why couldn’t Potter stop stalking him for once?!
“Magic can’t fix everything.” Nott starts. His voice is frustrated, but he does nothing to lash out at Harry. “Expelliarmus might stop the Dark Lord, but you can’t always be the Saviour, Harry. Sometimes, people just need time and understanding to sort things out themselves. This was Draco’s fight. Even if Draco had been given everything in the world, he would still have had to deal with his own thoughts. Magic couldn’t fix him. The only thing you could have done was be there for him when he needed it, given him space, given him comfort, allowed him to work it all out himself. I couldn’t do that, so I gave him space for people like Pansy and Hermione and Luna and Blaise to help him instead. You should have just- just waited!”
Black runs a hand through his hair, sighing, and sitting. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
“Of what?” Hermione frowns.
“I don’t-” He has to cut himself off as the haul comes to a standstill, both Draco’s and the mysterious newcomer’s magic halting his progress.
“That’s great!” Harry grins back, trying not to think of all the possible disastrous outcomes. He’d accepted Sirius’s death a long time ago. He doesn’t think he could manage if he had to learn to do it all over again. “How are the renovations going?”
Draco slowly drains the last dregs of tea from his cup, eyes on Theodore.
“Harry-” Narcissa’s voice cracks. She’s pale, even paler than normal, if that is possible, and her face is so gaunt and tired that Harry fears she’s going to drop dead where she sits. “Harry, you… Thank you for telling me. I would like some time alone.”
Pansy and Draco have been helping? Two purebloods who have house elves to pamper them every day? Harry can’t help feeling a little suspicious, but he doesn’t want to crush the hopeful look in Hermione’s eyes, so he nods. “Alright. I trust you. Good luck.”
Sounds a little risky, but Harry’s lived and breathed risk for the past few years.
Draco nods, tucking away the garbage wand. He knows he needs his old wand back, but how is he supposed to ask Potter for it?
“It’s ok, love. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. I’m just worried, that’s all, Draco. If you need to tell us anything, we’ll be here, okay? That’s what friends are for.”
Another one of my wonderful questions:
The awkward conversation gradually eases. Draco tunes out at the point they turn to the subject of school, not wanting to be reminded he’ll have to do actual work. Pansy’s fingers running through his hair is soothing, though, so it’s not hard to drift in and out of his haze. Her legs remain still, refraining from constantly shifting positions like usual, as though she can sense he needs this. She’s always had perfect intuition.
Oh, shut up, Sev. No one cares what the name of the fucking potion is, as long as he doesn’t have to see death every night.
“Professor, will the professors make exceptions for those who didn’t attend seventh year?”
“Sometimes.” She says, head tucked into Ginny’s shoulder. “It’s more for the ability to ward away wrackspurts. You should have looked at my research on them yesterday, it’s amazing how many students with mental health difficulties have a higher percentage of wrackspurts around them.”
“Thanks Luna!”
He’s already off, fleeing from the room with the guilt snapping at his heels. Her sharp face, defined cheekbones and sloping eyebrows, they remind him so much of Draco. His heart caves in on itself, emotions bursting free of the wreckage as he stumbles through dark halls, the shadows in the corners clutching onto his desperation and ripping it open. He can’t do this. He thinks he’s going to be sick.
“Wait. You said the ‘last of your money’.” Harry frowns, settling into his usual seat. Hagrid and Fang are out clearing an infestation of bark beetles, if the papers on the table are anything to go by, so the two of them have the hut to themselves.
Along with my mock exams and rehearsals for a play, I now need to spend a lot of time with her rather than writing this.
Draco sighs, then nods.
“Oh, Remus, Narcissa might show up at your door, just a warning. It’ll be perfect! We’ll get one of Hermione’s therapists to cure Draco, and Narcissa will be fine away from the Manor-”
“The funerals.” She says plainly, pausing to sip again before continuing. “Sorting out the wills, planning the ceremonies, editing the family line, adjusting my own will… There is a lot to do when the remainders of your family die.”
“Why?” Harry pauses, halfway out of his chair. “What has he done wrong?”
Sorry for the late update, again, there's a lot of family and friends visiting.
“I wish you could speak. Then you could tell me about Harry, and about Remus, and about what they’re doing. You’re probably the only person who knows about them who is going to pass through for a long time. Now, I’ll probably have to wait until another family member dies, which will hopefully be a long time.”
“This is the last day you’re wallowing in self-pity. Tomorrow, I’m gonna drag your ass out of there so we can eat ice cream and plan revenge on Nott, ok?”
The snake slithers in a circle with a pleased hiss.
“What’s your name?”
Zabini, Blaise
But… this isn’t Draco’s choice to make. Much as he would like to rely on Harry to levitate a blanket to him when his wandless magic is too volatile, he can’t stop Harry from doing this. He’s clearly thought about it, otherwise he wouldn’t look so nervous and still bring it up. This is Harry’s choice.
Silence. Draco’s hands are clenched in his covers, and at some point he must have lost control because his cheeks are wet and he has no idea why. Theo’s hands drop from his ears, wiping away a thin trail of blood dribbling down.
2. What should the dorm layout be like? Should I pair them by house or mix things up? (and any requests for who shares with who are appreciated)
Draco shudders, horror rising rapidly. His father is dead. He hadn’t even visited him since he’d been taken away, and now the man who Draco had adored since he was born is dead. Eyes blurring, Draco desperately drinks in every part of his dead father, knowing with awful certainty that this will be the last time he ever sees him.
For me, I definitely read a lot of Assassination Classroom, but only specifically about Gakushuu. Harry Potter is up there, again specifically Draco things, as evident by this fanfic. BNHA about Todoroki, and Bakugou, but never Izuku (please don't kill me but Izuku kinda annoys me in canon). Then there's The Umbrella Academy, which I've only really started reading recently, and sometimes if I'm really running out of interest in everything I'm currently reading, I'll read Sherlock or Merlin things. I hesitate with the Merlin stuff, because it's such a part of my childhood that having adult stuff about it in fanfic is just... weird to read.
“Harry.” McGonagall smiles, picking a cucumber sandwich from a passing plate. “Are you doing well?”
Draco curls into his father’s lap, six years old with a recently broken arm, tears streaking down his face. It’s not often this happens, but his mother is out and his father had not wanted the house elves to comfort him. His gentle hand strokes through Draco’s fluffy hair, body relaxed and giving off a soothing warmth.
“STOP!!!”
Besides, Draco’s yawning absence is always there, a huge black hole, an uneasy gap that makes them all a little too snappy and a little less wary of boundaries. He can forgive them until Draco is safe and back with them.
“Jaebo is wondering what the miss’ name is?” The house elf waves a hand up at her, eyes wide. Whoever had drawn him didn’t quite get the eyes symmetrical, more wonky, although that could be on purpose.
Draco digs his nails into the palm of his hand, a flood of unexpected resentment rising up inside of him. Black is his family member. Black is his first cousin once removed. Black grew up in the same sort of household as him, yet Black doesn’t care one bit that Draco is dead. Instead, he’s worried about Potter, who seems to be doing just fine without Black.
“Harry, this was only for the spell-” Theo starts, worried, but Harry cuts him off, caught up in his own excitement.
He lets out a shuddering breath, giving up on the words caught in his throat. It’s not okay. It’s never okay. Harry deserves someone so much better than him, someone who can say they love him without having a massive breakdown over it.
Speaking of Ron. Harry wanders over to him, raising a hand in a wave. Ron grins back, slinging an arm around his shoulders when he’s close enough.
He walks forward, taking the chair opposite McGonagall and clasping his hands in his lap. She carries on writing, quill flicking in the air, but nods to him as though to give him permission to speak.
He rolls his eyes defeatedly, and flicks his wand in the air in brief irritated swipes. ‘I don’t want them to see me like this. They’ll get worried, and distracted, and won’t see the next hex or jinx thrown their way.’
Potter and his friends are at the front, despite their intolerance of Argus, voices raised in boisterous chatter. Pigs. Can’t they lower their voices just a little?
2. What should the dorm layout be? Paired by house or mixed up? (any requests for specific pairings are appreciated)
“Shut up! Shut up! I think I saw him move!”
“I think there might be more people in there.” Luna peers into the wispy gauze of magic, the closest person to it.
Draco nods again, raising his hands hopelessly to indicate he has no idea either.
“Yes, but it has calming ones, doesn’t it? The animals in the Forbidden Forest like to eat it when it's’ getting close to the full moon. Isn’t it used in some Calming Draughts?” Theo comments, looking to Luna too.
He giggles, scrambling to his feet and patting himself down. He isn’t dead!
Be warned: most of you will not be happy with this. What happens in this is not permanent, however! Please don't murder me for it!
She opens her mouth to respond, then closes it, blinking rapidly. Her fingers are tight on the cup. Harry’s scared it might break, shattering and falling apart, and he imagines for a moment that the cup is her heart.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There’s a brief silence. Narcissa’s fingernails tap against the skin of the cup, harsh and loud in the quiet. A clock, somewhere in the house, ticks.
The excitement dries up rapidly when they stop at the bottom of a spiral staircase. Harry starts leading him up, but pauses as he sees Draco’s face. “What is it?”
There’s a tense silence as the two of them stand there, Harry straining towards going up, and Draco recoiling from the place where his life went to shit. Eventually, Harry sighs and moves away from it, crestfallen.
And suddenly it’s like he’s filled with power, a tsunami of new magic flooding his system and flowing to his hand, which gives one final jerk and rips both of them out of the Veil and onto hard stone. His eyes fly open, as he doesn’t need to concentrate with this influx of strength, and he sees pale skin and pale hair, lying beside dark hair and dark eyes.
Harry, Ron, and Terry are the last left in the common room, and end up talking late. Really, Harry is waiting for them to leave so he can call Remus, but the conversation is enjoyable. Terry tells them he wants to work in the Ministry, and had returned to Hogwarts so that there’s no chance they could turn him down for being ‘underqualified’.
Draco pulls his knees to his chest, letting them fall into contemplative silence. The Ministry ambition had mostly been his father’s hopes, and now that he thinks about it, it’s hard to see how he would have any chance of being accepted there. Hogwarts is bad enough. Working with potions would be nice, but he couldn’t find work in Saint Mungos. Who would put their life in the hands of an ex-Death Eater?
“No, you’re not. Draco, can we please talk together? I think you’ll want to hear this.” She says gently.
For anyone who doesn't understand, go to the end notes.
Harry’s voice stops behind him. Draco doesn’t notice, delighting in the feel of his voice rumbling in his throat, bursting out and speaking words he’s trapped inside for so long.
‘Do you still think you were right to do those things in the war?’
That’s what the great Harry Potter has become. A nothing who trails after his friends, blindly hoping for a purpose again.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Carefully, Draco shakes his head. The elated feeling bubbles through him, lifting his chin high and shoving his thoughts away. ‘Can we stay? I bet I could beat Potter in a game of Exploding Snap.’
(See the end of the chapter for
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry and Hermione both snigger as he darts away to grab cake from a plate, Blaise flicking his wand to see Ron chasing after the now speeding dish.
“Yes.” Hermione nods fervently, turning back to her work. “Pansy is right. Remus, you and McGonagall can get through to them, I know it. The rest of us can just leave it up to them. Come on, you two, there’s some wrapping paper you can be working with…”
“Nah.” Ron frowns, shifting between his feet. “Imagine if it didn’t work. She’d be even more crushed.” He exchanges a glance with Harry. “Losing a son once is bad enough.”
Enjoy!
“Mistress would like mister Potter to follow Gobsy, sir.” A house elf pops into sight next to him, bony fingers fiddling with a silver sash.
(“Isn’t it beautiful? The note says his mother made it by hand.” Luna swoops over to a tiny full-body outfit, green silk sewn in at the waist and a silver sash sliding from shoulder to hip.)
Enjoy!
“Blaise!” She calls, and the handsome devil appears by her side, yet more buttons undone on his shirt.
Huffing, he swings himself onto the carpeted floor, stumbling at the sudden lightness in his head. His legs shake, so he sits once more, resigning himself to calling a house elf to help him. They had all been under Vold-...the Dark Lord’s control when he had arrived here, so it was a shock when he found a few of them still in the house after he was defeated. Secretly, he’s grateful. His mother needs someone to keep her company in her house arrest, with his father in Azkaban, and Draco...like he is.
“Me, and Ginny. I’ll pay for us both.” He watches her scribble it down. “So what is this new charity, anyway?”
Draco trails behind the rest of them, his house separate from the main huddle. While McGonagall had noticed his unusual attire, she had apparently decided against calling him out on it, for which Draco was especially thankful. He doesn’t think he could have handled the sudden attention.
‘What?’ Draco frowns, looking at his nervous expression.
He forces himself to calm down enough to not hex Malfoy when he raises his arms, or when he straightens up. See? No need for hexing. The ferret hasn’t got a wand in his hand anyway, unlike his friend.
She slaps his arm lightly. “No touching until you’ve put your wand away. I refuse to be the victim of an accidental spell.”
His father runs a hand over his harrowed face, the lines in his face creasing as despair sets in. “You were supposed to be safe. I’m so sorry. I thought- When I died, I thought you would be safe. I thought they’d be happy enough that I was gone that they would leave you alone! Draco, I’m so, so sorry!”
Woo! Mock exams are done, and Christmas is approaching! Hope you haven't been too desperate for me to update... Remember to look out for my Christmas special either on Christmas Eve or Christmas day. And any comments or suggestions are appreciated, especially if you have any suggestions for the Christmas special (I haven't started writing it yet... less than three days to do so!).
Footsteps. The others have run off, now that Potter is distracted. Unfortunately, Draco didn’t see their faces before he fell. Not like he could tell McGonagall or Slughorn anyway. Potter almost murdered him in sixth year, and got away with detention. Four Gryffindors only kicking him around a bit? They’d get a medal.
White material shines back at him. Confused, he pulls the last of the paper off, and stares at the blank canvas and painting set. What does this mean? Is the blank canvas supposed to signify that he and Harry don’t have a future together?
“Nott looks like he needs one.” Ron hints not-so-subtly, eyes flicking to watch Blaise.
“You can be free and pretty without needing to break your arm.” Lucius sighs. “When you go to Durmstrang, you will be playing Quidditch against boys much stronger and bigger than you.”
An elbow jabs into his ribs. “Wake up, darling. We’re here.”
“Harry.” Remus’ sharp voice cuts in as he enters, papers clenched in his hand. “That’s enough. It’s no one’s fault. Draco and Sirius are back with us, this isn’t the time to start attacking each other for helping them. If he hadn’t used your magic, they would still be dead.”
Woah! So many responses! It's wonderful to hear about you all, seems there's a lot of slytherins here. (Although this is a fanfic focused on Draco, a slytherin, so I really shouldn't be surprised...) Next question is at the bottom! I can't wait to see what you think.
So, yeah, he wasn’t surprised that they couldn't look at his new scar.
Draco winces, carefully prying Pansy from him. Instantly, she grabs his hand and pushes him back onto the seat, flouncing down beside him. “Oh, darling! You’re so thin! What happened to you?” She fusses, gazing at him with over-wide eyes.
“Shouldn’t you talk to Draco about this?” She whispers, nervously picking at her skirt. Pansy’s closeness is making her face heat up more. She probably looks like a tomato. She hopes not. It’s not like Pansy will ever like her in that way, considering the girl is straight, but she’d rather not be thought of as ugly by the most attractive girl in the school. Except for Ginny, and Astoria, and Lily from Hufflepuff, of course.
“Better?” Blaise smirks, brushing away a speck of dust on his shoulder. “I hadn’t noticed. Maybe we should try another round, and you can show me again how dismally poor you are at this.”
"Mr Corner, perhaps I am wrong to assume you are all adults. I'm afraid there are no bubbling children to cover up your words, therefore I would appreciate you tell me directly if you take issue with my decision."
Trembling, he digs his teeth into his bottom lip, trying desperately not to cry. The shadows in the corners leer at him, whispering how it is his fault, how he’s so selfish to be crying. He did this, why should he be allowed to cry? Draco was Narcissa’s child, her only child who had protected her until his death, and she is the one with the right to cry over him. Not Harry.
Harry is a different matter. There’d been a long silence when he said he didn’t understand how he did that, how he didn’t think he had the guts. Harry had killed him. Accidentally, but… he had died because of Harry.
Yes, I know, that's a very lazy title for this chapter but I can't think of a better one. I think quarantine is turning my brain to mush. I hope you're all staying inside and staying safe.
“Tell us what? What’s happened with the rooming arrangements, Ronald?” Hermione’s voice has an edge of anticipation.
“First of all, a welcome to all first years. I’m sure you will make us all proud of you during your time here, provided you work hard. You are lucky enough to have come to Hogwarts at a time of peace, so try to make the most of it. This leads me to my next point.” She tilts her head down, looking severely down her nose at them. “While we may have felt losses during the war, we must all learn to find a healthy way to grieve. Those who passed during the war must be remembered in a respectful way, or their sacrifice for a peaceful world will have been for nothing. I’m sure most of you will have heard about the attacks on innocent civilians during the summer.”
Theodore glances up through the holes in the shack, wolfsbane ready in his hand. He hates this. There’s no reason to go through it, without anyone waiting for him on the other side with a smile and an open heart. Father’s in Azkaban, again, and Draco is hiding away in his room. If he died in this shack, would anyone care? Would anyone come looking for him? Would anyone cry when they buried him in the ground? He doubts it.
They skirt around the edge of that corridor, turning away once more, and Draco loosens his grip. He won’t have to confront that problem today, then. Not quite yet.
She turns her head, raising an eyebrow at the girl glaring at her. “Yes, Pansy?”
“Shut up, you idiot.” Harry huffs, dropping into a seat. “How am I supposed to stop someone from thinking they’ve caused the death of hundreds of people?”
“Harry! I thought something had happened to you. I tried calling last night, and- oh. Hello you two.”
There he is, the stupid green-eyed prick, the one whose kiss Draco can still feel on his forehead. An inexplicable joy fills him, burning brighter than he has ever felt before. He isn’t dead (he’s alive!) and he’s staring at the foolish handsome face that makes his heart soar and merlin, he loves him so so so much, and so maybe his future self will forgive him when he leaps forward and wraps his arms (his clear, smooth, unmarked arms) around the absolute dickhead and smashes his lips against his.
“Should we bring Mrs Malfoy?” Pansy glances around at them all. “He is her son.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It’s the werewolf. Of course it is.
It doesn’t matter.
He still can’t quite convince himself he’s more than a murderer, but at least it’s improvement. When he feels like sinking into the pit in his stomach, he’s learnt to ask Poppy for another blanket, which she and Sirius have adopted as their private code for ‘please talk to me, I’m not feeling great’. Sometimes he hates it, wishes they would care less about him and let him stew in self-pity. But most of the time he’s grateful, listening to Sirius ramble on about motorcycles or his horrible family, or watching Jaebo pull faces and dance about.
With that, he steps back, and the glow vanishes. Complete silence. His heart thuds in his chest as he looks around at all of the enraptured faces, every one startled into silence.
Prester Gohun. DECEASED.
“Hey, Malfoy? How are you… Are you feeling ok?” Potter. Of course the Saviour Upon High would come sniffing. In the eyes of the Gryffindors, time spent alone by Slytherins must mean they’re plotting Armageddon, right?
“Hm?” Theo glances up, flicking ash across the floor.
How is he dead? Draco’s mind accelerates, confusion and dread flooding his veins. His father is supposed to be in Azkaban. Locked away and probably miserable, but alive in his cell. How is he here?
“Good. That’s good.”
“Alright, okay, I won’t go in there.” Harry frowns, looking about him. The room is clean, but the windows have a darkening charm on them, and candles are scattered everywhere. A book lies on the bedside table, along with an empty tray, and Harry wanders over to investigate. The smell hits him then, and he has to stop himself from bursting into tears.
Remus frowns. “That doesn’t sound like a good idea, Harry. What are you planning to do with this spell?”
“How is miss feeling?” Gobsy blinks up at her as he slips onto the seat. Poor creature. He’s an incessant worrier, perhaps verging on paranoid. She doesn’t blame him; having the Dark Lord in the same house as you does that to a creature.
“Went well?” His friend says cheerily. “Managed to convince him to spill all his secrets with that famous charm of yours? Saved everyone’s souls while you’re at it?”
So maybe he can’t speak, and maybe he always feels shit, and maybe he can’t see much of a future for himself.
“Are you thinking about Draco again?”
Draco is having a plan. A giganticus plan!
“I’m getting to that.” Theo sighs, rolling his eyes. “Some say she eventually decided that other people were getting too good at casting her spells, and so she cursed the spells themselves. Unless the caster had her blood, the spell would fail. Only her descendants could undo the spell, too.”
“No.” He leans back in his chair, draping a hand over the back of it. “It’s not hard to guess. Phoenixes are fabulous, I’m fabulous. There’s a strong link.”
“I’ll bring Jaebon.” Luna taps her pocket. “He’ll want to see a familiar face.”
The corkboard hangs between the two staircases, with only one sheet of paper stuck in the middle. Neville is the first to get there, reading the rooms twice before his eyes widen.
“Mister Potter for you, mistress.” The house elf bows low, nose brushing the stone floor, and then pops from sight.
He never thought he’d go back. Even if he was allowed to, he would never want to. The prospect of going to Hogwarts was nonexistent, in Draco’s eyes. Yet here he is, clutching a letter that is forcing him to for a whole year. The parchment crumples easily between his long, pale fingers, the only thing that has come easy to him in months. First, there was waiting for the trial to come, in a house smeared with memories of V- Vol-... the Dark Lord. Then there was the trial itself, having to face everything he’d done in a brutal few hours, fully convinced he was going to rot in Azkaban until the Golden Boy decided to vouch for him. Draco knew he had a saving-people thing, but turning up at the trial of the boy who did all of this, and defending him? It’s still too much for Draco to handle.
Question time!
Didn't expect this scene to be as long as it is, but at least you get another early chapter out of it! The loose ends are being tied up, the character flaws are being thought about, the jobs are being assigned, and the ending is approaching. I may have underestimated the number of chapters last time I guessed how much there was left, so... I'll say there's around seven chapters left now, give or take.
Who is your favourite character in the wizarding world? It can be from Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Cursed Child, or even my fanfiction if you really can't decide.
Should I write the scene where Luna gives Dobby's grave the uniform? Who else should be there?
‘The intended does not have to answer verbally, however it is recommended. If they answer truthfully, the spellcaster must kiss their forehead, and the spell will be cast. If they answer dishonestly, the spellcaster must spit out the meal and the spell will be null.’
“If the teachers and the ministry agree, we can do it!” Harry declares, seeing Neville’s face light up. “We might have to share with Theo, sorry man, but it could happen!”
It’s taking too long, and Theo’s already ignoring him, he can see it on his face, and Draco’s furious aren’t impressing him, and Draco’s so sick of everyone treating him like a defenseless kid, because he’s not, his words are valid, he can’t be ignored, and- and- and-
“You have to!”
“Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to…” Harry Boy-Who-Lived-Twice Potter trails off, apology replaced with shock. “Malfoy?”
A muttering starts to spread through the hall, cut off when she raises her hand abruptly. Attacks? Draco frowns slightly, wishing he’d picked up at least one newspaper during all that time in bed.
The bottle falls to the ground as the pain starts.
He shakes his head, then curses himself. He shouldn’t be responding to the man. If he is under a hallucination curse, he would look insane right now, shaking his head at nothing.
They leave the room. Fresh, cold air sweeps over Draco’s skin, awakening his body in shock. It’s bright, almost too bright for his eyes. Hermione doesn’t seem bothered by it all, walking ahead with Draco in tow, through the corridor and into the common room.
“...and I’m sorry I wasn’t there in time. I… I didn’t realise how bad things were getting. I promise it won’t happen again, Malfoy.”
Then Malfoy scowls at him, ignoring the box, and turns over to put his back to Harry. Conversation over.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“I did your hair this morning!”
Of course. Draco had given it to Luna so she could lay it over Dobby’s grave. Harry had been such an idiot back then, bursting into a girl’s dormitory because he actually thought Draco would kill her, the one person from another house who didn’t hate him.
Luckily for Draco, this means he isn’t completely stuck with only an estranged family member and a sketch of a house elf for company. While Harry does visit every day, twice a day, and sometimes during the night with his invisibility cloak, he does have his own lessons and life to be getting on with. Draco’s own schoolwork is delivered in the form of recordings through the smoke spell Pansy has been perfecting. She sets a spare wand to keep running the spell during the lesson, and Draco has finally perfected the wandless flying note charm to ask the professors for help when he needs it.
No, that would be useless. Unless he casts it on himself, of course, which he is very tempted to do. Shoving his body’s protests to the furthest corner of his mind, he flips the page.
Inside, everything is exactly as it had been. The only difference is the professors sitting at the head, and the number of students left to be there. Every table has gaps, not noticeable to any newcomer, yet so large and gaping that a stab of guilt rips through Draco’s stomach. Gaps where grinning faces once talked and laughed together. Now they will never laugh again.
“Is it… are they being cruel to you?” She asked gently, well aware that pureblood society is not kind. Just like in the muggle world, the higher classes expect those being bullied to keep a stiff upper lip, and hold their tongue.
“She was saying there’s actually a way for wishes to be granted, and I said if that were true, my first wish would be to be a Hogwarts professor.” Harry rambles, taking his first hesitant bite of the treacle tart. “What would yours be?”
Fate never goes the way he wants it to.
He shook his head, snorting at the very idea. She’d breathed a sigh of relief at that. Volunteering to teach Draco, of all people, was weird enough. Defending him from his own friends would be bizarre.
There’s no doubt it was the Slytherins, not by the smug smirks that most of them are parading about in. He passes a small group of them now, sixth year girls, who glance at the red jewels clinging to his hair and giggle. Fist tightening inside his pocket, he flicks his wand at them, sending a sudden gust of wind into their hair. They squeal, frantically trying to save their hairstyles, and he moves on. It’s petty, he knows, but after a full day of the snide whispers, he’s had enough.
Draco snorts inwardly. Well, he’d said yes, so he can’t back out of it now. ‘Got it.’
“Headmistress…” He starts, then pauses, his prepared speech flying out of the window. “Uhm… I would give you a long, well-thought-out speech, but I’m not too good at those, so…” Not too good at remembering them, either. “I’ll just ask you straight up.” Ouch, ok, neither is he good at improvising. Might as well come out with it before he messes up again. “Would you let me drop from lessons and train to be the next groundskeeper with Hagrid?”
Enjoy!
Harry’s fingers adjust their grip as Malfoy’s shadowed eyes wander about. He doesn’t speak. Harry scowls, getting impatient. The ferret just stands there, silent, watching Parkinson with a desperate spark in his eye. Desperate? What could he have to be desperate about? No, Harry concludes, he’s just acting, so they’ll lower their guard.
He’d glanced up, stormy eyes set in dark sockets, looking more and more like a skeleton every day. He rarely answers her questions, instead nodding or shaking his head. She supposes the spell must be tiring; it’s not one she’s read about before, and new spells always take years to condense down into an easier version. So he simply stared, a blank expression on his face.
Argus doesn’t stop, throwing a “What?” over his shoulder.
“Because, as I keep telling you, people with mental difficulties need friendly support. So I’m his friend. Which is really strange to say, but it’s the truth now. As McGonagall said, the war is over, and we need to focus on building positive relationships.” She says firmly.
“Harry’s doing it again.” Ron observes through a mouthful of food.
“Bloody hell.” Ron shakes his head. “I don’t need heeled boots. If you are actually gonna make this fashion line thing, you better include at least one pair of decent flat boots. I’m not wearing heels.”
He rolls his eyes, dropping the paintbrush in the pot and slowly maneuvering his wand over the picture of a sad house elf. For a moment, he thinks he sees the creature blink at him, but that can’t be real. He can barely dry the painting with his magic, how could he make it come to life?
Suddenly, he jolts up, eyes flaring wide open as a thought occurs to him. “Remus! You said Sirius might be in Limbo, right?”
A hand shoots up from the right of Harry, dangerously close to slicing off his ear.
Apparently Parkinson loses the battle, because a second later she pipes up.
Hermione lowers her wand. “Oh, I see. I don’t remember what happened to it. I could ask Harry about it.”
“Not so busy, regretfully.” She laughs quietly, instinctively. “There is not much to do in the Manor. Although, I suppose there will be much to do soon.”
“It was two days ago, in the morning.” He begins, heart in his throat. “The night before, I had… I cast a spell on Draco. I wanted to make him feel better, so I cast a spell to grant a wish of his. He wished for his D- Dark Mark to be gone, but something must have gone wrong because he-.... Narcissa, I didn’t mean for it to happen, I… He c-c-carved it out, and he died. I’m sorry. Merlin, I’m so sorry.”
- E.D.
With that, he leaves, Pansy clinging to his arm and complaining about something or another.
“Ron, don’t be ridiculous. Parkinson won’t hex you when she’s surrounded by us.” Hermione sighs, looking drained as she stows her wand up her sleeve. “Let’s ignore them for now, they haven’t done anything yet.”
Granger, Hermione
So many comments! I love signing in and seeing all of your thoughts on the story, or on the question, or on anything at all! Anyway, another question at the bottom.
Shit. He hadn’t thought this far ahead. “Uhm, so, I saw you sitting here, and you didn’t look all that happy, so-”
He can’t tell her what he’s done. He deserves to be dead, not Draco. He has no one waiting at home for him, no one who would be all alone without him. Draco had done anything and everything to protect his mother, had been the only person he truly protected and loved, and he hadn’t even said goodbye to her. Because of Harry.
Harry grins, a puff of air escaping him. “Thank you. Really, I won’t let you down, I’ll prepare for everything and set out plans, Hermione-style. Thank you.”
“No.” Remus glances between them. “Kreacher tends to steal them when they arrive.”
Finally, there was the aftermath. The unbearable effort of getting out of bed every day, walking through memories in every room, venturing out so little his skin became practically translucent. By the time the owl arrived, he had resorted to staying in bed all day and night, in a haze of half-sleep, ignoring the trays of food left by his bedside. The burst of anger is a welcome change from the numb feeling that has consumed him.
Why can’t he say it?! I love you, I love you, I love you! It’s three words! Why can’t he say it?!
Well... how about a question to distract from all of that?
Harry’s entire body is tense. It’s been too long since he was in a situation like this, pointing a wand at someone who might attack him, and he’s slightly ashamed to say he’s enjoying it a little too much. The adrenaline is pumping through him, faster, faster, urging him to stop waiting and protect himself. Or attack the half crouching boy in front of him. Either would be fine.
- E.D.
“Inter house unity and all that bullshit probably.” Blaise hisses, anger reducing him to using swear words.
“Narcissa, we should head out for some food.” Remus suggests, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You haven’t eaten yet.”
“No, it’s actually going to be Pansy running it.” Hermione shrugs. “I’m starting in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in three weeks, if the woman who interviewed me a few days ago is to be believed. Not the Aurors, the law-making office. I’ll be working as an assistant for people drawing up new legislation, seeing how it all works. Sorry I didn’t tell you two earlier, I’ve just been so busy sorting everything out.”
A whisper of a memory drifts through his mind. McGonagall at the first feast of the year, reminding them to be civil to each other. Warning them about what’s happening on the outside. Telling them of vigilantes, who take revenge on their lost loved ones, killing anyone associated with Death Eaters. How far could they go? Draco hadn’t been paying attention. To kill the person who made all of the deaths possible, of course they’d break into Hogwarts.
“Hello, Harry.”
How on earth is he supposed to fight that?
Not only that, but they are both using magic that is foreign to them. A large part of their energy is made up of Blaise and Harry’s magic, which is unfamiliar and harder to work. Countless times they’ve both cast a spell for it to blow up from the unexpected power from Harry, or for it to slip from their grasp and cast something completely unexpected because of Blaise’s impulsivity.
This only makes him scowl more. "Too good to talk to me now, Malfoy? I expected at least some politeness after what I did, if not any thanks, but I guess not." He folds his arms and marches off towards a ginger head bobbing inside a crowd.
“Oh, sure.” Harry digs in his pocket and brings out a few galleons, handing them over. “I’ll put in more when I’ve got stuff from Gringotts.”
His throat may feel like a cat has clawed the insides out, but Draco has an enormous smile stretched across his face. This. This is what he wants to feel like forever. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t know what he’s going to do next, it doesn’t matter that he doesn’t think he’ll ever feel like this again. He’s happy - if happy is an appropriate word for the unadulterated energy pumping through his body.
“Which is why Slytherins suck!” Ginny gripes, nose wrinkled as she follows Luna and falls onto the sofa. “I don’t get the Draco thing, but Nott is a huge asshole.”
“Hey, hey, it’s ok!” Harry pulls him into a hug, arms holding him tightly. “You don’t have to tell me right now. I understand.”
“Is this gonna be your full-time gig, then?” Ron mumbles, grin slipping at her appearance. The two of them had split up not long ago, although Harry has a feeling it’s only temporary, to give each of them space. They’d never resolved the issue of Hermione wanting independence to follow her own dreams, so Harry thinks this is maybe their way of doing that - letting Hermione find her feet and have a set path in what she wants before getting together again.
Enjoy!
Limbo? Harry’s been into Limbo. Where he saw Dumbledore and where he chose to go back. Sirius is there?
“This is all just rumour, you know, Binns made that very clear, but in theory… yes.”
He flicks to the next page, then pauses and flicks back. Granting wishes?
He shakes his head quickly, blinking back tears as he moves to tear off the last piece. He knows he isn’t good enough for the Saviour, knows all that faces him is rejection, so he might as well be brave in the face of his own destruction.
“Malfoy?”
He stops, words stuck on the tip of his tongue as he stares at Remus. “What?”
The tray falls from his hand, plate and cup smashing over the floor.
“Miss Luna, Miss Hermione drew these letters, here. Not Jaebo.”
“Remember, it’s like reaching out a hand.” Theo calls from behind him, notes and books on the table in front of him. They’d gone over this hundreds of times in the last few days, so neither he nor Hermione truly needed to be there. Still, if it comforted them to keep reminding him of what he had to do, he’d put up with them.
“No offense, ‘Mione, but you’re not great at sorting out other people’s emotions. Besides, Harry’s the one who’s so bothered about him.” He grins at him. “And besides, he’s just broken up with Nott. No time like the present, am I right?”
“I was under a lot of pressure!”
“Anyway, the point is… I’m sorry about everything that’s happened. I’m sorry I was mean to you, even though you did deserve it back then, and I’m sorry you had to live with Voldemort, and-”
- E.D.
“Had you just eaten or drank anything?”
He steps back, face closing off quickly. “This was a bad idea. I’m leaving.” Turning around, he begins to flee, but Luna grabs his elbow and pulls him back.
“Study hard and think about things and be smart.” Draco summarises, closing his eyes and snuggling further into his father’s warmth. “And then I can be the best, and I can fly really really high and I can fly all the way up to grandma and tell her about my school and the garden and the things I’ve been practising, and she can tell me what it’s like where she is…”
“HOW can you say you don’t regret so many people DYING directly at YOUR hands?!”
“No. You need to put some charms on the door, stop all the noise getting through.”
All fifteen of them gape at McGonagall, horror evident. Not being able to stay in Gryffindor tower? Worse, having to share a common room with Slytherins?! Harry exchanges astonished faces with Ron, whose ears are turning red, and glances involuntarily at the Slytherins.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“Uhh… he might… like him.”
Question:
“Hi, Harry!” Ginny sounds overly excited as she greets him, likely hoping he’ll change the subject rapidly. The three of them have a habit of spiralling into obscure topics, linking plants and creatures and Luna’s psychological research like there’s no tomorrow.
“Draco?” Sirius looks alarmed, scrambling to his feet. “What’s going on?”
Draco pauses in the doorway, glancing between Pansy and Theodore. She offers him a grim smile.
The letters drizzle down onto the floor in fat droplets, but neither of them comment. Instead, Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads them up slowly, checking back every few seconds to see if he’s ok. He has to stop, once or twice, to push away the memories (green flash, mad laugh, the trees waving below for him to just lean a little bit more and join them) yet within twenty minutes they’re at the top and he can finally breathe.
“Pansy?”
Harry’s hand starts trembling around Blaise’s wrist. He doesn’t care. He draws deeper, further, wrapping the bubble into a cocoon as words flow from his lips. When he finishes, he stabs the bubble, watches it burst, watches the magic fly to the two people inside, revels in the feeling of holding two living beings in the palm of his hand.
Draco lifts his chin, voice bursting with defiance and life as he speaks.
Snuffling, Draco lets the world fade around him, and dreams of stars and moons consume him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“When did he tell you this?” Pansy sits down heavily on the floor opposite Luna, face amused. Or it could be exasperated. Or annoyed. Luna doesn’t really know. The pixie behind her can tell her later if she asks him, but she’s never talked to them before, so they could disappear right after this conversation. She hopes not. The portraits are always so much nicer than other students, since no one else talks to them a lot.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right. 10th chapter. This one's a dramatic one, so buckle up your seatbelts!
Everyone remains frozen, staring at the space the caretaker used to be. A few seconds pass in deathly silence. Abruptly, his face appears, twisted in annoyance.
And Draco’s mother…
“Luna, how did you know about sixth year?”
His real father is dead. He’ll never know all those flaws Draco kept hidden. This painting is only a copy, and what’s the point of spending so long perfecting it if Draco still only hides and buries himself beneath layers of doubt? If this is not the time to show him his true self, when will it be?
“Was that a please? From our Lord and Saviour, the One Spell Wonder, the Boy Who Lived Twice, Harry James Potter?” Blaise presses a hand to his chest in mock surprise as he stands. “Never thought I’d see the day when our beloved scarhead would beg me.”
“No, missus, Miss Pansy not a painter, she says.”
Harry’s eyes fly open and he grins, hope swelling inside of him. “We can save Draco! From Limbo!”
He nods, glancing down at the table. Shame fills him. All she wants him to do is eat, and here he is having a massive panic attack over it. His eyes drift over the bread and apple again, hopeful, yet the sickening unrest in his stomach refuses.
“Was it Hermione?”
Pansy: >:(
Parkinson, under the judging eyes of Zabini and Malfoy, slowly lowers her wand. The ferret breathes out imperceptibly, and settles back down onto the floor, effectively removing himself from the scene.
“You know she’s not going to leave Blaise.” Harry turns to Hermione, putting a hand on her shoulder. “It’ll just make this worse.”
From then on, Parkinson - or Pansy, now - joins their study sessions. Harry, obviously, would rather fail at chess with Ron. Or Zabini. Ever since Pansy has been friendly to Hermione, Zabini has been offering Ron a fair chance at beating someone of his own skill. Unsurprisingly, it’s taken Ron a while to accept. Pansy has thankfully kept quiet about Harry’s crush on Draco, so it’s always with trepidation when Hermione hears Pansy deviate from their work.
Draco smiles slightly, waving him off.
“Blaise?”
“Thank you, kind aurors.” She smiles at them politely, noting the way they glance at each other apprehensively. “I appreciate the time you took out of your busy schedule to escort me. I’m sure our community will be proud to hear you’ve been taking me from one place to another when these so-called ‘vigilantes’ are still at large.”
“Draco.”
“I lo-l-”
"Come on. They're not worth it, Pans." Blaise murmurs to her, then raises his voice. "Fucking coward. Got a problem, they should say so to our faces!"
There’s a few moments of joking as the two struggle with the tightly packed wrapping paper (“Why did you put three layers on one box Hermione?” “I just had to make sure it wouldn’t fall apart!”) and then Black finally gets his open, revealing two books.
‘Why did you do it?’
“No, Harry, listen.” The other boy rubs his eyes frustratedly. “Only her descendants. After she died, her son felt guilty for all of the horrible results from backfiring spells. He wasn’t powerful enough to undo her work, but he found a way to change it. No one could truly die as a result of a spell backfiring. Instead, they would be sent to a safe place until he, her only descendant, could undo the spell. In time, people learned not to cast any of her spells, and so he stopped needing to save people and moved on.”
“Hey, Draco?” Harry pulls away slightly, looking at him in worry. “What is it?”
Harry’s voice lowers, becoming an undertone to Draco’s lessening stutter.
“Anyway, Harry, what’s wrong? You only firecall this late if there’s a problem.”
“Theo says he wanted to see you. Something about a book and fairy godmothers.”
Harry rubs his face, pushing past the man to approach the gates. He thought people knew that. He’d told everyone at her trial, although he supposes the newspapers aren’t likely to print that. The Boy Who Lived Twice defending the wife of a Death Eater? No one would want to read that.
“No, you idiot!” He whacks him with a pillow. “Go talk to Nott. Wish me luck.”
“Good riddance.” She mutters, stepping back through into the common room. Most of the people had gathered in a large circle near the fire, gryffindors, slytherins, ravenclaws and hufflepuffs all mixed together like the socks in Potter’s drawers. She has no idea how the boy manages to get matching socks every day, but he must do so, otherwise Brainbox would complain. By complain, she means glare balefully until it is fixed. Merlin knows enough posters of Pansy’s have received that glare.
Professor McGonagall, now Headmistress, stands and claps her hands sharply, signalling for silence. Once the chattering has petered out, she begins to speak.
He stretches, shirt riding up. This time, Pansy’s tongue is pinned into place by her teeth. “Fine. I’ll do it. You keep an eye on everyone else, make sure none of them get too horny.”
“What are you thinking about?” Hermione frowns, pulling together the books and papers with a wave of her wand.
Draco nods, setting his potions essay down and rubbing his eyes. He holds his hand out, and Hermione watches a glass of water fly into it with pleased eyes. His non-verbal magic has been getting better, especially now he’s stopped using the useless wand. She could see from the second that he picked it up it was all the wrong shape and size for him.
“This is the last day you’re wallowing in self-pity. Tomorrow, I’m gonna drag your ass out of there so we can eat ice cream and plan revenge on Nott, ok?”
Speaking of…
He suddenly realises he’s been staring again, and sharply glances away. He’s not stalking the ferret. He wasn’t stalking him in sixth year either, no matter what Luna says, he was only trying to find out what he was up to. And he had been right, as well! Luna and the whole lot of them can shut up about it.
“I’m sorry.” Harry mutters, watching Nott gripping the counter tightly, his back to Harry. “I didn’t know. Is that why you’re working here?”
(See the end of the chapter for
- E.D.
“Harry?”
Fuck.
“I didn’t think you were.” Harry mumbles, then subconsciously glances at Nott’s left forearm, which he’s still holding onto. He lets go awkwardly, wondering if he’s hurt him. He knows Draco’s arm hurt a lot. It’s always wrapped in a thick layer of bandages, after all.
“I am ashamed of who I was then, but I refuse to be ashamed of who I am today. I’m going to live the best life I can, and by the end of it, I hope to be remembered for every good thing I’ve done, not the bad. I’ll miss my days at Hogwarts, even after everything. I’ll treasure these memories, and in ten years time, I want to see all of you taking your learning here to heart. To everyone standing here today, I’m proud of all of you. No matter what you’ve done.”
Sirius Black, the man whose face was splattered everywhere in their third year. The disgrace of the family. His aunt’s brother-in-law. A man who, by all rights, should be dead.
“How dare you!” He spits at them, adrenaline fizzing through him, awakening every sense in his body. “You don’t ever do that, not in this place!”
Don't have much else to say on this one, so...
For everyone who has been reading this up to the 12/11/19 , I am so, so sorry! The chapters have been mixed up due to drafts being saved when I didn't want them to be.
Draco takes in a shuddering breath, and nods.
Before he apparates, he pulls on a black beanie over his silver-blonde hair, tucking as much of it away as he can without looking stupid. Not that looking stupid matters. When you’re the cause of a mass murderer taking over the wizarding world, what you look like really doesn’t change anyone’s opinion.
Draco’s baleful glares when Harry says something sensitive. His sneering face right in front of Harry’s, just begging to be punched. His snooty sniffs as he passes Harry in the corridor, muttering an insult. His huge grin when Harry gave him his wand. His confused eyes when Harry stood up at his trial. His laugh, more of a breath than anything, when Harry lost yet another game of Exploding Snap.
With Harry’s solid weight behind him, and his friends falling over each other in their pride for him, he’s so glad he came back to Hogwarts.
Hermione regards it wearily, mind tearing out all the ways this could go wrong, yelling at her to leave and never speak to any of these fascist bullies ever again. Instead, she takes the hand and shakes it. “Truce.”
Is there even any point in him doing this? Draco had seemed happier at the party last week, playing the games and casting small firework charms. Harry remembered the tiny smile that he’d worn, as though his old wand had held all of his former happiness, and it’s now returned to him. He’d even talked to Ron, briefly.
Ok maybe that just spoiled the effect...
“Harry! I’ve been meaning to talk to you. The ministry workers have told me they’ve figured out the curse that sends people into Limbo, they just need to rework it to take people back. I don’t know how long it will be, but it's something, at least.” Remus’s face glows with happiness, a splodge of white paint across his cheek from earlier work on the house.
“That’s true.”
- E.D.
Right as she thinks she might turn around and demand an explanation, she hears a voice. Potter.
The grin vanishes quicker than a HIdebehind. “He… likes Draco? As in, like likes?”
“Two.”
“Those people were good people because of their actions. If I am here instead of them, I need to make sure I don’t waste the opportunity. We only get one life to live, and you never know when it might be cut short. To honour everyone we’ve lost, to make up for all the pain I’ve caused, I’m going to be the best person I can be. I’m going to work hard to help people.”
They share a kiss, Harry’s scent washing over him, and Draco feels a swell in his heart as he realises he can savour that comforting smell whenever he wants, now. Perhaps it isn’t healthy to depend so much on one person, yet Draco can’t bring himself to care.
Harry frowns, slotting the new information away. He wonders why he’d never heard of this before, considering he’s in the same year group. Then again, he did think he had a serial killer after him that year.
“Merlin, Neville, we wouldn’t just let you listen to- to that!” Harry splutters.
“You can’t!”
“Sorry…”
Despite the Ministry being badly understaffed, they are taking precautions against any applicants. After the war, with the whole wizarding world crippled, the Ministry has become mortally afraid of any corruption. The slightest ripple of trouble could send the whole structure tumbling at this rate.
Stupid. He’s so stupid.
- E.D.
Since when was this a thing? Hermione has never read anything about it, even though she spent hours pouring over old texts about house elves.
He crumples the paper in his hands, tossing it over his shoulder. His mother can sniff out a lie like a werewolf can sniff out prey.
“Decent. I’ve moved onto the kitchens, which Kreacher isn’t happy about, but microwaved meals are all the rage. I’ve learnt not to put forks and spoons in there.”
“Granger? Don’t you dare ignore me!”
‘Pansy.’
“The ministry is calling me a trainee Mind Healer.” Luna says, brushing off her previous confusion. “I don’t know why they aren’t calling me a therapist, but it’s either change the name entirely or stick ‘magical’ in front of it. I’ll take Mind Healer over that.”
“It’s never gonna stay down, you know.” Harry laughs, neatening the cuffs of his shirt.
“Merlin’s beard, Harry. Are you gonna crush on every Slytherin?” Ron collapses into another chair, throwing the cushion at the snake painting on the wall, which hisses at him and slithers away.
Apologies for the late update, though. At least it's given me time to have a plan for the next few chapters, and a one-shot I want to do with both Draco and Gakushuu, my favourites, as the main characters. Tell me if you want to see it done, and I'll start it as soon as possible (along with everything else of course...).
If you don't want details, just know I'll upload when I can. If you do, read on.

“Draco, you should be more careful with your broomstick. I won’t always be there to carry you back to the house.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” She rolls her eyes, turns, and marches to the common room. Blaise is focused on his homework, a huge essay due for the next day, so she sprawls over it and smiles at him sweetly. “Hey, Blaaaaiiiise?”
Draco glances around him. The room seems to go on forever, stretching out into the white mist, the two of them the only dots of colour in the place.
“Come on, it’s time you enjoy your own party.” He grins, taking her waist again and leading her to the circle. She rests her head on his shoulder, feeling the pleasant tingle of being tipsy.
They’d talked about it a few days ago. Hermione had just started to settle into their sessions, talking to him a little more, and her curiosity had got the better of her.
Fuck.
“Blimey, Harry, what took you so long? You and Draco get… distracted?”
He feels the tendrils of numbness every now and again. They wrap around his heart and his mind, tugging gently, welcoming him back to the haze he’d been trapped in at the Manor. It wouldn’t be such a bad thing to slip away again. He’d had his second chance, and ruined it, like he always does. All that’s left is to fade away from the earth forever.
Narcissa rises as Harry follows Gobsy into one of the vast rooms. The darkness seems to have seeped into her, shallow cheeks and pale skin giving a deathly glow that Harry wishes he couldn’t see. Her eyes are rimmed red. She had been crying. Does she already know what he is going to say?
Here's the questions if you can't be bothered:
- E.D.
The reaction is gradual, spreading like a ripple in a darkened lake. Older students, those who lost friends or family, notice them first, hate spitting from their eyes as they pull away. The younger ones, aware of the sudden tense atmosphere, recognise them too. First years only look a little confused, until brothers or sisters whisper in their ear, eliciting gasps of fear. By the time the spectacle has spread enough, their group of four has a wide circle of space around them.
Time limits? Merlin, whoever made this spell must really want it to fail.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Guess we'd better go. Good luck with whatever you're supposed to do this year!" Ginny beams, grabbing Luna's hand to pull her away.
“Sirius?” Harry breathes from next to him, the new magic wavering.
“Want a cigarette?” Theo speaks up after an hour of silence. He’s digging in his pocket, pulling out a packet that Harry vaguely recognises.
She only nods, gripping her cup like a lifeline. Gobsy pops into existence next to her, as though sensing her distress, and gently rests a hand on her knee.
Draco nods, forming a plus sign with his fingers and then pointing at Harry (and you). The grin on his face feels strange, but a welcome sort of strangeness that he can’t wait to get familiar with.
She wasn’t lying. The noise hits him like a bludger, laughs and shouts and for some reason, crying. He’s surprised no teacher has made the trek up here to yell at them for the volume of the music, but then he feels the wards on the doorway. Blaise’s work, he thinks. Then he wonders why on earth he would know that.
I wish you could have focused more on your own family, Draco thinks. I wish you could have seen what was happening, seen what would have happened to me, and tried to stop it instead of worrying about a boy who has everything he ever needed. Potter is fine without you.
“I’m trying.” Blaise hisses, yanking harder. Come on, Draco, he thinks, recognise me. Come on!
- E.D.
Then Lucius blinks, and they all freeze once more. “Draco?”
Draco’s blank eyes staring at the ceiling.
~~~~~~~~~
“Please, Draco. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for it to happen!”
“Haven’t you heard?” Luna drifts over to her place by the fire, carrying one of Neville’s plants. “Theo and Draco broke up. I’ve been trying to get some sap from this plant to calm Theo, but he hasn’t been talking to me. Aryana says it’s because he was only friends with me for Draco’s sake.”
“I thought he would be happy. I didn’t want him to be sad anymore. I’m sorry. I made a mistake, a horrible mistake, and now I can’t take it back.” Harry sniffles, nails pressing into his cup. “I’m sorry.”
“Master Draco can paint more peoples like Jaebo!” Jaebo squeals from the table, waving his arms to catch Draco’s attention.
“It’s a charm, you ninnies!”
A dream.
Leave, now. Harry only makes things worse by messing with other people’s business. Quick steps to the door, pushing aside a growing idea. Not now. She’s just lost both her husband and her son.
She cringes. “Yes.”
“That’s right.” Nott pulls out two mugs, rummaging in Hagrid’s haphazard cupboards for teabags. “Not everyone got off as easily as the Malfoys or the Parkinsons or the Zabinis. We didn’t have much money to begin with, and since they assume all us purebloods are rich, they took almost every penny. Dad’s in Azkaban, so he can’t make more. Why else do you think I wouldn’t have run off to Russia by now?”
“Are you sure you should do this, Harry?” Hermione looks at him nervously. “What if you don’t have enough-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry opens his mouth, then closes it, confusion and dread jumbling together. “You don’t know? Haven’t you, uh, read a newspaper?”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
It wasn’t until the year after that he’d rediscovered it, around the time that he’d accepted the agony that was love for Harry Potter. Harry’s scent still clung to it, grass and broomstick polish wafting over him, so he’d cast a spell to preserve the smell and snuck it under his pillow. It was the only thing that helped him sleep at night for a long time, until it became far too dangerous to own something of Potter’s.
Shake. Harry had eaten a treacle tart in front of him, but that’s not what Black’s asking.
Harry points his wand at the glass and pulls. Nothing happens.
Theodore eyes him carefully, book open in front of him on Hagrid’s table. A single rock cake sits abandoned to the side, surrounded by multiple cold cups of tea and coffee.
Yeesh.. Ok, this chapter and the next were supposed to be one, but it went on for quite a long time, so I'm publishing this half now as an individual chapter and the next half later (when i actually finish writing it). Lots of Harry content, lots of Malfoy Manor content, and a whole lotta angst. Woop!
Finch-Fletchley, Justin
Harry blows onto the steaming liquid, letting the silence settle a little. It sounds nice. He’s always hated being in the spotlight, being relied upon. At first, he missed the purpose and direction of fighting against Voldemort. He didn’t want to fade away quietly, with no real aim. Now he thinks he was wrong. It wasn’t the action he was missing; it was having something to work towards.
“Just go up to them. They got some magic on it to recognise you. Dark magic, probably, you know what the Malfoys are like. Keep your wand close. She may be an old hag, but her sister was that mad one.”
Eyes wandering, she notices a lump in the closed curtains, which is moving. Ah. Cursing Blaise for telling her to stop anyone, she stands gracefully and glides over. If she has to behave like a chaperone, she may as well do it in style. With one flick, she pulls back the curtain, raising her eyebrow at the mass of ginger and blonde hair.
“I promise it won’t happen again, Malfoy. I know… I know what you did after the battle. Remus - I mean, Remus Lupin -gave me the letter last night. Will you please let me in?”
“Draco…” Harry sits on the bed, and this is it, isn’t it, this is the point where Harry says he doesn’t love him at all, and never has, and he only kissed him because he didn’t want to embarrass him, and-
“What do you do in there, really?” Parkinson stalks closer, arms folded. “I know you’re not actually teaching him, because he’s under Imperius. Do you make him do your nails? Do your potions homework? Or something a little more…” Her gaze trails down to between Hermione’s legs, and she can’t help flushing and stepping back.
Pansy scowls. “No! We’re in the middle of something, so Nott can shove his apology up his-”
Lupin walks in a couple of minutes later, looking slightly exasperated as her house elves parade over a tray with tea made just how she likes it. They slide it onto the coffee table, then pop away again.
Comments are greatly appreciated, I love reading through them and getting ideas for what to write next. Thank you!
“Pansy!” Hermione slaps a hand over Pansy’s mouth. “Sorry, Luna. Draco can make his own decisions.”
“Come on in.” He steps to one side, eying the aurors as they watch her ascend. Like she’s going to suddenly turn around and kill them all. Ridiculous.
She turns, preparing herself with a deep breath. Mr Lupin stands at the top of the stairs, door open into the house. Her house, by right, if that Sirius Black hadn’t handed it on to Harry. She can’t be bitter about it, she should be glad the boy has a place to go.
Do you have any pets? If so, what are their names?
Harry flinches, swinging his head to look at his friend. “Doing what?”
“It’s ok, Luna, you don’t need to know.” The redhead reassures her, kissing her lightly on the head and trying to contain any further laughter.
Potter makes a little fist and punches it in excitement. “Thanks!” He almost seems a little too happy, Draco thinks, too full of energy and too annoying even for Potter.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Grumbling, the group depart, leaving Draco, Black, his mother, Remus, and Harry alone.
Harry isn’t angry. He really isn’t. At least, that’s what he’s telling himself under the screaming impulse to go knock someone’s teeth out. It’s the one year where he doesn’t have to worry about trying to survive, and now some stupid Slytherins are ruining it. As usual.
“They’ll have to do more research… but we can hope, Harry. Sirius might come back to us.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
At least he is living. And someday, he thinks he might breathe freely again.
Which is your least favourite ship in the Harry Potter fandom?
Question time!!!
He can hear the apprehension in her words, the same feeling racing through him when he steps out. Hogwarts. The renovations, paid for by money taken from families like his and Theodore’s, have finally finished. The uneasiness leaks away. He’d been dreading the castle would be just like the Manor - reeking of death and dark magic - yet the new stone, while identical to the old, smelt fresh and full of new hope.
Harry stares down at the battered boy, sleeping peacefully, and feels his heart twisting painfully. The Gryffindors had thought Harry would be on their side. What if they’d done this to Malfoy in revenge for what had happened to Harry? Yet again, he’s the reason that the ferret is hurt.
It's not actually the end! Just felt like an appropriate title.
“The spell! Quickly!” Theo shouts, catching Blaise’s attention.
This took a long time to write... but here it is! Chapter nine. Harry's perspective, again. Last chapter was very fluffy, and I had planned for this one to go back into angst, but I haven't managed to get to that point yet. Next chapter, I promise.
“Zabini.” His father sticks his nose up, a familiar cold mask slipping on, and Draco could almost cry at the sight of it. “I hope you hired a decent painter to paint me. I would hate it if I looked imperfect.”
Their breaths fill the space, stretching like a rubber band about to snap. Harry’s eyes rove over the other boy’s face, heart quickening as the next few moments whizz through his mind prematurely. Malfoy will apologise. Then Harry will say it’s fine, will apologise too, and in that moment everything will be fixed. Or Malfoy will apologise and then Harry will kiss him, and Malfoy will suddenly realise he still loves Harry and he will kiss him back. Or Malfoy will apologise, and confess everything, and Harry will remember some magic to fix Malfoy’s head, and Malfoy will be so grateful that he’ll propose.
The war had been hard, yes, but at least then his path was clear. Do what you were told, and if you don’t, you die. Besides, it’s all for a good Slytherin cause. He may not like it, and he may let some people slip past, but for the most part he settled himself into his role well and impressed his father. Once the war was over, he could let it all go, marry a nice pureblood, and gather his rewards for his dedicated work. That was it.
Enjoy!
This chapter's recommendation is... VeteranKlaus! If you love reading about Klaus from the Umbrella Academy, VeteranKlaus has written a lot of fanfictions on this. Some are incomplete, but there are a lot of interesting ideas and possibilities explored very well. They have a good style of writing too, so for picky readers like me, you won't be disappointed.
Then he leans forward, kisses Draco on the forehead, and is gone.
“So what, then?”
“Perhaps you could.” Lucius murmurs, breaking his code of clearly audible words. “You’ve always managed to go beyond what’s expected. Perhaps you could fly so high you could hold the moon in your hand, and your mother would see you safe and I could show the world what you can do. Look at my son, up there in the clouds, with the moon in his hand and the stars in his hair.”
Blaise reaches inside himself, feeling for that tingling well of magic.
Draco smiles, moving to settle down by the railings on the softest carpet he could see. ‘I love it. It’s amazing, Harry, thank you.’
The Unspeakables surround them, ready to record and monitor the ‘extraction’, as they called it. Blaise can’t help but feel like a lab rat, sacrificed for some greater good that he has no choice to die for.
Parkinson snorts. “Yeah, right. I know what Potter’s been doing. I know he wants Draco all to himself, cause he’s a spoiled brat! Don’t try to argue with me, Granger, I’ve figured it all out. He’s in love with Draco, so like the possessive prick he is, he’s separated him slowly from his friends so we won’t get suspicious, then locked him away and cast Imperius. Why else would Draco invite him in and not me?!”
“Narcissa, I can talk to the ministry for you.” He blurts out, spinning on his heel right in the doorway. “I can try to get you out of here. Grimmauld Place belongs to me now, and I’m sure Remus would like some help renovating it, since you would know all about the heirlooms, and it might be good for you. You can bring all of your house elves. There has to be enough space.”
“No, no, I think we’d actually like your help.” Harry slides his chair closer to the fireplace. “You know Vizzini?”
- E.D.
Hm. He supposes he might need that. The ringing in his ears really isn’t pleasant, and maybe Poppy will give him more of that potion that helps him sleep.
Thanks, Sev, you always make me feel so much better.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“Learned habits, I suppose.” She shrugs. “And I’m not going to start making my friends freak out by saying his name. He may be dead, but his sickness still carries on tormenting a lot of people.”
He lifts and drops his shoulders in a shrug as Blaise closes the door behind them, seating himself opposite. It wasn’t that he didn’t want them there - indeed, he was glad he would have someone to stick up for him - but he wasn’t ready for these questions. He just wasn’t ready. Why could nobody see that?
Just as Pansy’s about to hex Potter into oblivion for such a stupid observation, Draco stands. All of the Gryffindors' wands snap to him. He stops, still half crouched, and curses himself. They see him as a threat. He's not the frail child that his mother sees, nor pathetic Malfoy pincushion that the Death Eaters saw. Here, surrounded by Dumbledore's Mistakes, he's an enemy.
‘Crucio’. The force of his thoughts explode into black ink letters over his head, spitting sparks that light up the room in bright flashes, illuminating the word for all to see.
Fear? Hermione is right - he really does need to see one of those mind healers. The words 'Malfoy' and 'fear' do not go together in any way, shape, or form. Well, perhaps as in someone being afraid of him. Never the other way round. It doesn't fit.
I myself am a proud Ravenclaw. Never really changed my mind about it like other people sometimes do. I wonder what happens if a person's personality changes during their hogwarts year - they can't move house, but then they're stuck in a house that they don't feel they belong to anymore. Yes, magic is magic, but... oh well.
“Harry!”
Pansy takes the lead instead. “I think I understand what he’s trying to say. It’s not that house elves are happy being slaves, it’s that they know freedom isn’t fun for them. They could be reduced to what they were before. The one that left the Malfoys was lucky, since he knew Potter. Dumbledore would obviously take in anything Precious Potter liked.” She snorts, a bitter tone coming through.
“Ron!” Another pillow narrowly misses Ron’s head, this time from Ginny. “I can’t believe you! Don’t be such a dick.”
“Hello Miss Luna! I be Master Draco’s firstest ever moving picture!” Jaebo beams.
Time passes by, filled with laughter and excitement at the comforting familiarity of it all. Soon the plates vanish, signalling Ginny and Luna to stand.
Hermione’s head jerks up, mouth gaping in shock. “What?”
“Shut up! Don’t dare do this again!” He snaps, pointing his wand at them.
Harry sips at the tea, then sets it down gently. “I killed Draco.” He whispers before he can stop himself, all of the horror and guilt creeping up again.
‘Wouldn’t want Blaise to see you all dirty, would we?’ Draco spells out, smirking as Pansy’s face flushes.
Nice. Not perfect, not in the slightest, but not the worst thing ever. A middle ground. Balancing on a knife blade, not sure whether your next movement will tip you over the side.
- E.D.
Draco watches him, the seeds of dread bursting open under this new shower of words.
“What if I told you we found a way to get people out of Limbo?”
“Draco!” Harry cups his face with his hands, looking him straight in the eye. “It’s ok, I understand. I know what you’re trying to say. I love you too. You don’t have to be able to say it.”
‘I mean, my wand. Mine. The one Potter stole.’
“Yeah. So, I’m going to go without magic for a while, see how I go, let my magic recharge, like Hermione says. Think about things more.” He glances at Draco, green eyes sincere. “About you more. I don’t want to keep hurting you.”
Merlin, Harry hisses in his head. He’d been so fucking selfish.
“He won’t talk to me.” Pansy sighs in frustration. “Tell me, or I’ll tell him what you said.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh.” Lupin stares intently at his tea, silence washing over them again.
There’s a startled pause. Then strong arms envelop him, press their bodies closer, and he’s kissing him back - he’s kissing him back! - and Draco doesn’t even process the shocked noises around them because his heart is on fire and he’s alive alive alive alive alive alive!
Morgana’s silky hair. Well, if they’re already together, it’ll make no difference if she told her now. “Harry… Harry’s been talking to me since he found out he was gay…”
“Look, what’s done is done.” Pansy throws her hands up, rolling her eyes. “Frankly, I think we should be focusing more on the fact that they’re alive. They’re alive! I don’t give a shit about whether or not the ministry hates us - that part should be obvious, considering the fact we’ve brought an ex-Death Eater back to life. They can’t lock Black away for something he didn’t do. We have proof he didn’t do it. So maybe you lot should be helping with the presents instead of moping about!”
“Don’t mumble.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Looney? She did know about Blaise’s phoenix craze, which is actually very hard to guess. She knew about Draco’s silence before any of them, showing that it wasn’t just him refusing to speak. She knew about Potter’s disgusting attack on Draco. She knows exactly who Pansy is looking for every time she runs past her, and exactly where that person is.
“My great aunt, Cassiopeia, was able to do that too.” Black calls from behind the swarm of people. “Maybe I can give you hints from when I saw her do it. It’s a shame she died six years ago.”
How should Harry be punished for what he did to Draco? Or should he even be punished at all?
“It’s not like sixth year! I don’t even know what you mean.” He grumbles, absorbing himself in a chicken wing.
Enjoy!
Luna: :(
“I know… I know what you did after the battle. Remus - I mean, Remus Lupin -gave me the letter last night. Will you please let me in?”
So, no, he’s not ready in the slightest, even when he’s standing with his trunk by the door, ready to apparate to King’s Cross. The clothes he wore before don’t fit his skeleton frame, and he refused to go to Diagon Alley with all the people, so his mother let him use a muggle computer to order new outfits, while she ordered his robes. He wore one of his new outfits now, black sweater over black skin-tight jeans over black trainers. Without his father around, he no longer had to wear tailored suits, so he took a rather savage delight in wearing clothes from people his father despised. The lack of attention it brought to him was a benefit too.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(in order)
“Mhm.” Draco holds his hand out, which Harry takes.
As always, comments are much appreciated!
Luna: :)
Furious, he turns towards the Slytherins, certain that they had purposefully arranged this so they can murder him while he sleeps. Stormy grey eyes catch his for a second, before flicking away in fear.
Draco shakes his head vehemently, stomach lurching at the thought of having to see Mr Ollivander. The man had been kind during his stay in Malfoy Manor, but no one is kind enough to not hold a bitter grudge about that.
Christmas comes and goes, presents overflowing from their two beds, and soon Poppy declares them suitably fit to leave. Sirius is practically howling at the walls by this point, setting pranks and pacing the ward like there’s no tomorrow. Draco is less eager, especially when this means the press is certain to get news of his reincarnation. Piles of howlers, here he comes!
