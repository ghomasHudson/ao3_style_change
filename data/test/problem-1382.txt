“That moment in death when your life flashes before your eyes? That’s when you come here.” The voice of Draco’s subconscious echoed in a strange form of memory.
“You bloody Gryffindors, with your heroics... you’ve got enough morale to win a war. And we know it.” He paused once more.
He grinned, that same twinkle dancing in his eye like it had that morning when they’d arrived to detention, disheveled and panting with excitement and lack of sleep.
“That was weird.”
“One, two, three, Marauders.” Remus chanted, and their hands dipped before raising up into the air.
Puzzled, Harry began to feel his own robes only to notice the absence of his own holly and Phoenix feather.
“Please. Come to the Burrow with me. I want you there.”
He shouldn’t have gotten into a fight with Draco Malfoy, to say the least.
“I guess I just thought- I thought there’d be more commotion.” Draco admitted as they rounded a corner, gaining proximity on the Room.
“Meddle with time, Harry, I know.” He rolled his eyes at Draco’s eerie likeness to Hermione in the present moment. He was grounding him, like she had tried to do so many times before. But with Draco, it was different. For some reason he couldn’t quite understand.
“I would, Malfoy. You’re not that bad, you know.”
The focus shifted to the couple before them. Lily’s genuine, closed-lip smile gave James to courage to wrap an arm around her shoulders.
He’d have given anything to be with his own father, so the scenario before him hit him in a sort of sensitive spot. Anger flared throughout his being.
It tickled, and the memory brought a wide smile to his face. This. This was it. The missing link, the emptiness. It was all life without Draco.
“You are coming along fine, young Draco.”
“McGonnagal’s. We’ve got that test on animagi this week, remember?”
“My cousin.” Draco’s voice was even-tempered, almost observant.
Pansy flipped her hair. “Whatever you’ve got in mind, I’m game.”
He paused, silver eyes burning like fire. Harry silently wondered if those cheeks were hot to the touch, if that pale skin would flicker against his own.
The second his back hit the hard surface of the floor, James Potter was found sprinting toward the area where Draco and Harry stood silently, Mouths agape and unable to process the battle unfolding before them.
“It’ll be fun, Draco. Please.”
All around them, puffs of coal colored smoke signaled the arrival of something truly dark. Behind the ebony clouds appeared identical creatures that neither Harry or Draco had ever seen before. They rose robotically into a standing position, which seemed utterly impossible on their insect-like appendages. They had a hard exoskeleton, and antennae that protruded bluntly from the forehead. What caused Harry to gasp in fear, however, were the eyes. They were an alarming crimson, and it was as if they could see into your soul with a passing glance. Like their very presence was burned into your subconscious.
Draco felt a part of him stir, a raveled mess of hormones and desire and fucking passion from down under. He’d never felt this, never fucking dreamed he could experience this. What a twisted fucking sense of humor someone had, for Harry Potter to pull this from him.
For the first time, Harry witnessed the carefully placed stoicism of Lucius Malfoy flicker before it faltered.
The freedom of the breeze had done nothing to quell Draco’s failed attempts that night.
Everything went fuzzy, like static.  It was probably because his body couldn’t take it any more, not when it’s own psyche had betrayed it.
Sirius stepped forward, and in the dim light it was evident that he bore bruises beneath each eye.
None of this would have happened in the absence of Lord Voldemort. And now? It was time for revenge. For his parents. For Sirius Black. For Remus Lupin. For himself. And now, perhaps one of the most important factors was... for Draco.
As he grew closer, it became evident that the darkened figure was not only a silhouette but a man with long, black robes adorning his physique. He was pale, Harry could make out that much. He wasn’t in proximity enough to make out his face, it was a blur among white orbs...
“Do you wanna maybe... go to the astronomy tower instead?”
“No! I demand you to tell me what you are doing out here before I give you all detention!”
“Please, Draco. Don’t give up. Wait for me. I’ll protect you. We’ll fight this together. You deserve to be free. Just please... don’t give up.”
“She and her family are blood traitors,” Nott chimed disgustedly.
Harry watched himself, frustrated, follow the Slytherins to their next class. Potions.
“The Weasley’s. It’s never empty. Quite the opposite actually.”
“I wasn’t finished.”
Draco’s heart skipped a sunken beat, trying to absorb every moment through the yellow haze that was currently his world. What in the actual fuck had he just heard?
“It’s- it’s ok, really.” He stuttered, floored by his response. “Don’t be sorry for Ginny and me. We never would’ve worked out.”
“It was everything.”
He always seemed apathetic to authority, as if his last name was enough to place him above the rules. Not in this moment, though. The gentle expression on his face revealed his own humility and desire to please the Headmaster much like Harry did.
He wished he could’ve gone back. He wished he could’ve begged the sorting hat for Gryffindor. He wished he could’ve spent the past seven years with Potter.
Severus and Bellatrix were immobile.
When they did separate, panting and worked up from a knotted mess of passion and adrenaline, Draco didn’t mind that it was Harry across from him.
Remus chuckled, turning his head upward once more. He began to run his fingers through locks of black hair, savoring the silky feeling against the skin of his hands. It was smooth, and comforting, just like Sirius’s good intentions.
He nodded once.
Neither of them found words to speak as the memory came to a close.
“I know it’s you.” Harry whispered suddenly as he felt that breath come even closer, hot and heavy against his lips.
“Professor! I need your help!” He cried desperately, clinging to the hope that his wish had been granted. But Dumbledore didn’t flinch, eyes following the parchment before him religiously.
“Damnit, James,” he muttered under his breath, and Remus chuckled.
“Incarcerous!”
And one last time.
He’s going to get them out of here. Destroy the diadem. And- Goddamnit- Draco is going to get another chance.
Harry nodded, familiar with the inner workings of the silvery substance floating along the edges of the stone.
Draco and Harry peered over to see Sirius Black giving the most pathetic of smiles with his characteristic puppy dog eyes and a shrug.
Harry, who’d already been staring in that general direction (because he hated him being here, that was all) froze with some sort of embarrassment. He expected Malfoy to sneer, or make some rude arse comment to the already pissed Gryffindor, but instead the only shade of emotion he illicited was a hot pink blush that spread across both cheeks. Harry started. He’d never seen Malfoy look so, so... fragile. It was beautiful. Captivating. What?
“Yes, my Lord.”
“I know. Plum pudding is disgusting.”
James and Sirius went back and forth like they always did, laughing and jabbing and going on like brothers.
“I think about you all the time.” Was the response, and Harry felt his stomach lurch. “Ever since you gave me my wand back. And then Pansy and Blaise are all about your friends, and suddenly you didn’t seem so bad anymore. And then I realized that...that...”
He’d thought Draco had needed saving, but maybe it was himself who had needed redemption all along.
He felt like a zombie, stuck somewhere between two completely different realities.
“I promise that you’ll never find another like Me!”
“You did what you had to do to save yourself from your father. And I don’t blame you for that for one second.” Harry’s eyes were genuine and full of a vivid green honesty that he could not refute.
Harry’s heart was pounding at this prospect, but before he could do anything further, Malfoy spoke.
Draco doesn’t have to visit Malfoy Manor to know which ghosts roam its halls, apparitions of tortured souls and the results of his own mistakes. If only he’d stood up to his father. If only he’d run. If only...
“Are you having fun, Rem?” He asked as they settled into a few chairs that were aimed to look at the stars.
A wicked leer crossed his face; it was clear that he was enjoying this.
Severus Snape regaining consciousness is what brought them back to harsh reality.
This was his Malfoy, and he loved him, and he would never allow anything to change that.
The memory morphed into a considerably brighter scene. It was the Great Hall, adorned with decorations and the swift movement of dancing bodies.
“Who is it, Head master? Is it the Death Eaters?” Draco questioned confidently, a sick feeling in his gut confirming his suspicion.
“Are you staying here the rest of the summer?”
It was an endless stretch of time that Draco remained motionless, and the scoff of Lucius Malfoy from behind him was enough to boil his blood.
Dumbledore waved them inside as they approached the top step.
“Sirius, I-“
Malfoy kept silent for the duration of the memory, watching intently as Lupin rested. His eyes never wandered from the group before them, and Harry wondered just what Malfoy was seeing. Feeling. Thinking.
“You didn’t?”
He still couldn’t see the boy’s face, but the slump of his shoulders gave away his disappointment and blatant disheartenment. Harry wanted to stomp up to the man, to ask him what the hell was so important that he couldn’t pay attention to his son.
“Yeah, I did too.” They crept forward, almost there, and anticipation slowly began to prickle the crown of Harry’s Head. What would they find when they entered? The Headmaster? The culprit? Voldemort himself?
The edges of the dormitory began to darken, leading them to a place that lacked the warmth of hugs and lit lanterns.
Sometimes grudges weren’t bad if the other party deserved them. It would be a long time before he’d trust Peter again, that much was evident.
Sparks immediately prickled from the crown of Draco’s head to the tips of his toes in a sensation that sent his head reeling. Harry’s lips were chapped but persistent and fell to match his own perfectly. His mouth was warm and seemed to melt every last trace of fear remaining in his being. He felt whole, and safe, and... home...
“No, we’re sticking with ferret. Don’t think I’ve forgotten about that.”
No one deserved this. Pure blooded, half-blooded, or muggle born. This was gruesome, and terrifying, and everything Draco had never seen but was somehow now grateful for being exposed to.
“It’s what we did, Rem. We didn’t want you to have to be alone during the full moon, anymore. And now, you don’t have to.” He moved to stand near Peter and James, who also appeared hopeful.
His cheeks blushed from pink to full on crimson, but Harry didn’t notice. He was too busy worrying about his own embarrassment. Losing his breath was one thing, but becoming completely entranced by an act that was meant to be sexual- that was inherently intimate- and that caused another sensation entirely to flood throughout his being...
Harry was already in a piss poor mood. He and Ginny had called it quits, but for very different reasons. They just didn’t work, that was all. They were better off as best friends. There was just no...chemistry.
Draco froze as a familiar Malfoy eagle owl dropped an envelope on his lap.
Darkness was illuminated by a hodge podge of blurry shapes and lines as Harry’s eyelids slowly separated. There were noises, but they were as difficult to identify as the array of blended colors before him. Muffled chaos filled his ears; it was clear that something violent was occurring around him. Even if he couldn’t quite make out what it was.
Before he had a chance to turn around, or dart his eyes in another direction, a set of shorts was thrown to the ground. Draco, whose own eyes were glued ahead, allowed his mouth to settle into a soft “o” as the blood rushed visibly to his cheeks.
Harry paused, flabbergasted. His eyes darted to Malfoy, who seemed humble and in thought. Suddenly, silver eyes that were as soft as a storm cloud were meeting his own.
“He made a mistake, Sirius.”
Harry glanced at the thousands upon thousands of orbs resonating on all sides of them.
But if it didn’t strike the heart of the wolf, ending its veracity with the darkest of magic, then... what would it?
“Draco?”
When the memory faded completely, both boys were smiling.
“Rem?”
Until images of Draco Malfoy, and a bright green light hitting him, of his body falling into darkness and landing in a bank... of memories... he was isolated, alone. Lying on the ground. Passed out. He had to be near here. There was a shelf in the background, like the others, but... something in Harry instinctively pulled him forward. To the next row, and the next.
It was hard to make out, the syllables rushed together and slurred, but...
Draco was in the library. The restricted section, to be exact. How he’d managed to sneak into the area without possession of an invisibility cloak was almost beyond Harry. If it weren’t for the view of his wand as he cast an extremely advanced disillusionment charm upon himself, he wouldn’t have seen him at all. Luckily, his wavy silhouette was still visible. To Harry, at least.
“Well? The peppermint oil?”
Harry leans forward, invading Malfoy’s space. It’s a gesture that doesn’t go unnoticed, and Malfoy’s hands shake a bit.
He hated Potter that year. Hated him because in being the Chosen One, he had help. He had an entire Order of people protecting him. He never had to be alone.
“Sev, put your wand down! I promise I’ll explain later!” Lily pleaded, and for a moment, he hesitated, until his gaze softened at her request.
He turned suddenly to one of the farther shelves on his right and took off in its direction. Malfoy was momentarily incapacitated by what appeared to be his own confusion before he followed.
“Thanks, Wormtail, you’re the best!” Sirius all but threw the empty bottle in his direction. As Peter shuffled away, Sirius shifted back to James as Remus worked on the map.
The lights dimmed as a signal to the start of the ceremony, and Kingsley Shacklebolt made his way to the podium.
“Isn’t it obvious, Draco?” She wiped tears from her eyes as the laughter settled. “He doesn’t know that you’re gay.” She lowered her voice. “So how do people react when they feel threatened? They start swinging.” She chuckled softly, but Draco remained confused.
Draco’s gaze didn’t falter; he didn’t so much as blink before responding:  “anything, my Lord.”
But, what happened next was almost worse. No one moved a muscle. They remained the target of a room full of Death Eaters, Wands pointed diligently and without hesitation.
“Narcissa. Draco.” He stated formally, greeting them as if they were nothing more than acquaintances.
Draco was told by the Healer to keep Harry comfortable for as long as possible. And, though Harry griped and groaned about it, that’s exactly what he did.
“Yes, Professor,” Draco answered humbly. “I was going to ask... Harry and I didn’t finish viewing the memories... let alone sorting them. Should we meet back in your office tomorrow?”
“Dead?” Harry asks stupidly, and then the memories come rushing forward. The battle. Voldemort. The forest. “But- how did you get here?”
“I miss Remus,” Sirius complained, waving his wand above his head mindlessly.
The floor level was covered in rounded tables, each of which had fine yellow placards with the names of each assigned seat written in the fanciest of scripts. White table cloths trailed the floor, dancing atop the shoes of each guest.
This only fueled Harry’s already tightened grip, and suddenly his hands were sliding down his shoulders and arms. They glided smoothly against the surface of his body, memorizing every dip and curve of a Malfoy as they found refuge in the small of his back.
“One of the goals of your detention was to show you both that differences and similarities walk a fine line. I was hoping that through the memories you would learn more about each other, as well as those depicted. Would you say you’ve accomplished this?”
Draco was an empty seed. A dud. A dead end. Dry and unyielding. A... a failure.
Potter’s lips twitched into a smile, but Malfoy was rapidly distracted by a movement in his peripheral vision.
As Filch turned the corner, they ran back toward the common room. He was far enough way to see their tales rounding another corridor, and he called that they’d all better stop or they’d be facing detention.
“Half the man my father was?” Draco asked, a playful smirk pulling at his lips.
Harry expected the walls to shift, one memory blurring into the next, but the word remained still for another moment.
“Perfect. Because I’ve got the greatest plan.” His grin was both menacing and oddly charming as they came close into a huddle.
“Well, Draco and I were in detention, and Dumbledore came and got us...”
“It warms my heart to see enemies becoming friends, and so much more. There is no magic as strong as love, you know.” He tilted his head knowingly.
Draco watched as the space between Harry’s eyebrows softened. He then tilted his head, eyes searching every piece of Draco’s face, and raised his hands to cup his cheeks.
Harry noticed the subtle grasp of each finger digging into his forearm, and for some reason it didn’t bother him. Instead, it seemed to ground him to the reality of detention as the setting changed completely.
Draco winked, subtly, but he knew that Harry had seen it.
He didn’t have much time to ponder this; in the blink of an eye the memory around him had morphed into something much darker.
“Draco!” He called as Hermione lowered the volume with a flick of her wand. “This is nothing but Taylor Swift!”
“Are you nervous?” Harry asked, placing his hands on either side of Draco’s waist.
Pansy and Blaise were grounded, sure, resulting in a lonely Draco Malfoy not receiving owls from any of his friends.
Draco swallows, once, then twice, before straightening his stare ahead. Harry’s coming over soon, and this time Teddy is at the Burrow. They’ve never hung out like this, quite alone and unsupervised by Teddy’s string of home-made knock knock jokes. He’s not sure why, but he’s nervous.
“Come on, Moony, join me!” He gestured to the side car.
“In a sense, Yes. But everyone has their own version of me in their subconscious. Each individual has varying degrees of trauma and repressed thoughts and memories. I exist because of those horrible experiences. Think of me as the devil on your shoulder.”
Harry was dumbfounded, thoughts racing emphatically as he realized that 14 year old Draco Malfoy was struggling with his sexuality just as much as he had been.
“Because spending Christmas with your arch nemesis has got to be better than spending it alone.”
“I can’t promise that he’ll want to speak with you.” There was considerably less contempt coming from the Marauder.
It was a beautiful day outside. The skies were a crisp blue that reflected off of the Black Lake; the trees held a sort of green vibrance to them that seemed to happen before autumn took hold. Students were scattered about the castle grounds playing exploding snap and enjoying the sunshine. Beneath their typical oak tree hangout spot were the Marauders with their newest member Lily Evans perched relaxedly against James.
When they stepped onto the seventh floor, things were eerily silent. Harry wasn’t sure what he was expecting:  maybe some dueling, or the cries of an injured Death Eater. But all that was heard was the quiet plank of their footsteps.
He slept through the entire examination until the door to the wing flew open. Behind it stood the rest of the Marauders, all looking hopeful and eager to see their best friend.
“Well, we’ve taken a vote,” Remus piped from a few beds down. “And, majority rules.” He sent a sideways glare at Sirius, who crossed his arms from the spot next to him. “We’re going to start talking to you again. In fact, I’ve forgiven you.”
Sirius promised Remus they’d stop at Honeyduke’s for more chocolate before the day was over, and that’s exactly where the four of them were headed.
“That we always wanted each other.”
It held, but not for long, and the shield was visibly shaking as Draco shot curses from around it. He hit one, no, two, Death Eaters and Harry silently beamed at what a grand team they made. If only they’d been able to see it sooner, how different would things have been...
It was the fucking snake. Nagini, the one who’d lived with them for months at Malfoy Manor. The one who the Dark Lord had fed numerous times in front of his followers, Draco chewing his cheek with silent opposition.
“I am the deepest form of Draco’s subconscious.”
“I never said I hated him.” Malfoy was strangely defensive, and Harry eyed him suspiciously before continuing through the shack.
“There’s something about you when you study. It’s captivating.” Brown irises were enough to see straight through Remus’s soul. A blush crept up both cheeks.
“You are.”
And there was Harry, standing, quickly becoming as much of a soppy mess as he was.
“Maybe we should still put some up. You know, just in case.”
Harry’s mouth dropped. Of course, he should have known that the memories couldn’t have belonged to anyone else. But the news that those memories... belonged specially to Sirius... it awakened a new part of Harry.
Draco Malfoy walks the cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley, and it’s different now. The way it had bustled with a vibrant vivacity in his younger years is long gone now, replaced by the mediocrities that come with running errands and making stops for work. It had been repaired, for the most part, after the war, but something about the shadows of buildings that used to be constructed just a little bit different haunts Malfoy in his steps.
“That- That was...” Draco breathed in a heady tone that was positively intoxicating.
“Obvious, isn’t it? You’re going back.”
Draco’s raspy “Expulso” was weak and blocked easily by the nearest enemy. The pain that radiated down his spine was almost unbearable, but he refused to give in. Not when he was so inevitably close to standing his ground.
“You saved my life, Draco. If it weren’t for you lieing at the manor, I would’nt be here.”
“I- I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Peter fidgeted, obviously nervous and twitching with sudden fear. He glanced from side to side, eyes falling on the vacancy around them. There was no escaping this- no smart comment from James to distract the Slytherin, no wise remarks from Remus to humble him. Here, he was alone, and he’d have to make a choice- if he was unable to fake his way out of this...
Harry. He thinks of that kiss, the one that forever erased the line between good and evil. How ironically it was the most alive he’d ever felt. And how if heaven was real, and if Draco Malfoy was lucky enough to end up there, he’d spend an eternity reveling in that one moment.
“Listen, Evans.” Lucius stepped forward, snooty and done with their latest annoyance.
Draco’s cry was loud and unforgiving against a world of Death Eaters vs. the rest of them.
“I... I don’t know... I mean, I can’t be... you know my father would...”
Harry shared a smile with Ron, whose understanding nod was enough to make him burst with relief. His friends were here, and they were safe. They’d defeated the Death Eaters, for now. Draco had won them a solid victory. The Slytherins had arrived in the nick of time. Everything seemed to happen with purpose, pieces falling fatefully into place.
“Oh my god, Moony, did you just agree!? Did we just-“ his features were ecstatic as he pulled him up the rest of the way and pressed their lips together again.
“Relax, Malfoy.” They entered the shack, and Harry began leading him to the familiarity of the trap door that would lead back to Hogwarts. “Professor Lupin? The guy you hate?”
“Don’t say anything to upset him, Draco. He’s had a hard few months.”
The others began levitating the prisoners and dragging their squirming figures from the room.
Again, Harry laughed. “They can’t hear us either, Malfoy.”
“Meet me in the shrieking shack after class?”
But Draco, in less than a moment, had vanished. And Harry stood, arms outstretched into thin air, wondering what the fuck had just happened as everything came back into focus.
“The beast.”
Harry’s eyes trailed the surrounding beings, but something was off. They stood motionless, as if they weren’t allowed by some invisible command to move. Black smoke began to cloud the area, arriving from nowhere and similarly leaving. Draco coughed as it filled their immediate surroundings, blinding their vision momentarily.
“Hey, Potter,” Draco drawled as soon as their presence was the only one remaining. “I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight. Fancy a trip to the astronomy tower?” His eyes were playful, lips teetering a sneer.
It was everything he’d fallen in love with along the way.
His attention was diverted to a trembling but firm voice from behind.
“Don’t call him that. He is nothing more than a monster to me. He is no better than Lupin.” His voice dripped with hate, poison that could infect with just one drop. But Draco saw past it.
“Because I love you, Moony.”
Again, he heard it. “Reinervate.”
And there he lay, at a complete standstill. His vision was blurry, the colors of the world around them a giant mixing pot. Noises ran incomprehensible as the pain continued to accelerate. He was sure he was dying- he had to be dying.
“Why do I have a feeling this is going to be crazy?” Peter piped nervously.
“I know you won’t. But you might not have a choice. Do you think for one second that you- or Dumbledore- would be able to stop the Malfoy family from throwing me to execution?”
That worried crease, the lack of contempt and focus on something much bigger and more disturbing... it was permanently chiseled into his features. This was the face of Draco who refused to hit him back in the corridor before they were assigned detention.
“Have you forgotten? I suppose the idea may have slipped through your consciousness and landed around here somewhere.” His smile remained plastered against his serpentlike features. Harry stood his ground, perhaps stupidly, refusing to stand down.
A dozen cars must’ve passed by at this point, and Draco pondered how every one of them was probably wondering what kind of idiot would sit outside during a thunderstorm. He sighed at his own relentless ability to put himself down before gazing up at the sky. He was alone, but hardly lonely. Every rain drop was here to keep him company.
“See? I’d like to watch you try. You always were weak.”
He cocked his head, a frustrated expression creeping along the hard lines of his mouth.
Detention with Dumbledore was most humbling. Disappointing the old Headmaster had its own way of tearing him up from the inside out, and this brought his guilt to a whole new level.
A warm smile crept along Black’s lips as he settled Remus, covering him with the ragged quilt.
He quickly followed the gang around the corner and tried to catch up so he could hear their conversation.
“Pansy,” Harry introduced, contemplating the events with a thousand questions in mind.
Harry couldn’t see his face, but in the boy’s hand was a bowl. An ordinary vessel, it seemed, except that within it was a conglomeration of leaves and twigs and other things that a child would play with.
Regulus Black froze mid-step as the others continued to pace forward. His face was contorted into the most disgusted expression, a tactless gesture that demonstrated his inability or ill desire to hold back his opinion.
“Your brother? Thats right. You can fucking have him. I want nothing to do with that faggot.”
He quickly tried to piece together what had happened, to formulate the memory they’d been jerked out of.
“Trust me, Pete, it’s probably best that you don’t have reason to be called something.” He said softly, but Sirius followed with a cackle.
Pansy giggled. “You are relentless, my dear friend!”
It was quiet for a while, both lost in their own interpretations of what had happened that day.
“Hello, son.”
“It’s your Godfather, isn’t it,” Draco gently pried, examining the waters while trying to make himself feel whole again. He’d been privy to the events at the Department of Mysteries last term; it was his father after all who had led the ambush.
The look of hurt that flashed across Malfoy’s face was unmistakeable. His features quickly resolved into something more formal, and Harry felt his stomach drop.
And then, the world stopped. It was as if he was frozen in place, each tentacle of moroseness loosening it’s hold on him. Slowly, he was released. The knot in his stomach unraveled. He felt empty, but whole.
Harry lifted his head, finally in control of his muscles. A sudden wind seemed to whip out of nowhere. He could see Draco shielding his eyes as the memory orbs around them shook and threatened to break. He focused on the older Malfoy’s form, who rested his shoulders in an amused fashion. He bore a wicked grin on his face.
Draco had shrugged. “Sure.”
And then, they were in another place entirely.
“Please, Potter. You know Slytherin will win the cup this year.”
Perhaps it was luck, or the hold of a new memory’s bloom, but this moment was all that they needed to last forever. Just two boys in love, like others before them, growing into exactly who they were meant to be.
“Peter.” The voice belonged to a taller male with waist-length platinum hair.
Hours pass, though the clock reads otherwise. And Draco tells him that he needs to go back to bed. That they’ve both got work in the morning, and Teddy is visiting Andromeda...
“Draco? Don’t forget that you have French lessons in an hour. If you need anything before then, call the house elves.”
“Let us show you.”
His shoulders relaxed; he dropped his hands and turned to Dumbledore for direction.
“What are you thinking, Rem? Is this something that’s important to you?” The concern was painted across his features, which always melted in his interactions with Moony.
“Do you have any questions, Draco? Any... problems regarding what I’ve told you?”
“When I woke up, you were there. You saved me. I heard your voice when... when I was unconscious. You were using healing charms. But... no offense... they shouldn’t have healed me from that dark of a curse. How exactly did you wake me up?”
It was one that he would keep close to his own heart forever.
All at once, chaos ensued. Death Eaters we’re running because Harry Potter was once more the Boy Who Lived. Voldemort was chasing him. And Draco was suddenly giddy and featherlight with determination.
“Where is he?” Harry demanded, louder this time. “And what the fuck are you, again? His subconscious? Take me to him!”
He watched as the night continued. He saw himself sitting in a corner, bored, with Ron as he bitterly moped about Hermione and Viktor Krum. Meanwhile, Draco had invited Pansy to ditch the ball in favor of a walk (“or something, I’m absolutely dying of boredom.”)
That wicked grin was still in place as Malfoy gestured for the rest of the men to hold fire. And then, before Draco could react, he pointed his wand at Harry.
“Yes, and you’re Remus, and I believe I just proposed to you.”
“Don’t get used to it.” And then Draco Malfoy is lifting a hand and pressing it to Harry’s forehead. The emptiness turns into an ocean of white blur, and it suddenly occurs to Harry that his time here is done. Running on pure instinct, he grasps Malfoy’s shoulders and holds for dear life, pulling him closer until he’s sure that wherever he’s going, he’s bringing Malfoy with him.
Which is why he detested the innate longing that came with prying into the business of a Malfoy; it was like an old habit that died hard. Or maybe it was that silly whisper in the back of Harry’s mind that wanted nothing more than to know Malfoy better.
Harry blinked. “Yes- it said something about the one who is able to defeat you- Voldemort- being born in July. And that neither could live...”
The air instantly froze between them, hanging in thick sheets that made breathing difficult. Harry started, realizing what he’d just done and that he had absolutely no room to recover.
He lacked words, and luckily Draco continued. “He treats me similarly. You think it’d make a difference that I’m his son, but it doesn’t.”
“Alright! Yeah, Peter!” James patted him on the back, and the banter of how exactly they were going to achieve such a feat began excitedly.
But Harry is gentle. He wraps his arms around his shoulders and whispers “I know. But it’s not true. None of it is real.”
“NO, you twat!” Draco playfully hit him in the back of the head before Harry led them from the common room. Truth be told, they had a lot more to talk about than just Quidditch and Taylor Swift.
Regulus didn’t respond but continued to glare.
“I am alive, you know.”
Malfoy sighs.
“We know.” James didn’t stray from his copy of the Daily Prophet, perched relaxedly on his own bed.
His voice was desperate, as if he was trying to convince himself as much as the boy in his arms.
But at that moment, Dobby intervened. Draco had always loved Dobby, though he wasn’t supposed to. (“House elves are not pets, Draco. Only servants.”) it was nice to see a friendly face arriving in the nick of time, and Draco wasn’t sure where they were apparating to, but he held tight to Potter for good measure.
“Actually, I haven’t. Very classy, though.”
“There is a violent threat to this school occurring at this very moment. All students are in danger. I- we- are here to put an end to it. Dare you stop us?”
“Well, on with it, Nott, before I sober up.” Blaise challenged, and Theodore smiled humorously.
“Likewise, my dear.” He smiled at her, but his eyes were cold. Abruptly, he turned his attention.
“And you’re the form of Draco’s bad memories, because his father is what he fears most.”
Harry blinked confusedly. He’d been here before. Was this the Department of Mysteries? Or was it...
- [ ] Their eyes began to adjust, and it was suddenly obvious just what the group was conversing over:  a shiny, tuned to motorbike complete with its own sidecar.
Harry’s brow furrowed in confusion, but he waited idly for the explanation to continue.
“A bit. But only because I’ve never done this before.”
Harry turned, somewhat shaken by the kindness. “Thanks. I hope I can be half the man that he was.”
“Alright!” Pansy clapped her hands together. “So, what does Team Free Will do first?”
Goddamnit, he couldn’t think, couldn’t process, couldn’t function...
Harry recalled all that Draco had been through and suddenly felt a longing urge to go back in time. To stalk across the Great Hall, grab him by the robes, and kiss him. And let him know that in due time, everything was going to be ok.
His voice cracked slightly, and it appeared that he was on the verge of tears.
“I’m sure it’s bound to fail. Or I won’t be able to afford it.”
“Well, Draco? Is it Harry Potter?” Yes, he thought. It is Potter. And Potter looks horrible. He needs my help. Why haven’t I been helping him?
How would you put that into words? And to a room full of people who would quite possibly exploit that fact? Did Draco even realize it himself at this point?
He squeezed her back, and he wasn’t sure at the time why some part of him felt relief. Like some kind of invisible pieces were falling into place.
“Your patronus is a doe, Draco. And mine is a stag. And that means something.”
“Do you recall the prophecy that Albus Dumbledore revealed to you after your little soirée in the Department of Mysteries?”
They hadn’t spoken much since Harry’s accidental name slip, and the thought kept pulling back to the front of his mind when he wasn’t distracted.
He spun around, shrieking as Harry hit the ground. Instinctively, he ran forward, pushing the ant-like creature with both hands so as to create distance between them. “Get the fuck away from him!” He called, but the others were gaining on them, and soon, they were surrounded.
“That’s it. The world’s ending. Any last words?”
When Harry looked back at its owner, Malfoy’s eyes were a humble shade of silver. Upon meeting green they seemed to dilate, recognizing what was happening with a nervousness that Harry could almost taste. How uncharacteristically pure, how subtle, how... nothing had ever happened like this. Who was this guy, and what had he done with Malfoy?
He couldn’t feel, couldn’t speak, couldn’t think. All he could do was wince beneath the blaring white that surrounded him and keep his eyes forcibly shut.
Malfoy followed Potter down the endlessness of the tunnel to Hogwarts.
“Bullying, Yeah. That’s what hanging around with those Slytherin twats is called.”
“Yes, my Lord?” He asked, very matter of factly, his tone lacking any and all emotion.
When it was his turn to be blindfolded, he entered the closet with a weird sort of anticipation that he was sure he could blame on the whiskey. Why did he care who he ended up with? It’s not like it meant anything... right?
“Oh, yes, James, I just love quidditch playing dorks who wear glasses and never stop asking me on dates!” Remus played along, laying it on thick with an arm around Sirius’s shoulder.
“I get that he wanted the...prophecy?... and all that,” Pansy started contemplatively, “but how the hell did Potter end up at the ministry to begin with?”
“...while the other survives.” He finished, eyes malicious and unyielding. Harry blinked comprehensively. When he failed to draw the necessary conclusion, he got angry.
Draco’s words held a cautious finality. There was no lying here. He had nothing to show because he’d done nothing.
Bella giggled her signature high pitch laugh, ringing like a shrill wine across the alleyway. Sirius glanced back and forth confusedly. Harry felt his stomach drop to a place somewhere between his knees and the ground.
“There’s been a break through the warding of Hogwarts. It’s been penetrated, or somehow bypassed. There are...intruders, within the walls of the castle.”
“Mr. Malfoy, no, please, don’t hurt me!” Peter cried in his own rodent-like manner. His hands clutched the bars, knuckles white from anticipation. Draco stared directly through him as he blankly focused all of his effort on the spell before him.
Sirius chuckled. “No, not this time.”
Harry froze, taking in the sight before him. “Is that-“
There was an awkward silence as Daphne eyed them both, clearly scrutinizing their companionship.
This time, however, instead of remaining solid against him, she shrugged away.
No, it was the way his pale blonde hair reflected in the moonlight as Harry threw a sideways look in his direction. It was the humble expression he wore, like he’d left his rottenness to die in a memory. Like he could finally become a potions master, if that’s what he really wanted. Like none of it mattered anymore.
This was it. This was what Malfoy was taking about in the beginning. About him being-
It’s a portrait of Draco’s family, stone cold and frozen against the frosted window pane.
Malfoy’s hands were splayed before him, struggling for balance as their equilibrium was thrown into motion. Something in Harry was disappointed that it wasn’t his forearm he was using to steady himself.
“You do?” Draco’s voice is a whisper, barely audible even in the crisp night atmosphere.
Remus shook his head with a soft chuckle. “Yes, you big buffoon.”
The day that Harry asked Draco Malfoy to marry him he was also the day that he was forced to see a Healer.
“Fuck you.”
“Thinking? More like doing. And that’s what I’m going to be doing before the end of tonight.” He wiggled his eyebrows as he gestured to the back of Daphne Greengrass pouring her own punch.
Maybe... and then there are images flashing through his mind. Of stone family drawings and cruel and unjust punishment.
“And now I live within your subconscious. The one whispering all of the bad thoughts into your skull. Encouraging the connection between us with every nightmare, every sorrow, every encounter.”
The world had turned to darkness again.
“I don’t have mine either.” He eyed Malfoy curiously before shrugging. “Might as well go on without it.” As he lowered himself through the door, Draco Malfoy refused to be silent about his uneasiness.
He didn’t dare move. He held his breath even, kept his eyes glued wide open as the world shifted. He felt like he was on the right path, a trail that would lead him to his victory. But it also felt thin, and fragile, like each memory teetered on the edge of oblivion.
“Where are we?” Draco asked, eyes peeling the room with a sad but disgusted tone. He kicked a torn piece of fabric that was lying on the floor.
When Dumbledore pointed his wand forward and released all of the power he had drawn, the reactionary light was so bright that Draco had to shield his eyes.
With a sigh, Remus closed his book and readied himself, defeated by Sirius Black. His lips pulled into a crooked smile before he spoke.
He giggled lightly, unable to contain his feathery exuberance. And suddenly Draco was chuckling, too, shaking his head with amusement and a humble disbelief of his own accomplishment.
“You know he can’t see us, Malfoy.”
“You know I can’t do that, Mr. Malfoy.”
“I don’t think this one’s mine, you prat.” His words were venomous, but the grip of their fingers intertwined only tightened.
“Probably not,” he admitted honestly. After everything that had happened, sleep was the last thing on his mind.
Draco and Harry were motionless, frozen by disbelief.
Dumbledore alerting them that there was trouble in the castle. Death Eaters- oh, Merlin... death Eaters.
Upon meeting its gaze, Harry felt his energy drain from him, leaving him frail and restless as he collapsed onto the floor. They were close, so close, and one wouldn’t have blamed Draco Malfoy if he’d kept going the last few strides to safety.
When they burst open the door to Dumbledore’s office, however, it wasn’t quite what they had expected to be greeted by.
“I just can’t believe he... did what he did.” Peter shuffled his feet, eyes down south.
Remus continued to sob, Sirius brushing his hair back comfortingly. Whispering softly:  “shhh. I’ve got you, Rem. I’ve got you. I won’t let them get you.”
His other arm instinctively crept forward, wrapping around Potter to rest by his other hand. His stomach lurched, but this time it was expanding, a balloon that had been patched. It swelled and sent waves of something- he couldn’t quite identify the feeling- along every inch of his being. His heart began to race, and it only continued to rapidly pulsate as Potter responded by gently rubbing his head against his chest.
Silence, as no one knew what to make of the sudden appearance of the loyal prefect.
“Blaise!” Pansy cried excitedly as he separated from his parents, who made their way to the elvish wine and horderves.
“A twat who wants to help.”
“Come on, Dray,” Blaise pried, picking up on his hesitation immediately. “They won’t catch us. And even if they do, I mean... what’s the worst that could happen?”
Beside him, Draco’s lips had turned upward ever so slightly. They were still pressed into a thin line, as always, but that solid corner, Harry had noticed, was subtly pulled.
Without another word or glance in his direction, Sirius was gone.
“I don’t know, it’s around here somewhere. Why?”
His eyebrows narrowed as he diverted his attention elsewhere. Beside him, Nott reached across the circle to share a high-five with Goyle.
“Do you want me to stop?” Sirius whispered concernedly. His breath was hot and heavy and Remus could feel it tickling his lips. He drew in a sharp breath, unable to process anything with his head swimming. He was drowning in black curls and rebelliousness, in soft genuity and dog fur. He was sinking into everything that was Sirius, and he never wanted to resurface.
And in the midst of that desire, he could see flashes of Draco’s memories running spiritedly trough his mind’s eye- confusion over his sexuality...hurt and rejection on behalf of his own family... the desire to be his own individual coated with earning an unattainable love...
“Don’t call him that!” Remus growled defensively, and the group began to laugh.
“We’re going to fail, Draco. We’re going to make mistakes. This won’t be our last dispute.” He gazed down at their hands, then into eyes that were as silver as the clouds pouring down above them.
“A bit harsh don’t you think?” Pansy pondered, but Draco shrugged.
“Hey Sirius, are you gonna join the team or what, mate?”
Harry had convinced Draco almost impossibly to join him at a muggle park. It was just the two of them, and the vacancy brought a sort of peace between them.
And now, he could barely pull himself together.
“I could say the same thing about you, you know.”
“Thanks, Granger. You’re not so bad yourself.” What a moment that seemed to resonate, uncanny friendships blossoming in the midst of war.
Finding Draco in his memories. Tears and laughter. Discovering that Draco was merely an equal and opposite reaction to his own existence. Still searching, desperately to find him...
“Kill you, Yes.” She took both of his hands in hers and squeezed them tight. “But honestly, Draco, fuck your father. You deserve to be happy, no matter who you end up with.”
“Precisely. You see, everyone has their own memory bank, per se. A storage of sorts to retrieve both your greatest and worst recollections. That moment in death where your life flashes before your eyes? That is when you come here.”
“No, Remus is as ferocious as a puppy.” He winked at his best friend, resisting an elbow in the ribs from Lupin, who’d migrated to Sirius’s bed.
Harry began placing kisses down the line of his jaw, moving gently to his neck, making his way to his left shoulder...
Harry watched as Draco retreated to his dormitory, followed as he found sanctuary in his very own four poster.
“You’re so fucking stubborn, Draco.”
“Are you fucking serious? You’ll drop my marks.”
At the sight of an unarmed Slytherin gang, Lily finally rushed to pull out her own wand.
“Don’t worry about them, Draco, they’re just having fun.” Pansy comforted from his left as Snape approached the chalk board.
When Bellatrix showed an interest in Hermione, he volunteered to drag the traitors to the dungeons.
“I have no doubts that this will work, Minerva. We must have faith in young Remus.”
And then he was standing by James and Peter, and all three had those pathetic puppy dog eyes that only Sirius had perfected.
It’s himself, pointing a wand at Dumbledore. Leaving with Snape. And abandoning his dreams to follow in his father’s foot steps.
He had every intention of doing so, but something uncontrollable came over him first:  a laugh. A giggle that welled from his stomach, bubbling upward as it escaped from his throat. There was something enchanting about how far they’d come. It was odd, and almost impossible, and Harry would have never seen it coming. And yet, here they were.
“What do you think is going to happen to him?”
Remus opened his mouth, clearly wondering if the middle of the Three Broomsticks was the place to say what he knew he’d felt in his heart for forever.
They were just as delicate and perfect as he’d imagined.
A chuckle, a soft release from the boy above him.
Now, he sits alone. If he’s honest, that hurts a bit.
Draco stiffened immediately, acutely aware of what was happening down low, unable to stop the raging want that coursed throughout each short circuited muscle and nerve...
“What did you want to meet me for?” He folded and unfolded his hands anxiously, and Harry suddenly realized why his animagus form was a rodent. There was something eerily rat-like about the traitor, even in his younger form. His gaze was glued to the floor until the form in front of him spoke.
He saw no body other than the man before him. In the background, however, ever so subtly... a crystal orb broke.
“Happy Christmas, Scarhead.”
The interesting bit about the Slytherins playing this game was that no one seemed to object to what was coming for them. Harry had played it once or twice, or maybe a few times in his own drunken stupor in the common room. But there were always pleas, arguments, etc. when the shit hit the fan. Not here, amongst the snakes. Unlike the lions, they were prepared for the venom that was their price to pay.
Draco faltered before him, melting into the floor without objection. He bent his head forward before vomiting profusely at the feet of the Dark Lord.
The caring tone to Potter’s voice, the way he lowers his wand and rushes to inspect him regardless of his mission is enough to push him over the edge. To ignite that same fire deep within his belly, blazing wild and free.
They were outside, by the lake. The sun was setting peacefully beyond the turrets of the castle. Harry immediately noticed the pale glow of the evening light against Malfoy’s hair; there was something utterly enchanting about it. Like it was a halo or something. Catching himself, he shifted his focus to their surroundings.
“You called me Harry.” The air was thick, and his words hung in the few inches that still remained heavily vacant between them.
The voice snapped him from his reverie, a stark contrast to the sound of the pouring rain.
“I knew you’d come to your senses eventually.”
Ron and Hermione are ascending rapidly toward Harry. The flames are climbing higher, ignited on old parchment rolls and other treasures from previous students. Harry is pulled onto Ron’s broomstick as he steers to the exit.
“I mean, together. It’s clear you don’t love me in the way you’re pretending to. And that’s okay, Harry. But we have to be true to ourselves.”
Likewise, when Harry turned to glance at their arms Malfoy immediately blushed and pulled apart.
“Mind if I hang out in your four poster tonight?” Came the voice of Sirius Black, a facetious undertone to his question.
“I’d call tonight a success, wouldn’t you?” Pansy speculated, lying back against the surface of cool stone.
He wanted to lurch forward, grab him by the shoulders, and show him just how worth it he was to him. Not as a pawn, or as a price to pay, but as a human. As the smile that played on his lips for the first time, or the laugh that jingled like a chime on the wind. As someone to hold and to fight beside. To fight for.
Oh, God, they were the perfect balance of forgiveness and pining and secrets and fresh beginnings. They were soft and supple and most definitely not sneering in his direction. Harry’s drunken self pulled closer, no longer denying his innate desire to feel every piece of Malfoy become one with himself. His hands found the back of his neck, gripping the infinity of this moment before parting his lips and inviting Malfoy inside. He was suddenly overtaken by the overwhelming sensation of warm peppermint colliding against his tongue. It was perfection at its finest. It was Draco, and Harry, and a lifetime of desire splayed before them in one solid gesture. It was the future, and everything that was to come once they (literally) would come out of the closet together. It was firewhiskey and sobriety and indulgence. It was...
The dragon loosened its grip. Draco felt his stomach soften.
“Speak for yourself, Pads.” Remus turned and pressed his lips to Black’s. It was sweet but bore an intensity that suddenly had Harry longing to grasp onto the blonde beside him for an encore. The love that those two shared was painfully obvious, and it caused Harry’s heart to throb with desire. Because the feeling that resonated between them with each kiss was achingly similar to how he felt about the boy who was currently holding his hand. He hiccuped, trying actively to suppress the giddy disbelief that bubbled in his chest as the scene played out.
Harry woke up, but never fully recovered. He was weak, but optimistic. Pale, but smiling. His gait was more of a limp, but he refused to let Draco help him.
“Good. I wouldn’t turn into a dog for just anyone, you know.” He grinned, and Remus felt a blush creep up his cheeks. That damned blush was always giving him away.
“Hey, I think tonight would be a good night to show you our surprise.”
“You can’t go and do this now, you wanker! Not when you just told me how you feel! Draco, please, please-“ he Grips for dear life, but Draco’s face is cool to the touch.
Remus tilted his head confusedly.
Harry wanted to vomit.
Remus, as if running on his own animal instinct, fled the room. Without hesitation, Sirius transformed back to canine form and followed.
“Alright, Remus, we’re here and we’re ready to party.” James Potter threw open the rickety door with Black and Pettigrew by his side.
“I love you, Draco,” he’d spoken as the swings came to a soft halt. And Draco couldn’t help but reciprocate.
“Do you seriously think that if I got bitten by a werewolf that ANYONE would become an animagus for me? My parents would probably have me executed themselves.”
Even in the darkness, Sirius could feel the heat coming from Remus’s cheeks. In a flit of spontaneity, he removed his hand and lifted himself into a seated position. With less than a foot of space between them, Sirius raised his palm to Remus’s right cheek.
At this moment, Draco appeared beside Harry to observe the happenings before them. He didn’t say a word but followed HArry’s gaze religiously.
He took a moment to wipe his own snot on the back of his sleeve, ultimately not caring about the finest of silk threading.
The words belonged to Draco Malfoy, whose hands were clasped together and pressed against his lips to quell their trembling.
Their kiss was slow, and soft, and when they separated there was an adventurous gleam in Remus’s amber eyes.
“Yes, Yes, we know. Whittle prefect,” Bellatrix mocked before Lily turned and walked away.
Draco gulped, fully aware of what would happen if he was caught disobeying. He wondered if his friends were punished in the same fashion or if this was one of the few things that separated them. After a long moment of contemplation, his desire to be free outweighed his fear of his father.
It was stupid, and reckless, and foolish, but so was sitting in a loo alone with Harry fucking Potter. Sometimes you just have to take chances.
The Death Eaters were propped stoically, as if they were puppets on strings, soldiers waiting for command to fire.
He hadn’t felt a tug at his insides like this in- well, ever. He certainly wanted to feel that way about Ginny; she really was a perfect match for him. But deep down... she never made him light up. Not like this.
He gripped his jaw, unable to finish his sentence due to the pain that was clearly shooting through the fracture site.
With a roll of his eyes a and a slight push on the shoulder, Malfoy signaled for him to be quiet as another figure emerged from the shack.
“You have a sick sense of humor, Potter.”
Harry had forgotten to breathe. When he remembered, it came in gasps that threatened to drag him to unconsciousness.
“You know what? Remus is right. Fuck you twats and your bigoted opinions. It’s none of your goddamn business what we do.”
“Draco, darling, are you alright?” Pansy blurted, expression resolute and wand held high. Draco nodded once, a thankful warmth spreading from his core.
A knot formed in the pit of his stomach as Voldemort opened his mouth to form an almost hissed word:  “Draco.”
“We’ve got him where we want him. If he thinks we’re following in our parents’ foot steps, then we’re putting on a good show, silly. Think of it as a game, and we’re winning.”
“Hey! A reptile that would die for you as well, you know.”
“It’ll be easier outside,” Potter promised, “where you can feel the freedom of the breeze.”
It puzzled him more than anything.
He flipped around nervously, fidgeting with his hands as he made contact.
They were married with only family and close friends in Luna and Ginny’s back garden. Harry had to pause during their vows for a quick oxygen enhancement spell, but other than that it was as if he wasn’t sick at all. It was beautiful, and light, and for a moment... Draco could pretend that everything was going to be ok.
There’s a tightness in his chest, and it fluctuates with his heart rate. Harry is having a nightmare, and it’s all his fault.
As the figure stepped forward, Harry’s eyes began to adjust to their surroundings. They were in a chamber of sorts... a dungeon, maybe? There were blunt iron bars to their left, forming a strict cell that seemed to hold a single occupant. Harry squinted to see who the prisoner was and recognized the very timid, hunched over form of Peter Pettigrew smashing his face against the bars.
The patronus feeling ignites a fire that courses through his veins. He knows he could perform the charm. He knows he will never fail at it again.
He hadn’t meant to show the slightest reluctance to the Dark Lord’s plan to invade the school. To “catch Potter once and for all” as soon as his presence had been identified. Forgive him- Draco loved Hogwarts. It was the only place he’d ever felt (and he’d kill you if you knew this) home. At school, he had his friends. He had games of exploding snap and good-willed jabs between housemates and witty banter. He had Potter to annihalate with sarcastic comebacks and the like. It all gave him fuel; a sense of purpose.
“Your father is one of his favorites. If his life is at stake, all of our parents’ lives are.” Blaise observed, an expression of deep thought pulling at the edges of his face.
The group of Slytherins chuckled maniacally. Lily’s face turned crimson as she began to fume.
“Your mother saved me.” The words were a whisper, and Draco felt his stomach lurch. His mother. Narcissa Malfoy still loved her son, even after his betrayal. In that moment, he felt nothing else could go right in the world.
Sirius remained by Remus’s side, gingerly cradling him in his arms before taking him to the bed one room over. He remained mostly motionless, body exhausted and healing itself from the transformation. The exception was his head, which turned instinctively to Sirius’s chest.
“No, really? You?” Harry’s words dripped with sarcasm, but a playful smile rested on his lips.
“Not my fault,” he repeats, barely audible, yet it rattles an earthquake that cracks the floor. The ground faults, and everything he’s ever know crumbles before him.
Where the fuck was Draco? Could a killing curse, even in the midst of a memory, still inflict irreparable damage to its victim?
“I don’t know if you’re thinking what I’m thinking, but-“
Slowly turning around, Malfoy crossed his arms and waited for Peter to spill the beans.
A part of him wanted to punch him again. The other part... wanted what they had. With him. Forever. What in the bloody hell was he thinking?
After receiving an earful from Weasley, they made it to the depths of Malfoy Manor. Where no one could hear the poor souls being tortured, let alone a conversation.
Once alone, he leaned over Harry’s chest.
“Drew looks at me...”
“Come here. It’ll all be fine.” She pulled him in for a brief hug, a soft smile on her lips. “Now, run along. The guests will be here soon.”
Draco was lost for words, caught in confusion. Why had he followed him? Hadn’t he done a fine job of pushing him away?
“Draco!” Harry whimpered pathetically, just a second too late. Because across the room from him, that same green light was absorbed by Draco’s chest. In a fit of adrenaline, Harry lurched forward with the intent of catching him. If this is what was happening, what was truly occurring, then Draco would fall backward, that same determined expression permanently fixed upon his face.
When Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, Draco was the first to pull him into an embrace. “You’re back,” he cried, and Harry held onto him tighter.
“I fucked up, Pans. I was trying to get information from him- about why he and the She-Weasel broke it off- and things escalated.” He winced, bringing a hand to his jaw. After a moment of cradling it, he continued. “I called him gay, and he hit me. He fucking hit me.”
Draco huffed from behind, and Harry could almost feel the eye roll. “I knew you weren’t going to tell me, you prat.”
His lips parted slightly. He hadn’t meant to run his tongue across the bottom one but it was a reflex that he didn’t quite understand let alone control as he continued to gaze up and down at Draco.
“No, no,” he murmurs, “Please, no. Hermione... Cruciatus...”
“You did not get all of those ingredients from Slughorn.”
When Sirius in all of his exuberance rolled on top of Remus, Harry heard an audible gulp croak from Draco’s throat.
He wanted that. What they had.
Like dominos, the shelves began to fall...
Draco didn’t reply, but his wand held firmly in place. Lucius’s lips upturned into a devilish smile.
He was there when his aunt Bella inflicted near irreparable damage to Hermione Granger. He didn’t stand up. He didn’t stop her.
“Well forgive me, Potter, but I do recall that we were here first?” Lucius responded coldly, eyeing the group with contempt.
“Can’t we talk about this? Like goddamned adults?” He spat, stupid as ever, almost begging in all of his naivety to push every last one of Malfoy’s buttons.
“Please, Potter. A sock in your trunk? Pathetically easy.” She simpered playfully. “And then we met Snape and headed here. It turns out he has a lot more in common with us than I had initially presumed.”
“You still love me.”
But that doesn’t stop the nightmares. Or the constant feeling of dread. And when Draco Malfoy is alone, his guilt consumes him. Why hadn’t he done the right thing? Why hadn’t he stood up to his father?
They chuckled, enjoying the moment until it appeared that a group of Slytherins was headed their way.
“I told you, I’m working on it. That’s all anyone needs to know.”
In the background, Professor Snape and Blaise Zabini were casting similar binding spells on the rest of the men.
Harry held his breath as the memory completely faded around them. It was only Draco and himself, heart-wrenchingly close to each other. He couldn’t help himself; his eyes flickered down to Malfoy’s lips. They were parted as they settled into something more serious, allowing the cool peppermint of his breath to wash over his senses.
Chatter and small talk buzzed in the background as the rest of the group eagerly threw up their glasses.
Directly in front of him, his father rose and stepped forward. This was his opportunity, the moment just before his father would regain full capacity.
Harry’s breath caught, and he reached instinctively toward a nearby shelf to touch one. As the heat of his hand met the surface, images began to play like home movies in its center. Harry focused, entranced by a very young Draco Malfoy laughing contagiously as he rode a broom for what appeared to be his first time. It was a beautiful memory, the kind that would make a good patronus.
Harry could see Draco’s amused smirk from the corner of his eye. The Marauders were laughing as the edges of the world morphed into darkness.
Harry jumped slightly but kept his focus on the situation at hand. What the fuck was happening?
“Not particularly, no. It’s kind of nice and relaxing viewing these memories, now that I know you’re alive and all.”
Harry felt his stomach lurch with anticipation. Draco was frozen next to him, but his expression held something hopeful. It was a beautiful and timeless moment...
Dumbledore was nowhere to be found. In fact, they were alone, Wands drawn but highly outnumbered.
Perhaps he was being dramatic, but Malfoy in all of his silence was no less than suspicious. Why hadn’t he cracked his normal insult? Flashed him a sneer?
It was a typical day after class for the group of friends in their seventh year, it seemed.
No longer trying to hide their romance, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were tangled up in one another, hands far from lonely. Peter laid with his eyes closed, soaking up the rays and debatably napping.
“My father always said that Sirius Black was a traitor. That he disgraced my mother’s family. But he never told me why.” His expression was blank and lacked the usual contempt that Harry expected.
He knew that Malfoy would take this as a personal offense against his house. And he realized quickly that their thin truce was about to end.
“Now. With that being said, you should know that in the coming days you will being to see more and more of our Lord. His presence is to be welcomed in the Manor as he sees so. You will meet with him one on one on a multitude of occasions, and you must not be a disappointment.”
“Stop it! Please, stop it!” He yelped meaninglessly, but in a fit of coincidence it appeared that Voldemort had finished his game. With a flick of his wand, Draco was released, his back rising and falling with exhaustion as his chest heaved.
“But who, I wonder...”
“Confringo!” He called, throwing his wand forward with a force Harry had never seen him use in duel before.
The Marauders had been quiet for a while, and the sound of the wolf stirring and jerking was enough to break him from his stupor. Suddenly, the wolf let out a loud yelp.
“I’m so glad you got to come here, Moons. I wish you could’ve come sooner.” He leaned back onto the lawn, resting his hands behind his head like a pillow. His eyes peered adorably at Remus, who turned back with a soft smile.
“Ms. Evans, you followed trouble and it led you to danger. And as for you two,” he gestured to Sirius and James, “I’m not sure what encouraged you to enter that shack, but you put everyone’s lives at risk by being there. Including Mr. Lupin’s.”
As the carriage pulled along, no one re-visited the subject of Harry Potter. The only thing that kept him on edge was the subtle confusion that remained in Draco’s grey eyes- like Pansy’s words were a newfound questioning that would reverberate against his skull when he least expected it.
“I wouldn’t put it past her. You are the Savior of the Wizarding world. I’m sure she’d love to get into your pants.”
At this, Harry couldn’t help himself. He caught himself cackling, shaking his head with a wide grin. “I can’t argue with you there, Malfoy.”
His blood was boiling. And all of a sudden, without a word, his fist had met Malfoy’s jaw.
“Blaise? Dance?” She half demanded, and as they turned to enter the dance floor, he gave one last face to his friends.
“It’s none of your GODDAMN business, Malfoy!”
Harry stole a glance at Draco, whose eyes had gone wide with anticipation. He watched their every move, contemplated what was coming. At Sirius’s remark, a small gasp escaped his mouth.
Feeling the victory flood his being, his lips pulled into a winner’s smirk.
“How very kind of you, Saint Potter.” He chuckled softly and squeezed his hand. And then, with a seriousness that could move mountains, he turned his head and faced him directly.
“How, Harry?” Draco, earnest, was ready to hear one of those Gryffindor solutions that would most likely almost get them killed but save the day anyway.
And how wrong it was. This wasn’t fucking normal. He’d gone from comforting him to wanting him and it had all happened so fast that Draco hadn’t even had time to properly convince himself of his own insanity.
“It seems a bit quiet, doesn’t it?” Draco asked at the conclusion of the next few moments. Harry nodded, puzzled. Should they venture beneath into the hollows of the tree in search of the Marauders?
As soon as they met in the middle, Pansy’s fingers flew to her lips for a full on whistle. This was followed by a few cat calls from some of the other girls in the room.
Harry shot a glance across the room at Draco, who’d landed exactly where he’d placed himself:  between his father and Remus Lupin.
Harry expected the walls to shift, to feel his body tug and lurch as he would be thrown into another memory. He closed his eyes, attempting to make sense of the thousands of panicked thoughts that raced through his mind.
Remus blushed, obvious even by the shy light of the moon.
Draco, flabbergasted, shot her a look of shock mixed with something Harry couldn’t quite place. “Pansy, what the-“
“Honestly, Harry, you’re taking this too far! We don’t like him any more than you do, but you can’t go around accusing people of being Death Eaters! That is a serious and legally bound accusation!” The wise chirp of Hermione followed Ron’s exasperation.
“Draco, listen to me, you have got to wake up. I don’t know what the fuck is going on, but your dad’s killing curse hit you, and now you’re here, and your dad’s behind me but it’s not really him it’s just your repressed memories...and I don’t know what else to do. So please, please wake up.”
“I hope he does! He almost got us all killed! I still don’t really understand how the fuck you’re alive, Remus!” His sincerity was humbling.
Harry gulped. They were pawns. Like Draco could have been. Like he’d chosen not to be.
“Alright, can you guys move the fuck out of the way or are you too far shoved up each other’s arses to know which way that is?” James let his head fall sideways as he crossed his arms impatiently.
All in all, eighth year was more than just preparing for NEWTS. It seemed that it was educational in all kinds of ways, and at the end of the day, the golden trio had learned more than they would’ve ever expected from the silver trio. And, on top of that, everyone seemed to learn that when Seamus Finnigan was drunk, you should just go ahead and listen.
“You’re right. You should’ve told me sooner. That was your job.”
“That, they did.”
Either way, the temptation was far too strong to resist, and he knew that the rest of the eighth years would be back any minute from the younger students’ quidditch match. So with a sinking feeling in his gut, he reached forward.
And suddenly he felt another sensation entirely, in a much lower area of his body.
It was dark, and Harry realized quickly that he was back in the dungeons. Even more shaded and vacant than in the last memory, he concluded that the hour must be far past nightfall. The Slytherin common room was empty with the exception of a small group of teens huddled before the fireplace.
...Regulus?
“I-I can’t be sure,” he stated, but a slight smirk was tugging at his lips. Potter tilted his head, confused. He knew that Draco had figured out his identity, but he didn’t dare say a word.
When he couldn’t take it any longer, Sirius let out a laugh.
“Nicely done, Draco. Are you ready for your second task?”
He glanced to the stag, and to the small rodent that was in Peter’s place. And suddenly, he knew.
He smiled to himself, able to feel the heat radiating from his blush. His fingers brushed lightly against it, and it was evident that Remus experienced an involuntary shudder. For a moment, his eyes closed, and his mouth dropped in a state of heaven. Sirius couldn’t help himself. Seeing Remus so relaxed, so naturally beautiful... it was too much and not enough all at once.
Peter remained silent but had sat up to nervously watch the battle unfold.
Harry gulped. He’d almost forgotten this memory, though now it ran electrically prevalent in his mind.
“Oh, god forbid!” Pansy draped a hand across her brow dramatically, as if she was going to faint. For the first time that evening, Draco’s lips pulled into an authentic smile.
“Are you sure, Dray? Because once we’ve decided this... there’s no going back.” Blaise gazed at him with eyes that held a burning finality.
It was everything he’d been afraid of from the get go, if he was honest with himself.
Black’s fingers began tracing the back of Remus’s hand softly, a small gesture that did not go unnoticed by Harry.
He wanted the reality where Malfoy had become Draco- where those gray eyes had locked into his own for moments at a time. Where they’d laughed together, and ironically created their own memories.
“He’ll be fine, love. Let’s get you standing.” Pansy looped her arms through his axillary region and hoisted him upward. Harry blinked. He was standing on two feet, and he wasn’t dizzy at all. Something wasn’t right, though it was clearly an advantage. He shouldn’t be so capable, not when... not when he’d just been...
“So you exist because of the bad things that have happened to Draco?”
“Potter, it doesn’t-“
“Draco! Are you serious right now? You can’t give up! You can’t stop fighting!” He knew that Draco couldn’t hear him; he knew that this was nothing more than a figment of a past memory.
He smiled, reflecting on the recollection before him. Ron Weasley was just as gangly as ever and hadn’t changed too much since their first encounter.
Silence remained as the memory came to a close. Harry wondered how time was passing in the real world; rules didn’t seem to apply normally in the pensieve. Minutes may have passed, or maybe hours.
His father had been cursed by a man that wanted nothing more than to see Remus Lupin dead. He’d done that in order to save his mother.
“Want to talk about it?” Blaise asked genuinely as Pansy laced her fingers into a rest for her chin.
This kiss was urgent, and heated, and it wasn’t long before Harry’s lips separated and invited him inside. Draco’s head swum. This couldn’t be real, couldn’t be fucking happening. He’d never been kissed like this before, wasn’t even sure if he was doing it right, but fuck it.
“Because you’re my brother!” Regulus’s carefully planned facade had crumbled. Here, in the middle of the hall at the witching hour, they were no longer Gryffindor and Slytherin. They were family.
“My hero complex?” Harry laughed. “Believe me, Draco. I’ll give you saving Gabrielle during the TriWizard Tournament. But you? I would’ve died for you.”
He laced his fingers, peering at the boys above half-mooned spectacles.
“Fine. I dare you to kiss someone yourself. Kiss...” Nott wiggled his eyebrows suggestively as Draco’s gaze roamed the circle. He wanted Nott to pay for his little comment about Potter. But...how?
Like it had been so many years ago when they first fell in love, wrapped up in the memory of the very inspiration for his research. Re-living a love story that was soon to become their own.
“I swear if you kill us both...” Remus grumbled, but climbed in regardless.
He felt his own stance soften as he gestured forward. “This is why.”
He finds himself outside, in the very spot where just a few weeks ago he’d been so happy and elated that he’d performed his very own corporeal patronus.
“I guess I’ve never really thought about it, to be honest.” She laid her head on his shoulder, a platonic gesture she’d done dozens of times before.
The tunnel was dark, but Lily’s lumos charm made it possible to faintly see the path to the shack.
James shrugged. “Sirius, you know him better than us. Any ideas?”
“But you do neither of those things!”
And he could take it no longer.  He lifted his other hand, resting it on his left temporal bone, pulling him closer...
With a narrowed brow and renowned determination, Harry Potter reached his hand forward.
There was a sigh, an audibly exhausted and frustrated noise. Harry could feel the eerie presence of a wand pointed in his direction.
“Touché. But tonight’s different, Rem. James is with Lily, and Peter is Merlin knows where...” he slid beneath the sheets and placed a kiss to the side of Remus’s neck. “...said he’d be gone all night... that means no silencing charms for us...” He smiled, and Remus chuckled.
Draco playfully poked Harry in the ribs, a smile adorning his face as the prospect of what exactly “that” was floated in the air between them. This was all a new adventure, and Harry couldn’t wait to dive in.
“Draco, love, have you ever considered that you may...be interested in something else?”
The first few cracks of his injured form had Draco wincing. He stood beside Potter, rooted to the floor with an emotion that had previously been unlearned:  sympathy.
Lily waited a few yards back for the gang to exit through the door above them. She turned off her wandlight and waited for an opportunity to arise.
All he could focus on was the blonde in front of him. How his breath had felt against his own chest that morning. How that smile had danced upon his lips like a personal victory for Harry yesterday. How his laugh, God, his laugh was like a goddamn Siren’s voice that captivated him to no end...
“Since when do you care about anything Muggle?”
Without further question, Lucius Malfoy walked away. And Peter Pettigrew remained, no more than a traitor, his betrayal hanging blatantly in the air.
“If he hasn’t asked you, Greengrass, I would assume that it’s because he hasn’t wanted to?” She raised her brows condescendingly, and Daphne huffed.
James smirked with a soft chuckle. “Oh, yeah, you’re a rebel Alright. You’re as ferocious as a puppy.”
Draco’s head bobbed lifelessly as Harry’s grip tightened, refusing to let him drop as he pressed forward.
He yearned to see that frown melt the rest of the way, if for no reason other than to know it could happen. And he wanted to learn exactly what Malfoy’s face would look like with a smile. How different his sharp features would appear.
“I think they’ve pretty much got it wrapped, Hermione.” Ron concluded, peering about at the bodies scattered on the floor.
Harry stood slowly, having fallen from the haste of his chase. He then glanced around cautiously, observing his surroundings with utter and blatant confusion.
Now, he’d have to wait.
“Okay, Okay, who wants another piece?” James interrupted knowingly, and the boys laughed.
At this, Severus Snape seemed to shrink back a few steps.
“You know, I really thought my patronus would be a shark.”
Harry watched intently, aware that he had little resources with which to act. He expected the light to permeate through his newest friend, to head straight for Remus in a moment that meant they had failed.
Beside him, Draco pressed all of his strength into destroying the man below him.
And Draco Malfoy would be so grateful that he’d hug him. That’s right, they’d hug. And then he’d gaze deeply into those gray eyes, and...
“You are the person that he’s head over heels for. Apparently.” He paused to... did he just roll his eyes? “And thus you have become a beacon for him, a representation of all things good. And here we are, together, two opposite but opposing equals.”
It was as if he’d known all along.
“Yes, sir.” Harry spilled gratefully, and Malfoy nodded in agreement.
They remained like this for some time, holding each other, pulling and gripping as if by some miracle each minute effort would assure their permanence. Their kiss deepened; Draco’s head tilted to allow more space for Harry.
“It was at 2 o’,clock in the afternoon, Draco! That hardly means we’re sleeping together.” Harry’s palm was thrust forward in a frustrated animation of his rebuttal.
And now, it had bit him right in the arse. Just a bit lower in all technicality, but Draco didn’t care. He just wanted solace.
“I-I don’t know...”
“Because they’re threatened by them.”
“What is it Professor? What’s happened?” Harry questioned anxiously, momentarily letting go of Draco’s hand.
“It’s good to have you back, Darling.” Narcissa moved forward, not daring to touch him but retrieving the decorative cane from his hand.
He pivoted on his heel to rejoin his group, but paused momentarily to jut out his chin and spit directly at the two Gryffindors.
“I’m going to need a word with you.”
His mother wasn’t present. Harry contemplated the significance of her absence while watching Draco cower before his father.
Harry stole a glance to his right, desperate to see the reaction written across his face. He felt featherlight, even more so now that he was armed with the knowledge that Draco Malfoy had obviously contemplated some type of relationship between them prior to all of this. He grinned as his eyes befell crimson red cheeks that matched the memory of the Draco before them.
“Whatcha doin’?” He asks curiously, hopping onto Draco’s lap as he sketches.
It’s Draco Malfoy who kisses Harry one night in the common room, a bit drunk off of fire whiskey and house unity.  But it’s Harry who kisses him back, lacing his fingers around the bare skin of his neck and tugging him closer. And in that moment, Harry feels like he’s died and come back to life.
He could almost hear his voice, muffled by his own immune response to the curse. He was laughing, and it sounded like windchimes or something equally as tranquil...
Draco slowly backed up, the man’s grip unwavering as they moved in sync. Harry was unable to speak, thoughts incoherent as he tried to piece together Draco’s undoing.
They didn’t even down half of it before it became uncomfortably obvious that they were drunk. Harry was sure it was their tiny stature and pre-pubescent livers that had done them in.
Out of the darkness stepped the blonde, eyes focused forward and resolute.
He didn’t return to Hogwarts for seventh year. Instead, he lived in the Manor with a monster. He spent his moments plotting his revenge, waiting meticulously for the right moment to play his piece.
What on earth would they be using it for today?
“Do you really think so?”
“Potter, did I- was I- were we-?” He stuttered, trying impossibly to spit out the words. Harry was stifling a laugh. Side by side they ran to the headmasters office. Under the circumstances, normally Harry would’ve been fearful or at least regretful of his mistake. But not this time.
And something snaps inside him.
Harry gulped as the memory came to a close. There was no denying it now. Harry Potter had fallen most deeply in love with Draco Malfoy.
“They’re wonderful people, the Potter’s. So are you, though. You deserve so much better than your family, you know.” Moony’s gaze softened. His hand remained comfortably wedged beneath Black’s.
Remus was quiet but flashed Sirius an almost apologetic look before leaving with him.
Potter didn’t hex him. He didn’t even reach for his wand. His brow creased, curious, but never narrowed. And that’s when Draco Malfoy decided to try something new, perhaps from his own desperate grasp for sanity. He gulped once, a testament to the spike of nervousness that rang his mouth bone dry. And without further ado, Malfoy took a seat next to Potter.
“Yes, father. Goodnight.”
She was smiling, lips pulled upward in a way that accentuated the dark maroon of her lipstick. It was a satisfied simper, like she’d accomplished something worthwhile. This was further solicited by a twinkle in her eyes that he’d only recognized from a memory that was not his own.
Subtly, she nodded. Her lids fluttered shut as she focused, raising her wand and softly whispering “expecto patronum.”
“Now, can you quit being fucking crazy and talk to me?” Harry asked. His voice was calm, and that was the worst part. How chill he could be, when Draco was drowning for reasons he didn’t even quite understand himself.
“I know he will. I’ve seen him do it before.”
The words were a sneer, and when Harry hadn’t known better he’d thought that the malice was directed toward him.
“Well, if I’m Sirius, who does that make you?” Harry meant this statement lightheartedly but felt his pulse skip as the words rolled from his tongue.
“Yuck, those putrid reds and golds...”
Malfoy shrugs. “Didn’t seem right. I was tired of manipulation. I’ve always been a follower, and I figured that if I couldn’t be a leader, I could at least support one. I knew you had a chance at setting the world free from the same bullshit that ended up killing me.”
“What do you mean?” He cocked his head, brow furrowed, confusion rocking his mind.
Draco chuckled beside him and gave his hand a squeeze.
He doesn’t reply, but meets that vibrant stare of his with irrefutable honesty.
Their eyes held a hypnotizing trance, and Draco felt his whole body go numb as he leaned forward. So whole, so right...
But that wasn’t Draco Malfoy anymore.
“God damnit Draco, what kind of absolute load are you pulling? Do you think he will be satisfied with that statement? Do you want to disappoint this family?”
“Oh, Evans, won’t you love me? With your beautiful red hair and your sassy know it all attitude?” He dramatically leaned his head on Remus’s shoulder and batted his eyelashes in an oh-so feminine manner.
When Harry Potter broke free from Hagrid’s arms, a lifeless creature beaming with sudden veracity, Draco choked. Quite literally.
“Happy Christmas, Malfoy.”
The note was scrawled in the most beautiful cursive, that of a Black. When Remus looked up, Sirius’s eyebrows were wiggling. Obviously suggesting they meet alone.
He turns to glance over his shoulder when the sound of a child laughing fills the spaces between bustling bodies and adult feet. A familiar tuft of blue hair comes dashing forward, and Draco feels a momentary reprieve from his own hollow dissonance. His face lights up as the boy throws his arms around his neck, crying “Cousin Draco! What are you doing here?”
He made a mental note to apologize to him later for the impending crick in his neck.
“I just heard this lecture the other day,” he whined, and Harry laughed.
“Pansy,” he managed to speak, raspy and weak but capable. “Where’s-“
“We’re drunk,” Harry said as the world began to sway, reflecting outside what he so desperately felt within.
It was probably just his hatred of the bloke.
“We’re going to run some tests,” the Healer told him, and he nodded curtly.
“Don’t you?” She asked almost omnipotently. Neither of them said a word, lost in their own ideas of what was to come.
It wasn’t the hurtful words of his father, ringing like a screeching alarm clock on repeat throughout his brain. Telling him he was a failure, a nuisance, an embarrassment.
Harry beamed as Sirius Black mounted his new ride, complete with the leather coat and three days without shaving.
And those few words were enough to completely flip Harry’s world upside down.
“I made more mistakes than you.”
“I’m saying we save our own skin. We’re bound to end up either dead or in prison if we follow in our parents’ footsteps. I know it sounds a bit far off, but... I think Potter has a shot. I think he’s going to win.”
As they passed the area where the Marauders rested, it surprisingly looked like they weren’t going to stop. No snide comments; no rude glances in their direction. It was almost suspicious, how indifferent they were.
Draco and Harry joined in on the clapping, and there was an air of freedom that hung across the room. Like they were celebrating so much more than the event at hand. Harry felt like he could fly; he was featherlight with contentment. Draco hooped beside him, joining in on the festivities with ease.
He smiled; that tickled a little. And then...
He gestured toward her, and her cheeks blended into her hair at the sudden attention. She only smiled, however, beaming at the man she’d said yes to.
“Please, Sir. They’ve caused us enough trouble already.” He spoke softly, resistant to the Slytherin’s bait tactics.
And he’d stomp on his face, breaking his nose with an unhealthy snap. Harry didn’t want to relive the pain of that moment, but in all fairness he had broken Malfoy’s jaw recently. Maybe they could call it even now.
After the war, Draco had considered himself a work-in-progress. He’d ventured through the stages of grief, mourning his losses and wishing he could change the past. He’d also picked himself up off of the floor, vowing to start new. None of this was easy. Panic followed him around every corner, but around every corner was the reassuring laugh of Teddy; smile of Harry. If he’s honest with himself, he’ll admit their great assistance in his own healing.
“Hey Draco?”
In this world, he was merely serving detention alongside an enemy. The boy beside him was Malfoy- most certainly not Draco. It seemed the time had come to mesh back into this life, and in order to do so he’d have to head along to Gryffindor tower and complain to Ron about what a horrible time working with the stupid git was.
He brushed his hand against Harry’s subtly, signaling for him to follow. Together, they approached the head master. The auror exited, and Dumbledore smiled and clapped his hands together.
If he would’ve kept his mouth shut, quelled his Gryffindor instincts and pressed his lips into a hard line of defiance, then maybe he wouldn’t be here. But, no.
But it’s vanished.
Working for the ministry is like working in one of those Muggle cubicles. He should be grateful for the opportunity, but Draco hates his job. His boss is monstrous, a poised figure that reminds him far too much of his father.
Harry could contain his giggle no longer. He’d never expected Draco to be just as awkward in these situations as he was.
“Like what?”
He slowly made his way to the table of golds and reds, when another boy of his age began to clap. Harry studied his face, rounded spectacles perched beneath messy hair and instantly knew that James Potter was in the building.
Would he be bold enough to refuse, even if it meant his own death or the death of his family?
“Please. We all know McGonnagal has a soft spot for me.” James winked before continuing. “We’ve drank the potion, we’ve read the spells, we’ve done it all. It’s now or never, guys.”
“Yeah, it is, hm?”
Giggling, Harry’s grin had widened impossibly. “Shut up, Malfoy.”
“The wolf took my optimism when it bit me.”
“I disobeyed over the summer. I told him that I wanted my own path in life. That I wanted to do potions. Open my own shop somewhere, maybe in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.” He paused, as if debating whether or not to continue. His eyes were lit up, as if just by speaking about his dreams he could pretend he was living them. His gaze fell at his apparent decision to relive his next memory. “He used the Cruciatus on me for hours. He’d give me a rest, and right when I thought my tribute was paid I was on the ground again.”
The word struck like lightning, radiating fire throughout his entire being. Harry watched his joints stiffen, bending unnaturally as they tried to cope with the pain. He’d hit the floor now, gnashing his teeth and quite obviously holding his breath.
When they were gone, she finally lowered her wand.
“So, I know what we can do to help Rem at the next full moon.” Sirius rolled over to face the other two. Peter perked up enthusiastically; James peered upward from the paper.
They separated briefly, gasping for breath as they hovered mere inches from each other. Remus’s hands were still clung to Sirius’s robes, and he made no move to let go. Their eyes were locked, and this moment was everything.
Remus chuckled. “Unfortunately, I believe you’re right. Let’s pray that he gets his personality from Lily.”
That was the year he faked his attempts to kill Dumbledore. That was the year he held his wand to the man, playing the role astutely. He never had any intention of ending his life, and it showed. It was all a part of Draco’s plan.
“Besides, we’re better at magic. We know dark spells that those pathetic Gryffindors couldn’t handle. I think I am more than capable of handling Remus Lupin, even in beastly form.” He wiggled his fingers in a creepy gesture at the word ‘beast.’ As if this was all a game to him.
The hat perched heavily on his head, clearly deciphering many thoughts and suggestions from the boy. It crinkled, and bent, and grew eerily silent before it seemed to gaze about the room in its own way. With a roar, the word “Gryffindor!” Filled the Hall.
“Yeah, I guess it is. Twat.”
They were in the Great Hall. It appeared that this was the sorting feast, although for what year he couldn’t be sure. Solid black robes lined the front of the room, eyes darting back and forth nervously.
Lily, aware of Regulus Black’s accusation, headed to Padfoot to cast a soft healing charm on his leg. With a thankful glance in her direction and a quick lick to the face, he jumped to Remus and sunk his teeth into the loose skin of his back. He then pulled, and eventually the two toppled over each other while Regulus scooted back impetuously. He scrambled to his feet while Padfoot kept Moony calm.
It was Lucius Malfoy who turned his wand on her.
“Yeah, we should...”
“Do you know why I have summoned you today?”
The movie is over, and all that remains of the last few minutes is a line of scrolling credits.
Because even in their minimal contact, Blaise and Pansy’s touch had never felt like this.
Harry snickered, and Draco shrugged nonchalantly. “If it weren’t for this moment, I wouldn’t have you now.”
“Obviously, the dorm was empty. But- and this is the part where my morals slipped- I had an idea. I remembered that day, in Slughorn’s, when you won the Felix Felicis. And, call it a girl’s intuition... I thought it might come in handy.”
“You leave me no choice. Crucio.”
That was Draco’s only turn, thankfully. When Daphne was discovered to be passed out cold on Zabini’s shoulder, people started calling it a night.
“Yeah, how did you save him?” Ron added, and Draco chuckled softly. No wonder they were best friends
“I think I’m going to be sick,” he commented, but straightened up with a smile.
Draco, meanwhile, was drowning. He hated his life. He hated the pressure of being the Dark Lord’s own personal Chosen One. And the worst part was that nobody knew. None of his housemates knew he hated himself. He harbored the secrets of suicidal thoughts daily. He wanted nothing more than to win- to rebel against all he’d been chosen for. To let Dumbledore live. To be his own person. To make a stand.
Harry was excited to be moving forward from his somewhat uncomfortable awakening in the shrieking shack. Turning to the blonde, Harry noticed his pale locks glowing in the moonlight.
“Where are we?” Malfoy’s voice was barely above a whisper, the words hanging on the edge of the darkness that enveloped them.
What was so... wrong about this place? He couldn’t seem to put his finger on the doom residing in each square inch of the room.  It made the air heavy, and he felt like the oxygen was thinner here. As if he was suffocating on instinct alone.
“Think hard about what you’ve learned of this place. When do people come here?”
When the door swung open behind them, all faces focused on the intrusion. Rushing in with wands readied was a group led by none other than Dumbledore himself.
“Much better. He was banished from the Noble House of Black. They even burned his name from the family tree that they supposedly throw in everyone’s face as some kind of pure blood record.” He paused, a slight roll in his eyes.
And then, like lightning striking through his being, Harry knew. He just... knew that everything he’d been feeling, thinking, wanting, was mutual. He ran forward, pulling Malfoy into an embrace that quickly led to a sample of those lips.
Draco had stomped out, thoroughly ruffled. How dare Potter offer help to him? As if testifying on his behalf wasn’t enough. Draco didn’t need any more favors. He didn’t need any of it.
He splashed water on his face, scrubbed his cheeks with both hands in an attempt to compose himself.
“Remus Lupin, will you marry me?”
All at once, the images of his memory began to flash in rapid succession across his mind’s eye. Detention. The pensieve. Draco disappearing. Harry searching, and searching...
“Are you feeling alright, boys?”
For a moment, there’s nothing. His eyes adjust to the emptiness, and he’s stumbling as he stands and tries to make out the puzzling aftermath of this purgatory. And then, a voice.
The anger was what masked the sadness, and the determination to seek revenge kept him on his feet.
Fighting was something the Headmaster never took lightly. Harry folded his hands in his lap nervously as they sat before him, awaiting the verdict.
“Yeah, I think that covers it.” His lips closed to form a crooked, shy smile that resonated a seriousness between them.
“Yes, you did. That’s why you invited me here, huh? To finally break things off for good?”
“The worthless mongrel.”
Draco’s eyes flickered down to Harry’s abdomen, or perhaps something lower, and had it not been for his Godfather getting it on a few feet away he knew he’d use this moment to claim Draco as his own.
Harry started. This was... another memory...
Draco Malfoy couldn’t remember a time when he was held. As a child, he found more emotional reprieve from the house elves than his own parents. His tears would provoke no more than a frustrated growl from his father and an exasperated “not now, darling,” from his mother. And presently, with everything that had attributed to the absolute hell that was his sixth year, not much had changed.
Perhaps it was because deep down, they were drawn to each other. The light and the darkness, two sides to the same coin that can’t exist without the other. Maybe it was because they’d known all along that there was something there, nagging along the inner walls of their thoughts.
“Wh-what?”
Draco’s fingers sparked as they gripped Potter’s bicep. They tingled as he gently traced the lines of his arm, grazing up and down in the way he’d always imagined someone doing for him.
“Perhaps. But I was created by and born of your own monsters. Thus who is there to blame but yourself?”
But when Pansy decided she wanted a snack, and thought the best idea was to sneak back inside with an unsteady gait, things quickly turned south.
When Potter was picked for the Triwizard Tournament, his first emotion was fear. He’d hated Potter, sure, but he didn’t want him to die. And a fourteen year old in a completion like that was bound to end bloody.
Together, they headed inside, like so many times before. This one, however, held something impossibly different.
“What the fuck, Potter? How did you-“ His face is a cross between confusion and embarrassment, and his heart is pounding.
“Not your father, Draco... amazing... need you... love you...”
“Send him a Patronus, Lily. I know it’s difficult magic, but you’ve done it before. I’ve seen you practice.” James’s tone was soft and caring, like the world depended on Lily’s magical ability and that he had not a trace of doubt that she would succeed.
Remus shook his head, years still surfacing. “Of course, you idiots. I love you guys.”
“And if He Who Must Not Be Named finds out that we’re against him? He’ll kill our parents, then us.”
“It’s a love story, baby just say-“
There’s a wand at his throat.
Harry’s heart began to pound, lifting heavily against his chest at the prospect of what impact this might have on the boy beside him. Because this was no memory. Here, in the present, strolling forward with a smirk that could kill was none other than Lucius Malfoy in the flesh.
Harry decided to take a seat as he watched the game unfold intently.
“Draco! Draco, can you hear me?” He asked, patting his robes and searching for any sign of injury. His eyelids remained shut, face in an almost tranquil expression of slumber. Harry paused, glancing for any changes or proof that he sensed his presence.
Closer. Closer. And the figure turned around so that he was no longer facing Harry but staring offhandedly into the distance. Harry swore he saw a wisp of platinum hair slide from beneath his cloak as he pivoted, but he couldn’t be sure. He picked up the pace, coming in at a fast jog a he minimized the distance between them. His heart pounded as the man remained frozen to the spot, almost Godlike in his rigid stance. That composure, that poise, it was almost familiar... too familiar...
Draco remained frozen to the spot, wondering when the hell the world had turned upside down.
Missing something. Needing something. Barely hanging on. Clinging to the idea of his friends for support.
“Eventually, I’m sure. We’ll probably all end up dead unless we do exactly as he says.” Pansy added, more serious than Harry had ever seen her.
Death Eaters began firing curses left and right.
He felt like vomiting. What was going to happen? Was Sirius’s memory charm advanced enough to permanently erase their memories of Remus? Where the fuck was Draco? Harry refused to lose him. There had to be a way... he had to be around here somewhere...tucked away safely in a...
He’s barely conscious, but he feels a tugging sensation on his limbs. And then he’s weightless, like he’s riding on air. The pain, it’s lessening. He must be close to death…
If anything, however, he seemed slightly better than he had when they’d initially seen him in the hospital. But the sight nonetheless was gruesome and heart wrenching for all that were standing there.
“You see, Harry, we all have light and darkness within us. I’m sure you are aware of that much. But what happens when you form memories is a bit more complicated.” He tilted his head with feigned innocence before continuing.
As Draco closed the door behind him, his mask seemed to break. He hurriedly entered a nearby washroom, and Harry watched as he wiped the tears away. He gazed into the mirror, gripping the sink as his breath caught with each recollection of his encounter with the Dark Lord.
“You have completely changed my life, Draco. Everything is different when I’m with you. In a good way, I promise.” He laughed. “Be my husband? For the rest of our days?” Puppy dog eyes left Draco’s head reeling. He couldn’t say no even if he had ever wanted to.
All at once, Everything and nothing seemed to make sense. Harry had never known, he’d never had any idea...
Harry did his best to ignore the objections of his newest nemesis. He wasn’t sure if his makeshift plan would even work, let alone leave them unscathed.
He didn’t know what he was doing. He could blame it on the intoxicating feeling that was holding someone who needed to be held. Except that person was Potter, who’d somehow inevitably became Harry...
“I- I don’t understand,” he stammers, but Malfoy’s rising and crossing the empty space between them.
Time resumed at normal speed but Harry swore everything was moving faster.
“What did you do to him!? Potter!” Snape drew his wand before he could answer. He stuttered a bit, hands still raised in surrender. It was at this moment that Bellatrix and Regulus began to stir.
A figure looked ahead, adorned in black robes that trailed the ground behind it. Harry stepped forward curiously, but when he closed the distance between them he realized much too late that it was no person at all.
With an elbow to the ribs, Harry found himself being pulled toward the shrieking shack by the Slytherin.
Both Draco and Harry lurched forward, eager to see what the writing entailed. When Draco’s shoulder brushed unexpectedly against Harry’s, even the time within the pensieve seemed to slow.
On the third shelf down, he seemed to pause, cocking his head as he pondered the title of a black and gold hardcover.
Draco chuckled from beside Harry. “I can’t believe it. She gave him a chance. I never saw that coming.”
Whispered sniggers rang from the group.
Their stare was held constant, and he felt as if they were one, as if Sirius could see straight through his soul. And strangely, that didn’t bother him.
But James’s focus was a million miles away, landing steadily on a few tables down.
“Not yet, Potter! You’ll ruin the brew! And quit saying that.”
Potter snapped him from his reverie:  “Fuck.”
His focus was pulled by Sirius’s hand slipping gently up Remus’s shirt. His gaze quickly became frozen in their direction, and Draco’s followed out of curiosity.
“I don’t get it!” He complained pathetically, falling into a chair. “Why doesn’t she like me, Remus? You guys are friends.”
He collapsed, breathing heavy and desperate for oxygen. He was rapidly becoming numb, and cold, like ice...
“Since when did you two start finishing each other’s sentences?” Ron blurted, genuinely curious but, as always, lacking tact.
Draco lowered his head in feigned respect. “I won’t let you down, my Lord.”
They entered the Room of Hidden Things as it had appeared in the past:  piles of random belongings, stacks of newspapers and brooms and a plethora of items that had once belonged to past Hogwarts students. There were mannequins and dust covered bookshelves that held knowledge amongst their pages; cob webs adorning old sets of robes and trunks with additional treasures inside.
Draco stood, shaking, his face a mixture of relief and utter disbelief. Harry hopped to his feet as their eyes met, and his gaze held the same kind of shock that meant something big had happened. Something life changing.
When they crossed through the grand entrance, both McGonnogal’s and Dumbledore’s robes were trailing the stone not far ahead. Harry stepped forward with Draco close behind with the intent on continuing their trail when suddenly the atmosphere began to bubble.
Draco Malfoy, pulling himself to a standing position in the Room of Requirement. Defying any and all thoughts of failure. Wounded by a curse from his own father, but gathering himself regardless. Standing strong, against all odds.
Remus was silent, mouth agape from his sincerity. It was so Sirius of him, so loyal and determined and unapologetically beautiful. Finally he spoke.
“Draco, wait!” He hears faintly, but he refuses to turn around. He’d rather die than see his face again. This is a fucking nightmare.
“I think I did. I know, it’s hard for me to believe it, too.” He grinned with playful sarcasm. Meanwhile, Peter grabbed another piece of cake behind him.
The hat didn’t take long to belt the loud cry of “GRYFFINDOR!” Across the Hall. There were cheers and yells as she skipped to her new table, and Harry couldn’t help but beam proudly.
“Humor us, Black.”
“H-Harry- uh...”
And Draco panicked, realizing that the inevitable had somehow occurred. What he’d pretended wasn’t going to happen, what he’d wished would never happen...
Harry ignored his own mannerisms and instead migrated toward the Slytherins as they began their assignment.
Immediately, Draco perked up. “What are they saying? What do you think happened?”
“Yeah. Bloke’s quite the nerd, isn’t he?” Sirius said with a smirk, smiling to himself more than anyone else.
“And Potter is...?” Blaise lifted an eyebrow questioningly.
He stood there for quite some time.
His anger was almost frightening, though clearly born out of care and concern.
And when the boy turned, Harry noticed the familiar color of his irises. Slate gray, like the sky on an overcast day...
Draco smirked to himself, perfectly aware of how to piss on Theodore Nott’s evening.
“Yes?”
This time, they landed near the Great Lake. The sky was a crisp blue, evident even in the dull hues of the memory. Several students were outside; some where studying, others were playing games.
“He wants you to be a Death Eater.” Harry’s conclusion brought Draco’s gaze back up to his own. Emerald held flush with gray, open and honest.
Sirius peered over, realizing immediately where his gaze was. Before he could interject, James was already standing.
“Nah. I’m not quite in the mood.”
“I’m not sure, yet. But I don’t think it’s an absolute negative. I can see that he really regrets what he did, and you know how Pete is susceptible to bullying...”
“I hate to say it, but Sirius has a point. I think we should do it.” Jame’s reached over and bumped fists with his best friend.
For being the selfish, unable to see two-feet-in-front of him kind of guy that he was. That he wouldn’t be anymore.
Detention might not be so bad after all.
Draco eyes the picture smiling, and it is the best he’s ever felt.
He was in what appeared to be the foyer of Malfoy manor. Draco was perched motionless on a couch, straight as a pin, rigid as a hardened statue. His eyes were glued to the floor as his mother paced nervously before him.
Instead, he quickly and recklessly decided to risk diving in anyway. Without hesitation, he leaned forward, touching his nose to the substance that poured outward.
Draco had eventually given in to Potter’s endless badgering and met him on the grounds after curfew to practice.
Harry’s stare flickered down to his lips, a foreshadowing that stole Draco’s breath. He felt it hitch somewhere in the back of his throat as Harry suddenly lurched forward, slicing the air and destroying any and all separation between them. His lips crashed into Draco’s, a tidal wave that swept him under and ironically left him feeling like he could finally breathe.
His heart stopped, just like it had in the memory. And suddenly all of his emotions came flooding back like rain. He pivoted back, and when his pulse returned it was fluttering rapidly.
“Trust me, NO ONE has forgotten about that.”
He thought back to the blush that tinged his cheeks at their earlier mention. He found himself, against all odds, smiling. Because something, in all of their chaos, felt right.
Harry’s heart stopped momentarily as if by the grace of something holy Dumbledore had heard him. He paused, looking in Harry’s direction for a split second before continuing his work.
Behind them, the memory of the infirmary continued to play.
“Yes, of course. I’m honestly ecstatic that those two are going to make it official.”
In his place was a small rodent, brown and almost measly, with a long, wiry tale and a twitching nose.
“Save it for trial, Malfoy.” Kingsley silenced his father with a respectful meet of his eyes with Draco’s. It was a solid and genuine gesture that reminded him of all he’d done right.
“Come on, boys,” she says determinedly to them all, “we’ve got a war to win.”
“No, you prat. It worked for Slughorn but we- we didn’t smell anything.”
Nothing made Draco happy anymore. Not since the war, which had resulted in the imprisonment of his father and a depressed mother. He’d only been pardoned himself because of Potter, a shame that he’d had to live with daily.
There was violence, bruises left on parts of Draco that Harry wanted to touch and heal. Apparently the Cruciatus curse hadn’t been enough of a punishment at times. Draco watched himself become beaten to a bloody pulp, begging for forgiveness to the man that was supposed to love him.
“He left me with his memories in hopes that I could use them. And, when the time was right, I would be able to share them with you.”
“Alright guys, now that we’re at my house, we can put all of this practice to good use. Are you ready to try it out?” James broke the silence with a smug grin that bore confidence in their ability.
He ran his hands along several orbs with Malfoy now in tow.  Images of Draco- laughing with his friends, learning in the classroom, strolling about Diagon Alley- they were all much too young. He picked up his pace, weaving through shelves and dodging Malfoy’s chase as he neared what had to be getting close to the end.
James Potter held steady as the wand in his hand. It seemed that nothing would cause him to falter when it came to his friends.
He smiled, signaling for them to leave.
“What is that, father?”
“The Headmaster? He’s allowing it to happen!” Lucius spat angrily, and Lily’s green eyes were wide with a mixture of concern and disbelief.
As he was approaching the trio, who were mostly keeping to themselves and hardly causing distraction, his attention was pulled by the sound of his own voice.
“Since when do you care about Hermione? We can’t trust you!” Ron yelled, but Harry put a hand up to silence him.
And then, like a train that was violently thrown from its tracks... Harry remembered. He remembered how this story would end. How the forgiveness unfairly bestowed upon Peter Pettigrew by his parents would result in their ultimate betrayal. How the innocence and freedom of Sirius Black was soon to be robbed from him in exchange for 12 years of suffering in Azkaban. How Remus Lupin never got to change his last name and instead spent more than the next decade believing that the love of his life had been the one to steal every last shred of happiness that he’d been given.
And then he was standing in the Department of Mysteries, and there was an archway ahead. His stomach dropped as he painfully remembered what had happened here...
The ovation continued, not hesitating but instead growing even louder.
He inched backward as prey surrounded by the enemy before abruptly turning his head to the ground. To Harry.
Harry stopped, breath quickening.
The increased occurrence of Pansy’s presence had brought about a very sly, coy Blaise Zabini. Ron had refused to acknowledge his placement at their parties (“soirées” according to Pansy) until one day Blaise cracked a joke about Malfoy and- damn- If that didn’t have Ronald Weasley spewing his butter beer. They, too, had become an inseparable duo, and Harry had just about had it (“UP TO HERE” he’d said) because if Pansy was there, and Blaise was there, then Draco most definitely was going to be there. All the goddamn time. And there was no one he still despised more than- well, come to think of it, he really didn’t anymore. At the conclusion of the war, Malfoy had become sort of a gray character in Harry’s life, one who’d shown his condolences and grown quite a bit. They’d shared small conversations here and there, but nothing to speak of. And definitely not anything to make them friends. Malfoy and Potter could never be friends, no. There’d always been something so much deeper than that, whether it was hate, or just a plain abomination that resonated between them. But, whatever it was, it wasn’t friendship. It was fire, and passion, and knowledge, and fury. It struck Harry’s insides like wildfire, like the hot breath of a Hungarian Horntail. No, they would never be friends.
“Because it’s Wormtail. Wormy wormy wormtail.” Sirius tipped his drink back, finishing the last of the sweet foam that lapped at the bottom.
“Why? Aren’t you excited for the holidays?”
Red-faced and bothered, Draco’s lips did pull into a soft smile at her insinuation.
The laugh of Sirius Black continued to echo as the room began to morph again.
“Okay, my not friend. Now turn to page 450; that’s where I’m struggling.”
He paused, turning on one heel to see what the fuck more his father wanted. “As the Malfoy heir, you are expected to follow in my footsteps. The Dark Lord will accept nothing less from you.”
All he could manage was a nod, insufficient as it seemed.
When the lights dimmed, and the memory began to transform, Harry swore he heard Malfoy whispering. The words were rushed, and indiscriminate, but the words “I wish I had that,” were not easy to mistake.
He noticed Potter’s heated cheeks first.
He wore an almost blank expression that lacked any remorse. Draco’s mouth dropped.
In his peripheral vision, Harry began to see figures. Glancing in their direction revealed a very recent Draco Malfoy perched in his own hospital bed with a bottle of skele-gro in one hand and the other cradling his jaw.
Their focus was drawn to the redhead that had emerged from the castle doors.
Voldemort was still laughing. It sent chills down his spine and what remained of his senses seemed to freeze in a bout of hypothermia.
“You know, Draco, you don’t have to move into another building. I know you hate your neighbors because they remind you of your family. Our flat is large enough for a third member.”
“Though it seems as if you were well taken care of.” Hermione finished, eyeing the Slytherins thankfully. “I’m thoroughly confused, I must admit, but any friend of Harry’s is a friend of ours.”
It seemed that the sparking fire may just never come.
Their lips met once more, but this time it was like opening the front cover to a book Harry had never read before. There was passion and a ravenous electricity that frayed every nerve on site. Harry had never been kissed, not like this, and it quickly became evident that everything before this moment- this person- was a waste of time.
His brows immediately furrowed. “You get to make out with a girl and I have to expose myself to a bloody cat!?”
And Harry had to find Draco. He had to follow the memories to find the boy that never had a choice. He had to profess everything he’d learned so far to him, every last detail that’d suddenly lit up his world like lighting in the middle of a storm. A storm that held the same pastel gray as Draco’s eyes...
“Yeah, well, I can.” Surprisingly, it was Lily Who put her foot forward. “Forgive me, but I think it’s safe to say that we got the most noble of the house of Black.”
He runs a hand along the edge of Draco’s jaw, and he stirs a bit. His fingers glide lower, down the soft plane of his neck and collarbone. Draco shivers. Potter laughs.
“Are you sure about that?”
“You are going to kill Albus Dumbledore.”
Some of these orbs were blank as he touched them- memories that hadn’t yet been filled. He backtracked, racing along the same aisle, touching each ball of white light softly until-
When Voldemort falls, dying in a most humanly fashion, it’s Draco Malfoy who stands next to Harry. They share a celebratory moment, a second that extends beyond Life, even Death, itself. And it’s perhaps the most exhilarated Harry has ever felt.
“Albus, are you sure this will work?” The concerned voice of Minerva McGonnagal was enough to raise the hair on Potter’s arms. Pointlessly, the two remained hidden behind the bush together. There was an understanding between them that seemed to override any hatred held against the other. Whatever this was, it was important.
“Git.”
When he was rejected by Potter on the train, he was hurt. Baffled. Lost. His father had always told him to stay in good standing with those who held power, and, wow, if he hadn’t already fucked that up.
Draco nodded, holding the stare intently as the world began to shift.
Harry draws in a breath and is suddenly very aware of Malfoy’s presence beside him. It’s intoxicating- potent- and he-
He didn’t have to see his face to read his expression. He knew that smirk anywhere, could feel it dripping from the haughty tone of his voice. He balled his fists involuntarily as the knot in his stomach tightened. After everything he’d seen, every memory he’d walked through, the sound of that voice made him want to do nothing short of vomit.
And all at once, certain memories started falling from the shelves and shattering against the floor. Their contents were projected high above them, like a theater screen playing a movie. It was images of Draco, and his father, and every dastardly thing that had happened to him wide on display.
Harry’s mouth dropped, gears turning and working and putting together conclusions that he’d yet to draw.
They finally separated, eyes fluttering open and allowing the world to fall back into place once piece at a time. Their eyes held, piercing green against cool gray, and it was perhaps even more beautiful than the first meet of their lips.
“You’re being fucking ridiculous. And petty. And-“ he ducked once more- “quit throwing things at me!”
“But then-where are we?” Harry thought aloud, but at that moment a shining headlight broke through the darkness. He used his remaining hand to shield his eyes as they adjusted, but what gave away their setting was the group of voices surrounding it.
Was that really how it happened?
His mouth was bone dry, words lost on the desert of his tongue. And then, like some kind of miraculous rain, his drought ended with the honesty that had been pulling at his gut all day.
As they closed the distance, Regulus cocked his head haughtily. “Look, Bella, this must be what your cat dragged in.”
Darkness turned to light as Harry found himself submerged within another memory. It was a crisp, cool day not unlike the weather recently. His stomach lurched as he realized the implications of this thought, but his attention was quickly diverted by the sight of Slytherin robes crossing the corridor before him.
“Draco,” Harry whispered as the world continued in bleating silence. “These are your memories, right? What the fuck is going on?”
Hermione had grown a bit more since she’d stumbled into the compartment, showing off her recently discovered ability to do magic. Harry shook his head at how young they were with a silly grin. How much had changed, how many things had happened since then...
“Now.” He leaned forward, face towering threateningly above Peter’s. “I want to hear it from one of his closest friends. Tell me, Peter. Why does Remus Lupin disappear every month at the full moon?”
Draco nodded once, readying himself for the unexpected. Who knew why, or how, but someone had lost faith in him. And now, Draco suspected, they’d want to do the job of killing Albus Dumbledore themselves.
It was the wind whipping at Harry’s hair with each launch, the stupid grin plastered across his face... the way spit was slung across his upper lip as he laughed. It was everything in that moment that made Draco fall for him.
Draco obeyed, immediately making his way down the corridor. Behind him, the screams of Petter Pettigrew echoed against the walls as Voldemort pulled out his wand and presented another round of the Cruciatus curse.
Harry’s smile faded considerably upon turning to the git, whose face had paled several shades closer to white.
After walking about the rose garden casually for a while, the two sat on a stone bench to blow off some steam.
Draco nodded once in acknowledgement, a jerky interruption to his stillness.
“They’re going to ambush him.” Draco’s observation held the same sinking feeling that Harry felt in his stomach as the group found the branch that allowed them to enter beneath the tree.
“James says the Slytherins won’t even talk. He thinks we’ve scared them, but... I feel like they’re planning something.”
When Malfoy didn’t answer, an idea struck Harry, lighting him with new motivation from the ground up.
“We’ve got to tell the Headmaster,” Lily squeaked, trying with all of her logic and reason to remain calm.
They settled in the familiarity of the Gryffindor common room. It didn’t look much different than the one Harry had left that morning, except the faces were hardly recognizable.
Holding a soft expression, an almost contemplative face, Harry felt his own lips tug upward. “It’s nothing.”
The world around him was dark, but he didn’t mind. Nothing could bother him here. Not in this dream, or reality, or whatever it was...
Sirius and James let out a loud and boisterous guffaw; Remus rolled his eyes with a smile.
The Boy Who Lived himself chose that very moment to lift his head, meeting Draco’s nervous gaze. Their faces were only inches from each other, and Draco could feel the soft puff of his breath against his lips...
“Draco, no! Fuck!” He glances around, desperate for some sort of answer, before deciding to cup Draco’s face in his hands.
After the war, Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned. Draco was granted a reprieve, thanks to an honest testimony from Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Their eyes met in a way that was much too intimate for the kitchen table.
“Please, Malfoy, don’t act like you’ve never done it before.” Harry took Ginny’s hand, preparing to walk in the opposite direction.
“I suppose you want this back?” She asked, retrieving the vial from within her pocket.
It was a pensieve.
“To Draco.”
Draco shook his head.
Harry’s wordless reply was the violent and heated pull of Draco’s lips back to his. In that moment, and consequently each one forevermore, all was well.
Pettigrew now cowered in his cell, crawling toward the back wall and fidgeting restlessly.
Regulus Black froze at the sentiment of James Potter. Slowly, he turned to face the opposing side. Overhearing the commotion, Severus Snape approached from behind and stood protectively next to his housemate.
“Potter. He suspects something. He thinks I’m- maybe even we’re- following You-Know-Who.”
What was at first an innocent memory that they observed from afar was quickly becoming a heated moment that left the boys both embarrassed and red.
Harry isn’t sure what to expect when he meets Death- the blinding emerald light of the killing curse hurled in his direction is only a symbol of what he’s imagined thousands of times in this very moment.
Green eyes held grey as Dumbledore brought them back to reality. “I’ve notified the Ministry of tonight’s happenings. The aurors should be here shortly.”
“Granger’s looking good, huh?”
“Just be safe, Blaise. You never know what you might... catch.” Draco drawled sarcastically while Pansy buckled over.
Draco appeared puzzled but absorbed. When the lights began to dim, closing in on the trio’s chatter, Malfoy spoke unexpectedly:
What better way to do that than to end it all? He contemplated this on several occasions, ready to Avada Kedavra himself into oblivion. Something kept him from doing so, however. A small voice, his conscience, perhaps the portion of him that almost made it to Gryffindor - kept stopping him. Because an energy that resonated deep within his being wanted to see Voldemort fall. He wanted to watch Harry defeat him. He wanted to... to help.
“How are you, Moons?”
He smirks. “Please, Potter. I thought we were beyond all of that nonsense now.”
“I-I don’t get it. Why isn’t he killing him!?” Regulus cried, almost angry that the wolf wasn’t attacking his brother like it had him.
It was only a memory, it was only a memory, it was only a-
She relaxed her head on his shoulder once more as the memory came to a close.
“Good enough,” he repeats, the syllables a solid reality, just like the man before him. And, in a sudden fit of realization, Draco realizes the epitome of his salvation.
“What do you say, Moony? Will you forgive us for becoming unregistered animagi?”
“Fuck,” he muttered to himself before approaching the desk. It felt odd being there, like he was intruding on something private. Regardless, Draco needed him. And sometimes the ends could very well justify the means.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up again, and he tried to glance anywhere but at the source. “S-sorry,” he muttered, but Draco’s figure held steady.
“Yes. Beneath the tree. Pettigrew told me himself, and the little rat knows better than to lie to me. Even when he isn’t shitting his pants in my presence.”
Harry couldn’t form words. He couldn’t speak or hardly think through the fog of embarrassment that flooded the area. All he knew was that they were spying on something far too private, and that they needed to leave- or look away- or something. But Draco, in all of his shock, had his eyes positively fixed on the couple before them. He was frozen to the spot, unable to glance away from what both intrigued and absolutely humiliated him.
Remus’s head was buried in a textbook; Sirius’s gaze was buried in Remus. Eventually, the young wolf realized that he wouldn’t be able to focus with his best friend boring into him. He glanced upward with a smile.
Blaise moved suavely across the circle to Pansy, who wrapped her arms around him exuberantly. It was clear that she was the type to put on a show if need be. She was the life of the party, and if it was fun, she was doing it. If she was forced to kiss her childhood best friend, it was going to be the hottest kiss any of them had ever witnessed.
They remained there, hands interlaced comfortably as the lighting suddenly dimmed. It was the same spot in the Gryffindor dormitory, but this time all of the beds appeared to be empty. All except one.
A chuckle from Remus, who was already buried beneath the sheets. “Where do you hang out every night?”
Sirius was Crying, hot tears streaming down his cheeks. His chest heaved with emotion and adrenaline. He’d acted purely on instinct and an in-depth knowledge that this would not end well for anyone involved.
When Remus Lupin changed, so did Draco’s outlook on... everything. Everything he’d ever questioned in the past was being brought to the forefront of his mind. Values, and feelings, and morals. Bedtime stories of the Dark Lord and rituals to be followed. Enemies and friends. Potter. His father and the rest of the Death Eaters. His mother, who blindly followed her sister’s footsteps. Potter. Regulus Black, who’d probably lost his brother for good because he couldn’t see past his family’s values. Values that were outdated and wrong. Potter. Pettigrew’s betrayal to his friends that they didn’t even realize was happening at this point in their journey. Potter. Sirius Black, who ran away from those values and started a new life for himself and his own opinion. A true leader. Potter. Remus Lupin, who deserved the world, being torn to pieces. Harry Potter. Sirius Black gazing at Lupin with eyes that held the pain of his transformation. Harry Potter. Sirius in love with Remus. Harry Potter. Sirius... in love with... Draco... in love... Harry.
And that would never change.
Sirius’s eyes were sharp with honesty and suddenly Remus couldn’t breathe. That familiar blush was creeping up his cheeks again, and he dared to lay down his quill to meet his stare.
Sirius, in all of his exuberance, continued to ponder what his own nickname would be.
He’d enjoy it. The mundane reality that was settling down with a witch. They’d have a bunch of red-headed spawns, and they’d have play dates with their cousins...
James peered at him from beneath his glasses questioningly.
Draco nodded wordlessly, eyes narrowed with resolute focus.
He’d called him gay, that was it. Why did that bother him so much? Was it just because it was Malfoy, or was it something much deeper?
Dumbledore remained perched at his desk, almost robotic. The world seemed stable enough, so Harry decided to keep looking. Where was Hermione when he needed her? She’d know exactly where to research this type of problem. And she’d show him, and then he’d fly in on the latest firebolt and save Draco from whatever reality he was stuck in.
“It’s just that he’s in love with you, mate.”
“To kicking arse. And not giving a fuck what anyone thinks.” He stole a glance at Sirius, who grinned warmly before placing his hand on top of Remus’s.
Silence. Peter’s eyes were wider than the moon outside; James’s brow was furrowed as he mulled the statement over.
“You don’t have to worry about that, Professor.”
Draco nodded, nervous and excited with anticipation. Harry held the door as they exited their London home and prepared to apparate to the night’s latest ministry function.
Surprisingly, Sirius grinned. His white teeth glinted from the moonlight, which was bright regardless of its phase.
Draco’s tongue lapped at Harry’s, and there was no denying how bad he wanted this. He opened his mouth, a perfect invitation, and they danced in sync, in perfect harmony. He wondered if Draco could feel his pulse, chest against chest, and if he was impressed by its rapid thrumming.
“I- uhm- oh my god- uhm- thank you.” Peter stumbled as he continued to work at his nail beds. “I don’t deserve you- any of you. I am so...”
“I’m sorry, Remus. It makes me so angry. How unfair everything is.”
Sirius smiled but gazed seriously into his eyes, brushing a honey curl from his face and tucking it behind his ear.
“I assume there will be no more disillusionment charms or tomfoolery tonight.” Professor Snape raised a brow as he passed them, but there was something considerably less contemptible about his tone. There was no smile, or pat on the back, but somehow Harry knew that something between them was different. Snape, and Harry, and Draco... they were all fighting for the same thing. And that meant more than words could bear.
The day they were married, Harry proposed a toast to his new husband. For his “undeniable courage against everything that threatened to destroy him during the war,” along with his “heart that is bigger than he will ever let on,” and his “dedication to what he believes is right, for all of the right reasons.” Ron, Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise were among the loudest of the applause. Draco was crying (from the onions in the hor d'oeuvres, of course).
He was buckled over, grasping his stomach as Harry caught his breath. A couple of coughs and pounds to his own chest brought the oxygen back, and Harry finally had a moment to notice that as Draco straightened up, his cheeks were pink.
“Oh, Darling, didn’t you know you learned from the best?” Pansy winked in his direction, her own physique loosening as he rested her chin in one hand.
“You are the epitome of all of the good things that have happened to Draco. You were the inspiration behind his most recent decision to abandon me. You represent love, and courage, and strength... all of those poor qualities I prefer not to discuss.”
“Come in, boys, I have your assignment prepared.” He smiled softly, an omniscient sign that belonged solely to Dumbledore. Harry breathed a sigh of relief at his apparent lack of anger. Perhaps detention wouldn’t be so bad, armed with the knowledge of Dumbledore’s forgiveness.
Harry pulled back, green eyes still vibrant against the dim lighting of the room. “I love you so damn much, Draco. Congratulations.”
Draco freezes, and he immediately understands the inner workings of Harry’s psyche.
Draco had almost immediately rejected- his first instinct was to scoff at any such attempts at pity. But Teddy’s eyes had met his, bright and foretelling- and his pleas almost melted Draco’s shoes to the asphalt.
Draco’s eyes never left his father, whose malicious glare was closer to complete Darkness than he refused to ever be.
Watching him profess his own feelings with the touch of his lips. They were fire, and Harry’s world was ablaze. There was no going back. Not now, not ever.
Harry watched a group of plastered teens tip toe down the corridors until they spotted Filch and Mrs. Norris patrolling the castle.
“Prophecies.” He answered curtly, but Lucius had already raised a finger in response.
An understanding look was shared between them and Draco nodded, determined. And suddenly, their world was shifting again.
Draco was fire, whipping and breathing with a passion so bright it could’ve been fury. But it wasn’t. It was burning hot red against the beast, lighting and catching until it was consumed by flames. Releasing the toxicity that seeped from every dark corner of its being. It growled, and scratched, and fought for redemption, but all that was left was Harry.
Draco did as he was told and scurried to another room to bide his time until company arrived.
Draco paused; Harry cocked his head. Damn, those Slytherins were cunning. Pansy’s objective and intricate line of thinking had flown right past Harry’s obvious line of thought. Draco pressed his lips into a hard line as he contemplated her words.
And then Luna (was she even an eighth year?) ended up with Ginny, and Dean with Seamus, and suddenly drunk Harry was wondering if Pansy was behind these matches or if this was one big coincidence.
Harry shook the thought from his mind and continued to observe the night.
It was simple, and to the point, and it revealed nothing about how he actually felt. If it weren’t for everything he’d witnessed and gone through with the bloke in detention recently, he would’ve been offended and went on his way.
Like a decision being made, a weight that fell harsh upon the see-saw, Draco recollected himself.
The call of “Black, Sirius!” Broke him from his stupor, and he noticed from the corner of his eye that Draco’s brow had furrowed in curiosity.
The blonde was visibly shaking across from him. “Don’t tell me to calm the fuck down! I have every right to be upset!” Another object from the living room table was pelted in his direction. For the second time that day, Harry hastily lunged downward.
“Not much different. No bruises this time, though.”
“What will your friends do when they find out you’ve betrayed them? That you’ve betrayed everything you’ve wanted for yourself? And what about your mother? She doesn’t want this for you. That much is fucking clear!”
The skies were a pallet of oranges and scarlets, reflecting against a grayish hue that marked their presence in a past memory.
“Looks like Gryffindor’s going to win.” Malfoy crossed his arms, casually observing the game.
Harry wept. He didn’t know why. All of the emotions he felt, every one of them was far too real to be a dream...
“Yeah, sure, but-“ Remus’s witty reply was cut short by his own sudden gasp and uncontrollable moan. His head his the pillow, an exasperated reaction to what Harry could only speculate was pleasure.
In the moment before he reached his hand to grip onto the Headmaster, Harry’s attention was snagged by the motion of Sirius and Remus in his peripheral vision. They were so happy, the way they held onto each other, alone and completely consumed by their feelings.
“And James is mad because Lily keeps rejecting his deer prongs for that book.”
“Why, that is part of the task, I’m afraid. Though I have no doubt that you will succeed, young Malfoy. It is, after all, in you and your family’s best interest to not fail.”
Finally finding it in him to move, he nodded wordlessly and grasped his hand to pull himself upward. He wiggled his toes, gaining his balance as they stopped once more.
“I- I can hang out with you guys again?”
It seemed to catch their attention simultaneously, and the boys separated to turn to the scene before them.
“I mean, don’t dish it if you can’t take it, fluffy.”
He feels himself fall, tumbling forward, and then the slam of the floor against his chest brings him back to reality. His eyes flash open, miraculously, to find that he’s facing the entrance to the Room of Requirement. The door is closing, and there’s a serpent, and the room is engulfed in flames…
When their eyes met, Harry couldn’t breathe. But behind the sincerity of Draco’s gaze was something more pressing.
“Since yesterday, apparently.” He answered, chuckling to himself. Pansy flashed them a knowing glance that didn’t go past Hermione. She eyed them curiously before continuing.
Harry scrunches his nose at the thought of plum pudding. Draco watches confusedly as Slughorn teeters away to Seamus and Dean’s boiling brew.
Why was it so simple for him to hit a nerve? Didn’t he have more self control than this? And what nerve had he hit, exactly?
“What is it, Ginny?” He asked innocently, though he should have known.
“Probably not. But, hey, people do crazy things when they’re in love.”
All in all, detention with Dumbledore was better than having his wand snapped. But being forced to spend an entire weekend alone with Malfoy... that was another situation entirely. And this was bound to be torture.
Why did that smile light up his insides like fireworks? And why did Harry like that it did that to him? Suddenly everything was so confusing yet clear.
It’s Draco Malfoy who calls him scarhead while packing his trunk for eighth year, only to be rebutted by Harry lifting his hair:  “IT’S NOT THERE ANYMORE!” And the coy response of “Okay, Scarhead,” fills the air between them.
Draco hadn’t had nearly enough time to process it, but Harry’s humor was a comforting and oddly placed beacon in the storm that would become their punishment. Obviously, something had gone right. Even if they were teetering on the edges of expulsion.
Because, what good would it do? Harry would probably just call him crazy again.
He blinked a third time, a weak attempt to ground himself through the adrenaline and when he opened his eyes, Draco was next to him. Reacting quite similarly.
Hardy nodded against the crook of his neck. “We’ll need some silencing charms.”
Teddy is spending the night at the Burrow, and Draco and Harry are doing their usual dance of washing and putting away the dishes.

“That’s right. I guess our rivalry died with Voldemort?”
“You still haven’t told me WHY I’m here. Did I get lost in a memory like Draco?”
“Reinervate.”
Now, she was turning to face the Slytherins. “I was just- they were- I’m only trying to do what’s right!” She huffed drastically, unsure of what to make of the unforeseen rejection.
“Do you think he ended up okay? Remus?”  It was Draco who’d finally dared to bring up what they’d just been pulled from.
“No, you idiot! Must I remind you that we’re not the best of friends? And I’m about to follow you Merlin knows where in the DARK-“ he started patting himself- “I don’t even have my WAND. Where is my wand, Potter?”
“I’m glad you got to come here, too, you know.” Remus’s eyes settled into a seriousness as they met Black’s face. “How are things at home?”
“That’s what you get for making fun of me,” Peter pouted.
Beside him stood Lily, whose eyes were bright with excitement.
“But if I’m dead, then that makes you dead, too!”
The wolf towered above them; its only match was Sirius’s large and gangly black paws. The difference between them was blatant enough. Sirius was a playful puppy; the wolf was a viscous dog.
There’s a silence that rattles Draco deep within his core. Because maybe he isn’t nothing. Maybe, to Harry, he could be everything.
“He told us about the Death Eaters,” Draco finished, meeting eyes with Potter before continuing. “And we came here.”
Unless, no, impossibly...
“So... do you wanna talk about it?” Pansy pressed facetiously, a humorous glint in her eye as she took a seat.
Potter came to the manor, dragged by Greyback and some others. His face was distorted, no doubt the work of some type of spell. He may have fooled the others, but Draco knew Harry. Every detail. The curve of his jawline, the shape of his forehead, the way his brows set above his now swollen eyes.
Draco reappeared, this time with his arms folded and standing before the fire. Harry’s breath caught. What was the time? Midnight?
It was when they went to celebrate their engagement with former Gryffindors and Slytherins that Harry hit the floor.
Behind them, Peter chewed his nails frantically.
And then, like the crash of an ocean wave,  Sirius Black pressed his lips to Remus Lupin’s. Remus was slammed with the chaotic swirl that was the incoming tide, And he never wanted it to stop. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
“Oh, so it’s ‘we’ with you two? I always knew Draco was a poof, but harry? I guess I expected more from the Chosen One.” He crossed his arms, wand still held firmly in his hand, and glared at the two with an amused smirk. He was far too confident, even if he was surrounded by armed members of their clan.
Regulus was heaving; tensions were rising. Draco was stiff next to Harry.
The shrieking shack was a sight for sore eyes as always, but it certainly seemed less threatening with Lupin and Black cuddling in the corner.
Now they’re both on the ground, Draco panting and Potter pointing his wand at the wound. “Reinervate!” He commands, but nothing happens.
The nagging in his gut softened. He felt a hand entangle with his own.
That was what he got, after all. Isn’t this what he deserved? For lacking the ability to keep the monster in check?
His palms are sweaty as the guilt settles, rotting a hole in his stomach. And then there’s a whisper, a subtle word that shifts everything:  “Draco.”
Harry didn’t answer, but the way his head fell, eyes scrunching shut as if to block out the pain... it was all the confirmation Draco needed. His throat croaked as another round of sobs escaped, and it was evident that Potter was no longer holding back. Draco paused, unable to think straight, his head swimming in everything that was Potter, so raw and open before him. His stomach swooped, the remains of the unhealed wound throbbing as Potter cried.
And suddenly, it was as if some unseen omnipotent being hit the play button. Like they were all puppets on a string, dancing at the snap of a finger or the flick of a wand.
Among them were Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zabini, along with a few others that Harry immediately recognized:  Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. There were others, perhaps older students that Harry hadn’t noticed before.
By the exasperated and sour look that crossed his face, Harry was sure the alcohol had burned on the way down.
All at once, he saw the face of Peter Pettigrew. The boy who longed for a taste of power; to feel like he was someone worth something. The insanity of his values and morals allowed him to vacate any possibility of friendship. He would betray anyone who came between him and the Dark Lord’s favor.
“Congratulations, Potter, you didn’t screw it up this time.”
“No one’s life is at risk except your own, if you don’t leave.” He pressed, very matter-of-fact.
Ron’s response was a shrug. “It’s quite obvious, really. You deserve to be happy, Harry, with all that we’ve been through in the past year.”
“I have far too much rebellion to ensue before signing up for quidditch, brother.”
It was also evident that Remus Lupin loved him anyway. He rested his head on Sirius’s shoulder, and he began running his hand through Remus’s honey curls in response.
“Oh, shut up.” Harry insulted flippantly, grasping the sides of his head and pulling him insatiably forward for a kiss.
Harry’s grin was still taut as he wrapped a possessive arm around the small of Draco’s back.
His chest clenched with worry; a tightness that threatened to suffocate him as it gripped his organs and squeezed. Desperation overwhelmed him, a feeling of dread like no other trickled from his head to his toes. Adrenaline courses through his veins as he glanced around repeatedly, trying to find a solution to a problem that was a moment’s past.
Peter was still nowhere to be found.
“Wait, Potter! Where are you going?”
He doesn’t move, and the stillness is what allows him to feel the sporadic twitches that begin to ripple through Harry’s body.
“Of course you will.”
Sirius’s mouth was fierce and passionate against his own. Remus thought he might die, right then and there; the only thing convincing him otherwise was the rapid racing of his pulse in each ear.
He slowly closed his lips around Draco’s, thin and smooth between his own. His pull loosened to a gentle caress of his lower back. They briefly separated, mere centimeters hollow between them before their lips met softly again. This kiss was a gentle promise, a delicate reflection of the butterflies that now replaced each ravenous flame. Draco kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him again in a succession that matched the reeling of Harry’s senses.
From the corner of the grounds came another group of students looking far less carefree as they approached the crowds.
“I have it on good authority that one of your friends has a secret. And I know exactly what he’s hiding.” Lucius Malfoy’s teeth formed a malicious grin that had Harry’s skin crawling.
He turned around to face Harry, who held his mouth agape at what he saw. It was Lucius Malfoy in all respects... except his eyes. They were complete pools of darkness, from sclera to Iris. No color remained except the pitch black that seemed to consume him, running down below his eye sockets as if someone had ripped them out clean.
It was one of those infinite moments that Harry knew would remain alive forever, if only in a memory.
Harry smiled. “Prat.”
“When I fired the killing curse at you that evening, and I was temporarily overcome by the magnificent Harry Potter... the curse rebounded. And in that moment, a piece of me... belonged to you.”
“We are NOT friends, Potter.”
“Thanks, Evans. You’re not so bad yourself.” She grinned at his remark, and Remus extended a hand toward the center of the group.
“Snape tipped us off that the Death Eaters had intruded. When Theo was nowhere to be found, we put two and two together.” He shared a knowing glance with Pansy. “While He was sending the rest of Slytherin to meet McGonnagal in the Great Hall, we went looking for you.”
And if he did, would it be salient that he lacked any interest at all in their physique? Would the entire world know the secret that only he and Pansy had shared?
He meant for that to sting, or perhaps to be a playful joke. He meant for a lot of things. but what he absolutely had never planned on in a thousand years was that statement coming across as a full on flirtation.
“I don’t need help, Lily.” The words dripped like poison from Snape’s mouth, a cold and uncaring break of their friendship.
It was extremely vulnerable, the number of times Draco had allowed the f-word to escape his frustrated lips. At one point he’d thrown his wand at Potter, who’d suggested he just needed to “think happier.”
“Hey guys,” he spoke, tilting his head upwArd with intent. “What do you say we make this boring soirée a little bit fun?”
“I hate to say it, but the only one of them stupid enough to risk his life for Lupin is your brother, Black.”
“Rules are Rules, my friend.”
Harry stared confusedly as Draco approached, so close to the door that he could push Harry through if he wanted to. That’s when his pivoted, green eyes meeting gray.
Several things seemed to happen simultaneously. At once, James and Sirius had their wands drawn and pointed directly at Snape.
In a fit of spontaneity, he took the bottle from Blaise and downed a much larger gulp than he intended.
Draco had never seen a spell so powerful that wasn’t dark. It hit each of the Death Eaters with a force that threw them backwards several feet.
“Did they just-“ Draco continued, and Harry nodded with a grin, momentarily forgetting that they were only in a memory.
When they were in closed quarters, Sirius turned to a bashful Remus. “Okay, Rem. With the full moon coming tomorrow, this is the perfect time to show you what we’ve been working on.”
“Don’t wait too long, mate. You know Pomfrey will be here soon.”
“Fine.” Peter grunted, standing up. “I’m going to get another butter beer. Need one?”
Before long, the rest of the Gryffindors erupted into applause. Harry heard Draco gulp beside him as Sirius joined his father at the table.
Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever stop smiling again. It would be a very Happy Christmas, indeed.
“What are you- how dare you point your wands at Severus! What has he ever done to you? You guys are just being bullies at this point!”
