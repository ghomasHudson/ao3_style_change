Tom’s face reddened further, visible despite his prominent scowl. Who could grill panini bread now, huh?
“Harry! What’s up? I got your text and came as soon as I could! Are you okay?” Hermione gasped, out of breath.
“The only thing telling him would make him do is get me locked up in his secret dungeon. He probably has a giant snake down there that he would feed me to.”
“Oh, well, you know. I had to get my daily caffeine fix and this place just so happened to be in the area.”
“I didn’t choose the comedian life, it chose me,” Harry nodded. “Did you know I called Draco Ellen DeGeneres once? It’s up there in my Top 5 Roasts.”
“Well, no, because Dumbledore is a geezer,” Harry huffed. “But there’s one visiting from out of town! It’s one of those, y’know, traveling ones.”
Harry hummed noncommittedly, still confused, but filing the actions away as Sirius’s usual strange antics.
To be fair, Harry supposed, Tom often acted like he was seventy years old rather than seventeen. He vaguely recalled Tom complaining about ‘kids these days’ when discussing the first-year students.
Well, Draco was a bit okay. After he got over the whole... internalized homophobia thing. Soon he'd be helping bring down capitalism like the rest of the gays.
“I’m not surprised. Every one of your dormmates seems to be lacking in not only decorum, but common sense as well. Did Weasley attempt to use chocolate syrup as ink again?” Draco sneered.
lmao no i was in bio club in my old school so i just rushed thru it no biggie. anyways i sent u the doc so feel free to write the intro and conc whenever
“A dancer never truly forgets his moves,” Harry said wisely, closing his eyes and nodding. “We can start training… tomorrow! After school.”
The shop was relatively empty; for some reason it was never too busy around the time Harry came in. No, that’s not right, Harry knew the reason why... Fate. The gods were blessing Harry so he could have beautiful alone time with Cedric.
Tom’s cheeks lightly flushed. “I’m not. I’m just questioning the purity of your intentions towards me.”
“They said I could have a room if I changed my application to say female, but my dad and I told them to go fuck themselves,” Blaise’s eyes hardened. “I finally came out to my parents just a few years ago, I sure as hell wasn’t going back in just to live with the snakes,” he sneered.
He thought that he was already ahead of the game, knowing fancy French words like ‘bonsoir’ and ‘merci beaucoup.’ Little did he know that
After Tom asked Harry how much French he currently knew and was met with a stuttered ‘b-bonsoir,’ however, everything went downhill.
Then again, Sirius’s guilt had its uses—particularly in how Harry managed to convince him to complete his homework from time to time. Given that he was currently forcing Sirius to do the research for his essay in McGonagall’s class, he decided to spare him and not ask him for French help as well.
are you ridiculously attractive, but then I find out you’re also kind, and hard-working, and painstakingly genuine. You go out of your way to hold the door open for old grannies!”
Harry sipped his Sprite quietly, still tired from the dance routine, glancing over at Sirius occasionally.
anyways as an apology, here's a double update with two new characters!! hope you enjoy, and I will look forward to seeing all you lovely new and familiar faces in the comments!
Sirius couldn’t breathe for a few seconds, slightly losing sanity and forgetting basic motor functions.
Later, when the two of them lied side-by-side on Draco’s bed, ignoring the puffy redness of Draco’s eyes, Harry smiled.
After pulling himself together and managing a shaky introduction, Harry prepared himself to completely embarrass himself in front of the boy by demonstrating his failure in French.
“I just think, yeah, if I’m going to be your boyfriend for the day, we might as well make a proper date of it.”
“Yeah!” Harry grinned, excited. “What’s first? Actually, I never asked, what kind of dance do you know?”
“Yes, I’m well aware I’m not actually the man of your dreams, Siri,” Harry spat out, angrily. “We went over this a couple of months ago, remember? When you broke my heart but somehow ended up crying all over my shirt?”
Draco looked so honest, so hopeful and helpless all at once, that Harry couldn’t stop himself from giving him a little kiss on his lips. Just a peck.
Sirius immediately wrapped his arms around Harry and sobbed into his shoulder. Patting his back and being squeezed to the point of barely being able to breathe, Harry wondered if it was a superpower of his to solve all conflicts with his cuddles.
“Oh, well, your dad is a bit of a, what do the kids call them, a boomer? He’s a bit slow on the uptake, but I’ll make sure to turn him around. Just take anything he says with a grain of salt.”
“On the other hand, it’s taught me quite a lot about bondage techniques, so if you’re ever interested…” Blaise trailed off with a wink. A
Harry didn’t quite know what to feel. He found it was easier, in fact, to try not to feel anything at all. It wasn’t that he was
“Draco, I’ve cradled you in my bosom while you sobbed your eyes out; I think you can call me Harry by now.”
The Gryffindor printer was not, of course, actually broken. Hermione made sure that everyone was well-informed of proper machine usage the first day they were assigned to their dorms. When Harry was sitting on Draco’s bed, naked from the waist up, waiting for the blonde boy to grab him a spare shirt because he ‘accidentally’ spilled his water bottle all over his front, however, Harry knew his plan was a success.
Oh. Oh! It seemed that Operation Coffee Shop Romance was succeeded at a much faster rate that Harry anticipated.
Blaise opened his mouth to say more, but no words came out. Harry simply smiled encouragingly and waited patiently.
“As much as it pains me to be around you, Potter, I regret to inform you that Professor Snape assigned us as lab partners.”
Harry beamed, Draco flushed a beautiful shade of red, and even the bitter taste of Americano couldn’t wipe away the taste of Draco’s soft lips.
When they sat down, Draco seemed to be hesitant about something, so Harry kicked him under the table until he got it out.
“Hey,” Harry admonished. “Having a tutor doesn’t make you an idiot. There’s no shame in getting help.”
with Sirius or anything, or even that they had made any serious commitments to each other. It’s just that no-one quite liked finding out they were only being flirted with as a replacement for someone’s straight best friend.
‘I’m such a shoujo protagonist,’ Harry thought, before performing his wildly interpretive dance to Shakira’s Hips Don’t Lie. After he was done, Lily clapped loudly with excitement and joy, while everyone else clapped slowly in second-hand embarrassment. Stepping off the stage, he looked up to see Tom coming towards him, mouth poised to speak, before Sirius slid in front of him and took Harry in his arms.
Harry frowned, closing his textbooks. “What’s wrong? You can tell me, Blaise. I’m a very good confidant.”
Harry’s eyes lit up. He quickly knocked Sirius down, who was currently sitting on the bed, and straddled his lap. “You can dance, Siri?!” he said excitedly.
It was when Sirius started hanging out in his dorm room more often, when he started hugging Harry like he never wanted to let go, that he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Stop! Don’t say anything. I’m moving booths.” Harry got up, slamming his palms on the table in front of him, and started looking for another seat. He would let the blonde prick stew in his embarrassment at having a dubiously lesbian looking haircut and wouldn’t grant him the satisfaction of thinking of a comeback. While most of the train was already moderately filled up, he spotted a girl sitting alone at the very back, immersed in a book. Harry quickly made his way over to her and plopped down across from her seat, placing his bag under the table.
,” Blaise groaned, smashing his head against the desk for the nth time. Class had ended a few hours ago, but since Blaise was struggling a bit, they decided to finish it up together at their dorm room later that evening. Their progress was… minimal.
By this point, Harry had simply accepted the fact that he was most likely a masochist and was smitten with Tom even though he was a slave driver. The thought of losing their triweekly sessions was too much to bear, especially given that Tom was not only in a different grade, but also in a different dorm house (Slytherin, obviously), so their contact would become non-existent.
“But now I see it in an endearing way,” Tom finished calmly. “The fact of the matter still stands, however, that I feel… uncomfortable forming strong relations when I don’t know what my future holds.”
Tom looked at Harry, then, sanctimonious façade melting and being replaced with a hesitant warmth and adoration. “Do you think I could… kiss you? Just for today?”
“Mmh?” Harry got out, which was surprisingly literate considering his brain was melting at hearing Tom say his name.
Speaking of beautiful alone time, Cedric was making his way over to Harry’s table after the only other customer had left. He sat down in the chair across from him and grinned.
Harry froze. This wasn’t exactly in the plan. Harry considered himself quite good at being suave, but as the response he usually got to his saucy lines was laughter, he didn’t actually know what to do when someone else instigated the flirting.
“What? No! How do you know I have a crush on Tom Riddle?” Harry gasped. “Also, he isn’t a serial killer!”
Forcibly pushing Sirius away, Harry came face to face with a look of hurt that squeezed Harry’s heart.
“You know, in the first place, you’re not doing it hairily either. You’re one of the most unhairy men I know,” Sirius pointed out, glancing at his exposed legs. Harry wore his cute booty shorts for the occasion.
“A lipid is a macrobiomolecule that is soluble in nonpolar solvents,” Harry recited dutifully from the text. He felt a bit like Hermione.
Harry tightened his arms and let Draco’s head fall on his shoulder. Slowly, Draco brought his hands up behind Harry’s back and returned the hug. If his shoulder felt suspiciously wet from Draco’s tears, no one would be none the wiser.
Draco seemed dubious, but agreed nonetheless. Because he was secretly in love with Harry, obviously. Harry, keeping this knowledge to himself so as to not embarrass Draco, led him to the local café. He promptly ordered an Americano. Because Harry was Cool™ and Seductive™ and drank his coffee black. Draco, on the other hand, ordered a vanilla latte.
“It’s what my uncle used to say, you know. Before he beat me. I used to pretend I was straight so he wouldn’t lock me in the cupboard.”
“Yes, I’m sure you’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Harry mumbled. “Might as well have you call me Prongs while I’m at it.”
“Yes. I was about to complain to her, actually, given that you have had a considerable lack of progress despite our numerous sessions. Imagine my surprise, however, when before I could even say a word, the teacher promptly gave me a hug and called me a miracle worker.”
Now, Harry did not see his roommate very often. Whenever Harry was in his dorm room, the other boy was either sleeping or off gallivanting who knows where. Harry saw him sometimes in the library reading up on serial killers. Serial killers! As such, Harry speculated that the boy was likely planning a murder and tended to stay away from him.
“Don’t tease me!” Cedric harrumphed. “You could’ve liked the bad boy type, or something. And I bet you’re all popular at school, too!”
Draco knocked and gripped Harry’s hand so hard he had to hide a grimace. Draco looked relieved when his mother came out to greet him.
Harry blushed and scowled. Confessing how attractive he found the man seemed like a good idea at the time, when he was lying on the ground and staring at perfection incarnate, but now Cedric never failed to tease him about it.
“So…” Cedric said hesitantly, wringing his hands together. “Does this mean I can get your number, then?”
“’Oh’, indeed. Did you know, Harry, that you have not been getting 80s in class at all? In fact, you have been consistently getting scores of 95 and above.”
Harry bit his lip. He sat down on his bed and patted the space beside him. When Harry looked up at the boy who gently sat down next to him, when he saw Sirius’s warm smile and concerned eyes and felt his heart flutter at the sight of him, he wondered if it wouldn’t be okay to pretend. To play along with Sirius and maybe eventually have him fall in love with Harry instead of James.
Harry stuck his tongue out and let himself be spun around by Sirius. They danced like that for a while—Sirius teaching him basic rhythm and tempo as they went. Harry felt warm, being held in Sirius’s arms as they moved across the floor. The songs were fast at first, Harry being spun around in circles and thrown back against Sirius’s arm, but eventually they switched to Harry’s ‘Delicate Vibes (sunflower emoji)’ playlist and Harry rested his head against Sirius’s chest as they gently moved to the music. Sirius’s neck was slightly sweaty from their exercise and Harry could feel the warm moisture on the tip of his nose. He found himself blushing as he realized just how tall Sirius was, with Harry’s head resting just under his chin.
“I—God, I’ve been in love with him since we were kids, you know? And I always somehow thought that we’d end up together but then he met Lily and I just—I knew he wouldn’t feel the same way about me. And then I saw your video and all I could think about was how much you looked like James. And you had that cute little rainbow pin in your hair and I thought maybe I’d actually have a chance.”
“Look, Pads. I know you’re in love with James,” he saw Sirius open his mouth in protest but quickly cut him off. “No, shh, look, you don’t have to argue. I’m not blind. I can hear the tiny violin playing whenever you mope over him and Lily going off on their midnight rendezvous.”
“Oh,” Harry relaxed slightly. He liked the FBI; he watched a lot of Criminal Minds. Spencer Reid… Mm… “So, you’re not planning on killing anyone?”
The first time Harry met Tom was when the teacher introduced his new tutor. Upon seeing him, Harry choked on his spit and his entire English vocabulary flew out the window. Which was brilliant, really, considering it probably led Tom to believe that Harry was not only hopeless in French, but in his native language as well.
Harry was absolutely terrible at French. He signed up for it thinking it would be a powerful asset to add to his seduction arsenal; he would walk up to cute boys and whisper French nothings into their ears. This master plan was greatly flawed, however, in that Harry apparently underestimated how difficult it would be to learn.
“Sure,” Blaise smirked. “I don’t trust him. I actually do a lot of reading on serial killers; it’s a hobby of mine. And he definitely gives me bad vibes.”
Clearing his throat, the boy found his voice and continued. “They kicked me out ‘cause I signed up to stay in a boy’s room, but apparently… Slytherin doesn’t allow trans boys to stay with other boys…” He shrugged. “But then they also don’t also them to stay with girls, ‘cause they identify as male. So it was kind of a lose-lose situation.”
“Oh, you’re right! Thank you, Siri! I’m going now, everyone!” Harry quickly gave everyone a hug and rushed over to the stage, noticing out of the corner of his eye Sirius and Tom exchanging death glares.
Harry looked back and promptly saw Draco running towards him. Shoving the rest of his books in his locker, Harry turned to him with a raised eyebrow (courtesy of Tom Riddle).
“Blaise, what’s up?” Harry asked, noticing his discomfort. “Is it about Draco, do you not like him or something? I know he’s a bit of a prick, but he’s working on it. He bought me a muffin the other day, isn’t that sweet?”
“Clearly because you recognize my advanced level seduction skills. I could write my own WikiHow. Anyways, you didn’t answer my question!” Harry said, wagging his finger menacingly.
Nobody could blame Harry for spending hours trying to pick out an outfit, only to call Hermione in the middle of the night and have her sneak into his dorm room to help him. He was lucky his roommate was a heavy sleeper.
“I can use the internet too,” Tom hissed out angrily. “I know all about your kind. With your—your Tik Toks and Grindrs.”
Luckily, the language branch had a convenient tutoring system in which the older students taking higher levels of the class could help the younger ones who were struggling. Harry was most certainly struggling.
As such, Harry’s brilliant idea was to lie about his test scores to Tom. Having to complete fifteen pages of French work every once in a while was a small price to pay in order to keep hearing Tom’s velvety voice insult him. Tom particularly enjoyed cursing him out in French, which was… strangely arousing.
Harry attempted to sound aloof, but with Sirius’s presence drawing out all the air from his lungs, he sounded a bit more desperate than he would have liked.
“It might be scary for you,” Tom harrumphed. “I won’t be phased by something as silly as a children’s ride.”
They decided to end the day on the Ferris-wheel because Harry insisted it would be romantic. They sat on opposite sides until Harry determinedly stood up and sat right next to Tom, snuggling into his side. Tom coughed and wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder. Both of them were flushed red. Panini bread for days.
Harry arrived a bit early, wanting to secure his desired seat on the train, but soon students began filing into the train. He was pleasantly surprised when the first person to sit in his booth was an adorable blonde boy whose entire being screamed ‘posh twink.’ Harry, having made it a goal to become known as a homosexual sex god during high school, was excited at the chance to secure his first conquest via his superior seduction skills. However, just as Harry opened his mouth to woo the boy with his sexy pick-up lines, the blonde twink spoke.
Draco (clearly seduced by his award-winning smile, Harry thought) furrowed his eyebrows and frowned.
“You two are getting along too well lately,” Snape said. “I don’t like it. You come here to learn, not to have fun.”
Harry gaped, wide-eyed. Then, he jumped onto the bed with Hermione and hugged her with all his might.
When Draco reluctantly did so, Harry immediately saved his contact as ‘Posh Twink’ and sent him a winky face. Draco glanced at his phone, frowned, and left him on read.
“No-o. I was just wondering if you wouldn’t mind letting me use the Slytherin printer? The one on the Gryffindor floor is broken.”
Harry nodded silently and they sat on the floor, backs resting against the wall, eagerly drinking up the water Harry pulled out. Harry was nestled in the nook of Sirius’s arm, both of them reluctant to part. Harry found himself remembering the easy comfort they found in each other’s bodies back when they were ‘dating.’ They had not been in such close contact since Harry confronted Sirius about his feelings, and he forgot just how much he missed being engulfed by the man’s body. Harry nuzzled into Sirius’s torso, deciding to savor the moment while he could.
Cedric snickered and locked eyes with Harry. “Well, if he ever does plot your demise, you should give me a call. I’ll help you fight him off. You take the tutor and I’ll take the giant snake.”
There weren’t actually many tangible differences between the dorm houses, but because the Slytherin one was a bit more expensive to live in, all the posh families tended to send their kids there. And everyone knew the bourgeoisie
Blaise shook his head. “It’s not about Draco. It’s just that…” Blaise broke off, biting his lip harshly.
“Shut up,” he muttered while finally backing away from Harry. He sat down on the bed while Harry tried to get his thoughts in order.
Everyone came to see Harry’s audition, including, much to everyone’s surprise, Tom Riddle. Harry practically leaped with joy upon seeing him and promptly rushed into his chest.
i am particularly grateful to those of you who asked about updates because you convinced my lazy ass to actually write another chapter
“I can’t date you now, as much as I want to. And I won’t ask you to wait for me,” Tom said firmly. “
“I’m sorry. God, Harry, I really am sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking. I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea in the first place. You can punch me if you want; I deserve it.”
Who was this? Where was the boy who sadistically bullied Harry into being good at French? Is a crop top all it takes to seduce the devil?
From then on, Sirius seemed to jump at the opportunity to embarrass Harry any chance he got. He would ruffle his hair as he passed by him in the dining hall and would blow in his ears as he snuck up on him from behind in the common room. As Sirius was a year above, they didn’t have any classes together, which Harry supposed was a small blessing because his fragile maiden heart could only take so much.
Harry smirked. He glanced at Draco, whose cheeks were burning red and who was desperately attempting to avoid looking at Harry.
“You don’t want to see my search history, Sirius, it would scar even the bravest of warriors,” Harry said solemnly, shaking his head.
Harry, who in the course of his life had read plenty of fanfics, knew exactly what Draco was saying and needed no further explanation.
“Alright there, boomer, calm down. You’re a whole two years older than me, Tom, it’s not that much,” he got out grumpily while blushing.
“You know I only have chocolate milk in the mornings,” Harry scoffed.  “Why would I need Viagra, anyways, when I have your sweet bod to look at?”
“Yes, that—that makes sense. I suppose I’ll just be going then,” Harry frowned, attempting to gather both his things and the remains of his dignity.
Harry, although not a particularly good actor, thought that he was doing a pretty good job of convincing Tom he still sucked at French. It wasn’t particularly hard to do, considering the part about getting distracted by Tom’s hands every five minutes during their sessions wasn’t exactly an act.
It took a couple of weeks for Tom to break. They had tutoring sessions three times a week, forty-five minutes each. For the first few sessions, Tom was still the epitome of gentle and patient—the perfect honor student.
the issue, i think, is that time is slowly slipping from my grasp. one day it's october, then suddenly it's 2021 and mr president is getting impeached 2.0. it's like when you read a fanfiction and it's slow paced but they also skip a lot of scenes so then you're like 'huh, did i miss something?' except instead of fanfiction it's real life and what i'm missing is my youth
Harry couldn’t say he expected to be joined at the hip with Draco after that, but it was still a bit disappointing when the boy continued ignoring him in public. He understood, of course, that Draco couldn’t risk his father finding out from one of his schoolmates that he’s been associating with ‘the gays,’ but Harry felt a slight pain in his heart nonetheless.
Harry grabbed Draco’s hand firmly, beamed, and led him to the Malfoy Manor. When they reached the house, Harry whistled loudly.
The heartache was still there, but it was a bit pleasant. He felt sated and bittersweet in a way that he thought quite suited the idea of the Sirius Black Experience.
“I just… did I ever apologize to you, Harry? For the things I said when we first met?” Draco whispered remorsefully.
It was all worth it, however, when Tom immediately blushed upon seeing Harry in the tightest skinny jeans he owned paired with a loose crop top that hung off his shoulders. And his signature rainbow heart hair pin, of course.
Tea was a very pleasant affair. Draco’s father seemed a bit shocked at finding out his son was gay, but after being properly chastised by Harry for his poor behavior and offensive language, he seemed to appear properly regretful and promised Draco he would love him no matter what.
Harry faltered a bit and blushed, glancing up shyly at Cedric. “You mean it? You’re… interested? Even though I’ve been kind of stalkerish?”
Tom Riddle, upon first glance, was extremely polite. Even throughout Harry’s stumbled introduction, he smiled gently and gave him comforting glances. Harry’s heart fluttered at the boy’s kindness.
whether Harry's playlist is called 'Delicate Vibes' with a sunflower emoji or 'Delicate Vibes' with (sunflower emoji) typed out is up to interpretation
Blaise gave Harry a pat on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, Harry. If you become a mafia wife, I can use my FBI connections to keep you safe.”
He was just about to leave Tom’s room in a rush when he was stopped by the other boy calling his name.
Tom opened his mouth to reply, only to break off in a scream as the next drop came. Harry practically choked laughing hysterically until the ride came to a stop.
“Right, well, now that we’ve gotten all that sorted out, maybe we should get back to tutoring?” Harry said diplomatically, firmly shoving his embarrassment inside the Things We Do Not Talk About section of his mind.
Harry remembered the way Tom’s demeanor changed from kind to murderous in the span of less than a second. His eyes became so cold, Harry could almost feel frostbite.
“Oh, I was waiting for you to ask!” Harry said excitedly, rushing over to his messenger bag and taking out a slightly wrinkled piece of paper, advertising the dance troupe’s upcoming performance. Harry shoved the paper in Sirius’s face, eyes sparkling.
“You look nice, Tom!” Harry said once Tom simply stared at him and seemed to be at a loss for words.
“Shit, I’m so sorry!” Harry cried out, quickly using his own sleeve to attempt to wipe down Sirius’s chest. “Are you okay?”
“You know, Harry, I was having a talk with our French teacher the other day about your progress,” Tom murmured in his deceptively lovely voice.
Cedric pouted. Harry closed his eyes to protect himself from the cuteness. How could someone be such a hunk while also being so adorable?
“Of course…” Harry nodded gravely. “After all, you can’t break me out of jail if Professor Snape kills you first. Did you see the glare he gave Neville when he didn't know what an amino acid was?”
This was, of course, where the issue stemmed from. It was entirely impossible to focus when Tom was tutoring him when he could be staring at his lips instead. Those lips…
Hell yeah, a witty comeback! Harry mentally high-fived himself inside his head. He glanced at the boy, who was clearly attempting to look intimidating by raising a sassy eyebrow, and noticed that he looked quite cute when blushing, even when out of anger. Before the boy could get out what was no doubt another ridiculously offensive remark, Harry put his hand up and shushed him.
Before they arrived back at school, Harry convinced Draco to stop by the nearby coffee shop with him.
“You know, Potter, given how clumsy you are, I’m honestly surprised you haven’t offed yourself yet. A man can only dream, I suppose.”
“Stop being so—attractive,” Harry sighed. “It’s bad for my heart. I have very delicate sensibilities.”
If someone asked Harry why he was currently being slammed against the wall by Tom Riddle, he would not be able to answer because his heart was internally combusting. His face was a
“Oh, Cedric… You’re such a dream-boy,” Harry sighed, clasping one of Cedric’s hands in both of his own. “You can have my number. You can have my babies, too."
Tom Riddle, two years his senior, was the most attractive person Harry ever met. Yes, even more so than Sirius or Draco. While Sirius had a sort of rugged charm and Draco had an elegant sort of beauty, Tom Riddle could only be described as
“I’m a changed man, Draco. I’ve felt the turmoil of love and heartbreak. I’ve felt my heart fracture and stitched it up with my very own hands. I have taken control of my own destiny.”
It started with Tom being a jerk and asking Harry to buy him some coffee. Like, excuse him? He’s going to confess to Harry one day on a ferris wheel like the cliché he is, and then he’s going to make him get him coffee? If this was Tom’s idea of romance, he sucked at it.
It was comfortable, lying in the silence with Draco. He could hear every breath the blonde took, could see it in the way his chest rose and fell rhythmically.
“Well, I’ll be off! I just wanted to give you guys a sneak peek of my moves before I join the troupe!”
Catching Snape’s glare from across the room, Harry cleared his throat and got out his notes. “Right, so… lab project?”
“Tom, stop, you’re going to make me cry,” Harry laughed. “That’s just Snapchat! You’re only two years older than me, why do you sound like my uncle trying to use his Kindle?”
Harry could see Sirius was about to refuse, so he quickly got out his puppy eyes and pout. No one could resist the puppy eyes and pout.
“Alright, well, we’re lab partners for today,” Harry said, deciding that at the very least, he would try and act amicable. That way, if Blaise
“Harry,” Sirius cooed out, eyes narrowed and voice tinted with faux kindness, “you’re going to be late.”
Draco gave him a shaky nod and led him to the door. Before he could leave, Draco squeezed his arm and cleared his throat.
“Perfect! You can teach me!” Harry announced, smiling smugly when he noticed Sirius’s slight blush. Was he embarrassed by knowing how to dance, or by him sitting in his lap, Harry wondered? Definitely the latter, Harry knew just how good his ass looked in those tights. He squirmed around a bit while Sirius just coughed, flushing.
“Oh, what happened to my sweet, innocent, and pure Harry?” Sirius lamented, twirling Harry around. “I always thought
Cedric shrugged. “You’re cute. I like how you come in every day just to see me and pretend like you’re here for the coffee. And the way you glance up at me over the top of your mug when you think I’m not paying attention.”
Draco swiftly turned away and started walking towards his dormitory, but when he stopped and glanced back before continuing on, Harry grinned and followed after him.
“Oh,” the girl’s eyebrows furrowed. “That’s good! I’m straight myself, but I was a proud member of the GSA club at my old school. I’m very much a believer of the gay rights movement.” The girl gave Harry a small, shy smile.
“Harry, what the literal fuck are you doing?” James exclaimed, something all the Marauders were currently wondering. The boys and Lily were sitting around in Remus’s dorm room when Harry burst through the door, wearing yoga pants and a headband (rainbow-colored, of course), and started twirling around haphazardly.
But it was all worth it because as soon as Harry walked into that coffee shop, he was blinded by the glory of Beautiful Barista™. Delicate brown locks, rosy lips widening into a heart-melting smile to welcome Harry in… Harry managed to catch the name tag on the barista’s chest before collapsing to the ground with a hand to his chest.
“Brilliant. Did you know I’m gay?” Shit, Harry thought, was that too blunt? Maybe he should have talked a bit more about books first. To be perfectly honest, he couldn’t care less about Dostoyevsky, but he could certainly try.
“A fake boyfriend, obviously! Get that look off your face, Harry. I mean like—for pretend. So my dad doesn’t think I’m lying or whatever.”
as long as the first letter is the same it counts as a nickname srry not srry i didn’t make the rules
“Yeah? Well, Dance 101 is stupid. I’m skipping to Dance 501,” Harry grumbled. Sirius just pushed his back further until Harry begged for mercy.
Oh no! Harry was most certainly not expecting to deal with a homophobe right off the bat. He had certainly known he would come across bumps in his homosexual agenda, but it was a bit disheartening to see it happen so soon. Nonetheless, Harry would not be discouraged. He remembered the WikiHow articles he had bookmarked on what to do when encountering douches: stay calm and don’t antagonize them. Harry took a deep breath in and stayed rational.
“My vlog! You know, that one where I post videos of me doing stupid shit and sometimes you show up and anyways Sirius Black found it!”
“Let’s—let’s get started on dancing. I mean, there’s not much we can do in a couple of days, but you can get the foundations down, yeah?”
“Don’t look so smug!” Harry cried. “This just means more competition for you, so shouldn’t you be more upset?!”
Harry frowned in sympathy, “I don’t think you can drop biology, Blaise, I’m sorry. It’s a core class.”
“Boo,” Harry pouted. “It’s not my fault. Malfoy’s in that class! As if I could focus on history when I could stare at his luscious locks instead.”
Harry choked on his coffee. “Excuse me?! I wear a dorky rainbow heart pin in my hair and you think I’m
Blaise chuckled, “Yeah, you’re right. Well, maybe we can get to know each other now?” At that, Blaise smiled suavely and winked.
“Unfortunately, Harry, I find little reason to continue our sessions given that you are already excelling in class,” Tom said, still smiling.
“There’s no way anyone wouldn’t be scared on this—this—death contraption!” Tom exclaimed angrily as the two of then stumbled out of the ride.
Cedric rubbed the back of his head bashfully and gave a shy little smile. “I was kind of trying to woo you, actually. Y’know, like, ‘give me a call?’ And then you’d be like, ‘Oh, but I don’t have your number,’ and I’d casually write it down like, ‘Well, you do now,’ or um, something like that.”
Tom huffed. “I would appreciate it if you didn’t share stories of your conquests in front of me, however. I am a jealous man by nature.”
“You don’t get it at all, Hoom. Texting solidifies friendships. Also, what did you get for the second question?”
“Perhaps we should rest now, hm?” Sirius whispered after the music ended, seemingly just as caught up in the mood as Harry and unwilling to break the gentle quiet of their breathing.
“Blaise…” Harry consoled, giving his shoulder a comforting squeeze. “You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to, but just know you
“You can talk to me about it, you know,” Harry whispered. “You don’t have to tell your family if you don’t want to, but you can tell me. I’ll always listen if you need it.”
, if, when the time comes that I feel secure in where I am, you and I are still in contact and still feel…
“What I liked best, of course,” Sirius interrupted, leaning towards Harry, “was getting to see you shirtless.”
Harry had a tutoring session with Tom that day, but he supposed ditching it wouldn’t be so bad. Tom deserved to get ego-check anyways.
Harry’s mouth shaped into an ‘o’ of realization. “Oh! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you by making fun of Slytherin, I just—”
“Oh yes yes, snakes are better, blah blah, I get it. Can I use your printer or not? It’s for the lab.”
“It’s not that,” Blaise interrupted, giving Harry a reassuring smile, though it was a bit strained. “It’s just that… they kicked me out of the dorms just a few days before the first semester started, and my parents had to rush to get me an available dorm room. I’m lucky Gryffindor had one left, otherwise I might not have gotten to attend Hogwarts at all. I guess I’m just still a bit bitter.”
“In the first place, there’s nothing wrong with the circus, it’s a very respectable—ow, ow, OW! Sirius, it hurts! It hurts!” Harry whined as his back was pushed towards the ground.
“BAM!” Harry yelled, dropping to the floor and whipping his short hair around as diva-like as possible.
The tutoring sessions took place in Tom’s room. Tom’s personal, private room, of course, because as a prefect he apparently got his own bedroom. Which meant that Harry would be all alone with the boy of his dreams in his bedroom.
“Oh, right. Well, I mean, you could just call child protective services or something if things get out of hand.”
All in all, Harry had to admit it was a successful system. Given that facing Tom’s wrath was the consequence for getting bad grades, French eventually rose to his second highest class—first being biology. This led to another problem, however.
Harry was now stuck with the difficult decision of deciding whether or not to pursue a crush on a suspected serial killer. One on hand, murder was pretty bad. One the other hand, Blaise had very kissable lips.
“You know, I don’t think you did, Draco. You don’t have to, though, I know it was just—internalized homophobia and whatnot. Very tricky stuff.”
“Could you please not call me that? And I’m not telling you; you always just copy my answers. If you actually paid attention in class, maybe you’d be able to do it yourself?”
“So,” Harry began, once Sirius had put on one of his oversized sweatshirts (they were the only clothes Harry had that fit the taller boy). “I saw that you commented on my vlog.”
There was Draco, who he gave a little smooch to that one time… And then Sirius, who apparently is kind of into him too? And then Tom liked to torture him, but he also kind of confessed his undying love in a ferris wheel?
Harry didn’t know whether to consider his luck incredibly generous or incredibly disastrous when his tutor ended up being a literal angel. Not in terms of personality, of course. He was more like Satan in that regard. But looks wise--- he took Harry’s breath away. Fallen angel indeed.
“And I like you, Harry. As much as it pains me to say it, you are… adorable,” Tom hissed out the last word like it pained him to say it. “I thought you were a complete idiot at first. And I still do—”
At first Harry considered asking Sirius for help. His family was apparently part-French, and it wasn’t as if they were on bad terms after their ‘break up.’ He still hung out with the Marauders regularly and the only time it was awkward was when Sirius shot him these guilty, pitying glances.
“Well, I could hardly miss my darling pupil’s big audition, hm?” Tom purred out, ruffling Harry’s hair. Harry leaned into his touch eagerly, giggling. The rest of the cast watched with surprise, not knowing how close Harry was with the other boy. The two chatted for a while, Harry’s blush gradually deepening, before an arm grasped Harry’s shoulder harshly, pulling him back.
Cedric shrugged. “I think… I would be honored to be by your side, but if you choose someone else then… That just means they make you happier, and as long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters.”
Harry, feeling tired and rebellious, decided to skimp on the work. When he showed up to his next session with no pages, however, he was met with such a look of disdain that he practically melted to the ground. He was then faced with Tom’s silent treatment for the rest of the session. In fact, he was faced with Tom’s silence for the next two sessions, sometimes accompanied by a raised eyebrow, until Harry finally gave in and wrote the pages.
“Hello! What are you reading?” Harry, having interacted with plenty of bookworms during his Tumblr days, knew that the way to this girl’s heart was through copious amounts of literary discussions.
“Well,” he said. “Guess I better get going. Still have to finish that essay for McGonagall and all.”
“Yesss, I love you, Siri!” Harry wrapped his arms around Sirius’s neck, hugging him tightly. Sirius slowly brought his hands up to Harry’s back and hesitated for a second before dragging his fingers soothingly over Harry’s spine. Harry smiled softly before jumping out of Sirius’s grasp and running to the door and winking.
“Mm. I guess you could… ask him to be in one of your videos? That seems like the kind of thing he’d be into. And then use filming the video as an excuse to be touchy-feely and cute.”
When he was met with silence, Harry eventually tore his gaze back to Tom’s eyes. Or, more specifically, to Tom’s judgmental eyebrow.
Sirius sighed exasperatedly, although Harry could see his cheeks were red. “Why do you even want to join the traveling dance troupe, Harry?”
Harry handed Cedric his phone, discretely adding an emoji next to his name when he got it back. It was essential to have a representative emoji for all of his contacts, and next to Cedric’s he put a bumblebee.
Once it picked up, Harry screamed with joy and excitement only to look over in the middle of it to see Tom deathly white and looking like his soul was about to slip away from his body.
Cedric’s brows rose and his mouth gaped, seemingly about to say something but unable to get any words out.
Harry smiled smugly and grabbed Tom’s hand, dragging him to the entrance. Tom gripped his hand firmly and bit his lip, allowing Harry to eventually bring him up to the first ride.
The barista—Cedric—widened his eyes in surprise when Harry fell to the ground and quickly sprinted over to him to see what was wrong.
,” Harry purred, taking Sirius’s hands and bringing them down to his thighs. “I know you like me smooth.”
The Marauders, Harry acknowledged, were quite great. They were fun, quirky, laid-back—everything you could want in a friend group. What was
Harry stared at her incredulously. “Because he’s hot? Honestly Hermione, for a so-called ‘straight girl,’ you sure are kind of slow with these things.”
Harry sat, of course, at the very front of the train. It was important to let his presence be known to everyone who walked in, establishing his place as the alpha lesbian. Hogwarts unfortunately had a dress code consisting of black trousers, a grey cardigan, and a tie, which meant that Harry had to save his gloriously flamboyant fashion for the weekends. However, Harry was sure that the adorable rainbow heart pin he stuck in his hair would be enough to impose his exuberant homosexuality on any and all passerby.
Sirius Black, who was also on the Gryffindor floor of the dorms, could simply just go to his own room to change. From what Harry had seen of the boy, however, critical thought did not appear to be his strong suit, and he desperately wished he wouldn’t notice.
Cedric let out a relieved breath, smiling. “You can’t blame me for being nervous! You’re all lovely and sweet, and I’m just… y’know. Even if you liked me at first, that doesn’t mean you still would once you got to know me!”
So that’s where Harry was now, visiting the coffee shop for the fourth day in a row. Cedric, conveniently enough, seemed to work the 4-8 shift every day, allowing Harry to see him after school. Cedric smiled whenever Harry came in, not even asking for his name when making his coffee because he remembered it after the first time. Sometimes they even made small talk.
Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “And why would an attractive barista like you want my number? I haven’t even gotten to the seduction part of my plans yet! I was going to spill coffee all over my shirt so you’d let me change in the backroom or something, where I’d commence sexily stripping.”
Harry squinted his eyes. Was Blaise really just going to admit to his weird serial killer obsession right off the bat? Very suspicious. “Why do you read about serial killers so much?”
The fact that he showed Harry a side of himself he usually hid, even if that side most likely wanted to stab him, was kind of nice. Harry wondered if he was just a masochist.
Noticing Harry’s silence, Blaise stiffened slightly and stared at the ground, biting his lip again. He met Harry’s eyes again when the boy reached out to clasp Blaise’s hands in his own.
But of course, things never go well when you have Professor Snape as a teacher. Snape usually assigned Draco and Harry as lab partners, but one day he suddenly decided to switch things up. Because he was a sadist, obviously.
Harry introduced him to Hermione, who was pleasantly surprised that Sirius was an avid reader of Dostoyevsky and promptly encouraged Harry to marry him. Sirius, in turn, introduced him to his group of friends.
One certain James Potter that one certain Sirius Black stared at when he thought no one was looking—that looked heartbroken whenever said James Potter and Lily Evans were together.
Harry was flattered, in a way. Tom Riddle still acted as the kind and gentle prefect around school. Even Hermione seemed to be smitten with him.
“Not as flexible as you’re going to be after I twist you into a fucking pretzel. Did you drink Viagra for breakfast or something, Harry?”
“So,” Tom continued, “because of this, I’ve always felt like—like my life’s foundations were on shaky ground. Like everything I’ve worked hard to achieve could be taken away from me at a moment’s notice.”
Sirius, being not only sexy but also a saint, didn’t seem to mind. He gave him an indulgent smile and brought his hand up to his cheek, brushing his hair back behind his cheek.
The picture he makes is so lovely that for a moment Draco’s sure something must be wrong. There’s no way someone like him gets to have this.
He moves the cup in tight circles, disturbing the sluggish green mush and yellow-brown liquid inside. He turns it upside down, lets it drain a moment, and rights it again. His heart clenches. He’s seen that shape before.
Potter makes an impatient noise, and Draco pauses, looking down at the man lying beneath him. Potter’s definitely in subspace. He didn’t start this with the intention of putting him under, but there’s no doubt that he has. Quite likely, he never fully came out of it in the first place.
“Then it’s honestly no wonder you used to shut down when it came to sex, if you were that touch starved. It must have been overwhelming.”
“Yes, I imagine many a witch and wizard has warmed themselves at night imagining being tupped by you. A dashing hero with a giant dick, muscles rippling, buttons flying in the heat of passion.” He waves his hand in a studied manner, meant to inflict maximum condescension. “Etcetera, etcetera.”
Malfoy just keeps looking at him, compelling him to continue. In the dim ballroom, the breeze cooling his hot skin, it doesn’t feel real enough to have consequences.
He’s in the living room when Terran tumbles through the floo, his hair in disarray. “Harry, it wasn’t me! After Thursday night I needed a drink, so I went out with a mate, and I ended up telling him all about it. Someone must have heard us.”
Harry sighs. He’s being sighing more than he’d like to lately. “Well, what’s one more ghostly phenomenon to add to the list.
Biting his lip to stop a moan escaping, Harry sinks down until he can feel woven fabric against his arse, the back of his thighs. It’s just as strange as the last time they did this. This way, it all feels so sudden and shocking, even though there’s no pain. But, Draco’s probably right. If he’d fingered him, he would get too wound up, he wouldn’t be able to last.
Still, he clearly doesn’t mind. He’s hard and breathless and raking his nails down Draco’s neck and under his collar. It’s not all that comfortable for Draco, either. His arms are beginning to burn; Harry is a full-grown man, even if he is short, and he’s supporting nearly all of his weight. He can’t even pretend to care. He just continues to suck and lick and Harry’s neck, replacing all the marks that have disappeared over the last few days.
Potter folds his arms, looking unimpressed. “It took me ages to get it to trust me that much, and now I’ll probably have to start all over again.”
“Harry dear, do come in,” she says, wheeling herself back through. “Thank you for returning my Earl to me. He doesn’t get as many walks as he would like now that I’m older, so he tends to wander off.”
Granny puts two mugs down on the table. One in front of her, and one in front of Draco. Instead of tea, his drink is almost black, and smells fragrantly of coffee. “You go on and walk that silly dog now, Harry. I’ll take it from here.”
Her niece lays her hand over Granny’s where it rests on the table, and the tired old woman takes a deep breath before continuing. “My mother died, and some years later my father remarried. He had a daughter, my half-sister, and never told her the truth about me. All he told her was that a pocket watch had been stolen from her brother’s coffin, and they had never caught the thief. That sister is Aisling here’s mother.”
She raises a blond eyebrow that matches Malfoy’s perfectly. “No? Every wizard of class should own at least one set of dress robes. Preferably a different set for each season.”
They kiss slowly, unhurried, like falling into a pleasant dream. Draco’s quieter than normal, not speaking as he prepares him, his low breaths dancing over Harry’s thighs and stomach. Harry’s eyes fall closed as he lays back and lets himself be taken care of, drifting in a haze of simmering pleasure. Draco keeps dotting kisses on his knee, his hip, the arch of his foot. Each one feels like an expression of praise, written in a different language. A subtler one than usual.
Moments later, the gates open. He walks up the gravel path and knocks on the door. Draco opens it, slightly out of breath. “Sorry about that, Potter. The Malfoy’s may have fallen low, but I won’t stoop to apparating around my own house like a savage.”
“You’re in danger. I think Draco’s going to be okay but I saw you on the floor, and most of it didn’t make sense, but I think somethings going to happen to you.”
“True,” says Draco, a sly look on his face, before lowering his voice. “Do you remember that time we…”
? I never read that drivel if I can help it, but Pansy should have a by-line in this issue and she’ll kill me if I miss it.”
Harry clears his throat. The Star makes him think of Draco, of the Black family, and their celestial names. The woman on the card is has one foot in the water and one on land, naked under the night sky. It makes him think of Draco and his heron, standing on one leg, trying not to fall over. The book had said The Star means hope, purpose, and renewal.
Draco sighs, and guides Harry’s hand up to his mouth to kiss his palm. “Don’t let your hero complex get in the way, Harry.”
Harry recounts what he can remember, from finding Granny on the floor to blacking out. She listens intently.
“I told you I used the memory of my brother’s cat to make the watch purr, didn’t I? Well, ghosts have become untethered, are beginning to interact with the living world, and seem especially drawn to you,” she says to Harry.
“Want you to-” Harry starts, before interrupting himself with a groan. “Want you to fuck me like this.”
Malfoy nods and grabs two stout little glasses. He snags a bottle and sits down, gesturing to the chair opposite. Harry sits.
Harry grins, then frowns just as quickly. What can he say that both doesn’t involve magic, or dredge up horrible memories for both of them?
Draco’s throat moves as he swallows, and Harry remembers him sucking him off. Then he remembers sucking Draco off, that first time, and wants to do it again. He pictures himself on his knees, and this time Draco doesn’t hold back. He’d been so careful, had pulled away so as not to come in Harry’s mouth. He’d liked that Draco had cared enough to do that, but he doesn’t think he wants that all the time.
It feels like sinking into a warm bath at the end of a long day. Still tight enough to hug his cock, but without any resistance. Draco makes such shallow thrusts he’s barely moving, careful not to put pressure on the over-sensitised prostrate. He makes minute rocking motions, moving only centimetres at a time. It reminds him of being a teenager. Face down in his bed, wriggling his dick into the sheets, thinking about how much he hated Potter. Imagining holding Potter’s skull tightly in his hands, keeping it still, as he rocked in and out of his mouth.
Harry recounts his dream, leaving out only how close he and Draco were to each other at the end. Halfway through, Granny grips the armrests of her chair, the knuckles going white. She sighs. “I think I should tell you something about my family.”
“Indeed,” he says, throwing his jacket over the arm of the sofa before throwing himself dramatically onto the cushions.
He hears a thump directly above him, as if someone’s dropped something heavy. Or fallen. “Granny?” he calls.
He repeats it to himself like a mantra, trying to prepare himself, so the disappointment won’t show on his face as he opens the door. Taking a steadying breath, he turns the handle.
He winks. He actually winks at him. Harry might die. He likes Angus, he’s great, he feels a real kinship with him, but he also wants to smother him with a sofa cushion.
Phew. That's the last proper chapter, and so my first ever fanfic is basically done! I am open to feedback, but if you're going to criticise please be constructive. I'm posting this today because I have to get my laptop fixed tomorrow, and I didn't want to leave you guys hanging!
Ron goes to the window, looking relieved at the interruption. A large and elegant owl flutters her wings and lands on the table. She turns to face Harry, and gracefully holds out her leg.
Draco finds him in the library. It’s mostly undamaged, but the ladder that allows access to the higher shelves has taken to zipping away from humans like a feral cat, refusing to let anyone use it. It seems even the furniture was traumatised by the Manor’s former occupants. Potter is sitting cross-legged on the floor, talking to it. Draco stays quiet, watching. He can’t hear what he’s saying, his voice is too soft, but he’s clearly trying to reassure it. The ladder trembles, then slides an inch or two closer. Potter picks something up and holds it out, as if trying to show it to the eyeless piece of furniture. Wood polish.
They drink red wine with dinner, Harry drinking faster than he normally might. He’d never really appreciated the taste, he might as well be drinking vinegar half the time, but that isn’t the point of it now. His thumb rubs away the condensation on his glass as Terran complains about his new Quidditch coach who ‘just doesn’t understand the power dynamics of the team’. With the aid of Harry’s half-hearted responses, the conversation dies out quickly. Terran reaches across the table to trace over the scar on Harry’s left hand, the letters still as clear as they were ten years ago. He shivers.
Potter licks at the dildo as if it were real, distracting him from his reverie. Draco pushes it forwards, so he doesn’t have to strain his neck to take it in. Potter swallows it down, throat bobbing as he swallows his spit, his mouth watering. Draco taps the toy with the base of his wand, keeping it hovering in position.
“Harry,” says Draco, jumping slightly. “I didn’t hear you come up. This is Isla Black, she helped add to the wards.”
Narcissa nods once again to Ron and Hermione, and walks back through the wall. Harry puts a lid on the pot and stands in front of the two people who know him better than anyone else. Hermione lifts the glass to her mouth again, studying Harry’s face too closely to notice her repeated mistake. Before it can reach her mouth Ron switches it back to wine, in one of the small gestures of love that convince Harry they are perfect for each other.
“But what about-” starts Harry, before cutting himself off. There are so many questions, and at least some of them Granny has the answers to, but he can’t say anything in front of the Healers.
Harry studies his face now they’re close enough. “I have to admit, I’ve thought about giving you a black eye many times in my life but I never thought it would happen like this.”
Hermione thumps him on the back. “When his three years in the muggle world were over. He sent me an owl.”
“She’s just a year old. Healthy as can be, and a worthy companion for the hero of the Wizarding world, if I do say so myself.”
Draco undoes his belt and pulls out his cock. With his hands on Harry’s hips, he lifts Harry up to hover over him. He wants Draco inside him, but he tries not to move until he’s told to, tries to be good. Thighs trembling with effort, he waits. This time Draco doesn’t say anything, just searches his face, as if looking for any sign of stress or reluctance. Presumably seeing none, he eases Harry down.
“Not anymore, anyway,” concedes Draco. “I had no control over my life for a long time, or I felt like I didn’t. Someone trusting me, someone giving me control willingly, is a rush.”
“Normally I’d say a book, but it needs to be something you’d have to spend time on. What kind of present would you need help with?”
be taken away. Maybe not right now, maybe not for a while, but he knows this can’t last forever. Potter will find someone else, someone nice, someone good for him. Not only will he give them this, he’ll give them his heart too.
Draco leans back, removes his hands from Harry’s body, and gets a little more serious. “After the shower that time, the way you reacted to me taking care of you was intense. Do you want to try something like that, in this context?”
“Did you mean it?” he asks, not bothering to lift his head from Harry’s sternum. “What you said about me.”
They sit in silence for a while, matching his breathing to Potter’s own measured breaths. Draco slots his fingers into the divots of Potter’s ribs, stewing in joy and self-recrimination. Is this what it would be like? If Potter wanted him for more than sex, if this were a real relationship, would he have this every day? He doesn’t want to break the silence. He doesn’t want to remind Potter who’s holding him, that he doesn’t belong here.
Draco uncrosses his legs, marks his place with a slip of paper that looks like a list of potions ingredients, and balances his book on the arm of the chair. “Come here, then.”
Harry nods and buries any further questions in kisses, fingers shaking slightly as they move over Terran’s shirt buttons. Terran’s own steady hands go to Harry’s belt, the clink of metal making him clench his fists in anticipation. Terran guides him by the shoulders to sit on the bed, and sinks to his knees.
“Yeah, yeah,” he says, breathlessly. “Everything’s great. Brilliant. Just need to get an early night.”
Draco manoeuvres him off his lap so he can systematically strip Harry of his clothes, before pulling him back down to straddle him. His naked dick is trapped against Draco’s fancy clothes, and the thought of it being neglected while Draco does what he likes with him makes him squirm in humiliated pleasure. His hands are once again wrapped around Draco’s neck, and he knows he has to keep them there. Harry tries to steal a kiss, but Draco pulls him back by his hair.
“I’ll do what I can, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to help. It’s not like he’d talk to me, he’d probably shut the door in my face.”
“I’m not saying I want to be best mates,” continues Harry. “But if Arthur wants to give him a chance then that’s up to him.”
Draco’s answering laugh is carefree, without any of the callous undertones of his youth, and Harry wants to make it happen again as soon as possible. “Before the war I wanted to hurt you more than anything.” His smile becomes smaller, and he lies back on the grass, watching wisps of cloud blow away into nothing. “Even a week ago I still hated you. I even hated you for testifying at my trial, but I didn’t want to hurt you anymore. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I’ve had my fill, more than my fill.”
Ron and Hermione weren’t ignoring him, they made sure to include him to an almost pathological degree, but he didn’t want to get in their way. So, Harry spent a lot of time walking. Sometimes he traced the routes he had stalked Malfoy down in sixth year, and wondered what he was doing now. Hogwarts was almost boring without someone to fight. However, though Harry testified in order to keep him from Azkaban, the Wizengamot still felt something had to be done. Malfoy was ordered to live for three years as a Muggle, without his wand, so that he might learn the tolerance his parents never taught him. Poor bastard, thought Harry, as he hovered outside Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. He found that his walks often concluded outside this particular room, but he was never able to go in.
The bastard son-of-a-whore lies on top of Harry more fully. Didn’t he feel him flinch? Of course he did, he just cares more about getting his dick wet than the man who loves him.
“I really am fine,” says Harry, who’s finally stopped crying. He wipes the tears from his eyes with the back of his fist. “God, I’m sorry, this is so stupid.”
“Don’t you dare,” they say, tone light but serious. Clearly this thing about the boiler is some mixture of an in-joke and a genuine bone of contention. “You should bring your boy to the party, by the way. I want to meet whoever’s got you so smitten.”
“Er, well,” says Harry, hiding his embarrassment at his own boldness with a kiss to Draco’s neck. “This room is where we first kissed, isn’t it? And ever since I finished fixing it up, I’ve been thinking we should finish what we started.”
“Trial and error mostly. I’ve always liked fixing things, and after the Vanishing Cabinets-” Draco cuts himself off, looking uncomfortable. “I was trying to fix up the house, clean out the dark magic, but everything kept going back to how it was. Eventually I realised that the house itself had become warped, stained. The wards have been added to hundreds of times over the centuries, and not a small number of them used dark magic. It had already infected the house before the Dark Lord came, but his presence tipped it over the edge.”
“Dear lord, Potter,” drawls Malfoy. “I know you have a hero complex but this is just inexplicably idiotic. You have to rush in and save everyone but Merlin forbid
Harry’s heart sank. It seemed his imagination had not only run away from him, but also lead him into disappointment.
Harry folds his arms, but he doesn’t look all that cross. “I can fight my own battles. I did kill a Dark Lord, you know. You might have heard of him- Moldervort or whatever his name was.”
Draco does as instructed, lowering the young woman onto the purple armchair. Earl growls in her direction.
It rumbles in his hand. Harry traces the engraving with his thumb, and opens it to see the clock inside. Its workings are exposed, the intricate mechanisms visible. “It’s beautiful.”
“Yeah. It’s weird the stuff she knows. Like yesterday she told  me to watch where I was going that morning, and then later I nearly walked into a lamppost.”
“You can lie down later, but right now you’re going to do what you said and be a good boy for me.” He grabs Harry’s shoulders and turns him round to face the wall, grabbing Harry’s hands to place them on the tile. “Aren’t you?”
We're getting more backstory in this chapter, and also Harry and Draco meet again. This chapter is rated T, but warnings are in the end notes as usual. Thanks to those who left kudos on the first chapter, kudos and comments are what keep me going!
Harry tugs hard, feeling the satisfying stretch of his muscles in his arms and shoulders, his core as he bucks upwards. It brings their chests together, Harry’s naked skin against the soft fabric of Draco’s shirt. As much as he loves Draco’s body, and he has a beautiful one, Harry likes when he’s the only one undressed. He feels exposed, and wanted, like Draco can’t even wait long enough to take his clothes off before he fucks him.
He knows Potter’s just looking for an excuse to escape to the bar, but he’s not one to complain. Who ever thought they’d see the day that Harry Potter bought a Malfoy a drink?
Remembering the woman who’d ran out only moments before, he flies to his feet, and out of the shop. Earl will have to look after Granny while he's gone. Surely the attacker must be gone by now, but he has to at least try and catch her.
“Don’t be a dick, Blaise” says Millie. “This is obviously the first time he’s ever actually thought about his clothes other than ‘shall I wear
Draco freezes. His mind is split into two halves. On the one hand, wild horses could not drag him into that pub. It’s going to be filled with people who know all the worst things Draco Malfoy’s ever done in his life, and some of those things he did to them personally. He sent letters of formal apology, after his exile was over and he was allowed to use owls again, but he hasn’t faced anyone except Luna in person. Unless you count that whole debacle at the Burrow, but he’s mostly blocked that from his memory out of sheer awkwardness. He knows Luna would spend time with him, but he wouldn’t want to monopolise her, so he’d be sat there like a gooseberry the rest of the time. Although, if Potter’s inviting him, that does imply he’ll acknowledge his existence. But keeping this secret, as he’s sure Potter wants, is hard enough without alcohol in the mix.
The wanker scoffs and hauls himself off the bed, already stepping back into his trousers. Potter looks devastated, tears blurring his green eyes.
Draco tilts his head. “Not necessarily. Magical houses like these often cut off rooms that are no longer in use, and bring them back when they are needed. This house was empty for years, I imagine it’s half the size it used to be.”
He shakes him off and reaches for Harry, and Draco just snaps. He whips his wand through the air, casting a swift and silent
Apparating directly into the ballroom, he sends balls of warm orange light bobbing along the ceiling. It doesn’t do much to light the room, but Harry doesn’t want to catch his reflection in the wall of broken mirrors. He must look a mess. At one point, without him realising, he had started to cry. His hair wilder even than normal, from his anxious tugging. Clothes still dishevelled from the last-ditch attempt at a kiss when Terran first told him he needed time apart.
the lucky one, that Harry can do better, and then obligingly set him up on a date with a gorgeous acquaintance who never thought it was a good idea to stick a Dark Mark on their arm. He could, but he won’t. Instead, he gives in and kisses the beautiful man in front of him again. No one’s ever called Draco Malfoy self-sacrificing, and he’s never been so glad to be selfish.
“No,” laughs Harry. “I’m pretty sure I called him my ‘arch rival’ at one point, but I was a pretty dramatic teenager.”
Harry bristles. “It wasn’t. All that happened was- what happened was-” He growls in frustration. “I don’t know. I can’t say it right, it sounds worse than it is. Can I just show you?”
“I don’t know. At first I wanted to have sex with Ma- this guy- so I could make things work with Terran.” Wait.
Draco eventually admits that he’s done as much as he can for today, and they make their way back to the kitchen. Harry rummages through the snack draw and pulls out a half-eaten bar of chocolate. Lupin always gave it to him when teaching Harry to cast a Patronus, and though there were no dementors here, he’s sure it can’t hurt.
Harry wakes to a cold palm on his forehead. Perhaps that’s what had made him dream of pressing his head together with Draco’s. Granny removes her hand, and raises her eyebrows in a silent question.
Hermione looks back down at her glass. Ron had turned it to white wine, instead of its original red. She shrugs and takes another sip while Harry lifts the lid back off the pot. Hot steam billows out, fogging up his glasses, and causing him to yelp and stumble back. Hermione splutters with laughter, wine snorting out her nose.
He lines their cocks up with each other, and strokes them both at once. Potter is almost completely soft now.
Hermione hums, and Harry recognises her expression as the one she gets when a theory is percolating in her head.
The older Healer casts her eye over the scene, and gives a satisfied nod. “Good, no one’s dying. Now why didn’t you just come to St Mungo’s rather than dragging us out here.”
Draco hums, and rests his hand on Harry’s knee where it rises out of the water. “I’m not interested in hurting you Harry.”
Malfoy lets out the breath he’d been holding. “Thank you.” He appears to steel himself before saying “And not just for that. I think I owe you a lot of ‘thank you’s. Apologies too.”
What can he say that won’t make Potter leave, like he did the first time? Although, this is Potter’s house. That means the question really is: what can he say that won’t make Potter kick him out? Any sooner than he was planning to, anyway. He won’t kid himself into thinking that Potter would want him to stay.
The living room is crowded now, almost all the available seats taken, and somehow Harry finds himself seated opposite Draco. His eyes flick to Harry, as if seeking support, or an out. He shrugs, apologetic, and Draco looks away again. Hermione looks as if she very much wants to be calm about this, but very much isn’t. Ron looks like he’s been walloped in the face with a frying pan.
Ron’s face turns from white to a blotchy red. “Harry, what the bloody hell is going on? Why is there a dead Malfoy in your kitchen?”
Wednesday night looms, thrilling and imposing, on the horizon. He’d received a note from Potter, the night before. It read:
Simi grins the evil grin of someone about to thoroughly humiliate their best friend. “You should have seen what his hair was like when I first met him. He had it all slicked back; it was so uptight. I have pictures. Draco won’t let me put them up, but I’ll show you.”
Draco nods, looking surprised he remembered the name of his muggle friend. But if they’re calling on a mobile, it probably isn’t a wizard. The idea of a muggle who knows nothing about ‘The Boy Who Lived’ and who won’t be disgusted by what they’re doing because they do similar things themselves, knowing about what’s happening, doesn’t seem so bad.
Hello all! Than you to everyone who encouraged me to write more fics, I'm glad to be back. This one deals with heavy stuff, so there are trigger warning in the end notes if you want them. As always, kudos and comments keep me writing and updating!
“Tell me what you were thinking, Harry. Did you imagine us fucking in front of the mirrors, so we could see what a mess we’d make of ourselves?”
“Alright, but I better not be the only Slytherin. I almost came out in a rash after Sunday, being surrounded by so many Gryffindors.”
“Okay…” says Ron slowly. “But what makes her think you’ll be able to do all the other stuff too? Like crystal balls, and tea leaves, and stuff.”
The bird was brown, and about the length of his arm. It blinked yellow eyes at him, before rapping its beak against the glass, as if asking to be let in.
He takes a deep breath, and collects himself. “Mrs Malfoy asked me for a favour. She’s coming round to check on my progress.”
“I think this is yours,” says Draco. He lets go of Harry’s hand to reach into his pocket, taking out the pocket watch out to give to Granny. “I’m sorry it’s broken.”
It was a leisurely breakfast of tea and toast. Narcissa tried to look adequately stern as he told her stories about her sister Andromeda and Teddy, but smiles broke through her cold exterior. He made it to the shop on time, and had a productive lesson with Granny. All in all, it was the calmest morning he’d had in a long time, but his stomach was churning through all of it. He’d invited Draco for lunch again, after he’d asked to come back and look at the wards with equipment he hadn’t had to hand the last time. Harry had agreed, and now he was bricking it.
Harry wants to get Malfoy naked too, wants to see what’s hidden beneath all those layers of formality and artifice. When he tugs at Malfoy’s collar, he’s distracted by the small mark he finds under his jaw. Harry did that, and Malfoy hasn’t healed it. His mouth is drawn back to the love bite, licking over it with perverse satisfaction at its existence. Malfoy groans, and he can feel the vibration of it on his lips. Malfoy runs his hands down over his torso to rest at Harry’s jeans, pressing a hand into his groin. Harry gasps against Malfoy neck.
Draco shuffles until he’s upright, their faces level, with Harry sitting in his lap. He grabs Harry’s arse cheeks, massaging them, letting a thumb dip into the crease.
Narcissa’s house arrest ended at the same time Draco’s exile did. The first thing they did together was go house hunting. She’d been trapped in that mausoleum, that place so filled with misery and darkness, and now all she wanted was a stylish modern apartment. The building was popular with young business people, and his mother stuck out like a sore thumb, but she loved it. It was almost as different to the Manor as it was possible to get.
They nod, but don’t yet speak. Harry strokes Earl’s ears like a child with a comfort blanket, Draco’s spine is stiff, and Granny’s niece ducks her head guiltily.
Malfoy’s warmth leaves his body, the only point of contact remaining is the hand cupping his hip. He murmurs two incantations, one after the other, and Harry feels a warmth followed by a tingling inside him. He recognises the feelings as spells for cleansing and protection. Malfoy whispers another spell, and he knows this one intimately. He hears the clatter of Malfoy tossing his wand onto the table, and stretches out his own hands from where they’re pinned underneath him to grip the rounded edge of the table across from him.
His mind tumbled down the stairs ahead of him, racing to meet the stranger before he’d even set eyes on them. Perhaps it was a long lost relative, come to claim him? Perhaps they were the one who sent the letter? They must be an odd sort of person, to have sent a letter via owl, but Harry didn’t mind. If they wanted him, he could put up with any eccentricities with a smile. They may not be as rich as the Dursleys, but if they’d come looking for him then they surely must be kind. He was well into imagining his new life with this newcomer when he knocked on the door to the parlour and entered the room.
“No.” Harry shakes his head. “It’s too complicated. You’re working with Arthur, so we’ll see each other all the time. It’ll be awkward. And I’ve only just broken up with Terran, I should take some time to get my head on straight, not rush into anything”
“I understand, but you still have to make an effort.” She gives him a knowing look. “You haven’t been doing that lately, have you?”
Harry grumbles and moans, stretching out like a lazy dog, before falling still again. Feeling like a brute, he slides out from under the sleepy Potter and stumbles over to the window. It’s one of those Victorian sash windows, and it screeches with rust as he pushes it up. Three letters are immediately dropped onto the desk, the
Light scratches as his eyes as Narcissa pulls back the curtains. Harry had overslept. He was late. Narcissa stays facing the window as he grabs clean pants, she snipes at him half-heartedly as he hops around pulling his jeans on, before he runs into the adjoining bathroom to throw water on his face and armpits. Harry looks in the mirror, tugging at his hair, but it’s no better or worse than when he actually tries to tame it.
He tips his head forward so the tips of their noses just touch. “Generally, I regret the things I actually did, not the ones I didn’t do.”
The air is hot and damp between them as he rucks up Draco’s shirt, pulling the tails out of his trousers as Draco undoes Harry’s fly. Harry slips out of his shoes, contorting inelegantly to peel off his socks while standing up. Forgetting about his own clothes, Draco finishes getting him naked with the same focus he devoted to deciding the evening’s colour palette. Meaning, almost worryingly focused. Draco steers them closer to the mirrors, positioning himself behind Harry before resting his chin on his shoulder.
Harry slides out of his trainers and walks towards him. There’s nowhere for him to sit, so he hovers in front of him, unsure if Draco wants his to stand, or kneel, or sit in his lap.
“Yes, I do,” answers Draco, blinking rapidly in disbelief. He turns to Harry. “Now are you going to tell me why I’m here, or am I supposed to see it in the crystal ball?”
Harry clenches his thighs, pulling Draco even closer until the head of his dick brushes against his balls. The rope is starting to burn against his wrists, but he only struggles against it more, torn between wanting his hands on Draco and the way the sting heightens his arousal.
“No,” she says. “Not today, anyway. Now take that naughty boy for a walk, or he’ll be nipping at my ankles all day.”
He’s cast this spell so many times, he can see it even before he opens his eyes. The delicate hooves, the branching antlers, the expressive eyes. That is not what he sees now. It flies from his wand, long legs tucked under its white body, its neck a graceful line.  A bird. Not his stag, not something that came from him. This is the piece of Draco that has buried it’s way into his heart, and built itself a nest there. These eyes aren’t soft and warm like a deer’s; they’re bright, curious, and slightly sharp. It’s circular flight curves and swoops down to towards him, and he holds out his arm like he would for an owl. It lands, but he doesn’t feel any weight.
He repeats the process with his cup, swish and dump. There are three shapes circling the base: a snitch, a castle, and baby. At least he thinks it’s a baby, it could just as easily be a potato. He voices this uncertainty to Granny but she simply waves it away.
Those strange, considerate gestures that had made his throat constrict before, now make his blood run cold. He was doing this with Malfoy because they didn’t care what each other thought- except in the name of competition. They were rivals, and that implies a certain level of equality. He doesn’t want anyone to feel responsible for him, let alone Malfoy. He really doesn’t.
“Well, I sort of thought we might be already,” says Harry, turning round to busy himself with the tea; hiding his face from Draco.
, but he knows Potter would react badly, and push him away. As much as Draco wants to stay for his own sake, he also thinks that Potter might need someone right now. He’s just had a pretty major panic attack, or flashback, or whatever it was. If Potter kicked him out, he very much doubts he’d call someone else to help. He’d probably just stew by himself.
“She’s lovely,” says Harry. He puts Earl back down, so he can hold his hand out to her. She nibbles gently at his thumb, as if hoping for a treat, and his breath catches in his throat. Hedwig used to do the exact same thing.
Sure enough, when Malfoy’s finger strokes over his hole, it’s wet with lube. Harry jumps, the small touch sending sparks ricocheting around his body. A palm strokes up and down his back, as if trying to soothing him.
But Harry is looking at him. He pulls back, not all the way off, just enough to hold the head in his mouth. Then he sucks hard. Malfoy curses and pulls him the rest of the way off, before covering his own dick with his fist. Clenching his jaw and tipping his head back, Malfoy comes into his hand.
“Maybe at first, but then it was just because I wanted to. You’re an alright bloke when you want to be,” says Harry.
“Today I want you to be silent. Once we begin, you’re not to talk unless you need to use your safeword, I ask you a question, or something is wrong. I’ll be checking in with you to make sure you’re still with me, but I’ll need you to be quiet for what I have in mind. Is that alright?”
This time he floos to Draco’s house, rather than apparating. He’s expecting him, so he doubts he’ll mind. It’s just that if he has to make himself knock on the front door, he’ll probably talk himself out of it and run away. He topples out the fireplace and into Draco’s living room, only just gaining his balance at the last second. His host is sat on a large wingback armchair, one long leg crossed primly over the other, reading a book.
"He's 3! No, dear, if you really want to be there for Teddy then he needs family. How about you just stop by for Christmas instead of getting him luxury toddler gifts?" She shook her head exasperatedly but there was a smile playing on her lips.
"The other way that you can help is by supporting me in embracing Draco." He looked to Ron and Ginny. "He's actually really important to me for a number of reasons and the more people I have on our side who help break the stigma of him as an evil death eater, the better."
He breathed a sigh of relief when Draco made it through without incident (because he had been sure he was going to be subjected to a strip search considering how fucking bizarre he'd been acting). He was smiling brilliantly as he padded over to him just as Harry was putting his ring back around his neck.
Harry's wandless counter repelled the jinx with such force that it pulverized part of the nearby fountain and knocked several of the oncoming Aurors backwards. Water shot high into the air from where the stone goblin had once stood and showered down upon them.
After all of the renovations, Harry and Ginny had been dismayed to find that no amount of magic had been able to rid the vile woman from the wall.
It made sense to me that, based off of what we've seen thus far, the boys might thrive with some dom/sub play where there is a lot of emotional reassurance and validation. Already having hints that Draco dabbled as a dom in his relationships in the past (the bossy Slytherin who knows what he wants when it comes to sex and all), but I liked the idea of this being something sweeter with Harry that could take away his need to get all in his head about caring/feeling too much or fears of doing things wrong and being unlovable/making loved ones leave him because he got it wrong.
His unexpected business trip back home to England had been, by all accounts, a success. He'd managed to save Blaise's arse and potentially position Z&M International as
"That was so cool earlier! How you stopped Harry from going mental and then you all stared down that killing curse!
It had been blatantly obvious to Draco that it had been an invitation for Harry and Harry alone, but of course the self-righteous git had taken it upon himself to invite Draco along, too.
Draco stayed a step behind, letting Harry lead the way both because he had no idea where he was going, as well as the fact that it made it easier to sneak glances at the bloke without being conspicuous. Harry's fixed determination was a sight to behold, for sure, and it certainly didn't help the ridiculous fluttering sensation in Draco's stomach or, occasionally, his chest.
" Harry chanted as Davenport opened his mouth and the boy's wand flew towards him. "I think not. Listen to me," he said, wand still aimed at the now shaking, wandless 5th year. "I can talk to whom I please and I can handle myself. If I ever see you point your wand at another student unprovoked I'll not only hex you myself but I'll make sure you see detention for the rest of the year!"
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
Harry clambered eagerly into the bed but Draco had paused by the doorway. Harry looked back, confused, only to find the prat staring aghast at the decor.
It was bizarre watching the chaos that ensued: all around them, witches and wizards screamed in panic or, otherwise, ran into each other as they cast useless light spells.
At half past 10, Draco apparated them to a frozen lake surrounded by what was probably lush farmland in the warm weather months on one side and a village full of sandstone houses on their side. He drew the hood of his cloak closely around his face and looked around them vigilantly. Appleby had a close-knit wizarding community and they couldn't afford to be spotted. Harry followed suit.
Harry kept his gaze on his plate, pointedly trying to avoid making eye contact with any of the girls around the Great Hall who kept waving or batting their eyes shamelessly in his direction. He already knew from experience that it only got worse when you made eye contact!
At that, Harry could no longer contain himself. He stood abruptly, letting go of Draco's hand, to pace back and forth on the threadbare rug. He ran his fingers through his hair, threatening to dislodge his bun.
"You haven't been with any men," he stated rather than questioned. That wasn't surprising considering the recent '
wand back before trying to join them and Crabbe, the stupid lug, might very well be alive today. He'd never been sure if -- oh, fuck it --
"Today, I'd like to work on something more challenging! Let's see if I can stump you with some of the flashier spells!" He smiled. "Can anyone name some of the spells that are guaranteed to get you some additional points on your NEWTS?"
! I want nothing to do with that thing!" The ties to Dumbledore's death, Voldemort, Snape's misguided demise, centuries worth of death and destruction.... "Harry, I never
Draco put his head in his hand as he realized he probably should have briefed his friends before they met up. Harry was looking at him from his chair by the fire with amusement in his eyes. "Didn't think it through, huh?"
So far, they'd done a bang up job of ignoring the giant, the basilisk, and the dragon in the room which left Draco on unsteady footing. There was a shite ton of things they needed to talk about but, with kidnapped girl regrettably taking precedence, it had hardly seemed like the appropriate time to bring up the fact that the last time they'd seen each other (before the restaurant encounter) they'd been professing their undying love for each other with Harry's dick up his arse... He sighed to himself, deciding he should probably let Harry take the lead on that since he
"You take me for a complete wanker, do you? I didn't forget that little display of wandless magic that day on your terrace." Draco cursed, inwardly. Unlike Harry, he'd never actually taken the time to
Distracted by the opulence of the grand drawing room Draco had just apparated them to, Harry didn't immediately grasp exactly what had caused Draco's reaction. He jumped and reached for his absent wand, however, when he turned to find Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy staring at them, completely flabbergasted, from where they were sat around the fire.
forget that night. For years to come, he would recall the sweet nothings that meant everything whispered from Draco's lips to his ears and the tender, open mouth kisses they shared or the overwhelming combination of love, joy, and pleasure he felt as Draco Malfoy lowered himself onto him just as the sun began to set, the image of his bare, pale skin forever framed in beautiful hues of gold, purple, orange and crimson in his mind.
Harry registered Draco straighten, somewhat protectively, somewhere in his peripheral but Harry's brow furrowed, perplexed, as he stared incredulously at the secretary.
Harry can’t help agreeing. Draco keeps swerving wildly from poncy bastard to intense lothario to gentle lover and back again. He can’t keep up, and frankly it’s exhausting. Harry’s eyes drift shut. At one point he hears the faint sound of running water, the rustle of clothes, but he’s too tired to remember he should be leaving. He feels a blanked being draped over him, warm weight at his side, and allows sleep to drag him under.
“I love you,” he continues. He keeps his voice low as if trying not to spook him, and he can barely hear himself over the ringing in his ears. “I’ve loved you for so long I can’t remember what it’s like not to love you. You have no idea precious you are, and not just to me. You deserve everything, everything-”
Harry’s heart turns a hundred and eighty degrees in his chest. He sits up, grabs his wand from the bedside table, and casts his Patronus. The heron is not identical to the one Draco cast. Draco’s crest of feathers was neat, like a crown. Harry’s looks ruffled, like it’s just been in a fight and it might get in another one. It lands on the bedpost.
Draco puts one palm to Harry’s chest and starts to walk him backwards. The space is hazily lit with late afternoon sun, windows shut and the curtains drawn. The floor is so polished it’s almost as reflective as the wall of mirrors, and it’s barely recognizable as the same room they kissed in all those months ago. He stumbles slightly as he walks backwards, and Draco grabs his shoulders to right him, bringing them to a halt near the centre of the dancefloor.
Zabini whisks off into another room and returns with a procession of clothes floating on hangers behind him.
“If you dare come back here, I’ll do things to you that’ll make you wish you’d snapped your wand and went to live as a muggle before you ever even heard the
Harry obeys, laving the fingers with his tongue, sucking them in deeper until they hit his tonsils. He’s too enthusiastic to be careful, and he chokes slightly.
him for, well. It excites and unnerves him in equal measure. He doesn’t know why, but the idea of it sparked something in him. Harry can hardly bear to name it, even in his own head, so how is he supposed to do it? He pictures it now, and shivers.
Harry hums. “It’ll be easier now Neville’s greenhouse is finished. I might even take a few days off.”
“I’m not sure why you’re so put out about it, then. Isn’t this your scrawny, speccy dream come true?” she wonders.
“I’m fine,” he says, looking up at him. Malfoy was about to come, and he was still thinking about Harry. Again, that incongruent word pops into his head.
Draco has a few choice comments of his own to make, but he’s too far away to join the discussion naturally. Instead, he’s stuck being lectured by Percy about the proper way to format inter-departmental memos. He catches Harry’s eye, and glares. It’s his fault he’s being subjected to this. Harry’s answering grin is unrepentant, and he finds himself forgiving the bastard. You can get away with a lot, with a face like that.
Before they have a chance to catch up, Tabby cajoles them into joining her, Jake, and a shy looking boy on the lumpy sofa and mismatched chairs. Apparently, there’s a debate she wants them to weigh in on.
He comes back over to Harry and gently guides down onto the bed, propped against the headboard, then lies down next to him. He rubs Harry’s arm as if he might be cold, conjures a glass and casts
Harry plucks at a pill in the fabric. “I don’t know why I reacted like that. I didn’t act like that when it happened. It wasn’t even a big deal.”
Draco smiles. “That’s about the size of it. Besides, you’re insulting yourself in all the wrong ways.”
The leather bar, then. That doesn’t explain the animosity between them, one-sided that it is. Samuel doesn’t acknowledge Draco’s glare; his eyes are fixed on Harry.
Finally, Draco surfaces from the pensieve, gripping the edge of the desk. He doesn’t turn around. The line of his shoulders is tense, his knuckles turning white.
She bends over to pick up the little dog. “I know, duckie. I’ve got the cards out ready for you.” Harry looks at the table, and realises the cards have been placed in front of his chair. He sits down. “I thought it might be better if you tried for yourself,” says Granny. “See what you’ve learned.”
Shit. If Granny doesn’t want this going to the Aurors, they can’t tell the truth. But what can he say that will make any sense?
Granny’s shop looks the same as it always does when he apparates outside, determined to tell her that he can’t be her apprentice. Because he’s not a Seer, he’s not ‘special’ like Draco had said, and he’ll only disappoint her. He’s already disappointed himself. Barging into the shop, the bell clangs so hard it falls off the hook. He can hear Earl Grey barking madly.
Potter’s eyes flick to the door, and he takes the holly wand out of his jeans pocket, casting locking and silencing charms. Then he bites the lip that’s been plaguing Draco so thoroughly, and casts a protection spell over Draco. It’s the first time he’s been the one to do it, and his magic is warm when it washes over his skin, bringing his prick from half-hard to aching almost instantly. Potter pockets his wand again, and gets gracelessly to his knees. His ungainliness only makes him seem younger, less experienced, reminding Draco he’s the only one who’s had him like this. He wants to keep it that way for as long as possible.
They move to the next room. A fourposter bed not unlike Harry’s own sits at the centre of the room, though everything is so smothered in dust that any colours are drowned out by grey. Malfoy’s nose wrinkles, and he casts a quick cleaning charm, but it doesn’t completely remove the grime.
Harry bristles. “I wasn’t blaming you, Malfoy. I was trying to tell you this will take a long time.”
Broomstick-Apple-Fight, while unimaginatively named, is at least straightforward. The players fly through the Malfoy Manor’s orchard, pelting each other with fruit, until someone falls to the ground. That, or they run out of apples.
“Then maybe I’m the lucky one,” he says with the slow, confident smile of a man used to getting what- and who- he wants.
The purring starts quietly, but it builds. It grows in volume until he feels like he’s inside the belly of a lion. The ground begins to shake. Harry is getting colder, and the cat impossibly hotter, until his hand is burning where it touches her spectral fur. Draco’s face begins to twitch, his hands flex. The cat dissolves into him. Suddenly, he jolts upright, like waking from a nightmare. Their eyes meet for just an instant, before the black splotches crowd his vision, and Harry loses consciousness.
“I think it should be called something positive,” says Granger. “Like ‘The Harmony Centre’ or ‘The Acceptance Facility’.”
Potter’s mouth is hell. It would be simpler to say it was heaven, but it wouldn’t be true, because this is torture. Not because he’s bad at it- he’s not. Unpractised, but definitely not bad. Potter’s tongue is curious, moving against him. The roof of his mouth is like satin over stone, hard and silky when the head of his cock slides against it. His lips are generous, shiny with spit. Occasionally there is the slight scrape of teeth, but Potter corrects himself swiftly, applying apologetic little licks and kisses to the area. This can’t be heaven, because it’s too good to be true. Any moment now it’s going to be snatched away, and then he’ll have to spend eternity knowing exactly what he’s missing. And it
“Draco!” effuses Molly, sweeping him into a hug that he’ll ever get used to. “I was so happy when Harry told us you were coming.”
Harry misses part of the conversation as he wrestles with himself, trying to stay under control. He wants to be good, and that means not moving or making noise. If he wants Draco to praise him, to fuck him, to be pleased with him, he has to play by the rules.
Harry thinks for a moment. How could he explain it to someone with no knowledge of muggles whatsoever?
“That should be easy enough to notice. Sex is a conversation, only wanking is a monologue. Although,” he says, looking Harry up and down. “I’m not opposed to an argument.”
He goes downstairs and chucks some floo powder into the fireplace, kneeling down to stick his head in the flames. Zabini is sitting on a large black Chesterfield sofa with one leg tucked beneath him, in fluffy yellow socks. Millie is reclining on the other end, with her feet in Zabini’s lap. They’re both holding truly enormous glasses of wine.
He can feel a small shake starting underneath him, growing until Blaise is roaring with laughter. He pushes Draco off him and wipes a tear from his eye. “Only you, Draco. Only you could feel bad about that.”
“Narcissa, I need your help,” he entreats as he shoves two slices of seeded loaf into the toaster. “How can I show Draco that I want to be his friend because I like him, and not because you asked me to be? I don’t know him the way I know Ron or Hermione, I don’t know how to make him believe me.”
“Clearly you were right to be worried,” says Hermione, glaring at Ron. “Anyway, it’s your business, and you’re not obligated to tell us everything. That being said, I hope you know you can always talk to me about anything.”
Simi’s calm voice pops into his head, reminding him what to do in situations like these, when his anxiety takes over. He takes a fortifying breath, halts the movement of his hips, and takes objective stock of the situation. Potter is relaxed, but still responsive. That means he’s not panicking or dissociating. He asked Draco to do this, he’s consented every step of the way- enthusiastically. Simi’s voice is loud and clear in his mind, repeating the phrases they’ve drilled into him over the years.
. Harry runs. He flees his own home, like a coward, because being brave hadn’t done him any favours. What was the point of that stupid Tarot reading if it came to this? Standing on his front doorstep, unsure of where to go, he thinks of that ill-fated card reading. He’d obviously done it wrong. Harry isn’t a Seer.
. The sandstone brickwork is covered in the ghostly shapes of ivy that’s since been removed, but left its mark behind.
Harry smirks, feeling quite pleased with himself, before his face freezes. Fuck, but Draco looks fit. He’s wearing a burgundy silk shirt, the first few buttons undone, showing a hint of delicate collarbone. The colour makes his pale skin look luminous, like marble. Instead of peach, his nails are painted pitch black, and silver rings adorn his fingers. Harry swears there’s a matching silver sheen to his eyelids, and is that… Yes, it is. It’s lip gloss. It makes him look like he’s been kissing for hours, and Harry wants to do just that. Harry ducks his head, a little embarrassed at his reaction.
Harry looks on in shock. By all appearances Draco Malfoy is having tea with Molly Weasley. Molly’s warm eyes then turn to Harry, pinning him down.
the ones he keeps in his coat pocket. Potter starts to snore, the lucky bastard. The owls surround Draco menacingly, and visions of Buckbeak flash before his eyes as he tries to distribute the Mouse-O’s without being ripped to shreds by talons. Lord, but owls can smell weakness.
“So, what did you want to talk about?” asks Harry, trying to sound unconcerned with limited success.
“Things have changed since then,” he says. “I’ve been having dreams about the future, and its not like I was a million miles away before. I had visions all the time.”
Draco stands, shuddering as her hands and arms rush through him when she doesn’t pull them back in time. “But you’re not a memory, you’re here now.”
They say their goodbyes and head back to Grimmauld Place. Harry’s not ready to tell them everything, but he doesn’t like keeping secrets from them, and he does need to talk. Sometimes he doesn’t know what he really thinks about something until he telling them. Sitting in the kitchen, holding his warm mug of tea like a shield or a talisman, he starts to talk.
Harry spent that night in the cupboard, too. Their nurse, Mrs Figg, locked him in. She bade him goodnight just as calmly as if she was tucking him into bed. The nurse didn’t tell him what he was being punished for, and she didn’t remark on the blood drying on face. Harry curled himself into a ball, hugging his knees. He told himself over and over that he wasn’t afraid of the dark.
“So,” says Zabini, with a sly grin on his handsome face. “I hear you’re having kinky sex with Draco.”
He pets Draco’s head, luxuriating in the feel of those silky strands under his calloused fingertips. Draco kisses a path further down, his hands joining in his exploration. He takes Harry’s nipple into his mouth, so lightly he almost can’t feel it. He does feel it, though.
He takes off his glasses and casts a temporary charm over his eyes. There's no point in fogged up glasses. Harry rinses the soot off in the shower for a minute while he runs his bath, wanting the warm water to be clean and fresh. He even adds some of the salts Hermione gave him last Christmas, the ones that claim to relax aching muscles, that he rarely bothers to use. Not that he has baths very often at all, but since Friday he can’t have a shower without becoming incredibly turned on, remembering Draco on his knees and against his back.
“Sorry,” he says, swinging his legs out of bed and rushing to open the window. “What are you doing here, Bunny? Couldn’t you find him?”
“I think I get it now. Sometimes I think I’ll never grow up because I never really got to be a child. Growing up it was all about the Malfoy name. My father wanted an heir, not a son.” Draco looks up at Harry, as if daring him to say something cruel.
“It could be fun. I had a few fantasies back in the day I wouldn’t mind trying out.” Draco’s tone is offhand, but there’s a tension in his voice he can’t hide.
He apparates outside the shop, and nearly knocks over a member of the crowd that’s gathered there. The jostled woman swings round, ready to tell him off, when her face lights up. “It’s him!”
He kisses Harry again and tries to ease him back down on the bed. Harry sighs into his mouth and lets him for a moment. Where did all his bravery go? It’s just sex. People do it all the time, even teenagers do it, why shouldn’t he? He’s twenty-six, not sixteen. It’s stupid to get so worked up over it. His resolve lasts until Terran’s dick presses against his stomach, and he flinches without meaning to. Terran doesn’t react, just keeps putting more of his weight onto Harry’s body, his fingers wandering back down between his legs.
The cat prods at Draco’s chest again, and thinking she’s trying to tell him something, Harry gently rolls Draco onto his back. She hops onto his chest, curls into a ball, and begins to purr. Harry runs his hand over her back- trying to encourage her, trying to comfort himself.  He can’t actually touch her, but she’s deathly cold. The heat from his own body leaks into her, fuelling her like coal in a furnace.
Maybe Malfoy has worked out who he is. Then again, he hasn’t given him much to reply to, so maybe he’s waiting for something more.
He’s not ready. He came here to ask Granny to look into his love life, like so many of her patrons do. It seems silly, but he doesn’t want to risk anything with Draco. All his Gryffindor bravery has gone out the window, and suddenly he feels like a first year, adding up the letters in their names on a piece of parchment to see if they’re compatible.
“You know,” says Harry, looking down to avoid knowing grey eyes, “My cousin used to cry all the time when we were kids. I could never understand it. He had everything he could ever want, he was spoiled rotten and my aunt babied him like anything, and he’d still cry.”
A small man in a dark green fedora reveals himself, and scurries closer. “Would you mind answering a few questions Mr Potter? It won’t take too long. Now, would you say Teddy Lupin is like a son to you? Have you been dating since the split from Miss Weasley? How would you describe your emotional state since-”
For about five minutes, Harry watches him bent over the pensieve. He’s vulnerable, unable to watch his back, and Harry realises he’s being trusted to protect him. Not that it’s likely they’ll be attacked in Harry’s bedroom, but he knows nearly everyone who lived through the war still thinks in this way. In terms of strategy, vulnerability, defence.
He lays his body over Harry’s, running his nose up his spine before placing a delicate kiss at the base of his neck, contrasting the heavy nudge of Malfoy’s cock against his thigh.
She shakes her head. “The whole Wizarding world is in a flap trying to work out why none of the ghosts are staying put anymore, but the no one’s connected the dots just yet. I’m sure the Ministry have their best and brightest on the case,” she says, flashing a wry smile over the rim of her cup. “So you have at least another decade before they cotton on.”
“What she said,” affirms Ron, before slowly shaking his head. “But really Harry, did it have to be Malfoy?”
He fucks Harry just as deeply and deliberately as always. Their mouths skate over each other, never really meeting a kiss but never leaving either. It’s only when Harry begins to whine under his breath that Draco finally speaks.
The dog begins to tug at Harry’s own trouser leg, this time with more success. He crouches down, and twists the collar around until he could read the tag.
Harry hisses through his teeth. The floor to ceiling windows that line one wall have all been blown out by a powerful blast. The mirrors that clad the opposite wall are completely shattered. Nearly everything is covered in a sticky black powder, like soot. He nearly takes out his wand to do a quick scan, but then remembers what Malfoy had said about it being cleared. Not wanting to waste time, he runs a finger over the wall, and sniffs the black residue that coats his finger. Mushrooms. The strange and distinctive smell of the infamous
Harry’s not sure how long they spend in the bath but it’s long enough that their skin is pink, their fingers are starting to prune, and the water is only lukewarm. They towel off lazily, trailing to the bedroom with their fingers loosely interlocked. The bed is still unmade from this morning, sheets bunched up and the pillows askew. Harry tugs him over to the bed, climbing on backwards and pulling Draco with him.
Dinner is both better and worse than Harry expected. Better, because there are no outright arguments or explosions. Worse, because he can feel the bubble of silence around Draco, everyone but Arthur and Molly doing their best to pretend he isn’t there. Better, because he’s sat next to him at the table, and he can nudge his leg against Draco’s in quiet support. Worse, because at one point his hand drops to Harry’s thigh and it makes him spill gravy down his jumper.
Malfoy fiddles with his beermat, playing with it like a spinning-top. He’s never still. His fingers are always in motion, his foot constantly tapping. Harry can’t remember him being like this before. At school he was so refined, moments of silliness and drama had to break through the years of grooming and expectation. Malfoys acted like Malfoys. The war seems to have stripped away the veneer of poise and formality and left a bruised young man behind.
Before Harry knows what’s happening, there’s a hand pulling his own out to the side and another at his waist. Instinctively, he rests his spare hand on Draco’s shoulder at the same time he starts to protest.
“I can see it on your face; You look shocked, eyes wide behind those ridiculous glasses. Your hair all messy from the fight, even messier than it normally is, and you’re panting. I lean down and whisper in your ear.”
“Once again: we don’t have to do it. We can keep doing what we have been, or you can- you can end it altogether if you want.” Draco clenches his fist, then forces himself to relax it one finger at a time. “As for why I want to do this with you…”
“You did so well, darling,” he mumbles into Harry’s skin. “I can’t believe you came without me touching you.”
He can’t bring himself to regret saying it. Yes, it feels almost like a confession. It feels a little too close to
“That’s okay,” he says, following her into the room. It’s even smaller than the last, almost a cupboard, and completely dominated by a huge purple armchair. Earl is wriggling in his arms, so Harry places him on the floor. Earl leaps onto his mistress’s lap, with a surprisingly large jump for such short legs.
Draco presses a kiss to his temple, his arms tightening around him. He doesn’t talk for a long time, and neither does Harry. They just sit there like that, on the floor, until Harry uncurls a little.
Harry gasps, feeling sensitive and a little embarrassed, now the high is wearing off. He really did let Draco say some ridiculous things to him. He squirms as Draco strokes at his inner walls, and thinks he wouldn’t mind if he kept saying them. Intuitive as ever, Draco obliges.
Not that he’s being completely unselfish, of course.  There’s still a nagging voice in the back of his head that says if he leaves Potter alone for too long, he’ll find someone else to give him what he needs. He knows it’s not forever, but he wants to cling to what he can get for as long as possible. Draco doesn’t like to dwell on what’ll happen when Potter gets bored- that’s a problem for another day. For now, he’ll just have to make sure he’s never boring.
“It’s odd, but I’ve never felt better in my life. Whatever it was you did, I’m completely healed. It seemed to really take it out of you, though.”
Harry lets out a moan of pure relief as he fucks himself down on Draco’s cock. After going so slowly for so long, things finally start to move fast. Draco meets him on every thrust, movements too frantic for their mouths to meet in a kiss.
Icy light bursts from the wand, something huge and soaring. He gets an impression of expansive wings and longs legs, before it fades between one moment and the next.
Maybe it’s just part of the game they’re playing, but it feels like more than that. For the first time, Harry wonders if Draco isn’t a little fucked up about sex, too. He’s still inside him, not soft yet, and he jerks Harry with a merciless pace. He kisses him like he wants to climb inside him and never leave, and despite his confusion, Harry comes too.
“Hello,” greets Draco. He doesn’t say ‘Hello, Potter’ or even ‘Hello, darling’. Maybe he’s just as unsure as Harry as to where they stand right now.
The house is empty of ghosts when he returns, but Bunny’s waiting on the rooftop, and flies down to land on his shoulder as he unlocks the front door. “Are you waiting for a reply?” he asks.
“Look, I’m not convinced you haven’t done something to Harry,” he says. “And it’s not just because it’s you. He says he told you about what happens when he tries to have sex, and you had an idea that helped him. Didn’t say what it was, though.” Weasley takes a deep breath, and continues. “It just seems too simple. Too sudden. I can’t believe that he’s fine having sex with you, a man he’s hated for years, and not someone he loves.”
Draco snorts. “Sorry. It’s just that at one point, I’d have said that thinking must be a new pastime for you. Funny how things change.”
At some point Draco seems to have slipped into present tense. It looks like that fantasy isn’t as distant as he pretended. He reaches behind him and guides that thumb further down until it brushes at his hole. Draco’s eyes darken, and he dips inside.
He nods, and climbs off Draco’s lap, legs wobbling somewhat. He holds a hand out to help pull Draco up, making him smile. Potter’s about as sturdy as a dandelion clock right now. He’ll blow away in the slightest breeze. Draco takes the hand anyway, though he gets up under his own steam. His own legs aren’t all that steady, but he’s still more stable than Potter. But then, he’s not been folded up in someone’s lap for millennia.
I've edited the layout since I realised I'd messed up how the notes worked, so hopefully the warnings should be in the right places now. I'd love to hear from you, this is the most explicit thing I've ever written so some feedback would be especially appreciated!
He’s close now, and he cups the back of Potter’s head to keep him still. Draco’s looking into Potter’s eyes as he comes, and it’s more honest, more intimate, than he intends it to be. The more time he spends with Potter the more he expects him to point his finger accusingly and shout ‘You’re in love with me!’. Anyone who wasn’t such a sweet little idiot with no self-esteem would have worked it out already.
Draco shakes his head and pulls their foreheads together. “It’s not sad,” he whispers. “It’s perfect.”
They make their way back over to Draco and Angus together. The older man Jake and Tabby had been talking to earlier seems to have claimed Harry’s seat.
Granny spreads he arms in satisfaction. “Excellent! Only time will tell how right you are, but I think we’re on the right track. Now, your turn. Try to think about what each shape represents to you, not what it’s supposed to mean.”
When the Prophet arrives that Monday, all hell breaks loose. A picture of him and Terran at a party takes up the whole of the front page, except for the blaring headline: ‘The Chosen One Chooses Chastity’. Snappy. Alliterative. Absolutely fucking horrifying.  He looks closer at the picture. It was taken at a private party- no press would have been allowed in. His heart squeezes. Terran wouldn’t go to the papers; he doesn’t need the money. Harry should trust him more than that.
He rubs at the seal of his lips where they’re wrapped around Draco’s prick. “I want everyone to see what a whore you are for me.”
Harry takes another sip, slower this time, prepared for the sickly-sweet burn. His limbs feel loose, and all he wants to do is kiss that sneer off of Draco’s mouth. It makes him look younger. Like a version of him he knew a long time ago. Instead, he settles for laying his hand over Draco’s where it rests on his stomach.
Potter picks at the duvet cover, pulling at invisible snags. “The next one’s tomorrow. Do you want to come?”
Harry runs to his side. His blond head is faced towards the ground, expression blank. Harry drops to his knees beside him. For a moment, one moment too long, Harry thinks he’s dead.
He reels Harry back in. Minutes are lost in the press of lips and tongues and hands. This time, it is Malfoy who pulls back.
‘Darling’ is something he’s called partners before, and when he uses it on Potter it’s sincerely meant, but it’s not the same as calling him sweetheart. It feels so sugary soft, that if Potter wasn’t so deep in subspace, he’d know for certain that something was wrong. At this point, he might as well just give in and call him Harry, if he’s going to be throwing around words like
Harry grabs his hand, moving it away from his face, and kisses his knuckles. Their hands look so good together, warm and cold contrasted. Suddenly Harry wishes he could stand back, out of his body, and watch them. But then, he wouldn’t be able to look Draco in the eye, and see how full of need they are.
“Could you be a little more specific?” he says, giving in to Earl’s demands and stooping over to fuss him.
“And since when has a crush been the end of the world? Sometimes you’re attracted to people you’d never normally think were your type, but it just works. I mean, I liked you and you’re a right ugly bastard.”
“You know,” points out Hermione. “Xander Pixberry might have more catches to his name, but  Camen King hasn’t been around nearly as long, and has nearly as many.”
He sits alone in the same slightly sticky booth as last time nursing his beer and his bad mood for over an hour. Eventually Draco sidles, as elegantly as possible in the circumstances, into the opposite seat. Neither spoke at first, Harry staring into the bottom of his glass and Draco squinting at his face.
Draco talks about the renovation he’s being doing to the Manor, but Harry is only half listening. Part of him is wondering how to explain his request, and the other is just watching his long fingers as they move through the air. Harry gets on well enough by nodding along, and making small comments, then Draco begins to lead him towards a part of the Manor he’s never seen before. Down yet another set of stairs, these even narrower and timeworn than the last, is a small room. It looks like the engine room of a ship, if that ship had been built by mad space pirates. The walls and floor are earthen, but small pipes of every metal spread and interlock across them like a lace cage. Snaking along the floor, the pipes feed into a contraption in the middle of the room. It has wheels and knobs and cylinders, and none of them seem to belong to the same machine. Glowing from within, is a soft yellow light. It hums, and the energy coming from it makes the small room hot.
Harry grins. “I don’t know exactly who’s coming, but Zabini’s usually there, and Millie and Hermione are pretty good mates now.”
Harry nearly chokes on his drink. “It’s so weird to hear you say ‘dick’. I thought you’d call them something weird and posh.”
Harry gulps deep breaths of air, Draco’s weight putting pressure on his lungs. “Draco, you’re crushing me.”
Harry thinks of Fred and George apparating downstairs for breakfast after they got their licence, and the memory of his lost friend stings. “How can you not, with a house this big?”
Harry stumbles over the rug in front of the fireplace, just like he’s done every Sunday for the past six years. The rug never moves, and Harry never remembers. He doesn’t normally mind it, it’s practically tradition now. Except that, this time when he tips forward and throws out an arm to balance himself, someone catches him. The hands are strong where they grip him round his forearm and his waist, and they don’t let go immediately. Instead, they squeeze tighter in shock. Half standing from his seat on the sofa with a cup of tea spilling onto his lap, is Draco.
He opens his eyes as Draco pulls away, and he looks… wrecked. His eyes are wide, and full of something harsh and possessive. His mouth is open, panting, with a dribble of come at the corner of his sore red lips. “Don’t you dare apologise.”
Draco huffs. “That’s why mother never let me play it. Still, Vince and Greg and I used to come here and play it for hours in the summer when she was at her charity lunches. Barely any of it got eaten even then, and since the gardener got scared off they’re all diseased and inedible anyway.” Draco sticks his nose in the air in a gesture that while it once would have been genuine, now feels teasing. “Besides, I’ve been looking for an excuse to hit you.”
Harry opens his eyes, and jolts uprights, pulling the covers up to his neck. Narcissa Malfoy stands over him, looking almost exactly as he remembered.
He hoists Harry’s legs over his shoulders, bending him in half, past the point he thinks his body can physically go. He fucks into Harry in one go, before holding still. Kissing Harry, open mouthed, he catches Draco’s moan with his tongue. He’s buried deep inside, unmoving, and Harry tries to grind back onto him. Draco scrapes his nails up the back of his thighs, against the grain of the dark hair, leaving red lines behind.
The next day Draco knocks back a hangover potion and floos to Malfoy Manor. He can’t afford to laze about in bed feeling sorry for himself, as much as he wants to. After last night, he needs to assess the damage. Granger finding out is a disaster. Maybe Potter will be too ashamed of Draco to continue, or maybe he’ll be too bull-headed to care what they think. For once, he crosses his fingers and hopes Potter’s Gryffindor tendencies win out.
When Potter’s had half the bottle, he drinks the rest himself. Draco’s sweaty and overheated in his clothes, and starting to feel a little disgusting.
. But he’d never be able to hide that from Simi. He could say he’d gotten someone to fix it, but they’d want to help him pay, and then he’d be back where he started.
“Daphne. Though I later discovered her real name was Hippolyta, when I looked into some family history.” Malfoy meets his eyes straight on for the first time that day. “I don’t want anything done to this room.”
Thursday morning is spent in the park, and filled with mounting panic. Earl keeps doubling back to check on him, sensing something is wrong. Why did he tell Malfoy he’d be at the funeral? It sounds like there’ll be very few people there, it’ll be so easy to work out who his ‘mystery pen pal’ is. The minute Malfoy realises who’s been writing to him, he’ll stop for good. He’d called him a moron not two days ago- there’s definitely still some bad blood there.
And isn’t that just hilarious? Isn’t that just the icing on the cake of his life? Because Harry Potter is in love with Draco Malfoy, and he has no idea what to do about it. He isn’t exactly sure what Draco feels for him, aside from this vague ‘caring’, but love is too much to hope for. It’s too soon. He can’t expect him to fall as fast as Harry has.
2: I'm already planning another fic, but I haven't started writing it. It's a Jane Eyre AU, because it was my favourite book as a maudlin eight year old and it fits scarily well with the characters, so I'd love to hear what people think about that. If no ones interested, I have other ideas on the back burner.
Mr Filch shakes his head. “Such ingratitude to your benefactors. Do you know where you would be, if your aunt and uncle hadn’t taken you in? The streets, or the poorhouse, that’s where you’d be.”
Draco’s voice becomes more clipped, polished, a hasher version of himself coming to the fore. “That’s right Potter, take it. You were made to be fucked.”
She shakes her head. “Kindness is a skill too, duckie. You could have left Earl where he was, but you didn’t. You’re a good person. That’s something more to be proud of than killing old what’s-his-face.”
Draco soon discovered something that disturbed him; he was bored. Currently, Draco didn’t have a job so much as a lucrative hobby. He developed cosmetic potions. It had started in fifth year, when he’d modified a bottle of Sleekeazy’s to stop it turning the hair greasy afterwards, and given it to Pansy for her birthday. Pansy had demanded more and more convoluted concoctions ever since, and he’d gotten rather good at it. Then, when Pansy received compliments on her makeup, her hair, her perfume, she naturally sent people his way. All in all, he’d hardly needed to touch the family vaults since he bought the cottage.
Granny’s shop is empty when he arrives, of both customers and Granny herself. Earl is there, and he greets him as enthusiastically as ever. He looks into the back room, but that’s empty too. There’s a twisting flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor. Presumably that’s where she lives.
He groans, and crashes his lips against Harry’s like a wave onto the rocks. Draco didn’t say that he couldn’t kiss back, only that he couldn’t touch, so Harry gives as good as he gets. Clutching at his own wrists, he opens his mouth for Draco’s tongue. He licks into Harry’s mouth for just a second, before reaching behind Harry to take his hands and pull them between their chests. Still holding onto him, Draco walks them backwards, pushing him back onto the bed. The mattress bounces when he falls and Harry huffs a laugh. Then he sees the hungry look on Draco’s face. The giddy feeling is quickly overtaken by lust, and the need to give this man whatever he wants.
The next day, disaster strikes. If there’s a less melodramatic way of putting it, Draco can’t think of it. Monday’s
“I said I was raised in a cult, which is true, I suppose. Most of the unusual things I said could be explained away like that.”
If Draco thought he was angry before, that’s nothing compared to how he feels when Terran says “Why? We were finally getting somewhere.”
I've made some edits now I've got the hang of things, which will hopefully make the spacing and a few other details more readable!
He feels feverish. He closes his eyes. Draco whispers in his ear “If you save my life again I’m going to have to kill you.”
He still saw Simi every week, on top of the times they ran into each other at the bar. They tended not to spend too much time together there, not wanting to give the impression of being a couple and hamper their efforts at pulling. Instead, they usually went to the park. It turned out Draco was a little frightened of dogs, which Simi found hilarious. For some reason, the dogs kept coming up to him, jumping up and leaving muddy pawprints on his clean trousers.
“No one but the Aurors and the Curse Breakers,” answers Malfoy. “Nothing here is dangerous anymore, except for some unstable walls, but it’s still not what it used to be. Even if it was, it would need extensive renovation to be used for our purposes.”
“They won’t come in,” says Granny, emerging from the back room. “They didn’t like it when they tried.”
Hermione sighs. “I know it’s hard, it’s hard for all of us, but you need to go outside sometime.” She props herself up on her elbow to narrows her eyes at him. “Are the ghosts still following you?”
Harry intends to make a quick escape, but with two full glasses and a bottle of beer to contend with, it’s not looking likely.
Pulling out the cork, he lets three drops fall on his tongue. Like a poison, it’s completely tasteless, designed for the unsuspecting. Truly, he thinks this might be the evilest potion. Draught of the Living Death. Amortentia. Both are contenders, to be sure. But if you ask Draco, verituserum takes the cake.
Malfoy finds him in the afternoon, repairing wooden beams in the attic. These weren’t damaged during the war, just neglected, but they were important enough structurally that he doesn’t want to leave them too long. He’s standing on a folding ladder, when a voice startles him.
what you took from this?” asks Draco incredulously. “Of course that’s not what I’m saying. In the past week I’ve drunk more cups of tea than I have in my life, just because you made them.”
Harry shrugs. “Why him? Maybe because he doesn’t put pressure on me, or expect things from me. Maybe because he looks after me, even when he doesn’t have to. Maybe because he cares about me more than he does about getting off. Why not you? Because you didn’t care whether I was enjoying myself, whether I wanted you, whether I was scared- you just wanted to fuck me.”
“It’s okay,” says Harry. “I’m here.” Kneeling down, he clasps his pale hand, but it’s cold and limp. He squeezes it anyway. “You’re going to be okay, Draco.” If he’s talking, that has to mean he’s okay. He has to be, because Harry loves him. Because he can’t lose him twice in one day.
“Not exactly, but I think he’s more comfortable talking about other people’s feelings than his own, you know?”
“It says you can see the future, and you’re working here. There’s a lot of wild speculation, but that’s about the size of it.”
Angus looks over in the direction of the bathroom, where Draco and Simi still haven’t emerged. “He’s a good dom, isn’t he?”
Upstairs is a small flat, comprised of one room containing the kitchen, the living room and the bedroom, and a door to what must be the bathroom. Granny is in bed, surrounded by tissues and looking sorry for herself. “Harry,” she wheezes, “You haven’t caught me at my best, I’m afraid.”
“No,” says Potter, his voice so small it makes Draco want to wrap him in a blanket and keep him there forever. “It’s not okay, I can’t do it.”
“Everyone expects me to be a hero, to have answers, to know what to do. I don’t know anything, I don’t even know what to do with myself.”
Harry sighs. Draco’s given him an unpleasant reminder. He’s supposed to be doing this as a way to make things work with Terran, and yet if he could wave his wand and have him be the one holding him instead of Draco, he doesn’t think he’d do it. Guilt pools hot and sour in his gut. He tries to picture Terran washing his hair, drying him, minutes after whispering filth into his ear. He can do it, but the picture doesn’t look right. His face blurs, hair turns paler. Terran turns back into Draco whenever he tries. But. But he doesn’t have relationship with Draco. Right now, he doesn’t have one with Terran either, but he could. Harry loved him- loves him. Why can’t he remember that?
He holds out his hand and, tentatively, Harry takes it. He side-alongs them to a bedroom that looks like it’s seen more recent use that the Edwardian era, and pulls Harry to sit with him on the bed.
Harry takes a cautious sip. It somehow manages to taste both like soap and Sunday dinner. He gags slightly.
and says “I know I made it sound simple before, but after you left, I was thinking about what you told me about going away sometimes. How will I know if it happens?”
’s rank for years now, and it’s slow going for someone with her reputation, but she’s finally making headway. That reminds him:
Just saying her name bowls Draco under a riptide of memory. He hears his own voice as if from underwater, as he tells Harry a story.
Weasley is shaking out his hand, eyebrows bunched in a frown. He hopes he’s broken it, the stupid git.
Harry clenches his fists, and wills his eyes dry. Malfoy gets closer, close enough to see the state he’s in.
“There doesn’t have to be a clear-cut answer, and not everyone’s reasons are the same. My dad was a man’s man, and a raging bigot. Growing up, it was all ‘boys don’t cry’ and ‘don’t be such a pussy’’. I tried to be the person he wanted, and when I realised I was gay it made me so fucking scared. But I wasn’t allowed to be scared of anything, yeah? The only thing I was allowed to feel was anger.”
Harry rests his cheek on Teddy’s downy head. “We were all idiots back then. You were just more of an idiot than most.”
him. He can’t breathe, he can’t speak. He shoves roughly at Draco’s shoulder and springs from the bed, clutching at the bedpost for support. He’s breathing faster and faster, so why does it feel like he’s getting no air? Perhaps someone cast a curse to remove all the oxygen from the room.
“Yes,” she continues. “You were a little white dragon, and I had to carry you around in a teacup because you kept flying in circles and making yourself dizzy.”
indeed. Harry might not hate Malfoy anymore, but it’s clear that it’s not a two way street. Still, if that had been coming from a friend, it might have counted as banter. As for the business with the owl, Harry grins a sneaky grin, and begins to compose his reply.
Blaise gives Draco a conspiratorial look. “It’s all part of her new thing. It’s like she thinks if we all call her Millie, everyone will think that Millicent Bullstrode from school was some other girl, who never put Hermione Granger in a headlock.”
“I don’t,” says Malfoy, raising his eyebrows in what Harry is coming to recognise as his signature move. He doesn’t think he did that in school, but then he was always sneering. “But as the master of the house, I still get ward alerts.”
She bustles away, leaving them stranded. They sit down on the sofa, with Teddy as a barrier between them. Malfoy fiddles with a button on his cuff, and Harry clears his throat.
Harry swallowed. If this was a relative, he didn’t see much familial resemblance. Then again, Aunt Petunia and himself looked nothing alike, either. Harry resolved to let the man speak before he made any judgements. He was determined to like this man, to go away with him and never see the Dursley’s again.
A complex set of emotions drift across Malfoy’s face, one after the other, before settling into his usual mask of cool detachment. “Be that as it may, I treat my sexual partners with at least basic respect.”
Weasley’s jaw is set firm. “So. How many times have you, a cowardly ferret of a Death Eater, fucked my best friend?”
“Sit down,” says Draco gently, pulling him down to sit on his knees. Not straddling, but with his back half against the armrest and half against Draco’s chest, legs draping across him.
God, he is a freak. Why would someone want to be treated like that? Why couldn’t he have vanilla sex with his boyfriend but he can have kinky, twisted sex with his childhood nemesis? Is he so fucked up that he can’t have normal sex? Then again, the sex he had with Draco was pretty normal in the beginning. Obviously the dirty talk did more to him that it might have to another, more well-adjusted person, but it wasn’t so far out of the ordinary. So, he
Three days after the disaster with Terran, he goes to Sunday lunch at the Weasley’s. Aside from the three eldest Weasley brothers, Fleur and Victoire, the whole family is there. Teddy is running around the garden after the puppy Andromeda relented and bought him for his sixth birthday. Molly is conducting an orchestra of pots and spoons with her wand. Everyone else is huddled round the fire.
Harry doesn’t comment, just watches Malfoy trace through his memories, feeling his voice vibrate where he’s holding Harry to him.
“Whisky, please. Jura if they have it.” Potter raises his eyebrows, and Draco smirks. “Don’t give me that look, Potter; I don’t drink beer and I know you’re loaded.”
She nods. “Don’t worry about the watch. I’m just glad everyone’s alright.” She turns stern eyebrows onto the young woman. “Including my niece.”
Six months after he had his wand back, Draco moved out. Simi had another friend who was looking for somewhere to live, and he saw the opportunity for what it was. Simi made Draco promise that they would try and see each other at least once a week, and so far he’d managed to keep it.
Draco lies down on the bed, on his side, leaving space for Harry to join him. Harry, who wants noting more than to be held again, does exactly that. Draco smooths his hands down Harry’s arms, up his back, over his hair, until his breathing is normal again.
for the second time that week, so he has to find another way to distract himself. Maybe he could take out his grief and frustration on the grimy walls of the ballroom? Harry had made a start on them two days before, but there is still plenty to do. It’s late, but he’s been given access, and no one lives there anymore.
Draco slips his wand out from where he keeps it secured with a charm inside his sleeve, casting the necessary spells. He doesn’t cast the one for lube yet though, instead tapping two fingers over Harry’s lips, the pretty peach nail varnish glinting in the light.
Earl attempts to hide behind his legs. Harry picks him up and strokes his head. “Don’t worry, nothing to be scared of.”
They make their way out of the pub, feeling Granger’s keen eyes on him. He looks back, and Potter’s head is still on the table. He’s going to have a beast of a hangover tomorrow, and it’s mostly Draco’s fault. Also, Potter’s friends have found out he’s fucking a Death Eater, and that’s his fault, too. Merlin, but Draco’s a bastard. He can never do anything right. He could never be what Potter needs. What was he thinking, coming here? He was thinking of himself, as usual.
Despite his pronouncement that Draco was going to be fine, Harry’s still himself worried. If he’s going to save Draco’s life, then it has to be in danger in the first place. Granny suggests she read Draco’s cards, if it would put Harry’s mind at ease.  As soon as he leaves the shop, Harry finds himself apparating in front of Malfoy Manor’s gates. He’d caught a glimpse of it yesterday, over the high brick walls of the orchard, but only from a distance. He hadn’t been inside since the night Dobby was killed. The night Hermione was tortured, Draco refused to identify him, and Harry took his wand. That night was the final nail in Voldemort’s coffin, though it never really felt like it.
Luna walks into the room, barefoot but fully dressed in orange and yellow polka dot dungarees. “Oh hello, Harry. I thought you might be Rufus, we’re planning an expedition you see, and there’s still so much to do.”
She begins to back away. Teeth bared, back arched, the cat pounces. It lands on her chest, before sinking in, disappearing into her body. She gasps. Crumples. Her knees hit the ground hard. The woman wheezes, her lungs rattling.
“Hello, gorgeous,” he says, running his fingers down the tawny feathers of her back. She rolls her head, preening, but her leg is conspicuously bare. “No letter for me today?”
“I want you inside me all the time, always want to be full of you. Want to be good for you, make you feel good too.”
I probably should have called this fic 'Let's Talk About Sex', because that's what about a third of this fic is. However, I'm committed to at least of semblance of realism, so there we are.
There are customers in the shop when he arrives. There’s a woman in the waiting room flicking through the archaic issue of Witch Weekly, and a man’s voice is coming from the back room. Earl Grey’s sleeping in a patch of sunlight slanting through the window, curled up like a cat.
In the living room, Malfoy sits bolt upright on the sofa with Teddy on his lap, holding him by his armpits and staring him at with an expression of terror. “Aunt Andromeda, I’m really not any good at-” He cuts himself off, staring at Harry with a look of blank horror. He quickly schools his expression.
They laugh, and Harry manages to drop the conversation. He’s gotten the bulk of it off his chest, and Hermione’s given him something to think about. If he does manage to get Terran back, does he even still want him? He’s been so wrapped up in Draco that he’s barely thought about him. Harry feels a little guilty again. He thinks he loves him, but what if he doesn’t? What if he was just so desperate for a normal relationship that he pinned all his hopes on one man and refused to consider anything else, even when it wasn’t working?
“Yeah,” he agrees, voice cracking a little. “I can’t exactly compare him to anyone else, but- He takes care of me.”
Potter slurps at his bright blue drink that tastes sort of like lemons, sort of like mouthwash. Draco knows, because he’s got the exact same concoction.
“Yes and no,” she sighs. “Portraits capture the memory of a person. Think of it like a house. Houses absorb what you put into them, and develop their own form of sentience from that. Decks gain a life of their own from being read over and over, the energy of their reader bleeding into them over time. Once there’s a base level of thought and feeling, they go their own way. So, more like a child than a house, now I think about it.”
He steps away, and Harry can breath again. Of course. Of course it was something so simple as fixing his hair. It just didn’t feel simple to him. Draco didn’t see him that way, had only just stopped hating him, and he didn’t deserve to have his newfound friendliness be misconstrued.
What Zabini calls ‘jeans’ turn out to be washed-out charcoal denims, tight enough to make Harry blush.
Zabini looks startled into the fire, then into his wine glass, then back at the fire. “Potter, is that you?”
“It’s nothing to worry about,” he says. “Since Mrs Malfoy died, Draco’s on his own, and she asked me to look out for him.”
He splutters as Draco begins to sweep them round in lazy, looping circles. Harry doesn’t stumble again, but no one could call him graceful. He remembers the basics from the Yule ball and the handful of events he’s been forced to take a compulsory turn around the floor at, but he’s never really improved.
Eventually, Millicent sighs. “I’d better be off; I’ve got work tomorrow. Why we do this on Wednesday nights I’ll never know.”
Looking in the mirror, Draco makes a face. He’s completely wrecked. Draco’s shirt is crumpled, matching the deep creases in his trousers from where Harry gripped them. His hair is mussed, strands sticking damply to his forehead. One of his earrings has fallen out, and his lips are red and swollen.
Draco manhandles him into position, pushing his head down to lie on Draco’s shoulder, resting the book on his back. This position would be comfortable, domestic, if it weren’t for the dick that’s so hot and hard inside him. Harry settles down, breathing deeply. He lets go; Draco will decide when to fuck him, not Harry. It doesn’t matter that his body is screaming for release. All that matters is being good, and still, and quiet.
“Can you help him?” asks Harry. It’s a long shot, he’s not even sure what this cat is. A ghost, a Patronus, a memory? But things have been so strange with ghosts lately, he might as well try.
“And it’s pretty much exactly what I suspected,” Hermione continues. “Dying and coming back has changed things. You’re like a walking piece of death.”
Harry opens the fridge and pulls out two ice cold cans of beer. “Quick thinking. What are you getting her?
As usual, Draco wakes up first. He blinks up at the ceiling, wondering how it got to a point where they have a ‘usual’. His head is pounding but he barely feels it, memory flooded with images of last night. For once, he doesn’t have to drag Harry into consciousness.
Harry has never felt pretty. At a stretch, attractive. Molly sometimes call him handsome. He never got to choose what he wore as a child, then when he did have money to buy his own clothes he was almost always in uniform. So, he sticks with the same things he always wears. T-shirt, jeans, trainers. He doesn’t move like Draco, doesn’t lean with his hip cocked out in the way drags your eyes down his body. Harry had never felt pretty until Draco whispered it in his ear. He wants to feel it again.
Draco foregoes his usual waistcoat; he wants to seem at ease, even if he’s feeling the very opposite. He slides a few delicate silver rings onto his fingers, knowing how they catch in the light and draw attention to his hands. Potter likes his hands. Draco’s seen how he stares at them, and he can’t help but want to tease him a little. Maybe it will help distract him from that hideous prick of an ex, if Draco riles him up a bit.
“Well, its only part of the plan. And its not about whether or not you can afford it- it’s a gift,” says Harry.
“Tomorrow,” she says, throwing him a set of keys. “Now, lock up for me will you? Earl will be fine on his own for a few hours.”
“Mostly vodka,” answers Draco, before continuing. “It’s only a minute’s walk from here, so we won’t be carrying them long.”
Draco is back in the attic, tinkering with the wards, his frustrated cursing and crows of satisfaction filtering softly down the stairs from time to time. It feels so comfortable, like things could be easy between them. When Harry is so sick of books he has to take of his glasses and rub at his aching eyes, he decides to go and see what’s happening upstairs for himself. As he ascends, he hears the sound of low voices. Two voices.
At twenty-four he gave in and told Ron and Hermione about his problem. Hermione wondered if it was the loss of control that bothered him, after having so little control over his life growing up. That was close, but still didn’t seem quite right. Harry thought that trust might have more to do with it. He decided not to try and have sex again until he was in a serious relationship with someone he trusted.
“What’s wrong, mate? Are you going to be sick? ‘Cause if you are do me a favour and throw up in that horrible vase Mum got us for Christmas.”
When Harry helped rebuild Hogwarts, he found a passion he didn’t know he had. Restoring magical buildings. It didn’t come to him naturally; it wasn’t like the first time he rode a broom. Nor was it like pulling teeth the way learning Occlumency had been. It was much more like Remus teaching him to cast a Patronus. It was hard, but necessary, so he pushed through until he got results. And the results were life changing. He understood Hogwarts, his first home, like he never had before. Harry found he could communicate with the castle, that magical buildings grew more and more sentient over time, and could cooperate with their own restoration. Harry was hooked. He could take something beautiful and wondrous and damaged, and he could heal it. And now, he has to heal the Manor.
Draco’s smile grows even more suggestive, then abruptly dims, his face serious once again. “I still can’t make a corporeal Patronus. I only get mist, if that.”
Simi’s mother was an odd woman, though well meaning, and she was convinced Simi and Draco were a couple. Several times Simi gave pitch perfect renditions of the speeches their mother gave.
Harry looks away. He’s right. Terran should be able to talk to his own friends about his relationship. Who is Harry to tell him otherwise?
His orgasm comes without warning, Draco’s mouth hot and wet around him. He screws his eyes shut even tighter, holding his breath. Draco’s hands flex, then stroke up and down the back of his thighs, before squeezing his arse.
Malfoy continues. “So, you’re scared of topping. That doesn’t actually mean you like the idea of getting fucked. Tell me Potter, what do you think about when you touch yourself?”
“Not with all that running around,” says Andromeda. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s steam coming out of his ears when he comes in for dinner.”
Stepping out of the fireplace and into the Weasley abode, it becomes clear that while Harry alerted Molly and Arthur, the rest of the clan were still in the dark. Scanning his eyes across the shocked faces, he resigns himself to using first names. He can’t call all of them ‘Weasley’.
Hermione whacks her husband in the arm, but he can’t say she looks pleased to see him either. Polite, and oddly curious, but definitely not pleased. Fortunately, Molly and Arthur look delighted, and Harry gives him a sheepish smile.
He winds his way through the busy pub and over to the group, sitting down in the squashy booth next to Luna.
“Good,” replies Draco, before turning to Harry. “You have no idea how helpful it is to have someone who had a hand in making the wards here to talk to. Besides, she’s definitely one of my more likeable ancestors.”
Harry’s heart beats faster, braced for any number of shattering things to come out of Draco’s mouth.
Harry picks up the dog-eared book, and brings it to her. He hadn’t noticed, but then Hermione always said he wasn’t the most observant.
This is the second time he’s called him by his first name, and both times it was when Harry was being a nutjob. It’s nice. He sort of wishes he’d do it more. Then again, he’s only called him Draco during sex, so they’re probably even.
He’s certainly paying him handsomely to work on the Manor, though he knows he’s given Arthur a discounted rate. The wages come from the vault he and Arthur set up for the Centre, rather than Draco directly, which helps eliminate some of the awkwardness. It also helps that technically Arthur’s the one who hired him- it would be weird if he was Potter’s employer.
A gravelly voice, slightly tinny as it filters through the phone, fills the room. “This was supposed to be a quick call, but now I’m tempted to drag it out.”
Zabini swings his legs of the sofa, violently displacing Millie’s feet and making her squawk in protest, so that he’s facing Harry directly. “Is this about Draco?”
He’s decided not to tell them about the breakup with Terran just yet. If everything goes to plan, then they won’t be broken up long enough to worry them about it. Ergo, he can’t tell them about Malfoy, or they’ll think he’s been cheating. Surprisingly, he finds that he wants to tell them. He needs all that weirdness to spill out onto the table so Hermione can dissect it, force it to make sense.
Potter wraps his arms around Draco, and sighs. “Maybe it wasn’t nothing, but it wasn’t enough for me to act like that.”
His eyes somehow become darker and softer at the same time. “Speaking of, let’s avoid doing it here. As exciting as exhibitionism can be, Arthur Weasley also has access to the manor, and I don’t think either of us want to include him.”
Draco makes sandwiches. The bread is thick and raggedly cut but they’re full of chicken, bacon, and mayonnaise. Harry groans in relief, he’d had no idea how hungry he was. Draco gives him an odd look, probably wondering how anyone could be so ill mannered even when eating a sandwich. Sauce drips out of the end of the sandwich and splats onto the polished table. Draco says nothing, but vanishes the puddle with a pointed slash of his wand. It looks like Narcissa passed her intolerance for mess and dirt onto her son.
He nuzzles his nose into Harry’s neck, breathing him in. He follows the same path with his mouth then, just brushing his lips over skin. Harry sags into his arms, letting out a low hum. He smiles, and he knows Harry can feel it against his neck. Draco licks a deliberate stripe up the cord of muscle, before resting his teeth gently either side of the muscle. Harry shivers. An image flashes in his mind, of a hunting dog Pansy had as a child. Its job was to retrieve the birds the hunting party blasted from the sky, and her father scolded her for treating it like a pet. Nether the less, they liked to take her out with them as they explored the grounds of Parkinson Hall. Once, the dog returned from the undergrowth with something held proudly in her mouth. It was a chick, unharmed and cheeping, held ever so gently in her teeth. Draco smirks to himself. Who ever thought he’d be comparing himself to a dog, subconsciously or not?
“It has to be applied directly,” he says, biting his lip as he reads the label. He doesn’t need to, he made it after all, but for some reason he can’t look Potter in the eyes. “Do you want me to do it, or…”
Draco suspects that’s an understatement. He’s always downplaying his own pain, be that physical or emotional.
“You don’t have to do anything. I’ll be fine, you don’t need to- look after me, or anything. Normally I’d say you could just leave, but this is your house, so.”
Ron starts to laugh, but seeing the look on Harry’s face, stops just as suddenly. “Are you serious?”
What did happen? He was fine one minute, and he’d just been very thoroughly and roughly fucked, but Draco putting his nipple in his mouth sends him running for the hills? It’s not like it’s something that’s been a problem for him before, either. Terran did it a few times. In fact, the last time-
He opens the tin and a pungent aroma hits him like heat from an open oven. He feels his stomach flip as he remembers Draco’s hair ticking his nose as they fell out of the bar, clinging onto each other for support. He’d smelled a lot like this. Harry shakes himself off and goes to fetch mugs, changing course when Granny directs him towards small cups instead.
“From about fifth year, but sixth year it really got out of hand.” Draco grins, and his teeth look sharp, dangerous. “I still hated you, you understand, but I’d wank to the thought of our fights ending a little differently.”
For the first time in weeks, Harry doesn’t dream. They lay curled towards each other like brackets, Draco’s pale head only just poking out from under the covers. They only slept last night. Draco had conjured himself a toothbrush, and Harry had given him some pyjamas to wear. He usually just slept in his boxers so they were practically new, but Draco’s wrists and ankles stuck out awkwardly. It was adorable.
Zabini cackles. “Oh, that’s brilliant. One day you’re defeating dark wizards with the power of friendship and just-shagged hair, and a few years down the line, you’re like a teenage girl who can’t find a dress for the Yule ball.”
I miss going to parties so badly I want to smash a plate. Even more dialogue heavy chapter than usual, but such is the nature of socialising.
He dashes off, already mentally kicking himself. What a way to seem relaxed and not at all like he just fell out of the floo and on top the man he’s been fucking, whom Arthur and Molly apparently adore but everyone else loathes, and Harry is very confused about all round. He shuts himself in the bathroom, splashing water on his face. Gripping the sink, he stares accusatorily the mirror.
Finch-Fletchely shakes his head bemusedly. “My dreams are always about sitting exams I haven’t studied for, or my teeth falling out.” He sighs, and sticks his hand out. “Anyway, hullo Malfoy. It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
The problem is, the complications between him and Harry can’t really be explained in muggle terms. He tried, but there’s no number of vague allusions that can replace an entire war.
“Ron, the Weasley’s. I’d never had it until I came to Hogwarts, the Dursley’s were more full English types.” He tucks into the food, and hums in appreciation.
The only people he’s ever called ‘sir’ are professors, ministers. Uncle Vernon. It speaks of authority, and despite his general bravery, a little bit of fear. He’s not scared of Draco, and he certainly has no sexual feelings about his uncle, so he’s not worried about that. But the idea of giving Draco that authority turns him on. He wants Draco to have power over him. Even more so, he wants him to abuse that power.
Earl runs round the edge of the lake barking at the geese and chasing them into the water. His hatred of getting wet is the only thing stopping him from following them in. Harry throws bits of stale bread for the mallards and swans, while Teddy claps his chubby hands together in delight. From the bushes, he hears a quiet click. He turns towards the noise, and a camera flashes in his face.
“Did you think I would fly off the handle just because Malfoy wrote you a letter?” asks Ron, incredulous.
Draco sits down in the conjured chair, and touches a hand to his temple, before pushing his hair out of his eyes. “You’re a Seer, then, as well as the Chosen One.” There’s no lingering malice when he sighs “You just can’t help being special can you?”
Draco’s lips pull into a self-deprecating smile, quite without his permission. “Yes, well, not all of us could be the youngest seeker in a hundred years. I needed something to do on the weekends.”
They wrestled like schoolkids after that- Draco did not smell like ham, thank you very much. His homemade cologne was legendarily seductive.
“Well,” says Draco, following him into the kitchen. “I made an absolute tit of myself last time I was here, in case you didn’t notice.”
Taking his hand, he leans around him to turn off the shower, then tugs him out to stand on the bathmat. He grabs a huge white bath towel and drapes it over Harry like a cloak. It’s not fluffy anymore, well-worn and absorbent, and Harry pulls it tighter around himself. Draco wraps a smaller towel around his own waist before returning to Harry. He dries Harry just as carefully as he washed him, like a child. He could easily use a spell, and yet he seems to want to do it by hand. Draco kneels down, drying his legs and feet one at a time, in a mirror image of how he’d knelt before.
Malfoy’s hand is warmer than he remembers from his dream, and his grip is firm. Now he isn’t shielded by a baby, Harry can see how much he’s changed. He’s wearing a shirt and slacks rather than a robe, white sleeves pushed up over strong forearms. His blond, almost silver, hair always used to be slicked fastidiously back. Now it hangs loose, falling into his eyes.
Harry shakes his head, unable to stop smiling. “You’re not paying me, remember? I volunteered as emotional support.”
“Are you going out, Pansy? It’s Sunday night,” says Draco, looking quizzically at his oldest friend.
“I hope you don’t mind somewhere muggle, but I’m not likely to receive a warm welcome anywhere else.”
Ron gives a smug looking grin. “It’s nearly her birthday, so I just tapped my nose, and told her she’d find out soon enough.”
Draco squeezes a finger into the gap between the rope and his skin. “How’s that, darling? Not too tight?”
“Pansy,” he announces, as she opens the front door to let him stride into the living room. “I’ve been a fool of the worst kind.”
3: The title comes from one of my favourite poems 'Effort at Speech Between Two People' by Muriel Rukeyser. I highly recommend reading it! https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56285/effort-at-speech-between-two-people
He thumbs Potter’s bottom lip, dragging it down. He sucks the tip of Draco’s thumb inside his mouth, nibbling a little.
“We all liked Terran, even if we didn’t always agree with how he went about things, but I’m not sure.” Hermione tilts her head. “If a stranger could help you feel comfortable enough to do something you’ve been struggling with for years in one night, and Terran couldn’t in almost a year, then maybe Terran just isn’t the right person.”
He glances over the headline, confirming his worst fears. The press has found out about the breakup, and the steaming pile of Hippogriff manure has already moved on, it seems. The picture of Jones leans in to kiss the other man’s cheek, before smiling at the camera, and Draco wants to throttle him. And yet a tiny, horrible part of him feels…relieved.  If Jones has a new boyfriend, that means he won’t be back to darken Potter’s doorstep any time soon. Potter won’t be subjected to the moron’s inconsiderate fumbling, and Draco might be able to keep whatever
Draco continues. “Do you remember what I told you about meeting my friend Simi, and learning about BDSM?”
He feels a hand on his back.  He leans back into it, the touch that had been so terrifying moments ago now so comforting. Encouraged by his response, arms wrap around him.
“Not really,” says Zabini. “He was always very melodramatic at school, and just now he was practically blubbering all over me.”
If Malfoy’s groan is the gravel that skins your knee, then his words are the fall that comes before it. “That’s it, good boy. Show me you like it.”
He lets out a nervous giggle, and Ginny waltzes off to the fridge to find a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.
“What did you expect?” asks Harry, banishing some stray clutter into a draw. Asking him to come for lunch was impulsive. Draco was such a tidy person, and having him see his house without warning will only show him how different they are.
Draco sighs again. “I meant what I said before; I’m glad someone’s looking out for him. Which is why I’m going to take verituserum, and you’re going to interrogate me until you can be sure I’m not hurting Potter.”
“You’ll definitely have to wear some of my jeans. None of yours are remotely up to standard,” says Zabini.
He has to pull off for a second so he doesn’t accidentally bite down, but he licks and mouths at Draco’s cock while he rides out the wave. A shuddering exhale over the heated skin in front of him makes Draco groan, and Harry takes mercy on him. A few bobs of his head later and Draco is following him over the precipice.
“Why is it I can do this-” Harry waves his hand and turns her glass of wine into milk, “And you don’t bat an eyelash, but even the idea of telling the future is ridiculous.”
“Then we have no reason to think that he will. However, if you would like more clarity, there are ways of achieving it,” says Granny. “I think its time we start your training.”
Harry stares a little. Simi is stunning, in a confusing sort of way. Their hair, that they’d apparently been struggling with, looks immaculate. It’s a deep, hickory brown, and it would have been down to their shoulders if it wasn’t twisted into an elaborate braid. Their eyes are almost black they’re so dark, hooded and heavy, lined with Kohl. There’s a subtle hook to their nose, sharpening the roundness of their face. Simi’s tall, taller than Draco even, though much slighter. They’ve painted their lips a deep shade of purple, almost black, and he wonders if they’re the one who encouraged Draco to experiment with makeup. If so, he’d like to shake their hand.
Draco throws his head back and laughs at his awkwardness. “Hello, Harry. You don’t look too shabby yourself.”
“Well, I wouldn’t want to impose. They wouldn’t know I was coming, and there might not be enough food.”
Fortunately, it’s not the Aurors. Unfortunately, it’s Weasley. He’s definitely not Draco’s type, but even he can admit the man’s grown up well. When he smiles, his face can actually be quite handsome, if you ignore the rest of his personality.
“No, I thought not, given that you grew up with them. I didn’t either.” Draco smiles weakly. “Can you imagine how my father would have reacted? But in first year, I did join a book club.”
Molly seems genuinely pleased by his flattery, and sits him next to her when they move to the table. Harry’s all the way at the other end of the table with Arthur, and he sends a beseeching look his way. He’s the one who made him come, and now he’s abandoned him to a suspicious looking Percy on his left, and an amused looking George across from him. At least he’s not sat with Ronald. Relieved as he is that he’s kept Draco’s secret, he can still feel the ghost of that punch.
His relationship was brilliant, and gentle, and fun, and everything he needed. Until. Until Terran’s mother died of the illness that had been slowly killing her, and he fell apart. He came to Harry late at night, cried into his shoulders, started kissing him through the tears and just didn’t stop. He got more desperate, and Harry got tenser, until he pushed him away. Harry said that they shouldn’t sleep together for the first time when Terran was in that state, and it was true- but it wasn’t the whole truth.
“Potions accident,” says Draco. “It was brewed wrong and we inhaled the fumes. Harry arrived and found us all unconscious. He vanished the cauldron and called St Mungo’s, but he’d inhaled too much leftover gas and passed out himself.”
Distantly, Harry notices what he’s just called him. He’d called him Harry twice before, but both times he was trying to comfort Harry, not fuck him. Then he’s too distracted by Draco hitting his prostrate like a jackhammer to think about it anymore. His dick is rubbing against one of those infuriating, sexy embroidered shirts, and the friction is maddening. Harry comes first, slumping against Draco, completely exhausted.
Harry closes his eyes. The last time he’d wanked, he hadn’t thought of anyone in particular. For some reason he struggles to really get going when he thinks about Terran, guilty as that makes him feel. The anxiety always creeps in when he tries. So he closes his eyes then too, and lets himself imagine the sensations. He feels heat pressed all along his back, arms caging his chest. Being pressed face-first into the shower wall, murmuring in his ear, though he doesn’t try and conjure the words. That’s a fantasy he returns to often.
, and Harry takes a moment to be thankful someone else has dealt with her. He’s also had enough of chasing dark wizards and witches.
When he wakes, Draco is kneeling over him. A voice in his head that sounds a lot like Granny’s says that there’s been enough kneeling over unconscious people for one day, in dreams or reality, and this better be the last of it. He thinks he might mumble something to that effect, because Draco sighs in relief. He sits up. A few feet away the young woman is bound with an
Once Draco goes home, Harry gives himself leave to quietly fall apart. Draco probably likes men. Probably. But what else could he have meant by ‘his taste in men’? Either way, it doesn’t mean that Draco’s that much more likely to want him back. It’s not as impossible as he had thought, but in a way that makes it worse. If,
Harry stands up, steps fully into the fireplace, and gives it Luna’s address. Long moments later, he stumbles out of the fireplace coughing, and covered in soot. “All?”
All at once, he realises what he’s just done, and who he’s done it with. He stops moving, he almost stops breathing.
She looks away, unable to meet his eyes. “Draco is alone, and I can’t leave him to struggle by himself, so I’m calling in my debt. I saved your life, Mr Potter. That creates a contract, and I’m asking you to honour it.”
Harry shakes himself. This Leonard Cohen makes beautiful but depressing music, and it might be starting to rub off on him. He is alive. The world is saved. That should be enough. Harry thinks to himself:
Terran doesn’t want him once he actually has him. Terran’s eyes are dark when he continues, his voice hoarse as he says “I want you naked now.”
Blaise takes him home and tips him into bed, placing a hangover potion on his bedside table. He swears he even feels Blaise pat his head before he goes, still mumbling to himself.
Harry throws his hands in the air. “Maybe that’s it! Maybe we should just be kids. The wars over, there’s nothing to stop us, let’s do something stupid and fun just because we can.”
Time for a POV change! This is my first time writing from Draco's perspective, and I really enjoyed it.
He moves his hand from Malfoy’s hair to clutch at his shirt, whining at the lack of skin. His hand moves faster over Harry’s dick, then he rubs his thumb over the head right at the same time as he nails his prostrate, and Harry is done for.
Angus shakes his head. “Not the best first impression, I’m sure. But then the first time I met Draco, he was so drunk that when we were walking home, he started talking to a garden gnome, telling it to hide or someone would see it.”
“What?” says Jones, a stupid look on his face. “No, no way. You need to listen to me. You can’t let that
Potter clears his throat. “You know, speaking of what you like. Do you, um. Do you want to actually do that thing you said?”
The warm covers are ripped away, and the cold air startles Harry into wakefulness. He rolls over from his position on his stomach, and stares at the ghost stood over his bed. “Since when have you been able to do that?”
Draco smirks. “Except on the phone, you mean? Besides,” adds Draco. “It’s not an intimate gathering. You won’t be out of place.”
“I think so, duckie. My father died, and my mother remarried. She had another daughter. I’ve seen bits and pieces in the paper, obituaries, wedding announcements, new babies. I never met her, but she has a whole family now. They probably don’t even know I exist.”
“So good,” he mumbles, seeming almost unaware of the sounds tumbling from his mouth without end. “Being so good for me, taking it so well. You feel so good, darling, so beautiful. So pretty when I fuck you.”
This is not the Draco Malfoy he knew. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever hear Malfoy apologise in his life. The tone is so different to all his other letters that if it weren’t for the details he might think it had been written by someone else entirely. Maybe he should show this letter to Hermione, to pass along the message? Or, better yet, Malfoy can tell her himself.
“Undetectable extension charm,” says Draco, pulling the handle of a plastic carrier bag out of his back pocket, before tucking it in again and holding his hand out to Harry. “Shall we?”
“You said this was at a bar,” says Hermione urgently. “Were you drunk? Are you sure he didn’t take advantage of you?”
He’d forgotten Bellatrix was her sister too. Despite how alike they looked, Andromeda’s personality is so bright as to outshine the similarities completely.
Harry stands, pulling Draco up with him. He takes another sip of his too-strong drink, and wanders over to Jake and Tabby. Jake is definitely drunk. His shirt buttons are skew whiff, like they’d been undone and then done up again in a hurry. His cheeks are flushed, and his neat hair is sticking up in places. If Harry didn’t know better, he’d say it looks like Tabby has just ravished him in a cupboard.
Harry thinks back. Before he met Draco again, before the war. He’d always noticed boys. He’d always noticed how tall they were, how they grinned as they let him in on a joke. Everyone always talked about how handsome Lockhart was, so why was it different if he thought so too? Harry had assumed that all boys thought these things, noticed these things, but maybe he was wrong. Maybe it was just that Draco was the first man to make him feel the way Cho had, Ginny had. Maybe he could have more with Draco.
Harry nearly sprays his last mouthful of whisky, clapping a hand over his mouth just in time. “Christ, Malfoy.”
Harry wakes to an empty bed and a pointy finger poking his cheek. “Wake up, Potter. It’s time for breakfast.”
His eyes widen. Draco’s going to read? His dick throbs at the thought of being ignored, being an object for Draco’s pleasure. He doesn’t have to think at all, doesn’t have to worry about making the right decisions- he can just let himself be used. Just a body. A toy.
“It’s near the Manor,” says Malfoy, as they stand outside and look up at the hand-painted sign swinging in the wind. “So I come here now and again.”
Harry groans and sinks further under the covers. Hermione walks over to the window, stepping over piles of dirty clothes, and opens the curtains. In her crisp skirt-suit, hair wrangled into a braid, she looks every inch the professional.
“Fuck no. Guess I’ll have to learn.” Ron twists his fork around, gathering up the strands of spaghetti. “So what did you want to talk about?”
you take me to your bedroom,” grins Harry, still giddy and loose from his orgasm. Malfoy’s still dressed, though his flies are open and his belt is missing, but that’s not what makes Harry start. “You’re still hard.”
Malfoy cocks his head. “Really? From where I was standing, you looked about ready to knock down the wall.”
It should feel condescending, coming from Draco, but instead it just makes Harry feel treasured. Safe. Not something he’d ever ask for from Malfoy of all people, but he finds himself drunk on it all the same.
Draco strokes his hair. He might claim to hate his rat’s nest but Harry’s starting to think that’s not the case. He’s always playing with it, running his fingers through it, petting Harry’s head like a soft little pet. Not that he’s complaining. He loves the feeling of Draco’s hands in his hair, whether he’s caressing it as he is now, or pulling until it hurts.
“I had lots of dreams after that, about all sorts of things. They started teaching me Divination, and it’s still the only type of magic I’ve ever had any luck with. I can go for months without even touching my wand,” she says.
He doubts that’s the real reason, as they’re in the attic, and not that dusty bedroom. Still, there’s plenty of dust here to remind him of it. “Whatever you say,” he sighs.
Their eyes lock, and Harry can’t read the emotion in Draco’s eyes. He steps closer, making the inches of height between them seem bigger than they are. Draco reaches out a hand, pauses, and then runs it over and through Harry’s hair. Fighting not to close his eyes to the sensation, he watches in disbelief.
“I thought it might upset you,” she explains. “Besides, I thought it would upset Harry even more, and I didn’t want to ask you to keep a secret from him.”
