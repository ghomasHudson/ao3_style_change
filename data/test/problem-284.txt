People swarmed in around him, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, George, Molly—all the people he had fought to protect, weeping and shouting and roaring with relief.
“Right,” Robards said, not ungently, “I realize this is going to be hard, Harry, but I need you to tell me everything that happened tonight, from the moment you left the Ministry to now.” He paused. Harry waited for him to start in on his behavior in the courtroom. “I assume you left you left through the rooftop apparation point directly after you left the Wizengamot. Start there, and don’t leave out any details, even if they seem unrelated to you.”
Harry fought the urge to loosen his tie, wishing he had just ditched the whole thing and worn a bloody t-shirt. “I was was there, yeah, in the Astronomy Tower. I saw it.”
All three aurors stared at him in silence, their expressions closed off and curious—even Proulx seemed to be eyeing him speculatively now.
There were only three people in Andromeda’s sitting room this time. He’d figured this might be more quiet than the last meeting. Bill, Robards, and, to Harry’s surprise and immediate wariness, Kingsley. Though, maybe he shouldn’t be that surprised. He’d killed someone only hours after making a scene in front of the Wizengamot. Kingsley was probably here to give Harry a warning. Maybe more. Harry wasn’t going to put up much of a fight either way.
Ginny had never been overly affectionate when they were dating, and while Hermione’d started fussing over him during their year on the run, it still wasn’t something he was used to and the discomfort remained even when he was grateful for it. And neither Hermione or Ginny had ever given the impression of mothering him. It was different with Andromeda. She probably didn’t realize, but it meant something he couldn’t quite express. It was the same feeling he used to get when Molly included Harry as an unofficial family member.
Charlie and Bill shared a look that Harry pretended not to notice. It wasn’t the first one of the night, nor would it be the last. He had to stop himself from checking if there was a storm cloud over his head. He knew exactly where it was coming from, though, and he had no intention of helping them along.
he exhaled, bracing himself on the chair to keep his balance. How long had he been up here? He started shaking too, like he was getting a cold, pulses of aching heat rippling under his skin as he blinked his vision clear.
The old woman turned sharply on her heel and marched away, nose so high in the air Harry watched for a while to see if she tripped on the stairs leading up to the floo hallway.
Harry felt like his mind was sinking down the back of his spine. A slow, inevitable plummet into that cavern of darkness which had opened up inside him two weeks ago.
And perhaps worst of all, Malfoy had let Harry take his wand. He must have. The realization had come on slowly as his mind processed—there was no way Harry had overpowered him in his house. You didn’t learn how to duel like
The lift jerked into motion. Harry looked down, breaking the moment of relief. A little pebble dropped into the hollow cave of his chest, ripples disturbing all the foul things below. The swarm of noise reached a crescendo with his blood beating in his ears, and he let the boiling anger drag him under.
Loup, he knew—wolf. The second sounded familiar, but he didn’t know why. Hadn’t—Kamau said Goyle might have been under the effects of a potion which simulated the effects of lycanthropy? Maybe he was just trying to find something to think about other than the obvious, disappointing truth, but he thought…
“I don’t know why I’m here,” the figure whispered, his unsteady breath brushing Harry’s lips. “I don’t know why I’m letting you— I have to—stop.”
“Right. Let’s get this over with,” he murmured as his throat tightened. The ghostly images of his mother and father, of Sirius and Remus, swam in his mind, every bit as clear as they had been that night in the Forbidden Forest.
“Seems like as good a time as any,” she continued, “with school not starting back up until next year. And I think my parents—” She frowned, shaking her head. “I think they want to spend time with me too. Away from—this.”
Belatedly, he realized he didn’t actually know if the ritual had worked. His wand wobbled over to him without him even realizing he was summoning it, brightening as Harry wrapped his shaking fingers around it. He sat there, faced with the challenge of trying to test whether the blood magic ritual he’d performed had worked to…cleanse his house of malicious spirits…or whatever the fuck it was supposed to do. At the time it made perfect sense, but now that he was on the other side of it—how the fuck was he supposed to find out if it worked?
Daphne’s mouth twitched, as if amused. She gave Hermione a final long, pensive look from beneath her lashes. “A delight as always, Granger.”
than the kind of magic he was used to. It felt primal, a base, ancient kind of magic that went beyond incantations and spells and wands. It felt like truth, like simplicity, when his life for so long had been complicated by lies.
His eyes slid shut as his hand drifted low across his stomach, a weird tension fluttering to life inside him as he drew a long wet line down his navel. When was the last time he’d had a good wank? Not for a while. And there was something antsy in him, like something had gotten knocked loose in the cleansing ritual. Whatever it was apparently made him remember that he had a cock, and that, would you believe, it felt rather nice if he tugged on it for a while.
The tension built until his surroundings faded, until it was just him and Malfoy staring at each other again, like they were back in school across from one another on the quidditch pitch. Harry felt like he was waiting for something. He felt that thrill of anticipation, that flicker of hunger to
“Thought you could get away with it, did you?” Goyle snarled, low voice manic and fevered. The smell of him now was strong enough to make Harry wince. He smelled like raw meat and sweat, like an animal. “Though you could just kill the Dark Lord and walk away? Destroy
It was the sadness that pricked Harry’s mind. Bits of the dream began to crystallize and harden, refracted as if through a prism. A tremble went through the beach and Harry nearly felt the oncoming dread of a storm.
“Don’t,” Andromeda said quietly. Her wand glowed yellow and green as she did something to his hand which made Harry painfully aware of the precise placement of his fine bones. “Don’t tell me where you’re going. The fewer people who know, the safer you’ll be.”
Her lips pursed. “I was.” It took her a few moments, but she seemed to decide to let this go as well. She leaned back and slumped in her chair. “They haven’t said so in as many words, but I think they do. My father keeps saying I might benefit from a more well-rounded education. There’s a program at the university there that seems interesting.”
It was selfish in a way Harry’d never been able to justify being. Cruel, dismissive, arrogant. So many things he’d once thought were his virtues had fallen to the wayside, but this one stuck around. He didn’t get to worry about shite like this. Who was he kidding, really? This—trivial bullshit like who he might theoretically not be opposed to looking at for more than a few seconds was what other people worried about. People who weren’t reanimated corpses and repositories for evil, broken souls. People who weren’t being hunted down like dogs, even after the war they’d fought and won was supposed to be over. People who’d never killed before.
He leaned against a tree, hidden from the path, sliding down until he was sitting opposite Goyle where he was tucked into the shadows. He looked now like he’d just fallen asleep. His arm draped over his face. One knee hooked up over the other. Harry couldn’t see the odd angle of his neck or his broken jaw from where he was. He didn’t look dead from here.
The water struck his skin, scalding and steaming and wiping his mind of all thoughts for one blissful second. He ducked his head and stood under the faucet and scrubbed his face, letting the water score down his neck and chest, over his stomach and legs. Merlin, this was nice. The heat did something to his back, letting him unwind and relax, as if all the knots there were working themselves out under the violent ministrations of his shower head. He wondered absently if this was the house’s doing as well, if there was some drug in the water that made him calm down. It certainly seemed willing to let him stand under the water as long as he wanted. Even the other shower gave him problems sometimes, turning cold in sharp bursts to let him know his time was up.
A drop of water fell into the still pool of his mind. The echo spread, rippling, and then it was all stillness once more.
“Seriously,” Bill said, nudging him with an elbow. “Something to consider. Might be a nice change of pace.”
Now, though, with the trials coming up in a few weeks and Harry’s momentary respite ending, Harry didn’t want to be kept in the dark anymore. Not where the Ministry was concerned.
The air in the room shifted as Robards straightened. “So.” He met Harry’s gaze firmly. “I’m afraid we haven’t learned much more than what we were able to tell you the last time we spoke, however it seems as if Goyle and Bulstrode
Malfoy jerked back, bald fear overtaking his blank expression. Lucius jumped and yelped. Narcissa rose—
Harry shook his head, eyes locked on the far horizon. If he kept looking, he would find out how to get there. To cross the expanse and just fly off the edge of the world. There had to be something better out there, something easier and warmer. Something that didn’t make him hurt just to feel alive.
Right. Because it wasn’t bad enough, being harassed by an overzealous grandmother. Something had to show up and make this day even less enjoyable. Something in a sleek black suit and robes that looked as if dust and lint had never dared go within five feet of it. In fact, they were probably charmed to do exactly that.
After an awkward pause as they all listened to Andromeda moving about the kitchen, Kamau said, “I don’t mean to be presumptuous, but the little chameleon wouldn’t happen to be—”
“I think—my magic just reacted. I don’t know. I’ve never—that’s never happened to me before. I’ve cast spells I didn’t mean to, one time it wasn’t even one I knew, but never
“HE DIDN’T!” Neville shouted, joined at once by Ron and Hermione and Ginny, every one of his loved ones raising their voices in defiance. “HE—”
Every time he thought he had accepted it the truth went sour and left him again with the knowledge that without Draco Malfoy, he’d never have been able to kill Voldemort. Without him disarming Dumbledore, letting Harry take his wand, causing enough of a distraction for Harry to get up and face Voldemort on his own terms—Harry wouldn’t have been able to challenge Voldemort for the Elder Wand. Harry would have died.
“He’s a gem of a boy, really. I must insist on giving you his information. You’d get on so marvelously. And what a quidditch player! Now, I don’t want to step on your toes, Mr. Potter, but many have said that he’s got the makings of being the finest seeker Hogwarts has ever seen! I fully expect him to make the team when he tries out once school starts up again. And he’ll have all next year to practice, oh, yes, I expect him to give you a run for your money!”
Voldemort. He would wait until Harry made his move because he took supreme enjoyment in making people struggle before he killed them. He liked to give people a shred of hope only to rip it away at the last second. He thought himself superior to every witch and wizard in this castle including Harry. He thought he was untouchable. Why rush an end he had been working toward for seventeen years?
She narrowed her eyes at him but let it go. “I’m not sure when I’d get another experience like this. And I would truly love to meet my extended family.”
But every time he sat down and tried to relax he smelled smoke, and he felt a prickling sensation of breath on the back of his neck. He felt like someone was watching him.
Andromeda took everyone else’s orders, eyes coming to rest again on Harry when he remained silent. He felt terrible for making her go through all this.
Hands shaking slightly, he pushed his hair back where it had gotten stuck to his face. Sweat had pooled in the small of his back and under his arms. It was cold and damp down here in the cellar, but the act of drawing the diagrams, intricate, horribly complicated things, seemed to draw on something more than artistic ability. He compared his sigil, his fifth attempt, to the one in the greenwood book, unable to find anything wrong with it.
His eyes were still tired, but Harry was the one who’d been crying now. And for an infinitely small slice of a moment, he also wanted to ask—
Harry tried to find his voice. He didn’t know why Malfoy knowing about the Elder Wand changed anything. He didn’t think Malfoy would try to kill him now, not after he’d gone to all the trouble of saving his life.
The room felt heavy and full in the pause, like Dumbledore’s memory of the Wizengamot Harry had watched in fourth year. Everyone waiting to hear the answer they were hoping for.
He nodded. Hit wizards had taken Sirius in after Wormtail framed him. They’d responded to the riot during the Quidditch World Cup.
“Can I keep this?” he asked before he could stop himself, his voice rough in the oppressive silence of the room.
Harry stared, his mind unable to keep up with what was happening right in front of him. He opened his mouth but before he could say more than, “Hermione, what the—,” she had her wand pointed directly at his chest.
Harry exhaled, frowning at the rush of feeling. Malfoy had always been able to get a rise out of him, but this felt—
Under the papers there were a few books, what looked to be a journal of some kind. Scraps of crinkled paper and tape formed the bulk of the contents. Harry couldn’t help but think of Regulus’s frantic scribblings in the last days of his life.
At worst, Robards wanted Harry under the Ministry’s control. After what he’d done today, he knew full and well that Yeats, when she found out about this, would be more than happy to lock him up somewhere, hold this over him so they could get his endorsement and finally silence him.
He wasn’t human. He was a mistake. A flaw in the plan. He was what happened when brilliant men trusted too much in their own cleverness and didn’t take into account that the universe was a hell of a lot crueler and more chaotic than they thought.
Whatever she saw in his eyes, Daphne seemed more suspicious rather than reassured. “Well. We’ve got a sentencing hearing to go to, and unfortunately for us we’re not even in the main room. Going to be dreadfully boring, and I’m sure you both have better things to do than exchange awkward pleasantries for the next five minutes.”
Harry opened his mouth to call out but no sound came. The dream vibrated and he felt something pushing,
No one made so much as a gasp, not since Voldemort had last shouted them mute. Harry opened his eyes a slash. They all stood there on the other side of the ruined courtyard and he couldn’t spot Hermione or Ron. He couldn’t tell which figure in red was Ginny. All of them were covered in ash and grouped together in a gathered dark blur.
“There, see?” Andromeda said, giving Harry a small smile before hitching Teddy up on her hip. “Told you he’d be back.”
On his fourth day of questioning Hermione joined him, looking wary but stubborn—wearing the same expression he recognized from school whenever she’d been building up to chastising him or challenging him on something. She tried to talk about the fight in the Leaky Cauldron, but Harry shook her off once he realized she had no interest in hearing him out. She didn’t press the issue beyond a few pointed, heavy looks, but Harry knew she wasn’t satisfied. Probably wanted to wait until after the trials were over to bring it up again. Ron hadn’t been asked to come in for questioning much, and Harry saw little enough of him as it was. Which was fine. Hermione might be insufferably unwilling to let anything go, but she at least tried to pretend things weren’t weird. Ron would sulk until one of them caved, and Harry didn’t feel like engaging with him right now.
Bill gave him a warm smile, doing his own cursory examination of Harry. He did a good job of hiding it, but Harry saw the spike of concern. He must look worse to everyone else, not having grown used to the hardness settling over him the past two weeks. At least Harry wasn’t covered in blood this time.
“You won’t—be able to fuck things up now,” Goyle said through clenched teeth, voice breaking on every other word. Another impact to his stomach. Harry would have tasted bile if Goyle hadn’t been crushing his throat. “Never again. I’ll kill you, I will—and I’ll kill all your stupid mudblood friends and you won’t be able to do anything because you’ll be
Harry deflected her spell quickly, his wand out and in his hand before he realized what he was doing.
could understand him. But once again, the house seemed to respond, the door opening up a little wider followed by the sound of a tap turning on and a shower curtain being drawn.
His eyes flicked to Malfoy, narrowing. “Sorry about this one. He can’t keep his slimy mouth shut most of the time. But that’s a death eater for you, isn’t it? Thinking they’re smarter and better than everyone else even after they lost, the bleeding snakes. If he’s been bothering you, I’ll make sure he gets his. Don’t you worry.”
The silence hung between them. Behind Harry over the estuary he heard birds waking up. The muted sounds of voices calling to one another at the other end of the dirt road where the little village connected to Oxford proper.
With as much calm as he could muster, keeping his eyes on her and not looking at Hermione or Bill or Kingsley, not even Malfoy, he said slowly, “I’m done now.”
He turned before he could see Kingsley’s reaction. He walked away and he forced himself not to feel guilty, like he should take it all back and try to be someone Kingsley Shacklebolt could admire. It was still there, that purpose, that path. Robards would give him a job. Kingsley would help him. The window on that opportunity was closing, but he could salvage this. If he wanted to.
Malfoy stood apart from the others, distinguishable because of the white shine of his hair, the pale cast to his face strangely luminous in the smoke and fog of the encroaching dawn.
His voice ricocheted off the high ceilings of the main staircase, shocked by the violence of his final word. He hadn’t meant the last to slip out. He hadn’t meant to crack open in front of Draco Malfoy. He took a jerking step back, tripping over the stairs, dropping his gaze as he worked through the panic overwhelming his anger.
No one answered him, but the towel on the rack flipped up its end, as if to dismiss the very thought. The floor creaked as well—not the kind of creak Harry was used to, that sounded like Grimmauld Place would like nothing more than to die a painless death, but the kind which put him in the mind of Mrs. Weasley when she sighed good-naturedly at him after he’d asked if he could help her with something.
Harry blinked, alarmed at the sudden wealth of disquiet this thought carried, but then Kreacher was himself, looking unsure and hopeful at the same time.
“I didn’t think so,” Robards said quietly. “And even if I weren’t inclined to believe you, there’s something else going on here, something which complicates your situation.”
When the rushing of his blood died down there was only the sound of his own wet breathing, the heartbeat in his ears. Far off in the distance, he heard the rush of traffic, but he was so far into the park that it was just a faint murmur. Bugs chirped. A little splash of water as something dropped down onto the nearby lake. Mundane sounds of the world around him.
Robards nodded, taking a seat after raking another sharp look over Harry’s body. His eyes tightened.
He took an unconscious step forward, sending another wave rippling through the Wizengamot. He could see bald fear on many faces now. He knew it should have been a warning, but it was just fuel. They were scared. They were all fucking scared, and he didn’t care.
Their eyes locked, pale grey to bright green. The hawthorn wand crackled with life as if it rose to defend its old owner. Something bright and warm and brilliant cut through Harry’s chest right where Voldemort’s Killing Curse had hit him in the forest. It filled him with lightning and cleared his sight. For a moment all the noise around him faded, retreated.
Kingsley’s chest expanded slowly but his expression didn’t falter. “I’ve discussed it with her. She won’t be pressing charges either.”
It didn’t change anything. Love hadn’t saved Harry. It’d brought him back to life, maybe, but it hadn’t saved him.
It became more evident as the week went on that he couldn’t work for the Ministry. Not as it was, anyway. After the long days of questioning as they walked out of the Ministry together, he listened to Hermione talk about reforming it from the inside, about working within the system to change it for the better. That was all well and good. Harry sincerely wished her the best of luck, because if anyone could do it, it’d be her.
He felt Kingsley’s stare heavy on him. Harry looked up to find him focused intently at Harry’s right forearm, where a long, straight scar now sat.
He wasn’t the same person he’d been in school, relying on his natural talent and ability to skate by. He’d worked hard, of course he had, but he’d never devoted himself to anything unless there was a concrete reason. He’d learned how to cast a patronus because he didn’t want to hear his mum’s dying scream in his head every time he looked at a dementor. He’d mastered
“Thought not.” Bill moved to let Harry through into the hall, Andromeda following with Teddy in her arms. “Merlin’s beard, Teddy’s gotten big.”
With a heavy exhale he almost laughed. Everything. That was the problem. To even be thinking about this, now, when he’d been nearly killed and his flat destroyed, when he now knew exactly how aberrant he really was, when nearly every person he cared about thought he was mad or raving or self-destructing…
For what felt like a lifetime Harry lay curled up on the dirt road, sucking in heaving breaths, trying not to scream.
Harry cleared his throat. “He was a git.” As if that made any difference. It still didn’t explain why he’d felt the urge to step in. Harry forced himself to meet Malfoy’s gaze, to not be even a little embarrassed. “Just because it’s
There were people huddled outside the door, because of course there were, but he ignored them. Moving with his eyes on the ground and his face set—
Kreacher stopped so quickly Harry had to brace himself on a highly unstable-looking armoire that buzzed the moment he touched it. Remembering their long and arduous campaign against the doxies of Grimmauld Place three years ago, Harry balanced as best he could and moved away at once.
Kreacher popped into view. Harry only just managed not to jump out of his chair. “Is master needing something of Kreacher?”
“I know that I’m the last person you want to hear this from, right now,” Kingsley continued, voice solemn and soft, “but there’s nothing else to be done here. We’ve followed the trail, and it led us nowhere. Sometimes, that happens. There’s no evidence that this was part of some larger conspiracy, or lingering sentiment from Voldemort’s supporters. We’re not looking at a Neo-Death Eater retaliation against you.” It was almost like they were the only people in the room, Bill, Andromeda, Teddy, and Robards just impressions at the edges of his vision. “It was a crime of passion done in self defense, and in this case, Gawain is more than within his rights to close the investigation without filing any criminal charges.”
Robards sat with a sigh, rubbing a large hand across his chin, scratching his beard. Harry forced himself to look at Robards, to ignore the little shocks of pain in his hand, running up his arm.
He took a deep breath. Waited. Blew it out. His hearing came back slowly, the tension leaking out of him into the air like a toxin.
It was like a shockwave rippled through the crowd, murmurs growing and ebbing and swirling around the circular room like water down a drain.
The plant expanded, its progress slowed slightly by the fact that there was no more room in the pot. It came to a rest when the stems reached a good foot and a half to either side, and crested two feet in height.
He was gasping for air now, shuddering. His back bowed, his breath fogging the air. His hands kept searching but they were just as often clenching in the dirt, unconsciously seeking something to hold.
“Ah, Kreacher,” Harry started, pulling his eyes from a stack of parchment so old it looked like it might burst into dust if he so much as breathed on it, “when I said I wanted to organize, I more meant cutlery or clothes or—”
The small envelope was a soft robin’s egg blue. He opened it carefully, wondering if it might be a howler, hoping she at least wanted him to explain. She’d lost her family to the war. She’d have more cause than most to think what he was doing was wrong.
Another tense silence passed. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if the entire room had had a Statuary Jinx placed on it.
He could barely stand being around anyone these days, even the people he cared about most in the whole world. If he couldn’t trust Ron and Hermione, if he couldn’t manage to love Ginny, if he couldn’t be with the only people who actually cared about him, the closest thing he would ever get to family…
Voldemort was dead, and his scar wasn’t hurting. And there was still something pulsing in his chest, like heartburn or anxiety, but alive, rippling like dark water disturbed by a boat. By corpses.
Harry rose when he heard Bill come back into the kitchen. He said nothing about what he’d heard as he sat in silence through dinner. He didn’t even know if there was anything he had to say. His brain seemed to have stalled, stuck on the image of that girl on the ground, eyes blank, just like Cedric’s had been.
It was time to end this. He didn’t have anything more to say and he didn’t want to hear Kingsley’s excuses or attempts to comfort him. He didn’t want anything from Kingsley. Not anymore.
His pale eyes were empty. There was a horrible, barren resignation in them which stoked alarm in Harry’s belly for the first time since waking on the forest floor, though he couldn’t say why. There was something to Malfoy’s emptiness. Something Harry recognized.
I know exactly what it feels like to be used as a weapon,” he spat, anger spilling in as the words kept coming. “I know how it feels to find out the people you thought were looking out for you think you’re nothing but a fucking piece on a chess board, and they don’t give a damn what you want or what you feel, because you’re not a
He managed to get off the path, realizing only too late that he’d left Goyle’s wand in plain sight. Hopefully if any muggles did pass by they’d think it was a stick. And then they’d see the blood and maybe mistake it for water.
“Do you know why Goyle decided to target you, Harry?” Robards asked. “Beyond his belief that you were somehow responsible for his friend’s death, and Mr. Malfoy’s abandonment.”
His dreams since Voldemort’s death had been vague and unfixed. Filled with a low burning anxiety which was weak enough he could brush it off come morning. He still dreamed of his mum’s screams and Sirius’s smile as he fell back through the veil and Remus’s peaceful expression where he lay on the blasted stones of Hogwarts like he was just sleeping. They were mixed in with all the other dreams of kids in shackles and a room full of black robes.
Harry took a few steps toward him, trying not to frown at the slight shift in Malfoy’s shoulders, like he was trying to stop himself from backing away. “You should know there are…people who aren’t—aren’t too eager to consider what you, what other kids went through. Yeats, the new head of Magical Law Enforcement… I don’t think she’ll be forgiving if you slip up. She seems eager to throw whoever she can in jail. And there’s a bloke,” Harry added, watching a group of wizards pass them, more than one giving him and Malfoy a shocked once-over, “name’s Proulx, a transfer in from the French Ministry. I think—I don’t know for sure, but I think you should steer clear of him, too. I know you enjoy being a complete ass, but maybe keep it to a minimum if you ever cross him, and just…keep your head down, or…”
“I’ll take a tonic and lime,” Hermione said, giving Ron a disapproving look. “And you should too. I’m not carrying you back to your flat.”
The greenhouse Kreacher took him to would have looked right at home at Hogwarts. Well, if the plants had been alive. The rows of shelves were filled with dead husks, the soil parched and dry. It smelled of old leaves, warmer than the rest of the house but still with a stale quality to the air. Harry placed the pot with the newly revived plant on a shelf near the door and peered through the fogged windows.
Harry glanced at Robards, knowing he’d been an auror at the time the Ministry was looking for Sirius, but he just looked implacable. Maybe a bit uncomfortable, but Harry guessed that was more to do with him being eternally severe.
He looked back down at Malfoy’s now hidden ankle. He could understand requiring anyone under suspicion of allying with Voldemort to remain in the country, even putting them under house arrest. Surveilling them, bringing them into question—sure. He understood that. If they were dangerous, and they might hurt someone else, he could understand holding them somewhere safe.
“No, not Malfoy. All of them. The Slytherins. Kids of death eaters or sympathizers.” He could practically hear them both thinking he’d gone mad. “He turned over his house, you know,” he said quietly.
Shell Cottage didn’t feel like home anymore than the Burrow did but at least Harry didn’t feel like some interloper, like he was dragging grief and ghosts with him wherever he went. Maybe it was that he had never known Shell Cottage without the shadow of death. When he was here last, he had been mourning Dobby, readying himself for the moment he finally faced Voldemort.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “Says the boy whose hair has been fighting a constant battle with gravity for the past seven years. And I’d stick to my glass house if I were you. You’re not exactly looking hale and healthy yourself. Celebrity getting to you?” A flicker of amusement built in his gaze, mouth tugging up to one side. “Or are you wasted without a cause to champion? Find you just can’t get out of bed in the morning without whacking a few death eathers—”
“I don’t blame him. None of us are all right but Harry… It fell on him more than anyone else, in the end. I still don’t know how he did it,” Bill added, a frown in his voice. “That kind of magic…can’t say I’ve ever seen anything like it.”
Harry held Draco’s gaze as long as he could. A flicker, maybe, somewhere behind his ribs—or maybe he was just looking for something anywhere he might find it. He held it until the crowd pulled him away. Until he was forced to let it go.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. His eyes burned with tears and his head pounded and somewhere in the distance he swore he could hear someone screaming. He could smell rust and ash and he wasn’t in a park in London anymore, he was—
“NO—no, sorry,” Harry said quickly, raising his other hand palm out. “I wasn’t—sorry. I was just going to give this back to you.” His heart beat hard but he held Malfoy’s gaze.
Right. He would be talking about the kids his people arrested, then. Or maybe the one they had killed?
at the Minister for Magic, accused the Wizengamot of being cowards. They were, and Kingsley deserved that much and more if he really had stood back and let Harry take the fall for him, but…
Harry held his gaze. Some part of him completely agreed with Ron. This was nowhere near the kind of trauma inflicted on the country while Voldemort was in power. Most of these kids benefited from a pureblood-first ideology. And he was also pretty sure most of them had been perfectly happy to let a few muggleborn and halfblood witches and wizards get tortured, because it wasn’t their problem. They were safe, and so were their families. A lot of them probably didn’t even think about fighting back or standing up for the other.
He testified for three people that day—Goyle, who was still absent and wanted for the suspected murder of four muggles in the last three months, Pansy, and Malfoy. He’d already testified for Lucius and Narcissa, for Rookwood, Dolohov, Avery, Rowle, Travers, and Nott Sr. on previous days, but he didn’t know what their sentences were. He hadn’t asked. He didn’t want to know. Though he’d already been questioned and testified once for his fellow Hogwarts students, the Wizengamot had asked him to come in again, for further clarification on these three. Presumably because they were the ones Yeats wanted to make an example of.
Thinking of Umbridge made the back of his left hand burn, and he clenched it before he realized it would look combative, aggressive.
“Fine,” Harry said harshly, temper flaring in relief. “Thought it was uncharacteristically decent of you, but apparently I don’t get it. My mistake for thinking you might do something
“I was gonna ask,” Harry said, grinning. “You haven’t been to the Burrow yet, have you? Looks like you’ve still got some left on your head.”
Harry scanned the headlines. They were rather predictable—notices of persons still missing from the war, stories about the relief effort and the Ministry rebuilding, calls for anyone with knowledge of lingering death eater sentiment or activity to come forward and inform—and not until he got to the bottom of the page did he realize what Bill must have meant.
Kamau was watching him with a soft smile but Harry had a feeling the woman just looked like that all the time. Proulx still looked like he was sucking on a lemon, even if something in his dark blue eyes made Harry uneasy, gleaming with interest.
Harry jerked upright, sheets tangled around him. He was drenched in sweat. He gasped for breath, bending over as his chest throbbed from his barely healed ribs. His room was dark, the only sounds his own breathing and the quiet, ever present creaking of Grimmauld Place around him. He fumbled for his wand on the bedside table only to see it light up on the other side of the room, peeking out from the bottom of his dirty jeans. The light blossomed bright enough for the room to pulse with a soft, blue-white glow. It was comforting. It reminded him of his patronus.
I’m not. So he’s being monitored? If there wasn’t a reason to come in, you know he’d be on the next boat across the pond. They wouldn’t be able to find that slippery ferret if they didn’t keep him on a tight leash.”
The cottage door opened, and the sound of more than one set of feet came into the house, creaked on the small staircase up to the sitting room. Voices followed, low and deep. A gentle knock on the bedroom door.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione murmured, reaching across the table and taking his hand. “Why didn’t you say anything? Does Ron know?”
Strange, to realize how all that had shifted over the past year. There wasn’t a line anymore between magic he knew because of school and magic he knew because it meant the difference between him or the people he cared about being hurt, being killed.
Bill eyed the bracelet with alarm. “That a—family heirloom?” His expression faltered for a moment, presumably stumbling over Grimmauld Place. Right. That was going to need some explaining today as well.
He knew Ginny could tell there was something wrong. She had always been so damn perceptive. But she didn’t press him and he didn’t share, and little by little they drifted, and Harry let the space between them grow. Being with her seemed like a different life, one that was simple and soft and innocent. It had only been a year but he wasn’t the same person who had spent months pining for her, thinking she was everything warm and happy and bright in the world, that she was everything he wanted. He wasn’t the same person she had been in love with since she was eleven. The sunny dream he had slipped into when it was just them was gone, and he wondered sometimes if he hadn’t just imagined it or told himself it was what he wanted because it was probably all he would ever get. Because it was what he
The next week passed slowly as Harry desperately tried to hold on to the sense of peace he’d been able to find out here on the edge of everything. But he had known it would fade, known it would eventually spoil and leave him unmoored again, slip through his fingers and eddy through the air until he could only stare at the empty sky.
“I can think of a few things you could have said,” Ron said around a harsh laugh. “How about we start with you ditching my sister. Again.”
“I—won’t claim to understand Albus Dumbledore’s motivations,” he started, slowly, trying not to sound bitter. “But I think he believed Draco was redeemable. That his actions so far had been coerced and motivated by fear for his own life and for his parents’ lives.” He hesitated, fighting himself.
Apparently, he wasn’t doing a good job of pretending either. The moment Bill left to get another round, Charlie gave him a sympathetic smile. “I hope you’re not here for my sake. I promise I won’t be offended if you bail.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to be surprised. Bill had mentioned someone else that night, someone who had been cooperating with them and might be willing to talk to the kids, but Kingsley had shot him down for fear of asking this person too much. He didn’t want to scare them off.
“You’re right,” Harry said when he finally found his voice. “I’m being selfish. For once in my fucking life, I’m being selfish. I don’t want to see you. I don’t want to talk to you or Hermione, or anyone else. I don’t give a bloody fuck what you think about my feelings or my life. It’s my life. I don’t owe you anything. I don’t
After a few days—or maybe just one, he couldn’t remember—he found himself crouching in the small clearing Kreacher’d made for him in the center of the attic. His empty plate of sausages and eggs sat on Regulus’s table. He was eating. He’d keep eating. Even if he couldn’t really taste it anymore. He’d been drawing in the dust by one of the older stacks of parchment, finger tracing the triangle, the circle, the line, when he froze.
The whole time, he felt his wand pressed to his side. Memories of this room seeped into him, the deathly chill still held within the sleek tiled walls and austere benches. His godfather had died just through that door to the Department of Mysteries. He’d stood here in this room and been called a liar by the Minister for Magic.
He cleaned the rest of himself off with shaking hands, feeling both like he was about to faint and like he had electricity running under his skin. He was so twitchy he nearly broke his glasses as he shoved them back onto his face and tried to comb out his hair with his fingers. He dried himself cursorily, the wet drops of water from his hair a little chill every few seconds where they slid down his neck. He paced in his bedroom after noticing his sheets were clean and his sweats and ratty t-shirt he normally wore to sleep were sitting folded and neat atop them—the house was doing his laundry now, apparently, since Kreacher was off on a holiday, which was a very weird thing to just accept as normal now—biting his nail to work out some of the energy still crackling through him.
Or maybe the house was finally warming up to him. He didn’t know what to think if this was true, because while he didn’t hate the house anymore, it still didn’t feel like somewhere he’d chose to live for the rest of his life. This, crazily enough, made him feel a bit guilty.
He managed to stay present, to keep listening to Robards, but only because Teddy was sitting on his lap, his tiny, warm, ferociously alive body making it harder to disconnect from reality.
Harry tried to look away, he really did, but something in him latched on and refused to let go. He didn’t know what he might have expected Malfoy to do during his hearing. Sneer, probably. Wearing an expression of fury that he was being subjected to this kind of scrutiny. His posture should have been relaxed and careless, indolent to show none of this could touch him, even after everything he’d done and everything he’d been through.
They were kids. Most weren’t even of age. If it had just been Malfoy, he might have understood. It would have been overkill, but fine. He was a death eater. He’d taken the dark mark. That was a choice. He’d turned before the end and when Harry let himself admit it, he was one of the reasons Harry was even alive to kill Voldemort. He might even understand the other seventh years. But the rest of them…
Harry fought the urge to reach out to her, to try to comfort her. He’d never spoken to this girl before, he probably wouldn’t have recognized her were it not for Ravenna’s face fixed in his mind, Malfoy’s mention of her.
Draco’s jaw clenched. “He—was.” A mixture of fear and loathing flickered past his gaze. “I managed to figure it out on my own.”
Harry’s head turned, not far enough to banish the figure, but he had to see something. He had to know…
The slit-like nostrils flared, the last, violent green light burned and pulsed around Voldemort’s wand—fear contracted the irises of his red eyes.
The reverberation of that contact shot down Harry’s spine with force. Tom’s mouth twitched, a mirror of the grin he’d given Harry over Goyle’s dead body, only this time Harry could feel it, the amusement, the conspiratorial intent, like a whisper on his neck, a tendril of thought snaking into his ear.
“Kingsley can’t know about this.” Harry shook his head, horrified. Even as he said it, though, he couldn’t imagine a scenario where Kingsley didn’t know everything that was going on in this building. But still, “There’s no way—”
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, relieved. “Yeah. I didn’t mean anything by it, I swear.” He didn’t know if he was talking to the house at this point or Kreacher, but maybe there wasn’t really a difference.
In the silence as she considered him, he had the horrible realization that Luna was quite close to Ginny. It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to think Ginny had confided in her about their night of sad, disappointing sex. The pathetic coda to a relationship which had been crawling on by a string.
Strangely, Harry also felt approximately none of the anger he’d thought he would feel the next time he saw Malfoy. Annoyance, sure, but… Well. Maybe he was just tired. Maybe that was why he was still staring when Malfoy looked at him with a frown.
And he knew with a distant guilt that he was the one who’d changed, not any of the Weasleys, not the people who had welcomed him as family the moment he entered their home. It was his fault. Or maybe it was the little shard of Voldemort, knowing it was there inside his head and had always been there.
boy?” a horrible, rasping voice spat into the courtyard. It sent a shard of fury into Harry’s heart. The sharp click of heels punctuated Bellatrix’s outrage as she continued, “You should be prostrate at his feet! You
He controlled himself quickly, drawing up and facing Harry like he had always expected him to arrive. Like it was all falling into place exactly as he had intended it to.
He said nothing out loud, but he couldn’t help but wonder how useless the sentiment was. Kingsley was the Minister for Magic. He could go anywhere he bloody liked.
Forcing himself to inch forward, Harry crawled with his heart in his throat until he could fumble for his wand. He hesitated before he pulled, waiting for Goyle to move, willing it to be some stupid trick. Some feint to get Harry to come close enough to finish the jo.
Harry didn’t know how to answer, so he just crossed his arms, trying not to shiver too much from the exertion of standing. Circe’s tits, he was tired. Maybe he should have postponed this for a time he didn’t feel like collapsing to the floor and never getting back up.
“It’s been a nightmare, to tell you the truth, but,” Percy cleared his throat, “well, that’s war for you.”
When Charlie Weasley appeared through the smoke, followed by an army of house-elves, Slughorn charging after with another wave of witches and wizards, Harry’s heart picked up pace. It wasn’t hope or relief but it was enough to cut through the deadening anger working its way up his throat.
He wasn’t. Or if he was, it didn’t bother him. He’d gone hungry enough as a kid not to notice it anymore, and for some reason he didn’t care about the physical needs of his body right now. He wasn’t punishing himself, but eating and sleeping felt like something only people who weren’t murderers were allowed to do.
Something wrapped around his ankle. He jumped and tried to shake it off. It tugged. He fell down to his knees, what was left of the flowers crushed beneath his hands. The rustling grew louder, pulsed with the quick beating of his heart.
“You’ll be checking in with me twice a day,” Bill said giving Harry a look of bare frustration, “so I’ll be more than happen to pass that along. If you like,” he added to Robards.
Harry watched, transfixed, as Tom Riddle kissed the inside of his wrist. The contact made Harry’s eyelids flutter as a heady wave washed over him. It was nothing, barely a whisper, but it vanished any more doubt from his mind. He wanted this, wanted
his magic. It was so fragile, so precious, this thing that came from inside him and out of the air, up from the ground, shaped by his own words.
Harry hesitated. It was one thing to explain to people who understood his dynamic with Malfoy that he had assumed right away he was doing something wrong and then obsessively watched him the rest of the year, another to tell that to professional law enforcement officers. He had a feeling Robards might not buy the
This was the last day of trials. The last day of walking into the Ministry and looking into the eyes of the actual monsters who were to blame for the war, the death eaters who’d killed people he loved and the Ministry officials who’d stood there and watched, then he was done. He wouldn’t have to walk through the mob of journalists and photographers every morning. He wouldn’t have to listen to all the horrible details recounted again and again, listen to the names of the dead, the lists of atrocities committed against muggleborns and anyone who stood up for them or against Voldemort.
“I know you didn’t mean to kill Gregory Goyle. Your account matches what we found at the scene, and as he was formally charged with multiple counts of murder and battery earlier today, I’m inclined to believe him fully capable of attempting to kill you.” He looked up, his dark eyes filled with a strange kind of sadness. “The formal investigation will take some time, so this isn’t official, but I’m not going to charge you with anything. Neither is anyone else from the Office of Magical Law Enforcement. What you did, you did in self defense.”
Still Malfoy didn’t move. Harry knew he should close his eyes. Keeping them open this long would only increase the chances of someone seeing him and reacting before he was ready. He didn’t know yet his plan. He didn’t know what to do and he couldn’t think it through. It was as if he had abandoned his mind in the nebulous white expanse he’d witnessed after Voldemort’s Killing Curse struck him.
On the ground a body twitched. It was bloody and naked and he couldn’t tear his eyes from the face. He’d done that to her face…
He was in a decidedly nicer suit and robes, though he had left the tie out and looked about ten times more at ease than his brother, who was wearing official-looking black and white Ministry robes. But that was hardly fair, as Bill always looked cool and polished. If he didn’t like Bill so much he would find it frustrating.
“You mean the aunt who tortured Neville’s parents, killed Sirius, and carved a slur into Hermione’s arm?” Harry watched Ron’s conflicted guilt morph back into stubborn defiance. “You’re gonna call me out for defending Slytherins and in the same breath—”
Harry looked slowly from the stack of books back to Kreacher, a strange prickling of awareness making the hair on the back of his neck rise. “These are…they belonged to Regulus?”
“He’ll be fine.” She gave Bill a relieved smile, patting Harry gently on his uninjured leg. Her voice was shaking a bit, like her iron control was breaking now Harry wasn’t in danger of dying. “You did a fine job stabilizing him, Bill. I’m not sure he would have made it a few more minutes without it. Now I just need to heal everything else. But first, I think a cup of tea.”
“There’s a reason you’re just hearing about this,” Bill said as he slid into the seat next to Harry, divvying up drinks. “For
Harry hissed and fell onto his arse, recoiling at once. “Bloody hell,” he bit out. But it was just a small prick, a tiny smear of blood over the pad of his finger, like he’d accidentally jabbed himself with a needle.
He had no idea what he was going to do tomorrow, but thought he might to disappear for a while, get out of London and away from all of this. He was pretty sure Bill wouldn’t want him back at Shell Cottage after he’d read the article, and he didn’t want to try the Weasleys. He had no idea what Ginny would think, but he knew it wouldn’t be good. Ron had already kicked him out once.
All throughout May he gave statements to Ministry officials filling them in on what he and Ron and Hermione had been doing—the bare details, mind, just enough to make them stop asking questions—shuffled from one place to the next, trying to figure out how someone existed as a normal person again after so long on the run. He was so numb he didn’t mind so much that he frequently forgot what day it was or where he would spent the night. The pieces of his life had been so thoroughly shattered and scattered, he was left with the simple task of putting himself back together into some semblance of a functioning human being.
“Frankly,” Kingsley said, leaning forward to brace his elbows on his knees, face stony, “you being the victim of these attacks isn’t so much the issue here, Harry.”
things attending Hogwarts for six years with Peeves. Remus had touched on them briefly in Harry’s third year, but went no further than explaining how dangerous they were, and how hard they were to banish. If possible, it was better to make nice with the restless spirit and figure out how to cohabit. And if you couldn’t, it was probably best if you left the house to the spirit. Much easier to pick up and move than deal with an angry poltergeist.
For some reason, the image of Malfoy walking into his house alone after it had been witness to so much horror made him intensely uncomfortable. It wasn’t pity. It was too angry to be pity, but he couldn’t for the life of him pin it down.
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that, another wave of guilt souring his stomach. He truly didn’t think he’d ever be able to accept the absolute servitude of house-elves, and he didn’t think he wanted to. “Right. Well. I can certainly look through them, if you want.”
Andromeda crossed her arms, eyes sweeping unerringly over Kingsley and Robards. Her head tilted and a ghost of the pureblooded Black family came into her pose. “I think I will. Coffee?” she asked Harry.
“You treat children like soldiers and you wonder why they fight back. Take away their families, their homes, and tell them it’s
Harry didn’t know how to respond. He wanted to kick Ron out and just walk away, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it yet, like there was still some part of him that thought it was mad the way he was acting.
“It’s all right.” Bill gave him a long look. “I just invited you out for drinks when this is done. Charlie’s in town for a few weeks and Ron and Hermione want to meet up at the Leaky Cauldron for supper.”
The next few days of questioning went by as slowly as the first, except now Harry had lost whatever good will for the Ministry he’d managed to drum up over the last few months—making the whole process that much more painful. It didn’t help that Proulx seemed determined to provoke Harry whenever he could. Kamau and Robards continued to be friendly but firm, though Robards seemed to sense Harry’s lack of enthusiasm and was doing his best to reassure Harry that his department was aware of their past failings and committed to reforming. More than once, he admitted its flaws, and hinted heavily that he’d need new blood to shake things up. Young people who understood the risks, knew firsthand how to defend themselves.
Not for the first time, the knowledge that Dumbledore had effectively chosen that life for him sat heavy like a stone in his stomach.
was what he had over Voldemort. No matter how broken, how battered, how tired he was, he would never stop feeling everything with an intensity which made his whole body shake. An intensity Voldemort could not bear. So if he had to rip himself open again, one last time, he would take it.
The auror looked over his shoulder to the large clock hanging on the wall above the lifts. “Right. Well.” His demeanor shifted, confusion to embarrassed anger. “I’ll be waiting, Malfoy.” The man sent another baffled look at Harry before he turned and left.
A flash of grey-white light cut through the living room, followed by heat and the quick sensation of all the air being vacated from his lungs. His injured hand was pulsing as if he’d clenched it without meaning to. Pain launched up his arm and slammed into his chest—
“Of course not. It’s because I’m taking this so seriously that I want to make sure I give you my full and enthusiastic cooperation with any and all parts of this trial.”
The impression he got, however, was one of fevered, thorough research. More than a few times it looked as if the quill had broken where Regulus had pressed too hard, large splotches of ink in the middle of a paragraph, tiny rips in the parchment. As he flipped through more of the pages he saw slight discolorations in places—water marks, he realized with a lurch.
Andromeda took his hand, folding it in both of hers and holding it tight. She looked down but not before Harry caught the tear rolling down her cheek.
Her eyes brushed over him and rested on Hermione, something speculative about her gaze, before she turned again to Edlefina. “I think you’ve bothered the Gryffindors enough, don’t you, dear?” she said primly, her voice perfectly composed. “You’ve said what you meant, and now it’s best to leave things be.”
Hermione blinked, concern making her brows shoot up at once. “No. I haven’t gotten a chance yet, I’ve only been back a few days.” She went quiet and leaned toward him. “What’s wrong? Did something—”
“Harry, you must not—” Hermione exhaled. “There must be more to the story. He was lying to you. He must have been.”
“Pity,” Ron said with an exaggerated sigh. “Can’t go wrong with a good reenactment. But maybe that’s for the actual trials. Dramatic readings? A few pencil sketches?” He chuckled to himself.
It was the first thing Kreacher had hidden when Sirius came back to his old home. The first of many, it seemed.
I have to disagree. Why else would you invite me to testify in front of the full Wizengamot if you didn’t want me to honestly recount what happened to me and other Hogwarts students during the war?” He couldn’t help but look at Kingsley, finding an impassive, intent mask.
He’d seen Malfoy less than an hour ago. Was it less than an hour? It couldn’t have been that long ago…
He stopped, staring through the window looking down onto the green in front of the building. Traffic lights reflected off the drops of water, flashing red, then green, then red again. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, and when he opened them he thought he saw a shape move behind one of the trees. He relaxed when another figure walked up to the tree and pulled the first out, both of them disappearing slowly down the road.
Harry’s mind had entered a strange place of discomfort and disbelief as he’d listened, as if he’d been absent for the whole conversation and just walked in near the end to find Draco Malfoy being helpful and borderline pleasant to both him and Bill. Like the world had flipped on its axis and no one else noticed.
Not the monster he was at the end, nor the unsettling child in the orphanage. He dreamt of Tom Riddle, the handsome schoolboy, with his devilish smile and glittering black eyes.
the woman—sounded like a woman, anyway—exclaimed and clapped her hands. “I say, I never thought I’d be able to meet you myself.” A white shape shoved toward his face. It was probably her hand, but Harry had been wrong before. Another woman had asked him to sign the handle of her umbrella ten minutes ago. Five minutes before that a man had wanted him to touch his handkerchief for luck. As if that made any kind of sense. The six others before them had only wanted to introduce themselves and thank him and then leave him alone, which had been fine when he was eleven and still found it novel when people didn’t actively sneer at him or ignore him entirely, but now it was somewhat annoying. It made him feel like a circus attraction. Difficult even when he had the patience, near impossible now when he wanted to piss off and go scream into a wall for a few hours.
When he opened his eyes, the dream was gone, but he couldn’t catch his breath. He could remember nothing, only the rabbit-quick beating of his heart and the curl of—
At the end of the hallway a door opened and a tall, thick man with white hair and a face hewn from granite stepped out and spotted Harry and Bill. “Mr. Potter.”
“Right. I’ll take your word for it.” Harry cleared his throat, silently accepting that he didn’t want to know why Luna knew what spark plugs tasted like. “I, uh, wouldn’t know anything about buzzsprites.”
It was gone just as quickly, vanished with the last of his anger, but Harry couldn’t stop staring down at his hands, letting them fall to the damp grass and tremble as he caught his breath.
“Okay,” Bill murmured. “Okay.” He looked up at Andromeda where she was hovering in the doorway to the kitchen. “I’m going to have to leave to deal with this, Andromeda. Can you—”
Harry kept his eyes down, knowing nothing would be there even if he did look. It was just darkness and emptiness, a wide berth left by the spiders scuttling around him. Getting away from whatever it was. Truly, it would be his luck if a basilisk was living under the cellar of Grimmauld Place. Why not? At least he’d know how to fight a basilisk, assuming he could find a sword somewhere made by goblins. The Blacks probably had one stashed away somewhere.
He had hidden himself away from the world. It was what he’d wanted, but it still sat heavy in his stomach. He wondered if everyone who’d known where this place was would realize right away, or if they’d be none the wiser until they tried to remember where he lived, only to find a blank space.
People could change, sure, but Harry couldn’t shake his own disbelief. He couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy alone in that dark house, deciding to open his doors and pull back the the curtain on all the wealth and history his family had amassed over however many hundreds of years. Malfoy deciding to give information on people he knew were dangerous and would most likely kill him for it if they found out.
Kingsley studied him closely. “Usually, when a Fidelius Charm has broken, it’s impossible to recast on the same place.”
Another silence leaked out of the window toward Harry, flowing into his nose and down his throat as he struggled to remain silent. Heart beating in his ears. Hands clenched at his sides.
A tall, thin slash of light amidst the soft expanse of sand and sea. They were just standing there. Waiting. They seemed to notice him after a while, not turning exactly, but Harry felt their attention.
Harry could feel the tension rolling off Malfoy even without looking at him, could practically hear the beating pulse of his blood as he forced himself not to rise to the bait.
“No, no,” Harry said quietly. “No, I won’t punish you. If there’s something dangerous you’re hiding, as in something that could blow up the house or something, I’d ask for you to let me know, but otherwise…” He sighed. He couldn’t exactly tell Kreacher to turn out his pockets for anything dark. Harry was a fucking horcrux, after all. “Look, I just want to make this as easy on us as possible, yeah? You, me…the house,” he added, stopping himself from eyeing the rafters. “We’re all stuck here together. I don’t want to make it worse.”
“It’s the Prophet,” Harry laughed, grabbing it and finishing his coffee, the heat scalding his throat in a pleasant, smoky way, “of course I won’t like it.”
“She was fourteen and being attacked by a group of highly-trained witches and wizards, but she knew what she was doing, right? She deserved to die? It was justified when one of your aurors let a Killing Curse slip out? And Geraldine White? Bradford Belmont? How long have they been in Azkaban? Two months now, isn’t it? I imagine they’re where they belong beside men and women who were in Voldemort’s inner circle, the most dangerous witches and wizards in Britain who spent years doing unspeakably vile things? Who murdered and tortured and fought to silence anyone who stood against the man they followed without question? That seems a fitting punishment for two fifteen-year-old kids, doesn’t it?”
He still didn’t know if he believed it. Malfoy had been an arrogant snake his whole life—right up until sixth year when his fangs proved to be far less lethal than anyone expected.
Sure they would. If it fell in line with what they wanted. Of course they’d want Hermione to support them. All of Britain knew she was clever and brilliant. Her vote of confidence would be nearly as powerful as Harry’s.
Neville reached her before Nagini, throwing out his hand to grab the hilt Hermione struggled to dislodge. Nagini’s fangs glinted with the light of magic raging around her as she reared up before them, poison dripping from each curved point.
He’d never sat down and had a serious conversation with himself about…this, and honestly, he’d had very little time to think about romance in his life, sixth year withstanding. Bit hard to worry about who you wanted to snog when you suffered from the frequent misfortune of nearly dying once or twice a year. And even in sixth, when did have space and time and energy to devote to losing his mind over someone he wanted to kiss, he’d thought about
Harry wiped his face clean of his conflict, unable to say anything, afraid if he opened his mouth something horrible would come spilling out.
“No,” Harry repeated, something like adrenaline pumping through him, lending him strength. “I’m not going to the Ministry.”
She looked for a moment like she wasn’t going to let him off that easy, but something in his eyes must have convinced her, because she just pursed her lips and nodded. “If that’s what you want.”
At least half the names were surprises and there was one bloke in Ravenclaw who had apparently tested a few dangerous new hexes out on the younger kids whom he’d never even heard of.
Finally, Robards looked away over Harry’s shoulder. “Thank you for letting us use your home, Andromeda.”
His gaze wandered as the hours dragged on, alighting on all the empty spaces where he imagined dead students or Order members should have been. He searched the hall with dull, uncaring eyes, only to get stuck on Malfoy and his parents at the far end. And to remain stuck.
More people were muttering now, the noise lifting and swirling around him like a whirlpool. Water laced with ribbons of red. Blood. His blood. Blood of the kids in this room and Ravenna Lamar and Colin and Denis and Lavender and Fred and all the others who died to protect their home and their friends, to fight, when they should have been learning how to live.
“Come on, girls,” she shouted, dancing expertly out of the way of Hannah’s Body-Bind Curse, deflecting Luna’s attempt to disarm her. Ginny clutched at her arm where a fresh gash was leaking blood, face screwed up in pain, wand swinging wildly. “Let’s see which one of you—”
He looked around the courtroom, seeing the shocked, frightened, angry faces of witches and wizards who were older and wiser and
He slipped his glasses off and pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes, bending over and allowing himself a small groan. Maybe he would just leave. Chance a walk outside to clear his head. He could meet Bill and the others later when he felt more sociable. He didn’t know how the fuck he was supposed to just sit here—
“You don’t think I realize exactly how insane this is?” he asked, voice cracking. He could barely understand himself over the roaring of blood in his ears. “I
It might have taken only a few minutes or an hour to find them all and to grasp them, but Harry kept on until every single bead was connected to the tip of his wand. He felt them all hanging there waiting, a brilliant, refracted mosaic of white light.
It was exhilarating as he continued to study the book. He felt, impossibly, like the more time he ran his fingers over the pages, the more time he casually attempted to replicate them himself, the more he could intuit the meanings held within.
The person who had walked calmly to his death would have told them. He would have told them straight away and let them carry some of the pain that festered in his chest like rot. That person would have been more understanding to all the people who wanted to thank him, to touch him, to cry on him and praise him. He would have taken it as a responsibility to be there for everyone, to help them, and so help himself. He should want to be with them, shouldn’t he?
Kreacher looked healthier as well, his skin a bit more pink than grey and not as sagging as it had once been. Apparently, he’d improved along with the house. As he ate, trying to ignore Kreacher’s fierce and silent attention, Harry wondered if the house was as sentient as other wizarding homes. The Burrow should have fallen apart years ago, but you could feel the spirit of the house the moment you walked in, the warmth and comfort, like it was more than happy to hold itself together for its family. It was the only example of a wizarding home he had any extended experience with. He’d only been to two others—Luna’s and Malfoy’s, so he wasn’t exactly sure, and it’s not like he’d been to either place long enough to sit and take full stock of the general atmosphere of the house.
Felicity nodded, her expression grim. “We normally don’t respond to random emergency calls—we’re trained to take down threats and neutralize attacks which could get out of hand quickly. Volatile dark wizards, riots, that sort of thing.”
before Harry’d learned who the Half-Blood Prince was. Hermione would have said it was too vague, the theory behind it thin and subjective, at best ineffective and at worst dangerous—there were too many risk factors involved with such a simple spell.
Slowly, he turned back to Yeats. She was watching him with wide-eyed fury, her olive skin sallow, her hands still braced against the desk as if they were permanently fixed there. When Harry met her gaze, she flinched.
Had he just imagined a random girl, then? One who was tall and wire-fit and had a deep voice? He never thought that’d be his type, if he was being honest, but then… Having a type implied that he’d given any kind of thought to the issue. Which he hadn’t, really.
This apparently was news to Robards, his brow furrowing sharply. “We have testimony from Draco Malfoy that there was no one present in the tower except for the persons later identified as Alecto Carrow, Fenrir Greyback, Severus Snape, and Albus Dumbledore himself.”
“Whatever you think about Prunelia Yeats,” Robards said quietly, “she’s a decent woman, who understands the need for discretion when it comes to sensitive matters.”
The path leading through the park was empty, secluded in the very center where there was only grass and clutches of trees. He’d come here once when he was younger on a school trip and gotten lost, only to end up trailing around a small herd of deer. His teacher had gone mental, of course, and the Dursleys had locked him in his cupboard for nearly a week, letting him out only to use the toilet and drink from the faucet, shoving some bread and crushed crisp packets at him before kicking him back in. Thinking back, it was almost comical to realize how many little, impossible things had popped into his life before he understood what they meant. A doe in this park. A snake in that zoo. It was all so bloody clear.
“Hello to you too, Malfoy.” Harry considered standing up, feeling strangely imbalanced while looking up at him, but then he thought—no, better to do nothing and make Malfoy do all the work. “I step on a cat or something to offend the universe and summon you out of your hell hole?”
Harry firmed up his resolve, trying to shove away the last inklings of his own guilt. “I just wanted to make sure we had an understanding.”
Within a day of them getting back and settled into the Burrow, he noticed the shift. The flood of emotions he had felt at seeing her in the Room of the Requirement before the battle had gone. Touching her didn’t bring the same spark, the same gentle excitement of stealing happiness from the general shite of his life. Watching her from across the room as she laughed and smiled made him feel like he was staring into a sun which no longer felt warm but blinding and sharp. Like he had kept his eyes closed for so long he couldn’t bear to look at her anymore. When they kissed, he felt nothing, just a weird sense of disconnect. It felt more like when Cho had kissed him through her tears—when he had been confused and more than a bit petrified. Nice, he supposed, but not the kind of nice kissing Ginny used to be. Not the kind of nice he lost himself in. Just…nice. The kind of nice where Harry was so focused on the mechanics of where his hands were and how much spit he was producing and wondering how the fuck he had enjoyed this before if it was so bloody weird now.
If anything, Malfoy was far worse than the rest of them, even Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the bags under his eyes so dark they looked bruised. He’d lost weight. It had been too chaotic at Malfoy Manor and in the Room of Requirement but now Harry was paying attention. Malfoy was a shell of the boy who had stood in front of Dumbledore and chosen not to kill him.
Malfoy looked away, waving a hand dismissively through the air. “I can practically hear you thinking I’m a hypocrite.”
Harry turned, picking up Teddy to deposit him on the couch before he could get himself stuck under it. “I’ll be right back,” he added to Andromeda when it looked like she might object. He threw a glance to Bill too. “Were you…?”
Voldemort snarled, stabbing his wand forward only for it to glance off the concave shell of Harry’s shield. “I am the master of
Harry wasn’t quick enough to hide his flinch. He tried to rally, but hearing her name spoken out loud, by Malfoy, was like a shock to his chest.
“Don’t be too hard on yourself.” Bill smiled gently. “You’re not the first eighteen-year-old wizard to have no fucking clue what he wants to do with his life. You’ve got time to figure it out, Harry.”
“You can’t pull that with me, Hermione. You know there’s a difference between the people in black hoods and masks and the kids we went to school with. There’s no
ANYWAY I love you all very much and thank you for being so wonderful in your comments, I know I'm kind of plodding along with this fic right now but I'm hoping to finish drafting the thing by the end of the month and then I can start posting a hell of a lot faster. there are just a lot of moving pieces and I want to make sure things are cohesive-ish.
The sun had only recently set so the dusk was still fading out as he followed the path down into a little patch of trees between two hills. The sky was soft purple and indigo, small traces of pink and red still hovering over the horizon. It was second nature to look around, the practice ingrained in him since he’d spent a year camping in various forests all across England. The absence of Hermione and Ron felt all the more potent as he stopped and leaned against the trunk of a huge, gnarled oak, letting his head fall back and his eyes close.
The moment it hit his tongue, he nearly screamed. It felt like acid pouring down his throat. He started shaking with the effort not to move, and Andromeda had to hold her hand over his mouth to make sure he drank it all. She took her hand away and Bill shoved something else into his mouth, something rubbery.
“Hey,” Bill said softly, gripping Harry’s shoulder, “you’re just answering questions, right? That’s all it is.”
Her hand lingered on Harry’s cheek as she studied him. They stood in silence for a while. Harry kept looking into her eyes expecting to see someone else looking back at him. But it was just her. Just Andromeda Tonks. A woman who had lost her husband and daughter, a woman whose family had turned their backs on her. Someone else without a family.
Harry watched Malfoy take three strides away from him. A weird, sudden desire to explain himself took over, before he stood. “Malfoy.”
Problem was, the idea of going back to Grimmauld Place until the trials started up was about as enticing as the prospect of listening to his two best friends fuck. It was the only place he could store all his stuff, though, so he’d made a go of it. He tried to sleep there his first night alone—he even made himself have a pleasant conversation with Kreacher about all the work he had done to fix the place up, so he was,
“Thankfully, metamorphmagi are not able to change their body shape too much. Can you imagine? Babies are enough of a handful. He likes to get heavier when it’s bath time, though. I swear, he gains four stone every time he hears the water running.”
Andromeda didn’t meet his gaze as she began healing his ribs. Harry grimaced through the few minutes of spellwork, but when it was done he could breathe easy again. His lungs didn’t hurt every time they expanded, anyway. She backed away when it was done, her expression closed off and impassive. The kettle began to whistle and she looked like she was rooted to the spot before her eyes closed and she left again.
Edlefina blinked furiously and nodded, ducking her head to hide her tears. “Yes. I…” She gave Harry one last pained smile. “I…thank you. I’m fine, Daphne,” she added when it looked like Daphne was about to put an arm around her. She turned and walked back to the group, shoulders hunched.
“Yeah,” Ron said, harsh, “and you just killed the most powerful dark wizard in the last century. I don’t see how him being our age excuses him from being an evil git. It’s not like
Harry stared at the place he’d disappeared for a long time, rubbing the ring between his thumb and forefinger. He considered putting it on, just to see if it fit, but it’d be his luck if he got stuck with a cursed ring after everything else. Better to keep it off, for now. He slid it into his pocket. With a distracted sigh, he eased down into the chair, staring warily at the gas lamp. He assumed it wasn’t real fire. Kreacher wouldn’t risk Regulus’s things being so near an open flame, even one caged in by glass.
Harry reached out and pulled, hand finding purchase on the thin, shaking form—sharp and white and flickering, they gasped.
He left twenty minutes sooner than he meant to, tired and irritable, in the cheap suit and robes he’d bought on Andromeda’s recommendation, his hair as tame as he could make it. It was probably too long but he wasn’t about to try cutting it himself and show up to the Ministry with great chunks of hair missing. His hair grew back fast but not
That hot fist formed in Harry’s chest again, a tangled thing he wanted gone. “Right. So he just went back to his house, after Hogwarts?”
“Look, you’re new here, so you probably don’t know that the Ministry hasn’t exactly been kind to me in the past.” Harry couldn’t help it—his fists clenched as the burn of the scars etched into the top of his left hand itched. “Believe me when I say I’d rather not be here. But I was asked, so I came. Either you value my opinion and my answers, or you don’t. It really makes no difference to me. Trust me, I stopped betting on the Ministry a long time ago. No offense,” he added to Robards, imagining that glowing recommendation from Kingsley whither and die. “So unless you’re going to insist I take veritaserum, which I’ll refuse to do, you’re going to have to take my word.”
Standing in the little, quiet sitting room, looking up at a man who was nearly a decade older, someone he admired, Harry felt more of the tethers of his childhood slip away. He’d been of age for over a year, and on his own without help from any adult for most of that time. He’d seen more struggle than most would ever see in their whole lives, gone through worse than most people could possibly conceive.
Malfoy’s confusion had turned into a strange kind of amusement. “They were at Hogwarts during Snape’s tenure. They followed orders from the death eaters who taught them. They’re
“And I fancy trying out for the Holyhead Harpies,” she said with a laugh. “I really think I’ve got a shot this year.”
The same age he was when Voldemort came back, when he watched Cedric get murdered. Had the other two—Geraldine White and Bradford Belmont—seen her go down? Had they watched her die?
The idea that he was already reliant on Kreacher and his slavish devotion made Harry feel a bit sick.
A strange panic and helplessness rose up inside Harry, knowing with absolute conviction that this situation was wrong. A vital part of the world order had slipped out of place and everything had taken on a weird, unsettling filter. All of this was wrong.
“How did you find me?” Harry’s voice was breaking, rough. The ocean waves crashed and the gulls over his head cried out in bell tones that something was different, changing. “Why—why are you here?”
Bill turned to Andromeda as he scrubbed a hand through his hair. He was still wearing his Ministry robes, but there was blood on his collar and tie. Harry’s blood. “I can’t thank you enough, Andromeda. Truly.”
The next thing he knew she was under him with her clothes off and his clothes had come off as well and this was the moment, if it was going to happen, it was going to happen now. So…he made it happen.
When Harry next awoke, he felt…well, he felt tired as hell but otherwise, suspiciously good. He wiped the drool from his mouth and propped himself up on his elbows, confused for a moment as to why he was wearing his trousers and shoes in bed. It almost sent him down a spiral thinking he was back in the wilderness camping with Ron and Hermione.
the war, though?” Harry asked. “Seems like we could have used the help a year ago. Now it’s just a slap in the face, isn’t it? ‘Sorry about all those people who died, but here are a few aurors who can come in and start telling you how to punish your own bloody citizens.’ ”
As he stared crestfallen at his plant, however, he saw the detritus shift. A tentative bud popped out from the soil and refuse—deep red and oddly metallic. It rose higher, growing faster, and soon there were more buds sprouting beside it, twisting and intertwining together until the central stem was made up of smaller stalks covered in tiny barbs. They rose nearly a foot in height, much taller than the original plant had been, and began to split. Wide, serrated leaves grew out of the seams, their color closer to blood and veined in threads of black and brown. Petals blossomed over them, emerging as a single bud and then unfurling all at once to reveal shimmering indigo and violet flesh, expelling a faint cloud of shimmering dust.
Maybe it would have been better if he’d died in Godric’s Hollow with them. If it meant being spared this…this horrible, ragged longing for something he would never have, maybe it would have been better.
“Yeah. Sorry, Kreacher.” Harry grimaced and stepped up to the desk, hoping it was sturdier than it looked. “I’ll—I’d be happy to look through this stuff.”
He stood amongst crumbled rocks, took in the twisted metal railing, the broken glass scattered here and there across the floor, the wide open view of the grounds beneath him—the Astronomy Tower. He had apparated to the Astronomy Tower.
Sharp and subtle, this intruder. He knew without knowing how that it wasn’t the first time they’d visited his dreams. Or perhaps it was the other way around. He couldn’t say what the difference was, really.
The hawthorn wand vibrated in Harry’s grip as he pulled off the invisibility cloak. His Shield Charm held for Voldemort’s second attack, a lance of screaming orange fire directed straight at Draco’s heart. Harry felt the heat from almost fifty feet away. Draco lunged back and nearly fell to the ground. Eyes wild and shining with tears, he searched the crowd.
Draco shouted with effort as he dodged a familiar jet of green light. Harry’s heart lurched forward. His wand jerked up as he remembered the last time Bellatrix had sent a Killing Curse in his presence. The image of Sirius’s last smile was imprinted onto his soul and he could feel time folding in on itself.
“I’m not sure, that is—I think Professor Dumbledore suspected Voldemort chose Malfoy—Draco,” Harry added, frowning, “to punish his father, for being caught and arrested at the battle which took place a year before. Here. In the Department of Mysteries.” He swallowed the painful knot in his throat. “I don’t think he ever expected Draco to succeed. I think he always meant for—Severus Snape to be the one who killed him.”
“It’s sitting on the table, Harry.” Andromeda walked over to him, kneeling down just like Bill had. Hesitantly, she reached out and took Harry’s left hand, heedless of the blood flaking over his skin.
Another shroud of silence settled over them. Harry stared down at his pulsing right hand, the yellow and green light of Andromeda’s magic coating it with a slight shimmer—like a glove of liquid citrine.
“Oh, no, it doesn’t have to be, if they’re the good kind. I don’t have my spectrespecs with me right now, I lent them to Rolf, so I can’t tell for sure. Do you feel an unusual amount of gloom lately?”
He threaded his hands behind his neck, stretching—and then an idea cut through the static. He checked the time and winced. It was probably too late, but he could try. He felt some glimmer of hope for the first time in twenty-four hours and he knew he’d stay up all night if he didn’t do something. He knelt by the fireplace and picked up a dash of floo powder, certainty making his heart beat a bit slower.
A seagull startled him as it landed on the roof of the cottage, making him jerk to the side a bit and send a stone rolling down the hill. He wasn’t trying to hide or listen in but he knew Bill and Kingsley would stop if he announced himself. Bill and Fleur might not walk on eggshells around him but Bill definitely tried to keep talk about the Ministry to a minimum. Harry had appreciated it before, not wanting to hear about what a colossal mess it must still be so soon after Voldemort’s death.
His voice rang through the room, pinging off the high ceilings. He couldn’t help but remember how Bellatrix’s crazed laughter had rebounded over the sleek black tiles in Dumbledore’s memory, filling the space and making it feel like a tunnel you were falling through.
“On accident,” Robards said, a measure of authority entering his voice again. “If you’ve been lying to us for the past thirty minutes, and you actually did intend to murder Gregory Goyle when you left the Ministry tonight, please—tell me. Even if I thought you were that kind of person, which I don’t think you are,” he added as Harry tried to interrupt, “I still think you’d be honest about it if pressed. Am I wrong?”
The image of a woman suspended over a long, dark table, hooded figures surrounding her, laughing at her as a snake coiled near Voldemort at the end—whispering, pleading, with Snape as he sat impassively beneath her—a pale sliver of a boy unable to stop looking up at her in horror…
Harry nodded as he took his seat, getting the distinct impression from Proulx that he had very little intention of letting Harry off easy. With thick black hair streaked with grey and impenetrable blue eyes so dark they might as well be black, sharp, aristocratic features marred by more than a few scars, and a lean frame which Harry guessed would unfold into an even greater height than Robards, the man looked like he would be just at home in an opera house or cage fight. There was even a scar running through the left side of his mouth, under the groomed mustache.
His body felt strangely disconnected from his mind, which was horribly, painfully aware his best friend had… She’d… His mouth was moving before he realized what he was saying, pulled up from the same hollow void he’d been living in since the day Voldemort died.
He awoke in fits and starts, awareness coming on gradually. His body throbbed. Pain lanced through his head. He screwed up his face to keep his eyes closed, his broken shout muffled by the dirt beneath him.
my parents. Stealing my title as best Gryffindor seeker in a hundred years. Very rude, you know.” Charlie grinned and winked. “If I were a lesser man, I’d be jealous.”
Harry gently nudged Kreacher around, trying to stop another fit of crying before it began. “All right. I trust you.”
But…” She trailed off, looking over Harry’s shoulder where Ron was probably standing at the bar. “I don’t know. It’s fine. Ron is just. You know.”
Gritting his teeth and muttering, “Sod this,” he picked at the little scab which had healed over on his middle finger. A drop of blood welled up again, and before he could stop himself he pressed it onto the page where he thought the writing began.
“What? No, I—” Harry cleared his throat. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with…you lot. I’m not part of the Ministry.”
The reality of his life became too much to deal with, sitting there in his own chair in his own flat with no one expecting him anywhere, just—living. As a person. Instead of marinating in his own numbing thoughts, he locked up, fortified the existing wards and layered on a few he’d used when he was on the run with Hermione and Ron, realizing after that there was nothing inside of value since the majority of his things were split between Grimmauld Place, the Burrow, and Shell Cottage, and went for a drink at the Leaky Cauldron. This turned out to be bloody stupid, because the moment he stepped inside he was swarmed by well-wishers and grateful witches and wizards who began crying and telling him about all the people they had lost in the war, as if Harry wanted to know. He managed to drink one pint over the course of an hour before he finally bailed, having to duck out the back door and sprint down the street before a group of old men tried to get him to sing another rendition of Odo the Hero.
“Right, it is.” Felicity looked like she was holding herself back from asking anything more, as if she saw Harry’s expression and realized he wasn’t in a sharing mood. “Unlike fiendfyre, though, the caster has a very small window of opportunity to reverse the spread, to pull it back into themselves. Fiendfyre will burn for a long time, but it will stop, eventually, once it runs out of fuel. This curse doesn’t have the same limitations. The last recorded incident occurred in 1605, when an entire island in the Hebrides disintegrated and vanished into the ocean, along with the fifteen hundred people who lived on it.” She fiddled with her glasses, skin gone pale. “I can’t even imagine what it might have done here, in London. The level of destruction—”
You’re not the only one with scars, Harry,” she said, voice choked. Her hand jerked, almost as if she was going to clutch at her forearm where Bellatrix had cut into her skin.
Harry hadn’t seen the Minister for Magic since the week after the battle, when he had gripped Harry’s shoulder tight and thanked him, giving him a sad but warm smile. It had been nice. Harry had always liked Kingsley. It made him a hell of a lot more willing to trust the Ministry for choosing someone he knew had the best intentions. Once he’d taken office, though, he had necessarily not been around much anymore. If Bill and Arthur were overworked, Kingsley must be run ragged.
“Yes, Draco,” Voldemort said with a smile in his voice, dripping with satisfaction and the promise of violence. “Your parents have been worried! How they plead for your life even after you left them behind. There’s no need to pretend anymore. Come and greet me as your victorious lord.” Harry almost scowled at the saccharine tone, the utter control and relish in every word. Voldemort really thought it was over. He thought he had won.
Ron laughed, eyes wide like he thought Harry was putting him on. “Yeah, cause he was too much of a coward—”
him. All the time, in fact. If Malfoy wasn’t laughing at him he was probably doing something else to piss Harry off.
“There’s three. One in the Cotswolds near Chedworth, another in the High Weald, and their ancestral home in Wales, though I can’t for the life of me remember where it is. I think we still have records back at the Manor if you need their precise locations. I’d be careful, though, if you’re planning on exploring it. There’s a branch of the family in Wales who won’t be happy if you start poking around. Wouldn’t be surprised if one or two distant cousins are trying to get in before you and are waiting for someone else to spring the lock. They’re practically royalty over there, and very territorial.”
Harry sat forward in his seat, elbows on his hands and staring at the ground between his feet, trying to control his expression. He fought the urge to tap his foot, to work out some of the frenetic anger working its way up from the dark cave he’d tried to make of himself.
Andromeda came back in with another plate, picking up a biscuit and handing it to Harry with a steady, commanding look. Only when he took it and ate a bit off the end did she release him. “I don’t know how long you’ll need him, Gawain, but Harry shouldn’t be up for more than a few more hours. He shouldn’t be up now,” she added, her voice dark.
would think. They’d be angry. Some might think he was betraying the people he’d fought for. They wouldn’t understand, but he didn’t blame them. People were still hurting and they wouldn’t want to hear about this, on top of everything else. He knew a lot of people he didn’t even know would get mad, but he couldn’t do nothing. And honestly? It was fine, if those people would just leave him alone. If the world could move on and stop bothering with him. If he could have a bit of peace and quiet to figure out what the fuck he was supposed to do with his life. The world could hate him for all he cared. Not like it’d make much of a difference.
Four days after Kingsley’s visit, Harry left Shell Cottage, kipping on Ron’s couch in his newly bought and very independent,
Kingsley grunted. “No. And I can’t say I disagree, Bill. Going back to the place where you watched your friends die seems like too much to ask.”
He rooted through the box the agent had left him, realizing the package was actually a bunch of shrunken furniture, to find something to sit on. Picking at random a little red armchair, he released the enchantment and sort of tossed it in front of him, wincing when it made a loud thud on the shabby floors.
Pale skin. A smirk like a slash of light. A long, lean body pressed up against his back, just the impression, close but not close enough. Lips brushing against the shell of his ear, warm breath ghosting over his heated, wet skin. A low, familiar voice nearly making him whine, a face to match made entirely of angles and shadows, staring down at him with—
The part which made him want to include Hermione most was Regulus’s abstract and near-incomprehensible musings on the nature of magic and where in the body it was stored. Harry had always assumed it was a blood thing, the underlying justification for pureblood supremacy. But there seemed to be something else, something Regulus wouldn’t move on from—only here Regulus lapsed into German, his notes presumably mirroring the text he’d slotted in with all the others, and Harry could only guess at what conclusion he’d come to. In the same vein there was a book all in French sporting some truly terrible drawings of what he could only assume were meant to be outcomes of spells, or more likely, curses. Regulus had mapped a few out in his notes, but they were all labeled in French and though Harry knew a bit thanks to Fleur, he couldn’t make much sense of them. Whoever Madame Chastel, the author of the spell book, was, she’d clearly been a sadist.
“Right,” he laughed, “because why else would you ask me down here if the court had no interest in what I had to say? Believe me, I’d prefer if all of you pissed off and left me the bloody hell alone, but you’re not going to do that, are you? You care what I think, so I’m going to give you my unvarnished opinion. To do otherwise would be tantamount to lying, and I shouldn’t tell lies, should I? I thought you people frowned on that sort of thing.”
Regulus abandoned this line of thought when he circled back to the physical creation of a horcrux. Essentially, it seemed to be the same process a person might go through to ensure their ability to become a ghost, with a more sadistic and cruel bent in the form of blood and other dark substances being consumed to ensure the soul was at its weakest before you attempted to slice a piece off. You had to prepare your body for the soul’s departure, to be able to catch it with the horcrux, somehow, and hold it before it went…somewhere else. Beyond, presumably.
The auror looked back and forth between him and Malfoy. “It’s not. But he’s—he’s not supposed to be here.”
Harry swallowed and looked over Bill’s shoulder. Bill followed his gaze, his whole body tensing when he saw Goyle’s unmoving body.
“I meant—I have nothing to do and I can’t leave for a few days. Is there anything I can, I don’t know, organize? I don’t want to clean anything out or throw it away,” he added when Kreacher’s face twitched, “I swear. I just need something to keep me busy. I can polish dishes, if you like.” He softened his voice, bending down to pat Kreacher on the shoulder. “I just want to help. That’s all.”
Harry’s throat burned, and he was unable to stop the small motions of his hips as he chased that feeling, that cold, clawing hand pressing ever more firmly against his lower back, caging him in place. He wanted to.
frowning when it came out every bit as bright as it normally did. The feeling lingered, but as he went through a few more easy spells, levitating a book from the table, cleaning a bit of dust from the shelf in the corner, there was nothing wrong with the magic. Had the strain of the spell pushed it too far? The Fidelius Charm was powerful, even if it hadn’t been particularly difficult to cast. And after the magic he’d conjured to kill Goyle…
Eventually the sounds of the house grew a bit more intentional. Light was coming in from the drapes. Nearly dawn, then. As if summoned by the thought, a few cracks of people apparating sounded outside the house, followed by low, murmured voices.
anything to him besides give him a general sense of malign interest. It was watching him, and it went beyond the strange chills he sometimes felt walking through barely-used rooms or past cabinets filled with old Black family treasures. This wasn’t the house. The house still seemed to like him, or tolerate him, but there was something else with him now. Kreacher had been no help either, still confused and unwell. Harry had told him to stop working so he could rest, and, perhaps most alarming of all, he’d listened, and not simply because he was compelled to do so.
“It’s strange, actually,” she continued over his moment of panic, “because the kettlefoxes usually don’t chance coming out when it’s so near the new moon. Don’t like to be caught out when the Wild Hunt gets going. They’re generally much more careful, but it’s been such a queer summer. Would you believe I counted fifteen hinkypunks in July alone? Normally I’d be lucky to see one all year! I didn’t even have to go out to the river. They just floated up the hill, bold as you please.”
“There’s nothing to apologize for,” Harry laughed. “You just…you gave me a bit of a scare, that’s all. You feeling okay?”
What really gnawed at him was the fact that he wasn’t more upset about it. He missed the life he’d imagined for them over the year he spent on the run, the fantasy of a happy ending after he did what he was supposed to do. The one where they’d have kids and settle down and live the life his parents never had and he’d finally be normal.
He glanced from Kingsley to Robards. “If the investigation is over, I’d… Well, I think it might help if I knew something. I guess.”
She tucked her long red hair behind her ears—and he didn’t want to immediately run his fingers through it, which was a stupid thing to get caught up on but he used to love her hair—giving him a rueful smile. “But I don’t want you to force yourself to be with me if you don’t— That wouldn’t be fair. To either of us. So. It’s all right. Really.”
so badly. Long fingers sank into his hair as he was turned, guided. Harry couldn’t breathe. His heart was beating so fast he felt like he was flying.
is your new best friend now, which is just… I’m trying to understand, mate, I really am, but I don’t fucking get it.”
He looked away when Bill, frowning, caught his eye. He’d—mention it later. To Bill. If no one else had seen it, he might be imagining it. He’d slept maybe three hours a night the past two weeks. He’d just killed someone, had a breakdown that afternoon.
Anyway. I know I have a toooon of comments to respond to, and I will try to catch up here in the next few days. I do read them, even if it takes me months to respond sometimes. Your incredibly kind response to this story has made me find the time and energy to keep working on it, and I am so grateful. Y'all are kind as fuck, and I Appreciate You.
Harry held his gaze, heard the shift in Malfoy’s tone. He knew what Malfoy meant and he was still unable to come up with any reason that didn’t make him want to scream until his throat was bloody.
“Yeah, there are—er,” Harry hesitated, feeling acutely the eyes of both Robards and Kingsley on him, “so muggles sometimes put small figurines at the front of their car that sort of—wiggle, when they drive. It’s kind of a joke, I think.”
He didn’t know why he did what he did next. Maybe he just hated bullies, even if they bullied someone who had once been determined to treat him like dirt every time they saw each other and who had on more than one occasion actually threatened his life.
Harry smiled grimly at the confusion in Malfoy’s eyes. He tossed the wand onto the ground at Malfoy’s feet. His mother tensed again but Malfoy didn’t flinch this time.
Harry watched in horror as another hand swam into his vision, pale, bony fingers clutching a thick black wand. It flicked and the woman on the ground screamed, writhed, and he knew it would keep going and going until she finally gave up and—
was practically a death sentence for anyone who couldn’t remove their own bloody leg before the curse took hold of their heart and made it stop pumping blood. Hard to breathe when your lungs froze and your brain up and turned off.
“Everything’s gonna be all right.” Bill murmured, squeezing, rubbing a comforting hand down his back. “Promise, Harry.”
care? He’d hated Slytherins just as much as Ron and Hermione. He’d thought they were vile, cruel, racist pieces of shit. Malfoy more so than anyone else.
Hermione’s mouth was shut tight, her chin quivering as she stared at him, chest heaving, eyes wide. Like she was afraid of him.
His mind was a flashfire and he didn’t know how any of him was still burning because he couldn’t remember not feeling like this. He’d been burning like this since the day Voldemort had turned his crib to kindling. Since the day green fire burnished him with death.
“I was just surprised, that’s all,” Harry muttered after a moment. “Never thought you’d do anything to go against your family.”
Craning his neck, he fumbled around for his wand only to have it light up on the other side of the room. He was still in the cellar, then. Which made sense, as this was where he collapsed when the ritual had been completed.
Andromeda held his gaze for a moment longer, and Harry saw with a stab of pain that was entirely emotional that her dark eyes were also shiny with tears.
Grimmauld Place might be lonely and quiet, but it was safe. Or, as safe as Harry was ever going to get. Leaving would mean reentering the world where he’d alienated and hurt his friends and insulted an entire government, reentering the world where he was a killer, twice over. Where he still didn’t know what he was going to do or what he wanted. Once he stepped into the fire he would be confronted with the fact that he didn’t know who he was supposed to be anymore. That he had no bloody idea where to even begin.
“But that was a show, obviously,” Ron said slowly, like he was waiting for Harry to agree with him. “That was all to make it seem like he wasn’t with the other death eaters when the dust finally settled.”
He looked from Robards to Kamau, who was also taking notes, though she was looking down. Proulx was still scowling at Harry but there was a glint of interest now in his eyes which put Harry off. “I do. A lot of it was—personal, but… Professor Dumbledore was talking Draco down. He was—” He didn’t know why this was harder to say now than any other time, but for some reason he couldn’t get Malfoy’s pale face and crumpled expression out of his head. “He offered Draco clemency, him and his parents. The Order of the Phoenix would have taken them in and protected them. If Draco surrendered.”
Harry had made sure not to mention Malfoy, or even allude to him, and Lovegood hadn’t included his name, or any names, in the piece. He knew it was likely Malfoy’d be angry at him, but he didn’t care. Harry hadn’t done it because of him. Not entirely, anyway.
He went back when he knew his absence would be noticed. Sure enough, Molly pulled him into a tear-filled hug, berating him for wandering off on his own and praising him for saving everyone at the same time. Her grief was painful, like being dunked back into a cold pool. And the whole process started up again. Everyone wanted to touch him, to thank him, to tell him the names of their dead like confessing to a priest. Endless gratitude. Endless grief. The Weasley family enveloped him as they sat together and bore the shared weight of their loss.
It took him a moment to find his voice. Bill was being genuine, he knew, but he couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed. Maybe it was just the conversation he had overheard between him and Kingsley but Harry had to fight the urge to frown.
“I know.” Bill grasped his shoulders, expression twisting, voice almost breaking. “I know, Harry. I… It will be okay. You’re going to be okay. But I have to go now. I can’t risk someone else stumbling across the—body. I’ll be back before morning, and we’ll figure this out. I swear. I’m not letting you do this alone, all right?”
It took a great deal of effort not to laugh out loud at this. “If you say so,” he finally ground out.
Andromeda sighed, face tightening up before she stood. “I’m going to rewrap your hand. Everything seems fine, but I’d rather be safe.” She left him and Bill alone, the tension in her shoulders clearly visible.
Harry felt arguments swelling thick and hard in his throat. Bill was wrong. It mattered what he did, because he was no different than the kids they’d locked up for defending themselves, than the kids who wore reminders of their parents’ prejudices on their ankles. And they hadn’t even
It took him the better part of three days to get a handle on the greenwood book. The spells inside were largely based around cleansing, refreshing, or renewing. Clearing out anything which prohibited the movement and transfer of magic. He got caught on the idea that he could somehow heal his soul, if that was possible, but the book seemed largely focused on removing things which stopped something from working properly, something physical which had manifested and gummed up the works. For all intents and purposes, Harry was working fine, and he didn’t trust he’d be able to work any spell so complex as
It seemed for a moment as if Malfoy wasn’t going to let him move the conversation, but then he sighed. “And bring down more trouble on my head? No, thank you.”
The ever-burning lamp cast a pale, flickering blue light over the pages. As if he were underwater, far, far beneath the surface of a dark lake. And there were dead here, too, just like those who still waited in the cavern where Regulus had met his end. There were specters in the books all around him, on the pages in front of him. Memories of people who were long gone, whose names were forgotten. But he wasn’t home here among them. He was something else. Something that shouldn’t exist.
Maybe he’d never get the chance. He had to leave this house eventually, and if there’d been two people out there who still wanted him dead, who knew how many more were waiting?
Harry stared at Kingsley, the world around him growing sharp and cutting. His mind was quiet like the moment before a storm broke. He smelled rust and fire—the disdain sitting like petrichor on his tongue. It would kill him, would it?
“We didn’t go through the same war,” he continued, carving his words into daggers. “You didn’t go through what I went through. You haven’t dealt with what I’ve dealt with. You have no
Suddenly fearful, Harry got quickly to his feet and went to Sirius’s room. The door looked freshly polished and for a moment Harry didn’t want to open it, he didn’t want to see the room with bare walls and clean carpets and windows which let in light. He wanted it to be exactly the same. Even if it hurt, he wanted…
He considered going up to the headmaster’s office as well, looking into those wonderful, horrible blue eyes and seeking an answer as to why Dumbledore hadn’t told him. Why he thought Harry wouldn’t have agreed, if he’d known beforehand. Because he would have. Of course he would have. To save his friends, his family, the whole bleeding Wizarding World? He would have thrown himself on any sword to save them all. Gladly, and without thought. He still would.
It was easier to affect the state of something if that thing was rid of anything else which might interfere with it. The difference between mopping a floor with all the furniture in its usual place, and a floor with everything moved out of the room.
“Right,” Madam Yeats called out, breaking the tension in the air only to summon a different kind in its wake. “I believe the Wizengamot is satisfied.”

Taking a deep breath, he turned back to Kingsley. He waited, watching the Minister for Magic, a man he’d once thought to be impenetrable and unwavering walk up to him—and Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more separating them now than just space. More than sides in a war he seemed destined never to leave.
Harry realized with a sick tightness in his throat that while he had never said so out loud, he’d been planning on going back. In the months since the last battle, the thought had formed without fanfare as he quietly decided he wasn’t ready to go into a career yet. And now that he
off into the world on their own with little more than a vague goal and a fool’s conviction, tasked with the death of a wizard so powerful
Draco’s eyes were wide in horror. They were fixed on Bellatrix’s body. His mouth was open as if he had only now realized what he’d done. The grip on his wand grew slack, hand shaking as it dropped a few inches in the air. He took a step back, seemed to lose his footing.
Somehow, Malfoy’s frown deepened, but he didn’t say anything. No, he just kept staring at Harry—and Harry fought the urge to glower at him and ask what the fuck was so interesting about his face. It wouldn’t help anything and Malfoy would just take it as Harry admitting Malfoy made him uncomfortable, something he vowed right then never to do.
exactly what he was and what that meant. He wanted to be able to defend himself when he next met someone who wanted him dead or hurt.
“It’s difficult, as most of the students at Hogwarts were underage when the Battle of Hogwarts occurred. Underage crimes are handled differently than those committed by wizards who are of age, although in this circumstance, so many of those of age had not yet completed their schooling. It puts us in an uncomfortable position of deciding who to charge with what, and what punishments fit which charges.”
Most of the atrium was staring at them, though a few had the grace to look embarrassed or turn away when Harry noticed them. Of the Slytherin girls who moved as a group toward the lifts, only Millicent lagged, her eyes hard and angry, before she stalked after the others. Between them Harry thought he spotted Zabini as well. Were all of them here today, then?
The dream fractured. Two figures stood in the glow of a lantern, the sky cracking with thunder and a cold, biting wind. The woman on the ground went still. The figure swathed in black let out another laugh. The other one…
“It does, doesn’t it?” She huffed and tipped back the rest of her drink, wincing. “Ugh. I don’t know why you find this enjoyable.”
It occurred to Harry as people started staring that he had no idea where he was supposed to go. Presumably to level nine and the courtrooms but he didn’t know if he needed to check in somewhere, or let someone know he was here—
looking far too alive for someone who had stood at the center of a blast which had broken apart stone and taken out a good chunk of the courtyard, stood on the other side of the small circle which had formed around Bellatrix. He held out his wand with a kind of ruthless challenge, his eyes burning, a trickle of blood running out the side of his mouth and down from his left temple. His grip was steady and sure, and a reckless light burned in his pale eyes now.
Without knowing how the Fidelius Charm had been cast in the first place, along with all the other charms and wards the Black family had layered over the years, he didn’t trust himself to just cast a new charm on the house, mostly because he had no bloody chance of trying any version of the charm developed in the last century. He remembered Flitwick saying it was a tricky bit of magic, and if Flitwick didn’t know what he was talking about then Harry didn’t have a shot in hell anyway. If he could just…get rid of the fragments of magic that no longer worked or gave the house its demeanor of faintly-simmering malice, it might be easier. It might start to feel like something resembling a home.
he repeated, and this time Harry could feel the magic wrapped around the word, the compulsion, “and repent, Draco.”
The effort to move managed to consume all his higher faculties. He focused on getting up, on standing, on holding back the noises he wanted to make when he felt where Goyle had—stabbed him? Harry hadn’t seen a knife, and he hadn’t heard Goyle cast anything else. What the fuck had he done, and how had it happened so fast? How had he been able to overpower Harry so easily? Time flipped forward and back, and he tried to gauge how long it had been since Goyle’d sent the stunning spell. Five minutes? Less, more? He didn’t know how long he’d been on the ground unable to move.
“I was just there for about a month. If they tolerated me, they’d love you. Fleur might steal Teddy once she gets her hands on him, though, so maybe it’s not such a good idea.”
“Remus Lupin?” the woman with glasses asked, leaning forward in her chair. “From the Order of the Phoenix?”
“Felicity is one of the Magical Law Enforcement’s senior hit wizards,” Robards supplied. “She’s here because… Well. I suppose we should get to it.”
“Do you know if this is some kind of illusion, Kreacher?” Harry rubbed the glass, but the fogged, grimy sheen didn’t budge. “Unless—those are trees, aren’t they?”
“Harry?” Luna said, eyes wide and smiled even wider. “Why, hello, Harry! This is a wonderful surprise!”
“You can stay here until I come back and you will.” Bill’s expression broke no leniency. “I mean it, Harry. You have no idea if this is an isolated incident or if this is something bigger, and I’m not going to let you wander off and get yourself hurt. Not again. You’re not leaving this house until I know you’re safe.” He took a deep breath, his voice softened. “I’m going to have to bring the Ministry in,” he added, slowly, watching Harry carefully. “I won’t—”
After three days he felt ready to start experimenting. He began with a rotting plant Kreacher had produced from some corner of the house Harry had never seen. He trusted when Kreacher told him it wasn’t dangerous, that it had been a gift from Walburga to her husband in the final years of their lives. A special kind of flower Kreacher didn’t know the name of, which apparently only grew on the slopes of a mountain in Bulgaria.
“Patrick Van Buren?” a posh, unhurried, immediately familiar voice called from a startlingly short distance away.
Dumbledore, in all his quiet machinations, all his scheming, all his subtle manipulations of people into the web of his grand, silent war, had never counted on Harry coming back a second time.
“A cuff layered with a tracking charm and a dormant curse if I violate the terms of my conditional freedom? Yes.” Malfoy released the material and Harry had to blink a few times once he realized he’d been staring at the strip of pale skin where his sock ended. “It’s a fun new toy the Ministry’s trying out. If I don’t come in once a day, this will clamp down and shoot a
He couldn’t bring this kind of trouble to them as well, ruin their lives because more people wanted Harry dead. They didn’t deserve that. The war was over for them. He wouldn’t pull them back in just because Harry didn’t know how to exist in this post-war world. If he wasn’t allowed to have a normal life, he wasn’t going to take that from them too.
The moth-eaten, moldy curtains were gone. The imposing portrait of Sirius’s mother, a fixture of this house from the moment he’d entered it three years ago, was also gone.
He waited for that voice of reason to reprimand him again, but it was quiet. He felt nothing but anger toward the whole bleeding lot of them. He couldn’t have stood there and not said anything. He would have hated himself if he hadn’t done something. He was right, he knew he was. So what if he’d gone about it in a violent way? Maybe the Wizengamot needed to be shaken out of its simpering superiority. Maybe Yeats had thought she could get away with scaring kids and hadn’t realized they might push back.
“Did they make you reenact stuff or something?” Ron asked, downing his drink. His cheeks were already flushed and there was a glazed look to his gaze. He must have had another when Harry wasn’t paying attention. He’d cut his hair in the week or so since he’d kicked Harry out of his flat and he wore rather nice slacks under his summer robes. Harry felt a little stab of affection when he thought of Ron going shopping for new clothes.
“Ginny’s going for that internship with the Harpies, right?” Charlie asked, grinning. “You can both go be world famous quidditch stars and make the rest of us normal sods feel terrible about ourselves.”
Bill swept his wand over his head, a Notice-Me-Not Charm settling around them. Goyle’s body didn’t disappear, but it wasn’t so obvious now. It might have just been a strange shadow, a log.
It was mad, but Harry could almost feel relief as it drifted toward him. Eagerness. Fatigue. The desperation was still there, but its tone took on one of entreaty and hope, not fear. A sentience presence which had only been an unfocused influence—it now felt like…someone. Someone who had been trapped for a very, very long time. Longer than Harry could comprehend. He glimpsed some of it, the maddening, horrible tightness, the claustrophobic anger of absolute helplessness. The longing for something to change, to end, perhaps, if it was lucky.
you sit there and threaten teenagers because they chose not to risk their own fucking lives! How many of you worked for the Ministry last year?”
It was odd, her looking like a normal person. He’d gotten so used to seeing her dirty and tired and haunted, her hair even more insane and unkempt than Harry’s had gotten, by the end. She was wearing a soft pink jumper and simple khakis and she looked healthy and relatively happy—and Harry didn’t know why that hit him so hard all of a sudden. She looked normal. Tired, but normal. Just like Ron.
Over the next few hours as everyone rested and waited for the relief to come in from outside, he sat with the Weasleys. Not next to Ginny, sandwiched between Molly and George. He hadn’t been able to get her alone—he hadn’t tried, really—but he caught her watching him now and again.
“You don’t mean that,” Hermione said, voice breaking as she took a careful step toward him. “Harry, you don’t—”
“Hey,” Harry said, asking before he could convince himself not to, “you haven’t heard of something called an Anilex Orb, have you?”
“You’ve got quite a reputation back in the States,” she continued, mouth twitching. “I’m looking forward to getting to know the real you.”
“Right. So. You want me to use this bathroom?” he asked, feeling like the world’s biggest prat for thinking his
“You never need to apologize for needing my help. You will always have a place here.” Her hands shook slightly. “You’re a good man, Harry, with a good heart. What happened tonight doesn’t change that. Sometimes, you can’t blame yourself for the evil others do in your presence. Sometimes, the only thing you can do is save yourself, and you should never regret that. The important thing is you’re alive, and you’re going to be all right. You’re safe,” she murmured, almost to herself. She combed his hair back and tucked it behind his ear. “You’re safe, Harry.”
With a gentle twist, the beams of light flashed and sped inward—the secret being drawn together and coalescing into a single point of intention. He sketched a small circle in the air with his wand. Like a key in a lock, the secret clicked into place, and all the pearls winked out.
Robards leveled him with a hard glare. “As you’ve no interest in Ministry protection, I’m not inclined to share details of our investigation until it’s concluded. We’ve handled it.”
The strange thing, though, was that while it’d made its presence known the moment Harry had started going round the house testing for where the foci of the house’s magical energy was located, it hadn’t
Harry felt a hot stab of guilt wash through him as he recognized the fear in Andromeda’s voice. He’d only heard her this sharp once before, and that was the night of his seventeenth birthday, asking after her daughter.
Their fight in the ruins of the Entrance Hall came back to him. Malfoy’s desperate anger, the look on his face when Harry finally broke down and screamed at him. He’d thought about that face more than he’d like to admit over the summer—knowing now as he looked back that Malfoy had just been scared the whole time. Harry hated how it muddied things, knowing. Understanding. Understanding
within ten feet of Malfoy made the languid sludge of his emotions surge back into life. “You worked it out. Bully for you. I don’t care.”
“I’ll get right on that, then.” He eyed Malfoy sideways, noting that he looked no better than he had the last time Harry had seen him. A little too gaunt, a haunted look about the eyes. But he still, to Harry’s immense annoyance, managed to look like he’d walked straight out of an advert in one of Aunt Petunia’s old fashion magazines—handsome in that ‘don’t touch me, I’m better than you’ way. It didn’t help that his suit was frustratingly sleek and his white-blonde hair was styled to within an inch of its life. Also, he wasn’t covered in plaster dust and blood this time, so that was an improvement.
People visited, of course, and they went in to London more than once to see the shop and impose on Ron and George, and then Angelina when she and George started dating. While Bill commuted to the Ministry every day, Harry worked on the house with Fleur. He started to suspect she was running out of things for him to do around the third week of his stay, setting him to work on retiling the roof even though it was perfectly fine. There were only so many times he could rearrange the rock garden before it become excessive. But he didn’t mind. Fleur was lovely company, smart and sweet with a ruthless streak to her which always reminded Harry how well she had done in the Triwizard Tournament. It definitely explained why Bill had fallen for her so hard. She even started teaching him French and let him cook—something at which he’d always been good but never particularly interested, given he was forced as a child and frequently barred from eating the food he had prepared. Bill treated him like a younger brother, not like a kid. It was nice. Or, if not nice, then it wasn’t hard, not like it had been at the Burrow.
After, he sat listening to the sounds of the wind drift through the ruined tower. A soft flap of wings greeted him, and Harry didn’t lift his head. He didn’t need to. Fawkes lighted down next to him, gently resting his beak on the same arm he had healed in the Chamber of Secrets. A few more tears slipped down Harry’s cheeks. Fawkes blinked his ancient, gleaming eyes at him, lifted his beak and touched one of Harry’s tears before it could slide off his chin.
Malfoy’s head tilted and a flicker of his old cruel amusement lit in his eyes. “No,” he drawled, “of course not. Can’t have anyone else stealing a bit of the glory, can you? It’s the Chosen
It was almost anticlimactic. The house looked the same as it had before. It felt no different either, and he wondered if maybe he’d already done the hard work by ridding the house of whatever that darkness had been with the blood ritual. He mentally poked at the secret. It certainly seemed to have worked. The secret felt hidden, the wholeness of it a weird sensation he couldn’t really explain, but knew on some level deeper than expression.
“Hey, it’s all right,” Harry said, startled when the house-elf began to sob in earnest. “Of course, Kreacher. It’s…my pleasure,” he added with a wince. He had no desire to honor the memory of that old hag, but he was starting to understand Kreacher’s devotion to her. He was with her long after everyone else had left, and he’d been here alone until Sirius showed up. He was bound to get attached.
to save his parents, because Voldemort knew exactly how to ensure their loyalty, by using him as a deterrent to keep his parents in line. You have no
He leaned back, hands trembling slightly as he pushed his hair off his forehead and held it. He’d just…done something, clearly, some kind of magic so innate he hadn’t even realized he was doing it. He bent over to grab Regulus’s notes, hoping he’d missed the details of that other book, the one with the darker, striated wood.
The Room of Requirement was filled with flames, shrieking and spitting and howling—fiendfyre. Except it wasn’t Crabbe who’d set it loose this time. The grey and white figures—witches and wizards and horses and dragons—all of them screaming their horror, belonged to Harry.
He was out before the sun rose, waking a very disgruntled Ron the morning Hermione was due back to ask how he’d bought his flat. Before lunch he took the first place the agent showed him—a small two-bedroom on the top floor of a wizards-only building one street over from St. Andrew’s Gardens. Flustered and still doing a poor job of not ogling Harry’s scar, the agent asked if he wanted to purchase something called the All-Inclusive Furnishings Package. Harry was barely listening, so he just nodded and agreed, anything to hurry the whole business along so he didn’t think too hard about the fact that he was
He was a chaser on the Slytherin team when Harry was in sixth year. He was young but he was good. Harry remembered thinking he would turn into a great player one day, despite his natural aversion to anyone who came from Slytherin. Harry tried to construct an image of the kid but he couldn’t remember anything other than a head of black hair and the lanky limbs of a boy coming off his first growth spurt.
Hermione sighed heavily. “I told him I was thinking about taking some time to visit family this fall. As you can imagine, he’s taking it poorly.”
The ground shifted as an explosion rocked the castle. He fell back, reaching out—and something grabbed his hand.
Harry noticed at once that these were much better cared for. Their leather bindings were tight and clean, the small details of metal gleaming in the light from the gas lamp. The pages were crisp and flat, and each one seemed placed delicately, purposefully, one on top of the other, ascending in size from largest to smallest until a black notebook bound with a length of red velvet rested atop the rest.
Madam Yeats was not looking at him, shuffling parchment on her desk and reaching for a gavel which sat on a black stone stand in the center of the bench. “That will be unnecessary. The Wizengamot is more than aware of your opinion in this matter, Mr. Potter. As is, I’m sure, a good portion of this building.”
all of which confirmed the connection between soul and body, how a wizard must ensure a strong harmony between his mental, emotional, and physical self before attempting to fight with his magic. How mastery over one’s physical self ensured mastery over one’s opponent.
He didn’t know why them wanting to make him feel better was a bad thing. Maybe he wished it wasn’t necessary in the first place.
Harry’s throat closed and his eyes went wide in panic. He hadn’t heard that voice in months. He wasn’t supposed to hear it anymore, its owner was dead,
Before he could so much as open his mouth to ask Kreacher for help, though, the air around him shifted, warped and popped slightly. The ground rotated to the side, like the house was tipping him out of a tea cup. Before he could get seriously alarmed, though, the ground righted itself and his arse hit something soft. He looked up and frowned, blinked—and he was in his room, three floors up from the cellar, sitting on his bed.
Yeats was speaking and voices were raising around the room. From the corners of his eyes he saw figures gathering, darkness coalescing, but he didn’t care. If they wanted to arrest him, they could bloody well try. He’d welcome it, if only to break the feeling caging him in place, to shake him out of his furious paralysis. The pounding in his head rose and he felt his wand give off sparks where it was sitting on his hip and he wanted to blow this entire fucking building apart. He wanted to smash all of these sycophantic adults like Dumbledore’s glittering instruments and glass cabinets. He wanted to take all of them by the collars of their robes and shake them until they saw what they were doing. Until they fucking
“Of course not,” Tom murmured, so close now Harry could almost feel the sleek line of him against his own body.
A coughed laugh made his chest ache. His eyes watered as he wheezed—the whole thing was suddenly, absurdly hilarious. Bloody fucking stupid, and
Harry closed the box and picked it up, carrying it with him as he made his way back through the labyrinthine paths to Regulus’s desk. Harry had put the books he hadn’t been able to read on the floor next to his chair, and as he approached and sat down, he found what he was looking for.
He couldn’t walk around outside anymore—too many people were recognizing him now. His second day out, crossing through Piccadilly Square, a wizard had actually grabbed and stopped him and attempted to regale Harry about his own monumental efforts to stop the war. Harry had needed to shove him off or get hit by a muggle bus. He had even spotted someone who might have been hiding in the bushes outside his building. It had been fine when he was out with other people. Potential gawkers tended to leave him alone when he was with friends but for some reason every bloody witch and wizard in London seemed to want his autograph or their hand shaken or to tell him about someone they had lost in the war. After the first few days, the photographers had started showing up and stalking him and Harry had had quite enough of being photographed to last a lifetime. Whatever that meant when it came to him.
His vision tunneled. The sensations of his body dimmed as, with every shaking breath, Goyle remained perfectly, horribly, still.
he told himself out loud, resuming his pacing, toweling his head off in an attempt to shake the thought from his mind along with the rest of the water from his hair.
He was staring at himself, only it wasn’t him—the eyes were too large and the antlers… He had antlers sitting atop his head. A massive rack of antlers, too large, much too large for any animal to carry. As he watched, paralyzed, his mirror image smiled. Its mouth split wide, too wide. His whole head was separating. The inside of his mouth was a tunnel of dripping black ichor. His eyes burned green, the sickening, lightning green of death and sure enough the whistling sound of a scream cut through him—not his mum’s voice. It was someone else screaming.
“What can you tell me about Draco Malfoy and his involvement with the Dark Lord or any of his followers?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, tone flat, “but I have no idea who you’re talking about. I’m sure he’s very nice, but I—”
wanted the same. Back when he saw her in the Room of Requirement it was all he could do not to bury himself in her hair and breath her warmth and life in but now he… He didn’t know what he felt. His emotions kept stalling, getting waylaid and shuffled as his brain processed the events of the last twenty-four hours.
His wand. He needed his wand. But all he had was a handful of flowers that began to crack and age in his hands. The petals grew black and withered, the stalks going limp. They were dying, the forest was dying. A cold wind cut through him like a knife and he braced himself against a hollow numbness crawling up his legs.
“Don’t apologize about swearing in front of me,” she said with a small smile, wiping the residual blood from his palm. “I’d prefer if you didn’t do it in front of Teddy, at least until he’s older.”
He didn’t know why it was such a surprise, why it rocked him to the core. So many people had wanted him dead over the years, had tried, and nearly succeeded. Shouldn’t he be used to this by now?
Bill cursed under his breath. Through the window Harry could see him run a hand through his hair, shorter now than it used to be but still long enough to make Molly’s eye twitch every time she looked at him. “Fifteen. Bloody hell.”
Harry still wasn’t sure he could reply without losing it entirely, so he just gave her a grateful smile. Teddy began reaching up for Harry’s hair, babbling incoherently as he took great chunks and tugged. He did manage a bit of a hug while doing it though, so Harry didn’t mind. He felt more fragile than the last time Harry’d held him, or maybe it was Harry who was shaky and nervous. Teddy was all chubby arms and a weirdly soft, simple smell and Harry was grateful and guilty for the relief he felt knowing the boy still liked him.
He was a bit lonely, sure, but every time he thought about Ginny these days, it was just a small sadness. Followed by a healthy amount of self-loathing, but still, only a bit sad. He missed her, but only because she was brilliant and he liked spending time with her.
“Well. I’ve got to be going. I’m sure I’ll see you again this week, and if you need anything, Harry, don’t hesitate to ask.”
Harry’s whole body went cold. Ravenna Lamar. He had heard that name before…and fourteen? She must have been a student at Hogwarts but he couldn’t…
He considered more than once just putting the invisibility cloak on but it seemed like some kind of surrender, so he just stopped going out.
“This isn’t a topic for a pub,” Bill said quietly. “Let’s just—get out of here and we can talk about it, okay?”
Harry stared up at Madam Yeats, wondering if he’d only imagined her emphasis on their supposed transparency. He’d been listening closely to everything she’d said today, trying to match this rather even-keeled woman with the person who’d decided it was a good idea frighten children so their parents would fall in line.
It looked a bit like the strange view he’d seen out of the greenhouse windows back in Grimmauld Place. The vista now sitting in the entry hall where Walburga Black had once terrorized intruders.
Crippled by a wave of fatigue, he sank onto the floor and let his limbs all fall to the side. The wood was cool and grounding, the smell of it resinous and sweet, like the first green of growing things in spring. He traced the lines in the ceiling to drown out the deadening thoughts pulling him back under.
Right. Kids should be with their families, shouldn’t they? They should be with the people they love and who love them.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and caught his breath. “Yeah. I think, I mean… I’m not sure, mind, but I think it’s healed. Looks healed.”
Kreacher rocked back and forth on his little bony feet, the movement so reminiscent of Dobby it made Harry’s chest hurt. He hummed in consideration, one hand reaching up to clutch at the fake locket Regulus Black had swapped for the horcrux while the other patted his eyes dry with the corner of his clean pillow case. “Master is wanting to organize?”
The moment he said it, he realized it was true. Malfoy had interrupted her, and then he had proceeded to insult her until she left. He’d been an ass about it later, but he’d clearly done it for some reason. He could have just let the old woman prattle on for a few minutes and watched Harry suffer through another tedious conversation.
“Returning to Draco Malfoy,” Robards said, his voice flat, “you say he was tasked to kill Albus Dumbledore. Do you know why?”
A kitchen materialized as the flames retreated. A kitchen he’d only seen a bit of, the only time he’d been there. From what he could see now, the house had been rebuilt, mostly. There was a conspicuous absence in the center of the round room, but then a green tartan dress with what looked like bananas stitched onto the skirts appeared, and Harry smiled.
“Sure, but as far as I know he never stabbed people. It was more just—bullying, really. Might have started in seventh year. I told you what I heard from other kids who attended last year. I’ve never seen him that—unhinged before.”
Bill’s expression remained hard, his blue eyes disconcertingly similar to Ron’s in their frustration.
“It doesn’t?” he found himself whispering, the space between them shrinking. He felt edgy, nervous—like he was about to jump out of his own skin. Like he needed something to hold onto him.
His voice echoed through the tall, rounded ceiling. He wouldn’t be surprised if people on the atrium had heard him. He pierced Kingsley with as much anger he could summon, enough grief and pain and disbelief, because he’d maneuvered Harry into this.
“One man lost his right foot, and an old woman a few fingers, but otherwise, none of the tenants were seriously wounded. Before I left I heard one man complaining about losing a chunk of his hair. The dark witch, however, lost her wand arm and a good portion of her face. Not badly enough to kill her, but she’s in a secured room at St. Mungo’s right now. The healers say she’ll live, though I’m not sure what’s going to be done with her. The small failsafe is designed to consume the caster should they try to reverse the spell. Frankly, she shouldn’t be alive. I’m inclined to think the spell was improperly cast, if she could do anything to it at all.”
Harry could actually hear Dumbledore’s voice in his ear, that soft, patient voice, a voice Harry had clung to for so long because it was the only thing he had, the only thing he could trust.
“You know what, Hermione, I didn’t get it before, but you’re right. Kids like that are very dangerous. Now I
He thought about going to Ron and Hermione. He wanted to. To explain everything he had seen in the pensieve, how Snape had loved his mother and that was why he’d betrayed Voldemort. How Dumbledore had known all along that he was a horcrux. To fill in the gaps they deserved after the last year, the last seven years, really.
“Should have gotten to me sooner,” Harry said, any guilt he might have felt for being an arse evaporating at her faux outrage. “Eight people ago and I probably would have let you take a picture.”
Bill nodded after a second, confused. “Sure thing.” As he came over, Charlie shot Harry a curious glance, but he stayed where he was.
When it was done and they were lying next to each other in the silence, he waited, desperately wishing that that feeling would click into place. For him to know, finally, that he wanted this, that he wanted her, because he would be mad not to, right? After everything, to come out of the war with nothing…
He spat the last. “You and I both know Hermione doesn’t lose it like that unless you lost your mind at her, unless you
But no—the boy standing outside the lift wasn’t sneering, he wasn’t laughing. He was looking at Harry like it hurt. His eyes were wide and almost silver in the sunlight streaming in from one of the overhead windows. Brow furrowed, jaw clenched, leaning forward on the balls of his feet—he looked like he was about to reach out and stop the lift before it could descend.
Robards would have to announce Goyle’s death at some point. He might be keeping it quiet to protect Harry and uphold the facade of order the Ministry had achieved during the trials, but he wouldn’t cover it up, not for long.
“Apparently not. I haven’t told him.” He looked away from her intensely concerned expression. “I didn’t want to make things weird. We haven’t exactly spent a lot of time together this summer, and he’s been busy with George and the store. I didn’t…want to give him anything to get worked up over. He’s so happy,” he finished lamely, knowing it was a shit excuse.
Now, however, with the deadened feeling of a person having just awoken from a century of sleep, he could see things quite clearly. Specifically, the silver, branching scar on the palm of his right hand. It followed the lines on his palm. He tried to remember something from their section in Divination about palm reading, but either he was still out of it or his brain had decided to throw it out in the intervening years. Probably around the same time Trelawny had pronounced his life line was broken or something and he was in imminent danger of being squashed by a falling piano.
Learning what he was, what he had always been, killing Voldemort—he’d lost the path. Or maybe the path had lost him.
Harry just stared at him. The image of Malfoy Manor was burned into his psyche—the dark, shadowed hall, stretching out farther than he could even see until it was swallowed by a thick, cloying darkness, the sound of screaming somewhere beneath his feet, a smell rank and sharp that seeped up through the wooden floors. And when the screaming stopped, overwhelming, suffocating silence. He’d been in the house for less than an hour, and it still disturbed him.
He pressed his fingers to his scar, to the slight ridge of hard skin where the lightning bolt crossed his forehead, but it didn’t hurt. He kept very still for a full minute, counting the seconds, waiting for his mind to be dragged back into Voldemort’s head. But it was just him. Standing in the ruins of the Astronomy Tower. Alone.
Ginny seemed determined to ignore this, though, and when she led him into her room, pushed him down on her bed, and told Harry she wanted him to make love to her—Harry couldn’t imagine saying no, even if the rational part of his mind knew that was impossible, because to make love you needed to feel it first, presumably. He was supposed to want this. He was
Robards leaned forward, his bulk somehow looking bigger across the table. “We’ll start with your fellow students, if that’s all right, Potter.”
“Right. Sure.” Harry stopped himself from loosening his tie when an old witch with violently red hair actually walked backwards to gawp at him. “Don’t I get to know who’s questioning me?”
“My flat,” Harry said raggedly, voice small. “I had a flat in the building. I just bought it. Before the trials started.” He shook his head, chest constricting. “I hadn’t even told anyone yet. I didn’t think…”
The banging grew more urgent and Harry forced himself to hobble out of the attic and down to the house proper. As the banging grew louder, he wondered if the house had changed its mind about him, its good will toward him finally run out and it was attempting to collapse the whole thing on top of him.
Sorry for getting this one up later than I planned! Please take this long-ass chapter as my apologies. Also, Draco's in this one! I swear one day there'll be more than just actual tension between them.
Bill, unflappable as always, pulled Harry in for a one-armed hug and walked him down toward the lifts. “So, you’ve got all informal interviews today. Not sure who exactly you’re being asked about, but I think they’re trying to spread the questionings out, to cover as much ground as they can before they decide on the formal charges. Which is probably why they want you here every day this week.”
“Sweet Morgana,” Malfoy said slowly, “is it not exhausting to be so morally superior all the time? That halo of yours must be rather tiresome.”
The bandages had come off yesterday when Bill pronounced him functionally fine. He’d come straight from Andromeda, apparently, who had given him the all clear after one more course of Skele-Gro. Bill had, mercifully, left soon after, sensing Harry’s need to spend the next year unconscious in an attempt to make up for all the sleep he’d lost, but only once Bill had agreed to leave him alone until the investigation was through. He wasn’t going to have Bill or Andromeda stopping by when there was still a chance someone would come looking for him. Maybe Harry just looked that crazed, but Bill had relented. He told Harry to try to get some sleep. By the time Harry finally threw himself into the bed on the far side of the room he’d shared with Ron during fifth year, made up in clean sheets he was pretty sure he’d had no hand in preparing, he was starting to go well and truly mad.
Harry said nothing, warring with himself. Of course he understood. Ron would want to be with his brother. That only made sense.
Her expression slipped into her normal exasperation at him not knowing something he should have. “In History of Magic, of course. Grindlewald used one in the Battle Under Paris only a few months before Dumbledore defeated him.”
days. If you wanted to sulk in here by yourself, that’s fine, but you don’t get to ignore me and Hermione just because you’re
He’d heard Hermione talk about spell interference and residual magic traces sometimes making charms or enchantments act strangely, but he’d never really seen it work in practice. This was very advanced stuff, not something he would have learned in the classes he took at Hogwarts. The closest thing he could think of was Potions and the possible adverse reactions some concoctions and ingredients had to others. You shouldn’t take a Pepper-Up Potion right after a Calming Draught, for instance.
that if he would have asked Ron, Ron would have showed up. Hermione too. If Harry had asked, they both would have been there for him.
It was a receipt. On one side was a small list of things purchased from a gas station. Crisps, gum, a pack of cigarettes. On the other side were two lines of text. The first was big and blocky, rough, the pencil having ripped through the thin paper.
He swallowed down the tight knot in his throat, blinking against the wind, the warmth building behind his eyes.
Malfoy said nothing as he dodged and deflected, his wand moving fast and his mouth fixed in a firm, angry line. He was
His heart was beating hard—he felt like he was hurtling forward, thrown toward a barrier he knew was coming but couldn’t see.
Andromeda looked skeptical but she was saved the bother of responding by said toddler announcing he was awake by making a noise that lived somewhere between an owl hooting and a honking goose.
“I know you… I understand. You don’t have to apologize for not…” She sat up, pulling her clothes on to hide her face. When she finally stood and looked at him, her face was set and she looked almost defiant as she met his gaze. She looked older and more confident and he wondered then if maybe that was the trick, maybe he was stuck thinking of her as younger and softer…
Well, at least Harry wasn’t too far from the mark. Yeats and the others probably just wanted him in to say they asked for his opinion. He wouldn’t be surprised if he was asked to pose for a photo with them when this was all over. They’d slap his face on the front of the Daily Prophet to lay it on thick, let all of Wizarding Britain know Harry Potter approved of their methods.
Harry gave his new plant another wary look. It seemed perfectly content to remain here, snuggled up in its pot like it was a dog in a blanket. His hands were oddly tight and itchy, the remnants of the magic he’d used to cleanse the plant lingering in the lines of his palm and under his nails.
It was about this thought that Harry realized he wasn’t going to be much of a laugh the rest of the night.
“This isn’t the Burrow or Shell Cottage, Bill,” Harry said, voice stronger than it had been in hours. “Anyone could find me here right now if they wanted to, if they were really serious about it. I’m not staying here with my godson in the next room. Not when people are—are destroying
Harry ran his thumb over a slight groove at the head of the hawthorn wand, the edges smoothed down like someone had a habit of performing the same worried gesture over and over again. It wasn’t quite right, though, because Malfoy was left handed.
No reason beyond the curdled shame in his stomach and the hard knot of fear which had taken root that blood-soaked morning he’d chosen not to tell them the truth about the horcruxes. Layered one on top of the other, they doubled and expanded—his heart started to pound fast against his sternum the longer he stared into the flickering green flames.
The pressure on his throat vanished. Goyle’s body was no longer weighing him down. He breathed, panic and air filling his lungs as he coughed violently, blood coating his lips. His head swam and stuttered as he tried to sit up. It hurt. It hurt so badly he nearly blacked out. He turned, shaking, as his hip pulsed in protest.
And then he stopped wondering, because he was on his own now—truly alone. No one would hold his hand through this.
Kingsley rose to his feet, drawing Harry’s gaze. He was having a hard time breathing. He was slipping, his mind warping at the edges as flashes and sparks swarmed around him, explosions and jets of green light, a wall of orange fire—
Hermione said nothing, eyes hard. Her brow furrowed and he could see how much she wanted to scream at him. He knew exactly how angry she was, and he hated knowing he was the cause of it, but he couldn’t do nothing because he didn’t want her or Ron to be mad or because he was worried what other people would think. She shoved a curl which had come free from her bun behind her ear, rolled her shoulders back to launch into another argument. Harry braced himself.
Malfoy was on his mind. That was all. Harry had just killed one of his best friends. Of course Harry was thinking about him.
It made him sick, knowing that. It reminded him of Tom Riddle and his superiority. He didn’t want to be different. He wanted people to stop trying to make him so fucking special.
Britain has to offer, and it all came down to a handful of kids and their teachers hundreds of miles north of here.”
Harry had to take a break that night, turning up the wireless as loud as it could go and pacing in an attempt to get Malfoy’s pale, shaking reflection out of his head.
A book with a wooden front plate, into which was carved the symbol from the outside of the box, followed by a few lines of runic script.
startled him. He blinked as he was jerked out of his head, realizing with discomfort that he had been staring too hard again. His eyes were burning. His neck ached and his entire spine throbbed as he lifted his head. The fingers of his left hand were stiff and frozen, the bones cracked a bit when he tried to stretch them.
They weren’t as vivid or frightening as they used to be. Voldemort didn’t feature in them, not specifically, and he never woke up with his scar burning or to the sound of his mother screaming or a wall of green light. He never remembered the details, only the sense that something was watching him, or present. Something he couldn’t see. His own brain waiting for him to crack, most likely. Inventing danger. Seeing people who were dead. For good this time. He was visiting a strange liminal space in his mind every night and every morning he woke to a lingering sense of dread. Like he was leaving more and more of himself every time he fell into his dreams. It got harder to shake himself out of it, harder to get out of his own head, without Ron and Hermione to distract him, to help him.
A puff of smoke cracked the air a foot in front of him. Harry jerked back, nearly sloshing his coffee all over his pants, only to watch a slightly-charred piece of parchment float down to the bed. He eyed it warily, the whole effect reminding him of his own name bursting out of the Goblet of Fire.
The room filled with another charged silence. Harry thought Robards was fighting the urge to say something else, but it was hard to read that stony face.
Stripped of everything except the wand in his hand and the fire in his chest—he was no longer the boy who would have taken the path of mercy, who would have held out his hand in one final offering and trusted in his own goodness to win out in the end.
Harry waved his wand at the light on the wall, lighting up the hallway so they weren’t just talking in the dark.
The fresh night air greeted him, smelling of trees and leaves and the faint metallic hint of the city surrounding him. He took a few deep breaths before throwing a Silencing Charm around him, crouching down, and screaming into his hands.
“How many times has he decided to cut me out because he’s pissed off and can’t be arsed to listen? How many times has he done that to you?”
Harry stood there for thirty seconds before he sat down hard. The weight of his body seemed to weld him to the wood beneath his legs and feet. He waited to get the urge to call Ron back, to apologize, to fix this while he still could. But it didn’t come. Maybe some of that had been true, then. Maybe he really did want to be alone.
A surge of self-loathing ripped through him, anger on her behalf. She’d lost her sister, and she was here, coming in to the same building where the aurors who’d killed Ravenna were working.
Yeah, he was going to count this as a win, even if he had no idea what he’d actually done to gain the house’s respect. Beggars, choosers, all that rot.
As he watched, the boy beside her reached up slowly and took her wrist, pulling it down to rest on her knee and cover it with his own.
That’s what Neville had said about the Carrows. First years. There had to have been some Slytherins who objected.
And Kingsley couldn’t show favoritism now, because if he did, people would link him to Harry. Harry, who had decided right away that people needed to know how heinous this was. Harry, who had a penchant for telling the truth even when it fucked him over.
to,” she said waspishly. “I’m holding out for the day I find something that doesn’t taste like piss or nail polish remover. There’s got to be some reason everyone’s so obsessed.”
Voldemort lay on the ground. Splayed out like Dumbledore. His eyes white now, instead of red, and staring up at the approaching light of dawn.
As if experiencing a phantom pain he felt the echo of Voldemort’s outrage before his scream pierced the chaos, causing everyone except Harry to flinch. Knowing instinctively where he was, Harry whirled around in time to cast a Shield Charm before Voldemort’s curse hit Hermione and Neville.
The second time through was worse. He remembered everything viscerally, to his mild horror. Every detail, every moment—apparently his brain had been storing it all somewhere he hadn’t been able to access without three Ministry officials staring at him. Telling Bill hadn’t been easy, but it had been brief. He hadn’t stopped him and questioned him every few minutes. Robards seemed fixated on the actual attack, what Goyle had done to him.
Tentatively, he flexed his hand. It didn’t hurt anymore, thank Merlin, but it felt—odd. Not as odd as his arm had felt the week after he’d had to regrow all the bones inside it, but not normal. He ran his thumbnail along the lines, taking it in with a kind of resignation which should probably worry him. He had the almost comforting thought that it looked more like a tree than the lightning bolt on his forehead and the blast on his chest.
“Oh, I know, you’re very busy. I’m not needling.” Her smile was warm and gentle, and Harry felt like the world’s biggest prat for not checking in sooner. “The trials start soon, don’t they?”
“Ah, yes, and this is the part where you tell me how lucky I am you were there to rescue me. Like I couldn’t have saved
But the tears didn’t come. He didn’t cry. His grief felt like it belonged to someone else, trapped behind a glass wall where he could look at it but he couldn’t claim it. In a detached kind of morbidity, he wondered if he had at last lost enough people for it not to touch him anymore. Fred, Tonks, Remus—maybe they’d pushed him over the edge. Or maybe some part of him had broken when Voldemort tried to kill him. That piece of Voldemort’s soul taking with it the last of his humanity when Voldemort died for good. Maybe he had broken it himself when he’d killed Voldemort.
For a moment, nothing happened apart from a few sparks and a trail of smoke. Harry had the horrible thought that it was broken, that Goyle really had taken control of it and Harry wouldn’t be able to—
So when he woke to a new copy of the Quibbler sitting on his back porch, on the cover a somber, simple illustration of a girl sitting on a bench with her face hidden and a manacle on her ankle, he was relieved. He read through the article, surprised by the addition of an anonymous source from the Ministry itself which confirmed everything and lent support for Harry’s condemnation of the practice. He wondered who it was—if it was Arthur or Bill, maybe Percy felt bad enough to throw him a bone. He hadn’t seen Kingsley since the trials started, but he knew it would be too much to hope he’d read this and realize he was feeding into the same cycle they’d gone through during the war.
The beach fell away. The waves turned to shadow and the sand to hard, cold earth. The sky painted itself darker, roiling now with clouds holding black and grey shadows. The sound of lightning cracked in the distance.
“Come on, Potter,” he said, low, tilting his head. “Use your imagination. Not like you don’t have enough experience.”
“Like you said. They’re probably trying to make up for those years of treating me like a criminal.” He shouldn’t press it. It was bad enough Malfoy was here, Harry didn’t need to go provoking him.
that made him want to hide from his own embarrassment. Perfectly reasonable to drop it like it had burned him. Also, perfectly reasonable, to keep an eye out for more. Maybe they’d be worth something if he could find the whole set.
“Look,” Bill said, leaning in, “he didn’t have a lot of other options. Half the Wizengamot wanted to throw the children of anyone suspected of being a death eater or a Voldemort sympathizer in jail with their parents. It was all Kingsley could do to keep them out until they got a fair trial. This was the best we could—”
He left out the part about never really thinking about this because he had always thought he would die as a child but he didn’t think Bill would appreciate the joke. Or maybe he would. Bill was good like that.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked to him. A little jolt went through Harry when they met his, but then Malfoy relaxed, a surprised twitch to his mouth. “Peeves used up all the pepper shakers dumping them in his trousers, didn’t he?”
So it was with this determination that he cast the Fidelius Charm. And really, after what he’d done down in the cellar, it was simple.
Harry knelt on the dirt floor at the base of Grimmauld Place, arms tight and hot as they leaked his blood, his life force, out and into the house. He looked up. The black entity hung in the air, still for the first time. There was no malevolence any more, no fighting will.
“Tell me how using children to punish their parents is a good thing, Bill,” Harry said, low and rough. “Tell me how threatening the lives of children is a fucking
It’d take even the smartest and most enthusiastic of bibliophiles years to begin to make sense of everything hidden in this attic, but Harry started. And after a while he stopped thinking of Hermione every time he picked up a book he thought she would like, which was most books, granted.
Meeting Kingsley’s gaze now, he felt the final brick laid in the wall between him and everyone else. Kingsley wasn’t looking at him like he was an eighteen-year-old kid who’d had a temper tantrum. It was more like Harry was an unknown quantity—there was pity there, sure, and a decent amount of shame and affection, but Harry felt it through the filter of separation between them. He was the Minister for Magic, arguably one of the most powerful people in Britain, and Harry still couldn’t be reached.
“Or what?” Malfoy stepped toward him, a challenge flashing in his eyes, hungry and raw and burning like the fiendfyre Harry had pulled him out of only hours before. “What are you going to do, Potter? Are you going to
have been happy, brilliantly, wonderfully, happy to be given a life he was never meant to have, he wasn’t. He wasn’t upset but he wasn’t staring into the future with hope and determination. More like he was staring down an oncoming storm.
Bill shook his head, mouth tight. “I heard people talking about it a few weeks ago but I never thought they’d actually go through with it. Hogwarts has never closed down.”
Harry should have known it would be different for him this time but he was still surprised to see that his beam of light was sliver and blue, steady and pulsing and bright—not red, not anymore. His line of light thrummed and pulsed—
“I think you should do like Ron and not talk to me for a while. I think—I think I need time. Alone, or… More time, to think, or… I don’t—” He exhaled, the sound curled around a final sob. He pushed his hair back as he cleared his throat, voice still shaking with his hands. Going through the motions like someone else was pulling the strings.
He took a deep breath and braced himself, then he opened his eyes. It was dark, all sound muffled. The air was cold, but not overly so. It smelled of damp earth and old stone.
“They didn’t do anything to stop it, either. You heard what went on at school last year. The Slytherins were given free reign to do whatever they wanted, and it was a fucking nightmare.”
All his life, he’d been told he looked like his dad. Staring into his mirror now, he finally saw it.
Bill nodded. “Kid’s the best curse-breaker I’ve ever met. Instincts like his would land him any job he wanted in the field tomorrow, if he wasn’t—you know. When I was his age I couldn’t get myself out of a Victorian tomb, but by the time anyone showed up at Malfoy Manor to bring his parents in, he’d apparently already emptied out the first level of the family cellar and had removed most of the nastier curses he could find, all on his own. That’s why they called me in. It was a veritable treasure trove of dark artifacts, just sitting out on the lawn like a fair. Makes Grimmauld Place seem like a laugh.” A dark look passed over Bill’s face. “I’m surprised nothing worse happened to you when you were taken there. From what I could tell, the curses Voldemort worked around that place were incredibly powerful. The kind of dark magic that makes you wonder how anyone could even live in the midst of it.”
Harry’s voice came out cold and flat. “Maybe I’ve got a charmed ring on. Want to check for that too?” He lifted his hands up and offered them to her. They weren’t shaking. “Or maybe a necklace? It’ll take me a second to get my tie off, so you might have to stop throwing countercharms at me while I do it.”
Harry’s grip was slick with his own blood as he lifted his wand—in his left hand. His right was still pulsing and cracking every time he moved it.
Harry didn’t know what he’d been expecting in this final confrontation. He hadn’t planned on surviving and he didn’t know how or
Just under his right elbow his skin neatly split, running nearly five inches before it stopped. A line of blood welled up and fell, steaming where it met the sigil. It brought power, though, and with it Harry shoved the interference away. Exhilaration flooded through him and he pressed forward, his words growing stronger and faster. He could feel it now, how the ancient cleansing spell was spreading out from him and into the rest of the house, crawling up from the foundations to cover every surface and nook, every dusty hallway and mold-ridden banister. He felt all the places which had been hidden for so long, the darkened corners and the rooms tucked away so as to preserve them. He felt the lingering emptiness of the house rise up from the ground—its isolation and pain when Sirius had come back only to rip it apart and treat it like it meant nothing.
