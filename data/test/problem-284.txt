( grimsfairytales) feel free to leave me requests and other things (Once I figure out how to use it) I'm also looking for a beta reader!
"What houses do you think you'll be in? Gryffindor does hold merit, although I think I'll be Ravenclaw." Hermione moaned as she talked about it. Draco felt a little offended. This girl seemed insulted that she'll end up in a house he wished to be a part of.
They were half-bloods and Mudbloods who did not deserve his attention.
Do stay safe, I will write to you soon.
Thank you for those who read, reviewed, and kudos'd this book on archiveofourown, you all make my day.
"My name is Lily Potter, n√©e Evans. Harry, our son, this will is made for you, to be seen and read after we die."
Will Lucius harm his son?
Thus, Harry knew that he was no longer a freak. But just a little boy who found a new home.
"I, Harry James Potter, give Hermione Jean Granger and Neville Longbottom the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." Harry finished with a big smile, and Draco was proud of him. Hermione was jumpy as it was her turn to finish the dance. With a clear of her throat, she began.
Severus decided that this is something that will be discussed when the students go back to school.
"I'm Harry, Harry James Potter. Nice to meet you both." Both Hermione and Neville's eyes widen.
"Get your belongings, Harry. I'm taking you with me." The room began to spin around Harry's eyes. Did he hear right? He was being taken away? Was he going to finally get a family? Was this man here to save him? But Harry began to despair. What if he takes to a place worse than the Dursley's? What if he hurts me? What if this is a dream? Tears stung Harry's eyes, but something inside told him to trust this man.
"I want to be in Ravenclaw because I value knowledge and wisdom over, power and control. I am ambitious, yes, but I want to use what I will gain to help others than to serve myself foremost. Knowledge, to me, is everything, and I know that Ravenclaw will help me learn and grow. So please, let me be in Ravenclaw." The Sorting Hat was silent. It made Draco terrified. He hoped he said enough for the Sorting Hat. Then he felt the hat move its mouth.
"Harry, I'll sleep for a bit. I wasn't able to sleep well. Wake me up when we're close to the school?" Harry looked at him, from his book,
"Where should we sit for breakfast?" Draco's head snapped to Harry's.
"Should any of Harry's godparents be indisposed or unable to take care of him, Severus Snape shall take of him. My son will not be placed in the care of my sister, Petunia Dursley, and her family. So mote it be."
"Draco, stay safe. I love you. Let me know should you require anything from home." That was his mother. Draco let himself smile for his mother and a kiss on her cheek.
"Thank you, Griphook." He turned to face James Potter, whose arms were around his wife, comforting her as she cried. Griphook, once more noded. He didn't know what to say. What right does a Goblin have in these kinds of matters?

Draco looked at godfather, who gave him a small nod of approval. Draco beamed at him and turned to Harry, who was about to be sorted.
- The-Songbird-Who-Wrote
Draco
"Then why have none of you contact us?" Now, Mr. Snape asked. His eyes were looking straight at Harry and then shifted to Draco. Harry gulped.
Harry didn't know what to feel. First, his childhood could've been different. Second, the Headmaster of his school was his magical guardian who didn't let Harry know of his late parent's will. Third, Harry was scared. He didn't know what to expect from the reading of the will. He also longed to see and to know something that belonged to his parents.
Soon he and Mr. Snape left Gringotts, of course bowing their heads in thanks before leaving. He and Mr. Snape were walking down Diagon Alley. The sight of the Alley took Harry's breath away. It was beautiful. But then he realized the abundance of people and the sight almost shattered. Keyword: almost. Mr. Snape held tightly to his arm and made his way, pushing past people to reach Madam Malkin's.
"I'm currently reading,
A now eleven-year-old Draco Lucius Malfoy was jumping in joy. He had received his Hogwarts letter. He was ecstatic. Although, not too much. He remembered the argument his mother and father had about his education. His father wanted him to go to Durmstrang so he could be with strong Dark wizards, but his mother wanted him to go to Hogwarts where he'll learn how to cooperate and meets all kinds of people. Plus, his mother wanted him closer to home. Draco agreed with his mother. He did want to go to Hogwarts. He wanted to meet all kinds of people, Durmstrang wouldn't give him that opportunity.
Sev will forever stay for pinning for lovely Lily until the end of times? Which is okay but I'm so curious.
Soon, they stood in front of a door with an eagle knocker on it.
Harry's professors were kind, strict, and friendly. They all varied and had their quirks. Professor McGonagall, the strict Transfiguration professor, but a fair judge of character who treated everyone fairly. Harry liked her a lot. Professor Flitwick, the Charms professor, is a little man who taught with a smile and helped out anyone who needed it. Everyone liked Professor Flitwick, who could hate the kind man? Professor Sprout, his head-of-house, taught Herbology. Herbology to Harry was interesting as this subject and Potions were related to each other. Technically, mastery over one of them makes work easier for the other. Professor Quirrell, the teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts, was an odd man. His class smelled like garlic, and being in the class made Harry's head hurt. It was weird as Harry did not have a headache before, but said headache left the moment he stepped out of the classroom. Harry blamed in on the smell of garlic.

"I see. I forgot about that, well, I, Cedric Diggory, give Harry James Potter the right to call me by my given name, so mote it be." Harry was thankful that Cedric realized what he was doing, so he responded as well.
"Thank you, oh thank you, Mr. Snape!" Severus could feel Harry's tears soaking into his cloak. He found that he didn't mind but gently hugged the boy back. Severus noticed that Griphook was smiling.

"Harry, I am so proud of you, my son. Your father and I are so sorry you have to lead the life you will lead. But Harry, I know you will do us proud. Don't listen to those who you want you to become like us, no Harry, be you. Be proud of who you are, and do things that will make you happy, not because it's expected of you."
First, I want to say thank you to all those who have been reading this book on all three websites I used to publish this book.
Sorry for not updating, school just started for me... but I will try to update one - three times a week, so I apologize for slower updates from now on TT~TT. Also know that some dialogue does not belong to me, but from J.K Rowling.
"Wanna leave, Harry?" Harry sighed and shrugged his shoulders.
"I almost called you, Potter, that is your last name. My name is Severus Snape. You may call me whatever you wish, but do make sure that it is appropriate, such as sir." The man, now identified as Severus Snape said. Harry was happy. He now knew the name of his savior.
First and foremost, I'm so sorry that I haven't updated in a while. I recently took my SAT and used the week to study for it. I'll be back with 1-3 updates per week again. Thank you for understanding and I hope you enjoy the chapter!
Otherwise, his days have been boring. He wandered in the manor, or he read his books to get a head start and know what he will be learning. He wondered what Harry was doing now. He found out that his godfather had been teaching Harry how to read and write, more on writing. Harry had told him how horrendous his writing was, and Draco had not believed him until he saw first hand his writing. Draco thought at first; it was a chicken who wrote, but imagine his surprise when he found out it was Harry's. Thankfully, through each letter Harry sent him, his writing got better.
"Wait, Ms. Gloris!" Hermione had rushed up to the female.
"It'll be alright. Should anything go wrong, me, Harry, and Neville will take care of it." The conviction in Hermione's voice made Draco chuckled and hugged her back. He was thankful for his friendship with the girl and the two other boys. He was also glad that he had his Godfather Sev to care for him too.
Oh, how Lucius recognized that manner of walking. He knew it was Severus underneath those glamors. But he was curious as to who was the boy next to him.
To his surprise, the man beckoned him over to sit with him. Harry was surprised. He was never allowed to sit at the table. Freaks were never allowed places on the table his aunt had told him, yet this man wanted him to sit with him. Harry slowly walked until he reached the man.
She looked at her son who appeared to be nervous. She didn't fault Draco, after all, it was his first time in Diagon Alley. She could smell the anxiety from her son, and if she could smell it, then so could the others staring at them. She dared them, with her eyes, to pounce on him. Narcissa will strike at them, with the grace of the white peacocks at Malfoy Manor.
The common room was beautiful. The architecture was astonishing. Although Hermione wished to ogle it more, she was tired and wanted to rest. It seemed that the prefects knew of this and quickly sent the rest of the first years to their beds. Hermione gave Draco a sleepy wave before she went inside her room. She was also too tired to know her roommates, and just as she flung her body onto the bed, she quickly fell asleep.
Severus distantly heard Harry crying. But he wanted to cry as well. Lily, how he missed her voice. But Harry, the boy was supposed to be in care. Harry was supposed to grow with Snape, loved, and cared for. Not to be left to the abuse of those Muggles. But Severus heard one more revelation that shocked him even more.
A ten-year-old Harry James Potter was currently being picked on by his cousin. He didn't understand why. On the telly, especially on the shows, his Aunt Petunia watched, a family was to care for each other, to love and cherish. Yet why was Harry unloved? Why was Aunt Petunia always yelling at him? Why was his Uncle Vernon always hitting him? Was he not their family? Harry knew the answer was no. He was never a part of the Dursely's and their perfect family. They didn't have a place for a freak like him.
Draco and his parents waited for almost five minutes, then Harry appeared with Hedwig in her cage, his trunk nowhere to be seen. Harry must have seen his confusion.
Harry had told Parvati that he'd explore the two suspicious rooms soon, but Harry can't shake off his constant bone-deep weariness. His sleep cycle had been well and truly disrupted ‚Äî leaving the club at three or even four in the morning, tumbling into bed and waking up late morning to pop by the Ministry or have lunch with Ron and Hermione, having brought forward their dinner dates to accommodate Harry's new schedule. Sometimes, he'd have the luxury of a nap before reporting to Serpentes at eleven pm.
It‚Äôs as if he has lost his way.
There is a much smaller box on top of a table and unlike the other boxes, this one isn't sealed.
Draco opens the creaking box, revealing a pair of rings nestled in lush green silk.
"Will everything go to Hermione's charity? Is that how you dispose of your clients‚Äô things?‚Äù
"Oh no, we're not allowed to come yet, we're not at the other side of the bed." With a mischievous glint in his eye, Harry yanks Draco down on the bed just a bit further from where they were. He gets into a new position on his side, his right leg in the air and right hand tucked underneath his bent knee, holding himself wide open.
Harry removes his glasses and hangs his head, rubbing his face in frustration and longing.
‚ÄúAlright?‚Äù he says, supporting himself by resting his palms on either side of Malfoy‚Äôs head and steadying his knees on the bed. He shifts Malfoy‚Äôs legs until the backs of his knees rest on Harry‚Äôs shoulders. His prick slips out slightly as he makes Malfoy comfortable, and he quickly eases in, desperate for every inch to be engulfed in Malfoy‚Äôs intoxicating heat.
"Because you're out with me," Draco says, splaying a hand over his chest.
"Friends?" Draco finishes, rubbing a brow with his thumb. "Certainly not friends like you and him, though," he adds, slight bitterness colouring his tone.
‚ÄúYes, Draco,
"So, just friends?" Potter summarises, sagging in defeat.
Potter breaks away to feather kisses on Draco's throat and jawline. Draco purrs in contentment and arches towards Potter's body, eager to feel more. He lifts his hips up and thrusts experimentally, only to find out that both Potter and he are half-hard.
So... he's going to be stripping at Malfoy's club.
"Travelling for leisure sounds wonderful. Permanent relocation, however‚Ä¶" Malfoy rests his chin on top of Harry's head. "I have to stay here because of my parents, and this will never change as long as they're still around. But when it‚Äôs years into the future, when there's nothing rooting me to Britain, I wouldn't mind going away with you. I am not tied down by my career."
"And you'll love every second of it," he hisses, eyes flashing. He nips once at Potter's earlobe and withdraws.
Hermione presses her lips together to hide a smile.
Draco props his guitar on the wall, and moves to the centre of the room, his head turning as he scans each painting ‚Äî Empire State Building, Mona's, Times Square, Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge amongst others ‚Äî paintings that contain Harry's treasured memories of their time together. He did sell some works, but he couldn't bear to part with these. He's expecting Draco to register shock or surprise, but instead, a lovely, pleased blush fills Draco‚Äôs cheeks. He says fondly, "I thought you'd sell everything, but you kept these. They‚Äôre my favourite ones too."
"Hallelujah! Finally he gets it!" Ron whoops in relief and does a funny sort of jig around the table.
Something deep, pent-up and
"You remembered that my favourite dessert is treacle tart?"
Harry angles a look at him, his eyes dark with desire at the double entendre. As if he can't wait another second longer, he grabs Draco's hand and tugs him closer.
She straightens up to face him, a small smile gracing her lips. "Thank you, Draco. I can't imagine how I would cope without you.‚Äù
drives Draco wild.
"I can't wait for him forever."
A lack of funding, aging equipment (such as dragon trackers and alarm systems), too little staff and the increased sophistication of poachers' tools spelled bad news for the sanctuary. As Charlie is a teacher at Hogwarts to be nearer to his family and to mould the next generation of conservationists and magizoologists, he could not stay on at the sanctuary as a paid worker, so he remains as a volunteer during holidays.
"Hey, no Malfoy?" Seamus asks Parkinson.
"Just tell me one thing, Andrew," Harry says, even though his eyes are still fixed on Malfoy's. "Did the Ministry specifically request for him to open shop right opposite mine so that I could keep an eye on him?"
Maybe she'll be spending even more time studying at Sugarcoated instead of the library.
Potter can only grunt, he's so far gone. A heady sense of
Harry shifts his knees on the bed. "Get your sexy legs around me," he rasps. Malfoy obeys, wrapping his legs around Harry's waist, hooking his ankles together and resting his soles on Harry‚Äôs back. This opens him up more, and with a racing heart, Harry slides deeper into him, the drag of his cock excruciatingly slow until he's fully seated inside him. It's as brilliant as he remembered; this tight warmth consuming Harry, this overwhelming sensation reducing him to his primal instincts to thrust and fuck, to claim and control.
There Harry Potter stands in front of him, looking weary but very much alive.
‚ÄúYeah. Can‚Äôt forget,‚Äù Harry mumbles between licks and kisses. He trails his hands down Malfoy‚Äôs back, like how he did seven years ago. ‚ÄúThink about it all the time. You?‚Äù
The predatory spark rekindles in Harry's eyes, and Draco cants his hips against Harry's in encouragement.
Draco puts the vial down and hangs his head when he catches himself wondering if Potter will pop by the lab. Despite himself, he has to admit that Potter livens things up in the shop.
Harry‚Äôs breath catches in his throat at the mention of Malfoy, but his hope deflates when he connects the dots. Malfoy knows, and judging by Seamus' earlier question, his appearance at the pub is rather common. But he's not here tonight, because he wants to avoid Harry.
Gryffindor ‚Äî and Draco doesn‚Äôt want to hear that, because he has absolutely nothing to apologise for ‚Äî he‚Äôs been such an attentive, thoughtful lover. Draco shushes Potter and sits up, moving so that he‚Äôs face-to-face with the other man. He smooths Potter‚Äôs hair back, brushing away the sweat trailing down the sides of his face.
Harry grins and sweeps some pixie dust off Draco, who‚Äôs still staring in wide-eyed wonder at the tree.
‚ÄúTell me when it hurts,‚Äù Potter mutters, pushing in. Desire and anticipation burns in Draco‚Äôs blood like a liquid inferno ‚Äî it‚Äôs finally happening, after so many months of unbridled lust ‚Äî when the head of Potter‚Äôs cock slips in easily; the reward of his patient prep. Draco rolls his hips in tiny circles in encouragement, groaning when he sinks in deeper, continuing his slow, slick slide into Draco, and
"Yes. I've been busy," Draco hedges. "You too, I'm sure."
"Oh," Harry says, his face falling.
"I‚Ä¶" Harry trails off, thinking about the stares, whispers and increased scrutiny he'll have to endure back in Britain. But he gazes at Malfoy, and he knows with a startling clarity that he can‚Äôt bear to be apart from him. "I told Kingsley to transfer me permanently back to the London Ministry until further notice. There'll still be travelling, but just a couple of days here and there, two weeks at the most."
Harry still has his wanderlust from time to time, especially when his colleagues return from new and exciting places. He'll think back to the times when he drifted from country to country, living out of his suitcase and exploring places that he never would've dreamed of going.
Draco releases a pent-up moan when Harry's voice crackles through the tape recorder. He places the recorder on the pillow near his head and moves his hands down his body.
They spend a good portion of the night talking and kissing, holding hands and laughing. It's a late hour when they return to Hogwarts, strolling with gooey grins on their faces and clasped hands.
He can't deny how Potter's unchained his smile bit by bit, even though Draco always hides it beneath a subdued sneer, behind a hand or reluctant twitch of lips, but as the music fades away, Draco lets a genuine smile blossom on his face...
‚ÄúOf course I‚Ä¶ how dare you‚Ä¶ how
Narcissa waved his protest aside. "The point is; I do not think that we would fit very well with the general... spirit of tonight if we come dressed in formal wear. Lucius protested about this, but eventually I was able to turn his mind around. Hence this," she explained, gesturing to her dress. "I didn't expect it to be so... comfortable."
"Told you I'm gonna fuck you in every room. There's lube everywhere." He flashes a hungry smile. Potter flexes his arms and lifts his legs up even higher, displaying himself.
Sweet Salazar, Harry‚Äôs going to propose. Knowing the great big sap that he is, he's probably going to do it around Christmas time.
Draco woke up with a throbbing erection, one that was impossible to ignore, and since his alarm was silent, he indulged in a luxurious wank ‚Äî
Draco lowers himself shakily into the seat opposite the other boy. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you what you want.‚Äù
There's someone calling his name. Harry's eyelids flicker open, and he is greeted by a nurse... or a Healer... peering down at him. His experience of waking up in hospital beds has taught him to wiggle his toes and fingers and flex his muscles to check if everything was there. Oh, there it is, a sharp pain coiling somewhere near his right bicep. He looks down ‚Äî his chest is bare, and there‚Äôs a bandage wrapped around his arm.
"No luck?" he asks.
And then he slides a hand down the arch of Harry's back, pulls him close and kisses him.
"Yeah?"
Harry chuckles shakily, kissing Malfoy's shoulder. "It's pretty good for me too."
"Can I call you Harry? Please?" Draco asks in a broken whisper, the last of his emotional control unravelling like pearls sliding off a snapped necklace. In all of his fantasies, he's always called Potter by his first name. He just needs this one last thing to make it all come true.
You're too clumsy off the stage, banging your ankle on table legs and knocking things over, as if your body is too big for you.
He lies down beside Draco, wondering about his change in behaviour. When Draco reaches over and laces his fingers with Harry's, Harry tightens his grip on Draco at once, his heart leaping.
‚Äî He's so high on Harry, floating on a cloud of carnal pleasure and he doesn't want to get down, oh no he doesn't‚Äî
He was twenty years old, hormonal and lust-filled. Seven years have passed, and he would like to think he's above that now.
!‚Äù Draco wails, clinging onto Potter. His heels dig into Potter‚Äôs back, and his fingers clench into the bedsheets to ground himself in the onslaught of the sex.
"Let's go for dinner now," Potter says, leaping into action. He yanks the duvet back, and swings his legs over the bed, much to Draco's astonishment. Pork Chop makes an admonishing sound and leans forward, trying to pull him back.
, that word floating on a sigh that went straight to Harry's heart, painting a world of promises that he desperately wants to keep.
Potter‚Äôs jaw clenches, and he nods.
Harry's heart stutters when Parkinson, Ron and Hermione dart a look at Harry.
"Well, at least you weren't working on a Tiny Twister."
Harry watches the vendor prepare their food. He sprinkles handfuls of marinated grilled chicken cubes and lettuce over their flatbread, drizzles sauce on the chicken, rolls the flatbread up and wraps it in paper. As he works, he engages Malfoy in superficial conversation about his gigs and gripes about the increasing cost of living, with Malfoy nodding and answering politely.
When Draco bows and offers her his arm in an exaggerated manner, she giggles and takes it. He nabs their jackets on the way out.
Draco's never seen Potter without his glasses.
eyes on him, including Bacon's, who lies concealed somewhere in the room. The air's thick with anticipation and excitement, causing the butterflies in Harry's belly to mutate into a herd of stampeding centaurs... and somewhere, he can already hear the promising rise of music filtering through his ears, but he just can't seem to move his body-
And then he turns and leaves, closing the door quietly behind him.
Malfoy opens his eyes and shakes his head, anxious. "Don't stop. I just need to get used to this. I don't want you to‚Äî"
"Sure you don't," Harry says, dragging the
Draco scans the other teachers ‚Äî Minerva is smiling into her pumpkin juice, while Filius is eyeing Potter and him in avid interest. The others show varying degrees of amusement, with Horace jostling Pomona and whispering something into her ear, triggering a chortle.
He must look rather cornered, as Hermione's grin widens into a triumphant smirk. She leans back, folds her arms across her chest and seems extremely pleased, as if she has unravelled one of her puzzles in the Department of Mysteries.
Malfoy finally breaks the silence by pointing at a quieter and shaded spot looking west towards the Hudson River. "I often write my songs there."
He suddenly paled, eyes wide with alarm.
Ignoring Potter‚Äôs cry of his name, he slips away into the night. His heart rattling around in his chest like a trapped bird in a cage, he runs across the grounds, back into Hogwarts and hurtles into the first empty classroom he sees. Draco collapses in the dusty corner and presses the heels of his hands over his eyes.
‚ÄúWell, the name is Draco!‚Äù I look up to find Draco‚Äôs blush has bled into his neck. I can see a storm forming in those beautiful grey eyes.
Harry collapses next to Draco but keeping him in his arms.
‚ÄúHarry! Love! How was work? I missed you so much!‚Äù Draco flatly ignores Harry's questions while adjusting his outfit. A red corset is binned to Draco‚Äôs chest. Said corset is mostly lace only truly covering the chest area. The corset complements his feminine like figure that any woman would kill for. To match the corset Draco threw on a red lacy thong that hugs his hips in the most delicious way. Draco has a kink for women‚Äôs underwear, Harry has and will never have an issue with Draco exploring his more feminine side. Harry truly does love Draco in red. It brings out his porcelain-like skin and when he blushes its game over for Harry.
Harry jerked and bit his lip as Draco sucked him down again. His voice stayed relatively steady though. "There was, well, something I might have thought about for a while. Didn‚Äôt see it in your contract."
"I was motivated."
"Can‚Äôt," Harry said. "Got a ticket to that charity ball Charlie‚Äôs speaking at tonight. Benefit for British Dragons."
Charlie snickered. "They might have objected to my addendum to Form CP-10 (Justification of Requests For Protective Charms). I might have included a small working model of a Hungarian Hornback."
Potter snorted, close enough that Draco could feel the puff of air against his arse. "True."
The tips of Draco‚Äôs ears went pink. Harry oh-so-slightly licked his lips out of Ron‚Äôs line of sight.
"No," Draco said, "I haven‚Äôt served you. You have to let me‚Äî" He wasn‚Äôt sure why he said it. Was it just habit, feeling that things weren‚Äôt properly concluded if he hadn‚Äôt taken care of Charlie? Or was it that intense and unexpected connection with Potter? Was he running away from that?
Charlie waved them on. "Yep. Just his mouth really, unless you feel like scrubbing him down a bit. I gave him a good hosing earlier so he doesn‚Äôt need it."
"Yeah, well, spill on the romance then, if you want to pay us back," George said. "What‚Äôs the problem?"
wardrobe.
"Done with that?" Charlie asked. "He‚Äôs a good boy but caning does tend to make him scream. Might not want your cock in there." The sound of wood swishing through the air came from behind him.
Harry followed Draco over, unable to stop touching for more than a few moments at a time, it seemed. His eyes roamed all over Draco, lingering on his pre-come smeared cock. "Do you ever," he asked hesitantly, "er, suck him? Is that something tops do?"
"There‚Äôs a ring there, do you see it?" Charlie must be pointing. "Can you snap that onto his harness, secure his bollocks for me? Don‚Äôt want them flopping in the way when I‚Äôm blistering his arse."
"Hell, you feel so fucking good," Harry said as he slid in. "You can‚Äôt resist at all, can you? Is it the silk or is it your training, or is it just that you want it so much?"
No way could Harry sleep. Each minute that ticked away was one less that he had with Draco Malfoy. It was no real consolation to know his sixteen-year-old self had been right: the git was absolutely worth obsessing over.
"Good boy," Charlie said, easing up a little on the pressure. "That wasn‚Äôt so bad, was it?"
There‚Äôd been a mother cat at the Manor once who‚Äôd had a litter. She‚Äôd let Draco play with her kittens for a while, but sooner or later she‚Äôd always pick them up by the scruff and carry them back to her box. She‚Äôd lick and clean them, all the while fixing Draco with a jealous glare. Washing his touch off.
"I can afford him," Harry said with a little flash of pride.
Charlie almost snorted. That was all it was? "Yeah, he‚Äôs used to that. Didn‚Äôt bother to put it in the contract. I like to start out that way with a slave, probably would have advised you to as well. Think it‚Äôs good for building trust and submission. Make him work for his dinner, at least until he‚Äôs reliably following your commands."
Charlie hadn‚Äôt even asked why a professional Auror‚Äîa Dark-Lord-slaying Auror no less--was apparently helpless against the wizarding equivalent of a mouse. Harry‚Äôd had to do it, though. He couldn‚Äôt leave it like that with Malfoy. He needed a chance to explain himself and he needed it be somewhere the idiot couldn‚Äôt run off mid-talk.
"You‚Äôre an arsehole, a wanker, a fucking cunt, you know that?" Draco humped the rug, helplessly. " An absolute bea-bea-b-b-beast," he stuttered out as shock after shock made him shake his rump and sob.
"It‚Äôs too much," he whimpered out finally, as Potter kept pushing in. It felt enormous, it was huge, it was so hard, he‚Äôd never had such a big cock in him. "Please, no, I need you to stop or wait just a moment, please."
When he finished, he sat back up and almost groaned. Draco was kneeling face down to the ground, graceful even with his legs forced cruelly far apart, thighs stretched almost until they shook. The genital ring compelled him to strain just that little bit more or else have his bollocks stretched instead. His chest was held to the floor with the two wicked nipple clamps and his back was forced into an arch, arms high and tight below his shoulder blades.
Harry was hard again too but he ignored it. Each time he had Draco the ache inside himself only seemed to worsen. He should have known a taste or two would never be enough. So what if you discover exactly what you want, he thought‚Äîwhat does it matter if someone else already owns it?
Potter hurries down the staircase, holding a faded Gryffindor scarf. He glances out the window, and then tosses the scarf on the sofa. "C'mon," he says. They exit the house, and Draco gazes at the sunset. It hasn‚Äôt snowed in a while, and it‚Äôs not raining as often.
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù
"I've grown up eating her food. All the wonderful scents, the heat from the ovens, and the taste of her pastries remind me so much of home, comfort, family and love. That was what I hung on to, and I just simply watched her work her magic. I didn't jump straight into baking then, but after that day, I was interested.
Draco stops dancing.
means. Malfoy dabs his lips on a napkin, gets up from the table and carries his wine glass out of the kitchen. Harry follows suit, and they end up at Malfoy's sofa. Malfoy's long legs are tucked underneath his body, his elbows raised up and resting against the top of the sofa and his head leaning on his arms while he regards Harry with bedroom eyes.
"No, Ron. I have to go." Harry sprints up the steps, two at a time. "I'm leaving Hogwarts. We're finished with our exams anyway."
"Wait, Potter, you can't just whisk me away to Paris!" Draco bellows, yanking his hand away.
looking," Harry whispers, eyes trained on Malfoy's cherry-glazed lips... lips that slowly tug up in a Cheshire cat's grin when Malfoy hears Harry's answer.
Pansy leans back on the sofa and stretches her legs out, revealing her third tattoo. It‚Äôs a small dragon tattoo on the inside of her right ankle. The dragon is coloured in black, green and silver‚Äîthe shades of the Malfoy family crest. Pansy got this tattoo when Draco told her that he was returning to the UK for his current stint with the
He grins at the glazed-over look in Potter‚Äôs eyes ‚Äî no doubt he‚Äôs imagining that very scene. He slides off Potter‚Äôs legs, and they scramble up from the floor, stumbling through tables until they reach their destination. Potter loses his shirt on the way, adding on to the snaking trail of clothes left in their wake.
He's not going to last long, and Potter seems to know it as he jacks up the pace, hitting all the sweet spots that make Draco's eyes roll back and starbursts of fever-pitch ecstasy explode in Draco's body.
Biting his lip, he pushes back into Malfoy again. Malfoy releases a surprised sound, which melts into a rumbling moan. He whispers Harry‚Äôs name, spreading his legs and allowing Harry to fuck him slowly, until he finally goes soft.
‚ÄúNot going back. Gonna stay here with you,‚Äù Harry murmurs, nuzzling into Malfoy‚Äôs neck.
"You do like steak, don't you, Malfoy?!"
Harry is finally home.
"I know." Pansy returns the book to the pile. "But there will come a time when I can practise my magical tattoos. Things are improving. Slowly, but surely," she says, rubbing her family ring on the fourth finger of her right hand.
And the knowledge that Potter wants
Malfoy drains his bubble tea. He pokes Harry's leg with his foot. "Get to work, you lazy arse. I'll play when you paint," he says, looking pointedly at Harry's art things.
A long, loaded pause.
Charlie grunts into Potter‚Äôs palm and pushes him away. ‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt talk about it, he‚Äôs there‚Äî‚Äú
"Are you going to see him tonight?" The snake asks, bouncing eagerly.
"You wore those jeans, didn't you?" Potter says, pleased.
"Thought you'd never ask." With that, Potter shimmies out of his boxers and starts to lower his body on top of Draco's in a 69 position.
Potter‚Äôs smile fades, and he goes back to folding down the corners of his napkin. Draco finds his gaze wandering to the other patrons, and he hopes their food arrives soon. Doubt creeps up his spine.
He walks Malfoy backwards to the barricade, never breaking the kiss. Malfoy brings a hand up, his fingertips skimming Harry's abdomen and chest, as if he wants to keep him close. Harry laces his own fingers with Malfoy's, holding on tight. When Malfoy traces his tongue along the seam of Harry's lips, Harry lets out a moan, feeling rather weak at the knees.
"Only
He even pops a chip into his mouth, as if he's at the movies.
"Thank you for planning this," Harry murmurs.
Fuck, that feels good.
Any other scenario would be too good to be true.
"Yeah, Harry, eat me good, oh yes," Malfoy says around a gasp, his breathy sighs escalating to a yelp when Harry smacks his arse. Harry soothes it with a kiss and another long, lingering lick on his cleft. "Fuck, that's good, so good."
"He's not a child," Draco repeats lightly. The truth is, he has noticed things about Potter lately ‚Äî how the corners of his eyes don't really crinkle as much when he smiles and the faint melancholy weighing him down. He‚Äôs leaving pub nights earlier and spending more time alone at home with his guitar. Perhaps Potter is feeling blue because it‚Äôs the height of winter, but Draco senses that deep down, something's bothering Potter.
‚ÄúSee you then,‚Äù Malfoy says, nodding and walking away, leaving Harry gazing at his arse (yet again).
I'd be thinking of you." He dips a hand between Draco's legs, cupping him lightly. "Wouldn‚Äôt you like to receive naughty texts from me, or some photos of me wearing my Speedos, or perhaps a video of me wanking while I think about you?‚Äù
"Just saying." Potter taps his boot on the ground. "I could bring you to the Thames. I know you like that place, especially at night."
"No!" Harry shouts in panic and thrusts an elbow up, catching Ron on the side of his face. Ron snarls and staggers backwards. Harry recovers in an instant. He has to be with Draco tonight, there's nothing else he wants for Christmas this year.
"Definitely nothing wrong with your food, mate," Ron declares. He would know, having jumped at the chance to be Harry's dessert guinea pig when Harry was working on new recipes for Sugarcoated, the bakery that the 21-year-old had opened a year ago.
"Usually people say thank you, you know," Potter says, flashing Draco a lopsided grin. "You could always shrink them, but..." He gives Draco's arse a lingering look, "your jeans are rather tight, aren't they? Plus, I don't care what people think."
Frowning, Draco turns a dial on his Omnioculars to slow down the replay of last weekend‚Äôs Quidditch match between the Montrose Magpies and Puddlemere United. He locates Angus Campbell, twists another knob to zoom in on the Magpies Chaser and catches the stiff set of Campbell's shoulders and the grimace twisting his lips when he executes a sharp turn on his broomstick.
He lets Malfoy throw him down to the sofa, lets him slide his pyjama bottoms off, lets him slot himself between Harry's thighs and suck him off.
They move to the oven. Harry levitates the treats onto a cooling tray. "Looks pretty good. First time you baked anything, yeah?" he says, grinning. Draco bends down to study the treats at eye-level, checking to see if they really were decent.
Harry blinks in surprise.
Frowning, Draco shakes away the slumber tugging at his senses, and he straightens up, rubbing his eyes. ‚ÄúI think I shall go to bed. Goodnight, Potter. Don‚Äôt stay up too late.‚Äù
"Do you have to rush off somewhere?" Harry asks after a while. He's been noticing how Malfoy's eyes dart to the clock mounted on the wall.
A long pause. Pansy looked away.
...the box containing the engagement ring, signifying promise and potential, a hint of future things to come.
"Then don't," Harry whispers, promptly wrapping Malfoy up in his arms and kissing his smile all over again.
Draco looks around, while Potter fiddles with his napkin. He smiles at Draco, and even though that makes Draco‚Äôs heartrate speed up, it does nothing to dispel the awkwardness. Draco cudgels his mind for conversational topics, but comes up short. Even though they see each other almost every day, this is the first time they‚Äôre spending time alone, without Theo ‚Äî sometimes Potter will drop by their flat for work-related issues after hours ‚Äî to buffer things along.
This whirlwind of a romance with Potter for the past few months has been exhilarating, wonderful, and beyond Draco's wildest dreams. He would never trade Potter for anything, but if it was going to end, he'd rather it end now, before he fell for Potter even more and exposed himself to more heartbreak.
-" Harry cries, collapsing into Malfoy's waiting arms.
‚ÄúNo, stop. Stop,‚Äù Potter says, pushing Draco‚Äôs hand away and turning him around. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna come only when I‚Äôm in you again. Still so horny and desperate for you. Give me a while, yeah?‚Äù
Ron furtively pulled him aside one evening, clutching a few photographs.
A tense silence crackles in the air.
The scornful words slip out before Draco can stop it, and he bites down on his lower lip.
Draco groans, so deep that it vibrates in his chest and throat, eclipsing Potter's encouraging cries, and fuck, he's gonna‚Äî
The other teachers, except Potter and Draco, mutter amongst themselves and pull out their own money. Both men share a look, although Potter's confused expression clears up rather quickly.
Draco exhales, his stomach clenching and his heart beating in double-quick time at the simmering intensity in Potter‚Äôs gaze. He regards Potter under half-lidded eyes, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "I'll definitely keep that in mind, then."
Harry's cock twitches with anticipation.
Her expression is grave when she opens her mouth to speak‚Äî
"Well... yeah. I didn't know it was you at first, but Jason, the shopkeeper at Islington, told me I had a customer that would come in every Sunday and buy roughly three-quarters of my entire stock. I asked him about it, but Jason didn‚Äôt know you by name," Harry explains. He works while he talks, moving around the kitchen and pouring different treats into labelled bowls.
"Or I could just be brave!" Harry calls, dissolving into laughter as he hops down and returns to Draco's side.
Harry‚Äôs job has caused him to miss birthdays, weddings, pub nights, celebrations and Christmases. Still, he wouldn‚Äôt have any other career, which has whisked him away to amazing places with different cultures, food, scenery, people, and ways of thinking.
Despite himself, Draco smiles. He stiffens when Potter moves behind him to wrap his arms around his waist. He inches up on his toes to nip at Draco‚Äôs earlobe.
"Draco," Harry whispers, and presses himself closer to the tree. His breaths are shallow. He is completely still, because this might be another dream again, and if he moves, he'll wake up back in Underground. It's as if the rest of the world has melted away, leaving only Draco shining in the spotlight.
He discards the cloth and pats his hair, trying to tame it to some semblance of submission.
?! That name‚Äôs meant for stuffy royalty, not for owls!‚Äù
"How was your weekend?" Ron forges on, pointing his finger at the almost-empty tray of Shepherd's pie. The air around the tray shimmers, triggering the ladle to rise by itself and dole out exact amounts of pie onto his plate.
‚ÄúAnd a fantastic arse! The best I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù Potter declares joyfully, before his head lolls to the side and his forehead thumps onto the table with a loud thud.
Draco puts down the parchment. "I stand by my recommendations. He will need a firm hand to guide him, but he was one of my top students last year, excelling in both theory and practical. The Auror Corps would benefit greatly from his talents and instinct." He glances at the names again. Roughly two-thirds of them are his former students. "I trust the others have not given you as much trouble?"
Draco tenses.
, the creaks of the bedsprings and the thud of the headboard hitting the wall. Noisy sex is one of Harry‚Äôs major turn-ons, and he's out of his fucking mind with this, his world narrowing down to the absolute vision of his prick slamming in and out of Malfoy, the blooming red marks on his pale arse with all of his smacking, the feel of Malfoy clenching and relaxing around him.
He runs his fingers over the frame, opens and closes the arms of the glasses. There are scratches on the arms, and he smiles at the memory of Harry nibbling at his glasses whenever he was frazzled over a case.
"Bad timing as usual, huh?" Malfoy says.
Harry reaches for his glasses and gets out of bed, heading towards his scattered clothes. "So, what now? We pretend that tonight never happened? We wake up tomorrow morning and continue to fool our friends into thinking that there's nothing between us?" he says, his dull, flat voice going muffled when he pulls his T-shirt over his head.
... and promptly heaped a second basket with more food.
"These things give you a sense of security, because they remind you of emotionally significant memories. Yes, we threw the jersey away, but you'd never forget your love for flying, your first Snitch, your first win.‚Äù Draco‚Äôs voice softens. ‚ÄúYou still fly with us, don't you?"
Malfoy puts down the photo, turning incredulous eyes on him. "Excuse me? I can't do that?" he snaps, baring his teeth. "Did you exert any self-control when you stopped my wedding? You went and did that, and I can't even say you‚Äôre selfish because you saved the bloody wizarding world!"
"Dan, you're-
Pork Chop rolls her eyes. "Yes, but I can smell your arousal. You clearly still want to mount him."
Draco's breath hitches when he spots the twin black stud earrings on Potter's left earlobe.
That knowledge is enough to make Draco feel as if someone had accidentally elbowed a switch somewhere, extinguishing a light within him.
, Draco wants to say, but what comes out from his mouth instead is a rather embarrassing noise when Potter seals his lips around the head of Draco's cock.
got caught snogging my then-boyfriend in front of their headquarters."
"Merlin, that's... that's wonderful!" A small smile forms on Malfoy's lips, before developing into a wide, genuine beam so beautiful that Harry can‚Äôt help but stare. "He's always been sweet on her, ever since fifth year. Oh, Merlin, they're getting married, that's brilliant!"
He laughs and lifts the plate high up in the air, away from Harry's reach. "You've filled out well during your training, but it's a shame you haven't grown an inch.‚Äù
It's almost second nature to Harry's body now ‚Äî the bright glaring lights, the thumping bassline of the music guiding his dancing, the sensation of pure, unadulterated
‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Harry holds the door open for Malfoy. ‚ÄúSurprise me,‚Äù he says, his lips quirking up into a playful smile and a hint of challenge in his voice. Malfoy arches a brow, looking rather amused despite himself. He walks on, and Harry falls into step beside him. They pass by Starbucks branches, fashion boutiques, hair salons and numerous eateries selling different cuisines.
"No one wants a friendly demon. It's too scary for the younger children and not scary enough for the older ones. Out of all the things I ended up creating..." Draco shakes his head.
"I like playing guitar and teaching people how to play," Potter says. "I‚Äôm teaching Dean now, in fact. Music calms me when I'm over-thinking things.‚Äù He points at the black electric guitar. ‚ÄúThat was Sirius‚Äôs. He taught me how to play. Started with the Weird Sisters, The Hobgoblins, Bent-Winged Snitches, then to Muggle bands. AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Queen. Sirius was brilliant at it. His mum hated it when he played at home, which made him practise even more." A warm, genuine smile, the proper sort that crinkles the corners of his eyes, blooms on Potter's lips, and Draco's heart lifts. ‚ÄúI can play all the chords and sight-read most tabs now, but sometimes I wish he was still around to write‚Ä¶‚Äù Potter trails off, his grin dissolving, the light in his eyes fading away, as if he's talking about something that he could never have again.
Potter suddenly stops rubbing Draco‚Äôs head and fixes him with a very serious expression.
Draco ‚Äî touch yourself right now too, just like I'm doing, make yourself feel good. If only I was there to do it for you. Touch your hard cock for me, stroke it hard and fast, just like that." Every other word is punctuated with a whine. Biting his lip, Draco increases the pace
It's not news to him, but Draco is so damn beautiful.
was...
"I would like to apologise for that day. Since I paid for you, I foolishly thought that I had to pay to have you again." Malfoy catches Harry's hand in his own. "You're not a whore, far from it. I didn't want you to leave. I wanted you to..." He glances away briefly before looking back at Harry, his fingers tightening over Harry's. "One night with you would never be enough."
Harry's face flames as he levitates the mugs and some empty trays to the sink. He's grateful that his back is facing his friends as he says, "We hate each other. I'm obviously not welcome in his shop and he's not welcome here." And that's true, because the only interactions he's had with Malfoy involve shouting and glaring matches from opposite sides of the road.
"I'd love to!" Harry exclaims with excitement, happiness playing a symphony in his heart. Relief floods Draco's features, and he beams, a smile like a shower of sparks gracing his lips and his grey eyes crinkling with happiness. Draco kisses Harry, and Harry's smile widens as Draco's soft, tender kisses melt into his skin.
He blinks in astonishment. "What the fuck.‚Äù
"Back to what? My partying and sleeping around?" Potter says, shaking away Draco‚Äôs placating hand. "Let‚Äôs get this straight, I'm not gonna stop going to clubs and bars just 'cause I'm with you. Just because you're unnecessarily jealous and insecure about shit ‚Äî I haven't done anything to deserve this, and yeah, I'm not afraid to call you out when you're being unreasonable. I'm still gonna get papped like hell when I get back, and you will see photographs of me in the clubs."
Harry slumps down in his chair and rubs his eyes.
Harry lifts his head from his arm, his stomach clenching in expectation. Adrenaline jets through his veins, lust coils tight in his belly, his muscles are rigid and his nerves are on high alert, ready to pounce. He sees his own thirst and desire mirrored in dilated grey eyes, anticipation and four years' worth of sexual tension stretched taut between them like a frayed thread just seconds away from snapping.
"Half of them can't even fit you!" Draco fixes him with a stern glare. "Have you actually worn one after Hogwarts?"
Potter comes at once with a wail.
"Who won?" Malfoy asks shakily, refusing to meet Harry's eye as they move back-stage.
"And when you thrust, oh fuck, when you thrust in my mouth I fucking lose it, Harry, I... oh,
"Off you go! What would your dull, drab love life be like without me?" Bacon says, sighing theatrically.
"We're all clean now," Harry finally whispers. They glance at the open door of the bathroom. When they leave the bathroom, it'll be time for bed, and after dawn...
Harry sighs and runs his fingers through his hair.
Malfoy and he worked surprisingly well together ‚Äî Malfoy was not afraid to argue with him for the good of the business if necessary, and he was much better at marketing and branding than George was. Although George was still the main inventor, Malfoy was able to contribute to his work, despite their different inventing styles. George liked to test spells out and go with the flow, depending on where the product and his experience led him. Malfoy was a lot more structured, preferring to read up on the theory before trying anything new.
Potter mutters a spell, conjuring lube on his hand. He reaches behind Draco‚Äôs balls. Draco stands up, and bracing his hands on Potter‚Äôs shoulders, he eagerly sinks down on one of Potter‚Äôs fingers.
"Yeah. Two months," Harry agrees, taking his hand and squeezing it. When Malfoy gives him one last lingering gaze and strides away, Harry bites his lower lip as he checks out Malfoy‚Äôs long, sexy legs and the way his shirt stretches over his shoulder blades. Harry presses the heel of his hand on his erection. He jumps when Hermione appears on his left, and Ron on his right. They watch Malfoy as he leaves, with Harry craning his neck when he turns the corner.
Ron looks at the determined furrow of Harry's brows, and goes to the Floo. Hermione frowns at Harry and places her hand on top of his. ‚ÄúHave you thought about the consequences? The negative backlash facing the Malfoys and Astoria Greengrass? It‚Äôll be splashed all over the tabloids tomorrow morning.‚Äù Hermione squeezes his hand. ‚ÄúMalfoy is so unpredictable. Do you really know the extent of his feelings for you? Stopping the wedding doesn't mean you'll get him."
"How dare you?" Greengrass hisses, jolting both men from their trance. She glowers at Harry, eyes burning with resentment and her words low and trembling. ‚ÄúWhy now? In such a public setting? You had your chance years ago.‚Äù
"Hey. How was field work?" Nowaki says, matching Harry's smile. He squeezes his hand, his beam widening when Harry returns the gesture. Harry answers, and Nowaki follows up with, "Did Ron and Hermione get back okay?"
Draco‚Äôs smirk widens at Potter‚Äôs moan of need. He gestures to Potter's trainers and clothes. "All off. I want you naked, ready and waiting when I come back. And don't you dare touch yourself without me." He wrests himself free from Potter and hurries to the kitchens.
Draco‚Äôs left arm clenches, and he moves it behind his back.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here. Sick because of me. I should be with you instead. Taking care of you.‚Äù With that, Potter places his glasses and his wand next to Draco‚Äôs own wand and homework on the bedside table. He wraps the covers snugly around them and faces Draco with unblinking eyes. ‚ÄúI want to stay the night. With you. If you‚Äôd let me.‚Äù He adds the last few words as an afterthought.
When a car honks and Potter swerves to the left without warning, Draco yelps. A rush of wind glides across his skin when the car speeds past them, much too near for Draco‚Äôs liking. He smacks Potter on the arm. "Salazar, don't get us killed! I've got an article due tomorrow, you berk!"
Draco gulps and flings off the duvet ‚Äî suddenly it's way too hot in here. He trails his hands down his body, letting a finger graze the waistband of his pants before yanking that off. There's no time for teasing, Harry's already wanking and he doesn't want to miss a second of it. Draco wraps a hand around his hardening cock. The thought of Harry wanking to him and recording it in his sex voice while Draco was upstairs sleeping in Harry's bed after they just had sex...
Fuck, that sounds even better.
"We'll be visiting Ronald Weasley's family next." The Aurors stand up and incline their heads in sympathy. "The Ministry sends its condolences. We'll see ourselves out."
Draco squints up at the charcoal sky and sighs at the weary grey clouds. In the horizon, lightning rattles the sky, and Draco flinches, steeling himself for the incoming clap of thunder.
"I think we've waited long enough, haven't we?" Potter whispers against Draco's skin, his voice low and rough, eyes half-lidded and teeth nipping at Draco's neck. His tongue held between his teeth, Potter's lips tug up into a smirk, lazy and infuriatingly confident. He uses his other hand to pull off his glasses, tossing them down onto the coffee table with a flourish.
With that, the recorder clicks off.
, he's ripped them from under the mattress, but he's not done, his arm swipes out to tip the dresser right over, the lamp crashing down to the floor, along with the dresser, with Draco fucking Harry to total obliteration the entire time.
"If you don't hold the umbrella yourself, I'll have to escort you home," Malfoy murmurs, his voice husky. He takes a step closer. "I don't mind, you know."
He bursts out into the streets, blending with the crowds outside. With no destination in mind, he breaks into a fast-paced stride. He clenches his fists, nails digging into his palms in disappointment and agitation.
Malfoy stands beside her, tall and equally striking.
while Hermione will shake her head, purse her lips and look at him with disappointment.
He frowns and banishes his doubt.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been years, and time has only made me want you even more.‚Äù Harry cradles Malfoy‚Äôs flushed face in his hands, his thumbs caressing his cheekbones, and his voice steady and sure. ‚ÄúYou fit so perfectly in my arms, and you get me so hard‚Äî‚Äú
He stays very still for a moment.
Memories from last night filter back into his consciousness, a tapestry of pornographic images and Malfoy's heavenly sounds looping in his mind. He flings an arm out; he‚Äôs alone in bed. Harry rolls over and flops his face into Malfoy‚Äôs pillow, breathing in the scent of vanilla, just to make sure that this isn't a dream, that he's really in Malfoy's bed after having shagged him silly.
He turns to Hermione. "I love you, love you so much," he says, repeating the words between sobs. Her entire body sags, her cries increasing in intensity and volume. Hermione mumbles something that Harry can't catch. She leans her head on Ron‚Äôs shoulder, her hand clasped around his arm.
She closes the clasp of her bag and draws in a deep breath. "That's why I gave you that address." She stands up, and Harry sees her out.
"Yeah. I'm kinda hungry."
and all. I was wearing my apron, so how could he see under that?" He powers on while Theo makes appropriately soothing noises. "And he was talking to Weasley really loudly the other day, as if he wanted my attention, and when I looked at him, he kept touching his hair while leaning over the counter, and his elbow tipped over the entire pot of chicken soup!"
Harry grins at his friends, and grabs the crisps as he puts his feet up on the coffee table. He indicates the telly with his chin. "What're we watching then?"
"You make me want to fall in love," Draco murmurs, kissing his forehead.
"What we gon' do 'bout it?" Harry slurs and begins to nibble, leaving a winding path of blooming love bites on pale skin.
A seven-year-old Harry James Potter was cleaning the yard. His cousin was in school, a place he wasn't allowed to go to. His uncle was at work, where he would be working hard. His Aunt Petunia would be watching on her telly. Harry was busy cleaning the yard. Mowing, de-weeding, planting, watering. Harry worked as diligently as he could for the care of his aunt's yard. He knew how much his aunt cared for her yard. He knew how she showed it off to their neighbors. How they fawned over the work Harry had done. It pleased Harry, despite him knowing in the back of his mind that the neighbors will never know that it was Harry's work, not Aunt Petunia's.
To my son,
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
"To Snape, I want to apologize for the way I treated you long ago during Hogwarts. It was wrong for me as a man to do that to you. You didn't deserve it. I know that apologies may never be enough, but please know that I am sincerely sorry for what I've done to you, with Sirius, Remus, and Peter."
"Look at me." Harry gulped and looked at the man once more. It was then he noticed his onyx eyes. They were as black as his dark cupboard. But this black held anger. Harry resisted the urge to crawl into his cupboard.
"Ravenclaw isn't that bad, you know!" Draco couldn't help but sneer at Hermione. Hermione at least blushed and spluttered apologies and started saying maybe Ravenclaw wouldn't be that bad all. Draco gave her a smirk in return. Harry thought it would be a good time to talk, ruining Draco's gloating over Hermione.
Harry gripped Draco‚Äôs jaw and pressed his head back to the wall. "Open for me."
"Good question," Charlie said, though really it was getting a little hard to talk right now, given the heat coiling at the base of his spine. "He‚Äôs a pretty accommodating pet. Competitive too‚Äîyou bring in another sub to do something for you and you can bet he‚Äôll match it if he can. If he can‚Äôt, of course, then it‚Äôs the same as for him. You can find someone else to do it or you can let it go. You‚Äôll have to negotiate on that as it comes up." A marvelously perfect lick went up from balls to tip, making him grunt out loud. Draco, reminding him that he was perfectly sure he could meet Harry‚Äôs needs.
. The one thing he‚Äôd always wanted in bed was on offer tonight and he‚Äôd been kept late by sodding paperwork.
"It has never been cleaner," Draco answered honestly. "It will never be cleaner. That bastard basically made me deep throat your liquid soap dispenser. If you want to kill him, I‚Äôll help you hide the body."
Harry pulled off. Draco cried out and couldn‚Äôt hold back a sudden thrust forward but he didn‚Äôt come.  Harry licked his lips.
Draco bucked, realizing what was about to happen. It didn‚Äôt help. Harry had his cock on target already and Draco‚Äôs hole opened as trained. He screwed in deeper, pushing the silk in with his cock, fucking Draco with his shift as well.
He pulled out all the way, enjoying the sight of the silk still obscenely fucked up Draco‚Äôs hole. He played there a while, teasing the rim, dropping down to lick and suck him there until the wail turned into a sob.
He seized Draco‚Äôs cock and stripped it ruthlessly, while working his softening cock in Draco‚Äôs hole, stimulating him, letting him feel the come dripping shamefully out.
Draco dropped to his knees at once and crawled over, not meeting Potter‚Äôs eyes. At least Charlie kept his rooms well-supplied with rugs. It was only his pride that hurt, not his kneecaps.
"There are different types of devices. This one here is meant more for training than punishment, for example." Charlie picked up a curved rubber clip after the table was decently covered with representative sample of Draco‚Äôs stupid sub-conscious‚Äôs wants. "This one goes on the end of the tongue." Charlie tapped his finger on Draco‚Äôs lips and Draco opened at once.
Charlie laughed. "Fair to say he likes the taste of you. Need to hear you say it though, pet. You attracted to our fine Auror here? You like his cock tickling your tonsils? You like him balls-deep in your arse?"
"It‚Äôs for control. Of course. It‚Äôs charmed. I can‚Äôt take it off or even pull it up over my cock and arse." Draco sighed, clearly knowing what Harry wanted next. He pulled the shift up and sure enough, as it rose it tangled around Draco‚Äôs cock, outlining it in silky white. On his backside it was the same, clinging to his arse, not rising higher than the crease of his bum.
Draco sobbed harder. "I‚Äôll please you. Just give me a cock ring."
"Come on now, let‚Äôs get you down," Charlie said. The cane dropped from his hand. "You‚Äôve been so good."
He was. Draco felt a push at his lips and opened them automatically, letting Harry‚Äôs cock glide in. It slid across his slippery tongue and Harry groaned, deep and heartfelt.
"In case you‚Äôre wondering, Draco‚Äôs father is stable. We‚Äôre lucky there was a Healer present,‚Äù Greengrass says briskly. At Harry‚Äôs nod, she continues. ‚ÄúPansy told me you're staying with your friends.‚Äù She opens her handbag, pulling out a small card. She looks at it, her upper lip caught between her teeth. Indecisive, she glances at Harry, and then at the card.
Harry sends a dark glare at the innocuous black umbrella folded up in a corner.
Draco jumps up and paws desperately at Potter's Auror uniform. "You haven't fucked me in this yet."
Ron jumps up from the table so suddenly that his chair topples over, and Hermione closes her textbook with a loud thump.
"Why?" Harry remarks in alarm. "Is he seeing someone?"
"Need your cock in me. Need you to fuck me. Gotta fuck me like you've never fucked anyone before."
Potter's skin is stitched with golden sunlight, keeping Draco warm and chasing away all of his demons.
"Should I apologise for my size?" Draco says, mouthing at Potter's neck.
"You infuriate me to no end, Potter," Malfoy declares as they walk out the door into the cool night air.
." Draco knows he's clutching at straws, but when you've fancied someone for so long and with such intensity... He flushes when he recalls how Potter had seen him dance to Led Zeppelin and his throwaway sentence about the band right before he left. The entire incident was highly embarrassing and rather surreal, but that was the first time that they had a civil conversation, and he had gone to bed feeling rather pleased that night.
"Harry?" he whispers, moving deeper into the small clearing surrounded by trees. He's sure he heard something around here, but there are no other footprints in the snow. He stays still for a moment, his senses on high alert.
He's read all of Sin's reviews and seen photos of the desserts, of course, but having them right in front of him is a different thing altogether ‚Äî he's amazed and if he's honest with himself, just a little bit envious that Malfoy can turn out such fancy-looking treats. He went to a culinary school in Muggle France, Harry recalls their stilted conversation as he lifts the warm treacle tart to his lips. Once again, those same intriguing questions about Malfoy's recent past invade his mind.
"Don't you wanna come, Harry?" Draco's voice is so damn tempting, low and intimate.
Draco briefly presses a finger to Potter‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúYou want me?‚Äù he asks in a purr.
He grasps both of Harry's ankles and slams himself into him.
And Draco will give it to him, with all the pleasure in the world.
"-and cocks harder," Draco pulls Potter in for another searing kiss.
‚Äú‚Äîyou sure as hell don't seem to care when I make an effort!"
To which Potter had replied in a rather strained voice, "Trust me, Parvati. We've got
"He's kept his head down and his nose clean, yeah? Second chances and all that," Ron says.
"Hey." Malfoy gives him a little shake, and Harry tilts his head up, peering at him. "What would you like to do on a date?"
Potter twists his upper body around to slant a look at Draco. The tops of his cheeks rise‚Äîhe must be grinning under his helmet. He mutters something that Draco can't catch. Before he can ask Potter to repeat it, Potter guns the engine. The bike surges forward, and Draco starts at the roar. His arms are suddenly wrapped around Potter‚Äôs waist as they rumble away from Skinshifters and merge into the main lanes, weaving in between cars and lorries.
Potter ducks his head and rubs the back of his neck. "You were huffing a lot and typing so hard that I thought your keys would pop out. And you drank so much coffee. But that's not the point. C'mon, it‚Äôll be fun." He shrugs and adds lightly, a tinge of challenge hardening his voice, "Unless you're too old for a joyride."
It's as if Potter has erased the Black history from the face of Grimmauld Place, something that is both unsettling and of relief to Draco.
Merlin, these bloody Gryffindors.
float in his mind.
And so, the red thread of fate twined between their fingers, worn thin and faded to a light pink, stretches just that little bit more.
"The Malfoy ring, inherited from centuries of generations." Draco runs a thumb over the ornate family crest and reptilian creatures carved on it. "There's a ceremony that every Malfoy heir experiences at eighteen, when his father would officially pass down heirlooms like this, along with a formal letter detailing the heir‚Äôs responsibilities." His lips pull up in a bland smile devoid of mirth. "A pity my father wasn't alive for my eighteenth birthday."
Both Parvati and Harry groan at his pun as they pack up their things and shuffle out of the room, Bacon slithering beside Harry.
Harry's cock stirs.
He mutters apologies and
"You cook?!"
Draco‚Äôs resigned himself to seeing and kissing Harry only in his wildest dreams, but yet here he is, standing right in front of him, close enough to touch.
Four years later, and Malfoy is still the knot in his heart that he's trying to untangle.
‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Harry‚Äôs heartbeat quickens at the flirtatious lilt in Malfoy‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúShall we go to the game together, then? The one that Ron gave you tickets for.‚Äù
‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶‚Äù
It hadn't been all smooth-sailing though ‚Äî they had run into Draco's ex-boyfriend in a very busy square in Muggle Paris and he was foolish enough to flirt with Draco right under Harry's nose. Harry's Jealous Chest Monster had sat up and roared then and there, he saw red, so he had done the next most logical thing at the time.
"You talk too damn much," Harry mumbles and promptly covers Draco's mouth with his own. They snog for a while, heads tilted and eyes closed, their kisses and the grinding of their hips slow and luxurious. Draco slides his hands down Harry's shoulders, down his upper arms, squeezing his biceps on the way before returning them to his shoulder blades, drawing him even closer. Harry pulls away to nip at Draco's bottom lip, stilling his hips to grab Draco's cock, slick with pre-come.
"Um," Harry falters, his blush deepening. He motions to Malfoy to get off him, and he does so, curling his body around Harry and nuzzling into him like before. "I kinda have a thing for... er... semi-public sex. We were in a park at night and partially hidden by a tree. He wasn't really good at it, to be honest, but the fact that we could get caught..."
‚ÄúThat sounds absurdly advanced. I don‚Äôt think I can do that.‚Äù
"I didn't know you've been admiring me so much from a distance," Harry says coyly and closes the distance between them on the sofa. "I've been watching you too, you know."
‚ÄúDraco, gonna‚Äî‚Äú That‚Äôs all Harry can manage before he comes so hard, the stars in the night sky blurring, his fingers pressing into Malfoy‚Äôs arse-cheeks, his hips thrusting as he shoots his load into Malfoy‚Äôs mouth. There‚Äôs a faint gasp and a few thick gulps, before Malfoy releases his prick and rolls away.
"But you can't wait. You‚Äôre so impatient."
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù Marjorie says, her face falling.
There's the sudden twang of a guitar, and he turns towards Malfoy's flat.
"But‚Ä¶ but you didn't kiss back."
Harry's brain stutters to a stop.
and blissed-out expression as he looks down at Draco with such unbridled lust that if Draco was wanking, he would've come at once.
‚ÄúYou sing really well,‚Äù he says.
They make their way to the river. Draco rests his elbows on the railing, a small and content smile forming on his lips as he soaks in the sprawling sights. The iconic Tower Bridge glimmers in all its resplendent glory, and the rippling surface of the river is rich with the reflected colours of the London Eye and other attractions. The gentle lapping of the waters along the riverbanks is soothing and calm, and Draco firmly shoves his upcoming article deadlines to the back of his mind.
Potter looked relieved. "Good. So, er, I should just take him to the bathroom and clean him up?"
"I do, sometimes. Sometimes he tells me to wear this. It depends."
Draco was making sounds of his own, wordless and wild. Harry‚Äôs eyes opened and he smiled with sweet malice as he stroked his hand down to Draco‚Äôs belly.
it said,
"What‚Äôs that?" Potter leaned in to look.
The thought of that evidently put Malfoy in a better mood. He relaxed against the wall and smiled. "Quite the miracle worker still, aren‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm amazed you got all that done and still made it here."
Charlie reached back and grabbed the head attached to the tongue that was talking in his ear. "Fred. So glad you could make it."
He‚Äôd told himself it was obvious that the sex slave ones belonged to Voldemort. Harry was the good guy, so the nice, girl-oriented ones were his. Right. So as soon as he killed that snake-headed bastard, he‚Äôd be a completely normal heterosexual man. Meat and potatoes, white-bread missionary position sex, just like Ron.
"Look at me, pet," Charlie commanded.
Harry‚Äôs head tipped back, mouth falling open. "Yeah? Could I watch?"
Harry came with a cry, screwing himself deep, watching Draco‚Äôs hole stretched by his thick cock. He could feel the silk twisted around his cock, soaking in the come. Draco tensed in pained anticipation.
. I‚Äôve done enough interrogations to know the difference."
Charlie tightened his fist, just like he was squeezing a piece of fruit. The gossamer contracted, suddenly painfully tight. Draco yelped, but as fast as the sensation had come, the harness relaxed again, in time with Charlie‚Äôs fist.
Harry‚Äôs heart jumped. It had taken a week to work out the details of Draco‚Äôs new contract and he‚Äôd had a terrible fear it would somehow fall through at the last moment. Charlie had been careful, though, talking to each of them both separately and together, making sure that every point was well-negotiated and mutually acceptable. No sex this week. Just talking.
The deepest, most honest part of himself admitted he bloody loved the thought.
will have a field day with it." Charlie felt Draco jerk and when he looked down Draco‚Äôs eyes had gotten possibly a little teary. Harry wanted him and he wanted the world to know it. That had to mean the world to Draco. "You ready to come out?"
Finally Harry stopped, surveyed his work, and announced that he had cleaned every surface. His grip was still firm on Draco‚Äôs chin, mercifully preventing the nose pulls he would otherwise have suffered.
"Gillyweed?" Harry looked puzzled. "What would I want with that?"
He pulled on his jeans and threw on the nearest clean shirt he could find. After all, it didn‚Äôt matter what he wore, he realized with a ferocious grin. It wasn‚Äôt like the bloke he was going to fuck tonight could say no. Harry didn‚Äôt have to wine and dine him and wonder if he‚Äôd put out. He‚Äôd get fucked exactly the way Harry wanted to fuck him and he‚Äôd say thank you for it afterwards.
Oh. Potter was afraid that Draco didn‚Äôt want him but wouldn‚Äôt say so in front of Charlie. It warmed him with a sudden heat that started in his belly, that Potter cared enough to make completely sure. "I want you," hoping his voice didn‚Äôt crack. "I promise."
A shock ran through Harry. He didn‚Äôt want to admit it, but it was true. He
Draco shuffled back and kneeled where they could both see him, putting his hands behind his neck so nothing could be hidden. His face was red‚Äîembarrassment this time‚Äîbut his cock couldn‚Äôt have been stiffer.
Oh, fuck. Draco sucked in a sudden hitching breath. Not a stranger.  His bollocks shrank and tightened all at the same time, not sure if they wanted to get away or get right to it.
"Push into it," Potter whispered in his ear. "Go on, help me bring you down. I know it‚Äôs cold but it‚Äôll take the ache away. First your cock then your bollocks."
Harry shifted nervously. Charlie projected his best air of mild curiosity, thoroughly enjoying this. It wasn‚Äôt often he had the chance to make a fellow top sweat.
a small metal device from the drawer.
Charlie tightened his legs around Draco, making sure he felt the warmth and the support before he asked the next question. "And the Malfoy part?
They came down slowly, holding each other. Finally, Harry‚Äôs eyes focused and he stared with glee at the evidence of Draco‚Äôs loss of control.
"Good?" Harry asked, a little worried.
Draco swallowed hard and closed his eyes, his face turned to one side, cheek pressed to the wood.
Perfect.
"Of course," Draco said, showing he could play at butter-won‚Äôt-melt-in-my-mouth too. "Wouldn‚Äôt want to keep you here late tonight. I was hoping to get to bed early as well, if you must know."
Potter sank down, steadying himself with a hand in Draco‚Äôs hair, taking the place of Charlie‚Äôs. He leaned forward and whispered in Draco‚Äôs ear. "Come on. You can do it. It would please me so much if you did."
"Do you want to reward him?"
"Potter," Malfoy said. "I need these by tonight."
Would have been a damn sight more exciting if they were, though. He indulged in a quick mental image of a Hebridean Black chomping down Fudge et entourage. Bet they could have charged anything they liked if that‚Äôd been the entertainment.
"What‚Äôs this white stripe?" Potter asked, tracing a line from buttock to buttock. "Did you mean to leave a nice unspanked line right across the middle of his arse? Is it for contrast?"
Potter blanched. His Auror robes were horribly wrinkled and there was a stain on the right sleeve which might have been tea and might have been blood. "Malfoy," he groaned. "I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm busy tonight. I‚Äôve got a," he waved his arms, "a thing."
Potter just laughed. He stood up and turned to the sink, seizing a couple of things then squatting back down again in front of Draco. "Here we go. I‚Äôve got what we need. Open your mouth and stick your tongue out for me."
a collar‚Äîa sight that made Harry go
"What‚Äôs this for?" Harry smoothed a hand down Draco‚Äôs front, fingering the shift. "You haven‚Äôt told me yet."
The first pulse shot straight down his throat and Harry cried out, hands holding Draco‚Äôs head so tight it hurt, making sure he controlled the angle to perfection. He pulled back with the second spurt, making sure he came all over Draco‚Äôs tongue, making sure the taste of Harry would mingle with the soap, and drip together down his throat. Then another thick spurt as Harry rubbed himself shamelessly on Draco‚Äôs tongue, shuddering out the end of his pleasure, helpless now that orgasm was on him.
"Well that‚Äôs lovely and all but the important thing," Fred said seriously, grabbing at a plate of canapes that was going by, "is this: do you think Harry‚Äôll rent Malfoy out to us like you do? Terrible timing, we just perfected that polyjuice tweak. Instead of turning you into someone else, it turns you into what you‚Äôd look like if you‚Äôd been born the other sex."
"Of course." Potter let out a shaky sigh. "You deserve honesty. I do want it. I want to see your face when the cane hits and I want to kiss you while you twist and cry. I‚Äôm sorry but I do."
"Mind now, he‚Äôs a high maintenance little beast. He‚Äôll probably revolt if he doesn‚Äôt get his fair share of cabernet and caviar." Charlie shrugged. "Just so you know. If you want a cheap pet, he‚Äôs not the one."
Draco smoothed down his elegant grey barrister‚Äôs robes. Contrary to popular opinion, he hadn‚Äôt chosen his profession because the colour flattered his eyes. It was merely a side benefit. "Whatever, Potter. Have it on my desk ASAP or we‚Äôll have to let the nutter go."
Draco shrugged to himself, slid off the desk, and sauntered away. Potter‚Äôs idea of a secret was probably one pint too many followed by a tit grope. An outside-the-jumper tit grope at that. How the other half lived‚Äîif you called that living‚Äîit was a mystery to him.
Draco let his head drop and braced as best he could.
"Harry!" Charlie stood up, casting a smirk Draco‚Äôs way. "Glad you made it."
"Next, the contract stipulates that nothing happens which would interfere with either of our jobs. No requiring anything‚Äîon either of our parts‚Äîwhich would negatively impact work. Also, no revealing details to people who aren‚Äôt both trustworthy and equally deep into this. Etcetera."
"Who‚Äôs the Welsh Green‚Äî"
"True," Harry said mildly, raising his eyes to Draco‚Äôs. "I‚Äôve given him inch after inch and he just keeps wanting more."
Not that it mattered if Potter was perfect for him. It didn‚Äôt mean he was perfect for Potter or that the Chosen One would want a dark-marked ex-rotter like him. Plus, this was practically Potter‚Äôs first experience with these things. He‚Äôd want to look around, find some shining specimen of manhood without a painful past. Though Potter had to have seen the faded mark on his arm in the bathroom and he hadn‚Äôt made an issue of it‚Äî
"You‚Äôre hard as a rock, you know that right?" Harry said with a little smile as he pushed the swab all the way back, waiting for the gag, holding Draco‚Äôs head tight through it. "Good boy, by the way. You‚Äôre doing wonderfully. Nearly done with the tongue."
"Over there. Second door in the hallway," Charlie said. "Draco knows where it is, of course, but don‚Äôt let him lead the way. He has to follow when he‚Äôs leashed."
Draco obediently went back to Harry, crawling this time, his mouth wet and swollen.
Harry tapped Draco‚Äôs head before his face could shade from red to purple. Draco moved immediately into bobbing up and down, giving a nice smooth ride to a cock made shiny with his spit.
Charlie looked concerned. If Draco wasn‚Äôt a good boy‚Äîand he was, damn it‚Äîhe would have pulled away, tottered over, and collapsed at Charlie‚Äôs feet. Put his head on Charlie‚Äôs knee and let that rough hand soothe the sting away.
"Charmed ball harness." Charlie grabbed Draco‚Äôs sack, pulling it forward with a practiced hand. "Tightens at a gesture. Excellent control device." He stuffed Draco‚Äôs bollocks into it one by one, ignoring his muffled meep of protest. "General principle we use at work--no matter how tame you think they are, don‚Äôt move them around without some kind of leash."
The hands left him and silence fell, as if they both stepped back to appreciate his utter helplessness. Then Charlie‚Äôs hand slapped his arse, in that friendly-hard way of his, and he came round to the front of the block.
"I didn‚Äôt exactly have time to go home and get changed." Harry kept his tone polite with tremendous effort. "I got kept late at the office. Paperwork."
"Yeah, you are," Charlie said, and bugger, Draco wished that he could see. "Nine inches is it? Pretty thick around too. Nice." His hand rubbed circles on Draco‚Äôs blistered arse. "Don‚Äôt worry about it. He‚Äôs a perfect little slut. He can take it."
"It wasn‚Äôt?" Malfoy looked uncertain. It moved his face in unfamiliar ways. "That‚Äôs certainly the impression you left me with."
Draco shifted on the floor, knees aching. His posture was perfect‚Äîas always‚Äîback straight, legs wide, bollocks dangling, hands clasped behind his back. "He‚Äôs late. Your mystery guest has no manners, you know that?"
Charlie shook his head. "Nope, though I have plenty of those, some for fun, some for control, some for the odd spot of nipple torture." He took the ringed clip back. "This one goes here."
Harry pushed back his chair. If he had to fill out one more form, he‚Äôd stab himself in the eyeball with a quill. Vigilante justice was starting to look better and better as a career option. Superheroes never had to file in triplicate.
"Nearly there, you‚Äôre so good, see you can take it."
Harry grinned. "Only to the first knuckle." He rolled closer, pressing himself to Draco‚Äôs back and wrapping an arm around him. A thrill went through him at the touch, running from his spine all the way down to his toes, which curled.
Potter‚Äôs hand shot up and he chucked Draco‚Äôs chin, then brushed the tear away. "Sorry, Malfoy. Didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you. Wait," he said, turning to Charlie, "is it all right to apologize to a slave? That‚Äôs not bad form, is it?"
"That‚Äôs something you‚Äôd have to learn too. What to use, when to use it, how long, how hard. If I was going to sell." Charlie beckoned Draco over. Watching that suck had gotten him up too. He could use a little of that.
Harry‚Äôs heart leaped. He didn‚Äôt waste a minute, getting under the covers before Charlie‚Äôd even got his
Drool began to gather, trickling out of his mouth and over the rubber. Draco flicked his eyes up but he couldn‚Äôt see Potter‚Äôs face from this position. He could see his crotch, however, and judging by the massive bulge, Potter was both completely aware of what he was doing and also, frankly, hung.
"What? I believe in Benefiting British Dragons." Right, ok, he was really going because Malfoy was going to be there. All week he‚Äôd tried to talk to the git, but all he got was glares and brush-offs.
Fuck. He couldn‚Äôt. Potter‚Äôs feet? Potter‚Äôs ratty trainers? Panic surged inside him. He really actually couldn‚Äôt do this. It was too much. This was humiliation times a thousand, every teenage fear‚Äîand fantasy, let‚Äôs face it‚Äîcome to life. He could barely stand Charlie knowing what he craved, let alone Potter.
The floo spat a final time and belched the stranger out.
Potter‚Äôs mouth, Potter‚Äôs tongue. His hand wrapped the back of Draco‚Äôs head, keeping him in place as Potter raped his mouth.  The blows never eased for a moment and he was crying now and babbling
"But he tried so hard," Harry said with a sympathy that didn‚Äôt quite hide his delight. "Still, it‚Äôs so important to be firm, especially at the beginning. I wouldn‚Äôt want to spoil him."
Draco‚Äôs head hung down. His tongue swiped out to clean his lips but he couldn‚Äôt even look up, let alone protest.
Harry snorted and turned Draco around, putting that arse in the air right in front of his cock. "While I‚Äôm here. I see your point, Weasley, don‚Äôt worry." He slicked his cock with a little wandless wave and paused, the bell-end dimpling Draco‚Äôs hole, not fucking in yet. He screwed up his face, looked pained, but named a lower price.
The worst part was that the flaming-bastard-sod didn‚Äôt go home right away. Instead Potter cocooned the two of them together, even wriggling his shirt off and pressing his finally naked chest to Draco‚Äôs back while he chatted away with Charlie. It was a consolation prize, Draco guessed, and he hated it for that.
Draco visibly pouted, which was an impressive thing to be able to convey while your mouth was being comprehensively fucked. Not back to that damn kibble again, his posture said.
"But you don‚Äôt mind me fucking you? I need to know. Do you want me to fuck you?"
"Malfoy," he said when he‚Äôd wormed his way to the blighter‚Äôs side. "We‚Äôre going to talk. Now."
Harry made the sign and squeezed. Draco yelped again as the harness shrank to a hard clutch on his bollocks, releasing only at the next gesture from Potter.
He shuddered with relief. It was, paradoxically, so much easier to take his beating this way. The other, over Charlie‚Äôs lap, just lying there and taking it--enjoying it‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt bear to be so pitiful in front of Potter. There was no question now of being able to get away. No voice that sounded like Father yelling in the back of his mind, telling him to stand up and sneer and posture and deny, deny, deny that he wanted any part of this.
If Charlie noticed, he didn‚Äôt say anything. He rubbed the tip of his cock on Draco‚Äôs lips, casually and wordlessly getting Draco‚Äôs tongue out, mouth wide. Charlie didn‚Äôt thrust in though, just kept himself right outside, wanking hard. He came fast with a heavy grunt and pearly come shot out across Draco‚Äôs tongue and deep into the back of his throat.
"Oh," said Potter as he took in the hosing area as well as the more normal shower etcetera. His eyes lingered on the rings set into the walls at a variety of convenient heights and locations. "Those are for hitching, I suppose?"
Harry nodded. "Thank you for trusting me with this, by the way."
"May I?"
He grabbed his wand and did a quiet
"That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt let you come. If I had to spend the rest of my life with the emotional equivalent of blue balls, I thought you deserved a night with actual ones." Harry moved his hand to the other nipple and tweaked that too, watching the first stay stiff with desire. "Plus, all right, it was really hot. I loved that part of it too. Does Charlie really put you in chastity?"
Draco sobbed through the gagging sensation, feeling snot dribble from his nose. Harry noticed too, took a different swab, and gently wiped it off. Then he took another and rubbed it across the base of the clamp, hesitated, then kept going, running it all the way up the length of the clamp inside Draco‚Äôs nose. Draco tensed but it didn‚Äôt hurt‚Äîit was more the invasion, the helplessness of it. That familiar feeling of warm submission swelled in him as Harry pulled the swab back down then up proceeded up the other nostril, lingering there, drinking in the emotion on his face.
"Oh, too bad," Charlie said, meeting Harry‚Äôs gaze with equal pleasure. He came over and scooped up a thick dollop of Draco‚Äôs come. He pushed two thick fingers into Draco‚Äôs mouth. Draco went shame-faced but he licked them quite clean. "Poor boy‚Äôs earned a punishment."
"Here we go," Harry said cheerfully and rubbed it across the middle of Draco‚Äôs tongue. Suds were starting to form and the taste intensified‚Äîbitter detergent overlaid with scenty lavender. Harry dipped again and swiped a heavy glob again onto the middle then pushed it further and further back, laving at the back of the tongue.
, but his heart was already dropping at the thought that he‚Äôd be on the other side of Charlie all night. That wasn‚Äôt what he‚Äôd hoped for.
Draco pressed his lips to Charlie‚Äôs bollocks in the required waiting position and wondered idly which Father would hate more‚Äîthe amount of time Draco spent sucking Weasley cock or the amount of time he spent with his face pressed to Muggle denim. Though both probably paled before bowing and scraping to Harry Fucking Potter, so he‚Äôd probably hit a new aneurysm-inducing low tonight, if Father ever found out.
The floo crackled green. Excitement twisted in Draco‚Äôs stomach, along with a curdle of anxiety. Charlie was offering him to a friend tonight. Someone Charlie was going to teach how to top, with all their lessons played out on Draco‚Äôs flesh. A stranger who was going to fondle Draco‚Äôs bollocks and fuck his face and plow his arse, all while Charlie patiently explained how to use a slave like him.
Good. Draco wanted this. This was a delicate matter, and it was his responsibility to make sure Draco was well cared for.
Potter licked his lips and pulled gently on the leash, stepping backwards. "Where?" he asked, looking around.
. "That is, I mean, thanks for inviting me. You didn‚Äôt have to and I‚Äôm sure you would have had fun just the two of you‚Äî"
Where would a Malfoy be? There. Harry spotted a knot of well-dressed people and eager waiters and the flash of photographers. He strode in that direction.
Then the shock came, punishingly hard, crueler still for being so deep inside him. Draco‚Äôs arse spasmed and the sound that came out of his mouth was nearly a shriek. He clamped down on Harry‚Äôs cock, involuntarily, speared on his length, shaking and groaning, arching in pleasure mixed with pain. The shocks kept coming, smaller after the first, but Harry could feel each one as Draco‚Äôs hole tried desperately to close, milking his cock instead.
Draco‚Äôs hips began to thrust up. Not far‚Äîhis bollocks were clamped too low for that. Each thrust ended with a hiss and but his head was tipping further back now, rocking in time with Harry‚Äôs strokes, and his eyes were closed in bliss.
He hauled Draco back, impaling him, yanking him taut against his chest. "You‚Äôre mine now, you hear? I fucking
Wait. Charlie was moving him? One minute he was over Charlie‚Äôs lap the next Charlie was manhandling him into the air, settling him on the table, now cleared of toys.
He moved into Draco‚Äôs space and Draco willed himself not to step back. He really, really hated this little thing. Charlie knew it too‚Äîhe wrapped a thick hand around the back of Draco‚Äôs neck and lifted the clip so fast Draco couldn‚Äôt have reacted if he wanted to. It went up into his nose before he could so much as protest and his eyes watered hard at the sudden pain in such a sensitive place. Then the clip snapped in, pinching the tender septum. The ring hung down, swaying just above his upper lip, and Charlie clicked his lead onto it and moved back. Crap, crap, crap. This was bad.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Harry wanted him all over again. It would be easy to lube Draco up in this position, with his arsehole so exposed. To open up his hole and ream him without mercy.
"Here," Charlie said, tapping his right arse cheek with the signal that sent Draco straight into his standing position: legs wide, shoulders back, arms up and crossed parallel just below his shoulder-blades. "Go on and take him into the bathroom. Get that mouth washed out before we use it. You handle him just fine."
"No," said Harry. He increased the lubrication and pressed in, opening Draco up. "No interest in being called that either. There‚Äôs only one way I want you to address me. If you figure it out, I‚Äôll leave your cock alone for at least five minutes. Promise"
Charlie‚Äôs eyes strayed across the ballroom to where Remus and Tonks were sharing a smile. "Oh, I‚Äôve been approached about something fun. Nice mature couple looking to share a sweet young thing. Want some training done, looking forward to helping them out."
Just as well, though. The quiet ones could be harder in the end. They‚Äôd take what you gave them and never give a whisper back that they weren‚Äôt getting what they needed until it all ended in a massive row. No chance of that with Draco. If he needed a good rough face-fuck, he‚Äôd snap his own handcuffs on and have your cock down his throat practically before you got through the door.
Potter flushed. "Never mind. It doesn‚Äôt matter." He grabbed the file. "I‚Äôll get it done."
"And the natural world thanks you for your generosity." Charlie ruffled their heads. "I saw the check. This whole benefit would have been a success even if no one else gave a sickle."
And he was going to meet one of them tonight. He squeezed his bollocks through his jeans, willing some self-control, threw powder in the floo and called out the address.
"Fucking Auror," Draco managed, slurring a little with his newly thick tongue. "You didn‚Äôt have to be this thorough."
Charlie took pity on him when it appeared that was all Harry could stutter out for the moment. "A business transaction, you said?" A little pity, maybe. He couldn‚Äôt help going on with, "if it‚Äôs a pet you‚Äôre after, it‚Äôs true that miniature Welsh greens have been approved for private ownership. Loyal and loving, they are. Are you wanting me to set you up with a reputable breeder?"
Or maybe it was worse than that. Was it his past? Did Potter think he was good enough for an unfeeling screw but didn‚Äôt deserve a caring hand in return? Had it been a hate fuck, a long time in the making?
"What about Draco, though?" Harry frowned, looking concerned. "He‚Äôs going to get a lot of nasty mail too. Is that going to be too rough? I know he‚Äôs worked hard to put the past behind him."
The trainer moved toward him. Potter‚Äôs foot nudged his face. Prat. Draco would have guessed Potter would back off. Run away at the first hint of real domination. Instead he was moving into the scene.
"There," Potter said with satisfaction. "Now let‚Äôs clean that filthy mouth of yours."
Draco opened his mouth and put his tongue back out. Harry scooped up more soap, methodically spreading it down the right side of the tongue, then the left. He let Draco pull his tongue back in and rest a moment when he needed, though each time he closed his mouth the bubbles increased, until they were spilling out down his chin. Then Harry returned to the back of the tongue, layering the soap on carefully in an even coating,
Harry bit his lip but dropped to his knees and sucked Draco in without another word. He worked Draco‚Äôs cock ruthlessly, stripping away every sticky trace with pleasure. The taste was just fine, evidently.
Harry scrubbed a bit, then finally pulled the shift off, taking it gently from Draco‚Äôs mouth and checking that the job had been well done. Then with flesh now bared, he scrubbed Draco‚Äôs back, slow and thorough, soaping down his sides, massaging each muscle and washing the soap away. Down the legs with their fine golden hair, then up again, taking his time, trying to repay the gift that Draco given him.
