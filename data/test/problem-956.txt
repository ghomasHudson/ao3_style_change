Suffused with a sudden burst of bashfulness, Draco wraps his arms around Harry's neck, mumbling about impropriety. And then one hand is trailing curiously down Harry's front. Harry has taken to wearing muggle clothing while he teaches. It's simply easier to work with, especially with a discipline so physical as DADA.
Harry smiles, and opens his door, beckoning him inside. Grimmauld always seems to ripple with acceptance when Draco stops by, for need of a better word. Something about old family magic. Most old wizarding families are related in some way--Harry’s sure he and Draco share some ridiculously named ancestor, a few generations back--but recent blood means something, to a place as alive with magic as Sirius’ old home. A tension he hadn’t realized he was feeling always rolls off him when Draco steps inside. The low lights shine golden on his wavy hair, and Harry realizes with abruptness that he’s falling in love.
Harry has every intention of turning around and shutting him up, but by the sound of a shuddering breath of pain, it seems that someone beat him to it. He peeks over his shoulder to see Dolohov crumpling wordlessly to the ground. Lucius stands behind him, face impassive, his wand pointed at Dolohov’s back. He’s jerking in a painfully familiar way. All of them have been subject to the Cruciatus Curse enough times to develop ways to cope, lest they damage their minds. Dolohov’s method has always involved deathly silence.
“Draco,  I really wish you’d just reach out to a Potions Master. You know how I feel about those fumes,” Harry sighs.
Harry knows Draco well enough to decipher the unease on his face at the plain linen smell of the master suite. He wouldn’t be surprised if being in the Citadel itself was contributing to it, considering what happened the last time he was here properly. Harry promises himself that he’ll scent a few things around their quarters when Draco is away.
A confused silence follows, and then the hall erupts into camera shutters and shouting and crimson robes as Fred is taken away, a half smile on his face.
“When I was growing up, fighting was just a fact of life. It didn’t matter what you were. We were all treated pretty much the same, except for when the Omegas started growing.”
Despite the cramped space, it’s cozy and lovingly decorated. There’s a small couch and a little table for eating, outfitted with two peeling wooden chairs. Ron’s favorite shade of orange is littering the wall in random places and even on a knit blanket thrown over the back of the couch. The mantle of the small fireplace is littered with several moving photos. Harry recognizes some people, and feels a pang of sadness over the faces he doesn’t recognize. It hurts to know that they’ve made more friends, and love them enough to keep pictures of them, without Harry there to know about it.
Fred laughs. It’s weird to hear him laugh without George echoing him, but the sound makes Harry smile anyway.
, and he links trembling hands underneath his knees and holds his legs up and apart, baring himself to Harry’s gaze. He’ll never tire of seeing Draco debauched and loopy, stomach slick and thighs slick with his release. Harry takes himself in hand, muttering a low oath, and then guides his cock along Draco’s wet slit. The fat head parts it, lips leaving a tacky wetness along his length. Draco’s eyes are closed, his bottom lip drawn underneath his teeth. Then his mouth falls open on a long, languid moan when Harry pushes inside. Harry widens his knees and leans down, replacing Draco’s hands with his arms as he starts rutting inside, too impatient to approach it all with any kind of finesse. The world is pleasantly hazy around the edges, like he’s living in a dream with just the two of them.
The moment Harry pulls his fingers out, a thin trail of saliva stretching after them, Draco pounces, throwing his arms around Harry’s neck. The bowl of fruit he was holding clatters noisily to the floor, but he has eyes only for Draco. They wrestle playfully, all nipping teeth and wandering hands, until Harry is flat on his back with Draco’s hands tight over his wrists. He raises his brows, grinning crookedly.
“Boor,” Draco retorts, clutching the sheets with one hand and sliding the other underneath where Harry’s is clutching the sheets for purchase.
“You don’t talk to me. You don’t touch me. I barely see you, and then I can barely keep you around. I know you’re busy, but you always… found time before…” He trails off at the frustrated look on Harry’s face, feeling his pulse thudding against his chest.
He follows up with the other, and smiles when Harry runs an adoring hand over stocking-covered thighs. He rises up onto his knees, and sighs as Harry spreads him open with one hand, the other holding his cock in place.
An odd rushing sound is building in Harry’s ears as the discussion continues. He thinks of how Fred and George would always make the younger children laugh whenever the caretakers sat war orphans down to remind them of their parents’ failings. He thinks of how Fred used to tuck Ginny under his arm and carry her around like a cheerful sack of potatoes. He thinks of Fred waggling his eyebrows at Harry over the head of cute Omegas. He thinks of elaborately constructed pranks.
“Well, what about using a Potter name, then?” Draco presses. “No matter what the baby is, how about we use one of the names from your family tree?”
“And I don’t have to let you stay here if you’re just going to insult my husband,” Harry points out, gently.
He doesn’t get a reply, and though it was the result he was expecting, it doesn’t smart any less. Then a positive reply comes from Hermione the next day, and Harry feels the most nervous he’s felt in a long while when it finally sinks in that he’ll be hosting Hermione, Ron, George, and Ginny. A part of Harry regrets that he made the offer at all, hates that they accepted, but it’s the right thing to do. At least, it feels like the right thing to do.
“Yes,” Harry says, staring up at the ceiling. “To check on my mate. But I was just dawdling, I’ll be out of your hair.”
Maybe it’s nothing. Maybe they’ve become less comfortable after their run in with Sonja. Either way, it doesn’t rest well with him. He’s thinking about it still when he arrives on the other side of one of the Malfoy Manor’s floos. He grimaces and brings a hand up to his stomach, feeling the roiling wave of the baby’s protesting magic rolling through him. He has a few months still before travel by floo will be forbidden, but baby Potter seems to have decided that they hate it already.
Harry’s shoulders shake with laughter. That breaks through the haze of frustration and makes him smile.
It’d been an awful summer, going back and forth to a mind healer, and then coordinating times to see Nan when Grandfather wasn’t there, watching Father struggle to hold on to his composure as he watched his mother lose her grip on life. Uncle Ron, a senior Auror, later told them she’d been hit with a new curse and favorite of Death Eater sympathizers, something that attaches itself to the brain and systematically tears about that which makes magic
“I would like you all to give a very warm greeting to Mrs. Irina Bolotin, who was so instrumental in our Russian victory. She has been appointed as ambassador as the integration process begins and will be staying here for some time. I would like you to make her and her family comfortable,” Voldemort says, gesturing at Bolotin, who respectfully bows her head. “I have brought you here today to discuss your roles in this process, and also to begin preliminary talks on our next advance.”
Their final stop is an exclusive tailor’s business, half store, and half workshop. The place has been getting a lot of visits from nobles aching to drown their post-bombing sorrows with purchases, and the grapevine has been favorable, so they booked an appointment ahead of time.
“Once you can get an Omega all relaxed and ready for you, it’s not hard to bring them off multiple times. One of the best feelings in the world, you ask me. Making them all desperate and eager to please.”
The first thing, I have noticed as I have opened my eyes was – snow. As I, slowly, sat up from where I laid, speculating of where I was. Across me is a field cover by it; nothing else but the white horizon.  As I stood up, I realized that I was barefooted and dressed only in my oversized marron pajamas, yet, I wonder why I wasn’t cold. Maybe, because I’m in a dream that’s why I couldn’t feel anything.
It was a relaxing morning, that I could say as both of us were mesmerized by the pouring rain outside our tent. It has been a week since Hermione had found me, all of those days had been spent on understanding what had happened to me but alas the mystery has yet to be solve as both of us has only come up with an idea that the change I had undergone into a dark creature, who craves blood and flesh - was no accident but was orchestrated by someone and I have a nasty suspicion that my demon was the one behind this. It was really frustrating because with all the clues that were right up on our faces, we cannot go on with our research and the reason why is I have no idea who the heck or even the name of my demon. Add to that was our limited reading source materials and time that we spend on researching had lessened since we still have to find food and move from one place to another to prevent us from being caught by the ones that were haunting us.
“Because I know that if I were to leave you alone, the first thing you’d do is try to chase some commoner’s knot--”
The proceedings are paused briefly by the Aurors’ murmured words of sympathy. If there’s anything that can soften a Pureblood, it is talk of children. But when they continue, the hint of approachability on their faces is gone completely.
It takes him a while to notice that Harry has stopped stroking his hair. Draco always uses him as a living heat source on their TV days. Harry knows his duties well. He is not to move, and he is obligated to provide the maximum amount of affection. He lets out an affronted little noise and tilts his head up, resting his chin on Harry's chest, to see him better.
They rock sleepily together for a good few minutes. Draco’s second orgasm is weaker, slower, rolling through his lithe frame until he’s trembling underneath Harry’s touch. Harry places a sloppy kiss on the curve of his cheekbone and settles atop him, uncaring of the sweat and stickiness between them.
Lucius gives him that mean smile again. “Yes, I wonder what we would see of the bond between your twin?”
They decide to put all their worries into a letter and send it off for their parents. They get a reply a few days later, along with the sweets Dad makes only for them.
"You'll have to be patient with Draco now that he's off his potions, Mr. Potter," Healer Shafiq is saying, as they're preparing to leave, "preparing for a heat can be difficult, especially without hormonal regulation."
“I don’t. I’m sorry, but I don’t. I don’t want to do that again. I don’t want to take the mark. I would much rather leave Father’s seat in the inner circle for someone who wants it when he passes, find a spouse to have my heir and spare with, and live in peace doing my research. I don’t like being a murderer.”
“I know! Trust me, baby, I know.” Harry soothes, amused and heartened despite himself at the frustration setting into Draco’s shoulders. He wouldn’t have dared express his displeasure so openly even a few months ago.
"Anyway, where are Ron and Hermione? Did they not want to come because of. . ." Draco changed the subject carefully, knowing about Fred.
"U-usually Monsieur Lapin is here with me. He's spelled to keep nightmares away. I left him at the manor before I came." Draco looked sheepish and embarrassed, which Harry had never seen before.
"Have you ever heard of the phrase 'let sleeping dragons lie' Harry? Let's put that one into practice, shall we?" That promptly persuaded Harry to finish his letter and send it with Draco's owl to spite him (I was in the midst of writing this, and I was about to say sent it with Hedwig, and then I remembered).
"Can I touch one, please," Harry was cautious since he was the one who gave Draco those scars. Draco nodded after a few seconds of contemplation. Harry started with one going up to his shoulder; the others seemed too intimate. The scar's rough skin felt out of place next to the soft skin on Draco's torso. Harry broke down and did something he never thought he would do. He hugged Draco Malfoy. It took a few seconds for Draco to register the hug, but he eventually wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry kept whispering 'I'm so sorry' over and over again until Draco started crying and pushed Harry off.
"Since you are all responsible adults, we will be learning about Amortentia, also known as the love potion. We will be brewing it, but it's not in any book, so you'll be following directions from the board. This potion is never to be used on a person, for it is an extreme violation of privacy, and it is also immensely illegal."
What If I was mean and put out the Christmas chapter on Christmas? (that might actually happen considering my schedule, so I'm sorry in advance)
Harry has A LOT of Gay panic in this chapter, and so would Draco if I hadn't decided to not use 3rd person Omniscient.
"Monsieur Lapin?" Harry was trying hard not to laugh, but he held it in because Draco was looking more and more like a kicked puppy by the second. "He-he's a stuffed rabbit my mother gave me when I was born, and I was taught French as my first language, therefore, Monsieur Lapin." Harry could feel his heart melting at the vision of a 3-year-old Draco, holding a small bunny by one arm.
"Yes, it does." Draco's answer brimming with confidence and a smirk appeared on his lips as if he was telling us that 'He was the best'.
I saw Hermione lays awake as soon as I reach her, upon seeing me, she immediately put a finger on her lips - signaling me to be quiet. She began to slowly rose from her bed and took her beaded bag, her long coat and, her wand.
Hermione was looking at me, expecting my answer. Her face that had held a curious expression turn into shock as her glance met my gaze, and I saw the reflection of myself in her eyes. My face had twisted with overwhelming sadness and anger. An expression that I never saw on myself. Compassion spread on Hermione's face as she abruptly stood up from her seat and went to my side. Her arms encircle my shuddering body without fear of what I have become.
Every word he drops made my eyes grow bigger, this is a revelation but doesn't seem to be bothering him that he is telling these all to a muggle-born.
"Oh, that's right, Harry, I forgot to ask you." Hermione stood up and walk up to me as she looks me up from head to my toes for inspection. "Are you in pain?"
As soon as I saw that Malfoy was in danger, I made a dive, speeding down towards them. I suddenly feel a boiling sensation in my chest, realizing that I was extremely angered by their action. I can hear shouts from my friends and my teammates but right now, my mind only focused on getting to Malfoy before they could hurt him.
I slowly crept closer, keeping my wand ready. I took a last steady breath and took off, running towards it as I barked, "Sectumsempra!!!"
"The Crestfallen Draconis" Luna muttered as she held out her hand to catch the raindrops and as the raindrops had fallen on her hand, I thought that really indeed the rain had seemed to become teardrops. The weeping dragon.
I open my mouth and took a bite. Heaven. That's the word that entered my mind as soon as the flesh and blood entered my mouth. Bite after bite, my consciousness slowly returns me. I was becoming aware that I was eating Malfoy's hand and he offered it to me, with no fear in his eyes or disgust. Even though, I vaguely remember his conversation with Hermione, his eyes that were watching as I feed was the only concern. That emotion that he was showing had hit me so much that my eyes unwillingly let out tears.
"I think we should bring you to St. Mungo, Harry," Mrs. Weasley said as she approached and appraised my ashen face before handing me a glass of cold water.
The blonde turn to the brown-haired human but did not let his eyes leave me. "Yes, it is I," He said sarcastically. "Tell me, Granger. What in Morgan's name did happen to Potter to make him...like this? Or do I have to pry it out of you? Because seriously, I really could use a bit of information and a reason, on why should I let Potter here live."
"That's good" Remus smiled. "Sirius is very worried about you since you never talk about these things with him"
"Shut up, Granger." He said then brought the knife to his left hand and slice across it. The blood from his hand was dripping fast and as its scent hits me, I started to struggle more. But the lad didn't panic or flinch away from me instead he walked slowly towards me. A very unusual sight that had made me stunned as I cease from moving and fighting my ropes. And upon reaching me, unexpectedly, he raised his wounded hand and place it on my lips.
I almost smile at Hermione's chattering. Trust Hermione to be calm in these kinds of situations. "I am not silly, Hermione." Then I froze. "Escape?"
"Harry Potter catches the snitch!!!" Lee Jordon announced in excitement. "150 points to Gryffindor!"
My face sting from her slap, the pain woke me up. I guilty bow my head for even suggesting that. "I'm sorry, Hermione."
He slowly turned to Hermione and sweep one of hand directing at her as if he was telling her that she will be the one to explain the current situation to me. Reluctantly, Hermione nodded at him then turn to stare at me with absolute determination. A look at Hermione that I fear for it means that whatever I have become or whatever she and Draco have discovered is utterly serious.
I took the tray and put it over my lap, the warmth radiating from the food, could be felt from the metal tray. I started to scoop the porridge and tasted it. It was warm and delicious.
"I guess you can tap in your modified magic core now, Harry." He said casually. "Which makes me wonder if after the creature you are becoming  might be from an inheritance after all."
I didn't realize that someone was holding my hand until whoever it was, squeezed it, and called out a name again - Harry, then I have realized it was a female who was holding me. From her hands, I could feel the warmth of her body, her blood flowing.
I rubbed my face and shifted in my seat as the silence reign between the three of us as the reminiscing ended. Hermione and Ron were found by Sirius as they keep on shouting for my name when I have fallen in the dark pit. For some reason, Sirius was able to go around the said cave to find me while avoiding the Gulon. I was found unmarred at the very bottom of the pit with no memory regarding my fall. We also found out that Sirius was able to escape the death eaters by hiding in the Gulon's cave. Thanks to Sirius's animagus form, he was able to avoid and evaded the said creature while staying there. It was also fortunate that he was able to stumble on Ron and Hermione as they were planning to climb down the pit to search for me.
Professor McGonagall turned to us and pointed at the couch in the corner of the room to let us sit as they discussed. Silently, We sat down to wait for our turn. It could be over soon. Knowing Malfoy, he might complain that he is being treated unfairly or he did something to a Gryffindor that had caught our head's attention.
"That's good and all but that doesn't explain why are you tampering with my food," I said, still confused with the whole situation.
'Oh, I have no doubt that they will.' She giggled in my head, sarcastic as it sounds. 'But it will be too late for you then.' Then her laughter bounced inside my skull, taunting me even more. 'Poor. Poor Harry. Dead. Just like your parents. Like your poor mother dead from saving you.'
Her eyes searched within my eyes, she understood as she slowly nodded. She knows that I will tell her when there are no people around us. In private. With relief, I brought back my attention to the lecture as the burden in my heart lighten.
"I still need some proofs and of course your help for additional information in regards to what did exactly happen to him."
“Yesssh…” He smirked at us as he slowly answered, prolonging the ‘s’-sound of the word, making me gulped so hard. He trudged through the forest path and we hurriedly follow him.
"You remember when the time we tried to rescue Sirius around when he went missing for three months and stumbled upon the runes in that...cave? Where I and Hermione got...?" I mumbled and stop as I didn't want to reminisce that particular scene again.
After everything had calm down, Draco had invited us, Hermione and I for an early lunch since I had already woke from my sleep. Hermione also wanted me to be immediately fed upon my waking.
"Who are you?" I shouted as my voice also echoed throughout the cave. "What do you mean Grim? Is Sirius is here?"
Standing straight with the aura of regal, the blonde turn to the female saying. "What benefit would I get out of this? and why should I help you?"
"Why?" He asked. "Don't tell me that you are disgusted with my blood then I guess I'll ask Hermione."
“So, our agenda for this day are 2 main points. Firstly, we’re going to test your abilities.” Draco spoke as his eyes wander from the greenery of the lush forest to my very own emerald eyes, making me conscious as his silvery gaze stared at me with interest and intensity.
"No, I really meant it. Hermione, thanks for the clothes, the soap for my bath, and the food." I smiled at her. "Without you, I would die, helplessly."
"I guess, Harry already knows that not all is simple, right?" Draco said as he kneaded my knuckles and laid his head on one of the shoulders.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
I had to freshen up and dressed before I could go down for breakfast that day. I left Ron snoring on his bed in a deep sleep. Hearing the commotion from the first floor, happy voices sounded out, I went down the stairs.
A creature that resembled a man with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms and twisted face with rows of sharp teeth emerged from the darkness, grunting as it scavenges the area for food. It was holding a club as a weapon as it swings around beating the bushes to scare the small creatures that were hidden.
Hermione had a second of surprise expression on her face as she didn't expect Malfoy to hand the notebook willingly and to be called with her surname instead of mudblood. But the surprised look on her face, dissolve as soon as she opens the notebook and began scanning for the content.
A dark brown hair boy walked forward with so much confidence, picked the hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.
As soon as I have released him, Michael scrambled for safety. Hermione slowly approached me as she could see the reason had returned to me.  "Harry?"
I don't know why but I want the owner of that scent -to be hurt. Be killed. I turn in that direction. What I saw was a male in blue sports gear, desperately trying to hide from me. I have chosen him. I made the stance to spring, as I am to hunt him down.
My demon suddenly runs up to me, with that wild cackle. Her hands encircle around my neck then she pushes me down. As I hit the ground, her hands begin to squeeze. I couldn't breathe, the pain of her hold and of my inability to take in the air begin to flood me. I started to kick and hit her with my fists but nothing fazes her. Her weight on my body seems able to unbelievably immobilized me. And as I struggle more, the more she laughs and enjoyed my weakness and my inability to defend myself.
"Harry!" Hermione and Ron spoke in unison and rush beside me. After a while, the pain slowly fades. I  raise my hand to them, silently telling me that 'I'm fine.'
Hermione silently turns towards me. I studied her face, she had dark eye bags and a washed-out expression. I suppose she was still having them.
"Draco and I had an idea that might help you in reducing your craving if we feed you magical creature's flesh and scheduled you to have a bit of human blood from us." She spoke slowly. " For the cure, well...we still don't anything as for now but we will eventually find it!
Still leaning on the sliding door, Malfoy smirked a nasty one at Ron. "I wish that's the only reason" then he sighed as more voices joined in calling his name.
Then out of nowhere, Malfoy laughs. His laughter was like bells - chiming like music. Like ripples in a still pond after a stone had been thrown in. It radiated outward through the forest. I could see his stomach shaking as he fights a new gale of laughter. He was slapping both of his hands up and down almost involuntarily and could barely breathe from laughing. Fat tears would roll down his cheeks and it seems it would take a long time for him to subside his laughter.
I slowly walk out with both of my hands up in the air as a way of non-verbal communicating that I meant no harm. As soon as Malfoy saw me, he relaxes his stance but still had his guard up.
Draco tenses in Harry’s arms. As Anezka seats herself at the table, Harry approaches to pull a chair out for Draco to sit in. Once Draco is seated, Harry begins pacing, hoping the release of energy will temper some of the anger taking root.
repurposed my family’s manor as his base of operations. I was excused from the worst of it, obviously, and spent most of my time in my room when I could. But when I absolutely couldn’t escape making an appearance, some of his followers would make… comments.”
Black chuckles. It starts low and then grows into a loud, belly laugh, wracking through his entire body. “I suppose you’re right.”
Bolotin nods her head in thanks, and then, after tilting that same odd smile at Harry’s assembled companions, she swans off, entirely uncaring of the many calculating eyes on her back. That was a statement if ever Harry’s seen one, and he’s not sure if he likes being a part of it.
They all insist on meeting Harry when it’s time for closing. Just as he promised, Harry is waiting for him outside, and he watches with no small amount of amusement as Draco stumbles over to him. He looks devastatingly, unfairly handsome in the golden glow of the streetlights above, the deep red of his robes making his eyes pop.
“I mean not to offer information that was not asked of you. These Londoners will twist even the smallest things.”
He rolls off Harry and onto his back, sighing and trembling. Half-lidded eyes watch with focused interest as Harry swipes a finger over his chest. He pops the tip, covered in Draco’s come, into his mouth, and Draco blushes even deeper than he already was.
Father leans forward, then a laugh tumbles out of his chest, vibrating against the side of Scorpius’ head. “Hm. There’s this smell that babies have, at the crown of their heads? Harry thought I’d gone mad when James was born because I used to spend so much time just sniffing him. But then I made him try it, and he loved it, and by the time you and Al were born the family was making fun of us for sniffing our babies. I smell that.
James, unable to stay away from the gardens too long, happily accepts Scorpius as an assistant gathering materials for another of Father’s potions.
After a quick breakfast, Dad goes up to the master bedroom to kiss Father goodbye, and then pens a note for them to leave on the dining room table.
Harry reaches a hand out to help him onto the bed. Once he’s on, Draco squeezes his hand in both of his smaller, softer ones, and cradles it to his chest. “No. I just wonder sometimes.”
“You’re mean,” Draco replies, nonsensically. He’d been assembling a very rude set of epithets in his head, but these are apparently the only two words he was able to muster.
It would be difficult for someone who wasn’t looking for it to notice, but Draco has already become a bit softer around the edges. There’s a flush to his cheeks and the slight curve of his hips is growing right along with his belly. He’s always been slender--pointy, Harry had uncharitably thought once, on their wedding day--and that hasn’t changed in any tangible way, but the evidence of their little family growing is somehow both soothing and scary. How will he ever be able to protect them, in a world like this? How will he ever be able to keep them together? They’d been this close to slipping through Harry’s fingers and he’d been none the wiser right up until the last minute. Feeling his eyes sting tellingly, Harry kisses Draco’s forehead and watches him sleep.
This elicits whoops and noises of appreciation. Draco leans over and whispers into Harry’s ear. “What’s Lowtown? I keep hearing people talking about it.”
She steps aside and stands a few feet away with her hands linked behind her back--it’s about all the privacy she can offer them, even with Harry’s status. That had been mandated by the Dark Lord himself. It is a wonder the former members of the Order are allowed any visitors at all, especially now.
“Well, how about I talk,” Harry chuckles, sliding a hand up, up, over a calf, and teasing the back of a knee. Draco’s thighs fall open. “And when the day comes when you’re ready to do the same, you let me know.”
The Healer smiles sympathetically at Draco as Harry hoists him up onto the cot. Draco squeezes Harry’s hands for support and returns her smile with a hesitant one.
Fearing that he’ll truly lose his hold on his temper if they speak of this any longer, Harry dismisses her. Before she leaves, she promises to stay home and then curtseys to them both, so deeply that her skirts flare out over the floor. Draco watches her leave with anger bright in his eyes.
Pansy lets out a growl of frustration. “I said that! I told you I wanted time away! Why is it different now?”
“This is as much your home as mine, sweetheart. I don’t want you to feel like you need to make yourself small, especially right now.” Harry says, gently rubbing Draco’s arms.
Harry lowers his hood and pulls Draco into his arms with a low purr, and it’s then that Draco smells the familiar ozone burn of his magic, so potent it’s almost pulsating in the air around him. His curly hair is in utter disarray, flyaway and sweat slick in odd places. There’s a thin cut clotted over with blood on his forehead, and a smudge of dirt on his cheekbone. His round spectacles are cracked. Draco pulls his wand out of his pockets and mutters an
Just as he begins to walk, his wrist is snatched up into a powerful grip. He shoots an alarmed look over his shoulder and turns around completely when his wrist grinds painfully in protest.
My mind went in the opposite direction of Classroom Hymns while I was working on the follow up and I couldn't get the stupid words "milf Draco" out of my head LMAO. Something short and fun and an excuse to toy around with a new pairing (Albus Severus/Draco). Al is about a year out of Hogwarts
“I asked if you were alright,” he says, gently. When she wordlessly shakes her head, he smiles and asks her to breathe with him, a mother’s compassion clear on his kind face.
Harry laughs. “I don’t know how. We’ll figure it out together when I get home, how does that sound?”
No more words are shared between them for an amorphous amount of time. Draco falls in and out of a light doze, Harry’s stroking his hair. Then, after a moment, the question he’s been wanting to ask resurfaces in his mind, and he can’t really bring himself to keep his eyes closed.
A peculiar, almost hateful look flashes across Harry’s face, quickly replaced by a bashful smile. “She didn’t make it easy.”
Draco closes his eyes. He should have known that day in the Citadel wouldn’t have been the end of it. He should have known that tense Imbolc blessing was not the olive branch he had been hoping for. That much had been clear in the greed on Thicknesse’s face, and Draco, hopeful and foolish, had ignored it. Father continues speaking.
The brush of his hot breath flows over Draco’s bondmark, sending a full-body shudder through his frame. Then, he bites down, harsh and unyielding. If Draco were in his right mind he’d be embarrassed about the answering rush of slick he can feel dampening his underwear.
“I’ll choose something appropriately ridiculous and Pureblood,” Draco says, smiling tremulously. “Bartholomew, or Hyacinth, or some such.”
It takes some doing, what with them being locked together and covered in a faint sheen of sweat, but eventually Draco is free, sighing as the cooling air hits his bare skin. Then Harry murmurs a few cleaning charms to make the wait a bit more comfortable.
“I know him,” Harry blurts. He doesn’t know what makes him say it. He hates that he did it. All eyes are on him. “We grew up in the same orphanage.”
Draco pauses obediently to accept the chant, and then bobs a grateful curtsey on his way past. Dragonpox took Grandfather Abraxas when Draco was fairly young, and though his memories of the man are faint, he has always had the impression of someone who’d cheerfully abandoned many social conventions in his old age. Grandfather was a hermit in every sense of the word, and happy enough to spoil Draco when given the opportunity. Considering the tight-lipped disapproval now firmly on Father’s face as Draco approaches, it still annoys him.
Draco’s hips stutter, and his tight walls clench rhythmically around Harry’s cock. He lets out a gasp, then shoots his release into Harry’s hand. He’s flushed all the way down to his collarbones, sweat-darkened hair laying flat against his face, mouth open.
By the time his heat breaks, he’s sore in places he never thought possible, tired, and so in love he can’t stand it. It’s a tender, almost frantic emotion, overwhelming him at odd moments and delighting him in others.
“You, too,” Theo says, drawing close for a friendly peck on the cheek as he makes his way inside. “And I’d like it if I could trouble you both for some dinner before I have to make Father’s ridiculous curfew.”
The nearly white fan of his lashes is lovely, but when he glances up at Harry with those heated eyes, his throat aches with want.
“Draco,” Mother sighs, approaching his fireside chair. He’s already crying by the time she slides her warm hands over his shoulders and gently massages them. “If you eat at least half of your breakfast I’ll have one of the elves get some… anchovies for you. How does that sound?”
As he gently brushes his shoulders clean, the door to the little parlor opens, and Mother peeks her head in. She smiles gently at the sight of him.
Harry can’t help but laugh. She smiles sheepishly over at him. He can see the faces of Draco’s family’s tightening in immediate distaste at such an open admission of her failings, but it’s refreshing to hear.
Draco smiles as she presses her hands to his stomach, settling in for the small chant. Then they spend a few peaceful movements in thoughtful silence broken only by the occasional whisper. The calm of it lulls him into a doze, right there on his knees, vaguely aware of the warmth of Sonja’s thigh against his, the floral smell of the incense they lit, the soft breeze blowing in through the cracked windows. Sonja gently pulls him up onto her feet when she’s done. She smiles down at him as he rights himself, looking a bit worried.
Dad says, “I don’t get a hug like that? I see how it is,” and when Al shifts over to give him the same tight embrace, he lets out a light
“I understand. A mother’s work is hard. Thank you, Draco, for fulfilling your responsibilities. Truly, well done. I hope that you can remind your husband of his own.”
The drink is filled with all the extra marshmallows Scorpius pretends he doesn’t like, and the warm smell of it curls in his belly. Scourgifying his teeth to enjoy it to the fullest, Scorpius scoots up on his bed, pulling his duvet back so Father can perch beside him.
All of the enthusiasm leaves Draco once he has to actually get on the broom. First, he sits down side saddle, perplexed when there’s nothing to hold his legs aloft. He hates the “impropriety” of straddling the broom, and even Harry’s lowbrow innuendos aren’t enough to distract him, though he does smile and call Harry a boor. The only thing that convinces him to give it a proper try is riding with Harry, holding on tight and looking at the world below with awe. They spent hours flying along the River Tyne, observing the stalwart length of Roman walls and the lush green of the world below. When they returned to the estate, Draco was windswept and dreamy eyed, already talking at length about the sights he wanted to see.
“No, but thank you. How embarrassing. It’s nothing. Hormones.” He says, and the words sound like a bad lie even to his own ears.
, Father had said. He was wrong. So wrong. Marrying Harry was the most filial thing Draco has ever done in his life. He has just been exceptionally lucky that it was the best match he could have hoped for.
Harry reaches up to tuck his hair behind his ears, eyes so tender that it takes all of the fight right out of him. “Don’t be difficult, sweetheart.”
Father laughs quietly at that, gently running a hand through Lily’s bright red locks. She already looks halfway to a nap, which tells Al she’d been more anxious than she let on. When Lily’s really upset, the first thing she does is drop off into sleep.
When Clara Edmonton approaches them, accompanied by a house elf with a black box in hand, Harry amusedly watches as Draco casts his eyes around them in search of an escape.
“My husband got word of your husband’s pregnancy and has been pestering me about having tea with him,” she says, her lips pulling up into a smile that looks weirdly practiced, “young Omegas must stick together when it comes to babies, he says.”
He runs a hand down Draco’s shaking side, and tugs playfully at the hem of the nightgown. It takes some coaxing, but he gets Draco on his back, and then out of the gown, smiling at the way Draco reaches for a pillow and muffles a shriek of laughter into it. Shyness is rare and endearing in Draco.
They find the most unfair rhythm this way, with Harry lazily kissing along his chest, helping Draco fuck himself on his fingers. Right as it feels like he might come, a heavy hand lands on his hip, stilling him in an iron grip. Draco sobs out a protest. “Please, don’t make me stop.”
“Come in,” he calls, pillowing his forehead in his palm. “Do you need anything, sweetheart? Want to come sit with me?”
He’d been staring down in spellbound silence for so long that he hadn’t accounted for the noises he’d make himself. He puts it right back where he found it, rearranges Harry’s desk into something resembling untouched, and leaves the study altogether. He clasps his hands together over his heart, feeling it thudding harshly against his thumbs.
He swirls his tongue along the tip of Draco’s cock, and then lowers his head and swallows. Draco shifts restlessly under his hold, moaning softly. His thighs close around Harry’s shoulders when Harry swallows again. Harry pulls off to move lower, licks a flat stripe from where slick is gathering at Draco’s cunt and then all the way up to his clit, affixing his lips to the hard nub. Harry groans into his flesh, something desperate in him settling at the sweet taste of him, the rhythmic roll of his hips.
Draco can see the people around him wincing as they do so, some unsteady on their feet. They’re held aloft by their loved ones, looking ghostly in their white robes, flower crowns askew. Harry holds him up with an arm around his waist.
Harry hums and works him through it, pulling his fingers out and replacing them with his tongue once more, savoring the taste, the smell, the feeling of Draco’s loosened walls fluttering around the wet muscle.
“Yes. I didn’t come here to tell you my life story. It's too complicated for me to explain right now. I’m sorry. I just thought... you deserve an apology. I helped the people who attacked us. I helped the people who attacked us, and you took the fall I deserved for it.” She whispers. Then she closes her eyes tightly, breathing in through her nose and out through her mouth. It’s the same pattern as the one the older Omega showed her that day, back when she’d all but melted into a puddle of nerves in that grimy back alley.
Harry wants to refuse, but he hasn’t been on the receiving end of the look Voldemort is pinning him with in years. It’s one of mixed hostility and amusement, like a bird of prey observing a potential kill. When he feels the familiar nudge of an intruding legilimens’ assault making his temples ache, he quickly lowers his gaze and agrees. The first poke is always a warning, and he doesn’t like the idea of exposing the odd directions his mind has been going in the past few days.
Aunt Andromeda and Nan didn’t really look like each other as much as Aunt Andromeda looked like their other sister, the one Lily has only ever seen in photos, the one who’d caused so much pain. They have the same dark, curly hair and heart-shaped face, but Aunt Andromeda’s hair is streaked with grey and her resting expression is this wry little smile, accentuated by laugh lines when it grows.
sends a mangled figure sailing overhead. They pour into the school and break apart into the neat groups they planned for. Harry watches as Death Eaters blow doors open and drag sobbing children out by their ankles or with magically conjured whips. Their teachers put up a vicious fight--more than one Death Eater falls to the killing curse or the distinctive traditional magics that have been causing them all so much trouble.
Father’s pacing slows until finally, he is standing a few feet away from where Draco is seated, staring down his nose. “I recently spoke with Pius Thicknesse. He has offered to have you in the event that your bond with Potter is dissolved.”
Harry wraps his arms around his waist, resting his chin on his shoulder. Their reflections stare back at them. Draco looks unsettled, but the hungry look on Harry’s face is familiar.
Mother calls a house elf for desert. She knows his favorites, and requests a jam roly poly for him and simple pudding for herself.
At the rising protests stumbling from their mouths, he presses his wand against his neck. “I’ll have Peeves giving us all detention, see if I won’t!”
The sky is dark by the time they finally extract a tearful surrender from what remains of Koldovstoretz’s forces. Harry does not know if it is the same day as the one they went in, but he is so desperate to be gone that even the grotesquely poisoned forest is a relief to see. They round up prisoners and hunt down Purebloods (many of them had been encouraged by Dolohov’s contacts to hide in the kitchens if they intended on joining the Dark Lord’s society, but not all of them were able to do so), and then oversee the operations of the various Muggleborns brought in to enforce their win in their brief absence.
Rosier, breathing in deep, frantic pulls of breath, points her wand at Smith. People gasp when they hear her beginning the incantation for the killing curse.
He waits until Winny returns, with a slice of frosted lemon cake that looks distressingly good, before opening the book again.
He tilts his head back, clearly wanting a kiss, and Harry captures his lips right as he slides in on one slow thrust. Harry groans into his open mouth, and Draco laughs lightly. It trails off into a low moan when Harry slides almost completely out and pushes back in.
Draco grew up eating catered meals. The elves of the Manor knew his favorites and worked diligently to accommodate them. The same could be said of Hogwarts' elves. He's known the finest cuisine. None of it compares to the rice he gleefully drowns in soy sauce, or the chicken that's just this side of stretchy from the sweet and sour sauce. Harry watches him the entire time they eat, brows climbing further and further up his forehead.
They practice until the sun’s position in the sky shifts, bearing merrily down on them. It’s an uncharacteristically warm day for Newcastle, and it’s lovely, but Draco is unused to feeling the brunt of the sun’s rays. Mother would have blown her gasket. Aside from Beltane, they never spent time outside without some kind of covering. By the time they finish, he’s sweaty and overwarm and a little dizzy, and most importantly so aroused his throat feels tight. Harry’s tunic leaves nothing to the imagination--neither do his own riding breeches, and his lovely tanned skin looks almost golden.
“It--what? A duet?” Draco says, but he’s already walking over to the large grand piano and plopping down onto the bench as Pansy shoves messy handmade sheet music in his face.
“I can only hope the child isn’t an Omega,” Hermione continues, as if she’s commenting about the weather. “It’s hard enough being a Beta woman working for them.”
Draco nods wordlessly. Harry cradles him close as he scoots back towards the headboard and pulls him into his lap. A few soft kisses is enough to soothe him, and he lets out a shaky little sigh as Harry gently wipes his face clean.
She gives him a familiarly scolding look. Ridiculously enough, it’s this that makes the tears that he’s been fighting fall, and he scrubs them away with the fabric of his sleeve. He’s reminded that his robes are clearly of fine make, no matter how plain they are. He may as well be putting a spotlight on himself. As if sensing his train of thought, Hermione pushes the door open and fussily beckons him inside. The house is modest even by the standards of Lowtown, but that tends to be true for dwellings that don’t house multiple families. The open floor of the living room is halfway dominated by an oven and aged but well-tended countertops, and the short hallway yields only two doors--one for the bedroom, the other for the washroom.
Draco whines, stroking himself faster. The thought of it fills him with this wanting that makes his throat burn. Every other heat up until now has been a nuisance, something for him to suffer through in a haze of sweat and food that tasted like ash on his tongue. The thought that now, he has a powerful Alpha with him, one that loves him and desires him, someone to scratch that itch deep inside, makes him greedy for it. “I want it now.”
“It is my hope that you can one day understand my concern for you, Harry. I have given you the chance to revive your family’s legacy and bolster another’s, but that chance can only go so far. If you cannot give Draco a child, I will be forced to dissolve your bond for his own good and aid his parents in finding him a proper mate.” He says.
Snape advises them to cast their most powerful bubblehead and protective charms before they finally begin the siege on Koldovstoretz. The moment they touch down outside the decimated remains of its surrounding forest, Harry understands why.
She shuffles over to him, and then kneels before him, the very picture of guilt. She reaches out to him, and he pushes her hands away with a disgusted noise. “
A cold hand rests between his shoulder blades. The small circles rubbed onto his back are a poor facsimile of Harry’s comforting touches, and he has to consciously avoid tensing up.
“Surely you didn’t think that having a few hostages on the line would have convinced the Dark Lord to stop all that he’s been doing,” Harry breathes out. “Tell me you didn’t actually think that.”
The young man rolls his eyes and steps aside. He protests weakly when Harry says he doesn’t want to be disturbed, but a narrow look solves the problem right away. The kid is almost certainly some noble’s child. The older Aurors wouldn’t dare question him, at least not in such a blatant way, even the Purebloods.
Draco whines as Harry starts up again, not really thrusting but grinding into his sensitive prostate again, not letting up. He pushes back into it. Then it’s too much and he gasps, jerking forward, hoping for some momentary relief. Harry checks this little act quickly, gripping his hips tightly enough that there will be bruises.
“I should think so,” Harry says. “I was thinking we could have the baby shower on your birthday. You know, get double the gifts for you and the baby. But, a little vacation sounds like a much better idea.”
Draco understands what Harry meant, all that time ago, when he said his magic was big. It rattles the glistening walls of the barrier around them, bouncing in arcs, razing the grass below. When Aunt Bella duels, it often looks like she is dancing. Now, she has a partner, who ducks and weaves and turns, the very air around his wand writhing chaotically from the heat of his magic. There’s a hungry look on Harry’s face. Where Aunt Bella has lost her usual cheer, Harry’s all lopsided grins and whoops and scattered taunts, some of them so nasty that Mother gasps, scandalized.
Harry releases his cock and slides his hand lower, rolling and tugging Draco’s balls in his hand, chuckling lowly at the loud moan that bursts from his lips. Then they delve even lower, and Draco’s briefly excited at the prospect of those thick fingers inside of him, but Harry just presses the pads of his fingers behind his balls. Draco twitches at the sensation--it feels good in a muted way, but the longer it lasts, the more heated it feels. It’s good, but it’s not quite enough, and it has him rolling his hips in quick, impatient little circles.
The sky is a lovely mix of purples and reds and the streetlights have flicked on by the time they make it to Hyde Park. The two of them separate from the Zabinis and settle at a cafe along the Serpentine, enjoying some darjeeling at an outside table. Draco takes one sip of his tea and grimaces, not at the taste, but at the way it sings with heat all the way down his throat, sending an unwelcome ripple of warmth through his body. He decides to let it cool.
Slytherins tend to walk in packs, in Hogwarts’ halls. If their parents are to be believed, inter-house rivalries aren't as bad as they were, but Scorpius and Al have had their fair share of being hexed when their backs were turned, so walking to class together is a tradition even if they won’t be sitting next to each other in class. In the days leading up to the holiday, their classmates quickly became accustomed to seeing Lily pass them, toss her thick red hair and primly say, “Grandchild number two, grandchild number three,” only to grin widely when they chorused, “Grandchild number four,” back at her with grave sincerity.
Hermione hums her agreement. "He's just wonderful with her, Harry. If we ever need someone to watch Rosie when Molly's not around, be prepared for us to come knocking at your door."
Al looks up just in time to see Lucius briefly close his eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallows. “Of course.”
Sirius is about to tell Malfoy to stuff it, but then Harry’s making his bleary eyed way downstairs, and the mean amusement on Malfoy’s face softens as he glances Harry’s way. “I see you’re still alive, Potter. Pity.”
The pregnancy Healer is a short little Beta woman with smile lines on either side of her mouth. She’s dark-skinned and her hair is a burst of gray curls on her head, wistfully reminding Harry of Hermione as he last saw her. She doesn’t look half as tired as Hermione did, though, and bustles about her workspace with jaunty energy.
“It can’t be easy, having Lucius around. I always remember him being very prickly.” Aunt Andromeda says, at length.
Harry’s fingers once again delve through his hair. After a hesitant silence, he says, “I’ll get one of the potions you brewed. Just--let me know if you need us to go home, alright?”
That’s apparently the end of that, but she can feel Father slide out of bed a few hours later--she’d fallen into a doze, but not quite a sleep, even with the two of them there--and when the sun finally rises, Daddy helps her out of bed and tells her she can make the visit.
Harry has the tip of his wand pressed underneath her chin before she can say anything else. Just then, the double doors for Voldemort’s war room spring open, his usual indication that they need to come inside.
He releases one of Draco’s thighs to slide a finger inside him up to the first knuckle. Harry raises his head and smile up at him, lips glistening. He watches with open appreciation as Draco adjusts to the feeling, biting his lip and huffing and sighing.
a service. They are fodder in this war, and you know that.” Oleander snaps. Then, softer, he says, “Listen, Pansy. Surely you understand the obligation that Alistair Bulstrode has to our society. He must allow the mistake in his bloodline to die out.”
He shouldn’t. But the urge to reach out is too strong, so he does, tucking a stray lock behind Draco’s ear. It reddens.
“My friends,” Voldemort rasps, a too-wide smile growing on his pale face as he spreads his hands wide. “Welcome.”
“Hello, everyone,” she says, smiling that big, unrestrained smile of hers. “Hello, Mr. Potter. It’s so good to see you again! I’m glad you’re healthy!”
“Excellent insight, Mr. Potter,” Slughorn praises as he passes their table. (He walks past Neville and Ron’s desk and says, “Oh dear,” all of the cheer leaving his voice.)
Malfoy's nodding before he can even finish speaking, which pulls a strained laugh from his mouth. They kiss again, more a tangle of lips and teeth than anything. Sirius shifts, widening his knees, gritting his teeth. It gives him just enough purchase to really get deep, and the pitch of Malfoy's moans tightens in response.
try to guilt me over doing what you’ve been doing for years?” Fred barks, all traces of dark humor absent from his voice.
“Do you know how many people died?” Harry asks. When Fred doesn’t answer, he continues. “A little over a thousand, including children. Several more thousands were injured, including my pregnant mate. Some people were injured permanently. They’re going to have to restructure their entire lives.”
The Healer’s brows rise. “That sounds like accidental magic. Do you or your husband still have bouts of it?”
Bellatrix’s grating laugh rings above the chaos as she twirls and casts. She gathers two hags around the neck with a well-timed
Teddy and Dad seem to get it, and nod at each other. Adults spend a lot of time communicating with their eyes.
“Thank you, Daddy,” he whispers against Harry’s lips, sending a jolt of shocked want directly into Harry’s belly.
He’s embarrassed by the tears that spring into his eyes, but Harry simply wipes them away, murmuring about how he’s such a good boy, that he’s learning, that he takes him so well…
He grips his cock and lines up, and Malfoy's eyes flutter closed as he slides in, a decadent groan falling from his lips. One hand finds its way to his chest, twisting a pretty pink nipple, and the other slides between them to take himself in hand, stroking short and sweet as Sirius bottoms out. Malfoy gives a languid stretch and then he's throwing those long, long legs over Sirius' shoulders. Sirius rolls his hips into a slow, insistent grind, resisting the urge to just rut with little care for his own pleasure, because he'd love to have Malfoy in his bed again, loud mouth and all. The loud mouth in question falls open on a low moan of his name.
And then Father is jumping back, glancing down at their feet, where Lily’s favorite snake is curling lazily along his ankle.
Rosier speaks next, surprising Harry. He has been drawn with anger ever since his niece died at the hands of a Muggleborn in the London duels. Sometimes it’s difficult for Harry to look at him, remembering that day.
“Please think about it seriously! Now, I know it’s a little early--you remember the September due date we calculated?--but have you given thought to how you’d like to have your baby? You’ve said you want a home birth, which we can absolutely arrange, but what about delivery methods? You’re around the time where your magic is starting to assemble a canal for delivery, but that can be stopped with the proper potions.” Healer Ouedrago says as she begins scuffling about the examination room in search of her equipment.
In her memories of the worst moments with her magic, Daddy is always there: gently stroking her hair after levitating her down from heights, or biting his lip to mask a laugh as he fixes so-and-so’s changed hair, or waving a hand and making everything right side up again. It's like he could feel it when it was about to happen.
The Junior Death Eater is staring down at whatever she sees with wide eyes. She and her fellows stand frozen for a few scant moments. Then, the small crowd is broken apart by Snape, who has broken away from his place among the inner circle to approach them. He looks not unlike a bat, with his black cape billowing behind him.
It’s a quick, gentle thing, but it ignites Draco’s skin, sends him tingling and trembling. He was already warm, already deep enough in the throes of his heat that he’d forgone his clothing for a gauzy robe, but Harry’s closeness has him abruptly wanting. There’s a decadence to this, in losing himself to instinct, trusting Harry and his magic to catch him. Harry, dependable and caring Harry, who’d laughed in the face of his father’s protests at some Half-Blood beta having the gall to court his heir, who cheerfully endures his fussing and tongue-in-cheek insults because he loves him.
He shudders when Harry cups his chin, and melts into the warm kiss Harry presses onto his lips. Harry playfully nips at his lower lip, and when Draco gasps, he sweeps his tongue inside. Draco’s gasing softly when they part, and he tilts his head to allow easy access as Harry presses wet kisses along his jaw and down his neck.
“There’s not a lot of… finesse. I can’t give you a show. I always had to be quick and quiet outside of my heats. I’ll look silly.”
“Hello, Draco. You look gorgeous, darling. Good,” Mother says, observing him with her hands on his shoulders.
Dad slings an arm around Scorpius’ shoulders. Scorpius leans into the embrace. He doesn’t doubt it. He’s heard dad speak maybe four sentences about the people who raised him, but there are little things that make him wonder. The way he only uses the Floo for firecalls, if that. The way he hates bullies. The way he always talks to them like they’re equals. His protective spirit. The way he smiles when Father calls him names and kisses him anyway.
“The world has moved past you, Lucius!” Father harrumphs, making an abortive outward gesture with his fingers splayed wide, like he can expel all the bad faith with his hands.
“How did you feel when you found out we were getting married?” Harry asks. “I remember being very angry. I hate it when people make my choices for me. I’d had a life full of it up until that point.”
The doors swing shut. Harry’s hand worms under his belly, and he works Draco’s cock with quick tugs.
Then out of nowhere, the alarms sound out. Hermione and I were on full alert as we immediately stood and pulled out our wands.
"Do you ever read a book, Weasley?" Sighing heavily, Malfoy glared at Ron. "The female Blood Dragon Butterflies take one male for the rest of their life, naming them their king. While the male can take as many female butterflies (The queens) to reproduce. Since I am NO insect. I couldn't serve her, the Queen, in a natural way of breeding. Instead, I give away my blood and my magic. Enough, to be able for her to be fertile and give birth to these little ones. So, basically, I am the father of those Blood dragon butterflies."
As I turn to her.  The one who has spoken wasn’t a child, not even a tiny bit. She was a teenager, maybe in her 17’s or 18’s. She had long midnight hair, pale skin like the snow that surrounds us. A petite body but hidden beneath her black satin dress- indicate more muscle than it might hint and eyes, that I could never look away from. Eyes with iris colored like the blood that covered me.
Even I was scared to death by my demon this morning and had been in hungry-row these past few weeks, I couldn't help but smile at his concern. Somehow, I feel so much better. Giddy but refreshed.
Ugh! I got so frustrated as I started to gnaw at my nails, a new bad hobby that I have developed from these past few weeks.
"Like a green frog," Fred added as he stood up from his seat and skipped towards us. He bent over as he continues to stare at my face.
“My. My. Hermione, I won’t even suggest it. If, I didn’t know how to. To answer your question. Yes, I do know-how and to answer the other question: where. We’ll just have to find them, right?!”
"Thank you, Malfoy for enlightening me," I uttered after inhaling and exhaling as I come in terms of my arrogance and lack of knowledge.
I flew back and slammed to the ground as I grunted in pain. The creature stood over me, leering at me. The monster was tall, grayish in color with bulging muscles over his shoulders to his arms and thighs to his legs. Nails so sharp that they can tear flesh with ease. His powerful handheld a wooden club.
Malfoy is surrounded by 24 miniature crimson butterflies as they dance encircling him, and a king-size crimson designed by black and blue patterns rested on the left side of his head, looking like a hair accessory. Malfoy looked so beautiful to me that it disturbed and made me think if I am actually crazy.
"Your food," Draco said. He set his mug down as he was sipping his chocolate drink. "We were tampering your food"
I turn to face Hermione with my most innocent look. "Teasing? I was just asking her about what did she mean with her comment."
"Stop being stubborn, Potter." He said as he pushed me to sit on my bed. "Here, drink this."  He snaps his middle finger and thumb then out from thin air - a teacup with the warm concoction appeared on his hand.
Upon entering, I couldn't help myself to be completely amazed by the said place. Inside the manor, the light can freely enter making the place more surreal as the place was furnished by light colors - giving off a feeling of peace, warm and safe. Simple and elegant that was the best description of this house, an unexpected contrast from Malfoy's nature, who is known for his cunningness and coldness.
'Close to submerge into your reality' She sang in my head as it bounced and echoed. 'My body has already fused with yours, right? Around that time, remember?'
"Hallucinations!?" Hermione's voice went a little high as she stood up immediately then kneeled in front of me to look into my eyes.
"You guess right!!!" The smile on Malfoy widens and turns into a lunatic one. "You don't have to be concern about her. She won't attack anyone until I say so."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With determination set in my mind, I stared at him and felt pain as I clenched my fists, saying word by word, like a vow. "This kind of thing...I definitely won't let it happen a second time."
A drowsy silence lay over us, as it continues to rain. The grass that spread over the forest's floor was once emerald green had turned to dark green - almost black as they drown from the water from the rain. Deprived by the sun's ray, we retreated to our favorite past time, listening to the old radio that Hermione brought along her. The radio aired the recent news in the wizardry world, once in a while would pop out some interesting topics, that's how we spend our whole morning until out of nowhere in the middle of advertisement - breaking news was announced.
Blushing, the house-elf returns to her seat as she continued with her breakfast. Draco took his time into cutting the meat into length-wise strips then placed some on my croissant then pass it on to me.
"Hmmm...Might I give different sets of solutions to your problem? Harry? Hermione?" Draco carefully folded the said letter and gave it back to Tiffany, who went away after a snap of her finger.
The blonde sighs. "Alright. But be prepared, it's a good thing you're a Gryffindor because this is not a pretty sight to see." He warns. "I want you to be ready with anything I ask for Granger. Anything." He emphasizes.
Again raising one of his eyebrows, Malfoy putting his spoon down and taking a napkin to dab his clean lips. Those pinkish lips. Gulping loudly as I caught myself gawking at Malfoy's lips.
"Harry. A bonded house-elf meant that one elf is to serve one master, thus, every rule that is designed to house-elves are not effective to her because of the contract made between Draco and Tiffany." Hermione patiently explained. "A vow for equal treatment for the loyal service."
Hermione gasped as her eyes widen with realization. "Maybe, the cave that we accidentally entered before is an ancestral burial, Harry! Pureblood family with magical creature inheritance!"
I know I was going crazy by shouting here all by myself but I couldn't take it anymore. I need to let it all out. To ask. Because I know I will breakdown anytime if I will not know what is really happening to me.
It has been an hour, since our exploration in the cave. The cave was like a mass - full of tunnels, stalagmites, dripping water, and rocks but nothing noticeable except for the guard stone from the entrance. The echo of our ever step bounds throughout the walls of the cave.
2. Strength (Hermione made me carry a boulder, so yeah! by Harry) (The boulder weighed around 200 kgs and Harry can easily carry it by Hermione)
P.S: You can Goggle the Gulon if you want there are other facts about it as well as its pictures as for the voice please imagine the cat's voice in Alice in wonderland.
"Tiffany, are you done cooking?" Draco asked as he walks towards the elf, looking over the pot that it was stirring.
His arms that I held up as soon as they were released, enclosed around my neck, and then he whispered to my ear, "Please continue, Harry."
Ron snarled and took off, as he shouted Corner's name in rage, Hermione cried at my side while Ginny wailed as she started hugging my body.
"Calm down, Harry!" Ron said as he went to me trying to put both of his hands on both my shoulders and guide me to sit in the lounge.
"You are wrong when you said it wasn't Potter business to butt in." He smiled in a sneering manner. "It is Potter's business."
"I'm trying to be your friend, so I'm trying to be theirs. Friends don't call friends by their last names. I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. . . Harry," grabbed his pajamas and headed for the bathroom. Harry pondered over the conversation he had that night. Everything was so strange; he was now friends with his enemy, without his best friends here.
Everyone in the class was staring, marveling at what had just happened, even Slughorn. Everyone was silent the rest of class because Draco was glaring at everyone daring them to comment on it. When class let out, Draco knew he needed to talk to Harry, however much he didn't want to.
I'm also using the book release date as the canon 8th year here (technically the release date was 2007, but after the great war (which I feel was in 2008 because school years SUCK) so the timeline is 2008-2009)
"I saw you staring, Potter. I thought you'd have had quite a good look at my ass on the quidditch pitch, but I guess you can't get enough of me." Harry choked on air and his face lit up like a Christmas tree. He spluttered for a few seconds until he gave up trying to defend himself. He could hear quiet laughter coming from Draco's bed, and when he gained the courage to look over, he saw the blankets shaking. Harry decided to get to bed as quickly as he could after that.
Harry stayed up a bit later, glancing every now and then back to Draco's sleeping form. About 10 minutes before Harry was going to get into bed, however, Draco sleepily mumbled just loud enough that Harry could hear,
"Yeah, all of us are sad about Fred, George mostly, but Hermione thought she was smart enough, and Ron's a lapdog when It comes to Hermione. They're staying at the Burrow and-- wait. You called them Ron and Hermione instead of Granger and Weasley. I thought that you didn't like them." Harry had gone from sad to confused real quick.
The next morning, Harry woke up 2 hours before classes started and quietly got out of bed, trying not to wake up Draco while doing so. He found a letter on his desk from Hermione. He gave Draco's owl a treat and left it to go to the owlery. Hermione's letter described how everyone was doing. George still wasn't talking and wore Fred's hand from the clock around his neck. Molly was throwing herself into cooking, cleaning, and getting the Burrow Christmas ready, even though it was only November 15th. (Can you tell I wrote this part during the Christmas season?) She and Ron were doing as fine as they could be in the Burrow.
"I did not know, Potter, because I was too busy trying to figure out whether I was gay or not. I am, by the way." Draco had the audacity to wink at him after that statement. Harry had to retaliate,
"I can't believe you still call me that. I'm not the chosen one anymore, not since..." Harry couldn't finish that sentence; he knew it was still painful for both of them.
"The Dursleys. They cared about keeping up appearances other than anything else. They said I was at a 'School for Troubled Boys' instead of Hogwarts. They barely gave me food and treated me like a house-elf. I did the cooking, cleaning, anything they wanted. Dudley was their favorite. Made me sleep in a closet until 2nd or 3rd year for Merlin's sake." The lightness in Harry's voice frightened Draco. Harry could see it in his face. He also saw immense, boiling anger at what they had done. Harry knew his childhood was an abusive one, and he knew there was nothing he could do about it now, so he accepted it for what it was.
"Okay." Hermione rasped and took out a quill, ink and, a parchment. "Then tell me, Harry. What are the things that you have observed about yourself or what did you feel these past days before I found you?"
When Harry walked into Hogwarts for his 8th year, he immediately regretted it. Everyone had their eyes glued to Harry when he walked into the Great Hall and followed him to the 8th year table. There was no need for houses for the 8th years; they were all children of War. He waved half-heartedly at the former Gryffindors near the end of the table and scanned the table for his so-called 'enemy' Draco. Harry assumed that he would be back for the 8th year, even though there were traumatic memories left here. Harry promised himself that he would try to make it up to Draco after what Draco and Narcissa had done for Harry.
The next few weeks went by without much happening, classes went by, and Draco regained his spot at the top of all his classes, mostly since Hermione wasn't there to give him a run for his money. Draco and Harry were paired up in almost every class, including potions (almost like the teachers have a bet to see when they'll come out 🤷🏼♀️). Harry was crap at potions, so Draco helped him out on more than one occasion. Draco and Harry's friendship grew as well, but both were still feeling the War's repercussions. They both had frequent nightmares. Neither of them knew how to stop the dreams.
Once they added shriveled wolf skin and stirred the cauldron-like the board indicated, the potion turned bright pink, and a smoke cloud puffed out and turned into a heart in the air. Draco didn't think when he blurted out,
"Potter, I'm sorry for the past seven years; I was a real prick, wasn't I." He was so close to crying and let out a choked sob turned into a laugh. "You got me back for it, though, and I guess karma did too." Harry felt terrible. He remembered Hermione punching him, the midnight duel, the Triwizard tournament, the Dark Mark, the War, the Sectumsempra curse.
"Savior of the wizarding world, and he gets choked up by a couple of scars." Draco had tears running down his face at this point.
"not anymore. Hurt like a bitch when you cast it, though." Draco laughed as if it was a fond memory instead of one that could have killed him. Some of the scars crisscrossed one another and went from shoulders to just below the waistband of his jeans.
Expect one more chapter today (that I haven't written yet but I have a draft in my head) then considering how these few months have gone, I'll have 2 more in 2 months (:
Half an hour had passed before the doors to the Great Hall opened with a flourish, and a very different Draco Malfoy walked in. Harry looked up and gaped as Draco strutted towards him. Draco had dyed his hair a soft blue and had flowers tattooed up and down his arms. He had on muggle clothes that fit him well, black skinny jeans, and a grey short-sleeved shirt with the Draco constellation on it. Draco also had a ring in his lip, which Harry remembered vaguely being called a snake bite, which seemed fitting. Harry had never seen Draco this unhinged, and he guessed it was the combination of the war trauma and his father locked away in Azkaban.
"Now you know why I covered my dark mark in them, right? Because of my mom? Make fun of it if you will, Harry, get it over with." Harry was happy to note that tired morning Draco was significantly less of a git than regular Draco.
"disgusting! Potter, it smells like your soap. It's all I can smell, just cedar and mothballs!" Harry wasn't thinking either when he retorted,
"It doesn't matter now. All that matters is that I take better care of myself, and I learn from my past." Harry wondered when he became such a philosophical person, and he could see that Draco was thinking the same thing.
A few minutes later, Draco came out in more muggle clothing, which surprised Harry more now, considering there wasn’t anyone to judge him about being from a pureblood family, or from being on the wrong side of the war. He was wearing a severely oversized light blue muggle shirt with the phrase 'et Enfin, Je vois la lumière'. Harry had no idea what that meant, but he knew from what little gossip he heard that wasn’t about him that most pureblood families spoke French before they spoke English, so he assumed that it was a French phrase. He was also wearing very short dark green quidditch shorts, but they seemed to be more for comfort than physical ability. Harry had a bit of a hard time looking away from Draco at this point, but he eventually forced himself to look at Draco's face, feeling his face flush red. Draco seemed too tired to notice though, and got into his bed without another word to him.
"We should get to class before Slughorn (I almost wrote Snape) gives us detention again," Harry spoke into the thick silence in the room.
Harry was in the dorm, trying to write Hermione and Ron about the term so far. He didn't want to come out and say that Draco was his friend because both of them would be furious. He started by talking about how Draco had changed, and Harry remembered the flowers on Draco's arms. Harry wanted to know what they were, and whenever Harry brought it up, Draco brushed it off without acknowledging it. Draco was supposedly asleep with one arm carelessly thrown over his eyes, exposing his forearm and tattoos. Harry decided to sketch a quick picture for Hermione to research. Harry began to draw, looking ever so often to Draco's arm. After about five times glancing at Draco's arm, however, Draco grumbled,
"It doesn't still hurt, does it, the- the" Harry gestured vaguely to his chest and stomach. Eventually, Draco understood and pulled off his shirt so Harry could see the even paler scars against his already pale torso. Harry lifted his hand to his mouth, noticing the malnutrition. He had looked that way himself until about two years ago. Draco finally spoke up,
The flowers, he found out, were a specific type called a Narcissus. Harry took a wild guess as to why Draco had Narcissus on his arms. By that time, Draco had woken up, wrapped himself in his blanket, and had placed his head on Harry's shoulder to read the letter.
"Is that so..." Mrs. Weasley said. "Well, try to eat a bit, Harry. You need it. So you could recover from what had happened to you"
"Potter." He spoke as a greeting. "What brought you here so early morning when we don't have any classes? Shouldn't you be goofing around or lazing in the bed like a pig?"

"What's this?" I asked as I smelled the fragrance, it was surprisingly mouthwatering and had a calming effect on me.
"Mr. Malfoy, she just hurled insults to you. I will give the due punishment to her bad behavior, rest assured. But in your case, injuring a student is a means of expulsion." She said sternly.
'Shut up!' I shouted at her in mind but I can't help as almost agreed with her. Ron's plate is a mess. The plate was shoved under my nose and as I caught the scent of chicken. I, suddenly, became sick. My stomach turned and twisted horribly. Perspiration broke out from my skin and drenched me, my head begins to swim and I felt dizzy and cold.
I woke up, surprised. It was very rare that I would have a good night's sleep without any dreams or disturbances with my overwhelming senses. Maybe that tea did help.
"Granger, this is my decision and I need time to think. Please do respect my opinion and my rights even though Slytherins and Gryffindors are not in good terms with each other," he said in a mature manner.
"Yes, indeed. Albus." Snape sneered at the headmaster. He turned towards the door while he slowly pulled Malfoy to leave. As they did so, Professor McGonagall turns to us. "Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, and Ms. Granger will you be needing me in this discussion?"
"That's none of your business, Potter!" He said in anger. As he was gaining his confidence with every second that passes by.
"How about your friends, Harry?" He asked again. "The others? Professor Lupin? Sirius, your godfather?"
"I have been researching these past few days before I escape from Hogwarts. In those books, there have been clues on what might have happened and what have you become, Harry." Hermione stated as she absent-mindedly reminisces her facts hunting in the library. "I tried feeding you fresh animal blood and it seems like it kind of work out. And I am here because I am your friend, Harry. What a silly question!"
