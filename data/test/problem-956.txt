They took their time to have lunch. Afterwards they walked around a bit. When they re-entered the Court, a specialist in charms was explaining the spells used by Dunne. It was a classic repertoire of black magic, not perfectly mastered. When the jury retired to deliberate, Nikolaj briefed Draco and Harry on what Dunne had revealed. She was part of an organisation of pseudo-justicians who had decided to turn the spells of Voldemort's former supporters against them.
"Sweetheart? Where's Daddy?"
"You know, Lucius, I'm always torn in such situations between thanking you and wanting to lock you up so you don't walk free with all that knowledge of dark magic, suppliers and unknown spells."
"What did you want to do? Deliver me to Voldemort?"
Harry wanted to shout to the whole platform that he was going to be a dad, but he didn't. He didn't, because he didn't know. Draco had said yes, but that didn't make Harry's sperm any more effective. He'd never succeeded, with Ginny. And his brief hope that he could carry their child himself had quickly faded after the test he'd done.
"The neighbourhood is very quiet, don't worry about me. But thanks! I love feeling like a princess in a limo."
The event was making a bit of a mess of the department, and the Chief Auror himself got his nose out of his paperwork for once. When he arrived by Portkey express, he escorted the French superior in question to Harry's office and gave him a cautious look that meant 'no nonsense, no diplomatic accident'.  The Frenchman entered the office, and Harry used all his self-control. He wore a leather satchel and a beige trench coat that made him look like an actor. He exchanged a frank handshake with Harry.
"Shh. Close your eyes. What do you want, gorgeous?" Harry stroked his face with his fingertips. His forehead, his ears, his nose, his cheekbones, his lips. Every precious part of him.
"Wait. Thank you so much for tonight."
Harry set the table in the dining room. He even brought out the candles. Draco set the plates. Harry took care of the wine. When it was time to sit down, Draco couldn't bear the thought of being separated from Harry by the width of the table. He approached Harry and slid onto his lap. Harry smiled at him and wrapped his arms around his waist. "Are you okay?"
There was no more shouting. Only silence. Harry could hear his own muffled breathing. It wasn't his breathing - it was his laughter.
"As long as you don't mind..."
"Ask them if I'll have my voice back by the end of January."
"Ron," sighed Harry.
"Is that good pain, my love, my slave?"
Oh Salazar. Draco was in love with him.
Harry changed his clothes, humming, and went home to Scorpius.
"Hello!" Harry smiled, trying not to look ridiculous.
"I think I might be for a little while."
"Especially if you just need that." Callum's smile widened.
Harry got out from under the duvet to look for Chocolate Frogs on the coffee table. Throughout Draco's story they had gone through three cups of tea each, then the kitchen to make lunch and the dining room to eat, and the couch again for dessert, and later the goûter - cakes, sweet things around four o'clock, a French habit that Harry had adopted all too easily from the Malfoys. Eating gave them something to do with their hands. It gave Draco a chance to catch his breath, and when he had something in his mouth, Harry was less likely to interrupt him without thinking.
Scorpius was literally stamping his feet, in his blue trousers and little linen shirt. He had been desperate for a schoolbag just like Daphne and Theo's twins had - they had started nursery school the year before. The schoolbag was a little too big for him, but he held the straps with pride, his smile showing his bright white teeth.
But Draco knew he shouldn't play the fool, even mentally. If he'd remarked that male pregnancies were possible in front of Hermione and Ron, maybe that meant something. Maybe a part of him was trying to lay down a hypothetical groundwork for the future.
And suddenly it was time for Draco to drop his barriers. There was just no reason to keep such a wonderful man at a distance.
The next day was a Thursday. Harry spent it on cloud nine, a little dizzy. Before leaving, he went to HR and asked if it would be possible to stop working on Wednesdays. He was immediately told yes in a surprised tone, either because he had accumulated a lifetime of leave or because the Savior wanting to work less was so unlikely that they feared he might be in danger of burn-out.
They raised their glasses.
Soon Harry felt Draco's dick twitch, felt his cum against their stomachs. He slowly jerked him off some more, emptying him to the last drop without stopping kissing him. He felt like cupping Draco's face with both hands, but his right hand was covered in sticky lube and they couldn't use magic to clean it all up. He settled for using just one hand. Oh, how Draco's skin was soft.
"You're a bloody imbecile," Harry said quietly when the tears had passed enough for him to find his voice. "You're not going to die at all. And I can think of a million scenarios for our story that would be far better than your death.You're always so melodramatic."
The medical staff were flabbergasted by the trips he offered them. After so long on the ward, Draco had come to know everyone, and he was strangely moved by their gratitude. He should be the one to be grateful. They were almost as pale as he was - Draco was certain that many of them had not been on holiday for years. He hoped that a bit of sunshine with their families would show his appreciation for not letting him choke to death on one of the many occasions it had almost happened.
"And you still look after his son."
Once inside, Callum carried Malfoy to the bathroom, where a Jacuzzi sat. He kissed his hair and asked him to undress, and Malfoy did.
Draco felt his lip tremble as Harry kissed his hand again with all the love in the world. He seemed to be close to tears. Draco retrieved his hand to write on the board. I'm okay. To his horror this seemed to make Harry even more emotional, but he managed to hold back the tears.
"I don't want you to think I'm trying to shut you out," said Harry. "You are a friend to me too, and I thank you for helping me with Draco, and for introducing me to BDSM. I know consciously that you're not an obstacle to my relationship with him, in fact you've been an indispensable intermediary. It's just a bit... confusing for me, I suppose, sometimes. I've always been in classic monogamous relationships. I'm afraid I don't measure up."
Draco restrained himself from smiling, but a small smirk got the better of him.
"Is it time for the awkward anecdote I've been keeping for two years?" asked Blaise with a smile worthy of Salazar Slytherin.
"Aren't you going to get some sleep at home?" asked Harry. Callum didn't stay up all night, but the big chair wasn't the most comfortable bed, and if he'd felt Draco move a millimetre, knowing him, he'd kept his eyes open all night.
"It's possible. Thomas ran into a lot of people in college. The bastard could have passed himself off as a fellow student."
"I wasn't trying to trick you. But if I had asked you, you would have said no."
And Draco knew that Harry Potter loved him.
The music was languid and loving. Harry caught himself doing a few dance steps before allowing himself a near-total burst of joy, very glad that no one could see his pitiful dancing skills. Draco was fine. Draco would be fine.
"We're not going to talk about Jules..."
"Harry." Harry turned his eyes to Ron, who grabbed the back of his neck. "I know how to do my job. If she's guilty, she'll pay. It's for justice that we did all this, isn't it? Those eight years. If she's guilty, she'll be treated as such."
In June, Harry was caught up in a long and perilous mission that had him working long and hard. When the suspects were finally arrested, Harry took a prolonged holiday. No guilt, no excuses. He, Draco and Scorpius spent ten days on a heavenly hiking trail in Corsica: walking all day along the coastline, following the relief of the trail, and resting every night in small, comfortable hotels or guesthouses.They had invested in a special baby carrier, and Scorpius loved being walked through the beautiful countryside by his two favourite people in the world, loved being all alone with them and all their attention, loved napping on Draco in a hammock in the shade of the olive trees, loved the sand, the sea, the waves, the translucent water, the little fish, and the French bread, and the apricots, and the cherries, and even cheese.
"Who, then?" asked Harry. "His parents?"
"Magical, basically. It depends on the person. I feel like I'm slowly falling into a huge body of water. I float and fall at the same time, but I feel safe. Loved, mostly. I don't really know who I am anymore, where I am, and yet I know I am exactly where I need to be in the universe."
"Ask me."
"I... I want to be a good slave to you, Master."
Draco smiled at him and let him put his son to bed. Harry always watched his cooking show with him when he was at home. At first he didn't seem to understand the issues too much, but now he was taking ideas to cook and was very invested in the scores of the respective brigades. It was cute.
"Indirectly. I work at the same salon as Benjamin, and I've seen Master pick him up some nights. I told Benjamin about him..."
"Maybe it's because you think it is that I feel like you are special. That our relationship is special. You don't see it as a burden, or an effort, or an act. You just see me as... Harry. Sometimes I think... maybe it's stupid. But you're one of the few people I've ever directly, truly hurt in my life unjustly. Physically. The Sectumsempra curse. And it's like it contributes to the fact that... you understand that I'm flawed and human."
"Sorry. But if I was going to die, I could afford to touch you at least once, right?"
Draco expected to be naked in thirty to ninety seconds, but that wasn't in Harry's plans. He pulled him into his garage, passed his motorbike and stood in front of a wall with dozens of the latest racing brooms attached to it, making a wide gesture saying 'your choice'.
Tell me what you liked, tell me what you'd like to see (plot-wise and smut-wise)... And maybe
Apparently they both needed unlimited Thai food now.
Salem jumped up on the table, looking for a petting. Immediately overexcited, Scorpius stomped his little feet under the table, clearly not interested in the last few spoons of his lunch. Draco talked to him happily for a few minutes while also stroking the cat, who was purring happily. Scorpius had fun tugging at Draco's long hair and sticking his nose in it, apparently enjoying the fresh smell of his shampoo. Draco gently unclenched his little fists. "Was it Harry who looked after you this morning? Was it fun?" Scorpius squealed in delight. "Oh yes. Papa enjoyed his morning too. Thanks, Harry."
Harry shrugged. There were stranger things, as far as female fantasies went. "What about her?"
"Are you still with me?"
"You obviously have major decency issues, Mr Malfoy. I can't help you."
Oh Merlin. Harry was in love with him.
Harry did not seek to have sex with Draco. There was something even more intimate about being in someone's bed not because they had just fucked your arse or were planning to, but simply because they wanted you there.
Scorpius loved being the centre of attention even more than his father. Seeing all the adults around him gushing over him, playing with him, talking to him, wanting to hold him, far from intimidating him, pleased him immensely. He babbled and looked people straight in the eye, convinced that he was having a real conversation with them. Harry was sure that he would talk early and well - Draco had been talking to him since he was born, in French and English, and Harry had resumed his habit of speaking to him as if he were an adult, and naming their surroundings repeatedly. The baby recognised more and more things. If he was asked for a particular object, he knew which one to take and give, whether by colour, shape or name. When Blaise stole Scorpius for a moment to shower him with compliments and praise in Italian, Scorpius looked at him with frowned brows for a moment, obviously aware of the strangeness of his words, before trying to repeat Italian words stubbornly.
is the rope guy?"
"He's getting cuter by the minute," Harry said, watching Scorpius sleep. Draco kissed his husband's cheek, stroked his face.
Lola appeared in their field of vision.
Draco was thoughtful for a moment, and Harry looked at him with a touch of concern. Was he afraid Draco would blame him? Draco was rather pleasantly surprised. Sex-wise, he was going to be out for a while, and he wasn't keen on sleeping with a wood-hard cock stuck to his back for weeks on end, moans of excitement in his ear and unexpected ejaculations soiling the sheets at night just because Potter was used to monogamy.
"I'll make a note of that, Mrs Malfoy." She nodded, as if it wasn't really important. But it was, to her.
"Courtesy of Harry Potter!" she replied without even having to get up from her desk to see what was troubling him.
"But you do think about him sometimes?"
Harry ended the spell. His hands had started to sting from the cold.
"He'll probably clean him up," Benjamin said with a shrug. "Wanna make friends, Leo? What do you say? Quidditch connoisseurs? Orion's Doms tour?"
When he saw him enter the living room, his son immediately screamed from his babysitter's arms, holding out his hands to him. "Good evening, Madeleine," Draco said politely anyway before taking Scorpius from her. The young woman reminded him a little of Astoria. She was always dressed to the nines, her cheeks rosy and her eyeliner in place, sophisticated outfits even for going out to the park. And when she saw Draco, she spontaneously gave him wide, sparkling smiles. With her very long blonde curls and curvy body, she looked like the springtime incarnation of a Renaissance painting.
"No."
"I can do it, if everyone agrees," Harry assured them. He wasn't great at Legilimency, but he'd had to do it a few times on missions, and he had the hang of it overall.
"You can move."
After a moment of looking through the glass, side by side, Draco found himself bursting into tears.
"I... Hermione made cupcakes."
"Absolutely," said Harry. "All the staff involved. For their feelings about the war, about Purebloods, Slytherins, Death Eaters, and specifically about you, Draco. With Veritaserum, and with some Legilimens I know who were willing to help me out. And Blaise and Pansy found a spell. One that guarantees perfect loyalty? I think it's a variation of an Unbreakable Promise."
"Oh, right."
Harry looked at his best friends, and had the unsettling feeling that so much was separating them. His life had been turned upside down in not even three months. Draco was a hurricane. The BDSM had changed him too. He felt... more focused, more confident. Having such responsibility over someone for an hour, an evening, a night gave him a sense of control over his own life even in his everyday activities.
"I'm not afraid of him, you know." Draco had a playful smile on his face, but Harry wasn't entirely sure of that statement. Draco probably didn't know what to expect. As far as Harry knew, he had managed not to be alone with his father for years.
"Just one pan, okay? I understand you're curious about what I do in the kitchen, but I don't have time for us to bake a cake or a pie together tonight." Scorpius sniffled.
"You're doing everything you can, Draco. He hasn't been exposed to an ounce of magic since his diagnosis. It goes in his favour. And there are some nice things in the Muggle world, meanwhile. I think Scorpius would like Disney World, and water parks, and the circus, the cinema, trampoline parks..."
He was holding his head up. For the moment. In the eyes of those who cared about him, he led a balanced life. Work, nights out, sex life. In their eyes of tired young parents, his life was to be envied. He was free, young, handsome, rich, influential. They didn't see that he wasn't doing anything about it. That he couldn't make anything of it. That the work hid a sense of uselessness since the end of the war, of not fitting in, and a slight suicidal streak if Harry honestly considered how many times he ended up at St Mungo's each year. That the nights out hid an increasing consumption of alcohol and a budding drug habit.
"I don't mind being used as a cardio equipment," Orion added mischievously.
"You're really serious," Blaise smiled. "With Draco."
The big green eyes, without glasses that day, looked at Draco as if they were discovering him for the first time. Draco shook him out of his lethargy with a chaste kiss and lifted the victorious broom of his choice. Harry chose an old, luxurious model that looked as if it had already been well used.
"Colt made a prawn curry and I'd picked up some pastries on the way home from work, but do you want me to make you some treacle tart? I won't be long." Draco always made him food himself when Harry had had a bad day. It was so special and efficient on Harry's mood that Harry had started doing the same for Draco, hoping it would provide the same comfort.
'Our son'. Harry was still crazy happy to hear it.
Harry stroked his hair, his back. Oh, that was good. That was nice. Feather-light touches. Harry gently took his face and placed it against his chest, as if on a pillow. The ringing in Draco's ears ceased, and he realized Harry was whispering to him. "I love you. You're safe. You've been perfect. You gave me so much pleasure, pet. You're the most beautiful person on this planet. My wonderful, wonderful good boy. No one has ever turned my brain around like you do. I belong to you. I love you. I will worship you all the days of my life..." That's what the gentle movements of his hands seemed to mean too.
"Revenge for Harry's curse, for instance? Which nearly killed you? You named your company after that damn spell. There's obviously something wrong with you."
"You say that, but I'm reading you. I am in your brain." The tree was no longer green, but orange. Melancholic tinkling sounded. "You are angry with her."
"Gentle," Harry completed. "I would never have believed it, from the outside, but... He's so loving."
"Oh, this is going to be the best part. Orion's fallen into what we call subspace. That he responded to his Dom with words in this state is already a great proof of trust and understanding between them. "
Draco breathed in and looked away so he wouldn't see how Jules would react to that, watching the scene Potter's enchanted windows were showing that day - a Slavic forest with a downpour of rain. Cheerful.
Malfoy was a problem.
Draco turned to pick up his notebook.
"Yes, he thought it was a great way to get news from the hospital, instead of waiting like all the other Wizards for a letter 12 hours later. He doesn't really know how to use it, but calling is fine."
"Hi, Harry. Sorry, I know it's late... Is Draco at your place, by any chance?"
Draco had a complex and noble signature. Harry was so engrossed in watching him sign it in quill and ink, without smudging, without making a mess, that Draco had to remind him with a small smile to sign it too. Wendy put the papers above a transparent glass under which colours crackled. Fake white flames rose, the papers disappeared, and more came out of a slot on the desk.
"Yes. It was Thomas' body. Selwyn came out of it just before the explosion."
Draco and Harry stayed until the last possible minute. The hut was full of warmth and camaraderie. Their host had plenty of anecdotes about all of Draco's clumsiness and fears the first time he'd found himself living in such a rustic and isolated environment, but Draco defended himself tooth and nail as he sought Harry's sympathy - "screaming is a perfectly appropriate response to coming face to face with a Kikimore on your way to pee outside at three in the morning!" The deeply magical forest was infested with sometimes very large and seriously dangerous creatures, some of which the dragons fed on.
Draco nodded without looking at Harry. "Wait. I have to... I'll be right back."
"You lost on purpose," Harry accused as they made their way to McGonagall's office, the students having reluctantly returned to class for the last two periods of the day.
When he came back down to the kitchen, Draco was ready to cancel lunch.
The answer was: very simply. There were about fifty of them working in the Reserve, isolated from the rest of the world. Harry had spotted a large communal vegetable garden by the newborns' building. Krzyszek's house was on a plain, within the Reserve but away from the dragons' territories, surrounded by protective spells. It was a log building on one level. In front of it was an aromatic garden with curious plants and a huge stone washhouse filled with water. Inside, there was a single, rather dark room. Harry hadn't seen anything so wizardly in a long time. Herbs and plants hung from the ceiling, there wasn't even a knife in the kitchen, no electricity, no plumbing. The floor was stone, the fireplace huge. Everything looked as if it had been made by hand, if not entirely by the owner - the wood was dense and of good quality, the furniture fitted together perfectly, as if made to measure, and one could sometimes see in the objects, in the furnishings, places where the wood had been trimmed a little too much, where the welding of the metal had been corrected. Draco seemed delighted to be back in the familiar surroundings, which he had not been in for years. Harry was full of curiosity. He couldn't imagine Draco Malfoy living in a Dragonologist's hut.
"I married you."
"Draco left me."
"Don't worry," Callum laughed. "I was only joking. Draco won't blame you for that. He'll just be pissed because of his stupid game with Blaise."
With each wave of negative emotion, he increased the pace, the intensity, until Malfoy's hands slid across the table, until the table vibrated, until he didn't know if it was his magic or Malfoy's that was responsible. The vibrations did wonders to his cock, and presumably Malfoy's, left untouched, for he began to moan wildly and rub himself against the table. Harry spanked him and reached out to wank him. Draco straightened up, and Harry took him standing.
Draco looked at him stupidly. "So you really don't mind?"
"Next weekend?" Harry persisted, trying to put that painful 'I have a family' in a small corner of his head where it would only hurt later.
Hermione kissed Ron lightly and smiled at Harry before disappearing upstairs. Harry had stopped worrying about her atypical sleeping patterns and didn't comment on the fact that she might not sleep tonight by napping so late. He had no idea. He had no children.
"Good evening. Thank you. What's for dinner tonight?" Blaise asked them. "We're celebrating progress in Draco's state."
"Death Eater scum," spat his attacker as he kicked him.
"I've never been such a diligent student. I'm taking more notes at the Baby Dom Academy than I did at Hogwarts."
"Fucking a female sub in one of the lounges," Draco replied, wrinkling his nose. "I really need to get used to this whole bisexual thing before it makes me ask him for monogamy."
Harry kissed him until he feared his delicious dinner was going to get too cold. He pushed Draco towards the living room and they sat down to eat on the sofa, Draco his fruit, Harry his pasta delight. They sat on opposite sides of the same sofa, their legs stretched out and tangled in the middle. Draco wasn't as comfortable as Harry, gloriously in his pants, in his classy shirt and trousers, but Harry winked encouragingly at him as he at least took off his tie."You're getting slutty, Malfoy."
"Are you going to be my fairy godmother so I don't misstep?" Harry asked.
"Thanks, Harry."
Draco sat down in the same chair as last time, opening the button of his jacket. He hadn't bothered to change into robes, and Harry watched his Muggle three-piece suit, grey tie and new shirt carefully. Draco looked a little out of place, opposite Harry in his scarlet robes, in an office where magic was swarming everywhere. Paper aeroplanes flew over the desk, the fluorescent umbrella was still spinning in the corner, and the two enchanted windows showed a tropical jungle landscape that day. Far from the carefully designed eclecticism of Draco's office, here nothing seemed to go together, the office's elegance parasitized by pragmatic elements - the metal shelves, the stacked files, the leftover coffee that seemed to contribute greatly to Auror Potter's survival.
"For some, yes... For others..." Draco tapped his foot against the floor. He looked down at his fingers. "It's the people who hurt me. Some of them came out of the war okay. There wasn't much evidence against them. Or they hadn't done much for Voldemort, objectively. After my first year in France, when I reconnected a bit with the English wizarding news, I noticed that all the... people who had harmed me and were free had been found dead or were missing. The same when one was released from prison. A few months later, he would disappear from the face of the earth."
"I had bruises afterwards, you know. From how tight you'd held on to me on the broom. It hurt."
"You're right, I'll grow a womb."
Draco had just sat down again when Nora knocked on the door and opened it slightly to announce the arrival of the first patient of the day. She nodded towards Draco, who nodded back. She smiled from ear to ear. The doctor put his hand on Draco's shoulder and smiled, "I love to start the day with good news. I've seen so much of you in the last few weeks that I feel like you've been trying for several years."
"With pleasure, my love."
"Your marriage was... Happy, overall. But there was never any conjugal or carnal love."
"What about yours?" he asked.
Thomas was making strange noises, halfway between desperation and excitement. He was shrinking a little in Harry's mouth, and Harry redoubled his efforts to bring him back to hardness. Callum touched his shoulder after a few minutes, and Harry straightened up. Callum's unoccupied hand replaced his mouth, not really jerking the submissive but caressing him pleasantly. Harry opened his mouth stupidly as he saw Callum's other hand shoved wrist-deep into Thomas' hole. The handcuffs weren't superfluous, because he was squirming as if unconsciously, not really trying to back away but fidgeting all the same. His bent legs were shaking, he was short of breath. Callum was barely moving his hand at the moment.
He didn't see Ron storm out of the house, wand raised, but he did hear Harry getting angry with him.
"I didn't want there to be any losers. Reinforcing the antagonism between the houses by our visit would be a bit counterproductive, wouldn't it?" As Harry looked at him with admiration and love, Draco held back a smile. "I'm not twelve anymore, Potter. I have other ambitions than winning at Quidditch."
For their very last scene as Dom and sub, Callum and Draco - or Callum, perhaps, Harry didn't know - had chosen breathplay.
Several of you have guessed the identity of Dunne's murderer, I congratulate you! All your suggestions made sense, though.
So the cycle continued. Work at the Ministry, Aurors' missions, which occupied most of his life. After that, visits to his friends, sometimes charity evenings at the Ministry, sometimes a few rounds at the bar opposite the Ministry with his colleagues. Then there were the Muggle bars where he couldn't really be himself, or the wizarding bars where he put on an utterly fake face. The same cycle, round and round and round.
The simple words moved Harry.
"Yes, I didn't take it this morning."
Harry wanted to tell him it wasn't. He needed to believe that it wasn't too late, that people could get past these prejudices. But he didn't really have an argument for that, and didn't venture to give one.
Draco's heart was beating so hard Harry could feel it against his chest. It echoed the whispers of the place.
"Alright, Draco. I'm here. I'll take care of you. I'll make your clothes disappear, okay?"
Harry kissed him chastely and drew him in sitting next to him, wrapped in one of his arms, choking with affection for the man. "Drink. Eat." Harry untied the apron knot and reverently stroked the soft bare skin. Then he removed the cockcage, cast a cleansing spell, and withdrew the plug, making the objects disappear into the dressroom. He slid between Draco's thighs and used his tongue to clean the cum which dripped irregularly from Draco's dilated and tired hole, never taking his eyes off Draco's face. The blond was breathing hard, very aroused, looking at Harry with suddenly wide open and wide awake eyes. "Eat," Harry insisted with a smile before reapplying his tongue around the pink hole. Draco ostensibly took a piece of toast and ate it over a plate as he continued to watch what Harry was doing.
"Sweetheart, it's been a year and a half."
And just like that, Draco passed out. Not in subdrop, not in subspace. Simply unconscious.
"You didn't come to see me at the Ministry. Nor to the post office," he clarified.
Harry took Draco's hand and held on to it.
"Exactly what we agreed. She gave birth to Scorpius, stayed for about a month, during which time we pretended that she was suffering terribly from the aftermath of childbirth. And then I told everyone she was dead. We buried a body that was not hers, in Provence. And she changed her face permanently. She got false papers and a new wand. And she went to start a new life in Southeast Asia. With Clara. That was their dream. The letter I was reading... It was from them. We limit contact as much as possible so as not to run any risks, but they heard about my injuries and wanted to hear from me."
Harry eventually laid Scorpius down in bed. In the hallway he and Draco embraced tenderly. "I have to be back by midnight," Harry warned. Draco nodded. He kissed him. Harry held his face preciously in his hands. Draco rubbed the tip of his nose against Harry's beard, breathing in the smell of the beard balm he loved. "I am blessed by the gods to be your husband."
"That's completely true. It's one of the reasons my dad wanted to send me to Durmstrang. They're more oriented towards action, efficiency, magical precision, intuition."
Harry gave him his address. He wanted nothing more than to be as close to Draco as possible, but he knew what his boyfriend would have wanted, and he would be up to it. Or at least he would try.
After hours of silence, the world was too noisy for Draco's ears. He could hear the sirens, the cars, the shouting, the sound of footsteps on the floors and outside. After hours of smelling nothing but the asceptized clean odor of the hall, his nose too was assaulted by unusual smells, aggressive, chemical, burnt things, sweat, blood, including his own. He closed his eyes and breathed several times. In the waiting, he had only wanted Harry. In the chaos, he still only wanted Harry.
He gave the last letter to Draco's owl, and smiled as he turned his attention back to the radio, recognising the song that had just started.
Harry was overcome with a wave of warmth and hugged Draco so tightly that he was conscious of crushing him a little. Every now and then he felt Draco's hiccups against his chest. And then even that faded away.
"You are dangerous," he growled.
Harry nodded.
"Sure." Harry helped him get dressed. Draco remained shirtless, displaying his back proudly in the club. They had a few drinks, watched scenes, talked to people. Draco was clearly at the end of his evening, but Harry was made several offers, which he declined.
"Tell me."
"Hi," Draco greeted him in his brain.
"Draco Malfoy, I love you."
They introduced themselves, shook hands, and chatted with the Muggle single mother who still hadn't quite recovered from having a member of the Ministry come to the clinic a few days after her delivery to tell her that her daughter was a witch. It was one of the novelties that the post-war generation had brought. A child's magic was notified long, long before she or he received a letter to Hogwarts - for safety, and for the psychological well-being of the child and its family, to accompany their questions, their wild displays of magic.
Callum lost himself in pleasure, perfectly still and passive, almost silent.
The returning Portkey was arriving in their neighbourhood park. Harry and Draco walked quietly home, hand in hand. The area was not very homophobic.
Draco rubbed his eyes. He'd sat down in one of the chairs, pulled his legs up to his chest. He kept his wand in his hand at all times. It made him feel like he had more control over the magic flowing out of him.
Callum decided on a white polo shirt, which he put on. He turned back to Draco and was about to say something when he noticed the box and the wizard's serious face. He sat cross-legged in front of him, seeking his gaze. Draco kept his eyes down. Callum opened the box.
It was nine o'clock when Harry awoke to an empty bed. He found an energy potion on his bedside table and gulped it down happily, welcoming the artificial sensation of a long night's sleep. He used the bathroom en suite. Nothing could be done about hir hair. He pulled on a silk dressing gown from the wardrobe and helped himself to a crystal decanter and, well, this time he really felt a bit like Pretty Woman.
After a few minutes of quiet contemplation, Lucius and Narcissa looked ready to join the table. Harry withdrew his hand and watched in amusement as Draco's parents gave each other very discreet squeezes, holding back their smiles, to decide who could sit closest to the pram. Lucius finally sighed and pulled the desired chair for his wife, moving it closer to the table once she was seated. He sat down next. "The Muggles do make some strong liquor, don't they?"
The two wizards did not get bored. Staff from the orphanage kept greeting Harry as they passed, and children came to talk to him without any shyness. When a small group of boys demanded that he take part in their water fight, Harry did not hesitate.
His friend's dark eyes looked at him with calm and love. "I know you," he said simply. Draco took his hand.
Harry waited for him on the stoop as he made a quick dash to their magical house next door. He brought two vials of potions. "For your arse," he said with a shadow of a smile. Harry gulped them down and immediately felt much better. He checked that he had his wand, his ring, his badge, his first aid kit, his survival kit. Draco watched him with an unreadable eye.
"You just used magic to boil water, cut lemon, levitate four different things from your kitchen at the same time, without a word and without your wand." Draco observed.
Scorpius had a tantrum that morning, refusing point blank to stay with his babysitter. He cried so much that Harry seemed ready to call in sick, but Draco pointed out that if he did, he might as well quit because Scorpius would think that crying was enough to get one of his fathers to stay with him every day. They tried to reassure him and calm him down.
"I read the edict just this morning," Harry smiled. "Before the discovery... Before... I bumped into an official from the Morality Department in the corridors and he quietly lent it to me for a moment. It was the final version, everything is ready. They'll have it out within the week."
They passed an art gallery and one of the city's major pet shops.
Knowing that you appreciate this story is precious and motivates me to write. Thank you readers. After a frantic pace for the first chapters, I'm planning to post about a chapter a week - as it is, I spend all my free time and a good part of my nights writing, and I have to make time for my work and well-being. So don't worry if it slows down a bit: I'll keep posting, but just at a more sustainable pace.
Draco and Harry looked into each other's eyes the whole time.
But Harry did not touch his hole, did not penetrate it, concentrating on other parts of his body. Draco began to cry. Harry kissed his inner thighs, his balls. He had to do something to them soon. He wondered how much beating of a leather belt Draco could take on the delicate part of his anatomy. He wondered what kind of state it would put him in.
Harry buried himself in Callum. Fucking such a massive, brawny man was a strange sensation at first, his muscular buttocks preventing Harry from ramming his sex all the way inside him, but Harry quickly lost himself in the pleasure. His cock was going to resent this evening for days, but he certainly wasn't thinking about it at the moment. Callum's hole was hot and so wet, the muscles in his back absolutely magnificent. Harry decided he would go to the gym more often.
They looked into each other's eyes. They talked with their eyes.
Several Gryffindors frowned, preferring not to imagine too much about the content of the memories.
"Please. I'm going to cum."
Harry waited a few minutes after Jules left, but when Draco failed to give him a signal, he eventually returned to his office. Draco's face was impassive. He looked at Harry as he entered, but did not smile or say anything.
"What do you think? Polyjuice?"
Harry decided to save Scorpius's presents for the evening, in case he was in particular need of distraction after the day. They ate and Harry put on their coats. "We're both going out today," Harry explained. Madeleine had taken the baby for a walk a few times in the last few days, but Harry hadn't left the house with him.
Malfoy seemed to agree for a moment. But when Harry set about putting on his trousers, cursing the sweat that made the leather garment sticky, Malfoy stood up, reached over and pushed his chest with a steady hand to the middle of his sternum. Harry took a few steps back and felt his anger flare.
At this, Harry was divided. Happy to know that she hadn't intended to catch him off guard like that, that she hadn't intentionally made a baby with a man his family and Harry hadn't even met yet. But overwhelmed, too. Overwhelmed that years of trying, of calculating ovulation times, of hoping hadn't been enough for him, when the new guy had succeeded in a few months or maybe even weeks, by accident.
Harry fucked Blaise against a golden wall.
Reading Draco's fantasies, the markings of his hand telling Harry, just Harry, how many times he could do such and such a thing to him, how wild he could get while doing it, very quickly brought Harry to a raging erection. Of course, he had seen Draco in subspace before, in scenes, and he had discussed Draco's limitations with Callum on several occasions, but this was different, complete, exhaustive, and straight from Draco. The questionnaire included situations that Harry would never have thought of.
The birthday party in the garden of the Burrow had gone well. Fleur, who had spent a lot of time pregnant or breastfeeding in recent years, had been delighted to sip on Harry's arbitrarily chosen expensive wine while other adults gushed over her three beautiful children. Ron and Hermione had returned home early, tiny Rose having been inconsolable after a while and refusing to fall asleep anywhere but in her room. Ginny hadn't come, she was away abroad with the Harpies. If this had anything to do with the fact that she had a new boyfriend according to the tabloids, no one said anything.
Scorpius babbled and crawled between them, touching one cheek, one eye, obviously trying to convince them to get up. He shouted, rocking back and forth.
Harry was so immersed in the story that he had let his foot fall back. His head was resting in his hands, attentive and mischievous.
For the Sherlock Holmes-minded readers, here are some of the clues in the previous chapters that hinted at Scorpius' illness: the Orb Draco wore when he was home or out with his son, the fact that Draco never had wizards in his house and did not introduce Scorpius to any wizards but had no trouble doing so with Callum, Madeleine or Lola, that Draco did housework the Muggle way at his home, that Scorpius has only ever been seen in Muggle places, that Harry couldn't feel Draco's magical aura in the park, that Draco is suddenly capable of wandless magic and sometimes even goes out without his wand, that Lucius thought Scorpius was ill, that a bodyguard was mentioned several times near Draco when he was with Scorpius (because Draco couldn't magically protect him if they were attacked)...
Harry wore a large beanie that made him more or less anonymous, and hid Scorpius behind the flaps of his coat. He was ignored in the hall and corridors, but when he reached the top floor, where he knew all the day staff, he let his guard down a little. Everyone was raving about the Malfoy baby - from a respectable distance, without touching him.
"I know who he is," said Callum. "Draco Malfoy."
Of course he was interested. Draco was as jealous and possessive as a puppy dog with his master, apparently, after only two thrusts of Potter's cock. Going to see him at his office earlier had been a mistake. He'd already gotten too close to him, too open.
This was the first time Draco had ever given up on the sacrosanct Saturday night. Harry held back a smile and flipped the second pan of crêpes before anything burned because he was too distracted by his love for his future husband.
"I promise."
"Very well. Lie down on your back on the table."
"If anyone found out that I was using the Orb, I would face charges of black magic. I would be in trouble for using an Orb in my personal capacity without permission or a declared licence. And I would risk losing custody of my son. The Orb's solution is a bit... avant-garde. Usually, with children like Scorpius, either the wizarding parents agree to their becoming Squibs, or they are left in the care of Muggles until their magic is well developed. That was out of the question. And I don't want you to think I'm a terrible person for not wanting a Squib son. That's not the point, if he'd been born that way I would have accepted him. But he doesn't have to be. He can grow up to be an ordinary, happy little wizard and go to Hogwarts and have the life of every other child, if only I can juggle everything until he's ten or eleven. According to the doctors, he'll become less and less sensitive from the moment his accidental magic appears, and when he starts using a wand, the danger will be completely over."
Madeleine appeared, greeted Draco and took Scorpius for a walk in the park with his mates.
"Oh Salazar! Is it 2007 already?"
"Don't worry, it's an open evening."
"You can work anywhere except his face, his genitals, his left forearm and his belly from pubic to navel. No blindfold, and I want to stay in his line of sight. No anal. He can suck you off."
"I'm calling Blaise."
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. He looked like he'd seen a ghost, and Harry was a little pleased about it. It was a good sign if Draco couldn't stand his father. He really had to be out of the whole pureblood business. It was another small push forward for Harry on his way towards... He didn't really know. Towards believing that Draco could have changed. Draco. Harry'd done what he could, after the first time they had sex, but since he woke up the morning after the threesome, he couldn't mentally call him 'Malfoy' anymore.
Draco nodded, as if in thanks.
He completely understood that Draco needed time, or simply didn't have time for him. He had a business and a baby under a year old, of course he couldn't magically appear at Harry's doorbell every night, with his glorious appearance, his glorious smell, his glorious smirk. Harry understood. But he missed him. He hadn't changed his sheets since those two nights together. He shamelessly sniffed the pillow that still smelled like Draco's hair.
"Very well. You obviously need to be taken in charge by a steady hand, Mr Malfoy. I'm going to take the masochistic urge out of you."
"You should take me to the bedroom or I might disgrace myself on the hallway floor."
"None. Firstly, because only a handful of people in the world are sufficiently well versed in both Muggle technology and the wizarding techniques necessary to understand the system, and all of these people work for Sectumsempra. Secondly, because the whole system is riddled with safeguards. For example, if an unauthorised person tries to touch or use the device, he or she will be electrocuted, with no harm done to the rightful wearer of the device."
"Where are you?"
"I wonder who's going to give birth first," Harry said innocently from the carpet where he was making sure that Scorpius and Rose didn't rip each other' clothes in their excitement to see each other again.
Harry missed Draco so much that he thought his obsession was spilling over into his eyesight when he saw his name on the Aurors' weekly assignment board when he arrived at work on Monday. But 'Draco Lucius Malfoy' was there, on the magic scroll of Voldemort's ex-partisans to be routinely checked that week. Harry signed up for the job without a second thought. Sometimes these checks had turned into vendettas, and he wanted to protect Draco from anything that might go wrong. So Harry spent a week in a fillature with a rotation of other Aurors, mentally reassuring himself that he wasn't a lovesick psychopath, but that he was only making sure the rules were followed.
Before going to the underground, they stopped by Benjamin's salon. He needed to pick up something. Harry explored the huge shop curiously, fascinated by the works of art which moved to his eyes but seemed presumably still and normal to Thomas and Callum. Benjamin explained to him that he had an elaborate rotation system with his customers and employees so that Muggles would never attend any ostensibly magical projects.
"I was sure you had taken the Mark. And that you were doing shady things. But I didn't understand that the poison, the necklace... were your doing. I'm sorry."
"No." Still, Harry held him tighter against him.
Harry helped the blond man to his feet. He watched him quietly arrange his clothes and reach a hand towards the lift at the other end of the corridor. The room card, which had fallen there in their rush, flew precisely into his hand.
Thomas nodded, panting. "He's beautiful, Sir."
This was when they normally talked. Where they replayed the day, joked, talked about Scorpius, said loving words to each other. But they stayed in silence.
Scorpius burst out laughing and clapped. "Sss-sss-sss," he tried to imitate.
15 January 2007 - St Mungo's, London
"It wasn't me." Draco believed him. "Do you know who it might...?"
"Oh. It's not
"If it's distressing you instead of reassuring you, don't think about it," Callum said, his eyebrows furrowed in concern. "Save your strength. Do you want me to get something to eat?"
Oh Circe. For a daddy.
"I don't know, you tell me?"
Draco dried his hair and brushed his teeth, enjoying his late morning and the quiet. He had opened the windows, finding that the tables from the previous day and the equipment had all been put away. The birds were singing happily in the garden. It was close to noon. Draco finally put on a dressing gown and walked across the two gardens to the other house. The last signs of the party were the table legs marks in the lawn and the few pieces of confetti from the children's games still caught in the branches. Salem seemed interested in the little birds nestling in the trees at the back of the garden, but he still resolved to follow Draco with grace and haste.
Hermione and Ron needed time too. Harry knew that Hermione saw Draco at the baby swimming classes and suspected that they talked there, but he never asked. In the meantime, Harry didn't try to get the four of them together anymore. He sometimes saw his friends at the pub after work, but he didn't go to their house anymore. He didn't want to give Draco the impression that he was dispensable. And he didn't want to make his best friends think that everything could go on as before, ignoring the fact that he had a man in his life. He didn't blame them. He was just giving them time.
"Well, we'll just have to wait, then," sighed Draco. "Those idiots are lurking outside Sectumsempra every day to take pictures of me going in and out of the building. They'll be bored to death in three or four days."
They looked at each other for a long time, in silence, with little smiles that meant everything.
Draco shrugged. "It was my choice. Morally, the right choice would have been to die, so I wouldn't have hurt any innocent. But it would have hurt my mother, and I couldn't accept that. I did what I did. I understand that you're angry with me. I really do. But I did what everyone else did at the time: I did what I could."
"You've been driving me mad since 1991," Harry insisted.
Harry shook his head as if these assumptions were madness and knocked Draco off balance. He pretended to push Draco into the pool, but grabbed him firmly before he even got the bottom of his jeans wet.
When Harry returned, he had about the energy of a molten lava ball. Draco could feel his heat and fury radiating out to him. He opened his eyes, looking up at Harry standing before him. "So?" asked Draco.
Draco concentrated on grabbing the marker and writing without shaking too much, but it was evening and he had been tired from his many rehabilitation sessions. He gave up in frustration, and instead drew a heart on the whiteboard. Draco knew he could be true to his impulses with him. Callum wouldn't make fun of him. And Draco wouldn't risk breaking his heart.
"Please forget I said that?" sighed Harry.
Draco fell silent. He was at a loss for words. Silence stretched between them. The rain beat on the windows. Harry's choice of music blared low in the room. Salem was running excitedly behind a fake mouse that Harry had enchanted to outrun him, and the muffled sound of its paws could occasionally be heard.
"You'll have to let me babysit Scorpius every now and then," Blaise said quietly. "Pansy said she'd be willing to try for a new child only if I stayed clean for five years. Just eight months to go, now. I'm sure I'll make it. From the first day of rehab, even when I was puking my guts out and thinking I was going to die, I knew I wouldn't go back. There's too much at stake."
"If it's too painful for you to be around him, if it weighs too heavily on your guilt, that's okay. No one's forcing you to see him again."
"Oh Merlin. Wasn't it yesterday that we were supposed to take him to the fair?"
He breathed for a few minutes, reacquainting himself with the sensation he hadn't missed in three days.
"We want to try," Harry told him, and his heart beat fast as he said it.
"Oh?" noted Callum. "Are you hard to live with, pet?"
"So what was so urgent?"
Harry found the gold ring in the envelope.A line of a few millimetres separated the ring in two lengthways - a row of dozens of diamonds. Harry put it on his left ring finger. It fitted itself to the size of his knuckles. It was warm.
"I'm not going to question you for a suspected crime outside my jurisdiction, no. Especially since the person apparently responsible on the French side just dropped all charges."
"Good evening, sir. Any preference?"
"What a woman," Ron sighed, "She's better than all of us. That being said..."
Draco widened his eyes. "Okay."
"Have a good day, Harry."
Harry slapped his bottom a dozen times for good measure, and stopped. He slipped two magically lubricated fingers between Draco's burning buttocks, pressing against his quivering anus until he overcame the resistance. Draco moaned shamelessly. Harry deftly found his prostate and began to massage it with his fingertips. He took his time. The fire from Draco's butt and balls partially relocated in his channel, and he grunted under the strain of having to hold back his orgasm.
"Draco..." murmured Callum as a question.
"Was it a good idea, pet?"
"I didn't say you were a good person," she murmured, throwing away the carrot tops and peels and moving on to the turnips. "Only that you were a good father."
"A tub?"
"Do you know when you're going to have the ceremony yet?" asked Blaise.
Nikolaj categorically refused to let him leave by Apparition in his condition. He helped him get dressed. Draco's movements were slow and numb. Nikolaj handed him back his wand, his mobile phone, gave him a light, silky cloak, and accompanied him to the taxi he had ordered.
Draco frowned as he observed the needle. "There are automatic pistols too, but the result is not as good," Thomas explained.
"Seriously?" Harry huffed as he returned, nearly dropping the tray he was holding. The wheels seemed to click in Harry's brain, until he figured out who the last adults left were...
"You didn't tell me you could join us," Draco told the blond after he had embraced them both, tugging on his sleeve so that he sat at their table. "He helped me pick the route for the kayak," Draco explained to Harry. "And the restaurant."
Harry's mobile phone vibrated as he helped to calm a totally panicked woman. He let his colleague take over and jumped on his phone, but it wasn't Draco - it was his driver. "Jacob?"
"And money."
"I am. For now, anyway. He'll stay with me, but he'll resent me. He never had a family. I complain about my family all the time, but he never even knew his parents, and his adopted family, they were... I can't deprive him of a real family, Callum."
"We'll see about that in due course, okay? He's still a baby. I don't know what he'll say, but he knows you love him. He'll understand that you've done everything for him. For his future, for his safety. You're an amazing father."
Callum couldn't orgasm. His cock slipped out of Draco, and he removed the condom, and cleaned Draco's cum off his chest. Then he just pulled Draco against him. The reclining sofa was the perfect round shape, and they lay there for a moment entwined, like the living gods they were, Draco slowly taking in all his breath. Callum spoke, but it was impossible to make out his lips, pressed against Draco's head.
"To show everyone what could happen. What's going to happen, soon, and more and more, as a result of fooling around with Muggles. It's only a matter of time, but I wanted to speed things up a bit. Everyone believed it, you know, Potter. Everyone believed that a Muggle would turn on wizards overnight, because he was a Muggle, because they were wizards. I hardly had to do anything."
"Sex is allowed in the club, but not in the Chapiteau - the central hall. Condoms are compulsory - protective charms don't always work when you're in a daze, but if you trust them more, you can add them to the condom. Pushy flirting is not allowed, and the bouncers will be happy to escort you out if you annoy someone or a group. In particular, I advise you to stay away from guys who are on their knees, or on the ground, or naked, or wearing a collar, or a leash, or any other sign that they belong to someone. If you feel like playing with a sub who is already someone’s, you can politely introduce yourself to his Dom and have a chat with him."
"What I need to know is... Was it just sex? I thought that's what you wanted, but on your birthday..."
He sat back down in his own seat like a little boy at fault.
"This is the latest version," Brian explained. "The shield is infallible. It blocks all magic within its range, and prevents any magic from entering from the outside. Scorpius will be perfectly safe."
"I'm okay," Draco promised. "Don't worry."
"Well... If you'd be willing to lend me an Orb, I could wear it to your house or when we're with your son - well, if you'd be willing to have me come to your house or see Scorpius, that is."
Not too hard.
There were a few misses in Harry's breathing. They hadn't gone past the point of hugging and kissing since the explosion.
Harry looked at the face of the man he loved, as it had been before, when everything was fine. He sat up on his knees and kissed Draco's lips. He didn't feel anything, but he saw Draco's blush, he could hold his face in his hands one last time.
"Have you eaten?" asked Harry. Draco shook his head. This was new. Harry made him breakfast while he said hello to Scorpius, who immediately asked for a hug and a story. Draco's tea was a little cold once Scorpius agreed to let him stay away for a few minutes, but Draco sighed happily as he drank it and imperceptibly moved his chair closer to Harry's.
"Was that the case with all your exes?"
Draco knew he didn't just mean that sexually. And he was right. Harry had lived up to everything. He'd put up with Scorpius reaching the terrible age of two, he'd put up with Draco's reputation, and the media attention, and Lucius's death, and the millions, and the galas, and apparently even his late night proposal hadn't scared him off, or even his literally dangerous sexual appetite. Perhaps it was time for Draco to face the facts.
Scorpius was 90% the spitting image of Draco. But now that he thought about it, Harry could see a bit of Jules in him. Scorpius was a little less sharp, a little softer than the Malfoy. A little more handsome. His sparkling smile, the glow in his eyes, his skin, his hair. Jules had Veela blood. Scorpius had inherited it, no doubt. But not so much that Jules or anyone else would suspect that Scorpius was his offspring.
"What you need, Auror Potter, is to go to the hospital. The Chief Medical Officer at St. Mungo's is looking for you all over the Ministry. Your man is waking up."
Draco knew very, very well that Harry was perfectly capable of carrying out all these promises.
"I love you," he whispered in a low voice.
A mainly sexual chapter ending with something... other than sex.
"Don't ask," Potter sighed as he watched it.
"Oh, you're going to get a surrogate?" she asked, in a voice low enough for the children not to hear.
"No way. Neither of you goes anywhere near my ass for... for at least... well. A few days, I guess."
Harry smiled. "You’re not helpless, Draco. But you’re definitely cute."
Draco mimed being stabbed in the heart. Harry's chest felt warm. Draco was in the middle of his living room at night. Draco was with him, only him.
Harry felt a lump in his throat as he thought of all that Elena Dunne had taken from them.
Harry loved every second of it.
Harry didn't even notice the astonished looks of his colleagues. A surveillance like this screamed four to five days of non-stop work. And Harry had plans with Draco and Scorpius this week. They'd just spent their first weekend together, and he was having trouble getting back to work. He missed them.
"There had been acts of that sort on my property. When Astoria altered the appearance of a corpse so that it looked just like her and everyone could see her in her coffin. She did it herself. I didn't participate."
"You're amazing."
Harry nodded.
"Let me see if the babysitter can stay with Scorpius."
Draco pinched his left wrist unconsciously, and after a few seconds of thought:
"Shall we, Leo?" Callum asked with a wink as he removed his own clothes.
"He... He was stressed this morning."
"I understand." He hadn't planned to struggle. He knew they were about to arrive: the paramedics, then the police and the Aurors, always. He was already bloody lucky they'd given them the five minutes they needed to get married.
Papa laughed. He crouched down in front of Scorpius and lifted his shirt a little to show his lower belly, which he touched with the tips of his fingers. "It takes a long time. First, the baby will be here, hidden, warm. It will grow, grow, grow, and when Papa has a big belly, the baby will come. But there is no baby in my tummy yet. It's just an idea. I wanted to talk to you about it before Harry and made the baby."
"Can I carry him?" asked Molly, pointing to Scorpius. "With his..."
"The doctors told me what happened," Harry said carefully. "I'm so sorry. How are you?" Draco waved his hand to indicate that he was okay, accompanied by a reassuring smile. Callum slid out from behind him and stood up, stretching his large muscular body. He retrieved his shirt, which had fallen to the floor, and got dressed with slow movements.
"I didn't want you to find out at the same time as the others. And I would have told you even without the article, but we wanted to wait until I was four months pregnant before we announced it."
"Hey, mate. You want to grab a beer... Shit, sorry. You have to go home and deal with Rose, right?"
"You're hot,
"The guests?"
"Potter?"
"Who's a little wizard?" smiled Harry as he picked Scorpius up. He stood up and spun around, making Scorpius dance. The baby smiled, very pleased that his efforts had paid off. "You have such lazy parents that you had to make them understand that six in the morning or not, it was time to get up, right?"
"Where are you going?" asked Draco as he appeared in the corridor. Scorpius let go of his hand and ran towards Harry, throwing himself into his outstretched arms happily. Harry sent him flying through the air.
"No! No, of course not!"
"I don't bottom," said Harry.
Draco laughed. "I'll do it. Number one on the list: here."
"That's strangely noble of you," Harry commented with a shadow of a smile to try and ignore the rest and the hole in his chest.
"Oh no, please, please..."
"There's no point in running away now. I'll always come for you. You're my Snitch."
"Mostly me, actually. Harry thinks I still take my potion until I'm completely used to the idea, but I stopped as soon as we agreed."
Draco turned his head towards Harry as he returned. He looked extremely tired, ever since he opened his eyes. The effort was draining him. Not to help, he wasn't eating much more than he had when he had the feeding tube. He said that swallowing didn't hurt and that he just wasn't hungry anymore, but Harry wasn't sure. He felt even more stressed about his eating because the nurses let Harry help him most of the time, Draco eating more when it was him.
Speaking of the devil, Potter joined them in front of the bay window, greeting them in his deep morning voice - Draco was sure he was smoking, though he never did it in front of him.
"Monday to Friday, eight to six, but I can be called in at any time. I once worked four days and three nights in a row when there was the explosion at Sheffield, I fell asleep in the toilet at the end. Normally I think I'm supposed to get one day off a week to make up for the months of overtime I've accumulated on long missions, but I've never used it."
"It's different to talk about marriage as a distant future and as a real legal possibility. I didn't know if you'd shoulder..."
"He's not. "
Harry didn't care about the danger. He nearly grabbed one of Draco's ankles, but the blond managed to pull himself free and continued to climb, climb, up the sturdy, fruit-heavy branches, knocking apples to the ground as he made his way up.
If the doctors stopped Draco from having sex for much longer, Harry Potter's death might come early.
Draco made room for them by taking a seat next to Harry, less than two metres away from Scorpius. He pretended to look at the menu, which he knew by heart. Harry took advantage of the minute's quiet to put his hand on Draco's thigh under the table, reassuringly.
If someone had told Draco a few months ago that the first person he would talk to about Scorpius would be Harry Potter...
"Why, are we having sex tonight too?" Draco looked at him with such naughty eyes that Harry realised there probably wouldn't be many nights when they wouldn't.
"What do we have?"
Pulling himself out of his thoughts, Harry joined in the discussion. The wizard quickly spotted Draco's ring and congratulated them with great excitement, and they had beers, and when it was time to leave the restaurant the Pole offered to show them around the Reserve.
"So he's alive somewhere? Have you been able to arrest him?"
"It's not just sex."
Draco sighed and undressed, giving up his bad mood, his worries and scruples, and even his very bad impression of being annoyed by Harry.
Harry took the motorbike on the roads to the biggest Muggle toy shop he knew. He'd bought things for Teddy there once or twice, mostly what he would have liked to have gotten himself as a boy, but Teddy wasn't too fond of Muggle toys, preferring the latest wizarding figurines that all his mates wanted.
"Why does that make you so angry?"
"Good evening, sir. My Master sent me as a birthday present. He sends you his best wishes."
Absorbed in his task, Draco had forgotten about his breathing and the painful beating of his heart. Yes... Yes, he was breathing normally. His lungs were filling and emptying. His heart was beating without making him fear that it would explode. "Yes, Master."
"What are you... I mean, I imagine that..."
"Are you sure you don't need a wheelchair to the car?"
"Can I have a look?" asked Draco, covering his eyes exaggeratedly.
