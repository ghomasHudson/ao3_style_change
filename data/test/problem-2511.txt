“Shut up.” Harry tries to fight back the heat rising in his cheeks. “You’re not helping anything. I’m not interested in hearing about that.”
It makes Harry laugh out loud, the sheer act of doing so easing some of the tension steadily building between his shoulders.
, Harry thinks.
“Well go on, then.” Ginny gives Harry a nudge, her voice low. “Go and have a quick whizz round. I’ll put the food away, sort out the lighting down here and get everyone settled.”
Harry slices one in half and puts the cream and jam on just as Ginny tells him to. He smiles at her, before taking a bite.
“Come, come.” Draco shakes his head. “Stop being such a bore, Flint. You know we don’t bring the past into The Thestral.”
No. Are you?
“I know you’ve changed,” Harry says at last. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe it, so stop being such a self-righteous arse and let me help you. You don’t have to tell me the legislation’s shit, Hermione’s already gone through all its flaws. Several times.”
“I could, but I’ve never been fond of the easy option.” Harry grins and puts his arm along the back of Draco’s chair.
There’s something so odd about having Draco in the same room Harry sleeps in. It’s the room he gets himself off in, the private, personal space he never thought he would be sharing with Draco Malfoy.
—is huge. Harry’s starting to believe that things with the people that matter really will be okay.
“Yeah.” Harry nods, a strange sensation making his stomach clench. He doesn’t mention tapas, Knockturn or his impulsive offer to take Draco out for beers. “You don’t mind?”
! He’s perfectly capable of meeting men, he hates fads and gimmicks, and he can think of better things to do with his time than write love letters with a charmed quill and parchment. Somewhere along the line however, the lure of trying out the matchmaking service became irresistible. Draco has already worked his way through most of the wizards that frequent The Purple Niffler. Muggle London with its bright lights and loud music does nothing for him, and he usually ends his nights out sleeping fully clothed and waking up with a steaming hangover for company. He supposes he should know better than to join Zabini for
He’s pretty sure Draco curses and mutters something about Harry being the death of him under his breath, but in one hard thrust all thoughts are chased away. It’s not pleasurable at first, the stretch and intrusion desperately uncomfortable. It makes Harry want to pull back, which he almost does.
, he thinks.
Merlin, yes. I want him on his knees then I want him to fuck me.
“You never know who could arrive on your doorstep. I like to be prepared.” Draco flicks his eyes over Harry, watching him kick off his boots before leading him through the house. The Manor is nothing like Harry remembers. The dark walls and huge oil paintings have been replaced by white splashes of paint and contemporary art. He tries not to get too wide-eyed at the pictures, his cheeks heating as they pass a particularly provocative photograph.
“I haven’t even started.” Draco’s voice lowers. “I was in love with you too.”
“Hermione told you everything?” Harry plucks at the buttons on Draco’s shirt and closes his eyes, listening to the sound of his breathing.
“Obviously not,” Harry replies, tightly. There’s something so illicit about the idea of going to a gay bar. A gay bar in Knockturn Alley, of all places. Confusion and guilt mingle with an unmistakable thrum of excitement he hasn’t felt in a very long time. “We do my thing first. Beer and kebabs.”
“Turn over.” Draco’s voice is mercifully crisp, clear and confident. Any questions fade away when Harry willingly complies, rolling onto his belly and raising his arse like an invitation. “Good.”
Eleven months and twenty-something days to be precise. Not that Harry’s counting.
“Don’t worry.” Harry can’t help but feel guilty. Hermione has so much to do, so many things she’s dealing with. The last thing she needs is to try to travel back and forth between America and London. “I’ll be fine, I promise.”
—and still scarier than confronting Voldemort. When Draco moans into Harry’s mouth it’s too much to handle. Harry’s desire floods through him, all his racing thoughts jumbling together until it’s just Harry, Draco and pure, white-hot pleasure.
“I heard you’re an accountant,” Harry continues.
He’s excited at the thought of going to The Burrow for lunch with Draco. Things with Molly and Arthur took such a long time to heal, he wondered if he would ever be welcome there again. After a few awkward lunches, and a few less awkward ones, the tensions finally seem to be easing. The fact Molly extended an invitation to Draco—
“Anything you want to talk about?” Ginny looks worried, her brow furrowing.
“Probably.” Draco shrugs. “After another few years at Gringotts.”
“Good morning.” Draco emerges from the bathroom in a billow of steam. He rubs the back of his hair with a towel, another slung casually around his waist. “Did I wake you?”
“Wizard.” Harry takes a drink of his coffee, looking around the shop. “You wouldn’t know him.”
“It’s nice, being part of it.” Harry stands next to Draco, shooting him a faint smile. “I missed it when I was away. All of it. The way it feels to walk into Diagon Alley never gets old. At least not for me.”
“I made arrangements to take the day off.” Draco raises an eyebrow at Harry. “Shouldn’t
With a grunt of pleasure, Harry pulls back and begins to take Draco, hard and fast. The slap of their bodies together, the messy collision of their lips and the slickness of sweat on skin is overwhelmingly good. They crest and curl together until Harry comes with Draco’s name falling from his lips. He pulls out of Draco and slides down his body, sucking his cock into the back of his throat until everything is salty, sweaty and deliciously good.
“I do.” Draco stretches out on the bed, propping himself up on piles of cushions. He pats the spot next to him. “Are you going to join me?”
“Doesn’t matter. I haven’t been around much either.” Ginny takes a seat in the small café and orders for them both, before giving Harry her full attention. “How’s Malfoy?”
of pleasure.
“To be normal.” Harry lets out a humourless laugh. “It’s all I’ve ever wanted. A quiet life. A quiet, normal bloody life.”
“It’s all over the
“I’m not afraid,” Draco says. He finds he really isn’t. The idea that he would ever be ashamed of being with Harry is laughable. If anything, it should be Harry that has concerns about the publicity, not Draco. “It was never about that.”
Harry’s stomach twists and he glances at Ron, his voice thick. “You don’t reckon it’s normal?”
Harry steps into the shower and falls back against the tiles when Draco kisses him, their skin slick and slippery. Harry’s heart pounds as he relishes the ability to touch every part of Draco’s body. He slides his hands down Draco’s back and pulls them together so they can kiss until they’re both breathless.
“I’m sure.” Harry studies Draco with an amused expression. “Have I paid off that shirt yet?”
“I was thinking,” Draco snaps. He makes his way to the coffee machine, all too aware of Harry by his side. “What’s next for today, after going to spend more time with those Bowtruckles of yours?”
I’m going to be busier than a Cornish Pixie today, so I probably won’t be around until later on.
“I’ll see what I can do.” Harry laughs. The conversation lulls and he takes a breath, deciding it’s better to be unburdened than to let his thoughts fester for too long. “Kingsley came to see me today. He wanted to warn me that people are talking about me taking a personal interest in Malfoy’s case.”
“Blimey. I’d better get cracking on that party.” Harry swallows. Ron and Hermione are just two more things slipping through his fingers.
Draco can understand why Harry would want to go through the proper process, he supposes. The old Draco would have thought it all a big waste of time, but now he thinks he understands why taking something just because you can isn’t always the best way to approach life. Even if he would never admit it, he admires Harry for his instinctive desire to work for the titles he earns.
“Because you had to?”
is called The Unspeakable. A tiny, ramshackle place, it has dark and cloudy windows, a magical haze protecting those inside from the prying eyes of Knockturn’s patrons. Much to Harry’s surprise, the second is called The Wandering Thestral, something that makes Draco smirk as he points it out.
. I planned to say something eventually, but it’s nice just having some space to work everything out. I want to be confident enough myself to stand up to the crying and wailing if it doesn’t go well.”
, his brain supplies.
“Sod off, you don’t know a damn thing about it.” Draco rifles through the papers, his forehead etched in a frown. “Don’t try to compare my life to what you have with that pretty Weasley of yours. You couldn’t begin to understand what it’s like to try to meet someone when the law forces you to live in the shadows.”
By the time the sun comes up the day after Hermione leaves for America, Harry is still awake.
Morning! I’m knackered. I’ve been up for a meeting since five, I couldn’t sleep. The Evaporates helped. Something to get up for, so to speak.
Harry holds Draco’s gaze for as long as he can. When Draco catches his lips in a heart-stopping kiss, Harry closes his eyes, gives into the moment and imagines he’s opening his arms and soaring through the air.
“A little much for a Wednesday afternoon, wouldn’t you say?” Harry looks pointedly at Draco’s outfit.
The door clicks and the rustle of somebody moving close to Harry pulls him out of his thoughts.
Draco doesn’t respond immediately. He looks around instead, taking in the room and seeming to focus on anywhere but Harry. His gaze lingers on the mantelpiece, where there used to be a picture from a Ministry function of Harry, Draco and a group of other people from the DMLE. You can’t put up couples’ photographs when you’re having a secret relationship, after all. The picture was the best one of them that Harry had, and he doesn’t even have that now, having thrown it on the fire in a moment of anger during the first, furious month of Draco’s absence. He regretted it almost immediately, but it was too late. The photograph burned, curled and turned to ash before a hurried
He yanks Harry over him, kissing him with a fierce eagerness. He can taste the muskiness of his own sweat on Harry’s lips, the saltiness of pre-come. After a breathless moment, he puts his hands on Harry’s chest to push him back.
“I’m here with him.” Harry gestures towards Draco when there’s an expectant lull in conversation. “With, err. Malfoy. I’m not here to cause any trouble. I’m not with the Aurors anymore.”
Molly stops and takes a breath, standing back from Harry. She looks tired and Harry’s chest tightens.
When Draco finally gets Harry alone in his Quidditch leathers, he knows from the people milling around he can’t exactly do anything about it, but he makes a mental note to bring the topic up with Harry at a more opportune moment.
“I won’t.” Draco’s voice is ragged, his breathing heavy. Harry can hear a phial being uncorked and he settles back onto the pillows, his heart thudding.
“Where did you go?”
“I’m scared for you,” Ginny says after a long moment of quiet. She slips her warm hand into Harry’s and squeezes, tightly. “I’m scared for us both.”
“I advocated for using the more recent Muggle legislation as a template and worked with lobby groups to create a fuss, but it wasn’t enough. It was a step too far for the majority of voters.”
“I’m not telling you anything of the sort,” Kingsley scoffs. “Your personal life is none of my business. However, I don’t think making a formal commitment to Ginevra would do you any harm at all. You two seem happy and you said yourself, you’re not the sort of man to overthink things. Why delay the inevitable?”
“Alder often responds best to advanced witches and wizards and is particularly suited to those who excel in non-verbal spells.” Draco recites Ollivander’s notes, even though he has his own thoughts on Alder, primarily influenced by the differing perspectives of Gregorovitch. Draco swallows at the steady look Harry gives him, his eyebrows raised in surprise. “Don’t look so shocked, Potter. I gather from the grapevine non-verbal spells are something of a specialty of yours. I thought you might find a wand that lends itself to that skill most useful.”
.” Draco is starting to get a sense for what makes Harry tick, the softness of shared clothes and conversation after a shag and a shower, the care he wanted to take before using his fingers. He wants to see if he’s right. “Did you mean it?”
Harry casts a charm that leaves him dry and impervious to rainwater, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at Draco’s dramatics. He supposes he deserves it, after fucking off and not contacting Draco again for a week.
“That one.” Harry’s heart is in his throat. “The one with rubies.”
.” Draco’s throat bobs. “She always liked the sad ones.”
“I don’t understand.” Harry tries to gather his scattered thoughts. “Even if we’re behind the times, isn’t the point that it’s not illegal anymore? Two wizards can—” Harry stops, not trusting himself to fill in the blanks. His stomach churns, his throat dry.
Harry pulls on his boots and closes the door to the Manor behind him. He makes his way down the drive, the stones crunching beneath his feet.
“Look, Malfoy—”
“I can’t be with my team all the time,” Harry points out. “They have jobs to do. Laws to enforce.”
.” Harry slams his hands on the table and stands, his breathing heavy. “You’re going to get rid of me for it, so you might as well say it out loud. Let’s have it on the official minutes. I want people to know why you fired me when they look back on this.”
“That’s the one.” Harry slides the wand between his fingers, taking in the smoothness of the wood. “I don’t think I’ve had a go with an Alder wand before. What’s that all about?”
“Dunno.” Ron shrugs. “It’s not my normal, that’s for sure. I don’t tend to think about it much. Hermione gave me a right rollicking when I called Malfoy a poof. I tried to tell her it’s not because he’s gay, it’s because he’s a pillock. It’s just a word, isn’t it? She wasn’t having any of it.”
“I never said I w—” Harry breaks off with a groan when Draco slides his hand more quickly. “Yeah, that’s—”
“Fine, I think.” Harry raises an eyebrow at Ginny. “Why do you care?”
Draco’s heart quickens and with a huff of irritation, he closes the book with a snap. After shoving it into his desk drawer, together with the still quivering quill, Draco sits back in his chair and contemplates his surroundings. He pushes the latest messages from Griffin to the furthest corner of his mind and tries to relax.
?” He stares at Harry, incredulously. “Don’t be such a foolish idiot.”
“You’re such a fucking liar.” Harry crows with laughter, sitting up eagerly when Draco flicks his wand to summon a couple of magazines. He eyes the title. “Yeah, I bet
The conversation ebbs and flows around them and the music gets louder, until they have to shout over one another to be heard. Harry sits back and takes it all in, the spinning mirror ball, the dancing in the small space in the centre of the room.
friends. I hated keeping secrets from them.”
.” Harry whispers a
, he corrects himself.
“I never meant to make you feel that way.” Draco sighs, sitting heavily back in his seat. “It all got so complicated.”
and a steady light flickers and pulses between them. He reaches out his hand and tugs Draco to his feet, pressing urgent kisses on his face, his neck and tracing the beat of his pulse up to whisper in his ear. “I want you to fuck me. Can we go to your room?”
“You’re right,” Harry says at last. “Nobody was around. It’s why I like the pub you were so rude about. There’s never anybody gawking at me.”
Harry puts his mug on the work surface and folds his arms. He doesn’t volunteer to move the conversation into the living room. He’s got no desire to repeat the earlier part of the evening with its awkward chit-chat and uncomfortable silences. He certainly doesn’t want to suffer the indignity of listening, again, to Draco blithely suggest he hasn’t given Harry a single thought since he swanned off to Paris to do Merlin knows what. Considering Draco’s been standing in a thunderstorm for the last couple of hours, Harry isn’t stupid enough to believe a word of it, but that doesn’t ease the sting. If Draco thinks more lies are the way to resolve anything, he can get fucked.
. You kept insisting you were straight, like I was some weird anomaly. It made me feel like we were doing something wrong.”
. Imagine what that’ll do if it does ever come out. Those Ministry arseholes might not think much of it, but think of that young, gay wizard knowing he’s going to be alright because he’s just like Harry Potter.”
“They can’t do that! He’s Harry Potter.” Lee looks like he wants to fight someone. George continues to stare at Harry, stunned into silence.
“He’s not so bad.”
“I’m not pretending anything.” Harry pulls open Draco’s belt, his breathing heavy. His knuckles brush against the hard line of Draco’s cock and his mouth waters. “Come on, then. You’re in charge, you obnoxious arsehole. Why don’t you show me the things I couldn’t possibly understand?”
“Only once a week, or if I’m entertaining.” Draco sniffs. “Don’t judge me for liking nice food. It’s Thursday, you can think of this as my new routine.”
“Morgana’s a lesbian and a Muggle-born.” Ginny gives Harry a sharp look. “Who the girls sleep with doesn’t impact their flying abilities. She doesn’t take kindly to people trying to spout pure-blood politics during practice.”
“—I know what you meant.” Draco holds Harry’s steady gaze. “What the fuck are you doing?”
The twitch of Draco’s cock when Harry says
“I have no idea.” Draco presses Harry against the counter, his breath warm on Harry’s lips. “I’m not sure I can ever imagine living in a time that’s ready for us.”
Harry flicks his wand and the cork pops into his outstretched hand. It only takes a second, which gives him the opportunity to look at Draco properly while his back is still turned. It would have been nice if he’d got a bad haircut or lost his haughty good looks in Paris, but he’s every bit as handsome as he’s always been. If anything, the last year has served him well. The realisation that he still finds Draco mouth-wateringly attractive, after everything, makes Harry ache.
Because I love being sent unsolicited Evaporates and having dull conversations with strangers. What about you?
There’s a bookcase in my office. I’ve always wanted someone to kiss me up against it, rough and hot.
“Now listen here, Harry.” Ginny speaks quickly and confidently, her voice warm. “This is what you’re going to do. You’re going to tell Ron I ended things because I wanted to focus on Quidditch. Too much distance, too busy, the usual it’s not you it’s me sort of stuff. Tell him this happened ages ago and you were devastated. Make sure he understands I know everything and you’re still my best friend.”
makes his stomach roll.
“Not in the slightest,” Draco snaps. He yanks the magazines out of Harry’s hands.
Harry looks into Draco’s eyes, an unmistakable heat behind his gaze. “Can I—?”
like last time. They arrest people for the smallest things, looking at someone funny, dancing. I could be curled up on the ground and they’d give me a swift kick then charge me with resisting arrest.”
“Sorry I’m late. The Bowtruckles have been having a go at the Hippogriffs.” Harry drops into a nearby seat, lounging comfortably with the insolent charm of someone who is completely at ease with keeping everybody waiting. Unlike the robes Hogwarts staff usually wear, he’s in jeans and a jumper again. The jumper has a couple of leaves caught in the wool and what appears to be a Bowtruckle, nestling close to the collar. “The little ones have been trying to eat the leaves off the Wiggentree. They’re only young, they don’t know any better. I noticed a kerfuffle when I was flying over the Forest and thought I should sort it out.”
“You played moderately well,” he drawls instead. Draco is a reformed character, but he’s still an arsehole when he wants to be.
Harry, when he spent most of his time professing how much he loathed him. Still, he’s had a long, hot summer and the benefit of hindsight to realise he might have protested a little too much. Nobody in Draco’s life has ever challenged him quite the way Harry has. The one upside to chatting to Harry through an anonymous dating service is that Draco can at least be honest about it on Quick-Match. He can say things to Griffin he’s not sure he would ever be able to say to Harry’s face.
“I expected nothing less.” Harry laughs under his breath. “It’s a date.”
“Not a lot,” Harry agrees. He pulls up a chair at Draco’s table and signals for a drink. “Want another one?”
“Anything you say, Malfoy.” Harry grins.
as Draco put it.
to Ginny. He can say it properly to himself, with the sun setting on the horizon. He takes a breath and hopes one day he can say it without everything spinning away from him. “If I can’t make it work with you, I’m not sure I’m going to make it work with any other witch.”
Harry swallows, taking a quick gulp of his champagne. “Yeah. I’m going with her.”
“Let me finish, will you?” Draco rolls his eyes. “It was something I had to do alone. I could never expect you to understand my relationship with my father, not after the things he’s done to you. I couldn’t imagine you in the same room together, trying to get him to understand me—us. It wouldn’t have worked.”
Draco grits his teeth. Potter is so infuriating, he could scream. He should have known Harry would be wanking to Draco’s messages in surround sound, while Draco has been scribbling in his Passion Parchment like some kind of magical imbecile.
The brass key is warm and solid in Draco’s hand, the turn and click of it still a thrill. Although the small, crooked shop on the edge of Hogsmeade village might not look like much, opening the door that separates his home from his workplace reminds Draco of the time it took to reach this point. The early years after the war passed in a listless blur of Wizengamot trials, arguing with his mother and father, travelling around the world with no clear destination in mind and hot, sweaty nights on beaches warmed by the blistering midday sun. Some people might have accused Draco of running away. Draco prefers to think of it as staying alive: breathing in new, exhilarating ways of seeing the world, leaving old opinions behind with a ragged exhale.
“You’d be surprised how tricky that information is to get out of someone.” Harry holds Draco’s gaze, his lips tipping into another smile. “It’s complicated.” He drains the rest of his hot chocolate and gets to his feet. “I’d better be off.”
“Thanks for coming.” Harry looks around and because no one’s watching, he gives Draco’s hand a quick squeeze before releasing it. “I know it can’t have been easy.”
Some time later, not sure if he’s awake or dreaming, Harry hears Hermione’s voice again.
Even Draco’s knowledge of the tattoo is awkward as fuck. When he stumbled across Harry at
Draco licks his lips, closing his eyes for a minute to imagine what a kiss with Harry might feel like. He picks up his quill and continues writing.
Heat rises in Harry’s cheeks, but he keeps his expression smooth. “Don’t be a prick. I’m here to help.”
“Liaising with a person of interest—”
“Yes?”
Harry’s itching to pass a scathing comment about it being rich of Lucius Malfoy to be so fucking judgmental, but he knows that’s completely the wrong thing to say. Fear of exactly that sort of response seems to have stopped Draco from telling Harry any of this in the first place.
“You didn’t.” Draco gives Harry a firm look. “Any ultimatums were all in my head. No matter how eager you were to tell your friends, you were remarkably patient, considering.”
“This was in a locked drawer.” Harry’s voice is thick and foggy, his head spinning. “In a locked office. What the
“I reckon you’d be in Azkaban, or worse,” Harry continues, ignoring Draco. “I’d love to know what Umbridge thinks about it. She’s here too, isn’t she? We should ask her.”
“Pardon?” Draco holds his hand up when Harry begins to repeat himself. He got it the first time, he just…needs a minute.
you?” Arthur looks scandalised and Molly chokes back a sob. “They can’t. What possible grounds would they have? You’re the best Auror they’ve had for years, trustworthy, honest, fair. We can take this up with Magical Persons Resources. Harry Potter, fired! There’ll be riots on the street.”
“Thanks.” Harry makes his way into what he assumes is Draco’s study. In contrast to the rest of the house, it’s much more in keeping with the Manor Harry remembers of old. There’s a large mahogany desk at the end of the room and a large sofa next to a crackling fire. For such an opulent room it’s surprisingly cosy.
. It’s all he’s ever wanted. All he’s ever craved. No more celebrity, no more Dark Lords, no more stupid scar. It’s dangerous to want something as much as Harry wants to be normal, because when it’s pulled away from you, it’s like your whole body starts to tear apart at the seams.
“But you knew who you were,” Draco replies. His voice is terse and clipped. “Everyone knew. You had time to understand it. I still didn’t know that I was—”
When he glances back a shadowy figure moves across the study window, before disappearing entirely.
.” With a groan, Harry pulls off his glasses and closes the distance between them in seconds.
“I can’t believe Malfoy’s here for a sleepover.” Harry laughs under his breath, catching Draco muttering something rude about the wallpaper.
“I don’t want to be in love with you still.” Harry’s voice is broken, and he pushes Draco’s open shirt off his shoulders, watching him shake it off completely and drop it on the floor. “I don’t.”
“I didn’t expect arrogant wanker to be a kink of yours, Potter.”
,” the witch breathes. She clutches the beer mat bearing Harry’s untidy scribbles to her chest with a contented sigh. “Oh.” Her gaze lands on Draco and she frowns. “It’s you.”
“I told you, Blaise and Theodore will be around here somewhere.” Pansy waves her hand. “Besides, you’re looking very handsome tonight. I’m sure plenty of wizards would be delighted to keep you company.”
“Gay?” It doesn’t escape Harry’s attention that Draco stops before finishing his sentence. He shakes his head, sadness overwhelming him. “It’s just you and me, Draco. No one’s around, the walls don’t have ears. The fact you still can’t say it out loud shows nothing’s changed.”
“Yeah.” Harry slides his hand up Draco’s arm, his voice rough. “That’s what I do.”
An unexpected bolt of heat passes through Harry’s veins and he thumbs more vigorously through Draco’s papers, refusing to meet his gaze. The discomfort of being confronted with this topic of conversation resurfaces with force.
“Dull, but I managed to get everything finished with time to spare before you arrived.” Draco pushes open a door, and gestures for Harry to go in first. “After you.”
“You’ll know when it’s right,” Harry says. “I’ve already said don’t do anything on my account. I honestly don’t know if it would help or make things worse.” He pulls a face. “They might blame me for turning you gay.”
“In that case, you need to be careful.” Draco’s firm, authoritative voice breaks the mood as he studies Harry, a strange heat behind his eyes. “You need to brush up on the art of subterfuge. I can’t imagine that’s where your magical strengths lie.”
Draco does as requested, sliding back and then pushing into Harry again. The stretch and burn dulls but there’s still something so intense about being fucked in this way. It’s like nothing Harry’s experienced before but as he gets used to the initially strange sensation he begins focusing on the pleasure. A hot, hungry force gathers and burns within him and his need becomes an ache that goes far deeper than simple desire. Harry is glad it’s Draco, doing this. Glad it’s someone that will stay in the bed with him after, kissing and talking through the night.
“I can’t believe you convinced me to come back here again,” Draco grouses. “I’m starting to think my father was right about Dumbledore. Does the man always talk in riddles?”
“Here.” Draco proves Harry’s assumptions to be correct, pouring amber liquid into two glasses. “I assume you’re not flying?”
“Marcus Flint?” Harry whispers to Draco.
“At first.” Harry nods. “It was never meant to be permanent, the thing at Hogwarts, but Dragomir—Professor Peakes—is retiring from the Defence position next year. McGonagall asked if I would consider it and the rest is history. I’ve been sorting out all the administrative stuff at the Ministry with Kingsley. In the meantime, I do a bit of everything. Groundskeeping, mainly, while Hagrid’s off seeing the world with Maxime. But there’s Quidditch and the odd Defence class I teach with supervision from Dragomir. I do some Quidditch training too. Hooch is up to her eyeballs with the new kids and the House Tournament, so I do separate classes for the ones that really can’t fly for toffee.”
“Why are you here?” Harry asks. The memories fade away like echoes.
“Is that a recent addition to the school curriculum?” Draco pulls a face, not quite managing to conceal his distaste at the thought. “The
It comes as absolutely no surprise to Harry that Draco’s supper is more tasting menu at a Michelin Star restaurant than kebab and chips after a boozy night out. The dining table is ridiculous, for a start. It’s big enough to seat twenty people, although Draco mercifully casts a few quick Transfiguration charms to make it suitable for two, rather than forcing Harry to sit at the head of the table and yell across the room about the weather.
“No. Of course you don’t. I wouldn’t be here drinking with you at four in the afternoon if you did.”
The voices fade away and the room whirls and spins until finally everything is dark and still.
“Fine.” Draco slams the door with a flick of his wand and leads Harry into the living room. He sits on the edge of the padded coffee table, facing the sofa. He puts his arms on his legs and leans forward, clearly trying his level best not to make a snide comment. “Go on, then.”
Draco pauses, wondering how to answer the question. It would be a lie to say he
“Nothing!” Harry shakes his head quickly, taking Ginny’s hand. “Nothing’s wrong, I promise.”
“No.” Draco turns, his eyes darkening as his gaze sweeps over Harry. “Nice jacket. Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.”
“That’s
“I don’t have any peculiar ways.”
“Why am I not bloody surprised? Everything’s complicated with you.” Harry looks up and finally meets Draco’s gaze. “Don’t get arsy with me for saying I’m not your friend. There was a time you were as important to me as the closest friends I’ve ever known. I was in love with you, more fool me.”
Draco snorts under his breath. How very predictable that Harry Potter has a hero complex. Fortunately for Draco, being an obnoxious twat comes as naturally to him as breathing.
. Eventually, they go through the small arch and into the main space where Harry can take in everything properly.
“I’d hardly say we’re friends,” Harry replies. He keeps his voice level. “I helped with his case. Does it bother you?”
“No.” Draco shakes his head. “Not all of it. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while.”
, Minister Robards.” Kingsley stands, his voice laced with fury. The magic in the room crackles and twists and he is as imposing and strong as he’s ever been. “If you put Harry in Azkaban, I will bring together every person I know, and we’ll break him out ourselves. Harry Potter will not spend one night in jail. Not one minute. Not one
“I’ll get there,” Harry promises. He hooks his arms under Draco’s thighs that tremble with the efforts of trying to nudge his dick closer to Harry’s mouth. “Hold still, will you?”
“You appear to have mistaken me for Madam Puddifoots.” Draco hands Harry his coffee. “I didn’t study wandlore for six years to spend my valuable time making you coffee.”
Draco pulls a face. “If you insist.”
“The house?” Draco looks around with a critical eye. “I do. The artwork, at least. Most of the pieces were investments.”
“Give over, it wasn’t like that. I live above a nightclub. I had friends over here at first then it seemed stupid, being up here instead of down there with everyone else.”
does strange things to his gut.
Harry’s spraying on some deodorant and cologne when a sound at the bedroom door makes him turn. Draco rests against the doorframe, watching Harry. Silence stretches between them as Draco’s eyes slide over Harry’s naked torso. When Draco meets Harry’s gaze at last, his expression is dark and hungry.
“Excuse me?”
“Did you just wake up one day and decide—?” Ron’s lip curls in distaste when he trails off. It sends pulses of anger through Harry.
, Potter.” Draco doesn’t sound at all shocked by the bold assumption, but Harry doesn’t miss the note of pleasure in his tone. He adjusts the collar of his shirt and points at the bar. “I suggest shots. If you’re attempting to get me to let loose, a pint and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps isn’t going to cut the mustard.”
“I’d say you like one part in particular.” Harry reaches for Draco. “Come here and stop sulking. I don’t care what you like. I just want to know.”
“You trust me.” Instead of joking, Harry is firm and serious. He gives Draco another one of those steady gazes that seem even more attractive now they’re in bed together. “And I trust you. Anyway, it won’t all be Quick-Match. We’ll just have to fuck whenever we get some time to ourselves, until term ends.”
“Yeah.” Harry glances at Ron, guilt making his cheeks hot. After a month of visiting Azkaban, Harry’s starting to look forward to his trips to see Draco, not that he’d ever admit it. At least it’s more interesting than shuffling papers. Flying out to the prison gives Harry the freedom to swoop close to the salty seas and spin through the sky unburdened. It’s miles better than carefully negotiating London’s busy skies and getting into a boring conversation with Robards when he’s trying to make a coffee. “Do you care?”
. It’s as though time’s moving differently for Harry than it does for other people and he’s like a clock that refuses to move forward. On some days he wonders if he’s still stuck in his seventeen-year-old shoes, trying to work out what the hell happens next as people grow old around him.
“You’re
“No, but I had my reasons.” Draco’s expression turns wistful. “I heard you were looking for me in England—”
“But…” Molly trails off and Arthur grips her hand tightly. A strange expression crosses his face as he looks at Harry.
Draco tries to see Diagon Alley through Harry’s eyes, but it’s difficult. He grew up immersed in magic and it’s always been intrinsically there. He can believe that discovering it all for the first time through eleven-year-old eyes would be the kind of thing that stays with you.
“You can count on it.” Harry leans back, a resigned quiet settling over him. This is it. No more hiding. Not from Ginny or from himself, at least. It’s like welcoming in a new, uncertain dawn.
that feels good.
Harry wishes he wasn’t in a stupid dressing gown. Draco’s revelation should make him feel happy, but it doesn’t. It just makes him even more confused because people who love one another don’t just leave without saying goodbye.
—but because there are plenty of people who would love to get the information that my wand’s dying and for all the wrong reasons.”
“I wasn’t expecting you,” Harry lies. He’s been expecting Draco ever since he saw the grainy pictures in the

was shit, I felt like a right twat after worrying everyone.” Harry’s palms are clammy, and he presses them flat on his thighs. “Since when do we communicate through the papers?”
So what if I am? You’d better hurry up and get to the other stuff before I lose my hard-on. What does he do next?
“Best not,” Draco agrees. It still seems strange exchanging easy small talk with Potter, despite the countless conversations on Quick-Match and their last meeting in the shop. “Why the fuck can’t you just fly a broom like a normal person?”
With a muffled groan, Harry deepens the kiss, his head swimming with the taste and scent of Draco. He gives as good as he gets, his hands twisted into Harry’s t-shirt and his mouth wet and eager. Their kiss gets messy and breathless. It’s as though the room shrinks in on itself and there’s nothing left but them, two galaxies colliding and bursting into flame. Harry moves his hands down Draco’s back, pulling him away from the counter just enough to grip the curve of his arse. It makes Draco pull back, a hiss leaving his lips. He’s already the kind of dishevelled Harry likes best. There are few things that get him hard as quickly as Draco Malfoy looking well-kissed and desperate to be fucked.
written across the top in light grey lettering.
“Don’t you bother doing this when it’s just you?” Harry glances at the food he’s certain he’s not going to be able to pronounce, his stomach grumbling at the delicious scent. “It’s a bit weird eating at a table for twenty by yourself.”
Harry snorts. “I get it, Malfoy, and I’m sympathetic. But don’t try to pretend you’re better than me just because you give blowjobs to strangers in public parks.”
“I hope it doesn’t gouge your eyes out,” Draco snickers.
“I’m so happy, I could kiss you,” Harry says. He doesn’t sound like he’s joking, his voice rich and warm. It’s a different tone to anything Draco has heard from Harry before and it sends shivers travelling down the length of his spine.
“I don’t think you’re gross or abnormal, for what it’s worth.” Ron turns and gives Harry a watery smile. “I don’t like Malfoy much, but I suppose I’ll get used to him eventually.”
Are you always this prickly?
“The spell has begun to eat away at the core. The only thing that can stop a phoenix feather used in a wand core from being destroyed by magic like that is—”
He can’t bear to finish the sentence.
“I dunno.” Ginny shrugs. She waits for their food to be placed down in front of them, before smearing one of her scones with lashings of clotted cream and jam. “They’re so fusty, those laws of yours.”
“Fuck off.” Harry laughs under his breath. “It wouldn’t kill you to ask what I want, you know, instead of just assuming.”
“I’ve got something to tell you both, and for the time being I’d appreciate it’s kept between us.” After eating a little of his food, Harry finally puts his knife and fork down.
“Dunno.” Harry shrugs, glancing at the table of Slytherins. “How about Salazar Slytherin Was Pants?”
“Did something bad happen?” Harry’s stomach rolls, the thought of someone doing anything to Draco filling him with sadness and rage.
“It is.” Draco pulls a face. “And here I am, drinking flat lager in a pub that smells like old frying pans.”
Draco settles in a chair behind the desk, tidying a sprawl of papers into a neat pile. When he finishes, he looks up at Harry and gestures to the chair opposite. “Why are you really here?”
“I know. It’s not the first time I’ve seen it.” Harry seems lost in thought as he studies the wand with a frown. “I’m not sure I like it.”
“We may have time for you to tell it when you next come in.” Draco clears his throat when another curious expression crosses Harry’s features. “I tend to prefer clients to stay when I work on their wands. I’d rather not have cause to be hauled before the Wizengamot again in my time and wands can be tricky things. If someone is unhappy with the result, it wouldn’t be too difficult for them to suggest some sort of malpractice on my part. Think of it as extra insurance.”
“Do you think I want this?” Harry’s voice breaks and he gulps in a breath. “I don’t want it. Not one bit of it.”
“What did you read last?” George is the picture of innocence.
“Try me.” Harry studies Draco, the hot curl of anger mercifully fading a little. “I’m here to help. Honestly.”
conversation neither one of them will start. They’re both too full of fight and fire and history to ask such a simple question. A debt is a promise of later, more, fooling around in the shadows with Harry down on his knees to pay Draco back for a shirt neither one of them gives a shit about.
Draco seems to have less patience than Harry. There’s no slow undress. Instead he yanks Harry’s joggers down and sucks in a breath.
“I’ve no intention of stopping.” Harry’s voice is thick with desire, and it sends a flash of pleasure through Draco. “This…plenty of men, you said.”
, he thinks, as people congratulate him on his speech and tell him what a wonderful asset he is to the Ministry.
“Tell them thanks.” Harry has another sausage roll, eating it miserably. He shakes himself and pushes thoughts of Molly and Arthur to one side. He’s going to have to see them at some point and he doesn’t want them watching him skulk around at the buffet like a sadsack. “Millie looks happy.”
“Please don’t,” Draco replies. There’s a note of panic in his voice. “Potter here doesn’t need to hear about my sex life. He might be forced to put me in Azkaban again.”
“You can’t break into someone’s shop and start snooping around.”
“No. I enjoyed it. I tidied the garden up too. I can’t have you passing comments on that as well as my wallpaper.”
. There’s a futile rage that pulses through him because nothing will ever be right again. Everything will always be wonky, off-centre, topsy-turvy and upside down. The last bit of normalcy Harry was able to cling to slips from his fingers like sand until there’s nothing left but grit and air. He doesn’t want to live in the shadows, like Draco said. He doesn’t want to be scared of love. His eyes prick with tears and a deep sadness that wells furiously within him, because Ginny has always been his constant. She was there for him in ways nobody else has been since the war, and she understands him. Better than anyone. He rubs his jaw, his hand shaking and the touch of his fingers against his skin like someone else’s hand, someone else’s face. He would Apparate away if he could, but he’d probably splinch himself and he refuses to leave Ginny—brave, wonderful Ginny—thinking Harry can’t love her just as she is. If only she knew.
“Whatever his name is.” Draco finishes his prawn and puts a meatball on his plate, with a frown. “If I can’t enjoy Thursday’s without Auror
and Minister Robards looks quite ill. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?”
“Can somebody please tell me what on earth is going on?” Molly snaps.
“I really do like the beard.” Draco’s voice cracks. “I always said it would suit you.”
. So much for the fledgling camaraderie he thought had developed between them this week. He ponders Harry’s question for a moment before responding.
“I’ve seen Robards snogging Rosmerta after one Ogden’s too many, before he got all hoity-toity.” George winks. “Your secret’s safe with us.”
“Is there a reason you’re not touching me?” Harry brushes his lips against Draco’s neck, tracing a path over the firm line of his jaw. His words make Draco’s breath stutter, a sinful groan falling from his lips.
“I know.” Draco tears off some of the piping hot bread in a basket next to Harry and uses it to gather some of the juices on his plate. “I don’t eat like this every night, before you start making assumptions.”
.” The book flies from his shelf into his outstretched hand and he opens it up, glancing out of the window where the cool, crisp bright of the afternoon filters softly into the room.
“Next time,” Harry promises.
“Merlin.” Harry pulls a face. He’s not really the protesting sort. “I suppose if there are badges.”
Draco’s stomach kicks and he understands now how Harry knows so much about his life.
“I’m sure I can find other ways to persuade you,” Draco murmurs. He slips his hand into Harry’s again. “It could be our time, by then.”
“Merlin, no.” Harry pulls a face. “You make it sound so bland, being in someone’s pocket.”
“Let Harry eat his food, Mum.” George shushes Molly and Arthur. “He’s travelled all the way here, give him a minute to get his head straight…err…sorted.”
“Okay.” Draco finds it really is. He doesn’t want things to get to deep and serious. The night is wild with possibility, and he wants to relish in every moment. “Can we turn the music up?”
“Couldn’t agree more.” Harry swigs his beer and sits next to Draco. “I’m fixing the light on Sunday when the club’s closed if you want to help.”
As much as he hates to admit it they couldn’t have carried on as they were for much longer, with all the fighting and lies. Running off to Paris might not have been Draco’s brightest idea, but it’s clear that the time apart has given him much needed space to think, without Harry around to confuse matters. Draco’s new, considered honesty makes it far easier for Harry to trust that he’s not going to leave again any time soon. His heart gives a happy, hopeful leap at the thought that this time they might really be okay. Better than okay.
“I can hear you both.” Draco turns and wrinkles his nose as he takes in Harry’s attire. Despite his unimpressed expression, Harry doesn’t miss the places his eyes linger and the memory of Draco’s hard, searching kisses comes flooding back. “You insinuated your way into my life to enjoy my recent misfortune. It seems only fair I should return the favour.”
“Are you always this bratty after sex?” Draco gives Harry a lazy smile.
“Yeah.” Harry doesn’t want to mention he changed it because the old one reminded him of Draco. He hopes this doesn’t go to shit again. He really doesn’t want to have to buy new stuff when he’s only just got everything the way he likes it. “I should probably shower.”
“I’m sure you don’t,” Potter says with an aggravating air of judgment.
Harry laughs. “And the rest of it?”
It might not be anything special to Draco, but for Harry the tight, firm clench of Draco’s body is an entirely new and unexpected sensation. The grasp of him around Harry’s cock, the way Draco manages to look pissy and horny all at the same time, the newness of doing this. He’s had good sex with Draco. He’s had
They kiss for a long time before Harry finally presses a slick finger slowly inside Draco’s body. To his surprise, Draco seems to welcome it. With a groan he kisses Draco again and adds more lube, fucking him slowly with two fingers. Instead of being tight and resistant, Draco seems completely relaxed.
“No we’re not.” George shakes his head. “We’re not your chums at the Ministry. We know looking out for Malfoy doesn’t mean you’re in cahoots with Death Eaters. You don’t have to be Mr Ministry here, unless you reckon flashing your card around could wangle us free shots.”
“I’ll try to get the word out.” Draco’s expression is pinched, and he pushes the papers back towards Harry. “I suppose at the very least this gives us a way to overturn my conviction.”
“That, and other things.” Draco frowns, considering his words carefully. “It’s taken me a year away to realise those are my issue, not yours. I can’t change the fact that you made good choices and I made bad ones, no more than I can alter the things I was raised to believe as a child and the shame that caused. I need to focus on the choices I’m making now, as an adult.”
Harry yanks off his glasses and shuts Draco up by kissing him firmly. His hands shake as heat pulses through his body. His sudden arousal overwhelms him, sharp and intense. He wants to show Draco, wants to prove
After reaching into his bedside dresser for more lube—something he appears to have in most rooms of the flat—Harry positions himself behind Draco. He slips a finger back inside, returning with two and using slow, maddening strokes until Draco is ready to start begging for more.
has all kinds of delicious implications.
“It would have been decent to tell me who you were sooner,” Harry comments. He gives Draco a thoughtful look. “You took your time.”
—when I was inside you?”
“Me too.” Hermione rummages around in her robes and hands Harry a small glass bottle. “I brought a potion I made for Rosie to help her on bad nights—she gets night terrors. I think it might help you sleep, just for tonight.”
“I wouldn’t have thought it would be your thing either,” Harry muses. “I hope it’s not going to distract you from sorting out my wand.”
? Kingsley’s comments are strangely settling, the revelation sending a burst of hope through Harry that clamours uneasily with his fear and shame. It makes him think about his conversation with Draco about the Thestrals. It offers him a strange sort of comfort as he recalls Dumbledore’s kind smile and the way he always encouraged Harry to forge his own path and have faith in his convictions. Harry shakes himself from his thoughts, aware Kingsley is waiting for a response.
. He misses Ron so much and the thought of losing him as well as Molly and Arthur makes Harry want to crumple to his knees. He keeps himself steady, swallowing when Ron pauses at the door.
“I’d hate to see you barred,” Draco lies. He can think of few things that would entertain him more.
“You’re not always as easy to talk to as you might imagine.” Draco tips his head back, looking at the stars. “Besides, I knew it would come out sooner or later with you so eager for everyone to know. I had to deal with my parents before that happened.”
“In case I got lucky.” Harry has the audacity to wink at Draco, a warm smile playing over his lips. “Which I did.”
“Try me.” Draco’s voice is rough, his eyes dark and challenging. “You wouldn’t be the first. Let’s see how scandalous Harry Potter can be. Not very, I bet. With your boring—”
“I get it.” Harry pokes Draco in the side. “If I haven’t already been obvious enough, being fucked into the mattress by you is my new favourite thing. I’m more than happy to indulge you.”
.” Harry shakes his head. “Fine, don’t tell me about your secret stash.”
“Don’t be so ridiculous.” Draco gives Harry a strange look, his expression fond. “I might enjoy the idea of—how did you put it?—fucking you into the mattress, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to start spanking you.”
The door opens before Harry can so much as lift his hand. Draco glares at him. “I could feel you hovering around through the wards as soon as you opened the garden gate.”
bars in Knockturn until Draco told him. “Was there anything dodgy going on?”
“It’s a good place to be,” Harry continues. “I work with my best mates, I get to help the kids just starting out. I can change things working there, I already have. I don’t know what would happen if I couldn’t do this. There’s nothing else I want to do.”
For now, Harry’s keeping his head down and trying to focus on mending relationships with those closest to him, which is why he finds himself at The Burrow on a cold Friday evening.
Harry loves visiting Ginny, but he can’t picture himself living in Wales. His social life revolves around London and you can’t fly a broom after a couple of beers. Not to mention security breaches on the Floo Network several years ago led to a complete overhaul of the system. Shortly after the war, security concerns forced Harry to disconnect Grimmauld Place from the Floo Network, allowing Fire-Calls but no full body transportation. The Ministry Floos can only be used for official business, and it’s made his life with Ginny harder than ever, thanks to the time and administration required to arrange a Portkey and the physical strain of too much long-distance Apparition. Spontaneous visits dwindled and eventually stopped altogether. It’s just another thing between them they’re both putting off discussing, hoping things will just resolve themselves when the time comes.
“Harry…” Draco’s eyelids flutter closed.
Breathless, they pull apart and Harry traces light, feathery kisses along Draco’s neck. He looks deliciously rumpled, his lips warm on Draco’s skin and his hair askew.
He isn’t sure how to explain to someone like Harry Potter that there isn’t any such thing as a quick fix. The ideologies Draco absorbed from the cradle make his skin itch and burn now. There are days he wants to peel the past from his body and start all over again. Reborn. Brand new. It turns out change doesn’t work like that. He’s always going to have scars and sharp edges. His politics might be vastly altered, but that doesn’t make Draco a saint, or a hero. He can still be an insufferable prick. Sometimes, he enjoys it.
When they finish, Harry drops his forehead against the wall and gulps in air. He feels Draco nudging at the edges of his mind again and his filters slip down as a wave of exhaustion hits him. He can’t bring himself to speak but he knows Draco can see the things flicking through his mind.
Eventually Harry closes and eyes and puts his arm around Draco. In response Draco shifts closer until there’s nothing between them at all.
Draco breaks the moment and glares at George and Lee. “Is everybody clear?”
what’s stupid.”
“Potter isn’t saying anything of the sort,” Draco interrupts. “As usual he’s making a total hash of trying to explain himself.” Draco presses his lips in a tight line. “Helping with my case has led people to speculate about Potter’s inclinations, which could have serious repercussions. He would be fired, without question. If it becomes widely known that he’s single, it will only fuel the rumours.”
There are plenty of people in Merlin’s Kitchen who don’t like Draco much, but there are a handful that like him very much indeed. In their small groups they keep coming back, week after week. Perhaps they’re all just looking to be part of something, like Potter. Everyone who lived through unspeakable atrocities comes to find connection in a club with a broken neon sign above the door and a bar stocked with knock-off Firewhiskey.
“Any preference?” Draco sounds hesitant, unsure of himself for the first time that evening.
“Of course.” Draco pulls back to look at Harry with a frown. “Aren’t you?”
we fuck, I am who I am.”
stupid. Draco Malfoy, Harry! Risking it all for him is the stupidest thing you’ve ever done.” Ron gets to his feet, his hands balled into fists. “You’re going soft in the head, saying you’re gay and taking up with that tosser. You could have gone to Azkaban, and I bet he wouldn’t have bothered visiting you.”
wasn’t the best choice of words under the circumstances. “Sorry, mate.”
“I have a personality too, Potter.” Draco smirks. Harry’s ogling mustn’t have been as subtle as he thought. “I think the shower’s warm enough by now.”
“Me and Ginny aren’t together,” Harry continues. He pointedly ignores Draco and the offered shot. “We’re just friends. Best friends. She knows everything.”
How in the blazes did you get that?
these days. Besides, the witch is smoking a cigarette that smells suspiciously like dried Shrivelfig. Draco doesn’t fancy leaving the club as pissed as a Cornish Pixie only to find cigarette burns all over his robes. It wouldn’t be the first time someone’s taken issue with the brevity of his time in Azkaban.
“I have no idea.” Draco’s voice is faint. He stands and turns his back to Harry, lighting a candle in the corner of the room, an unfamiliar tension in his shoulders. “You can’t joke about something like this. You’re no more impervious than I am. Your name might afford you some leniency, but not enough. Not when it comes to being gay.”
Draco shrugs off his blazer and hangs it next to Harry’s coat, revealing a silky blue patterned shirt. He doesn’t bother to take off his boots and the heels tap smartly against the wooden floor as he strides past Harry in slim-fitting trousers, heading for the kitchen. He looks like he’s going for an expensive dinner, not dropping in on a former lover unannounced.
When the quill has finished scribbling out its message, it jumps into Draco’s outstretched hand.
“You didn’t get new gloves,” Harry murmurs. He touches the necklace, the surface smooth beneath his fingers.
“You’ve always been impossible.” Draco’s lips clamp into a thin line and he glares at Harry. “I shouldn’t have come.”
“Morning, sleepyhead.” Ginny grins at Harry. “Bacon’s done. There’s bread, butter and ketchup. I’ve fried some eggs too if you want one. Malfoy made coffee.”
watching you in the showers,” Draco splutters. “Circe you’re such an arrogant wanker.”
“Fuck
Harry looks up, his heart pounding. “Wishful thinking?”
“Maybe in a bit.” Harry stands close to Draco, the heat of his body already making Harry feel more tethered. The fact that Ron was the one who invited Draco just makes it even better. He’s not sure Ron’s going to be up for lots of long evenings sitting around sharing war stories with Draco, but it’s a start. A bloody big start. An open, public support of Harry’s choice of partner at a party with plenty of people that would prefer to see Harry start a new life anywhere else but wizarding London.
Does it matter? Just someone I know.
Draco can’t help but stare, drinking in the spring in Harry’s movements and the pleasing tilt of his smile. Every now and again people approach him and one or another of the Weasleys pay close attention to every interaction, gently moving inquisitive witches and wizards along when they outstay their welcome. It’s apparent from the way his body tenses that Harry is uncomfortable with the attention, but he’s never rude. He answers questions with a smile, keeping conversation brief. Watching the interactions makes it painfully clear there are people Harry trusts and everybody else is just on the periphery.
“Thank you for asking, but no.” Draco glares at her, and Harry stifles a laugh. “This and that. I haven’t decided yet.”
Draco has learned
“Hurry up then,” Draco snaps.
“It can do that,” Draco agrees. He thinks of the first conversation with Griffin and looks away from Harry’s steady gaze. He wishes he was better at knowing what Harry was thinking, when he gives Draco one of those unflinching looks. “I planned to live like a Muggle after the war.”
“Yes.” Draco pulls Harry closer and murmurs against his neck. “Or we could find another one to ignore.”
“Yeah. Until tomorrow.” Harry takes Draco’s offered hand and holds on for a beat too long. “Hey, Malfoy?”
“I wouldn’t expect anything less.” Kingsley chuckles, picking up the paper on Harry’s desk and skimming through it. “I’ve been trying to encourage her to consider running for Minister. I don’t expect Robards to want to do the job for much more than another couple of years. The Ministry needs somebody progressive with a clear vision for the future. Robards isn’t the man for the job.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry sighs, picking up a paperweight and turning it over in his hands. “I don’t like to get bogged down in legalese, you know that.”
now,” Harry says. “That doesn’t seem very discreet.”
I doubt anyone gets off on your flirting.
“How good?” Draco pushes his hand into Harry’s hair, pulling his head back a little. “Tell me how much you want to be fucked.”
An unfamiliar ball of protectiveness swells in Harry’s chest, and he wonders what the Ministry would do if he swept Draco away on his broom and took him to safety. He shakes himself. Draco isn’t a damsel in distress and Harry is here to help him get out legally, not to make them both fugitives. Besides, knowing Malfoy, he’d probably push Harry off the broom and fly away to one of his gay bars.
list of The Year’s Most Eligible Bachelors. They did give him the smallest photograph in the corner of a page advertising invisible cauldrons admittedly, but making the cut marked a small step forward. Naturally, Potter received a two-page spread and a life-size poster. Draco supposes when it comes to eligible bachelors, some are more eligible than others.
“Knockturn’s definitely out,” Harry agrees. The whole sorry mess is much bigger than not being able to go to a bar, but he’s so curious. He wants to go to the places he never knew existed, to be somewhere with people who are just like him—
“George said you’re doing the pub quiz with him and Lee next week. You’d better not embarrass me by getting the Quidditch questions wrong.”
Fine. He kisses you on the mouth. Hard or soft?
, she said when the dreaded marriage conversation came up in their twenties. She still says the same now Harry’s in his thirties and the relief when Ginny makes it clear she doesn’t want that sort of commitment niggles at him.
. “I went travelling. I could give you the full itinerary, but it might take a while.”
It doesn’t escape Harry’s attention that when he kisses sensitive areas on Draco’s neck, the tickle and slide of his beard against Draco’s skin makes him particularly responsive. Harry’s head swims with the masculine scent of Draco and the way he gets so restless and eager in his arms. With a groan, Draco tugs Harry into another desperate, biting kiss. They break apart and watch one another, Draco’s eyes glassy and dark. With deliberate precision, Harry slides Draco’s belt open, holding his gaze.
“I’m all sticky.” Ginny gestures at Harry’s plate. “Your scones are going cold.”
one another. Unless he’s referring to someone other than Jean-Paul, of course. The thought makes jealousy coil deep in the pit of Draco’s stomach. “Which lucky witch or wizard has the misfortune of being on the receiving end of your clumsy affections this time?”
It takes a good half an hour for Draco to run further diagnostics on Harry’s wand and he has the sinking feeling the spell damage has gone right through to the core, although he hopes he’s wrong. He glances at Harry—doodling broomsticks on his notebook as the Bowtruckle snoozes on his jumper—and looks away quickly when his heart quickens. Cursing himself and his own idiocy, Draco tries to focus but his concentration drifts as his mind turns to other things.
On the
you?” Draco laughs and mutters
“I was going to say he looks like that new Puddlemere United Seeker.” Harry looks more critically at the pictures. “You think he looks like me?”
“I can talk to people and make sure—”
“Not a lot,” Harry grouses. He has another sip of his brandy. It’s not bad, if you drink it in very small doses. “I’m thinking of proposing.”
my friends.” Harry puts his hand on Draco’s waist, pulling him in. “Out of the shadows.”
“You might as well be,” Harry replies. He doesn’t mean it, his stupid heart kicking and tripping just as it always did when Draco was around. He runs his thumb against Draco’s cheek, looking into his eyes. “I wouldn’t be this hard if you were a stranger, though.”
“You’re impossible,” Harry splutters. “Just because I didn’t want to hurt—”
“You know how,” Draco murmurs. His cheeks are pink and he trails his hand down Harry’s chest without meeting his gaze. “Don’t get any ideas about this being a regular occurrence.”
“—I don’t want to know the details, fucking hell.
“Me too,” Harry says, sincerely. “I don’t think he’ll be in any rush to go back to Azkaban, that’s for sure.”
in his chest. If there’s ever a time to dare to believe in miracles, to dare to hope, it’s now. “Do it.”
It throws him, admittedly, realising that Harry has more experience. Draco knows objectively he’s attractive and he suspects in contrast Harry has little idea how handsome he is. In his fantasies Draco was a suave sophisticate with a long list of past lovers, showing Harry the way of things.
his brain unhelpfully supplies.
“Morning.” Harry grabs a mug of coffee and bacon and egg sandwich, sitting at the large table. “What have you got planned for today?”
“I doubt many of your friends spoke highly of me before.” Draco glances at Harry. “I haven’t had a personality transplant.”
Forest,” Draco says, pointedly, not that he cares. “I suppose we should be thanking you for your continued service to all creatures great and small.”
“Always.” Kingsley folds his hands together and glares at Robards. The two have never been fond of one another. Kingsley told Harry after a couple of Gingerbread Martinis that he thought Robards had all the political nous of a limp flobberworm. “Minister Robards, I suggest you stop speaking in riddles. I’m sure Harry would appreciate a more direct discussion so he can continue about his day.”
“I’m not a total cretin.” Draco looks down, heat rising in his cheeks. It’s a mark of how much he’s changed that he’s able to bite back the tantrum that threatens to erupt. It would be so easy to tell Harry to fuck off and smash their fragile foundations into smithereens. “I should have said something sooner.”
.” Draco knows there’s precious little chance of either of them keeping their hands off one another at the party unless they take the edge off. He’s also fairly sure McGonagall wouldn’t be too happy to hear her star employee was getting sucked off by Draco Malfoy under a Wiggentree.
, the image of him lying back in bed with his hand wrapped around himself taking up residence in Harry’s brain. “Why do you work from home on Thursdays?”
If kissing can ever be a trustworthy indicator of expertise in bed, there’s a good chance Draco’s going to leave Merlin’s Kitchen forgetting his cloak, his torn shirt and his own name. It’s not that Harry has any special moves, but he goes about kissing with a strident, Potterish force. It’s a very good job that Draco had a wank in the shower before leaving the house as it’s the only thing that spares him the indignity of coming in his pants.
“I wish you hadn’t come back,” Harry whispers to the still room. “Why couldn’t you just stay away?”
“Pritchards brought something to my attention yesterday evening that I simply cannot ignore.” Robards flicks his wand and several pieces of parchment flutter across the table landing in front of each person in the room.
“Of course you do, you flash git.” Draco rolls his eyes. “Are you offering to show me that as well?”
“I’m sure you were.” Hermione laughs, pushing Harry forwards. “Get your mind off romance and get up there.”
They leave in a flurry of laughter.
“Nope.” Harry shakes his head. He takes a sip of the alcohol and tries not to cough at the burn of it in his throat. “Delicious.”
“No. You’re not.” Draco looks up at Harry, his face pale. “I never intended to stay for longer than a week or two. I only sent the note when I realised things were going to take longer than expected. I thought it would buy me time.”
“You would.” Draco rolls his eyes, before his expression softens. “Although if that’s your opinion, I suppose I should take the compliment.”
Draco had no intention of signing up for Quick-Match, the hottest new craze in the wizarding world designed to offer a solution to all romantic woes. Draco is attractive, wealthy, he has his own business and he’s worked hard to become a better man than the child he used to be. As evidence of the time put into reforming his character, last year Draco even appeared on the bumper end-of-year
“You flew.” Draco gestures to Harry’s hair when he opens the door, before stepping to one side to let Harry in. “I thought you were joking.”
“You’re not wrong,” Harry says at last.
Draco does as Harry asks, his cheeks flushed. Harry continues to watch him as the belt clinks open, the slide of leather mingling with their ragged breaths. He slides down the zipper of Draco’s trousers, before tugging the belt completely out of its loops.
doesn’t get herself arrested for giving people blowjobs on Clapham Common. She’s so bloody beautiful she takes his breath away, a warm, happy energy that Harry wants to cling onto forever. “At the risk of giving you another heart attack…”
“What’s that?” Harry pokes at a mushroom vol-au-vent. He hates mushrooms. “Is Robards snogging Rosmerta again?”
“What would you do, Sirius?” Harry asks the stars. “Would you think I’m all wrong?”
Harry takes a long gulp of the booze Draco offered, his head spinning. Panic rolls through him. Ginny knows. Ginny knows and she could mention it to anyone, to Millie, to her friends. He needs to contact her as soon as he can. He kissed Draco in the middle of London, made a spectacle of them both out there where anyone could have seen them.
“Yeah.” Harry shuffles his feet awkwardly, fighting back the heat in his cheeks. He gets why Ron of all people thinks Harry’s gone mental. If the tables were turned and he found out Ron was getting off with Malfoy, Harry would probably think he was under the Imperius Curse. “I know it’s weird. Everything’s changed.”
“No, I imagine not.”
“Not a lot, Robards has been commanding most of his attention. He’s cross with them for firing you, of course. I suspect he’s worried about Ginny too. We both are.”
.” Harry pulls a face. “
“What makes you think I’m not going to do anything about it?” Harry’s desperation to quell the twisted knots forming in his stomach intensifies. He supposes being irritated with Draco is as good a distraction as any.
“I’ve been fired,” Harry says. “Robards knows.”
“I can see that.” Draco’s lips quirk into a smile and he pushes himself off the doorframe, wandering around Harry’s room. “Considering the rest of the house is so awful, this room isn’t too bad. Yours, I assume?”
“Are you—?” Harry gestures between George and Lee.
“Let’s talk later.” Harry sounds completely shagged out. He reaches for Draco, pulling him into a slow, sensual kiss. “Yeah?”
“Unlike some people, I don’t like to leave things unfinished.” Harry can’t be bothered to make small talk about interior design when he’s monumentally pissed off.
“Nowhere at all.” Draco glances at the clothes he left in a neat pile on a chair in the corner of the bedroom, then looks back at the bed. “Do you?”
. If someone names themselves after
“A fat lot of good that was,” Harry mutters. “I didn’t have a clue where you were, you didn’t exactly leave a return address. Then I saw the pictures in the papers. I might have guessed it would be Paris.”
“Not a bit of it.” Ginny shouts to someone in the background. “Don’t forget to say if he tells mum I’ll Bat-Bogey Hex him.”
“It’s getting late.” Draco reaches to check his watch. It feels like a dismissal, and Harry’s stomach drops. “You should stay,” Draco finishes.
“I won’t be. I’ve got people here.” Harry doesn’t know who exactly, but he also doesn’t want Ginny to mess up her day just because he’s had a shit morning. He doesn’t want people to come over and pity him while he tries to pick up the pieces of his broken life. He’s going to be fine. He has to be. “Go. I’ll speak to you soon.”
“I should leave.” Draco appears in the kitchen doorway, because of course he can’t give Harry room to breathe.
He brushes his fingers over the photo of his parents and watches as they turn, kiss and beam up at him. He wishes he could ask them if they still love him. He wishes he could talk to his mum, just for a second. He thinks about trying to find the Resurrection Stone again, about sneaking into the Ministry to see if he can hear Sirius behind the Veil.
“We’ll always be family,” Ginny replies, fiercely. “Even if it’s not the kind of family people expected us to be.”
“Some of this is new to me,” Draco starts. “I don’t want your concern about whether or not my arse can handle your heroic cock. If I don’t like something you do, I’ll have no qualms about telling you. In fact, I would relish the opportunity.”
posted it with rainbows, glitter and a fanfare of excitement. The
Not a clue.
“Not so many of the old crowd, then?” Harry watches Draco curiously, as he shakes his head.
He stuffs the cigarettes in his pocket and makes his way out of the Ministry. Every step through the opulent corridors is louder and heavier than the last. He feels like a marked man, taking his last steps towards the hangman’s noose.
“I didn’t say that. It’s probably as good a time as any we’ll have in our lifetimes. It is what it is.” Draco pauses, his jaw working. “I’ve been thinking a lot about the day you came to see me…the things I did.”
“Are you happy at Hogwarts?” Draco asks. He’s not sure why it’s important to him, but there is still a restless energy that buzzes and hums through the shop whenever Harry’s around. Draco knows a lot about moving from place to place and he supposes what he really wants to ask is
“Astoria made things easier,” Draco replies. His voice is low and thick with emotion. “She was the only person in our world I was truly open with before the law changed. My parents don’t count, because they dragged me kicking and screaming out of the closet and then tried to shove me straight back into it. Astoria was different. There was no laughter, no judgment. She never once looked at me oddly. Some people do, you know. When they find out.”
“Both.” Draco sits back in his seat and presses his fingers together as he watches Harry. “It’s interesting that you have to clarify what I mean. There are so many options, aren’t there?”
“Yes,” Draco agrees. He gives Harry one last, long look, and then moves away entirely. “I think you are.”
sex. But this is something different, something that makes Harry feel as though Draco wants Harry in every way. He’s quite happy to keep fucking Draco and to be fucked in every possible position, with all the magic or none at all and he wants Draco to know it.
“Maybe.” Harry releases Draco and stuffs his hand into his pocket, leaning back against the wall. “I hate it when people ask me to do that.”
“Finally.” Hermione collapses on the sofa in Harry’s office with a sigh of relief. “I thought we’d never get there.”
Harry’s out of the shop in another gust of icy wind before Draco can churlishly tell him it’s nothing of the sort.
, his brain taunts.
It does sound complicated. Do you see much of him anymore?
“Thank fuck for that.” Draco drums his long, pale fingers on the table, clearly agitated. “Let’s hope this works.”
“Well you’ll have to help me encourage her to run, in that case.” Kingsley gives Harry a warm smile. “You’ve been doing well too, by all accounts. Your work with the young graduates has been exemplary and the new Defence programme you established has been a tremendous success.”
“It’s good to have you back. I wish you were in London for good, I miss my best mate and Co-Head Auror at the Ministry.”
“Did this have anything to do with me?” Draco’s voice is level, but he has a strange, twisted expression on his face. Sadness, perhaps. A spark of hopefulness. Maybe that too is wishful thinking.
“They’ll be crawling all over the bars in Knockturn.” Draco narrows his eyes at Harry. “Do you even know we have those?”
“Fine.” Harry needs fresh air and quickly. He leaves the room in a hurry, pausing only to say his goodbyes. “I’ll see you around, Malfoy.”
“Not a problem,” Harry murmurs. His gaze flicks down to Draco’s lips. “This person from school, is this the one that you’ve been fantasising about? Some French bloke told me he’s great in bed.”
“Yeah, perhaps.” Harry clears his throat. “We’ll have to have a party,” he decides, quickly deflecting from the topic of Ginny. “Get all the old crowd together.”
“Malfoy’s a friend of mine, Dad.” George tries to interject, his hand swept away when he puts it on Authur’s arm. “His mum and dad don’t speak to him, he’s not a bad bloke, not anymore. He cares for Harry, he—”
. If he thinks it’s going to solve any of his problems, he’s wrong. Draco tastes blissfully good, sweet like wine. He surges into Harry with all the fight, fire and passion that’s absent from the cool, bored demeanour he puts on most of the time.
“Hermione’s a very different case,” Kingsley replies. “She’s a witch with a young family and a husband who also occupies one of the top positions at the Ministry. If your circumstances were similar, I highly doubt these rumours would continue to persist.”
Did it ever occur to you I might actually be French?
“You’re unbelievable, Malfoy.”
Ron stares at Harry for one long minute and then pulls him into a tight hug. He doesn’t say another word, pulling back after clutching him tightly. He walks away, swiping the back of his hand across his face and Draco watches him, shaking his hand.
“More than.” Harry’s voice is thick with arousal. “In fact, I applaud your spontaneity.”
“What the bleedin’ hell is Malfoy doing bringing Potter to the Thestral?”
“The problem with staff owls is you don’t know where their loyalties lie.” Harry frowns and glances away. “I wasn’t kidding about keeping this confidential. Nobody knows I’m having issues with my wand apart from McGonagall and Kingsley. It’s better that way.”
The words send shivers travelling through Harry’s body. He nods and drops his head forward against the wall. He can hear Draco slicking himself and the coolness of lube between his arse cheeks makes him groan desperately. He gets himself into position and the head of Draco’s cock nudges against him. Harry sucks in a breath and then relaxes his body, reaching back to urge Draco closer.
“No, not really. Things just built up, I started thinking about Sirius.” Harry shrugs. “It’s okay. It’s better, now you lot are here.”
want. We’ll go from there.”
“I’m not trying to achieve anything,” Draco snaps. “Just making an observation.”
“It’s not about money,” Harry says at last. “It’s always been more than a job for me. I don’t know who I am if I’m not an Auror.”
Draco nudges Harry onto his back and moves down his body. They haven’t been doing this for very long, but it’s been long enough that Harry knows the things Draco can do with his mouth are wickedly good. With a low growl of pleasure, Harry drops his head back on the pillow as Draco takes him into his mouth. He clutches a hand in Draco’s hair and bucks up towards him with a hiss of pleasure.
“That’s not how I think.” Harry glares at Draco, trying not to take offence but not managing it particularly well. “That’s not how I think at all. I know who I am. It might have taken me a while to realise it, but it doesn’t change anything. Whether we fuck or not,
“I’ll see what I can do.” Harry laughs, reaching across the table to take Ginny’s hand. She squeezes it quickly, before shaking him off.
“Fuck the goblins.” Draco’s body is tense and tightly coiled. “Do you think I’m incapable of supporting somebody? I expect you imagine I wouldn’t have the first clue how to handle anything difficult. Draco Malfoy, entitled little brat who doesn’t care for anyone but himself.”
“It’s not going to be a habit,” Harry says. He glances up at Millie. “You and Ginny seem…close.”
“You’re
Harry stands and faces his Ministry colleagues. He makes a speech about Hermione’s work and friendship that comes straight from the heart, and it’s a wonder he doesn’t break down in the middle of it.
hipbone.
Despite himself, Harry laughs. “You don’t mind?”
“She did.” Draco folds his arms with a scowl. “Is there a reason you think I’m going to fuck off the minute things get difficult?”
Unfortunately, Harry has no idea that Draco is
Kingsley sighs, putting down the paper and contemplating Harry. “I wanted to talk about Draco Malfoy.”
“Usually, yes.” Draco’s expression is unreadable, his eyes dark as he looks at Harry. His voice dips to a murmur. “Tonight, I have no idea.”
Harry drops onto the bed and props himself over Draco. He gives him a slow kiss, before grabbing his clothes and heading towards the bathroom. It gives Draco the opportunity to have a good ogle at Harry’s naked backside which is just as appealing as the rest of him.
“Up here,” Harry murmurs. He urges Draco onto his knees, so he’s cock to mouth level with Harry. “Didn’t you have a go at me once for asking where you wanted that ex-schoolmate of yours to kiss you? Something about…needing more warming up.”
“Nobody’s being arrested. I had to come straight from work. The Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes had a catastrophe.”
“Merlin.” Despite his sore legs, Harry can’t get upstairs and into the bathroom quickly enough. He lets the steam from the hot water gather in the small room and strips off his clothes. He tries not to stare too openly as Draco follows suit, but it’s difficult.
“Come on, boys! It can’t take you that long to clean a couple of rooms.” Ginny’s voice travels upstairs, and Harry pulls back with a quick, giddy burst of laughter.
, gives the salesman a weak smile and points at a ring with a shaking hand.
“‘Fraid not.” Harry shakes his head, casting a pleading look at George.
“Now you care?” Hermione’s lips tighten, her eyes flashing as she approaches Harry’s desk. “I’ve been trying to tell you how unfair this new legislation is for months, and this is what makes you pay attention at last?”
“I’ll show you around properly,” Harry says. He captures Draco’s lips in another fierce kiss, mumbling “
“Yes.” Draco turns back to the cupboards and rummages around for glasses. “Open the wine, will you?”
“I understand,” Harry says. “You can talk about her, you know. I’d like to hear more about the things you two did, your friendship.”
. I’m keeping a low profile.”
There’s something about Draco that makes Harry unsettled. He doesn’t know what to say, or how to behave. It was easier in Azkaban, when they had a purpose of sorts. It’s harder here, on Draco’s turf. Harry’s never been concerned about saying the wrong thing—least of all to Malfoy—but he finds himself oddly tongue-tied.
“There’s Manchester too,” Draco comments. “I suppose I could come with you, if you’re desperate to see the inside of a gay bar.”
“It’s important,” Draco snaps. “You can’t just hump a wizard against a wall and then decide you’re
Harry nods in silent agreement. He wishes there was something he could do, but he knows Draco’s right. If he wants to keep his job he has to
“Evening.” Ginny stands next to Harry and goes straight for the sausage rolls. He knew there was a reason he loved her. “How’s it going?”
“They do?” Harry swallows, hoping Draco hasn’t picked up on his weird behaviour. He sits back, considering his own reactions over the last few months, and the things that have driven them. “Maybe people don’t want to say the wrong thing.”
Without waiting for an answer, Harry mouths over Draco’s balls. He’s always loved the way he can make Draco come apart with his mouth. He’s half a mind to get Draco to turn over so he can really put his tongue to work, but he decides that can wait. He’s been desperate to take Draco into his mouth ever since last night, which wasn’t enough to quench the thrum of desire that’s been building steadily since the moment he opened the door and let Draco inside. With a
Why are you having such a shitty night?
“Potter?”
“Not a lot,” Harry replies. Kingsley looks miserable. “I’ll just get my things and be off.”
Why the fuck do they send congratulations?
“No.” Ginny grins. “But it can’t be brilliant proposing to a lesbian. Like I said, we’re a right pair of Golden Snidgets.”
In the past, Draco has had little time for finger-fucking, but there’s something about the way Harry responded to the first touch that tells him he should rethink that strategy. The beautiful curve and arch of Harry’s body and the sounds that fall from his lips spur Draco on. He wants to make Harry feel
“Neither would I.” Draco plumps his pillows and settles back with a contented sigh, lifting his arm so Harry can stretch out properly with him. “Have you heard anything from Weasley?”
“She might, but I don’t think many others would.”
. His confidence now fully returned, Draco breaches Harry’s body with a nudge of his finger, the slick of the lubricant making the passage easy despite the tight clench of Harry’s body. Biting back a groan, Draco presses his lips to the small of Harry’s back. With a grunt of pleasure, Draco adds a second finger and begins to fuck Harry with them.
Harry laughs. “She’s taking the Magical Congress by storm already. It’s only been two weeks.”
“You’re so fucking sanctimonious.” Draco scowls at Harry before returning to the papers. “You know that’s not what I’m referring to.”
“When have you seen me dancing?” Draco glances down at the beer garden, the realisation dawning that Harry’s been back in London for two months now.
.” Draco glares at Harry, certain his headache is getting worse by the second. “They put people in Azkaban for less. Have you been going through my desk drawers?”
“Something they’re prone to I bet.” Lee nods at the table of Slytherins. “We’re going to have to change our team name this week. The Slytherins are giving us some right funny looks. They’re probably wondering how we convinced one of their lot to join us.”
“You thought what?” Draco narrows his eyes at Harry.
“Next Thursday?” Harry asks, hopefully. “If you’re at a loose end.”
By eight o’clock in the evening, Harry is bouncing off the walls. He’s showered—twice—eaten half a ham sandwich he nearly threw up, had two whiskeys and he’s toying with whether he should risk going for a fly, despite the fact he knows he’s had too much booze. He’s so distracted he’d probably end up getting his head knocked off by a jumbo jet, just to really top the week off. As he miserably pours himself another drink, the sound of loud knocking on the door pulls him from his thoughts. He checks himself quickly in the mirror—jogging bottoms, t-shirt that doesn’t have stains on it and bare feet—and decides it’ll have to do. He sincerely hopes it isn’t Pritchard come to take him to Azkaban for being a pervert. With a scowl, Harry yanks open the door and prepares to tell Pritchard to do one.
They pull apart to wash quickly and Draco—as promised—shampoos Harry’s hair. When the suds have been rinsed away completely, Draco presses Harry back against the tiles, front first, the hardness of his cock against Harry’s backside a delicious promise. With a groan, Harry puts his hands flat against the tiles and presses back into Draco, sucking in a breath. It makes him so hungry for more, so eager for Draco to just take him and whisper all manner of filthy things in Harry’s ear when he does so.
“Right.” Harry smiles against Draco’s skin, murmuring something which sounds deliciously like
“How rude not to ask about Harry Potter’s greatest achievements or the length of Godric Gryffindor’s sword.” Draco’s lips tilt into a smile. “Good night?”
“No. It wouldn’t be weird.” Harry fishes around in his pocket and hands Ginny the ring, taking a breath. “Sell it and get a new broom, or those gloves you wanted. It’s yours.”
“You found it okay, then?” Harry sits opposite Draco after grabbing a pint of lager for them both.
“I—” Harry sounds unsure. He’s calm but insistent when he speaks again. “It would help to know.”
“I was, though.” Millie shifts in place next to Harry. “I fancied Parkinson something rotten at school. But Pansy always collected pretty, shiny things. Like a magpie. I reckon I embarrassed her, following her around like a big lummox. She did my makeup once and laughed herself silly afterwards. I’ve never been much good at pretty.”
It’s weirdly refreshing, speaking to someone who isn’t fixated on all the things that have been making Harry so out of sorts lately. His head’s been all over the place, the niggling idea he’s living life all wrong growing at a rapid pace. He’s so fearful of time moving on without him, it’s all he can think about some days. Even his favourite Sunday roasts at The Burrow have lost something of their shine. It’s as though he’s dragging his heels when everybody around him is so eager to see him
He really does want to understand, to
The door closes behind Harry and he’s plunged into a sensory whirlwind. The room is darkly lit, but there are plenty of people inside and the floor shines and glints with the reflection from a huge mirror ball magically suspended in the air. Disco music hums and twists around them, the songs unrecognisable to Harry. He peers behind Draco who grouses over a small entrance fee which seems to be an unexpected levy—
“I just want you to be happy,” Kingsley replies. His voice is gruff. “It’s the very least you deserve after everything you’ve done for the rest of us. Don’t choose a path that’s going to make things difficult for you.”
It turns out, perspective is everything. When you’re fucking the Seeker, everything is different. Draco whoops and cheers so loudly Zabini starts giving him dirty looks. Draco doesn’t know what Zabini’s problem is. At least he’s not wearing a Gryffindor scarf, Merlin forbid.
Harry flicks through the magazines, noticing that one model seems to be Draco’s favourite from the couple of particularly well-thumbed pages. “Wow. Don’t you think he looks like—?”
Probably not. I tried, for a very long time. I regret that, too.
“Not quite.” Lee shifts into the seat next to Harry and leans in, explaining the origins of the balls. He offers a huge array of information about America, houses, transgender communities and something called
is. Seeing Harry in the flesh in his shop today put things into perspective. It’s a lot easier to have an illicit correspondence-based affair with someone when they’re not standing in your shop looking sad about their wand, arranging private consultations and calling them
“If he can put up with us all for long enough.” Ginny retrieves a couple of packets from her rucksack. “He’s certainly not flying back to Wiltshire or trying to Apparate after one of my Hungarian Horntail cocktails. We brought eggs and bacon for breakfast. We got them from a farm in Abercynllaith, the bread and butter too.”
After finishing the call, Harry sits heavily on the sofa and stares at the things he brought back from the Ministry. One box and the broom he treated himself to after being promoted to Head Auror. That’s all he has left from the years he spent there.
They’ve been naked together before, but Harry’s never really had the chance to look at Draco’s body quite so openly and doing so makes his mouth water. Draco really is gorgeous, from his toned, tight arse to his ridiculously Malfoy-ish hair. It’s not the lithe lines of Draco’s legs and torso Harry’s most focused on, though. His eyes keep flicking beneath the light trail of hair that leads to Draco’s cock. He knows what it looks like. He’s had it in his hand, in his mouth. But seeing it half-hard and heavy between Draco’s legs leads Harry’s mind directly to other things he could do with it. The other things Harry desperately wants him to do.
Millie and Draco begin a heated debate about whether or not Pansy Parkinson is the
. I suppose you should show me your wand.”
“I’m not so sure about that anymore.” Harry sighs, shaking his head. “It could be better for you.”
“I asked that.” Harry gives Ginny a lopsided smile. “It’s different when you’re married with kids. Less chance of the rumour mill going into overdrive. He seemed to think the rumours would soon go away if I proposed.”
“Here.” Draco pulls another wand from the shelf, passing the box to Harry. “Try this one.”
“Like I said. Paperwork.” Harry drops a file onto the desk, eventually settling in the chair Draco suggested. “You need a witness for these.”
“They didn’t.” Draco sighs. “I know the area we were in like the back of my hand. I’ve got no idea how you found that dreadful pub of yours, I can’t think of a single witch or wizard that would choose to spend time in that area unless they had business there. The only people that do business in the City are Gringotts employees and I’d have recognised them. It was dark, nobody was around.”
and the modest living quarters above it may not be as grand as sprawling country piles or as exclusive as his old Knightsbridge townhouse, but over the last couple years it has felt increasingly like home.
“Draco.” Harry curls his fingers into Draco’s hair, his voice bringing him back to the moment. It’s a tether to the present. “Stop.”
“Right, of course.” Harry clears his throat and gives Hermione a wink, plastering a smile on his face. “I was miles away, thinking about seeing Ginny.”
“It’s a load of bollocks,” George says, fiercely. “Lee said they’re talking about it in Knockturn. People don’t know of course, but some of them have their suspicions. There are folks there that would come out fighting if you wanted them too.”
“Why do you think I’d want to go somewhere like that?” Harry’s heart thuds in his chest, his stomach churning.
. Draco looks at the ring he always wears on the third finger of his wand hand which is also his wanking hand. He didn’t think for one moment about the possibility a random wizard would know the old pure-blood family crests. Trust nosy-parker Potter to have done his research.
Harry breathes out, relief flooding through him. He’s not sure that’s how a doting boyfriend in his thirties should react, but if Ginny doesn’t care, Harry’s not going to worry too much about it.
“Don’t worry, it’s not.” Kingsley looks apologetic. “It is, however, a little delicate.”
“I’ve seen you dance, Malfoy.” Harry snorts with laughter. “Stop trying to pretend you’re cool.”
He understands what Draco’s doing. Lee and George aren’t stupid, and they clearly understand what Draco’s doing too. They know exactly who this mysterious new man of Draco’s is. Even though they seem amused at the idea of Harry and Draco, he can tell by the concerned looks they keep giving him that they see the seriousness of the predicament. Harry knows that Draco doesn’t want to risk any public statement being made, even if the quiet pub seems relatively safe. He’s probably right. Harry knows as well as anyone how easily private conversations can be overheard, how the press can use every tool at their disposal—legal or not—to get a story.
“I don’t snoop.” Harry shrugs. “Sorry.”
“He’s been in meetings with the goblins.” Harry doesn’t want Draco to see him like this, pathetic and untethered. “Draco’s had enough on his plate. Me losing my job doesn’t compare. I’ve still got savings, I’m not going to starve.”
“I’m not—” Harry stops, drawing a breath and glaring at Draco. “I have a girlfriend. Keep your hands to yourself, Malfoy.”
“How romantic.” Ginny rolls her eyes. “It’s the love story of every young girl’s dreams. A nice, handsome man proposing because it’s going to be good for his career.”
“You are entitled to an impartial representative, Head Auror Potter.” The witch looks up from her note taking, speaking as if she’s reading from the book of official Ministry employee protocol. “You are welcome to choose another representative if you wish.”
,” Harry growls. “You’re not firing me because of Malfoy, leave him out of it. If he was married and we were off on a fucking holiday to France together with our wives, you wouldn’t have a leg to stand on. He hasn’t been a person of interest for years—not seriously—and you know it as well as I do. I closed the case on the Malfoys myself. You might remember? It happened soon after I killed Voldemort while you lot sat on your arses and—”
Mmm, I bet he does. He sounds like he’d be great in bed if you ask me.
obviously. Where the fuck do you usually kiss people?
George looks confused, his eyes travelling between Draco and Harry and it’s clear that the penny drops. Lee’s mouth drops and he gawks at Harry for a moment before closing his mouth again and giving George a questioning look. “Did you know?”
I’m having a shitty evening. I thought about going to The Purple Niffler, but I’m knackered and I have to work tomorrow.
“I wouldn’t have thought your Defence classes would need much supervision.” Draco takes Harry’s form and settles at his desk to read through it. “If anybody knows that subject, it’s you.”
“You’re enjoying this,” Draco murmurs. He opens Harry’s jeans and pushes his hand down his pants, circling his fingers around him. “You want this.”
The dark behind his eyelids turns blinding white until all he can see is stars.
“I thought Gin might show up today.” Ron gives Harry a careful look. “Not having any problems are you, mate?”
“I’m glad,” Harry replies, softly.
Are you always this charming?
“You can leave this with me,” Draco says, when he’s finished reading the form. “I won’t be able to make any proper assessment until I’ve done more reading and looked at the wand at the weekend.”
“Yes.” Draco begins to make Harry a coffee anyway and takes a moment to watch Harry nosing around the shop like he’s still an Auror sniffing out any signs of trouble. He doesn’t have a clear sense of why Harry left the Ministry for Hogwarts, when his Auror instinct still seems as sharp as ever. Harry is alert, astute, and lately Draco is far too easy to read, which is just another one of a long list of reasons why he should spend as little time with Harry as possible.
I don’t know anymore. I like this rough kissing idea. I bet that gets you hard, or it should if he knows what he’s doing.
“You didn’t think I knew.” Harry looks back out of the window, his voice quiet. “That’s why you’ve been so weird.”
Draco keeps his eyes on the food, not looking at Harry as his voice takes on a serious, uncertain note. “Those Aurors of yours came to one of our bars in Knockturn when you were in Wales. Did you know that?”
“Very well.” Robards sits back in his chair, studying Harry. “Auror Potter, reading between the lines it appears that Draco Malfoy has been harassing you. If you file an official complaint he will be dealt with appropriately. I expect imprisonment and a restraining order that prohibits him from contacting you again should do the trick.”
“You know what.” Ron looks up. “It doesn’t matter, I’m not here to talk about Gin. I can’t believe you’d be stupid enough to risk your job—”
“You’re Harry Potter,” Ginny says fiercely. “That’s who you are. Not the Ministry, not some government department. They didn’t help you much when you needed them. They let a young boy fight their wars. They’d be wise to remember that.”
It's not the night for tenderness or slow lovemaking. Harry chases his orgasm and knows Draco is doing the same. His fingers drag down the wall as Draco fucks him and with every thrust, he grunts and pushes back for more, deeper, harder, faster. He palms his own cock until Draco pushes his hand away and brings him to a bone-shaking completion.
“Not nearly as dreadful as I expected,” Draco agrees. “Do you want to come to the Manor afterwards?”
Draco turns his back on Harry and falls asleep at the far end of the bed, but when Harry wakes just before dawn he notices how Draco has made his way nearer to Harry over the course of the night. He watches him sleep, taking in the soft curl of his hair over his forehead and the way he smiles as if he’s having a good dream. Harry’s heart gives a restless kick and he swallows, touching Draco’s shoulder lightly and listening to the rise and fall of his breathing.
“I don’t care who you fuck,” Draco lies. He bites back a groan as Harry’s lips travel along his neck. “Would you do this on the dancefloor too?”
Circe, you must be hard up. Do you ask for them often?
“Subtlety isn’t my strong point.” Harry winces.
“Weasley has good taste. In more ways than one.” Draco sniffs the bottle before putting it back down. When he pulls back, he’s close enough that Harry can feel the heat of his body and he knows with absolute certainty that Draco can’t be oblivious to Harry’s reactions. “Cologne smells different on everyone. It’s the way it reacts with the skin. What suits one person might not suit another.”
but I just have magazines. I imagine my tastes are more cerebral than yours.”
Harry takes a soothing sip of his tea and tries not to imagine a world where he’s left with nothing at all.
“There’s going to be a next time?” Draco ushers Harry down a quiet cobbled street, stopping under a small arch away from the hum of traffic and the chatter of late-night bars and clubs. “Careful, Potter. People will start to talk.”
. That was the lie you made me tell everyone, because you’re a bloody coward.”
“Aren’t there?” Harry gives Draco a quizzical look, before his expression clears. “Perhaps not.”
“He shouldn’t stay away,” Lee says quietly. “How’s anything going to change if nobody sees how disgustingly happy you are?”
“I forgot to ask how you take your coffee—oh.”
The truth of it hits Draco like a hex. He really doesn’t have anyone better to do. No one comes close. He can tell the startled realisation is etched all over his face by the way Harry’s eyes narrow when he pulls back momentarily.
“I’ll make sure he doesn’t,” Hermione soothes. “Don’t worry about that, not now. That can wait.”
“I didn’t know.” Harry swallows, seeing Draco’s opulent cinema room in a whole new light. He thought it was a vanity project, somewhere for Draco to relax. He never considered it was connected to Astoria.
“Damn it all.” Draco turns away from Potter and shoves through the crowds at the bar. Vodka is the only way to dull the rusty feelings that return shiny and new, with overwhelming force. “Move, will you?”
Harry steadies himself with his hands on Draco’s waist. “Is it…okay?”
“I might take you up on that. Thanks.”
“This is why some of us work for organisations that only care about how much money we can make for them.” Draco interrupts Harry’s thoughts, getting to his feet and putting one of his paintings level. “Stop panicking. It’s not as if you’re going to do anything about it anyway. Nobody will ever find out.”
“I like you.” Harry glances at Draco. “Quite a lot, actually. Is that okay?”
“At least you’re terrible at something.”
“You’re in trouble, Draco Malfoy,” Draco tells the empty shop. “You’re in real trouble.”
Harry winces. “It depends which rumours you’re on about.”
“There are,” Draco replies. His eyes rake over Harry’s body with such hunger, the path they trace seems as intimate as fingers stroking against Harry’s skin. It sends heat into Harry’s cheeks and he rubs his jaw, clearing his throat and hoping he doesn’t look half as flustered as he feels. “Then there’s you,” Draco murmurs.
“Yeah.” Harry swallows. “I’ve read the bits that matter. I know about keeping things private, how strict it is. I’m not daft. I’ll be careful.”
“There’s an exhibition on at the Tate. You and Harry could—”
“Very bold of you, Potter.”
Harry has a feeling arguing over Lucius will only make things worse, so he changes the topic. “How’s your mum now?”
“The rooms aren’t very tidy.” Harry hasn’t dusted properly for the last couple of weeks. He keeps his home nice as a rule, but cleaning’s been the last thing on his mind lately.
“Astoria’s death was a slow and difficult one and I was with her for every single day of it. Her parents had all but disowned her by that point, my parents had stopped all communication with me and it was just us against the world. She lived with me in the Manor. When she couldn’t sleep, I lay in bed and read to her. If she didn’t fancy that, we watched films. Astoria loved Muggle films.
“That’s right.” Draco’s heart quickens and he focuses on his hot chocolate instead of Harry. “What’s he like?”
“Not in the slightest.” Harry’s jaw works and he meets Draco’s gaze at last. “What makes you say that?”
“That’s right!” Draco crows. “Weasley’s coming back too, isn’t she? I
“Lucky you.”
Harry supposes there’s no point in denying it. It wasn’t as though Draco Malfoy appeared like a blinding light and Harry suddenly decided he didn’t like witches anymore, thanks to Malfoy’s irresistible charm. The arrest was a catalyst, though. It forced Harry to think about why he kept avoiding political discussions relating to homosexuality with such tenacity. It meant he couldn’t avoid it anymore. The gnawing guilt, lying by omission, the growing fear and the itch beneath his skin all spiralled from that one pivotal moment. Malfoy’s stupid moment of recklessness kickstarted something into action. The desire to spend more time around Draco is just a small part of a much bigger mess, another thing that scares Harry shitless, another question he doesn’t know how to answer.
“I wish,” Draco mutters. He glances at Harry. “Did it ever occur to you I might have plans this evening?”
“I could be dancing with you
Harry thinks back to Draco’s case, chewing his food thoughtfully. “You were arrested on a Thursday.”
He sits back with a smile, already looking forward to the weekend.
as Kingsley put it. He moves off the sofa and gets on his knees, between Draco’s parted legs. Draco’s breath catches and he reaches out, taking off Harry’s glasses and putting them on the side. There’s something so intimate about it, so careful, it makes Harry’s chest tight.
now you can’t go around shagging people in public?”
“Am I wrong?” Robards sits back in his seat, watching Harry. “If you tell me I’ve made a mistake we can ensure the rumours are quashed and quickly.”
“You’re over thirty fucking years of age, I don’t believe for a second—”
Harry laughs, running his fingers down Draco’s chest. He doesn’t mind forced civility, if it’s worth it, and Draco’s newfound openness makes Harry certain that it is. He’s always trusted his intuition, and he feels instinctively that this time will be different.
“There’s a reason I’m telling you all of this.” Draco rubs his temple and for the first time Harry sees how tired he looks.
“Sorry it didn’t live up to expectations.” Harry takes a sip of his tea, wincing as it burns his throat. “Next time I’ll roll the red carpet out or put up bunting or something.”
“I know a spot that should be dead at this time.” Draco begins walking, and Harry falls into step beside him. “At least I’ve escaped the threat of a kebab.”
“What makes you think you still have me?” Harry watches Draco’s face twitch in a familiar pattern of surprise, hurt and then controlled neutrality. “Sorry,” he says, averting his eyes. “That wasn’t nice.”
Draco’s Friday lunchtime stroll around Hogsmeade is completely ruined by the sight of a magical hologram of Harry, diving and twisting through the air in his Quidditch leathers. He’s got half a mind to tell McGonagall that it’s obscene to let a member of staff wear leathers that tight for promotional purposes. The Hogwarts Alumni Quidditch Friendly might be the star of the end of term holiday festivities, but that’s no excuse.
“Yeah.” Harry nods, his stomach churning. “I want you here.”
He’s about to make another smart remark in response, when Harry stops tracing butterfly kisses over his shaft and mouths over him, taking his cock into the back of his throat.
When he’s finished, Harry strips out of his t-shirt to put on a fresh one. Cleaning is a lot of work when you’re racing around the place. Harry hasn’t used this much magic so quickly since his last training duel.
He flicks his wand and Summons a photo of Hermione and Ron that he kept on his desk. It’s only a matter of time before Ron’s informed about Harry’s dismissal. Despite Ginny’s reassurances, Harry knows it’s not just Ron being a protective big brother he needs to worry about.
“It’s not difficult for any of them?” Harry doesn’t mean to be obtuse but Ginny’s experiences are so different from his own. The whispers, the gossip, the eagerness to go into Knockturn and make arrests. He can’t imagine a gay witch or wizard having an easy time at the Ministry.
Where do you work? I don’t think you ever said.
“Don’t get dressed on my account,” Draco murmurs. He puts the photograph down and moves close. For one heart-stopping minute, Harry thinks Draco is going to kiss him. Instead, he reaches around Harry to pick up the cologne. “Is this Muggle?”
.” Harry moves his lips over Draco’s ear, down his warm neck. He murmurs against Draco’s skin. “I reckon you think about it a lot. I think it gets you hard.”
“Why on earth would you think that?” Harry leans against the wall, catching his breath with a gulp and Draco studies him, his hair dishevelled and soft and his shirt crumpled. He’s so fucking gorgeous it makes Harry’s head spin.
The house is too still, too quiet. Harry smokes one of Sirius’ cigarettes and regrets spending so much time tidying the garden the other weekend. It would have been a good way to keep himself occupied today. In the end, Harry roots around in the cupboard for an old, dusty bottle of Ogden’s. He remembers Sirius sitting at the sprawling table in the kitchen, tipping the bottle in Harry’s direction. He sits on the sofa and swigs down a sharp, strong gulp.
hero,” Draco corrects. He runs his fingers lightly over the growing bulge encased in Harry’s jeans. Naturally he’s hung, because there seems to be very little about Harry that isn’t specifically designed to make Draco lose his fucking mind.
Draco watches Harry leave and he settles in his seat when the door closes behind him with a sigh of relief.
“Hand.” Harry raises an eyebrow as if he didn’t know exactly what he was implying, a smug look on his face. “You wear a signet ring with the Malfoy crest on. It’s not very subtle. Your Quick-Match Quill’s really loud too, obviously you didn’t read the instructions about turning the vibrations off. I could hear you getting notifications when I used to send you messages at the gym. That confirmed it.”
, he had declared just before midnight on New Year’s Eve. The sun had barely come up on the first day of the year and he’d already broken two of his resolutions by eating the last remaining chocolates off the Christmas tree and having a flat glass of Asti Spumante for breakfast. Now that he’s been tasked with fixing Harry’s wonky wand, the situation has grown even more dire, as evidenced by the fact he’s reliant on Evaporates from Harry Potter for sexual gratification. It’s so pathetic, he could scream.
He rests his head on Draco’s chest and listens to him snoring as he watches the sun come up.
“I know.” Draco checks his drink, pulling a face at the confirmation that yes, his glass is still empty. “I know nothing about your recent past, and you know everything about mine.”
that arrested me? Perhaps that fact escaped your notice when you came here demanding gratitude.”
“You’re unbelievable.” Draco’s rotten mood is getting worse by the minute. It’s typical of Pansy to pull two seconds after getting into the club. The most action Draco’s had in weeks is a peck on the cheek from his mother. “You can’t just abandon me.”
“I’m glad it meets with your approval.” Draco glances at a Muggle who pops open a bottle of champagne, holding it aloft with a cheer. He pulls a face. “I can’t believe this is your stomping ground. I don’t even like coming here, and I actually work in finance.”
“Yeah.” Harry swallows, thinking about Molly and Arthur. It was so difficult seeing them from across the room, like strangers. It breaks his heart to be so close to them without speaking to them as he usually would. “It is what it is.”
like him. Despite the frustration that grips him, he knows it’s a risk he can’t take. “Even the Muggle bars in London won’t be safe. Too many Aurors patrolling or drinking nearby.”
“Perhaps.” Draco pushes a hand through his hair, frowning. “I wouldn’t stay away if I wanted to see people, but everything’s different now.”
pretending being fucked doesn’t scare you.”
Draco stares at his Passion Parchment. Blue sapphire leather, crisp, thick parchment and an exquisite high-response quill. Draco might not have wanted to join a matchmaking service in the first place, but once he finally decided to sign up, he made sure he had the most expensive package. Nobody mentioned anything about
“I’m lucky you’re stubborn as a centaur.” Draco looks up at the crisp, clear sky. “It’s starting to snow.”
“You might not know me yet, but you’re family now,” Millie replies. “You’re part of this odd little tribe of ours, and there’s more of us out there than stars in the sky.”
“You’re right. It is embarrassing. It’s embarrassing for me that you would sooner pour out your woes to your friend—who’s supposed to be in America incidentally—than your…me…who lives within easy Apparating, flying and Flooing distance.”
“I expect you got the edited highlights.” Draco swallows. It’s infuriating that he knows absolutely nothing about Potter’s recent past while his own is apparently gossip fodder for the inner circle.
Harry knows there’s a danger in believing in ghosts and he breathes in, shaking his thoughts away. He’s trying to do as Draco suggested—to take comfort in the living instead of the dead. Harry wraps his arms around Draco as he steps back from his task of stripping Harry’s wallpaper off the walls.
“I haven’t got the job yet.” Hermione laughs.
“Because of me?”
“Wasn’t she, umm—?” Harry stops, unable to phrase
as he puts it. His whole mood is more energised than usual and he seems in his element, chatting and laughing with people Harry doesn't recognise before going to change his outfit.
“Yeah.” Harry takes a sip of his wine, the light booziness making him more relaxed than usual. “But not for the reasons you think.”
“I didn’t know we were doing that.”
“You haven’t even read it, have you?” Draco turns around, his face pinched and furious. “You don’t even
“Why are you really here?” Draco looks at Harry curiously. “It’s Thursday night, you have plenty of friends and I imagine there are countless people angling for a post-work pint with you. Yet here you are. Drinking wine with a criminal.”
a scandal.” Draco stands abruptly, turning his back to Harry again as if he can’t look at him. He presses his palm against the wall and leans against it, seemingly lost in thought. When he speaks again his voice is rough. “You could lose everything. Your Weasleys, your job, your friends.
“Why did you bother paying me then?” Draco replies, grouchily. He eyes Harry, who moves a little closer to Draco. “Although it will still take some work to restore your wand back to working order. It’s a delicate process. You can’t just rip a wand apart and put it back together again.”
“My own training center?” The idea gives Harry a small seedling of hope. “What if nobody bothers coming?”
“Is that why you left?” Draco has always been curious about Harry’s sudden move from the Ministry to Hogwarts when everything seemed to be going so well for him. Although the salacious gossip columns about a failed relationship with everyone from Kingsley Shacklebolt to Hermione Granger were entertaining, Draco didn’t believe them for a second. “I just assumed you and Weasley were Ministry men.”
“Yeah. I've had fun.” Harry watches Lee on the dancefloor, doing something that he now knows is called vogueing. He’s learning bit by bit, excited to find out more about Knockturn's bars and the secret lives of his friends that spend time in them. “We’ll come back?”
“What does that mean?”
“Don’t you want to show Robards he’s wrong?” Ron asks.
“Obviously,” Harry lies. He helps himself to a couple of the dishes, getting the gist of it quickly. He takes a bite and tries not to groan at the delicious taste. He makes a mental note to look up tapas restaurants when he gets an opportunity to do so. “It’s good.”
“If you say so.” Draco waves a careless hand in the direction of the door. “Bugger off and let me get on with my work. Try not to destroy another wand before you book your next appointment and send back the paperwork as soon as you can.”
Harry clears his throat, a flush of heat creeping up his neck and into his cheeks.
“An incorrect observation, for what it’s worth.” Harry presses close to Draco, whose arousal is evident. He brings his lips to Draco’s ear, keeping his voice steady. “You have so many opinions on my sex life. Why is that?”
.” Draco moves to the bed and gets under the duvet with Harry, letting him curl in the crook of his arm. His feet are bare, but he’s otherwise dressed like he’s off for a day in the office. There’s something weirdly comforting about Draco’s crisp shirt and warm body, and Harry burrows closer.
“Thanks for reminding me.” Draco spears his fork into a prawn, aggressively. “Thursday used to be for other things. If that can’t happen without Pilchards—”
Draco winces. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
“You truly are a heinous dancer.”
“Thank you for this.” Harry reaches for Ginny’s hand and squeezes it. “I was in a spot of bother at the Ministry earlier. I needed company.”
Draco nods and sends his mug of coffee to the kitchen with its industrial concrete surfaces, bricks and brushed steel. The cold décor mingles with the warmth of Harry’s magic, the chatter and laughter from outside and the lights that flicker in the living space like flames.
Then no. I do just fine in English. When it comes to talking dirty, I can hold my own.
“He’s got a nice bum.” Harry grins and watches Draco send the magazines back into a drawer with a lazy curl of his wand and a murmured spell. “You seem to like those too. The arty photograph downstairs, that model of yours…”
Harry grits his teeth. Even if Draco is playing a political game in Azkaban for self-preservation, Harry’s certain any regime spearheaded by one of Voldemort’s followers would be just as dangerous for Draco as it would for Harry, after the latest round of publicity and scathing remarks about the ‘morally repugnant’ lifestyle of the sole Malfoy heir.
“It’s different now. Everything’s different.” Draco pauses. “You’re a good man, someone who possesses the kind of courage I’m not sure I’ll ever have.”
“I kissed Malfoy,” Harry blurts out. He means to say
“Oh good, they’re playing my favourite song.” Pansy squeals with delight and drags Draco down the corridor and into the club, shimmying to the music as soon as her feet touch the dancefloor. “Don’t stand too close, darling. There’s a witch over there I’ve been dying to speak to for weeks and I don’t want her to think we’re involved.”
“I’m fully aware of the circumstances of your arrest,” Harry replies, tightly. “My team arrested you because you broke the law—”
. He knows and he’s still here, hard, wanting and not running off back to Hogwarts. All the times Draco refused to let himself hope come spinning back to him. Sinking to his knees is almost an act of reverence, his mouth eagerly seeking out Harry’s cock, determined to bring him to the height of pleasure. His heart sings and it seems as though Harry’s magic swells through the room. Draco has learned the art of magical empathy over six long years of training. He can feel every tick and hum of a wand, every flicker and pulse of magic. He usually needs to hold the wand, to try to gauge its mood, its core, its soul. With Harry, he just needs hot fingers pressed against damp, sweaty skin. The magic fills the room, every quiver and shake of it, the steady, solid heartbeat of Harry Potter’s magic occupying every corner of the shop.
, there's an energy I can't describe.” Draco stops, shaking his head. “You'll just have to see for yourself. Besides, there's always the Muggle bars if you want rainbows. I'll take you out to Manchester's Canal Street.”
“Are you always so bloody patronising?” Harry can’t stand Draco’s taunting, the way he just
“You’re being deliberately evasive.” A flash of annoyance courses through Draco and he leans in, lowering his voice to a hiss. “You know precisely what I mean.”
“Oh?” Harry’s mouth gets dry and he takes another sip of his coffee as his heart pounds more quickly.
“You won’t. Not if you’re with me. I know an Auror in a Glamour by now.”
“I appreciate you telling me.”
It takes less than five minutes for Draco to return and grab the Passion Parchment and Quick-Match Quill, just in case.
of pleasure.
If the enthusiasm exhibited in the next half hour is anything to go by, Harry is all too happy to oblige.
Harry yanks on his t-shirt and follows Draco downstairs. Ginny hands him a drink and gives him a knowing look, which he ignores. The living room has been transformed, the whole space now bathed in light, with poppy, upbeat music filtering around the room. He supposes it’s a trick she must have learned from her parties with the Harpies, and he’s definitely not complaining.
“Stop it.” Harry laughs under his breath. “They’re not vile at all. I think Thestrals are beautiful.”
“It must be difficult,” Harry replies. He glances at the portraits again, a shiver travelling down his spine. He envies that Draco has parents who are alive, the chance to reconcile, but he also can’t imagine the pain of being rejected, like Sirius, for following your own path. “Sirius was kicked out when he was sixteen because of the things he believed. He lived with my dad for a while.”
“I wasn’t sure what to buy so I got…lots of alcohol.” Draco gestures at the drinks on the packed table, patting a spare seat he clearly saved for Harry.
“Oh.” Ginny pulls a face, taking another bite of her scone. “I suppose I could. There’s a practice at three, but I could fly back Saturday evening.”
“It became difficult for him at times, a single man living the life of a confirmed bachelor with connections to known homosexuals.” Kingsley waves a hand. “It was never anything more than hearsay but when people sought to remove Albus from his office, they offered a highly persuasive argument that he wasn’t fit to hold his position as a guardian of young children on account of his rumoured preference for other wizards.”
“I’m going to jump in the shower before I make coffee. Fancy joining me or do you want to have one after?”
“Millie and I are going to fly out to Oxford and go for a walk. There’s a little pub Millie found on the river for lunch. If the weather stays nice, we’re thinking of going punting in the afternoon. Then back to Cardiff for the evening. We’ve got plans with friends.”
“You can, you know.” Harry pulls back momentarily and wipes his lips with the back of his hand. His eyes are shining and he gives Draco an insolent smile. “I know you want to.”
“I don’t believe anybody lives here.” Draco changes the conversation, his voice thicker than usual. He clears his throat and points to the brickwork that stretches high into the air above the beer garden. “No windows, for a start.”
“You like wanking you mean.” Draco hopes Harry knows he’s only teasing. He thinks he would miss Griffin’s adventures with all creatures great and small if they had to give up Quick-Match altogether. “How do I know you won’t go off looking for new wizards?”
—there are three fingers inside his body and Harry isn’t gentle about using them. It’s not quite as intense as the pleasure Draco imagines he could get from Harry’s beautiful cock, but it’s damn close.
“Just tell her.” George’s voice is low and soft. He sounds young and frightened.
“She’s changed a lot since school. I don’t think you’d even recognise Millie now.” Ginny sounds oddly sheepish, which is ridiculous. It’s not as if Harry in any position to judge peculiar friendships after becoming pals with Draco Malfoy.
“Did you come here much before the law changed?” Harry tries to imagine Draco skulking around talking in secret codes. He's not sure he can picture it.
“That’s my name, don’t wear it out.” Flint emerges from the shadows, his expression tight. “Would you shake my hand too, Potter? Or am I too
Draco’s jaw works. “Shut up, Potter. That’s completely different.”
As Draco moves onto the bed, the hot silence gathers between them, and Harry is so ready for something, anything. He pulls Draco over him and kisses him soundly, sliding his hands down Draco’s back and pressing his fingers against Draco’s hot skin.
“Enlighten me.”
“It’s not my idea, mate.” George shrugs, the fire crackles and more ash falls onto the carpet. “Lee reckons it might give us an upper hand. There’s no point having three people mad about Quidditch and not much else on a team. I bet Malfoy’s the sort to read books.
“No, I didn’t think you knew.” Draco’s mouth gets dry and he yearns to reach for Harry to bring him closer, but he isn’t sure he still has the right. “How long have you known?”
“Oh.” Harry gives Draco a careful look. “How are you getting on, really?”
“So brave,” Draco taunts. Despite his tone a flicker of surprise and uncertainty crosses his face, his lips twisting as if he’s fighting a battle within himself. “So
“Can’t believe they booted you out, though.” Ron’s clearly angry and a small shoot of hope takes up residence in Harry’s chest. Ron brightens. “If Hermione’s Minister you could come back.”
“You do that.” Harry lingers by the buffet table and helps himself to a sausage roll. He’s definitely had more than the polite share, but he reckons he deserves it. Half of the room keeps gawking at him like he’s got an Erumpent Horn on his head, and he’s the one throwing the bloody party in the first place. If he wants to eat all the sausage rolls, he will.
“Sounds great.” Harry presses his lips together and stuffs his hands into his pockets. “Not much happening here. It rained on Wednesday, they ran out of satsumas at Tesco on Thursday and I got fired for being gay. Oh, and your parents aren’t talking to me anymore. Because of the gay thing. It’s been pretty quiet really.”
“I will be when you start fucking me,” Harry replies. He bites back a groan at the slick, cool sensation of lube between his buttocks and the thick, blunt pressure of Draco’s cock against his hole. He wets his lips, thinking of the response when he asked
“If you like.” Harry has the same amused tone as before, a playful smile making his eyes shine. If Draco didn’t know better, he would almost think Potter was flirting with him. “Look, about malpractice—”
“More than a handful, I’d say. It’s amazing what you find out about people on the grapevine in a place like that.” Harry drains the last of his coffee and reaches around Draco to pocket his wand. “I take it we’re all done for the day?”
“I don’t know what the fuck you’re planning to do.” Draco snorts. “I didn’t think you’d try to get yourself off against my thigh, for a start. That was unexpected.”
The paucity of alternative drinking venues is why Draco finds himself standing in line, wondering if he should have bought a book. It’s no different to any other Friday which always ends the same way. He’s so bored of queuing in dutiful single file for the privilege of paying an exorbitant entrance fee to get into the shittiest nightclub in England. He loves a long, boozy night as much as the next person, but the effort required for a warm vodka orange and tomorrow’s inevitable hangover doesn’t exactly fill him with joie de vivre.
Harry’s not entirely sure what he’s doing but just like the last time, he gets the gist. He knows what feels good and he can tell from the way Draco scrapes his teeth along Harry’s neck and grinds down in response that it feels good for Draco too. Their bodies get sweaty and slick, the hardness of Draco’s cock against Harry’s driving him closer and closer to the edge. Harry wants to take Draco in the palm of his hand again, wants to roll them over and suck him, to see every inch of him stretched out on the bed. He wants to reach for his wand and get rid of the material separating them, but he also doesn’t want to stop. He’s like a teenager again, frotting and grinding as he chases his pleasure with desperate urgency.
“Doesn’t the coach care?” Harry asks.
“Can you?” Harry’s voice has a breathless quality to it. He would almost be embarrassed, but Draco doesn’t seem to care.
. The muddled, dreamlike confusion during the hottest spike of pleasure ebbs away entirely until there’s nothing left but bitter remorse, self-hatred and a futile, desperate anger Harry hasn’t experienced in a very long time.
“Great.” Harry leans back on the sofa, closing his eyes as he tries to steady the anger and confusion he can’t quite shake away. “I’m glad they think so highly of me.”
“Um.” Harry glances at Draco, his cheeks flushing. “Yeah, if you like.”
“How unlike you.” Draco sounds amused.
“I’m going to bed.” Harry looks out of the window. It’s still pitch-black outside but the rain has stopped. “It’s late.”
—were you
When Harry makes his way upstairs, Draco follows.
“I couldn’t give a toss, Potter. Do you want to fuck me or don’t you?” Draco’s refractory period is usually a little longer, but from the desire that makes his body ache, he’s certain this is what he wants.
“No, it’s not a real subject and if it was, the last thing I would want to do is teach it.” Harry laughs under his breath. “Are you this rude to all your paying customers?”
“Pretty sure the Muggles don’t like you getting your cock out in public either,” Harry points out.
. It’s all such an utter mess. Despite the supposed anonymity of Quick-Match, Draco knows exactly who
Even saying that is bold, but Harry keeps his tone bland enough so as not to raise any suspicions.
“I do.” Harry shifts uncomfortably in his chair and concentrates on Hermione.
“Do we need to?” Instantly flustered, Harry panics at the thought of bringing Draco out with Lee and George. “I’m not sure a quiz in the Leaky’s really his thing. You know what Malfoy’s like. All posh wine bars and fine dining.”
He collapses on the bed and buries his head in the pillow trying to catch his breath. He’s quite sure he’s never come quite so intensely in his life before, his heart pounding in his chest. He rolls over to find Draco watching him with a stunned look on his face.
“Potter?” Draco seems to realise something isn’t quite right and he touches Harry’s arm. “You went out hours ago. I assumed you were talking things through.”
, his brain whispers. He tugs at the collar of his t-shirt and clears his throat, eager to change the subject. “You mum wants you to come back next weekend.”
“Not this time.” Harry settles on the sofa, pushing his toes into the huge, shaggy rug that occupies most of the floor space. If he ever gets around to making Grimmauld Place less depressing, he might have to call on Draco for some tips. “You could make a living out of this.”
“The fact you want to hold hands or the fact we can’t?”
“What choices are you making now?” Harry turns on his side to look down at Draco, drinking in the sharp, angular lines of his face and the cloudy grey of his eyes.
“Someone?” Draco sounds surprised and intrigued. He seems to have shaken off his earlier malaise and he props himself up on his elbow, watching Harry.
“Don’t be a fool.” Draco shoves a shot towards Harry. “Have your drink and be quiet.”
“It’s a start.” Harry glances at Draco. “Is that what sent you running off to Paris?”
Any idea what the terms and conditions say?
“Yeah, you’re right. I am.” Harry sighs. Comments like that are par for the course with Draco. They don’t make him angry, not anymore. It just makes him tired and sad. “Is that what you wanted to tell me?”
the time. It seems right that Draco should arrive bang on the hour, even for a visit he didn’t bother to arrange. He’s always been punctual.
“I’m not going to get in trouble with the Muggle police though, am I? Not these days.” Draco looks up from the papers. “It’s only our world that’s completely backwards.”
