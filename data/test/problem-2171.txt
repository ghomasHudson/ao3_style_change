“That’s right!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “He’s more like your brother. Now out!”
“Definitely a strong Americano,” Harry answered. He already knew Ron’s order by heart, what with the number of times they grabbed coffee for one another during stakeouts.
“Him or me,” Zee said defiantly. “If you’d let me walk away after I’ve been on this team for three goddamn years then I don’t know what I’m doing here in the first place.”
He finally met her eyes and for a long moment they sat there staring at each other, Draco trying not to jump to his parents’ defense even though he knew exactly how incredibly wrong it was.
Finally, Draco got his first real glimpse of wherever it was he’d landed. There was a run-down shopping center, loads of straggly green grass, and a one main road that looked as if had clearly seen better days judging by how cracked and holey it was. He began to wonder if he’d completely gone mental. This was
“Good point,” said Potter, nodding.
“Come here, Malfoy,” Harry says affectionately, pulling the blonde into his chest.
Everyone, even Nate, roared with laughter at their little skit even as Zee’s face flushed an ugly color of puce. Reveling in the amusement he’d help cause, Harry glanced around to see that Malfoy was the only one (other than the disgruntled Zee) not smiling. In fact, he was staring at Harry almost as though he’d never seen him before. He didn’t look upset, otherwise Harry would have accused him of being a homophobe; instead, Malfoy wore an almost hopeful expression, one that quickly turned into a look of hunger. The emotion Harry could feel coming off of Malfoy was so strong he had to look away.
He proceeded to spend the next hour giving Draco an overview of the process: the research entailed to find funders, the level of knowledge he would need to have about the company and its programs, and, of course, the several different components to the actual grant. Draco was to come by the actual nonprofit organization later that week to officially start working. Draco didn’t need the money, but he was delighted anyway to find out that the internship was paid. It felt more like a real job that way.
Asten laughs, as if he knows exactly what Harry is trying. “You’re a witty one. Only a few others have ever had the inclination to try to counteract the potion by shielding their mind. It’s not going to save you, though. There’s only one antidote, and that’s not it.”
Draco stared at him like he’d lost his mind. “Martians?”
“Turn over.”
He was too tired to think of a proper retort and instead led Potter to the far side of the garden to where properly maintained Malfoy property was taken over by wild lavender fields. They’d cut a few pathways in-between the wild stalks, but otherwise left the lavender alone. After working in the garden, Draco would often come out to the lavender fields and watch the hundreds of butterflies. He heard a sharp intake of breath as Potter saw them; it was a while before he could form a sentence.
“Off the library so early in the term?” McGonagall said, almost disapprovingly. “Especially without Ms. Granger around to remind you of the importance of your studies?”
“I told him that he can start this week, doing one lesson on any day he wants.”

All too soon, I climb back down and continue on my way up. There’s a firepit with some ashes in it, a water spout, and a rusty old bucket. Minimal, but I wasn’t expecting much else. The hilltops are gorgeous, bathed in a golden yellow light, and I enjoy the last few rays of lights as the sun dips below the horizon. Suddenly it’s dusk, and I’m up here all alone in a place that I hate.
“Sounds like an enlightening experience, Potter.”
“Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said. “Were you listening when I addressed the other eighth years about room arrangements? I very clearly stated that couples of any nature would not be permitted to room together.”
Rolling his eyes, Draco opened his mouth to say that, yes, he was
“Er, bathroom,” Harry manages, even as he is filled with dislike for Seamus.

today?”
They’ve already resigned themselves to the prospect. I tell them, “If you leave me here in this godforsaken hellhole, I will murder you both and that’s a promise.” They assure me they won’t leave without me, but I only half believe them.
He wandered into the living room, noticing that he was now wearing a very posh summer suit and holding a bottle of Odgen’s best Firewhiskey. “Naturally,” he replied smoothly, immediately noticing the company adorning what he presumed was their living room. As Harry crossed over to collect the bottle, Draco greeted his old friends. “Hello, Pansy, Blaise.” It was never part of his expectations to see them again in his natural lifetime. And judging by Harry’s appearance, this was in the next couple of years after the first glimpse.
Nate grinned, and caught Harry’s eye. “Almost there! As long as we can clear it with Zee and Mike, we’re golden.”
Without warning, Draco crashed their lips together again, kissing Harry more passionately than he ever had before. “You don’t,” he said mischievously.
Draco pulls his finger out immediately, albeit gently, and cleans it before snaking his way back up Harry’s body. “I’m sorry, love,” he murmurs, kissing Harry full on the lips. The next minute, Harry’s drawn back into the moment with Draco, having already forgotten about his painful memories. “It’s okay, Draco,” He whispers, hugging Draco close into his chest and claiming Draco’s mouth with his own. “I thought I could do that, but it’s still too hard.”
The nicotine felt like heaven served up on a silver platter. For that brief cigarette, he permitted himself to think about the gentleman two tables away that’d been having the time of his life with
JANUARY 1999
“Harry!” she exclaimed exactly the same way he’d anticipated she would.
He didn’t offer Granger his reasoning. She looked thoughtful for a moment, tapping anxiously on the tabletop before suddenly lighting up with understanding.
He anxiously tried to remember what he’d just done, and, giving it his best go, thrust down into what he hoped was Draco’s prostate. The reaction was immediate. Draco gasped, tightening his hold on Harry’s neck and wrapping his legs around him even harder.
“Of course you’re not,” Harry said as soothingly as he could manage. A disgruntled Draco was not something he wanted to deal with. “Come up just a little higher?” He pulled on Draco’s bum to make his point.
“Now you sound like Hermione,” says Harry, good naturedly. “I think she’s rubbing off on you, mate.”
“Well,” said Harry, still smirking. “You have the rest of the summer to explore your outdoorsy side. Though I’ll still prefer you all pale and pointy,” he tacked on after Draco glared.
“Of course,” she retorted, “It’s called sticking me with it.” She fixed him with a look saturated with self-pity, but Draco refused to give in. Finally, she sighed and snuck her arm around his. “Draco, love, you do know that we have to earn ‘Acceptable’s on our performance reviews this summer, right?”
Draco looked at the ugly ring on his finger with the Malfoy crest. He wouldn’t do that the honor of being left for anybody; it just wasn’t worth it to him. So with difficulty, Draco took off the pendant necklace Mother had given him when he was just a young child, the one he’d worn around his neck for years and years to keep some small part of sanity and comfort; to remember who he was above all else. This necklace did not symbolize his heritage. Instead, Mother told him that it symbolized comfort, forgiveness for oneself, and inner peace above all else.
“Yes,” he says, completely serious.
together.”
“Ginny,” Harry repeated. “I don’t feel anything. I can’t do this anymore, with you.”
“Shit,” Malfoy said. “We’re going to have to go soon, you know.”
Draco didn’t say anything; couldn’t say anything. The door was supposed to be impenetrable because of his status as Malfoy, so why had it admitted Father to Draco’s private quarters?
“Same.”
Without another word, but still with a mile on her face, Mrs. Weasley closed the door, cutting off the delicious aromas coming from within.
“Mr. Potter, I insist. Organizations from across the Wizarding World have been contacting Hogwarts and requesting for you to champion their causes, and, I must say, some of them really have the best interests of society in mind. It would only take a few minutes to look over some of the propositions—”
Hermione gave him a scandalized expression. “Of course not, Ronald,” she scolded. “We aim to avoid firing our weapons whenever necessary, you know that!”
It takes second to realize his eyes are closed, probably from the brilliance of the treacle tart, but Harry opens his eyes and almost drops his fork to the floor. Draco’s standing in the entrance to the kitchen, dressed only in a soft white towel, hair tousled and still wet from the shower.
“Of course it does,” says Draco as though this fact should be obvious. “Mechanics are everything, no matter what you’re doing. Try the Sloth Grip Roll without proper posture.”
Draco noticed the change in Harry’s behavior, responding to it by nuzzling close to Harry’s ear – all the while without missing a step – and breathing “Want to go look at those case files?”
But even as an intern, Harry had noted some major differences between the Aurors in Britain and the ones in California. The British Aurors were more action-oriented, more willing to get their hands dirty, less motivated by tactical safety. Not to say that they didn’t carefully plan out operations, but there was a workplace style perhaps best embodied by Mad Eye, even if he was at the more extreme end of things; the British Aurors had an overwhelming preference towards operating on judgement and gut feeling, trusting comrades from base to provide further direction if it should be needed. Stateside Aurors contracted other experts to come in and work on the ground, preferring to watch their plans unfold from the safety of the office. There was more respect and prestige accorded to Aurors Stateside, but Harry preferred the grittier, hands-on-methods of the British force. He knew Ron secretly agreed with him, but because it was easier to advance ranks in the U.S., they’d so far silently agreed not to talk about it.
“I’d rather not be,” Draco whispered. “My head—” he broke off suddenly.
The week was creeping by slower than Draco could reasonably handle. He and Potter had completed several more renovation projects at Hogwarts, and his community service hours were racking up faster than he could have ever possibly imagined (probably because Potter saw fit to keep them there from eight am to eight pm, every
“I might have told Draco that I love him,” Harry admitted.
Draco and Potter continued on in silence, their footsteps loudly echoing in the empty halls. “There’s a couple reasons,” Potter started after they’d reached the Room and safely escorted themselves inside. “First, I’ve never been with anyone in that way before. I assumed that when I was, it would be with Ginny or some other girl, not my—”
“You might say I’ve decided to take on a little extra responsibility,” Harry said, grasping the paper crane Draco had returned.
“Yes,” he said finally, glaring up at the ceiling. “I bloody well liked it!”
“Now now,” interrupted Betty Lou, laying a hand on Zee’s shoulder. “We talked about this, hon. You’ll be coaching some of the softball girls with me, remember?”
“I can’t begin to count the reasons why
“Since we’re playing twenty questions,” said Hermione. “How was it, anyway?”
“Time to get wasted!” Cale crowed as Harry walked in the door. He was already pre-gaming with beer, in his natural habitat watching the Cubs face off against the Mariners. On the adjacent sofa, Chris nursed a flask of vodka, nodding at Harry in greeting.
Another figure entered the room, but from his vantage point, Harry couldn’t tell who it was. He didn’t have to wait in suspense for long.
“I asked him if he’d lost the plot, and he told me that his team desperately needed a right fielder. He didn’t seem to care that I was only visiting at the time. Seemed pretty convinced that I’d fall in love with New York City and never leave.”
“And I won’t use magic, either,” Harry promised, trying to nudge them back into that easy intimacy they’d had only a moment earlier.
When Draco finally emerged from the shower, he dried himself and his robe with a Drying Charm so that it fluffed around him and caused static electricity with his hair. Grimacing, he exited the bathroom and wandered into the kitchen, where he found ‘Dromeda making a cup of tea.
Malfoy turned haughtily away and started impatiently chucking balls into the bucket.
But they both noticed that something was wrong on the next thrust. Harry pulled out and saw that he was totally and completely flaccid. Humiliated, he looked down at Ginny and saw that she was blushing as well. He had no idea what to say.
Everything around him ceased to exist as Draco pleasured him. Harry’d never imagined trusting someone else so much to be able to let his guard down completely, but that’s what happened with Draco.

“Tell me that you didn’t start dating Ronald Weasley again. Tell me that Weaselbee isn’t the one who proposed to you.”
SEPTEMBER 1998
As soon as it lit, however, he was disarmed by an angry Harry. "You broke up with me by letter? Why would you do that, Draco?"
“Harry! So glad to see you,” beamed Kingsley, foregoing a handshake in favor of a quick pat on Harry’s shoulder.
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
He appreciated that Potter didn’t want to hurt him, but Draco also loved it like this – slow and sensual. He clutched at Potter’s face and kissed him with everything he was worth, pouring out fourteen years’ of frustrations with Potter, a lifetime’s worth of agony from his Father, and rebellion against his marriage to usher in something that felt purely right and good at the same time.
Snatching the clothes from under his nose, Malfoy made for the bathroom as Harry shook his head wearily. Really, sometimes he thinks Malfoy just finds it amusing to give him a hard time. In fact, the blonde wouldn’t be nearly so bad if he’d just lighten up a little and take out whatever stick that’d crawled up his arse. Speaking of Malfoy’s arse, Harry found himself again wishing that he could examine it much more thoroughly in peace. It’s pert, round, and utterly delectable – and Merlin’s saggy balls if it doesn’t look a hundred times sexier when he’s wearing baseball pants…
, and then magically arrange acceptance at the University of his choice. Hell, if college kids partied like he’d pretended they did earlier that same day, this could be fun. Smiling, Draco concentrated on images of palm trees without humidity, knowing he’d easily make it to San Diego.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
He couldn’t keep himself from groaning at the mention of
As he paused to draw breath, Harry tried to break in, but Draco determinedly kept going. “There’s nothing else for it, Potter. We’re going to have to stop this. It’s been fun and all, but I won't have you giving up everything for me. You won’t be the Saviour anymore, you’ll become the Scorned or something as equally horrendous.” He yanked a small paper crane Harry had made earlier that day and shoved it towards him, though Harry could see his hands shaking rather badly. “Here, you can have this back. We’ll go for a clean break, because I can’t stand to have mementos of you around me—"
That was bold. But Draco supposed he expected nothing less from such a Gryffindor. “I did,” he said, feeling his cheeks turn red.
Though they’d both received a warm welcome to the Burrow for Christmas, Harry was uncomfortable with spending the holiday in such close proximity to Ron, especially after their most recent blow-ups at Hogwarts. Harry and Draco had collaborated with Hermione on whether or not to attend the Weasley festivities and had learned that, though she also had a standing invitation, she was also leaning towards not going. Other members of the Weasley family disagreed with their decisions but respected them all the same; admitting Ron could ruin the festive cheer at best and start an all-out shouting match at worst.
That was honestly more than Harry had been expecting. “Right, then. Can we talk for real?” He was afraid of pushing Malfoy away again, but hell if they were going to get through this without being honest.
“Deal.”
to put you first. I want to put
“Of course.” He closed his eyes again, basking in the affection. After a cheeky kiss that left Draco reeling for more, Harry shucked on a pair of pants and headed off into the kitchen to make breakfast.
“Weasley, I was just fucking with you,” Draco said casually, watching Harry and Granger for clues about how this interaction should go.
“See, that’s what I reckoned would happen the first time,” Harry explained, breathless, once Draco pulled away.
“Their Bloody Mary is fantastic,” Kingsley said in an undertone. He clapped Harry on the shoulder again before excusing himself and walking away.
He finds he’s still dressed in yesterday’s clothing. Good. That saves him the trouble of tiptoeing around his best friends’ house: Malfoy already had them much too worried about him. He quickly writes a note for Ron and Hermione and sets it on their coffee maker because even before going on a rescue mission, Ron has to have his caffeine. He tests another Levitating Charm and isn’t even dismayed to find out that it still doesn’t work. Doing magic might not be in his best interest right now anyway.
“Oh yeah, for sure,” Steve said, immediately forgetting his head pain. “I just heard about this new brand, and it would legit be perfect for you. It’s a bit expensive though; is that a problem?”
Their written conversation carried on throughout the class. Though they wouldn’t obviously be talking anyway, Harry felt quite ignored by the end of the lesson. Sometimes Draco would catch his eye, and they’d share a secret, private smile, but there was none of that today. Instead, when the professor asked them to practice the concept, Draco and Hermione cast quickly, demonstrating their mastery of the skill, and then went right back to their conversation about crocheting. While he was in the middle of the third attempt at casting correctly, Harry caught a glimpse of the parchment—Draco had taken to drawing crochet chains and stitches to properly inform Hermione of the different techniques.
Harry toed off his shoes and flopped down on their rug, stretching out the muscles he hadn’t taken the time to cool down. “I invited Malfoy out with us tonight,” he said casually.
“I think about her all the time,” Ron said, making room at the table for food being delivered by the waitress. The fries were salty and the burgers were juicy, so there was silence for a few minutes as they bit in, tasting everything. “You obviously want him back, so what are you going to do about it?”
Ron nodded in agreement. "You've always known. And it's making me sick the way you've been dicking Ginny around for the past month. She deserves more, mate."
“I’ll have you know, Potter, that in a real race you wouldn’t stand a chance. Plus, you had an advantage. What are those spiky things on your feet?”
Draco flushed. He’d never been to community college, not really. That was just part of the application he’d had to forge to be admitted to the University. However, he did have more extensive training in writing than the average student. Lucius had provided him with a private tutor up until he went off to Hogwarts, and McGonagall and Snape were never shy about pushing him to develop stronger writing skills. From fourth year on, he actually tutored writing – but only for students who were willing to keep it quiet. Couldn’t have that ruining his reputation.
Draco made his way to the grate, looking back at the last minute. “Thanks for-”
Lacing his fingers tightly in Draco’s hair, Harry said, “That depends on my definition of ‘everything,’ Malfoy."
“Tonight?” Hermione said. “But Draco, we still haven’t gone through those supplemental reading tomes from Malfoy Manor…”
“You might have to give him a week,” Draco smirked, apparently already over it. “Admittedly, I wasn’t expecting you to expand on our prompts in quite that manner, but I’m glad you did. It made for a better interview.” Harry snorted.  “It did,” Draco insisted, chuffing Harry’s head.
“–-and I’ve read at least eight -–”
“Cheers, mate,” Ron said, nodding at Harry. “Malfoy,” he said, much more subdued. “I owe you an apology. Several, in fact. If you’ll hear them.”
Oddly enough, he was pleased with her resulting blush. “It’s not that, Malfoy,” Hermione hissed, slamming down the issue of
Once he’d managed to tear his eyes away from the image, Harry was met with the declaration
“Agreed,” mumbles Harry sleepily. He fumbles around for his wand on the bedside table, quickly cleaning them up. “Do you need healed, Draco?”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed. He waved his hand through the air, nonverbally and wandlessly. The members of Joe Buck Yourself stood around them, frozen in time, and Harry refused to be impressed with Malfoy’s cavalier use of magic that was, quite frankly, impressive. “Stuff the innocent act, Potter. I know you followed me out here. What does the Ministry want now? Are you here to
It was Friday night, and for some strange reason, Nate had blessed them with a rare Saturday morning off. Draco and Potter were back at the pitching and hitting grind, making up for the practice they weren’t going to get the following day.
“After you, Potter,” answered Draco, gesturing for him to Apparate away.
“Then why are you dancing here?”
. Resigned to scrubbing that section of the floor on his hands and knees, Draco had some second thoughts. “The dishes are perfectly suited to fill the rest of my morning,” he said smoothly. “At noon, we can begin our revisions over another pot of tea.”
He knew he was close the moment he stopped caring that Potter was the star of his fantasies and only wanted
“You’re not just doing this because of Harry, are you?”
The bat felt heavier in his hands than it should have. Maybe it was from sore muscles, but it could have equally been from nerves. He’d only been doing this sport for a week, honestly. What qualified him to coach it?
Draco eventually had to nip out to go to the bathroom, and as he left, he could hear Harry and Mrs. Weasley start talking. Deciding to let them have some privacy, Draco returned to the back yard to see what the rest of the Weasleys were up to.
Someone’s touching his hand, but he’ll be damned if he can open his eyes right now and face a concerned do-gooder. He tries taking deep breaths, and they seem to have the calming effect everyone always says they have. After a few minutes, he opens his eyes and sees the old homeless man from the back of the bus stroking his hand. The man’s eyes are kind, so he smiles a watery smile at him by means of a thank you. He understands that the man’s touch probably helped him regain control. He’s patted on the shoulder once, twice, and then the man walks to his seat. Looking back, he sees him returning to an overfilled backpack and a small carton of food.
Eventually, Mike and Zee made it down to the field, and Nate practically choked them in rage about being late and anticipation about their answers.
to work with someone who actually understands potions theory.”
“How about a mimosa?”
“As Master Draco wishes,” Ceeley conceded, revealing a red, rectangular box that was so pristine it must have been wrapped by magic. “Breakfast is ready in 15 minutes, sir,” she notified, backing out of the room and closing the door behind her.
. I became much keener on the idea of Muggle technology after I learned what a bloody nuisance it is to have to do everything without magic. Sometimes I can dream about the feeling of my wand; I dream about doing magic, but then I wake up and everything is as a bleak and colorless as I remember the world to be.
Finally, Potter tugged off Draco’s shoes and tossed them to the side, followed by his trousers and pants. While looking right into Draco’s eyes, Potter descended down onto Draco’s cock, taking it into his mouth – Draco appreciated that he didn’t tease – and down to the hilt before gently sucking in a way that made Draco’s eyes snap closed. The sensation was amazing, and Potter only made him feel better and better, especially as he started adding a little tongue flick on every other upstroke.
Harry and Ron followed her out, clutching their favored weapons close, and, almost as an afterthought, Ron opened the trunk and pulled out their weapons duffle. Hidden behind the barbershop, they carefully eyed the amount of open space they were required to traverse before they could hide behind a closed dollar store. Harry knelt on the ground, near the clearing, ready to spring into action if need be, while Ron very carefully peered around the cement wall.
Draco introduces Harry to his favorite hobby, and Harry delights in seeing Draco so excited.
“Thankfully not,” Hermione said grimly, “But we’ve got to get a move on unless we want that to happen. There was a piece published last month in a different journal that’s related to our idea—we’re going to have to mention that, you know—but no, this is, well, something different.” She looked very uncomfortable. “Here, just take a look at it.”
“Thanks, Draco,” Harry said.
“That’s not the way this one works,” Harry grumbled. The wind seemed to finally blow out of his sails and so he arranged himself comfortably on the sofa next to Draco. “Molly wants to apologize for the Howler and duly note all of her concerns at the same time.”
“Alright, mate?” he ventures, nicking a taste of the pie filling. Merlin, Hermione’s improved drastically in the kitchen since Harry started helping her cook Saturday night dinners.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Ron rolled his eyes as he turned on the tea kettle. “Anything else, your majesty?”
Malfoy helped out by watching videos about how to play each position, but Harry still devoted a night to positioning where he lectured on the different nuances of each one. He was most familiar with the outfield, specifically center field, but could do the rest justice, though a little rusty with catcher and pitcher. It was a good thing Malfoy had been neck and neck with Hermione at the top of their class in Hogwarts, because there was a ton of information being thrown about and it was definitely in his best interest to remember everything. That had always caused Harry difficulty; after the test was over, he promptly forgot all of the facts and dates he’d learned, but Malfoy seemed to take education in stride, even enjoying it. During the brief downtimes at team practice, he’d ask Harry to quiz him on what each position would do if so-and-so runner(s) were on base, pushing for prompt questions to which he’d give rapid-fire answers.
“I don’t have access to the internet. If I have to go back to the bus to start searching, then we’re definitely not going to be able to practice tonight.”
Unsurprisingly, Potter snatched Draco’s hands and locked them above his head, breathing heavily in the interim. Eyes darkening, he roughly asked, “Are you sure about this?”
“That sounds wonderful,” Draco answered, still formal despite the warm welcome. Charlie continued to fix up Draco’s plate, putting small portions of nearly everything on there—except for the asparagus because those were his favorite—and handing it to him before gathering his own food.
“Really, you doofus. I like pleasing you, you know.”
“Potter, you’re wasting my prep time,” Malfoy replied. Harry shook his head as he unlocked the door and disappeared into the apartment.
“Please do,” sighs Harry. “I haven’t seen him since then. I don’t think there’s anything to say. But look, this is about us, not what happened. I don’t want this relationship to be centered around the fact that I got raped.”
“Good morning,” she said, at a loss for what to say. They made quite the pair with Ron standing on the doorstep, hand shoved awkwardly through the back of his hair and his elbow turned up, sheepishly slouching, while Hermione remained inside the house, slippers firmly behind the door sill, trying not to wring her hands in the way Draco sometimes did when he was uncomfortable.
“Merlin, I certainly hope not. Are you ready to go back to the castle? I’m freezing.”
“Not quite,” replied Harry, grinning. “Blimey, though, how’ve you already forgotten our deal? Remember? You take me to three mysterious places around London, and if I have fun, we go on a trip.”
“I’m not sure I believe you,” Hermione snorted.
it would make,” he sniped with a hint of a smile.
Jake laughed, and finally met Draco’s gaze. “I want to stay friends with you too. I can’t promise I’ll be, um, perfect about everything, though.”
one could possibly do, and Draco intended to soak up every moment of pleasure he could.
Unable to resist from tucking in any longer, Harry retrieves a clean plate and spoons out some of the delicious dessert. The reflection he tried to do earlier seems more elusive than ever, and all he can process is Draco made him his own personal treacle tart. He’s savoring every bite, unable to help the nagging feeling Draco cooked for him out of love. Only a moment later, Harry’s convinced he must be going insane, because he and Draco are only just becoming friends. But
“It was my choice,” she said patiently. “Very few of the top apprenticeships are in London, and I’m ready to go back to London. And like I said, I’d rather work with someone who can teach me how to bridge my capabilities in Potions and Care of Magical Creatures. Don’t worry, Draco. At the risk of sounding a little full of myself, I can achieve greatness wherever I work.”
“Malfoy! Put the rake down and go help them take the waste to the dumping grounds!” Macmillan – no,
“Potter,” Malfoy suggested, running his fingers through Harry’s hair, “Try your magic again.”
—clearly needed more. I’m sorry that I didn’t chase after you, that I didn’t try harder to get you back after we broke up.”
“Take your clothes off, love,” Harry whispers, intoxicated by Draco’s beauty. His lover complies and Harry takes the upper hand, dumping Draco ungraciously on the bed and coming to rest between his legs.
Potter was rigidly sitting in an armchair downstairs, taking small bites of the chocolate biscuits Tipsy graciously provided. She’d also indulged Potter in his mad taste for morning pumpkin juice. Draco walked over to him, deciding in the spur of the moment that he was going to try and put Potter at ease. “Potter,” he said, clapping down his left hand on Potter’s shoulder. “Let me have one of your biscuits.”
He was completely floored when Potter kissed his cheek and pulled him to his feet. “I’m going to walk you over to Shady Glen,” Potter said determinedly. “Stay here.”
Ron and Hermione keep a close eye on Harry and he loves them all the more because of it. Several times, they’ve found him in his bath, too exhausted to get out. There were some low points where he didn’t leave his house for a few days, at least until Hermione and Draco lured him out with homemade food. On the by and large, Harry continues to improve and his bad days are fewer and farther in between.
“Potter, would you not call flying around on a broomstick moving?”
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
Draco hadn’t imagined sex with Potter involving so much talking. The man never seemed to be able to form a coherent sentence any other time. “Yes,” he mumbles, blushing again.
the other to make them whole, Harry couldn’t deny that Draco complimented him, and vice versa.
“If he goes,” said Zee angrily, “Then everything will be fine. I just don’t understand why you insist on having such an inexperienced moron on our team.”
Behind him, Draco could feel Hermione trembling. Really, though, he too was expecting the potion to have worked by now.
would be allowed to help rebuild Hogwarts.”
“Fucking,” Hermione said, sniffling. “Thanks for confirming it, by the way. I thought maybe I was just unrealistically projecting what I thought sex should be like, but you actually
, Potter. You had no idea where he was leading you.”
“That’s what you said, isn’t it, that your job was righter than anything had ever been for you before. Including me.”
“Do you smell that?” Harry asked suddenly.
He sits down across from Malfoy, helping himself to a few pieces of pizza and a generous helping of salad. As he picks up his first piece with his hand, Malfoy eyes him almost distastefully and cuts up his own pizza into neat bites with his knife and fork. He smiles. Malfoy’s changed a bit, but some things always stay the same.
“Better not to do all the work if someone else’s already had the same idea,” agreed Draco. “How fast can you read? Provided Harry doesn’t distract me, I can probably manage at least ten issues a day.”
“Well, Ron,” interrupts Harry, “Have fun with ‘Mione tonight. We can get drinks tomorrow instead?”
“Have you seen your admirer up in the stands? Been staring at you for the past fifteen minutes.”
Draco must have unconsciously made a face, because Karl soothed, “I’ll talk you through it. Lie down for me?”
Ron quickly holds up his hands. “Okay, okay, stop talking about it! Have I mentioned lately that I hate both of you? And Harry, it’s your own damn fault if Seamus puts you in an awkward situation where he insinuates that you’ll have sex with another man.”
Harry smiled as if her little anecdote meant the world to him. “I’m not surprised. Come here already, ‘Mione, I want to hug you.” Hermione stepped forward, grinning back at Harry, and they embraced warmly in the soft afternoon air.
“Not nearly enough,” breathed Jake. “Do you want me to stop?”
“It wasn’t that bad, just ‘Never thought I’d see you stooped so low, Malfoy, to be playing in the dirt like a gardener.’”
It feels almost foreign to sign his name again. Potter is the person he used to be, but isn’t sure he wants to be anymore. Without reading over the letter, he roughly curls it back up and attaches it to the owl’s leg. Before he can talk himself out of it, he retrieves the antidote from the accompanying small golden pouch and drains it, loathe to let Malfoy’s hard work go to waste. The effect is immediate: he feels power rushing through his veins, reorienting him to a part of himself he didn’t know was missing. It’s almost like coming home after a hard day at work. Damn it if Malfoy isn’t right again.
“France.”
Eagerly, Draco sits up and practically rips off Harry’s remaining clothes, desperate to return the favor. He sucks cock well, always remembering to add the little twist at the end Harry is so fond of, and soon Harry is groaning and clutching at Draco’s hair, trying not to fuck into Draco’s face. “More, love,” he chokes out. “Draco, love. Come on, more!”
“Did you digest a guidebook?” Harry asked, slightly repulsed.
Harry worked to keep the smirk off of his own face; as precious as it was to see Draco blush after admitting his fantasies, he did actually want to live long enough to enact them. He settled for saying, quite honestly, “Couldn’t think of anything I’d like more.”
“It’s perfectly alright,” Draco tried to assure her, words coming out slightly garbled as he was squeezed even more tightly.
That was less than two months away. Draco could feel his heart sinking at the thought of being married off to any of the women he’d taken on dinner dates.
Predicting that Harry would want to graduate with full NEWTs, the American DMLE offered to fund private tutoring and coursework at Ilvermorny so that he could prepare for the tests and take them at the end of the semester. When Harry wasn’t studying, he would be training with the top class of newly admitted Auror recruits.
“Well,” Draco managed, despite Potter mouthing him through the thin material of his pants, “Don’t get used to it. These are by far the most acceptable clothes I’ve ever seen you wear.” Potter’s rumbling laugh somehow only turned him on more.

“Oh, Jake,” he said, grabbing Jake’s left arm as he continued trying to escape. Jake pulled back desperately, causing Draco to utter “no, no–Jake, no” as he fought to keep the other man from leaving. Draco won, drawing Jake back into his chest for a hug as tears silently ran down Jake’s face.
With that, Potter gently slid his shirt up, teasing over his nipples until Draco lightly moaned. He flicked the tip with his tongue until Draco threaded his fingers through Potter’s hair and gently nudged him downwards. Potter took the hint, lapping slightly at Draco’s flat stomach, running his fingers underneath the elastic of Draco’s waistband.

It was excitedly echoed back, and even made the group walk a little faster. Maggie shot him a proud smile, and Draco at least felt happy that
When he woke up the next morning in Jake’s bed, he had absolutely no recollection of what he’d been doing there. Draco whipped back the covers and saw with relief that he still had his jeans on, because if he hadn’t,
“Why’re you in such a good mood, then?” Ron injects, signaling for the waiter. “Did your paycheck come in?”
He regretfully stops eyeballing the tart and finds Malfoy’s silverware drawer on the first try. “Right. Why exactly do we need silverware for pizza?”
into our family.”
Narcissa held tightly onto Draco’s still-outstretched hand. “Yes, yes I am. I gave so much of myself to that man; my youth, my family, my values.”
By the time he was finished with Draco’s present, the better part of the day was over, and Harry’s fingers were cramping. There was definitely going to be muscle pain there tomorrow. But no matter. It might not be the prettiest thing ever, but dammit, Harry’s love and affection was on display through his efforts. Hopefully. And if Draco didn’t appreciate it, well, at least he’d tried.
“If you nag him, he’s going to move even slower,” Steve said, shrugging, as Harry made towards the closed bathroom door. “Trust me. I know from experience.”
“Would have defeated the purpose,” said Charlie simply. “Anyway, Malfoy. I'm glad you're putting all those old prejudices behind you."
“I’m sure Hermione’s capable of taking care of herself.” Harry tossed down some Muggle money and strode away, his exit only ruined by the way the shifting sand beneath his feet.
Thankfully, she lost the opportunity to finish that sentence as Slughorn came by and started reprimanding a pair of former Hufflepuffs directly in front of them.
“It’s been months,” Harry said. “I can’t stop thinking about Malfoy.” He knew that he was entering dangerous territory, but if Ron really wanted to prove he was Harry's best mate again, he wouldn’t fight him on this. “Do you miss her all the time, or do you just remember things every so often, when there’s a certain song or food or something?”
Draco walked over to Hermione and wrapped his arms around her, laying his head comfortingly on her shoulder. “Anyone who opposed Voldemort was wiped out,” he said soothingly, only stumbling briefly on the name. “Medical Potionry was hit particularly hard, because he wanted Potioneers to brew a solution to be distributed amongst Muggles, that prevented any magical capability from being passed down to their children. Most wouldn’t condone it, so he disposed of them. There hasn’t been enough time yet to replace those scholars.”
He made it into the kitchen and scarfed down half a bowl of soup before he noticed the owl waiting patiently on the counter for him. Curious, Harry approached it. Surely it wasn’t some kind of assassination attempt, considering that the owl was unharmed after passing through his wards? Only the owls of his closest friends knew how to do so safely.
It was paining him to think about it. He could still feel Seamus’s rough pants grinding against him and then his fervor when he came, holding Harry in place. “He came and then he went,” answers Harry truthfully. Stress is building now, because after that moment with Seamus, only a short while later he found himself trapped in the bathroom with Asten.
“Throwing mudcakes, Malfoy?” he crows gleefully, Vanishing the lot with his wand while Draco extracts himself from the creek, muttering darkly under his breath all the while. “Do you want me to clean you up?”
“Shall we read on?” asked Draco, getting comfortable on the sofa.
come to him immediately and apologize profusely. He remembers exactly how thoroughly Draco must have reamed them, and kindly reminds them of the rules and lets them off with a warning. Ron shows up about one and lopes around meaninglessly, waiting for the show to begin.
“Of course,” reassured ‘Dromeda. “But this happened not 10 feet away from us. I was too shaken up; really just wanted to have some tea. Cissy and Teddy are at Fortescue's.”
“Glad to see you’re making friends, mate, but we must be off. Still a long night ahead of us!”
“I don’t know, are you ready to apologize for being an intolerable, insufferable
“Come upstairs,” urged Jake when they surfaced again. Draco allowed himself to be led out of the street and up the iron stairs that led to Jake’s apartment.
Granger and the Weasel noticed him then for the first time. “What’s he doing here, Harry?” said the Weasel.
He woke up the next morning much earlier than usual, Draco’s owl softly hooting from where it had snuck onto his windowsill sometime during the night.
By some strange miracle, they made it on time to Hogwarts the next morning, though both were running dangerously low on sleep. Harry suggested skiving off their afternoon Transfiguration, but Draco shot him down immediately, insisting that they couldn’t, in good faith, skip another class in the same week.
were far more varied. He’d tried a set schedule like his friends, but soon realized that the member base would only show up on the days he was there.
Draco snorted. If only he’d known what his mother’s beliefs were before the age of 18. Maybe then he wouldn’t have been in this great mess with a not removable faded black mark.
Nate grabbed his mitt and went off on his merry way towards right field where the rest of the team was lolling around. He turned again, though, as the two middle infielders were putting on their cleats, and said, “Next time you come late to a game, I’m trading you in for two of the Void A-Roids – at least they can show up on time.”
how America was supposed to look. Unsure what to do, Draco continued to walk until he reached a smaller lane with little rectangles that resembled the street. He stood there running his hand through his hair until a red wheeled box, a vehicle –a
“I don’t think so,” Hermione sympathized, tying her hair back. “Slughorn did mention that the elixir hadn’t received a lot of critical attention, so hopefully there won’t be much to dig through.”
“Harry,” Draco said against Harry’s mouth. “
“Potter,” said Draco, “How about we plan a special night for this weekend—”
“More!” he cried, pushing back on Draco’s finger.
He spins around, taking in the ever-so-slightly ruffled Draco Malfoy in a pair of blue jeans and a simple t shirt. As if that isn’t strange enough, he’s also wearing a light green apron and holding a spatula. He didn’t even know Malfoy was capable of cooking, let alone getting sweaty from the hard work entailed to make food the muggle way.
“Harry,” pants Draco after a few minutes, “Can you take over?”
“Doesn’t sound terrible to me either,” said Draco casually. “But no, I guess I wouldn’t mind taking a run with you, Potter. We’re going to be spending enough time together this summer anyway.”
“But I’ve got the biggest target on my back because they’re going to link me with Knight. Your identities are still safe.”
want to go.”
“Are you tired?” Draco whispered.
They’re kissing again and Draco takes a split second to imagine what’s to come. The hard ground will present a bit of a problem, and as Potter’s squishy lips nibble his ear, Draco knows he has to pursue maximum comfort.
In the end, Potter ended up conjuring a tarp and magically rigging it to the backstop. Draco drew the strike zone in a big rectangle and vowed to stay off the inside corner.
As Harry got ready to turn on the spot and disappear, the front door burst open yet again and George dashed out, panting.
“Not at all,” said Cale. “I fell, but it wasn’t for New York City!”
He gave the ingredients a quick once over and noticed though he’d have six to prepare, she’d taken one of the more tedious tasks—preparing the beetle’s eyes. In all, it was a completely fair trade-off.
“Why were you late, anyway?” Hermione asked suspiciously, staring at him with beady eyes.
Confused, Harry watched her dash out of the classroom as Draco started packing up his materials.
“I’m not in touch with them any longer,” Draco said, trying to keep his pride intact.
“What would be worth missing out on a good night’s sleep?” asks Draco doubtfully.
“What?”
cheesy, but couldn’t help a small smile from breaking out over his face.
“As for Mr. Weasley,” said McGonagall, “Well, I suppose that after witnessing seven years of friendship between you two, I rather expected that you would have worked out your problems by now. I do wish you a good evening, Mr. Potter.” She continued on her way.
“Draco,” Harry said, stroking Draco’s cheek.
“Like that?” whispers Potter.
“I don’t believe me either,” Draco admitted.
Draco always said that if Father wanted status and prestige,
Hermione reached for the new bottle of Lysol and broke open the seal. “Okay,” she said simply. There was nothing else for it.
Draco had tried his best to retain his typically cool and collected appearance by continuing to wear impeccable button down shirts and black trousers, but warm Southern California soon got the best of him. It was a good thing he had an interest in muggle fashion. Finally, one Saturday morning he booted up his laptop and started searching online clothing dealers. The sheer amount of information overwhelmed him almost immediately. Draco literally didn’t know what a “credit card” was; he thought that muggles just used cash to buy what they needed. This was going to be a nightmare, he admitted to himself. Maybe the muggle clerks weren’t so bad after all.
“Oh, and you have some as well!” Luna chirped on her way back, settling into her squashy armchair. “How do you like it, Draco?”
“Analysis is analysis,” answered Marram. “You’ll use the same skills. But rhetorical analysis has a different focus than literary analysis. I think you’d adjust well, based on the samples I saw.”
“No goodbye hug, Harry?” mocks Draco gently, also standing up.
Draco didn’t have time to respond before a enormous piece of mouthwatering chocolate cake deposited itself on a plate and soared across the room towards him. Mrs. Weasley handed him a fork, smiling once more. “I wonder at the state of those Hogwarts house elves,” she frowned. “You and Harry both are entirely too thin.”
“Not at all,” Harry gloats. “In fact, I think I’ve found it. Besides, it was because of my situation that Draco lost his job.”
When there was just fifteen minutes left to spare before the start of their shift, it was time to leave. They were both dreading the next four to five hours of work they had before them. Rather than doing action-oriented missions that kept them busy around the clock, third-class Junior Aurors pushed paperwork for the higher-ranking officers that were out in the field. Harry found it to be a rather thankless and also very stationary job. He was counting the days until promotion to second-class, where at least he and Ron would be able to assist on most missions, albeit under constant scrutiny and supervision.
In spite of herself, Hermione couldn’t help smiling. “That sounds
There was nothing else to do, so Harry spends the early afternoon cleaning his flat. He’d gotten his own place after finally becoming fed up with Mrs. Black’s racist haranguing, leaving Kreacher behind at Grimmauld Place. Harry tries to check in on him biweekly, but sometimes he trips up and only comes monthly. Still, Kreacher doesn’t seem to mind.
Draco lay back on the couch and crossed his arms behind his head. Even though things were changing, change could be good. And there would be other sets of moments, both big and small, that made life worth living. He fell asleep to that comforting thought and slept soundly through the night until he was awoken late the next morning by Hermione’s excited shrieks.
Harry pulled away from Draco and stroked his cheek. “That’s the first time you’ve used my given name, I think.”
“You look fine, Potter,” Draco said briskly. “Come on.” He led the way out of his bedroom, down another adjoining corridor—Harry was thoroughly lost now—and through a secret passage. They ended up in a wet catacomb-like area, and Draco was openly running again, Harry hot on his tail.
Next to him, Draco winced, and his hands--which Harry couldn’t seem to stop staring at--slightly trembled. They’d discussed this question, but there was nothing like being confronted with memories of their unfortunate past.
“Are you quite sure?” demanded Bellatrix. “Check again!”
Draco kissed him, tears streaming down both of their faces. There was no other response, no expression of words that could properly describe the incredible love and gratitude he felt for this man. After all these years, Harry was still reminded of what Draco had almost done, had kept it with him as they went through their lives together. Draco wondered how many fights he’d intentionally conceded in an attempt to keep him feeling secure.
“Why are you giving it to me?” Hermione asked, turning the bottle over to admire the way the potion shone.
“You’re not over this,” Malfoy warns. “Really, Potter. You have to process. You’re probably going to want to talk about it.”
Otarres laughed. “I’m glad you think so! Sometimes I just about get swallowed by all this mess in here. But I love it too, because I get to read children’s picture books for a living and flesh out the implications within them. It absolutely makes my next door neighbor Professor Bales crazy. He doesn’t think Children’s Literature is important enough to warrant study.”
house, but a
“He was being an arse,” Draco grimaced. “Here.” He thrust a pile of neatly organized parchment at her. “You can read the letters. I made copies.”
“Yes,” Draco managed.
“British blend,” Draco clarified. Harry figured there had to be a whole stash of black tea in the cupboard, knowing Draco. “And don’t you dare put it in the other Gryffindor mug!” He turned around and swept out of the room, graceful as ever in his retreat.
Draco sighed. “It’s both,” he admitted. “I dislike that Harry had a dalliance and it hurts that he did it at all, no matter whom it was with. Secondly, I don’t know how we can be
“Oh, you’ll see.” Harry reached forward and freed the bottom of Draco’s shirt, tugging it over his head. He wrapped his arms around Draco before gently pushing him back down to the bed. Draco was already half-hard, but his control wavered as Harry licked his sensitive nipples.
“That’s why I’m here, actually,” Harry said, picking up a wide, flat stone and skipping it across the surface of the water. “To apologize.”
The door was immediately yanked open by some grubby looking guy in a frat tank top and boxers. “I swear, if you’re here to try and sell me another magazine subscription, so help me– ”
“No, I mean it, Draco,” said Potter. “I want to be here with you.” Draco couldn’t help but believe him; the sincerity was shining out of his eyes. And he had a bit of a weakness for Potter's eyes.
, after he had a nice, refreshing shower. He firmly put all thoughts of bread and rectangular shapes out of his mind and split out of his room for his private bathroom.
Offhandedly, he asks, “How much do I pay you and Hermione per hour to teach at the Club?”
“I thought you might have a conversation about it with her,” Harry said, smiling. “Hermione loves knitting, so it makes sense she would like crocheting too.”
“No, but I didn’t brush my teeth yet today.”
“I know,” said Draco. He was going to say something else, but forgot what it was when ‘Dromeda asked, “Any luck with that little firm Cissy said you’d started?”
“I am,” Harry declares. “I’ve wanted to be with Draco for the longest time, but even if I hadn’t, I’d still say yes to dating him. I’m ready for this. As a bonus he understands what I’m going through.”
Properly chastised, Harry glared at Malfoy and went back to staring at their surroundings. There really wasn’t much here to see. He looked back at Malfoy, who had rolled up his sleeves to just underneath his elbow and was staring intently past the stalactites and stalagmites to the cave wall directly across from them. Harry tried to follow his lead, but got impatient with staring at nothing for five minutes straight. “Malfoy, I really think that—”
true, after all.”
“Sign me up as well,” said Harry, lightly elbowing him.
, Ron. He makes stuffies.”
“To the best of my ability,” she sighed.
. It was the most intimate thing in the world, Draco thought, letting someone else into the most private part he possessed; a part that he could certainly stimulate on his own but that a partner could reach so much better. No matter which way he laid or how he maneuvered his arms, there never seemed to be a comfortable way to finger his arse. So as usual, Draco resorted to Transfiguring a toothbrush – specifically kept for such a purpose – into a small sized dildo.
It was a minute before Potter pulled away. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that,” he told Draco.
“Sitting. Obviously,” he said, rolling his eyes.
He pretended not to hear his date when she asked if he wanted to share a low-cal vanilla ice cream for dessert, dabbing gently at his mouth with his cloth napkin while simultaneously composing a short piano melody in his head.
“Sorry, brahs,” shrugged Steve, stepping back and gesturing with his hand for them to come inside. It was neat and clean, if not a little mismatched. Harry supposed the décor had been selected by Steve. “They’ve been relentlessly targeting us all week.”
He didn’t have time to ponder it, though; as Draco came, he clenched around Harry’s cock, and that set him off. Everything went dark as the climax flooded his body; he was only conscious of Draco squeezing him tighter, both with his arms and his arse, as he went over the edge. His vision took a few seconds to clear afterward, but when Harry opened his eyes, Draco was there, smiling.
Choosing to be honest--at least partially--Draco said, “Enjoyable.”
The weeks after Harry and the Weasel left were surprisingly busy for Draco. He and Hermione were desperately trying to make the revise and resubmit deadline for
“Classic Harry Potter,” Malfoy says, shaking his head. “You go through an ordeal and all you want to do is help others, some of which might not actually deserve it.”
“I trust you, mate,” discloses Ron, “but sometimes it’s best to quit while you’re ahead. Who knows what’s going to happen tomorrow night?”
“You’d be surprised, Draco,” comes Harry’s response through a mouthful of fried rice, “With the many things you don’t know about me.”
"Nice to meet you," Harry said, shaking her hand.
“It does,” Draco admitted as he stood up. Before he could talk himself out of it, he added, “You’re good with your hands.”
“With some coaching, I think he could be really good,” Harry continued defensively, shrugging his shoulders.
Draco laughs, pulling away enough to look Harry in the eye. “I can see you’re ready for dessert, then. Let’s go back.”

job. He needed education, and after considering how much time he spent on the NEWTs, it seemed unfair to simply whip up the proper documentation. Draco wasn’t sure he could fake 4 years of muggle higher education. After further thought, he decided that with his fantastic NEWT scores, it was appropriate for him to enter University with 2 years of coursework done. He’d manifest the paperwork from, what was it she said, a
“Seriously, Potter, pray tell.”
“I would,” Ron said. “I’ve regretted a lot of things, but nothing more than leaving you. My life just hasn’t been the same without you.”
“You would need to mix the yolk from a silver goose’s egg with the mothwing dust, stirring counter-clockwise approximately seven times, before adding it to the other ingredients.”
. Merlin knew Father wasn’t going to leave him alone enough at home to do any sort of processing.
“We still have to cite it,” Hermione reminded him. “And we have to credit Jamison for his technique of quartering the beetle’s eyes-–”
Harry detached himself from Ron in silent fury. He dusted himself off before making for the bathroom and slamming the door behind him. Without hesitation, he stepped into the shower and turned on the water full-blast. It calmed him, cooled him, and after a good five minutes of freezing under the spray, he’d recovered enough of his sensibilities to wash properly. He wore only his towel out to their shared room, where Ron gave him nasty looks as he changed. Harry side-checked him on the way out the door.
“Lumos,” Draco said, illuminating a soft light. He was right—there were tripping hazards everywhere, most notably from the great stack of parchment and manuals strewn all over the floor. It looked like they’d stayed up late attending to those, which made sense. Last he’d heard, there was a rather important test coming up for the Junior Aurors looking to advance.
“Malfoy, it's time things changed. We all need to put this behind us. I told Ron and Hermione too, and they're not happy about it, but I think they're going to try." Potter stopped for a breath, observing how the shower spray was moistening his clothes by the second. Draco wrenched the bath mat off of the floor and held it in front of his privates.
“Potter, you work too much.”
After burning through another couple bottles, the group slowly disbanded. Draco had started slowing down after his blushing incident, but was still having trouble standing upright. Jake came over and clapped him on the back, smirking. “You’re a good sport, man.”
Despite himself, Harry grinned. “You’ve just narrowed down your dating pool even more, you know. You could have asked the old hag to the company picnic and had a nice celebration with her.”
Malfoy looked at Harry, glowing from their successful performance, and Harry could see his pride and elation shining through.
There was another long silence. Draco stumbled back over to the sofa to snatch the granny square afghan he’d made for their dream house and throw it over him and Hermione.
He tried to write. He really did. But the words wouldn’t come, no matter how hard Draco willed them to flow onto the parchment.
They seemed to have been invited into the house, and the flavorful aromas were making Draco salivate; they hadn’t eaten their normal breakfast that morning in anticipation of a good old fashioned Weasley meal. Harry warned him that, if things went well (which neither of them anticipated but still hoped for anyway), Molly would be heaping seconds and thirds onto both of their plates.
“Harry, really. What’s going on? I know you haven’t been excited about the Aurors for a while, but I thought it was getting better. Especially with your first case today.”
“Eh, we’ll stretch when the rest of them get out here,” Harry said. “Stop looking at Nate and be ready to catch the damn ball.”
Inwardly nodding with approval, Harry gazed up the man’s well-defined torso until he finally reached the man’s face, which was slightly pointed and framed by gossamer white-blonde hair – dear God, this could not be happening to him. Draco Malfoy could simply not be standing in front of him a year after the War, in fucking
They sat there together, passing the drink back and forth until the glass was empty. Their peaceful silence – apart from the loud waltz shaking the room’s very foundations – was interrupted when a journalist came over and asked Harry for a dance. Without making an excuse, he flat out refused, but she was not deterred. After watching another few minutes of her feeble attempts to seduce Harry, Draco jumped from his seat, nudged the indignant journalist out of the way, and proffered his hand to Harry in clear invitation to dance.
Harry smiled. “I’m glad,” he grinned, leaning forward to kiss Draco. “But I haven’t gotten to please you yet tonight.”
explicitly heard about the Future Promise Legislation, but then again Kingsley had tried to get him to endorse something, conveniently failing to provide the finer details…
Taking a deep breath, Draco decided it was time. He wedged his finger underneath the corner of the envelope, beyond caring about proper mail etiquette. Unfolding the letter carefully, he skimmed the first line of the envelope, heart catching in his throat:
“I’ll have what he’s having,” Draco says finally, closing his menu.
“Oh yeah? What’s the other part?”
It was morbid and grotesque, but he leaned back down and inhaled again. After a month and a half of nothing feeling right, this one flower made Draco feel as though he’d come home.
“Potter, let’s recognize our experiences individually instead of comparing them. My rape isn’t automatically more traumatic than yours just because it was taken farther.”
Harry sighed. “Draco, come on. Just tell me what you really think, would you?”
Malfoy assumed a face of perfect innocence. “Really, Potter? Just because I happened to be a few minutes late this morning?”
“Potter, shut up!”
“Of course you have,” said Potter, quickly looking around to see that no one was watching before Vanishing their dishes. “One that declares you’re going on a trip with me. But you’re eventually going to pick somewhere even if I have to resort to desperate measures to worm it out of you.”

“For everything."
He followed instructions, holding eye contact all the while. It got easier as they went. She breathed with him, over-exaggerated the noises of inhaling and exhaling.

“I regularly have your tongue in my mouth anyway, so I should be used to this,” Malfoy groaned.

He Disapparated from the Manor, aiming for the school’s outer gates. Unfortunately, several of the other volunteers had the same idea. Draco slammed into a couple Hufflepuffs he used to love to torment, Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott.
“No,” answered Harry indignantly.
George blew a loud raspberry. “Sorry,” he said, without a trace of remorse. “Just was providing the comic relief as always.”
“Definitely,” said Potter.
“With Hermione, there’s always a point,” Harry said. He continued to work at the lock with smooth, well-practiced motions. “Got it,” he said happily as the lock clicked. “But seriously, ‘Mione, what’s the point of being in the Mafia if we’re always on the straight and narrow?”
Harry held his hands out in surrender, and then reached out to gently take Hermione’s arm. “Me and Ron both have a lot to answer for, we get it,” he said quietly. “But we’re here to try and make things right. Both of us. But before we do that, you need some food.”

ever since things had calmed back down into the banality of everyday life.
“If you’re alright staying out by the lake,” Hermione answered. “I know how fond you always were of the Giant Squid.”
“I got you a cup of coffee to go with the tart,” Ron said.
“Yes?” Malfoy’s posh voice rang out in the room, even with echoing through the fireplace. Even while speaking just one syllable, the git had perfect enunciation.
“Oh, Harry,” whispers Hermione. “How are you even functioning right now?” Ron says nothing. Harry doesn’t think he can.

“Cause it almost looks like you wanted to be in the middle with Seamus,” Ron admits blushingly.

“Look, Malfoy. We’re going to get food and then I have to find somewhere to live. If I can get all that done, then I’ll meet up with you this afternoon, alright?”
“I wasn’t going to make a big deal out of it at all, seeing how versatile you are and how well you’ve connected with the team, well,
The couch was cozy, but she was right. Draco slid to his feet, Summoning his robe and slippers as he strode into the kitchen and took up the spatula, determined to not let the eggs become even slightly tough, let alone brown. They worked together well, Hermione seamlessly navigating around Draco as he finished the eggs, plated them, and then began preparing a small fruit salad of berries, grapes, and watermelon.
Potter nodded. “And I suppose you’ve got something in mind?”
, Malfoy. I reckon you’d have to go into the Muggle world to buy them, using Muggle money of course, but, no, not that difficult really.”
“No!” Hermione cried, lowering Harry’s hand. “We don’t do magic here.” It was a curious thing, the way the flat interacted with their magical cores. Hermione and Draco had quickly learned that, if they didn’t want their house interfering with their physical, mental, and magical wellbeing, it was in their best interest to do things by hand and save the magic for when they were out. Between the two of them, Hermione and Draco hadn’t yet unpuzzled the mystery of why the house could tap into their cores, but since it wasn’t a malicious touch and because they were occupied with other things, they decided to drop the matter for the time being. Besides, it wasn’t exactly unheard of, houses tapping into magical cores, at least not from what Hermione had read in her Magical Theory class.
The stars were especially bright tonight, but that detail carried no special significance for Draco. He supposed that Firenze could have told him the significance, but the Forest was almost in another universe entirely, and he possessed zero inclination to return to the Hogwarts grounds. With the thoughts of his peaceful days at school and the comforting clicking and chirping of insects as a peaceful backdrop, Draco could finally drift. He didn’t sleep—he had no desire to do so out in the middle of the plains—but he tapped into the limbo between sleeping and waking, drifting along as his subconscious mind dictated. Images came to him, sometimes swiftly, sometimes leisurely, but they always left him with strong feelings, sometimes nostalgia, sometimes regret. Visions came, too. In them, he went from seeing his childhood and his time at school to watching himself love Harry to feeling his visceral desire to make something of himself. Further pictures featured Draco’s successes, his career. His untarnished family name. Friendships that defied the test of loss, of time, of tragedy. At times he sometimes felt like all nuance had left his being. This was not one of those times.
Finally, he drew away from Draco’s rim. “I think you’re ready for another finger,” he said softly.
Narrowing his eyes, Ron grumbles, “So you mean Malfoy’s going to be actually working at the Club with us? And you’re paying him as much as you pay me and Hermione? Harry, I hate to say this, but I think you’ve lost your mind.”
“Really?” Draco whispered. In his wildest dreams, he wouldn’t have expected Potter to return his affections. He’d tried to bury them after the trial, convinced Potter would want nothing to do with someone like him.
“Can you be more specific?” asked Harry. “I want to make sure we’re both on the same page.”
Harry smiled good-naturedly while Mike broke out in fresh chuckles. The team had had a field day (pun intended) last Friday teaching him sliding techniques on an adult version of the popular child’s toy. They swore by it, though there was one memorable moment when he careened out of control and smashed into a particularly ugly lawn gnome. Harry hadn’t questioned their methods as it had been useful in helping him refine his base running skills.
Ron caught up to him a minute later, shoving Harry in the shoulder to stop him from walking any further. “What is it about Malfoy, anyway? You’ve always been obsessed with him, right from the beginning.”
“Hmph,” said Shrader, raising a suspicious eyebrow. “And what about Form 0899B? Has that blockheaded Senior Chief come down from the Department yet to retrieve it? That goddamn thing was due a week ago, and he still couldn’t be bothered to come down here and get it…”
For years, Harry’s life had centered on eradicating the world of evil, of ending Voldemort’s reign. Catching dark witches and wizards was the only thing he’d really ever known. Somehow, though, he was having doubts about whether or not he really wanted to be an Auror. Now that Voldemort was defeated, he thought that there would be less of a need for them. The Ministry, however, disagreed. Harry had received memos throughout the summer about how they feared the former Death Eaters would band together and create a new Dark Lord, now that there was a vacancy. Personally, Harry thought they were over-reacting a bit. He supposed that, like him, fighting evil was all they’d ever known and they wanted to keep everything under control as to never be confronted again with a situation like Voldemort.
“Actually, Potter, it’s really not. Once you pay attention to the way language operates, it’s pretty easy to see how power and privilege are reinscribed through microaggressions.”
Sensing that this is where things get ugly, Hermione reaches across the table and grabs Harry’s hand. “We’re here for you, she whispers.” Ron agrees.
What was BG? Draco decided to play along, “Yeah man, my mates are, well, they’re something else.”
Draco wasn’t planning on making any farewells (he’d thought about leaving a note for Mother, but had ultimately decided against it) except to himself. He had some time now, so maybe it was worth it to see if he could come to any sort of closure about his – he didn’t like to think the word –
you say to Malfoy?” interrupted Harry.
“Draco, you might not be trying to, but you’re taking away my choice just as much as they did.”
Harry sighed. “And I hate commuting.” He did, too. The bus was slow and inefficient, what with all the different stops it made, and driving frustrated him to no end. Stop lights and traffic could put him in a foul mood on any given day.
He could feel himself getting closer from Potter’s ministrations, but the telling clench of his arse around the fingers had Potter cease the stimulations and look up with a shit-eating grin.
After three painstaking revisions to his application, Draco had carefully submitted the paperwork, praying the committee would take him seriously. Unfortunately, as a former Death Eater, he was hardly the most desirable candidate. Honestly – he grudgingly admitted to himself, running his finger over the seal on the envelope – he was lucky to have been admitted to the program at all. Getting the opportunity to teach would just be the cherry on top of an already-successful academic career.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“Humor me,” said Harry. “Start with the top reason, then, if you can’t name them all.”
“When you’re able to cruise down the baseline without a problem,” said Malfoy breezily. “You’ll thank us.” He paused for a moment, studying the tired girls. “What do you say, Potter? Should we let them go home?”
“Done and done.” Draco closed his eyes too, reveling in her warmth, in her humanness. He hadn’t had nightmares when Harry was with him, but in his absence they’d returned. Hopefully Hermione’s presence would be enough to chase them away.
“Excuse me?”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, gently running his fingers down Draco’s cheek and over his chin. “I don’t care that you were a Death Eater.”
He continued Transfiguring some weird toys (Potter called them “Lincoln Logs”) into desks, taking special care to curve the lumbar support specifically to the curvature of his back. Some comfort would sure be nice for a change; Draco took particular pleasure in vanishing the remains of the horrible stools in the Potions classroom that Snape refused to let anyone touch.
“I did mention karaoke, didn’t I?”
It had been up in the air whether they would start with the photoshoot or the interview. Luna had taken one look at Harry and declared that they’d all be more relaxed after a good cup of Gurdyroot infused tea. She was off fixing it now while members of her team kept a close eye; probably making sure they didn’t scarper, Harry thought regretfully. He wasn’t entirely sure he’d have been able to resist the temptation if not for fear of what Draco would do when he finally caught him.
Panting, Draco realized that the real Potter was infinitely better than the Potter in his fantasies.
There was a pregnant pause. Hermione seemed unable to speak, so Draco took over. “Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly. “My colleague and I are international vintners, and we are thinking of opening a new location nearby. We’re only able to feature a small selection of wines to start with so we need to choose flavor profiles that appeal to the local clientele. Would you be interested in sampling our product and giving us a recommendation on what would sell best?”
Practice ended with running and agility drills – Malfoy had refused to budge on agility, and Harry was equally unwilling to budge on running, so the team got stuck doing both sets of exercises.
A quick snap of his fingers and Harry finds himself tied and gagged on the ground. He tries slowing his frenzied breathing, but his attempt fails after Asten roughly kicks him in the side. There is no way to make it through this unscathed. Harry relegates himself to his unfortunate fate, finally letting the tears building for the last fifteen minutes fall. He curls up in a ball, waiting for the next blow to rain down on him.
“Ooh,” drools Harry, snatching one up. “Try it. It has to have the peanut sauce, though. He dunks it in the nutty brown sauce and takes a ginormous bite, eyes rolling back in his head because of how good it is.
As it was, they weren’t doing so well. It was a trek to get there, and, even with stopping every five minutes for a water break, the campers were complaining about being hot and tired. Sweat poured down Draco’s back and neck, soaking his shirt. He’d taken a morning shower, but he’d never have known because of the way his skin already stuck together at the creases. Everything was sticky. Malfoys didn’t sweat, and they
“Move in with me,” Draco said suddenly. “No, fuck Hogwarts,” he said as Hermione opened her mouth to protest. “I’ll lose my mind if I have to stay alone in this empty flat any longer. I can’t just have “empty flat” and “hostile school” for residency.”
“See you tomorrow, Potter, at the usual o’800 hours," he said as he left the room, slipping back into using military time, which was both expected and required when in the employ of the Dark Lord. He did not look back at Potter, who was surely standing there with a bewildered look on his face. There were no words said to indicate otherwise, but at least to Draco, it felt like something had split between them.
The next pitch was right down the middle. Potter was on it in an instance, belting it right back at Draco, who immediately flattened himself down to the ground in a frantic attempt to not take a baseball to the face.
They continued on in this vein for a while, Harry trying to ignore the growing urge to come, because if he whined while Draco was in this frame of mind, he was sure to only prolong the experience.
Draco looked down in shame, again feeling the crushing weight of the Future Promise legislation. He asked, “But how can I bring myself to go out there? Have you kept up with the news? Pansy Parkinson was arrested for disputing the price of a cup of coffee in Diagon Alley the other day.”
“Malfoy,” said Potter. He sounded muffled from outside the shower. “I know you’re not, and we need to talk."
And so, without even changing into his pajamas, Draco snuggled up against Harry and closed his eyes. With a fond sigh, Harry Banished Draco’s clothes, save for his pants, to their proper hangers--the last time he’d tried it, the clothes ended up in a ball on the floor and Draco had a fit--and held him close, finally ready to slip into the abyss.
Harry bristled, and then let it go. Things between he and Malfoy were never going to be easy. “You write. Okay, perfect. Nate said I was supposed to help you in fundraising, though I imagine you and your
There was a silent moment when Harry and George seemed to have a silent conversation through eye contact. If Draco didn’t know about Harry’s abysmal Legilimency skills, he’d have suspected that they were communicating by mind. After some time, George nodded and clapped Harry on the shoulder again, as if he’d understood something meaningful.
“Better than before,” Harry answers honestly, swinging up his own feet and pinning them in next to Ron. Fortunately, he has the better hand by being wedged into the back of the couch: Ron is in the precarious danger of falling off of while he can just lay back and relax.
Harry’s resulting laugh almost woke up the entire camp.
“Damn straight,” said Nate, clapping Cale hard on the back. Harry could see him wince. “Let’s go over to the bleachers for this, though. I have some exciting handouts for you all…”
“That sucks,” said Draco, mimicking his roommate’s dialogue as he usually did in order to keep his sanity. Steve liked to imitate him as well, and had much less skill adopting accents than Draco did. “Hey, weren’t you going to help me do some shopping?”
“Not to the best of my knowledge,” interjects Harry. “Me and him – we’ve cleared a few things up.”
“Can you make it home alright, or do you want me to Apparate with you?”
Bright and early the next morning, Draco’s eyes snapped open: it was time. He jumped out of bed and strode into the bathroom to freshen up the best he could without water. Even
“I love you,” Harry said, leaning in to kiss Draco again. “I hate interviews, but I know we’re doing this one for the right reasons.”
Draco dug deep into his Malfoy reserves and put on his most facetious frown. “There’s no way you could have deduced all of that, Granger, even as smart as you are,” he said dismissively.
“And was probably fucking, too!” Bellatrix cackled. Lucius made to silence her until Narcissa gave him a look.
“I prefer bottoming anyway,” Draco smiles, nuzzling Harry’s jaw. “I love you, Potter.”
“Tipsy was always the best cook in the house,” Draco said mildly, perching on the arm of Potter’s chair. “She always made me my favorite dinner whenever Father was, er, working late.”
“Sit down and shaddup.” Becky Lou came closer with a tube of what looked like black lipstick. She had two dark black lines already drawn on her face, about on her cheekbones, and Harry was slightly relieved. It was over quickly.
“Can you do that again?” Draco asked suddenly, interrupting the slow rhythm Harry’d set.
“Potter!” Draco shouted, jumping into the kitchen and startling Harry as he noisily slurped up a spoonful of stew from the pot merrily bubbling away on the stove, “I know for a fact you haven’t touched those questions, so don’t think you’re getting anything to eat until you’ve prepared something!”
“Read it to me!” Harry called back. “It’ll sound good in your posh accent.”
Draco was stung by the law, but he wasn’t ready to dedicate his life to childcare anyway. Draco had been content with staying in the Manor for a while, comfortable in the mansion of Malfoy wealth and grandeur. Increasingly, he became tired of the drafty elegance of his surroundings: the Manor was no longer home, especially after all the evil that occurred there. Even more so than past events, Draco could not overlook the fact that the house felt like a prison. With the house elves cooking meals, doing laundry, tidying up, and otherwise running the household, Draco had no reason to leave. And even if he could find one, the harassment he’d occur out in the community was too detrimental for one to bear if not absolutely necessary. He tried to start a small consulting firm, but could find no one who would take his business.
Draco locked eyes with Harry, panting from the desire that was so clear upon his face. As they looked at each other, Harry saw his lust slowly fade away as Draco started to look fearful and worried. “What’s wrong?” he asked quietly. “Is this not what you wanted?”
“That’s the point, though,” Draco said reassuringly. “It’s a ‘
“What if I don’t want to go back to the way things were? What if I
“I did.”
“And yet you gave him a chance,” pointed out Betty Lou. “One you damn well won’t give to Draco.”
Draco relented. “Look, I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said. “For the meeting, alright?”
“Potter, I didn’t ask you where your damn address is. Now, come on. Put your clothes back on and tell me where Weasley lives.”
Harry allowed himself the privilege of watching Draco leave the room and then stood up, shaking his head. He remembered the exact Gryffindor mugs Draco was talking about. Ron had given him the set as a gift and was later devastated when Harry accidentally cracked one of them. “Mate, those set me back 30 Galleons!” He tried to fix it, but the spell had never been able to restore the mug back to its former glory and so Hermione determined that they should leave it alone as to preserve the mug’s character. As the years went on, the set had gotten shoved to the back of the cupboard in Grimmauld Place. Harry wondered just when they had been rescued, as well as how they’d gotten all the way to France…
Though neither wanted the moment to end, they shared another very heartfelt kiss before switching on their flashlights and following the dirt trails back to the living unit.
Finally, after another ten minutes, they ended up in a wine cellar. Draco fumbled around for the trapdoor—an actual
For a while, they just sat. The wind harshly blew, ruffling Potter’s hair back into its usual delectable mess, even managing to muss up Draco’s own carefully styled hair. Though he was freezing, he said nothing. Eventually, Potter sighed. “This thing with Ron and Hermione just has me on edge. I can’t believe they’re being like this after we went through a bloody

one that could keep up with Draco’s academic interests.
Malfoy studied Harry for a moment then leaned in and kissed him. Harry was conscious of the fact that he’d just rolled out of bed, and wasn’t eager to deepen the kiss. Malfoy demanded, “Are we going back to butterfly kisses now?”
“Then I might have to hex you,” Hermione retorted. “So write to him. Ask him to come out here—only after you give him the stipulations—and then we can
Had he really been dreaming about Potter? Draco had never had such an intense dream before, even when he was in Voldemort’s employ and nightmares were just his norm. In fact, Draco could almost still feel Potter’s touch on his body…
came out on New Years’ Eve, over a month after Harry and Draco did the interview and photoshoot. They’d initially spent the first week post-interview peppering Luna (and Hermione) with questions about when the issue would come out, but Luna would only say “soon” each time they asked and offer up a mystical sort of grin. Asking eventually lost its novelty until Harry forgot about the interview entirely. The post came--in fact it was the last delivery of the year--and it was Draco’s turn to pay the delivery owl. He always bitched and complained when that was the case, claiming that the (in Harry’s opinion) adorable screech owl “was a greedy little bastard who couldn’t be satisfied with just
“Please do,” Potter invited, his eyes smiling, but somehow, Draco restrained. “Right, then. I’m going to make it even cheesier by saying that I too just want to spend time with you, and that’s why I don’t really care where we go.” Draco
Potter crossed his arms and glared at Draco, tapping his foot. “Get to the point, Malfoy. Or haven’t you seen exactly how much tower we still have to rebuild?”
Maybe there was nothing

Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Malfoy laughed, a real laugh, and Harry’s heart quite strangely lifted at the sound. “Potter, it would be a blessing to leave my name behind. I’m sure you can work out why. Anyway, he wouldn’t do that now, not after his path royally screwed us all.”
“I knew you never used your brain at all over the last seven years,” muttered Draco, kicking the chalky dirt over home plate.
“Your best friend was tortured in my house.”
Hermione sat in her own kitchen and watched as her best friend prepared two ham sandwiches, cutting some of the fresh apples in the fruit bowl for a healthy side. “You never used to eat apples,” she remarked.
“You’ve heard the expression ‘save the best for last,’ haven’t you?”
When it was in, though, Draco’s eyes rolled unconsciously into the back of his head. The pressure and stimulation to his prostate was a dream when combined with the sensations on his cock, but the ultimate pleasure was yet to come.
“How are you so calm about this?”
“You made it through the bathroom affair, didn’t you?” shrugs Ron.
Draco accepted it with shaking hands. “You know,” he said weakly, “The last time I accepted correspondence, it really didn’t go that well.”
him?”
“Surely you’re not expecting me to wear this?” he asked, revolted, as he spoke for the first time.
“Thank Merlin,” sighed Potter. “Honestly, if I’d had to go through one more bloody meeting or conversation…”
As predicted, McGonagall fell silent, causing everyone to turn and look at those who had interrupted her. Their daringness soon evaporated, along with their sense of rudeness. Properly chastised by McGonagall’s burning glare, the three sheepishly faced forward again and listened to the information though it did not pertain to them.
Overcome with empathy, Draco rolled over on his side to meet Hermione’s eyes. “We’re pitiful, aren’t we?” he deadpanned.
Draco sighed. “I know you’re being serious, but that sounded so unbelievably cheesy I’m trying not to roll my eyes at you.”
“No, Potter!” cried Draco, the flush already returning to his pale cheeks. “I meant it when I said we were going to be late.”
Draco closed his eyes. “Isn’t it obvious, Potter?”
“What shouldn’t I tell you?” asked Hermione.
“Maybe not,” said Harry, enjoying himself immensely. Malfoy looked into Harry’s teacup before heaving a sigh and drinking the cooling liquid anyway.
“Hey, wait, no fair!” Ron cried, upsetting the kettle in his haste.
Draco nodded, lacing up Potter’s disgusting cleats a little tighter before gracefully jogging out on the field and reaching out to return Mike’s proffered high five.
“You won’t know unless you try,” Hermione said, straightening her spine. There was another moment of silence as they studied each other. “Would you even mean it?”
“Yes,” said Harry, exhaling. He sank down on the pebbly shore and stared out at the water.
“How are we supposed to help him if we don’t know what’s wrong?”
“How else was I supposed to get through to you?” Harry asked, a hint of desperation to his tone. I recognized that you were suicidal long before we met in the woods, but I knew there was really no other way to show you of what we’d both known for years unless you saw it with your own eyes.”
Draco’s suspicions had been confirmed, and he opened his mouth to say something, but then Merram went on, “You might even think about taking on a minor in Rhetoric. If you want to go into Professional Writing, learning to do rhetorical analysis would be really beneficial.”
As he was about to imitate a windup and chuck the ball into oblivion, José was standing in front of him, blocking his movements. Draco could see Zee pressed right up against the fence, waiting for him to fail. He bit back the bile that rose in his throat and focused on the team pitcher, hoping against hope that he had something useful to contribute.
it too. Into wheelbarrows. Which meant that it would eventually have to be dumped somewhere, and he supposed that was their responsibility too. Malfoys did not lower themselves so far as to deal with –by hand– the feces of another species. Especially one as repulsive as horses. Though forever cautious around hippogriffs, Draco had developed great appreciation for thestrals, having seen more than enough death to reveal their existence to him. But horses were skittish and uncultured, not to mention

“Great, so now that we’ve established that, can I have my rum back?”
“At least you didn’t have to sing,” Pansy groans. “I think “Black Socks” is permanently etched into my brain.” She takes the front seat, swinging her high-heeled feet up onto Blaise’s dash; determined to spend every last minute in her favorite shoes since she’s not allowed to wear them when campers are around.
To feel Draco’s mouth on his again was incredible, and indescribable. He briefly flashed back to that feeling of coming home, and recalibrated.
“See, I knew you’d have this reaction.”
It’s difficult to meet Malfoy’s eyes but he does it, because he can imagine just how vulnerable Malfoy must still feel.
hear the fireworks.”
“Of course not. But that doesn’t mean we can’t tease you plenty in the meantime.”
“Hermione had to get up early for an Unspeakable meeting, and because she had to be awake, she decided I had to be awake too,” says Ron, equally drowsy. “Then she told me I should go check on you because you haven’t quite been yourself lately.”
After readjusting to everyday life in France, Draco receives shocking news from Harry.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“Safety is my number one concern,” Beans said, face softening just the slightest bit. “Please make sure to keep a better eye on the campers.”
“That’s not even one each,” said Hermione, disappointed.
Draco saw red. Statute of Secrecy be damned, he was done with this conversation. In the back of his mind, he knew full well that the Ministry would have his ass, but that seemed a small price to pay.
“More or less,” Harry hedged.
“Hey, I haven’t even turned you down yet!” says Harry indignantly.
The flushed aficionado mutters a quick apology to Draco and scoots back into the group, almost camouflaging himself in the middle. Without so much as an untoward glance, Draco continues on with the lesson. He demonstrates efficient ways of moving one’s body, both reactions and response, in order to gain even more seconds on one’s opponent. From his knowledge of the Malfoy family, Harry expects Draco’s dueling style to be flowy and graceful, and though these motions are clipped, Draco dances with the ease Harry always imagined him having.
“I love you like this, Draco,” returns Harry, almost floating as Draco engulfs his cock again and squeezes tightly. They make love harmoniously slow for a few minutes, kissing each other and enjoying their bond, their new togetherness.
Malfoy laughed. “Like it was any easier for me to get up, Potter. I can’t even make it to Hogwarts by eight, and you think that you’re the one who had it rough being ready before six?”
“I’ll say! It would have gone much worse had I tried it on this rocky-ass field first,” Harry grinned, kicking some of the loose pebbles towards the green. Talking shit about the city’s sub-par baseball fields was collectively the team’s favorite pastime.
“That’s so sweet, Weasley,” coos Draco.
“We’re never going to get to be
“Can I eat now?” Harry asked. Wordlessly, Draco handed him a bowl full of piping hot stew and a clean spoon. He sat down at the kitchen table to eat, while Draco nipped back into their bedroom and came out with his own parchment.

“You’re forward,” Granger said, still grinning. “And cheeky. I think I can get along with this new Malfoy.”

to apply anywhere after the six months were up and he could return to Draco at that time. They’d only just about had their six-month anniversary and now they would be separated for the following six months. Either life was unfair or it came with the territory when dating the Saviour.
As they came out of their own little world, Draco remembered he was standing naked in his shower with a a bathmat covering his bits. Not totally oblivious himself, Potter seemed to realize that h'ed brashly climbed into someone's shower.
Draco was partially in a daze, the summer warmth and fresh air making him drowsy. He'd snagged Potter’s sweatshirt a few minutes earlier and was using it as a pillow. “Of course there are butterflies, Potter. But we can see them later; I want to take a nap.”
Harry obliged on both counts, thrusting slightly harder and increasing his pace. He also took the opportunity to mark the side of Draco’s neck with lovebites, nipping rapidly as Draco pleaded for him.
“Harry,” Draco begged. “Harder—more!” he sobbed.
Any comments Zee had about the situation were kept to himself.
, the heading read. A devastating pang went through his chest, but Harry caught him in a rough hug as he went to turn around.
There was nothing to do in Diagon Alley, or at least nothing Draco was interested in doing. The one experience he longed for required a partner, but he was also sure that no one would have him. It went against his moral compass (slight that it was) to pay for such a service. It wouldn’t be the same, somehow.

“No, of course not,” said Draco, wondering what Potter could possibly be talking about.
The covers were warm against Harry’s back when Draco toppled them down onto the bed, letting out a slight
“Master Draco! Master Draco!” she shouted, anxiety written all over her face. “You is going to be late to Hogwarts, sir!”
“This just keeps getting better and better,” Chris crowed. “They have ‘too much history,’ Cale.”
“He hopes he’ll choke on it too,” said Hermione without missing a beat, grinning wildly.
“Please,” Cecelia said, rolling her eyes. “I could recognize that platinum hair from a mile away. Lord knows the way the crochet group used to fawn over you when you were just a little boy.”
As Mike hustled back, he gestured for Draco to take second. A bit apprehensively, Draco gets into position, trying to look ready for the next play. Nate sends the next fly ball careening out deep into left field, so Zee takes off into the grass to cut off the throw while Draco hops onto the base and gets ready for the throw. Zee really isn’t that far away from him, so Draco prepares for a swift throw designed to beat the ghost runner to the base. Instead, Zee launches the ball directly at Draco’s head as if he’s aiming to knock it clear off. Unprepared for such a powerful throw, Draco ducks instead of trying to catch the ball. Fifteen feet behind him, the ball lands in Mike’s glove with a satisfying
“Like what you see, Potter?” Draco queried, trying not to grip Potter’s hand more tightly in anticipation.
Without missing a beat, Draco responded, “Only if you pose nude for the photoshoot tomorrow.”
Draco slowly shook his head. Potter was endearingly cute even when he was being impossible. He decided to change the subject. “Did you see the lions, Potter? Those would be more suited to your Gryffindor sensibilities.”
Draco snatched it back. “Should I change it?”
“Let’s get out of here.”
“We’re never
As he neared the field, Draco heard the
“This is not Potter,” he said firmly, looking at Lucius.
“You’re up,” says a voice behind him.
It took a few pokes and prods before Harry cracked open an eye. “Stop shoving me,” he grumbled.
Ron sits up so fast Harry thinks he might be having a heart attack. “Harry! Did Seamus – was Seamus – did he hurt you?”
“Pretty good, right? It has some truly interesting effects.”
“Master Draco, I is knowing that you can hear me!”
“Master Draco,” Ceeley stumbled, clasping her hands. “Ceeley is spoken to the assistant in Resources, sir, and…and…sir, check the paper again.”
Neville caught his eye from across the room. “I knew that they had extra eyes on Malfoy, but I didn’t know it was this bad,” Neville said. “He took three Stunners, all from staff members.”
“The lavender, you mean?”
The next corner was on the lower inside region of the plate, making it harder for Draco. He definitely found it much more difficult to aim for such a low target. There was the sneaking suspicion in the back of his mind that this would go badly; sure enough, he released the ball too low, and it bounced off the ground in front of Nels as she dropped onto her knees to block it with her body.
“Why on earth would we need a rifle, Harry?” Hermione asked, wriggling out of the dress.
“Harry, what did you say?”
“Shove off,” snaps Harry, insides wailing with hurt.
. “We’ll just save these submission requirements, then,” she said, tearing out a page from the back of the issue. “One thing we should do though, before we go through all this trouble, is research the Obfuscation Elixir and see what else’s been published about it.”
“I am,” says Harry evenly, wondering what he’s getting himself into.
“Might as well bring the whole set,” Ron shrugged. “Door’s only right over there.” They set off for the cafe, Harry carrying the entire set of lock picks between them. Neither one looked back to notice Hermione sneak a hit off of the joint before crushing it under her foot.
“Don’t remind me,” Harry said. “We advanced on our own merit here, and that’s what matters.”
Malfoy furiously fixed Harry with an annoyed look. He held one finger up to his lips and hissed, “Shh, Potter!”
Reflecting on how perfectly he’d cooked the eggs, Draco carefully watched Hermione in an attempt to glean her reaction to his letter. He didn’t have to wait long, though; right on schedule, after they’d finished their sausages, she broached the issue.
“Yeah, well I’m never doing that again,” Harry says, slipping the empty beer bottle back on the table it came from.
“So you made it off of work early then,” Harry confirms, taking another small sip of whiskey.
But Draco was saved from having to make a decision at all when a dim light turned on at the far end of the hallway. A dark figure exited a bedroom and walked into the bathroom, thankfully shutting the door behind him. As he listened, Draco could almost make out the calming noises of a Muggle television. Luckily enough, it wasn’t long before a toilet flushed, and a few seconds later a dark shape ventured into the living room. A light flickered on, revealing a drowsy Weasley, who blinked stupidly in the light, yawning deeply before crossing to the couch and digging under the cushions for something. Draco was almost relieved to see him, because he still had no idea what to say to Harry. After a minute, Weasley pulled out a colorful Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes product and stood there in the dim living room reading the package, scratching at his balls.
“Mate,” Ron ventures, “You know what you’re volunteering for, right? Dancing, drinking, flirting with men…”
He could almost feel Potter’s touch now against his skin. There had been a moment the other night when their fingers brushed as Potter handed Draco a ballpoint pen, and all he could think about for the ten minutes afterward (when he was supposed to be reflecting about the highly intensive day of training) was how Potter’s hand felt soft and rough at the same time. Those hands would surely give wonderful massages to help work all the tension out of Draco’s neck and back.

“Of course.” Neville said. “When have you ever known Harry to do or say anything he doesn't mean?"
Ginny and George burst out laughing, George slapping Harry on the back in his mirth. “Merlin, Harry,” he choked. “Malfoy’s got some sense of humor, eh?”
Usually, he’d give demonstrations or offer lectures focused on the finer points of dueling, but today he is only willing to offer commentary. He sits in the stands, watching two young Hogwarts students practice some of the easier techniques. One of them casts “
he make you laugh?” specified Draco.
“You have no idea,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “I feel as though I’ve just signed a binding contract, even though I didn’t name a destination.”
“Why are you doing this to me?” Draco said rhetorically. But then another thought occurred to him, a passing fancy that started to seem all too realistic. “Oh—no, please tell me you didn’t. Tell me that’s not what happened here.”
“Oh, admit it, Potter. You’d much rather be out cursing someone or teaching youngsters the proper techniques.”
“Thanks,” Zabini said sincerely, meeting Harry’s eyes. He gave a curt nod and walked out into the hallway with Neville, leaving Draco in the infirmary with them.
As he got closer and closer to climax, Draco’s mouth became wetter and he sucked Harry harder in an effort to bring them both off at the same time. When Harry slicked up another finger and slid two inside, stimulating the prostate with every thrust, Draco found himself fucking himself back into Harry’s hand, clenching around his fingers as he came longer and harder than he’d probably ever before. Draco’s vision blacked out for a moment as he came in Harry’s mouth and as, a few breaths later, Harry came down his throat.
Harry’s cheeks were burning, even as Luna giggled. “That’s quite enough!” he declared, upsetting his long-forgotten teacup in his haste to remove himself from the sofa. “Luna, I sure as hell hope you got something you can work with, because we are
He ragged on Bales jokingly, and made Draco smile. “I didn’t know you taught Children’s Lit too. I’m in Samot’s 502 this semester, and it’s fantastic.”
“Kindly unhand my guests, Steve,” came Draco’s unforgettable drawl from across the room.
“It takes one to know one, you know,” he wise-cracked with perhaps more gusto than he felt, following her into the dining room suit and taking a seat. “Shall we finish our article tonight?” They hadn’t worked on it for the past few weeks, even though there was just one small discovery published in the most current issue that they needed to put into conversation with their own ideas.
“Besides,” he said. “Zee’s a dick, and you’re not, so even if you fuck something up, they’ll still never regret having you around.”
. Best to have done with it the respectable way, where he aired his grievances in an acceptable manner. That is, should he decide that Harry’s offense had gone too far and was something that he couldn't live with. Draco kept fighting with the warring sides of himself, back and forth, for the rest of the night.
“No, not at all,” Draco snuffled, “Its fine, we should keep going.”
Harry fought the urge to nestle his face in the crook of her neck and breathe deeply. He wanted to end this situation, not encourage it. “Ginny,” he said. She responded only by squeezing him harder. Harry squirmed out of her grip and lightly gripped both of her shoulders. He tried to impart how serious he was by staring piercingly into her eyes.
“There’s just nothing available whatsoever,” groaned Chris as they drove down yet another side street.
Harry smiles. “I can be.” They make eye contact and burst out laughing just as the waiter arrives with the spring rolls.
Harry and Draco have an interesting time at the Burrow. When they get home later that night, they take their relationship one step further.
Potter started perking up immediately. “This is super convenient,” he enthused, tossing down a bag of equipment and drawing out several dirty baseballs. “Literally right in your own backyard.”
There was only one professor left to visit that Friday: Otarres. Draco loved his Gothic Lit class, but if he had learned one thing after his experience with the Children’s Lit professor, it was that someone could be utterly amazing in class and horrible in person. Bright and early at 11am, Draco walked down the halls of the English department and went to find Otarres’s door. It was open. He knocked lightly on the wood with a tentative smile, and Otarres looked up from his desk to greet Draco with a wide grin. “Hi! Come on in,” he welcomed.
“Of course I do,” said Draco, annoyed. “I’ve been here for a lot longer than you, I suspect.”
“Now I’m evil God,” Harry said. “No, really though,” he said as Draco quieted. “These idiots always want me to be the hero, so I thought –”
Draco doesn’t laugh. His mouth is turned down at the corners and his eyes look sad.
“Are you going to turn into a bloody wanker again?” Ron’s shoulders tensed, across the table. Harry took another bite of his burger, savoring Ron’s discomfort and the way he tried to play it off.

“Just what
if you have any further questions.” And Draco was expelled out of the fireplace, coughing in soot, as the attendant unceremoniously ended the call.
They cuddled for a moment before Draco started feeling really uncomfortable despite his tiredness. “Potter,” he mumbled. “I’m cold and wet.”
“Is that it?” I gasp, leaping to my feet. “Are those fireworks?”
“Alright, Bucks! Time to take the field!” Nate shouted, jogging towards first base. There was a lot of hand claps and ass slaps, and everyone eventually made it to their designated position.
He’d almost felt back to normal by the time he re-entered the corridor. Taking a deep breath, Harry resolved to find Draco, even if he didn’t want to be found, and explain things to him.
choice. He’d parroted his father’s beliefs for years, which got him ostracized from society. If he did go, Draco knew that it wouldn’t be because Narcissa and Andromeda encouraged the idea. They had simply opened his mind to an alternative path, one he’d never before considered. That wasn’t to say Draco didn’t appreciate their blessing. It was nice to do something that your family wasn’t opposed to, especially –Draco realized with an unpleasant squelch in his stomach- as they were the closest family members he had left.
“Wear it always, Potter,” he exhaled, lips pressed against Potter’s ear. “Promise that you’ll think of me after I’m gone.”
Nervously wringing his hands, Malfoy looks down. “After Mother moved to France and I started my Potions mastery, I had to make some living adjustments. My Potions skills were really transferable to cooking.”
“You did,” Draco said simply. “You always wore your heart on your sleeve, and sure, not everyone believed you, but the ones who could see your passion supported you for the long haul.”
Snapping her fingers, Hermione exclaimed, “That’s what we forgot! To research not only the work being done in
“How about that one!” howled Nate. “Are you going to tell me that was a ball too, and that you didn’t just pull your head skyhigh and swing with a cavemanesque blow?”
“Oi, Malfoy,” the only girl amongst them said sarcastically. “Since you think you’re so clever, always putting yourself on a pedestal, we thought you might appreciate it if we stuck you up on one permanently!”
Out of nowhere he was transported back in time to a memory of playing Quidditch with Draco on the Manor grounds, speeding playfully away while Draco chased him; Draco taunting him mercilessly until one of the insults pissed him off enough to retaliate, at which point Draco snatched the Snitch from thin air where it had been lurking right under his nose. He couldn’t even be upset when Draco gleefully celebrated his victory, turning wide loop-the-loops and grinning mischievously back at him. Pride and love had swelled inside his chest to the point where he was tackling Draco mid-flight, controlling their descent amidst rapid “Potter, you maniac”s and “You’re going to kill us both, you stupid moron”s. The grass was soft as he laid Draco on the ground afterwards, kissing him mercilessly.
“Holy fuck, Malfoy, haven’t you ever heard of knocking?” Weasley snapped. “I could have seriously hurt you if I had my wand. What are you doing here? Don’t you get your kicks cleaning the sink or something?”
, per say, but it was an encouraging improvement from those former dark days when he wasn’t able to get out of bed.
Harry frowns. “There’s good people where. What more does a place need?”
—and pushed it open, letting the sunlight stream in from outside.
Sighing, Draco crossed the minefield of a living room and checked the table himself. Behind him, there were more grumbles and noises of annoyance. On top of a parchment that said “Shit McClabe Promised Will Be On The Exam” were a handful of pens. Some were chewed, some were broken with clips missing, and still others were bright neon colors. Among all of them, Draco noticed a fancy fountain pen. “Is this it?” he asked, holding it up.
“Nate, I think you really have lost your mind,” Mike said. “What about our jobs? It’s not like we can all just pick up and take a road trip across the country for the
JANUARY 2000
Before he can finish his sentence, Malfoy comes at him again, this time with an even more rapid burst of Dark spells. Harry can hear him muttering under his breath to ensure the magic’s potency and direction. Asten returns fire, but Harry sees that Malfoy is easily winning. In about ten more seconds, he will be at Malfoy’s mercy.
All too soon, Potter released him and Draco was instantly sorry for rushing their contact. That might have very well been the only time Potter touched him and he had to go and ruin it. Already, his euphoria from pitching was starting to lift, leaving him with a hopeless crush on someone he couldn’t have.
“So that’s a yes?”
Cecelia laughed. “I can see how well matched you are for him,” she said to Harry while Malfoy looked on with an injured expression. “Draco,” Cecelia continued lightly. “Wasn’t it the last time you were here I gave you that crochet lesson?”
‘Dromeda poured tea into two cups, and offered one to Draco as she sat down at the cozy kitchen table. He warily accepted, and sat down across from her, careful to keep his bathrobe firmly closed.
, Draco did actually feel a lot more intimate with the dark haired man. Maybe open and honest conversations had some merit after all. Anyway, Draco knew exactly how terrible Potter had been at Legilimency and Occlumency. If he didn’t tell Potter how he felt or what he needed, he'd probably never figure it out on his own.
“It was,” Malfoy confirmed, his countenance becoming thoughtful. Harry much preferred this look; it almost reminded him of the way Malfoy used to deviously plot against him at school. “We’d just learned how to make a chain, and then you started teaching me the single crochet when I was rushed away by my parents.”
Their last night of training was Friday, as the teams were due for their first practices Saturday afternoon. As per their normal schedule, Harry attended Joe Buck Yourself’s insanely early morning practice, a grumpy Malfoy and his usual mug of coffee in tow.
Once he was reinstated as a proper citizen, Draco could see himself purchasing several hundred acres of land far away from any neighboring communities. The outdoors was peaceful, and Merlin knew Draco needed more peace in his life. Everything would feel even more perfect, he grudgingly admitted to himself, if he had someone like Potter to come home to each night. Actually, it would be ideal to come home to Potter. The stubborn Gryffindor would keep his house from ever feeling
“I want you,” he whispered in Draco’s ear, his breath tickling Draco’s skin. “Forget about what I said before."
Potter patted him lightly on the shoulder, returning the snake back to the shelf. “It’s alright,” he said. “I reckon that the old grannies will adopt you into their crocheting clubs if you just ask nicely.”
There’s a noise from the house, and both Harry and Malfoy spin around to see what’s going on. Ron has burst out the front door and is running down the path towards them. They spare each other a quick glance, a look of solidarity, before turning their attention to him.
exactly with the way things had turned out, it was true that a weight had been lifted off of Hermione’s shoulders too as she led the way to the heated, sunny kitchen.
one pitches.
. Instead of running over and picking up a quill, however, Draco took a deep breath. He folded the letter carefully and placed it on the table, getting up to turn on the tea kettle. His tired ramblings were challenging to understand at best and incoherent at worst, and things had been good with Harry recently. He didn’t want to fuck anything up. Besides; Draco preferred to give all correspondence a second read-through before responding to ensure that he didn’t miss anything.
he changed, really?”
“Yeah, what’s wrong with that?”
Draco could only imagine what an ellay was, but he committed San Diego, California to memory. That was definitely going to be his next destination.
“I’m glad,” Draco laughed, feeling properly tipsy now. “Let’s not tell Harry, okay?”
To stay in that cabin any longer would be the death of him, so Draco recovers his flashlight and walks down a different path, the one that led to the fire pit where other counselors sang songs after dinner. He’d only listened, not sang, and yet several of the tunes were permanently embedded in his head. Humming one about a great big moose, Draco hops over a fallen tree branch and wandlessly Summons a bag of marshmallows. What the camp directors don’t know will never hurt them. He pops one into his mouth, chewing pronouncedly. Rounding the bend still with a mouthful of squishy goodness, Draco heads pell-mell for the fire pit only to see Potter already sitting on the very stump he was planning to occupy.
He exchanged a look with Ron, one that definitely said they’d get some coffee afterward as long as no one was bleeding.
“Go make you pancakes?” repeated Harry. He raised an eye. “Someone’s feeling awfully demanding this morning…”
As he Vanished his filthy clothes right off of his body, Draco could hear Harry banging around the dishes in the sink. Apparently washing by hand instead of magic was his means of coping.
“That was amazing, Harry,” says Draco honestly as he lies down besides Potter. Snuggling in as Potter’s little spoon, Draco covers them both with the blankets.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
They are led into a room that smells of lilacs where more loud music plays. Their blindfolds are removed, and Harry makes out a large ballroom with a stage. Instead of dancing, there are tables and chairs spread out over the dance floor, and the suited attendants usher Harry and Seamus to one near the right of the stage. They are instantly brought cocktails, but Harry reaches for the water glasses present on every table to quench his thirst.
Since Draco had taken control of the situation up until now, it came as a bit of a shock when Draco put his head in his hands and started pacing around the room. “Great,” he said. “We should have thought this far in advance, Potter, and came up with a cover story for why we’ve been spending time together. Because no one will certainly believe any excuses now.”
“—I can scramble the yolks—”
“No.”
Potter sat on breeze blocks abandoned at the far side of the parking area while Nels smoked a cigarette, gesticulating furiously at him. As Draco approached, she dropped the smoke and stubbed it out with her foot.
But on that same night when they fielded grounders, Malfoy seemed much more at home, taking particularly well to middle infield. Harry recruited Cale and Chris to help out as Malfoy practiced taking the throws from the outfield, moving seamlessly between taking the throw from the cutoff as short stop and acting as cutoff as second baseman when Harry asked him to switch. Malfoy caught almost all of the balls, exerting himself to make the hard catches, and possessed a fire in his throws Harry only wished he could emulate. In fact, he thought Malfoy would make an excellent pitcher. At the first opportunity, he was planning to mention it to Nate and ask for his opinion.
There was no verbal response, but Harry felt Malfoy’s fingers weave through his hair and hold fast. “Are we alright?” he whispered in Malfoy’s ear.
Malfoy, a new piece of legislation was passed, and you can no longer contact the Ministry outside of normal business hours. See the
Seamus laughs. “That’s right, drink up mate. I’m not kidding about how horrible the drinks are, really. The beer I had last time tasted like goat piss.”
.” Nels and José inconspicuously shared a look of horror, drawing Nate’s attention. “Y’all are on the shit list,” he informed them pleasantly. “I know that once you have teams of your own, that’s where the bulk of your attention will be going.”
Potter was first to step through the door, looking around in excitement. “Whoa, Malfoy,” he said. “This is fantastic.”
Maybe seeing Ron and possibly rekindling a friendship—not a sexual relationship, but a solid friendship—would give her the closure she needed to move on. Draco had offered to go out to the clubs and help Hermione pull, but she’d refused each time he’d asked. It hadn’t felt right yet, the idea of being with someone else intimately.
At least this was a song he remembered. After dinner the other night, at Singing Tree in front of the entire camp full of campers and even a few counselors, Draco had totally buggered up the lyrics to one of everybody’s favorite songs. It could have been worse. The campers in the front row took over singing, and he was able to laugh it off and deal with the ribbing from some of the other counselors.
Leaning into the touch, Draco whispered back, “Are you sure we’re ready for this?”
Nobody was around, thankfully, when his tears started falling. Draco pressed his face into his arms to muffle the sound of sobbing, hoping that giving in would allow to get it out of his system sooner, but he couldn’t feel any signs of his sadness stopping, especially as he sank into the hole of despair that was his past.
“Oh, so now we’re just using him to get you a date?”
“Exactly,” Draco said, gesturing with his loofah. “Now you can see a different side of the Manor. I grew up here, you know.”
him? Mum specifically told you not to!” the Weaselette took a deep breath before continuing. “For Merlin’s sake, now she might not let you in the house.”
Ron reached out and softly touched Hermione’s cold hand. “I’m sorry,” he said, “For not listening to you. For being a wanker every time you wanted to go out and do something instead of staying in. For giving you shit when you wanted to take Harry’s relationship with Malfoy seriously, when you wanted to support him because he was our best friend. For for putting so much emphasis on sex when you—when
“Sofa?” scoffed Harry. “Ancient rat-trap is more like it.” Draco silenced him with a Look before beginning again.
“I’ve done a complete first round of trials using mice and other small mammals, and one informed consent trial with Muggles who had suffered spell damage. As informed as they could be, anyway. The department is trying to get St. Mungo’s to clear me for a trial on some of the patients there.”
He was greeted by the furious face of Auror Dawlish, who had his hands on his knees, panting. “Auror…Potter,” he choked out, “I thought you had…a lot more sense!” He straightened up, still gasping for breath.
There was also a twist. After the kiss had occurred, everyone else would judge whether or not the participants had enjoyed themselves, and if they had, each would do a shot. If they were blushing afterwards, two shots. Draco had not consented to the additions to the rules; as far as he was concerned, “Suck and Blow” had been close contact enough. Not that he cared about what others thought, but it would have been very difficult to leave the game and walk out of the room. After all, he’d have to see these people every club meeting for the rest of the year. Not to mention the fact he didn’t think he could walk home thanks to the whiskey.
Snickering, Mike threw the ball back to José before turning back to Harry. “He’s pretty fucking hot too, if you’re into men. Good luck, stud.”
Neville stepped aside and allowed the Slytherins to enter. They approached Draco’s bed without another word. It was awkward, but nobody disturbed the silence.
“Forget an extra piece, I’m having the whole roll,” Harry declared. “Though how can the photoshoot be worse than the interview?”
Behind him, the team broke into applause and cheers, Potter’s voice louder and more noticeable than all the rest. José slapped him on the back and congratulated him right as Nate ran up onto the mound and enveloped Draco into a tight hug.
Almost comically, his eyes widened and his nose pointed in disgust. Draco
“What do you mean you know what I’m thinking?” Draco asked cautiously.
Intrigued, Draco listened to his mother. She had never spoken before of her relationship with Lucius, but he had long suspected she was unhappy in their marriage.
“Is this even their territory?” Harry asked.
“Of course I can, Harry,” she said. “You know, I really can’t tell you how much better I feel after having this talk.”
The hurt was already coiling in his gut. Draco pushed it down by masking his emotions in anger. “Potter, I hate to burst your happy bubble, but you are aware that our first game is on Monday? I’m simply not prepared to pitch and will require your services for our usual hour of practice tonight.”
“Yeah, yeah. But next time, you’re going to be more than a pillow princess,” warned Potter, carding his fingers through Draco’s blonde hair.
“Yeah, well I’m not the one who hasn’t gotten laid in like three years,” snaps back Ron, draining the cocktail.
“Lots,” said Draco, his eyes beginning to close. Potter doesn’t ask any more questions, and they simply lie there in silence enjoying the sounds of the night. Sounds of frogs chirping from down near the pond travel on the cool breeze, and Draco began to shiver. Wandlessly, Potter casts a Heating Charm, and instantly he’s comforted.
There was no need to do anything but read. Though Draco lived to pick apart the texts, more often than not he would find himself getting caught up in the stories. Only through the experiences of his precious characters did Draco allow himself to feel anything at all.
“Want to go have brunch?” Hermione suggested.
“Apparating. But first, let’s pre-game it up a little. They have shit drinks, but we’re not going for the booze.” Seamus pulls a flask out of his jacket pocket, takes a long swig, and then passes it to Harry. Remembering his vow to be in control of his senses, Harry throws back the liquor, but blocks the hole with his tongue so only a little liquid flows into his mouth.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
,” Draco muttered, wondering what caused his sudden generosity. As he sat there at the table, listening to the tub filling upstairs, an image of Potter flashed into his mind. Harry was smiling almost flirtatiously, his green eyes glinting in the sunlight. He was wearing Quidditch robes and gear, standing with a broomstick slung over his shoulder. As always, his handsome form caught and held Draco’s eye. Harry’s smile only deepened. He held his hand, encased in Quidditch leathers, out to Draco, who looked at it with wide eyes.

this match.
“But there’s something there for you and Harry,” Hermione argued. “I see it every time I look at the two of you. I can look at Ron for days, and the only time I see him come alive is when he's eating or raging about Harry.”
He shot into the bathroom and turned on the faucet, excited when clear, cool water poured out. Draco then tried to remove his bathrobe, but found that it wasn’t budging. What the absolute
The parchment slipped out of his hand, and as it fell to the floor, Draco could make out letterhead from the Magical Congress of the United States of America, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Auror Division.
They hopped in the car and Draco got on the highway, letting the wind coming through the open window cool the sweat in his hair, even though it was sure to be a mess later on. Somehow, with Potter by his side, Draco found that he was able to reclaim the euphoria he’d previously only ever felt from pitching. Maybe these challenges were good for him after all. Potter glanced at him then, grinning at his hair blowing madly in the breeze, and Draco finally felt like he was more than just content. It took a minute to recognize the sensation, but he supposed it might be something like happiness.
Draco was left alone on the baseball field, watching the wind stir up the loose dust and blow it around. He was oddly curious about what it would feel like to actually play a competitive game on a field so different than the Qudditch Pitch, which would, as Potter had so kindly pointed out, involve running.
"You're on, Malfoy," Potter returned, but with a smile.
“Doesn’t matter if I’m okay with it or not, now does it?”
People were slapping each other on the butts and backs, but what was even more horrifying was that they were including Draco in this treatment.
“If you say ‘it was with your sister’ I’m going to fucking kill you,” barks Ron.
“Oh dear, Potter,” sighs Malfoy dramatically, “You must lack confidence in my cooking skills, because now I’m going to have to eat all the treacle tart myself.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked disbelievingly. “I know you, Malfoy.”
Suddenly very nervous, Draco nodded yes and then Potter gently put a hand on his shoulder, stepping very close so that they were only scant inches apart. Draco thought to remove Potter’s glasses and then tilted his face downwards an inch or so, as Potter was just a little shorter. Just as Draco thought they would never touch, Potter leaned so close that his lips nearly touched Draco’s. Instead, he felt a light rustling on his eyelashes, and thought it would be prudent to at least move his a little bit so that Potter didn’t think he was standing there fantasizing.
He sat in one of the remaining chairs without complaint, tried his cake, and complimented Mrs. Weasley. But he could only look between Draco and Mrs. Weasley with varying expressions of shock, love, and relief. They sat quietly together, soaking in the moment.
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
He smiled as he made his way across the land, breathing deeply to savor the fresh air. When Draco reached the back door and went to pull open the handle, Harry chastised, “Don’t go getting mud all over the floor again! You know I can’t do a proper Cleaning Charm.”
if Nate was going to kick him off of the team.
“Rowle?” Ron asked, placing the pillow over Dolohov’s face and pushing down hard. Harry noticed that he didn’t bother to check to make sure all the air pockets were out. “He still needs to be dealt with, but he’s better shape than this one here.” He kicked Dolohov's uninjured knee.
Groaning from tiredness, Draco stretches and looks at the clock. “Harry, are you alright? You’re not having bad dreams again, are you?”
“Even so,” sighed Potter, “The responsibility is on me to finish the project. Everyone sees me as their Savior, and they want me to put the world back together. I have to at least try, even if it's a daunting task."
Saved from any further nagging reminders about the state of his future, Draco allowed the menacing glare to slide from his face, adopting the now-familiar expression of misery as he contemplated what the rest of the summer would entail. As he trod up to the pile after Pansy’s clumsy retreat, Draco caught sight of Potter walking his wheelbarrow back down the hill with the other members of the Golden Trio tag-teaming him on either side. Only the sight of Potter could make horses, manure, and early mornings bearable, and Draco fully comprehended just how much of a sop he was for admitting such a notion.
?” grumbled Zee. Nate chose to ignore him, though Mike and José snickered.
Potter kicked the dirt in frustration, and Draco could see that he was ready to take Nate on as well. He wanted to stop Potter, but was somehow unable to uproot himself from the dirt.  Fortunately, Nels was already handling it, making motions to lead Potter off of the field. He actually went to backhand her, but she effortlessly blocked his blow, frogmarching him away from the rest of the team.
Fury was still burning in Harry’s gut two and a half hours after the Zee incident. He’d relaxed marginally while he and Malfoy sat in what could only be described as peaceful silence in the parking lot and was almost back to normal when they finally headed out to find some food before returning to practice. Unfortunately, they returned to the field only to find Zee gloating and Nate with an expression full of resignation.
Potter handed Draco another biscuit. “Which was what?"
“Because anything hurts less than the quiet,” came the response.
“Never,” says Harry, throwing himself back at Draco, who catches him and gives him a loving hug.
I sling my pack over my shoulder and blink uneasily in the sunlight. Potter, Granger, and the Weasel have parked nearby and are standing around talking enthusiastically. See, this is exactly what I meant. I turn and face the opposite direction so I don’t have to look at them.
, they’re alright?” Draco asked, his cousin’s name unfamiliar coming off of his tongue.
Inwardly, Draco groaned. Not only did he have to
“How was what?”
Suddenly, firm hands pushed him back on his bum. “Breathe, Draco,” a voice instructed. “Slowly. In…two… three… four… out… two… three… four. Come on, you’re not even trying.”
“Malfoy, do you think we can ask Tipsy for some of those biscuits to eat on the way?” Potter suddenly appeared in the living room, dressed but still toweling off his hair.
He can’t focus; there’s too much light, all around him it’s too bright and it’s impossible to breathe.
There was a collective groan. No handout they had received from Nate in the past could be considered anywhere near exciting. Honestly, Harry was surprised he hadn’t prepared a full-out PowerPoint presentation (While drunk last night, Chris told Harry about Nate’s debriefings as the end of the season, and how they were usually more painful than the entire season).
where he could shove it, but used his newfound skill of restraint to keep his mouth shut. Besides, he reasoned, he could drag the errand out and spend some time away from the drudgeries of camp that seemed to never end. Without question, he nodded a goodbye to Pansy and watched almost regretfully as she ditched Macmillan to rejoin her own group with Potter at the head.
The door is stuck again, so Draco’s forced to pull on the handle with a steadily increasing pressure until it gives, rocketing out of the jamb and feverishly rattling back and forth from the built-up strain. At least two of his seven co-workers stir from the racket, and he tries not to let the door slam behind him as he makes his way down the steps to the rocky path leading to the bathhouse. Draco relieves his bladder and takes another huge gulp of water while he’s down there, hopefully doing something to quench his never-ending thirst before heading back into the oppressively quiet and claustrophobic cabin.
“Before you go, try a sip of this. It’s fantastic stuff. My friend Asten brought it.” Seamus holds out a small, silver flask not unlike the one he and Harry pre-gamed with earlier that night.
Harry brought a blanket and Draco thought nothing of it until they’d arrived at the cemetery. If it was one of his parents buried six feet under, there was nothing going to keep him here all day presumably having a conversation with them. Surprisingly, his feet walked in synch with Harry’s to the grave as if he’d been here many times before.
Draco snorted. “You don’t know all of my secrets yet, Potter,” he said mischievously. Five seconds later he was back on the bed, hand dripping with lube, before rising up on bent knees to reach behind himself and push the plug into place. It was riveting, watching Draco act so shamelessly in front of him. The shyness was still there, but in a way, Harry could definitely tell Draco enjoyed watching Harry watch
“I’m trying to move past it,” he says bracingly. “I don’t want my life to be controlled by something again, even if it’s my own mind.”
“You did.” Draco looked at Hermione, but her attention was on the text in front of her, and the only sound was that of a page turning.
see me as less than.”
Draco shakes his head. “Oh, you have no idea how much I wanted to strangle him. I had to do the next best thing and let him get taken down a few bloody notches by another student.”
They walked until they were away from the living units, out in the middle of seemingly nowhere. The helipad was close, so they sat down on it to get out of the cold, wet grass. When Potter clicked off his flashlight, Draco followed suit. The stars were bright, but Potter’s eyes were brighter.
He opened his craft box, pulling out another skein of yarn and a hook and tossing them to her. “Can you do a half-double foundation chain?”
“It is kind of nice outside,” Malfoy admits. “I don’t get out nearly enough.”
go, but his feet led him back to Dumbledore’s tomb where he had sat with Potter. The area was equally deserted, as everyone was either hard at work on another part of the castle or back with the crowd.
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
“That’s Nate’s favorite line,” said Cale knowledgably, and loudly, as he and Harry walked away together. “But good game, though, Harry! You’ve come a long way since tryouts.”
Club, after all. His reluctance reached an all-time high when the next game, “Spin the Bottle,” was announced. Once he understood the rules of the game, Draco became convinced that his teammates were all just horny fucks. They explained the rules to him – you spin the bottle and kiss whoever it points to – and he could only imagine where they’d been. There weren’t rumors of mad STD outbreaks on campus for no reason.
Pulling back slightly, Draco gave him an inquisitive look. Harry could see all of Draco’s insecurities written clear on his pale, pointy face.
“Should the floor not be covered in dishcloths?”
“Wow,” he says, going back for more sauce. “This is fantastic.”
“I’m glad,” said Karl. “Give us a call if you have any more questions.”

Malfoy laughed now, chokingly bitter. “What rock have you been living under, Potter? They’re rounding up and arresting former Death Eaters like each one is the Dark Lord himself in disguise. It was only a matter of time before they took me in on some trumped up charge; I’m trying to be free the only way I can.”
Potter still seemed at a loss for words. Draco pointed at the door, “Out, Potter. Escort yourself back to the biscuits and I’ll see you in a few.”
“Blimey, Malfoy, you’re a lifesaver,” swore Weasley, shoving the cushions back into place with visible relief. “I accidentally borrowed it the other day, and boy was he bent out of shape about it. Told the whole office that if it doesn’t mysteriously make its way back on his desk first thing tomorrow morning, we’re working the weekend.”
“That’s right, handsome,” whispers Asten. “Just imagine how much better it will feel when my dick’s in your mouth instead of my tongue.” The blood smears all over Harry’s face from the man’s broken nose seem to catch Asten’s eye, because he says, “We can use this too, as lube…” He starts undressing Harry, who tries to keep his face as neutral as possible even though he is living out a nightmare.
“Fair enough,” said Ron. “But still, we really don’t understand why you’re so concerned with what happens to him. It’s good to see Malfoy taken down a couple of pegs.”
“What am I going to do with you,” Harry joked, crossing the kitchen with an apron around his waist. “I’d kiss you, but I just took a shower, thanks.”
“It definitely reads more like Hermione than it does Luna,” Harry laughed.
“Honestly, I’m glad to see you have a heart.”
Draco roused from his slumber, focusing on his friends. "Do you want us to give you a minute?" Harry asked, trying to be thoughtful. Draco nodded.
relieved that Harry and Ron were arriving later that day. He’d been an absolute menace to live with for the past few weeks, what with the way he’d been nervously twitching and crocheting unpteenth dishclothes in his spare time. There were now two trunks full of his creations, one in the living room and the other in their bedroom. And when he wasn’t crocheting, Draco was scrubbing down every surface in the flat by hand, claiming it gave him an outlet for all his nervous energy. But Merlin, wouldn’t
It took a bit for Draco to take all of him; it had been a few weeks since they’d been able to go all the way, with the holidays and all. Several times Draco pulled Harry away from the holiday festivities for shared blow jobs, both making promises to resume things later, but usually finding themselves too tired to continue when they got home.
“You can just share the sandwich with me, then, and we’ll both be hungry again in a while.”
He paused his drying out of shock. "Potter, one does not simply drink
Bellatrix retracted her hand immediately, turning around to glare at the interruption. “What do you want, Cissy?”
Well, that certainly brought up questions even as it answered others. Harry’s stomach dropped as he thought of how life might change in the next six months. Apparently he wasn’t the only one who was feeling restless… But what intrigued him the most was Hermione’s insight about Draco. He’d clearly be graduating soon as well—what were his intentions? Just the thought that Draco’s trajectory could once again collide with his was enough to occupy Harry’s thoughts for the rest of the evening. And if he happened to place those pressed lavender flowers in a soft cloth bag and sleep with it under his pillow, well, that was a secret no one else needed to know about.
about going on vacation!”
“Perhaps, son, perhaps. You’ve been given this new chance, but do you deserve it?”
Teabags added, Hermione brought the tea cups back over to the table and set one in front of Draco. “You’re not going to sleep with him, are you?”
His and Potter’s friendship didn’t mean their rivalry was dead. Draco bristled, determined to strike Potter out. He rosined up, gripped the ball, and released. It was much too far inside, and Potter had to do a strange dance move to avoid getting hit.
“Not so fast, Potter.” Malfoy said, waggling a finger. The blood he’d been continually wiping away was dripping down his arm now.
Draco smirked. This might be one thing he’d miss, raising Potter’s hackles. “Oh no, of course not, Potter,” he said with generosity. “I’d much rather be having you in.”
“OUT!” shouted Nate from behind the woman in the gear. Draco hadn’t even seen him come down from his bag. “Nice, Nels, that’s exactly the kind of tag I want to see.”
“What was it?” asks Hermione, genuinely interested.
Sealing the necklace around Potter’s neck with a spell that would really make him work if he wanted to take it off, Draco gave his lover one last kiss.
“I’d shut up,” Cale advised. “You’re digging a hole, mate.”
, get you back into the mood.”
“And start doing pushups now,” broke in Malfoy. “Maybe it will hurt less then on Tuesday.”
Harry waves as Ron walks away, turning his attention back to Draco. “Where do you want to go?”
“I sure hope this works out,” said Nate, finally allowing his worry to show through. “My brother was really excited about this whole deal, and it would be great to finally get a bit of a vacation.”
JANUARY 2000
“Oh, don’t make that face at me, you,” Potter teased. “As impossible as it sounds, you had a little snag in your pants and I mended it for you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry wasn’t able to form a coherent thought, let alone respond. Draco was hitting his spot every time, and the pressure was building to the point where he was dying for release.
“No,” replied Harry honestly. “Was it drafted by the Ministry after the War?”
The pitch sailed out of his hand, coming off like a fastball and heading right down the middle of the plate before dropping slightly out of the strike zone and landing softly in Nels’ glove. Draco always liked to say that he needed to see something to believe it, but even after executing a perfect pitch that could so seamlessly fool a batter, he was still utterly amazed.
In response, Harry slapped Draco, and it hurt. “Harry, what the fuck?” he scoffed.
“And these things, these can-doms,” Draco said, trying not to flush again. “I can easily find them?”
Potter laughed. “After seven years, you’re only just noticing that now?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, unable to keep the longing out of his voice.
Draco met Cale’s eyes and saw nothing but sincerity there. He swallowed the lump in his throat, afraid to out his emotions by speaking.
“You know what it was, Malfoy. Did you like it?”
“I know you’re still mad at us—” she began.
Draco finished the last desk, taking care to set a charm on each one that would cause anyone who tried to stick chewing gum to the bottom of it to very quickly grow a unibrow. That would deter most, if not all, miscreants. Even worse than his first year detention into the Forbidden Forest had been the one where Filch made him scrape off gum—without magic—for three hours straight. Draco was determined to make it to each classroom and cast the same charm on all of the desks; this way, Potter could never say that he didn’t have a lasting impact on the renovated castle.
“If that’s what you want—”
After using the first two weeks of the spring semester to fall into a routine, Draco became bored. He and Jake continued to kick ass during Debate Club sessions, though he avoided every party invitation that came his way, and his reading load for all his new English classes was manageable. Term papers wouldn’t start until much later in the semester, thankfully. Draco realized that he needed a change; a new challenge. Making a life in the muggle world had been easier than he anticipated. He did feel isolated much of the time – bonding with Americans was different and much more difficult, and Draco still had to keep his magic a secret. Without being able to share two of the biggest parts of him, Draco didn’t really expect to be able to form any truly strong relationships.
“Yup,” said Harry. He reached into the pockets and found that the gloves he’d put there over a year ago were in fact still there. As they walked out the door and down to the sidewalk, he slid them on, feeling like he was home for the first time in nearly a year.
“Done!” Karl said, satisfied. “No one will even know it’s there unless they look directly up your nose.”
As usual, Potter wasn't listening because
The next month flew by for Draco, not the least because Potter insisted that they continue to work twelve hours a day. Draco was even more willing to stay late with him, though, especially after that day in the butterfly garden. Everyone else left around five in the afternoon at the latest and Draco found himself wishing they’d leave even earlier so he could have more private time alone with Potter. They would kiss in the unstable Hogwarts corridors, accidentally dirtying each other in their haste to touch. Draco wanted Potter in every way possible, but for some reason Potter was insisting that they take things slowly. This declaration had been made after Draco tried to push things farther one day; Potter had somehow summoned the self-control to slowly pull Draco’s hand away from his trousers, where he was trying to undo Potter’s zip, and politely ask Draco to stop rushing. They would have to have some sort of sex talk, Draco supposed, and sooner rather than later. If Potter was going to make him wait, he at least wanted to know why.
in the silent cabin. Someone beneath his bunk suddenly stops snoring, but he isn’t buggered enough to care.
“Here.” Vanishing both of their clothes, Harry smiled to see a now-naked Draco sitting on top of him.
“Yeah, yeah,” Potter groused, standing up and brushing the dirt off the back of his Muggle jeans. With a wave of his wand, the bag full of bread suddenly Transfigured into a reasonably comfortable-looking mattress, though it was adorned with Gryffindor colored sheets, pillows, and covers.
“Then what is it about?” Weasley asked. He opened the box and drew out the contents, studying them closely.
“Well, it’s not like you were really all that scholarly while we were in school,” Draco pointed out. “You’re much better with your hands.”
“And yet you still never listen to a word I say,” Father said with malice. He subtly took a deep breath as if to prepare himself for something unpleasant. In this respect, Draco knew exactly how he felt.
Harry looked at him confused, unable to imagine what was coming next.
Even for Malfoy, that was a strange request. “Why?”
“Very,” Harry answered.
Hermione ignored Draco for the rest of the week, still ticked off that he hadn’t yet written back to Harry. And he’d tried, more than a few times, but the words just wouldn’t come to him.
“I’ll start taking a list now of everyone who already knows they want to participate,” said Cale, turning his handout over and stealing Nate’s pen. He started writing down his name.
Harry shoved him onto the bed and tickled him, and soon, it had turned into a full-out war between the two. After a few minutes, he had Draco crying for mercy.
“Yes,” said Nate. “Make sure you clean up the dugout! Don’t you give me that look, Mike, I saw you spitting sunflower seeds in there earlier. And make sure you’re well rested for Monday!”
“I’m sorry, Hermione,” said Draco. It was the first time he’d called her by her given name, but somehow, it didn’t feel strange.
Settling back down, Ron asks, “What did he do while you lot were dancing?”
Draco reeled him back in, hugging Potter close to his chest. Somehow, somewhere, the gods had taken pity on him. They’d given him his deepest desire, fulfilled every one of his longings from the past few years. It would definitely be a shame when they became vengeful and took it all away after they’d had their fun.
“Of course I want this,” said Malfoy, looking offended for the first time. “Why else would I bother, Potter?”
He didn’t go to Draco. His pride was a major obstacle as was his frustration that not only had Draco stayed at the library practically
“Where did they come from? Who was Harry with?” asks Hermione pointedly, gazing impatiently back at Ron.
was not the place for him. If Draco didn’t at least have some intelligent, sentient beings to interact with, he might just lose his mind completely. Not to mention the disgusting smell coming from the lake and the downtrodden appearance of what seemed to be the main hub of the city.
“Fine, can’t we just shoot them from here, then?”
Remembering how much grief he’d given Malfoy over being late, Harry grudgingly skipped breakfast and Flooed over to Malfoy Manor.
“Blimey, that’ll hit the spot,” agrees Ron. “Hang on.” A second later, he’s sprawled out all over Harry’s living room floor. “Shit, I tripped on the way over. Sorry for the mess, though.”
Naturally, Potter couldn’t have picked a more embarrassing moment to seek him out. Burying his face in his arms again, Draco muttered, “What do you want, Potter?” Little hiccuping sobs escaped despite his best efforts, which only made him hate himself more.
“Yeah, yeah,” he spat, unable to come up with a better comeback. Sliding the jersey off in one slick motion, Draco missed the way Potter’s eyes traveled appreciatively over his torso. He slipped it back on, already worming his feet into Potter’s ugly shoes and making for the door. “Let’s go already.”
Hermione leaned back, looking up at the ceiling. Her eyes were glassy, but the tears had sunk back in. “You’re right,” she said. “It’s just so hard not to think about. I didn’t talk to them much anyway, only in-between term, but knowing that I
“Dammit, Potter!” Draco said. “I’m asking where
Malfoy nodded again, and Harry felt that was his cue to leave. “Alright, well, goodnight,” he said awkwardly, turning back towards the castle.
Naturally, Camp Buckeye has large, comfortable cabins with
"I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, Potter. We're practically blood enemies at this point. I don't even know why you're still here."
“We’re only a few minutes late,” Harry protested, switching to the banana bread. It had chocolate woven throughout, and was Draco’s favorite. He reached out and snapped a piece off of the end of Potter’s loaf.
“None of the above,” decides Harry. “I think I want to report it. Like, officially.”
“Mmm,” agreed Draco, overwhelmed by how much better Potter was making him feel both with his words and hands.
Mollified, Harry allows Malfoy to continue, though he tenses up as Malfoy firmly wipes his pelvis and works his way down over Harry’s cock and balls. Though Harry still feels trauma about the incident with Asten, he can see eroticism behind this experience with Malfoy. When the blonde finally reaches his pucker, what Harry felt to be his most violated place, he can’t help grunting in pain as the rag touches a wound Asten created. Malfoy sets the rag back in the pail, gently using his hands to spread Harry’s arse. Retrieving his wand, Malfoy whispers what Harry presumes to be healing spells because they aren’t ones he’s heard before. However, they are much milder than those, as they cause the least possible pain in restoring the skin.
For a few minutes, the only sound was of his hook sliding in and out of the yarn and the noises wine made when it swilled around inside the bottle.
The thought caused the tears to form in Draco’s eyes, no matter his resolution of strength. Without another care for the campers he was supposed to be supervising, Draco stood up and snuck behind the adjoining archery shed, where all the gear was kept. Fortunately, he was completely hidden from the campers, the other counselors, and Beans, but anyone coming down the path or chilling by the lake would have a first class view of him.
Draco could only sit on the couch and stare back at her with disbelief. “How?” he croaked. “Why?”
“Actually,” Ron says. “He did. I expected it to be full of eloquent words that didn’t really mean anything, but he just came right out and said it.”
“Next time,” I say, as we walk back down the mountain, hand in hand, “I want to be close enough to see
the blasted thing if we only focus on the research.”
“Draco!” exclaimed a voice. “Blimey, I’ve been looking all over for you.”
“Was he convinced?” Hermione asked.
“No,” he admitted, sitting down at the table. She’d covered his meal with that weird Muggle plastic, and moisture had gathered at the top. Regardless, it was still warm. Draco had the passing thought that she must have put a Warming Charm on it too, but it didn’t matter, really. He dug in. The potatoes were homemade, and the steak was tender and rare, just the way he liked it.
so you can get away with anything.”
Potter wrenched himself out of the embrace, muttering about how Draco was so “impatient” and always “insatiable.” Wondering whether or not he should be offended, Draco was taken aback as a jumper (green and red, because of course) came flying at his head.
“Because I’m not sure if you really want this,” Harry said. He rubbed both of his hands on his face before carding them through his hair. “If you want us, I mean."
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You’re asking me about my feelings?”
“Well, that’s definitely something you should decide in advance. So are you going to, or not?”
Once he’d moved back down to Harry’s nipples, Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s soft hair and twirled the ends around his finger. “You’re beautiful, you know that?” he whispered softly.
They walked to the cabinet side by side, not together, but not separately either. It was an exhilarating feeling, being on the verge of making another friend that wasn’t Harry or Longbottom
you doing?” asked Hermione. She shook her head. “I don’t even want to know. Come on, let’s clean this up…” Taking a tattered cloth from the top of Draco’s clean pile, Hermione sank down to her knees and used the rag to soak up as much Lysol as she could before squeezing it out into Draco’s dirty bucket.
Harry took another long drink of his coffee. “And you’re not going to, are you?”
Harry turned to regard Malfoy skeptically. “Right, then why didn’t you take the out when he offered it? On the night he died.” The
“McGonagall was your Head of House,” said Draco, shrugging. “What do you think our chances are of getting her to agree?”
“Hello, Dragon,” he says calmly.
“Was that talk we had the other day meaningless?” Harry grates. “I thought we could be open and honest with each other now. But don’t worry, Malfoy. It’s fine – leave. Thanks for fucking me over again.” He turns to leave, trying not to condemn himself for throwing a tantrum.
“Is that a trick question?”
Draco carefully continues. “I mean, is this just a one and done for you?” He works hard to keep his anxiety and fear over Potter’s answer out of his voice.
Though his relationship with Potter had been tumultuous, at best, Draco felt a wavering pang of guilt. He walked over to Potter and gently folded him into a reverse hug, nuzzling into the tender skin of Potter’s ear.
Harry says nothing. He hadn’t explicitly told Seamus he wasn’t trying to pull tonight, but he’d thought his friend knew that.
A few minutes later, Potter’s fingers started ghosting over his muscles, and Draco realized that yes, Potter was touching him,
was home. Draco’s arms. Draco’s mouth. Draco’s body. Draco slid his arms around Harry’s back, deepening the kiss, and they stood there together, in the middle of the cold, barren lavender field, in front of the castle, kissing each other as do two lovers who have spent a very long time apart.
Harry laughed, letting Malfoy go as he went to card his fingers through his hair. “Was that supposed to be a joke, Malfoy?”
“Either shut up or fuck off, Zee,” she said with authority. “No one wants to deal with your shit attitude anymore.”
Nate threw back his head and laughed, while Harry chuckled knowingly.

Potter was being oddly quiet, Draco noticed. He wasn’t sure why the mood changed so drastically, but was completely sure that it had happened during Potter’s talk about vacations. He reached out and gently laid his hand over Potter’s, stroking it gently in a way he knew he himself would appreciate. Draco took it as a good sign that Potter didn’t pull away.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“Out with it, Potter,” Draco said, trying not to sound impatient. “You can’t properly enjoy destination number three if there’s something on your mind.”
“I’ll have to send you home with the recipe,” declared Luna, pouring herself a cup.
He slipped into the most casual clothes anyone would ever see him wear, a pair of loose fitting gray slacks and a green shirt, before quickly styling his hair and refreshing his breath.
“Ready?” Draco asked. Maggie nodded. With a real sigh this time, he shouted, “This is a repeat song!”
“Merlin's beard, our futures are really being decided now, aren’t they?”
After the sobs showed no sign of stopping, Harry slowly—cautiously, pulled Malfoy into his lap. He figured that his legs weren't the best pillows, but Malfoy would just have to make do. He slid his hand into Malfoy’s soft white-blonde hair, and stroked, once, twice, and the weeping slowed.
’s upcoming publication, dated Summer 2002. There was a note attached.
“Harry,” Draco mumbled back. “Everything hurts.”
McGonagall pursed her lips. “That’s very decent, Mr. Potter. However, if you might follow me to my office, there were a few matters we should discuss.”
"Why you think I might not be telling the truth?”
. He noticed with satisfaction that Jake wasn’t in the room, so as gracefully as possible he shot out of the bed and found his shirt.
was cast. “Fuck him, and fuck the Commander too.” He chucked a mug at the door, shattering it into a thousand pieces. “Why didn’t we fucking leave for London again?”
“Wake up, Potty!” There was a cackle, and he blearily opened his eyes to be met with the manically insane face of Bellatrix Lestrange. “Oh, yes,” she said reverently, drawing out the word. “My Lord will be incredibly happy to see you.” She reached toward Harry’s throat, fingers twitching as if imagining how he would look gasping for air…
experimenting with a different brew type or a new sort of solution.”
“Malfoy, I feel the same way you do. For me it’s about the journey, not the destination.”
I don’t know why I said that. I’m honestly the biggest fool that’s ever walked the face of this earth. Because why would I give away, to Potter of all people, that I know Potter’s favorite dessert?
“Yeah, well, I thought about what you said, and you’re right, even as daft as you are,” Ron said. “Though you’re right, she would have made a fine date. She would’ve gotten on well with Great Aunt Muriel.”
“Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?” Harry asked conversationally, just as he bumped Draco’s prostate.
Draco twisted his face into what he hoped was a semi-apologetic gaze for a few seconds before he made a break for the door. Good God, he never thought he’d be making the walk of shame not only out of a
The day after Apparating into Yankee Stadium, Harry magically located every single baseball field in the city, hoping to find someone who could teach him the game. He found one better. The New York City Co-ed Fastpitch Baseball Association (CFBA) so happened to be holding its last set of tryouts that very day. He was absolutely, positively lost – but followed directions to a T. Timed runs around the bases? Done. Swinging the much-thinner Beater’s bat at the flying white ball? Cakewalk. The only odd part had been they suited him up with a spare mitt and told him to go field some grounders and fly balls. The grounders made him uneasy, but Harry found that shagging fly balls came to him on the first try, awkward mitt or not. It was quite similar to catching the Snitch; the same mechanics of locating the ball and getting in position applied. Even though there was less flying and more running, Harry’s skillsets transferred easily. He wasn’t the best one at tryouts, but not the worst by far. Good enough, in fact, for him to be picked up by Nate – first baseman and unofficial coach of “Joe Buck Yourself,” the second-best team in the league. He saw that Harry was foreign to baseball but realized his potential. It was the beginning of January, but the team had until March 1 to whip Harry into playing condition.
“Fantastic,” said Harry dryly.
“You and Harry both have a rough road ahead, I’m afraid,” said Mrs. Weasley softly. “But it’s nothing I’m sure you can’t handle. Not after everything else you’ve gone through, and when you were just boys at that.”
Nels gave Nate a huge grin, before slapping the grumpy batter on the helmet and then offering him a hand up. “You might have made it if you weren’t checking out Becky Lou’s ass on the way around third.”
In the picture, they looked broken but together, exhausted yet resolute, and, above all else, filled with a quiet love and respect for one another. It warmed Harry’s heart to see that, somehow, the photographer managed to capture his and Draco’s mutual need for one another even more clearly than if they’d spelled it out.
For once in Harry’s life, he wasn’t annoyed by Malfoy. They joke around with each other, picking ever-so-slightly at old wounds and making fun of them, but that’s all it was in: good fun. Truth be told, Harry enjoyed the banter. They’d always been evenly matched as an opposing pair, but Harry had learned over the last week that they could also synch together rather well. He didn’t want to lose what was building with Malfoy because, in a way, it felt like an actual friendship. The blonde always talked enthusiastically about the grant writing portion of his job, and though Harry wasn’t knowledgeable about the topic, Malfoy managed to make his stories both relatable and interesting, which was a skill Harry always assumed Malfoy didn’t have. He saw how hard Malfoy tried to do good work both with writing and with baseball, and Harry would absolutely be
“Did you
that Harry's leaving would bother him. He’d seen apprehension and misery written all over Draco’s face in the last few days before he left and had chosen to ignore it, telling himself that it would quickly pass.
“Jake,” Draco began; hand still on the door opener. “Didn’t you say you wanted to make pizza? We better get started in the kitchen before those irritating third floor girls come down and hog it all night again baking cookies.”
“No, I very much want to get closer to you, but I don’t think that sex is the way to do that. I thought that would happen after we get to know each other better.”
“There wasn’t time. Don’t tell me, not another-”
“No, I did not,” said Draco, settling back into conversation that always came easy with Jake. “You’ll have to tell me where you found that source…”
Ron disguised his snigger with a muffled cough. “You’re sure you’re alright, mate? I think you’re going to need more than a good cup of coffee to function today.”
“Rubbish,” mutters Ron darkly.
“Er, hang on,” Harry said, clambering next to him and quickly scanning the rest of the text. He’d gotten lost in thought, too caught up in his emotions after seeing the title. There were other buzzwords and catchphrases on the cover, such as:
“Come on now, Potter,” he chided. “I can have a bit of fun now and again.”
How his empty hole gaped and clenched at nothingness seemed a poignant metaphor for his life.
It takes a minute to adjust to the dim lighting and the confusion created by gyrating bodies, but Harry starts feeling a little more comfortable after he and Seamus grab a table and start watching the sea of dancers.
“No trouble at all,” said Malfoy. “It was wonderful to see you again, Cecelia.”
“So why are you telling me about it now?”
“I think I can see why,” said Draco dryly, flinging himself upon the floor with abandon, facing his back to the wall. “She’s got me rooming with fucking Finnigan. As if I didn’t need
Harry smiled. “This is Charlie,” he said, throwing his arms around the dragon tamer. “Charlie, meet Draco,” he continued, ushering Draco closer.
For his part, Malfoy doesn’t bat an eye and strutted gracefully out of the room. “Oi, wait!” shouted Harry after him. “You might want to change before we go. Here, I brought you some gear.” He pulled out baseball pants, a long pair of blue baseball socks, a jersey, and a very dirty, worn pair of cleats.
“But did you?” Harry asked, hating himself for revealing so much vulnerability.
and a request for Molly to send you a Howler.”
“You’re starting to sound more and more like a reasonable human being,” Zee said in that blasé tone of his, and Harry increasingly wanted to thump him and Malfoy both.
Figuring that he was invited to sit down as well, Draco cautiously perched on a mostly-clean armchair not far away from the fireplace. “Speaking of Harry, is he here?”
The one thing they didn’t talk about in their letters was their relationship. Draco didn’t know if they were friends or lovers, but he did know that he loved Harry. He suspected—hoped—that Harry loved him too, though it was never confirmed on either side. Neither one of them wanted to veer into dangerous territory again, especially because their initial problems weren’t anywhere close to being resolved. Harry was still working with the American Aurors, and Draco was still going to school in France. He had just over two and a half years left on his program. Even if they officially got back together, nothing about their living situation would change.
“I did miss you too though,” Draco admitted.
Harry was exhausted. He had sponged up all the information in the texts, and was in the process of committing the last one,
“Seriously, Malfoy,” says Ron, exasperated. “I am not reading between the lines. What’s happened and how can I help my best friend?”
Draco paused for breath.
“I was surprised that you knew as much as you did. Most people have never heard of the Obfuscation Elixir.”
That was apparently all the encouragement Harry needed. He positioned himself directly over Draco, leaning down to suck a love bite into his collarbone, before taking Draco’s cock with his still-slick hand and gently stroking it. As Harry rubbed exactly the right spot, Draco deeply inhaled – and felt Harry’s cock sliding into him.
She was pulled out of her musings by Draco shouting from the kitchen, “Can you bring the fresh Lysol from under the sink?” There was definitely a slight undertone of panic to his voice. For that reason, and that reason alone, Hermione retrieved the Lysol quickly and wandered back out to the kitchen. She was greeted with a strong, lemony scent and an enormous neon yellow puddle in the middle of the floor, which Draco was frantically trying to wipe up.
hole that he was, wouldn’t drive her to drink, but just look at her now. Taking a deep breath, she delicately picked up her cup. It was warranted, with him coming out here and all; because of the stressfulness of the situation. And with that thought in mind, she forgave herself.
“Wonderful,” Draco said, already trying hard to remember their names. “Honestly, I might have to have you lot wear nametags.”
And not only was Harry more relaxed, he took easily to giving anyone who accused him of not working hard enough a vicious tongue-lashing. The audacity of the masses never failed to amaze Draco. He’d witnessed professors come up to Harry and ask him to take on special projects over his lunch break only to walk away disgruntled and put off after Harry said no. Some of the lazier students would leave the hardest tasks for Harry, knowing his tendency to pick up the slack left by those who either couldn’t or wouldn’t do the work. On more than one occasion, Draco had to refrain from talking Harry into lowering his absurdly-large workload. Though the man wasn’t going out of his way to take on new projects didn’t mean he wasn’t already pushing himself to the extent of his ability.
Draco regretfully watched Potter stride away, eyes lingering unwillingly on Potter’s bum, and immediately cut off that train of thought. He was only just getting to be Potter’s friend, for Merlin's sake. Anything more was unthinkable. He didn't deny himself the pleasure though of remembering Potter's touch...it almost felt loving. But Draco couldn’t afford to delude himself. He and Potter were friends, nothing more. Tomorrow’s community service hours would be a lot more tolerable with Potter, and, as an added bonus, a lot safer.
“Only if you call me Draco,” Malfoy murmurs, “Because that’s mine.”
“Nasty, plebian habit,” remarked Draco, opening the case file and squeezing in on the couch next to Harry. “Budge up if you actually want to read the file.”

My rock is the only safe place to sit on the dirty, dusty ground, and so Potter squeezes next to me in an effort to not dirty up his pants.
With his half-awake team glaring up at him, Nate finally got to the point. He opened up a folder, and true to his word, pulled out a stack of handouts which he passed to Zee to distribute.
With a sob, Draco threw himself back onto the bed, sending out manic brain waves of
“Was it good for you, Draco?” Potter asks as he lays down on one of the pillows and gestures for Draco to join him.
Harry couldn’t imagine living in California forever. It was just too different from what he imagined as his ideal life; Draco wasn’t in it, for one. But he knew that in his heart, even if Draco chose not to be with him anymore, he belonged back in Britain. The thought took him back to the merciless onslaught of anxiety he had over the reality that he didn’t know what Draco’s decision was. Unable to quell the thoughts or stand them any longer, Harry pulled himself off of the floor and got himself a beer too. Cracking it open, he walked outside and sat down on the porch next to Ron, who was looking out at the ocean.
“Yes, you can drink,” smirks Seamus.
“I want to,” Harry says stubbornly. “Get some sleep and don’t bother waking up early tomorrow. I’ll send you over the paperwork by noon.”
Malfoy reaches over, but his sleeve accidentally snags the cheese grater, causing his hand to bump the vinaigrette and knock it over. Before he can quite register what he’s doing, the salad dressing is zooming back into the jar, his magic neatly eviscerating any spills or stains. He’s broken his pledge not to use magic, and wandlessly at that.
, and I –”
Harry and Ron break the law, despite Hermione's disapproval.
He turned around and enfolded her in a hug. “That was backhanded,” Draco said as they embraced, shoving her bushy hair away from his face. “Thank you, though.”
“Allow me,” he said, and Conjured two wine glasses. “We’re here together selling wine, okay?” With that, he Transfigured the potion flask into a regal wine bottle. For good measure, he cast an illusion on one of the potted plants to appear as an official-looking wine cart.
“Wake up out there!” Nate shouts, waving the bat around impatiently. “Second base, get into position and stop gabbing like schoolchildren!
“I said that because I’m afraid we’ll slip back into old habits,” said Harry. “They die hard, or so I’m told.”
Malfoy doesn’t hesitate. Avoiding formalities, he slashes his wand through the air in a serious of swirls and flicks, sending a volley of Dark hexes and curses at Asten, who just barely manages to escape unscathed.
His cock was definitely straining now against his Muggle jeans, and Draco prayed Potter didn’t notice how affected his body was. “That’s why you should accept my offer, Potter. You can put everything back into perspective after you’ve seen some more of the world.”
“I did,” Draco said, in as noncommittal a voice as Harry had ever heard him use. “He looks nothing like Potter.”

“You’re so sweet when we’re like this,” Harry said endearingly.

“Let’s find you some more food.” Stepping out of bed, Harry shivered as he snagged his robe off of the hook and padded out to the kitchen. After a look into the owl’s bowl and seeing that it was still full from last night, he frowned. “What do you want, then? I know Draco treats you well. Go on, get home.”
Over the past few years, Draco had read anything he could get his hand on, including Muggle literature. He was definitely choosing to go as Romeo (and, by extension, Juliet) had, with poison. An enhanced Draught of Living Death should be enough to do the trick.
“I can’t answer that for you, Draco,” said ‘Dromeda wistfully. “Heaven knows if I could, your life would have turned out a lot differently.”
“Stuff it, Malfoy,” Weasley said, but his heart wasn’t in it. “I can’t excuse his sleeping around, but I can tell you that’s all it was. He didn’t bring her home. He didn’t go out on dates with her. They were basically shagging in-between all-nighters and double shifts when we were interns. For what it’s worth, I think he did it for a stress reliever. Not only was he dealing with the hell the Americans put us through, but you were also putting him through hell with your silence.”
“Yeah, so?”
Draco said nothing but gave himself permission to embrace Nate. He recognized the victory here; could see it, smell it, and especially taste it. Zee was still pressed up against the fence, a sour look on his face. Spiting him, and in turn, recognizing his own talent, gave Draco greater satisfaction than any of the times he’d bested Potter back at Hogwarts.
Neither team scored in the first three innings, and in the bottom of the fourth Harry was up to bat again, Nate having placed him second in the batting order. The rational for that was because he could bunt well, place good base hits, and watch anything that wasn’t in his strike zone. He’d hit the ball in his first at bat, but was thrown out at first by a particularly determined third baseman. This time, there was a runner on second with no outs, and Nate gave him the signal from down the third base line to bunt.
