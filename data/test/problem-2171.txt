“What?” Draco started slightly, then refocused on Harry. “No – sorry, I didn’t mean to ramble on like that.” He tucked a few stray locks of hair behind his ear. “Why did you call?”
Harry was making soothing noises, smoothing his hands over Draco’s shoulders, trying to gather Draco into his arms. But Draco was too far gone. All his defenses were shredded, his soul cut open, and everything was too raw, too exposed. Harry’s touch bit into him like a knife, painful as salt in an already devastating wound.
It did make it rather difficult to sleep though. Draco set his tea down on the windowsill and scrubbed a hand over his tired eyes. Perhaps he should have agreed to spend the night at the cottage when Harry had asked.
Malfoy tugged down his sleeve where it had been riding up, then left his hand there, tightly gripping his wrist.
“I don’t mind answering,” he said, well aware that knowledge was the best apology he could offer her. “I am still physically capable of performing magic. There is a stipulation in the terms, that allows me to cast spells in emergency or life-threatening situations.” He paused and smiled wryly. “Though my actions in such an event would be subject to a rigorous review.”
like your favorite dessert.” Draco groaned, tugging at his hair and staring helplessly at Harry. “I didn’t even realize what I was doing!” he ranted. “Not until the tea blend was already finished. It was mortifying!”
After a beat of panicked indecision, Draco steeled himself and walked back to the table. He sat, then braced his arms against the table and leaned toward Harry. “I spent my entire childhood serving a regime that took away people’s choices, that destroyed their livelihoods, and that’s when it wasn’t summarily executing them for the crime of
Harry scrubbed a tired hand across his brow, but his resistance was flagging. He had never been good at fighting the inevitable leap into action. He looked up at Draco and grinned. “Right. Ok. This is probably a terrible idea! But I’m in. Let’s do it.”
“Malfoy, I swear. It was just like last time. I felt something –” Harry grasped at his chest – “here. And then everything went dark and squished. Like apparition.”
Draco obligingly settled on the edge of the bed, expression still pinched with worry. Harry closed his eyes and wasting no time butting his magic gently against Draco’s.
“So what do we do now?” Harry asked. “How do we figure out what kind of magic feels like frozen hooks?”
Malfoy had hesitantly approached Neville only a few hours into the first class. Harry couldn’t quite hear what he said, but it seemed like he was asking Neville a question.
Malfoy seemed taken aback by this. He quirked an eyebrow suspiciously, but when Harry said nothing, Malfoy continued on his way, eyes fixed once more on the wall. He was moving quickly now, and Harry scrambled to follow. He pushed his way past a few students straggling to their next class, trying to ignore their stares.
Draco frowned, but then he hooked his ankle around Harry’s and leaned forward. “Alright, go on. What did happen?”
“No.” Draco sighed heavily. “The Malfoy name is tainted. I did not wish the children to be exposed to the negative press that would have inevitably followed.”
“What are you up to today?” Maeve asked, poking her head around the doorframe of Draco’s workshop. Bright pink earrings shaped like Pygmy Puffs dangled almost all the way to her collar.
Trees stretched into an endless sky. No matter the time of day, they could look up into the deep, inky blues of midnight and see the comforting radiance of hundreds of stars.
Outside, the pavement was wet, glistening slickly in the glow of the streetlamps. Though striking, the sight was a poor substitute for the starlight Draco had grown up gazing at from the windows of the Manor. In London, the city lights dulled the heavens, chasing the magic from the blue-black sky.
Harry twisted to face him. The room was dim, but Draco was bathed in the glow of the little reading lamp on the table by the far window. He was curled into the armchair, an open book on his lap. Moonlight glinted silver in his hair, even as the lamplight warmed his skin. Harry thought he had never looked so beautiful.
It was just past seven in the morning now, far too early, really, to call unannounced. Harry hesitated a minute longer, worried that dragging Draco out of bed would not be the best beginning for an apology.
Harry huffed out a short laugh, pained and disbelieving. He scrubbed a hand over his face, knocking his glasses askew. “It’s ok, you can say it.”
“I didn’t find you!” Harry said in a rush. He paused and rubbed his neck awkwardly. “I mean - er, obviously, I did. But I didn’t think you’d be here. I looked everywhere else. I think I came here to give up, actually.” He cringed and looked away. “Sorry.”
Still naked, skin gleaming against the smoky grey sheets of the bed, Draco had never looked more beautiful. Sunlight filtered in, bathing him in the amber tones of day, but the silver colors of night had likewise claimed him.
“My – my father –” Draco hesitated. He reached for one of their discarded teacups and took a small sip of the cold dregs. His hand shook slightly when he set the cup down. “He did not say anything relevant.”
Malfoy was an impressive opponent – the best, by far, of anyone Harry had fought in last week’s eighth year defense workshop, equal even, to the adult wizards Harry had fought in the past.
Draco rolled his eyes, but he was still smiling. “Nonsense, Potter. It was hardly a scratch. The tea is more important.”
until the icy cold shock flared up again, and Harry lost his grip. He felt the hooks rip and tear and shred through the magic of the flowers.
Harry perked up at that. “Yeah,” he said, his sudden grin practically blinding. “Sounds good.” He wiped his hands on a dish cloth and grabbed a jar of Floo powder to offer to Draco.
“Not even Maeve cooks like this,” Draco said in tones of awe. Then his eyes flew wide. “Do not tell her I said that,” he pleaded. “She would be the first to admit she prioritizes sweet over savory, but –” Draco shrugged, smiling ruefully.
Harry and Malfoy raced each other across the Pitch – diving and circling, darting in to cut each other off. Even when it became apparent that it was far too dark to actually capture the snitch, their fierce competition raged on.
“It wasn’t her fault,” Harry said. “I was talking to her about your magic and I got really worked up about how unfair it was that the Ministry took your money too, when you didn’t deserve
Hermione was still chattering away, none the wiser. “– should set up a few trials. We can experiment with different locations, see if it makes a difference if you’re apparating to each other or away from each other, and then –”
McGonagall clucked her tongue apologetically and pushed a biscuit tin toward him. The biscuits were loaded with chocolate and Harry groaned appreciatively. He grabbed a handful and passed the tin over to Draco.
It made Harry feel safe in a way he hadn’t felt for a long time, and he could not have been more grateful.
Harry shook his head at Malfoy, but he couldn’t help being amused, especially when he thought back to the first time he’d flown. Funny that he’d never really acknowledged Malfoy’s role in the joy of that day. As he swooped upward, robes flapping behind him in the wind, he had felt in control of something for the first time in his life. And with it had come a rush of freedom that he’d never quite forgotten.
Harry again got the sense that Malfoy was offering him something, just like Harry had thought that first night they had sat by the lake.
Hermione rubbed his back soothingly, but Harry could swear he felt her amusement through her fingers. Her voice was warm when she said, “I’m glad you’re finally figuring it out.”
Harry broke the kiss then, smiling softly down at Draco. Draco rested his head against Harry’s chest, idly counting Harry’s heartbeats as Harry held him close.
Draco made a faint, distressed noise, and Harry immediately started to protest, but McGonagall just held up a hand.
There had been that one moment though, when Harry’s Knee-knocker Jinx had gone wide, and Malfoy had hastily thrown up a Shield Charm in front of the passing Hannah Abbot and Justin Finch-Fletchley. Justin scowled in Harry’s direction before the two scurried off.
Harry fumbled a bit with the bandages before managing to get the gauze positioned correctly. He half expected a sneer or a haughty lecture about proper bandaging technique, but Draco was still and silent as he waited for Harry to wrap the wound.
Harry’s green eyes sparkled, reflecting the light of Draco’s floating, conjured orbs. And in that moment, Draco made his decision.
Jaw clenched, Harry settled into the rhythms of his intangible game of catch and continued raking through his memories. He was desperate to dig up something, anything, some clue, from when McGonagall’s use of the Death Eater wands had unleashed more of the hooked residue.
Feeling uneasy, Harry darted a look at Draco, only to find that his eyes were glazed over and distant. He was rubbing a thumb across his bottom lip absently and mumbling something unintelligible. Harry caught the words
“You look – nice,” he offered, and it sounded as though he meant it. He scratched absently at one of his wrists and gave Draco an encouraging smile. “Are you going somewhere?”
“Oh,” Harry whispered, voice embarrassingly faint. “Never mind then.” He was no longer even remotely hungry, but he ate another forkful anyway, just for something to do.
He looked at her and then away, biting his lip. She waited patiently and made no move to pressure him.
Ron looked at Harry like he was being purposely dense. “Maybe because you spend every night with him? We haven’t seen you after dinner in weeks.”
Harry pressed a palm over his heart, overwhelmed by the wellspring of hope McGonagall’s words had inspired.
The bedroom was almost as appealing as Malfoy himself. Harry imagined what it would be like to wake up here in the mornings – how good it would feel to roll over slowly and gaze across the room at Malfoy, already up, poking and prodding at his vast array of cauldrons, his skin aglow in the morning light.
“I’m not allowed to do magic,” Draco blurted. All at once, the words poured from him, spilling from his mouth to skitter about the room, running every which way like beetles he couldn’t catch in time to squash. “For seven years. In punishment for my actions during the war. A probation, of sorts. Which I fully deserve. And accept. I just – find it hard to speak about. As I said before. That’s why I –” he gulped – “well, you remember.”
been rather grim this week. Hushed conversations, tears suppressed or quickly concealed, people gazing listlessly out windows. And they all seemed so
“This is Harry’s magical energy,” Maeve said, gesturing toward the green dome of light around him. Then she waved her hand over the opposite dome of ice blue. “And this is Draco’s.”
–” Draco started indignantly, but quickly realized how foolish that sounded. “I mean, he’s not the one who – and he is not my –
McGonagall gave him a long, appraising look. “That’s very interesting, Mr. Potter,” she said. She stood and began ushering them out. “You might consider becoming a Hogwarts teaching fellow next year. An innovative curriculum proposal is part of the application.”
Suddenly, there came an unpleasant sucking sensation, as if the images trapped beneath their skin were being vacuumed out. A strange fog enveloped them, swirling with the same blues that had colored their bodies. When it dissipated, they were both back to normal.
The flowers covered only the door; surrounding it, the vines and petals were swallowed by the wall. It was as if the stones of Hogwarts had absorbed the flowers, transforming them effortlessly into the subtle design he and Malfoy had followed.
“It was in the Forbidden Forest!” Harry blurted. He couldn’t bear the tinge of fear in Draco’s voice. “I made sure I couldn’t hit anyone!”
As the spell built in Draco’s core, Harry tracked it, already knitting his protective magics through and around it. By the time Draco spoke the incantation, his magic was as safe and snug as a baby bird cradled in Harry’s palm.
“I can’t really explain it, but it was the only letter that didn’t feel – slimy,” Harry said. “It wasn’t aggressive or like, worshipping or whatever. It felt – genuine, like they’d be open to other ideas, like they’d work with me to develop something good for the kids and me both.”
Andie flipped another page. “It says here that powdered sea turtle shell is used in de-toe – no, er – tox-uh-fy – de-tox-ifying potions. You need three average-sized turtle shells to have enough powder for one dose. Did you know that?”
But then again, it all made sense, didn’t it? They were back in a place where terrible, violent things had happened. They were all shadowed by trauma. They were all working through their grief.
Dressed in running shorts despite the winter chill, Harry was bouncing on his toes while carefully teasing the ropes apart. Draco’s eyes trailed up Harry’s legs as his calf muscles worked, mesmerized as ever by the power of Harry’s body. It was a tireless energy, thrumming beneath Harry’s skin, and Draco loved to watch it, loved to see his chaotic Gryffindor so intently focused on one thing.
Harry had come back to school this year thinking Hogwarts would be a refuge, a place where – for the most part, at least – he wouldn’t have to deal with living up to the “war hero” image the public expected. But visiting professors meant that Harry started every week tense, unsure if this teacher would be the one to fawn over him or get flustered or request an autograph.
“I suppose not,” Hermione sighed. “I just worry about him. He’s been so purposeless since the war. Lost.”
“Thank you,” Draco said. He leaned back against the sofa again, spreading his legs until his thigh pressed into Harry’s. A spark jolted between them. “I’ll think about it.”
“I wasn’t having a great day,” Harry explained. “Seeing you made me feel better for a second, and all of a sudden I just really wanted some company. And I was curious about you, I guess.”
Draco sagged at that, surprisingly hurt. He tried to school his features, but Harry must have noticed, because he said hurriedly, “Well, yes, the food, obviously. You’re an insanely good cook.”
“Did you meet someone?” Draco asked curiously, his mouth curling into a smile. Mr. Zobinski was a strange man, and something of a loner, but Draco genuinely liked him. It would be lovely to know that he had found someone to make him happy.
“I forgot where I was. And Lavender, she had been apparating all over, keeping me off balance, and right then she apparated onto the tree limb above me. I heard the crack, and I was so relieved. I looked up, expecting to see you.” Harry opened his eyes, tilting his head toward Draco with a chagrined smile. “But it wasn’t you, and I felt – lost.”
“Good,” Harry breathed, the word sounding a bit mangled. He cleared his throat. “It might be better not to send Luna’s, though. I’m not sure how she found out I was collecting testimonials for you, but whatever she wrote, it’s probably – bizarre.”
Draco closed his eyes, savoring the smell of the chocolate before taking a long swallow of his own. “Thank you,” he murmured. “This is rather decadent when you’re accustomed to tea.”
“Of course,” Draco said, voice a hoarse rasp. He flexed his fingers, fighting off the jolt of pain that had flashed through him at the request.
“The autumn shortbread, please,” he said, and Maeve had gone hunting for the candied orange peel without another word.
Potter cut off abruptly and raised a hand to Draco’s cheek, fingers trailing lightly along the bone. “Your eye –”
He scrunched his nose as silken strands of hair tickled it, and tried to ward off a sneeze. Blinking himself more fully awake, he found Draco nestled in his arms. Harry lifted his head from where it had been tucked against the back of Draco’s neck and shielded his eyes from the sudden onslaught of sunlight.
Maeve must have been remembering that day too, because all at once, the fight went out of her. She clucked her tongue and wrapped an arm around Draco. He melted into her, head resting on her shoulder.
“How did you –” Harry trailed off, not quite wanting to admit to it. He was thrown by how easily Malfoy had seen through him. But then, maybe Malfoy didn’t like sleeping alone either. Maybe Malfoy had nightmares too.
Harry was surprised by the simple honesty of the remark. A younger Malfoy would have been petulant and resentful, but the man in front of him sounded so genuine and so wistful, that Harry spoke before he could think better of it. “We can still fly. We should have a seeker game sometime, you and me.”
“Blaise has a good heart,” Draco offered tentatively. “He will treat her well. I don’t know if that helps at all, but –”
Blaise inhaled the fragrant steam. “Delightful,” he declared, pouring himself a large cup. “So what business did Harry Potter have at the illustrious Novelle Teas?”
It was a relatively small space, painted a vibrant turquoise. White shelves were scattered erratically over the walls, cluttered with decorative teapots and vases. Each was filled to bursting with bright pink and orange flowers. Clustered around the room were numerous small wooden tables and cozy looking armchairs. It should have been overwhelming, but there was something about the place that put Harry immediately at ease.
jittery throughout the morning, but that was only to be expected after the ordeal he’d had, and eventually, he settled enough that Harry felt able to broach the subject of Azkaban.
Harry chuckled softly. “No, you’re right. She’d just smile at them vaguely and say the nargles were confusing them.”
“What happened?” Luna asked. Her face was drawn and her cheeks hollow, but Harry was relieved to see that her eyes still had their usual cheerful intensity. Even the flowers paled beside Luna’s ineffable spirit.
Draco drew in a stuttering breath and released it slowly, curling into Harry and resting his head against his chest.
“I thought I was being selfish,” Draco said, “but if you feel that way too –” he ducked his head, but didn’t quite manage to hide the way his face softened - “ well, you’re the least selfish person I know.”
Harry felt as though he were seeing him clearly for the first time. He knew this look, had witnessed it often enough around Hermione, though on her it had been less… fiery, somehow. Malfoy looked almost fevered as his eyes danced over the flower. But even still, Harry recognized someone in the throes of complete intellectual absorption. This flower was an academic problem, an anomaly of some kind (probably the whole bloody garden was), and Malfoy intended to solve it.
And Harry lost it, every last tenuous inch of control. He’d been on edge since they started, and he’d kept such a tight grip on himself that he’d trapped his magic just as surely as he had his balls.
Draco shoved his chair back, almost toppling over. He sprang to his feet and caught the chair before it could fall.
Every so often, doors would slam shut while others flew open, the house guiding them through its maze, forcing them to confront strange amalgamations of past horrors. And the lights, always the lights, flowing ahead of them, turning each scene circus-like, a garish and dizzying tumult.
“I had dinner at his flat one night – he’s a crazy good cook –” McGonagall raised an eyebrow and Harry felt the back of his neck heat. He hurried on – “and I found a letter.”
But what could that thing possibly be? And why was Blaise being so reticent? It wasn’t like him to hesitate. Blaise approached problems the way he moved through crowds, breezing past with a charming smile and a few well-placed nudges of his broad shoulders.
Harry thought for a minute, pointedly ignoring the smug smirk of the teenager sitting in the grass nearby, flipping through a comic. Declan Sotheby had dark hair, cropped severely close to his head, and though he towered over Harry, he was probably only about fifteen. Cynthia had introduced them earlier, suggesting that Declan tag along as Harry’s assistant. Declan hadn’t argued, but he also hadn’t lifted a finger to help.
Struggling to control his breathing, Harry edged around the hospital beds, wanting to consult with the Healer.
Harry was horrified, but McGonagall had silenced his protests. She gave Draco a long, appraising look, before calmly asking him to explain. Draco’s response had been immediate and unemotional, delivered in that posh tone he still fell into when arguing a point. He claimed that by visiting his father, he would be in a unique position to possibly uncover vital information.
Draco was almost sure, shocking in its intensity. And Draco crumbled in the face of it, a little boy fleeing the jaws of a wolf he had presumed it safe to tease.
It was alright back in her fifth year, when Harry had been so sure Malfoy was up to something. Ginny and Harry were just getting together then, and she’d been able to accept the fixation easily enough. The fight against Voldemort had been so uncertain, the future so vague, that she did not begrudge Harry the comfort of a straightforward enemy. He needed something to fight, someone to blame, and there was Draco Malfoy, (un)happy to oblige. The hate between the two of them had been a safety net for Harry. Familiar and predictable. So when Harry brought his name into bed, angry and righteous, Ginny had bitten her tongue.
“Yes, well –” he wiped the excess dough from his hands before accepting the ginger and sprinkling some into the bowl – “he always did like treacle.”
Draco sipped nonchalantly from his mug. “I suppose he wanted a cup of tea. I assume even boy heroes get thirsty every now and then.”
When they’d first emerged from Draco’s workshop, Maeve had asked him to choose anything he would like to bake.
He supposed it could be a trick – the colors and scent luring the victim close. But that didn’t feel right to Harry. He had always had an uncanny ability to sense deceit and falseness. It was why he’d been able to resist the Imperius Curse – something about the preternatural calm of it pricked at his suspicions. These flowers however, could not be more different; Harry didn’t get any warning bells from them at all.
Draco led Harry inside. “Make yourself comfortable. I just need to change, and then I’ll start your potion.”
When Harry finally emerged, wearing a bright red muscle tee that exposed his sculpted shoulders, Draco very nearly swooned. His hair was damp, a wild tangle against flushed cheeks, and he was glowing with happiness, eyes fixed on Draco as he jostled past the crowd.
There was a loud crash as Draco dumped the silverware onto the table. Harry wasn’t sure if he’d been intending to disrupt the argument, but if so, it was an incredibly effective move. Almost as one, the others’ heads snapped to the doorway, a sudden silence descending as they caught sight of Harry and Draco.
There were quiet footsteps and the sound of the drawer opening and closing. Harry peered surreptitiously through his fingers and saw Draco place the bottle of lube on the bed.
There was an intensity to him, a razor-sharp edge beneath those flexing muscles and sweat-slicked skin. Harry was entirely focused, entirely alive, as if all the scraps and remnants of his soul were pouring out of him in waves, as if every tiny piece of him was being woven together and channeled into this one fight.
“You’re using bread,” Harry observed. “That’s not a potions ingredient. And you have a frying pan instead of a cauldron!”
Draco made a keening noise in his throat, arching into Harry’s touch. “Seven or eight, I think,” he said drowsily.
Draco pushed himself up on his elbows and looked at Harry sheepishly. Embarrassment warred with the want in his eyes.
Draco startled, as if he’d already forgotten Harry’s presence. His good hand had been sifting through the herbs and flowers. “No,” Draco said with a wry twist of his mouth. “No – just a bit inconvenient, really.” He looked glumly between his hand and the mess on the table and sighed.
“Boyfriend?” Draco echoed, his voice vulnerable rather than scandalized this time. His eyes were wide, the irises flat grey pools, all traces of mirth forgotten.
And when they came, it was bright as a bonfire, sparks crackling to life along every inch of their skin. Still glowing, Draco collapsed atop Harry. He was more beautiful than ever, and in his eyes, Harry could swear he saw stars.
“I want to know more about your life,” Draco confessed. “The spells you invented, how you learned it all.” He averted his eyes. In a quiet voice, he added, “I can’t believe I never asked.”
Harry’s stomach dropped, but the fear only lasted a second. Studying Draco, Harry could somehow tell that his focus had turned inward. That fire was not for Harry; it was for Draco himself.
Over eggs and sausages, he assured Draco that there had been no change in Luna, Neville, Hannah, or Blaise. Madam Pomphrey and Healer Tahlyn were closely monitoring their magical cores and were confident that all four patients would remain stable.
“A three-way fire-call violates every principle of magical theory I have ever studied,” Draco said seriously. “And yet, I am quite certain she could.”
“It is now time to overcome the wounds that run deeper,” McGonagall said. She turned to focus on Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, Voldemort is dead and of no further threat to you or your mother. You no longer need to conceal the good you attempt. If you intend to research these flowers and find a solution to the situation we find ourselves in, there is not a single person at Hogwarts that will stand in your way. Do I make myself clear?”
Draco frowned and shook his head. “No. We’re doing this now,” he said adamantly, leaving no room for argument.
Cheeks still a bright scarlet, he shifted his weight toward Harry and met his eyes. “You’re very handsome, Potter.”
Draco folded his hands into his lap. Out on the mat, the fight seemed to be wrapping up. The larger fighter’s movements were slowing; he was increasingly on the defensive, unable to make his own attacks.
He hit the ground this time, knees stinging where they collided with the paving stones. Before he could push himself upright, a wave of dizziness overtook him. Harry clapped a hand to his forehead and gasped in a breath. The air in front of him was thick and unpleasant, pushing against him like an invisible wall. He stood hesitantly and took a careful step forward. There was nothing in front of him, nothing to physically impede his progress at all, but with every step his discomfort grew. His t-shirt clung to the sweat that dampened his body, and a peculiar hollow feeling began to spread through his chest. Panting harshly, Harry clutched at his ribs, trying to understand the
After one steadying breath, Draco extended his forearms to Harry, baring that vulnerable white skin for the first time.
Harry laughed and kissed him on the cheek. Looking somewhat mollified, Draco pulled on his pants and followed Harry down the ladder. Harry had almost reached the door when Draco called after him.
At the time, those words had slipped quietly inside Draco’s skin, heating his whole body with the allure of possibility. But even that had been much easier to dismiss than the expression on Harry’s face yesterday, when he pressed his foot to Draco’s after they’d spoken of the darkness in their dreams.
Harry sucked in a startled breath and then choked on it. Luna patted him on the back while he coughed, a bit pathetically, into the sleeve of his jumper.
Harry almost fell over, but he recovered himself and stood, immediately backing away to give Draco space.
When Draco ran a thumb over his left forearm, Harry recognized the gesture, though he had only ever seen him do it clothed. He wasn’t worrying at the Dark Mark, as Harry had always thought; he was tracing the line of the scar. His eyes were hollow, and Harry’s heart broke when he understood the shame that was hidden there.
Draco smiled grimly, fingertips brushing against Harry’s. “It’s because I was a Death Eater, Potter.”
It was becoming increasingly clear that Harry Potter’s obsession with Draco Malfoy was a lifelong condition, not a symptom of any specific circumstance.
Draco’s hands clenched around Harry’s arm in a flash of panic. Dropping the matches, Harry rubbed a soothing hand over Draco’s stomach and pressed kisses lightly along his temple.
Padma rolled her eyes at him, but smiled almost fondly before moving toward Hermione. Harry looked around for Ron and saw that he had partnered with Neville.
Harry had groaned, re-tethered his magic, and dug around the mess at the bottom of the wardrobe until he found his trainers. He shoved them on impatiently and left to find Draco, space be damned. Draco could have all the space he wanted, as long as Harry could sit across the room.
He had thought yesterday at the Weasleys had gone rather well, for both himself and for Blaise. Mr. Weasley’s energy was a tad alarming, of course, and there had been that odd argument between Ginny and George… but everyone had been far kinder than Draco had expected. Blaise had gotten on well with everyone too, joking around with Weasley
Draco’s breath quickened, almost imperceptibly, but when he spoke, his voice was calm. “No, I don’t think so. Life debts do not function like this.” He waved a hand between himself and Harry. “And usually, they have to be formally invoked by one of the two parties.”
It didn’t take Draco long to brew the tea, and soon they were sitting together at the table nearest the fire, sipping mugs of delicious, emerald green
Harry’s rhythm faltered and he rutted against the bed, losing control of himself for a moment as his magic spilled free. It twined around Draco, and suddenly Harry was awash in memory, overwhelmed by how joined the two of them had been only a few hours before. He moved his hand to Draco’s balls, squeezing them gently before running a finger down Draco’s crease.
Draco picked up the testimonials and fingered the rough edges of the parchment, then hesitantly flipped through them. Some of the names were to be expected – Maeve, Blaise, Harry, of course, and three Hogwarts professors – but others surprised him. Several of Novelle’s regular customers, Luna Lovegood, even a few from younger Hogwarts students.
“Are you quite certain? It’s happening more and more frequently from what I’ve heard. Even Luna says she’s been having trouble with the most basic magical creature spells.”
By the time he finished the water, Draco had managed to calm himself. He lay back down, rolling onto his side to face Harry.
Malfoy was there in an instant. He steadied Harry with a hand on his shoulder and helped him to sit on the bench behind them. It was the same bench they had shared their first night back at Hogwarts.
His fingers had found the edge of a deep groove that cut across Draco’s chest and wrapped around the left side of his ribs.
When Harry reclaimed his magic, it danced back to him, lighting up his blood with an unexpected sparkle. And all Harry could do was laugh.
He shook his head, voice becoming desperate, as if he could will Harry to understand. “Why should I have choices now? What right do I have to pursue dreams, when I helped take that away from so many others?”
the magic that’s coming at me, or that’s been left as a trap, if I can understand it, I’ll be able to do the right thing, the most effective block or hex or counter-curse. And then maybe I can disable attackers without deadly force.”
Harry didn’t know whether to be encouraged or discouraged by that. He floundered for a moment, then shut the door. “Why
“You may be discovering a more effective way to channel the defensive magic,” Draco mused. His eyes were distant, but there was a spark of excitement in his voice. “The way you position your body is important for kickboxing, correct?”
Harry flopped down onto the grass with a sigh, letting the anger whisk away like smoke. “Yeah, me too. Remus’ son, my godson, he’s only a baby, and he’ll never know his father. I was thinking about all the stories I want to tell him someday, and I was thinking about how much it would have meant to me, if someone had told me stories like that. It made me wonder if things would have been different, if I had grown up feeling loved.” Harry cringed then, wondering what had possessed him to admit that to Draco Malfoy, of all people. Harry felt raw, sure that whatever Malfoy said, it wouldn’t be enough to quell Harry’s shame.
Draco shouted, and his cock pulsed into Harry’s mouth. Harry sucked gently until Draco went soft, then looked up at him. Draco’s eyes were closed, a blissed out smile on his face. He slid his fingers into Harry’s mop of hair and caressed his head tenderly.
“Fine,” Harry groaned, already regretting it. He selected a candy of pale gold and popped it into his mouth before he could change his mind. Ron swallowed his in the same moment.
“Well, as we discussed, the apparition bond between you seems to function based on need,” Hermione reminded him. “And where did you save Draco’s life, Harry?”
“That’s why I told George,” Ginny said, as she returned to the table. She rested a hand against Harry’s shoulder. “After what you said, I knew I had to. Malfoy –
“Have your friends noticed anything odd?” Malfoy prodded gently, clearly feeling uneasy but still determined to continue. “Have Granger or Weasley said anything about struggling in class, or –”
The images whirled around Harry, speeding up and spiraling ever downward, until Harry was sucked up and spit out into the place he did not want to go.
“Didn’t think of it,” Harry replied nonchalantly as he bounded to his feet. “Doesn’t matter now,” he added with a grin. “I finished the spell before the ladder collapsed.”
He closed his eyes, imagining the harsh, cold-fire burn against his back, the snapping of the hooks as he desperately tore himself away, trying to get to Draco, to find the strength to sever his connection with the hooks.
Draco reached Harry and frowned down at him. Impulsively, Harry craned his neck and kissed the angry crease between Draco’s eyebrows.
McGonagall sighed, interrupting Harry’s reverie. His eyes snapped back to her as she folded her hands atop the letter and looked at him appraisingly.
“I, er – I saw a mind healer about it, for a little while. Ginny threatened to leave if I didn’t. It was hard, really hard.” Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, remembering. “But it helped. That’s why I started running, and then kickboxing a little later. It’s an outlet, gives the rage someplace to go.”
In the sudden quiet, Harry could hear the sound of the cuckoo clock from the next room. He breathed in and out slowly, focusing on counting the ticks.
Maeve positioned herself where everyone could see her, behind the mess of lights and centered between Harry and Draco. She looked very much like a professor about to address her class. Draco noticed that Hermione sat up a little straighter, as if she wanted to take notes.
Harry had laughed when it happened, delighted by the speed of Malfoy’s wandless Summoning Charm. His wand had never even reached Harry.
Draco did most of the cooking on the nights he and Harry spent together, and while he preferred it that way, he always got a little thrill when Harry made something for him. It was special, knowing that Harry was thinking of him while cooking during the day, whiling away the hours until Draco arrived home. It was love, pure and simple, and Draco could not remember how he had ever survived without it.
After casting a strong warming charm around them, Harry lay down beside Draco and took his hand. They were silent for a time, Harry waiting for the moment when Draco would be ready to talk through his theories.
The anticipation of it was almost better than the act itself. Draco stayed quiet, content to simply observe, content to savor his slowly building arousal.
It wasn’t their last night. Harry knew that down to his bones. But he held Draco anyway, and he didn’t let him go.
“Dueling,” Draco said, a tiny crease of confusion marring his brow. “And Muggle dueling, obviously. You’ve just told me that’s what you do all day.” He rolled his eyes fondly. “Do keep up, Potter.”
Draco did not elaborate and Blaise chose to let the subject drop, but as they headed into the shop to wheedle cakes out of Maeve, Draco could feel the intensity of his gaze, and he knew that had he turned to look, he would have seen Blaise wearing the expression of someone who was one move away from checkmating his opponent’s king.
“Ok, martial arts,” Draco said, the words sounding strange in a pure-blood’s mouth. Releasing Harry’s knee, he brushed the hair out of his eyes and smiled. “Would you be interested in learning more about martial arts? Its history, how it is used in different cultures, maybe different time periods even?” Draco’s words came faster, tone laced with excitement. “When you learn more about something, it opens pathways into other subjects, other things that might inspire you, and when you follow the research like that, you can find all these new things to be passionate about, things that give you new ideas and shift your perspective.”
“That’s why I testified against him,” Malfoy said, words ringing out strongly in the hush of the room. His vulnerability had retreated back inside his walls.
When Harry finally joined Draco on the sofa, nervousness was pouring off him in obvious waves, but there was a determined glint in his eyes.
Draco wiped damp palms on his trousers, feeling uncomfortably vulnerable. “He’s not afraid of my darkness, or my pain – and he trusts me enough to show me his own.”
Lavender had clearly been startled when Harry arrived this morning with an anxious Draco in tow. But she hadn’t said anything nasty, just looked to Harry for an explanation.
Malfoy leaned even closer, and Harry wanted nothing more than to fall into him. Tiny shocks of lightning seemed to be assaulting his veins. Malfoy’s lips parted and Harry nearly groaned. The air between them was thick and heavy with promise.
Harry just managed to stop himself from reflexively spitting out an insult. Because Malfoy’s tone was almost as un-Malfoy-like as his hair. It wasn’t haughty or demanding or even very forceful. Malfoy was looking up at him now, one eyebrow raised, yes, but without the malicious sneer Harry was used to seeing from him. He seemed to simply be waiting for Harry to obligingly step aside.
Harry blinked at him innocently, and then hid his smile behind his menu. Draco grumbled a bit, but settled in to pore over his own menu enthusiastically enough.
Draco covered Harry’s hand with his own. “I’m sorry, too,” he said, gazing steadily into Harry’s eyes. “For all of it.”
It felt like a dismissal, like Malfoy expected him to go, but Harry wasn’t giving up that easily. He shuffled back to where the bed met the wall and leaned on it, letting the breeze from the window drift pleasantly across his face. It calmed him.
Ron grumbled a bit when McGonagall mentioned an eighth year table in the Great Hall and an eighth year dormitory out on the grounds. Hermione impatiently shushed him, mumbling something about inter-house unity, and Harry didn’t exactly
“It was hard,” Draco said haltingly. “In some ways, it was harder than the war. It was – nothingness, instead of something actively hurting me. Harder to brace for, you know?”
“You have to stop taking risks like this, Potter,” Draco said quietly. “You could have been hurt, and no one would have been there to help. No one would have known how to find you.”
“It kind of makes sense, looking back.” Ron nodded to himself, giving Harry a weighted once-over. “The way you two always followed each other around, couldn’t stop staring at each other. Guess there was something to that, after all.” Ron blew out an amused breath and shook his head fondly.
It would start with an offhand remark, a casual mention of running into Malfoy at the shops. And then there’d be a gleam and a sudden distance in Harry’s eyes, and Ginny would know she’d lost him.
Draco was just about to fetch a fresh pot of tea when a glimpse out the window startled him. The sun was low in the sky, long shadows gathering on the street corners. He and Hermione must have been talking for
A moment later, McGonagall gasped. Her eyes flitted across the parchment more quickly as the color drained from her face.
“The way you were looking at the flowers, it was like you were –” Harry faltered, not sure he could explain. He gestured helplessly between them, waggling his fingers as if he could snatch the right words from the air. “It lit you up,” he said finally, “like you had never seen anything so wonderful.”
Harry Potter. The love of Draco’s life. A love that had grown naturally and authentically between them, never once influenced or altered by the madcap orange potion that had been forced down their throats.
Draco picked at one of his nails, resisting the urge to smooth a thumb over his ring. There seemed to be white noise hissing inside his brain, a fuzzy unpleasantness invading his ears.
“You’re nervous,” Harry said, shutting the door and leaning against it. His heart tightened painfully with the observation, but he made no move to approach Draco, wanting to give him space. “Why are you nervous?”
But Harry was starting to understand Draco, and he knew that with Draco this upset, prodding at him would be no help. Harry needed to wait out this silence; he needed to let Draco come to him.
As the match continued, the different kicks and punches blurred together, the movements almost too fast for Draco to distinguish them. He cringed every time Harry took a hit, but the thrill of watching Harry fight soon overwhelmed all of Draco’s fear.
The hero worship had died down somewhat, now that the one-year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts had come and gone. People were moving on, and the public had slowly cottoned on to the fact that Harry was much more likely to be friendly when treated like any other passing stranger.
“Why not?” Harry asked. “It would be better with us both to explain, I think. I almost fire-called your shop to invite you, but it was last minute and I wasn’t sure I should bother you at work.”
“I was beginning to suspect as much,” sighed McGonagall. “And I am afraid it is past time to involve the Ministry.”
Draco’s shoulders tensed, but then he surprised Harry. “Perhaps,” he said quietly, his voice tinged with something that could have been hope.
“Yes, Potter.” Malfoy sighed wearily, but Harry knew the sigh wasn’t directed at him. “I was with her before dinner. She was calm, and said she needed to be alone for a while. She was planning to take a walk to visit the thestrals.”
Hermione’s response was lost in a loud shriek of laughter from the sofa, but Draco was certain she was bubbling over with questions. And honestly, if he wasn’t so content to be half-dozing atop Harry, he’d likely be bursting at the seams with questions too.
Harry’s mouth went dry. He never would have thought that eyebrows could be sexy, but apparently, he was wrong. He swallowed, and did his best to give Malfoy an annoyed look.
“Have you read that book before?” Harry asked innocently, untucking Draco’s shirt and nuzzling at the pale strip of skin that was revealed.
Normally, he’d suffer through the awkward pleasantries, not wanting to be impolite, but every man has his limits, and apparently Draco Malfoy in a purple Muggle waistcoat (
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face and reached out to Draco with a smile. “I’m fine. C’mere a second?”
“Fuck if I know,” Draco grumbled. He stood and carried both their chairs back to the table. Suddenly feeling quite cross, he swept a hand over the surface, aggressively gathering biscuit crumbs into a neat pile. “She didn’t even ask us for the notes!”
“A stirring rod, for Potions,” Draco said. Then, with a soft tsk he said, “Honestly, Potter. School wasn’t
Draco slumped against the pillows, curling up on his side. Harry followed him down, then hesitantly pulled Draco into him, settling with his chest against Draco’s back.
Harry felt faint with relief when less than ten minutes later, Draco strode purposefully back into the hospital wing, his arms overflowing with flowers. Without saying a word, he arranged them lovingly around Luna’s bedside, even taking the time to weave a lovely purple bloom into her hair. When he finished, Draco resumed his position by Luna’s side, catching up her hand and protectively shifting his chair closer.
Harry nodded without lifting his head, his nose bumping against Draco’s sternum. He knotted his fingers into Draco’s t-shirt as he gathered his thoughts.
And then Draco flopped away from Harry to lie flat on the bed. Harry moved to follow him, wanting – no, needing – to stretch his body out on top of Draco’s, to feel every inch of him pressed beneath. But Draco stopped him with a hand to his chest.
“Oh yes, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said, his attention snapping back to her. “They’re a touch crisper than I am accustomed to, and it contrasts beautifully with the silkiness of your glaze.”
“I didn’t mean you should become an auror.” Frustrated with himself, Harry ran a hand through his hair.
Draco pulled a tea tin from his pocket and slid it across the table. It was the one that held the Harry tea, the one Draco had taken from the kitchen this morning, promising Harry a refill.
Harry screwed up his face, and Draco could tell he was remembering all the horrors the Room had paraded before them.
And somehow, maybe Draco heard the words Harry could not speak, because he didn’t prod Harry toward the door or insist they go to bed. He just hummed once, softly, and leaned back again, shoulder still touching Harry’s and head once more against the wall.
“Yes,” Blaise said, a sudden smile overtaking his face. “Which kind are most tantalizing? The ones that really get your blood up, that make you want to rush ahead to the ending.” He took a step closer to Harry, lowering his voice as if confiding a secret. “You know, that spark that makes you believe you can solve it.”
Harry and Ron shared a long, wide eyed look. Ron broke first, lunging for the discarded sweets packet. As soon as he snatched it up, the wrapper transformed. Golden script unfurled across the newly vibrant packaging, jaunty letters proclaiming the candies to be “Mad-Eye Moodies.”
As they were leaving the hospital wing, Harry plucked a brilliantly purple flower from the blooms clustered along the wall and offered it to Draco.
Hermione made a noise like she wanted to interrupt, but Draco was entirely focused on Harry, as if they were the only two people in the room.
“I think we’re in some weird mashed together version of our childhood homes,” he said, turning to Draco. He gestured at the cupboard. “That was my bedroom, and the mortar is the color of my aunt’s favorite wallpaper.”
die, and – and I – I don’t know, Malfoy. It just seems so bloody unlikely – that we survived it, that we made our way back here, that after everything, we – that we found our way to each other.” He huffed out an incredulous breath. “And if we hadn’t – if I never got to know you –” he shook his head with a grimace - “and I was lying there in bed, holding you in my arms, practically shaking, thinking of how easily I could have lost you, terrified of things that never even happened.”
Malfoy didn’t respond, but after what felt like a very long time, he laid down beside Harry. Harry thought about how guarded Malfoy had been this first week back at Hogwarts, hardly interacting with anyone, keeping a careful distance between himself and the rest of the world. He hadn’t laughed, or relaxed, or done anything other than keep his head down and study.
“Fine,” Harry said, holding his hands up in surrender. “I’ve never really liked that tea. That’s why it was all the way in the back of the cabinet.
Harry cringed. He’d suspected as much, but it still hurt to have it confirmed. “I never wanted her to feel that way,” he said dejectedly.
The surrounding mugs were of more subdued colors, allowing the crisp blues and glittery sheen to really pop.
Draco’s eyes drifted shut, just as Harry’s had, and image after image lit up the dark. All of Harry, always of Harry.
“Have you thought at all about what I said?” Harry asked. “About trying to get your magic use back?”
Seeing Malfoy leave finally unstuck Harry’s tongue and he blurted out in a rush, “Because that dust was really pretty.”
Harry swallowed hard, suddenly feeling a chill race through his veins. He glanced at Malfoy, who wasn’t faring much better. Naturally pale, he was now almost white, and his eyes were darting anxiously back and forth. His breath was coming out in panicky bursts.
And then everything sped up again, Harry wanking them both together as breathy whimpers escaped Draco’s throat. Over and over, he murmured Harry’s name, as if this whispersoft breath could erase every
Taking advantage of the reprieve, Harry smoothed his hands over Draco’s flanks and slipped a finger into his crease, a teasing touch that just barely grazed his arsehole.
“Harry!” Molly swooped in to fuss over him the second he stepped inside, as if she’d been waiting and ready to pounce.
Harry let his hand drop and shrugged, not quite ready to meet Draco’s penetrating gaze. “I’ve had worse at Quidditch.”
“Potter!” Draco spluttered, laughing and batting ineffectually at Harry. “Stop that! Tell me what happened!”
Harry woke to the comforting scent of sun-warmed earth and ripe citrus. He nuzzled closer, inhaling deeply.
A month ago, something like this might have been a distraction, his mind fraught and overextended as he wrangled his magic into submission, but now, the control had become second nature to Harry, and channeling nervous energy into magical gymnastics actually freed his thoughts instead of hampering them.
“At school,” Draco went on, looking slightly sheepish, “I, well – I was always enamored with you. Your power and your gentleness. I could see that, you know, even then. But that wasn’t love.” Draco skimmed his fingers over Harry’s forehead before placing his palm on Harry’s heart. His voice had grown steady and certain, no trace left of shame or of doubt. “This though? I love you, Harry. I love
“She always does.” Harry blew out an annoyed breath. “Well, whatever she’s not telling us, it’s not dangerous. She’d never take a risk like that, not if it could hurt me.”
“I think I would,” Hermione said, smiling as she poured herself a fresh cup of tea. “I suppose I should read up on how the brain processes physical verses emotional needs,” she continued smoothly, as if her odd exchange with Draco had not happened. “But I think it’s a solid working theory. It seems to fit better than the injury idea, anyway.”
And then Harry had to close his eyes, because every part of him had gone warm and golden and slow. It was like the water was pooling inside him, filling him with a steady heat that unclenched every one of his muscles. Harry stretched out his limbs, leaning back to rest his head against the edge of the tub. The water enveloped him, lapping gently at his neck, and Harry let out a long groan.
Harry argued that it was perfectly safe, now that they knew what was causing the unconscious apparition, but Draco had not been as certain. If he hadn’t been so eager to fly, he never would have agreed to it. But it had been fine, just as Harry had said it would. Draco supposed Harry had always had good instincts. (It was insufferable, really.)
Tahlyn shook it enthusiastically. “Draco, then. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I have a feeling St. Mungo’s should keep its eye on you.”
They were in a wide, round space, canopied by a vast and incredibly intricate trellis-like dome. Wildflowers of every imaginable color grew over it, clusters of blossomed vines high above them, reigning over the chaotic wonderland of weeds and blooms that stretched across the ground. There was no pattern, no order to any of it, as if nature had adorned itself for a dozen different wild parties and never saw the point in dressing back down.
Hermione paused in tidying her papers and glanced sideways at Draco. “I also noticed something that magical scholars seemed to have overlooked.”
Malfoy was dressed in Muggle clothing again, as if determined to toy with Harry’s heart. He had on plaid pajama bottoms and a long-sleeved cotton shirt, the look startlingly similar to Harry’s own t-shirt and soft joggers.
echoed in his mind, threatening to drag him back into the gut-wrenching despair that had clawed at him in the night.
didn’t even understand what kept pulling his attention back to Malfoy, so he definitely couldn’t justify it to others.
feel tainted. I don’t even know what I want to do, but it feels impossible to choose something just for me.”
There was a strained silence. Malfoy crossed his arms and tapped one foot against the rungs of the stool.
Draco undressed him slowly, baring Harry’s skin inch by inch as he pressed chaste kisses over Harry’s entire body.
Harry pushed himself into a sitting position, but before he could climb out of bed, Malfoy’s eyes opened. Harry hastily pulled a blanket into his lap, covering his obvious erection.
Harry released a long breath. “Draco – I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I saw the letter. But I knew you didn’t want to talk about it, and I didn’t want to push you.”
Draco crossed behind Harry and began walking the perimeter of the room, trailing a hand along the smooth stones. Stopping abruptly, he brought his face close to the wall, nose almost touching it. Wanting to avoid the staircase for the moment, Harry moved to join him.
The vegetables were just reaching ideal tenderness when Harry looked up from his task with a triumphant grin.
“Right, yeah, ok,” Harry babbled, tugging on his hair in a belated rush of uncertainty. “Sorry, I’ll just –” his eyes roved wildly about the room, looking anywhere but at Draco – “sorry!” he almost squeaked.
“That’s excellent,” said Hermione. “Draco, I can’t see anything in here that you’ve missed, but I still think you’re onto something with this. Don’t give up, ok? If the new books are from research facilities, they’re bound to have more useful information.”
Harry skidded to a halt when he reached Malfoy, who had only made it a few paces down the corridor. Harry awkwardly cleared his throat, not quite sure how to start the conversation. Malfoy saved him the trouble, greeting Harry without even looking at him.
The sun beat down, sweat slicked his forehead, the vibrant colors of street vendors’ wares blurred past, and Harry Potter mulled over Draco Malfoy.
“Er… what?” Harry finally managed, after a few stunned seconds of just staring at the side of Malfoy’s head.
Harry gulped down a large swallow, closing his eyes to savor the flavor. “Oh, Draco,” he moaned. “This is incredible.” He took another sip, and seemed to be holding the tea in his mouth. Finally, his throat bobbed and he set down the glass.
“I thought maybe I could just play with them, you know? Do flying lessons, simplified games of Quidditch, like.” Harry blushed and looked away. “It sounds stupid saying it out loud.”
“Why –” Harry stammered. “Why is no one freaking out?” He hated how vulnerable his voice sounded. His eyes were stinging with unshed tears.
He poured two glasses of water and brought them back to the living room. After handing one to Draco, he drained his own and flopped back onto the sofa.
Malfoy’s eyes widened, then narrowed with suspicion, as if there were some trick hidden behind Harry’s offer. Harry just gazed earnestly back at him. Eventually, Malfoy’s posture relaxed, if only slightly. “Alright,” he said carefully.
Harry stopped short at the sight of Madam Malkin’s, realizing he had somehow managed to miss the sandwich shop by several blocks. He shook his head at his own idiocy and spun around, only to stumble. He caught himself, somewhat painfully, against the pointed metal fence surrounding the outdoor seating area of a tiny restaurant. Snatching his hand away with a groan, Harry started back the way he’d come, only to stumble again a few steps later.
“You know how I’ve asked a few times if you wanted to appeal to the Ministry about your magic?” Harry said without preamble.
Hannah shrieked in surprise, but laughed when she saw it was Harry. She rolled her eyes at him, still giggling, and moved to join some of the others around the bonfire.
There was something wrong with her skin. It was dry and cracked, like parched desert sand, and blood was oozing down her hands and face, pooling slowly beneath her.
“He’ll be alright, mate.” Ron clapped him on the shoulder and jostled him a bit. “You know, me and Hermione weren’t all that surprised about you and Malfoy.”
. Malfoy didn’t seem bothered – just coolly continued taking notes or practicing wand movements – but Driffield’s attitude was driving Harry
“Yes, detectives! Fascinating,” Draco sighed dreamily. He ran a reverent finger down the spine of the book, eyes gone glassy and distant. Then he jumped slightly and shook free of his reverie. He cocked his head at Harry. “Why do you read these stories if you don’t want to be an Auror?”
“How did you –” Draco trailed off. He pulled the frozen block away from his face and poked at it in wonderment. “You shouldn’t have been able to make it cold,” he said, glancing back up at Maeve inquisitively. “Temperature is one of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration!”
The interviews, though exhausting in number, had not been as bad as Draco anticipated. The post-it notes were obviously a joke, a tiny distraction to calm Draco’s nerves, because Maeve was taking the process quite seriously. Only those who had impressed her in their first interview
Draco huffed in exasperation, but then seemed to sense Harry’s disquiet. His fingers grazed Harry’s shoulder as he said, “You’re helping now.”
Harry’s fingers flexed, longing for the steady grip of his wand. As if a wand would help, as if they could trust that any spell wouldn’t be tainted.
Harry nodded, disappointment clinging to him as he disposed of the trash and deposited the lemonade pitcher and dirty glasses in the sink.
“Hello, Luna,” Harry finally replied. He smiled up at her, absurdly grateful for the distraction. Luna had an ethereal presence, as if she carried a better reality with her wherever she chose to go. And Harry could use a better reality right about now.
“Hello,” Draco replied in a carefully neutral tone. He swallowed hard, smoothing his hands self-consciously over the sweatpants he was wearing.
Maeve handed him a damp cloth and led him over to sit on a stool. He sniffed and wiped his face, feeling as wrung out as the cloth. A moment later, Maeve set a steaming cup of tea in front of him and pulled up her own stool.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry said. He resisted the urge to clutch at Draco’s retreating fingers. “Does that – happen a lot?”
Draco bowed his head. “No. I didn’t deserve your friendship. I was spoiled and bigoted – a stupid, cowardly bully.” He paused, then straightened and met Harry’s eyes. “What I did to you was wrong. I am so sorry, Harry.”
“I know,” Harry cut in. He understood what Draco was trying to say, somehow knew that Draco would stubbornly stutter on until he found the words to proclaim Harry a hero. But Harry didn’t want to hear it. He pressed his lips together and looked away.
George cleared his throat. “I did think we might get a glimpse of the life-debts, and I was pretty sure I could untangle the potion residue from them, if we were right about that being the problem. But this?” He paused to wave a hand between Harry and Draco. “I don’t even know where to start.”
Harry groaned inwardly, but managed to ignore his fluttering heart. He raised his eyebrows at Malfoy, still waiting for an answer.
“Yes, yes. That was this year’s birthday present,” Maeve explained patiently. “This present is for all your birthdays I missed before we knew one another.”
They had comforted each other after nightmares before, taming the unconscious fears by entwining their bodies, a reassurance as spiritual as it was physical.
Draco’s cauldrons crowding the kitchen. Sex on the rug by the fire. Enjoying meals that Harry had cooked. Grading papers on the sofa. Muggle board games in the bedroom. Transfiguring new shelves to hold all their books. Kneeling on the stones of the tub to swallow Draco’s cock. Visits from friends. Holidays. Laughter and sorrow and the memory of loss. Tears. Joy. Sentiomancy. Debates about magical theory. Potions and herbs and invention. Innovation. Photographs of their families. Arguments and apologies and mugs of sugary tea. Seeker games. Dueling out back, with bubble baths afterward to soak away the aches. Kisses and caresses and comfort after nightmares. Sharing dreams. Thousands of good mornings and goodnights and everything in between.
Blaise’s subsequent grin had been so smugly delighted that Draco had punched him in the shoulder. When the grin only widened, Draco had muttered, “Yeah, yeah, you pompous bastard. Thank you, alright? But next time, just invite us both to the same pub.”
Draco bit his lip, suddenly feeling exposed in his thin t-shirt. Something about this moment of leave-taking shattered the peace they had found. The past seemed to reassert itself, dark tendrils writhing in the air between them. Draco shifted his arm subtly, hiding the faded Dark Mark from view.
“Draco, stop,” Harry said, cutting into Draco’s unraveling thoughts. “It’s ok, I promise. There’s no way Hermione believed for a second that I was going to take notes.”
Draco knelt on the Quidditch Pitch, head bowed. Fingers sifting restlessly through the remains of the flowers, he uncovered nothing more substantial than a few clumps of withered vines.
“Yes, well –” Draco crossed his arms haughtily, trying to hide how flustered he was. “He is rather handsome.”
“Yes,” Maeve said. “Completely. No more spontaneous apparition for either of you.” Her voice was carefully neutral. She seemed to understand that Harry and Draco had lost something today, even if this was the best of all possible outcomes.
After Luna’s collapse on Sunday, Harry and Draco had spent the afternoon in the hospital wing. By the time they reached her, Madam Pomfrey had already called in the specialist from St. Mungo’s who had treated Padma. The Healer had placed Luna in a deep stasis, and it only took a few gentle probes at her core for Harry to find the cluster of hooks biting into her magic.
Luna waited until he had calmed somewhat and then looked him right in the eye. “No, Draco, you couldn’t have.”
“It sure did,” Lavender crowed. “I can’t wait to try it! Harry, you have to teach me more kickboxing. Tomorrow, ok? Can we start tomorrow?”
He sighed. Pulling Draco’s jumper over his t-shirt, he sat on the floor by the bed. He curled himself into a tight ball and waited for Draco to come back.
Tipping them into the pot, he added more seasoning and settled against the counter as the mixture cooked. For the next few minutes, he split his time between stirring the vegetables, fretting over the rundown appearance of his kitchen (the cabinets were scuffed beyond repair and the beige wallpaper was peeling – not that Harry had ever seemed to notice), and trying not to be too obvious about ogling Harry. But, oh how adorable he looked, hunched over the table like that, the late afternoon sun softening the deep black of his hair and eyes squinty with concentration. His knife grip was a bit clumsy, but Draco could forgive him that.
Harry stood so swiftly that his chair clattered to the ground. He swept Draco into his arms, lifting him off his feet and kissing him until they were both breathless.
“Don’t,” Draco said, pulling out of Harry’s grip. “It was my fault. I was weak.” He tilted his head and smiled wryly. “I never could fight like you.”
“No,” said Draco. “They are both ancient wizarding buildings, with copious magic of their own. We knew from our first day that Hogwarts had produced the flowers somehow. So did the Manor.”
They locked eyes, and Draco was lost. The nightmare had ravaged his defenses, and he was far too tired to hide the desire that was blazing up inside him. Harry’s eyes sparked, darting to Draco’s lips, just as they had on the street outside the kickboxing club. Draco’s breath hitched, and Harry tilted his head toward Draco –
“That’s what I thought!” Harry cried, pleased to have something to contribute. “But Draco said life-debts have to be called on before they work.”
Catching Harry’s thoughtful look, Draco brightened and his words spilled out with even more enthusiasm. “They could have strengthened it, or even designed spells that purposely leaked dangerous residue! If they tampered with it, that would explain why it does not function in the ways we expect.”
Shaking his head at himself, blood thrumming with an intoxicating mix of anticipation and nerves, Harry grabbed a light hoodie from the closet and strode out the door.
But Harry also understood that there was a part of Draco that was still unsure, a flicker of confusion that wriggled through the cracks, as if he could not quite trust what was happening between them. And so Harry hadn’t argued when Draco said he’d be busy at the shop for the next few days, preparing for the changeover from fall to winter teas. It wasn’t a lie, Harry knew, but he also suspected that Draco needed some space to think things through.
McGonagall folded her hands together and turned to Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, I have no doubt that you will have many prestigious institutions clamoring for the privilege of overseeing your Potions apprenticeship next year” – she paused as Draco made a startled sound, and Harry could have sworn she almost
“So you tried the spell on the glass flower, but it didn’t have any essence in it at all?” Harry asked.
McGonagall sighed, an expression of pain marring her face. “Hogwarts failed Mr. Malfoy, and I regret my part in that.”
She bustled up to him and ran her fingers across his forehead. With her other hand, she traced a circular shape across his sternum.
Draco chuckled, but sobered quickly. “I feel – shut out, almost,” he admitted. “I know it’s wrong, to feel resentful. The residue is dangerous, and the Headmistress has a responsibility to the school. Of course she needs to defer to the Unspeakables.”
Draco pointed at the ceiling, where the lilac and blue lights danced. Their thickest rays clustered around the entrance to the long corridor Draco was heading toward.
Harry breathed in shakily, then forced himself to exhale. He slowly reached out and turned off the faucet. Waving a hand, he wandlessly banished the puddle of water, not even caring that all spell work was a risk these days.
Harry was curled into Draco, one arm wrapped around him and head resting against his chest. Embarrassingly, he realized he had begun to count Draco’s heartbeats.
“Draco hasn’t really – gotten over the past,” Harry said carefully. “I mean, neither have I, or any of us, really. And I know things like that take time. But Draco just feels so guilty, and – and ashamed, and it’s like he can’t bring himself to believe I really want to be with him.”
It was a display of raw, impossible power, and Draco almost whimpered at the beauty of it. Harry was a lightning storm – blinding, jagged,
Harry fingers slipped, knocking the cumin off the rack. The glass container fell to the floor and shattered. Cursing, Harry jumped back, narrowly avoiding cutting his feet.
“Potter, what in the world - ?” Draco trailed off. He ran his hands up and down Harry’s arms, shaking him slightly. “Merlin, are you always like this? I’m never letting you nap again!”
“He just deserves so much better. He’s so smart, Professor,” Harry gushed, still giddy with relief. “You should see some of the Potions theory he’s working on, but he can’t even test anything without his magic. When he told me he’s not allowed to do magic, I just – I got so angry.”
Harry’s hands found the hem of Draco’s shirt and slipped beneath it, hands roving in a heated caress along his spine. His skin was smooth as petals, alluring as velvet.
When Harry came to a minute later, he found that his head was nestled in Draco’s lap. He smiled up at him. “Hello, darling.”
There was an awkward bit, when Draco signaled he was ready by wandlessly conjuring some lube. Harry tried to clamber atop him and their legs tangled oddly and feet were in weird places and everything was wet and sticky, and for one fraught moment, Harry thought he had kneed Draco right in the balls. Harry yelped, flooded with panic, but then Draco was giggling, such an unexpectedly joyful sound that Harry wanted to bottle it, and then Harry was giggling too, and everything was alright again.
“There was no sense of discovery, no room to adapt or change or grow in new and surprising ways. That doesn’t make for a very good garden.” Draco sighed, rubbing a hand over his furrowed brow. “But the Forest was not like that, and neither is your garden. That’s why I like them so much. They’re like this place. Wild. Uncultivated. No path forbidden. Chaotically beautiful.” Draco swallowed hard before finishing.
“Harry, please tell me you didn’t –” Draco broke off with a harsh rasp. His insides were splintering in panic, the fissures so deep that Draco could not understand how his skin was still intact. He had to force the next words from his mouth. “Did you send something to the Ministry?”
McGonagall’s spells had been too strong for Harry to handle, and he might be in even worse shape than Luna right now, if it hadn’t been for Draco.
. It was everything they used to be, but without the pain. Harry wanted Malfoy to push him, and he wanted to push back, just so long as they weren’t out for blood. They had hurt each other enough.
But anything Harry asked for would be too much, for it would mean far more to Harry than it possibly could to Malfoy. Harry couldn’t risk that, not when every touch – every glance, really – made Harry’s longing that much worse.
“I know you feel betrayed, and embarrassed, probably. I mean, I do too, a little. But is it really so horrible?” Harry asked tentatively. “This, I mean,” he added, tightening his grip on Draco. “Us?”
Harry sprang to his feet, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Oh, ok – er, were you busy? Sorry, I should have asked instead of doing the shelf.” He gnawed on his lip and shuffled awkwardly in place, unsure why he had stood up. “I guess I’m kind of getting used to the apparition thing.”
Looking at him, Harry could not help but think of chasing the flowers through Hogwarts on the first day of term. Draco had thrown himself into soot and ashes on that day too, hands trembling as he cradled the glass flower in the Room of Requirement.
Harry’s wand buzzed, startling him out of his oddly domestic fantasy. The minute he opened the oven, he knew the pie was perfect. Golden crisp crust, with the filling just beginning to bubble from the edges. Casting a few cleverly chosen spells, Harry banished the pie to their cottage, ensuring it would stay hot and hidden until he was ready to surprise Draco. He hurried through the washing up and finally left the stuffy classroom.
“Yes,” Draco answered, pleased that Harry had been able to follow his notes. “And Muggle ingredients, as well. I want to understand everything well enough to predict how traditional potions ingredients will chemically react with other substances.”
But it was too late now, so Harry soldiered ahead. “Her recovery was rough, and she had a hard time at first, adapting to the full moons, but she’s doing a lot better now.”
“It reminded me of Maeve,” Harry admitted. “When I came into the shop she scolded me something fierce. Unimpressed that I popped in with no shoes on.”
Harry shivered beneath Draco’s touch. After a long moment, he dropped his hands and met Draco’s eyes. “You have no idea how much.”
Draco gasped, then brought their lips back together, opening his mouth to deepen the kiss. Harry sucked gently on Draco’s bottom lip before sweeping his tongue inside. He had one hand buried in Draco’s hair, the other tracing lightly along Draco’s spine.
Harry laughed in delight. He kissed Draco, stealing the taste from his tongue. Cinnamon and the subtle tang of raspberry danced between them, and Harry saw a flash of the night sky in Draco’s eyes. His stomach swooped with the memories of flying and falling and that first desperate kiss.
“You are an extraordinary person, Draco Malfoy. And I am not the only one who sees that.” Maeve reached out and clasped his hand in both her own. “There is more in this world for you than tea and regret. Don’t you ever forget that.”
“Yes, alright,” Draco said, suddenly feeling cold. He tucked his hands beneath his arms as he followed Harry out of the kitchen.
That surprised Draco. He often became lost in his work, but his focus had never been ironclad enough to shut out
Draco’s stomach seemed to twist inside out. He struggled to swallow a mouthful of shortbread that had turned to dust. The tinkling bells of the door rang suddenly through the shop, and Draco thought he had never been more grateful for anything in his entire life.
“Draco, what a pleasant surprise!” she exclaimed, not a second after her arrival. “I want to hear all about this dodgy apparition business and Harry’s useless with details.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry gasped, eyelids fluttering as he tried to turn his head toward Draco. “We don’t have to – to talk. Talk about – that.”
With that, Draco spun on his heel and wrenched open the door to the garden. It slammed behind him, rattling the cups and plates on the table.
Draco was lying on his side, reading a book he had propped against the wall, his body a long, elegant line. He was fully dressed, but the fit of his pale green trousers left little to the imagination and Harry’s mouth had gone dry as he thought of peeling that skin-tight fabric slowly off Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes with a groan and headed for the back door. But before he passed even halfway through the storeroom, he found himself turning around. Rushing back into the shop, he threw his arms around Maeve in a tight hug. She clucked at him softly and kissed the top of his head before shooing him toward the door.
Draco shrugged out of Harry’s reach and shifted around to lean back against the arm of the sofa. He was facing Harry, but he felt very far away.
Harry. He wished Malfoy was groaning for a different reason, wished he could cover Malfoy with his body, wished he was the one making Malfoy writhe and moan.
Harry hesitated. There was something off about Ginny’s tone, and she wasn’t usually so fidgety. But she looked up at him then, expression calm and expectant, so he shrugged off the weirdness and tried to explain.
When Harry failed to answer, Draco sighed and tugged on his sleeve. “You didn’t hurt me, Potter,” he said, voice stronger this time. His fingers found the bare skin of Harry’s elbow and they both shivered.
When Draco removed his fingers (it had been an eternity, it had been no time at all), Harry was bereft. Empty and wanting. Unbearably alone.
the barrier? I didn’t hurt you, did I?” He looked up at Harry then, a worried crease etching his brow.
Draco smiled and relaxed into the embrace, stunning Harry with his sudden capitulation. It was the first time that day he’d shown no trace of embarrassment at Harry uttering his name.
Harry shrugged good-naturedly, skirting around the bottle collection to sit on the edge of the tub. He dropped a kiss onto Draco’s forehead.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He felt a flash of guilt for never telling Draco that McGonagall had revealed his part in the organization. But Harry had not wanted to force a conversation Draco was not ready for.
Draco dropped his gaze as his cheeks heated. He quickly schooled his expression, but it was not enough to deter Blaise.
“Draco, I gave as good as I got. I did terrible things to you too.” Harry’s fingers skimmed across the marks on Draco’s chest.
Draco rolled on top of him, and then they were kissing again, Harry squeezing Draco’s arse, Draco thrusting against Harry.
“I don’t know,” Harry said slowly. “I meant to, that’s why I kept it, but something always stopped me. It made me nervous, and I didn’t know why.”
“Maybe,” Draco said, tapping a finger against his left wrist. His eyes went a little unfocused and Harry thought he heard him mutter something about blood, but then he wrenched his head to the side and scowled.
Harry watched him come, staring as each ripple of pleasure passed across Draco’s face. He had never seen anything more beautiful.
“Is she well?” Draco asked. His voice was steady and his tone polite, but his fingers worried at the edge of the table. He must have brushed against something sticky, because he grimaced slightly and folded his hands into his lap.
Setting down his water bottle, Harry felt a fresh surge of determination. He clambered to his feet, but when he pointed his wand at the wall, ready for another attempt at magically programming the offensive attacks, his eyes snagged on the view out the window. The sun was rapidly setting, casting long shadows over the garden.
Seconds later, Draco went silent, his sullen words dissolving as quickly and thoroughly as did the last wisps of fog. Mouth slack, Draco stared at the landscape, head tipped back in an attempt to take everything in at once.
Harry shrugged and took Draco’s hand, playing with his fingers. “I like hearing you talk about potions,” he said honestly.
Harry startled, knocking his head against the doorframe where he’d been standing for a few minutes now, admiring Draco.
“Draco, you don’t understand,” Blaise insisted. “Ginny says Harry was always talking about you, always heartsick and dreamy whenever he saw you for five seconds at that shops. Ginny says–”
While the shortbread was baking, she had talked to him about scones and breads, kneading and rising, the advantages and disadvantages of eschewing a proving drawer for charms. With Maeve’s voice washing over him, soothing as a babbling brook, Draco had breathed in the aroma of chocolate and cloves that was slowly overtaking the air, perfectly content as his fingers shaped scone after scone. They were messy at first, but after some sharp corrections by Maeve (and a few painful raps on the wrists), he had found his rhythm, and Maeve’s eyes were glowing with pride by the time he had finished.
Draco looked up at Harry then, panic sparking momentarily in his eyes. It was obvious he had said more than he’d meant to. His cheeks colored, and he ducked his head as he set the mug down firmly on the table.
Harry had been there for hours last night before the barrier released him, a leak in the ceiling steadily dripping on his head as he’d knelt with his palms plastered to the door, futilely trying to get as close as he could to where Draco must be huddled on the floor.
Draco fumbled blindly at his own trousers, finally popping the button and slipping a hand inside his pants.
Draco groaned and reached blindly toward his bedside table. There was a crash as he accidentally knocked over a stack of books. He grunted in frustration, but managed to open the drawer. His hand scrabbled among the contents and emerged with a bottle of lube.
Harry got his breath back and tried to pull Draco’s mouth to his, but Draco had already leapt up. He grabbed Harry’s hand and tugged him to his feet.
“I need to tell you something,” Draco said slowly. He swallowed audibly before continuing. “Something I never intended to speak about.”
Because now that Maeve had given them a closer look, it was abundantly clear that nowhere in the space between Harry and Draco did a single spot of orange connect with the sky blue light that held their love.
Instead, Harry shuffled in place indecisively, unsure what to make of a Malfoy who turned statements into almost polite requests.
Draco’s face softened. “Are you sure your head is alright?” he asked, that compelling crease once again furrowing his brow. “You look a bit – odd.”
“I had to stop loosing my magic around people,” Harry explained, “because I didn’t like how it felt, having to push through all the hooks. But I never stopped with you. It’s unconscious, instinctual, like. My magic is always looking for yours, whenever I’m tired or miss you or –” he paused, fighting back a blush - “or when one of us comes – and it has never hurt me. Not once. No cold. No hooks.”
want that. So many dead, so many sacrificed at an altar where Malfoy had served. Giving in to rage, blaming someone, blaming
Draco made a pained, impatient noise as Pomfrey lingered over the diagnostic spell, mumbling to herself as she checked and rechecked each piece of information. Finally, she nodded and stepped aside.
Harry closed his eyes. Bending his knees to ground himself, he let the rest of his body grow slack. His magic poured from his fingers, tracking toward McGonagall like tendrils of slow-moving fog.
Harry sighed and slumped forward, curling up on the sofa with his head in Draco’s lap. Draco tugged a blanket from beneath him and arranged it over Harry. His fingers slipped into Harry’s hair, moving in soothing circles.
“Do you know the spells?” Harry asked, releasing him. “Can we try any of it ourselves, or do we need to go to McGonagall?”
Harry almost smiled at him, despite Malfoy’s obvious irritation. This spark of challenge between them felt –
“You said that when it worked the first time, you were not thinking about the duel. You reacted instinctively. Physically. As a kickboxer.” Draco paused, tapping a finger against his breastbone. “You were too focused on the magic this morning, too in your head. You needed to trust your body, to settle into the kickboxing. You needed to let the magic come unconsciously. That’s when you do your best spellwork.” Belatedly realizing that he was worrying at the spot where his own magic was hidden away, Draco quickly let his hand fall. “So I helped you to forget the duel.”
A wave of heat rushed over Harry as his temper flared. For one wild moment, all he could see was the sneering face of Lucius Malfoy, a man who had poisoned his son’s future so thoroughly that he may as well have salted the earth.
Parvati made a painful sound and swayed on her feet. Hermione rushed forward. She dropped to her knees beside Padma, muttering the diagnostic spells they had learned in their Healing workshop. By that time, the professor was there, gently immobilizing Padma and hurrying her to the hospital wing. Lavender reached out to Parvati, but she pulled away and ran to catch up to her sister.
Malfoy’s fingers were busy, plucking dead buds off a vine that trailed through the brush next to them, but he kept glancing up at Harry before quickly looking away. Eventually though, there was nothing left in reach to prune. He gathered the withered petals in a small pile in front of him and sighed.
Draco stared at the expanded map of lights in front of him, blinking forcibly until he could focus, until he could be sure of what he was seeing.
Maeve smirked at him. “Aren’t you the clever one? No one’s ever unraveled the theory of one of my own spells that quickly.”
Malfoy was staring at him, eyes wide with wonder. “Potter,” he demanded, “how in Salazar’s name did you –” Malfoy trailed off with something that was almost a laugh, and shook his head.
Just as Harry was about to thank McGonagall, Draco had spoken up, asking to travel to Azkaban in the Headmistress’ stead.
Maeve patted Harry’s shoulder and gave him a gentle push toward the door to the back room. “Not my place to say. But don’t worry, love, he’ll be alright.”
“Oh.” Draco blinked down at his watch. “How unusually proper of you. I am aghast.” Looking down his nose at Harry, he spoke with exaggerated haughtiness. “I suppose I’ll have to accept.”
Draco kissed Harry’s neck, then jumped slightly when Hermione cut into the conversation. Her voice was an odd mix of fascinated reverence and frustrated growl.
“Oh Draco, no,” Harry said, horrified. Questions swirled dizzily in his head, but now was not the time to ask them. “I’m so sorry.”
No, it was the little things she chased after, the seeming loopholes in his restrictions. The oaths he had sworn made no mention of healing spells, or Potions – or owl post, broomsticks, and floo travel, for that matter. So perhaps Maeve simply meant for him to stretch a bit, expand enough to hit the edges of the boundaries imposed upon him. Perhaps she simply wanted him to
Harry bit his lip and averted his eyes, afraid the raw sorrow in his voice would betray his confused emotions regarding Draco.
Malfoy drew this knees up to his chest and crossed his arms over them. Harry was starting to realize that his former nemesis tended to curl into himself when he was thinking. He wondered if Malfoy had always done that; it seemed far too adorable a habit for a haughty teenager to indulge in. It made Harry picture Malfoy as a particularly intelligent cat. He almost laughed then, because cats had always reminded him of dragons, in a way.
“It’s nothing,” Draco said, rushing to fill the awkward silence. “I had planned to begin work on my winter teas today – it takes quite a while to build up enough stock – but I seem to have misplaced my notes. I have new ideas, of course, but I also want to recreate last year’s most popular flavors. I could work backward without too much trouble if I had samples of the blends, but I just went through almost the entire storeroom and didn’t find anything.” He scowled crossly and grumbled, “I told Maeve not to meddle with my organizational system, but she never listens.”
Still smiling, Maeve nodded toward a door at the end of the hallway. Draco started, positive that nothing but a mirror had adorned that wall the last time Maeve cooked him supper.
“It was the strangest thing,” Blaise said. “I was passing by here last week, or perhaps it was the week before? I was meeting a client at a restaurant or I would have stopped in, of course – and I saw Potter leaving your shop.”
“Harry?” Draco said, darting a glance at him before frowning down at his mug. “I don’t understand why you brought me this. Why you’re here.”
Harry greeted him with a smirk, tugging playfully at the front pocket of the hoodie. “You look good in my colors, sweetheart.”
Harry and Draco had waited too, their own silent vigil for the flowers - though the loud and frantic theorizing of the Ministry team infringed upon their grief. To Harry, it had felt as if the harried shouts were desecrating a grave.
Harry put the vial away and pulled his knees to his chest, tucking his chin into his arms. Sentiomancy seemed to rely heavily on personal associations, and he was beginning to suspect those things might change over time. Or would a Calming Draught have always felt like sleeping beneath someone he loved, even before he had ever experienced that with Draco?
Draco’s nostrils flared and his hands clenched into fists. “You’ve gone to the Forbidden Forest to practice Dark Magic
It took a long time, much longer than when Harry had teased him outside the ghoul gate, but Harry was patient, worshiping the bones of Draco’s wrist with tiny nips and licks, unbuttoning Draco’s cuff and working his mouth over the sensitive skin of Draco’s forearm.
He rested a hand against Draco’s shoulder, but the enraged Slytherin twisted away. “I don’t care! It wasn’t enough. Why did McGonagall –” Draco shook his head, eyes pained and helpless. “You and I would
“Yeah,” Ginny said. Her laces had come undone beneath her restless fingers, and she bent to retie them, moving very slowly, almost like she was avoiding looking at Harry. “But what does that have to do with anything?”
But when he reached the back door of the cottage, he found Ginny sitting on the steps, hat damp with rain, her cheeks flushed from the cold.
Draco craned his head to look at Harry, one eyebrow raised as if he knew exactly what Harry had been about to say.
“I don’t want to leave you, you know,” Maeve said. She pulled a biscuit tray toward them, full of the discards, all the odd shapes and broken pieces.
“What do you need?” Harry asked quietly. His hands were scrabbling anxiously at his sides, but he made no move to touch Draco again. “Anything you need, tell me and I’ll help.”
potion?” Harry yelped. Or he meant to yelp. But the words came out as slow and languorous as his body felt. “Did you invent it? You invent
Harry scuffed his worn trainers against the dirt irritably, but then he stomped over to Draco and threw himself down in the grass. Draco made his way down from the boulder he had been perched on and sat a few paces away from Harry. Uncertain what, if anything, Harry had told Lavender about their – well, their
Harry smirked at him. “Oh really?” he purred against Draco’s skin, tracing his tongue down to the hollow of his throat.
Harry felt his hands start to clench at the thought of the war, but then let out a measured exhale and forcibly relaxed his fingers. He wiped his hands on his trousers and tilted his head back to look at the canopy of blooms above. The buds glimmered almost like fairy lights, and Harry found himself wondering if they had been enchanted. He looked at Malfoy then, meaning to ask if he knew anything about these strange flowers, but the words caught in his throat.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, voice soft and wavering. “That was unnecessary. I just – I don’t know what you want me to say.”
He could feel the ghost of Malfoy’s breath on his skin and his blood thrummed with the thrill of it. Fighting Malfoy, being bested by him, submitting to him, even – it had been like a delicious kind of foreplay. Lying in Malfoy’s bed now, knowing that Malfoy didn’t feel the same, was the worst kind of torment.
McGonagall bristled, her shoulders tightening. “I cannot condone putting you in further danger, Mr. Potter.”
Draco did not answer, but something inside him cried out. For one feverish moment, his magic flared to life, sparking from his core to the tips of his fingers. He bit his lip and focused on dampening it down.
“You want me to lie in a hammock with you,” Draco said. He paused to shiver in a deliberately pointed manner. “In December.”
Harry swallowed hard, fingers picking forlornly at a peeling patch of wallpaper. The words seemed to burrow into his heart, the truth of them a slicing kind of sting.
Harry’s breath hitched, and he slowly removed his fingers. Reaching for the lube, he coated his cock. The friction was almost too much, and he had to take a deep breath to calm himself. Draco looked up at him with a ruinous smile, impatience replaced with tenderness as he and Harry locked eyes.
“I had a lot of anger issues, during the war,” Harry said. “And before that, really. I mean, you know. You’ve seen me lash out, back at school.”
The shop owner – Maeve – had been glancing back and forth between them, presumably waiting for some type of explanation, but suddenly she nodded to herself and grinned.
Blaise sat heavily beside Draco, carefully not looking at him. Draco did not know whether to be irritated or relieved. For a time, they just stared out at the Thames, as dull a grey as Draco had ever seen it. The rain had stopped, but something about that water evoked the same feel. Damp socks and goosebumps and conniving friends. The worst kind of rainy day.
“No,” Draco said, seeming surprised by the question. “I hadn’t even imagined the possibility. But I knew I could not say yes, not when Maeve didn’t know about my role in the war.”
“Have you come to one of these before?” Draco finally asked, as the gym’s trainers began to urge people toward their seats. A group of small children had emerged from a separate room, crowding at the edge of a large red mat. Harry gave a few of them high fives before moving to sit on a metal bench with some of the older kickboxing students.
The tension snapped, and Harry didn’t answer for a moment, unsettled by the abrupt shift. He felt shaken by the entire encounter. But then he shook his head. “I feel like we’re doing this backwards,” he groaned. “Can you explain the resonance thing again?”
But then Malfoy lowered his head, presumably for a closer look at the flower buds he was examining, and a few strands of that white gold hair fell into his eyes. The rest of it was pulled back in the most un-Malfoy-like hairstyle Harry could possibly imagine – a messy bun at the nape of his neck. His hair was slightly too short for it; errant locks fell around his ears and sharp jawline. Harry watched as Malfoy’s slender fingers impatiently brushed the hair away from his face – and Harry stopped thinking about it. It was as good as done already. He simply had to know.
“Oh,” Harry said, the sound more strangled wheeze than word. His mind whirled backward, spinning through the past few weeks as every detail, every inexplicable emotion, every wandering thought, suddenly clicked into place. He fell forward, letting his forehead smack into the table. “Oh,
Harry nodded, breathing hard. He was speeding up, slamming into Draco now, hitting his prostate on every thrust.
Harry had been staring down at his hands, but now he looked up at Draco. “I’m really sorry, Draco. I promise I’ll try to do better.”
“Ok,” Hermione said, resting her weight against the table, “like roommates who indulged each other’s sexual needs.”
“Harry,” Draco moaned, as Harry worked his mouth over a sensitive spot on Draco’s neck. “Harry, I can’t. Need you, please.”
Draco’s hands tightened on his sandwich, and a glop of mayonnaise dripped out onto his lilac trousers, but he didn’t appear to notice.
He blinked, and then his eyes fractured, a ripple of – something – that disturbed, if not entirely dislodged, the shame entrenched there.
The week’s workshop had focused on blending various charms into transfiguration spells, to create sturdy and permanent building renovations. For their final assignment, the professor expected them to work in pairs to completely remodel one of dilapidated structures.
“Because I was jealous,” Draco admitted. He smiled wryly. “And because you didn’t want to be my friend.”
The golden rays were rather disconcerting, streaming in as they were beneath the blue-black sky of enchanted stars. Harry supposed that he and Draco hadn’t really thought this bedroom design through. Floor to ceiling windows really only complemented a midnight sky at… well, mid-night.
“No,” Harry said firmly, then reconsidered. He wanted to be as honest as possible with Draco. “I mean, yes. A little. But not about that.”
Harry was too tired to argue. He sank into the cushions, lying comfortably on his side. Eyes heavy, he felt more than saw Draco drape a blanket over him. Draco’s hand was in his hair then, thumb gently brushing Harry’s forehead. Or maybe it was just dream-Draco touching him with that caress that felt like love, because Harry was already asleep.
There was a thud and a muffled curse, as if Potter had collided with a wall. He never did manage a graceful landing after one of the apparition incidents. Draco smiled at the thought, and then his heart began to pound. He hadn’t actually believed this was going to work.
“They’re your family too, Harry,” Ginny said gently. Then her mouth tightened. “But it wasn’t you. I had a bunch of travel lined up for Harpies training, and then it was just easier to stay away for a bit. I was sorting through some things of my own.”
Malfoy scowled, and entirely uncharacteristically, tossed the book violently to the floor. Harry cringed when it landed, rattled by Malfoy’s loss of control.
Harry insisted. “You fought differently, and a lot later, but you fought just as hard, and with a lot less help than I had.”
Pansy shifted on the bench and adjusted her skirt unnecessarily. Harry’s lack of antagonism seemed to be unnerving her. With a quick glance to see if anyone was listening, she leaned toward him and hissed, “It was months ago, Potter! I was terrified.”
Draco’s eyes flew open. With a shaky inhale, he stared down at his left arm, where Harry’s fingers were splayed casually over the Dark Mark. Draco’s hand clenched into a fist, but then he consciously relaxed it, looking up at Harry with a question in his eyes. Harry lifted Draco’s hand and pressed his lips tenderly to the inside of Draco’s wrist.
Harry stumbled back against a doorframe, blinking to clear his vision after the disorienting whirl of apparition. When his eyes opened, he saw that he was in Draco’s bathroom, and that he had just narrowly avoided tripping into the numerous glass bottles spread across the floor. Draco was kneeling in the bathtub, biting his lip and looking up sheepishly at Harry.
The shop smelled strongly of cinnamon, and a large pot of cherry compote was bubbling on the stove. Pausing for a deep inhale, Draco filched a biscuit and attempted to dip it stealthily into the cherry mixture. Maeve caught him of course, slapping his hand away with a scolding tut. There was something that looked like a sparkler in her hair, shooting out crackling bursts of light. Before Draco could ask, Maeve shooed him toward the far corner of the shop.
“It’s not incredibly consistent,” he admitted, “but everything I read had one detail in common. Residual Dark Magic poisons a
Harry felt like they were back in the courtyard, surrounded by flowers, when he had met this version of Malfoy for the first time.
A clattering sound drew Harry toward the kitchen, where Draco was pulling pans out of a low cupboard. Barefoot again, Draco looked more casual than Harry had ever seen him. He had dressed in light grey trousers and a white cotton t-shirt. It was long sleeved, but so thin that when Draco reached up to open a cabinet, Harry could see the smudged ink of the Dark Mark through the material. For a moment, Harry was surprised not to recoil from the sight. But Draco was not the person he had once been, and Harry had known that for a while now. He was even starting to understand that Draco may have never been the person Harry once thought he was, not entirely. And Draco’s Mark was just another scar.
Granger frowned at that. “I don’t think Harry would break your confidence so lightly,” she said, as if trying to comfort him.
. And Harry could see just how hard he was trying to make up for his mistakes. He didn’t deserve anything that Harry had said to him.
“I don’t think I’ll ever have another nightmare about this place,” Draco added, his open eye drifting closed. “Let’s stay a bit longer.” He smiled lazily and arched his back, before settling more deeply into the soft grass.
In it, a very young Draco crouched in the grass, holding what must have been his mother’s wand. His blond hair was a mess of curls, cascading around his chubby toddler face, and his eyes were alight with laughter. Narcissa sat beside him, one hand supporting his back. She was smiling down at her son with such warmth that Harry’s chest ached. He would have given anything for just one picture like that of his own mother.
The corner of Harry’s mouth quirked up at the unexpected joy of not being recognized, but before he could introduce himself, the door behind the shop counter slammed open.
Draco’s mouth crooked, and he looked down at the book as if Harry had just issued him a challenge. Harry made a mental note to dig out the few mystery novels that had really stumped him, and lend only those to Draco. Just thinking of how cross Draco would be if he couldn’t figure them out made Harry want to laugh. Chuckling silently, he picked up the mug from the table and gulped down the cold tea.
“No,” Harry said hoarsely. The floor felt unsteady beneath his feet. “I’m just so glad you’re here.”
“I’m falling in love with him,” Harry whispered. He rubbed a thumb absently across his sternum, and smiled a tiny smile that was just for Draco.
He shrugged unconcernedly, trying to distract Potter from the dreams he had just inadvertently revealed. The bloody Gryffindor would probably get as pushy as Maeve if Draco wasn’t careful.
do you know, Malfoy? Explain it to me,” Harry pleaded. Maybe he could give up on a carefree year, maybe he could get behind this, if only Malfoy would give him a good reason. If only Malfoy would trust him.
“Well. I – well, fuck.” The moment the word was out, Draco gasped, horrified with himself. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
“Do you think so?” Draco asked her now. “I’ve noted several recurring elements myself, but nothing seems to fit every incident. There’s always an outlier.”
As Hermione’s voice washed over them, blurring nonsensically in Harry’s ears, Draco swept the leaves into a neat pile. He plucked a single withered blossom from the mess, studying it intently.
A frantic looking twenty-something who’d been at a corner table all morning, flipping through several large textbooks and scribbling notes, almost burst into tears at the interruption. Maeve spoke quietly to him for a moment and slipped him a few brownies from her tray.
Draco’s pulse thundered in his ears and he felt himself growing faint. Then Potter gasped and his eyes snapped up to Draco’s.
All that pretty gold hair that Harry wants to bury his fingers in. Tug out the bun, watch it all spill out and tumble down.
They sat quietly for a time, as the sounds of the neighborhood waking up drifted in through the open window. Car doors slamming, the scrape of sleepy feet against the pavement, a child wailing, the clanging of pots in the restaurant below. And through it all, Harry caught warbles of birdsong, the melody a bright spot in the discordant noise of daily life. He strained to hear it, holding on to its simple beauty as he wrestled with how to begin.
After ducking his head into Draco’s empty workshop, Harry followed a faint rustling sound to the very back of Novelle’s storeroom. And there was Draco, sprawled on the floor and looking far less poised than Harry was used to. Legs splayed out in front of him, he was hunched over a small notebook, scribbling away with a cheap ballpoint pen. Dozens of metal cannisters littered the concrete floor around him, some tipped over and spilling out their precious tea leaves. Draco’s hair was mussed and there were ink stains on his fingers.
Today, Harry had walked Draco upstairs, deciding it was past time he wish Blaise well in person. He and Harry had never exactly been friendly, but Blaise was important to Draco, and so Harry wanted to make the effort. He’d actually quite enjoyed bantering with the two of them. Blaise had a rather wicked humor, startling in such a well-polished and poised man. But when Blaise had showed signs of tiring, Harry had politely excused himself, knowing the Slytherin would be reluctant to let his guard down so soon in front of Harry.
Harry was watching Malfoy carve delicate patterns into the stone around their fireplace (his eyes were so intently focused and his nose so adorably wrinkled that Harry was just standing there, frozen, trying to tamp down his big, soppy grin) when it happened.
Malfoy had stopped to watch him. When Harry met his eyes, Malfoy gave him an appraising look and nodded. “Coming?” he asked, then strode off without waiting for an answer.
Harry shook his head. He finished the slice of toast, then wriggled a little deeper into the sofa. He huffed grumpily as his neck bent in an unpleasant angle.
with each other, even late at night with only the moon and stars to overhear. They never spoke immediately, instead settling next to each other and adjusting to the strangeness of sharing the same space. Simple camaraderie did not come naturally to them; they were far too used to snarling at each other.
Malfoy had an open book in his lap, long fingers worrying the edges, but he wasn’t reading. His eyes were a fixed point on the flames he had built up at the lab table. There were no cauldrons there. Harry suspected Malfoy simply wanted the reassurance of a fire.
Sated now, drowsy and content with Draco’s legs tangled in his own, Harry had finally become curious about Draco and Hermione’s conversation.
There had been surprisingly little trouble after the incident three days ago, when he had chased after Malfoy and they had stumbled upon the Room of Requirement. Ron had been slightly gruff at lunch, but accepted Harry’s “
Draco had been gone long enough that Harry’s erection had subsided somewhat, when a bitter gust of wind howled by the window. The curtains billowed, and the resulting rush of freezing air raised goosebumps on Harry’s bare arms and feet. He scrambled for his wand and cast a hasty warming charm over himself, before shuffling to the foot of the bed to do the same for the plants strewn across the windowsill.
Draco’s sigh could almost have been mistaken for relief, if not for the touch of sadness at its edges. “You may have been right. I may not have – handled it well.”
But then he looked down at Draco – and once he regained the ability to breathe, he took a moment to thank the universe for past Harry and Draco’s lack of forethought.
When his eyes snapped open, Draco found himself atop soft green bedclothes, staring down at a very flushed, very naked Harry Potter.
Potter whirled to face him, and when he leaned casually against the counter, hands tight on its edge, something like disappointment flashed across his eyes.
“That reminds me!” Maeve exclaimed, dodging the question as she leapt off the stool as dramatically as an eighty-four-year-old woman could. “I want to give you your birthday present.”
Harry chuckled and pulled away. “Alright, darling,” he said, still hovering over Draco. “Maybe some other time.”
“Maybe it just wanted us to know that we need each other,” Harry said. “Maybe it was telling us that we belong together, despite all the things that always kept us apart.”
“It’s just – I was so alone, Harry. I needed you more than you could possibly imagine, more than I even understood. And I can’t help wondering – what if?” Draco clutched Harry to him almost desperately, his arms digging into Harry’s back. “We know the apparition is based on need. What if you only feel this way because it made you? What if this only happened because I so badly needed to be loved?”
one hundred and eleven years old,” Draco said, mind whirring as he absently returned the ice to his eye. He gnawed on his lip, trying to puzzle out what Maeve had just done.
“I don’t know,” Blaise mused, flipping through the pages with renewed interest. “I might not mind trying one. They
“You don’t ever have to go back to that,” Harry reminded him softly. “You’re a wildflower now, Draco. You can grow however you bloody well please.”
“You can’t rush art, Draco” Harry chided. He placed a purple polka-dotted mug on the shelf with an exaggerated flourish and tossed a wink at Draco over his shoulder.
Harry gave him a little squeeze and playfully bucked his hips against Draco’s. “Are you sure you’re too full to –”
“That’s a pretty big leap to make, Malfoy,” Harry grumbled. “Even if there is something wrong, it doesn’t mean it has anything to do with the flowers.”
“Perfect,” Lavender said, her grin widening until it was almost predatory. “I’ve been wanting another go against those kickboxing tricks for weeks. It’ll be
He hesitated for the space of a single heartbeat before crossing the flat and poking around the sofa cushions for the leather-bound book he had been writing in last night. Returning to the kitchen, he offered it to Harry, who took it with a perplexed expression. Draco chose not to explain, moving instead to plate the next course.
a year ago. I had just lost my magic, I hated myself more than ever, and I –” Draco shook his head. “I would not have been the best role model.”
“But aren’t all those needs as different as emotional and physical hurt?” Harry asked, face screwed up in confusion. He wasn’t as well versed in magical theory as Hermione and Draco, but he had understood Draco’s earlier argument.
When he finished, Harry didn’t pull back right away, his hand still cupping Draco’s as the other man gingerly flexed his fingers. Harry felt slightly dizzy, the air in the room pressing close.
If Harry was being honest, he’d have to admit that they probably didn’t need to be touching. The hooks were so averse to Draco that Harry’s spells should be safe as long as the two of them were in the same room. But Harry liked being so close to Draco, leaning together as if they were holding each other up.
Lacing their fingers, Harry let his arm settle into the dip of Draco’s waist, more than ready to drift off to sleep. Sunlight pooled around the open window, catching on the mound of pillows there and casting long shadows over the bed. A breeze stirred Draco’s hair and Harry breathed in deeply, relishing Draco’s subtle scent of springtime, budding flowers in the rain.
The words burst from them, almost overlapping. The idea crested the hill like a snowball, barreling downward and growing as it picked up speed.
Just then, Draco dipped a pinkie into a cauldron that was peach-colored and glistening. He brought the damp fingertip to his mouth and lightly sucked. Harry almost knocked over the rack of vials. He swallowed hard, desperate to moisten his suddenly dry throat. He had a vague idea that tasting potions wasn’t entirely safe, but he brushed it aside. Draco knew what he was doing.
“Yeah, the lightning one!” Harry exclaimed. A memory struck him then – Draco squirming in his chair at Novelle’s when Harry had asked about the name. Maeve’s wicked grin and teasing comments when Draco had tried to wave off the questions. A sudden suspicion began to dawn in Harry’s mind, heating his blood with its implications. “Wait – what’s the full name of it again?”
Bracing himself with an elbow against the bed, Harry took more of Draco, sinking down until Draco’s cock was nudging the roof of his mouth, dangerously close to his throat. Harry moaned again, the vibration making Draco’s stomach muscles clench and jump.
He had accepted the oddities and sadnesses of Draco’s life, never once looking at him with disgust or pity. Against all odds, Harry Potter had become a safe person to bare his heart to.
Harry had waved goodnight to Ron and Hermione, who were sitting by the fire, then trailed after Malfoy, eyes lingering on the tight fit of his trousers.
As the class went on, Draco warmed to the subject. He appeared intrigued, if skeptical, and Harry enjoyed catching him feverishly scribbling notes to himself and biting on the end of his quill.
“Draco, think about it,” he said, lightly shaking Draco’s shoulder. “The apparition has never done anything besides put us in the same place.”
Draco worked him through it, sucking and licking gently until Harry pulled away. Still leaning heavily against the wooden post, Harry melted to the ground in a slow, graceless slide.
By the end of the week, Harry had felt almost relaxed. Perhaps the danger was receding. Perhaps the flowers were winning their war.
Jaffey and the curse-breaker had been unable to stop the raging flames in time to save the flowers. They threw spell after spell at the conflagration, but nothing could quiet the blaze. Eventually, they had slapped up shield charms and simply waited it out.
Each meeting had been a spark, setting off a familiar itch, that old longing to dredge up the Marauder’s Map and pinpoint Malfoy’s dot. Of course, there was no Marauder’s Map of London, and so Harry’s questions had gone unanswered, his Draco Malfoy musings spiraling dizzily inside of him, bubbling over until Harry had to talk about him, just to let it all out. How had Harry not understood that when it was happening?
“Yeah,” said Harry, shivering even more now that his body was starting to warm. “That’s why I came too, sort of. I wanted to – to feel you, at least, if I couldn’t find you.”
but you shouldn’t make your decision based on me! And I am not saying you would, of course, but I do not want you to feel pressured to stay at Hogwarts just because I am –”
The words were like a balm to Draco’s heart. The promise of them took root inside of him, like a wildflower springing up at his very core.
“No, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes, but his blush deepened, spilling from his cheeks down his throat. “I was thinking about you, even though I knew I shouldn’t be.”
Harry tucked his hands behind his head and closed his eyes, thoughts straying, perhaps inevitably, to Draco.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco panted, biting his way down Harry’s neck. “Bloody indecent.” He pulled back, eyes glued to the hard planes of Harry’s chest as his hands smoothed over the sinfully tight emerald fabric.
Now that Harry was no longer in obvious distress, Malfoy’s expression was becoming distant and calculating, his mind already turning back to their mystery.
Harry’s stomach swooped at the sight, a rush of affection that left him lightheaded. Seeing Draco so absorbed, his grey eyes sparkling with intensity, was simply captivating. It was like watching innovation personified, idea after idea chasing their way across Draco’s face as clearly as cloud shadows moving over the Quidditch Pitch. Harry found himself lingering behind one of the large storage shelves, content for the moment to just admire Draco’s mind at work.
Harry approached cautiously and picked up her wand. He would have dropped it if he hadn’t been prepared for the familiar bite. He looked at Malfoy gravely and nodded.
Even a year ago, she had been patient. The war was won, but the losses had still been fresh in everyone’s minds. Harry had been preoccupied, assisting in rounding up the last Death Eaters, funding reparations of Hogwarts, speaking at Malfoy’s trial. There had been so much darkness, things were still so broken, that she did not begrudge Harry the comfort of fighting for some light. He needed something to protect, someone to save, and there was Draco Malfoy, still somewhat (un)happy, if grateful, to oblige. So when night after night, Harry whispered in the dark
Harry was momentarily distracted by the strangeness of that idea – worrying that Malfoy would help Harry, rather than hurt him – but impatiently brushed the thought aside.
rather handsome. Do you think a cloak like that might look good on me?” He ran a fingertip down Draco’s sternum.
“Alright, boys – up you get,” Maeve ordered. “Back to those chairs, please. I haven’t quite finished with you.”
Draco tensed, but then he shook his head and laughed bitterly. “Nothing. He didn’t speak, didn’t react to me at all. Just stared blankly ahead like a living corpse.” He sighed and rested his head against Harry’s. “I’ll never know if he was intentionally disavowing me or if his mind broke and he’s just – gone. I don’t even know which would be worse.”
“Oh, you don’t –” Draco floundered. Suddenly, he felt unable to look at her. “I assumed Har – I assumed Potter would have told you.”
Walking toward the door, his eyes snagged on a bright bit of color stuck to his bookshelf – yet another magical post-it note. How did Maeve keep getting those in here without him noticing?
“Harry,” Draco whispered, caressing Harry’s cheek. “I meant I’ve never done this with someone I love.”
Harry liked that, that Draco did not cringe away. That he accepted the horror of it, didn’t try to explain it away, didn’t demean it with empty words of comfort.
Malfoy laughed and swiped a hand over his face. Harry caught him staring at the glass-like flower they had found in the Room of Requirement, expression wistful.
,” he finished, slightly emphasizing the word brew. He glanced at his cauldrons, then gave Harry a smug, sideways look.
He reached out to catch one on the tip of his finger, but just before he could touch it, it flashed brightly and disappeared.
Harry gathered Draco into his arms, gently untangling Draco’s hand from his collar and pressing it against his own chest. “Shh,” he soothed, “it’s alright. Hold on a second.”
Draco blinked up at him from the floor, then stood with an unimpressed huff. Harry was already dragging the ladder away to better admire his shelf. Easier to focus on that than on Draco.
Draco spun in a slow circle, just as he had the first time he had seen Harry’s garden. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him, drunk on the sight of Draco lit from within, on the beauty of Draco illuminated by awe.
Bringing up the former classmate who had been viciously mauled during the Battle of Hogwarts was probably not the best entry point for their first discussion about the war.
“Yes?” He turned back to see Harry leaning against the table, eyes intent on Draco. A dusting of Floo powder escaped Draco’s fist, floating almost dreamily to the floor.
The comment had inspired Harry to bring up kickboxing, and he spent a long time explaining his progress with fusing Muggle and magical defensive techniques. McGonagall listened attentively, the gleam in her eyes growing sharper with Harry’s every word. When he finished, she conjured a pamphlet and presented it to him with a flourish. It had a glossy green cover, with the words
“Go again?” Will asked, already dropping into a perfect kick stance. Waggling his eyebrows, he held out a hand and beckoned to Harry.
Cool fingertips caressed Harry’s cheek, the touch cutting straight through the dull throbbing in his head. He groaned, choking slightly on the air he finally managed to suck into his aching lungs.
Madam Pomfrey bustled toward them and swept her wand in a wide arc. She made a snatching motion, and glowing blue symbols took shape, hovering over every inch of Harry’s skin. It was like what McGonagall had done to him after they tested the Death Eater wands, but infinitely more complex.
Draco wriggled in Harry’s arms, finally managing to flop onto his back to blink blearily up at Harry. “What?” he asked, pushing himself half upright with a sigh.
he said, depositing the pot and mugs onto the desk in front of Blaise. “Bold, notes of pepper and pine, lightly floral underneath.”
“He saved me, you know,” Draco said, like he was telling Harry a secret. “During those long weeks leading up to my trial. It was alright while I was still at Hogwarts. Working on the grounds was peaceful, and I was able to lose myself in it. But I was done there by the beginning of July, and I had nowhere to go. The Ministry would have allowed me to stay at the Manor, but I –” Draco shuddered – “I couldn’t. Blaise took me in, let me stay at his place in London. He was working long hours, so I wandered the city during the day, and he kept me from panicking at night.”
The fire crackled, its shadows dancing across Harry’s cheekbones. Draco wanted to touch him, longed to trace that dazzling smile with the tip of his finger, capturing the feel of it to keep safe inside his own beating heart.
Draco stepped back. With a wickedly brazen look, he began to unbutton his shirt. “Then take off your clothes.”
“McGonagall got in touch with a few research institutes,” Harry added. “A bunch of books and scrolls should be arriving tomorrow.”
He heard Malfoy shouting. He struggled to move his arms, trying to reach out to his former rival, but the air was rushing past too quickly and there was nothing to grab onto.
“Draco,” Blaise said. “It wasn’t like that. You know it wasn’t like that.” He sounded as close to pleading as Draco had ever heard him.
Harry watched as Malfoy consciously stilled his hands, then placed them atop his knees. After a short pause, he leaned in toward Harry. “I’m worried about what you found in the flowers. What if its infecting Hogwarts somehow? Spilling into the air and poisoning our magic?”
Kitchens were for families, for long meals and lazy conversation, for steaming drinks in the hush of the morning as the sun rose over the garden. They were for soups and pudding and laughter, for welcomes and late nights and warm goodbyes, for everything Harry couldn’t possibly imagine as a child, but somehow always missed. And even after a year in his cottage, even without Ginny in it, Harry still marveled at the joy of having a kitchen of his own.
– tore through Draco like a violent wind. Heat and shame, confusion and desire, swirled like eddies in his blood.
Draco coughed awkwardly, but when Harry glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, he caught a tiny smile.
And maybe that’s what their rivalry had been all along – Harry and Draco, all tangled up in each other without understanding why, lashing out to break what they could not solve.
“No,” Harry said, then frowned as he noticed a long, thin cylinder on the coffee table. “What’s that?”
“Go to bed, Lovegood,” he drawled, voice only slightly muffled by Harry’s jumper. “You’re tired, remember?”
“Harry,” Draco said. His voice was tinged with wonder, bathing Harry in a golden light. “Will you teach me Sentiomancy?”
“I expected you much sooner, young man,” Maeve scolded, but her eyes were still twinkling. “Now come over here and have some of the treacle tart that’s waiting for you.”
still a wizard, damn it, and Harry was going to prove it to him. If the public could get used to Harry Potter in their midst, then they could also adapt to the presence of a repentant Malfoy.
“ – because you know perfectly well that I am on probation. A single Dark spell, Merlin, even a slightly murky one, would be enough to land me in Azkaban!”
Harry trailed his tongue over Draco’s hip, slowly easing him onto his back. He crawled between Draco’s legs and began to massage his thighs. Dropping his head, Harry teased Draco’s half-hard cock with the warmth of his breath.
An awkward silence buzzed between them as Draco continued to methodically sort through his bottles. Harry scraped a trainer against the tile, suddenly uncertain.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed, the usually soft grey hardening to steel. He slowly rose to his feet. “Of course. I should have known. The minute I refuse to bow down to Saint Potter’s every wish, I’m back to being Death Eater scum. Good enough to sneak around with past midnight, like some kind of cheap whore, but Merlin forbid I have my own opinion every once in a while!”
Harry laughed at that, but soon sobered. He looked almost hurt. “They’re not your only friends, you know,” he said softly. “You have me, too.”
Malfoy scowled at him, but there was something fretful beneath the bluster. His eyes widened slightly as Harry approached him, and he darted a nervous glance around the room before resolutely turning his attention to his wounded hand.
“Well, there you go,” Maeve said easily. “You know what they say – don’t geld your unicorn trying to win a race with a thestral.”
Blaise had been stubbornly silent on the walk through London, leaving Draco with nothing to do but fret. And this morose little café was not helping, all metal and monochrome, the walls decorated with jagged shards of mirrors. Likely meant to be hip and sleek, it was failing miserably, the room a dull blur of winter colors, as if it had been infected by the wet, grey streets outside.
“I’m going to miss you, too.” Maeve squeezed his hand before releasing him, then patted him on the knee. “We’ll visit. I want you to meet Madelyn, and I won’t survive a year without a fresh cup of your
Wand still pointed at Harry’s throat, Malfoy pressed in even closer, eyebrows quirking in playful challenge. Harry forgot how to breathe.
“Hmm?” Harry breathed, rocking his head from side to side to encourage Draco to continue the massage.
“Oh,” Ginny breathed, tracing a finger over the laces of her trainers. “That makes sense, I guess. But like you said, it’ll just take time. You just have to show him you mean it.”
“Don’t be.” Draco blinked back the beginnings of tears. His expression hardened as he placed his arms over Harry’s where they were hugging his waist. “Lucius Malfoy made his choices. And he has no claim on me, not anymore.”
Draco’s hand had moved of its own volition. Balled in a fist beneath his sternum, it pressed against the spot where his magic waited, locked away and languishing.
Too much sugar in his tea. A thousand questions. Feverish intensity in his eyes. A steadying hand when Harry overtaxed himself. Careful penmanship. The way he lingered over letters to his mother. Sharp retorts and playful smirks and a shudder of displeasure the one time he’d dipped his feet into the chill waters of the lake. Potion ingredients. Musty old textbooks. Long sleeves hiding all the creamy skin Harry was so desperate to see. Regrets. Scars. That sweet smile Harry could only tease out of him very late at night. Tendrils of blond hair escaping his bun, glowing in the moonlight. Long, clever fingers wrapped around a wand. Flowers. The frown he made when he was thinking. The smell of fresh soil. His face lit up with discovery. How well he listened, whenever Harry needed to speak.
Malfoy had insisted they meet well before breakfast, to avoid any awkward questions about what they were doing, though Harry wasn’t convinced anyone would care what they got up to with these unusual blooms. The rest of the castle seemed to regard them as no more than a pleasing decoration, if they paid them any mind at all.
Pulse still racing, Draco shook his head wryly at himself and headed to his wardrobe to peel off his wet shirt. His skin was uncomfortably clammy, but somehow he didn’t think that was what had woken him. Sleep clung to his limbs, plaguing each step with a heaviness that refused to relent, even as Draco came more fully awake. He felt off-balance and uneasy, as if the ground were a wild animal that might buck beneath his feet at any moment.
“To disguise the taste of poison?” Harry asked impishly. He clambered upright and stretched, his shirt riding up to reveal a tantalizing glimpse of his bare stomach.
Maeve pressed the bandages into his hands. “I’m sure you are,” she said. She smiled encouragingly at Harry, but there was something melancholy in her eyes. “It would be better if you didn’t offer. It’ll ease my mind if you’ll help him with the bandages, though. He won’t get them tight enough on his own.”
“You were stunning,” Draco breathed, the words far too honest with Weasley standing right there. Draco’s face burned, and Harry’s eyes flickered to his mouth.
“It’s everything I’ve ever wanted,” Draco whispered. “And I keep waiting for you to take it all away.”
All too soon, they had left for Novelle’s, walking silently hand-in-hand through the bitterly cold streets. The others had arrived at the shop before them, and so they were greeted with a raucous chorus of shouts and hellos that Draco found unsettling. The mood was distressingly cheerful, as if their friends thought they were attending a party, rather than bearing witness to a potentially life-altering (and untested) magical procedure.
“I did it for me,” he said, meeting Draco’s eyes. “I promise, I chose for me. It’s what I want. But I knew, that wherever you went, I would still want this too.” He gestured between them, then clasped Draco’s hand. “I knew I would still want
“Draco, this is –” Harry shook his head, then took another long swallow. “It – it’s warm, and earthy. Like sun on the soil. And there’s this sharpness to it, sort of, like underneath the earthiness. It’s almost too much, but –” Another pause, another sip. Harry seemed to be holding the tea in his mouth. “There’s this bright burst of flavor, like summer berries. The really good ripe ones, when it’s almost fall. And it’s only an aftertaste. But it makes the sharpness… perfect, somehow.”
Hermione eyes flashed. She picked up her cup and sipped, gaze never leaving Draco. “I know,” she assured him, somehow conveying her understanding that they were no longer just talking about Harry, but about Draco as well.
By the time they reached the Weasleys’ back door, Harry’s fingers were throbbing. Draco had been tightly clutching his hand the entire way through town.
As they moved together, cocks rubbing against each other in an agonizingly slow slide, Harry felt his magic building inside him, flush against his skin, begging to be released.
He broke the kiss and lowered his head to Draco’s nipple. Draco collapsed back against the pillows, trembling with need.
Draco felt a flash of anger. “How can you say that to me?” he spat, but the rage quickly gave way to incredulity. “I made all the wrong choices. You made all the right ones, and you still carry guilt. Harry, your nightmares –” Draco hissed in a breath, cutting himself off.
Harry hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he should push this, especially here in the common room. Maybe if he could get Draco alone…
Harry had thought that the diagnostic spells would be beyond him, but they were easy enough to perform. The real trick was learning how to read them, though he was sure Hermione could have fit one more book into her magically expanded purse to give them a quick reference guide. He chuckled lightly to himself, then sighed.
Draco sat on the bed and continued his ministrations, smoothing the cloth over Harry’s hips and stomach. His other hand massaged Harry’s scalp.
McGonagall was in the corner, engaged in an animated dialogue with Tahlyn. The Healer looked exhausted. Her normally rich brown skin was dull and lifeless, and the circles beneath her eyes stood out like bruises. Clutching the wrist of her wand-arm, she seemed to be keeping pace with McGonagall’s rapid-fire queries, but she winced with every slight movement she attempted.
“Sure,” Harry said. He still sounded confused, but he gulped down some water, then stood and walked to the center of the clearing.
and was part of the scheme. He wanted to drink tea with him in the morning and trace pathways of desire over his skin at night and while away their days with silly arguments.
“I was thinking, while you were asleep,” Harry continued, “about all the ways you could have died in the war, about how I
As Harry shuffled toward him, Draco’s face lit up. Harry reached out to tuck a stray piece of hair behind his ear, and Draco leaned into the touch, closing his eyes and smiling.
Harry stood in the stone entryway, snow rapidly melting into a puddle around his feet. Draco’s distant tone felt like rough glass against his skin, but he was so relieved to have finally found him that he welcomed the cut.
A breeze blew in through the open windows, and the billowing curtains snapped unheeded at the very edge of Harry’s focus. His world had narrowed to encompass only Draco. He was as unaware of Hermione’s presence as if she were no longer in the room.
And when Draco put together a simple meal of chicken and salad, Harry thanked him warmly and accepted the “potion” without argument.
Draco’s eyes darted around the square again, as he struggled to think of a way to extricate himself from this mortifying situation. He had just about settled on forcing out a polite
“I just liked the looks of him, is all,” Maeve said. She bustled around him to fetch their scones out of the oven. The shortbread was already cooling on the counter.
.” The last word was a seductive growl. He gave Harry’s cock one last squeeze before removing his hand.
Catching a whiff of mint, Draco chuckled softly. The smell was decidedly out of place in the heavy heat of the day, but Maeve started her Christmas baking experiments earlier every year, and Draco knew he would soon have the pleasure of sampling her increasingly intricate concoctions.
“Bloody useless then,” Harry muttered. “Constant vigilance, my arse. Moody must be spinning in his grave.”
The second it was done, Harry blanched. This was exactly the kind of thing Draco was begging him not to do. He shook his head, then fished the last few bowls out of the sink. In a daze, he dried the rest of the equipment and put it away.
But most of all, Draco liked the crooked and the broken – piles of withered petals littering the ground, a tree with dying limbs, a patch of delicate snowdrops that twisted themselves unnaturally to reach for the sun, vines that had fallen from the trellis and still flourished on the ground. These were the things that Draco stopped for, crouching down and peering at them from all angles as something like pride flashed across his face. He touched them gently, running a reverent fingertip over their imperfections, and Harry understood that Draco was honoring their persistence, taking a moment to acknowledge and applaud their defiant strength.
“I –” Harry shook his head. He abruptly stopped walking and kicked at the stone of the wall halfheartedly. “Distract me,” he mumbled.
“You don’t know,” Malfoy repeated, voice flat and dangerous. But then his eyes darkened and he ducked his head. Quietly, he said, “It doesn’t matter, Potter. It’s not like I haven’t heard those things said before.”
Draco murmured a spell to dry the ink on the tea tin he had just labeled and shoved it into his back pocket, taking the opportunity to admire Harry.
Harry chuckled and carefully looked around himself before bending over again. His fingers had just closed around the foam football he’d been using as a makeshift Quaffle when a shriek rang out across the lawn. Harry stifled a curse as he looked up to see two of his other charges about to collide. Shifting automatically into a dueling stance, Harry pointed his wand and froze their brooms in place. Both girls shrieked again at the abrupt stop, and though one managed to adjust, the other toppled off her broom. Unfazed, she quickly bounced to her feet and shot an irritated look at Harry. He shrugged at her unapologetically and waved his wand a second time, freezing all of the other brooms. Most of the children tumbled to the ground, but the grass was soft and the brooms had a maximum flight height of two feet, so Harry wasn’t worried about anyone getting hurt.
“Probably,” Malfoy said unapologetically, then made his way over to sit across from Harry. He tucked his legs beneath him neatly and smoothed down his robes. “How else will we ever figure this out? It’s important, Potter.”
Draco pushed himself against the back of the sofa, his body wanting to flee, his mind not understanding how.
“Oh.” Harry was a little surprised, but it wasn’t like that was something to be embarrassed about. Plenty of wizards didn’t apparate. “Well, you’re not missing much,” he confided, “even if you never want to learn after all this. I kind of hate it.”
Harry had always thought of grey as a cold color – harsh, untouchable – but in the moment before Malfoy scrambled out from under him, Harry looked into his surprisingly lovely eyes, and all he could think of was the coziness of his cottage beneath the grey sky of a gathering storm.
Draco shook his head. “There’s nothing more to do until morning. I just began a new batch. It takes ten hours for the flowers to distill into the base liquid.”
“You don’t sound very sure about that.” The woman raised her eyebrows skeptically. “And you’re not wearing any shoes.”
“Nope.” Weasley leaned forward, peering down at the children, now arranged in neat lines on the red mat. A lithe blonde woman, hair in a sleek bun, was leading them through a series of kicks and punches.
Nothing good had ever come of someone pointing their wand at Draco, after all, and he was not surprised to find himself faintly sick at the thought of it.
“I’m glad the apparition thing forced us together, and it’s been really helpful a few times, when we’ve been hurt or upset – but I guess I just wish we could have found each other some other way,” Harry admitted. “I don’t want Draco to doubt me – or himself.”
Every eighth year was instantly alert, wands drawn and pointed as they sprinted toward the last cottage in the row. Harry and Malfoy reached it first, having been closest, but the others were not far behind. They stopped dead, unable to make sense of what they saw.
“It seems to me that you should just – let it happen.” Maeve waved a hand in the air lackadaisically, then stood and began to move Draco’s other doughs into the fridge. “It might very well be a sign from the universe, and when the universe is giving you signs, you should listen.”
“No, Draco, I get it.” Harry blew out a bemused breath. “I was so afraid when this started, so tired of fighting. But now – it’s like the flowers are ours, you know?”
Her ferocity made Harry’s heart clench. “I have a friend,” he said. “Well, actually he’s my boyfriend –” Harry glanced nervously at Andie, but she seemed nonplussed. “He’s really good at Potions, and he’s trying to invent different ways of brewing, that use ingredients like herbs and plants, instead of pieces of bugs and animals.”
But Malfoy wasn’t here. And this, Harry was sure (if he could confirm what he was beginning to suspect), would light Malfoy up again. Harry wanted to give him that – a peace offering, of sorts. Something to make the other man curious, a new question to make him smile.
Harry had no reason to believe that the feeling of a wizard’s magic would reflect their emotions – in all likelihood, Malfoy’s magic always fizzled, whether he be content, heartbroken, or furious – but Harry couldn’t help the swirl of hope that danced through his chest. Malfoy had let him in, and his magic felt welcoming. Surely that meant everything would be alright?
Harry hauled himself off the sofa, flipping through various possibilities in his mind. He could trip over something, fall to the floor. Or go out to the garden. Taming the weeds was surely more than a one-man job.
. I’m sweaty and disgusting because I fell asleep in the sun after taking a longer run than usual, not because I’m out of my mind with grief, alright? I’m sorry I haven’t talked to you, I was just – well, I don’t really know what, but I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Because you’ve been beating me at physical magic for years, Potter,” he drawled out, as if this should have been obvious to Harry. “It’s not about your brain. Remember our first flying lesson? Do keep up.”
Suddenly, the shears clattered against the windowsill. Draco clasped his hands together and wrenched his body away from the plants. He walked along the lab table, rummaging in its drawers until he found a bundle of matches. He attempted to strike one, but was now trembling so badly that he dropped it on the floor.
“Don’t you play coy with me, Draco Malfoy,” she’d barked, shockingly commanding for someone who was busy tying a flowered pink scarf around her hair. “I’m not some flutter-brained girl child you can confound with your posh manners and polite refusals. I am well aware that you know your way around a kitchen and it’s about time you had some say in this one. Now roll up your sleeves and get your hands in that butter!”
“Oh,” Draco breathed. He finally met Harry’s eyes. “I treated you rather poorly last night. I – I thought you might want to shout at me.” He cringed slightly, but kept his gaze on Harry.
Lavender pushed up on her elbows. Despite a bit of blood trickling from her mouth, she was grinning.
“Well what are you still doing here, then?” Maeve cried. “Don’t you keep that young man waiting, Draco.”
Draco cut himself off with a gasp, hand clawing at the collar of his shirt. When he finally looked up at Harry, his pupils were blown wide with panic. “Harry, do you – do you think the potion will stop working? If the flowers aren’t – I mean, the – the blood tie – it – Merlin, Harry, we need – we need to –”
Malfoy cocked his head and stared off over Harry’s shoulder, mind obviously whirring. “Yes, though ‘clean up’ is really too simplistic a phrase to apply to –”
“It’s alright. Draco, you’re ok. It was just a nightmare. You’re safe, I promise. I’m here with you. It’s ok.”
Draco gasped and rolled onto his back, shifting away from Harry. He rested his book on his stomach and struggled to catch his breath.
Harry only asked twice, once on the night Draco got his magic back, when they were almost asleep and curled together in Draco’s bed, and once over breakfast, the morning after Maeve severed the apparition bond. Both times, Draco’s eyes had gone very soft, before he breathed out a hesitant
“It wasn’t – fun.” Harry sighed, keeping hold of Draco’s hand. “I cast the spells, over and over, in a kind of rotation. I thought I might need to saturate the area. That’s why I kept going back, in case it needed to build up.”
That wasn’t unexpected, exactly. Harry had known that, definitively, about past Draco, but his heart drooped a little all the same. “Why?” he asked.
“And this isn’t pushing me?” Draco laughed incredulously, waving a hand toward the testimonials in Harry’s lap.
Harry briefly wondered why Declan was not at Hogwarts, but had decided not to ask. There was something subtly
But there he’d stood, self-possessed and smirking in Harry’s kitchen, exuding an almost haughty confidence as he asked Harry to walk him home. It had been almost ridiculous, the arrogant manner clashing sharply with his threadbare pajama bottoms and the pale white of his bare feet splayed against the wooded floor. Still though, Harry had welcomed the echo of the boy Draco had once been. Harry liked the un-gelled hair and the new softness in his eyes, but a Draco Malfoy without a bite was just plain wrong.
Draco’s touch was light at first, his strokes tentative, but he soon found a rhythm. He worked his hand over Harry’s cock, thumb swiping across the head gently on each upstroke, just the right amount of pressure.
Draco’s throat hurt. Tears were welling up there, and he was struggling to push them back down. He would not cry in front of Potter. Not again. Not after Potter had – had –
Draco exhaled in a messy rush. He pressed a fingertip to Harry’s name, then swept it reverently upward to touch the sentence about getting a drink. He felt untethered, as if he were floating toward the ceiling, a buoyant joy filling him up, even as a part of him mourned what could have been.
“Yes.” A wide smile bloomed across Malfoy’s face. He stood up and resettled himself next to Harry on the bed, crossing his legs beneath him and leaning forward. “I certainly do.”
Draco didn’t want to pressure Harry, but he also desperately wanted him to know that he could talk to Draco, whenever and however he needed to, that he didn’t ever need to hide behind a façade or pretend he wasn’t still hurting.
Draco gave the cloth one last swipe across Harry’s chest, then discarded it on the bedside table. He stayed upright, but braced his back against the headboard, fingers still tangled in the hair at Harry’s nape. “I’ve been re-reading the description of
Harry’s entire side was pressed against Draco’s, and one of his hands had come to rest against Draco’s thigh. The edges of the room seemed impossibly distant, the entire world going blank, until nothing existed but Harry. Blood pounded in Draco’s temples, the tension spilling out into the air, a deafening silence, bright and shadowed all at once.
“It made me wonder about the other flowers. I think Hogwarts might be trying to tell us something. Something feels… wrong.” Malfoy trailed off, biting his lip.
Harry yelped as Draco’s grip tightened further. Draco kissed him once atop his head, almost violently, and then released him.
“It’s just – frustrating,” he admitted. “Hogwarts created a magic so strong that it lasts beyond its vessel’s death, and I can’t –” Draco gestured vaguely at the air. He sighed, dropping his hand. “I want to see what you see.”
It kept Harry sharp, invigorated him while quieting his mind, and it did not exact the steep price of actual war. No violence, no uncertainty; just physical challenge and a slowly dawning peace. He was grateful for it, and grateful for Lavender, despite the fact that on days like this, when the empty hours stretched out before him, it didn’t feel like quite
It was no wonder really, that as soon as Jaffey and her partner disappeared, Draco had sprinted across the field and dropped to his knees amongst the dead flowers.
Draco rocked his hips, his cock sinking a little deeper with every thrust, and by the time he bottomed out, Harry had wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, tilting his arse up to take everything Draco could give him.
Harry worked Draco open slowly, eyes flitting between Draco’s stretched rim and the blissful expressions chasing across Draco’s face. Watching his finger disappear into Draco was the most erotic thing he’d ever seen, but it was the evidence of Draco’s pleasure that really made Harry start to come undone. He captured Draco’s mouth, their breaths mingling as Harry’s hips jerked, dragging his cock along Draco’s thigh.
“No,” Draco admitted. Somewhat abashed, he averted his eyes. “It didn’t seem as important as… everything else,” he finished lamely. “The apparition isn’t so bad, really.”
Under Draco’s words, an unpleasant sound began to build, one that Harry felt more than heard. A grating buzz, it vibrated through the air, like splinters being shoved beneath his fingernails, a spike in his brain. Instinctively, Harry looked to the flowers.
Draco’s smile widened into a yawn, and he wriggled down the bed until he was lying on his side. Harry pulled up the covers, then took Draco into his arms, tucking his knees behind Draco’s.
Draco’s eyes skittered nervously around the entryway before finding Harry, but when Harry made to follow, Molly flapped a hand at him dismissively, calling out over her shoulder that he should join the others in the living room.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face and got up to pour himself another glass of lemonade. Draco shook his head when Harry gestured questioningly at the other cup.
Despite the lengthy argument Harry had instigated last night, Draco had been adamant that Harry would stay behind at Hogwarts.
“You know me so well,” Harry said, and the words sounded like a question, a hint of amazement tinging the warmth of his voice.
They were well and truly tangled up in this thing, and the taste of Harry’s name on his tongue could hardly make the inevitable loss any
Harry sighed into the silence, then bit his lip, looking abashed. When he glanced back up at Draco, his eyes had lost some of their light. Draco felt his nails bite into his palms and forced himself to unclench his fingers.
McGonagall smiled. “Seeing magic, as you say, is the most basic level of Aperiomancy. What you are doing is much more advanced. Auror Driffield didn’t explain this in class?”
“As if the Room thought it had answered our question,” Draco mused, curiosity at last overcoming some of his fear. “My question.
McGonagall glared at him disapprovingly from where she knelt at his side. “Well, I believe a visit to the hospital wing is in order, Mr. Potter,” she huffed.
Harry coaxed Draco out of hiding with a few well-chosen words about what he’d like to do to him when he got him alone. Draco’s eyes darkened and he dragged Harry off to bed. He made a valiant effort to ignore Zabini’s surreptitious thumbs up, but Harry caught his tiny smile all the same.
There were no towels in the unfinished cottage, so they sacrificed Harry’s t-shirt, cleaning themselves off as best they could before beginning to dress.
Harry wanted to reach out and take his hand, entwine their fingers and soothe away Draco’s pain. But he didn’t think Draco would welcome the touch. So he decided instead, to return the trust Draco was offering, to honor Draco’s admission with one of his own.
The conversation turned to other things, and when Harry brought up how much he had enjoyed the cooking workshop, Draco waxed rhapsodic over Harry’s apple pie for so long and with such conviction that Harry found himself blushing furiously.
Harry followed as Draco took a seat at one of the stools by the counter. He wasn’t sure if he’d be welcome to join Draco, so he settled for hovering over his shoulder.
“Obviously.” Draco forced the word out through clenched teeth, facing away from Blaise. “But not today.”
As soon as he stepped into the kitchen, Draco became aware that something had shifted. The air was charged with a new stillness, something coiled in wait.
The intensity of Draco’s thought seemed to coalesce into a living, breathing thing, hovering in the air around him. His fingers twitched at his sides as his eyes darted around the board, identifying and rejecting countless strategies before every move. Harry watched as the question of how to salvage Luna’s game set Draco’s blood on fire, and he marveled at the fierce beauty of this man he had once despised.
The sound of Harry’s chair hitting the floor again was shockingly loud in the sudden silence. Draco flinched, and slowly pushed his own chair back, away from Harry.
“Maeve?” he asked, suddenly feeling brave. “Do you think it would be alright if I used some floo powder? There’s a call I should have made days ago.”
Eventually, their talk strayed to the Room of Requirement strangeness, as they rehashed the episode for what felt like the hundredth time. While Harry was certain the answer lay within the particular combinations of memories the Room had cobbled together for them, Draco stubbornly insisted that the multicolored lights were the key. Why else would the same colors have been reflected in the flowers on the cliffside?
Draco flinched, his gut aching as if he’d taken the blow himself. Harry stayed down longer this time, the pause feeling like an eternity to Draco, though it must have been only a few seconds, at most. Harry sprung up then, and Draco let out the breath he had been holding.
Draco’s voice was not hollow, but in it, Harry heard the echo of empty rooms. He pictured Draco’s flat, small and worn and meticulously cared for, as isolating as Harry’s cottage.
Harry rubbed a hand across his eyes, hoping Ron, Luna, and Hermione were too wrapped up in their conversation to notice. His other hand snuck into his pocket, fingertips running over the smooth stones from the lake shore.
True, a few heads had turned when they’d reached the main stretch of Diagon, but Harry had distracted Draco with questions about winter teas, and no one had actually bothered them. Draco spoke liltingly of mint and cinnamon, and he had relaxed a bit more with every step.
“It’s the way you think, the way you talk about magic. Your messy hair and white mugs in the morning but colorful at night. The tired energy of you, after a run. Always a contradiction.” Draco’s eyes glowed as he spoke, every word suffused with reverence. “Your overgrown garden and the way you look when you duel. How you treat Maeve, and your friends, and Blaise, even though he stole your girlfriend. The way you listen. How you give yourself over to simple things. The softness of your smile.”
“It was supposed to wear off after a week,” he said, leaning back and crossing one ankle over the other.
“He talks about you,” Weasley said. “You and your tea shop. Mum’s been hinting that he should bring you by.”
Yes, the orange light was messy and chaotic, spiraling erratically through the other lights. And yes, it had attached itself to the life-debts, fusing into the dark blue and gold beams in countless places, until it was impossible to discern where it ended and they began.
Harry stepped out of the shower, shaking off his melancholy as he toweled himself dry. Things were good between him and Draco, so very good, and there was no need to rush.
“We don’t have to – er, do anything,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. But as his embarrassment faded, his eyes went soft. “I just want to wake up with you tomorrow.”
Malfoy jumped so dramatically that he dropped his book. Harry stooped down to retrieve it and held it out to him. Malfoy just stared at Harry for a second, but then he adjusted the collar of his jumper and carefully accepted the book.
The sky grew lighter, the morning sun spilling in through Potter’s overlarge windows. Draco spun the silver ring on his finger, restless circles to match his racing heart.
It was a display of raw, unfettered Hogwarts magic the likes of which they had never seen. It should have been beautiful, wondrous even. But it wasn’t.
The visiting healer had treated him with the same polite firmness as she had everyone else, though she did stumble over her words the few times she had worked with Harry directly.
But the longer Harry waited, the longer Draco spent alone and hurting, and it was that thought that became the push Harry needed. He squared his shoulders, gave himself a little shake, and rapped firmly on the door.
And as the initial thrill of discovery faded, questions began to prick at Draco’s skin, shrouding him in a sudden doubt.
“S’alright, mate,” Ron said quickly. He leaned back in his chair and hooked his hands behind his head. Whether to appease Harry with a more relaxed pose or as an excuse to escape Hermione’s prodding, Harry wasn’t sure. “You listen to the Cannons game last night?”
“I’m happy to,” Hermione said breezily. “These kinds of magical problems are fascinating, aren’t they?”
“Maeve knew who I was too, didn’t she?” Harry asked in sudden realization. “She asked me my name, the first time we met, and I was so excited not to be recognized.” He huffed out a bemused breath, rubbing his neck sheepishly.
Potter seemed to take it for embarrassment and hurried to reassure him. “I haven’t, not in weeks. I never really liked apparition much anyway, but now –” he trailed off with a shrug. “You should have woken me. I could have gotten you a pillow, at least.”
“But,” Harry said, scrunching up his face wryly, “McGonagall knows enough about my past, er – actions, that I understand why she was worried about that.”
“I would never dare burgle from you!” Harry protested, laughing. Somehow, he felt as though he’d known Maeve for far longer than he actually had. “Hello, Maeve,” he added. “It’s lovely to see you again.”
“No,” Harry answered, with a cautious smile. “Their magic is entirely separate from the darkness I felt. I’m sure of it.”
“I do,” Draco was quick to say. “But Harry, we don’t have to – that’s not why I – this potion, I mean – I didn’t mean to pressure you. I don’t have to top, ever, not if you don’t want me like that.”
Below them, the flowers in Draco’s cauldrons shed the last of their petals, and in the early dawn light, the potions began to glow.
Ginny shrugged, wiping crumbs from her hands after her final bite of one of the mini-pies Molly had sent home with Harry yesterday. “I don’t know how Blaise got Malfoy to drink it, but I just popped in one day when I knew you’d be at kickboxing and poured it into the milk jug. You never changed the wards. It wasn’t hard.”
“I’m lying down this time, though,” Malfoy continued, seemingly unperturbed by Harry’s silence. He tossed a pillow to Harry and snuggled into the blankets. “My neck still aches.”
“Er – alright,” Harry said, brow wrinkling. Then he shrugged and smiled at Ginny. “I’m happy for you, Gin. Blaise seems like a really decent bloke.”
“There’s something off about the color, too,” Draco added, “but I cannot quite place it. Not just those strange lights. Something else.”
“I was not finished, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said firmly. She huffed out a breath and pinned them both with a heavy stare. “The war is over. I see that you two have overcome your rivalry and made amends. Something that was long overdue, I might add.” She raised an eyebrow.
Warmth suffused Draco, as if he were the one with his head in the flames. “I’m sure your bride would be quite unimpressed,” he drawled, trying to hide how pleased he was by the compliment.
Tightening his hand on Draco’s hip, Harry rubbed his half-hard cock against Draco’s thigh. Wanting to hear Draco come undone before he indulged himself, Harry stifled a moan.
“Mmm,” Draco breathed. “I like that it’s simple, in a way. The minions of the Dark Lord, they’re not human. They were created, bred from the evils of the world, specifically to serve the darkness. It’s easy to root against them – without having to wonder what hurts they have at home.”
He removed Harry’s glasses, carefully placing them on the windowsill before kissing him again. Harry opened his mouth, and Draco swept his tongue inside.
True, Harry had been ready to crawl out of his skin even before they shut themselves in Malfoy’s room that night, and the hours since had done nothing to calm his nerves.
Harry collapsed to the floor and felt it give slightly beneath him. With a wide grin of satisfaction, he wiped the sweat from his brow and took a healthy gulp from a water bottle. His permanent cushioning charms were functioning perfectly. Anyone could fall from the rafters in this room now and suffer nothing more serious than a bruise.
“That’s strange.” Draco frowned, faintly disturbed by that fact. “Were you thinking about me?” he asked, trying to rationalize it.
Another jab and another pulse. The heat was more intense this time, just enough to be uncomfortable.
The water spluttered, slowing to a trickle before gushing from the showerhead in an unpleasantly cold rush. Draco hit his head against the tiles, muttering crossly to himself and reaching for the soap. Served him right, moping about in the shower because he didn’t have the backbone to confide in his oldest friend. He deserved this freezing water.
“Hmm,” Draco breathed. “Calming draught, with just a touch of dreamless sleep. A restorative, of sorts.”
“Want to come through?” Harry asked. “I made lemonade, and we’ll probably have enough time to do some notes.”
Unperturbed, Draco set down a plate of toast and a steaming mug of tea on the coffee table in front of Harry, before wedging himself into the opposite corner of the sofa.
Draco rolled his eyes. Without a word, he took the book from Blaise, shuffled to a bookmarked page, and set it back down. Pushing it toward Blaise, he tapped his finger against a very particular section and waited for his friend to read.
Harry’s hips snapped forward more quickly now, until he was fucking into Draco, gasping raggedly each time Draco tightened his lips.
what I do. With tea and Potions and everything. But I’m aware that we’re very different people, so perhaps that’s not as helpful as I thought it might be when I started.” Draco cringed. “Sorry.”
Harry had hung back, flying in lazy arcs and giving Draco space. He had watched him though, and Draco felt his attention with a burning intensity that reminded him of being on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch. The nostalgia was intoxicating, and soon enough Draco had launched himself directly at Harry, setting off a chaotic chase that left them both breathless with laughter. They hadn’t played any kind of seeker game, but Draco hoped that they might, someday soon.
Harry felt himself lean into the touch, smiling to hear Malfoy’s words echoing his own thoughts. But then he shook Malfoy off, unwilling to be distracted further. He held up a hand with a gentle “shhh.”
“As for students,” McGonagall continued brusquely, “you should speak to a Slytherin third-year named Evan Thornguilde. He will be in the library with a Charms study group until noon. You should have time to speak with him before Professor Sprout finishes with Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco snapped the metal storage containers shut and hurried into the back room to put them away. Maeve did not follow him, but her voice did, the words nipping at his heels like a stubborn dog.
Propping one foot against it, Harry leaned back indolently and grinned at Draco. “Because…” he prompted, rolling his hand in a
Draco had leaned into Harry, expression far softer than it had been the night before, and touched his cheek. “Thank you, for offering. I know how hard it would be for you to go there, to see the place where Sirius was held captive for so long.”
Lips pursed, Draco hesitated. He pressed a thumb into his faded Dark Mark, hard enough that he could feel the pulse pounding in his wrist. Finally, he glanced sideways at Harry’s hopeful face and nodded his agreement.
His surprise made no sense – it’s not like Blaise would be at the Burrow without Ginny – but still, her voice sent a jolt through Harry. He wiped his suddenly damp palms on the back of his jeans and made his way over to where she was perched on the stairs.
Things progressed rapidly after that, pieces darting around the board, striking and falling in patterns too complex for Harry to parse. Eventually, he stopped trying to follow the game and just watched Draco.
Malfoy bit his lip and looked away. His fingers tightened on his elbows. “And it took you five days to come to this conclusion?” His voice cracked on the number.
“Yes, or a scarf, or an odd piece of advice, and they would be so baffled that they would just start the lesson.”
A bathroom, Malfoy slashed to pieces and bleeding on the floor. A boy with tears in his eyes. Afraid. Alone. And no one to help him. Not even Harry.
Draco glanced up into the swaying tree branches. He took a deep breath before looking straight at Harry. “I apologize for my behavior earlier,” he said. He had gone stiff again, like when Hermione had first arrived, but the words were earnest. He blanched, then continued forlornly. “Granger must have been mortified.”
As he stepped out from the shadow of the shelf, Harry’s trainers scraped against the rough concrete of the floor. Draco startled at the sound, then frowned down at where his pen had torn the page before his eyes found Harry.
Back turned, Draco spoke in a flat voice. “I delivered the wands safely to the Headmistress. She expects us to meet her by the Forest tomorrow at noon.”
Even as he stiffened, Draco clutched desperately at Harry’s shirt, burying his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. Draco’s breathing was harsh, but he was very still, and Harry wasn’t sure if he was crying.
Framed by the doorway, Draco was a masterpiece of sleek lines and chiseled angles, statuesque and perfectly poised. The stone-grey suit and purple waistcoat fit him even better than Harry remembered, the fabric snug against those taut muscles that Harry’s fingers now knew so well.
Nothing had changed. This was not the first personal revelation he had offered Harry. No, he had been allowing Harry to see the truth of him from the first day he apparated into Maeve’s shop. And Harry had not betrayed that trust.
“Morning, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, voice still slurred with sleep. “I see we never bothered to go to bed last night.”
That sobered Harry, and he felt the familiar rage bubbling inside him. He tried to stifle it, tried to swallow it back down, but it was too raw, too visceral to be contained.
Clutching the box of potion vials to his chest, Draco pounded on the door. When no answer came, he began to shout for the Headmistress, begging her to let them in.
Draco wondered if Potter might like to talk about it, purge some of the horror by naming it in the light of day. But Draco knew he had no right to pry, and so he settled for a safer subject.
The windows were thrown wide, admitting a breeze with the first teasing bite of autumn, the midday sun warmed his face, and a hot bath had left him languid, muscles relaxed and sweetly aching with just the right amount of post-training soreness. Nothing could be better.
“That’s a wonderful idea!” Maeve enthused. “You finish your tea and then you can go right on back. I have a strict policy about Draco’s friends. No visits without a nice cup of tea first.”
Harry breathed out a string of compliments, then spent the rest of the meal asking surprisingly detailed questions about the recipe. Draco was beginning to suspect that Harry might be an impressive cook in his own right.
He had always thought Maeve’s talents lay within her sharply discerning palette and masterful knowledge of flavor profiles. But that’s not how she did it at all. It wasn’t about which pastry went with each tea. It was about reading the person, and knowing which taste was right for them, spiriting them away with a tea and a sweet that would bolster them, chosen exactly to match this specific moment.
After one long breath of indecision, Harry gave in to the impulse he had been fighting all week and darted over to Malfoy.
“I do not change the names of my teas, Potter,” Draco huffed, but his eyes were suspiciously shiny as he wriggled out of Harry’s arms, and Harry knew that he’d said the right thing.
Draco let out a soft breath, but thankfully, he didn’t press the matter. “You haven’t asked – Hermione about the apparition yet?”
Draco startled. This kickboxing event aside, they’d never really made plans in advance before. The apparition bond pulled them together frequently enough, and when it didn’t, Harry just showed up unannounced.
Draco bent one leg, planted his foot against the mattress, and let his knee fall to the side. Staring directly into Harry’s eyes, he stroked his wet fingers down his own thigh and pressed them against his arsehole.
But Draco’s body hadn’t quite caught up with his mind. Blaise’s confession; George’s involvement; the apologies; Hermione at the shop, her intensive notes and clever deductions – step by step, they drew closer to a cure, closer to the day when nothing would bind Draco to Harry, because being together would no longer be required. Every day brought them closer to the moment when Harry could choose to leave.
Draco drummed his fingers more rapidly against Harry’s knee, frowning deeply as he worried his bottom lip with his teeth. But then his expression cleared. “Perhaps you should,” he said, arching an eyebrow at Harry.
“Mr. Potter, Headmaster Dumbledore spent six years all but training you to accept every burden upon your own shoulders –”
“But,” Hermione allowed, “if the Room had affected your life-debt, it would have either done so immediately or whenever Harry invoked the debt, not randomly and for no reason, fifteen months after the war. I honestly don’t believe it’s involved at all.”
Draco stood and threw his robe over his shoulders, before reconsidering and allowing it to drop to the floor in a final moment of pique.
Draco turned his head, hiding against his own shoulder. “Yes,” he muttered. Harry had to strain to hear. “But they had done worse before. That – that wasn’t why.”
Lightning shot through Harry’s body as Malfoy caught him, lasting one blissful second before Malfoy grinned and shoved him backward into the tree.
Most days, Draco was content with the quiet life he led. He had Maeve and tea, and a cozy sort of peace that he had never experienced at the Manor. It was enough, and likely more than he deserved. “Peace” didn’t yield much in the way of conversation though. Blaise had funny work stories and bizarre adventures to share, and Draco… well, Draco had twenty pounds of dehydrated rose petals.
Ginny seemed to be thinking something similar. The tension between them retreated, until they were left with the sparkling sands of low tide, the churning ocean waves sweeping out to sea. Scooting over, Ginny patted the space on the step beside her. Harry climbed the stairs separating them and eased himself down.
Draco flushed and looked away. Across the room, Maeve fiddled with the wireless before settling on tinkling piano music. She began to sing along to the tune, apparently making up her own words as she went along. Draco relaxed into the melody, eyes following Maeve’s hands as she began to pipe chocolate in spiraling patters onto row after row of biscuits.
Harry made a wheezing noise when Draco stopped, but then the pants came off and the shirt as well, Draco fluttering his eyelashes coyly as he unbuttoned the cuffs. He turned, baring the curve of his arse to Harry as he bent over and ran a hand through the water.
And suddenly, it was like no one else was in the room. Harry felt himself go soft around the edges, his magic spilling out and reaching for Draco’s.
Harry made a thoughtful noise, fingers skimming gently over the ink of a particularly complex page. He did not look up until Draco’s shadow fell across the table.
Hand in hand, they faced each challenge in stubborn silence – the Slytherin common room littered with objects from the Room of Hidden Things, Grimmauld place with bars on the windows and cat flaps on the doors, Fawkes in a cage in Umbridge’s office, the broken Vanishing Cabinet perched on the Astronomy tower, a Hogwarts classroom with chains and shackles strewn across the floor, the front garden of Privet Drive where Harry used to hide to listen to the news, the Manor dungeons, Borgin and Burkes, the Quidditch stands burning to the ground.
It seemed the flowers had not been guiding them at all. No, Harry and Malfoy had traced them to their source.
“Nope, promise.” He raised his hands in surrender. “Thought it would be a good distraction, is all.”
Malfoy’s fingers stuttered where they had been trailing through his pile of petals. He gripped his hands tightly together as his face paled. “Yes, trauma has a way of lingering and tightening its grip, doesn’t it?” he said carefully. “But Luna is so strong, and she worked at a magical creature reserve all summer with no trouble. Those spells are a part of who she is. They shouldn’t be failing her now.”
Harry didn’t know what to say, but he looked back at Malfoy steadily, doing everything in his power to project acceptance, and faith, and trust. He could only hope that Malfoy would see it.
Harry collapsed back against the wall and gripped the base of his cock, trying vainly to calm the heat in his blood. Still panting, he stood shakily and began to undress. Draco turned and watched him blatantly, entire body tense with desire as Harry pulled on the suit and waistcoat.
“We gave you and Harry a potion,” Blaise said. “A Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes product. It was supposed to mimic the mythical twin bond, make sure you knew when the other needed you.”
“Don’t, Blaise,” Draco snapped. “Don’t try to blame this on her. She was looking out for Harry. But you’re
“I probably should have talked to the healer more, about – about my nightmares and my childhood and stuff, but –” Harry broke off with a shrug. “Anyway, the point is, last night – well, I know what to do when I feel like that. I should have taken a few minutes to myself to calm down, and then we could have talked about it. But I let myself get out of control, and I was awful to you.”
“What?” Harry’s eyes refocused. “No, of course not. I’m sorry.” He bit his lip and shoved his hands into his pockets as he looked away.
“Save it for a rainy day, Draco,” Draco muttered in a deep voice that Harry assumed was meant to sound like Blaise. (It did not sound even a little bit like Blaise, but Harry refrained from pointing that out.)
“He helped you, when you were trapped in the Manor?” Harry asked. He looked at her tentatively, not sure if she’d want to talk about it.
