It felt like raging fire was growing on his forearm, biting his skin and letting the pain that resulted spread through him. Only then did he seem to land back into reality. Looking down at his hand to see a thin layer of red topping his fingertips, blood finding a way into his fingernails, his body started to pick up heat like an atom bomb. To add more to his terror, he lifted his gaze to meet the pair of green eyes sparkling in the dim light, equally terrified at the sight. He could open his mouth and try to explain that he was hardly aware of what he did, but he knew it wouldn't give either of them much.
"M-Malfoy, you in there?" A softened feminine voice broke through the unsettled knocks. It seemed to do well dragging him back to his head.
"You and the whole bloody school." Draco rolled his eyes, and almost as if he knew what Harry could spot within his eyes, he began to avoid any kind of contact the green eyed boy attempted to start. Despite his voice trying to mask it, Draco failed to hide the tiny crack through his voice as it flooded back to his mind, the memory of that other morning when he walked through the hallways and whispers of random strangers drifted into his ears, the way their eyes wandered around him, and then again his face tightened at the thought of how everyone knew. He couldn't tell for certain if he was enraged or merely hurt.
"First, calm down. Sit." Hermione mentioned him back to the sofa, but he didn't seem to be listening to her at all. "Second, I don't see why it's so important to you. You're meant to be happy that he's finally off your back."
Feeling the heat of panic rise within him, Harry felt like a boneless being. There was a certain kind of frailty to not knowing what to do at times, and that moment was one of those moments harry felt weakest. He knelt beside him, still lost in nonexistent options of how he could help. He came to realize as he looked deeper, there wasn't a thing for him to do, and Draco wasn't waiting for much of him anyway. In a normal case that would be relieving, to not feel like he has to do something for someone, this was different.
"He had had some issues, which led him to stupidly believing that this rebellious behavior would get him somewhere." His father proceeded once the boy was out of sight, like nothing had ever happened. His father's statement filled him with the same sensation of rage he felt in that moment when his mother walked away from him.
The two boys walked towards him, Harry's speed forcing Ron to catch up. He stood still, his body felt like a tree trunk at the sight of the two gryffindors walking up to him, Harry with a growing smile of something close to relief and behind him walked Ron with confusion eating up his face. He did have an overwhelming feeling that he should just turn back and walk away as if he didn't catch sight of them, and in that very moment he wished it was crowded. But despite that shrieking desire in him, he stood still in place, as if welcoming them, as he didn't want anything to raise a shred of suspicion in the air.
"Well in that case, five points from slytherin." She informed her class very calmly before she turned away from them, facing her desk again as a signal that her lesson will go on. It was surprising, how the class remained dead silent even when she gave them that unpleasant news.
"Harry!" Ron's voice broke through Harry's thoughts rather aggressively, causing him to fall a harsh fall back into reality, breaking the long maintained eye contact. "What are you looking at?"
He looked back up at Draco, attempting to meet his gaze, but his eyes weren't still for him to meet, yet still he could see the muted eyes showing what looked like disgruntle. He was biting on the inside of his cheek, and his breath was too hard to capture as he was so fully aware of his breathing. But regardless of all, his arm remained rest in Harry's hand, he didn't bother jerking it away or really attempting any kind of movement away from Harry, which was quite the surprise.
"I don't know. What happened?" He felt as though he hadn't said a single word for ages on end, his tongue lied heavy in his mouth, and words felt buried too deep in his brain that getting them out to be spoken felt like too much work. His muscles felt frozen, or boiled, but in any case, it took numerous whimpers of pain to get his hand up to his face in order to just rub the sleep off them.
"I don't really know what you're talking about, Harry." Her wrinkled face expression showed concern towards Harry, for she thought he was hit on the head, causing him to lose a bit of his brain. To join the conversation, Ron shook his head, showing his agreement with Hermione.
"Silence, Draco!" He said so sternly his voice actually felt like a bar of iron. His fingers clutched around the silver snake on the top of his cane as he looked him right in the eye, a sort of a threat he usually used, and it was enough to shut Draco up completely. Though he couldn't help his breaths that became heard. He felt hot like it was mid July, and he couldn't breathe, his body was enduring the pain that came with suppressed anger. He felt like collapsing.
With his silent questions left unanswered, and they slowly drowned in the heavy silence of the air, Ron plodded by Draco after giving Harry one last glance, it was almost as if he was too scared to leave his friend alone with the blond.
"Mother, what's happening?" He walked up to her in a bit of a slow pace. His mother finally turned to face him, but she didn't say a word. Looking at her, his insides were burning with the desire to cry, the desire he put so much effort into burying. He felt like exploding.
Harry twirled a little strand of Draco’s hair with his finger, and he opened his eyes. Draco’s stomach gave a jolt once his eyes met the emerald green pair, the mellow gaze in his eyes started a raging fire in Draco’s chest, a fire that only knew to grow, eating up the last bit of his resistance until he was left with nothing but the unholy thoughts of what those perfectly shaped lips could do.
He kept his eyes glued to that one piece of shattered glass on the sink, taking the shape of a triangle with the edges smoothly sharp. He could fight that urge, and if he tried hard enough he could overpower that need in him, he could push it away to the back of his mind and leave it there, but did he really want to? There wasn't much to stop him, nothing good he looked forward to keeping his head straight for, on the contrary, those constant surges of self despise and heavy internal emptiness weighed him down, turned him numb in a way that he could only feel them, and that piece was his way out, temporarily.
"No. There's nothing the two of us can talk about." He rushed to shut her out just as soon as he heard her, and it was the matter of fact he truly didn't have anything to talk about with her as he would much rather keep the memory of it out of his mind's reach. He looked away, hoping to recapture the breath he lost when she walked in, and he sighed, forcing a bit more of voice into it to aver his aggravation.
After ages of walking, he was out on the grounds. He didn't know why or how he ended up there of all places, but he just couldn't walk any further, his feet felt like melted rubber, wobbly and unable to hold him up straight for much longer. He tossed his bag under a tree a little further than everyone, and then sat down leaning against it. He hugged his knees, bringing them up to his chin which rested on them as he looked far at pretty much nothing. He did feel a desire to cry approaching, but luckily enough he was in a state of tiredness that didn't give a chance to do pretty much anything.
It was one frigid night, despite it being hardly mid September, the darkness and the frightening emptiness of the hallways seemed to lower the temperature even more, he wished he wore some more clothes. As he spread the map before him, he saw that by that moment the footsteps were pacing around the astronomy tower. He waited for a second, just in case the footsteps would walk away, but once he was certain they had settled, he knew where he was heading.
Now, he was aware of everyone circling around him, and they probably had been like that for long enough to watch it all happen, but he was too blinded by his fury to see them or hear them whispering to each other in excitement. But now that he could feel them, and he could feel their eyes wandering around him even more strangely now, looking at him as the freak of the story, he felt yet another anxiety attack come to him, with the huge desire to not be seen, which had occurred to him a bit too often throughout the past two weeks he got used to it. So he ran away as fast as his half numb legs could carry him, hoping that no one could see his almost crying face as he flashed by them without a specific destination in mind.
"I'm asking you for a single chance, after that you're free to do as you please if I play false." She did sound careful with her words, as if she was trying to surround him with comfort enough for him to trust her, she kept her voice low and staid with a softened tone, but it was all thrown to the ocean. As she carefully sat to his left in an assuring manner, it made hundreds of sirens in his head go off, he felt alarmed and suddenly his once dull body was burning to move, to pace around that tiny space of a room like a bird set free.
"Give me your arm." Harry ordered, not sounding as shaken as he looked, his voice was rather filled with a hint of anxious fury. He took Draco's arm as though he was in a rush of time. Draco couldn't afford to react, his body felt like rubber, given to Harry to move him around as he pleased.
"How dare you lie to me!" His father attempted to yell, but he couldn't, knowing that this conversation had to be quiet for the sake of its privacy. So he spoke through his teeth, not sounding any less harsh. His fingers curled around his face, constricting Draco's jaw way too hard he could feel his father's fingers cutting his skin and digging in it, it was too painful he could hardly feel it. It brought back the feeling from his dream to his head, it felt like a deja vou and he felt like crumbling. He did wish this was another dream, he did wish to wake up at the hospital wing too hot to feel his surroundings again. "What is it that you're trying to do? Why are you so determined to bury our name in the dirt?"
The door gently opened, a bit too carefully that one could hardly see it opening at all, and slowly, a dark haired girl peered through the tiny crack of the door. The sight immediately sent Draco into a state repugnance and he didn't care enough to hide it.
. I just can't help but think of what might have happened to him. And I have this feeling, that it's way beyond that, and it's only getting worse." He couldn't feel how quickly he was talking, but certainly Hermione and Ron did feel it. His words didn't get the time enough for them to sound complete.
"You don't really understand," he exhaled, his throat felt dry after all this talking, and this conversation seemed to be a dead end that he regretted starting it in the first place. "I just feel like we need to help him. I just have this feeling that he's not well, and like all of us he deserves to be help, you know what I mean?"
But before he could engrave another line, a tentative-sounding knock on the door disturbed the tranquility of the room. He recoiled, and in the fright of the moment he couldn't get his mind to function. The least of his wishes was to be caught by a
"So um, where are you meant to go?" He hurried to change the subject when silence took over, seeing as it was a chance that came in the time he needed it most.
And before he could realize it, the door being slammed shut like thunder snapped him out of his head. And his mother's figure appeared, following the slamming door by the voice of her heels clicking against the marble floor. Two clicks per second, up in his head he started counting his mother's steps, trying to figure out how many seconds it took her to reach her destination, which soon appeared to be his parents' shared bedroom, out of despair to mute his thoughts of fear and confusion.
"Oh yeah, she's real nasty now. Can't blame her though, his father is one big piece of shit." A voice, far away, shouted back, following his sentence with a loud pitched laugh that sounded obviously forced.
Harry’s pants echoed louder through the room when they parted for air, his chin resting on the top of the mess of blond hair. Draco’s lips dived down, caressing the skin of Harry’s neck with wet kisses all over. He settled on Harry’s Adam apple, taking the skin in his teeth in a gentle bite that slowly grew hungrier, leaving behind a mark of deep red, which he eyed with pride.
"Draco, what is it? What is it that has been hurting you?" Harry never meant to his voice to sound this friable, he didn't have to force the sound of concern into his voice. He knelt down in front of Draco, who for a moment seemed to be confused, and then later realized that his hand was resting in Draco's knee, which explained the looks of confusion he gave him.
"No idea, but hopefully no trouble with the ministry. We've had enough of those." Ron's words went almost unheard, as both of them were too distracted by Malfoy they forgot each other.
'. However , I highly doubt that was his leading intention, he looked strangely keen to open that letter."
“So,” he slowly ran his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip, which had grown more tender from that kiss. He slid two of his fingers into Harry’s mouth, who welcomed them in and began sucking on them, his mind drifting elsewhere. “Be a good boy and do as you’re told?” It sounded more like a command, and Harry, so heavy with desire, could only offer a nod.
And with that, Harry rushed out of the hall, being the last of the remaining gryfinndor group to do so. Draco had spare ten minutes, long ten minutes of doing absolutely nothing, which he planned to use in taking a slow, thoughtful stroll to the field.
Draco opened his eyes to a blurry vision of sunlight coming from the window he assumed was above his bed. His mind still felt too numb to process anything. He couldn't clearly see anything, every sight felt like a fading beam of light. But still he could hear a few words in different voices, sounds felt too heavy for his sleeping mind to analyze, to know who said what. He felt extremely hot, as though his body caught invisible fire, or as though he was left to boil. His back felt drenched, drowning in his own sweat rather, as did almost every other part of his body. And with that unreasonable jump in his body temperature, his head was overwhelmed with the most intense headache he had ever felt, and it was almost like he could hear an endless beep stuck in his head and piercing through his ears. He groaned, proclaiming his half conscious presence with them.
"Draco!" The piercing voice came out loud from behind him, causing him to turn back rather fast, letting go of this mother. His eyes were filled with terror as he layed them on his father, who stood tall and stiff like a column, looking at him with hell rising within his eyes.
"Oh yeah, that one. This one is in the backyard of the manor, I'd say it is the most neglected one. I like to call her Eira, which means snow - this is ridiculous, I know, but that's because she was covered in snow when I realized how much I admired her. I think it's safe to say that she's the only one who would have a judgment-free ear to listen."
Four days had passed since Draco spoke to Harry, that day at the hospital, and since then, their conversations were mere passing eye contacts, as Draco didn't try to start any sort of interaction with neither Harry nor his friends. As though it was the thing they had no choice but do, they ended up with their eyes refusing to leave each other every time the could spot each other around, for a moment, two, or perhaps ages. As much as he tried to deny it, Harry felt a strange sensation creeping up his stomach every time his eyes met the pale blue pair of Draco's, and found them looking right back at his. A sensation of a little spark jumping in his stomach, eager it felt to turn into lively flames, which he most certainly never thought he'd feel, at least not when he found Draco looking at him.
"Highly doubt that idiot part, Potter." He commented, trying to force a hint of sarcasm into his statement. It was merely an attempt that failed to slide off their heavy main topic. "And if you're so smart, why ask?"
”Fuck...” Draco barely made a sound through the rush of heavy breaths. It was as if he had fire running through his veins, strangely fueling him while every muscle in his body tensed up, becoming incredibly stiff with his stomach turning into a knot. He could feel an aggressive shake going from his feet and up that he could hardly keep his back straight, he couldn’t help his fingers clenching tighter on Harry’s hair in a way that hurt his knuckles. Without warning, Draco’s cum flooded Harry’s mouth. Trying not to cough it out, Harry swallowed, surprised with himself as he had never swallowed anyone’s cum before.
"Hey, easy there." Harry said, seeming very calm, as he saw Draco's wand in the air, pointing at him in a threatening manner. "I come in peace."
He'd never been this close to him before, Harry thought. Their bodies never touched the way they did at that moment.
"Yeah, I just slept in, you can say." He breathed out and forced it to sound like a chuckle, he cringed at himself so hard for it, and deep inside he wished he could just shut up. He lied, he couldn't see the need to tell Harry anything close to the truth really. The lie burnt through him as it brought back the fresh memory of this morning, it had to be the earliest he woke up in days. He most of all wanted to believe that lie, for it to become the truth in his mind, replacing what actually happened and wiping his mind clean of it.
"How could you do that!" He spat when it all slowly crept to his mind, when it all felt real to him. He felt loaded with himself, his lungs full of thick air that he couldn't breathe, blood running like fire within him. Somewhere in his mind, he was starting to blame himself for sleeping, a part of it was on him in a way, and that thought stuck in his mind only fueled him more.
Draco buried his head in Harry’s neck again, finishing what he’d started earlier. At first, Harry could hardly feel the cotton soft lips nibbling on the skin just underneath his ear. Draco began to rub his erection against Harry through his pants, earning himself a hushed moan from the boy beneath him. Harry threw his legs around Draco’s restless waist, his fingers fiddling with the waistband of his boxers, eager to have nothing separating the two of their bodies, yet he was reluctant, as if scared to make a move outside what Draco wanted. He could feel the blond slytherin getting harder against him, his hot and heavy moans against Harry’s neck signaled that he was feeling far too good. Harry felt trapped, this was rather a torture, Draco was very slowly, painfully slowly, driving him to his edges, he couldn’t take it, he had come to a conclusion that Draco likes it rough, but never did he imagine it would be this rough. Draco helped himself for one last suck on the spot before he looked up, admiring the two marks he left, one right in the center of Harry’s neck and one where his jaw and ear met, both filled him with the triumphant joy of thinking that the boy was all his, for now at least.
A tiny pair of footsteps appeared moving, to Harry's delight. He traced the rough material of the parchment where the footsteps stopped for a part of the second, eager to know where they would settle tonight. It felt like a reluctant stroll, the way Harry saw it, as he would stop, in various places for a few moments before he was back moving, as though he was seeking a place where it felt like shelter.
hurt though, when you first called her mudblood." Harry added with the tiniest disturbance in his voice as he watchfully wrapped the bandage around Draco's arm. After a few rolls and Draco watching very closely as if trying to learn, Harry made sure it was wrapped around the cuts firmly enough, and with a few last touches, he let go of Draco's arm after it rested in his hand for quite some time, setting it on Draco's leg, free for him to observe.
He stood up, and began restlessly pacing around the room, cracking his knuckles probably more than normal, and murmuring his thoughts under his breath. "It's just, something feels very wrong, like dangerously wrong with him. I mean, haven't you noticed?" He spoke out loud finally, as if justifying his concern to his own self.
Harry let out a moan that showed shameless despair as Draco’s kisses reached closer to his crotch area, grinding up and down in attempts to get any kind of friction, but Draco simply ignored Harry’s burning needs and passed by them like nothing, proceeding what he had in mind.
"But he didn't use magic on you!" Harry replied, equally loud. The boy's desperate need to be seen as a victim sat heavy on Harry's nerves, he never thought he'd be that annoyed by him, and what added more to his annoyance was Draco's utter silence as though he was alright being seen guilty of something he didn't do, leaving Harry to do all the talking for him. The boy only shook his head slightly in denial.
"Watch your attitude, both of you!" Dumbledore yelled and both of them fell silent, still throwing death stares at each other. Harry stood a step behind them, feeling a bit too relieved that his existence was completely ignored, he liked that feeling of invisibility. The more time he spent there, the more useless he felt, but it was still better than having a big role to play in all of this. He wondered for a second if he could just sneak his way out, but he knew he'd be found.
For way too long, their eyes refused to leave each other, hardly blinking that Harry's eyes felt dry, meanwhile Draco's ghostly pale eyes felt as though they were digging right into his soul, in somewhat of a threat. But the moment that followed, Draco's eyes finally decided to break the staring battle to look at something else. His eyes descended, traveled down to look at Harry's perfectly round and tinted lips, and his gaze softened. Draco had no idea what crossed his mind in that very second, but he knew it made him burn on the inside, and he hated how
?" in an anxious tone of voice. His eyes met the back of the raven haired boy, sitting down beside Ron. "I overslept." He sounded breathless as he filled his plate with whatever his eyes fell on. "Why didn't you wake me up?"
Harry delicately brought Draco's head to his shoulder, in endeavors to hold him closer just like before. It took him a moment of disbelief, was it really the two of them, there alone in the dark, Draco Malfoy lying like a dead leaf in his arms, without neither of them minding it? It felt like a far fantasy no one saw coming.
As sleep slowly vanished from his mind, Draco began to wonder if it was all a dream. He was almost too sure that he fell asleep by accident when he was trying to gather up the will and energy to go to the room of requirement to finish his painting, and as it was his last thought before sleep took him, it came into his dream. It was lovely, comforting to have someone to talk to, but it didn't surprise him to wake up from it, nor did it upset him. And it was terrifying, quite frankly, if Harry actually knew what he knew in the dream. But apart from all, it felt pathetic in a way to Draco as he gave it a thought, of all people, it was none other than Potter in his dream.
"Look, I just think we should reach out and do something, to help you know." He wiped a few drops of sweat off his forehead, he wished to get a glass of water. It felt to him as though a subconscious part of him was talking, for he just didn't seem to realize the words he was saying.
"You should head back." Breaking the silence, Draco's voice was heavy, yet steady. It felt as though he was finally getting himself back in little pieces, regaining his sense of the world. His voice didn't have that hint of grunge he used to have whenever he talked to Harry, but if anything, Harry assumed it was only because of his exhaustion.
The words, finely written, burnt through his eyes, effortlessly occupying a spot where every letter sat heavy in his mind as he read that letter again, foolish enough to have the hope of a child that he might have missed something, that it was only the fear of the letter arriving that tricked his eyes into seeing the words as the words he feared, and that in actuality some sweetness hid between those few words. There was no ground to build his hopes on, the written words lingered just like how they used to be when his eyes felt on them for the first time, the melancholy dark ink stained the yellow paper just as bitterly.
"Because you need help, Draco! And if you won't let me in, get someone else to help!" He almost yelled, throwing it right to his face. He was starting to regret his worry, regret his eagerness to help and wishing that he walked away when he had the chance.
"No, enough of that." Harry's stern and serious sounding voice did the job of bringing Draco's full attention to him. "Whoever you were, or were trying to be isn't you now. You have changed, to the better, the fact that you're acknowledging how awful you had been proves it. Perhaps I was the first notice the utter change in you, if it weren't for your familiar outside looks, I wouldn't have recognized you."
"Alright, just the bandaging now." Harry piled the blood stained tissues by the kit box, and after some light searching in the kit, he pulled out a roll of yellowish cloth.
"Thank you. But for now, we should really be in bed." It was strange, he didn't have a fitting reply, as he had never been told such thing. He chose to cling to the moments of this night when he felt happiest, when everything was shut away in the back of his head and there was nothing to conjure it back, hoping that the thought of the good things will invade the place where the bad took over, and so he could feel that lightness in his system all over again just by thinking of those good moments he collected. Harry's toothless smile at the end gave everything a desired turn.
The room reeked of fresh paint, a strong chemical odor overwhelmed him, tickling his nose just about as soon as he walked in. His nose wrinkled and he gently waved his hand before his face, hoping to get a bit of air that was clean enough to breathe. As his eyes wandered around the room, he found tens of canvases standing, lined over the walls and other objects. Some of them were only plain white cloth, yet to be used, while others had all sorts of drawings on them. His eyes randomly fell on a full canvas, and it didn't fail to captivate him almost at once. It was strangely pleasing to look at, regardless of the hint of sadness to it. It held the drawing of a fountain of a sort, taking the shape of an angel painted in faint gray, her wings spread a bit behind her as the bucket in her hand poured water into the base where she stood. What looked like dark vines were growing on the statue, but between those vines were tiny little pinkish flowers, adorning certain places where they grew. And behind that fountain lied a few trees and then a huge black building, he let himself assume it was the manor. He for some reason had quite the urge to run his fingers over the lines where the constrat changed, but he kept himself from it.
“Ah.” I know what he means now and, from the intensity of his reactions, hadn’t even realised I haven’t been hitting his prostate. “Yeah.”
It was all Draco could do not to dive in and suck him. He wanted Potter in his mouth, wanted to taste him.
He only lasted until the door to the interrogation room closed behind him, then turned to see Malfoy through the charmed one-way wall.
He sits down on the bench and looks at the bell. To ring or not to ring? If Draco’s going to start the day irritated, best not. But if he’s going to think Harry’s stupid for waiting, best to.
the martyr. You’d rather go to the slaughter than risk hurting someone’s feelings, but you’ve got no problem slicing someone open or watching their most intimate moments when you think you might get away with it.” He stepped into Potter’s shadow, so close he could feel the magic radiating off of him. “As long as you can say you didn’t know better. Didn’t know what the curse would do. Didn’t know what the surgery would do.”
Harry looks over to Phillips, who is staring at Draco with unmistakable awe, stopping only long enough to scribble furiously on his clipboard. He turns back, and Draco is exactly where he’d left him–standing on nothing as easily as if it were the grass beneath Harry’s feet.
He didn’t relent until he felt Draco relax, felt his shoulders fall back and his hips push forward. Until Draco’s nipples were hard between his fingertips and Draco was breathing raggedly into his mouth. “Of course I do, you fucking arsehole.” He pulled away, looking Draco in the eye. “Fuck me, would you?”
“Nor I. I don’t believe that’s a reasonable goal of medical treatment, or in your best interest. In which case we need to focus on control, which will come more easily with emotions you’re not in the habit of using as frequently.”
“Nothing,” Pansy agreed. “We live here by your good graces, as, respectively, frivolous and stupid as ever, watching the grass grow and the roses bloom.”
Potter tilted his hips again, arching his back. Draco felt almost lightheaded, his cock swelling when he turned his attention to his hand, fucking Potter’s arse as Potter began to tremble before him.
them without responding—and feels even worse. And really, that’s another reason it won’t work. He’s not courageous like Harry. Not a Gryffindor bone in his body.
“And I did actually read it. So sorry for double-checking,” Harry scoffed. “Can’t imagine why I’d want to make sure there aren’t any extra steps in the dark ritual.”
Confusion that disappeared almost as soon as it appeared. Potter rocked back on his heels and stood, crossing his arms, his smirk replaced with stone-faced stoicism. “Are we done here?”
“Oh?” Harry looked confused, and then not a little amused. “I thought you did know how to? Wasn’t that part of the point? Learning the ropes?”
“Initially, when I woke up after the surgery, but—” he smiled at Granger, who was standing behind Draco “—the Unspeakables’ med team did a great job with pain management.”
My housemates may be less immediately amenable. They may be less amenable, full stop. But the silence isn’t too hard to withstand compared to Pansy’s bragging and posturing and screeching. And they are still Slytherins. They’ll come around to Harry Potter’s boyfriend even if they’re unhappy with me. And Pansy isn’t the only Slytherin. Blaise won’t hold it against me, and I’ve never really got to know the sixth and seventh years. Pansy can pout all she wants.
“No.” Draco looked at him steadily, though he was still unable to catch Potter’s eye directly. “It’s your choice to make. I understand that.”
His knees are liquid by the time Draco stands behind him. He feels the weight of Draco’s cock press against his arse again. He’s got no desire to move, let alone object. It’s all he can do to stay standing.
She knows – they both know – that I’ve pointedly ignored press coverage of the whole affair. It’s not as though we need the house. Even if the Ministry got the Manor and some of the vaults, we’ve the Chalet, the flats in Paris and Rome, the villa, the townhouse in Mayfair, and several holdings in Asia and the Americas. Seized or not, the Manor is one estate among many.
He cupped Potter’s jaw and pulled him in and kissed him hard. Potter opened up to him, parting his lips and returning Draco’s every volley. He let Draco pull his body closer, and his hands wandered over Draco’s back.
He resisted the urge, in no small part because he was a bit captivated by Potter’s rage. Potter was seething, clenching his jaw and seeming to will himself, just barely, not to fly across the counter.
“I wasn’t trying to break your protocols.” Draco’s jaw twitches again, like he wants to say something. Like he thinks Harry’s lying which, in fairness, he is. But he didn’t mean to break up Draco’s life, is more what he means.
His back rises and falls, deep and steady, not moving into it, but not moving away, either. The lube lets me slide against the thick walls of his rectum just enough to rotate my finger. “You’re so tight.”
“Pansy.” He sighed. “You each took significant risks on what you felt—not incorrectly—was my behalf, or on behalf of mutual friends and younger housemates. The point was to keep you safe in the aftermath where your parents couldn’t, or—” he gave her a sad, sympathetic smile “—where they wouldn’t, for trying to save their own hides. That did include avoiding hovels, filthy and otherwise, which, given the one you were living in, you were not especially averse to.”
You close your eyes. Rest your hands on the brick. It hums. You can still feel it. The beat. It’s there. You’re there.
Draco nodded. “It must be. It must be amplifying his magic. Not the way the implants do, but…somehow. There’s evidence in the work under review to suggest that the presence of an implant may have some amplifying effect on magical ability. I can only imagine, with the Elder Wand….” He trailed off, trying to wrap his head around the implications.
Potter, still holding one kitten against his chest, began to move the others out of his lap. He looked up at Draco, though he still avoided eye contact. “There are Muggle kittens too, you know.”
“Um.” Harry’s voice sounds oddly strained, and the pit of worry in Draco’s stomach starts to grow. “Some old school things. Notebooks. Old clothes.”
Harry groans, and bucks against him, and Draco finds himself suddenly, and completely, out of patience with his own hesitation.
Harry felt like he was taking in air properly for the first time since he'd got off the lift. Malfoy was on his back foot, just a little, and everything felt a bit righter with the world.  "Yes, Malfoy. The way
When Harry does, he’s ready to receive it. Parts his lips just so, presses a kiss to the tip, flicks his tongue across the slit and brings it away salty. He’s not the only one who’s been enjoying this.
Draco busied himself with a pitcher on the sideboard. “Of course. Shall I call for food? I hear you’re in search of a snack.”
He scuffed the toe of a trainer on the pavement, shrugged. “Maybe.” He looked up at me then. “What do you say?”
He didn’t manage to suppress a second moan, and couldn’t bring himself to give a bloody fuck about it. Potter’s cock was thick and hot and Draco’s mouth felt so deliciously full that all other thoughts departed immediately. It was just him and Potter, and when he brought his hands to Potter’s arse, Potter moaned and let Draco pull him forward until Draco could taste telltale saltiness at the back of his throat. When he moaned again at that, Potter shuddered above him, and Draco’s cock twitched in his pants, begging for attention that Draco couldn’t be arsed to give it. Not when he was on his knees with a mouthful of cock, and certainly not when Potter began, tentatively, to fuck into his mouth. Definitely not when Draco dug his fingers into Potter’s arse and Potter moaned and moved faster, nor when Draco leaned back against the wall and relaxed his throat and Potter started fucking into him properly, and he could look up and see the mindless bliss written across Potter’s face. There was nothing bored or distracted about it. He was present, all of him, with Draco, in Draco’s mouth, in Draco’s throat, looking like the whole world had vanished except for this, like this was the only thing in the world that could ever touch him.
The blobs thrilled him. The pictures of weeds made him rethink every mundane bit of pavement. The conceptual works gave him more to puzzle through than wizard chess had ever done. Even the Muggle portraiture outshone anything he’d seen before. It might not move, but it was still far more thought-provoking than Sir Cadogan.
Ron swallowed, stuck his chopsticks in the carton, and pushed it across the desk, away from him. Not a good sign.
Malfoy sniffs and darts out a hand, grabbing hold of the top of the stack. Harry feels Malfoy’s fingertips digging into his chest, but it’s not nearly a good enough reason to let go. “Let go of the forms.”
“If you didn’t want to apologise, I—and Mill and Blaise, certainly, and I think most anyone—would understand. Considering—what was it she said about Granger’s teeth at dinner?”
Shacklebolt cleared his throat. “I might point out that our host has arrived. Please take your seats.”
She relieved him of the latter problem. “I was beginning to wondering whether the message had been waylaid or you’d got lost. It has been—how long, is it, since you’ve been here?”
He knelt over Potter and held there, for a moment. Potter’s body emanated heat and Draco longed to press himself against it. He gave in for a moment, lowering himself to kiss Potter, to rub himself against Potter’s hips. He wasn’t expecting Potter’s hands to come up to his back and hold him there, wasn’t expecting Potter to roll his hips in encouragement, or to speed up when Draco moaned. He couldn’t help moaning; it was bliss, being pressed against Potter like this.
I obliged, sucking him down to the base as I slipped a second finger in next to the first. He gasped at that, and moaned unreservedly when I began to work them both into him at once.
He wandered towards the kitchens in something of a daze, exhausted and oversaturated, unable to completely stop running through the hundreds of tiny details that might, if he could figure out how to put them together correctly, yield an answer. He just needed the right book, or the right insight, some moment of genius.
I tuck myself away and slide a hand down his back. “I’m going to lick you again, and I’m going to add a finger this time.”
“You’ll be the head of it, and I’m sure they’ll want you back for fundraising and meetings, and you’d be on the Floo a fair bit. But do you need to be based there?”
“He certainly can’t have given away that much,” Hermione agreed, albeit with a bit more politesse, “if he’s able to buy a space like this on Diagon Alley with a storefront on Charing Cross Road.”
“Shhhhhhh!” Malfoy hissed, holding out his free hand to signal that Harry should stay where he was. “You’ll ruin it!”
“It’s not—” Draco stopped. It wasn’t worth the argument. “Look, Potter. Usually in wizarding museums and galleries, curators and gallerists rely on the paintings themselves to report back in case of theft. The artist paints a small replica or extension of the original, which remains in a locked vault until the work is purchased, in which case it goes with the new owner. If the original contains a person, the replica doesn’t need to; in case of a landscape or still life, the replica will extend the subject of the original and include some sort of portrait. If the painting is stolen, the person who’s been painted into the world of the work can travel to and from the replica to tell the owner or, in the case of a public institution, a designated steward, who has stolen the work and where it’s being kept.”
The Minister was willing to travel to Paris. Specifically to meet with him. About something so top secret it couldn’t be discussed over the Ministry’s most secure Floos.
He wondered, briefly, very briefly, what would happen if he stayed. If he put it off a few hours, or a few days. But he had his meeting with the Vice-Chancellor, and he meant to see if Mother was free for dinner, and he’d told everyone he was going, made all of his decisions based on that.
—and it had seemed so snide, so dismissive, that Harry couldn’t resist a retort, and then Malfoy couldn’t resist one back, and it had all been downhill from there. They hadn’t spoken since. Harry thought that was for the best.
“What, you came across an abandoned mansion and thought you’d get rid of the contents for a bit of fun? So powerful you accidentally Vanished half a vault? Decided to wreak bloody vengeance on evil skips across London?”
I threw on trousers and went to find Blaise who – reliably enough – was passed out under a naked body. Male. Maybe Macmillan? He’d seen Potter’s return, but had no additional information. Recommended Longbottom, who was not especially glad to see me. Longbottom said Harry’d told McGonagall he just needed a weekend away. I leaned on him a bit, but clarification was not forthcoming.
Over the next few days the promise of a new routine made it easier for Draco to abide the blocks of empty time in his mornings. Harry met with the Mind Healer he’d chosen in the mornings, and with Draco in the afternoons. They’d tried conjuring charms and simple Transfiguration, and it had been rather a pleasure to watch Harry take in the sorts of simple, beautiful spells one didn’t usually have cause for. Draco had met with the Mind Healer, too, as promised, to give an overview of the theory and hear preliminary recommendations. But even as he grew used to the daily pattern, he always found himself relieved when the time came to move to the conservatory.
Draco tried to steer the conversation elsewhere. “Potter, I really would like to discuss the meeting.”
“No, of course not,” Draco answered, smiling. Greg relaxed, the flush beginning to fade. “So what are they called?”
His robes dragged in the pile of leaves, and he didn’t hear Potter follow behind him. He put a hand to the tree trunk, then drew his wand and cast a diagnostic charm. “Not dead,” he yelled over his shoulder.
Everything Malfoy had said had to be rubbish. Didn’t it? He loved Muggle art? He wanted to help Muggles? He had been wrong about everything? He
Draco shirt is still untucked and it’s thoroughly wrinkled. He’s stepped back into his shoes and his belt is more or less buckled but his robes lay, untouched, in a pile on the floor. He shoves his hands in his pockets and catches Harry’s eye. “That desk.” He nods at the writing surface that’s got a spot of Harry’s ejaculate decorating the edge. “Is it yours?”
He slid in next to Granger, trying to focus on the present and not to let the feel of the cold wood against his back draw him into memories of the last time he’d sat in these seats. “You did it,” he whispered.
Draco held up a hand and gestured to his… well, guest would be pushing it. “Kate, you remember Mr Potter?”
Draco blinked, trying to clear his head. “Yes,” he said. “More than. Just a bit overwhelmed, actually.”
Draco crossed his arms and leaned back in his seat. The tasting menu sounded perfectly fine. More than. And he wanted to hear it. But letting Harry know that…
“That makes it worth it, right?” There’s a note in the question, like Harry is really and truly still wondering if Draco is going to say no. If he’s going to take his slicked fingers and his dripping cock and Apparate away.
But his instincts about the opening had been right. His instincts about the gallery seemed like they might be. And Potter…with Potter he’d given over to instincts he usually refused. He’d pushed and prodded and antagonised and made his case, and then he’d felt his way across Potter’s body. And in the end, Potter had believed him. If he’d understood what had had between them, Potter had trusted him, a bit.
Draco laughed. “Pot, kettle. Merlin, Potter. Listen to yourself. You’ve been taking orders so long you’ve forgotten how to do anything else.”
They fall into a surveillance pattern. Harry alternates between lazy loops of the sky and sitting on the tallest branches of the tree he’d practised in. Draco floats through the air, sometimes lying on his back, sometimes turning on his stomach, sometimes righting himself and whizzing past Harry so quickly Harry’s sure he’s seen the snitch.
“I would. And would ask Ms Bulstrode for her assistance towards those ends, if that’s any reassurance.”
It was a long moment before Malfoy pulled the paper taut and then let it fold down over itself. "Potter.”
“Did,” Harry nodded. “And then spent a miserable month in an apartment in Amsterdam, then figured I’d lost you anyway so there was no point wondering what that meant and put it out of my head for the better part of a decade. And then this bird fell out of the sky and everyone said you were the person to heal it, and there I was, and there you were.”
Malfoy leaned into one of the heavy wood doors that lined the hallway, pushing it open with his shoulder to reveal a parlor complete with overstuffed furniture, several landscapes and, Harry noticed, a full bar. Malfoy walked directly to the bar top and retrieved a tumbler full of something clear and looking, as it sloshed up the sides of the glass, slightly more viscous than water.
Potter looked down into his lap, and away from Draco. “But I wouldn’t be doing all sorts of unpredictable things. That has to be for the best.”
There’s another pause. “Alright, then. Is his identity the main obstacle to beginning a relationship?”
Sucking in a breath, Harry pulled back to study the man in front of him. Strong, narrow shoulders, and a firm chest, and collarbones that created shallow concavities that begged to be licked. And Malfoy was studying him too, eyes seeming to be trained first on the mess of his hair, then on his neck, then on his lower lip, which Harry knew had to be swollen.
His hand slipped into the cleft of my arse, and I felt him fumbling around in search of my arsehole. I spread my legs for him, feeling the heat radiating from his body, and he found it quick enough. I tightened, this time, when he found it.
Malfoy, who’s kept his footing admirably, leans in and hisses, with breath that smells like peppermint tea. “You just have to have it your way.”
Suddenly, I’m faced with his knees. He’s staring up at the ceiling, away from me, with his legs closed to hide any hint of his hole.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, relaxing his face and blinking up at Draco. “And, yeah,” he said, in reference to the sheets.
“The odds of you being ready are infinitesimal. I can’t stop you going—you’re not a prisoner here—but it would come with all of the same dangers we’ve discussed, and might set you back as well. I’d also encourage you to think about how urgent it can be if you can’t remember what it’s actually for." Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’ll leave you to your work, and I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Draco.” Millie’s voice softened. “It’s not as though Shacklebolt can give you detention. He wants to meet with you. He has good reasons. Reasons that might be of interest to you. That’s all I can say.”
Harry looked out over the water and took a long sip of his coffee. “The foundation isn’t the only thing there. You know that, right?”
It brought me here. These steps. They’re familiar, and I suspect I’m sitting in front of the old Black house, long concealed.
It was a ridiculous thought. We may share a tower, but we’ve got our own corridors, and even if neither of our houses were playing, it would’ve crossed a million invisible lines. And that would’ve been true when they were just houses, not sides of a war, not the difference between good and evil. I declined. Had to decline. He looked…not quite angry. Not angry at all. Sad? Disappointed?
Malfoy’s clinic was just as dark as everything else. Harry pulled off his cloak and cast a Lumos when he passed through the archway, and called out for Malfoy.
Besides which, Harry hadn't even remembered that requisitioning bank records through Scotland Yard was an option until he was practically in the lift on the way up to Malfoy’s office for their first meeting, and at that point who could blame him for seeing the thing through? And if other Aurors might have been less curious, or might've declined a second meeting, or might have made fewer intimate personal discoveries along the way, well, bully for them.
Harry had been watching Draco and almost clipped the doorframe as they entered the corridor that led to the conservatory, and turned to look straight in front of him. “Yeah. I see your point.”
The furrowing of his eyes was replaced by an impish gleam. Always a sign of danger where he’s concerned, and this was no exception. He retaliated viciously, drawing a heavy black line up my sleeve.
“I…” Malfoy’s face softened, and Harry felt something warm in his chest. “There’s a café down the street. On the Muggle side,” Malfoy said. “They open early.”
Eyes locked, they both let their trousers fall. Toeing off his shoes and socks, Draco steps out of them and stands there, naked save his pants, already half-hard, across from Harry.
“Thank you, Headmistress. With the five year mark approaching, we’re hoping this will be the last of it.”
Draco takes another sip and Harry thinks he sees the hint of a smile around the corners of his mouth. Still, the silence feels laden and it’s making him anxious, though he’s not quite sure what about.
“Right.” Potter swallowed. He brought both hands to the bottom of the waistcoat, skimmed over the unbuttoned bottom button, and undid the one above it, and then another. He hesitated on the last, straining with a knuckle to brush the spot where Draco’s tie was held in place by the weight of the wool and that last button. Then he opened it, his fingers rustling over the stiffly pressed fabric.
“I can’t speculate in any official capacity because yours is the only case like this, but I have wondered if the Elder Wand is partially responsible for the strengths of your destructive outbursts, especially as compared to any creative outbursts we might have missed.”
By the time the sun was getting warm, they were on to the Quai de la Tournelle. Coffee and croissants were between them on the embankment, the trees providing a measure of shade.
Draco came to kneel behind him, running a hand down his back and coming to rest at his hip. “The snake tells us the rest.”
“It’s my job, Malfoy. It’s Friday night, it’s late, I’m still on the clock, and it’s perfectly bloody reasonable to want to go home. Who wouldn’t want to do that?”
She started to shake her head, then paused. “You’ll tell me more, or have him tell me more, as soon as you can?”
Flint and a handful of others faltered halfway through their attempt at a unified voice, which came out sounding more akin to a wheeze.
Harry opens the door in Muggle denims and a jumper and his stocking feet. He stands in the doorway, blocking it, as he did last time, and scrutinises Draco.
When he did lift his head it was with clear hesitation, and the apology was out of his mouth before Draco had a chance to greet him. “I’m sorry about Parkinson. Pansy. It was rude of me.” He sighed and closed the book. “I’m happy to apologise. I should. It’s gracious of you to have me here, and I don’t mean to make your life more difficult.”
"It's Crabbe and Goyle!" Her eyes were shut tight as though she had to squeeze the words out of her as she spoke. One hand was curled into a fist beside her face, she looked like she was a breath away from exploding and she held herself together with duct tape. Her statement didn't fail to draw a puzzled look on Draco's face, but it wasn't enough to get him to grow interested in whatever she had to say. "It's Crabbe and Goyle, they did all that to you, they asked me to help and I, er, did. Ever wondered how suddenly the whole school knew everything?"
"Well, care to explain your absence for the past week?" She asked again. Harry was listening very closely to their conversation, hoping that Draco will give a fulfilling answer not only to McGonagall's question but also to his curious mind, as he was dying to know the mystery behind Draco's disappearance.
"Draco, talk to me!" He half yelled, it didn't take that much of a shout to get his voice to sound like one; the empty hallway worked just fine getting his voice to sound louder than it was.
"Draco, if you don't shut that troublesome mouth of yours, nothing will be alright." He spoke through his teeth, his voice was hardly heard for anyone other than Draco, who seemed to feel the voice right in his ear. As he was done with his sentence, he threw Draco off to the floor.
"Oh and, I would indeed appreciate it if you never tried to talk to me again, no matter how important you think it is or how I deserve to know it. I think I earned that after everything you've done." He dictated at the door frame, facing outside. And with that, he found his way out the the hallway where the air was much lighter, up in his head debating if he was fit enough to attend his next class, or if he felt like gulping a whole flask of sleeping potion and sleeping all through the day.
"Draco, we need to talk." She sounded as though she was in quite the rush. He let out the vast breath his lungs had just welcomed, and rolled his eyes, meaning for her to see his annoyance. What would go wrong if he just got up and left? "There's something absolutely important that you deserve to know, I can't keep it from you for much longer."
"I just got here." He replied without bothering to look in her direction. He was already starting to get annoyed by his presence at school, wishing he could go back to being locked alone in his room.
The sight of him was growing rather alarming to Harry as the blond was fully turned to face him. His eyes traced the bruises, spots of deep purple scattered around his abdomen, radiant against his bloodless skin, with the edges turning slightly yellow as a sign of healing. But that wasn't the worst of it, it didn't surprise him to see those marks, even though he wished to not see them. It wasn't until his eyes fell on his arm that Harry started to look entirely dreadful. He paled at the sight of lines inscribed on the inside of his forearm, messy they were and piled upon each other. His insides were continually shrinking, and he could no longer look at Draco without losing his ability to breathe. He could hear the other boy mumbling some things as a result of being startled, but he couldn't clearly make out his words.
About half an hour of him heavily eyeing the plate in front of him and aimlessly twisting the fork in his hand had passed. The only thing that caused him to lift his gaze up from his dull plate was Hermione muttering "
Draco took Harry’s stiffened tip in his mouth, sucking while his tongue fondled teasingly with the slit, cleaning the precum off the tip. Harry’s voice broke into a fragile moan, and Draco couldn’t help the smirk the drew itself on his face, relishing that heavenly sound. He ran his tongue over Harry’s length, his eyes darted towards Harry’s face to give himself the pleasure of merely watching Harry’s lips wide apart letting out wild moans, as watching him like that gave him a sense of pride he loved to feel, knowing that it all came from how good Draco was making him feel.
His chances slipped from between his fingers. The messy haired boy looked up at him, and in that very moment he looked to completely abandon that conversation of his, distracted from it as his mind traveled to Draco. And his face went bright, as though a tide of positive emotions washed over his face. He couldn't ignore the memory of the night before, the sense of hands rubbing up and down his back as a gentle gesture. It was almost as if he was scared to be given the comfort of last night again.
"Yeah well, that goes in my list of regrets." The dimness in Draco's voice wiped the smile off Harry's face entirely, leaving him with nothing but a pair of curious eyes. Draco preferred to keep his eyes glued to his hands as he restlessly kept toying with his ring. Hermione wasn't the only one he so poorly insulted, but at this moment she was what reminded him of the awful image of his father he was trying to become. It felt as if he was living the moments of when he humiliated almost everyone he passed by, and it was like he could see their inflamed gazes all over again, all at once. He wished to be freed from his body, to slowly fade into nothingness. He
He walked to a seat at the far end of the class, which left Harry wondering why he decided against sitting with his unbearable friends for the first time. Everyone seemed to watch him with dropped jaws. Some were looking at him with disapproval, some were surprised to see him, and some just wanted any sort of distraction from that seemingly forever lasting class.
Walking into Dumbledore's tiny stuffed office, and being the first to walk after the headmaster, Harry had the strongest feeling that Draco, who walked just behind him, would push him off the narrow stairs. He couldn't tell why he had that thought in his head, but he took extra care walking the few steps down, holding the railing tighter than he liked. He felt as though he was the only one scared, the only one who feared the trouble they threw themselves in, and the speech Dumbledore was about to give them. The other two boys seemed to be much more focused on their thriving hatred to each other to care about anything else.
"I've been thinking, about something. I can't really shake it off my head. It's weird." He answered, his eyes narrowed in a squint while he looked at everything but her.
- of disquiet. The boy he knocked into stood tall before him, looking firmly down at Draco's stone-hard figure. He didn't remember seeing him around before.
Harry approached him in a snail's pace, without saying a single word, which felt intentional, as though he was a little animal Harry didn't want to scare away. But despite the quietness of the encounter, Draco, out of his control, felt the need to fight, to defend himself. So with a pair of shaking hands, he tried to reach for his robe, which concealed his wand underneath, all while trying not to let his eyes slip away from Harry, for he thought that if in a moment, for any reason, he looked away, he'd find Harry with his pointed at him.
"Hey, listen, I'm sorry. But the thing is, I'm actually worried, I've seen what everything has done to you, and I want you to promise me something," Harry made sure that his steps made no heard sound as he made his way closer to Draco, even though his legs got solidified as if his bones had turned to stone. And for a moment he stopped, midway, watching as the blond let the plain white shirt hang loose on his shoulders. It still remained unbuttoned, wide open revealing his bruised front.
Draco’s body fell on the bed behind him like a lifeless corpse, with one large smile he didn’t bother hiding. He adjusted his position a little so that his head rested on Harry’s pillow, which still held the scent of his cinnamon shampoo and faintly sweat. A moment later, Harry joined him, lying with his head on Draco’s shoulder.
"Mother..." He rose from his seat slowly. His mouth felt dry, too dry to let his words out. It didn't catch his mother's attention as she kept making her way towards the front door, most likely on purpose.
He could ask himself a thousand questions, as the night was a wonder in itself, something he thought of as an impossibility, something he himself ascertained to keep impossible. But ahead of all the questions that wandered around his head was the question of why, not why did Harry choose to offer a hand of help, by that point he had come to acknowledge the fact that not everyone was as vile as he was. The question was why did he let Harry in, how was it imaginable for him to open his heart though it was but the tiniest crack, for even through that slipped a bit of what he hid, what he preferred to keep covered. He viewed that as weakness, and the thought itself, the thought of that little slot widening bit by bit until it reaches the fullest took the color from his face.
Their eyes were locked together, and it felt as though nothing in this whole wide world could possibly break that connection. Draco's eyes reminded Harry of a toddler's, twinkling with a kind of hope Harry could only describe as agonizing. Draco was torn between the two things clashing up in his head, lost in what to believe. Somewhere within the folds of his mind, he was one bit too sure Harry was only attempting to comfort him, even if that meant denying evident truth. Somewhere in his mind, he knew he can't change what he once was, people don't change that easily, it was a matter of time before he returns to hurting anyone in sight because he
"What are you doing here, Malfoy? Crying over filthy mommy?" He taunted with a growing smile as he gained a laugh from the rest of his group, including Pansy.
"She left me! Just- just walked away!" His voice was getting sharp, it felt exactly like broken glass. Harry did have the faintest glimpse of who he was talking about, yet it still felt like someone had just punched him in the stomach when he heard his words.
Harry couldn't really be happy with his reward, his mind was rather stuck to Draco and his ridiculously annoying ingratitude. He could feel the blood boiling in his veins, letting his anger wash him before Draco for it was the second time his hand of help got turned down, and he felt like the joker in the room for trying again after it didn't exactly work last time. He hated that urge he had to help Draco whenever he saw him, he couldn't stand himself for his uncontrollable sympathy towards Draco who obviously wasn't worth it. He wished to take back every single word that came out of his mouth in Draco's defense.
he meant himself, it wasn't that explicit to anyone who didn't keep a studying eye on Draco. With that thought in mind he felt himself shrink at the fact that he might had been a bit interested in a few of Draco's details, but he reasoned it was merely because they had been sworn enemies for as long as they'd known each other, and one has to keep a careful eye on their enemies.
"D-Draco." His voice crumbled out, somewhere deep within him he knew where that was going, he knew that by speaking he earned himself another insult, but it was a different situation. He
"Er, Ron, you go now, I'll be there in a few." Ron's eyes scanned Harry's face without a response, questions running in the fold of his face. Then he stared fixedly at Draco in anticipation of a cheap insult, but both of them surrounded each other with utter silence, as it was Draco who felt an insult approaching, since he excepted Weasley to already know what had happened to him just like the rest of the school.
"He took her away from me!" That very sentence drifted out of his lips many times, but every time it got lower, heavier for him to let out, and slowly it blended with the air, letting the sound of his aching cries take over once more. He was crying like a person with an open wound, as if out of physical pain, that resulted from being dry, Harry reasoned, of physical exhaustion as his lungs were drained flat, and his muscles reached a point where they felt like old rubber.
"Father, I really didn't do it, I swear! Don't you think I'm just as disgraced as you?" He tried to speak through his father's clutch, but his words could hardly be made out. "I hate it just as much as you do! I hate
"If you need to talk, or anything really, I'll always be there, you know." He set his hand down on Draco's now clothed shoulder, giving it a feeble pat, tinted with hesitation like the one gained by approaching an open wound.
"Leave!" It was a moment before his father's voice had a spike one more time, like a roar it sounded that it startled him. Then a moment after, he could hear his mother, sounding like wounded animal, but he couldn't quite figure out her words.
Pleasing it was, to walk the empty hallways after breakfast. Draco enjoyed that lightness in the air when there was hardly any voice to be heard, the air he breathed was light as it wasn't loaded with crowded words and voices in different tones, it didn't take effort to welcome every breath in. It somehow made the weather feel better, gave it quite the relaxing breeze, and the beauty of it was better left unknown. He would occasionally pass by a couple of other students, but those countable few didn't seem to care for his figure roaming around them, and for once it was beyond relieving to find others with any other form of interest than himself.
He didn't know what he envisioned to get in response, but most certainly it wasn't anything near the heartfelt chuckle that found its way out of Harry's lips when Draco's voice came to be heard. Struck by the unplanned shift in the atmosphere, Draco could only afford looking at him with his eyebrows curved so high up. As soothing and felicitous as the sight was, Draco still felt slightly uncomfortable in a certain way,
Draco captured Harry’s cheeks with a tightening clench of his fingers and pulled him up by the face, Harry’s body felt massless. His lips crashed on Harry’s again, with so much force this time that Harry was so sure his jaw would soon turn to dust under Draco’s firm grip and from the way their jaws collided. No chance was given to Harry to kiss back; he was thrown back to the bed rather harshly, lying there helplessly while Draco crawled on top of him, his hands pressed by Harry’s sides.
He pins Draco’s wrist to the wall with such force that Draco’s wand slips from his fingers. “I know what you like.” He dips his head and nips at the spot under Draco’s jawline that’s always made him shudder, that no one’s thought to touch in years. “I know what you want.”
I’ve kept something back from him, of course. The fullness is enough, something he should learn to enjoy. But there’s so much more to this. So much more I can show him. Make him feel.
When these rooms had been completed, he’d felt something like that for the first time in years. Public parks, though wonderful, weren’t the same at all, and anywhere else he went, he went as a guest; he couldn’t very well leave Damien’s dinner parties to go lie out in the garden, or tell Pansy he’d rather skip tea, thanks, he was really there for the lawns. But this was his own, once the doors were closed.
Harry seemed to ignore him. “I value your advice very much, and I’ve got used to the time we spend together. Not in—I know that can sound lazy, as though I’m just used to it, but I’ve come to enjoy it as well. You’ve never asked me to lie to you, or be this person you want me to be. It’s meant a lot to me. It means a lot to me. I suppose I’m not thrilled that you’ll be leaving. But it wasn’t any excuse to be rude, and I understand that you’ve got a life to go back to, and I respect that.”
I had assumed, at first, a simple prudishness at the root of his reluctance to take a finger or two. His Muggle upbringing, perhaps, or an adolescence subsumed by war and without the benefit of weekends in the Slytherin common room.
“Oh, no, I have the icicles cleared from my heart regularly. And no offense, Granger, but I don’t think he’s quite that invested in protecting your ego from tooth-related offense.”
“Not exactly. I’m saying that it’s acting on the drives we all employ when casting, but that, since it’s in your body rather than external to it, you aren’t able to choose when it works and when it doesn’t. You aren’t able to pick it up and put it down, as you would a wand.”
“Please Draco, please, your hand.” “Merlin, fuck, touch me, please.” “Draco, I can’t – I can’t, oh, fuck, just like that,
At last, Potter speaks. “That’s it?” He doesn’t sound angry, or even disappointed. It’s more of the same reserved blankness.
Served Harry right for indulging the conversation. Getting curious about it all. He knew what lay behind mysterious doors: Basilisks, Boggarts and, once or twice, Ron and Hermione in situations that they’d all rather not acknowledge. Some doors were best left unopened, and Harry didn’t think his life would be too diminished by ignoring the mystery of the blobs.
Draco doesn’t need the leading, not really. But he is grateful for the steadying hand all the same, as every step seems to bring another question.
He came back exhausted, collapsed into a chair, and smiled up at me, looking as pleased as he did weary.
Harry tried to meet his eye, but couldn’t seem to hold it. Not that Draco minded. Harry looked to the floor. “Yeah. But not just her.”
“Yes, well. It’s not every day the boy wonder confides his trust.” Draco rushed on when Harry smiled. “Or when I’m presented with some ridiculous Muggle – I’m assuming this is a sex toy?”
If Draco gave up sooner than he might otherwise have done, it was because he was entirely preoccupied with the question of Potter’s outburst. Come morning, he declined a breakfast tray and returned to the dining room to assess the state of things.
He decides not to think about why he’s not done it already. Except that there are perfectly reasonable reasons. It would be clumsy to release the information after the fact. It would be more transparently pointed, and while the Malfoy name is in far better standing than it was a decade ago, anything that appears to smear Potter remains inadvisable. He could frame it as a scandal though, he realises. They’d need to cook up some twaddle about photo verification processes to explain the delayed release of information, but he could do it. Some sensationalistic headline implying that Potter was a dirty Auror, or Jordan reliant on corrupt inside sources. Isn’t that the whole point of owning the press, after all?
It was enough to jar Harry into pulling up his pants and jeans, tucking himself in and zipping up quickly. He wanted to see Malfoy's face, but Malfoy seemed determined not to look at him.
I couldn’t bring myself to ask. Not in so many words. I sat across from him, leaned forward, caught his gaze, raised an eyebrow.
“Again, I appreciate your assistance, and the inconvenience you’ve gone to, which I know has been considerable.”
“I bet, at least a bit.” He kept his voice warm and even, and hoped very much that it hid his nervousness. “Might help if you close your eyes and imagine.”
“I suspect the chances of that will decrease once you start meeting with the Mind Healer. If not, I know the risks, and I’m good with a wand, if it comes to that.”
Harry did, and everyone came in for dinner, and something anxious and excited settled in his chest when he realised that they’d arranged themselves so he was sitting next to Draco. He really did have the best friends, and if they were comrades in arms, than at least Harry was certain that that was just as true of the everyday battles as the big, epic, dark-lord-defeating ones.
Draco takes the folder eagerly. Even with eight years under his belt, the whole process still rivals caffeine for a Monday morning pick-me up.
He brushed a bit of imaginary lint off his placket. “There’s a shower off the office, through a trick panel behind the desk. If you want it.”
Draco thought about offering to have something sent up again. It would keep Harry here, on his settee, in his rooms, in the firelight, making confessions. Confessions that he did not have to act on. Which might make his own withheld confessions feel that much less strange. Some part of him knew it was unwise, that this was exactly the sort of moment that led to action.
“Thank you.” Absentmindedly, Potter scooped one of the kittens into his lap. It purred and butted his wrist.
“Yes.” Potter paused just long enough and in just such a way as to make Draco feel like a Crup under inspection for signs of rabidity, and then rushed on. “We’re trying to break up a potions smuggling ring but the Goblins say they don’t have records on this one, so they’re either dealing in cash or… well, we have reason to believe they might be coming through your bank.”
“Ah.” Draco leaned further back into the sofa. “And why shouldn’t business be a bit pleasant from time to time?”
Harry could feel his blood reach a simmer, and knew full well that Malfoy could — would — get him to boiling, given the chance. He didn't know if Malfoy's goal was another go-round or an all-out fight, but he didn't intend to give him the satisfaction either way. He turned and strode to the door.
“Too dangerous,” Harry explained, running his thumb back and forth over a crevice in the stone. “Couldn’t even really go school shopping without a guard.”
Back out into the gallery, then. The blobs and the weeds still hung in the dim light. They didn’t make any more sense to him than they had earlier.
It’s just a minute before Malfoy appears. He’s as stiff and formal as before, all buttoned up and starched. It’s not like Harry’s never seen a Ministry uniform before, but none of them have ever looked quite like Malfoy’s. His buttons are polished, for goodness sake, and he must have to maintain some supernaturally correct posture to keep anything from wrinkling. Not that it’s a bad look, not that Harry even cares, it’s just noticeable on him is all.
“I understand that,” Draco said, intending something between reassurance and placation. “What I’m saying, though, is that it’s a lot to digest all at once.”
“Why’s that?” The question is directed to his clavicle, and goosebumps spring up where my breath leaves its mark.
“You won’t even say it?” Harry asked. His heart pounded. He hadn’t realised he needed to hear it. “You won’t even say that you’re innocent?”
Draco’s glad that his own moan is muffled by the seal he’s created around Potter’s tip. It’s an undignified, needy sound, not the sort he’s accustomed to making. Not the sort he’s usually inspired to make, but he’s damned if Potter’s skin doesn’t raise goosebumps on his own, if Potter’s cock isn’t a flawless fit for his tongue.
“Were there any discrepancies between those conversations? That we might not have been aware of when trading notes?”
When he was confident that Harry was okay, he pushed in as deep as he’d gone and crooked his fingers upwards, feeling for—
He’s relieved, at least, that somewhere in the superimposition of the Ministry’s drab decor over his previously sunny mood, Harry manages to make an argument to that effect—that he should be allowed to practise. That Robards picked him for a reason and he has the basic ability and it’s just a question of practise. Access. Time—time
He knew he’d never forget the first hint of Potter’s tightness. He’d made sure everything was slick enough for them both, but the power of Potter’s body was all his own. Draco tried to wait, tried to let Potter adjust, but when Potter rocked his hips Draco’s vision went white and stars danced across the reflecting pool. He had to brace himself on both arms to keep going.
Draco paused. Set both feet on the floor, though he didn't turn around. He hadn’t thought much of Harry Potter in years. It explained Granger and Shacklebolt’s intensity about the whole affair, but not why Granger thought he should care. “And?”
And now he knows that Harry’s warm and soft, and that, combined with what’s suddenly in front of him…
He’d opened the windows before they’d fallen asleep, to air out the smell of sex and cool them down, and pigeons chirruped and sparrows twittered in the courtyard below, and for once, Draco found it charming.
“Yes,” Pansy said, “but we’ve known you for aeons. You only slouch when you’ve gotten laid within, oh, 24 hours?”
“Who–?” Harry squints. It’s too dark to see much. Ghostly white skin and a shock of blond hair, but it’s the sneer that makes him certain. “Malfoy.”
His blink turns into an eye roll. He almost smiles. I withdraw my fingers in warning and the smile vanishes instantly. “Please,” he says. “Please suck me.”
The pause before he turns to go gives Harry just enough time to eke out one creaky syllable: “Stay.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, willing more earnestness into his voice than he’d usually permit, though he didn’t find it especially difficult in this instance. “If you’d like to stop, we can.”
“So they needed to find a way to keep the Wand holstered on Potter at all times, without anyone knowing about it.”
“Hermione and I wrote back and forth about it last night, with the scheduling for this, and they’ve set a time.”
Except… He thought of Malfoy as he walked. Of Malfoy, with his pink cheeks and his glazed eyes and his ‘leave it on.’ With his insistence that everything had to be a fight, with his bravado, with his Diffindo. Malfoy, with his bound hands and his breathless ‘please.’
He had expected to win, but not to be unsure of whether the kissing or the winning was better. Not to be unsure about which he’d choose, if forced.
A whole hour left. Maybe I can fit in a wank. But to go with the old familiar – Pansy on her knees? – or the new and exciting – Potter on his?
, good Merlin, how does Draco drinks this stuff? He looks up, eyes wide, at Draco’s thorough amusement, and tries to suppress the gagging. It only makes it worse, and he dissolves into a coughing fit.
"No," Harry answered, crossing his arms over his chest and watching as Malfoy's eyes tracked the leather of his jacket as it moved across his chest. "I've seen the way you look at me."
When he looked up, Harry was staring at him, horror written across his face. Mouth open, he shook his head wordlessly and took a step back.
He said someone had told him what “we” were up to, “your group of Slytherins.” That we were trying to charm our way back into wizarding society. That he’d heard I was almost certainly a heartbreaker, that he should be careful around me.
Tawny owls are England’s most common. They are, therefore, a popular choice among those who lack imagination, those who have every desire to blend in among the masses, and those who send communiqués to wizards living in the Muggle world with any regularity. Potter fits into all three categories, but tawnies are so damn common nowadays that Draco doesn’t think anything of the bird perched on the ledge of his office. Just opens the window to shoo it towards the mail room.
“Why does it matter? Draco–” he looks at Draco, shakes his head, mumbles something to himself. “Did you hear anything I said to you the other night?”
Rather than answering, Draco took Harry’s arm and held it, stopping at the Western corner of the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue Soufflot.
With an exaggerated sigh, Harry grabbed Draco’s robes and yanked him inside, leaning back against the stone wall and pulling him into a kiss.
When it comes, the knock is distinctively timid. He sips and stares at the door until it comes again, louder.
At his invitation, steaming bowls of soup appeared on their plates. Draco pulled in his chair and gestured for his guests to do the same.
Potter’s hands were as curious as his mouth. His rough callouses were a thrill as they glanced over the curve of Draco’s back and around to his chest. Draco was almost sorry to push them aside.
Harry sighed. “I know you think a lot of the events we’ve talked about are frivolous, but this is different. It isn’t. It’s important that I go.”
“So it’s when he’s upset? That doesn’t make sense, if he got that mad at Pansy and didn’t destroy anything.”
Draco sank into the middle of the sofa across from them. “Greg.” He looked up, startled, and Draco caught his eye. “Good to see you.”
That is, until I drive back into him in one hard thrust that leaves him screaming, clenching around me with such force I see stars.
“The first Death Eater.” Malfoy leaned his head back against the wall. The light reflected off his pale throat. “Death Eater.”
Conversation stopped. He felt the pressure of their eyes, curious and, at least in Millie’s case, still hopeful.
Potter may question his trust – jokingly, Draco is surprised to realise – but he follows him regardless, to grocery and liquor.
“Yeah.” Draco looks at him, at the mess of confusion and scepticism and hope on his face, and says it again, more firmly. “Yeah. I can.”
Harry casts a shield charm at the last second, and at least has the presence of mind to look bashful when he grabs a Firebolt off the top of a massive new pile. He shrugs, holding the handle towards Draco. “Oops?”
“Kitchen.” Draco pointed behind him and kissed Harry’s jaw. “Bathroom.” He rotated his arm further back and moved to Harry’s earlobe. “Other rooms.” He waved vaguely around, then gave Harry’s shirt another tug. “Bedroom?”
Those instincts are not the sort of thing that leave you. And though it had become a joke among my friends, the fact remained: I have always known Potter.
Malfoy cleared his throat and turned towards Harry, swirling the transparent liquid in the bottom of his tumbler. “Would you? Would you like that, Potter? Want me to fuck you over the bar? Want me to fuck your arse until you’re begging for it?” ”
He sank to the ground, and when his eyes flickered back open Potter was there, his smug grin less aversive than it had ever been before. “Needed that, did you?”
“That’s too bad. I’ll have to try harder.” There it was: a plan. A hint at the future. The idea that they might not part ways outside the gallery, or after breakfast.
It’s been so long since he’s seen that look, with that intent, levelled in his direction, that Harry can’t find a response.
"Well I did say Slytherin, didn't I? It's a compliment. Clearly you think those are very effective."
“Yes, I agree. But there is a pattern. The times he’s done something—we were talking about his medical care and how no one at the Ministry told him anything the first time. The second was when we were talking about the animals on the property, and I mentioned Hippogriffs which, well. You know.”
So he did. He opened Potter’s trousers and trailed his fingers over the hint of Potter’s erection and Potter moaned, properly, loudly moaned, and let out a guttural, “Oh,
Malfoy trails a hand down his inner thigh. Harry watches. The skin looks so soft. Harry’s stomach aches with the slow-burning hunger that’s been gnawing at him for weeks and he
“And you were right.” Draco attempts a smile. In the corner of his eye, he sees Harry looking back and forth between them, shocked, but smiling.
“I saw the signal.” Draco twined their fingers together and started walking down a garden path. “How are you feeling?”
apart from the war. Trying that now… I’m not sure I can imagine what that would look like. What that life would be.”
He also knew that Potter was a wreck. And his patient. And, by all accounts except those seemingly put forth by Potter’s subconscious, straight.
“Yes,” Draco drawled, reassured by what he found to be a fairly convincing imitation of nonchalance. “Master returns.” Unease still coiled in his chest, but the appearance of ease was deeply ingrained second nature. “You may stand...” he trailed off, failing to match this elf with a particular name.
Harry closed the distance between them in a flash, coming to Malfoy's side and taking in the sharp lines of his profile. "Looked more than all right to me."
“Well, what do you need to know to decide? More about the job? More about how he feels, or what’s there between you?”
He wasn’t sure why he’d saved Ron for last, except that he wasn’t likely to find a great deal of delicacy there. But he didn’t need delicacy, he decided. He needed answers. He gave his Patronus strict instructions to go through the ceiling instead of through or past Padma’s office, and waited.
Malfoy pulled a cloth from his desk and scrubbed at his fingers while Harry yanked his jeans back up and stood, zipping his flies.
Potter did call eventually, and came back to the office, this time by appointment. Kate's efforts to make him comfortable had some effect, though they did not quite make him confident. He seemed… differently unnerved, looking over his shoulder as though expecting cameras to be revealed, watching Kate lay out tea and biscuits on a table in front of the sofa as though she might slip a bit of cyanide in if he turned away.
“Yes. I— The Wizengamot was right. When I think back on it, I didn’t entirely understand what it meant at the time, but I saw them do it before the Second Wizarding War. Setting things up, moving the pieces into place. Whether they were true believers or as greedy and power-hungry as they assumed everyone else was, they would have gladly fought a third war if it meant they got to continue on as they were.”
The snake sank its fangs into the edge of the box and it slid open to reveal a short, oblong, piece of rounded marble, maybe three inches long and two inches around.
Galder popped into view before Draco’s not-quite-date could finish the thought. The elf bowed low. “Master returns, with guest.”
Draco couldn’t tell whether he was fascinated with them, or unwilling to look up. “Put them in water? Vanish them? Give them to people? Whatever you’d like.”
He exhales for a count of ten. Steadying himself. Committing this to memory. “Good. That’s enough. Keep going.”
“Even the Galleons part? You don’t think that’s, like, letting them run me into the poorhouse or something?”
“It’s not rocket science. Arithmancy. Whatever. This is not that hard, Draco!” He’s yelling. Properly yelling, his face flushed and his eyes red.
Potter moans when his back hits a metal post. Draco pins him there with a kiss at least as searing as Potter’s had been. Potter’s gasping, uneven breath doesn’t escape his notice. He pulls back to murmur, “Scared yet?”
"Merlin," Harry whispered, running his fingers over the fine hair on Malfoy's thighs, and up, pushing the bottom of the jacket up and over Malfoy's waist and then holding the two halves of his arse apart.
Granger looked as concerned as Draco felt, but if it would buy time… “Yes. That is a possibility.” At the hint of betrayal on Granger’s face, he added, “and it will secure his continued ability to live and work in the wizarding world, as well as his personal safety.”
He’s so much more open. He winces, sore around the rim, at first, but it’s easy to slide into him now. I’m almost hypnotised for a moment, watching my fingers disappear so easily into his arse, watching his cock bob against his stomach.
With a huff, Draco bends and pulls out a flowing cloak covered in what looks like hundreds of tiny feathers. It shimmers in his hands, and Harry can’t help but stare. Even at a distance, the intricacy of this creation is apparent.
Malfoy gasped and tried to thrust into his mouth, only to have Harry pull away, swirling his tongue around Malfoy’s tip and wrapping a hand around his shaft.
He went for a run. Showered. Delivered a load of books to Pansy and tried to engage her in conversation, though she was so obviously preoccupied with writing that she refused to give him more than three words at a time. He Floo called Millie and asked if she’d like to have lunch, but she wasn’t free. Neither was Blaise. Greg was on a job. At least considering the options took up some amount of time.
“Do you also agree, at this point…” Draco wavered, searching for the right words. “After yesterday, and the other night, and the other correlations we’ve found between unrecognised emotions and magical outbursts—do you agree that that theory might hold water? And, if so, that it might provide useful guidance as to how we proceed?”
Groaning, Harry shook his eyes open and tried to focus on the snake in front of him. The snake was staring at Harry, leaning forward and flicking its tongue over its wooden fangs.
got the tell-all, of course (or, the tell-almost-all, but then, no one ever really tells all) and sales have been through the roof. Higsbee had ruined one of Draco’s favourite handkerchiefs with crying over a bit of praise and an, admittedly rather substantial, raise.
Yanking on his jeans, Harry went to stand behind Draco. “Then you might be interested in what the snake had to say.”
Draco gaped. He was certain it was an unbecoming look, but he couldn’t help it; his jaw dropped of its own accord.
“It’s your cupboard,” Draco retorts, glad Potter can’t see his face. He is, technically, fully capable of handling a boggart. Technically. But revealing one’s boggart to one’s old nemesis is hardly wise. Nevermind that it would involve seeing his boggart, which he could do without. And it’s Potter’s damn wardrobe anyway, and Potter knows full well that he’s responsible for the condition of retrieved items, boggarts and all. “You do it.”
“No,” Draco replied. “It’s standard practice. And anyway, if the charms failed and a wizard Apparated in, they’d be able to just walk out with the art.”
He wasn’t going to miss the chance. “You’re ready for another.” It wasn’t a question. But then, Potter had had no problem making his objections perfectly clear. With a twist of his wrist and a whispered incantation, Draco covered his fingers with more lube and returned to his task.
“If—when—I’m able to convince him of the theory, I will encourage him to tell you himself. Strongly encourage him. I’m not doing this to be perverse, Granger. I’ve got reasons. Just as I had reasons for asking for more time, just as I had reasons for arguing the point you’ve now come to agree with.”
My heart races. I have to work to maintain the appearance of calm control. “Good. I don’t think so either.”
He pushed back from the desk, returned two of the three pamphlets to their piles, and set off in search of Malfoy.
“Would it convince you to stop this madness?” Pansy’s voice had even more of an edge to it than Blaise’s, though she did as he’d asked, crossing her legs neatly as she sank into one of the armchairs flanking the hearth.
“You have plenty to say about doing good, but it’s just more of the same, isn’t it? Parties and influence and money and getting in with the right sort.”
“And here I’d thought it was pity. Maybe regret on a generous day. Or the promise of some future returns.”
Draco bit out a laugh, eyes flickering to the doorway. Nothing. “Did it sound faint when I was coming down your throat?”
“Yes, well,” Draco repeated, trying for testy. It was over. And he’d got what he wanted, as he always did.
He pushes back from his desk. Forces himself to inhale slowly, count down from ten, exhale slowly, repeat. Tries to slow his racing mind.
“And I, as someone who has seen the aftereffects, am telling you you’re wrong to even entertain the thought.”
“No. Or yes, but only incidentally. To have this.” He twined his fingers between Harry’s and squeezed. “To do this, together.”
“However, the politics being what they are, Millicent and Granger feel strongly that my resignation might put you in harm’s way. The question of how your care would proceed is too unpredictable for any of our liking. I hope you’ll agree that keeping the Ministry at arm’s length might be desirable?”
Harry searched Malfoy’s face. He found it strangely impassive, even more than it had been, and turned to fiddle with the buttons on his coat. “That’s not an excuse, though. I didn’t mean to sound like I was making one. The point is, I’m sorry. That’s all. I’m sorry. You don’t have to accept it, but—”
Draco grins, and Harry feels their familiar rivalry explode between them. Draco’s off in a split second, with Harry on his tail.
He wiggles, settling himself into the duvet. It’s a useful reminder, intentional or not, to get down to it.
I may’ve laughed. At least, I think I did. He smiled and it was…fairly blinding. Distracting. Engaging.
It’s when his shirt drops over the railing and lands at Harry’s feet that Harry finds himself moved to follow.
He swallows. His stomach twists. His heart pounds. He suddenly realises that he has very little idea of what to do with himself in all of this. Except, maybe, take a step forward and see. It’s the only kind of solution he’s good at anyway.
At last, Harry loosened his arms and she stepped back, smiling through tears. He reached onto the tea tray for a napkin and gave it to her to blot her eyes. She rubbed his arm and said something else, then stepped back.
It was Draco’s turn to grit his teeth. “Even wizarding abstracts have that feature, just as they would with a landscape. These, in case you’ve forgotten, are Muggle. Which makes that rather impossible.”
Besides which, it’s transparently abut Pansy’s Potter vendetta. Try to sell a man to the Dark Lord, suffer widespread suspicion after the fact, and blame the original target for your life on the social outskirts…Pansy’s not exactly seeing logic there, but it’s too important to her to trade for a fuck. She’d have to think much bigger to get me interested.
There are, Draco thinks, a number of fairly obvious conclusions to draw from the war. Dark Lords: terrible house guests, generally not to be trusted. Parents: occasionally quite useful, but disappointingly fallible. Epic battles: more terrifying, less exciting than advertised. Politicians: exceedingly stupid, unfortunately promiscuous in their receptivity to favours. No loyalty anymore, his father had proclaimed shortly before leaving the country, as though hearkening back to some probably-mythical age when Wizengamot members had been loyal flunkies.
Never mind that she tried to give Potter up, and would’ve gladly consigned us all to a Dark regime in the process.
Again, Draco kissed him, sucking the skin into his mouth for the second it took for Harry to moan and reach down to grip Draco’s shoulder.
Draco removed the stethoscope from his ears. “I’d like to take your temperature, if that’s all right.”
Potter’s photo managed to look particularly sheepish this month, as though he doesn’t want to be the adored heartthrob of every witch on the planet.
“And miss the opportunity to provoke your father’s competitive spirit? No, I think I’d best be off.”
He asked the sadistic harpy, in this low growl he’s adopted as though we don’t all remember the year his voice broke halfway through every sentence, what was in the package.
With Harry’s face still in the crook of his neck, Draco felt his nod more than he heard his mumbled agreement.
Malfoy did not turn around to see it. Didn't turn to face Harry at all. "No, I just aimed a severing charm at the fabric binding my hands." His voice took on a snide note. "Don't worry, I've had practise."
“However, the need for expedience remains. The hearing is set for the 11th, which is barely two weeks from now. Harry is committed to charity events before then on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th, and if he doesn’t appear there will be a loss of revenue, and they will undoubtedly turn to the Ministry to make up the difference. I have no interest in risking his health or long-term prospects, but Harry has always shown exceptional aptitude with a wand. Might we put off any firm decisions on timeline and reconvene in a week’s time?”
“He named them though,” Greg piped in. He shrugged at Draco. “Figured a celebratory ride wasn’t out of line.”
They sat, looking at each other. Almost simultaneously, the wind seemed to go out of their sails. They sagged back against their respective settees looking exhausted, if, Draco thought, strangely resolved. He couldn’t stop watching their mouths, turning back and forth as though watching them pass a Quaffle, waiting for one or the other to speak.
“All things considered, you’re doing remarkably well. I’d be a bit terrified to have a frank chat with Granger too.”
“Yeah.” Draco ventured another step towards him, close enough now that their arms fell between them. The warmth of Harry’s forearm against his own was a pleasant reminder of that closeness. It didn’t feel dangerous in the least. “Feeling.”
“Yes,” Draco said with a smile, and crooked a finger under Harry’s chin to pull him close again. “He’s going to stay.”
“No. The Manor hasn’t operated as a livestock farm since the 18th century. Strays, mostly. Whatever is native to the area and isn’t scared off by the magical energy.”
When he sees the owl take to the sky, parchment attached to its ankle, Draco smiles. Which makes it easier to ignore the distinct queasiness that’s made a sudden appearance.
“When I’m too hungover to move, Potter, and that’s in anticipation of the day a wayward magical teakettle bites Michael Aspel on the nose.”
“Course.” Draco leaned his head in and rested it against Harry’s, then turned just enough to press a kiss to his cheekbone.
“Ron asked, and you – oh, I guess... I guess originally Ginny did. But we all figured you’d be able to, anyway. Why does that make a difference?”
“Yeah!” Harry grinned. “One hundred, with the kittens. Well done!” He held up his hand and Greg smacked his own into it, their palms clapping together.
Draco scowls, jumps up, and lifts the window with such force that it rattles in his hands. “What the bloody hell are you doing?”
Malfoy hummed, even as his eyes turned to Harry’s waistband, even as his hand ventured lower to skim the outline of Harry’s cock through his jeans.
“No one’s skin feels like magic. No one makes me come untouched and leaves me laughing afterwards. No one has what we have,” Potter drops his hand. “And you bloody well know it. You fucking coward.”
The weight of Draco’s exhaustion had hung heavy off his shoulders. It seemed to fall away as he took a step closer. “I am.”
Draco smiled, but he could feel the sadness on his face as well as he could feel it in his chest. “Was incredible. You’re incredible.”
“Do that, then. And are you letting yourself feel the things that go with that ideal day? Happiness, relaxation—whatever else?”
“Fuck.” Draco steeled himself, hands and knees braced against the mattress. A drop of sweat dripped from his brow. “You feel,” he gasped, “so fucking good.”
I fail to suppress an eye roll. “No, I was faking it. I’ve ridden your prick as simple courtesy because I’m such a giving, generous sort of a wizard.”
She slid the book out from under his hands. “I’m going to suggest that you step away. Take a break. Come back to this with fresh eyes.”
It may have taken me a moment to recover, and mirth was written on his face. I failed to find anything useful to say – the necessary blood was elsewhere at the time – and instead growled out a simple, slow, “Fuck. Me. Now.”
“I’m not sure that’s wise,” Hermione piped up as Dean trailed off. “Or perhaps you or Dean might take him. Or me, if necessary.”
He can show Harry that he’s capable of being happy. That there are some things in his life he really quite enjoys.
“If I believed, truly, that he didn’t want to be here, didn’t want to be a part of the wizarding world any longer, I suspect I’d feel differently. I’d still support alternatives that give him the choice over those that don’t, but I’d feel differently. But I don’t.”
“Good,” Draco said, making his way down Charing Cross Road, hand in hand with Potter as they walked further into Muggle London. “Let’s do.”
Potter is standing just inside the door with a sheepish smile, hands stuffed in his pockets. He looks…well. He looks perfectly acceptable. He’s wearing jeans again, of course. But he’s put an Oxford on under his jumper and – Draco does not let the surprise show on his face – they match, a light blue collar sitting over brown wool. And he’s abandoned the motorcycle boots in favour of one of the many pairs of brogues they’d retrieved together. Brogues that match his jumper
Behind him, he heard the door creak open, and a sliver of foreign light invaded the room. He whispered “
The Weather Bureau is on strike and the few remaining “essential climate management personnel” required to stay on are showing their solidarity by making sure the enchanted windows of every office are lashed by unrelenting thunderstorms. Their magical picket line is even more dramatic, the worst Draco’s seen since the Unspeakables’ campaign for a pay rise. Localised hail surrounds the three blocks around the Ministry and spontaneous downpours in the Atrium mean the lifts are full of half-soaked employees who won’t stop grousing. Or splattering Draco’s finely pressed uniform. The carelessness of it bothers him on principle even though he, at least, had the foresight to cast an
“You made out like it was a whole… thing,” Potter spluttered. “And after Williams wouldn’t do it at all–It’s just a phone call? That’s all? You were just being… what? Difficult? Just wanted to see me–” Potter froze at a knock on the door.
“Highly irregular and besides the point. I am simply affirming that I have particular knowledge of these items and am certain that they have been correctly identified.”
“You don’t need to have an image of the flowers, only a sense for the feeling itself. When you’re ready, focus that energy on the spell.”
Under a cloudy sky, sunlight began to fill the room, emanating from the rafters. On the settee, the cat stirred opening one eye towards the ceiling. The room grew brighter, and she seemed to take it for morning. She stretched lazily and sat back to lick a paw.
He slammed his briefcase down on the desk and slid it across to land in front of Potter who, to Draco’s satisfaction, didn’t quite manage to suppress a flinch. “What are you doing here?”
“Pansy.” Blaise and Millie warned her as one. Almost, Draco thought, as though they’d heard this before. He tried not to let it rankle.
“That’s about the long and short of it.” Harry sighed. “It begins to wear. I can feel it starting to build. Even if the individual stories don’t matter, so many of them at once, and having to be the person who listens and pretends to believe and love it all… It’s a lot.”
Draco smoothed his jumper. Ran a hand through his hair. “That was…” He shook his head, hoping Harry could see what he felt. That little hint of awe. He laughed. “Fantastic, and not why I came.”
The elf popped up behind him, and he clenched his fists to avoid startling like the Bloody Baron had just come through the table.
offices. Though it doesn’t much matter; his staff are so well-versed in avoiding him at this point that there’s no one left to hide it from.
Kicking free of Draco’s legs, Harry took a soothing breath and joined Draco in kneeling on the cushion, finding himself behind the seatback as he faced Severus Snape, backed by tall grasses and a few Baobab trees.
Draco bit his tongue. He was nervous enough that any sort of innuendo about bending over and pleasing was more likely than usual to come out of his mouth, even if to disastrous effect. He nodded.
Draco considered. “Yes, actually. I’ll have Galder see to it. Based on past experience—well, you said you would be able to cast now, but you don’t think the spell would be as effective as it might be. Is that correct?”
“Well it wouldn’t be very smart to give it to you beforehand, would it? What incentive would you have to follow through?”
Draco studied his face for a hint of his intention, but Potter had completed his return to polite inscrutability. “Very well, then. Lead the way.”
He’s been trying to keep his head down and just get through, but something in Harry grates at that. They aren’t co-workers who barely know each other. They’re lovers. He’d thought maybe they were even more than that.
“Harry, what is it?” Draco thinks Harry’s nervousness is contagious, because his nausea is back, and he’s not sure whether to run or fight or pry the words from Harry’s mouth any way he can think of.
To his only slightly smug satisfaction, the first hour was, at least as far as Potter’s magic was concerned, wholly uneventful, and he resolved that it would be safe to try a sandwich for himself.
“They’re very sought after at the moment. There’s no one else who has the same fundraising ability or political influence. That was the whole problem, wasn’t it? So for him to set out on his own—everyone thinks it’s going to be a force.”
Draco smiled. As much as he prided himself on his poker face, he’d been flabbergasted his first time, too.
“Oh, for Godric’s–It’s simple, it’s easy to remember, they won’t ask questions, and they don’t understand Muggle banking well enough to need more specifics. And I wouldn’t think you’d be actively opposed to something that makes them think well of you. Okay?”
“Potter discharged my life debt before the trials, in exchange for the one he owed my mother. Life debts all around, Granger. I don’t owe him a thing.”
to suggest that they’d actually been Nundus just to ensure that everyone remained aware of his perpetual heroism. But Potter did sleep, and he slept well. Which was, Draco figured, the wages of goodness. Guiltless, guileless, peaceful sleep. The kind of sleep that meant sinking into the pillows, exhaling deeply, and ceding to rest.
Harry’s head was so full of static he wasn’t sure he’d be able to hear his own voice. If he could even make words in the first place. He settled for a nod.
“Pretty sure. Robards recognised the picture and and said it was a match to the name on the card. And we know of a few people he’s worked with before. We need their records too.”
, and really, if the weather was going to be that unpredictable, shouldn’t there be some sort of alert system?
What else? He’s got behind on this. One of the many tasks that has been interrupted by recent events. Some people can’t help but ruin everything.
After an eight count she wriggled free as quickly as she’d come in, leaving him just enough time to ruffle her hair.
“Not usually, but there’s a new litter of kittens, half-cat, half-Kneazle.” He thought he saw Potter’s brow soften, then firm up again. “I’m checking on them.”
“In case you hadn’t noticed, Potter, the people you might’ve asked before the surgery didn’t have enough information to properly answer your questions.”
Potter shook his head again slowly, opened his mouth and closed it again. Draco saw his eyes trace the line of Draco’s lapels before they met the rug again.
Draco has done his level best to avoid this question, even in his own thoughts. “You’ll have a fully, if poorly, furnished house full of efficiently retrieved things,” he tries to joke, “and can restart your original project of discarding and replacing them.”
” And so on, until Lobsey started to look a little peaked with all the walking back and forth through the void.
“As much as it rubs me the wrong way to use ‘Tales of Beedle the Bard’ as a scientific source, the Elder Wand was, to the best of our knowledge, created by Death, and as a trick. It wasn’t meant to be a productive force.” Draco sighed. “And you know. You’ve used it too. It has a… pull. An interest in some spells more than others.”
When he saw it—when he realised he’d walked to the doorway, when Susan and Ron marched Malfoy from the hallway to the Floo with Seamus behind them, when he saw that Seamus’ wand was raised and pointed at Malfoy’s spine, when Malfoy, flushed and wearing only loose pyjama bottoms and with the lines of the pillowcase still imprinted on his cheek, turned his head and caught Harry’s eye—all Harry saw was betrayal.
“I have medical training.” Croaker interrupted, straightening in his seat. “To complement Ms Granger’s expertise in wandlore. Surely you will agree that that is sufficient, Dr Malfoy.”
If he thought about it that way, it all started to make a lot more sense. Malfoy wasn’t trying to help Muggles. He was trying to restore his name and get even richer along the way. He’d said that there was 25 million pounds worth of art in the show; surely he was making more than pocket change off of that. And he was making it by throwing parties and rubbing elbows with the rich and powerful. He’d said it himself, about his mother; money and reputation were just softer forms of power. Malfoy had always wanted power.
An odd restlessness stayed with Draco all afternoon. He read, but never managed it for more than twenty minutes at a time. He reviewed his notes, but found them frustratingly sterile. He took tea and found it entirely tasteless. He sat through dinner with Pansy and Greg and had almost nothing to say, even though his mind was thoroughly agitated, searching for something he couldn’t put a finger on.
Draco thinks he may, somehow, have got Potter on the defensive, and a defensive Potter is a predictable Potter, which might make the night redeemable. Even if Potter holds on to his arm with the kind of death grip that would leave most men wincing. After living with the Dark Wanker it takes far more than a rough hand—it is, in point of fact, a near-impossible task—to disturb Draco’s façade. It’s always driven Potter spare, that.
“We think so, yes. Hexes, Blasting Curses, Entrail-Expelling Curses. Most recently, I’ve started research into the spells used to create Inferi.”
, and was tenting the thinnest, smallest, most threadbare towel I’d been able to find. Not too difficult, given the condition of supplies at this disastrous excuse for a school.
Draco slid further in, to the second knuckle, past it. Out again, and in. Harry didn’t move, either in pleasure or pain, aside from the quick rise and fall of his chest. “Still okay?”
It's the end of spring term at Hogwarts and all the usual routines are thrown into disarray. Every student with something to hide thinks they can get away with Vanishing it. In fairness to them, Draco thinks, they can. But "every student with something to hide” is almost all of them, and it's a nightmare. He'd finished clearing the dais fifteen minutes ago and there's already something new on it.
Harry isn’t satisfied by it, though. Instead, he pulls Draco closer to him, his nails digging in to Draco’s shoulder blades, his calf wrapping around Draco’s leg.
After another moment, Malfoy cleared his throat. When he spoke, his voice was throaty and low. "Didn't know you could go that long without talking."
But he made it—they made it—and Draco found himself standing at the foot of the bed, Harry’s hand in his, pulling him closer, until they were toe to toe.
“You—of course you did. Of course. Are you taking care of all the details, then? Walking him to the gallows?”
Finnigan arrived next, with Thomas in tow and, it seemed, half of Potter’s Auror class. Lovegood was late, almost fashionably so, and was so quiet in comparison to the rest of them that Draco might’ve missed her if not for the replica of the solar system rotating around her head in place of a hat.
Hermione’s lips quirked in spite of an obvious effort at staying calm. “Only over the course of years.”
“Please,” Draco said. “However’s comfortable.” He watched Harry lie back, his stomach rising and falling rapidly. He reached for the bedside drawer, returning with a bottle of lubricant.
Though he wasn’t all that cross about the invasion. At least it was a distraction from thinking about all the ways this might go wrong.
“It’s often disconcerting after a period of not having or being able to use it,” Draco offered. He immediately wondered if he shouldn’t have. These moments, when one of them referenced the past, accidentally or not, were still tense between them, and he hadn’t meant to remind Harry of yet another one.
“A very wise man once told me that it is our choices that make us who we truly are.” A witch in the third row sniffled. “That same man showed me, time and again, how much our choices matter.
“I–” Potter began again. “This isn’t– I don’t usually…” He trailed off, looking at Draco searchingly.
Potter pressed his lips together. “I’ve never liked that it’s true, Malfoy, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t.”
“Yes,” Potter said. The sunrise lit his features. “It’s easy to think that things have worked the way they’ve always been. That doesn’t mean it’s correct, or that it isn’t good for me to look again. To be willing to see how they’ve changed.”
He feels a bit exposed, even with Malfoy’s back turned, but he still hesitates before he puts on the new jumper. He weighs it, presses it to his nose. It’s thick and smells like 12 Grimmauld. That red stitching keeps staring up at him, and it’s almost certainly his dad’s. He wants to know how it got there, when it got there. He wants to know everything.
. Say what you like about me – you don’t reach this level without developing skin thicker than a Chinese Fireball’s – but don’t you dare suggest that I’ve run afoul of any sort of regulation.” His voice rose, full of all the confidence he didn’t feel. Whitley & Whiting were excellent, but perfection was damn near impossible to find and the sliver of a chance that they’d missed something, that he’d be dragged back to the wizarding world kicking and screaming – literally, if necessary – wasn’t the kind of thought he wanted to so much as entertain. “There is no conceivable way I could be in trouble with the Ministry, and I’ll thank you to keep your accusations to yourself.”
Light-headedness lingered. He felt tethered not so much to the earth as he was to Potter’s breathing and the rough fabric of his jeans.
He lifts a quill and adds Potter’s name to the event on his calendar. Best to stay organised. “Yes.”
Draco followed, pressing against him. He leaned in to whisper, “Spread your legs as far as you can.”
“Malfoy?” Harry said. He barely recognised his own voice. It was a low growl, half whisper, half demand.
He reaches up for the buttons of Draco’s robes again. Stills when hesitation crosses Draco’s face. He won’t lose Draco now, can’t stand the idea of seeing him slip behind his professional façade again.
The hand on Harry’s flank suggests that Draco is. The hum of approval confirms it. The finger that trails down his spine, lower, dipping into the crevice at the top of his arse leaves Harry without any doubt that Draco is taking in everything he can.
“Oh.” Harry’s shoulders sagged, and the rest of his body fought the urge to go with them. “Right. Did.”
I haven’t slept well since I first started sharing a home with a megalomaniac, but I startled awake particularly quickly at that and asked her to leave. She was displeased. I shudder to think about the consequences, though there are sure to be some.
He moved anyway. Found himself just as eager to make more of them as he was to hear the first few. He stepped around to meet Potter’s eye, to rake a thumbnail over his chest, over a nipple, down, down, until he tucked his thumb into Potter’s waistband. With his free hand, he tilted Potter’s chin up towards him, and leaned in to nip at Potter’s bottom lip.
She knew that I meant it with Harry. It was her opener, once she’d tucked the Hallows back into her robes. An accusation. “You think you love him, don’t you?”
There was long silence on the other end. Lee creased his brown and leaned towards his microphone, apparently ready to intervene as soon as the dead air crept past the point of entertainment.
“Which are part of a temporary disruption, and which do not interfere with your living arrangements.”
There’s a noise behind Draco. He turns around to see what it is. The few coat hangers left in the room have started rattling.
Draco thought she tilted her head to gesture towards him as she followed with something more serious, and Harry got an uneasy sort of look. The combination set Draco on edge. Harry too; Draco saw the sconces flicker and gripped his wand. Then they stopped. Harry had interrupted her, shaking his head once firmly and asking a question—Draco heard, “if there’s anything to tell, can you trust me to do it when I’m ready?”—that gave her pause.
“To extend that metaphor: over time, the musculature around the eyes weakens. The wearer becomes more dependent on them than they would’ve been previously.”
“No, no. Lucius will hardly be surprised by the general sort of activity. The choice of partner, on the other hand. Not to mention the noble intentions behind it… well, let’s hope he never finds out about that bit.”
Without looking up he chucked a pillow in her direction. He heard her catch it. “But… what? They had no idea what they were doing and blew something up?”
Draco stood in the hallway for a minute, then another. Potter opened the door looking flustered, the ends of his hair still wet. He stepped backwards at the sight of Draco, obviously surprised.
“Still stubborn. Myopic.” He began to walk, coming up behind Potter one slow step at a time. “Willing to cut off your nose to spite your face. Determined to play the martyr. Determined to
He takes the stairs slowly, half afraid of what he’ll find. Doors are being thrown open and slamming shut again, footsteps pacing across the landing.
We were back to that, again, and my temper may have got the better of me. “And what about love? What about the extended hands you’ve rejected before?”
“Yeah.” Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair. “But I don’t know how to say how it feels. It’s warm, it’s sunny, there’s a bit of a breeze. Wandless casting with the
“Yeah,” Harry said. “It was… I can’t say it was better than I thought, because I’d never been able to give it much thought, if I’m honest. But it was nice, being out like that. Just… out. Able to go wherever without looking for photographers or worrying about being mobbed. I’d do it again, if you wanted to.” He held up his coffee and gestured at the river. “I guess we are, actually.” He grinned. “Still nice.”
“Right.” Draco nodded, still struggling to pin down the uneasiness in his stomach. “Good afternoon, then.”
“Right,” Potter agreed at a whisper. He slid a finger around the button and popped it free of its hole.
He reached one arm above him, grabbing a jar and dipping his thumb below the rim, pulling out a single, dripping, dark red digit.
As they walked, the boards faded into sand, and with a jolt Harry realised that they were stepping off the boardwalk altogether. “Is this where we watch?”
He scans the room. Catches Malfoy’s eye. Catches the rustling of fabric as Malfoy, ever so slightly, parts his legs and licks his lips.
Lee had written "Madam Malkin — SPONSOR" next to "ties" in capital letters, and Draco'd been so focused on it he hadn't stopped to think.
Higsbee passes him the last folder with a promising eagerness. He may be a squeaky, fumbling sort of a man, but there are solid reasons why he’s editor, among them that he understands the advantages of leaving his editor-in-chief smiling.
Shacklebolt nodded and turned from Granger back to Draco. “Absolute discretion, Dr Malfoy. On your word?”
Draco still didn’t have an answer. He had even less of one than he’d had before. He took a bite of his soup.
A tongue lapped at his bollocks and he moaned, leaning forward, tightening his fingers in shaggy brown hair. Sydney pulled back and then sank down on him one last time, hollowed his cheeks and stroked the shaft and Draco was coming, coming down his throat and it all fell away, away, for one brilliant moment.
Aside from random observations—some of them unmissable, as when Finnigan and the Weasley twin set the edge of the marquee on fire with some sort of firework—Draco made sure to have his attention on Potter at all times.
“Or a mobile signal? Or telly?” He leaned in faux-conspiratorially, trying to match the gravity in Potter’s voice rather than dissolving into laughter. “Between you and me, I do enjoy seeing which magical bits and bobs turn up on
I’m finally up and about, and Madame Pomfrey has decided that I’m well enough to return with the rest of the Hogwarts contingent. To say the return trip is different from the journey here would be a bit of an understatement. Sharing a carriage with Harry would have been unimaginable in September, never mind a not entirely hostile visit from Granger and Weasley. Harry has been hovering relentlessly all the while – for days, really – insisting that I rest and eat well and take the last of my potions.
“Yes, fine.” The reply was rushed, but if Potter was in a state to give one, and back in the void, Draco wasn’t urgently concerned.
“I can choose, if you’d prefer. However, I know you’ve made your decision and, as you’re aware, it may become difficult for you to spend time in magical spaces afterwards. This should help, but still, if there are any particular things you’d like to see or do, I would be pleased to offer that opportunity.”
“It’s a different country,” Draco said, steering them towards the Pont d’Arcole. He stopped at the foot of the bridge. “Your hotel’s on this side,” he said. “About a mile that way.”
He shuts his office door and pulls out quill and parchment. It’s not easy to strike the right tone and it takes him several tries, but he is, after all, a Slytherin, and a Malfoy to boot.
“Perhaps.” He almost jumped when Malfoy leaned in and grasped his hand, blinking coquettishly up at him and lowering his voice to something clearly meant to resemble a sultry whisper. “But a guess is hardly an answer. Tell me
“Yeah.” Potter balanced it in the centre of his palm. “Don’t think I’ve ever had this kind of apple, either.”
He waited, feeling Malfoy's back rising and falling beneath him, feeling Malfoy's fingers scrabble at the hem of his t-shirt, pulling it taut and almost keeping him in place. He waited, watching Malfoy's flushed cheeks and his fluttering eyelashes and his plump red lips, until Malfoy nodded.
Sometimes Harry thinks that really is all they are, and the Draco he thinks he knows is a dopplegänger with a remarkably coincidental address.
“In any event,” Draco rolled his eyes and ploughed on, “we’re discussing sensitive, private information about a patient.”
But he did. Even alongside the firmest conviction in what he was trying to do, he did. He had at every turn.
Besides which, what if Draco just ignored it? Or didn’t actually remember it? Or thought it wasn’t at all endearing?
Harry moves to Draco’s shirt, the weight of Draco’s lapels brushing against his wrists as he works down the row of buttons, revealing the faintest, palest sliver of skin as he goes.
"Not on me." Harry's voice sounded different as it echoed through his ears, closer to a growl. Malfoy shivered under him.
Instead of going back to the house, he slipped around the edge of the barn. Between a Disillusionment Charm and the stall’s small windows, he was willing to take the chance.
Harry starts at the noise and gives up the pretence of looking elsewhere. He stares at Draco, shocked at the suggestion that Draco will be giving him more than is required. That Draco will be giving in.
But then, Harry wondered if he had. If in bed, if at home alone, if at private dinners, if in the throes of sex, Lucius Malfoy, with all his blood supremacy, all the pleasure he took in humiliation and viciousness, was every bit as excitable, as exciting, as his son. If Lucius, like Draco, could make people feel good. Feel lots of things.
“Jumpers are a lot less memorable than dioramas of plastic Muggle children’s dolls arrayed in scenes of torture, I assure you. Or this one needlepoint, what did it say?
The sofa had seemed comfortable enough when Harry was testing it, but lying down was another matter. It was all tufted leather and he felt like his elbows or his ears or his backside were sinking into the divots. It left him feeling a bit uneven and off-kilter.
at him for a moment, and then Harry nods, and the nod turns into a smile, and Draco smiles back, and shakes his head in disbelief, and then he slides halfway back out of Harry’s arse, and pushes forward, into Harry, twice as hard. And Harry arches and moans, low and throaty, and digs his fingernails into Draco’s shoulder blades and holds on for dear life.
His pupils are dilating, edging out his irises. His mouth has dropped open and I’m tempted, so tempted, to crawl over him, to shove my cock in it.
“In our lifetimes, we have seen witches and wizards denied their wands, expelled from their jobs and homes, and separated from their families. All of this based solely on accusations that their blood was, by some standard, insufficiently pure. These proceedings took no account of their magical ability. They were held without recourse to the Hogwarts Book of Acceptance, which has, indisputably and for centuries, recorded the names of magical people at their first sign of magic. In some cases they touched those who did have—” Harry raised his hands to draw quotes in the air “—‘pure’ blood status, but who had fallen out of political favour or who were unable to provide proof of lineage that the Muggle-born Registration Commission found sufficient.
Harry has worked around magical tools long enough to know that it’s unwise to open this sort of thing in this sort of place, but it doesn’t stop him from walking forward, lifting the whole box off the bench, weighing it in his hands. Tempted further, he picks up a smaller box and weighs that too, admiring the delicate folds of the paper, wondering what it holds.
“For Merlin’s sake.” Draco hooks his elbow around Potter’s and starts pulling him towards the Floos. “Best to end things before they get out of hand now, isn’t it?”
“Oh?” Potter laughed again, bitterness tinged with a hint madness. “Is it? Good of you to tell me who I am. So many people do, it gets a bit hard to keep track.”
“Assume, for the moment—difficult though this may be—that we’re trolls in disguise, wholly incapable of putting the pieces together. Why?”
He looked at her from the corner of his eye. He hadn’t seen her laugh since he’d been back. She wasn’t relaxed, exactly, but something between them did feel more open than it had, enough so that he thought he might ask and escape unscathed. “None of them?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry began. “I’m very sorry. I thought— When I left, you’re right that I just thought you would come, and that I didn’t ask. And when I got all the letters I sent you back, I gave up. I didn’t try. In doing that, I think I proved you right. I think I made it easy for you to believe I didn’t care.
“Ah.” Her smile faltered, though she sat up straighter and jutted her chin proudly. “Yes, well. Bit harder to resist arguments for coming out of hiding when it only involves walking downstairs. And no one’s hexed me yet.”
“Yes, well I’m afraid we’ll all have to make due with post-hoc apologies. My aim wasn’t nearly so good before the Historical Society photos hit the papers. Eating here’s become a regular exercise in target practise.”
I come to stand between his spread knees and card a hand through his hair, bringing it to rest on his shoulder. He leans in to my touch. “Take your top off and lie back.”
Draco ran a hand up Potter’s abdomen, over his stomach, up to his chest. He found a nipple and squeezed, and Potter let out the softest moan. Draco hummed approval in his ear, and there it was again. Draco bit the tender skin at the base of his neck and licked at the bite mark, and Potter tilted his head to bare the skin.
“It is?” Draco realised he was feeling as off-kilter as Potter looked. The way Potter was looking at him didn’t make sense. There was curiosity in it. Maybe sympathy, or some shared wonder. It felt like the first time Draco had walked into the finished room and felt as though the floor had fallen out from under him.
Draco turned his focus entirely to the watch. Perhaps that was it, then. Potter had remembered last night, too. He felt Potter sit up and pull his knees up in front of him. It was a double jolt: Potter concealing himself from view, and Draco’s realisation that he didn’t know Potter well enough to know whether he sat like that as a matter of habit, or whether he’d adopted the position as a matter of belated modesty.
He could barely wait until nine the next morning to talk to Potter. As always, Potter sat by the window with a book. But Draco saw him twitch as he approached, even though he didn’t look up from the text until Draco was practically looming over him.
“I should have done this a long time ago,” Harry said, when the silence got to be too much. “I’m sorry it took this, and that I—”
Malfoy was leaning against the bar, his elbow braced against the wood, his legs crossed. He was long and lean and watching Harry intently, so that the latter had to resist the urge to squirm under his gaze, staving off the intensity of his focus with a meager “You’re awfully eager.”
“No?” Draco asked, half-laughing, and took half a step forward so their hips were as close together as the rest of them. “They’re great ears.”
He had run from bullies since he could walk. He had run away from the Dursleys as soon as he could. He had run from Voldemort, until the time came to face him. He had run from criminals whose names he couldn’t remember, until he could best them. Running had always kept him safe. Running had kept him free and alive.
Harry pulls back, sits up, surprised. “You okay?” His voice, even laced with a hint of concern, is gruff and raspy.
Useful information, I figured. To know what was on the boy wonder’s mind. Perhaps there was trouble in his romantic paradise? Some exploitable weakness in goings on with his as-yet-unseen boyfriend?
“See that you do. A complete one, detailing the extent of his involvement with each. And the magical flare-up he mentioned?”
“It’s true. Mother’s trying to get husband number eleven to buy the old Selwyn estate. It’s in absolute disrepair, with nothing to show for it but a cellar full of Muggle railroad ties. This has already accomplished more than entire generations of wizarding families have done.”
And though he doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know what this is or why he’s doing it, he does know that he
It’s experimental at first. A knee between Malfoy’s two. The slow lean forward. The dropping of a hand next to Malfoy’s face.
Harry cries out and bucks his hips, and Draco’s wholly certain that if his mouth wasn’t suddenly full of cock, he’d be yelling too, at the sheer pleasure of being full of this man, of tasting him again.
He’s surprised that Draco relents, but he does. And then they’re standing chest to chest, cock to cock. He tilts his head to capture Draco’s bottom lip between his, heart surging when Draco’s hips push against his. “Please,” he murmurs again, his breath mingling with Draco’s. “Please let me make you come.”
And oh, it’s a divine sight. My pale fingers against the dark skin of his hole, the beads of sweat that have begun to gather in the small of his back, the way his rim grips onto my fingers, pulling them back, and deeper.
He thinks Draco must know this place, because he doesn’t stop for an instant. Neither does Phillips. By the time Harry’s given up on figuring out where they are, Phillips has set up an elaborate recording device, trained on the heart of the meadow. Draco’s set the boxes down side by side on the ground. He’s waiting, arms crossed and a cold smirk firmly in place, when Harry turns around.
Harry never was that for me. He was the rude boy in oversized denims, the usurper of House Cups, the Quidditch opponent, the obstacle, the witness, the enemy, the boy behind those pleading, puffy eyes in the Manor’s sitting room. The boy I’d not turned in, the man who’d not turned me in, who had joined me instead. The man who got hard from the threat of being discovered, who wrapped his hand around my cock at the end of the night.
“Mistress Pansy insists!” Prippa squeaked. “Mistress Pansy says Prippa is not to return without Master Draco, but Galder is telling Prippa to bring Master’s tray, but Mistress Pansy is saying Master Draco must come to the dining room for breakfast!” With her hands occupied, Draco could hear her stepping on her feet in punishment, the tray clattering every time.
“It’s fine. He didn’t do it and I’m pleased to see him acting on his emotions. However, it’s clear that some aspects of working with me unsettle him. If it won’t do you permanent damage, Granger, I’d wager that there’s some attraction there. Millie dissuaded me from pursuing the issue at first, but especially after this last instance, I believe my resignation may be necessary.”
“If that’s when you expect to have more news,” Shacklebolt interrupted. “Though if you find anything sooner, I would ask you to notify Ms Bulstrode so we can all stay in the loop.”
Flint shifted as though to rise, but he seemed to think better of it once he got a look at his cohort.
I shrugged him off. “It doesn’t matter if we can’t say it. They’ll start looking again if it doesn’t stop, you know they will.”
Draco didn’t object. Particularly as those coarse fingers guided his half-hard cock towards Potter’s mouth.
“Does it change—?” He spluttered. “Does it change the treatment protocol to know that you’ve gone and stuck the entire Elder Wand in Harry Potter’s thigh? This is completely uncharted territory, and you’ve gone ahead and tried to chart it with the most dangerous wand in existence. Yes, it changes my recommended treatment protocol.”
Malfoy looked at him like he was stupid, and it took real effort to unclench his fists again. “The combined value of the works on display is upwards of 25 million pounds, Potter. Most of the artists wouldn’t show their work in the first place if it wasn’t protected by a top-of-the line security system. A Muggle security system, of the sort they’d understand.”
Should do it though. She’s a beast when she’s unhappy and nothing calms her quite like a good fuck. Nor have I ever found making use of her bits too terribly onerous, even if Potter has proved to be more interesting masturbatory fodder of late. But something more interactive than my hand is appealing. Yes, I’ll go join Pansy in the shower. A few minutes distraction never hurt anyone.
Croaker relaxed, but Robards leaned forward. “Was information about Auror Potter’s schedule of upcoming events also omitted from the official dossier?”
It must’ve been visible because he dissolved into laughter. He made me promise, between his gasps, not to tell Granger. As if that was even an option.
There’s no mistaking the sudden drop of Draco’s stomach. He imagines the huge pile that got them here in the first place and wonders if Harry’s done it again and he’s looking at months spent re-sorting all those carefully returned items. Imagines even worse things. Harry’s met someone in his cooking class. Marcel, he’s probably called, and he’s fit and kind and spends his days aboveground instead of atoning for his role in a madman’s genocidal regime, and Harry is in love with him, has told him so, has told him that when he still hasn’t told Draco, not that Draco cares (it’s soon, anyway, and he’s certainly not in love, the very idea of which is patently absurd) and they, Marcel and Harry, they’ve spent the morning in the sheets Draco left warm, and Harry’s come to tell him, and—
“Very well, thank you.” Draco is not presumptuous enough to extend a hand, though he does nod cordially. “And yourself?”
“So much.” Harry draws the waistband of Draco’s trousers down a fraction and sucks on the skin just above his hipbone.
Momentary unease crosses Draco’s face. It’s quickly replaced by that same familiar, cool professionalism that’s been driving Harry round the bend for weeks now.
Given what he had, and much to his displeasure, a pattern still eluded Draco. Potter had damaged things but not people, until the Weasley matriarch had been scalded. Incidental, but damage all the same. Incidents often occured when Potter was talking to someone, but without knowing when exactly Potter had brought a localised ice storm to Pansy and Greg’s rooms, and without better records from the Unspeakables, Draco couldn’t know that it was always the case. Perhaps an issue of fatigue? But Potter had cracked a tile within ten minutes of leaving the void during their first trip outdoors. And there were still no signs of an underlying magical or physical malady.
Draco’s research agenda was wrecked by the morning’s revelations. He’d meant to look at another book on wandlore, but there wasn’t really need. Not when Harry’s implant was working, and Draco’s theory had panned out, and Harry was making rapid progress with Healer Barrett and in their afternoons together. He hadn’t had an issue in over a week, and the incident with the palm tree had been minor and easily fixed, largely by Harry himself. He was ready to start a transitional plan. Maybe past ready.
I slide two fingers into him again. There’s almost no resistance now, and he arches to meet them. He grips my shaft reflexively, and fuck, but his hand feels good.
The front of Harry’s robe is still curled into Draco’s fist. When he realises, he lets it drop. He tries for light-hearted. “So, left side for you then?”
Potter didn’t look up. He blinked slowly, closing his eyes for a moment longer than necessary, and then looked straight ahead, nodding at Draco’s flies.
Harry’s half-grateful he’s been out long enough for the sun to have started setting; he’s not sure he could manage anything much brighter. But he finds he wants to manage. Wants to remember this odd, out of place expression on Draco’s face.
“I suppose.” Pansy pursed her lips. “But promise you won’t let him walk all over you, or misinterpret? Cook things up for the Ministry?”
“And ‘How do you know? How do you know who’s the one?’” She turns to Draco, looking shocked. His stomach drops. From the look of her, Pansy’s has too. “You like him.”
Malfoy snorts. “Find that hard to believe. But then,” he reaches out to run two fingers down the outside of Harry’s arm, “who am I to argue with the Boy Who Lived?”
"Come to your flat." Harry said, that angry tremor still reverberating, now tinged with something that Draco couldn't quite place.
Harry looks down at the hand on his chest and moves it to rest over his heart. “A lot. I would’ve given a lot.”
“Hmm,” Pansy mused, taking another deep sip. “Personally, I love the bit where Antonio takes it up the arse.”
