When Draco messaged him on Tinder that he had made it back home safe, Harry’s heart pounded with excitement. He found himself looking back over Draco’s profile pictures, almost thinking that if he looked at them enough he could absorb Draco into his very being.
“Nah. I’m good. I’ll obtain all my blood consensually from now on,” Pansy grinned.
“And so you did what?”
“That’s funny. I’m Christian and I haven’t been to church in years.”
“Oh? What do you have a degree in?”
“I don’t know if I have one? I used to really love Paramore. I listen to a lot of pop and hip-hop while I’m working out or just out doing stuff. I need to dust off my old CD collection. Spotify has ruined my musical tastes.”
“Smoke some weed?” Draco says, a little too loudly.
Draco shrugs.
“Double big? I like the sound of that.”
“Yeah. You’re probably right,” Draco said, struggling to ground himself back into reality.
“Where you headed?” the man asked.
“Get on the bed and grip the poles on the headboard,” Draco says.
needed to suppress anyone who might stand against him.
Draco frowned.
Ok. I’m intrigued. No promises but I’m on board for a little experimenting. I’ll try not to jerk off even though you made me so fucking hard.
Harry sighs with exasperation and complies. The dick strikes again. He puts his phone aside and goes to bed.
Draco grabs Harry’s ass, pulling their groins together. Harry pulls back, eyes going wide as he looks down, whispering, “Jesus, Draco. Is that…? Oh my God…”
“Whatever. You don’t wanna be here when Lestrange is set loose. I guess if you do kill Potter make sure to send a text to the Master to let him know,” the woman said, the troopers walking away.
“Yeah. But I still had some lingering feelings for her. Not a lot but some. Enough. And anyway… she was doing some pretty bad things and I was afraid she was going to kill someone… Someone I really cared for. She was making promises. She said she was going to kill you. Ginny. Hermione. Ron. Neville. I wanted to believe she wasn’t serious. I wanted to believe that she just needed time to adjust to her new identity. But when
“Are you saying that you would’ve been interested?” Draco asked, fearing the answer.
“Are you afraid of me? I’m sorry. I’m kinda strange. Also, I can’t remember anything,” Pansy apologized.
“Brought who back?” Draco said.
Harry smiles.
The man laughed and said, “Money ain’t the problem with the homeless. They could work. They don’t want to.”
“There’s no reason to think Potter was here. And the supposed sighting of Malfoy was probably a false sighting. There’s no way he’d come back here. He’d have to be a fool,” the woman laughed.
Unsure what he’s trying to say, Harry just leans over to quickly kiss Draco again then gets out of the car, beyond flustered. After a shower he gets on his laptop, opening Google and searching for ‘biting’.
Harry laughs.
“Hmm… We’d have to touch each other at the same time. I’m feeling pretty satisfied for now,” Pansy said.
Harry turns around, slowly walking over to Draco naked. Draco is sitting up now and his eyes seem to have discovered Harry’s dick. He’s at least three inches shorter than Draco but pretty thick in his own right. He’s never felt insecure about his size.
“Oh. It’s not in Seattle. But it says Seattle,” Harry said.
Ron: “Never have I ever taken it in the ass.”
Harry knows he should leave but he’s definitely pitching a tent right now. He needs a second to cool off.
Harry chuckles and closes the car door.
“We’re gonna get killed,” Draco said.
“Pansy is dead, Harry! Trust me. I saw her die,” Draco said.
“I’m twenty-four. Probably not much younger than that,” Alicia said.
“If you had been there something could’ve gone wrong. And anyway you and I know both know you aren’t a killer. What I did… Maybe it was the best thing I could do but it wasn’t a good thing. I trapped Pansy in my basement with magic. The spell engulfed the room while I stood outside the threshold. The spell required blood and fire. It was the only way to break the curse,” Draco said.
“Make out? As I recall you were halfway to fucking me,” Harry says.
“Be quiet. I want to talk to my nephew,” Bellatrix said, steadily approaching Draco.
“Fuck. You scared me,” Draco scowled.
He stares at her, mouth half-open unsure what to say.
“Well. For you.”
“No. I think I can only handle one new cultural milestone per day, thank you very much,” Draco says, plopping back onto the bed.
“Come on. We’ve got a lot more to go. We’re not heading back until you can hardly bear to walk anymore.”
Come on, dude. You know that’s not what I was saying.
Draco knows exactly what the fuck his date is doing, the bastard. Harry isn’t looking at Draco and it almost pisses him off. Almost. First and foremost on Draco’s mind is exactly how Harry knows he doesn’t have a gag reflex.
“I just wanted to say… I know I give you a lot of shit. But you’re actually doing well. They know it too. But pushing each other is kind of our thing,” Alicia said, squeezing her shoulder.
“I’m joking. It’s fine. It was better when I was high.”
“I could’ve helped you. You should’ve-“
“OK. Another minute,” Harry said.
Never mind. Draco gives Harry a stunned look as he feels his body responding. It was becoming a game. Draco whispers, “Don’t you dare. Save it. For me.”
A woman came walking by on the sidewalk with her dog. Penelope Clearwater. Percy’s old girlfriend.
“Fine. Check the closet and let’s move on,” the deep voice said, then stomped down the stairs.
“I’m bi and I’m dating Draco. Does that clear it up?”
“If I did it once I can do it again,” Pansy said.
“So, when can I see you again?” Draco asks.
Harry laughs, finding it such a funny thing to say for some reason.
Draco looks taken aback.
So, I’m a moron?
“Maybe later.”
“If you could live in any other city in the world, what would it be?”
“You both need Jesus,” Ron says, shaking his head and laughing.
Draco takes it easy, sliding it up and down the shaft. His balls feel ten pounds right now, hurting so bad he could cry. It wouldn’t take a lot for Draco to send him hurtling over the edge but he’s careful. Harry is amazed at how much he’s hit the jackpot. A beautiful man with a kind heart, confidence, vulnerability, and a big dick. Harry almost feels like he’s gotten away with something.
“No. I’ve always left a tip.”
“Cedric Diggory. I had such a crush. Changed everything,” Harry said, sounding nostalgic.
“A little. Besides… I’m your maker. We shouldn’t even be doing this, probably,” Pansy frowned.
“Whose house is this?” Draco asked.
It feels like he comes forever even though his balls still hurt when he’s done. Draco pulls his mouth off, licking his lips and grinning up at Harry like the proud bastard that he is. Harry can’t bear to kneel any longer and drops down the bed, completely spent.
“Social media is where you can say something objectively stupid and horrible and have thousands of people tell you how great and smart you are anyway.”
“What about Pansy? That’s what went wrong with her, isn’t it? She wasn’t into all that stuff,” Harry says.
“I did feel I did. I still feel like I do. Everything I did was…”
At around 8:30 Draco slips back into a parking slot at Harry’s apartment. Exhaustion has set in.
“Thanks, I guess,” Draco said, then headed out back.
“No. It’s fine. I don’t mind,” Harry says and goes right back to kissing Draco.
“Bingo. There is no Remus Lupin. At least not that I’ve been able to find,” Harry said, coming around to sit down next to Draco.
“I opened my mind. Opened the door in my mind that read Men on the front of it and stepped through. I just let myself think of it. And I watched some gay porn to see if I liked that. And I did.”
“That’s too bad.”
“Come with me,” Daphne said, rolling over onto her side to face Pansy.
“Missed me?” Draco says with his best wry smile.
“I wasn’t. Oh, I’m sure you’re wondering how I know. I really get into brushing my teeth, what can I say?”
Harry leaned against the tree that stood in the Weasley family’s front yard. Sunlight illuminated his handsome form and Draco felt a swell of desire that he swallowed down.
“Yeah. Me too,” Harry said.
Everyone laughs and Harry says, “Never have I ever… tied someone up during sex.”
What about Pansy? You never said what happened with her. After she got you to come out.
“Umm… Excuse me,” Harry said to a waitress.
Pansy frowned.
“Stop trying to pull it out. Just watching you cut your hands is really freaking me out,” Pansy said, pulling the sword out, the vampire falling to the ground.
Draco headed over to the bathroom as Harry called out, “Don’t go in there!”
“I was wondering… I know this is a weird question, but do you know where this address is?” Harry asked, showing her the License.
“What can I get you?” Harry asked, flashing Draco a beautiful smile.
“I’m fine. Keep going.”
“I’m good at anything I set my mind to.”
“Mmm,” Draco says, and spins Harry around, now pushing him against the sink.
“Pansy Parkinson,” Harry said flatly, sitting on the bed.
“Blood is everything. The Dark Lord understands that. And soon all will understand. I just need your boyfriend to tell me how to get out of here,” Bellatrix said.
“Parkinson, you will serve the Death Troopers. And you will do it gratefully,” a tall, older looking man said.
“It’s written in my notes too. I can’t remember it but I know there’s a word that I think is the name of a place and whenever I look away… it’s gone. I’ve tried searching for it and there’s nothing. It doesn’t exist,” Draco said.
“I, uh, don’t think we should try anal tonight,” Draco says.
“Come sit,” Draco says, patting the spot next to him.
“No. It was fine when we were young but as we got older and hormones kicked in things got worse. She wanted to get married and have kids as soon as possible. I really didn’t want that. As I was starting to… become less of a dickhead, Pansy wasn’t changing.”
“I think Harry Potter is still here. I want to eat him. My Draco was in love with him,” Pansy said, hoping she was giving them a convincing menacing grin.
“How do we fight ghosts?” Pansy asked, furrowing her brow.
“He’s gotta be in one of these houses unless we’ve lost him,” a deep voice said.
Instead, he does the same fucking thing.
“That’s a nice dick, Harry. I’m almost jealous. Not too big. Not too small. Just the right amount of big,” Draco says, grabbing it as soon as Harry is in reach and pulling him close.
“Yes, someone did but not me because I don’t remember that,” Pansy said.
Draco thinks for a moment then says, “What’s one thing that happened to you that you’ve never told anyone?”
In the morning, there are no further messages from Draco. Nor is there anything all day. As Harry is getting ready that evening he starts to wonder if the whole thing was a joke. But Draco pulls up in his black BMW right on time at 7. He has a self-satisfied smile on his face when Harry gets in the car. Harry wonders if this car was something Draco got before the rift with his parents. He feels out of place. It’s a nicer car than Harry’s used to.
“Great,” Harry says and gives her a hug.
“The cemetery? How could she be contacting us there?” Draco asked.
Draco follows him out. Harry is smiling, his hands shoved in his pockets.
Draco didn’t reply at first. This was all so strange. What were the odds that he would bump into Harry like this? He wondered if on some level he had sensed Harry. He could sense Astoria like that too.
“That’s terrible.”
No, I deserved it. I don’t know why I thought of that now.
He didn’t have to wait long for a bus. He wondered if anyone would call him now that his phone was at least a little charged. No calls. No texts. Whoever Draco Malfoy was, no one seemed to miss him.
last thing that Draco needs is Harry understanding just how Draco really came to discover his bisexuality.
“Yeah, whatever,” Bellatrix said then flew at Draco, in a flash having a silver dagger at his throat.
“I believe her, Katie,” Angelina said to the dark-haired woman.
Harry slipped the ring into a large pocket on his backpack then said nothing more but Draco could see that his eyes were wet. Harry was quiet for a minute and Draco didn’t bother him.
“You’re thinking of Superman, not vampires,” Alicia said.
“I suppose I am. Though, I’ve never felt the same way about any other man. Just you,” Draco confessed, the last words coming out as barely more than a breath.
“That was intense.”
“How did they know?” Draco growled.
Harry whispers to himself as he stares at Tinder in the dark in the apartment he shares with his best friends, Ron and Neville. Impulsively he swipes right then immediately regrets it.
Draco closed his eyes and tried to banish old memories of blood and fire. He didn’t like to think about the dark thing that Pansy had become and how he had been forced to end her existence to put an end to a terrible curse.
“So, want to go for a drive? Not a long one. Unless you’d
“Ok. When I was eleven my parents were out of town for a weekend. And I was a pretty good kid so they had no problem with me watching myself. Ron and Hermione were busy. I don’t remember why. It’s not important. But I got into the liquor cabinet. Served myself some vodka. Of course, I thought it was disgusting but I was curious.”
No one drinks.
“This is amazing,” Harry says, tapping the filet mignon with a fork.
Draco huffs and drinks. Hermione raises her hand.
The front door had been broken into already so there was no need to break in themselves. After gathering up supplies they need a place to rest and consider what to do next. They had also found a radio that needed batteries in one of the homes they searched after getting limited supplies from Safeway. Draco supposed they could’ve broken into a car but they still would’ve needed keys to get a radio on, and neither of them knew how to hot wire.
They got dressed, got prepared then met Pansy outside.
“Really something,” Draco says.
Draco continues, “What I mean is that I haven’t had much success before you. I matched with some people but they were all boring. Everyone here is into fitness and hiking. And obviously I stay fit but it’s not a hobby. I’m not going to meet up with someone to lift weights.”
“What? You don’t want to go there, Ron,” she says.
“Had to know?”
Draco looked sadly at his wife. There was still guilt in her eyes. It wasn’t her fault that Riddle was president but she had played a small role in his resurrection years before. But only a small one. They both had. He leaned over and kissed her forehead.
“Don’t you fucking come,” Draco says, forcefully.
He wonders how long he has been ignoring this problem. He remembers noticing something a couple of weeks ago but he thought he was imagining something.
“Wow. I mean, listen, I’m no pothead but I guess I grew up around parents who were always smoking so I thought it was normal,” Harry says.
a long one,” Draco says.
Harry didn’t know how Draco’s teenage lust had grown to a greater affection and admiration. It had all been so confusing at first and when Pansy died Draco had really thought about coming to Harry and being honest. They were friends by that point, nearly good friends in fact. But Draco lost his nerve even though he knew Harry was technically single at that point, though still pining after Ginny who had disappeared.
“It is. I don’t come here so much anymore but it’s always worth it when I do. So, Harry, you never told me what your hobbies are.”
want to kill you. But I do want to drain every last drop of blood from your body. You can see my dilemma,” Pansy said, sighing with annoyance.
“That sounds fine with me,” Harry says.
“Yeah, well, this is a death trooper vest and someone wrote Pansy in it with a heart next to it,” the dark-haired lady said, glancing at the label.
“Oh, I like this,” Harry says, coming behind Draco and kissing the back of his head.
“I really need a shower,” Draco says.
“Fair enough.”
“I’m getting tired.”
His lips are soft like silk, gliding against Harry’s full lips in perfect sync. Harry’s hands somehow find Draco’s sides, pulling him closer. Harry’s body is alive and hungry, his pants suddenly feeling tight. It’s half the excitement of making out with a hot guy and half the excitement of making out with Draco Malfoy. Harry is turned on by the subversiveness of his enemy’s soft lips.
In the morning, Harry is greeted by the smell of eggs and bacon. After a visit to the bathroom, he wanders out into the rest of the apartment, finding the kitchen by scent alone, his boyfriend standing at the stove in his robe.
It’s good to unburden your conscience.
Just messing with you. So, what happened? To make you realize.
“I don’t mind mixing fantasy and reality… Daddy,” Harry says, instantly feeling embarrassed.
“Are you implying I would say something stupid and horrible?” Draco says, more amused than offended.
“Fuck, Harry. You have an amazing ass.”
“So, I guess the Dark Lord’s flunkies couldn’t release you,” Harry smiled.
“Me too.”
“Tragic.”
. Holy shit. He opens Tinder, going straight to his matches. He’s had a few before now but they never messaged him back. He clicks on Draco but hesitates. What the hell can he even say?
“Now. The night’s still young. I’ve got a long way to go get back out east. There must be a sign of my sister somewhere,” Daphne said.
Draco felt flushed and bothered, a mess of hormones and emotions.
“Guess I have a best friend or something,” Draco said and looked at his phone.
“When did you know you liked boys?”
“Yeah,” Draco says, grinning like he just won first prize.
“That sounds terrible,” Pansy said.
opposed to hiking.”
Draco didn’t think he’d be getting any rest.
“She didn’t,” Pansy said.
Alicia softly snorted and kissed Pansy on the forehead.
“You’re hurt,” Harry said, motioning to check Draco but he flinched.
Draco remembered that Harry had said the owner was dead on the front porch but perhaps the real owner had taken that other path in the shower and the person on the porch was someone else. Draco looked around for pictures but it was hard to see with no light and all the shades drawn.
Draco sits down at the table, Harry coming in next to him. Draco puts a finger beneath Harry’s chin and says, “You’re so fucking hot,” then kisses him.
“Yeah, I guess. We had a good time though, right?” Pansy said.
“I’ve gorged myself,” Draco says, head against a pillow as he lies on the bed praying for digestion.
Draco frowns a little.
“Order what you want. It’s on me,” Draco says as he opens his menu.
Harry says, “What do you want from life?”
“Aww. Thanks, babe,” Pansy said and they headed out the basement together.
Harry’s right. Within an hour Draco is feeling better. Hermione and Ginny call an Uber to take them both home. Neville goes to bed and Cho passes out on the couch. Ron quietly sits nearby playing video games.
“Help? Is there anyone there?”
Draco looks at Harry. There’s something sad in his face. Harry likes big dick Draco and he likes sensitive Draco. He likes them both a lot. He kisses him, unable to hold back any longer. It’s nice for a moment but Draco pulls back.
“Terrible. She’s going to get killed tomorrow night,” Alicia said, swinging for Pansy who dodged out of the way rather than parry.
Draco softly chuckled. It was now nine months since they met and Harry had invited him to move in. Life seemed to be moving in slow-motion. They had become best friends. Allies. The only two people in the world who seemed to know one another existed.
Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe but he quietly uttered, “Yeah.”
“It’s really sexy. If the fact that doing things with it won’t be easy isn’t a problem for you then it’s not a problem for me. I just want to please you,” Harry says, leaning over to lick the head, Draco shaking in response.
Harry slides Draco’s lower lip between his lips, letting them glide together. Then Draco does something unexpected. Harry feels his full lower lip catch between Draco’s teeth which press down, biting him just a little. Harry gasps and pulls back.
“Now we’re going to play never have I ever,” Ron says, pulling out glasses from under the coffee table and pouring some sort of alcoholic beverage into each glass.
“A year. I hadn’t even noticed. I wonder how old I am now?” Pansy said.
She groans and takes a drink.
“It is when you need it to survive.”
Five minutes later Draco replies.
A door downstairs slammed open, making Draco jump. There were muttering voices and stomping up the stairs.
“It’s a long story but something happened to Pansy. It involves the old theater. There was this old box I found. It had… certain properties and powers but that’s not important right now. The important part is that the box’s owner traveled here to reclaim it. Pansy didn’t want to return it so he killed her then brought her back as…”
Astoria was watching the news again, lying on her side to face the small bedroom TV. Draco sighed as he walked into the room.
“Maybe. We missed the best hiking part of the year.”
It couldn’t be any shorter than nine inches, maybe even a little longer. Harry can’t believe it.
Suddenly, there was a whoosh of air, followed by two more, three figures suddenly standing several yards in front of her.
“I’m pretty sure no one lives here. That For Sale sign has been up for at least a year,” Harry said.
“Never have I ever had a foot fetish,” Draco says.
The most disturbing thing about all the missing people was that no one, aside from the lucky few, seemed to remember them. It was as if they no longer existed.
“I’ll try to keep that in mind.”
Reluctantly, Draco strode over to the window, glancing out the blinds. The sky was blue and the sun was out. If you ignored all the smoke in the air and the corpses in neighboring yards you could almost mistake it for a nice day. The chaos of the night before had ended, the Death Troopers having slaughtered anyone who might be dangerous or unwelcome in
“I want you to go to him. Help him. Save him. Bring him back here. But tonight… give me tonight. You can leave in the morning,” Astoria said, her finger tracing his jawline.
“Dammit. I left the other guns at home,” Pansy said.
Harry leans into his ear and whispers, “I almost went into the bathroom to jerk off, you bastard.”
“Ow! That fucking hurts,” the vampire complained, her hands grabbing at the sword, cutting her hands as she tried to pull the blade out.
“I just want to be with you. Tonight. Tomorrow. The day after that,” Harry says, kissing him, Draco’s hand now sliding up his thigh.
“I’m out,” she says, the falls back onto the floor.
Suddenly, there were voices and the sound of someone banging at the door. Draco felt all the blood drain his face and his heart began to pound in terror.
“You lied about your dick?” Harry asks Neville.
“I hope so.”
“Draco?” Harry replied, squinting at him.
Draco’s head slowly tilts up again and Draco steps back, breathing hard. Harry seems uncertain of what to do. Draco tilts his head towards the door.
“Hey. Don’t hurt him and we’re good,” Hermione says, extending a hand to shake.
Moments later he was back downstairs, holding a piece of paper in his hands.
Draco glares at Harry in shock.
“See, this is what happens when you’re raised with hippies,” Draco says, finishing his bar and lightly shaking his head in teasing disapproval.
Draco pulls his mouth off and says, “You don’t have to hold back anymore, Harry. Give it all to me.”
Harry can perhaps see why Draco sticks with smug evasion.
“Hey,” a voice says after he’s been standing outside for a couple of minutes, looking up at the stars.
Harry gave Draco a skeptical look.
The final photo is what Harry has really been waiting for. Draco sitting on his bed pushed back against the headboard, one leg propped up, the other laying flat. Between his thighs is hanging the biggest fucking flaccid dick Harry has ever seen. He zooms in the photo, thinking it must be photoshopped.
“Even so. I used to go to school with them. I think I can smell Harry. Like if he were near or somethin’,” Pansy explained.
“Aww. That’s so cute,” Cho says.
“Stay another minute?” Draco asked.
Draco slides up next to Harry, putting his head on Harry’s heaving chest.
“All right,” Harry says and gives Draco a kiss.
In the morning he has a notification.
They don’t say much on the drive. Harry stills wonders what the hell he’s doing there. He was waiting for the part where Draco reveals it’s a joke but as they arrived at the restaurant the chances of that felt like they were fading by the moment. They got their reservations and were seated.
“Uh-huh.”
It’s long, fat, and pink, nearly as big as Harry’s dick is fully hard and he’s not small. It doesn’t look even a little hard. It looks like if Harry squeezed it there would be nothing but spongey squish.
“Stop lying,” Harry said.
“For what?” Charlie asked.
The one person in the room who hasn’t acknowledged Draco is Neville Longbottom. Draco supposes out of everyone he might’ve been the biggest shithead to Neville. But he’s also playing games so maybe he’s just distracted. Draco decides not to push it.
“That’s probably enough for today. We’ve got a job to do. Nice couple is gonna let us feed if we can scare the ghosts from their apartment,” Angelina said.
“I don’t really understand but apparently they bound her in some sort of… pocket dimension. Alone in another reality, all by herself,” Harry said as they got closer to the mausoleum.
“Do you want-“ Harry says, offering it but Neville puts his hand up and says, “Nah. Just wanted to see what was going on.”
A door opened downstairs.
Draco hasn’t even realized how drunk he was until that very moment. This is why he doesn’t drink. He follows Harry into the kitchen and gets some water. It’s really hitting him.
Harry uses two hands to hold the base, stroking while he sucks the wide head. The sounds of Draco moaning make him feel like he could come in his pants if he isn’t careful. It feels incredible in Harry’s hands and in his mouth. It’s not just that it’s big. It’s that it’s Draco’s dick. An extension of him. Of his being. Of his soul.
,” Harry said and Draco went silent.
The girl was lying in hay, looking pale and very frail. She had bite marks all over her body. Her dark eyes looked pleadingly at Pansy.
The morning was hard. Astoria tried to act calm but Draco knew she was afraid. So he was he. He was probably more afraid than her.
“It’s not bold. It’s honest. What’s the point in feigning mediocrity when you know it’s not true?” Draco says, hands folded in front of him on the table looking very self-assured.
“Oh. I mean there’s lots of ways. If you can’t drive there I’d take the bus. Take the 512 from the station. It’s not far from here. That’ll take you downtown in about an hour,” she said.
She found the inside tag of the of the vest and it had a name written on it in black ink: Pansy.
“God, Draco. If you keep doing that I’m going to…” Harry said, almost under his breath.
“Am I dick?”
The dick is consistent, Harry will give him that. Oh, but he had softened in Oregon, hadn’t he? It’s obvious now that Draco cares a lot about appearances. Harry supposes that he can reconcile both sides of Draco as a solid sign that he has layers. He prefers the sensitive, vulnerable Draco but has to admit that bantering with the dick gives him a little thrill.
Cho and Ginny both drink. Ginny tilts the glass all the way back, wipes her mouth, then slams the glass on the table.
Draco’s phone finally powered on. He was in some town north of Seattle. Everett, he thought. His information said he lived in Maryland. The other side of the country. He poured his backpack out onto the table of the cafe he was in. He’d already looked at some of it. It was mostly nonsense. Ramblings about the president, conspiracies and vampires.
Harry smiles and shakes his head.
As always doing things like commenting, bookmarking, subscribing, and leaving kudos will help let me know that people are interested in more.
“Well, I do love sports. I’m really into music. Love going to local shows to see friends play. Nothing beats live music. I love beer. I read a lot but mostly non-fiction. Science stuff. Love comic books and superheroes. I guess I do like staying fit and I’m not opposed to hiking.”
Harry can’t stop thinking about Draco. It started the night he got home from Oregon. He came into the apartment, waved at Ron and Neville, then went straight to his room to lay on his bed and daydream about a guy he sooner would’ve punched in the mouth rather than kiss just five years ago.
She continued to run. She could get to the old woods faster in her car but she wouldn’t be able to fight them off as well. And it was OK. With her power she had all the stamina she could muster. She just need to get to the old woods. Then she could use the binding magic to keep herself hidden and safe. The only thing that truly matter was that her and the others were safe. Someone had to survive to be able to fight him.
“Hey, what can I do for you?” she asked with a bright smile.
Harry wet the cotton balls then began to dab at the cuts.
“Sorry. I’m just teasing you because you’re so tall,” Ginny says.
Harry laughs as Draco strokes him with a single hand, his eyes gazing up into Harry’s.
“She’s out there somewhere. They all are. I just need to find them,” Harry said.
It’s a conundrum. His entire demeanor is off-putting but there is no denying he is physically and sexually attractive. His model good looks, vague androgyny, and over-abundance of confidence are a powerful combination. But what does Draco even want? Is he genuinely interested in Harry or does he just want a hook-up? Harry isn’t sure what he wants himself. Maybe a hook-up would be best. Get whatever this shit is out of their systems then go back to their own lives. But there’s something about Draco that Harry can’t shove aside.
“You always have underestimated me.”
“Cats or dogs? Do you like cats or dogs more? This is a million-dollar questions so you better not get it wrong.”
“Not evil? I think you’re full of it,” Pansy said, pressing the tip of her sword to her throat.
Once inside Harry moved aside an ironing board and Draco squeezed behind it with Harry pushing himself in front of Draco, putting the ironing board in front of them and sweeping clothes in front of the ironing board.
The man rambled about politics for the entire hour it took to get to Seattle. The man let Harry out at a diner he insisted was great as long as Harry could ignore all the stupid liberals. Harry was glad to be rid of the man. His stomach rumbled as he entered the diner, called Beth’s. There was artwork, appearing to have been drawn by customers on the walls inside and the most wonderful smell of breakfast.
Ginny snickers.
Daphne laughed.
Draco gets off the bed, going to his nightstand and pulling something out. Harry recognizes the buzzing sound it makes.
“What’s a safeword?”
“Yeah?” Pansy asked.
about
“Me,” Harry finished for him.
Draco makes an amused sniff and says, “As long as you like it that’s enough for me.”
“They aren’t trying to date me.”
“I have a feeling this doesn’t end well.”
“Maybe. Maybe if you go for a drive with me I’ll go for a hike with you.”
Ginny in some ways resembles her brother. Certainly in terms of her fiery red hair and an endless amount of freckles. But her energy and stature are entirely different.
Ron: “Never have I ever… fuck, I don’t know. Never have I ever had sex in a public bathroom.”
Draco is nearly laying on top of Harry, Harry’s hands feeling Draco’s back as they drift down to his ass. There’s not really room for the two of them to be maneuvering but that doesn’t stop them from trying. Harry is pressed back against the passenger door, worried he might accidentally fall out. He guides Draco back, their lips still joined. They finally part and Harry catches his breath.
Draco tries to chew, wincing as he swallows a little too much then says, “Adequate. Very adequate.”
Oh yeah. This is definitely more than a physical attraction. Shit.
“Drink up,” Pansy said, as Daphne latched on.
“Yeah. And I give some damn good cuddles,” Harry says.
Draco didn’t know what to say.
“Do you need a doctor?” she asked.
“I thought you’d say Paris.”
“This is so weird, Darlene. I feel like eating you. Isn’t that weird? Like… who the fuck wants to eat a person?” Pansy said, getting closer.
Draco’s turn again: “Never have I ever told someone I love them but didn’t mean it.”
“You have no fucking idea. Get over here,” Draco says.
Harry yawned and Draco yelped, ripped out of the silence.
The woman rolled her eyes, walked over and with a slash of a fingernail, slit the man’s throat, his blood gushing out.
“Hmm. I don’t know what went wrong with Cho. I think we just drifted apart. And she was interested in someone else. I was interested in Ginny.”
“Ask another question before you pass out,” Draco says, enjoying this.
“I know. Harry’s the only one of the old gang still there. Everyone left or has disappeared. I don’t even understand why he went back,” Draco said.
“You. Me. Neville. Hermione. Ginny. Cho.”
The third woman stepped forward, clearly holding something behind her back. A white lady with dark-hair.
Harry stepped closer to the ash. Draco wanted to pull him away and stop him from tormenting himself. Suddenly Harry knelt down to pick something up.
“Damn. You got lucky,” Alicia said, swinging down hard, knocking Pansy’s sword out of her hands again.
“What do you think?”
Draco felt petrified, not knowing how he should answer. He reminded himself that the world was falling apart and nothing mattered anymore. What was the worst that could happen? Who could fault him for having this one, small thing before he died?
Sure enough, it’s not until noon while he’s standing around bored at work when he gets a message from Draco.
Draco glanced at Harry with a frown and said, “I had a dream last night, Harry. I dream about a lot of things. I dream about the president. I dream about… other worlds. Monsters. I dream that we’re living in a dream.”
“Hey, Harry,” she said, waving up at him.
Draco steps out of his car. He’s nervous. Maybe the most nervous he’s been since he and Harry started dating. But tonight he’s going to be large and in charge. The chosen vibe for the night is hot, confident, but chill. This crowd won’t go for his usual dickish charm. He’s gotta let the walls down and make sure they know he’s not like that anymore. But at the same time, he wants everyone there to have no doubt at all that he’s a fucking catch and that Harry had definitely scored the big one.
“You could save me… if you wanted. They told me they could… they would. If I just played nice and let them keep doing whatever they wanted. They’d reward me,” she said.
“There it is,” Draco says.
“Voldemort,” Harry said in recognition.
Draco knew Harry was special just like Astoria. He supposed he had always known that even back in high school. Maybe not magically special but special nonetheless. He had hated Harry out of jealousy and buried an attraction that had only come bubbling to the surface when they were reunited as adults.
“A word that means I don’t know who I am,” Pansy said.
“Help me,” she said.
“Thought I could use a change.”
Draco laughs and says, “Really? All right. It’s a word that you say when you want to stop whatever we’re doing. A way to know that it’s not just part of the play.”
Yeah, me too. Total accident.
“No problem. I’m not offended,” Harry said, frankly wishing Draco would walk around shirtless more often.
Harry blinks but nods and they carry on. Five minutes later Draco says, “So, what about your relationships? Why didn’t they work out?”
Harry sighed.
“You’re a death trooper. Woman at that farmhouse told us you ate her husband,” the tall black woman asked.
No comment.
“That’s fair.”
“Depends. If you bury yourself you have a stronger bond. You’ll be able to read her thoughts and control her,” Angelina said.
As Draco heads out of his apartment and down to his car he wonders how he and Pansy stayed together for so long. She adored him. He liked her but in truth he never really loved her. He had liked the way she made him feel. Except when it came to the sex. The sex was terrible. They weren’t compatible, neither physically nor in terms of preferences. This is a fear with Harry too but Draco figures he’ll cross that bridge when he comes to it. He has too much anxiety about Harry to dwell on any particular thing.
“Great. Thanks. I’m a lot of fun. I think,” Pansy said, shaking her hand.
“Fuck, daddy,” Harry utters, Draco growling in response, the vibrations on Harry’s dick making him squirm.
“I don’t.”
Harry’s head bobs, speeding up, wanting Draco to either come or beg him to stop. Draco doesn’t beg. Instead, he whimpers and says, “Oh God, oh fuck, Harry. I’m going to come. I’m gonna fucking come so hard.”
“Actually… you should bring all your things with you,” Harry said.
Harry: “Never have I ever… had a gag reflex.”
“No!” Draco shouted, swatting Harry away and stepping back
After a moment Harry came back inside.
“What’s wrong with pizza? Less civilized than pancakes?” Harry says, coming to sit down next to Draco.
“If Harry trusts you then so do I,” Draco said.
“Well, Draco, I’m asking you to eat some pizza with me. Deliberately.”
“Thanks,” Harry says.
“Give it to me,” Draco says.
Bellatrix laughed.
And so we reach the end... for the moment. This felt like a good place to leave them given the premise of the story but as mentioned before I have plans for more. When the story continues I'll be continuing both with new Tinder adventures with other characters but with more of Harry and Draco's relationship, date by date.
“Hmm,” Draco says, mouth full of meaty pizza.
The entire group laughed at her comment. Great, these idiots were gonna be lots of fun, she thought.
“Harry, I’m sorry. I fucked up.”
“If you thought I was hot too.”
“Yes, daddy,” Harry says, stopping only for a second before continuing.
Ginny looks around the room, blinking.
Draco undoes his seatbelt and Harry does the same. Draco wets his lips and Harry wonders how they feel. Is Draco a good kisser? Does the dick live up to his own bravado? Harry turns his body to face Draco.
“I do. But I also don’t want to leave you. They’ll come for you too,” Draco said, brushing his hands through her dark brown hair.
“Are you feeling all right?” she said.
“I am. It’s just… funny. Stings a little even though it’s what I’m comfortable with too. I don’t want to be your girlfriend but I want to believe you want me to be your girlfriend. Is that fucked up?” Daphne said.
Harry raises an eyebrow and folds his arms in front of him.
“Do you hear that?” Draco said, looking around the house.
“I’m definitely gonna need a large,” Harry says, breathing hard as he fumbles about, presumably for his phone.
“What? I was fine just how we were,” Harry says and reinitiates the kiss.
Harry shrugs.
Draco rips at his jerky with his teeth and says, “No.”
“Awesome. Thanks,” Harry says and kisses Draco’s cheek.
“You better,” Draco says, his smile seeming genuine.
“I’m sorry, babe. You know you don’t have to stay. You could go with her. We’d miss you but… you could go,” Alicia said.
“Let’s go back to myself,” Harry said.
The sun hurt. It hurt badly.
He cools off a bit on the drive. Tchaikovsky is back on but quieter. It starts to rain, a welcome sight after a long summer. They arrive in Columbia City faster than Harry expects. He’s disappointed as they pull back into the parking lot at his apartment.
“God, Harry. Ohhh. You love it, don’t you?”
“That’s… nothing,” the vampire said.
Draco thought it would take at least four dates, maybe five before he and Harry shared a bed. Not that he has a plan or anything. He’s much too nervous when it comes to Harry in order to have a plan. But now he has to figure out how to make sure Harry knows he’s not ready to hookup without seeming out of character. Draco Malfoy, as others probably see him, definitely is a horn dog only looking for one thing. But Draco as he knows himself has hang-ups and isn’t ready for the disappointment of him and Harry not fitting.
“What? I like to have good vision before doing anything like… this,” Harry said, quickly undoing Draco’s slacks and pulling out his pale, pink cock.
He takes a deep breath and opens his messages, quickly scrolling to the top. He clicks on the first picture. It’s Draco, naked from the waist up, the photo ending just short of his groin. Draco’s body looks better than even Harry could imagine. He looks up at his face. Draco is dragging a finger down his bottom lip, his grey eyes looking ready to give Harry want he wants. Harry’s eyes go down. Draco is quite thin but his lean muscles are quite appealing. Harry can imagine his fingers sliding over them, enjoying all his has to offer.
“Good taste.”
“It’s fine. Just all part of the adventure, right?” Harry says and puts an arm around Draco, pulling him to his side.
“I don’t know what to say. I had no idea. I… didn’t even know you were bi,” Harry said.
“He’ll be civil. I promise.”
“I’m up here. In your bedroom,” Pansy said.
“Jesus!” Pansy screeched.
Draco goes over to the bar where Ginny and Cho were chatting and sits down there but around the corner so it doesn’t seem like he’s invading. Harry joins him, giving him a kiss before he sits down.
“Fuck the master,” Pansy grunted, trying to sit up, not liking the feel of cold and ash covered concrete on her butt.
“I think hiking is really suiting you,” Harry says.
“Shut
Harry frowned.
“Tell me about it. I mean don’t get me wrong, I love animals and I guess it beats flipping burgers. But I want to do something meaningful with my life. Something that matters. I want to help people.”
Astoria pushed his hands out of the way, reaching between her legs to touch herself. Draco always let her finish a couple of times before he did. Not that he could stop her if he tried. After he finally finished they cuddled for a bit before having dinner. They watched a movie after that but halfway through they started fooling around, Draco bending her over the ottoman. Then again in the bathtub.
“Sorry. I think I’m really fast,” Pansy grinned and the woman backed up, looking scared.
“Hey, Pansy,” Alicia said, putting a hand on her shoulder as Angelina and Katie left the basement.
Pansy smiled and nodded.
“Do you live here?”
“Not really. I can change a tire. If you need that.”
“I told you to get the fuck back,” Pansy said, walking up, gun still held in front of her.
“Yeah. I just… need a moment.”
“Fuck no!” Draco said, and pushed down on the gas, sending the vampire flying.
Next, they play Settlers of Catan, a game he has actually heard of. Harry performs terribly. Draco does ok. Ginny wins the game. Draco decides to go outside and get some fresh air. He’s not so high anymore. He sometimes thinks he should start smoking cigarettes just for the excuse. The truth is he just likes having quiet for his own thoughts. And right now his thoughts are very Harry-centric and he thinks the cool night air might ease his hormones.
Draco sighed and nodded.
“Let me rephrase then. Never have I ever knowingly not left a tip.”
“Draco. On Friday my friends are having a party. Would you like to come?”
It is only a five-minute walk so they don’t bother with an Uber. The inn sits on a corner, a yellow building with red roofs. European style in design. Still, it is only a two-star hotel so Draco isn’t expecting anything too fancy.
“Funny. I gave this ring to Ginny. Before she disappeared. Fire didn’t hurt it,” Harry said.
Draco rests his head against Harry’s hand. What is it about this man that makes him feel so calm? So safe.
“Listen, I just need to find Draco. I need to talk to him. Tell him I’m sorry and that I couldn’t… control myself,” Pansy said, pulling herself to her feet.
He takes more than he expects before he finds it impossible to breathe, lifting off.
“No one? Well, shit. Worth a try. I’ll get you next time…”
“Go. I’ll be fine,” Draco says.
“Hey, I’ve shaved while drunk!”
Pansy was kind of the one who figured it out. You remember her, right? Pansy Parkinson. She joked about me being gay for years. Because I got so obsessed over guys. And other stuff. It’s kind of embarrassing. Finally I… tested the waters and found out she wasn’t totally off-base. I’m bi.
Harry got in the car and put on his seatbelt, the man quickly getting back into traffic.
“Where are we?” Harry asks, rubbing his eyes.
The woman looked at the rest of the group who all shook their heads.
“No. But maybe you want to leave the option open.”
“Sure was.”
“Lay back. Let me take control,” Astoria said and Draco obeyed.
Just then the door to the house swung open, four vampires sauntering out.
Draco walked over to the tree, placing his hand on it, needing something to steady himself.
“Looks like,” Harry said.
“Yeah, that was rude,” a voice said, Bellatrix appearing from around the corner of the mausoleum.
“Thank you,” Draco says.
All right. Good night, Harry.
So much for Draco’s erection finally fading. Learning about Harry’s porn habits will have it up for hours, he’s sure of it.
“What? Listen, you don’t have to hurt me. Let’s just relax. Sit down and relax ‘till the ambulance comes,” Darlene said, backing into an end table next to a sofa.
“Dammit,” Draco sighed.
Noises had gotten loud back at the house. Pansy glanced back around, seeing more vampires had arrived. Seemed like the others had it covered so Pansy reverted to paying attention to the vampire she’d impaled.
“A vegan… vampire?” Darlene said.
“Same thing that guy in the shower did to himself,” Draco said with a sneer.
,” Harry said.
“Hmm. Interesting choice.”
“If you say so. It’s still your turn.”
might come looking for us,” Draco said.
“We’ve been dating for two weeks. What do you think?” Draco says.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?”
“You don’t have to do anything. Let’s uh… start over. Will you please sit down?” Draco says.
“I’m starting to think you’re hitting on me,” Draco says, raising his eyebrows.
“All that stuff I said on Tinder. We don’t have to do any of that. I just wanted to be clear. I’m into you either way,” Draco says.
Pansy got out of bed too, sliding her panties back on then searching for her bra.
Draco had that urge to run and hide but he felt magnetized to the moment, unable to stop himself from letting it play out. He was also feeling aroused which wasn’t making things any easier.
“I’m sorry for… everything. For being a dick. For saying so many nasty things. That was wrong.”
“I know. It’s a disappointment for me too,” Draco says, touching Harry’s face gently.
Probably. I don’t live with them anymore, though. I can’t say everything I own I got my own way but I don’t get money from them anymore.
“For giving me someone I can drink from without being afraid of killing them. I was worried cause Darlene is really nice. But you’re a dick so I won’t feel bad,” Pansy said, and ripped him off of Darlene.
A half-hour later the car stops in the middle of a small town east of Salem. Draco just has enough time to turn off the main road to park in front of someone’s house in what is a very nice neighborhood.
“Miss? Miss?” the woman called out and Pansy left the bathroom, arriving back downstairs in a flash, making the woman scream.
Harry laughs.
Darlene lied and told them some man had come in and attacked her then ran off with Charlie’s body into the woods. Pansy had been nice a full of energy after feeding, enough to be able to race off with Charlie’s body and be back in a flash. They’d find him eventually. At least if they figured out she did it she’d get to find out who she was.
“Uhh,” Harry said, feeling very uncomfortable.
“All right.”
“Nothin’ in the bathroom,” a different, more familiar high voice said, disturbing Draco.
,” Draco said.
“Yeah. You see, you-know-who wanted to swell his forces. He wanted Death Troopers who could come swarming in the night. He wanted people to fear leaving their homes. He wanted people to fear the dark. Fear us. So he did some real deep, dark magic and he brought us back,” Pansy said.
Harry doesn’t respond. His brain is turning into mush. His body belongs to Draco now. Draco continues to gently use the toy on him, up and down the shaft. Harry wants to come. He really does. But he can’t. It’s hardly a matter of choice. He can’t and won’t until Draco wills it.
Draco was surprised to find the backdoor unlocked. He opened it, then closed and locked it quickly. He stood there with his hand against the door, breathing hard. He jerked as there were sounds of footsteps coming from above. He quickly looked around the dark of the room he was in, appearing to be a kitchen. He couldn’t see anywhere to hide as the footsteps came down the stairs.
“That is a waste.”
“I’m me. I swear the story behind everything is less interesting than it seems,” Neville says, looking very embarrassed.
“It wasn’t really a breakup. It was just a conversation. And we decided the timing wasn’t right.”
“Does that mean that we should start holding hands from now on? Just in case?” Harry joked.
This is pretty fucking weird, right?
“Come for me,” Draco whispered and Harry moaned, loud and deep.
“But there’s a lot we can still do. If you want. All those things I said… I haven’t done most of them. When I asked Pansy to call me daddy she laughed in my face. They are fantasies. You’re realit.”
Neville drinks.
Harry looks at the river and says, “I wish I could live in the woods. Have a cabin. Chop some firewood.”
Harry nods and gets his juice from the fridge, heading back into the bedroom. He hasn’t seen his ex-girlfriend, Ron’s sister, Ginny in months. He has a feeling she will be amused by recent developments in his life.
Draco did as Harry requested. Harry slipped on his glasses which made Draco giggle.
“My days all start to feel the same. Now that I’m done with college. Well, done for now. I really want to go back and get my Master’s.”
Somehow that peck feels more intimate than most of their make-out kisses. You don’t give pecks to someone you’re just dating. You give pecks to a boyfriend. Draco isn’t a boyfriend but damn that felt natural.
“I’ve been very nervous… about my size. Worried I was just… broken and no one would ever want to…”
Ginny sighs and says, “I was twenty.”
“I need to get back to work,” Harry said.
“So, what
“Since you don’t listen to real music-“
“Holy shit. I’m a vampire! Darlene, I’m a vampire!” Pansy said, grinning.
“You can’t tell me that all you do is read and drive around.”
Draco looks away towards the window, remembering himself at age five. Before things got bad. Such a bright, silly boy.
“Yeah. So, then there was all that business with me and Hermione. The curse. There was only one way to break it… And even after I did… It was like I died. I didn’t feel whole anymore. Not until I met Astoria. But even now… Anyhow, to break the curse I had to kill someone I cared about. Someone I had desired. There… weren’t many options,” Draco admitted.
Ginny: “Never have I ever stabbed someone and left them for dead.”
“Are we doing the thing next Friday?”
“Who even fights with swords?” Pansy complained, her sword having just been knocked out of her hands by Alicia.
“No, no, no! You don’t understand. It
“I’m learning far too much about my little sister tonight,” Ron says, almost to himself.
“There’s a pond. When it’s warm I go for a swim. Naked. Eventually, I marry and we have a blissful relationship, living on the land being one with nature.”
“I am not. I’ve seen things. Here and there. Mostly at school or with friends with parents less strict than mine. Like I said, you and I had very different upbringings.”
“Which part? There are many perks to being my boyfriend.”
Just then there was a boom, something hitting Bellatrix in the chest, knocking her to the ground.
“I’m Pansy. Pleased to meet you,” Pansy said, sticking her hand out.
“Possibly. Either way after a month of searching I’m relieved someone knows I exist. It’s so weird. It’s like… there’s nothing. Except for my house,” Harry said.
“Christ. You must have a concussion. I’m calling a doctor,” the woman said, heading off into another room.
Hmm. Still a bit of a dick.
“I do. Always have. I never really hated you. I think if I had been more comfortable in myself… things might’ve been different.”
Draco didn’t speak. He knew that voice. Or was he only hearing what he wanted to hear? The figure arrived in the kitchen and moonlight illuminated his face.
“You could go into porn.”
“Yeah. I own a house up in Lake City. A big one. Sounds like it was sold to me a few years ago but I can’t figure out who by. Which is weird too,” Harry said.
Harry has been consumed with wondering just how Draco and Pansy were sexually incompatible. What does that even mean? Is Pansy a freak in bed? Or is Draco? Harry wonders which would be worse. If Draco is a freak maybe he’s too much of a freak for Harry. But if Draco isn’t a freak maybe he’s boring? Or maybe that’s not even it. Maybe they couldn’t agree about who was on top? Harry could work with that.
“I didn’t say anything. Just surprised,” Ron says, seeming more dumbstruck than surprised.
“Me either. We’ve both lived in Western Washington all our lives. You’d think we’d know what the trees are.”
“I have nothing to say to you,” Draco snapped coldly.
“Your dick. She didn’t like your dick,” Harry says.
Sooner than you might think. It’s kind of a long story.
Sounds good. I think I’m going to bed early. Nice to be well rested for work tomorrow.
“Do you know this name? Can you remember it?” Harry asked, showing Draco the paper, his finger pointing at the words ‘Godric’s Hollow’.
“No, no, no, no!” Pansy plead, shaking her hands in front of her.
“Ok. By my count… three?”
Draco lets out a loud laugh then quickly stifles himself.
“Pansy, you can’t go out during the day!” Draco protested.
Harry touched Draco’s shoulder. He wished he had Harry’s knack for knowing when to show physical affection. Astoria was always affectionate like that. Draco always felt awkward. He had learned to be that way with Astoria but it was still hard.
“No. I’m not. Sorry,” Draco apologized.
The three of them slowly walked across the town. All the fires were long since out. There were no sounds aside from barking dogs. The cemetery was up on a hill, once you passed through the main gate. Draco and Pansy silently followed Harry to the mausoleum where Bellatrix had been bound.
“If you like,” Harry says, thinking he needs a cold shower fast.
“It’s been a year. A year to the day,” Draco said as he and Harry stood together in Pike Place Market, watching ferries crossing Elliot Bay.
“Move your ass, Harry,” Draco calls.
Harry nods and goes out. Draco takes a deep breath and follows, wishing he were suddenly wearing looser jeans. Everyone seems distracted though. All Draco can think about is getting Harry back where he was, pinned against the sink. He sits back next to Harry, sliding his hand onto his thigh, not wasting any time. Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat, looking at Draco helplessly. Something about his face says that if Draco wanted he would let him jerk him off right there under the table. Draco looks into Harry’s green eyes and smiles. Harry makes a soft sound, almost like a whimper, and swallows. Draco bites his lip and removes his hand, thinking that leaving him to stew is better torture.
“Anywhere. Everywhere. Just get up and drive.”
She wasn’t really sure what she wanted to do now. She was tired. She had slept a little while Darlene was gone but it wasn’t enough. She wasn’t hungry yet. She figured she must belong somewhere but she couldn’t be sure where.
“Yeah,” Draco said, feeling relief as he fell to the floor in exhaustion, the scratches on his abdomen burning.
“No. I’m trying to rebind her. I was there and helped the first time. Maybe I can do it again,” Harry said.
The door opened. A tanned, blonde haired woman was standing inside.
“I was sleeping in the basement. I got the other troopers to let me stay behind in the Hollow so that I could find and kill both of you,” Pansy laughed then clarified, “Obviously, I’m not gonna do that, though if I did kill you, for the record, you do kinda deserve it, Draco.”
“So, we both lost our memories at the same time. I had your name all over my stuff and you think you saw my name on some of your papers. Guess we were friends,” Draco said.
“Fuck you. But listen. Last night I dreamt that… we’re exactly where we need to be. I dreamt that someday people are going to come into the very cafe you work at and they will know who you are. And then we’ll all… try to find a way to go home. That place… the one whose name we can’t remember. In my dream I knew it. In my dream we went home… hand in hand,” Draco said.
“But reality is a dream. Every dream is just another level of reality,” Draco said.
She looked around. She was in the woods. In the woods… somewhere. Her skin seemed to be smoking.
“Oh, I got that from the vest. See, I woke up with no memory. It’s a long story,” Pansy said.
Now. Let me know what you think? I promise this is just the tip of the iceberg. And remember, if this all sounds good to you: you can’t jerk off. Save it. Every drop. Enjoy your day ;)
No. Stop that. Mind out of the gutter, Draco chides himself. This is why he needs to play it cool with Harry. The last thing, the
Pansy wandered around, looking for a bathroom. She didn’t need to pee. Her arms seemed to be healing quickly. She thought maybe if she just splashed some water on her face she would feel better. It didn’t sound like anyone else was in the house. Just that nice farmer lady downstairs.
“Yeah. Pizza.”
“Not this time,” Draco laughed.
A hand slid up her skirt, feeling her through her underwear as she squirmed.
“I had a great time,” Draco says.
“Hmm. That makes it sound more planned.”
Draco smiles.
“Ok. If we’re all ready, I’ll go first. Never have I ever cheated on a partner,” Ron says.
“Shit,” Harry says, immediately feeling tense.
Their search for the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who was working with the Death Troopers and had turned Katie’s girlfriend, Leanne, into a werewolf as well was getting to be exhausting.
Same actually. Well, it’s not such a long story. But I only realized recently. A month ago.
“Not you. It was someone else and I promise the sex with the partner in question was terrible and he didn’t care anymore,” Ginny says.
“Can you come down, please?” Darlene asked.
Draco has him out of the cuffs fast. Harry guides him onto the bed then gets between his legs. He grabs Draco’s dick with both hands and resumes sucking it. Somehow it seems like he can take more of it. Maybe he just doesn’t care how much it strains his jaw or makes it hard to breathe. He just sucks hard, hungrily drooling down the big shaft.
“Oh wow. That’s actually hard. You know as much as I love Tchaikovsky I think I have to go with Mozart.”
was not far away. Draco shuddered as his mind flashed to
“You don’t get to ask one, I guess.”
“Come on, man. Don’t jinx it.”
Draco laughs.
“OK,” Draco said, feeling on the verge of bursting.
“Are you a vampire?”
Draco shares a look of camaraderie with Hermione and she gives him a small smile. Next to Draco Harry is sitting back and smiling.
Maybe half an hour passed before Harry suddenly spoke: “You’re not sleeping either, are you?”
“No. I’m sorry. I’m not feeling all right. I’m having some amnesia,” Harry said, deciding to be honest.
“And what did you want to be doing?”
“Where’s Astoria?” Harry asked.
Draco smirks and lifts his hand to give the so-so gesture.
“I feel fine but I should wait longer, right? I don’t usually do this,” Draco says.
Just trying to be my own man.
“Right. Cuddling is a gateway drug for boning. Everyone knows that,” Draco jokes.
Harry’s mouth falls open.
“Yeah. Sorry. Though I must admit: I told him to expect two,” Daphne said sadly.
They did go back to Draco’s car, to retrieve some stuff he had left in the trunk. Just some files and papers. Notes for the future. It was otherwise completely wrecked and he had lost the keys at some point the night before.
“Big man, excuse you,” Draco says, chuckling softly.
“That you did.”
“Oh. Shit,” Harry gasped.
“Yeah. Your heartbeat. It’s too loud. It’s like… drums. Turn it down,” Pansy said, uncomfortably.
“Ow. Fuck,” Draco groaned as he pulled his car door open, falling to the ground.
He walks to Harry’s front door thinking just how damn hard it was to find a perfect outfit that didn’t make him look like some rich prick while also showed off his actual worth. He is wearing a tee-shirt and jeans but they are still nice and snug in all the right places. It is important they know that he wasn’t just thin, he is lean and has form and shape. He works hard for this body and he needs them all to know.
The door to the basement they were training in opened, Katie and Angelina walking in.
“Fuck you.”
Harry and Draco come over and sit down on what sofa space is left. Ginny and Cho are both kneeling at the table while Neville, Ron, and Hermione are on the sofa.
“Well. That was a hell of a drive. Hell of a second date,” Harry says.
“Me too. I’ve been thinking about taking off,” Daphne said, stretching her entire body, her back lifting in an arch.
“It’s really embarrassing. I was thirteen.”
“Not too useless. She killed that abusive husband pretty good,” Angelina said.
“Me either.”
Draco looked inside the shower then quickly fell to the toilet and puked.
Cho is a very pretty trans girl Harry used to date for a little while in high school. Draco used to hate her. Now he understands why.
Eventually, she found what looked like an old farmhouse. She raced onto the porch and sighed with relief as her skin stopped smoking. She needed water… or something. A shower maybe. She felt confused. Desperate. She was hungry. So hungry.
“Yeah. Get in,” the man said.
He looked at his contacts. There was nothing in there. Certainly not a number for Harry Potter. He sighed. There was another word written on one of the papers: Godric’s Hollow, he grabbed his phone deciding to look it up but by the time he had opened a browser, he couldn’t remember the name. He looked again. Godric’s Hollow. Looked at his phone and it was already gone.
“Oh? Which one?” Draco asked.
Nah, Ginny and I broke up in college. I’ve dated here and there since then but nothing serious.
“You can’t?” the woman said.
Harry and Ginny both drink, not looking at each other. Everyone, including Draco, laughs.
“Oh my God,” Harry says.
“Fair enough. My point was I’ve never really been around anyone who smoked weed,” Draco says.
“You have to feed. You need your strength. You can feel the hunger in your core. If you deny it eventually it will become too much and you won’t even be able to control yourself. Feed. Drink him dry,” the woman barked.
“Oh, balls. You guys are gonna be huge bummers,” Pansy groaned.
Draco smiled and shook Harry’s hand.
“It was peculiar. They got close then… something happened. And they weren’t here anymore,” Bellatrix said.
Draco gets on the bed. Harry feels his dick touch Harry’s lower back, rubbing up against his crack. Just the thought of it being inside him is insane but he wants it. Eventually. Draco slaps him with it, making loud popping sounds.
“We have pigs. You can eat one of our pigs,” Darlene suggested.
“We should also probably not talk,” Harry said, Pansy huffing in response.
The next night they crouched outside the supposed death trooper nest in silent trepidation. The trouble was they weren’t sure how many were actually in the nest. It could be three vampires or twenty. Though it seemed too quiet for a large number. It was an old, abandoned house in the woods with boarded-up windows. They would have to break in the front door.
“Neville. Who are you?” Hermione says, chuckling.
“Mmm. Suck it, Harry,” Draco says.
“Yeah,” Harry said and placed it on the sole end-table in the room.
“Do you want to come in my mouth?” Harry asked, then licked up Draco’s shaft before gliding his mouth up and down the head again.
“I don’t know. If there are any other survivors they might be headed there too. Draco, there’s something about the Death Troopers… I don’t think they come out during the day. They showed up just after sundown,” Harry said.
“No. Is this a date?”
His roommates are on the couch playing Playstation. Harry isn’t that into games but he does like to watch sometimes.
“Not as strange as the things I had written down. Plus this random book by someone named Remus Lupin. I tried looking him up but guess what?” Harry said.
“It’s all yours,” Harry said.
Astoria smiled and said, “I’m stronger than you. I can handle myself. And I have a plan if everything goes badly. Besides, this is your family’s town. His people won’t touch the name Malfoy. Not if they know what’s good for them.”
“Probably.” Harry thinks with the way Draco has been looking at him with those grey eyes he’s definitely thinking of burying something.
“Coming from you that must be high praise.”
“Dogs. I like dogs more.”
“Do you know what kind of trees these are?” Draco asks, gesturing around them.
“Then we’ve gotta find her,” Draco said.
The man was twitching and shaking it. Pansy didn’t hesitate, dropping down and digging her fangs into him. The blood was rich and her body warmed. She drained him fast, disappointed when there was nothing left. She stood up, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. She could feel her pulse. She felt alive.
“I bet you can’t wait to fuck it.”
“No, you aren’t.”
Just like Draco, Harry wasted little time. They weren’t making love and they were barely even fucking. Draco didn’t know what it was. It didn’t mean much but it meant something. It made him feel alive. If they could survive the end of the world then maybe there could be more. So much more.
“I don’t see any remains. Not that I expected any,” Harry said.
“It was fine.”
Draco is sure it will be a fun conversation when Draco also really hasn’t seen much porn but that was a topic for another day.
“Sounds good to me,” Draco says and Harry leans over to kiss him.
“Welcome to the team. Do as we say, don’t kill anyone and don’t get in our way or we’ll kill you,” Angelina said, pulling her hand away.
“How did you even find us?” Draco asked.
“I don’t know.”
Draco nodded and inhaled.
“Don’t get sidetracked. Pansy…” Harry said.
“It’s a start,” Draco admitted.
“No. Too much on my mind,” Draco said.
“You too!” she said and he left.
“OK. Maybe a little evil. But we have to eat! It’s just like humans with meat. They kill so they can survive. But, but we don’t kill! We keep them alive,” she insisted.
“If we keep making out I don’t think I will be able to resist.”
Pansy watched the way he squeezed Darlene’s arm and her hunger reached fever pitch.
“Godric’s Hollow. All the time. Can’t remember much about it now. It’s like… someone wanted to erase it from the world,” Alicia said.
“Aren’t you twenty-one?” Cho asks.
“Do I smell weed?” Neville says, standing up and sniffing.
Draco looks smug again and says, “Thanks for swiping right,” with a wink.
“I’ve known you for a year now. You’re a good person. And you’ve mellowed,” Alicia said.
“I’m rooting for Draco,” Ginny says from the floor, sounding tired.
“Umm. I have a name. Everyone has a name,” she said, desperately trying to remember as she examined the vest.
He steps into the center of the living room and slowly lifts up his tee-shirt. Draco is leaning back on the sofa, slumped, his big dick in his hand, slowly stroking it. Harry wishes he could just climb onto his lap and impale himself but he doesn’t think that’s such a good idea.
Harry laughs and sets his phone aside. The planned trail is the Middle Fork Snoqualmie trail. It will give them flexibility and it’s not one of the harder trails just in case Draco proves to not be up to the challenge.
Harry nods and Draco gets back to sucking. Harry removes his mental blocks, focusing all his energy into unloading into Draco’s mouth. He looks so beautiful.
“So, let’s play a bit of a game. We’ll ask each other questions. Answer a question, ask a question. Back and forth,” Draco says.
“Did you get taller? I don’t remember you being a fucking giraffe,” Ginny says, looking up at him.
Harry laughs and moves up to Draco’s face, giving him a slow kiss and a taste of his own dick. He pulls away again and says, “I want you to tell me what to do. Where do you want me? How do you want me?”
Draco turned the heat on the stovetop off, pouring the chili into a bowl. He then went and set the saucepan in the sink. Draco was much better about doing his dishes than Harry. But Harry thought, in his own defense, he spent a lot of time washing dishes at work. Surely he could be excused a little.
“Draco, you’re going to have to go a lot harder than that,” Harry says.
“Charlie this isn’t the time. Not in front of her,” Darlene begged but Charlie grabbed Darlene’s arm.
“He brought her back as a vampire. A real vampire. Drinks blood. Only goes out at night. Pansy used to love garlic then all the sudden starts freaking out about spaghetti…”
“Oh, well, you should come with me sometime then, shouldn’t you?”
Neville makes a disappointed face and finishes his glass.
the things Draco had done, both good and bad to save himself and Hermione Granger. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Pansy screamed and he shuddered before coming back to reality.
“Are you going to go now? I just want to mourn and get on with my life. Pretend this was all just some terrible dream,” Darlene said.
“Please. No,” Darlene begged.
The next photo is Draco dressed in a suit, looking very well put-together, even for him. In his hand are a pair of leather cuffs. He has a playful grin.
Draco pulls away and Harry says, “Hey.”
“Godric’s Hollow,” Angelina said.
Draco looked at his wife. She was still the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He was afraid to leave. He wanted to trace every line of her body to remember how she feels… just in case. As if she could sense his thoughts, she leaned over into a kiss, slow, warm and soft. He heard the TV turn off as Astoria pulled away.
“Keep them alive? Honey, I’ve fed a little on people with my friends and it leaves them pretty weak. There’s a bunch of you. How many are in the barn?” Pansy asked.
How’s it going?
Draco shrugs.
“Guess not. So, are we going to talk about the daddy thing?” Harry asks.
“Mmm. I want all of them.”
Harry turns his head, lifting his chin. Draco moves his mouth to Harry’s neck, his hot breath doing things to him. Harry feels his lips softly kissing along the side of his neck and then the teeth hit, not too hard but hard enough that his dick feels it. Harry shifts in his seat like someone had just stuck him with a hot poker. Draco doesn’t let go, not at first. Harry bites his own lip and closes his eyes. Draco lets go and Harry exhales, breathing hard as Draco slips back to his seat with a pleased smile.
“Harry, don’t tease me. You don’t have to call me daddy. We can just… cuddle on the couch.”
Harry reaches up and unzips him then uses both hands to unbutton him. He pulls apart his belt then pulls his pants and underwear down enough for it to pop out. It’s a sight to behold. When standing straight up it the head reaches up to where Draco’s belly button probably is. Calling it thick is an understatement. Draco is right. Best not to try anal tonight. At least not with that.
“You’re so fucking cute. God, how late is it?” Draco says, pulling his phone out.
She couldn’t let herself be captured. She was hoping to at least hear from Draco again but he must not have landed in Seattle yet. She sighed and stood up. She would not be intimidated. She walked barefoot through her house. She slid on her house shoes. She wouldn’t need much more where she was going. She’d spent the last year coming up with this plan. Meghan taught her some of this magic. The rest she had figured out herself.
“Does it count if your ex-boyfriend was a dick?” Ginny asks.
“But you’re going to have to prove yourself. Come with us to the cemetery. You said it’s a trap. Help us,” Harry asked.
“The ambulance is on the way. Maybe you should sit down,” Darlene said.
“Sorry. Dammit,” Draco grunted as Harry continued to dab.
“I don’t know, Harry. I don’t think hanging out with people who hate me sounds like fun.”
“Oh yeah?”
“House?” Draco replied.
“Yes and no. So much more was wrong with us than that. So much. I mean there was hardly anything that was right. Pansy wasn’t keen on the rough stuff. Any of it. And she, uh… Jesus, this is embarrassing,” Draco says, looking like he wanted to flee rather than finish what he was saying.
“Are we going to talk about the gag reflex thing?” Draco counters.
“You do please me. Your very presence does that,” Draco says.
“What the fuck?” Pansy asked then added, “Where’s Draco?”
So, I think we should talk about when to seal this deal.
“Hey, leave him alone!” Pansy said and Bellatrix knocked her back again.
“Definitely. I’m trying to remember how many of my friends were still in town. Ron and Hermione disappeared. Ginny, Luna and Neville too. Remus and Sirius… they’re all gone,” Harry said.
“Does Astoria know?” Harry asked.
Harry stood up and stretched.
“I don’t suppose you’re good with cars,” Draco says.
Harry pulls his mouth off to breathe. He looks up at Draco who is panting above him.
So, uh. When did you realize? That you liked men.
There’s no further reply. In fact, it’s not until Thursday night when Harry next hears from Draco.
Draco makes a little tut sound then whispers again, “When I get home I’m going to get on Tinder and tell you every single thing I want to do to you. What do you think about that?”
He pulls up into Harry’s parking slot, nice and easy. Harry is leaning against the wall wearing tight blue jeans, held in place by a brown, probably faux-leather, belt that reminds Draco of the western wear that his father used to wear when they would go to their Colorado summer home when he was a child. On top, he’s wearing a Seahawks tee-shirt. Draco wonders if he should start watching football.
“The party.”
“Oh. OK. Oh, that’s up in Lake City,” she said.
Harry chuckled.
Draco slid behind Harry, placing an arm around his and another over his shoulder. Harry chuckled softly as his feet found Draco’s under the covers and rubbed them affectionately. Draco pressed his groin into Harry’s back, overwhelmed with desire, suspecting they both could use some release. Draco sucked on the side of Harry’s neck and slid his hand down Harry’s firm stomach, to his groin. Draco roughly rubbed the bulge in Harry’s jeans, wishing they were both in less clothing.
“Oh. Well, you’re dressed like you’re SWAT or something,” the woman said, gesturing at her.
She lights a joint, taking a puff then handing it to Draco. Draco holds it in his fingers like it’s a bomb or some sort of dangerous chemical he can’t drop. Ginny exhales then gestures at him urgently. Draco lifts it to his lips and inhales. Smoke fills his lungs and his coughs.
“Yeah. Who’s coming?”
There’s a knock at the door. Harry goes to answer it. The second he opens it a tiny red-haired woman leaps onto Harry. Ginny Weasley. Ron’s sister and Harry’s other ex. The serious one.
Unable to tolerate the sun any longer he stuck out his thumb. Wasn’t sure how he knew to do that but hopefully someone would stop. It wasn’t successful at first. Eventually, a car pulled up, the driver rolling down the window. Older white guy. Looked a little gruff.
As these things go, the walk back somehow feels faster. Harry supposes that’s because they are moving faster. The sun moves from its peak to the beginnings of a sunset as they move back down the trail.
Bellatrix stuck her palm forward, a shock of silver knocking the pistol from Pansy’s hand.
“No place like home? That’s funny,” Draco said, with a chuckle.
“Can’t I eat you just a little bit. Just a tiny bit,” Pansy asked, demonstrating with her thumb and index finger.
Just as Draco was certain she would dig in deeper the closet door shut with a slam and the person stomped down the stairs. Neither of them moved until the sounds had passed. Draco was thinking that if he were them that he would just wait downstairs just in case anyone decide to out themselves as having been hiding. Under different circumstances Draco might’ve enjoyed being wedged this close to Harry but currently he felt terrified and suffocated.
Won’t they find out?
He kisses Draco’s cheek and puts an arm around his back. Good, Harry can touch him again without sending his dick into overdrive. Progress. For the moment, anyhow.
Abs. Abs. More abs. Guy in just his underwear. A woman hiking. A man hiking. A man hiking shirtless. Why is everyone into hiking?
“I can’t tell if you’re joking and that disturbs me.”
Harry closes his eyes. There’s silence then Draco strikes. Harry jumps but bites his lip to stop himself from making a sound. It burns but feels good as the burn fades. Draco does it again and again. Harry refuses to give Draco any satisfaction. He doesn’t want him to hold back.
Harry shrugs.
?” Harry demanded.
She drifted out into the woods again, silently wandering. She occasionally so strange flashes of light in the distance but couldn’t make out what they were. A wolf howled and Pansy was momentarily frightened. But then she realized she could probably kick a wolf’s ass if she wanted to. Not that she would. The idea was upsetting actually.
“You’re going to keep watch?”
He had forgotten that Harry didn’t know what the Death Troopers were.
“Harry, I need to take you into my bedroom. I’m going to cuff you and test your pain threshold,” Draco says.
Haha you’ve gotta be fuckin’ kidding me. That’s a fight I’m not ready to have.
“I don’t think that’s for me. I don’t see how you can find any sort of meaningful relationship on a dating app.”
Draco laughs but continues to kiss him. The next few days without Harry were going to be hard. Harry finally pulls away and gets out of the car.
That’s good, I guess.
Draco looks surprised. He stares for a second and says, “Is anyone we went to school with going?”
“You don’t need it to survive. I’m sorry you ever felt you did,” Harry says.
“Yeah. Kinda is.”
They finish eating and Draco pays the bill. Harry doesn’t even look at it. He doesn’t want to know.
They both looked at Alicia who said and said, “Aye,” raising her hand.
Harry gets to his feet and sticks a hand out.
“Is your name Pansy?” a shorter black woman asked.
Draco complies, doing the other side then back again. It’s not so bad once Harry is used to it. After several rounds on his back, Draco goes back to his ass, using it to pop him harder than he could with his hand. Harry relaxes and lets the sensations happen, swimming in endorphins. Time loses meaning. There’s only him, Draco, and the flogger now.
“Harry,” Ron says.
“What if you can’t stop?” Darlene asked.
“Dogs?”
Pansy sighed.
“Fuck off, little girl. The adults are talking,” Charlie said, his eyes on Darlene.
“My parent’s house was on fire. They were waiting for me,” Draco said.
“Yeah, but why do we even need weapons? Our bodies are weapons,” Pansy said.
Draco scoffed and growled. He didn’t want to say it. It was so stupid.
She banged on the door.
“You want to offer ourselves up?” Draco said, appalled.
“Look. He’s already going to die. You may as well feed. Don’t worry. He’ll enjoy it,” the woman said.
“Wants to kiss me?”
“What happened with Ginny?”
“Good boy. I thought you were going to come.”
He says, “How does Sunday sound to you? That’ll give us a couple of rest days. Also, I should be off work.”
“Three? Really? Then what was all the counting about?”
“Ginny’s coming?”
Draco moved his hand over just a little, tapping Harry’s fingertips with his own. Harry instantly let their fingers slide together until their palms were pressed as one. Draco could feel himself blushing but he did not let go.
“I’m hysterical,” Draco says, cracking a smile.
Draco ordered coffee then waited for Harry to be done. Outside it was a lovely August afternoon. Draco sort of liked Seattle. Though he couldn’t recall other places so he supposed his frame of reference was limited.
Two years before Harry Potter had lead a battle against the Dark Lord’s right hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange. A bunch of people disappeared after that battle. Draco hadn’t been there but he had heard it was devastating and rather than defeating her, Bellatrix was bound to the town, unable to escape. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen if she ever escaped but it probably wouldn’t be good.
“So, what do we do?” Draco asked.
“Four plus a study,” Harry said.
“Typical.”
“No. Hey, what’s your name?” Pansy asked, stepping closer to the woman.
Cho: “Never have I ever cheated on an exam.”
“Sounds like a country song,” Pansy grinned.
“And you’ll have me. I’m like super fast and really strong. Like I think I could jump over a freakin’ house if I tried,” Pansy said, like she was bragging about her words per minute at an interview for a desk job.
I’ve done all I can tonight. I’m heading home. I’ll get whatever I didn’t get today tomorrow.
“Yeah. You moved back to town. We bumped into each other and… I saw you in a new light. We weren’t adversaries. We were just… two guys. And I realised that everything I had hated about you I really loved about you. I was jealous because you were everything I was taught not to admire or desire. I tried to fight it though. I didn’t want to be gay. A queer. So I got some gay porn to scare myself out of it. It was just a phase, I was sure of it.”
“Why not? We know who he is. What he really is,” Astoria insisted.
“What’s the punishment for not answering?” Harry says.
“Take off your shirt,” Harry said, leaving Draco on a bed while he rifled through a bathroom cabinet.
“Cats. Or. Dogs?”
“Nothing at all,” Draco says.
“I guess it is,” Harry said, realizing he’d barely noticed.
“This is a big house for one person. How many bedrooms?” Draco asked.
and he gets those pesky fucking butterflies in his belly.
“Harry… I don’t want to have sex with you tonight. I’m not ready,” Draco says.
“Guns don’t kill vampires. Swords can. I could cut off your head, for instance,” Alice said, swinging her sword towards Pansy’s neck which Pansy barely blocked.
“Oh no.”
Harry sighs and says, “All right. I’m going. I… uh…”
“Excuse you, I was an evil vampiric puppet of the Dark Lord’s servant at the time,” Pansy said with a scoff.
It’s almost midnight.
Good, I think. I’ve gotta say I think the outdoors look suits me.
Silently they moved through the house, Harry helping Draco to walk with an arm around his back. Draco had thought of Harry holding him so many times before but never under circumstances like this. It was stupid to think of it now, Draco knew, but something about his touch had always felt electric.
Ginny raises a hand and says, “I’m out but I have.”
She was shaking. It was a cold night. Pansy wished she had something to cover her with. Her clothes were torn and tattered as it was. Pansy touched her fingers to Daphne’s throat. Her pulse was faint and fading. She was dying. Pansy could feel it.
“Yeah. Don’t you think?”
“Just us,” Harry says.
“It wasn’t the most immediate concern, but sure, I’m curious,” Draco said.
The streets of the town were quiet. Corpses were in yards and on sidewalks. Some houses still burned. People’s pets were crying out in sadness. Draco pictured Astoria back at home, clutching a pillow to her chest, filled with fear as dark servants tried to break in. He wiped a secret tear from his eye that he was certain Potter hadn’t seen. He knew she could handle herself but he couldn’t erase the fear.
“We all feel the same about you,” Alicia said.
“Feed,” the woman commanded her.
Harry came down the stairs and sighed, a backpack slung over his shoulder. Draco hadn’t noticed that before. He supposed it had been too dark last night.
When Harry awakes they are passing through Salem, Oregon, which seems nice enough.
Draco sighs and says, “Ok. I’ll trust you.”
“You saw her die?” Harry said suspiciously.
“No. It was good,” Harry says and kisses Draco again.
“Nothing but static. Dammit,” Harry said.
The closet flung open. Draco could see a bright light roaming around. Draco held his breath and tried to be as still as possible. She was going to see them. How could she not?
“I never really thought you would be interested. Even if we were… friends,” Draco said.
Harry shifted, sliding his body next to Draco’s, Draco wrapping an arm around him. Kissing Harry is intoxicating, addictive. They both taste like pizza but Draco could give a fuck about that. He only wants this beautiful man close to him, his lips giving him life.
Pansy sighed and hopped off the bed, racing downstairs to greet Darlene.
“I don’t want to leave them, Daph. They took me in. They took me in after I’d just killed a guy. I can’t leave them.
“One moment,” Draco says but Harry responds, “Can I come in?”
“Never? Not even a kiss?” Draco says, Harry’s eyes being drawn to Draco’s pale, pink lips.
“How was your day?” Draco asks as he pulls out of the apartment parking lot, classical music of all things blasting on the stereo.
“What are you doing? Are you going to kill her?” Draco asked.
They order and Draco glances at Harry who is checking his phone.
“It’s OK. You gave me a second life. It was all I could ever ask for. I’ll be around,” Daphne said, kissing Pansy’s cheek before leaving the bedroom.
Harry grabs his phone. It’s Friday evening and Draco has been out shopping for the hike on Sunday.
“You little bitch. That hurt,” Bellatrix said, quickly popping to her feet.
“We’re no nearer to a solution,” Harry sighed.
Harry’s beautiful, kind face is smiling back at Draco.
“Hello, nephew. I didn’t expect you to be here,” Bellatrix said, sauntering over in their direction.
“What happened?” Harry asks.
Draco bites his lip, making a low growl as he stands, pulling Harry to his body, big dick pressing into his stomach. Draco leans into Harry’s neck and bites.
“I’m exhausted and jet-lagged,” Draco confessed.
“Well. I do get out of the house. Roam around Capitol Hill, Downtown, Fremont. All around there. I go to Gasworks to read sometimes. On Sundays, I sometimes attend St. Mark’s Cathedral. It’s beautiful and peaceful.”
. The God Supreme. The Dark One. The Master of Nightmares. The President.
Not really a request, though Harry isn’t obligated to obey. Harry smiles and shrugs as if to say, Sure, whatever.
“I don’t know. I want what everyone wants. To be fulfilled. To feel like I’m doing what I’m meant to be doing. I don’t know what that is,” Draco says, anxiety rising up from his belly.
“Hmm. Well, get ready to have your ass owned,” she says with a wink.
“Yes, he does. I’m not religious if you were wondering.”
“What? I’m being honest. Don’t worry, it’s weirdly attractive,” Harry says then leans down to kiss him.
Their pancakes arrive, they eat, and hit the road again. Olympia flies past and they are well on their way to Oregon. It’s a peaceful drive. They roll down the windows and Draco puts on Debussy, a beautiful composer for a beautiful day.
Draco got under the covers to hide his still very present erection. The fucker always lingers. Harry has a little bit of a bulge but doesn’t even seem to care. Draco envies Harry. He can’t be so brazen in that aspect.
“Exactly. That’s what happens to me too,” Harry said.
“Do I need to like bury myself with her?” Pansy asked.
Draco sighed, shoveling all the papers back into his bag. He picked up his drink and went up to the counter to speak to a barista.
Harry fake coughed before walking into the kitchen. Draco, who was standing shirtless at the stove, cooking what smelled like chili in a saucepan, still jumped a little but at least he didn’t shout like the last time.
“That’s… great? Don’t eat me,” Darlene said.
Hermione: “Never have I ever slept with someone on the first date.”
Harry feels sad when Draco parks outside his apartment. It’s over again. He doesn’t want to go.
Draco smiles.
The game is fun. Hermione almost predictably wins. She’s nice about it though. He thinks she was just baiting him earlier. Thinking if challenged he would get cocky. The old Draco might’ve. The new Draco knows his worth does not hinge on his ability to win at a game he’s never even played before.
wanted a threesome if you know what I mean,” Pansy said.
“Have I been where?” Pansy asked, confused.
Draco makes an agitated sound and drinks.
Draco winks and gets in the car. They’ve already decided to get food, stopping in a nearby town for burgers, which they both devour.
Harry pulled out his phone, bringing up the contact info for Draco. He could call him or text him. They could touch base. He missed Draco. Funny to think they had once hated each other. But now, with everyone gone or missing, Draco might be the best friend he had.
He gets up, entering the bathroom then coming back out with it in his hand. Draco has meanwhile grabbed a pillow to put over his lap, to give things time to cool off. Harry asks Draco about toppings then makes the call. Forty-five minutes later pizza arrives. Draco takes his first slice with skepticism, raising it to his mouth then biting down.
“You don’t need to tell me that you never felt that way about me. I’m OK with that. I get it,” Draco said.
“Those bastards tore through this neighborhood. I think they were looking for me. I’m trying to find survivors but… everyone is dead or missing,” Harry said.
“He doesn’t exist,” Draco answered.
I’m sorry about that.
“All right,” Neville says.
“What do you want, Pansy?” Harry asked with hostility in his voice.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Draco said.
Draco looked down at his torso. Blood smeared the cuts, barely visible in the pale moonlight shining through the blinds. Harry had what appeared to be a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls in his hands.
“President’s gonna fix that though. He’s gonna fix everything. 'Bout time we had some integrity back in the White House,” the man said.
you were cool. I mean… Erm. Never mind. Forget I said that,” Draco said, his heart pounding and his palms feeling sweaty.
“God, I want to be mad when you say stuff like that but I find it so attractive. Why is that?”
“The things he says… they are terrifying. And the worst thing is that his actual goals are so much worse. He’s a monster,” Astoria said.
Draco flashes back to being eight years old. His father yelling at him about duty and loyalty and being a man. Draco’s indiscretion? Knocking over a wineglass onto some of his father’s work papers. Christ, he can remember it so clearly like it happened only yesterday. He shivers and pushes it out of his mind.
Draco laughs and says, “Me either. You don’t have to if you don’t want to.”
Harry’s eyes go wide as he brushes back his black, messy hair.
“Sure am,” Ginny says.
“You called it off? Interesting.”
Draco felt sadness wash over him. So, there was no possibility now. Dammit, how did he let himself get so worked up.
“You know me. No one knows me,” Harry said.
“Oh uh… No?” Pansy said, sounding regretful.
“Guns? Fucking vampires with
“Fair enough. I guess it makes sense to stay here a few nights-“ Draco started but Harry shook his head.
Draco typically avoids drinking, given his father, but he doesn’t want to be a party pooper.
“Ah. Cool. Having fun tonight?”
Draco turns to face Harry, his grey eyes shining in the low light.
Draco moves it to Harry’s shaft, sliding it the toy up and down Harry’s length, getting close to the head but not quite touching.
“That’s a bullshit answer. Picture yourself in ten years. Where are you? What are you doing?”
“Harry?” Ron says as Harry leaves his room to get some juice.
“Well played,” Hermione says, clapping.
“Anyone. Can someone help me?” the woman’s voice continued.
“Yeah. I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco says, sitting down on a bench, leaning forward, head in hands.
Gunshots echoed in the distance as Draco ran through another yard and desperately climbed over another fence. He was almost certain he had cut himself climbing those hedges before. He hit the ground hard, nearly knocking his breath out. Everything was a nightmarish blur and he only wanted to find shelter and hide long enough to formulate some semblance of a plan. He pulled himself up and dashed for the back porch of the house in front of him.
“Yeah, I didn’t mean to get carried away.”
“Well. That was… really something,” Harry says.
“Sorry. I like tall guys. Even if they are dating my ex-boyfriend,” Ginny says and moves past them.
Harry sighed and nodded.
Daphne looked disappointed but nodded.
“Then all of them you shall have.”
“For?”
It’s true. It’s well proportioned. Hard as steel. Looks very plump and healthy. Harry can’t wait to get his lips on it.
“That sounds great but I still kinda want to… just… sink my teeth into you. Yeah, that sounds good,” Pansy said.
“We can go a little further than head back. I’ve been impressed with you. It’s not bad for a first hike.”
“That’s funny. You grew up with hippies. I grew up with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.”
Excellent. Say, I had an idea, if you’re up for it. Don’t you think it’s time we exchanged phone numbers? I’d like to send you some photos. The sexy kind. If you’re interested.
It felt like Draco had slipped into heaven. Harry’s kiss was smooth and confident. He placed a hand on Draco’s cheek and Draco stifled a sob. Hold it together, Malfoy, Draco told himself. Don’t let yourself be weak. Draco’s pants felt tight and he was shaking, wanting desperately to lose himself in Harry’s touch. Harry pulled away. He was smiling so warmly at Draco and Draco couldn’t stop his eyes from watering.
“I don’t know if I can. I think you’re dying,” Pansy said apologetically.
“So, instead we just wait for her to wake up tomorrow night?” Pansy asked as Angelina set Daphne down on a mattress that had been laid in the living room.
Harry smiles.
Neville and Ginny drinks. As soon as Ginny is finished she says, “Really, Neville?”
“You can’t tell me you’ve never had pizza.”
“No, we’re not! We have nothing to do with them,” the vampire insisted.
“What the hell?” the woman said.
“I think the shower is out of commission,” Harry said.
“Who’s there?” a familiar voice said, as the footsteps moved toward the kitchen.
“I am
“We did not. Please go,” Darlene said, shooing her.
“You’re evil. Death Troopers,” Pansy grinned.
“Yeah. Everything was. Even had Wi-Fi already. I’ve got a TV upstairs,” Harry said proudly.
“I wouldn’t test me,” Harry said.
“Kinda.”
The two of them sat on the sofa, inches apart, watching some nature documentary about wildlife. Harry could feel himself growing tired, his head leaning towards Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s head touched the side of Harry’s head, guiding it all the way to his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Harry says.
“I guess I should get you home,” Draco says, his chest still heaving as he turns the ignition.
“I’m up for whatever.”
“I’m fine,” he lied, fearing the cuts were worse than he thought.
“Draco, my standard for what’s stupid or unbelievable is pretty high these days. You and I both know that the supernatural is real. No need to mince words.”
Draco looks up into Harry’s green eyes, so full of warmth.
No, I bet you can’t.
“Draco, I saw two kids I went to school with, murder each other an hour ago in the middle of the road, so you’ll forgive me for finding it easy to accept that Pansy Parkinson who was never exactly the nicest person in the world is working for
“Draco’s none of your concern. The master is raising us to fight for him,” a woman said.
“Your voice!” Harry hissed.
Traveling up to Lake City didn’t take long. Draco had considered getting a car but public transportation seemed rampant and he was worried at some point red flags would pop up. What if he was forced to prove he existed? He feared what would happen.
“Draco Malfoy willingly goes to church?”
“All right.”
“Shit,” Draco says and drinks along with Ron.
“Literally always,” Katie said.
“Potter,” Draco said, not being able to stop himself from smiling.
“A vibrator?” Harry says without looking.
Draco stands in front of the mirror, straightening his collar. A full day with Harry, he can hardly believe it. That’s a long time to keep his cool. Of course, Harry doesn’t understand. He doesn’t know what Draco knows.
I’ve decided I want to pick you up Friday. Give me your address.
“Good something,” Harry says, shaking his head, mostly at himself.
“All right,” Draco says quietly.
“Draco, will you step outside with me?” Harry says.
Pansy was there, only her face visible by moonlight for the rest of her body was covered in black death trooper gear.
Neville: “Never have I ever faked an orgasm.”
Pansy was really hungry. She licked her lips, her eyes fixed on Darlene.
“Is there another bathroom?” Draco asked.
“I will not. Hey, does anyone have some clothes. I’m cold,” Pansy said, rubbing her arms.
“Do you want go help him?” Astoria asked, her brown eyes looking directly into his eyes.
“I can’t believe you’re going to eat diner food,” Harry says as they sit down in their assigned booth.
Draco and Harry smile at each other.
Her dog barked at Harry and she patted the dog’s head.
“She’s leaving,” Pansy said, sitting on the couch at Alicia’s feet.
“Guess it’s good you’re with me,” Harry said, pushing off the tree and walking over to Draco.
“Guess I should go to bed,” Harry said.
“Are you sure? Katie and Angelina seemed annoyed with me a lot,” Pansy said.
Neville wanders over, still not acknowledging Draco, though he doesn’t seem uncomfortable either.
“Oh, I won’t. I’ll leave you something nice to wake up to. Oh, and by the way. What you were asking in the bathroom? When Ron interrupted us? The answer is yes, it is. And remember: I don’t lie about that,” Draco says and winks, turning on the engine to his car.
Harry’s mouth rapidly slid up and down the head of Draco’s cock while his hand swiftly stroked the base.
Harry’s never exactly had a thing for big dicks but his body is fucking responding. It’s not just the dick. It’s the confidence. The way Draco is looking at the camera. Looking at him. Harry doesn’t know if he can take it but he knows that he needs to know. He needs the number for the big dick training course, stat.
Harry chuckles and says, “Of course you don’t.”
“I don’t know. Dammit.”
“The hell you did. Good God, Darlene. You really don’t respect me one damn bit,” Charlie said, marching over to Darlene.
Draco grunts and takes another bite. Harry laughs.
“Oh,” Draco said, remembering that he had never really liked Cedric, though he had to admit that Cedric was very handsome.
“What? What is it?” Draco begged.
“The thing? You’re going to have to be more descriptive,” Harry says, smirking.
“But I’m really hungry,” Pansy frowned, rubbing her stomach.
Harry pulls his mouth off and says, “You can blow it where you want to,” though Harry absolutely wants Draco to finish in his mouth.
“Who decides who does or doesn’t deserve something? Besides, I seem to recall beating your ass over most of that.”
“We need supplies. We need to find food and water. You could use a backpack. We need a radio. My cell phone is almost out of juice and it’s not getting a single anymore. Phone lines are cut. No internet. Power is out everywhere. We need some way of finding out what’s happening. Finding a radio signal might be our only hope,” Harry said.
“We’ve known each other since we were kids, Draco,” Harry says, kissing him on the forehead.
“Sports. My mother would’ve sent me to a private Christian school but my father wasn’t having it. He also thought public school would toughen me up. I was such a sensitive boy. Or so he told me,” Draco says, more bad memories lurking beneath the surface.
“I’ve done some stuff. Enough to know what I like.”
“Yeah. I knew she might at some point but I kept hoping it would be longer,” Pansy said.
It’s a move that to Draco feels less
Another into the hike and they stop to refuel, resting near the river as they eat energy bars.
Draco presses down on the clutch, gripping the stick shift as he put it in reverse, guiding them out then onto the road. As promised there was no destination. He was letting intuition guide him south away from Seattle. He never thought more deeply than that. He imagines himself driving all the way down I-5 the coast, right down to Mexico. He could make it in a day if he didn’t need to eat or sleep.
“He’s a criminal. No one will miss him,” the man said.
Draco’s almost a little sad when he gets the car back. The adventure is almost over. Still, four hours of driving left to do. In some ways, Draco feels changed by this experience. It’s harder to put up the facade. He’s anxious but excited. His life is taking a turn and he knows it is for the better.
Harry allows himself a glance down, seeing what appeared to be a substantial bulge in Draco’s pants as expected, though he can’t make out much in the dark. He’s just glad he’s not the only one.
“All right. Well… I’m glad I didn’t eat you,” Pansy shrugged and headed out the front door.
“It’s OK. Sleep well,” Draco said and Harry did.
“If we’ve lost him he’ll be dead anyway. You know what’s out there,” a higher voice said.
“Not exactly.”
Ginny gives a grinning glance but doesn’t say anything. Draco is reassured by how much Harry’s ex-girlfriends approve, though he supposes the more lukewarm response from his best friends balances things out.
“Ok. Umm…”
Everyone in the room but Neville and Draco drink. Ginny is looking very distressed at her now more than half-empty glass.
At the front desk, they discover that there are two rooms available. One with a bed for two adults and another for a child and another with just a bed for two adults.
“It’s beautiful regardless of its size,” Harry says, sliding his hand up and down the considerable length.
“Hey.”
Harry remembers the bathroom from the night before and seeing what looked like a large pipe in Draco’s tight jeans. Just how big is it? Surely, that must’ve been an illusion. Harry’s watched a lot of porn and seen a lot of big dicks if it’s as big as it looks he’s going to need to take a big dick training course or something.
“They aren’t wearing any gear or caring guns. Let’s get them,” Angelina said and they flew out from behind the bushes, swords raised.
“Admirable,” Draco says, understanding the desire for purpose all too well.
“Daphne,” she uttered, barely more than a whisper.
There wasn’t much left of the Weasley’s old three-story home, just a hollowed out frame. Harry’s green eyes roamed over the ashes with grief on his face.
“Goodie! So I guess I’ll let you boys get back to cuddling or whatever you were doing. How come you didn’t tell me you liked boys, Draco? I told Blaise you were straight. He
“I don’t know what the fuck that is or where it came from… but I like it,” Harry says.
Half the room groans as Hermione, Cho, and Harry all drink.
“Yeah. That. Which really ties into our entire sexual relationship which was… never good.”
“I was out in the woods out there when it disappeared. Maybe I’m from there too. I wonder if I knew you,” Pansy said.
“Did the troopers find him? They didn’t say anything,” Draco said.
“Yeah!” Pansy said.
Pansy started walking in the opposite direction with a sigh. She needed to find a nice empty house with a basement so she could stay out of the sun tomorrow. Tomorrow night she would search for them.
Pansy swiftly grabbed his arm, popping it with a hard snap, Charlie screaming as his broken arm hung limply. Darlene was screaming about something but Pansy didn’t care, climbing onto Charlie’s back to sink her teeth into his throat.
Harry pulls away, smiling as he says, “Pizza.”
“Yeah. Get the fuck back!” Pansy shouted, pulling out a pistol.
The joint passes around until it’s back with Draco. He inhales again, relaxing and trying not to cough. He passes it to Harry as he exhales.
“It is. But that’s how most vampires do it. Luckily those bonds can be broken,” Angelina said, kicking the door open as they rushed Daphne inside.
Draco couldn’t help but take in the shirtless figure that he had shared a bed with. Harry was every bit as gorgeous as he had been before Draco had moved away. He wasn’t as ripped as he was in high school anymore but he was still pretty fit. Harry rubbed dark fingers through his black hair, glaring at Draco with interest.
“Does it have a scan function? You could just keep telling it to scan until it finds something,” Draco said.
Are you out to your parents?
“You’re welcome,” Daphne said, winking, pulling her fingers out and rolling over beside Pansy.
Draco never complains. Harry can see that he’s tired but he never utters an displeased word. He has stamina. Nice. Still, they both smile upon reaching Draco’s car.
Sure is. Why the hell did you like me?
“Once again, more for me,” Harry says, putting two hands on it, amazed at how much room is left.
“If you’ll let me go I’ll show you how much I love it,” Harry says.
Harry can’t send his phone number fast enough, trembling and nearly dropping his phone with excitement. He finds it a struggle to even focus on work for the rest of the day. It’s not until that evening when he finally gets texts from Draco, his phone rapidly buzzing on his nightstand.
“Not my scene.”
“That must be frustrating. But you should get some more hobbies. Try some things out.”
“Something like that.”
“Hello! Is anyone there? Can someone help?” she called out.
“Good. I’m glad.”
“Now. Where were we?” Bellatrix said, her eyes turning towards Harry.
“Be funny if it broke down again now,” Draco says.
Pansy grinned at Alicia.
. No, he doesn’t want to go out with Draco Malfoy. The idea is ridiculous. He gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom. When he gets back he has a message waiting from Draco.
Draco thinks then says, “If I’ve forgotten how can I know I did it?”
The following night they were attacking a nest of suspected Death Troopers. Pansy was pretty excited to get some action. They’d been chasing after a werewolf for weeks and that hadn’t been much fun.
Harry reaches over, touching the back of his beck, fingertips moving through his hair. Draco gets chills on his arms. He leans into a kiss, no one around to even pay attention anymore.
“You don’t seem any less tired than me,” Draco said, scooting himself over on the bed and laying his head on a pillow.
Harry has been lovestruck before but he doesn’t think it’s ever been this bad before. Their chemistry is insane. Off the fucking charts. And the more Harry gets to know Draco the hotter he seems to become. He’s started to seriously wonder what Draco is like in bed. Harry knows from experience with women that he’s definitely more of a giver. He just likes to make the other person happy. He’d definitely love to make Draco happy.
“Harry, a fire like that… you would need forensics to find any evidence,” Draco said honestly, not wishing to hurt Harry.
It’s Draco’s turn. He thinks for a moment then says, “Never have I ever stolen something from someone else’s home.”
“I’m off Wednesday. We should spend a day together. We can take that drive if you want.”
“Why?” the woman asked.
“Pizza? We can’t have pizza,” Draco says shaking his head.
“Woo. That was good,” Pansy said, smiling down at Daphne whose face was still between her legs and fingers were still inside of her.
“I like to squeeze in some pancakes between the heaping piles of caviar.”
He didn’t think there was a sliver of a chance that he’d be able to sleep while the sun was still up but he wasn’t sure what else there was to do. Draco suspected the Death Troopers had moved on. They had more undesirables to root out. Godric’s Hollow wasn’t the only place where people knew about the supernatural and
“Charlie for Christ’s sake do as she says!” Darlene screamed at him.
“I feel like I shouldn’t but I do. I’ve gotten to know you and I guess I know that there’s more to you than just being a dick.”
Draco feels odd on the drive home. It’s a funny feeling that radiates from somewhere between his stomach and his heart, filling him with warmth and wellbeing. Such a strange thing.
“No, thank you. I would just look like my father when he’s been drinking. When I was younger he would get stressed about work and start drinking. Just an entire week of the old man being irritable and drunk. And of course, he didn’t shave when he was drunk. Only a fool shaves drunk.”
Pop after pop and Harry holds on. Draco says, “All right. Let’s upgrade to something a little stronger.”
“Do you think you can get it in your mouth?” Draco asks, cautiously.
“Yeah, OK. I’m in. I want more of that. But clothes first,” Pansy grinned.
Draco holds their dicks together and Harry again feels like he might come. Every touch seems to do it now.
“Good night, Harry,” Draco says.
“How about a compromise? In the morning, I’ll make you breakfast. Then I’ll read to you for a while. In the evening I will take you out to dinner and then I’ll take you home in time to get enough sleep for work the next day. How does that sound?” Draco asks.
Astoria was crouching in her dining room, trying to peer out the window, hoping to see without being seen as she lifted up the curtain. She looked out. The men were still out there. They had been there since the sunset.
“I’m not bothering you, am I?”
“You shouldn’t watch that stuff,” Draco said.
“Absolutely nothing. I just want to lay here with you.”
Harry is finding it hard to think. Once clarity returns he says, “I guess I can delete Tinder now.”
“Pansy is bad in bed? Or you are?”
“Hey!” Draco says, lifting his head to stare at Harry agape.
“I’m kidding! But since you don’t have a favorite band, who’s your favorite composer?”
There are trees as far as the eye can see. It starts to rain so the windows go back up. Harry dozes off for a while. Draco wonders if he’s getting enough sleep at night. He has to remember to ask him about that later.
Draco sighed. Despite everything he still loved Harry Potter. He loved Astoria too. The two things were not incompatible.
“Ah. Well, guess I’ll go. It was nice seeing you. How long you in town?” she asked.
Draco felt immense satisfaction in that moment. He had often imagined what it would be like to make Harry Potter come more times and ways than he could even fathom, though he had always imagined it happening under far better circumstances.
discovered I was going to break the curse he sent her after me not realizing that…”
The voice stirred Draco out of his sleep. Harry was already leaning up and turning the volume up on the radio. He couldn’t be certain what time it was but it was still very dark out.
In truth, Draco didn’t think they’d hear anything interesting on the radio. As far as his sources knew the Death Troopers were only hitting select targets. For a full-scale assault they would need bigger forces. The thought made Draco shudder.
“All right. I’ll call the tow.”
“Holy shit,” he whispers, unsure what he expected to wake up to this morning.
Draco groans.
“Oh. Don’t,” Pansy frowned.
“It’s a long story and not what it sounds like,” Neville says as Hermione slams her empty glass down, throwing her hands up in defeat.
“I’m afraid they don’t. Astoria, the things I’m hearing. This is the end game. I think something big is going to happen in Godric’s Hollow. I don’t even know if I can stop it if I do go there,” Draco said.
“Thank you,” Pansy said stepping forward.
Harry has a hand on Draco’s back. It slides down to his ass and squeezes, Draco’s dick jumping in response, already painfully hard in his pants. The comforter and sheets are bunched up between their bodies, creating an accidental barrier. Draco needs every part of him to touch every part of Harry. He needs-
“Daphne. The other vamps were feeding on her,” Pansy said.
For a moment they get lost, mouths moving together while their hands roam. Draco pulls away and says, “I want you to get on your knees in front of me. Pull it out.”
“Trust me. They just… care a lot about the mission. They are both hurting,” Alicia said.
“No. This is our town. No one else gets to keep it. Besides… something is trapped in the cemetery,” Harry said.
He’d been walking along the highway for half an hour. Maybe longer. Didn’t know where he was. Or who he was. Or where he was going. Woke up in a ditch with a backpack. There was stuff in there. Lots of papers. A book by someone named Lupin. He had a wallet with some money. His Driver’s License said his name was Harry James Potter. He was 6’1”. Green eyes. Born in 1997. Wasn’t sure what year it was now.
“My parents would’ve killed me. All right, you can ask a question.”
“Pretty sure,” Draco says.
“You just sucked every ounce of come out of my body through my dick like it was a straw,” Draco says as if that was answer enough.
“Suit yourself, I’m getting some fresh air,” Harry said, heading to the back porch through the kitchen.
Draco blows out air then takes Harry’s hand. Harry lifts him right up and pulls him close, kissing him then letting him to go pick up his pack.
“About time,” Draco says, turning around and drawing Harry in with a come hither gesture.
The bus station really wasn’t far, though he still had to ask for directions once he was outside. This wall too confusing. But he had a bunch of Seattle addresses written down. He must know some people there.
“Well, she got better. It wouldn’t be the first time I saw the dead come back anyway,” Harry said.
“Uhh will a twenty be enough?” Harry asked, dangling the bill out.
“Wait. What?” a familiar voice says from somewhere behind Draco.
“Yeah. It’s all old school friends.”
“So, am I to take it that you’ve never been high?” Harry asks.
“Jesus, it sounds like you joined a cult,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
“My friends are all dead or evil. I think Blaise might be out there somewhere. Sidebar, still bitter Dean and Seamus didn’t invite me to their wedding,” Draco said.
“Yes, we do,” Harry said.
Draco snickers and says, “No. Unless you’re into that.”
“Will do.”
“Well… if I am gonna die… I’ll be honored to do it by your side,” Draco said, touching Harry’s shoulder.
“It was a trick question. I love them both. But if I had to pick I would go with dogs so you win double big.”
Draco sits back up and says, “So, obviously it’s safe to say you haven’t had a boyfriend before. Given how recently you came out.”
“Hmm.”
“I am joking. About the caviar. I don’t like caviar. I do like pancakes.”
She laughs and backs away.
“Draco. I don’t know if you noticed or not… but you have… a really nice looking dick,” Harry says, reaching a hand around it. His fingers touch, but barely and his fingers are long.
“We can sit and talk… a couple of feet apart. And try not to touch when we sleep.”
“Oh. How about… Oregon. In honor of our road trip.”
“Yes, daddy.”
“I’m not proud!”
Draco finds it difficult to sleep that night. For a while. Once he can suppress his horniness he actually sleeps like a baby, waking up in the morning ready to tackle the car problem.
Harry takes it from him, Draco still coughing.
Harry smiles, “That’s fine by me.”
“My question first, Draco,” Harry insisted.
“Me either. But actually… Well… I can’t say that I know you. It’s more like… I knew. I knew you,” Draco said with a smile.
“I’ve been to Paris and I’ve been to Rome. I like Rome more.”
. Dammit, his sources had been right. Perhaps whoever was hiding out in this house would be friendly at least.
The next one is the same suit but now he looks almost angry. Intense. He’s holding a flogger or a whip of some sort. Those eyes alone get Harry hard. He thinks if Draco looks at him like that then he might agree to anything.
“All the time. But I learn to tune it out. It comes from the basement. I don’t like going down there. It feels weird,” Harry said.
“Oh, I’m pretty. Shit, my hair is effed up. And my makeup is smeared,” Pansy frowned at herself.
Draco turns back to Harry, kissing his hand.
Suddenly there was a flash, the light rebounding, knocking Harry, Draco and Pansy back.
“Yeah. I need to see whatever’s left,” Harry said.
Harry rolled over but said, “You can hold me if you like.”
“Why did you do this?” the vampire said, her blue eyes looking sadly up at Pansy.
“Me too,” Draco said, then tried to pull himself up before groaning in pain and falling to the floor again.
“Lower your voice,” Harry said as he entered the room.
So, what’s going on with your life these days?
Draco felt his heart pound. He had an urge to lean over and kiss Harry. His full lips looked so soft. But he couldn’t do that. He shouldn’t. Not because of Astoria. She understood. But because he wasn’t ready for the rejection. Not yet.
“I have a Bachelor’s in business. My whole life all my mother and father have wanted for me was to eventually take over the family business. I don’t want that.”
“Why would they care? They were looking for the living, not the dead,” Harry said.
“What’s your favorite band?”
“Hmm. Maybe. I’ll think about it.”
“Much better,” Ginny says.
“Never have I ever had a crush on a teacher,” Ron says.
“Sorry, I called you a giraffe.”
“You’re the right amount of pretty and ruggedly handsome. You just need a little bit of stubble,” Harry says, reaching over to rub Draco’s chin. Draco laughs and swats his hand away.
He ordered eggs, bacon and pancakes while he sorted through his backpack. He had a cellphone and a charger in there. He would have to find a plug somewhere. After he ate. He had keys too, unsure what any of them went to. He looked his Driver’s License again. The address did say he lived in Seattle.
Ginny sheepishly is the only one to take a drink. Harry looks panicked and she laughs.
“Never have I ever… broken up with someone over text,” Draco says.
“All right. Let’s turn back.”
Draco relaxes and puts his head back on Harry’s chest.
Ginny glances at Harry then looks at Draco.
“Actually, in Anne Rice’s books Lestat had superpowers and stuff. It was pretty ridiculous,” Angelina said.
“Who is that?” Angelina asked.
Draco didn’t let himself finish that sentence and he felt himself turning red. Dammit, Draco, be cool, he told himself.
“It’s fine. You were nice enough not do the full bond. Then I wouldn’t be able to say no. But I can say no. I choose to say yes and I’ve never been disappointed. Well… maybe the first time but after that… it’s all been good,” Daphne said, her finger circling the softness of Pansy’s stomach, making her laugh.
Draco inhales and tries again: “Everything I did was all to protect myself. If I was the toughest, most scary kid other kids couldn’t fuck with me. And my father would be proud. Proud that I wasn’t a pussy or whatever else he said.”
“Yeah. And unfortunately, you’re gonna need us to stay here to protect you. We’re gonna keep watch. There’s probably not any more vamps but we can’t be certain. Just watch her. She’s your responsibility now,” Angelina said and the girls walked outside.
“I’ve fuckin’ missed you,” she says, squeezing Harry hard enough that he grunts, quite the sight considering their considerable size difference.
Draco only felt his arousal becoming more unbearable and it took all his strength to prevent him from sliding closer to Harry and to stop himself from touching himself. Christ, this was so unfair.
Neville: “Never have I ever had a one night stand.”
“You sound uncertain. Do you want to commit a little more?”
“Never have I ever not called someone who gave me their number,” Harry says.
Draco flies out of the car, thinking to look under the hood but he doesn’t know a damn thing about cars. Harry is also out of the car, pulling out his phone.
Finally, a profile that catches Harry’s eye. For several reasons. He’s well dressed. Preppy. Blond. Tall and slender as he sits backward in a wooden chair. He’s not looking at the camera. He’s positioned in front of a window at an angle so that the light causes lens flare. The face and cheekbones are unmistakable and the name on the profile confirms it. Draco. Draco Malfoy, a man Harry hasn’t seen in years and for good reason. They hate each other.
There was also a name repeated: Harry. Harry Potter.
Draco smiles as they enter Tacoma, thinking this is already going well.
“I’m Pansy. Cool. Pansy,” she said, setting the vest down.
“I just need to go to a town. Or a city,” Harry asked then pulled out his wallet and added, “I can pay.”
“Now, hold still,” Harry said, just like Draco’s mother would’ve said.
Draco wanted to comfort Harry but he was afraid anything he did would just be weird.
!” Bellatrix screamed.
“Darlene. That’s cool. You look like a Darlene. Hey, listen, why is your heartbeat so loud?” Pansy asked.
“Ah. Shit!” Draco screeched as the cuts burned.
Harry stares at his phone, his dick instantly hard.
“Let’s not ask each other who we consider our best friends, ok?” Hermione says, borderline depressed before saying, “Never have I ever asked someone to spank me.”
“I trust you too,” Draco said.
“One of my best friends is a werewolf,” Harry said with a shrug.
“Why?” Harry said, raising an eyebrow suspiciously.
No one drinks. He shrugs and says, “Just checking.”
“So, how have things been? What does Draco Malfoy even do on a day to day basis?”
Harry stuck his hand out, projecting golden light at Bellatrix.
Pansy didn’t mind being a vampire but having a vampire master hadn’t worked out so well for her. He could tell her what to do… Pansy hurt people. Not any people she had liked and they had all been really tasty but it wasn’t good for her social life. Yeah. She could forgive Draco. He might be the only friend she had left. She knew he would never love her again but that was OK.
“Maybe. But you know it sounds good.”
“I’m Darlene,” she said.
“Come,” Harry said, grabbing Draco by the hand and quickly dragging him into the nearby closet.
“Do you have anything to create a fire?” Katie asked.
“Sorry. I just feel so much… wasted time. Time spent doing anything except what I wanted to be doing.”
“That’s kind of cool.”
Later that night they chat some more.
Something very weird was going on. She couldn’t remember something. No… she couldn’t remember anything.
Draco comes over, immediately catching the eyes of the other woman with Ginny, still standing outside. Hermione Granger. A chubby Black girl who has a lot more piercings than when he last saw her. He doesn’t recall her being goth either. He supposes people change.
Draco sits up and turns to look at Harry.
“I want to find out too,” Draco says.
There’s a knock at the door.
Harry stops and turns to look.
Harry doesn’t know what the fuck that was about but his body certainly likes it. Draco pulls away and says, “Before I let you go… would you let me bite your neck?”
Draco felt Harry’s body jerk and his cock spasmed in Draco’s hand, spilling warm fluid all over his hand and Harry’s belly.
Hermione drinks without comment. Her glass is nearly empty.
“All right. You go first.”
Draco softly chuckles and opens the door. Harry comes in, locking the door behind him and tackling Draco against the bathroom sink, mouth hungrily on Draco’s mouth.
“So, you already had this planned,” Pansy said as Daphne turned around, reapplying her lip gloss.
“You’re on. I’m gonna hold you to it.”
“So, I guess you’re over it now,” Harry said, sounding a little disappointed.
“Well, it would be worth it for that alone.”
“Aren’t vaginas… flexible?” Harry says.
“Uh… good night,” Harry says and smiles, still stunned as he backs up, Draco rolling up the window.
“Then you joined… the Death Troopers as soon as you came back,” Harry said.
“Good,” Draco says.
“What?” Pansy said, blinking.
“Not everyone has forgiven you for being such an asshole and helping to raise the Dark Lord in the first place,” Harry said, tilting his head and smiling.
“You’re really something, Draco. Part of me wants to punch you. Another part of me…”
“Hey,” Ron says and lets Draco in.
“Some do,” Harry says.
Bellatrix laughed, swiping her hand and a silver blast knocked Pansy back, rolling somewhere down the hill.
Traffic is nightmarish. Draco is a good driver, working the stick shift like a pro. He goes a little fast but he’s never unsafe. They don’t speak, not that either of them could hear each other over Tchaikovsky. Harry’s never been so excited and nervous in his life. He wonders if he should’ve insisted on going back to his apartment in case he needed to pack. No, they weren’t leaving Seattle. At least Harry didn’t think.
“He’s going to win reelection next year.”
“What is wrong with me?” Draco growled.
“Yeah, but what kinda criminal. See, there’s a big difference between some stoner gettin’ busted for possession and like a child killer,” Pansy plead.
“It was her. I saw her and… I think she saw us,” Harry said.
Draco means, crawling over to Draco’s head. Draco sits up and takes Harry’s dick into his mouth, gagging himself on it.
“Hey! Watch it!” Pansy said, taking a step back.
Draco drove slowly through the Hollow. The sun had just set. Astoria wasn’t responding to his texts. That worried him. As he pulled up to his parent’s home, long since abandoned, he saw figures roaming around it. As he watched the insides of the house suddenly started to glow bright with orange. It was on fire.
After stopping to look at the map they carry on the trail. This isn’t the most scenic trail in Washington but it should work well enough. If nothing else it’s peaceful. Harry always loves getting away from the city. Away from the traffic and people in a hurry to go nowhere. With nature, he’s at home. It’s more spiritual than any church he’s ever been in.
Harry made a pleased sound as Draco whined with the intensity of his orgasm. It had been a while since he came so hard that his balls hurt after. Harry continued to suck as Draco’s cock grew soft. Draco felt peace fill his mind and body. Harry finally released his cock then got up out of bed. Draco was tired and struggled to remain awake while Harry went to clean himself up.
“Whoa! Guys. Oh, man. She wasn’t joking about that blood thing. Holy shit! I feel so high,” Pansy said, her eyes wide and staring at the starry sky.
“So, we’re doing this,” Draco said, a statement not a question.
“Oregon? Huh. Sure. Oregon it is. Just call out Oregon if things get to be too much.”
“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry says and starts to get out of the car.
Pansy lingered in her room for a minute before heading back out. Outside, Alicia was reading on the couch.
“We’ll have to stay the night somewhere. Maps says there’s an inn nearby. Let’s go there,” Draco says.
“Then what do you want?” Harry asks.
“Yeah, it is,” another voice in the room said, scaring them both.
“No, you won’t. He’s family,” Harry said, his hand glowing gold again as he stepped forward.
“We wouldn’t have failed,” Harry said.
“I’m all right. Kinda weird you and Harry dating,” Ron says, cutting right to the chase.
“So, you dated Pansy Parkinson for how long?” Harry asks a half-hour later, now drifting away from the river.
“Excuse me. I need to go to Seattle. How can I get there?” Draco asked her.
“Oh, Harry, you’re going to regret that.”
“You think I’ll just do anything you say?” Harry says, crossing his arms and smirking.
His green eyes were sort of mesmerizing. What gave the man such a right to be so beautiful?
What to do? What to say? He needs someone he can talk about it with. Who the hell can he safely, casually just say
Draco laughed.
Harry thinks he should just walk away but he’s just too curious.
An hour later, Draco decides he’s sober enough. He’ll drive slower than usual just in case. The roads should be fine at 2 am. Harry walks with him to his car.
“And then the bisexuality.”
“Hey, Penelope. How’s it going?” Harry said, surprised that she started to walk up to him.
“Hey, boys. Want me to rush to the cemetery and back?” Pansy asked.
Harry’s glad he went ahead and told Ron and Neville about him and Draco so that he doesn’t have to worry about them seeing this. He knows they probably don’t approve but he thinks if they can get to know him now they’ll change their mind.
“What do you we do? They’ll
Harry wets his lips and wraps them around the head of Draco’s dick, slowly sucking and getting a taste of his salty pre-come.
“Yeah. So. He sucked,” Pansy said with a shrug then added, “And I’m not a death trooper. I don’t even know what one is.”
Draco gets back in the car and Harry follows, grinning as he puts his pack in the backseat. Music is on the stereo and for once it’s not classical.
“Give it time,” Ginny says.
When Draco stops, tears are streaming down Harry’s face. A little from pain, a lot from pleasure. His dick remains rock hard, a fact Draco learns when he reaches under Harry to grab it. He strokes Harry and says, “You were so good for me but I’m not done with you. I want to tease you like I promised.”
Harry groaned then went silent. Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He would trust Harry’s judgment.
Harry bites his lip then gets down on the carpeted floor. Draco’s bulge would be visible from the moon, Harry is pretty sure. He can see it at an angle, stretching the black fabric of his slacks all around it. Draco spread his legs and Harry’s hands rub up Draco’s thighs. He’s nervous. This is the point of no return. Not that he minds.
“It’s ok to be proud of it. You don’t have to feel ashamed.”
“Because for us it’s literally true. There’s no place like home for us. Home no longer exists,” Draco said.
“You know the funny thing about dying the first time? Nothin’ happened. No heaven or hell. That bastard drank the life outta me and nothing happened. I just woke up and suddenly I was a new person. But the second time… it wasn’t so pleasant. It was… terrible. Dark. Hot. Painful. I don’t know if it was hell but it sure wasn’t nice. And it felt… so long. Longer than I had ever been alive. And then one day… I was back. I was in some place back out east, lying butt-ass naked in front of a bunch of weirdos,” Pansy said.
Whatever cologne Draco is wearing smells amazing. Harry can only think of it as a dark and sweet musk. It suits Draco. He’s dressed just as well as in his photos. Nothing on him feels anything less than perfectly constructed. He doesn’t even have a single hair out of place. The dick.
“We don’t. Their apartment isn’t really haunted. We’re just gonna act real tough. Make a scene. Then we get to eat,” Angelina said, gesturing at Pansy and Alicia with two fingers to follow.
“Shit, Harry. You weren’t joking about that gag reflex.”
“Vampires. Yeah. That makes sense,” Harry said, stroking his chin and looking even less surprised than Draco thought.
Draco smiles, though it’s a little forced.
Alicia wrapped an arm around Pansy, squeezing her.
“Cedar. Or spruce. Or both. I’m not an arborist.”
“Someone’s out there,” Harry said.
“Nothing. I’ll tell you later,” Hermione says, setting what was left of the joint in an ashtray.
“Like I said… there’s stuff you don’t know about me,” Harry said, and Draco realized at some point he would have to tell Harry that he knows more than he thinks.
“They do what they’re meant to. That’s all that matters. I think they’re fine, though.”
“Jesus isn’t here. Just us. Care to talk?” a tall black woman with braided hair asked.
pulled the plug on my existence,” Pansy said, her pale, pretty face winking at Draco in the moonlight.
“Hey, Cho,” Draco says with a grin.
“All right. Then we’ll compare notes. I’ll have to go back to my hotel to retrieve them…” Draco said.
“Should we look for more survivors?” Draco asked as he came back inside.
?” Draco screamed.
Harry turns to look at him. He seems sincere.
“Draco, do you have anywhere to be?” Harry asked.
“There you are,” Harry says, coming right over from the sofa.
The trail goes on. Harry hopes at some point he and Draco will be able to go camping. That could be fine. If it isn’t raining too much.
By the time Pansy had her jeans back on, Daphne was fully dressed and messing with hair in the mirror.
“Sure is.”
“Dammit,” she said, dropping back down to the floor.
“Thank you. Shall we go to the Weasley’s house? Just in case,” Draco said.
“They aren’t just for clits,” Draco says.
“Because there’s nothing we can do about it,” Draco said, sitting beside her then adding, “Not yet.”
“Vic, no judging but I feel like maybe you enjoy this too much,” a man who seemed to be his friend said, slapping him on the back.
“She asked me to. She seemed nice. I didn’t want to watch her die,” Pansy said.
“Whatever you want, daddy,” Harry says.
They almost start again but Harry quickly pulls away.
“Oh well. I’ve got a lot of ground to cover. I’ve got a guy who is going to help me get to Ohio. From there I’ll figure out my next step,” Daphne said.
“Now we just click our heels and say there’s no place like home,” Harry said.
“How’d that go?” Harry asked.
“Chatting with other guys on Tinder, I see?” Draco teases.
Draco sat down on the sofa. It was nice but looked at least a decade old.
“But it didn’t work out.”
Draco crinkles his nose and laughs.
“Hey. Come on. I’ve gotta pee!” Ron says.
“Hey,” Harry said.
“What is this, Darlene? What have I told you?” the man said.
Draco accepts and shakes.
“I guess I should’ve told you to pack some clothes just in case,” Draco says as they enter the room.
“She’s useless, Angelina. Let’s just stake her and go,” the shorter black woman said.
“Not a bad fifth date.”
Harry feels a little embarrassed every time he calls Draco daddy but knowing it turns him on his reason enough to do it. Draco soon climbs on the bed and attaches some leather cuffs to the headboard and to each of his wrists, securing him in place.
Draco looks ashamed and sighs.
A year later and he’s away from his parents, away from Pansy, and free to be who he is. Free to take the man he’s had a crush on for such a long time for a drive to nowhere. He drives from his apartment in Capitol Hill down to Columbia City in South Seattle where Harry lives with his music down low lest he overexcite himself. He needs to find out what Harry likes so he can mix it up. Growing up Draco’s parents only ever let him listen to classical music and opera, wanting him to be cultured like them. Things like pop and rock music are a confusing mystery to him.
“But that’s the thing. We were friends. I came to trust and respect you, especially after you found a way to end that curse. I saw what it did to you even if I didn’t know what you had to do. You could’ve come to me…” Harry said.
Don’t be. We should’ve broken up years ago. So, what about you? How has your dating life been? Didn’t marry Ginny Weasley, I see.
Ginny awkwardly laughs and says, “God, no. That would be so fucking twisted. I mean I definitely have a thing for tall guys but you
Ron drinks and everyone stares at him. He doesn’t respond.
“It’s a challenge. Obviously. It’s also really sexy. Just holding it turns me on. It’s so… heavy,” Harry says and slaps it against Draco’s stomach, making them both laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cycle and repeat. It’s like they all come from the same factory. Everyone looks like models on Tinder and not like regular people you’d meet on the street. Not that there’s anything wrong with that but it makes them all seem unreal. Maybe they aren’t real. Maybe they are all bots or people catfishing. Seattleites are not that hot. Harry is sure he would have noticed that.
“Hey, Draco,” Ginny says, smiling at him in a way that seems genuine.
still my ex’s boyfriend. Or the guy he’s dating. I don’t know actually.”
“Nah, it’s fine. I’ll tell work I had an emergency.”
“Right. Anyhow… I broke up with Pansy. Not because she was a vampire. But the guy who made her worked for… you know…
Draco slides out of bed and goes to the bathroom to wash his hands free of grease. He supposes Harry is right. Pizza is reliable. If his parents could see him now. Being bisexual was one thing but liking pizza? Appalling. They’d write him out of the will.
“I used to hate you.”
“I’m saying… I would’ve liked to have had the chance to be interested. Who knows what could’ve happened?” Harry said.
“I don’t know, Alicia. We should take her with us. If her memory comes back she might be useful,” Angelina said.
“No. They aren’t OK. They aren’t OK at all,” Harry admitted, the meaning behind his words obvious.
The dick strikes again.
Draco’s starting to think they should’ve gotten this out of their system before hanging out with Harry’s friends. Had this been a normal fourth date they both would’ve been sweaty and naked by now.
“Drive safe. Seriously. And don’t forget your promise about Tinder!” Harry says, standing at the driver’s side window, leaning in.
“That’s terrible. I don’t think anyone thought you were scary, though. I think they thought you were an asshole.”
“Have you had much success with Tinder?” Harry asks.
“Are they OK?” Draco asked, his heart pounding.
He considered running back outside but Draco knew for certain what was outside.
All the power was out as far as he could see. This was it. Everything was going straight to hell. Draco ran, deciding leap over a fence, thinking he could better lose his follow by going through yards and just hoping that no dogs were outside. He ran straight into some hedges and willed himself to climb over them, hopping over the fence behind them.
“At least you didn’t threaten to kill me,” Draco says.
“I get enjoying being high but this… I don’t know,” Draco says, chugging water.
I just remembered that time in second grade when I hit Neville in the face with a dodgeball deliberately and you kicked in the balls.
There’s no further reply so Harry goes to bed. There’s no message in the morning. In fact, Harry only briefly hears from Draco that night.
“I don’t want to leave. I won’t leave,” Pansy said.
“I know that! I’m just saying. Better missing than dead,” Harry said.
“Sure I can. I did it loads of times before you murdered me to save that Granger girl. Sunscreen and a hoodie. And it’s supposed to rain the next few days. Cloudy skies!” Pansy declared with joy.
Harry’s face revealed nothing, no matter how much Draco searched for even the slightest hint that he approved of Draco’s affections. Draco wanted to run and find somewhere he could hide to rebury his feelings but he knew he couldn’t do that now. There wasn’t time.
“Am I starting to break you?”
Harry is looking up at the ceiling, thinking for a long time.
“I believe you. Thank you. I think I’m gonna go lie down,” Pansy said, touching Alicia’s hand before she left.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Draco. There are things about me you don’t understand…”
Hermione smirks in Harry’s direction.
“I’d rather you exceed my expectations than always come up short.”
“Let’s vote. All in favor of taking this amnesiac baby vamp with us say aye. Aye,” Angelina said, joined by Katie.
“Huh. Well. That’s that then,” Ron says, sitting back down.
“Is that how you want to characterize that? All right,” Harry says and drinks his last drink as well.
“Yeah. Remember San Diego?” Angelina said.
“Hmm.”
“No. I have you with me. As long as I have you… I can keep the faith,” Harry smiled, finding himself gazing into Draco’s grey eyes.
“Like a road trip?”
“No. You see the other person I cared about… the other person I desired,” Draco said then turned around to face Harry before saying, “was you.”
“Guns are loud. Pick it up,” Alicia said, gesturing at Pansy to pick it up.
“Can’t hold me here forever,” Bellatrix said.
The man gestured at the woman before he opened a nearby closet, dumping a blond haired man onto the floor in front of Pansy. His hands and feet were bound by rope and his mouth was covered with duct tape, Pansy examined his face. She didn’t know him.
He feels a little exposed from the night before. A little bit of a shame from having dug too deep inside himself. The whole day had been a test and Draco thought he handled it well.
“Jesus,” Harry says as if he could be more turned on.
“Friend. Seems funny to say that after we’ve just got done screwing,” Daphne said.
Draco looks panicked but Harry’s dick is hard faster than Draco can say his apology.
“I guess I’ll just have to prance around in my boxers tonight. Think you can hold it together?” Harry says, popping into the bathroom.
“I can just imagine Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy blazing up a doobie,” Draco says.
“Oh. Sorry. I didn’t mean to.”
“Yeah?”
be her!” Draco growled, feeling panicked again.
“How many people have you kissed?”
“Yeah, “ Draco said, still looking embarrassed.
“Being tough isn’t everything,” Harry says, putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“I guess we better see about those supplies,” Draco said and they began to walk back down the road.
“Shit,” he said, starting to drive faster but a figure leapt in front of his car, baring fangs.
“That’s what I thought,” Draco says softly, brimming with pride.
“Yeah. I could. But I don’t have any cause of my own. I have no memories. No background. No history. I can’t even find out what my last name is. Hell, for all I know my name isn’t even Pansy,” Pansy said.
Draco wanted to make a crack about at least expecting dinner first but he restrained himself, instead answering, “All right.”
“No. Not at all. I’ve never… uh…”
“Hey. Get your hand off of her,” Pansy growled, baring her teeth.
Draco is furious, mostly at himself. He should’ve stopped as soon as something seemed wrong. Now he has fucked everything up. Harry comes over and calmly says, “Try to breathe. Call a tow truck to take us to a mechanic.”
Harry’s mouth fell open. Draco winks and they carry on. An hour in and Draco seems fine. Good even. He glows. They occasionally come across other hikers and cyclists and say polite hellos.
“I’m honestly stunned. I thought you’d be complaining by now.”
There is no point in posturing in that case.
Everyone but Draco drinks while he looks around with a grin.
“You ok, Harry?” Draco asks.
“What?”
“You can’t tell me Ron Weasley is going to be nice to me.”
“That’s better. Your turn.”
Harry privately snickers as Draco pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road. It’s an hour-long drive to get there. Something about the music and the drive makes Harry flashback to middle school. What if he and Draco had started dating back then? It’s a strange thought. No. It’s good that it’s happening now.
“Oh. I thought maybe you’d want to join me.”
“Is he… at least a bad person?” Pansy said, cringing, able to feel the hunger.
The women all looked at each other.
“Would you have rather me said that?” Draco says.
“It is. Never have I ever… made out with the guy I’m dating in the bathroom of a party my friends are throwing,” Draco says, grinning as he drinks.
“Blaise. What happened to Blaise?” Draco said.
Darlene sighed.
She looks back and forth at them briefly then says, “Yep. All good.”
They come to a high hill that overlooks the trail, climbing it and standing out at the top. Some other people just left. Evergreen as far as the eye can see, rolling up the sides of mountains.
“Left it is.”
“Yeah. Nice day, isn’t it?” Penelope said, looking up at the blue skies.
“Aww, come on! Live a little, Draco.”
“Do we dare head to Safeway? I mean surely they would anticipate people going to a grocery store,” Draco said.
“So, what do we do now? Just wait to see if the Death Troopers return to kill us? Assuming they really are all vampires,” Draco said.
“How was that?” Draco asks.
“Fuck. Fuck. Oh. Ohhh,” Draco moaned as hot pleasure washed through him, almost painfully as his cock pulsed into Harry’s mouth.
“Goodnight, Harry. And hey-“
“Really, Harry?” Draco asks.
Harry: “Never have I ever thought about someone else while having sex with my partner.”
“I suppose. I don’t know if I can sleep. Maybe I’ll just lay here and listen to the radio,” Draco said, stuffing his trail mix back in his pack.
“Well. She was really in love with me. My family approves of her family. I suppose we were both similar in a lot of ways.”
“Do you miss your home? That place… the one whose name I can’t remember,” Pansy said.
“What the fuck, Harry?” Ron asks as he, Neville, Cho, and Draco all drink.
“That’s unfortunate.”
Harry nervously swallows and says, “No. Not even a kiss. Just fantasies. What about you?”
“Hey,” Draco says, coming up and kissing Harry.
Harry chuckles as they nearly start making out before Harry pulls away. Draco had planned on being much more low-key but that doesn’t seem to be working out.
“I own some property but it’s out in Maryland. Which is where the address on my Driver’s License is,” Draco said.
So, do you want to do something? There’s this place in West Seattle I like a lot.
“It’s probably a trap. Dammit,” Harry said.
Sure. Just let me know the deets.
“God, who is that?” Draco called out, desperately looking away from the shower as he went to wash his mouth in the sink.
Draco sped up his strokes while Harry continued to push back against Draco’s groin, his legs and his feet pushing back against him too. Draco’s hand desperately rubbed over the head of Harry’s cock.
“You, Pansy, and this guy at a gay club. That was how I figured it out. Or confirmed. I went to a gay club and there was this guy. We kissed for half a second. It was barely anything.”
Harry doesn’t have to ask what
“Now, how about we turn the lights off, strip down to our underwear and have ourselves a good and hard… sleep,” Harry says, giving Draco a peck on the lips then rolling over to turn off his lamp.
“I am. That’s weird,” she said and tried to pull the thing off.
“Oh. Uh… I dunno. I suppose you can’t know until I’ve proven it. But I’m no fan of the president. I mean I didn’t like the old president or whatsherface that he was running against but he’s a real piece of work I’ll admit,” Pansy said.
Harry leans forward and whispers, “I asked, didn’t I?”
“I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you want?”
“I’m down. Let me know the details,” Draco says, putting a hand beneath Harry’s chin and drawing him over into a kiss.
Ginny: “Never have I ever called someone by someone else’s name in bed.”
Draco curls his long-fingered hand and taps his knuckle against the door. The door quickly opens and Ron Weasley is standing on the other side.
“You can’t stop a bullet. You should get the rest,” Draco said.
“I don’t. Shit.”
Saturday flies by and it’s Sunday morning soon enough. Harry is keeping it simple with a tight grey tee-shirt and dark grey cargo shorts along with his pack. Draco pulls up and gets out of the car. He’s decked out in flannel and a good set of hiking pants. He’s wearing a beanie to top it all off, which Harry finds incredibly cute.
“Harry, what if you set off the trap?” Draco said.
“All right. You can bite. Better than a hickey.”
Harry decides these pictures need a response. He slides off the bed and takes off his clothes. After a lot of maneuvering and body twisting and bending he gets some good shots of himself on the bed, ass up. He sends them to Draco then puts the phone away again. He doesn’t even type any other sorts of reply. He thinks the ass says it all.
“Just drink some water. That wasn’t really a lot of alcohol and you drank it slowly. You’ll be fine. If you have to sleep on the sofa you can,” Harry says, rubbing Draco’s back.
They stopped at a crosswalk, waiting for the signal light.
“I was an asshole. Still kind of am.”
That was funny. Remembering killing Charlie made her happy but thinking about hurting a wolf made her sad. She supposed that meant she wasn’t a complete monster. But Darlene had seemed pretty disturbed even though really she was doing her a favor.
Draco sits up, hating that he’s been forced to lose his cool so much. Vulnerability. Disgusting.
“I won’t let you down. Probably,” Pansy said and grinned.
Harry gets inside, coming straight for Draco, his full lips enveloping Draco’s lips for a short, slow kiss. Harry’s very touch is better than the finest wine or the richest dessert and Draco’s body responds with the ease of a light switch.
“You have weapons?” Draco asked.
I can’t wait to see.
“Stand back,” Harry said, sticking a hand out that immediately started to glow.
“Oh,” Draco said as something dawned on him.
Draco was unnerved by the silence as he did his business behind a bush. It really was like the world had died. Surely, he and Harry couldn’t be the only survivors in town.
“I know.”
“They are going to look at it real quick but he says any BMW parts will need to be ordered overnight.”
“I was fucking with you. Not that it matters. I dated two different girls in school and college and now I’ve been kissing you.”
“Who’s that?” Pansy asked.
She’s just staring like she’s just had a complete system shutdown.
“Fair enough,” Draco says, smiling calmly, unworried.
“Did you vote?” Harry asked.
Harry slowly pulls away, sad as Draco’s lips slip away, his mouth still parted.
“Of course not. Let’s go back inside,” Harry says.
“How is she?” Angelina asked.
“What?” Harry says.
“Yeah. And then she was there last night with
Draco opens quickly, looking Harry up and down with pleasure.
Just… hey. If Harry had the time he could sit here all day analyzing that single hey.
“Been tryin’ to forget,” Pansy laughed, then quickly swiped with her sword, lightly cutting across Alicia’s cheek.
“Sure do,” Ginny says.
“All of them? Christ. There were at least twelve of them. How did she survive that?” Katie asked, crouching beside Pansy.
“Why, you-“ Draco starts but she’s already back inside.
“I don’t know where this is going but… I know I want to find out,” Harry says.
“Paramore. You’re listening to Paramore now?” Harry asks.
“Do you like these?” Draco says, waving his Clif bar in front of his face.
“It wasn’t like that, Harry. We were just really incompatible. Let’s leave it at that.”
“Not verbally,” she says with a wink then walks on by.
“Every vampire. All of them. Every vampire who ever walked the earth. Of course, some didn’t agree to help him and lots are in other countries but who cares about them anyway. Most of us American vampires agreed to work for him. And I agreed too. At least I said I did. Bloodlust is a hell of a drug. I wasn’t in such a good mood on account of going to hell or whatever. But then… last night… I saw the two of you in the closet… Well, I guess I still kinda love you, Draco, if even you killed me and sent me to an unbearable hell,” Pansy said, her voice sounding sincere.
When Draco woke up the sun was shining through the blinds and Harry was snoring mere inches away from him. He wanted to apologize for not taking his turn at watch but figured Harry was sleeping just fine. Draco slid out of bed. It was the middle of summer but it still felt cold in that house, like the Hollow had drifted into an unexpected winter. There was no heat, no electricity and not much in the way of humanity.
“Never have I ever fart while someone was going down on me,” Neville says, noticeably more drunk than everyone else somehow.
The wait for the tow isn’t long, thankfully. Harry calls an Uber to get them to the auto repair shop. The shop isn’t busy but they are closing in an hour.
Cho: “Never have I ever ghosted someone.”
“Thank you. But really, I’m fine. Never better.”
“Hey,” Draco replies.
“Makes sense,” Pansy replied, coming around to Daphne as she pulled her tee-shirt on.
“Well. I do a lot of reading. I like to drive.”
“Right or left?” Harry says as they reach the other side where the path splits two ways.
