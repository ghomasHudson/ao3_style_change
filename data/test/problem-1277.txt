"Either of you ever wanted to learn to play the drums?"
Harry makes poor after party choices, and Draco comforts Persephone after all.
So that's not what I've been doing wrong. I fear you're going to come home to some spoiled children. I'm not letting them get away with being mean, or with doing anything dangerous, but other than that they are all getting whatever they want. Luckily they haven't taken complete advantage yet, but Lainie and River have new sheet music, and Viona and the babies may have had an inappropriate amount of biscuits. Also, no one remembers what bedtime means. Sorry.
Ooo! Rereading your email, I have just fixated on your suggestion of forcing you to feed me Ben and Jerry's whilst naked at my feet, so that's what I'm going to do!
Shite! Getting myself all worked up here with nothing to do about it.
Friday June 20th
Once our youngest had been sufficiently paid off and the oldest were sufficiently paid off to take them out, they headed off to Unity Park to have a fun day of riding rides and causing mayhem. It's a good thing I still partially own the place and can afford to pay for any damages.
Brilliant our husband is.
He was so surprised by this that Bianca succeeded in drowning him for nearly three seconds before he recovered and Apparated to my side.
As you know, I took River with me to Unity House today, he's going to have a nice long session with Yesenia. Hopefully she will have some insight as to how to transition him seamlessly into our family and how to help him grieve and remember his mum. She didn't leave River any letters did she? I hope we end up being a good family for him. Can I tell you something? I am already helplessly in love with him. I want to keep him forever! It's like, he walked into our home and my heart went "yep, that's the one, this one's ours."
P.S. Are you excited for our first movie night since coming back tomorrow? Tabitha says that to welcome us home, she's letting me pick the movie! Lilo and Stitch it is!
If I thought this past week has flown by, it's nothing compared to how the minutes are creeping along right now. You are off making sure everything on our last-minute checklist is being completed. Overseeing the packing process like the aristocrat who was born to rule that you are. I was going to come help you, and hope you'll forgive me for not following through. I thought I would sit in our bedroom and have a good cry so I'm ready to face the trip with dry eyes and hope.
"And I love them SO MUCH! I love them and Ron and Hermione AND KISA!!! I just want to tie her to my bed and never let her go!!!"
"Oh! That's way cooler than just being a weird name!" Shtara exclaimed in excitement, demanding her turn to hold the bear.
She ruffled his hair. "Well I WAS rather distracted. I've never even seen a boy as good looking as you before. And I LIVE in a place where hot boys go surfing all the time!"
I knew we'd have a good time no matter the outcome, but I was a bit worried about the attendance if I can confide that worry in you after the fact. However, I didn't need to be concerned. Even if it were only attended by the Southern African Wizarding Society (not only South Africa as a country, but many of the other neighboring Southern African countries - that's confusing) it would have been a good turnout. Even if it had been attended by only the British Wizarding Society that we tricked into purchasing tickets during the English gala it would have been a good turnout. Combine the two? And it was VERY well attended. However, as each Unity House has been doing a great job of not only advertising their own upcoming event whenever it's scheduled, but advertising each event? Well it was attended from peoples throughout the world.
He sighed, sounding rather defeated. "So I gather, as it is apparently one of the things I need to work on."
Wednesday August 26th
So then - once I was nice and ready - I emerged from our closet and couldn't remember why I was standing in our room. My stomach growled and that reminded me that I hadn't eaten or even done my morning routine yet. After calling for Muffy to bring me caviar with hollandaise sauce, I ate and then walked into our bathroom to do my morning routine, except I stood in there unable to remember why the bloody fuck I was in there.
Naked
Sniffing and trying to stop crying, Elena continued the explanation. "Ethan was honest, you know? He explained to me that he and his wife were having troubles ever since their second was born, and they thought that maybe adding some spice to their sex life would help. I KNEW that it was going to be a one time thing, and I thought that would be perfect to get him out of my system, but for me at least, it just made everything worse!"
Anyway, the lawyers seem pretty confident that even with that added tidbit in the article on page four that there will be enough pushback from the public to silence any naysayers. Similar to when the article tried to insinuate the Kids had to earn their keep, there are always going to be a handful of people who believe the worst. But with the fact that the positive article was front page and that the smaller article only had one negative side to it, it's unlikely there will be many people who make that argument. They didn't want to give you false hope so they did let you know it COULD be blown up and used against you, but it shouldn't be altogether too much.
Here's the third option that is making me a bit hysterical ....
I had a lovely day at the Burrow with you. It's so wonderful how you've managed to settle yourself in as part of my family. I love you so much!
But getting back to my point.
I'm sure that we don't ALWAYS do it exactly this way, but I have to tell you that being inside Harry while Oliver was inside me was one of the best experiences of my life. I really don't think anything can feel better, so I don't think having my memories come back will suddenly change my mind on how good it felt. The only mildly frustrating thing was that I just kept on going and going when I actually would have quite liked to finish quickly and get some sleep.
He immediately looked crushed, and seeing that on my face made me laugh rather harder than necessary, so I took pity on him. "Muffy! Bring my guest to see Harry and Oliver, but don't let on that it's not me. I want to see how far this game gets."
-We had years of potions and surgeries to help Hazel transition fully.
P.S. Since I'm awake and feeling a bit gross after quarantine (I didn't feel like bathing that often), I've decided to take a bath with Serenity after we dance a bit. I will have Muffy on hand so that if I accidentally fall asleep in there with her, no magic safety spells will be needed, just a good old fashioned servant waking me back up and telling me to go to bed. Or probably more like taking charge of Serenity and letting me stay asleep in the tub, ha.
My darling husband,
Friday morning was perfect for touristy things, such as exploring El Castillo de Santa Catalina, and El Castillo de San Sebastián, which are on either side of La Playa la Caleta. This allowed us to get in a little beach time while we were at it. But then (after lunch and a nap), of course, we went to the Gran Teatro Falla to watch the finale of the singing competition that had been going on for about 20 days.
"***I'M*** BEING UNREASONABLE?!?!"
But I felt calm and alive. It was a process I needed to repeat a few times before I finally graduated, and then I repeat it from time to time when I have strong emotions I don't quite know how to deal with - aside from shove them in a box, and this seems better for me in the long run. I curse myself until I reach that state of flying in oblivion for a while, and then when I come back, I feel like myself again.
Love,
"More or less," I murmured, ruffling his hair.
Gretchen gasped in horror and sympathy. I could see the face of Gretchen's pimp clearly in her mind. She shook her head. "NO... Something like that CAN'T happen to someone as beautiful as Mahafsoun!"
I don't think anyone outside of our little planning committee knew what to expect. The people close to Hazel and Eris knew that at the very least the fashions were going to be awesome. But would they have enough variety? Would they go too far into couture and no one would buy extreme fashions?
-In the event of a divorce, Merlin forbid, if it happens within a short amount of time (I don't know what's good, a year? five years?) we all leave with what we brought into the marriage. If it happens after that number all liquid assets are split in even thirds. Land/Property/Businesses to be determined based on initial investment and in the case of a business based on actual work effort put into the business.
ANYWAY, papa ... not papa .... disagreement ensues. Atreyu was telling Nora that I’m not a Papa but I’m a daddy. She asked him why. He didn’t answer for a few minutes. And not in one of those “he was silent for a few minutes” but really it was twenty seconds but the story teller had to exaggerate. He literally sat there contemplating the question for over three minutes.
"Right?!" I asked and agreed at the same time.
Thursday March 29th
This is going to be short because I have about a million things to do today and very little time to get them accomplished. But I just HAD to get these things off my chest before I burst with them.
And yet, I do and I probably always will.
So, when she returns from the loo, she's going to lead me through some mental exercises in which we explore some of the other things I could do to help me feel fulfilled and worthwhile as a person. When we're done, I'll come find you, snuggle you tight, and let you know what the results - if any - are.
I feel like I was too subtle the last few times I asked for this ....
But maybe - just maybe - knowing that I'm not asking to shag other people and can in fact live without that part, well, maybe it'll help the two of you - specifically Oliver - relax. Maybe you'll no longer be afraid that this will eventually be a deal breaker for us. The other part of the question, what will I do if I learn that you are just never going to be comfortable with the level I'm asking for, we'll I don't think I will really DO anything other than I've already mentioned - try to persuade you otherwise and do whatever it takes to make you feel more comfortable with the idea.
Side note, is it just my imagination, or was Teddy PURPOSELY trying to look both male and female today. I mean I knew it had to be him based off the fact that he was part of our group and wearing his name pendant that you gave him forever ago, but he looked... very equally male and female. Like so hard to determine that a person might be tempted to strip him off and check for those parts which indicated gender - sort of like checking a puppy (and yes, I'm tired and now babbling, I think).
Shite, sorry.
Hazel glared at him for a second before turning her angry, tear filled eyes on the Viper. "Just as I don't understand why SHE wants to be A BOY!!!"
You branded me! I can't believe you branded me! Is it seriously permanent, or were you just trying to get me all worked up?
"Because I'm surrounded by kids who have almost nothing, and no guarantee that they'll ever have a family, and even then, no guarantee that their family will be able to give them the things they need to be themselves. OF COURSE I want to help *anyone* when all they really want is something so simple as a ride so that they can take advantage of an opportunity to follow their dreams."
I ne~~~~~ed your love
Orion was laughing happily as he played with my energetic furball. "Hi there, Lumi. Aww, such a pretty girl!"
I gave everyone your apologies for not joining us. Just let them know you were tired and choosing rest over food. That definitely caused Sirius to go beet red, since he assumed I had just shagged you senseless and not knowing the real reason for your exhaustion. We hadn't spoken to anyone since we got back from the Healer's so unless you were shooting your news into your insta-owls, no one knew yet that you were pregnant. Well, I certainly wasn't going to give your news without you here so I just let them think what they wanted to think.
At this slow pace, it took about a half an hour for our float to get from the North end of town to the South one. But then, our float (and only our float) was given the honor of being parked at the official end of the line for the parade - off to the side - so that we could watch the rest of the floats pass by until Viona herself arrived on the last float.
Happy Memorial Day - if you celebrate it. It was gorgeous here in Minnesota today, so I kind of did, lol ^_^
I frowned at that. "Oh? How?"
And uh, I can't write it in the correct alphabet so I'll do my best to write it as it sounds ...
Good Morning from sunny, beautiful, South Africa! I suppose not as sunny as it could be since this first of the annual trips was scheduled to start at the beginning of South Africa's winter. It probably works out quite well for any Europeans planning on traveling to attend this first fundraiser.
Harry
I had set such a fast pace, and the entire time you looked posh and perfect. Lazily running your hands all over my body. It was such a fantastic mixture of emotions. The speed was fast, the fucking was hard, but your hands were soft and sweet and unhurried. Being the absolute best Master a sub could ask for, you seemed to know just when I hit the line between erotically frustrated and too frantic to really enjoy it. You grabbed my as yet untouched cock, pumped it twice, and commanded me in your husky sex-deep voice, to "Come for your Master!" So I did.
Your weasel is a little in love with Blaise? I did *not* see that coming. I mean not for real anyway. I know that Blaise has mysterious powers that seem to make *everyone* fall in love with him temporarily, but it usually doesn't last much longer than two or three hours after he leaves the bedroom. And you know, come to think of it, if you don't count the fact that he and I played a few times over the course of *years,* the longest he's ever actually stayed with any one person (or two) has been about three or four shags. Perhaps ironically, in the past, whenever a person has reached that point where they start hinting that they'd like to try dating him, that's when he moves on. So the fact that *he* told me that he was half dating Hermione and Rrrrr - just can't do it! Anyway, it probably means something to him.
Ah! I just want to wake you up and talk with you! I didn't see you Monday, I didn't see you yesterday, and now your pretty face is just sitting there looking all flushed and pretty! I miss you!
NOT that she would be less than perfectly safe in our home, but moral support, I suppose.
It was a lovely start to my day - lunch for the rest of you - to see Viona hug Eris, apologize profusely, and promise to be by her side for all the planning. But I could see that something was wrong. As soon as possible, I took Viona aside to ask her what was wrong.
Sigh...
Your Harry
This is the unresolved issues I was talking about. This influences the upcoming chapters, BUT it's not all Draco being a snarling bitch, lol. He knows what's wrong now, so he tries his best to cope with it. That said, there are still some rough patches ahead...
Harry chuckled softly. “I suppose it does. Alright fine... Back in Hogwarts, did you ever feel anything akin to lust for me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
You know, I really think Viona had a tear or two escape her immaculate made up eyes. She was certainly holding her breath and determinedly maintaining a warm smile in an attempt to prevent any unauthorized leaking BEFORE the ceremony was over and she had an excuse to look less than perfect.
Shhh nighty night
P.S. I've asked Muffy to charm the pints of Strawberry Cheesecake Ben and Jerry's ice cream so that they would remain the perfect consistency while we eat them in the onsen tonight, so look forward to that!
Our Precious Harry,
I, on the other hand, am actually planning on taking the babies and the littles over to Unity house for a few hour visit. It's been much too long since I've spent time there. I think I need to hear happy little voices.
Why won't they let me see you?
Maybe sit still for three or four days in a row, eat biscuits and drink tea while you talk wedding plans with Vivi. Snuggle up and watch terrible anime nonsense with Siri, Zwei, and Zaire. Sit in on a lesson or two with Jaz and see how far she's come with her speech patterns. Will you please do that for me?
Since we have a big day on Saturday and you've had a busy week with all of your classes, I'd really really really like it if you'd do me a favor and get some rest the next few days.
"Remind me to say all of that if anyone ever stares at me like a creep!" Elena exclaimed, skipping after Kisa.
My Sad Love,
So...
Thursday October 25, 2018
I shook my head. "The ONLY repayment I need is for you to promise me that you'll use the time I've given you to get better, and then once you are, fix up your life. Get a job. Go to school. Do something that makes you happy."
Blaise Zabini – Hermione Granger – Ron Weasley – Kisa – The Quartet
Ooohhhhh, my love, my darling
Long story short ... she doesn't exist. I asked my 'Mione to do a lookup from her end if there was such a child reportedly in existence on any international database she'd have access to. I asked Kamaria for access to her databases (I figured I'd do it myself and give her plausible deniability). A child with her name, with the birthday she gave me (even give or take a year), in Iran or any of the surrounding countries ... does not exist.
It was then that his reasons flashed across his mind. A slightly older girl when he was 13 or so. A boy who had teased 15-16 year old him in Hogwarts. Me squatting next to him as he lay on the floor. These scenes looked bright and 'normal' at first, but then got shadowed over as he (and this took me a bit to work out) IMAGINED himself strangling or beating them to death.
My Dearests,
Love,
Well, I have some other emails to check. They really pile up over the weekend when I'm not checking my Unity email very often!
I know I talk about not liking it but I DO NOT want you to quit. I just want you to care about yourself half as much as you care about other people. Is that so much to ask? For you to give yourself half the consideration you give anyone else.
I'm over at Unity taking a quick break from birthday party preparations, so I figured I would hide from our daughter and write you a bit. Seriously, I love her, but she's scary. I think she spends much too much time with her Auntie Hermione. Between her grandmothers and her aunts, Elena is going to grow up to run the world. I just wonder if she's going to end up a beloved leader or a ruthless dictator. There has been more than one occasion where I've wanted to ask her "Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?"
Ollie! Sorry I shut my gob for that moment but I have to interrupt, IF Draco was talking with Grandmama, I can promise the only way he would be talking about you is if someone had hurt you and he was talking about the person who did so. Theoretically of course.
Which of course I did. She hopped about and cried, threatening to tell Robards on me.
I don't need the sun as long as I can see your face,
And have you noticed Atreyu with you the last week or so? He uh, okay don't take this the wrong way alright? He says you smell funny. Yesterday when you came searching for us, you seemed surprised that I had already started making pancakes for lunch. I hadn't had time to read your email at that point, so how did I know you wanted breakfast for lunch and pancakes with berries specifically (and a bunch of other stuff but still)?
"The bad man's gone. Your daddy vanquished him. Everything is alright now..."
As for today, surprise surprise, my class was canceled. See, the Ministry itself is convinced that I need a few consecutive days off so that I can process what happened (and they know exactly what happened as they have a good visual of most of it, except for those times I closed my eyes), so, I'm not expected back until next Monday. I promise you I will spend the entire week in bed just holding you if you feel that's what it'll take to get past the unconscious feeling like I'm going to just be gone when you turn to look at me.
Viper smirked at me, probably also finding it funny that his Draco's friends were looking at me like I was a giant insect. "I've been meaning to ask, why didn't you get those tattoos when you went into to get that one?" He swiped his finger across the little Slytherin snake just above my heart on the front of my shoulder.
My point is that because we keep them separate, when I plan for their financial future, I do so based off what's in MY vaults, figuring that you can always add to what I've given them - like my father did for Elena. And here's the funny thing, I only gave her a 10th of my liquid assets at the time - which is exactly what my father had done for me, thus even with 4 siblings I didn't have at the time I got my first vault, my father still has a lot more money to split up than I do, despite me earning money like mad over the years. He has too, as his businesses still perform rather well.
Gryffindor 4
You (Harry) got involved in a group dance that resembles a mosh pit in which you basically dance with everyone and no one all at once, and no one was showing any real finesse. It was basically a way to relax and have fun to the beat.
Oh. I think he really did know.
As I was saying, a perfect day.
Draco
Here's the thing, if I could find a way to do it that completely bypassed all the magical and genetic inheritance issues, I'd probably do it. And perhaps ironically - since we run several orphanages around the world - but I have a great deal of sympathy for people who want biological children and cannot have them. If a muggle gay couple came to me and asked me to carry one created from their DNA being combined, because they don't have the magic necessary to do it themselves, I would probably do it. I'm not sure I'd even think about it much first because, to me, I'd simply be helping them have *their* child.
Instead of whisking us off to the ballroom, you decided to sing for us. And again, I must have been in just an awful mood, because I complained of my clothes and the hay and the lack of music. Instead of throwing a strop, or getting annoyed with me for not giving in to your request, you just began singing. Patiently waiting until the moment I gave in and found my way into your arms where I belong.
I will not bury one more piece of my soul Draco. I won't allow it. I won't survive it.
This weekend I’ve booked out for my family. No way am I missing our girls’ show. But the following weekend I am actually taking my classes on a field trip.
I could lounge around in the sun on the beach all day, I may just ….

Vozlyublennaya
Not needing any sort of immediate attention, she sent me to the family waiting room and assured me that she'd have you delivered and everyone perfectly healthy in no time. A different Mediwitch took me in hand and gently guided me to the waiting room, reminding me that at 32 and 34 weeks, both babies were almost certainly going to be born healthy with maybe a touch of jaundice, but certainly nothing that they couldn't fix in mere seconds.
Of course we should ask her. She is old enough to give her thoughts on adoption. Maybe she’s not interested and all of our worry is for nothing. Maybe she thinks of us as fun big brothers and doesn’t have any interest in being our daughter.
The plan that we'd implemented without anyone knowing it was to have the meeting room heavily bugged with my tech. We also had it warded to the teeth, and each person that entered the room was told that they could not bring in ANY weapons or technology. Not even mobile phones! We told them (in muggle terms since most of them are) that we'd surrounded the place with tech that would disable any and all technology even if they managed to sneak it in.
Anyway, once in Hannah's office, we made a little progress. I *think* we might have found a connection in an unexpected place. A mind healer, er, muggle equivalent of a mind healer. Two of the victims see the same mind healer. It's not perfect because the other two don't so far as we can tell, but it's a start.
My Own,
Wednesday September 16th
Oh Draco and Ollie, our baby girl is through her childhood! She's a young woman. A bride. She's someone's wife! How did this happen?!?!?!
You were dressed in a basic demon costume since that was what I was buying the day I was attacked and wasn't able to accessorize it properly. Still, you looked good. Viona was dressed as a Goblin and somehow managed to look freakin' adorable!
We'll see how it goes.
"No thank you," Eris replies politely.
As soon as he broke free, I ended up entwined by those same appendages immediately after. I didn't mind being caught so much, I could have stayed wrapped up all day. But alas, I had JUST sent a message to Minnie telling her since you were home I'd be able to come in for at least a short time. I had an easier time extricating myself on my own, I think it's because I'm a bit smaller so it's easier for me to escape confining spaces.
Se agapo,
There were a few times where I thought it was possible that I could have gotten to him, but it would have meant tipping her off and I couldn't risk either of you. I would have been home probably that same day if he had been working alone.
I let this continue on for quite some time, enjoying every moment of it, but Oliver eventually started looking a bit overwhelmed, and since he almost certainly had nothing for stamina, the enforced version from my spell must be harming more than helping at that point, so I impressed myself by casting TWO spells at the same time, both wordless and wandless. The one on him took off the denial spell, while the one on you brought on instant orgasm.
"If any of that's true, then why didn't the dad just call us to take the mum away?" A younger male Auror asked.
Tiger gave me a look like he genuinely believed that this was a waste of time, but since he didn't have anything better to do, decided to give it a try. Oberon watched us warily for a few moments, looking half convinced that I was just setting him up so that he'd get into trouble for destroying such expensive looking things. But after Tiger and I both destroyed about a half a dozen things each, he decided that he couldn't get into trouble after all.
They announce Harry's pregnant :-)
My beloved, snuggly husband,
My Harry,
My Heart is yours,
Harry
"Come on, love, drink this," you insisted.
Blaise was now giving out oral to anyone who wanted it. My Auror friend's wife was riding the Sybian. You were being plowed rather eagerly by Charlie, spouting a long string of broken curses. This time, I HAD to get involved, smacking Charlie's arse to encourage him to fuck you good and proper before walking around to give you kisses. I cast a charm to wet your mouth - which had gone dry from panting - kissed you some more, cast a modified Aguamenti so that your mouth would continually stay wet (but not enough water to choke on), and then slowly opened my long zipper so that my extremely hard shaft could burst free. I could see the moment you realized what I was doing; your eyes got an eager gleam to them and your mouth automatically opened.
Considering that River sent us both an Insta-owl, I'm going to assume you already know this, but he apologizes profusely for flaking out on his own birthday celebration, and feels super embarrassed that every single person there knows exactly what he's been doing the past couple of days.
But as I said to begin with, I'm going to be so busy today that my day actually started at 6 AM!!!!!!! And so, now that I'm finished eating, showering, and getting dressed, I'm signing off now to run off and get started
Anyway, Monday night was peaceful enough. The village elders greeted us warmly. They were delighted to find that we both speak isiZulu - admittedly, Zaire more so than me, but I knew enough to understand the gist of almost everything. After explaining our situation and why we were there, they had a bit of a discussion, and then decided to perform a ceremony officially welcoming Zaire into the tribe.
Okay, I know I'm being unreasonable. I just miss you! And your email quite got my hopes up, when you said the Russian contingent told you to send the girls "home with Leah" for a moment I thought that meant they were coming HOME ... not back to Grandmama's house. When I finally caught on and realized what you had said it was like being hit with all of you leaving all over again. I had to cry into Ollie's lap.
Monday March 26th
I was rereading yesterday's email about the lovely dinner we all had together, and the upcoming fire dancing (which was amazing obviously), and just random rambling about the day we were having prior to dinner. But I couldn't get the sentence "I wonder what the real Harry Potter looks like now, he must be getting OLD!" out of my head.
P.P.P.S - The reason I'm glad we're going home a bit early is that I'm pretty sure I've been overdoing it with how tired I'm currently feeling. But don't panic, it's *not* bad enough to go into the hospital, just that I should really stop pushing myself to do so much.
For the next half an hour or so, I gave Miles a basic lesson in applying make up (that I learned from Pansy, in case you were wondering) as I applied it to both of us and encouraged Miles to tweak it until it looked right to him. THEN I told him to choose a song he liked so we could sing it together - me casting a spell on a few instruments so that they'd play the right music to accompany us. It took Miles a few minutes to stop blushing and hesitating, since he had chosen a rather bawdy song, but once he got into it, he was really belting it out in an impressive display of innate talent.
I'm not even going to risk it until I know that *you* are back. If you never regain your memories, then we are both going to have to learn how to live this new life - you finding your place in our lives again and me being the rock that keeps us all together and functioning. We sat down to drink tea, exchange pleasantries, and give me a moment to write a little something for the Daily Prophet - not to mention this email - when an owl arrived.
I'm a little freaking out, and the good news is that it has nothing to do with what happened to me. See, I noticed something alarming. You know how we're half certain that Serenity is allergic to magic? How we've all stopped using magic as much as possible to see if it helps?
My day started with Zaire jumping on our bed about 15 minutes to noon. Just as I predicted, he was afraid that I wouldn't be ready in time for our 2 PM class if I didn't get up and ready right that second. Pippa entered the room right behind him to wake me up for the same reason, and watched him in amusement.
Saturday October 29th
"Yes Master," she replied obediently before handing a staff to each of my students.
Suddenly, I felt a sense of enlightenment hit me. "OH! That makes sense!"
Only, BECAUSE I was interested in Jules - and at first it wasn't really a concern so much as a feeling that something wasn't quite right, and also some attraction. I made a decision to take advantage of the attraction to see if I could figure out what it was that was triggering something in me. Now that I've had a few weeks to think about it, I *THINK* I might actually have been feeling that nameless thing that Harry felt when he wandered all around Paris not knowing what was wrong, but eventually finding Nora's magic tugging at him.
"But you must have done SOMETHING to make Harry Potter turn gay and fall in love with you!" Romeo insisted.
Part of me is interested in shagging you, but I think at the moment, it's simply because it's been the longest we've gone without since we got our libidos back. The other part remembers that while I *can* shag while I'm like this, there's no orgasm, and so, it would end with disappointment for both of us. Well, maybe not for you since I'm certain I could take you apart and make you scream my name.
Well we couldn't buy outfits just for one picture, so we took a few more while we were still all dressed up. We got a gorgeous shot of our three girls cheek to cheek to cheek, practically drowning in turquoise tulle. The sweetest picture of River standing with Orion in front of him, holding his little baby hands so they can both "stand" together. He's been here for such a short time but he's already such a wonderful big (and little!) brother! And the five of them, on the formal sofa, Orion in Elena's lap, Eris in River's, and Viona sitting center stage, I can't get over the sheer beauty and perfection of our family.
I love that you want to take revenge for me, but there's no need. Rabastan was killed in the Final Battle. One of the others was sent to Azkaban and mysteriously died. As for the third (and last), he seemingly escaped justice, but I can assure you that he will never be found. And no, that doesn't mean that I dirtied my hands in *any* way, shape, or form. I simply know that he will never be found. You do not need to worry about him.
DRACO!!!
It was Unity against our brood, then boys against girls, and even smaller teams against each other. There was never any clear and definite winner - which wasn't the point, besides Elena consistently out danced them all. Then - when we all needed a break from the dancing - our (not so) mini dictator took over and insisted that everyone sit in a circle and sing songs.
And then there's the Princess. Normally I let you take care of Viona's morning routine. She likes to sleep in like you do, you have matching skin care routines, she likes you the best, it just makes sense. So in the same amount of time it took me to get the other five ready, I spent getting Viona ready. "Mumdah! Want nana!" Excuse me Miss Demanding? "Mumdah, nana pwees?" And Merlin forbid I peel the banana for her. "No! Me do." So I have to peel it a little bit to get it started but not so much that she thinks I've done it for her like a baby. They all got baths last night so I didn't have to bathe her thank goodness, but she still wanted her creams and lotions and in the correct order. "No, Mumdah!" every time I tried to do them in the wrong order.
"I don't mind staying," Jaz signed at me. "You've talked about your cases enough that I've 'heard' about murder before. I like knowing that you do what you can to help bring justice."
“I honor you Daddies!” Oh my sweet boy.
"She watches him leave through the window until his blue and white car - which looks black and white in the darkness - is completely out of sight, then she turns to Liam and smiles fondly. 'Your father thinks I'm stupid. He thinks I don't know what he's really doing. Yes, he will be working and earning a lot of extra money, but he'll also be staying with his new *friend* and leaving me home with you as if I didn't used to be a party girl with a hundred friends and so many better things to do on bloody Christmas.'
"Mr. Malfoy! Is there a problem? Did we miss a quarterly meeting?!"

This provoked a rather informative session with both Yesenia and Rowe. I won't go into tedious details, but basically, I actually WAS doing it wrong. Sort of. I didn't know what a good latch felt like, and so, I was letting the babies latch on poorly, which was the main cause of the pain I was feeling. Now that Rowe taught me how to do it correctly, it doesn't feel quite so bad.
You have so much going on in your pretty little head Darling. We've a new son, two pregnant daughters, another daughter who just had life changing surgery, you're teaching Auror training classes, you're still consulting with Hannah, you're apparently going to discuss with me whether or not you will teach someone the insanely dangerous skill of Legilimens, I think it's very likely that whatever is going on with you not feeling well might be your body's way of begging you to take a break.
My perfect men,
You looked down, a tiny bit sad. "His Mind Healer says that he won't let almost anyone near him. He - much like a wild animal - growls and throws a fit when anyone tries to go near him or pick him up. He'll let people near him if they have food in their hands and he's hungry - which being two, he's ALWAYS hungry. But other than that... I think maybe you are right. Perhaps he'd respond better to animals."
But since I was the only one not really doing anything, I volunteered to lay the babies down for their nap, and so, I had some time to write this. I should really sign off now and return to the welcome home party.
The last three held just a hint of pain, and it was probably a good thing that the last one made me pass out so hard I slept a good 10 hours. I SO needed that!
When I picture my future children - and I do want more than one. I hated being an only child because it was lonely until I went to Hogwarts. Anyway, when I picture them, they have... well, pale skin, but not quite as pale. Hopefully a bit more golden and healthy looking. I want some of them to have my white blond hair, and some of them to have their father's black hair. I'd like for them to have my height, but then again, a tiny girl who's tough as nails even though she looks delicate and fragile with my hair and his green eyes - ah!
Besides, I thought it was appropriate to end today on a funny note after all the recent drama ^_^
Normally, the tour starts at 11:30 in the morning and goes through 10:00 at night, but we needed more family time than that. So instead of having them pick us up at the hotel and do the pre-stargazing activities, we were able to apparate to the group when we were ready, and then cast a subtle suggestion spell to make them think we'd been with the group all along. If we were going to be in Australia for longer than a weekend I would have had no issues taking 11 hours out of our vacation to have a date with you. But on this trip? Not so much.
Yours,
"Lovely to meet you Meredith," I murmured almost reflexively.
I was going to pop over to Diagon tomorrow to pick up a few things we need for this weekend, some new candles and things like that. Everything is planned and ready, but we just need a few last minute easy to add items. While I'm there I could pop into the jewelry store and see about getting a silver baby set for Daisy, maybe a rattle, a spoon, and a little brush or something like that? I like the idea of getting a keepsake instead of one of a million stuffed animals that new parents get. I think I am going to get a book as well. I've decided buying books for children is going to be "my thing."
Do you think we have a little time to spend at Betty’s before we head back to Hawaii? I just want to make sure Pips and Bandar are settled in and it’s been so long since I’ve been able to catch up. At least for long enough for a cuppa and some gossip?
P.P.S. I think we should NEVER use the damsel curse again and possibly to be safe we should both go get some of those muggle vasectomies.
Robards,
Just then, my Viking Warrior Prince costume caught my eye and since I hadn't worn it in a while, I thought: why not? Also, I had Muffy transfigure some of the clothes that Viona refuses to wear into a matching mini Viking Princess costume. Fuck! How did we manage to adopt such an adorable daughter?!
I don't even know what day it is. I just left the big party for my book. Not the BIG big party, that one is next week, but A big party. I know it's technically Monday early morning here, but with the time change I'm not sure if it's still Sunday there. And I'm much too exhausted to try and figure that out!
She is smirks and a mischievous gleam in her eye compared to Molly's boisterous laughter and Iris' giggles that often end in hiccups. She tricks me into drinking with Lucius so she can judge our drunk arses. But even my Narcissa was laughing out loud.
She did agree that it was a logical theory and she'd like us to come back again today. This time though, she wasn't quite as adamant about needing us to come in right away. That, or she needed a little time to come to terms with seeing our neurotic, anxious arses twice in as many days.
I walked into his rooms, I would have knocked but I knew he was in there and not doing anything he enjoyed. How did I know that do you ask? The deep baritone singing about how he's "Henry the eighth I am, Henry the eighth I am I am!" gave me a bit of a clue that nothing was happening that Sirius wouldn't want interrupted anyway.
"Yeah?" I asked as I tried to sweep his feet out from under him and he evaded it.
At the end of the night, I got up on the stage to sing a song to close out the night and gently urge everyone to go home. The song I sang was: "I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way, show them -"
P.S. Yes, our Ollie deserves ALL the kisses for how wonderful he is with Gabe. And then some extra ones for how wonderful he is with Dylan. And probably a few more for not being offended that Morgana isn't fully in love with him yet. And maybe a couple more because of how much he cares about us. And then another million or so just for good measure!
She still has a death grip on Chia, but she’s socializing! On her own! I’m just so Merlin be damned proud of how far she’s come! How much she grows and heals every day. She’s so strong. I love her so much.
I know why you say if you knew then what you know now, that you would have put your foot down. And I don't blame you. But I would still have gone. I would take this trauma and be grateful. Because even though we weren't able to ultimately fix what's happening there. But we helped so many. I wouldn't have brought our family there. I feel such tremendous guilt that our sweet babies are suffering for my choices. They wake up in fear, crying, and it's my fault. I have no idea how I will ever make this up to them. I swore I would keep my children from experiencing a childhood of wartime manipulations, and then I imprisoned them in a war zone.
It's been a day.
So just let me know when you need me to come to a .... meeting with your fellow investors!
All my love,
Today is our last day of relative peace in the hospital before we go home. Well actually, we're being discharged in about an hour, but even though I am SO ready to go home to OUR bed, I will sort of miss the fact that HERE, I'm basically assured of 24 hour medical attention if necessary.
Unexpectedly, you looked highly concerned. "That's... wonderful... Erm... Er..."
"Right," Girly agreed with a nod of understanding.
Yes, I'm sorry Dragon, Viona started walking during your two weeks of recuperating. I'm sorry you missed it. If the pattern is anything to go by, I got to hear her first word, you got to see her crawl for the first time, and then I saw her first steps, so the next milestone is yours!
But that sweet moment of camaraderie led to the entire night talking about each child's arrival into our lives.
Sev shook his head. "Not so long as she knew where he was, and until he was rescued, he was 'safe' in the care of people she likely trusted."
After returning to our quarters, we basically had the weekend to do nothing but wait for classes to begin on Monday, except, well, you wanted to fine tune your lesson plans, and the problem was that you were trying to stick close to a more 'acceptable' lesson plan when what you really wanted was a more 'informal' one. After discussing it practically to death, you finally agreed with me and Oliver that your style is going to be just as valuable - and perhaps more so - than the previous Professor's.
I really thought going to a muggle restaurant with a massive group of witches and wizards would end with a lot of obliviating, but the fact that they were all American meant that the entire staff just assumed they had no idea about England, and they were just clueless American tourists. I also got to sit next to Donna's starry-eyed little sister Jenny who kept asking me questions about our relationship. Apparently we are the most romantic couple of all time and she has never seen any couple as adorable as we are. She's not wrong, and it was definitely fun being grilled over something besides the war or my scar!
"Hello Draco, it's lovely to finally meet you. I'm Healer Rowe. You've been invited today because we want to test you against baby C to rule out paternity."
I ended the dance exactly as I had planned, on my knees at your feet. You let me stay there for a few moments so I could catch my breath. And I assume, so you could torture me. You stood slowly, in the posh way you have, slowly and gracefully like a true aristocrat who knows he can take his time because the world will wait for him.
"That was an excellent massage!"
And I think I've lost it. There's a chance the fever has gotten high enough to cook my brain a little. Not enough for me to have serious brain damage, but just enough to make me a loopy idiot. How loopy do you ask? Well, I read your email earlier today. Usually I don't go two days without reading an email but we've been pretty busy the last few days preparing for our upcoming things we have to do. Like you going to France and Ollie and I going back to Hogwarts, and ... wait I already said all of this didn't I?

"Not so much too much as... well, I'm still getting used to flirting and being found attractive," he admitted with a shrug.
You know, I thought I'd gotten really good at the Malfoy Mask thing. When I'm not RHH I am able to keep my emotions off of my face. I really thought I had it down! But then playing poker with some of my closest friends and it was like they could read me like a book! Maybe that's the problem? I have a good public mask when needed, but those closest to me can see through it? Either way, it sucks and I hate losing!
Jasmine Kamaria Malfoy
Draco Malfoy! I shouldn't have to ask you for permission to hold my daughter! She's not going anywhere. She's ours. I do really love watching you with her. Second movie night in a row where I got to hold you while you held her. I'm a spoiled selfish boy and usually get my way and you're the one holding me, but I really do love having you in my arms. It has to be the right angle though, with our height difference it can get really awkward really fast!
"Ah," I stated in understanding. "So basically, you meet with a business, make a contract that seems agreeable to them and the Ministry, and then pass that on to your Secretary to deliver with instructions that it be carried out. That's..."
I sicked up and that is obviously much more disgusting than a little stinky air.
Oh, our night!
That said, we were sitting at a table outside the mind healer's office and we noticed something odd. There's a couple of other businesses in the same building; one of which is a specialty gym for women. When we double checked the list of everything the other victims paid for regularly, one of them had that very gym as a monthly expense. SO... we *might* have found the connection after all. This table.
Oh! Looks like it's time to start on your nightly molestation!
Just when I think: "This is it, I can't possibly get any more exhausted than I am right now," I go and find out how wrong I am. There is literally *nothing* more exhausting than being roped into being Hermione Granger's assistant for the last few days before the official opening of her school. I'm so tired that my bones ache and I wasn't even able to shag you before falling asleep.
We got the snacks and the popcorn. All the Kids grabbed their usual spots, many of them perched on the laps of our children. I grabbed my favorite spot of snuggled in your arms with our laps full of babies. And I saw the Viper push the Tiger onto a cozy wide chair and climb into his lap. The Tiger got so stiff I thought he was going to bolt, he seemed so uncomfortable over such a crazy display of affection. And then the lights were dimmed, and the magic and music of Fantasia carried us all away.
In any case, the younger ones are usually no problem. As you said, all I had to do to win them over was read a story. The official book I was holding was called something like Holler Loudly - which I did read to them - but once I was done with that book, I pretended that it just kept going and launched into an epic story about a poor boy who was raised in a cupboard, overcame numerous obstacles, hardships, and murder attempts to eventually save the world - the extremely abridged version.
Poor Oliver, getting an announcement thrown at him in the middle of dinner, and now he's being asked by a little girl he loves if he's going to be a Daddy for her. Ollie, you looked at us with the sweetest mixture of panic and hope, when Draco and I had what I assume were matching smiles and nods, you assured Seph that you would indeed be another Daddy for her if she'd like that. Parker and Cassie looked rather proud of you at that moment.
Draco
My beloved Husband,
I was standing in water up to my knees, carrying two increasingly fussy babies, and trying to make sure the feisty foursome didn't accidentally drown each other with their antics. I think I just stood there gaping at Muffy and Ollie for a solid minute before Muffy took charge. "Muffy will take the young masters and mistresses home to get cleaned up." She popped away with the four and then was back a few moments later to take Dylan and Gabe. "Muffy knows Master Harry should have put these babes to nap an hour ago." She gave me a *look,* and then popped away with the boys. Leaving me to stand there awkwardly staring at Ollie, still in the middle of the creek.
All of my love,
My Heart,
Godparents Ron and Blaise
Friday April 27th
Sunday December 27, 2009
Draco,
When I woke alone, I did my best to get the littles fed and dressed, so the five of us could get to Unity in enough time to get Elena to Traditions on time. There is no way it would have happened without the house elves, shite, it barely happened WITH them!
I hope everyone wasn't too upset when I ran out on your party last night. I just was so overwhelmed. All of those people there for your Harry, and they were stuck with just me. All of those people so glad to see "I" was home safe. That Molly would not stop kissing the top of my head and force feeding me! Maybe it's a good thing I didn't really eat this last week, I think I had six or seven full meals last night.
Harry growled. "You JUST saw her in HAWAII!!!"
That said, I realized that I never told you my side of the Dragon incident. As I was reading about your adventure smuggling Norberta out of the castle, you - much like in the Rita Skeeter version - more or less assumed that I was just trying to catch you in the act so that I could get you into trouble.
Good morning Love of my Life!
Eeek! We're going to be Godparents today (or tomorrow?)
Love you!
"Smart move young man," the repugnant voice of Aunt Marge stated from about three feet away where she was dancing with an older man wearing a colonel's uniform.
Your Harry - and Oliver
"But I
"Oh! In that case, here." I grabbed my guitar and started strumming so that I could sing my
We recommended the squib photographer to them, which Donna was highly interested in, especially once she had a chance to look through some of our photos from the shoot. Unsurprisingly, Eris got fed up about that point and loudly demanded that we go home and feed her. I *know* we'd brought milk with, but she seems to be very particular about where she'll eat - especially when she's tired. So we said our goodbyes and left.
So now, we're talking a group loo break before heading off to the next place. I've given up caring that a girl cast a glamour on (presumably) her boyfriend to sneak him into the loo with her. They are more than likely sharing the same stall at this very moment, but as I said, that's on them if they forget to cast the protection spells. Maybe one of the female chaperones in there will notice if the stall starts shaking rhythmically and put a stop to it.
We eventually made our way, just in time for our reservation, to Infinity Blue Restaurant for dinner. I have no idea what the rest of you ate, I was so focused on the unbelievably delicious lobster-pasta I ordered. That paired with my dry crisp white wine? Well, I'm glad you cast a muffliato on the table. I know you cast it in case one of the kids started talking about something muggles shouldn't hear, but the benefit for me was no one outside of our family hearing me make ridiculous yummy happy noises at my food.
Bletchley must have looked over at me and noticed that I was still rubbing my temples. "Roche, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the investigation from this point shift to trying to gathering evidence on the mum? If she tried to murder her son, then aren't we obligated to bring her to justice?"
And that's about the time Eris wanted you and I in the room instead of her loving-but-completely-unhelpful-in-a-birthing-room siblings.
Harry
Harry and Draco go to Paris and shop for *way* more clothes than Viona actually needs.
I mean, he's not wrong, but still!
Thus, don't worry, it won't be ME in any danger, but the undercover officer pretending to stalk us. The only thing I'll need to worry about is having permission from you to pretend to be an excellent boyfriend to Hannah - in public, so nothing too much, probably just snogging on occasion.
Hakuna Matata! It means no worries, for the rest of our days, it's our problem free, philosophy, hakuna matata!
Eeek! 100th chapter!
Your mum is so classy and such a perfect Grandmother. So tonight the Weasleys as well as Andi and Teddy are coming over for dinner and introducing Elena as family, and Elena will get her welcome from her other grandma.
Draco
Another thing I purchased during my retail therapy was a massive amount of movies. Both children's movies for Unity House (and our house) as well as movies intended for older audiences that we can watch together or with our circle some time.
First of all, Oi Fuck that guy!
Now, we all know our Morgana is quite demanding and knows exactly what she wants and wants it now! But she is almost never upset with her Daddy Ollie. I laughed a little as I walked in the door saying, "Well well well Miss Sass, why are you yelling at your Daddy hmm?" Only to get the rest of the way into the room to see our beautiful husband wasn't sitting on the ground to make playing with the toddlers easier, he was curled up crying. Those beautiful brown eyes, normally full of laughter, sometimes giving me that exasperated look, so often with the bedroom eyes ....
The Viper decided to lay down and sprawl out on the bed next to me - it's a big bed after all. I was sitting up and sipping on a cup of tea, so he was laying at a bit of an angle so that we could look at each other while we talked.
"Yes!" Neville practically gasped, jumping on the excuse. "Show me that!"
Unfortunately for poor Oliver, my stamina had other things in mind. There was NO WAY I was going to be able to finish so soon, and since we had all agreed to AVOID finishing in the area that could make babies (this time), I decided that 20 minutes and two more orgasms for him was enough for now. Stopping, I bit Oliver on the shoulder lightly before withdrawing.
Upon reflection, this might be why our kids and I have managed to survive all those teenaged years. By the time one kid has reached the teen years, I have a new one or three to focus on so that I don't go neurotic on the teens, and in the meantime, you definitely take over as the main parent, Harry (and Oliver, I think you actually seem to excel at the little stage, probably because you had littles and know what to do), and - Oh wow!
