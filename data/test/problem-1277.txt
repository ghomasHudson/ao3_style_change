He pulled the robes out of his wardrobe and eyed them critically. They would do. They were indeed made in support of SPEW. A few years back, SPEW had asked everyone to wear SPEW-supporting clothing on the day they would be trying to get a new law through the parliament. That was the year his mother had joined the board, so obviously Draco had needed to show himself in SPEW-supporting robes.
Cassie smiled. “Yeah, they were talking and forgot all about classes. McGonagall had to remind them of it. Papa was mortified.”
“The curse is smarter than that, madam. The only thing that would help, is a potion or spell that directly counters the curse. Reducing the symptoms won’t work, as the curse overrides all and every other spell or potion.”
Scorpius smiled, sharing a secretive look with Hermione, and then with Percy. “Thanks. That’s not important for this meeting, though, but yeah, thanks. Anyone else have something unrelated?”
“Girls, girls! Please. You sound awful,” Draco laughed. He thought of his mother, who was always so surprised at the way Draco treated his children. According to her, Draco was loving, open, yet strict. The children knew what he wanted and how to behave, but they weren’t as tightly reined as Draco used to be. Draco smiled inwardly. He hoped his mother was right; her description was exactly how he had always wanted to raise his children.
A wondered look took over Potter’s expression. “The Marauder’s Map. Of course. I’ll grab it right now.” He scurried into his bedroom and came back in two minutes with an old, scruffy piece of paper.
“You’re such a good friend,” the boy said sincerely. “Your looks are so bad, they make me appear better. Thanks for that.”
Draco had laughed at that. “No, I don’t think she does. Although I do have to watch that Matias-boy.”
The hunter shook his head again. “I’m sorry, I misheard the name. Still, I don’t think there have ever been any Milfoys walking this castle.”
Draco stared at the picture and rubbed his jaw in sympathy of Severus. It had probably been his own fault, but he still had to live with a lot of sadness.
“No, I think that’s just her character. It does explain why I understand her so well, though. Anyway. How are Scorpius and Phi? Please tell me they are all right. I need some good news.”
After dinner, they walked out of the restaurant and onto the street, which still hadn’t lost much of its activity. Their conversation was fun, Cassie and Phi stayed close and it felt comfortable.
Scorpius’s fist relaxed too suddenly to be natural, his face carefully void of any emotion. His jaw ticked, though, and his eyes showed such fierce anger as Draco hadn’t ever seen from him.
It was the right thing to say. Of course it was. Draco knew exactly how proud Ms. Euripideia was of her interior design work. She looked around her office, nodding shortly.
, he did make a snarky comment. It wasn’t meant as an insult, however! He liked the animal. It was clear in the tone of his voice, and the hippogriff must have known it. But Potter was a favourite of Hagrid, and hippogriffs sensed such partiality. And Draco was, obviously, not so dear to the Big Oaf. So, every tiny thing Draco would do that
The next few weeks were uneventful. Draco taught classes, had a few annoying dinners with Potter rattling next to him, and met up with Neville. He had settled into a rhythm. And now, he had his children in his living room for a calm evening with the family.
Grinning, Draco waved his wand so his Patronus faded away. “Though, nowadays, I think that my Patronus isn’t necessarily a doe because of you. It may be a doe because of Severus. I wanted to be like him, you know, only a bit better liked, if possible. I wanted to be as brave as he was, with being a double spy. I thought he was the bravest man on Earth for admitting his mistake as a Death Eater, and trying to make up for it in the second war. He was, in some ways, my role model.”
is not something we can eradicate. We will make them stop assaulting me, but we can’t stop them entirely. There is too much hate towards Death Eaters still. The war is too fresh.”
“That means papa must have notes somewhere!” James exclaimed to the empty hallway. Gathering his parchment and his coat, he ran outside, ignoring the calls from classmates, in the direction of Hogsmeade. There, he Apparated to where he knew he would find what he needed.
“In fourth year we had another one, Draco, do that one. Do Chiquitita, it’s a fun one,” Blaise added. Draco shook his head.
Draco seemed confused for a second, before a wicked smirk slid over his face. “Well, I said a lot of things, didn’t I?” He put the bowl down next to him and folded his hands. Potter recognised it as the movement he used to mask his nerves.
Helloooooo. This is an additional chapter for mora, because she was having a tough week. And because I wanted to write some more. Whoops. It was supposed to be the fluffiest, sweetest chapter of papa!Draco and children, but it turned a bit heavier than I expected. It was also supposed to be 2000 words, as a short extra chapter. But now it's a full chapter. So it's not really additional anymore, it's just a chapter.
Draco cleared his throat. “Quiet down. Lazarus, I would like you to remain silent. Five points from Ravenclaw for disrupting class. If you are set on insulting me, please don’t hesitate to do so. After class. This lesson, we will talk about –“
“Last night she dreamt of an older boy, about a decade older than the dream I just told you about. She said the boy was first writhing on the ground from pain, like in other dreams of hers. Then, the dream changed to a picture of this boy sitting in his bedroom again, but he was bound to the wall with his arms tugging on chains and his head lolling on the wall. His face was splotchy, his muscles sore from the torture he just had to endure, and he couldn’t make other noises than soft whimpers. She thought it was because he had been screaming for days on end. With every breath, a wheezing sound came from him. He hadn’t eaten since before the torture, which had been so long ago. Every day, someone would come by to make sure he was still bound, and give him something to drink.”
James nodded. “All right then. Take the feathers off, Mr. Malfoy and pour them into the potion. I need to check the book for a second.”
The twine tightened around his wrist, making him wince. Cassie tutted, muttering disapprovingly at the plant. “Now, now, Isabella, he doesn’t mean to insult you. He doesn’t know any better.”
Pansy, Greg, Blaise and Theo all perked up at the mention of Draco performing. Theo quickly reminded Draco that he couldn’t refuse, since it was a dare, and Greg requested
“There is someone dying to talk to you. I won’t hold you up any longer,” she whispered, nodding at Potter, who was staring unabashedly at them.
“Yes, you are. It’s high time you got some decent clothing, even if you’ll never wear it. And really, Potter, what do you think will happen if anyone sees me wearing those robes in the future?”
“Shouldn’t you be a bit kinder about your papa? You never know, he could be standing behind you when you say such things,” Potter teased, making Cassie laugh confidently.
Draco looked at Greg before nodding, to make sure that his friend really was all right with the way this evening was going to go, and dropped the Veritaserum on his tongue.
“That should be Terence and Priscus, third-years. They hate Slytherins, but aren’t strong enough to bully anyone other than first-years. They’re in their dorm. I can get them for you? Or I could give you passageway to go to their dorms yourself. They really need someone calling them out. You’re the first professor who has ever found out about it.”
“Oh, of course! I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean anything with it. He’s good with nightmares, though, isn’t he?”
“You are very right, Professor McGonagall. Trust me to give Priscus a good talking to at home. I must say, I am appalled. He will know just what the consequences are of something like this. But tell me, did he actually scar another student?”
Draco frowned. “Who gave you that permission? I would have remembered if I would have said such a thing.”
Draco had sat through his trial with burning nerves. Potter had been speaking in his favour, had been trying to get Draco out. Potter had saved him, again. If only the boy had any idea what that meant to him.
“Besides, this is not important now,” Scorpius added. “We are supposed to be making a plan for tonight. Can we just get to business?”
allowed to come to Hogsmeade. She and Ron have been bonding with inventing the most ridiculous props,” George continued the update of the Malfoy children.
Passing by Scorpius and Cassie, Draco lightly placed his hand on Albus’s shoulder and squeezed before letting go and moving on. Having taken his seat –next to Potter, of course– he saw Albus questioning Scorpius confusedly.
“But never are you allowed to morph into him of all people. He was a bad man, a very bad man. Never can you say anything in his favour, or draw him, or picture him in any way. That was very bad of you, and I am angry at you for doing it. I understand, but I am still angry.”
“So, you’re friends with Longbottom and Potter, now?” Blaise asked, not unfriendly, but also unsure what he should think of it.
“Hold on two seconds,” Potter called to the children that were walking in front of him. He excused himself to run in one of the side streets they had just passed and came back a few minutes later with a red and yellow beanie, with the tag still on it.
Ignoring Draco’s looks, Pansy turned to look at Potter and said, “Back in our Hogwarts days, many of us had nightmares. Especially in sixth and seventh year. He helped us every single night. In seventh year, he didn’t even sleep at all anymore, just because he wanted to be sure the rest of us were alright.”
Locking the office behind her again, Ms. Euripideia turned left, following the witch. Draco felt a light tug on his arm as he went out of the Department.
“Give me an honest answer on this question. Is the one responsible for this, the woman I think it is?”
question my sanity, because there is nothing wrong with that. Now, listen. Do you see this Mark?” Draco rolled up his sleeve and stuck out his arm for the Healer to see. He saw that the Healer became uncomfortable, but he continued.
He stood up and moved to the wing where all the bedrooms were. He met Cass and Harky in Cassie’s room, as expected.
anything, but Dad loves you and you love him, so you should tell him everything. You are practically a married couple.”
While Scorpius and Aquila twirled back onto the middle of the dancefloor, Draco and Potter came closer. With a swoop that left Potter on the side lines, Lily was whisked away, carefully being taught how to do the simple waltzing movements. Albus took a few breaths, being encouraged by Potter standing next to him, and went up to Manila.
Draco was on a roll, and he wasn’t to be stopped. Neville just listened and nodded at the right moments.
The Malfoy children stiffened slightly at James’s suggestions, exchanging glances to establish a safety net for when Draco would fall out.
“I don’t like him that way, Astoria. I don’t want a relationship with him, for these exact reasons. And most of all, I don’t appreciate your implications.”
Papa opened his mouth, but didn’t seem to be able to swallow. James looked around the room to find something that could help. His eyes lit up when he saw the baby cup on the table in the corner, with a lid and a small hole for a straw. He pushed the feather trunk through, poured the potion into the cup and held it to papa’s lips again.
Draco raised an eyebrow, setting the Pomegranate juice on low heat in the cauldron and working on the daisy roots. “We were both without a date, and it seemed like a good idea to project House Unity.”
“Sounds like we need tea, chocolate and blankets. Come on, let’s make ourselves comfortable until we hear something from Draco.”
“They were on the same side, and I knew so much, that I had to be protected – along with the information I had. Also, Mother forced him to take an Unbreakable Vow to protect me.”
“There is a backstory to it. All right, see, I’m an odd person, as I’m sure you know, and I have some odd interests. I’ve always rather liked animals, no matter what I tell my children –“
“In your positions,” McGonagall called. Draco braced himself and raised his wand arm above his head. The first Jellylegs jinx was flying before he could think of his own attack, but his reflexes were quick enough to cast a Shield.
Draco took a careful sip, while looking straight at Neville. The latter just broadened his grin and winked again. Swallowing, Draco noticed a different taste in his drink and frowned suspiciously.
Draco shrugged. “I must say, Potter does fail spectacularly at this whole thing. I’m not sure whether I would like to be in any kind of relationship with such an inconsiderate man.”
At least, it was wonderful to Potter. He still didn’t know exactly what the point of the story had been, but he felt elated just watching Draco’s Patronus unfold.
The look on Keira’s face told Potter that he should let go and get a bit of distance between him and the students. He sent them one foul look and strode back to the Great Hall. He was looking for Scorpius or Cassie or Aquila, but they had all left. The chattering subsided when he walked in. Albus sent him a grateful look and a thumbs up, but that was all the response he got.
Only when he told his children that he would be gone that evening, and asked Phi if he would be all right to sleep in Scorpius’s bed, Cassie reminded him that he had robes, made especially for the support of SPEW.
Draco nodded. “The Healers have faith in it.” He looked at Albus, observing the way he looked at Scorpius and worried his lower lip.
“That’s just it, isn’t it?” Potter asked, keeping his eyes on Draco. “They aren’t dreams. All this actually happened, didn’t it?”
He shook his head in defeat. He should try to sleep, or at least, get some rest. In a week, he would go to trial, and he needed to be prepared.
“Why have you taken the chocolate away from me, but keep feeding me it? That isn’t how rationing works, Potter.”
“No, no. Never mind. I can see I was wrong in asking you this. I’ll think of something else then. Sorry for bothering you.”
Harry cracked a smile. “Well, I always knew Slytherins were weak, but I thought my Gryffindor influence would have stopped you from giving up.”
James crossed his arms, opening his mouth to start defending himself, but was stood gaping when he realised what Draco just said. “You knew about them?
“Because my parents have divorced, and my grandmother lives in France. Even though I speak French perfectly, I am not willing to live so far away from my family.”
“I made such a huge mistake, papa. I thought I was going to protect you, but then they started asking all these things of me, and I only wanted to defend you!”
“People hate me for this, and I can’t blame them. However, today, and with the trials I just went through, there seems to be a target on my back. Someone attacked me with a curse that is extremely Dark and not very well-known. There is no countercurse, counterpotion or counterspell for it. There is nothing you can do.”
“Yes, he does,” Potter started uncertainly. “He helps me when I have nightmares, so he knows how I take my drinks.” His voice was careful, as if he wasn’t sure whether he could trust the Slytherins with this information. He also looked at Draco with something of confusion, probably wondering why Draco hadn’t shared this weakness yet.
At Potter’s puzzled face, Phi cut in to explain that it was a type of blue that could even be seen as grey, in the right lighting. “It compliments his eyes, or so he says.”
“That’s all the information I could find about family May. There are no records of any child of Rissa’s father’s age with the name May, so I took it a step further and assumed that they may have hid the kid, like pureblood families do when…” He raised his eyebrows at Draco for him to fill in the blanks.
“That’s because you were only a first year. They leave off the first years. Usually,” Scorp smirked with a side glance to his father. Draco raised an eyebrow in challenge, which only made his son snicker.
“He has trouble containing his magic,” Scorpius explained. “We are trying to shield him, at least so he doesn’t harm himself.”
Draco nodded then. “Will you be staying here during our little, very spontaneous talk?” He noticed he could still use sarcasm, so his children hadn’t used an enormous amount of Veritaserum. That was a plus. He would probably also be able to stop himself from babbling.
Draco swallowed. “No. But I constantly carry the DNA of someone who can.” He tried to catch Potter’s eyes, but they were firmly set on his arm, and where the vague lines seemed to become more pronounced.
“Please. If papa walks in, I’d know, because whatever room he enters, gets this entirely different atmosphere. Usually because people gossip about him, or because he’s well-dressed,” she pondered.
“I don’t know, we haven’t tested that yet. But I think it makes the plants stronger, and therefore, one needs less of the plant to have a working potion.”
His Mother hadn’t mentioned it yet, but soon enough she would understand just why Draco had stopped talking about Potter in his letters. On the evening of the SPEW event, she had asked for Potter’s favourite chocolate flavours, which was as good of a blessing Draco could get.
Draco was packing his trunk. Well, he was laying out clothes and stuff which the house-elves could put in his trunk. It wasn’t difficult. He knew which robes to take with him, and he didn’t need much else. When his soft socks fell off the bed, he knelt down to retrieve them. They had rolled away, and were now resting against a dark, wooden box. Draco gulped. If he went to Hogwarts and left the box under his bed, the house-elves were destined to find it. And they would give it to his father. And his father would know what was in it. And Draco would be in danger of a major punishment.
, the duel. The potion in that letter of yours, which made you so angry during the battle, isn’t widely available or easy to brew. Scorpius being beaten, Lazarus, Terence and Priscus. Theresa. Phi having such difficulty with his Animagus magic. Now that I think of it, Phi being an Animagus is strange anyways. We have an explanation now, but it’s still highly unlikely.”
Potter chuckled. “Actually, I was about to ask you how you were, but if you’re going to be acting like this, I’ll just not care.”
“So, papa doesn’t have that. Papa has never fallen for the saviour business, even though he was jealous and he loves Harry’s selflessness. But he isn’t one of the Swoon victims. However, there is the Harry Potter effect. This is the effect of Harry Potter on papa. The effect is that every emotion papa feels, is amplified, be it anger of happiness.”
“And you said the lands along the South Coast was where the herbs come from? What do you use the herbs for?”
Potter clenched his fist tightly. Draco only responded by covering every emotion he felt with a solid Malfoy mask, one as unreadable as he hadn’t used with Potter since the very first day back at Hogwarts this year.
“Pansy? Who are you talking to? I thought Blaise couldn’t – Potter!” Draco smiled widely. “Hi. Is the tea still fresh?”
“Enhancers are usually the most expensive, addictive, unattainable and difficult ingredients in a potion. Without these enhancers, many potions will lose their addictiveness, and some may even become legal, because the enhancers are the bits that are illegal to obtain, grow or use.”
“Hurry up, the Portkey’s activated in twenty minutes!” Potter called, sending the dishes to the kitchen for Kreacher.
During dinner, Scorpius and Aquila unwrapped their presents. Cassie had given Scorpius the faulty Prophecy Ball they had seen in Hogsmeade some months back, when the children had met George and Ron. Aquila had gotten a sweet necklace from her in which she could put a picture. Phi gave them both something from the Wheezes shop. Draco gave Aquila a signed copy of
At the moment, he was in his office to do some work, albeit slower than usual because he got distracted with every creak of the door. When finally the door fully opened, it wasn't Potter, like Draco had hoped.
“Except that Draco has always had a relatively good relationship with the kitchen elves. They have probably taken care of him.”
Pushing Potter softly, Draco nodded. “The beach it is. I can Apparate us to one of the Malfoy estates in Cornwall. The grounds there include some lovely cliffs and sand beaches. If you want.”
Draco chuckled. “That’s true. Apparently, it’s not just the Malfoy bloodline that people like to assault.”
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell us. You’ve always said that we shouldn’t keep secrets, because it would come back to haunt us later in life.”
Scorpius looked around with an expectant look on his face. “Say whatever you think is important. Aquila is our secretary. Shoot,” he ordered while sitting down. It stayed silent for a while, until slowly the ideas came trickling in. A grin spread over Scorpius’s face as he listened to all the ideas and caught Albus’s gaze. This was going very well.
“And half-way sixth year, it got bad. No one really slept anymore. So we all had our mattresses and pillows on the floor in the common room. It was one massive bedroom for everyone. Draco moved around and calmed people before the nightmare woke them up. He didn’t care for his own sleep,” Pansy continued softly, flicking her gaze between Potter and Draco.
Draco had no idea that his children knew about this hoodie; he had always been careful to only wear it when his children were, supposedly, sleeping and Astoria was out (or after they were divorced). There was a permanent Glamour on the hoodie, which would ensure that everyone saw a simple yet classy cardigan.
last year, your youngest son, Ophiuchus Sirius Malfoy, Metamorphmagus, morphed into Voldemort. Do you deny this?”
Mr. Malfoy, however, is heir of the Malfoy line, a pureblood family that goes centuries back. His father, Lucius Malfoy, has been supportive of You-Know-Who ever since the First Wizarding War. Not only was he supportive, he was You-Know-Who’s most loyal servant. In the Second Wizarding War, he housed the man and hosted several meetings. He also led many raids, killings and other Dark activities. Lucius Malfoy has received high fines as punishment, but never anything else.
“Right. So Harry, you know about the Wolfsbane I keep in my storage?” Draco started, focussing solely on Harry instead of on all of them. “In the beginning of the year, when I was experimenting with Neville’s plants, you asked why I had Wolfsbane in such large quantities. I told you there was a student with Lycanthropy.”
Letting go of Peanut’s skeletal head, Draco turned around to shoot Harry a scorching glare. “I want you to know that I am very capable with hippogriffs. But they are intelligent and know exactly who is liked or disliked by their owners. Hagrid always had a preference for you, and Buckbeak noticed your dislike for me. He decided to take that as an excuse to take my
Scorpius looked around at the audience. People was hanging on his every word, listening with awe to what he had to say.
He sat down on the divan and placed the box gently on the coffee table in front of him. He stroked the wood, along the edges and over the lid. He daren’t touch the snake. He remembered how, as a small child, he wished to meet someone who was a Parselmouth. He shuddered now, as a young man, to remember the man he knew who could speak Parseltongue.
“Many of these are charmed,” he whispered, sneakily resting a hand on the small of Draco’s back. “You should never take a flavour that’s placed between two blue bags. Those are charmed to grow elephant’s ears, which will only disappear after twenty-four hours. Also, the upper two of every flavour are charmed to grow a pig’s tail. Apart from that, there is a pattern which bags are charmed and which aren’t. Some have the same effect as Pepper Breath, others taste like you swallowed a pound of goose feathers.”
“Oh papa, I also wanted to ask… At the beginning of the year, you said you would arrange a dress for the ball for me, right? But when is that ball, because I thought it would be around Christmas,” Cassie complained.
After dinner, when most of the students had left already, Potter smirked at Draco and quietly asked whether he was dressed warm enough.
Draco slid on the ground between Harry’s legs, leaning against his knees while Harry played with his hair.
Potter’s eyes took on the blazing fire Draco recognised from whenever Potter was determined but there was an annoying obstacle in his way. “Auror Whithal, I command you –“
Harry smiled. “Can we? Yay, I like that. Okay, so, yesterday we went to the beach. It was really beautiful, we had a lovely meal –“
It was a week later, and Malfoy had lost all capability of speaking for longer periods. He could answer simple questions in monosyllables, but everything more than that took too much energy and resulted in sudden naps or heart failure. At least, that is what the Healers told Harry right before he entered the room.
“Will do. There is something I need to talk to you about, tonight. Can you cook and talk at the same time?”
“Mother…” he started hesitantly. “Since you are in the board of S.P.E.W., have you had any contact with the Minister?”
Scorpius just remained calm and smacked his hand on the table a few times to get the attention back.
Neville’s face brightened. “Oh, it’s nothing much. It’s inspired by a Muggle experiment, where plants are given different amounts of daylight, and their productivity is measured. I give magical plants different surroundings, different amounts of magic in their vicinity, and measure their productivity. It’s odd that this kind of research has never been done before. Many plants have already shown greater productivity, when the amount of magic is correctly adapted. Take Devil’s Snare, for example. It is much less susceptible to sunlight, when they are raised with only half of the natural amount of magic around Hogwarts.”
When Potter arrived at the door to his apartment, he saw a book lying on the doormat. Picking it up, his smile widened. Sneaky bastards, those Malfoys actually were.
Whithal then stood, arms crossed and a pensive expression. “Mr. Longbottom. Neville. You have known Mr. Malfoy as a friend for less than a year, correct?”
The smirk on Whithal’s face was wicked enough that Draco knew what he was going to say before he said it.
“I’ll call in sick, and either sit in the audience or be an official witness for your barrister. I know how trials work, even the Red Cases. I’ve had a few of them myself. I can help you, Mr. Malfoy.”
The chairman of the Wizengamot gestured to the scribe, who started to explain how the rest of the trial was going to be. The audience was now allowed to speak. There was a dozen that came to the stand and began to tell Draco how much they hated him, and how he had ruined their lives. After those few angry people had gotten their say, the noise and yells mellowed down. The chairman shortly explained how the Wizengamot was going to vote, and then called for everyone to raise their hand if they thought Draco was guilty.
Draco turned his head and raised his arm to beckon his daughter closer. “Cassie, love. So glad you’re here. How’s school?”
Shrugging, Potter tried to get his hand back, but Draco held it in a tight hold. When he finally looked up at Potter, there was an undeniably fond look on his face and his smirk was warm. He tucked the loose strands of hair that had fallen in front of his eyes behind his ear and looked away.
Her voice turned low, threatening. “And that is more than we can say for you. You act like you have never done something wrong! But we all know that you have made mistakes as well. Horrible mistakes that have hurt people.” With a piercing gaze, she added, “The scars of your mistake used to terrify me.”
“Then you’ll have gotten a lot of experience in working with difficult potions. Nothing lost. So, what do you say?”
“That is impossible. I would have heard about it before, if that was true!” he exclaimed. McGonagall shushed him.
A small twitch in Malfoy’s fingers, resulting in their hands being almost linked, but not quite. Harry moved his hand to close the gap between them. He suddenly remembered a similar situation during Christmas, when Malfoy had been deadly afraid of doing something wrong, but still intertwined the tips of their fingers on the couch with the Weasleys.
They kept talking about all seven children, the small things of Hogwarts’s life and George’s shop. When Smiths announced that they had really taken their time, but Draco was supposed to be back in his cell before the Aurors came to talk to him, George gave him a short goodbye and left the room, allowing Potter and Draco to have a bit of privacy.
When Cassie had gone to bed and Neville had closed off the greenhouses, Draco went to his room, where he put Phi to bed and read him a bedtime story. After their sleep ritual, Draco poured himself a cup of tea and sat down to read the Daily Prophet. He hadn’t been able to read it this morning, since he had had to go to McGonagall’s office for her message about the Ravenclaw boys. Draco grinned. All in all, he was quite proud of establishing their expulsion, even if it was with Potter’s help. It was a step in the right direction for Draco. It also showed his good intentions, that he had the same opinion as Potter in this matter.
And after dinner, it had been a fleeting thought through his head. It was so fleeting, that he almost didn’t realise what he had thought. Almost. He had, unfortunately, and so, he found himself in his room. He stood at the side of his bed, contemplating whether he should do it. His father had almost found him fondling an article, last time Draco had opened the box. That was almost a year ago. Draco felt the fear creep through him. Ever since his mother had told him the full story, he had been afraid to touch the box. He had only done it twice. Once the day after she had told him, and once two weeks later.
On his first check-up round, he saw Lucy Weasley have a lot of trouble with cutting the beans. Her partner was stirring the bubbling liquid in their cauldron and couldn’t help her. Draco walked up to their work table. Lucy visibly startled at his appearance.
“Tomorrow, you will tell us everything, young man,” his mother chastised softly. “No more secrets. We will fix this. Together.”
In seventh year, I had given up on myself and on the chance of doing something good. The Golden Trio were out horcrux-hunting and the Death Eaters had taken over Hogwarts. Severus was Headmaster, while the Carrows made sure everyone followed the rules. I had shut down all capability of caring for anyone but my friends. It worked, to a certain extent. Until a fellow Slytherin, a first-year, committed suicide and blamed me for making her feel so bad. It ruined me, finding her body on the shore of the Great Lake.
“No. Of course they lost their brother, their son as well, but not in the way you felt it. They can’t expect you to deal with it the same way as they do. Every time you look in the mirror, you see yourself, instead of Fred next to you. You are allowed to grieve, to mourn, every second of the day. You are allowed to carry that pain on the surface until you die.”
“So papa wanted to name one of us after you, as well. He couldn’t do that with Aquila, because my mother insisted on something else. She refused to call me Andromeda anyway. So papa came up with Cassiopeia. Because she was the mother of Andromeda. He always told me it was a way to include you in our family, even if you couldn’t really be with us.”
Pansy interrupted softly. “Harry,” she said. Potter turned to look at her with the familiar fire in his eyes.
Draco swallowed. When he chanced a look at Potter, the latter was already watching him, and waved when they locked eyes. He heard a snicker from his left, where Phi was smirking up at him, being seated at the Gryffindor table.
Potter sat up sheepishly, biting his lip while staring at Draco. “Your father is still insufferable, Malfoy,” he mumbled.
Draco wondered who had taken the picture. He had even forgotten how he got it in his possession. It was not from
Draco managed to pick up Phi and smother him with snow, after which he twirled around to let Lily catch Cassie’s snow ball. Cassie cried out indignantly, charming a heap of snow to hit Draco, but he ducked away. James’s snow ball was still following him, but had crashed into the Cassie’s snow heap. One concern less.
Draco had always loved to sing, as was evident by his way of cheering up his fellow Slytherins during the war. When his children were born, he always sang for them, to calm them down, get them to sleep or just because.
“Merlin,” Draco uttered, while rushing to the sofa to wake Potter. When he checked the bedroom, Phi was gone. He was probably already in the Great Hall. Salazar, he would have seen Draco and Potter sleeping on the sofa!
“Is something wrong, Cassie?” Draco questioned, sitting next to her. Cassie turned away from him, pointing aggressively at her hair.
He should stop expecting Cassie when it came to being awoken at night. This time, as well as many other times, it wasn’t his daughter. Of course it wasn’t.
Punching Potter in the arm, Pansy picked up one of the plates and gave it to Potter for examination. “Harry. Darling. Do you, by any chance, know of one adult and three children that Draco would like to see as his family?”
A chorus of yesses were heard in the car while Draco parked it. He turned around and smiled at his little family. “This is going to be fun,” he heard Aquila whisper to Scorpius. It didn’t sound sarcastic, though, so he took it as a compliment.
“Hm. We’ll find out, I guess. I’m sorry for him. Jamie’s such a sweet lad, I don’t want to see him get hurt.”
“Although I fully agree with anyone calling a Malfoy an idiot, I am, however, wondering why one Malfoy would say it about another,” Potter’s voice suddenly sounded from behind them.
. From then, Potter and Draco had been on the receiving end of many curious looks. Luckily, Potter understood that it wasn’t in their best interest to start talking, so the both of them remained quiet for the entirety of the meal. Classes were highly awkward, especially those with Potter and Weasley spawn. Lunch was… Well.
It had been a good call, to inform their friends of it, since the article that was published, occupied two pages, including pictures.
There, his peaceful state was rudely interrupted by a crying Slytherin first-year. Cassie had ushered her to a corner of the common room, and was softly talking to her. Draco frowned and looked around to see whether he could find some sign of what happened. He only saw dripping wet clothes and drops of water falling from the victim’s hair.
“Her name is Suzanne. She is so smart, she helps everyone with their homework! And she’s pretty, right? I really like talking to her, because she is very funny, but can also be serious when necessary,” he vented suddenly.
The Healer shook his head resolutely. “No way. No unknown potions or spells are allowed. Especially none that are brought by visitors. Who knows what the result is!”
There's an overkill of the word 'just' in this chapter, whoops. I didn't feel like editing. I never do.
“I will,” she answered, with a smile that informed Draco that she knew she had already affirmed her position as his apprentice.
Draco shrugged. “Flea market,” he chuckled. “Somewhere around Diagon Alley, there’s this tiny little alley leading to a grand courtyard with a few high-end restaurants and the flea market I bought it.”
Scorpius stared at the wall with their family tree on it – a new one, where every scorch mark was replaced with a picture and a name of their family members. A restored one.
Theresa hid her confusion almost as soon as it hit her, but Draco saw that first unguarded second when it flitted over her face. He sighed inwardly. Of course it would take everyone a lot of time to get used to Draco and Potter not talking anymore. Draco would have to up his game, if he wanted people to know they weren’t interacting at all.
“Merlin – No, Potter, not like that. Stop your gay thinking right this second. Blaise is as straight as they get. So is Nott, come to think of it. They work together. Work partners. Colleagues, but always together on a case? You know, partners.”
When they turned a corner, Potter nudged Draco and pointed a few ten metres away. Draco’s mouth fell open, seeing the London Eye in all its wonderful, brightly lit glory.
Draco trudged a bit behind them, enjoying the wild diversity of items. At a certain point, Potter slowed down to join him, while both kept an eye on their children.
“Welcome, Mr. Malfoy. Ms. Euripideia is waiting for you,” a young ginger wizard told him, pointing towards where Draco knew Euripideia’s office was.
Draco slowly stirred the potion while Theresa added another ingredient. After a couple minutes of working in silence, James sighed.
Draco smiled, trying to suppress his laughter. “All right, all right, settle down, you monsters. I can see it’s snowing, it’s very pretty. But we won’t have a snow fight today.”
He only just heard Scorpius chuckle, assure him that he wouldn’t, and felt the kiss on his cheek, before he slipped away.
It was Draco’s turn to roll his eyes, and he offered his son a few sips of water when the coughing had subsided.
Potter laughed, throwing the spoon in the sink and lowering the fire beneath the chocolate. “White and milk chocolate, mixed with a bit of caramel and some herbs. It’s especially good with the ice cream I bought.”
Something that made him feel guilty? Something he had done wrong and tried to right again? That sounded more like papa. That sounded – plausible, actually.
Potter ripped apart the paper, uncovering five beautiful picture frames, including pictures. The upper one was a picture of Potter’s children, all three of them smiling at the camera and sticking out their tongues.
“He will be kept unconscious for a while. The rib we weren’t able to heal yet will take approximately five days to be healed, and by that time, his nose and other rib will be completely back to normal again. I would even go as far as saying that he will only feel some sensitivity in those areas by that time. However, blood replenishing potions don’t work very fast and can’t be used as often as one would look. That will be the longest part of his recovery. After a week, we can think about taking your son off the sedatives and letting him wake up.”
Draco let this sink into Potter’s brain. When he saw his face twist into something confused and disagreeing, Draco knew he could continue.
Kingsley nodded. He cast an Accio of wooden boxes, after which two large boxes zoomed their way. Kingsley and Draco both caught one. The one Kingsley opened appeared to be the correct one. Carefully digging through very old papers and photographs, Draco finally found the one he was looking for.
, or however that idiot it called. You know, the one with the less-than-flattering articles about you. How about that?”
Thinking back at the trials, Draco remembered the other words his mother had spoken. And at once, Draco knew who had taken the picture. It must have been –
George nodded like he had expected that, which probably was the truth. “How come she sees what happened to you? Is she a Seer?”
“We just thought it was a fun thing leading nowhere. When we got through, we were suddenly faced with thestrals that ran away from us immediately. We were curious.”
“No. Absolutely not,” Draco answered vehemently. “Severus was a very meticulous cleaner. His cauldrons were always clean. It was sort of his therapy when he was angry or sad.”
The small voice in his head stops insulting him. It finally seems to be happy with the decisions Draco makes. It isn’t judging and confusing him anymore.
He gave Albus some time to gather his thoughts while he opened the vial. It was a strong tincture made of thestral hair and phoenix tears, a deadly combination in the wrong proportions, but very effective against injuries made by Merpeople. It’s one of Draco’s own inventions.
to stay with him until he wakes up and bother everyone in St. Mungo’s for their reassurance. But I also want the others to be all right and stay calm. If they start panicking or crying, I would break down myself. So it’s a bit of a dilemma.”
His children had noticed something was off ever since Draco had returned from Ms. Euripideia’s office. Or Cassie may have told them that he had retched two days’ worth of meals out after reading a particular letter. Anyway, they kept shooting him worried glances. Harry, too, treated him like porcelain. They hadn’t spoken about the name –
There was a challenge in his tone, a dare for McGonagall to ever underestimate him again. He wasn’t the stuck-up, arrogant boy he used to be. He was an adult now, and he would like to be treated as such. Better still, he would like to be treated and trusted as a Professor and Potions Master.
“Besides, I think the papers have been suspiciously quiet on their friendship and on papa’s work here. We should wait and see what they’re saying, before we jump in and recklessly ruin whatever papa has built up for himself,” Scorpius said wisely.
Standing up to be as hospitable as possible, Draco waved his wand so that the kettle in the back of his office would start boiling water. Cassie smirked.
Mr. Malfoy cursed when he cut himself with the knife he was holding, but managed to get the Maw into the potion in time. As Bill was stressing about the bleeding finger, Mr. Malfoy snapped at him to keep his mouth shut and continue on cutting the Devil’s Snare.
“All right. Okay, yes, okay. Sit down, please. ‘Bout five years ago, a movement came up, very hush-hush and very much in secret. Aim was to ‘ensure justice to victimised families.’ They stole money and houses from Death Eaters, gave them to those families that lost stuff. Last few years, it got worse. Started killing Death Eaters, got sneakier in assaulting them and finding them. I’ve always been high on the list of Death Eaters that had to be paid back, preferably in the worst possible way.”
“I didn’t see the point. Come on, Scorp, the longer we stand here doing nothing, the bigger the chance we’ll get caught. So, we go in, we find Albus and we head further to where Aquila and papa are. Then we observe before we do something stupid. Right?”
“Cassiopeia, that’s enough.” Frowning, Draco sat down and placed the five coats and backpack on the empty chair next to Aquila. “I don’t want you saying things like that.”
After crossing the entirety of the city and entering the more industrial, empty lots, the eagle landed on a branch right in front of a big warehouse. Windows had been broken and were fixed with magic, Scorpius could feel it. The eagle cried softly.
“They’re playing,” she mouthed silently. “Not going to kill her. Or papa. They only want to push their boundaries. Keep calm.”
“Auror Smiths. How did you decide that you wanted to testify at this trial?” Doctor Selaminder asked.
“During the war, seventh year, she was only a second year. She was really young, a bit naïve and gullible. Silent as well, never one to draw attention. During that time all Slytherins slept in the common room, she did too. She was in the corner furthest away from the fire, because she loved to use her knitted blanket. One night, she had a nightmare. Draco rushed over to her, calmed her, made sure she would wake up. When she did, she let out a relieved sigh and buried her face in Draco’s shirt to mask her crying. It took a while before she was able to speak again and Draco could ask her what the nightmare had been about.”
“Sorry, Greg, I forgot about the betting thing. You’re doing well, though, refusing the money like that. I’m proud of you.”
Cassie grinned at Draco’s miffed look. Sitting opposite of him, she leant forward to pick a small piece of the white chocolate covered cake and ate it, making a show of enjoying it. Draco narrowed his eyes at her playfully.
“I can’t remember,” Draco answered. He saw Potter in the audience, gnashing his teeth and tapping his foot nervously.
“Yeah, but Aquila was sweet enough to teach me how to make a Patronus and how to get it to talk. Did you know I have an owl as my Patronus? How cool is that!”
Clearly hesitating, Scorpius stalled until Cassie nodded at him. Immediately after they had all lowered their wands, a blast of magic sprang free, blowing Phi against the wall. He quickly scrambled back up, towards James to speak to him in soothing tones.
“Or are you one of those saps that think the way you start the New Year is how you will spend it?” Albus continued.
“As I said, with this kind, one’ll have more control during the full moon. Regular Wolfsbane will prevent one from preying after humans, but one’ll still need to hunt. My Wolfsbane inhibits the urge to hunt, and allows one to whine somewhere safe, without needing to shed blood.”
Back at Hogwarts, each was surprised to see the hallways full of students, even if it was past curfew and a stressful time for most of them. Potter spotted Neville, looking dishevelled and tired.
“Trust me, it is easier than it looks. It’s not like he had an inbred dislike for Potters. It’s just a very strong one against one specific Potter,” Scorpius interrupted. It was rather amusing to see how he and his children could joke around his Potter-phobia, while Draco was unable to actually talk to the man.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Demanding, are we?” he mumbled, lifting the age barrier from the fireplace, so that his children could arrange the call.
When their trials were over, his parents were brought away, through a door that let them to Azkaban. His mother was allowed to say goodbye to Draco for a moment. She held his hand and smiled softly up to him, sitting a bit higher than where she stood. “Draco, love. You are so much like Sirius Black. You just had less chances. Forgive me for that.”
“I haven’t. I told her that they were just dreams, and that those thoughts were nothing to worry about, as long as she doesn’t mean them. She assured me she didn’t, and I am quite sure I have never uttered a bad word about Muggleborns during the last twenty years.”
I'm afraid this chapter isn't written as good as the first. I'm sorry, I guess my head wasn't in the game. I'll try better for the next one!
“Yes, indeed,” Scorpius said to take control of the conversation again. “It’s true, a few months back, papa wasn’t all that bothered by the consequences. Since then, however, an incident here and there made him realise what kind of major wall stood between them.”
Narcissa laughed. “Naturally. Your father is occupying the library, but I think he won’t mind, as long as you don’t distract him.”
When they escaped the dungeons, most of them didn’t realise what it meant. They wouldn’t accept to be sent away, they’re Slytherins, for heaven’s sake! So they broke free from the dungeons and ran towards the fight. Only there did they realise that Professor McGonagall might have sent them away for their own good. Behind the Dark Lord were their families. Their parents. Watching them, begging them to join. Most Slytherins disappeared to who knows where. Draco didn’t know what to do. He wouldn’t join his parents, that much was obvious. No matter how his mother pleaded. He couldn’t do it. His father would be furious, of course, but frankly, he couldn’t look him in the eye and see the honourable man he once was. So he stood still and looked anywhere but at his parents. His eyes slid to the body in Hagrid’s arms. It seemed that Potter was dead.
! And what about Aquila? She would be devastated! She is already nervous and on the verge of a breakdown. If he won’t be the boy he used to be, I’m not sure she can cope. She needs her brother, Potter, more than Cassie or Phi need Scorpius. She can’t be on her own, all of a sudden, she needs to be part of a twin!”
What a great prospect for the day. Grumpy by his conversation with Astoria and the realisation of not having a free afternoon, Draco stomped to his classroom to wait for his students.
They remained silent for a long while, until Draco narrowed his eyes and cocked his head. “Since when are you allowed to call Potter by his first name?”
“Dad, when do we have that Defense test again? Shania said it was next week, but I thought it was in two weeks,” she asked. “And if it’s next week, I’m behind on planning, and my grade will drop.”
Immediately, Potter made Draco sit down in Potter’s former chair, which had a marginally better view at the screen. “Be silent and watch,” Potter ordered. He disappeared to later come back with a kettle of tea and enough mugs for everyone, handing Draco the one in which he had had his hot chocolate and the tea of that morning.
“I have no idea, I don’t understand a thing about my little sister! I used to think she was sweet and innocent and smart and utterly a teacher’s pet, but Cassie has ruined her. She’s sly, now, and cunning and she is capable of breaking into the most heavily warded areas.”
“Mr. Malfoy. I am Auror Whithal, and this is my partner, Auror Septimius. There have been charges against you. We are here to take you into custody.”
It clicked. If Draco’s guess was right, this was Dominique, middle child of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. Poor girl, having friends who were fawning over her uncle. It must be terrible.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I hate you both. From now on, only Mother, Pans and Blaise are allowed to talk to me. You, people, male specimens I am related to in one way or another, out. Out out out. Potter, get out. I hate you now.”
“Besides, Blaise and I are already facing Azkaban for life, so a little bit of illegal activity won’t harm us,” Pansy quipped. At Potter’s surprised look, she sighed and said, “We are able to live and work normally, but there is constant surveillance over us. We can’t make a move without the Auror Department knowing.”
“That wasn’t full detail, but I’ll let it slide,” Potter grumbled. “What do we conclude from this case?”
“It’s just – he’s supposed to be in this hallway. Are you sure the name Draco Malfoy doesn’t ring a bell?”
“Bloody Harry Potter. I almost want to challenge him, but I don’t think I would survive. Too bad. Perhaps if I would win, those girls would like me for my bravery.”
“I think, for most students at the moment, an angry half-giant with good relationships with the magical animals around, yeah, that might be scary,” Potter responded with a dry smile around his lips. With that, their conversation had stilted. Potter started talking to his other neighbour and Draco enjoyed his breakfast.
“Are you going to be all sad now? You have to be fierce if you want a chance of fooling Euripideia.”
“Well, you can’t live without one another. You’re utterly dependant, you’re naïve, you believe doing good will actually make the world a better place, but you need to fight! You need to extinguish evil with showing strength. Not by crumbling, crying and then doling out
Draco sat in his room, overthinking the first half of his fifth year. His father had just talked his ears of about taking the Dark Mark and marrying Pansy. Draco could have a lot, but never would he marry Pansy. She was not exactly his type. He couldn’t tell his father this. “Malfoy’s don’t marry for love, Draco. They marry for power.” Draco couldn’t care less. Pansy’s family had no power or money to speak of. The only reason his parents wanted him to marry Pansy was because it was the only one Draco would even consider.
Eyebrows rising, Draco couldn’t contain his smile. “That’s what got you so nervous? No need for that, it sounded well enough. Je vais bien, merci. Et toi?” At Potter’s quick blinking and stunned expression, Draco laughed softly. “I said that I was doing all right, and I asked how you were. Let’s go slow. ‘Je vais bien’, that’s ‘I’m fine’.”
“It’s true! Who’s the horse breeder here? Besides, later that afternoon, I visited Buckbeak again and told him that I didn’t like what he had done. I told him it wasn’t fair.”
“How else would he have gotten it? It’s not like papa would have kept it, if he knew it was Harry’s.”
Two arms wrapped around him, cradling his head against the crook of Harry’s neck. One of the arms let go to get the washcloth and put it on his forehead.
“Sweet, sweet Ophiuchus. How often do I have to tell you? You are worth everything. You are my son, and you can be proud of who you are. Every mistake I made, was my fault and mine only. You shouldn’t ever let anyone tell you that you don’t deserve to live. Love, I don’t want you to think so badly of yourself.” When he felt Phi nod against his chest, Draco dared continue on a sterner note.
“And then comes Cassie. She doesn’t sleep, she’s aggressive and she feels like the world is against her. She doesn’t care about a thing that’s being said about her, but will hurt anyone who is speaking badly of us. Does it come as a surprise if I told you that that’s just like you?”
Draco eyed the collection of notes on the fireplace. Perhaps they should take them off now. He undid the sticking charms one by one, after which he pushed the pile of notes in Albus’s hands. He cast a Tempus, only to see that they should rush downstairs for dinner. As he herded the Slytherins to the Great Hall, he wound an arm around Albus’s shoulder and pulled him close.
Laughing softly, Draco put his feet up on the coffee table to drink his tea, while Potter went to the kitchen for something. The latter returned with a bar of white chocolate, which he handed to Draco with a kiss.
Whoohoo more angstiness. A chapter filled with meddling children, some more meddling children, a third scene containing meddling children, a splash of Amortentia, and a mysterious hoodie.
Draco opened his mouth to answer – probably something about Potter being a sap, or an insult to his hair – but he was interrupted by a shout and a stinging pain to his chest. Potter turned around to see where the shout came from, a reflex from his time as an Auror, and consequently didn’t see Draco falling on the ground, clutching a hand to his chest. Time seemed to slow down as Draco writhed and squirmed, trying to get away from the pain, but not succeeding.
“I’ll tell you,” Whithal continued. “Stinging hexes are illegal starting from a certain viciousness. You crossed that boundary by half of the allowed sharpness. Pepper Breath hexes are illegal in exemplary duels, since they can lead to suffocation and choking, and they can backfire on the audience. Which consisted of students, ladies and gentlemen. Including his own children. The very children that Mr. Malfoy is charged with mistreating.
An explanation would be nice. Because how on earth can he, Draco, ever reveal the Sword of Gryffindor?
“There are green accents in this!” Phi exclaimed happily, when he noticed the green stitches and faint Malfoy crest on his breast pocket.
Suddenly, the door flew open and Cassie bound in, tears streaming down her face. She immediately stalked into the bedroom, closing both doors with a bang.
“The point of the story was, that two animals of the same gender, often become competitive, in an unhealthy way. They fight for the best mate, or the best food, or the best shelter. While two animals of different genders complement each other. One protects, the other feeds. One finds shelter, the other finds the best environment to live in. It’s like yin and yang, like sun and moon. Two counterparts that interact and create the best situation for themselves. If two individuals are so alike, they will eventually hurt one another. They don’t fit right. It’s a counterpart they are looking for, someone that can balance them out. Shy people need someone to bring them out of their shell, loud people need someone to calm them.
Ophiuchus was holding Harry’s hand, wearing his black hair, obviously excited about what was happening. He had gotten much more mature in the last few months, and he had gotten full control of his Animagus form. He was using his panther senses to scout the area, Draco could see by the quick movements of his head. Draco was curious to see how Phi would do at Hogwarts, and mostly, in which house he’d be Sorted. Next year was going to be an adventure.
They reached the shore and stepped out of the boat, not bothering to find an alleyway from which to Apparate, since there was no one around anyway. Hogsmeade was dark and silent, the only sounds coming from the Three Broomsticks. The school itself was quiet as well, since it was past curfew and everyone was in their dorms or common rooms.
When the song was finished, Cassie had stopped crying – externally – andturned on her back to stare at the ceiling.
“I have to warn you, Pansy and Blaise are coming over this evening. I guess they will be here in half an hour. You can stay, if you want, but don’t feel pressured,” Draco smiled. Potter shook his head.
“I’ll make you a deal, though. Stop calling it ‘wooing’ and start calling it ‘wining and dining’. If you do that, I will allow you to continue whatever nonsense you have got into your head.”
“Perhaps, papa, because you are fun to challenge. And every single Potter seems to know exactly how to get under our skin. They’re dangerous for us.”
Potter smiled again, kissing Draco once before leaving. When Draco was returned to his cell, it didn’t seem as dark as it had before. He even managed to do a few puzzles with a smile.
Also, I have been indulging in my guiltiest pleasure all day (some other fandom stuff) while I was supposed to be studying. Woe me.
“Was it James? He’s good at Potions. Did you know that his girlfriend hates you just as much as I do?” Zarnel taunted suddenly. “How hurt would he be if someone told him of how much use Suzanne has been to us. Don’t you think? Anyway, about that question I had, I’m sure you’re willing to listen now.”
“Well, I expect Ms. Euripideia won’t be fixing it herself, so not very long. I think she’ll be called out to see what’s happening, she’ll call someone to get rid of it and return to her office. It’s going to be five minutes at most.”
Ophiuchus sighed softly, prompting Potter to start carrying him on his arm. It isn’t long before Phi fell asleep as well, curling up against Potter’s chest.
“The Sword of Gryffindor is known to reveal itself to a true Gryffindor in need. However, this is not the entire truth about it. Everyone can be a Gryffindor for a moment: a moment where adrenaline and fear cause bravery instead of cowardice.”
“As I was saying, I have a question,” he continued, when Draco joined him again. “Why does everyone,
“Good afternoon,” he said when opening the door. A man of about his age was standing in front of him, wearing a checked shirt and Muggle jeans. He also had a fedora on his head, with large flowers embroidered on it.
Ron chuckled at Phi. “I know, your grandmother did a good job with the latest SPEW event. Hermione is very impressed with her work ethic.”
Grinning, Draco sat down and took the flute Potter offered, while enjoying the view that only got better as the ride advanced. He pressed his face to the window, not really caring about propriety right now, since Potter already had seen his weakest moments.
“Not interesting. If you want, I could assign the two of you a spell that you should counter with a potion. We could make it into a game of sorts. Whoever of you has a working counterpotion first, will… get something. I’ll think about the prize. It would be good practice for both of you.”
Potter gazed at his feet, but quickly looked up when Pansy was done. “I’m all in. I am completely in. I’ll be his friend for as long as he wants me to. I promise that.”
Draco grinned, a plan quickly forming in his head. With one smooth movement, he swerved away, down to the ground in a breakneck speed. Potter didn’t hesitate to follow, just put more power behind his broom and accelerated. When they almost reached the ground, Potter was right next to Draco and was searching for sight of the little golden ball. Draco smirked at him and swerved away, starting to stunt and pulling tricks, instead of chasing the Snitch. Potter held in to see what was going in, but as soon as he understood, he joined in.
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly. The photo was of a laughing baby, playing with a Wizarding chess set. One colour was charmed to play by itself, while the baby did the other. The blond boy cried out with joy whenever a piece moved.
“Well, what someone says isn’t always what they actually mean, is it? Ever heard of the phrase, ‘me thinks the lady doth protest too much’? Atticus could just be head over heels with that Gryffindor of his.”
“Scorpius, behave,” Draco murmured, which only got Phi to start laughing uncontrollably. Scorpius got a pained expression on his face, presumably from laughing so hard. Draco had a hard time suppressing his laughter as well, and the corners of his mouth kept quirking up and down.
Draco fixed his hair, grabbed a backpack in case his children didn’t want to wear their coats or scarves anymore and went downstairs, seeing everyone waiting for him. Potter was, according to James, outside with Phi, to release some of their energy in jumping jacks and squats.
“He knew that we could rely on one another. And whether that was in a relationship, as friends, or from a distance, it wouldn’t matter. But I guess that he thought I would end up falling in love with you, ever since he knew I was bisexual,” Draco grinned.
Rolling his eyes, Potter picked up the dishes to bring it to the kitchen, but Draco stood up just as quickly and put the dishes back down. “We have to go to the beach now, otherwise we’ll miss the sunset. Harky will do the rest. It’s okay, he doesn’t mind. Will you please go to the beach with me now?”
“You know, I actually have a rather good reason for that. You see, my papa was gone for four whole days and I was quite worried, causing my homework to be of a very low quality. Today, he appeared again and I decided to edit some of the more important assignments so they were up to standard. I almost lost track of time!” he explained cheerily.
“Ben & Jerry’s is a Wizarding brand. It’s impossible to make the flavours of ice cream they have with Muggle techniques.”
“Fine!” Draco snapped, holding out his plate for Potter to take, sneaking another bite before Potter took it.
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Potter returned with the punch. Madam Pomfrey smiled knowingly. “I’ll leave you to it. Enjoy yourselves tonight.”
“Why did they have so much fun about that silent garden of yours?” Harry asked when they closed the door behind them, walking outside. It was a wonderful afternoon, one where Draco would like nothing more than to enjoy the sun with some good company and a glass of white wine. Perhaps a book or a puzzle as well.
“Potter, up until fifth year, I made sure to know every single thing about you. As opposed to you, I didn’t have anything to do with the things going on outside of Hogwarts until sixth year. You were all I paid attention to. I saw you go into his office, and I listened at the door.”
They smiled tentatively at each other, until Potter cleared his throat and started the conversation again.
“Of course not, but knowing you, there is. Don’t worry about Cassie, she won’t hear a thing. The differing magical atmospheres are soundproof.”
“That’s your excuse? What about because those were different times, you should be stricter now. Weren’t you the one who fought for House Unity? Weren’t you the one who tried to do everything to stop prejudice, either against pure-bloods or muggles? And look at you now! Now you are the one who has the power to stop bullying and prejudice, and you don’t. Now you are the one who refuses to expel two students who have scarred other students!” Draco exploded. He walked up to the desk and placed his hands on the wood, looming over McGonagall.
“Help? With what?” Draco asked innocently. From the stairs to the girl’s dorms, a loud scoff sounded.
Cassie walked up to him, sinking down on the couch and wriggling under the blanket. “Morning,” she whispered, grabbing Draco’s mug of tea and taking a large sip.
Draco grabbed his unblemished cheek and pulled him close again. “Because if I don’t, the tincture will circulate in your bloodstream and you’ll die. It has to be applied to the skin, but if even a drop of it stays in the wound, you don’t stand a chance. Now stop moving and start talking.”
“I have been reading a lot, so I’ve kept busy. Making sure that Malfoy didn’t bawl his eyes out. You know, the usual.”
Suddenly, the door flew open to let Lily in, who stalked over to Draco and gave him a harsh shove. “Papa, I’ve been listening at the door, even though Scorpius told me not to, but then Aquila asked what I heard, and we mutually decided that we are all very angry at you. It’s bad enough that you don’t tell
“Yeah, enjoying the fire inside. We put out the bonfire and all fireworks in the garden, so it’s perfectly safe to come out.”
“I know. I’m sorry. The pictures just come back, you know. It’s difficult.” Potter took a deep breath, before continuing. “I saw Remus and Tonks. Dead, of course. Lying next to each other like they had after they died, so close, yet not touching. I feel so bad, Malfoy. Teddy’s my godson, but sometimes I just can’t look at him. I see Tonks, when Teddy’s hair morphs, or Remus when Teddy laughs or studies his books. It’s terrible. I can’t bear it. They are all dead because of me, because I was so stupid to wait with going to Voldemort. No one had to die, you know. They all died for me.”
“And then we went to Bill, to get that book you gave him for Christmas, and with the three of us, we managed to brew the counterpotion within a couple of minutes, Apparated to St. Mungo’s, blackmailed the Healer into letting us give it to you, and wait for you to respond to the potion.”
It wasn’t difficult to find the other professors. The sparks flying from magic-containing spells always were loud, especially when clashing with unknown magic.
“Sit down, will you?” Draco asked when he daughters had closed the door behind them. “Ophiuchus, go change and get ready for bed.” Phi moved languidly to the bedroom. He was tired, Draco could see.
“The drawer is locked. My regular potions are in the regular cupboards, but I keep a vial every potion with Neville’s ingredients here. These are the test-runs, vials that can be tested if I ever publish this research. And if anyone tries to sabotage me by adding an ingredient, the vial will blow up. I charmed them.”
James blushed. “Very well, thank you.” After a quirked eyebrow of Draco, he elaborated, smiling shyly. “We want to keep it quiet for now, but we’re actually in a relationship.”
Stroking the snake and hissing like one, Draco opened the box. In it, he kept all kinds of articles from
“I would like you to leave now. I’m quite done with this conversation. You seem to be recovered from your nightmare. Good night,” Draco announced, icily and with his most haughty Malfoy mask. He opened the door and waited for Potter to move.
When Hermione raised her hand prominently and deliberately at the question who thought Draco was innocent, an uproar within the Wizengamot was the result. The chairman was asked to wait in uttering the verdict while the fifty members discussed the case together.
“Have you seen it? I can’t come in, looking like this, while Scorp and Phi and ‘Quila look so perfect. And you as well, probably.”
His car was stood at the same spot where he had left it, which was more than fortunate. They drove home, everyone except for Cassie and Draco falling asleep on top of each other. After a two hour drive, the charming little town of Melksham, Wiltshire appeared in front of them. The main street crossed right through town and turned into a long, winding road, connecting Melksham to other villages in the neighbourhood. On the left side of this road, a bit away from the actual town, there was a barely noticeable pathway, covered with white gravel. This path led to a few farmhouses and farmlands, but there was also a wrought iron gate to be found. The gate opened to let the car through and closed again. It was a nice bit of magic, getting the gate to recognise a Muggle car, and Draco was quite proud of what he had achieved with it.
“Like you’re kidnapped and your replacement doesn’t quite know how to behave like you. I like it, though. You can stay,” Aquila decided dryly.
Draco frowned. “I’ll just have Cassiopeia or Aquila send her a letter, asking her why she didn’t come and visit them. We won’t hear from her in the next three months.”
He rested his head against the pillow, trailing his fingers along Malfoy’s face, neck, collarbones, chest, arms.
The conversation flowed easily, like it had always done between the three of them. Even during the war, it had been easy enough to find topics that either calmed them or distracted them from the awful letters they received every day. That was the reason why Pansy and Blaise became Draco’s friends, instead of Slytherin minions. They were also not afraid to call him out on his mistakes, but were raised with enough sophistication to appease Draco’s father’s sensibilities, and so, Draco’s demands.
Draco hummed, sweeping his eyes over the bent heads of working students. When he met James’s gaze, who was listening intently to their conversation, he invited him to join their discussion with a jerk of his head. James quickly stood up and placed himself next to Theresa.
“Oh no, I merely had Madam Malkin adapt them minimally. Would you say hello to your father, while I gather my things? He is in the library.”
“All right… But you know I can’t do this alone. Ms. Aquila Auriga Malfoy, would you do me the honour of accompanying me on my quest?” Draco said, with a formal bow. Aquila giggled and, adequately raised in the pure-blood manners, accepted her father’s hand with grace and let herself be lead towards the dinner table. Draco set her down on it. With a quick flick, he started the music he knew his children wanted to hear and began to sing.
Potter chuckled stupidly, Phi continued. “Aquila dives into her books and tries to know more and more, until her brains explodes with all the new information. And she remembers everything and becomes a genius, but never even thinks about fighting back. Look at that, just like you.”
“I had more of a choice than Pansy had. I was an Occlumens. Pansy couldn’t do anything to protect herself from him.”
“You of all people know that we are the most motivated students around here,” Roxane said with a snobbish tilt of her chin.
Unfortunately, Potter wouldn’t get the chance to prove he was willing to keep his promise, and Scorpius was right in wanting to wait. Because that evening, during dinner, everything Draco had feared before coming to teach at Hogwarts, would happen.
The sudden change of topic – and atmosphere – had Draco closing his eyes. “I’m sorry, Greg. There really isn’t much I can do about it.”
Albus frowned as well. “It sounds like he is very determined about not letting this influence their strange connection.” His face cleared up quickly. “Perhaps he has some ulterior motives,” he smirked.
“He is amazing. I wished guys of our age looked and dressed like that, as well,” the second one sighed sadly. Draco thought it was pathetic that she wished such a thing, because Potter never dressed well; it were Draco’s robes.
Another week went by, and Draco was feeling the consequences. He wasn’t hungry, he barely slept and there was no chocolate or ice cream for him to consume. He knew, or at least, had a gut feeling, that Cassie wasn’t sleeping either, and he was worried about Scorpius. With the charges being focussed on Scorpius, he would be an easy target for anyone who would want to hurt them. No doubt Scorpius was angry.
“Yes. Do you remember what that means, or should I remind you?” The mocking undertone had Potter clenching his fists.
“I must say, Phi, that I have had the best times of my life at Hogwarts. It was my first real home, even with the war going on. I didn’t have the best childhood, you know.” Why, why was Potter sharing this with a nine-year-old Malfoy of all people? And why did he have to mention the war? What was wrong with him? Draco clenched his jaw and tried to keep calm. Phi noticed his discomfort -or knew Draco well enough to know he would get uncomfortable- and leaned back heavily against his father’s chest.
Draco smirked. “So sorry, hadn’t noticed that it came out like an insult,” he said sweetly, but with a wink to show he meant well.
“Namely that an SHS also works when it’s written, as long as a complicated spell is cast over the paper and the words. The complexity of the magic
They grinned at each other, glad that they could make jokes even in the worst of times. Above them, on the second floor, they saw the light curtains fluttering behind the open window of the third room to the right.
“Yes. If it is for the healing of Slytherins, I would still help you, but it would mean that Slytherins were still bullied. And frankly, I would like to know if that was going on.”
Draco turned around when he got to the front of the Great Hall, belting out the last line of the refrain and hitting the high note perfectly. He did some old-fashioned cliché rock move, shook his hair around, as the Great Hall burst out in applause. The repeats of ‘
“All this makes me think it’s a seventh-year, rather than anything else. But I wouldn’t know any seventh-year that’s personally involved with… the SHS couple,” Albus mused. “Not even family or friends of the Gryffindor that could be friends with the Slytherin doing this.”
The next day, Saturday, Neville had invited Draco and Potter to come visit him and Hannah in London for an evening with the ‘old gang’. Neville had even asked Draco to invite Pansy, Blaise and Greg. And when Draco told him that Blaise was going to meet up with his work partner, Theodore Nott, Neville responded by extending the invitation to him as well.
. And again when you were eleven, and seventeen and every time in between. And then there’s me, the poster boy of the next generation Death Eaters. Scorpius is in the hospital, because of my history. If we would be together, the entire Wizarding society of Great Britain would fall all over it.”
Draco chuckled. “Aren’t I just?” he joked gently, rubbing Potter’s back until he calmed down a bit. “You aren’t so bad yourself.”
“Depends on what you’re trying to achieve, doesn’t it?” Aquila smirked slightly. Scorpius gave her an approving nod.
“No sorry, I was rather busy with wrapping my mind around the fact that I pulled the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Hat, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Potter, I appreciate the way you sympathise, but really, I don’t need to be reminded of his situation. I feel bad enough as it is.”
“Really, since when are you allowed to mock me?” Draco asked. “I don’t remember giving you permission to pester me with my own history. Especially when it concerns Potters. Nothing personal, Albus, I quite like you.”
“Gladly,” Potter sighed and moved back in for a languid kiss. They broke apart, only to put away the plates and press even closer. When they parted, it was because the door flew open to let the seven children in.
Standing up, he left the paper on the table for someone else to read or clean, and went up to his room. He closed the door. He didn’t exactly know what to do with his spare time. He didn’t feel like reading, and wasn’t keen on writing his letters. An idea sprang to mind. He knelt at the side of his bed and pulled the wooden box from under it. He hadn’t picked it up in a few months.
“Kindly shut your face. I was trying to do something here. Because there is one other secret I kept from you.”
Draco chuckled and shook his head while walking towards the library. There, he saw his father sitting in his chair by the fire. His father was too engrossed in his book to notice Draco coming in, so Draco remained quiet and moved towards the newspaper archive in one of the corners. Copies of
“Get caught doing what?” Draco asked. His expression told quite clearly that he knew exactly why his daughters were talking to George Weasley.
Suddenly, a beautiful eagle Patronus flew into the room and perched on Scorpius’s shoulder. It cried a couple times before nudging Scorp’s head and flying out of the window again, looking back and circling as if waiting for the boys to follow. James shot up and pointed at it.
Potter nodded. “There are… I was just with Minerva, and there were… There are two Aurors in her office, Malfoy. They’re here for you.”
The woman in the corner that had been staring at Draco’s ear, Alissa, apparently, took a few steps forward. “He is using Occlumency, ma’am.”
Draco shook his head, going to sit on the chair at the window. “Healer Thornbecke said that it shouldn’t take long, because he’s only been unconscious for a week. But he can’t say anything for sure.”
“And I’m not the fashionista of Slytherin House. Draco is. Never forget that,” she winked. Potter chuckled again, while Blaise was still giggling about his own joke.
Draco sighed, scenes of Aquila and Matias together flashing to the forefront of his mind. “I honestly have no idea what to look for, I usually just know. I can’t explain it. But I’ll try to find out whether she likes you, and if she does, I’ll help you. Do we have a deal?”
Suzanne pushed James away laughingly before focussing on Draco. “Well, some Healing potions are a form of counterpotions. They can counter a charm, potion or spell. However, counterpotions aren’t always as successful as the proper countercharm, but they are easier to invent. And there is a lesser chance of mucking up.”
Potter laughed, a soft, gentle sound Draco had before only heard when Potter was talking to one of his children. “I didn’t know, but now I do. Still, though, you can’t get more.”
Potter relaxed a bit, since he could have expected those children to know, but Pansy didn’t stop. “James, Albus, Lily.”
Albus winced when Draco dabbed just a bit too hard on one of the gashes. Putting the vial away, Draco conjured a sterilised cloth to clean the wounds better before continuing applying the tincture. He alternated between these two methods.
“Stop being so bloody impatient, Longbottom. As I was saying, these potions will have to be approved, but I really think many of the new potions can replace the ones that are used now, and are, indeed, impossible to brew or obtain. Or illegal, for that matter.”
“Can you wrap the last presents while I start on the stew?” he asked, explaining where the wrapping paper and the gifts could be found.
Sitting down, Potter shook his head. “I don’t know. I was angry and upset because of the article. I didn’t mean to Conjure Nagini, at the moment I cast the spell, I thought ‘shit no, please don’t be Nagini, it shouldn’t be.’ That article made me so angry!”
“Are you interrogating me? I’ve just always thought this was a nice place to propose to someone. The smell of those roses, the idea behind them. It was one of my grown-up fantasies.”
Potter nodded. “Well, that’s exactly what is happening in the Ministry. I think the Wizengamot is eager for the public approval, and tolerates a bit of corruption in the cases here and there. And since you are one of the best known Death Eaters…”
“Obviously, hadn’t you noticed yet? I’m cheating on my boyfriend with a Gryffindor. I thought that was common knowledge,” Barbra responded sarcastically.
“They said the only reason I could morph between blond and black, was because you had given me some potion so I would be more interesting for the media. They said all you wanted was attention. That you were bad, and that you didn’t deserve to live. And because of that, I didn’t deserve to live and ‘Quila and Scorp and Cassie neither. And many other bad things.”
Draco grimaced. “You were the only one who thought I was a catch, Pansy-poo.” Pansy scowled at the ancient nickname. “But no, I don’t think he has much of a love life. He’s far too obsessed with the Potter kid.”
Draco smiled fondly. “Dominique misses you incredibly. She’s been talking in that odd mix of languages you share, but no one understands her. Albus –“
“Salazar and Godric both, how can anything this perfect be legal? How did you know to combine those two?”
Confusedly looking up, and trying to casually wipe away the tears gathered in his eyes, Dad shook his head. “No, I’ll stay here until it’s over. I’m not leaving.”
Potter looked at Draco for a moment, before he took a large gulp of his spiked tea. “My name is J-J-J. I guess it works.”
“Ophiuchus, don’t fight. Relax. Let your body do what it needs. Focus on that battle, when Potter conjured the snake. How did you feel then?”
“Yes. My horses belong to the best of the world. Beaux-Batons uses my Abraxans exclusively, since Madame Olympe Maxime passed away. The top five of fastest Granians are of my breeding. Even Laurentia Fletwock, the famous horse racer, has admitted that her breedings cannot compete with mine. The Aethonans are used by Ministry workers for official overseas trips to the continent. Hogwarts is my main client for the thestrals. They are extremely well-trained, as you can see. No danger at all, are you, Peanut?”
Cassie kept looking at George with wide eyes. After a few seconds, she whispered, “Do you have any good stuff I can use during my classes?”
“What are you thinking about?” Scorpius sounded from the other side of the room. Draco looked up to see him with a tired, but content expression on his face.
When he was ignored in favour of strolling onto the street, Draco clenched his fists in frustration and followed quickly.
James leafed through the book, exclaiming softly when he found what he was looking for. “Here it is!
Draco felt a tiny tingle of magic wash over him, comforting enough to know that Aquila wanted him to take the deal.
“And that’s about enough. Come on, Potter, you don’t want to hear this. You’ve got to leave Mother alone before she thinks you’re interested in her stories,” Draco interrupted with a wink. Potter only grinned and led himself be lead away.
“We will need your identification papers, and your son’s too. Make sure you’ve got them ready once we are in the room. Another nurse will come to you to ask what happened while we work on him and try to find how bad it is. For now, you can’t go into the room. We will call you when you can come inside,” the nurse told him.
After agreeing that they would meet at Potter’s rooms, Draco quickly put the Scrivenshaft’s bag away and grabbed pen and paper, so he could make notes from the things Potter told him.
“Exactly, but that won’t happen. It will get easier the more you use your Patronus, but the first time is difficult.”
Laughing, Potter let his eyes roam over the four tables and grinned. “It’s not so bad,” he concluded when returning to Draco.
Draco huffed a smile. “Gryffindors are always stupid,” he answered absent-mindedly. Theresa, noticing his distraction, squinter her eyes at him.
Albus didn’t want to continue now, and Draco saw that. “They drew the Dark Mark,” Draco whispered. Albus merely nodded, avoiding eye contact and fiddling with the buttons on his robes.
Their verbal battle had come to an end, but their eyes kept speaking for them. Draco knew Pansy wasn’t impressed with Draco’s hateful looks anymore, and usually he was glad for that, but right now, he wished he still had the power over her like he had in fourth year. In the end, Potter decided for them.
There, on the path where Draco had given Harry his engagement ring, was a woman in black clothing, holding Aquila and Lily tight with some kind of restraining magic.
Albie’s loud grumble caused Draco to laugh as he walked down the stairs, smiling to himself when he saw that one of the elves had already cleaned up the mud Harry had left. He heard the noise of six people eating cake and having fun in his living room. Draco had never noticed how empty this house had seemed, even with four children in it, until it was now filled to the brim – although he still had many empty rooms and unused wings – and there was never a moment of silence around.
Draco stared forlornly at the letter he had sent the Minister and that had now been returned. Apparently, the Minister hadn’t seen it necessary to read the letter, let alone answer it. It disappointed Draco, but he wasn’t surprised.
Healer Brinsbridge laughed with him. “She still is, just in a different way. I am sorry I wasn’t there to see her grow up, you know. She must have been a treasure.”
At the reception area, he didn’t wait, rather running through the hallways to papa’s room. It was late in the evening now, with barely anyone around. Maybe he should have gone to Hogwarts first, to let people know where he was. Or at least tell the others that he was working on a counterpotion.
He poured a slimy purple drab into the cauldron, watching it sputter and bubble for a moment before continuing.
Another chapter, yay! Thank you all for your faith in me about the writing competition. We'll see whether I managed to do it sort of okay.
Draco stood with his shoulder towards Teddy and Victoire. He didn’t see much, except movement of green hair as Teddy probably looked at Phi.
“I will not have you lie to me, Potter. Today was a day for honesty, remember? Would you rather stay here, tonight?”
His voice was wobbly and he was still trying to pretend he wasn’t crying. “We had never been good at doing something without the other around. If only we had stayed together, he wouldn’t have died.”
The sudden question alarmed Draco, especially with their recent engagement in the forefront of his mind. “I – yes. Yes, I will. I don’t know whether you mean right now, or long-term, but I will. I hope you realise that.”
When Draco placed his cheek on the black mob of hair, he only had time to ponder the strangeness of their acquaintance, before he fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.
Potter’s hand was tightly wrapped around Draco’s waist. There was an exorbitant amount of eyes on them, most of them glancing every now and then, but others just plainly staring. The few journalists that were present, had a camera unflinchingly pointed at them, and one that switched between Minerva and the students.
“Although I believe the fan club has always been a reality. There is no way on earth that the Patil twins wanted to go to the Yule Ball with you. Or that Cho Chang actually liked you. They were far too pretty for you troll face.”
“I am going to Obliviate you and me both, Potter,” he murmured in a sigh. He saw Blaise grinning and Pansy looking completely innocent.
A shiver ran through Draco at the picture of a person being consumed by fire, but he managed to keep his composure.
“Determination, willpower and endless charm. Right? It’ll work it, as long as you are determined to fix it, as long as you have the willpower to keep your head op, and as long you can charm your way in and out of trouble.”
He turned around to Whithal again, hands again behind his back. “Since when are domestic cases labelled ‘Red’?”
“Every day, if you’d like. I would recommend your children to keep going to school, since it may distract them and help them through the day. I don’t know if you live anywhere close or if you are able of travelling back and forth…”
“No, really. I used to be tired and afraid, and I used to think you were my worst enemy. Of course you were able to rile me up. Now, not so much.” Potter’s voice was a bit high-pitched.
Why did he do it? How did he get the Sword? He isn’t a Gryffindor. He hates Gryffindors. He will never be selfless. Or, well, he had been just now, when he killed Voldemort. When he saved Potter.
He saw Albus walk to Scorpius and whisper something, which caused Scorp to go to Cassie and the girl, Lucia, and wrap an arm around her. Then, Draco stepped out of the portrait and moved to the Ravenclaw Tower.
How long had they already been watching them at the Lodge? How had they even come in? The wards around the Lodge could rival those around the Manor, there was no one that could get through if they hadn’t been invited.
“That reminds me,” Draco started. “The person we’re looking for, must also have connections with the Auror department, and perhaps even with
Draco eyed it warily. “If you know so much about pureblood courtship, I suppose my children have told you what dancing means?”
Ladies, gentlemen and unicorns, I have an announcement to make. Ever since the start of this story, I have had a playlist of songs on Youtube that I used to get in the mood for writing this. And this is also a playlist of every song that has featured in this story. Therefore, I thought you might like to listen to this playlist as well...
“Muggle London,” Draco whispered. Potter pulled him further at his hand, passing by the queue and greeting the security guard.
“I suspect they hope for the best. Because, here is the deal, the audience may speak. The audience has an influence on the sentence, either positively or negatively. They can make or break you. We can use that to our benefit.”
Just outside his room was Pansy waiting for him to appear and bring him back to the school. “You ready?” she asked with a smile.
“Don’t do anything illegal,” Draco managed to say, before he dozed off again, tired of his illness and the drama.
The chair swivelled around, so Potter was now facing him. He had a huge grin on his face. “Hi there,” he said. Draco pointedly looked at his chair, and Potter grinned wider.
“Don’t be so dramatic. I thought you had grown out of that. Just like you grew out of your own stupid choices.”
Draco chuckled. “I know, Mother, I understand. I care about that too, I haven’t completely abandoned everything you’ve ever told me. Some things are still valuable to me.”
“That doesn’t matter. But I have to ask you to keep it a secret from James, Albus and Lily as well. And the Weasleys. They might blurt it out one day on accident.”
Draco groaned again, but stepped out of bed to grab some casual robes and change in the en-suite. After fixing his hair until it looked less like he had just rolled out of bed, he went downstairs to see whether Potter needed some help.
Neville hesitated, eyes roaming the Great Hall. “Draco. Now that I think about it, I haven’t seen Scorp. Nor any of the others.”
Rolling his eyes, Potter did the last thing he could think of. Wandlessly and wordlessly, he cast an Alohomora on the entire wall. At a slow whooshing sound, Potter turned to look at the wall. It had opened to reveal a long hallway, only illuminated by torches. It looked like the dungeons, but Draco wasn’t there.
Hi! So, first off... I know I missed last week, but I have a (good?) reason for that. Because, you see, I told you that I would have a lot of stress, and you all were so kind to say that I should take my time, so I thought you might not mind so much if I skipped a week? I was reeeaaally tired, could barely keep my eyes open, let alone write something of passable quality. So for your sake as well as for mine, I just didn't do it?
A ginger girl chuckled. “At about the moment you started talking about magic being susceptible to emotions. How can that be?”
Slowly, Draco walked up to Potter to stare him down. When Potter only kept grinning, Draco opened his fist above Potter’s head and let the flour drizzle over his hair.
,” Aquila answered, after which she narrowed her eyes at Draco and Potter, opening her mouth to say something else.
Taking the Dark Mark would mean siding with the Dark Lord for eternity. Draco couldn’t ever say this out loud, especially not in the Manor, but he doubted whether the Dark Lord would be able to defeat Potter and his fan base. So taking the Dark Mark would mean being on the losing side. It would mean either death or lifelong exile from his home and from society.
Draco listened to their almost practiced conversation with a growing smile. “Sure, sure. I love you too. Now, can someone update me in detail on life at Hogwarts? And, you know, the entire Wizarding World?”
“Why do I see things that happened to you? Am I a Seer? Is there something wrong with me? Were you cursed?”
“Merely some Veritaserum I found in your cupboards. I wanted to ask you some personal questions and be sure you were honest. Very Slytherin of me, don’t you think?”
Draco scowled at her. “Pansy, you haven’t even had a drink yet, and you’re already torturing me. Could you wait with that, at least, until I have drowned a bottle of Firewhiskey?”
Draco scoffed, ignoring Cassie and Lily’s giggles. “Because you can’t keep secrets from Hermione, that’s why.”
Immediately, Draco began, grinning. They always ended with ABBA. Lovely music, those Muggles had. He wasn’t ashamed of using big gestures to act out some parts of the song, and he directed his children to sing along. Ophiuchus started dancing –or rather, moving with his body in an attempt at dancing.
“Good morning. For those of you who don’t know yet, my name is Draco Malfoy. This year, I will teach you how to make more advanced potions like Shrinking Solution and Antidote to Uncommon Poisons. You will also learn how to work with new ingredients.
dying, because you didn’t stand up for yourself. And I dare say that he won’t be able to take much more before he breaks.”
Draco stood still and looked down at his outfit. It was a very pale blue, matching his skin in paleness, but his eyes in electric blue. A bit like the transparent blue of ice caps. Draco liked these robes. But his children might be right. He only wore them when he was planning something. This morning, however, he had pulled them out without thinking much of it.
Like always, DYING to hear what you think of this! Please leave comments and feedback. Your comments make me happy, resulting in more chapters/longer chapters/better chapters and Happy Drarry.
“Just, in the beginning of the year, when you dosed me with Veritaserum. We agreed that you owed me. It’s the honourable thing to do.”
Draco gestured for Harry to follow him to another part of the labyrinth, which opened just as easily and invitingly for Draco as the first part they had come through. Winding an arm around Harry’s bemudded waist, Draco said, “This route is shorter. There’s a labyrinth all around the stables, and this a shortcut to the house. We’ll come in through the backdoor, and if you rush up the stairs, you’ll end up in my bedroom without leaving too much mud in the house. There’s an ensuite bathroom.”
Plumping down on the chair closest to the tree, Draco looked longingly at Potter’s cup of tea. “You woke Cassie.”
Draco chuckled. “Relax, Albus, I already know. I’m only looking for confirmation. He won’t mind that much.”
Looking at Potter to see if he was listening, Draco nodded. “That’s average, yes. Sometimes I wonder whether something has gone wrong in her brain.”
“Yes, of course,” Draco nodded distractedly, throwing glances through the small window continuously. “He… We were in Diagon Alley, to celebrate his birthday. He and his sister are – you don’t need to know that. A group of men, I think they were drunk, insulted me. Scorpius isn’t good at handling that. He may have provoked them. I thought he was following me, like his siblings, while we were walking away, but he wasn’t. And then I came back and he was on the ground, barely conscious, being kicked.”
“As long as I don’t fall out of my portrait, I’m fine. That would be an awful experience, wouldn’t it? Now, gently place me on the other wall, so I can see what you are doing. I wouldn’t want you to break my spot. Very well. That looks like a solid wall though. I fear you won’t be able to get in. No, that spell doesn’t work. Ouch, that one doesn’t either. Now, now, don’t get frustrated, that was far too violent a try for a gentle charm like that.”
Draco nodded. “I like hazelnut as well. White is good, too. White hazelnut is heaven on Earth,” he said, while slowly, subconsciously, letting his finger fall down to his chin and keeping it there, as if he was thinking.
“He is going to push everyone away if we let him. He is going to be miserable. We have to do something.”
Draco picked up the different colours of glaze, snorting at the sight. Red, green, yellow and blue. He would have to get creative with which figures he would glaze, since Potter had only done Christmas trees.
“Potter, you are forgetting that Cassie can see my memories. I fixed the Vanishing Cabinet. I found the Room of Requirement. I knew where the monster in second year was hiding. She has seen all these things in her dreams. She has more magical experience than anyone her age, because of my memories. Combine that with my ability to see the smallest details and find the best-hidden secrets, and you’ll have someone that can open a door with a twitch of her fingers.”
“They’ve already spent the entire Christmas weekend with them. Are you sure that’s all? Not your old –and frankly embarrassing- obsession with Potter?”
Draco frowned at Potter, since he was acting a bit weird. Potter kept staring at Draco’s hand, which made him a bit self-conscious.
He stood up, signed for Theresa to stand a few metres away and grabbed his wand to cast the newly made up spell for the first time.
“No, my father always plays by the rules. He is the new Potions Professor and Slytherin Head of House, and since there is no one who I could live with when he was here, Professor McGonagall decided to house me as well.”
“Listen, the Sopophorus bean is very difficult, there is no denying it. There are multiple solutions for it, though. For some potions, it can’t harm to crunch it with the blade of your knife. For this one, however, it is very important that you cut it, and not crunch it. Put your hand over the bean, so that it’s properly covered and it can’t go anywhere,” he instructed, as Lucy fumbled her way through his guidance.
Eyes widening and valiantly trying to suppress his chuckles, Potter stared at the plate. “Malfoy, this is a quarter of that upper tier. And this is your
Harky conjured a piece of paper and handed it to Harry. “This only has to be signed by the Master. Master Draco usually copies it for his own administration also.”
“You see, papa is a sentimental sap,” Cassie explained. “He wanted to name all of us to family members. Phi’s second name is Sirius. You understand what I mean.”
As they followed the yellow trail, Draco felt the wash of Dark magic, and something else that seemed familiar.
At Diagon, they popped into Hannah’s little pub, where the Mrs. Longbottom was just serving a group of older men. It was quiet still, as it was only early afternoon and a Wednesday, and Memorial Day of the Battle, and not many people were out and about on the streets. Potter and Draco enjoyed a glass of wine each and an ice cream, before they headed out.
James huffed a short laugh and left with a last wave. As soon as the door closed behind him, Draco picked up the essay and started reading. He only left his office once, when he needed to say goodnight to Phi and the others, but didn’t stop reading otherwise, until it was finished.
“That’s not what I was going to say. I was going to give you actual advice,” Draco remarked. Both girls looked up, not disguising their surprise. Draco rolled his eyes.
“No, absolutely not. Papa truly hated him, and during the war he wouldn’t have dared to keep such a thing.”
“I had to come through the window, otherwise they would wonder why I came to visit you. Scorp, we have to do something. Albus isn’t here, is he? Just like I thought. He’s gone doing some very Potter things, Scorpius.”
“Of course. The research consisted of brewing potions, as I said, with magically adapted ingredients. I am not sure which ingredients have been adapted, and how, but I know the result was that less enhancers were necessary.
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on his back until he turned a corner, where he finally allowed himself to start panicking.
Albus smiled. “Well, asphodel is associated to death and the underworld, in Greek terms, but is related to lilies, which signify majesty and love. In an emotional potion, asphodel can make the intended emotion much more vicious, much more negative. For example, a love potion with asphodel will encourage feelings of jealousy in the drinker. If the potion is very strong, the drinker can murder someone who claims the attention of their love object.”
The following Friday, Ophiuchus excused himself from his papa’s lesson to visit the Defense classroom. Arriving there, he smiled at some of the Weasleys that were attending that particular lesson and approached the teacher’s desk. All students were working on an essay, which meant that Potter didn’t have much to do, except making sure that everyone kept working.
“Because every magic trick you do, will leave a trace. We don’t want that. I’ve got some Muggle matches for you… right here. Light them if you really want to see where you’re going, but please, refrain as much as possible. Any other questions?”
“Typical,” Draco grumbled, tugging on his –rather fashionable- Muggle coat and winded his scarf around his neck. “Everyone wearing warm enough clothes? Aquila, do you have your gloves? You know how cold your hands get.”
“No, no, don’t worry, mate,” George chuckled. “They did beg, but I was already thinking of giving them free stuff. As a sort of thank you. I mean, you know you’re teaching my daughter, right? She adores you. She has written a few letters in which she doesn’t do much more than gush about you. I can spare a few items for your children.”
“You’ll only die faster if you don’t sleep. I’ll wake you if I think it’s necessary. Sleep now, Draco.”
“Drink up,” Draco ordered, handing Potter his glass. Potter eyed it suspiciously and then gazed at Draco.
“No. But Severus knew… things. And he had a theory, which, if I may say, has been proven correct many times already, and the theory was also about us.”
The next day, Draco and the other professors were called to McGonagall’s office, before breakfast. There, they got to hear that two students were expelled, and would not return to Hogwarts. Draco barely stopped smiling on his way to the Great Hall and throughout breakfast.
Potter would have a lot to think about. So Draco was trying to keep his distance from Potter, that much was obvious now. However, if Cassie’s hints were correct, Draco felt Potter was his friend. Draco doesn’t particularly want to exclude Potter. He just thinks it’s better for everyone.
The series Suits just uploaded in my country, so that I now can watch season 5 and I'm going crazy over here. I'M GOING CRAZY I'M TELLING YOU
“Well, me, Neville, Mike Startle, you know the Flying instructor. Sometimes Sprout and Pomfrey join, but very rarely. Oh, and the Arithmancy professor, Colin Parnarush, and the new Divination teacher Wrilda Hellodorn.”
The Patronus started speaking right after it had settled down and fluttered its feathers. When Draco recognised Aquila’s voice, he burst out laughing, letting another tear drop in relief.
“You are all Sorted into Slytherin. Some of you have been here for years now, others see the dungeon for the first time. To all of you apply the same thing. Slytherin is most commonly seen as the evil house. Slytherin isn’t particularly liked, and has sometimes done nothing to refute their reputation. You will have to endure this. Perhaps other students will dislike you, hate you even, for being a snake. But remember one thing: you are in this together. Stick together like a family. Do not betray a Housemate, because that is like betraying a brother or sister. Care for each other. Your Housemates are all you have in times of trouble. Know that whatever they say about being a Slytherin, isn’t necessarily true.”
“You’ll always be my little darling. Precious, your papa and I need to talk a bit more. Can I have a private moment with him? I’ll see you after that, of course, love.”
“And, listen up, and Draco here loves to sing,” Pansy then said. “So really, the obvious thing to do is have Draco sing for Harry, right. We should let Draco sing for Harry. A love song. A sonnet. A serenade.”
Aquila thought about it for a moment. “I don’t think so. I guess most of them think you just wanted to talk to me. I might have told people we agreed to meet each other every day, just in case you ever surprised me by visiting. For this kind of reasons, of course.” She seemed a bit ashamed by her little white lie.
Right on cue, a loud clatter of pans were heard and Potter appeared, sheepishly looking at all the Weasleys that were laughing at him. He smiled upon seeing Draco, coming his way but stopping immediately when he saw Narcissa sitting at the table, being left alone by Andromeda, who was getting them a drink.
“So Malfoy, I need your help with something,” Potter announced, following Draco to his apartment in the dungeons.
“The Sword of Gryffindor is not a regular sword,” she tells the crowd. Draco flinches, moves to get away again, when the next words are spoken. “Today something extraordinary has happened, and the Sorting Hat would like to explain how it could happen. I will tell you what the Hat is telling me.”
“You know Cass. She’ll probably make one huge mistake because she thinks that is what she’s supposed to do, and then realise how much better her life could be if she followed her own heart. She’ll be alright.”
It took Potter a while before he understood, but when he did, he tried to cover up his smile before answering. He thought Draco might not appreciate seeing his smug grin. He was sure that the letter had been from Draco’s mother, asking for his favourite chocolate.
“Cassie, love… I’m not going to pretend that I know how it is to be a woman, because I don’t. But I do know how it feels to be insecure. I never feel like I am good enough, you know that. And I have never thought of myself as handsome.”
“There is something Albus told me about you,” Potter said. There was a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “And Phi made me realise why you did it.”
“Well,” he started conversationally. “When he’s angry, he places his left hand over his right, see, like this. And then his right hand is turned upwards, so he can press his fingernails in his left palm, to distract himself from his anger.”
When Draco returned to the living room, Potter was staring at his tea, with a pile of essays on the table next to him, ready to be marked.
So. I'm late again. It's February 15th here. But let's pretend that it's still Valentine's Day, yeah?
Draco eyed his ice cream with a look full of love and disbelief, before he tucked in, humming. “This is so perfect,” he mumbled around his spoon.
Quickly introducing them to the Weasleys, Draco passed them all a glass of champagne – and was pleasantly surprised when Greg asked for pumpkin juice instead. He had received the letter from the rehabilitation centre, then.
Potter knew his answer to this. “I have been reading up on this stuff. I thought you might like to be properly wooed.”
Smiling, James picked up his wand and summoned a cauldron and a variety of ingredients. He lit the fire under the cauldron and started making a basis with practised movements.
“Thank you,” he managed. It was a long hallway, with only a few turns. He counted his steps, trying to level his head. He knew that if he did one thing wrong, if he made them suspicious, Cassie would be in danger.
Potter chuckled. “Absolutely. And the weirdest thing is… Lily’s dress is neither the same colour, nor does it clash with Cassie’s and Aquila’s. While the robes of your sons match perfectly with those of James and Albus, only differing in accessories.”
“Depends on how much he knows. He said he had been spying on Manila, I wouldn’t put it past him to have kept a load of information behind for us.”
They spent two hours just silently drinking their drinks, making soft small talk and sharing those tiny personal facts that one wouldn’t tell anyone during the day and when looking each other in the eye.
Clenching his jaw and fists, Lucius stood up to guide Potter to the door, not saying anything until Potter was outside, turning around to walk away.
“I’ll be in the kitchen to fix us some more drinks. It will take a while, because I’ll do the dishes as well,” he announced, giving Pansy a significant look. She nodded at him and leaned forward, refocussing on Potter.
“No, but there are people willing to hurt and torture,” Neville snapped. “Sorry. I mean, the people we’re trying to find have hurt you and others so much. If they find me in the Department of Mysteries, if they realise that that plant is mine – which they will, my magical signature is all over it – they will not only take revenge on me, but they can also arrest me. It’s illegal, in case you didn’t know yet.”
“Your youngest is quite… energetic,” he said with a wink. Draco laughed. “He most certainly is. Especially when Cassie is egging him on. Those two together is a disaster.”
“No. I chose Astoria myself. Yes, my father wanted me to marry as soon as possible, so I couldn’t find a bloke I wanted to spend my days with, and so I could provide an heir. But nor my father nor my mother are preventing me from being courted by or courting you.”
At that moment, Potter came barging down the stairs, obviously having tried to tame his hair and failed.
Potter nodded. “I am aware. However, if I remember correctly, this is the proper way to file a complaint without stepping directly to the Department Head, isn’t it?”
Favourite comment on my last chapter: 'CAN THIS JUST CALM DOWN FOR FIVE FUCKING SECONDS SO I CAN BREATHE??!?!!'
“N-. N-. I do no-. Salazar on a stick!” Draco stood up and gulped down his glass of water. Feeling it was not enough, he summoned the Firewhiskey from his cupboards, the one he always saved for Potter’s nightmare nights, and filled his tumbler with the amber liquid.
“Roxane,” Draco said softly, while walking up to the desk of sixth-year daughter of George Weasley. “Where is the rest of my class?”
After the twins came Cassiopeia. She was also Malfoy blond, but Draco tended to associate it more with Luna Lovegood than with him. Must be the male/female thing. Cassiopeia was the most ruthless and thoughtless of the four. She could fly a broom straight into a tree because she wasn’t paying attention. She was energetic —very energetic— and wanted to try everything. Her eyes were bright with pleasure, and whenever she was sad, she cried with loud sobs. She had deprived him of many hours of sleep. As a baby or a toddler, she had cried a lot at night. Astoria refused to get up in the middle of the night, and as such, Draco had formed quite the bond with their own little Moaning Myrtle. (Astoria also never liked the fact that Draco called Cassie that. When she left, ‘Myrtle’ became Cassie’s standard nickname.)
“And when papa notices how good it smells, he decides to keep it and throw a scent-preserving spell on it,” Scorpius mused. “It still doesn’t sound right; why would papa want to preserve the scent?”
This brought a smile on Draco’s face, especially when he saw how happy his mother was, mingling with everyone around.
Right before Draco answered, he felt a change in the magic surrounding him. Apparition was no longer possible, Draco
Draco grinned. Lily was a sweet girl. It was no wonder Cassie and she could get along so well. They were similar in many ways, in how they treated others, and how they always seemed to know exactly what was going on, even if no one had told them.
“Because his nightmares are always worse, always scarier, always better informed. It’s practically impossible to frighten him with your fears.”
Agreeing, Potter piled his essay in two somewhat neat stacks, before trudging towards the dungeons. There, Pansy brought out a key from her pockets and opened the door.
They laughed together, softly to keep it within the confines of their bubble. Draco wrapped an arm around Potter’s waist and squeezed, making him look up. “Let’s get the children to bed. I need my tea-and-chocolate therapy.”
A chair was shoved his way and Laurentia’s magic pushed him down on it, while he was still panicking about the casual way Laurentia had mentioned Aquila may die.
Draco’s Boggart had changed from his worst fear into something that made him laugh, like the spell was supposed to do. Now, it was Potter, stumbling his way forward while being attacked by snow balls.
“The third curse you cast, the Broken Bone curse, is not only illegal in exemplary duels, but it’s illegal for everyone that is not an Auror. This is a fairly recent law, introduced by who other than our dear own former Deputy Head Auror Mr. Potter. Do you see why we have a problem with you?”
“I haven’t had this much trouble since right after the war, as I said before Phi walked in. The odds of this trial were against me. I think nothing that happened this year is coincidental.”
Draco noticed with narrowed eyes the activity between his children, the Potters and the Weasleys. He didn’t like it, because for some reason, he knew it was about him and Potter. If only he could know exactly what was going on. And if only Potter could stop talking to him.
When James nodded eagerly, Draco smiled and held out his hand to help James up from his sitting position. They kept chatting amiably together, because James obviously needed someone to talk to that wasn’t his father, and Draco couldn’t help but like the easy conversation.
Draco felt tears prickling behind his eyelids, extraordinarily feeling the hurt of seeing his children’s reactions. Cassie probably wouldn’t know what to with her life, and if he wouldn’t be able to make her forgive herself for this tiny mistake of hers, he knew that she would never get over it. Scorpius was most likely going to fight until he exhausted himself and broke down after Draco had truly passed. Ophiuchus would never be able to be sure of anything, he would forever doubt himself until the very end or until someone came along to drag him out of the grey area he would have brought himself in.
“Papa was the one who had to witness our self-esteem crumble to pieces, and he was the one to build it up again. He gave us the ability to love and laugh, and made us into the people we are today. Everything he had, he gave us.
Potter let his gaze sweep over the four Malfoys, sitting grinningly on the sofa, as if he hadn’t noticed them before. “How about next week, then?” he negotiated. “You said there is nothing you would love more.”
“Perhaps not all potions, and the unenhanced potions will have to be perfected, approved and authorised –“
“How can you be so sure?” Potter asked. His voice seemed a bit thin, like he needed reassurance that Albus and Scorpius really were friends. Draco rubbed at a spot behind his ear.
Deep down inside, however, Scorpius was the sweetest child. He hated everyone who would stand in Aquila’s way and protected his youngest brother with his life, when they walked down Diagon Alley. His smile could light up the world, and his laughter actually tinkled. He was a very proud boy, though. Proud of his family and proud of his heritage —if one just skipped the part his family played in the Wizarding Wars. He didn’t dislike Muggles, but did tend to be attracted to purebloods. But, Draco reasoned, Scorpius had always chosen the old brooms of his father, rather than a new Firebolt, even when he couldn’t see the difference yet. He probably just senses old magic.
Slowly, so extremely slow, Draco was opening his palm and opening Potter’s in the same movement. Potter felt Draco swallow before the latter threaded his fingertips between Potter’s. That’s when Draco stopped moving his hands, heart still hammering against his chest, so that Potter heard the irregular
“That – That’s you? In France, I think? Yeah, yeah, that’s nice. Good weather, I see. Sweet picture,” Potter mumbled.
Albus laughed again, going to Scorpius in order to drag him away from the chocolate stall. Draco sighed sadly and followed them. While the five Malfoys and three Potter children were walking away, Potter quickly bought three pounds of chocolate, in almost every flavour available. If he could make Draco happy with a Christmas present made of chocolate, he wouldn’t let that opportunity pass.
“Point taken. Although… How can we be sure that there actually is a different smell on that hoodie?” Scorpius questioned.
Feeling Potter’s breath even out and his heartrate calm down, Draco realised he probably wouldn’t sleep anywhere else than on this sofa tonight. He very slowly released one hand to grab his wand, transfigured the sofa into something more like a bed, and summoned a blanket. Potter twisted at the loss of contact. Draco laid himself down, carefully pulling Potter along and covered them with the blanket. Potter kept trying to push himself closer, so Draco put Potter’s head on his arm and curled his own body around the smaller man. When Potter’s half unconscious body was still moving around, Draco enveloped his arm around Potter’s waist, pulling him flush against his own body and holding him as tight as Potter so evidently needed.
“I have a hard time believing that. And there is nothing wrong with saying ‘I love you’ while eating chocolate.”
“No, we all did. Some of us just liked to pretend they didn’t. Come off it, papa, you aren’t dense enough to think we hadn’t noticed. You go to a beach and be all cute and cuddly afterwards? That’s nothing like you.”
A smile took over Potter’s face and his eyes started to twinkle a bit. “Did you know she is an amazing girl? She is so clever and funny. I adore her.”
And I guess that after the contents of this chapter, I am *not* forgiven anymore. Whoops. My hand slipped.
“No, really, Malfoy, it will work. This way, we will be connected, just like you were with Cassie. You will feel my heartbeat, and I will feel yours, and my heartbeat will power yours.”
He nodded at Harry before following the other Aurors out of the building, Alissa, Laurentia and guards in tow.
It took Draco a while before he understood. The thanks he sent Potter’s way this morning, via Albus. “Please don’t talk about it. It was humiliating enough to have to thank you with actual words.”
Potter looked at him with an unreadable expression. He shook it off, though, and the two of them had shallow, easy conversation for the rest of the meal.
“I can remember an instance where I sent an origami bird, but it was by no means kindly meant. What did that note of Suzanne say?”
Healer Thornbecke nodded. “It sounds awful, but it isn’t hopeless, sir. Far from it. He will get over it and be healthy again in no time. We will of course check on him as often as possible and there are many monitoring charms around him. We will be alerted immediately if he would need more care.”
“Formally disowning includes a lot of paperwork. This paperwork needs even more paperwork to be overruled. It can be undone, but that barely ever happens.”
That Friday, during the experimental potion brewing with Neville’s ingredients, Theresa couldn’t stop talking about the Quidditch game between Slytherin and Gryffindor that would happen the next day. It was better than having her question every interaction between Draco and Potter, but still, it grated on Draco’s nerves. Luckily, he was spared from answering, since James had taken Theresa’s enthusiasm as a challenge, and made sure to be at least as excited.
“But you would have remembered that. She wouldn’t have killed herself saying she was alone if she had a sister.”
“The job is fantastic, I’ll give you that. Remember how much I loved explaining Potions to you guys? It’s like that, only now, people are actually listening to me.” Pansy laughed heartily.
Without stalling, he moved to McGonagall’s office, sure that she would call the Ravenclaw Head of House. When he got in, he dropped both students in two uncomfortable seats in front of a desk and pulled up a sofa for himself.
If it had been a film, Draco would have enjoyed the obvious power play, but now that it centred on his own trial, he couldn’t see the positive sides of it. George had scooted a bit closer to Draco so the latter could hear his breathing and the tension radiating from him.
“But I don’t care. As long as we don’t talk about it, we are wonderful together. We have so much fun!”
And these were the moods in which the rest of the evening passed, until Pansy and Blaise finally decided to go home, and Potter left Draco with a few soft pats on his shoulder. Draco climbed in bed and slept deeply and satisfactorily.
“Bad morning?” Albus asked politely. Draco nodded, while Albus added: “Even with Terence and Priscus gone?”
“Suzanne Phillis, Gryffindor fifth year,” Draco supplied immediately. Theresa began laughing, clapping her hands happily.
He caught his mother’s gaze and she smiled. After this, Draco turned away before Lucius could say anything else. It was done.
Draco sighed, passing Potter to lead the way again. “Let’s find out.” Potter noticed that his hands were trembling, but he held his back straight and eyes focused forward. His steps were unhesitating, but his back muscles were clenching and unclenching as if he was trying to relax. He was terrified, Potter knew, but he couldn’t think of anything to calm him down. If only they would have rings on their fingers now, it would make it much easier. Just something tangible, to –
“Dear Godric, no. She is now breaking other people’s bones. She gets in fights almost every day since the trials, and I can’t imagine it getting less now that I’m in here.”
Scoffing, Narcissa picked up the paper from the table and leafed through it. “I am already holding the paper, and you are not, Lucius. Let me.” With a smile and a squeeze in Draco’s hand, she started reading.
After a while, Potter sighed and moved to the other chair. He sighed again when he sat down, and huffed a second later.
Draco grimaced. “I kept it a secret for about four years. Severus was the only one who knew, and he found out only after three years.”
While he was talking, he jumped around in the laboratory to grab whichever ingredient he was thinking about in that moment.
Meanwhile, Potter had sat down at the High Table and opened his letter from Pansy. There were three pages.
Draco pushed Theresa to the side so he could finish the potion and start cleaning the utensils they didn’t need anymore.
“Well, I was wondering… You’ve always seemed to be quite attached to the Manor. So, if your mother would have passed away, would you live there?”
Potter was indeed later than Draco. While Aquila was picked up by Matias, and the other three went in together, Draco waited in the Great Hall for Potter to come down. A few students greeted him, and a few girls stayed to talk to him.
Deciding that it couldn’t really be a bad thing, Harry settled down next to Malfoy and started reading the letter.
When he threw the door open, he was glad to notice all students were seated at their desks, and not flinging spells around.
Potter took a bite and closed his eyes in bliss. “This is incredible,” he said softly. “Where did you buy this?”
“Of course I’m bloody rambling, I just found out you are in love with me!” Potter shouts, not so calmly.
“No, your mother thought it’d be wiser if I stayed home. You know how I get in political discussions,” Lucius grumbled. “Apparently, it’s not proper to fight an organisation on their standings on an event like this.”
When he walked through the doors of the Great Hall, he saw Potter already sitting in the seat which would be his usual spot, apparently. Draco suppressed a sigh.
Sighing, Draco snuggled into the corner of the sofa he was sitting on for more comfort and took a sip of his wine.
“It most certainly is not,” Draco called back. “I can’t remember having agreed to any rules. Hence, there is no cheating involved.” He looked over his shoulder and saw Potter hovering nearby, only following Draco where he was going. He couldn’t even see the Snitch, because of Draco’s shadow.
Aquila, Cassie, Phi, Albus and Lily all shrugged to indicate they wouldn’t mind so much, but Scorpius stared at James.
“Except for those few years of stupidity,” Scorpius cut in, rolling his eyes. “Not that we mind, of course, but you can’t say you’ve always done the right thing. Now, are there any other pranging matters we should address, or can we continue with tonight’s plan?”
“Then the most regular robes you have. I don’t need Sprout fawning over me again, because I’m wearing something fancy.”
“Yes. Of every Malfoy heir, we have a portrait of himself, a portrait of their family in the main drawing room, and a portrait of their family in front of the house. It records the entire line and their changes to our home. For example, Septimus Malfoy, my grandfather, was Minister of Magic in the early nineteenth century.”
As he said this, they entered the greenhouses, where Neville was lovingly petting the branch of the Whomping Willow. The branch seemed to be humming contently, but shot up when they came in. Neville turned around.
Comments are cool on AO3, or if you want, on Tumblr (also about any other thing you might want to talk about, because I love talking to people): i-am-and-proud
The only two times Draco had gotten angry this school year, was with Terence and Priscus, and the time when Potter had insulted Pansy.
“Papa…” His daughter sounded exasperated, which was actually kind of scary and adorable at the same time. “Promise me you’ll go to Hogsmeade with them some time?”
Cassie squeezed the hand he was still holding. She smiled at him, right before the figure started moving their way. Draco Apparated, hoping with all his might that his aim had been correct and that Cassie indeed was strong enough and –
by any chance? Apologies, son, my hearing is not what it used to be. Ah yes, I have seen the Malfoy lad. Just to be clear, you do mean the man of your age, yes? Not one of his children?”
“Because this is a family meeting, and pregnancy and engagements are priority number one in family meetings,” Roxane said.
Draco started to grin uncontrollably. “Yes, I know she is all that. I’ve known her for twelve years now,” he winked.
“Probably, yes. He wanted to ask you to write out your side of the case, but then Harry found out that you weren’t allowed to send any letters, so he assured us that he will come by as soon as he can arrange it.”
“Er, yes. Well, sort of. The Malfoy-Potter crest will be used for personal business, but everything concerning the Malfoy estates and businesses within and outside of the United Kingdom should still be handled with the Malfoy name.”
The kind embrace Narcissa gave Potter and his children, was enough to charm a smile on Potter’s face too.
“So within a year, you managed to forget all the hateful things Mr. Malfoy has done to you, your loved ones and people you have never heard of? Within a year, you got chubby with him and call him ‘loving’, ‘generous,’ and ‘wonderful’?”
Scorpius and Cassiopeia were now at the front of the line with the second verse, belting out the lyrics, taking confident, measured out steps, before they too split apart and went to Slytherin and Gryffindor.
He had picked out one of his ‘don’t-mess-with-me’ robes; black, well-fitted robes with filling in the shoulders and made of a very expensive and beautiful material. His children were already in the Great Hall, except for Ophiuchus.
“Master Draco,” the elf greeted. He led the way to the Winter parlour, where Draco’s mother was reading.
“And you can’t protect him by killing someone. It’ll only get worse. The things they’ll say about Draco – even after his death – will only get worse. Swallow your anger and use it to fuel your energy.”
Waving his hand to indicate the buzz and chaos, George grinned. “The usual. Oh, we have a few presents for Phi, if you don’t mind. And Molly made him a cake. Is that okay?”
“You did well, though. I have never seen James work so hard for any course. And that’s not because he’s lazy or stupid.”
Wordlessly, Draco accio’ed a larger candle and waved it on, so they had better light to read the essays. The little crinkle between Potter’s eyes disappeared, was replaced by a slight uptilt of the corners of his mouth. Potter scrunched his nose up twice before he sneezed, then shook his head almost imperceptibly, and went on marking. He had finished three entire essays when he looked up, right into Draco’s eyes.
Cassie crowded close to Draco, who had now turned to face the group of men. His face was impassive, not a sign of emotion or being affected by it.
“If you have insults, you can come to me at the end of this class, as well. Right now, you are disrupting my class. And how very brave of you, to say something like that anonymously, Lazarus,” Draco said dismissively. Lazarus snorted.
“Exactly. So you don’t have to worry about that, yet. Let’s celebrate Christmas and New Year’s Eve, first, shall we?”
Potter cursed feelingly. Checking his map, he saw that Draco’s name wasn’t anywhere in the vicinity. The hunter in the portrait tittered about the magnificence of the door and asked every few sentences whether Potter had found the Malfoy lad already.
“It isn’t a metaphor. This is a magical house, Mr. Potter, made with magic and held up by magic. The house absorbs the different signatures, which is how the wards can recognise which changes to allow and which to reject as soon as possible. The interaction between magical paintings and the magic of the bricks has been intensively researched in the early ages.”
Theresa shook her head in disbelief. “She has been pining for years. Poor Suzanne, she must think you were just playing with her!”
A vicious grin appeared, making Zarnel suddenly very ugly. “Oh dear, I just realised. How did you feel when you found out Scorpius wore the Dark Mark as well? Did that hurt? I bet it must have. You have tried so hard to
“Now, James,” Mr. Malfoy started. “I am good at brewing, but I have no idea how to make a counterpotion. Do you know?”
It was silent until Potter started talking. “You once said you knew when Cassie will have a nightmare. How do you know?”
“There is one unofficial rule that I haven’t mentioned yet. Because we Slytherins have to stick together, one thing is more important than anything else. Secrets are to keep. Things people tell you, as a Housemate, cannot be told further. As most second-and-up students know, there is something called ‘Slytherin House Secrets’, usually abbreviated to SHS. These secrets are things every Slytherin knows, or is allowed to know. But  no one outside these walls may hear about it. There is even magic involved, in case you might be tempted to spill the secret. Only the bearer of the Secret can decide who else knows. Every other who tries to tattle, will be hunted by their worst fears. It is an institution installed by Salazar Slytherin himself. It is an essential part of being a Slytherin.
Draco arched an eyebrow. “You do know that Astoria and I only married for mutual political benefit, right? Our parents pushed for it. I tend to men, you know, and I needed an heir. She wanted money,” Draco said carefully.
C’est la langue de nos ancêtres. Et c’est très élégant, non -> It's the language of our ancestors. And it's very elegant, isn't it?
Draco took a breath. “Why do I have so many loud friends,” he groaned to himself, wincing when Seamus chose that exact moment to give a loud roar of laughter on one of Dean’s jokes.
“I was,” Scorpius said, “because of my own mistakes. When a person turns, they trash around. It hurts, the reshaping of one’s bones. Especially because no werewolf turns voluntarily, and they often try to fight it. Every time that I was hurt, it was because I stayed too close during the turning. It was my fault, every time.”
“Ah, Mr. Potter. No, no I have not seen any Malloys here. I’m not sure I’m familiar with that name.”
Potter is looking at him, like he expects an answer. To what? Yes, he thanked him. All the thanks he gets today are getting to his head.
The Aurors left and Auror Smiths stood guard again at the door. After a minute or five, Doctor Selaminder walked in, wearing a stern expression.
“Slytherins may not have liked the man much,” Draco explained at Potter’s happily confused expression. “But we know when to appreciate what we’ve learned. It’s a gift.”
“Cassie? Love?” he tried. Cassie’s mop of hair moved as if she was shaking her head, which she probably was. Draco sat on the edge of the bed, carding his fingers through her hair. He saw the miniscule movements of Cassie’s shoulders, indicating that she most likely was suppressing her sobs.
“Mr. Malfoy. You are charged with mistreatment and abuse of your children. Concluding from our research and various testimonies, the charges have been placed in pattern with former offenses of the law, being your history as a Death Eater and supporter of Voldemort. What do you plead?”
have a thing for freckly gingers. I mentioned before how good-looking Charlie has become. In fact, I may have a crush on him.”
“Draco, what’s going on?” Harry asked, staring the horses in the eye as they came even closer, making him step back until – he stumbled over a fallen tree branch, right with his bum into a pool of mud.
The evening became slower, softer and emptier, since one at a time, everyone went to bed upstairs, or in case of Pansy, Blaise and Greg, grabbed the Floo home. At a certain point, only Draco, Potter, Ron and Hermione remained, but that changed quickly too.
“All right. Salazar Slytherin was a sneaky little bastard. He spent all his time creating halls, rooms and corridors, from where he could control the entire castle. The knowledge of these spaces disappeared through time, until the Dark – Tom Riddle did some research and combined legends from several ancient pureblood families. That’s how he found the Chamber. He allowed a few people with ‘special missions’ to go inside. It was simple actually, Salazar had put strict wards on those areas, and Riddle managed to get through. Then, he altered the wards to allow those with the right knowledge – like a password – and the Mark. After his death, the Mark alone was enough. The point is, ever since our sixth year, I’ve been able to open it. I – did, once or twice. That basilisk is ginormous, by the way, Potter, you’re such a show-off.”
I am so so sorry for taking so long. Some people said I was being distant and absent, and they forbid me to keep writing. I had to write in secret...
“Merlin,” Pansy sighed. “He has three different types of plates. Do you really think he needs extra in case one breaks?”
Potter chuckled. “I noticed, that day of the duel. She knows exactly when to pull out the big guns, doesn’t she?”
At that, Potter grinned widely. “You are such an idiot. You won’t mind if I eat this, would you?” He wriggled himself between Draco and Scorpius on the sofa, shovelling a few bits in his mouth. Draco glared at the fork, following its movements with his eyes.
“But I can’t just visit him, since we never really met. I saw him a couple times, and I know he needs help, but I can’t visit him.”
“Merlot is fine, thank you. But I think you should give that Firewhiskey to Neville, he doesn’t have a drink yet.”
Draco took a deep breath, desperately searching for something to say. Grasping at his self-control and facial mask, he placed down his glass of Butterbeer and tilted his chin up. He was more than happy to have only taken one sip, because at least the babbling wouldn’t be so terrible.
Cassie nodded. With a little difficulty, she wound her arms around the pot, trying to lift it up. The plant wound some of her branches around Cassie’s shoulders, bristling a bit before settling down again. Neville looked on with a fond expression, while Draco was mostly gobsmacked.
As Harry looked around, he saw more and more little things in the garden that were undoubtedly Draco’s doing. He didn’t know much about gardening, but the dark ivy that clung to the house’s wall seemed something Draco would like. It twirled around the balustrade of a balcony. Framing the balcony were yellow rambler roses, enthusiastically flowering. The balcony doors were open and provided Harry with a peek into what appeared to be Draco’s bedroom.
“Oh no, never mind that. You practically are family now, aren’t you? I hear you’ve taken the double last name. Malfoy-Potter. Who would have thought!”
to say that papa is guilty,” Scorpius was addressing the Wizengamot now, “then I will personally go to Azkaban, until everyone agrees that no one is better for his children than Draco Malfoy. Thank you.”
“Hold on. You knew about all of this?” he asked Draco, holding Albus tight in a protective embrace. “You
At a certain point, he saw that Aquila looked very downtrodden, more so than she had been previously. He flicked his wand and
“Yes, but Scorpius has that as well. Scorpius is a manipulative little bastard. He is so subtle that most people don’t notice they have been manipulated into doing what he wants, until it’s too late. He could rule the world with a flick of his fingers, if he wanted to.”
When the Boggarts were released, it was chaos for a few seconds, until students started to get a hang of casting the Riddikulus spell. A few were definitely having fun with conjuring the most hilarious scenes, which made Draco chuckle a few times. He cast a look at Albus and Scorpius and saw them having a bit more trouble.
Headmistress McGonagall was the first to see them, and she greeted them with a worried frown. “Harry told me. He’s just about to tell the children. If you go up to Draco’s apartment, you’ll find them. Neville is there as well.”
“I’m glad you can joke about your former obsession with me, Malfoy. It shows you have grown up,” Potter remarked dryly.
“Right,” Draco mumbled. Then he continued in a louder voice, “Last time I was there, I managed to get her out of the office for a moment. I cast a searching spell on my last name, and there was a massive amount of documents about the name Malfoy. I wasn’t able to read them, because I think everything is heavily warded, but maybe I can pry a bit deeper and find something new.”
“None of that now. We want to hear all about your new job. The apartment is very charming. And I believe the dungeons are redone?”
Draco balled his fist and leaned forward. “Could you tone it down?” he hissed, signing to the other professors that were still talking to each other.
Phi fidgeted. “I know, I’m sorry. I mean… er…. Papa, I don’t mean to, but I’m excited. I’m sorry about your clothes. Can I do anything to help?”
“All right,” Draco grinned. “Well, that person is obviously rather good with spells. It can’t be a first or second year, because the magic is far too complicated. I’d say fifth year or up. That is a hint, by the way. At the same time, this person is still interested in the love perils of… the couple this SHS is about.”
“He slept in the most uncomfortable chairs. Can you imagine? Lucius Malfoy’s son?” Pansy smiled fondly.
“If I may believe the Malfoy registers, which are possibly biased, it was because Elisabeth didn’t want her children to be magical. She was muggleborn, and she had found how unwanted she was as a witch. That is why she never married at all, never got any children. But as I said, that may be the story the Malfoys made up to cover up their rejection.”
Draco felt rather than saw the muscles in Scorpius’s cheeks twitch into a smile. Holding him closer to his own body, Draco started to jog in the highest speed he could do without tiring too fast, squeezing his way through the crowd.
“No, he hasn’t. It’s just my brilliant skill of noticing the tiniest details. The rest doesn’t know,” George assured him. “At least, I think they don’t. But thanks, by the way. I take it as a compliment, you crushing on me.”
So, Phi smiled at Potter and settled on a chair next to Potter’s. Before he could say anything, Potter opened his mouth to ask Phi, “Is your papa still angry at me?”
Cassie’s words stung, but the way she only pressed closer and clenched her fists in Draco’s shirt and hair was enough for Draco to forgive her instantly and wrap his arm around her even tighter. He laid her head on his chest, which Cassie took as an invite to crawl almost on top of him in an effort to be even closer.
At the same time, Cassie had occupied her papa’s chair at the High Table, because she wanted to talk to Potter. McGonagall had disapproved, but when she smiled sweetly and promised that it was about an assignment she didn’t understand, McGonagall caved for her charm and allowed it.
Another laugh. Draco swallowed, but smirked a bit at himself. He wasn’t sure whether he had really just flirted with Potter, but it seemed like it.
Draco sighs softly. Professor McGonagall ended her speech, and was rewarded with a round of respectful applause. She places the Sorting Hat on a stone, so everyone can see it. The Sorting Hat says something, only to be heard for the Professor. Professor McGonagall nods and prepares herself to speak again.
“Of course.” Scorpius grinned again, winking at Potter who suddenly narrowed his eyes at Draco’s clothing and frowned. “And you, Harry?”
In the end, it had taken Scorpius another full week after he was taken off sedatives to wake up. And when he finally woke up, Draco hadn’t been there for him. He had just arrived at St. Mungo’s and dawdled in front of Scorpius’s door when he heard voices.
“Most students don’t particularly need to learn how to counter a Boggart, since it’s not an everyday occurrence,” Draco rolled his eyes. He heard Potter sigh beside him, but he refused to look.
“Draco! I haven’t seen you in here since your admission. Come to tell me new secrets?” Neville grinned. He smiled at Cassie and gave her his sprayer. Without questioning, she walked towards one corner of the greenhouse – immediately hidden by massive plants – and did whatever she was supposed to do.
“Well, Ginny was married to another gay man for more than a decade. Who know, she could be wrong about Dean’s sexuality as well.”
A few protests later, Draco half-lied on the couch with closed eyes and an arm thrown above his head, humming a soft tune. When Molly’s voice sounded, he shot up and sat ram-rod straight, causing Potter to grab his stomach from laughter.
Greg wrung his hands. “Yeah, I guess. I guess it’s something Riddle used to punish those Death Eaters that didn’t support him at his second coming.
“If I hadn’t forgiven you already, I would do so after that speech of yours,” Potter said with a choked voice. “I thought you recognised me in the Manor, but I wasn’t sure. Why didn’t you hand me in?”
Draco saw James plucking at his shirt, and Phi, who had crossed the room, was leaning heavily against him. Potter kept silent, watching his oldest son a bit worriedly.
Cassie nodded jerkily. She gave Draco another hug, after which she ran through the hallways to the twins that had already left for their dorms.
“Anything wrong?” he snapped when the tension became too much. Potter immediately straightened his back and turned to his plate.
When Draco kept silent, George touched his hand –with no interruption from Smiths, because he was humane enough to know that Draco needed
Potter nodded, repeating what Ophiuchus told him in a soft murmur. “So he only hides his negative emotions?”
Rolling his eyes, Draco grinned. “I don’t know, how might that resemble me, Potter? What do you think?”
And it's not Boxing Day anymore, but let's play pretend. I tried to upload on the correct days, but life got in the way. Sorry :(
Draco agreed happily. “I would never allow that myself. And the moment I hear him causing any trouble anywhere, he won’t go there again. I promise I will make sure he won’t disrupt classes.”
“I understand why you have a car, however odd it may be, but why nine places if you only have four children?”
The high note was hit perfectly, and Draco continued it for a long time, without losing his breath. When he finished singing, his face and posture had taken on something much more determined, much fiercer than was necessary for entertainment.
“Oh come on. You always thought he was fun; the twins were the only Weasleys you didn’t despise. You were one of the rare people who knew who was Fred and who was George. George was good at Quidditch, which I am sure you appreciated. He isn’t terrible to look at, he is very clever and ambitious. And don’t think I didn’t notice how you looked at him when you talked to him at the Wheezes, a few weeks ago,” Potter summed up.
“Because it’s stable –“ Another round of giggling. “- and when I pulled it up, I didn’t want a magical constructor to come around. You would have gotten suspicious.”
“You really want the ins and outs?” Draco asked incredibly. He was not looking forward to a conversation like that.
“What do you mean by ‘the worst of them’?” he demanded. “You don’t come to me with every nightmare you have?”
A massive brown Blakiston Fish Owl flew their way, and Draco held out his arm to invite the bird to sit on that, instead of landing on the table. The owl landed on his forearm, just like she was trained to do. With a quick movement, Draco gave her a treat and took the letter from her claw.
Potter remained quiet for a while, after which he cleared his throat on a hum. “What you’re saying is that we should hurry up before they get to Aquila. Which I totally agree with, to be honest. But our plan is instable. We can’t move things along any more than we are already doing.”
Harry held up his hands. “I didn’t know anything about it. Why didn’t I know? I could have helped you around Muggle London, you know. Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked Draco.
motivation.” Hermione smiled when she saw Draco’s pondering expression. “Just – just follow your heart, yeah? That’s always a good thing to do.”
James turned around and sniffed the fumes above the cauldron. “It’s a bit vague, actually. But there is something salty in there, like walking along the seashore. And I think it might be a bit flowery.”
Neville looked at him, with a clear question in his eyes. Draco looked back. “If you wanted me to…” he started. Neville began to smile. “… I could test out some theories. But I would need help of your Curse Breaker-friends. There’s a spell that needs to be adapted and changed.”
“Oh let me!” Cassie demanded impatiently. She grabbed the Ball and asked, “Which Chocolate Frog cards are the most uncommon?”
He was cut off by a surprised yelp of Aquila. She was pursing her lips again, eyes wide, muscles tensed. Draco’s face was drawn together in pain of having to see his daughter subjected to the Cruciatus Curse, again.
Between the main course and desert, Harry put his hand on Draco’s shoulder and shook him gently. “Get yourself out of this strop, Draco. You’ll be fine.”
Narrowing his eyes at Potter, Draco racked his brain to find the reason why Potter would know all this. “How much have my children told you?” he ended up saying.
“I’m Priscus Belby, fourteen, former student of Professor Malfoy and House- and classmate of the twins.”
“You couldn’t have heard that, the magical spheres were soundproof. Never mind, I mean that we can’t get the branch, because Neville doesn’t want us to. I’m not going to take one of his plants without his permission.”
Laughing and setting up another cauldron for the asphodel roots and alihotsy leaves, Draco shook his head. “Somehow, I get the idea that you think I’m in a relationship with him.”
“It will take some time. He has been hit hard. His nose was broken, together with two ribs, and he had a lot of bruises. He lost some blood. We managed to heal his nose and one of his ribs, but the other was too fractured to heal in one sitting. We will keep working on that the next couple of days.”
Also, it's not very well written this time, because I wrote it in small bits, spread out over four weeks and it's much better to write in one long flow, so... yeah, good luck xD
Scorpius sent him a grateful smile and sneaked to his own dorm, where he would probably tell Albus all about it.
“You lost your brother. Not just your brother, though, your other half. You were attached to the hip. You did everything together, and now, you have to do it alone. That’s tough. Your siblings, your parents can’t imagine the pain you went through.”
Draco smiled when the results told him that this potion also worked. He and Theresa were almost finished with the project, though Draco hadn’t had the heart to tell his apprentice that yet. Theresa had improved significantly during their time together, in control of her movements and ability to brew even the most difficult potions under pressure.
Potter laughed, a bit surprised. “Okay, okay. This is difficult for me too, you know. Let me see. Something that hasn’t been in the papers, not a simple fact. How about… I liked Transfigurations class.”
“Really, papa, it isn’t that bad. Look.” He rolled up his sleeve and showed the scar. A few faint lines were visible, only remotely identifiable as the Dark Mark. A churning feeling in Draco’s stomach seized up, before it calmed again. He looked at the ceiling for a second, silently thanking whatever deity was up there.
“I bet five sickles that Draco is doing his puzzles now,” Pansy said, offering up her hand for Greg and Blaise to slap on if they wanted to take the bet.
During dinner, Draco was able to ignore Potter. It wasn’t because Draco was angry; he wasn’t, not really. He just didn’t know what to do. To be quite honest, he had usurped all his courage by coming back this morning and greeting Albus the way he had. He was exhausted and terrified of all reactions, not only of his children and Potter, but also of the Hogwarts students and Potter’s friends.
“True. You liked everything connected to magic, except for History of Magic. You could even appreciate Potions, when everything went correctly.”
“Fine. You know Cassie’s got a bad arm, right? She got that during birth. She was positioned wrongly, and the twisting and turning hurt her arm. I don’t know if you know this, but when wizarding children get hurt, there is this burst of magic as an expression of their pain. The same happened during Cassie’s birth. The sudden magic clashed massively with Astoria’s magical signature, creating some kind of magical blockade. The Healers couldn’t get through the blockade to see how she was doing. If this kind of thing happens, they have one solution. They call for someone with a compatible magical signature as the child and perform a spell. They have people hired for this kind of core magic, people with high compatibility potential.”
“That’s too bad. Aren’t you curious to know what Professor Flitwick would think of it?” Priscus now narrowed his eyes in suspicion. He was catching on to what Draco was doing.
