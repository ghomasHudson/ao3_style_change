Harry looked around the room. It was a big enough room for 2 people. It had one big bed and a small table with a chair. There was also space for their trunks.
When Harry finally got to the common room, breakfast was already over. “Seriously mate! Now we have to go to potions on an empty stomach.” Ron said(more like yelled). Hermione rolled her eyes. “Is food all you think about?” They started to bicker as per usual. Harry tried to tune them out. “Guys shut up! Snape will kill us if we’re late so let’s go.” They made it to the dungeons in time, but Snape still took off points. “Potter, you’ll sit with Malfoy today.” Harry looked at Draco and Draco sneered. This was going to be a horrible class.
Harry and Draco got back to their room. Draco sat down on the sofa and Harry sat next to him. “So, Malfoy, truce?” Draco turned his head to look at Harry. “Why?” Harry sighed and said, “We are stuck together, so we should at least be civil, it'll make this easier.” Draco looked like he was thinking things over. Finally he made a decision, “Alright Potter, we can have a truce until we get fixed. This doesn’t mean we are friends!” Harry rolled his eyes and nodded.
I do not own Harry Potter in any way, shape or form. I don't own the characters or setting. I only own this story and this plot.
Hi! Sorry for not updating in a while. I had a lot of school work and stuff going on. I will probably update next week because it is Thanksgiving break for me. :)
Harry got up and started walking towards the door. “Where are you going Potter?” Harry replied, “Call me Harry and I'm not staying here all day.” Harry grabbed Draco and pulled him to the door. “C’mon Draaaco! We don’t have work, so you can’t make excuses.” Draco rolled his eyes and made a face when Harry said his name. They’d called each other different names for years, so this would take some getting used to.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s last thought before he fell asleep was ‘stupid git’.
“Harry….stuck!?...Malfo….fix....days?!” Harry could hear snippets of conversation. It sounded like Hermione, Ron and someone else. Harry peeled open his eyes and got a blast of brightness. “He’s waking up.” Was that Mione? Oomph! “Mione, you’re gonna kill him.” Thank goodness for Ron. Seriously how can someone so small be so strong! “Hey guys!” Was I in the hospital wing? “How long have I been out and what happened?” Ron wasn’t looking him in the eyes. “Guys, what?” Hermione said, “Well you got knocked out by a poison disaster. It was an accident.” Ron’s eyes widened. “ACCIDENT! It was not an accident. Crabbe threw something into Nevilles cauldron.” Harry thought that made more sense. “Well when can I leave?” Harry was itching to get out of the hospital wing. He never liked it. It reminded him of when he was with the Dursley’s before he found out he was a wizard. “Mr.Potter, you may leave once Professor Dumbledore gets here,” said Madam Pomfrey.  Harry scrunched up his nose. Why would Dumbledore need to come see him for a small injury? He looked up at his friends and was about to ask them when Dumbledore walked in through the doors. “Hello professor! Ron and I were just leaving, right Ron?” Ron looked at me with a sorry look, “Yah, bye Harry.” They left and Dumbledore sat down next to Harry. “Professor, why are you here?” He looked at Harry and said, “To talk to you about sleeping arrangements Harry.” Now Harry was really confused! “Sleeping arrangements? For what?” Dumbledore looked excited for some reason. “For you and Mr.Malfoy of course.” WHAT!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry wake up mate.” Ron said. “HARRY!” That came from a higher pitched voice.
Harry and Draco were walking towards their new room. They were going to get their own room because they were the only 2 from the class that weren’t stuck with someone from their own house. “Potter! Do you even know where we’re going?” Draco did not want to go anywhere with Harry. “Yes Malfoy, I do! If you could just shut up for 5 minutes, we would probably already be there.” Malfoy had been talking the entire time they were going to the room. “Okay Malfoy, we’re here.” They were standing outside a huge door in a hallway near the kitchens. “Well, how do we get in?” Harry rolled his eyes. “How do you think Malfoy? There’s a password. Oddsbodkins!” The door opened with a slight noise. This room hadn’t been used in a long time. “Great, we have our own rooms. I hope to never see you near mine Potter!” Draco tried to walk to his room and focus on the word tried. “Aagh! MALFOY! Did you forget that we are stuck together? We can’t go any more than 3 feet apart from each other!” Draco made a face of horror as he asked, “Then how are we supposed to take baths and sleep?! And how do they expect us to go to our classes?!” Harry got up from where he had fallen on the floor and said, “I don’t know Malfoy. Dumbledore is going to talk to all the fifth year Gryffindors and Slytherin at dinner tonight. Look at least we get a good room.”
Hadrian wished sometimes, when he was really desperate (or maybe it was depressed), that he would be liked by the people around him. But then he remembers that they would only care for his sister or his money, not the fact that he prefers neither Quidditch or his studies, or that he only wishes to open a small bookshop in one of the remote wizarding villages that are scattered across the Alps.
Hadrian hummed a tune to himself that he was sure was a muggle song, but paid no attention to the people that studied around him. Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees a shock of blonde hair and green robes, meaning that Draco Malfoy was in the school library.
"Why is a student here?" Hadrian asked calmly, but was seething behind his masks. He knew that Jasmine would be in the meeting, but that did not mean Hadrian could not insult her.
But it did not matter. Jasmine had told Lavender that her brother betrayed the Potter family by courting a Slytherin and watched as they decided to hunt after her brother.
It took only a few more moments until Hadrian was fully dress, looking like a pureblood in casual robes.
Hermione looked up from the book that she was reading. "Jasmine, Hadrian is a Slytherin. If you want your retaliation to make an impact, then you will have to take something close to him, or steal something he wants before he can get it."
"Come in." The Headmaster said from inside, his kind, grandfather-like voice was being used to try and fool Hadrian. But Hadrian was no fool.
"Thank you, Professor. Where will I be meeting Lily and James?" Hadrian pulled on a Slytherin green robe that would put the three Gryffindor Potters on edge.
"Goodnight, Hadrian. I wish you happy dreams." Draco said as Hadrian went up the stairs to his dorm.
Jasmine thought of what Hermione said, but could not decipher what the girl meant.
When they parted, both of the teens were panting and smiling at each other.
"My parents tried to corner me after I left the library. I was wondering why they were acting like they needed something from me." Hadrian scoffed to himself. "They probably want to use me to get information about the 'Dark Side'."
"I hope so."
"Who is it?" Hadrian asked as he pulled himself out of his bed and began to dress himself.
Hadrian only relaxed when his back hit his the silk sheets of his bed in his dorm.
Draco pulled him close to kiss Hadrian on the forehead. "I will see you later tonight, yes?"
"I am sorry for my actions, they were... unnecessary. I thank you for coming to meet with me." Draco spoke softly, which was a big contrast to the way he acted around everyone else. "But I have taken a liking to you, Hadrian, and I wish to court you. If our courtship does not work out, or you find interest in another, I will let you go."
"Harry! I was looking for you! Mom and Dad want to talk to you!" Jasmine Potter said, smiling when she said the nickname he hated.
"Please move, James." The Slytherin said blandly as he was surrounded by Gyffindors. Hadrian's hand tightened on the strap of his school bag as he gave his father a cold glare. "Just because you are my parents does not meant that you have the right to corner me when I am at school. You are my teachers here, not my parents."
"Nevermind." Hermione opened her book again and started to read where she left off.
He placed his left hand over his right, covering the courtship ring subtly, but making himself look proper. He had an act, a façade, that he needed to hold.
"Hadrian," He nearly chocked at hearing his name come from Draco's lips. "Come, sit." A crooked finger gestured him to come forward.
"I will not be your spy, unless you can give me something that will make up for what I could loose." Hadrian stood from his chair, the adults in the room trying to stop him as he walked out the heavy oak door.
Draco pulled a hand through his already messy hair. Standing up from his bed, Draco started to pace and fiddle with his wand,
He tried to make himself look as if he was browsing the shelves, just,
Hadrian was really tempted to walk out on the meeting after Jasmine walked into the room.
"I do. I've seen you and the way you avoid everyone even with the name of a noble house. I admire you for that." Draco said the last part meekly. He blonde took Hadrian's right hand in his, caressing the knuckles and any veins he could see. Draco pulled something from his pocket, and it wasn't until Hadrian could see the glimmer of sliver, white and black that he knew what it was.
Is Draco trying to use him to get to his family? What if Draco was only using him for a publicity stunt? Is Draco still betrothed to one of the Greengrass girls?
"We should go to bed, we will need the sleep." Hadrian said while looking into Draco's silver eyes.
"Is that my goodnight kiss, oh mighty King of Slytherin?" Hadrian joked as Draco pulled him into his arms.
After all, they had only been courting for less than a day. Draco had not even asked Hadrian on a date yet, or gifted the other boy something.
The Slytherin sighed as he flopped down onto one of the larger couches, picking up one of his books that was sitting on a wooden end table. He read the sentence that he had left off and quickly put it back. He had no interest in reading about dead languages in the old times where muggle accepted magic.
Plus he would end up stumbling over himself if Draco ever talked to him because something in Hadrian found other males attractive. And Draco was very attractive to him.
The blond rolled his eyes. "What is it Blaise?" He said a little too harshly.
When they pulled away, Hadrian knew that he was blushing.
Ron jolted awake with a snort. "Wha?! I'm up!"
Hadrian sighed woefully as he skimmed over the potions textbook that he had been making notes of, but then stopped. Why was he even making these notes when he wouldn't even need them until the middle of the year? Hadrian groaned in his head, closing the book quietly before tucking it back into his school bag.
Hadrian giggled at Draco's attempt and nodded. "I wanted to let you know that the Potters are waiting for me in the Headmaster's office. I didn't want you to worry if I end up hiding somewhere."
He did not say anything as she escorted him up the stairs. When she knocked on the door, he felt a bead of sweat roll down the back of his neck.
"May I kiss you?" Draco asked after they had stared at each other for so long, but it was not awkward.
"But I'm not a Slytherin! I'm a Gryffindor."
Draco kissed Hadrian's palm before cutting him off. "If you would allow it, I would like for you to meet my parents. And if you want me to meet yours, then I will. I hope that we could do this as a formal courtship, but with the way we have been acting, we won't follow most of the older guidelines."
Sometimes, Hadrian really wishes he could avoid his family like he does other people. But even after he was almost kicked out of the Potter Mansion, his family still had their weird way of trying to show their love for him.
Draco was worried.
"What do you want, Draco? I assume it was not to seduce me." Hadrian sneered and crossed his arms, turning his head away from the other male.
But the words he said were his own worries.
He moved the pad of his thumb over the top of the ring until he could guess which parts were what.
"Yeah."
, Hadrian thought to himself.
The sixth year Slytherin got up from his seat in the library to stroll the shelves, brushing his fingers of the spins, some worn, others almost untouched. Picking a random title from the shelf, he put it back as he saw that it was on the early days of the magical world.
Jasmine Potter fumed as she stomped around the Gryffindor common room, ranting about her little brother to Ron and Hermione.
Hadrian knew that it was Draco sitting there, mainly because he could see pale hands twiddling something.
He hoped that Hadrian was somewhere safe.
Hadrian knew that whatever the old man was planning was not good for anything that he wanted in the future, but he knew nothing could be perfect.
November 15th was that day.
"Harry, Draco Malfoy has plans on courting you." James said bluntly, brown eyes set in a hard glare. Hadrian raised a single eyebrow at his father.
Before leaving the common room, Hadrian stopped at Draco's door, making sure that no one was around. He was not sure if he was ready for everyone to know that he was being courted by Draco.
Those thoughts did not help the feeling in his gut.
"Well, Mom and Dad still want to talk to you!" Jasmine called out, racing to catch up with Hadrian's quick and long strides.
There was a knock at the door, making Hadrian startle from his thoughts.
Draco Malfoy was right next to his table, with no one in sight. None of his Inner Circle was around him, which was unusual, because Blaise Zabini or Theodore Nott were always next to the blonde.
So, instead, he ended up in a hidden tower that only he seemed to know about, which was a thing to be proud about considering the fact that his father had made a map most of Hogwarts.
A sheepish look crossed over Draco's perfect face. "I did, mainly for formality. But I do not care if they give me their blessing for me to with you, because if you wish to be with me, then that is enough."
"And why should I?" Hadrian questioned, and he could see the hesitance in their movements and their eyes.
"Will we be keeping our courtship secret?" Hadrian asked. "And do you wish for me to-"
Even though neither wanted to leave, Hadrian was the first to move from the comfortable chair in front of the fire.
A hand cupped Hadrian's jaw, and he felt any of his mental walls shatter at the simple touch. It was not that he was being touched by Draco, but because he had not felt a kind hand on him for years. He longed to be touched kindly by anyone that was not his family or a person that wanted to blackmail him.
"And? There are always rumors of me courting someone."
Hadrian smiled at his partner's words. The old guidelines said that the first kiss should happen after the third date or the second present. And holding hands or loving touches should only be in private. "I would be fine with meeting your mother and father, Draco. But I don't think my family would be happy with me bringing a Malfoy into 'their sacred home'." Hadrian scoffed. "They practically disowned me after my second year."
He heard Lily choke a gasp and what sounded like a sob came from her lips. She had done that on purpose to try and get Hadrian to react. Hadrian did not turn to her though, keeping his eyes on the portrait behind James.
She did not even bother to tell them that Hadrian was a Slytherin, not a Gryffindor like the rest of her family.
Neither of them moved from their stare, their proclamations seeming to strengthen it. Their foreheads were touching, both of them leaning towards each other.
Did Draco even want him?
Hadrian stepped into Draco's view, taking a seat in the chair closest. The arms of the chairs were close to touching, and he did not know if that was done on purpose or not. Hadrian kept his eyes trained on the fire, even when he wanted to look at the handsome male next to him.
Draco becomes a much more frequent figure in Grimmauld Place. What was once visits that featured awkward tea sipping, is now replaced by steadily heating encounters, involving hungry lips and wandering hands.
The firelight makes the tip of Potter’s hair burn red.
Before he had even turned Omega, Draco had noticed Potter being around him more often than was strictly necessary.  Instances, where he’d catch the other boy looking at him. It was not all together unusual. They were in this awkward state ,where 7 years of animosity had fizzled out in the face off the true hatred war brought about. But at the same time, unable to be friends or just acquaintances, not after everything they've shared, be it good or bad.
Therefore, Draco finds himself taking a seat opposite Potter, in a cozy little pub, in the Muggle side of London. The food is an ordinary fair of steak and mash, but it’s tasty and filling.
It’s the worst thing -- oh dear
“May I?” Draco nods his assent and his breath catches when Potter’s hand- they are indeed feel heavenly and deliciously calloused- comes up to cup his breast. A thumb comes up to massage the soft mound of flesh and passes over his nipple. Draco can’t stop the shudder that passes over him.
The grounds are nothing, compared to the state of his heart.
It’s while before Harry stops being skittish with Draco, stops holding back. Sometime before the heavy looks he used to press onto Draco make an appearance again. Looks that burn and scald, but never hurt. Just fierce enough that Draco knows he’s wanted. Desired. Loved.
About his fear that he’ll never have a life here in England. That he’ll have to leave everything he’d ever known behind, just so he can have something resembling a life…
the first person who asks! ”
Dating Potter is…confusing, to say the least.
“Why you here?”
The last one has Draco firing an
He wants--
He won’t; he needs this to be over with before his already shaky -- cowardly-- heart backs out.
He finds himself thinking of Potter at the most inopportune of moments, quill steadily dripping as he is lost in thought, imagining the texture of Potter’s hair between his fingers. Seeing the ruined Healer application form doesn’t give him pause, not as much as the ache in his lips, missing the press of Potter’s kiss.
Draco also knows that having someone drink from him, preferably an Alpha, will lessen the days he produces milk.
“Potter. What the fuck.”
They talk about the war and their roles in it.
Potter is giddy, as his plan to reintroduce Draco  to his friends was a success. Even Granger -- tough nut, that one -- only seemed to plot his demise once through out the night.
.oOo.
And it really is, Draco thinks, as Harry latter spells splinters out of Draco’s hands, the result of helping shape the block of wood into a chair.
But that could be due to his heart, pounding away like it’s seconds from ripping out from his chest, away from the blank faces of Granger and Weasley.
The second time is even better than the first.
“But Draco, if you could do something so against your will, why can’t you exert the same effort in fixing things with Harry, when the results would be much better for you? Why wont’ you go after your happiness?”
There are sporadic trips to various Wizarding Places, accompanied by tentative touches exchanged when handing over an object or simply to get each other’s attention-- and in one memorable instance -- Potter sneaking a kiss to the corner of his lips, in the guise of cleaning up icing Draco missed.
Draco is sure that they would have tried again, and it was only a matter of time before he was overwhelmed, be it via their numbers, or by catching him unawares.
Potter raises a hand to cradle Draco’s face. A warm thumb traces the sharp edge of his cheekbone. He knows his eyes must be wide, surprised -- and possibly -- terrified, for Potter softly inquires if it was okay, if Potter may kiss him.
It takes a long time for Draco to sleep that night.
Potter calms enough that his magic looses the grip it has on the orbiting clock, and it comes crashing down.
They rut against each other, frenzied, desperate for something, trying to get
Any self respecting Slytherin, in fact, even a wart-infested troll, would tell him to go along with it, and trolls were not know for their intelligence.
His heart pounds as he Floos over, wondering if Potter is waiting for him, ready to pounce the moment he steps put of the fire, just like the last time.
“My mother--”, Draco clears his throat and pushes on, “--she always said the best way to get over emotional turmoil, is to eat. The greasier the better. Or in a pinch all the sweets you can find.”
One moment they’re at the foyer, the next they’re in Potter’s bed, clumsy hands ripping of each other’s clothes.
And moving on with life for Draco Malfoy meant going back to Hogwarts as a way to fulfill his sentence. With Potter's testimony- much to Draco's everlasting shock-  he was given a full pardon with the caveat that wrong doings of
Potter’s eyes bore into him when he says, “ I don’t care about what they say about me. It’s you I was worried about. The reason I wanted us to keep our relationship quiet, was to protect you, to keep you from being dragged into the rubbish I have to put up with.”
And Potter looks up from his quiet contemplation of his chocolate frog cards and says
He doesn’t have to do this. He can just keep this to himself. No one else needs to know. Nothing has to change. They can keep living their life as it is and if Draco feels guilty, if he feels horrible from time to time, well he only has to work extra hard at being the lover that Harry deserves, doesn’t he?
The dinner, against all odds, contrary to eight years of antagonism, was a success.
Draco hums, saying, “I don’t know. It could be better.”
and then milk slowly trickles out of his nipple.
Maybe Draco is not that cursed after all.
"Yes , I'm sure Potter."
watches as the raven haired man tugs on unruly locks and slants him a burning glance that Draco doesn’t comprehend.
Potter approaches him two days before they're set to graduate.
In his sixth year, he’s repairing a cabinet in order to save his family, but doesn’t fully understand what it means to bring murderers and vagabonds to a school full of children. Not until it’s too late.
In some ways, it was better to have been the tortured, than the torturer. He thinks Granger would beg to differ.
Potter says yes, and Draco can’t help himself, he wants to kiss this boy. So he does.
“You should go.”
He has to hand it to Potter. When he decided on something, he stood by it, and woe betide anyone who sought to dissuade him.
“You want to nurse from me.” Draco fights not to blush at this. Potter’s eyes skitter away, but not fast enough to hide the hunger in his eyes. Draco swallows hard. “And I owe you a Life Debt. So here’s the deal, you can…have your way with me, and in return, you absolve me of my debt.”
Draco blinks his eyes open, not knowing when he’d closed them.
He presents a long stem of it to Draco , saying
He wants to say that in the past two years, there were times that he felt so empty, so alone, that only roaming the Muggle world, amongst people he considered inferior, pretending to be one of them for periods of time, that he felt a semblance of comfort and acceptance.
But all these were minor annoyances he could deal with. What he could not deal with was the alarming fact that Potter had taken to staring at him. Continuously. Almost religiously so.
year and take his N. E. W. T. S., after which he was to serve a year in service to the Wizarding world doing Ministry assigned jobs before he was officially free.
Lunch at another hole-in-wall pub was delicious, the company even better.
Draco has known Potter for nearly a decade, been his lover for nearly a year, and still, the other man manages to bewilder and surprise him.
So, he picks up his white peacock-tail quill -- for luck -- and begins initiating the conversation for the first time.  He tells Potter that he woke up fine and that he has a craving for candied apples. His flowing script spasms a little when he shares that his mother has taken to staying in bed for longer periods of time…
He finds Harry hard at work, doing something to a chunk of wood that has the muscles of his arms bunching, skin aglow with sweat.
It’s ridiculous. For an Alpha, the boy was acting so fucking timid. He was the Wizarding Hero for Morgana’s sake, you’d think he’d have more grit. Just a few words from from Draco and the Golden Boy is running scared.
But its not nearly enough.
The obvious thing to do -- to aid his plan in using Potter to better his social standing -- is to take him to a place where he can flaunt the other.
“...nothing gained.”
The woman presses close, teeth bared. “Harry may think
In all honesty, Draco doesn’t even mean to break Potter’s nose this time. But it does the charm and Potter shuts up in favour of clutch his face and stemming the blood that’s beginning to flow.
Potter clenches his hands. “No.”
“I had a great time…Draco. I hope to see you soon.” Potter lowly murmurs, before stepping out of Draco’s arms and disappearing with a crack.
“Malfoy?”
Again he’s at a loss for words. How does he say you made Mother smile again, when she hardly ever left her room before. How does one express gratitude for breathing life and colour into someone he thought was lost to him just like Father was? How does Draco say thank you for giving me my mother back, in way he can convey just how much it means to him?
“Yes, I think we can be more…Draco.”
Oh, that’s my absolute favourite spot, and I--
“Oh, Draco, darling,” he feels the bed dip,as she settles her weight beside him. A hand cards through his hair -- it’s greasy and unwashed, making him cringe in deference for his mother -- and he can’t help but lean into the touch.
Presenting as an Omega seemed just the thing.
he gets in response.
“Potter stop.  We can all forget about this. I’m sorry I asked. In fact-”. But there’s a feverish cast to Potter’s face. And he is just. Not. Stopping.
He plates the sausages and brings them to the large, sturdy kitchen table, urging Potter to sit and eat.
Its starts up small, and it builds and builds and then things are breaking and they’re screaming at each other about,
The night he woke up, covered in sweat and leaking slick in places that had his Pureblood pale skin blushing, the only thought going through Draco’s mind was 'fuck' and ‘shit’ and variations thereof. Even as he spent the evening shivering and moaning behind warded curtains, he knew his life would change. And if he held any hope that it would not, his hurried trek to the infirmary in the morning, three days after, and the way the few students he met gave double-takes when they encountered him would have convinced him of the fact. The only bright spot in the whole mess was that he managed to convince his mother not to come rushing back home, when he was lucid enough to write a letter. He did not want her to worry more about him.
Over there we have the dastardly copse of trees, infested with blood thirsty Bowtruckles out to get unsuspecting four year olds.
“Draco.”
The first blush of sunrise is creeping through the classroom floor when they wake. Draco has a crick on his neck which he rubs as he sits up. He fusses with his hair, his face, his shirt. He might have gone on fussing if the other boy hadn’t cleared his throat.
Harry has dessert with apples as the main ingredient and Draco’s here to throw this all into his face. He really is the scum off the surface of the earth. Granger was right and all his pretty, self-righteous words about having a heart meaning nothing now. It was always him who was going to hurt Harry, not he other way around.
The sensations derived from Potter’s attention are quickly overwhelming. Draco can’t decide what feels better, Potter’s mouth on his breast, the feel of the boy’s hair around his fingers, the firmly muscled shoulder beneath his other hand…all these has Draco writhing wantonly on Potter’s lap and soon he finds he is hard in his trousers.
Draco debates where to take Potter.
He is so lost in sensation that he nearly ignores the tiny hiccups coming from Potter. He pulls away and he forces Potter’s face up to meet his. The boy’s face is flushed and with lips that are cherry red. It almost distracts Draco from the tell-tale glistening of unshed tears. Draco’s heart clenches.
They don’t pause to get properly naked, too impatient, too hungry, Potter’s fingers gripping tight enough to leave bruises and Draco’s teeth anchoring on Potter’s flesh.
But had he thought about it -- thought about kissing Potter -- he would say the kisses they would share would be violent, with clashing teeth and bleeding lips. Or maybe stilted and stiff leaving both parties cold and off balance.
"Sure?"
Draco snarls at his mother. Telling her that she had no right to judge when she was the same a few months ago. She was not the only one to who had the market in wallowing and shunning the world when it suits her.
“I hope I didn’t cross a line by speaking with your mother,” Harry’s nails are bitten to the quick, catching on a stray thread of his navy jumper and tugging, “But she gave me a lot, and I wanted to give something back.”
So he goes. He has to tug his wrist out of Harry’s grip -- nails scrape his skin as he pulls -- and then he’s free.
He doesn't let himself or Potter question his actions.
That is not to say being an Omega was inherently a bad thing. In fact, it was something coveted, as historically Omegas were the most beautiful, desirable creatures; able to make hardened Alphas swoon and indifferent Betas take notice of them. They we're traditionally nurtures and care takers, the glue that kept a society happy and fulfilled, while Alphas roles were thought to be about being strong keeping everyone safe, and the Betas ensuring the balance of things.
But can you really say you love someone, if you’re lying to them?
They separate when they’re both light headed from lack of air, lips tingling and raw from the kiss.
“What do you want, Potter?” The sound of Draco’s voice causes the other boy’s neck to snap in his direction. He is answered with a croaky sounding ‘what’ that nearly distracts Draco from the glint in Potter’s eyes. The sheer hunger in them has Draco taking half a step back.
There’s none -- or at least he can’t think of any -- so he steps into Harry’ arms, pressing in tight, breathing into him.
So really with the state of things, Draco could be forgiven for not being on the look out for even more shit to happen to him.  What more could happen to someone who's practically a pariah, hated by all and pitied by none?
floats towards him. Clearly the redhead is a god amongst men -- Draco is sorry for all the mean things he said or did to him and his family -- as he nods in acceptance to the stammered
It takes time before Draco stops being tentative with Harry, before he stops being differential and unsure of his welcome. Eventually Draco feels certain enough of his standing, stable in their relationship that he can bask on what it means to care for someone, and to be cared for in return.
He wants to press his fingers deep, until his nails know the taste of Potter’s blood.
But oh no,  the universe deemed it fit to punish him for every wrong doing. As if living in fear for the better part of two years, wasn’t suffering enough. He didn’t even have the knowledge of fighting for the right side -the ‘
Finally, he confesses about his true intentions. About why he chose to say yes to what Harry was proposing…
Granger corners him in his favourite bookshop, her hand clamping down on one of his arm. Draco hopes she refrains from making a scene, as this is one of the only places that don’t mind taking his coin. Mostly they sneer, pointedly insisting that they don’t have what his looking for, only to turnaround and sell the very item he wanted, to the person right beside him. It burns, but it is what it is.
What the fuck. He can’t believe the things that came out off Potter’s mouth. Everything is so surreal.
Draco and Harry are in a relationship, and finding out that he’s in it for the long run,
In fact these past few weeks, every time he remembers Potter’s insinuation, his desire to-
because it is.
He’s breathing hard as he watches Potter.
Potter proves to be as virtuous as he is said to be, for he pulls Draco to him, fortuitously not making Draco elaborate even more.
He’s fifteen, and accepting the Dark Mark, not even pausing to wonder at the sanity of a man willing to go after a babe in order to remain in power. Didn’t wonder if this was truly a person he wished follow.
This started out as a way to help his family get back on their feet. His plan was to go along with what Harry wanted. He wouldn’t do anything to hurt the other, on the contrary, he was going to be the best significant other Draco could be.
For some reason he never imagined that dating would entail kisses and possibly more.
It is but a flick of his wand that has the sausages, eggs and rashers of bacon flying through the air. He sets them to frying and turns his attention to toasting a couple slices of bread. He knows Potter hasn’t eaten, a combination of Potter’s strange aversion to cooking breakfast -- despite it being his favourite meal-- and Kreacher being unreliable at times.
“No. I would have said no. It was only going to be you.”
All thoughts fly out of his head when Potter's lips close over his.The kiss is chaste, just a heated press of lips, but it's enough to make Draco's insides quiver.
“It’s a start.”
“Then why the hell are you watching me Potter?” The said boy grimaces and tries to step away. But Draco is having none of that. No one is leaving, not unless Draco has the answer to his question.
Potter doesn’t disappoint. He presses in again, lips catching on Draco’s lower ones to gently suck on them. It causes the blond to gasp, lips tingling, Potter taking it as permission to slip in his tongue.
And right now the other boy seemed to be telling the truth.
When Draco is finally breathing normally, Potter gives him one last kiss, this time to the sharp edge of his cheek. Tender and soft, an action that nearly wrecks more havoc on Draco’s fragile mind than the smoldering kiss they just shared.
“I’d love to come for a drink with you as a friend,” he chuckled, “who’s the group?”
She just shrugged.
He wished he could go back in time and tell his father that he doubted Lucius Malfoy could beat Hermione Granger on a test when she was 12 years old, so how was he supposed to. So much wasted energy. So much pointless jealousy.
“Oh I don’t need to be paid for it, I’m very generous, not that you’ll ever know that,” Potter snapped, swivelling around to glare at her, and her face went red and crumpled.
Potter snorted, before his shoulders started shaking with repressed laughter. The gleam in his eyes had Draco cursing himself internally. Potter did have a track record of being reckless and stupid after all.
“Oh,” Justin squeaked in surprise.
He worried that it made him selfish, willingly leaving his mother alone, but she hadn’t given him any indication that she even wanted him around anymore. He’d rather spend his Christmas alone at school, than to return to that house full of nightmares.
MacMillan paled a little at her evil grin. She turned to Draco.
He turned and hurried over to the Slytherin’s and the alcohol.
“Let’s not dither like pigeons ladies, Ancient Runes are calling out to be translated,” he said, brushing past them both to walk over to the table and Luna.
He cast about for another safer topic of conversation.
Upon arriving in the common room Draco wasn’t really sure what to do so he tried to look like he was supposed to be there, and watched the groups forming around him.
A sharp laugh huffed out of her, and she glanced around as curious eyes turned towards them.
Conversations around the Hall slowly died out when raised voices could be heard through the open double doors, getting louder. Just as the voices were close enough to be in earshot, and Draco heard “I don’t know what you expect me to say...”, they cut off suddenly. Everyone was craning around to see who would enter the Hall, when moments later Weasley stomped in. He was red in the face, and his expression was murderous. Granger shot out of her seat, her eyes wide with worry, but when Weasley got to the table he ignored her and attacked a plate of sausages. She hovered near him hopefully, before giving up and returning to her book.
“Sometimes I guess, I mean I don’t keep tabs on the guy? We don’t talk about our day while we braid each others hair every night. Why do you ask?”
He looked at her hopefully, before he sank down onto the floor next to his bag and hugged his knees.
“You don’t know who the Spice Girls are?”
Granger, sitting beside Weasley, looked confused.
They carried on singing and dancing and laughing until they were breathless. Draco felt some of his jittery nerves be soothed by the joy of the music.
Draco looked at him steadily until understanding flashed in Potter’s eyes. He looked away.
Potter had set up some kind of game which involved a tiny bouncy ball, lots of glasses of drink on one of the study tables, throwing, and swearing. Hannah Abbott and Lavender Brown were playing against MacMillan and Thomas, with Finnigan and Parvati Patil on the side cheering them on.
“Never have I ever put on a dress and pretended to be a Spice Girl,” said Thomas triumphantly.
Draco flushed.
“I love onion soup,” he said in amazement.
Draco thought that was a good enough reason as any to get married. Pansy shrugged and started feeding Nyx bits of bacon.
He looked down, his breath hitching as he stared into Potter’s startling eyes. He’d never looked at them this closely before. His pale green irises were flecked with emerald and gold. Potter took the opportunity to lean up into him.
He frowned. Last month he’d taken Luna to meet his lawyer and sign the paperwork for her Malfoy trust fund. It was old money, so part of the process required blood magic to allow her access.
Instead of snapping he replied calmly, “Do you honestly believe I could bribe Hermione Granger with some Gillywater and Firewhisky? You know her better than that Potter.”
Draco sank down onto the floor by the low window, mirroring her pose and resting his chin on his fist, with his elbow on the seat.
Instead she said huffily, “We’d better get going if we’re going to make it to Herbology on time.”
“Of course, come in,” he called back.
Luna had tried to give Draco the photograph, but he refused. It was her mother, and Draco didn’t want to remember his father like that, as an innocent. His father had made his choices. Now Draco would make his. He was finished with trying to make his father proud. He’d rather live a life that Pandora would be proud of.
“Kindness is always free Malfoy. I’ve found that it’s hatred that tends to cost one an awful lot.”
She leaned forward and took hold of his hand, stilling his fingers from twisting the sheet into a knot.
“Never have I ever taken serious drugs.”
Stop right now, thank you very much!
Draco shook his head and held up his coffee.
“What’s that supposed to mean? Do you know something? Did she say something? What was it?” Pansy demanded.
Being an anxious person and getting into these situations was just asking for trouble. Draco was horribly twitchy for the rest of the week. To make matters worse, Hermione decided that Potter couldn’t be trusted to communicate effectively. This was a fair point, but slightly annoying when she forbade Draco from speaking to him until Saturday.
“She isn’t my girlfriend,” said Draco slowly.
“I’ve kissed a few people. Not Blaise though,” he added in a rush, “but I was in denial about myself for ages, and then the last few years... there just wasn’t the time,” he finished lamely.
“I don’t mind. It’s what you do for family.”
His obsession turned to crush, turned to complicated. He had thought it was under control. Pushed down and locked up tight. Now here he was, with his feelings spilling out of the cracks.
“I’ll check on you later,” Finch-Fletchley added, patting Draco’s arm before pulling the curtains closed around his bed.
“She’s very authoritative...” Longbottom mumbled.
“We need more drinks!” Draco announced loudly, surprising himself, “Blaise? I need your help again.”
Potter sat in stony silence, sliding deeper into his chair and crossing his arms.
Pansy wanted him to walk down to the village with them, but he had to say no. He couldn’t explain to her yet that he was expecting Potter at any moment, so made a joke about not wanting to walk back alone.
“Um,” she looked unsure before she squared her shoulders and turned to face him, “Sure.”
“I wanted to,” he said softly, “I wanted to hide in the dungeons and pretend none of you even existed, but that’s not how things are turning out. People keep surprising me. I really like Justin, and Luna actually wants to be my family. I’ve spent my whole life trying to be something I’m not. Now I... well now I want to see who I can be without my father treating me like a fucking trained poodle.”
Coming face to face with cruel words this evening, even if they had been mainly aimed at Potter, had shaken him more than he wanted to admit.
Potter followed at his own pace, slumping into the other chair. He leaned to the side, throwing one of his legs over the arm of the chair, kicking his foot in the air impatiently.
“I can agree with you on that,” Draco said, “but the coffee is too good, so I have to make allowances.”
“I’m not,” Draco rolled his eyes and picked at his sandwich, “I told you we study together.”
Justin smiled sweetly.
“Well thank you for the apology. I appreciate it, and you’ve given me a lot to think about,” Granger said eventually, getting up with her bag.
When he got back to his room, Justin was sitting up in bed, the duvet wrapped around him, staring out the window at the snow. Draco grabbed a spare blanket from his bed, and hopped up beside him.
“Do you think it would be too dramatic to make a big gay announcement at the party while making aggressive eye contact with her?”
He made it to the stairs up to the dorms. A few small groups of people were sitting on the spiral stone steps chatting and drinking. He tripped over them, apologising. He made it to the first landing, and jumped when a gaggle of girls came clattering out of the bathroom, shrieking together and holding each other up.
Draco smiled. The idea of paying Potter back for his lateness with escargot flitted across his mind, but he squashed it. He wasn’t actively trying to ruin this.
MacMillan stared at Pansy for a moment before grinning, looking genuinely impressed. Blaise poured more coffee while muttering about the indecency of character assassinations at breakfast. Finch-Fletchley looked a little disappointed, and Draco wondered if he was still fostering secret affection for Blaise. He hoped not, it wouldn’t end well.
Justin Finch-Fletchley was petite for an 18 year old boy. He was slender with a mass of curly brown hair, big soft hazel eyes, and a pouty mouth. Far too pretty in Draco’s opinion, and annoyingly flamboyant. He was currently wearing a tight pink t-shirt which was emblazoned with the words “Girl Power", and yellow pyjama trousers. His small feet were bare, and his toe nails were painted baby pink. Blaise found Finch-Fletchley's obvious queerness to be boring, he liked a challenge. Draco found it unsettling.
Pansy glanced over his shoulder, and raised her eyebrows in surprise. He swivelled on the bench and saw Luna making her way towards him, with Girl Weasley in tow looking very unhappy.
What most people didn’t know, is that Draco had developed a recent fondness for muggle clothes. He’d always been a lover of fashion, and a beautifully tailored wizard robe was simply perfect, but over the years at Hogwarts he’d grown more and more intrigued by muggle styles. It was a whole new world of clothing to explore.
Blaise looked incredulous, but Finch-Fletchley’s face was sympathetic.
“Potter, everyone in the room saw it. Everyone in the castle will know about it by breakfast,” Draco replied, running a hand through his hair.
The conversation flowed around the table, as they talked about school and their classmates. Draco found himself bridging the gap between his friends and his new friends. Blaise would talk to anyone he thought was interesting. Luna and Padma were friendly by nature, and Draco thought that there wasn’t anyone in the world who Justin couldn’t talk to. He probably could have ended the war in a single chat with the Dark Lord.
Beckett’s face was neutral, giving nothing away.
The numbness was familiar and welcome. He had no intention of listening to Boot. He’d known since deciding to come back to Hogwarts that he would not be wanted here, and that some people would make that clearer than others. It wouldn’t stop him though. He’d deal with it in his own way. He couldn’t tell Blaise and Pansy. They would only want to shield him and take vengeance, but they couldn’t fight the whole world.
He picked up the wine list.
Blaise looked mortally offended. Pansy patted his arm.
She squinted at him.
“Soooo...? Are you going to tell me?” he wheedled.
Everything was so quiet, like the snow had cast a muffling spell over the whole castle. Draco was embarrassed about breaking down the night before. He felt foolish, but of all his friends, he thought Pansy and Justin might understand the most.
“Since when are you best friends with Granger?” Pansy asked incredulously.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea just yet Lu. Maybe wait a bit...” That was definitely Weasley.
“So it would seem,” he agreed mildly.
Something about him looked different, and it took Draco a moment to figure it out as he watched Potter shrug out of his leather jacket and scarf. For a start there was nothing dangling from his ears. There was just a simple row of silver studs instead. He didn’t have any eye makeup on, not even eyeliner. He still wore his heavy boots, but his black jeans had no rips in them, and he was wearing a plain green shirt. When he pulled his chair out to sit down, Draco saw that his fingernails were bare. He hadn’t seen Potter without painted nails once this year. He looked like he’d made an effort to be presentable, but Draco found that he was disappointed. He liked the way Potter always surprised him with his style.
“Exactly. Whenever you say Granger, I still expect it to be followed with an insult.”
He didn’t tell anyone else about the possible date. He was still convinced it wasn’t a date, just a terrible miscommunication, but he’d committed to seeing it through. Maybe. He thought about cancelling a lot, or hoping something would happen which would make meeting Potter impossible through no fault of his own. He wasn’t sure if he didn’t want to tell Pansy and Blaise because they would think it was a good idea or a bad idea. If they though it was a good idea, it was more pressure that he knew he couldn’t cope with. He already knew all the reasons that it was a bad idea because he’d thought about it extensively. He didn’t know if he wanted them to talk him out of it or not.
When Draco had tried to avoid busy corridors, where the worst of the unidentifiable long distance attacks occurred, he realised he was left exposed to other types of attack. Ambush attempts became a common part of his day to day, and while he became quite adept at outsmarting the roaming groups of vengeance seekers, he wasn’t always successful.
“I’ll get you up to the hospital wing. Do you think you can make it if you lean on me?”
She looked up at him wide eyed, as though this was just now dawning on her.
She looked at him strangely, like he was the one being confusing.
She turned to leave, but then paused and looked back at him.
There was one last vial on the tray, full of a clear liquid. He regarded it warily when she handed it to him, still coughing a little.
“You do realise that’s completely your fault because of that bloody article in fourth year,” she huffed.
“Ah Malfoy, you’re up! Jolly good, I just wanted to make sure you hadn’t overslept. Ernie and I were just off for a spot of brekkie, you game?”
“Don’t you have anything you want to tell me?” she said, encouragingly.
When he was relaxed and dry he wrapped himself up in a soft baggy jumper, and went to sit cross-legged in front of the fire in the empty common room. He was too jittery to concentrate on his book or his homework, so he set about combing his damp hair out and parting it into sections. Then he began to plait each section until his head was an array of tiny braids, securing each one with a small elastic band which he transfigured from loose threads he pulled out of the rug.
Draco’s mind whirled. Potter had said he’d never slept with a girl, so he hadn’t been with girl Weasley. Which Weasley had he slept with?
Potter shot to his feet, making Draco jump.
He didn’t notice Terry Boot until it was too late.
Potter flushed a little and looked down at the table, fiddling with his cutlery.
“Don't you know, why can't you see,
Standing there in the half light, Potter looked like some debauched God of ancient times, and Draco didn’t feel nervous or embarrassed. He raised his chin and met Potter’s gaze steadily. It was Potter who broke the eye contact this time, rubbing a hand through his hair, shoving it back off his face and exposing that famous scar, white against his brown skin. Draco had a sudden ridiculous urge to touch it.
Draco worked himself into a panic all day Sunday, worrying about what would happen the next time he ran into Potter. He needn’t have bothered. Potter looked right through him at breakfast on Monday. He ignored Draco more than he had before. Draco wasn’t sure if he was relieved or devastated.
Potter was distracted by the food again, and Draco was glad he’d chosen something simple but delicious. Whenever Raphael put his steak frites with béarnaise sauce and green beans on the specials menu, you knew the chef was in a good mood, and the dish always sold out.
This was definitely his only opportunity to have Potter like this, but he couldn’t bear to just be another conquest to Potter. Another drunken night to be forgotten. He would rather have nothing than be discarded like that.
“JUSTIN Finch-Fletchley?” Pansy squeaked. Blaise nodded impatiently.
“Tell me what all this has been for then Potter!” Draco demanded. His wand was in his hand and he didn’t remember pulling it out.
“I bet it was...”
He was alone at their study table, making notes for a particularly complex potion he was planning for the next day, when he heard a small cough.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Blaise said tartly, without looking at him.
Draco elbowed her again. Hermione looked at him and he shrugged.
She smiled at him, and he saw the glimmer of hope in her eyes. She wanted to be his family. Even knowing who he was and what he had done, she wanted to claim him. The tears that had threatened to make an appearance a few minutes before now slid down his cheeks.
He really wanted to believe her.
He shook his head and winced.
He laughed, startling her.
He continued chatting while they unpacked, and Draco began to pick up little things about Finch-Fletchley’s life. He had brothers, his father worked in muggle government, he owned and rode horses, and he preferred to summer in Italy. Draco found he didn’t need to contribute much to the conversation, for which he was grateful.
“What reason would anyone have for keeping secrets from their best friend about why they were knocked out in a corridor last night? The world is a mysterious place darling.”
“I’m fine really,” he was much more interested in watching the awkwardness of this interaction.
Healer Merrick would suggest that Draco think about why Finch-Fletchley made him uncomfortable. He considered it as he washed his hair forcefully. He supposed that if he really thought about it, Finch-Fletchley’s mannerisms reminded him a lot of how he used to behave when he was young and freer with himself. His father had hated it, and said he wouldn’t have his son acting like some little Nancy boy. Draco had been punished severely if he had behaved too flamboyantly in front of his father, until he had learned to conduct himself in a manner befitting of a Malfoy heir.
“You’ve been saying that for the last 3 years," huffed Blaise, “I need my beauty sleep. Let’s go and see what the bedroom arrangements are in this place. With all this ‘Unity’ crap, I’ll bet my mother’s fortune that we won’t be bunking together with Theo anymore.”
He heard retreating footsteps and then it was quiet for a while. Draco was wide awake now, puzzling over the conversation.
He did care now. He didn’t want Potter’s hatred anymore, but as he was discovering, without the hatred there was nothing.
Draco groaned.
“Why else would Potter take Finch-Fletchley into a toilet Pansy, really? He’s giving him private charisma lessons? Justin is a terrible bore, but he’ll drop to his knees for just about anyone. “
Draco sighed as Blaise raised one perfectly shaped eyebrow imperiously.
“Don’t accuse me of thinking Headmistress,” Potter replied, refusing to meet her gaze.
“Good morning darling. You might have left me a little note or something, I looked everywhere for you,” she huffed, before smiling sweetly at him when he handed her a cup of black tea with 3 sugars.
The noise of footsteps slowly climbing the stairs towards the common room had him stiffening and looking to the doorway warily.
“Why?” he asked, perplexed. “Once you turn 18 you’ll have full access to the whole of your trust.”
Draco sniffed.
“I was attuned to gossip practically from birth.”
“You’re so confusing Malfoy, walking around on your stupid long legs, with your stupid pretty hair and your stupid pretty eyes, being all nice to Luna, ergh...” Potter was muttering.
As if she could hear the train of his thoughts, Granger looked up and met his gaze. She regarded him coolly, but not unkindly, which was generous considering he’d watched his insane aunt torture her not 6 months ago in his house. Sometimes he heard her screams in his nightmares.
The volume levels on Justin’s record player were really being tested. People were sort of dancing, it was hard to tell in the crowd. Someone had hung up orange and black streamers, and little paper pumpkins and bats floated about overhead.
“Thanks,” he coughed, grey vapour pouring into the freezing air as though he were still smoking, “For healing my arms I mean.”
Draco’s breath caught as Potter pressed him back gently, taking another step as Draco moved backwards. He stopped when he hit the corridor wall. Potter was so close now he had to tip his head back to look up at Draco. His face was serious, his eyes heated. His right hand slid under the hem of Draco’s jumper, his fingers hot against Draco’s bare skin.
At twelve fifty-five he went inside, mainly because he was cold. He’d gotten a table for two, and settled in to wait for Potter.
He felt her move to perch on the arm of the chair next to him.
There were fresh bruises darkening across his shoulder, down his arms, and over his hips and thighs from the fall. His leg was horrible to look at, all twisted and wrong. The blast to his chest had burned the skin red and raw. It was starting to blister.
Draco had a similar sense. The majority of students were offended that the Prophet had come for their Hero and their Headmistress. He was more concerned about how the magical population would react to the story.
Draco’s eyes widened and he sat up straighter.
“Death Eaters don’t belong here,” he growled threateningly.
“Ergh get a room,” a loud voice suddenly barked from across the room, and they both jumped.
The story about Potter’s fight at the party did get shared around the school, as Draco predicted. He heard so many different versions of what had happened by dinnertime, and none of them came close to the truth. Rumours about why Potter had vanished from the party were even more outlandish. Draco tried to avoid any mention of it.
She groaned and threw the magazine at him as he left cackling.
Blaise turned on Finch-Fletchley, his eyes like melted dark chocolate, and Finch-Fletchley looked hopelessly between him and Draco.
“Really Blaise, I’m fine. I just need to sleep I think.”
“Is there a reason I should be arresting you Mr. Malfoy?” he asked sternly.
“Thanks for telling me. We’re really good at listening to rants about unrequited love, so here for you any time.”
“OK,” he parroted again, smiling this time.
“Do you really think people assume I’m straight? Is this why I’ve had no success with Ravenclaw Patil?”
“That was months ago old boy,” he rolled his eyes and slapped Draco’s arm playfully, “You should have asked. On the train, that was just fun, I mean you can’t blame me? Harry is hot.”
“No,” he said forcefully, too loud in the night.
Draco found the whole picture unsettling for some reason, and he felt a swooping in his stomach. There was an inelegant snort from beside him.
More and more whispers were breaking out across the Hall. Potter’s recent behaviour wasn’t really news to the students of Hogwarts, but seeing everything laid out in an exposé was another story. Draco knew from experience that people would believe whatever they read in the news, despite any evidence to the contrary, especially when it was built on truth.
She opened her mouth to protest, but he held up his hand to stop her.
“Who...?”
“Where have you beeeeen?” she shouted shrilly, against his ear. He winced.
“Am I OK with my aunt being disinherited because she didn’t conform to the tiny Malfoy bullshit restrictions? Of course not. I sent an owl to my lawyer last night to get Luna her trust fund set up, and he’s looking into what else Pandora should have received when my grandfather died.”
“Really Potter? Who is going to want me as their Healer?”
“Sick fuckers,” Potter muttered to himself, and for some reason Draco felt better.
“I’m taking Potter back up to the castle. I’d like you to join us,” his tone of voice implying that this was not a request.
Now he’d calmed down, he thought about what Potter was saying. What would it mean to publicly date Potter? Not a real relationship, but one that could benefit them both, with the added bonus of not having to worry about how Potter felt about him. Draco had recently been thinking about how to be more open about his sexuality after all. This would send a pretty clear message to the wizarding world.
“The question is, where were you?” he shot back, his voice stronger.
By eleven o’clock he was ready. Justin looked him up and down as he pulled on a knee length wool coat and grey scarf. He smiled when Justin nodded in approval, then batted his hands away when he tried to readjust Draco’s scarf.
They had just made it to the second landing of Hospital Tower, when they rounded the corner and ran headlong into Ginny Weasley. Lovegood jumped so hard that she let go of Draco, and he nearly tumbled backwards down his second flight of stairs of the day, before Weasley snatched out a hand and caught the strap of his bag, steadying him.
She studied him carefully. He was sure he was blushing horribly.
After finally getting Potter to be honest with him, Draco decided he needed some time to think. If he was going to get involved with this crazy plan, he wanted to do it properly.
He shrugged. Draco was a little gobsmacked. He couldn’t imagine telling his parents. They’d probably always had some idea, but it was an unspoken rule between them that it was just not discussed. If nobody talked about it, they could pretend it wasn’t real.
“Well I should go and get a drink, this is a party after all,” he said quickly, laughing nervously. “I’ll see you girls later.”
“Navy is like the Ravenclaw House colour.”
He didn’t know why, but he really didn’t want to tell anyone about what happened. It would just be his word against Boot's anyway, and no one would want to believe him. Besides, a small twisted voice in his head was whispering “you deserve this”.
“Fine then, but know that if your attitude doesn’t improve dramatically, I won’t be able to accept your application to be an Auror. The Ministry cannot be seen to employ someone so publicly unstable. It will effect the image we are trying to build.”
As if on cue, the waiter bought over the espresso Draco had ordered earlier, and put Potter’s dessert down in front of him.
“Nobody’s going outside today,” Draco agreed, “I’ve got three essays to finish, but all I want to do is stay in bed.”
“Hey Hermione, do you mind if we join you?” Luna asked softly.
“No!” he gasped out in a panic, his head ringing.
“Then why don’t you go and sleep under the Whomping Willow,” drawled Harry Potter, looking lazily at Boot.
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Potter looked like he was building up a head of steam to keep arguing. McGonagall seemed to agree, because she glanced at Draco.
He wandered around looking for Luna, but when he didn’t spot her, he went back to the main part of the library to wait. She walked in just as he started browsing the commonly used books which were kept near the front. He ran his thumb down the spine of a well worn copy of ‘Hogwarts: A History’, as she waved and came over to meet him.
“I know,” Justin said finally, his voice sad, “You don’t have to worry about me Draco.”
“OK,” Potter breathed, pacing nervously back and forth.
“He won’t listen to me any more!” he heard Granger wail quietly, and he automatically stepped closer to the bookshelf, into the shadows, and edged a bit nearer.
He drew in a deep lungful of smoke, smirking as Draco’s eyes widened in surprise.
“And he knows what he’s doing, you’ll see,” he winked up at Draco.
Draco found Granger in the library later that day. He was deep within the labyrinth of the shelves, looking for a very old compendium of rare medical plants which Madam Pince swore was here somewhere, when he spotted her. She was squashed into a narrow window seat recess, her knees pulled up to her chest. She wasn’t reading any of the books stacked around her, she was just staring out of the window, watching the last crimson rays of light bleed from the sky over the black forest.
Blaise settled into a seat next to Pansy.
He leaned towards Blaise and whispered loudly, “you don’t think he could have a tapeworm do you?”
Draco shook his head in amused annoyance.
Padma stood next to him, grinning wickedly. She peered around the corner and sighed.
Justin frowned at him in confusion.
“I think yer a disgrace,” spat Howard at Potter, ignoring his friends advice.
They all worked quietly for a while, Luna occasionally leaning over to ask Draco a question about his Charms notes. She wasn’t great at taking notes it seemed. She barely had any as far as Draco could see, and when he asked her why she said she preferred to experience the lessons without any distraction. He thought that was pretty naive of her, but then he realised that the questions she was asking him were specifically about his opinions. Her memory recall, and grasp of the topic, was actually astounding.
After a moment of silence, she sighed.
Draco swallowed back what he was about to say. Potter was needling him on purpose.
Granger had turned her penetrating stare on Potter. It was her turn.
He lifted his head up and smiled at her weakly.
She rolled onto her back again and fell into a brooding silence. Draco sat with her for a bit quietly, before he headed up for the privacy of his room.
“I’m supposed to help Hannah with her project in Greenhouse 5 today,” sighed Justin softly, “I don’t think we’ll make it without becoming popsicles.”
The next morning Draco woke up slowly,  incredibly comfortable, to the upbeat sounds of Finch-Fletchley’s music. When Draco pulled back the curtains of his bed, the boy in question was nowhere to be seen. Draco frowned and checked the time, but it was still early. The cold jolt of the floor against his bare feet was enough to wake him fully, and he stretched before getting up to dress. He caught himself nodding along with the music as he tied his hair back, and found he didn’t mind.
“Please, Madam Pomfrey, I don’t want to start any trouble,” he mumbled.
All Draco’s annoyance at her sudden, ill timed appearance evaporated.
On the other side of the booth, Blaise was leaning in close to speak to Potter, their shoulders touching. He laughed softly, then maintained eye contact with Potter while he chased the straw in his drink around with his tongue.
“Of course, good idea,” she answered brightly, getting up from the bench, “I’ll probably see you later in the library Draco.”
“Well good. I hope you enjoy yourself, I’m off to bed. I’m knackered,” he huffed wearily. The mere thought of a party put him instantly on edge
“I think you’ll find that one was all Pansy’s idea. I won’t take the credit,” he said, grinning.
“Explain yourself Mr. Potter. What were you thinking?” the Headmistress demanded.
His grin widened.
“Why?” he asked slowly.
Silently Potter stalked towards him. Draco just watched him and didn’t move a muscle. He came to stand beside Draco, staring into the flames, took a long last pull on his cigarette, and flicked the butt into the fire. He glanced down at Draco then, and reached out to tug softly on one of Draco’s plaits, a small smile twitching at the corners of his mouth. Then he walked away without a word, up the stairs to the dorms. Draco stayed frozen in place for a long while, until the fire magically dimmed and the common room was flooded with late summer sunlight.
Draco sighed and decided not to panic about this. They had seen him do worse things after all.
He looked down at where her slender brown hand was clinging to his pale forearm. Right over his mark. His stomach twisted, and he pulled his arm free. He didn’t want her to touch it, like it might taint her somehow. He shouldn’t have forgotten it was there, even for a moment.
Justin allowed Draco to sit quietly with his own thoughts, while he distracted Abbott by planning a shopping trip on the weekend.
Draco glanced at Pansy in confusion, but she just shrugged. His bed in the dungeons was calling him, it had been an emotional roller coaster of a day and he needed some peace. The hall emptied quickly, the skittish first years being herded out by their prefects, and only a handful of students remained. Draco peered around, curious to see who else had chosen to come back. With him at the Slytherin table was of course Pansy and Blaise, but Theo, Daphne, and Tracey were also back. There were 4 students at each the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables, and 8 Gryffindor’s.
Longbottom looked confused.
There had been a collection at lunchtime, everyone contributing some money for alcohol, and then Finnigan, Thomas, and Potter all went down into Hogsmeade to buy a selection. They didn’t get back until the party was just about to begin, and they had clearly gotten a head start on drinking while they were out. Longbottom and Weasley had been down to the kitchens to get some snacks, and Justin had volunteered his record player. Thankfully he had a lot more records than just the Spice Girls.
He pulled Potter’s legs up onto the bed, and rolled him onto his side. He wondered how it was that the universe kept finding new ways to torture him.
“Would you like me to order for you? I’ve been here before and I’m sure I can pick out something you’ll like,” he asked sweetly.
“Am I OK with it? The fact that someone as open-hearted as Luna was able to be produced from the Malfoy line gives me hope Granger.”
He fussed about what to do with his hair for a while, before leaving it loose. Justin tried to convince him that eye makeup was a good idea, but he wasn’t comfortable with that.
“You two faggots shouldnae be allowed in a school full a innocent wee bairns. It’s disgusting. You following the example of that ol’ poof Dumbledore Potter? I bet he was diddling you when you were wee.”
“Oh no, stop!...” Patil exclaimed, stretching a hand towards him as though to physically stop him.
Draco almost gave in. Potter’s indifference of him lately had made him sorely miss the days when they would tear into each other. When he knew just what to say or do to make Potter really look at him. To be his sole focus. He hadn’t cared then if Potter hated him or not. He could be so intense and raw in those moments, and it had made purposefully superficial Draco feel terrified, but also thrilled.
“My father doesn’t have any siblings. I’ve never heard of him having a sister.”
Draco smirked.
Justin grinned, pulling on his pyjamas.
Draco also had questions.
“If you have quite finished undressing Potter with you eyes darling,” she hissed, “we should get on the train.”
Draco couldn’t even begin to decipher the complicated look on his face.
When Draco looked up, Potter was staring at him blankly.
“Sure Finch-Fletchley, if you wouldn’t mind me tagging along?”
Draco could have kicked himself.
While the whole school was watching Potter, they were very pointedly not watching him. In that blind spot it started slowly. He’d expected it from Gryffindor’s and maybe Ravenclaw’s, but it was all of them. Those fiercely loyal Hufflepuff’s were just as vicious as any of the others. The Slytherin’s either hated him because they wanted to distance themselves from their terrible past, or they hated him for being a traitor.
“Honestly Potter, there’s really no need,” he said politely. He could be just as stubborn. In an attempt to end this bizarre conversation, he returned to his notes. He wrote a few random phrases, which would definitely confuse him later.
She sounded sincere. He patted the plaits.
“At least she doesn’t treat me like some damaged whore, like all the other women in my life,” he cut back without looking at her.
“I’m totally fine. I was just dropping off Sandy because she got hit in the head by a bludger and starting talking about how the sky tasted like ice cream. I’m more concerned about you right now. What are you doing with Malfoy?”
“Oh that’s my fault I’m afraid Parkinson,” Finch-Fletchley piped up from across the table, “Ernie and I whisked him down for breakfast with us and I didn’t think. My apologies.”
“No, you go to dinner Padma, I’ll see you down there,” Granger replied, waving her offer away.
“I appreciate that you’re working on your flaws Malfoy. I’ve been watching you since school started, and I have been surprised. You’re getting on with Justin, and you’ve accepted Luna as your cousin, which is really great... but you tormented me and my friends for years, not to mention everything that happened during the war. I don’t know if I can forgive you just like that.”
“Oh it’s going to be that sort of game,” said Thomas with a lopsided smirk.
