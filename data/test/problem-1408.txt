“Mr Malfoy has attempted to bring a stolen wand into Hogwarts, but as he is under investigation for his crimes involving You Know Who, he is not permitted to carry a wand. We were already on guard as he was wandless on arrest, and suspicious that he’d hidden it to avoid confiscation. Malfoy was detained and questioned this week about the incident, and continues to insist he has no idea of the location of his own wand.” - R. Lewis, Senior detective in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
“Listen Draco.” She said in a whisper. “They made me a deal. If I come here, you go free. They’ve dropped your charges in exchange for my imprisonment. Shh, don’t argue with me Draco. This is the only way. You’re free, Draco. Are you listening to me?” Narcissa eyes darted desperately between Draco’s but all he could do was stand there with his mouth half open, wordless.
“A thank you would’ve been nice.” Harry murmured.
“What's the point? You're wasting your time coming back here, you’ll be behind bars before the NEWT’s even start.” Silence. Harry continued, louder, frustrated.
Harry opened his eyes slightly and saw a pile of cushions surrounding them. Harry smirked into Draco's kiss and leaned his whole body weight onto Draco, making the pair fall back into the soft cushions. Harry pulled off him momentarily and Draco eyed around him, raising an eyebrow at the new addition of several pillows. He looked up at Harry, who grinned down at Draco, straightening up slightly to fully straddle him and tear impatiently at the rest of Draco’s shirt buttons that were stiff with sweat.
Christmas at the Burrow was as good as Harry had always known. Warm fires roared through the topsy-turvy house, laughs and chatter constantly echoed through the rooms, and he enjoyed spectacular home cooked food from Mrs Weasley. It was cosy but chaotic all at once, and Harry noted how this combination had always been unique to the Weasley household. Harry spend the days mostly in front of the sitting room fire, stroking Hermione’s cat with one hand (She had left in in the care of the Weasley’s while she was away, much to Ron’s annoyance) and nursing a glass of wine or another festive beverage in the other, trying his best to stay out of Mrs Weasley’s way after unsuccessfully offering his help. Mrs Weasley had looked utterly offended when Harry had mentioned helping, so Harry decided his politeness wasn't appreciated and resigned himself to a comfy spot, somewhat relieved.
“It’s a life sentence, Darling.”
“I really am glad you came back, Potter. I think you made the right choice by doing so.” Harry gave her a small smile in return.
Harry felt his limbs getting scalded and grazed by the various spells and flying debris, but he didn't care. This felt amazing. The two boys started to get closer together as their magic started to wane and weaken after relentless battling. Harry could feel it draining out of him, his spells getting less and less explosive, less destructive. As Harry blocked a sizzle of red sparks from Malfoy's wand he noticed the other boy was getting less powerful now too, and looked just about as dishevelled as he felt.
He lurched forward, hand outstretched, running towards the gate which his mother was trapped behind, but a sudden blast of electricity made him withdraw his hands with a shout of pain before he could reach the metal, and a shimmer of magic rippled across the space in front of him. Draco’s chest heaved as he stared at his mother through the bars. He had never seen her look this dishevelled. Her hair was down, the usual blonde curls absent. Instead her hair fell matte and dull. Her usually piercing eyes were clouded, and the lines of her face were deep. Malfoy felt a lump rise in his throat and he blinked through the tears that were threatening to spill out. He wanted so badly to reach out to her, hold her in his arms as he had done so many times before and tell her everything was going to be ok. He couldn’t stand seeing her like this. He felt his heart break.
“Come on, lets get some warm clothes on. I’m freezing.” Harry said, linking his arm with Draco’s, and heading towards the castle.
Harry sat at the large gnarled kitchen table nursing a steaming mug of coffee, feeling the festive mixture of hungover and over - fed. It wasn't an unpleasant feeling, but he knew it was time for him to return to Grimmauld Place. He should really check to see if the house was ok, and then get to tidying it. He groaned and tried not to think of the utter state he had left it in before coming to The Burrow.
“When I saw you go under I just… something broke in me. Somehow I knew I needed to do it.” Malfoy breathed.
“Poor bloke. Have you heard about his Dad? Azkaban for life. Not that I feel sorry for him, he deserves everything he’s got for what he did. But Malfoy, I dunno. Sometimes I just feel like he got caught up in the whole Death Eater business. His dad being who he was, you know, didn’t seem like he had much of a choice.”
“Sorry I’m late Professor Slughorn, I-”
Ron looked across the table at Harry, and smiled.
“Um, ok then. A wand, I’m looking for a wand. I brought it back here after… you know. When I moved in.” Harry said.
Harry turned back into his bedroom and spelled on some of the dim lights. Harry suddenly remembered with a lurch of panic his view of the lake, but as he looked at the window he was relieved to see the light in the room made it pretty much impossible to see outside. Harry, relieved, and thanking himself internally for having tidied his room earlier, strode over to his trunk, rummaging through its haphazardly packed contents until he heard a glass clink, and pulled out a handful of vials. He searched the labels for the one that read, in Hermione’s perfect cursive, ‘Dittany.” He saw in his peripheral Malfoy slowly getting to his feet, and stepping cautiously into the light of Harry's room. He remained silent, and Harry looked up to see Draco eyeing into the room, expression unreadable. Harry felt himself getting slightly warm, the impossible truth of Malfoy, Draco bloody Malfoy, entering his room. What was he thinking? The absurdity of it all made Harry's stomach churn. Harry tried to focus on the task at hand. Malfoy had tried to get into Harry's room. He must have thought he'd gone home for Christmas. What on earth could Malfoy be up to trying to get in here? And now Harry was acting as if nothing had happened. Finding the correct vial, Harry vowed to get the truth out of Malfoy.
“A drink, Master?” Kreacher croaked, his bulbous eyes looking up at Harry expectantly. Harry looked down at the old house elf and reluctantly nodded, to which the elf vanished, reappearing moments later with a tray piled with custard creams and a large floral teapot, steam seeping from its spout. He lugged the tray onto a side table, and Harry collapsed into a chair in front of it, exhausted. He’d been searching for what felt like hours. He felt a stab of guilt as he realised that he had lost Malfoy’s wand. How could he be so careless? That was a part of Malfoy, a cherished object he’d be given as a child. Harry watched Kreacher pour out a cup of tea for him, hands shaking slightly, and frowned. Kreacher was looking old. His big eyes were yellowed, the beginning of cloudy cataracts starting to appear over his pupils. Another pang of guilt struck Harry for how he'd mistreated Kreacher in the past.
“MALFOY’S MISFORTUNES; TRIAL AND ERROR”
“Potter.” The word escaped Malfoy’s lips and landed on Harry's ears. Potter. It was gentle, careful. He was testing the name on his tongue like a toe dipped in cold water.
Legs emerged from beneath the cloak, shoes touching the pebbles of the shore under which the boulder sat. The figure shifted, and Harry saw with bemusement as it toed off the shoes, revealing sock clad feet. The figure stood up, and reached for the hood of its cloak. Harry held his breath as the hood pulled back, and revealed a white blonde head, shining in the moonlight.
“Will do.” Harry nodded.
“See you soon mate. Keep in touch. I’ll see you at Christmas yea?” Harry stepped back as Ron pulled out his wand.
“No. You have to just let me die Harry. Even if we killed every last Inferi, the curse would still be active, and more will be made. As long as I am alive, so is the curse.”
“Stay here.”
They spent the afternoon talking, exchanging stories and reminiscing. Eventually it started getting dark, and Ron announced he had to get back to the office to finish up and report back to Kingsley. They said their goodbyes to Hagrid and left the warmth of the Hut, stepping outside into the biting cold and silvery moonlight. Harry insisted on walking Ron to where he could apparate from, and as they walked passed the reflective lake, the scene reminded Harry of the figure he had seen on a similar moonlit night.
“I think you'll find the last time I was suspicious of Malfoy it turned out that I was right. He was up to something, remember?” Harry mirrored her eyebrow raise, and Ginny sighed and leaned back into the comfy cushions of the sofa.
Harry turned around, and grabbed the door handle, yanking it open and walked out of the room towards the fireplace across the hall. He came to his belongings, coated in a thin layer of soot from the floo, and pulled open his rucksack, feeling around for the object. He closed his fist around the wand and pulled it out, looking at the black wood carefully, feeling the magic vibrate quietly under his fingertips. He liked this wand. It was a good match for him, slightly less chaotic than his own, the magic that flowed through him was more subdued, but with a lethal edge that harry had learned to wield during the war. His own wand was more full, bouncy and chaotic. This was Malfoy’s wand, after all. Harry wondered if that was how Malfoy felt his own magic within him. Sharp and deadly, rather than a ball of soft energy that Harry felt. He’d liked how his magic entwined with this wand, it was like it focused it in a different way.
“Bit early aren’t ye?”
“You know what’s causing it then?” Harry asked. Draco gave him a piercing look, and his lips pressed together in an irritated line. Harry stared at him, determined, but he received an equally determined gaze right back. The light in the room shifted slightly, and a few cold beams of light fell onto Draco’s side, illuminating the white hair and glinting off his pale eyes. Harry felt his expression melt slightly, momentarily forgetting the argument they were having to drink in the appearance of the other boy, completely unintentionally. He felt a heat sink through him, an odd, protective urge accompanying it as he looked into Draco’s reddened eyes.
“He will be here any minute. Thank you gentlemen for your patience.” McGonagall said, looking up and down the empty corridor leading into the great hall, then turning back towards the two large men, who’d followed behind her.
Draco dragged himself up off the floor and knew where he needed to go. He needed his wand. Knowing Harry, he would be at the Burrow for Christmas, which already meant this would be a hell of a lot easier without having to confront Potter again. But this time he wouldn’t have Potter’s empathy to take advantage of.
Shoeless, trouser-less and cloak-less, wearing only his white school shirt and underwear which poked out slightly beneath the hem of his shirt, Malfoy stepped towards the lake, pausing at the lapping waves that bordered the vast body of water. A few moments later, Draco started forward and waded into the likely freezing cold water. Harry stood up, concern rising in his chest as he watched Draco go deeper and deeper until only his head and shoulders were visible above the surface of the gleaming lake. What the hell was happening? The water must be utterly freezing, Malfoy was crazy to be going in. Plus he didn’t have a wand, and it was dark, and there was no one around to help him. No one could know what he was doing, except Harry, who watched him in bewilderment.
“Are Master Harry and Master Draco finished with their teas, Sirs?” Kreacher appeared, making the two boys jump and snap their heads round at him, startled at the sudden appearance of the elf. Harry breathed, his heart pounding in his ears, and he looked at Malfoy, who’d broken the eye contact and yet another blush exploded onto his face.
“So that was what it was?” Harry asked.
“Potter?”
The Auror's fingers dug deeper into Draco's arm, short nails stinging painfully. He didn’t understand why he’d been squeezing so hard, it's not like he could do anything if he escaped. Draco frowned and tried not to think of the inevitable bruise which was likely blooming over his white skin.
Ron stalked into the kitchen, black ink splattered all up his left pyjama leg. He looked exhausted, and annoyed.
Draco Malfoy was kneeling before him, looking utterly uncomfortable. He was breathing heavily, and his face was twisted in a pained frown, an expression of cureless mire. The silence between them hung dreadfully for what seemed like minutes. Harry couldn’t quite comprehend this predicament. He was under the impression Malfoy had left the castle under Auror supervision, but as he looked down at the boy, confusion clouding his only half awake brain, he supposed he had just assumed this, he hadn't actually seen Malfoy leave the castle at all. Harry’s eyes washed over the other boy, taking in the ruffled white hair, the hollow cheekbones, and Malfoys thighs, that were spread on the ground defencelessly. Harry's abdomen tightened seeing Malfoy look so vulnerable, something he'd noticed himself feeling while watching Malfoy in the lake. He looked over Malfoy’s white face, his lips were pressed tightly closed in a firm line. Harry fingered his wand in his hand and decided to break the silence.
Harry grabbed his wand from his pocket.
“I know, but Malfoy didn't have-” he was cut off once again when he heard a high pitched scream, and they all looked towards the lake. One by one, slimy, scaly heads were appearing above the surface of the water. All of which started screaming when their mouths breached the air. The sound was unbearable, and got louder and louder with every head joining the chorus.
“Potions essays and Transfiguration theory is a breeze compared to what we had to put up with last year. Plus, Head Girl responsibilities are putting way more pressure on me than homework. I actually quite enjoy doing homework now.”
“Malfoy, have you ever been to the prefect's bathroom on the 5th floor?”
Harry dropped back into his seat and gestured to the paper Ron was looking at.
Harry nodded tentatively. “What time is it?”
Harry occasionally looked up from his work to peer out of the window, and scan the scene below him. This process of working, looking, then working again eventually became routine, and Harry got used to the process. At just past 10pm, Harry noticed Hagrid’s lights going out, yellow squares disappearing from the now completely monochrome scene. Harry blinked, and noticed now without the light of Hagrid's hut, he couldn’t see that well; the candlelight from his own room was casting a yellow glare against the window pane, making it impossible to see much out of it. Harry reluctantly extinguished all the candles, the prospect of getting any more homework done extinguishing along with them. Now, the only thing he could do was look out of the window and wait. Harry sighed, slightly regretting agreeing to do this now that he had no other distractions, and put an elbow on the arm of the chair, leaning his head against his hand. He watched for a while, taking in the whole wintery scene, before checking his watch again. Squinting in the low light, and angling it towards the light of the moon, the clock face read 10.27pm. Harry dropped his arm onto the soft blanket covering him, and decided that if there was nothing here by 11.30, 12 at a push, he’d call it a night and go to bed. Feeling a bit better for giving himself a time limit, Harry watched more intently at the scene below him.
A pained yell and a crash made Harry jolt awake, his chest heaving in half conscious fear. He fumbled next to him, grabbing his spindly glasses and shoving them roughly onto his face, trapping a few strands of hair between his face and the lenses. He rubbed his face and listened. He hadn't been having a nightmare had he? Harry searched his foggy memory of the dream, coming across only calm snippets of water and moonlight.
“You’ll do what?” Malfoys eyes glinted, dangerously. “Tie me up and keep me here until I confess? I think the Auror's would have a few questions if they found me bound to Harry Potter's four-poster when they came to get me tomorrow morning. Your reputation as a do-no-wrong hero might be slightly tarnished.” Harry's gut dropped at the mental image Malfoy had just created and it clouded his mind, and before he could react, Malfoy had lurched forward, pushed Harry to his side and jumped up, grabbing the dagger in the process, and leapt towards the door. Harry landed on his back, hearing his wand clatter on the floor down the back of the bed frame, out of reach. He lifted himself onto his elbows and watched Malfoy from between his open knees, whose arm was outstretched, dagger pointed at him as he stood in the darkened doorway. Malfoy narrowed his eyes and flicked his hair out of his face.
“Magic bond? Potter you bloody idiot I’m not trying to make it fucking worse.” Malfoy was standing now, gesturing with his hands in frustration. One came up to rub his eyes, and Draco grimaced. Harry stared at him, feeling confused.
“DRACO!” he half spluttered into the air, looking around madly for the blonde. His eyes fell on the shore, and found a blurred body sprawled on the pebbles. Harry swam madly towards it, eventually feeling the shore and ran out of the water, his clothes clinging like ice frozen to his skin. He collapsed in front of the body and took Draco’s face between his hands. He was as cold as ice. He couldn't feel the pulse of magic he had felt before. Please, no. Harry begged. He was sure, for a second in the fire, they had done it. But he looked into the blank eyes of Draco, and his hope was extinguished as fast as the flames had disappeared around them.
“We can dispose of them ourselves. I have arranged some of our men to transport the dead to our burial grounds to be identified and put to rest. Please do not feel this duty is yours to burden.” Kingsley nodded and looked back to his team of Aurors.
“I knew a Death Eater-free Hogwarts was too good to be true.”
Malfoy was definitely up to something. His desperate attack on Harry to get his wand back seemed highly indicative of the fact that he was, indeed, up to no good. Harry sat up and looked over to his window and searched the blackness, seeing nothing but an orange reflection of the interior of his room, and his own face. Whatever Malfoy was up to, He was going to find out.
“...you think I should?” Neville finished, looking eagerly into Harry’s face. Harry found himself brushing his quill against his bottom lip, eyes unfocused, before looking up at Neville, humming in false thoughtfulness, and dropping his quill hastily.
“Dark magic always needs a sacrifice. I knew you dying wasn't an option, so I knew the only other way was me.” Harry admitted. Draco nodded. Harry was surprised Draco wasn't more angry at Harry for putting his own neck on the line. They looked at each other, and Harry reached up to touch Draco’s lips, soft and warm under his fingertips.
“The Malfoy’s, as you just mentioned, have been in custody ever since the attack on Hogwarts. Malfoy will be returning to Hogwarts wandless, and hopefully on his best behaviour, as he awaits trial for his crimes. I have been assured the boy will cause no trouble, and the reason I am telling you this is to ask you to do the same.”
“How long.”
“You’re not allowed a wand, You’re under ministry supervision. I would be breaking the law if I gave it back to you, and I, being the hero I am, don’t want to ruin my reputation.” Harry knew he was laying it on a bit thick, but he couldn't help it. Seeing Draco riled up did something to him, made him feel things he hadn't felt for ages. Draco released an impatient breath from his nose. Harry spoke again.
“When the Ministry hears you’re going back there Harry they’ll have my arse for it, they’ll reckon I encouraged you to go back so, for the record, I told you that you were barmy and going back is a massive waste of time, got it?”
“Just one more thing Potter.”
The house elf appeared suddenly in front of him, wearing a tea towel over his shoulder and carrying a steaming pot of tea.
“Well… yea. As soon as I saw you were just… swimming, I didn't suspect you were up to anything, but knowing that stuff about the lake I felt like someone should, I don’t know, just keep an eye on you, just in case? How were you supposed to know the lake was dangerous?” The expression that crossed Draco’s face was unreadable. It had softened from the horror struck expression, but his brows were still pulled close together. He looked conflicted. Harry fidgeted with the sleeve of his sweater, picking at a loose end. He felt foolish for telling this to Malfoy, but maybe, just maybe it would convince Malfoy to reveal his own secrets. After a while of silence, Malfoy huffed a derisive laugh, and sneered up at Harry.
“Malfoy.” the reply came naturally, gratuitously.
“I said not even a look. Gentlemen. You are now to proceed with the rest of the year as if the other doesn’t exist. I will amend your class schedules accordingly so you will no longer have any lessons together. This has gone far enough.” McGonagall shot icy glances at each of them.
Harry sat and watched, the minutes ticking by. At around the 10 minute mark, Harry was getting frustrated. What on earth was this person up to? Why on earth would they risk getting caught out of bed past curfew just to stare at the lake? It made no sense. And as Harry seethed silently at the figure, it started to move.
“Didn’t he get a new one?”
Harry woke with a start and fumbled for his wand on his bedside table. He grasped it, panting, and held it in front of him defensively, before he realised any danger he had perceived was just imaginary. Nightmares like this had become fairly regular for Harry, but in this one, just before he woke, he had felt a horrible burning sensation in his lungs, like they had been filled with water, causing him to lose his breath. Blinking in the darkness he noticed a thin blurry yellow light filtering from underneath his bedroom door. Harry quietly reached for his glasses and pushed them onto his face. Uncovering himself from the heavy duvet he crept towards the door, listening closely to the other side. He heard a couple of swift footsteps on stone, a faint creak of a door, a quick blowing noise - the light under his door immediately extinguishing following it, and a click of a latch. Harry lingered for a few seconds contemplating what he had heard, before deciding on silently opening his own door. He pushed it open and looked around, seeing nothing but blackness. He silently cast ‘Lumos’ illuminating the dark circular landing in a cold blue glow from the tip of his wand. He couldn't tell which of the doors had just closed from behind his own, so aimed the wand light down at the floor, searching for any clues. There was nothing. Except…
“I don’t know. You just- were standing there, I saw your face and it just… I didn't think, I just did what you said.” Malfoy looked annoyed. Harry felt uncomfortable, but almost immediately he felt a low rumble beneath him.
“Impedimenta!” Harry screamed, his wand blasting a few of the bodies away from the pile. But immediately the hole was filled with more flailing bodies, and Malfoy’s form was disappearing into the mountain of Inferi. Harry aimed his wand for Malfoy, who had sunk completely into the mass, and screamed “INCENDIO” - a huge jet of fire exploding from the tip, knocking Harry back. It engulfed the bodies at the top of the pile, and screams like Harry had never heard before erupted from them. Several bodies plummeted back into the lake, engulfed in flame and Harry saw Malfoy’s blonde head reappear from among them. He was unconscious and bleeding from under his hair, red sticky blood flattening the white strands to his face. Harry wished he had his broom, he could fly up and pull him free, but his broom was in Grimmauld place, and he couldn’t apparate there to grab it within the Hogwarts wards. With no other ideas, he shot jet after jet of flames at the Inferi, but the bodies didn't stop coming. Harry felt helpless, looking around for something, anything to help him save Malfoy. He saw Hagrid’s hut in the distance and searched his memory of its contents to try to find something that could help. Ropes? A net? The fire would just burn right through them. He would have to rely on his magic, nothing could help him.
“Malfoy?” Harry interrupted. “I read in the Prophet he was being held with his mother in Malfoy Manor.”
“5 in the morning.”
“Master Harry! You’re home just in time, I was about to serve the tea.”
“Those creatures were supposed to kill me, Potter. You’ve got no idea..” Malfoy hissed and clutched at his side. Harry quickly knelt down beside him and cast a spell over the injury. A broken rib Harry suspected. Malfoy watched as Harry focused on fixing the bone. Harry felt his gaze and tried not to pay attention to it. Harry felt the soft breaths against his hair from above him. Malfoy spoke again in a small voice that made Harry’s neck hair stand on end.
“‘Arry?” A familiar booming voice brought Harry out of his thoughts, and he turned around, a grin appearing across his face.
“Promise me, Potter, that you will try and keep a civil tone around him. I understand you two didn’t get along, especially now with all of your history and the Death Eater business. But it is essential that you do, as many of the students returning will no doubt look to you as a role model.”
“Well can I just make something very clear. The only way you can help me, Potter, is by giving me back my fucking wand.”
“Harry!” Ron jogged the remaining distance between them and slammed into Harry, tipping him off balance in a crushing hug. Harry wobbled on his feet and laughed, a plume of cloudy breath rising above them. Ron pushed Harry out of the hug and looked at him grinning. “Missed you, Mate.”
They came even closer, and Harry looked into Malfoy's burning eyes, passion still seething on his face. Malfoy made an obvious swing of his wand arm, evidently about to cast another spell, but Harry quickly disarmed him, instinctively, and sent Malfoy's wand spinning high into the air behind him and it clattered on the floor among the debris. He looked at Harry furiously, pausing for a millisecond, then pounced forwards, swinging his fist into Harry's wand arm, the contact making Harry growl in pain and drop his wand. Malfoy took Harry by the front of his shirt and shoved him backwards, stumbling with him until Harry's back hit a wall painfully. Harry tried to grab the back of Draco, but Malfoy pinned his shoulders down heavily with his forearms. Malfoy leaned in to the side of Harry's head.
Harry stepped towards the blonde, pocketing his wand and uncorking the dittany with his teeth. Malfoy’s gaze drifted back to Harry, watching his actions, uncertainty painting his face. He watched as Harry stretched out his hand holding the dittany, and held out his other, now wandless hand, gesturing for Malfoy’s injured hand with flicking fingers.
“FIRE MALFOY! THATS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS!” Harry yelled, and Malfoy nodded, and blasted fire beneath him, kicking away the attacking Inferi. Finally, the tower started collapsing, and the number of Inferi was lessening. Bodies were piling up on the shore, Harry had to climb over them to reach Malfoy, who was just finishing off the last few bodies. Finally free of the Inferi, Malfoy stumbled towards Harry, his torso torn and bloody, and collapsed before him, Harry only just catching him under his arms. Wet, from the blood and lake water, Harry pulled Malfoy up, lifting his legs around his waist and stepped back towards the shore. Malfoys skin was almost painfully hot to touch, it was like he himself was on fire. Harry cleared the bodies of the Inferi and carried Malfoy up the shore, before gently letting him down on the grass, and examining his injuries. Malfoy’s legs looked flayed. The skin looked near destroyed. It was gruesome and Harry shuddered. He knew he needed to stop the bleeding immediately, so recited a healing spell. He waved his wand gently over all of Malfoy’s gashes, which slowly started to knit themselves closed. Harry hoped his magic was powerful enough not to leave too bad scarring. He worked his way up Malfoy’s body, paying extra attention to the deeper, more traumatic cuts. He looked at Draco’s face every few seconds to make sure he was still breathing. With every cut healed, Malfoy’s face relaxed, the crease in his brow loosening. Harry’s own body relaxed simultaneously, knowing Malfoy was going to be ok. Finishing up healing, Harry examined Malfoy once more, then stood up, intending to go and get the bag still left at the boulder.
“But as I expected,” She said over Harry’s spluttering,
He and Ron took oversized seats in front of the fire, and Hagrid handed them giant steaming mugs of tea, just how they both liked them. Harry breathed in the steam, and saw his glasses fog over.
This is what they did to each other, Harry thought. How can one person make you feel all of that passion out of hatred? It just wasn't possible.
Hands now free, Harry tugged Malfoy by his belt loops and pressed his hips reciprocally into the other boys’, the pressure sending jolts of pleasure through his core. He heard Malfoy moaning into his mouth at the friction, and bit hungrily at his lip, eliciting a gasp and then a low growl, which he could feel reverberating in his own mouth, making Harry dizzy with lust. Kissing fervently, Harry's fingers unlocked themselves from Malfoy’s belt loops and push their way between the two boys’ flush bodies to finger Draco’s trouser buttons. As he ripped open the top buttons he felt Draco growing harder underneath the tight material, his own body instantly responding with a dizzying rush of blood. But as suddenly as it had started, Malfoy tore himself off Harry, their lips separated, and the warmth of Draco quickly diminished from Harry’s touch.
A few seconds later, Harry heard the sound of footsteps hammering down the stairs, and then,
“HARRY!” He looked around, and saw a group of people sprinting towards them, lead by Ron. He was red in the face, and sweat plastered his red hair to his forehead. He was followed closely behind by a group of men and women dressed in Auror attire. Kingsley Shacklebolt could also be seen a little further back, his embroidered cloak flashing as he ran. Harry stood up, grabbing Malfoy’s hand and pulling him up with him. He didn’t let go of Malfoy.
“You gonna join me?” Malfoy narrowed his eyes and huffed.
“That’s a bit of a stretch, don’t you think?” Ginny raised an eyebrow and Harry smirked.
“You should've stayed home, kept Narcissa company, seeing as your good for nothing Father isn't there to-”
The Giant Squid knew he was going to die. He could sense it, a large, dark pulsating energy was hiding deep in the Lake that wished very much to break out and consume everything in its path. The Squid had been keeping it at bay for a while, pushing back against it, but he knew that soon it would grow too powerful. He had been the guardian of the Black Lake for centuries; he had seen thousands of witches and wizards come and go from Hogwarts, had witnessed wars and battles time after time, both wizarding and muggle. But now, something has changed. The vibrations in the lake was the first sign. His intuition felt a shift in the nature of the water. From the moment The Battle of Hogwarts had ended, the Lake was still, and the Squid knew something was wrong. He spent his final weeks holding back this darkness from the rest of the Lake, trying to protect its inhabitants from the inevitable, until one day, on a moonlit night in August, the darkness engulfed the Squid. He always knew he would die protecting his home, but to be defeated so soon was his only regret. With his last breath, the Giant Squid pushed it back as hard as he could. He knew it wasn't enough. He closed his eyes, and slowly but surely, he let go, and it swallowed him. He felt himself rise, and just before the Squid gave himself over, he breached the surface of the Lake, and looked up at the moon one last time. The Giant Squid floated quietly on the black mirror, and Death took him, finally.
“You too Nev.”
“Give. Me. My. Wand. Potter.” Draco said in a growl between heavy breaths. The sharp point dug deeper into the soft curve of Harry's neck, making him stretch his head back and push his face into the sheets. Harry cursed himself for letting his guard down. What the hell had he been thinking? The point of Draco’s dagger was starting to sting significantly, and he felt sharp nails digging into the skin of his chest from Draco's other hand.
“Malfoy.”
“Brilliant. You’re coming here for Christmas though, alright?”
Of course it did, even if they did have to obliterate the place before realising it themselves.
Draco was sat at the small table, one hand holding a steaming cup near his lips, the other one the armrest of the ornate chair he was sat in. He watched Harry walk in through his eyelashes. Harry held his gaze tensely as he stepped in, keeping his distance from the other boy. Last time they were in a room together, things hadn't ended well. He tightened his grip around his concealed wand.
But the truth hit Harry with resounding disappointment. Malfoy wasn't up to anything at all. He was telling the truth. He was just waiting for his trial. There was nothing more to it.
“That’s what you’ve been trying to do, isn’t it. It’s the lake. Whatever is happening inside it, you’re making it happen.” Harrys brain was whirring.
Harry watched, perplexed, as the other boy ignored the food entirely, and turned back towards the spiral staircase. Harry wanted Malfoy to carry on, stay there, say something else. A yearning to hear his voice thrummed through Harry, a weird need that, now that had had a taste of, he now needed more. It was a strange feeling, an odd desperation Harry didn't quite understand.
A blast of fire heading towards him made him duck, and a scorching hot wave engulfed him.
“Hagrid, we need to warn the mer-people, tell them what’s really going on.”
“...can see the damage its ‘ad on the shore an’ all.. Ah, Harry, Ron, Minister! Glad your'e all ‘ere, I just managed to get ‘old of the mer-people, this is one of them seniors, Dale, and he's representing the mer-people.” Harry watched as Dale rose slightly from the water, glistening skin and muscle revealing itself from the darkness.
“Only if you tell me what’s going on. I promise I will give it back if you tell me.” Harry reasoned. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Alright, ill try me best.”
Harry looked at his watch, which read 11.24pm. Time to go to bed, he thought gratuitously. He’d send a letter to Ron in the morning, confirming both their suspicions that nothing strange-
Another muffled moan of pain made Harry straighten, the sheets falling limply off his torso, realising the sound was emitting from behind his own bedroom door. Harry's heart thumped unpleasantly, and he was suddenly terrified. He was the only one left here, what the hell was going on? Had someone snuck into Hogwarts, having found out he was alone here, to try and hurt him? Harry clambered out of bed grabbing his wand from the nightstand, and stood defensively in front of the door, wand outstretched. His hand shook slightly, and he tried to calm himself, thinking that whoever it was must not have known about the protective wards on the rooms, so was probably pretty defenceless right now. Harry took a deep breath in, and wordlessly lit the tip of his wand, illuminating his door in pale white light, and stepped forward, gripping the door handle, and with a rush of adrenaline, pulled it open.
“There must be another way. You were forced into this Malfoy, you can’t die because of this.” Harrys voice was raised. This wasn't fair. Malfoy wasn't trying to hurt anyone, he was trying to fix this. The low rumble was getting louder, and Harry started to panic. Draco didn't move. Harry fell onto the ground before Malfoy and grabbed his shoulders.
“Honestly, as long as there's no Death Eaters around, NEWT’s will be a breeze.”
Neither of them spoke, but Harry shifted uncomfortably on the cold, wet stone floor. Ignoring Malfoy would be a monumental task. He didn’t think a single day had gone by this year where they didn’t at least threaten each other. They were enemies, and they liked to remind each other and everyone in the school on a regular basis. At this point, it had practically become a competition to see who could piss each other off the most.
“You know you can ask me for anything, anytime Neville. I mean that. You’re a great friend.” Neville smiled warmly up at Harry.
The rumble became louder and louder, until harry felt the ground shaking under his feet. He looked up at Malfoy, who was still in the lake unmoving, and felt an overwhelming sense of fear. What was going on?
“I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR CHILDISH BRAWLING!”
They got to the statue of the embracing couple, and Draco stood before it, looking up at the faces of the individuals.
“I'm guessing it means if one of us dies, the other dies too.” Harry said, simply, looking back at Ron. “I think we will manage.” Harry smiled at Ron, who was now shaking his head, like he couldn't comprehend what Harry was saying. Kingsley stepped forward, and placed a large hand on Ron’s shoulder. Ron looked up at him mournfully. Kingsley gave him a small smile, and Ron sighed, looking down at his feet. Harry felt he could explain everything later over a tall glass of fire whiskey. Harry looked at the bald wizard, who still had his wand pointed at Malfoy.
Harry looked at the photo again, and thought angrily of all the times he had been a ‘witness’ to Lucius Malfoy acting under Voldemort's orders. Without thinking, Harry pulled his wand out from his pocket and silently performed a summoning spell for a pot of ink, a quill and some parchment. Immediately he heard a cry of pain followed by a smash of glass from somewhere above him. Harry had momentarily forgotten he was at the Weasley’s, not in his own kitchen at 12 Grimmauld Place. A piece of torn parchment zoomed into the room and into his hand, and a quill landed neatly in front of him.
“You think too much. I’ve always just thought they were annoying.” The eyes of the stone statue seemed to look down at Harry, irritated.
“Why are you trying to get into my room, Malfoy.” Harry said, quietly, trying not to sound too confrontational. He was angry with Malfoy of course, but looking at his pained expression did something inside of him he couldn’t explain. The whole time they’d been back at school Harry had wanted to get a reaction from him, but maybe this was his chance. A chance to understand what on earth was happening with this boy to make him act so strangely.
“I promise.” And then he uncrossed his arms, and placed a hand on his chest.
“No I DON’T!” Malfoy shouted and lurched forward, shoving Harry backwards and making him stumble, hitting the door behind him. Harry reached for his wand but Malfoy was on him too fast, grabbing his wrists and pressing them between their chests.
“C'mon Harry, that potions essay is due tomorrow. you can have a look at mine if you want. Don’t waste any of your thoughts on that heartless rag.” Harry raised an eyebrow at her, surprised by her mean spirit. Ginny looked down at the dark wet trail Malfoy had left in his wake.
“Well I got your letter and thought it seemed a bit odd, so thought I’d swing by and ask you more about what's happening. Honestly though, its been so busy at work it was nice to just have an excuse to come here and relax for a day.” Ron admitted, and smiled guiltily. Hagrid laughed heartily.
“Good. now. I Just wanted to inform you of a few things before you get started. Obviously you are my first choice as Head Boy-” Harry’s choke interrupted McGonagall’s sentence, and he quickly gulped at his tea to clear his throat.
“Will you just bloody explain what’s going on?”
“MALFOY HEIR WALKS FREE, MINISTRY CRITICISED FOR TRADE DEAL”
Professor McGonagall
“Anyway, don’ want to keep ye ‘Arry, you head on in, I’ll see you tonigh’ at the feast. Gotta go prepare for all the youngen's arrivin’!”
To which an enormous jet of water, like that from a fire hose, erupted from his wand. Harry wasn't quite anticipating the sheer power of it, evidently intensified by his fury, and was thrown backwards himself, hitting a stone wall and smashing his head against it, seeing stars. The jet of water pummelled Draco, who was holding his hands up over his head uselessly, before he came to his senses and created a huge shield, exploding the water away from him, further soaking the onlooking crowd, who shrank further away from the pair as the battle became more turbulent. White hair and uniform dripping, shirt translucent and sticking to his heaving chest, Draco laughed. Harry ceased the water spell and pushed himself off the wall, running at Draco. He was losing strength and his head was pounding but he needed to shut the bastard up. A fist connected with Draco's jaw before the other boy had time to even register Harry pelting towards him, and Harry followed him down as they fell heavily to the floor. A mad struggle ensued, before Draco pulled an arm free and collided it with Harry's nose, which spurted hot red liquid onto the pavestones and down Harry's face. Draco grabbed the front of Harry’s shirt with both fists and pushed him over onto his back, at which point Harry kicked out from underneath him, bucking the blond off-balance to land heavily on top of Harry. Nose to nose, they struggled with each other for a moment before Harry caught Malfoy’s left wrist with his free hand and yanked it awkwardly behind Malfoy’s own back, eliciting a yell of pain and forcing Malfoy forward, head butting Harry painfully as the side of his head collided with his own. He was half way through trying to heave Malfoy to the ground before a loud BANG made his head snap to the side.
“Mr Malfoy, times up.” An Auror said from behind Malfoy, and he heard footsteps approaching him.
“Oh not too bad, mostly bin tidyin’ this place up a bit after... well y’know. Was a bi’ messy like.” Harry thought this was the understatement of the century, but smiled and nodded at the larger man. He looked around the courtyard and raised his eyebrows, impressed. The castle was practically rubble the last time he saw it, but it had been thoughtfully rebuilt to its former glory.
“I’ll try my best Professor.”
The mermaids swam in their frames, watching the two of them splashing around in the water. It was rare for them to ever see anybody in here, let alone two people. They watched and smiled, occasionally looking out of the window to the outside, where they saw the lake, stretching for what seemed like miles, as black as night, which was finally moving again at last.
Draco opened his palm and looked down at the mark on it. The burn was still visible, H.P branded into his skin. It was time to get his wand back, and reclaim himself.
Harry blinked, taken aback. Of course, she was right. He’d completely forgotten he still had it. Harry tried to remember where he had stored it, but couldn't for the life of him remember where it was. He was a little bit blurry on the events that happened immediately after defeating the most powerful dark wizard of all time, it seemed.
These were some of the questions bouncing around Harry's brain for the rest of the day he'd had such an early start to. Harry blamed it on the lack of sleep, but he felt utterly disconcerted with this new situation he'd been confronted with. Draco Malfoy was up to something. Of course, Harry had already considered the possibility he was making a big deal out of nothing, given Malfoy and his past,- but he was not exactly behaving normally, at least in Harry’s opinion. Malfoy was uncharacteristically well behaved; he was never late, didn't cause disruptions, wasn't making jokes or comments about anything, he wasn't even asking questions. Harry thought it was entirely not in Draco’s character and it was making him very suspicious. He was being too good. Too quiet. Harry could only derive that he was therefore hiding something. Harry ignored the tugging feeling in his stomach when he thought about how broken and vulnerable Malfoy had looked when he’d seen him. Someone who looks like they didn't seem capable of being up to anything evil. But all the other things he'd seen and heard about Malfoy still made him suspicious, regardless of Malfoy’s appearance. He spoke to Ginny about it after classes that evening, once again in front of a huge stack of homework, across from the common room fireplace. He asked her if she had also noticed his odd behaviour, and she frowned at him.
“Then I’d say its yours. If the Ministry can’t prove he’s hidden it I wouldn’t feel guilty about not handing it in. The law is a bit messed up when it comes to wands so I doubt they’ll take it much further. Seriously Harry, I wouldn’t tell them anything.”
“HEAD GIRL!” Ginny shrieked as she held the unfolded parchment McGonagall had slipped in front of her just seconds earlier.
A second later he was on his knees in front of Harry, grabbing his hair again and kissing him hard.
“Malfoy...” he said cautiously, and stepped towards him slowly, like he was approaching a wild animal. He reached a hand forward and Malfoy looked at it, before leaning back and touching the table behind him.
Harry looked at the window next to the mantlepiece, watching the rain thrum against the glass. He pondered for a moment about what Malfoy could’ve been doing for the last 7 days, but was quickly brought back to the room by a swat on his arm.
“Lucius Malfoy, Known previously for his significant influence at the Ministry Of Magic, is now due to stand trial for his crimes as a Death Eater during You Know Who’s reign of terror. He is currently being held in a high security cell in Azkaban, while his Wife, Narcissa, (left) and son, Draco, (right) are at their home in Wiltshire under Auror supervision. It is yet unclear whether they too will receive trials for their part in the atrocities. Lucius Malfoy will stand trial on the 17th of September, and the Wizengamot encourages any witnesses of Lucius Malfoy's crimes to please come forward to give a statement.”
“What’d you do that for?”
“Anyway, I knew you were going to be Head Girl, McGonagall told me earlier.”
“I thought I was keeping you safe.” Harry said, defensively. Malfoy stared up at Harry angrily again.
“What do you think I should do? I don’t want Malfoy to have it, but I feel bad keeping it if they’ve suspected him of concealing it when he hasn’t. But on the other hand, if I gave it to the Ministry…”
“If you were supposed to die then why did you fight when I revived you?” Harry said. Malfoy’s jaw tightened and he looked away from Harry.
Harry, realising how much trouble he could get in if he was caught out of bed after curfew, hastily turned back towards the door, until a voice from across the room made him pause.
“I don’t know about you Malfoy but I normally take off my clothes when I have a bath.” Harry looked seriously at Malfoy, before pulling down his boxers, kicking them aside and in one swift move, jumped with an echoing “whoop” into the bubbles. A huge splash later, Harry resurfaced, the warm water burning his skin in the best way. He squinted and rubbed his eyes under his glasses, and saw Malfoy, completely soaked from Harry's entry into the bath. He laughed at the sight of a furious, soaked Malfoy. It was uncontrollable. He could feel Malfoy’s annoyance pounding in his chest but that only made it funnier. Harry swam to the side of the pool and rested his head on his chin, looking up at the other boy. He smiled innocently as his laughter died down.
Harry finished the article and looked up from his paper. Malfoy had tried to bring a wand to Hogwarts? Seeing as he’d have to have kept that a secret from the teachers and students, Harry could only think that Malfoy’s motives for trying to get a wand into Hogwarts weren’t entirely innocent. Harry looked across the room and over to the Slytherin table. Unsurprisingly, Malfoy was not present at breakfast. Harry presumed that Malfoy was avoiding drawing any more unwanted attention on himself, and had probably made use of the common room dining area, which Harry had learned filled up with food 3 times a day at the same time as the tables in the Great Hall did. Harry checked his watch and saw he was late for Potions, so downed his pumpkin juice, threw his Daily Prophet into his heavy bag and quickly made for the dungeons.
“Don't you… you do realise what this means Harry?” Ron asked, brow creased in concern.
“Nonsense m’boy! A few minutes of lateness never rusted a cauldron. Come, take a seat. Now as I was saying…” Slughorn continued lecturing, and Harry looked around the cramped potions room, his stomach dropping when he saw where the only vacant space was. Trying not to let his contempt spill over to his demeanour, Harry approached the seat, slung his bag on the counter and sat in the stool next to Draco Malfoy. He glanced at him tentatively and waited, but Malfoy did not react. His grey eyes remained very much fixed on Slughorn, his quill in his slender hand taking notes occasionally. He was ignoring Harry entirely. Slightly relieved, but still unnerved, Harry pulled out his own note taking equipment. The lesson contained no practical element today, to Harry’s relief. The idea of having to talk to Malfoy made his heart skip unpleasantly, so he thanked Merlin that this was just a theoretical lesson. However, Harry did feel a little bit hot, overly aware and self conscious sat next to the blonde. It was extremely unusual, seeing someone who was once so full of derision and spite, insults ready at any moment to be hurled at the nearest victim, be so quiet and withdrawn. Harry was anticipating that at any moment he would hear a whispered insult in his ear, or a sharp prod of a quill between his ribs, but nothing ever came. It was highly unsettling, and by the end of the lesson, Harry was thoroughly disconcerted. On one hand, he was happy he didn't have to make unwanted conversation with the boy, especially as he knew he'd have to be polite and non-confrontational as he promised McGonagall, but on the other hand he was put at a slight unease that Malfoy hadn't said something, anything at all, or given him any indication that he was even aware that he was sat next to Harry for the entire lesson. When the bell chimed, Malfoy swiftly packed up and turned to leave. Harry watched him do so with vague confusion, and as he left, looked at the empty space Malfoy had been sat in. there was an air about it that didn't sit well in Harry’s stomach. It wasn't like Harry cared about how Malfoy was feeling, he hated the git after all. This was surely exactly what Harry had wanted from Draco for the whole of the last 6 years of his life - for him to leave him alone. So why did he feel so uneasy?
But before Harry could ask, Kreacher turned around and paced off intently, leaving the room. Harry followed.
“I've got your wand, Malfoy. If you would just tell me what’s going on then maybe-”
“MALFOY!” He called out, he face twisted in worry. The blonde whipped his head over his shoulder, locking eyes with Harry. Harry’s stomach dropped and he skidded to a halt at the water's edge. Malfoys eyes were not his own. There was nothing behind them, no piercing blue, no passion, no light. It made Harry feel sick.
“How many bloody times- Merlin, Potter I don’t need your help! I know exactly what’s going on in that lake and there’s nothing you can do to help!” Malfoys mouth snapped shut, and he blinked, eyes darting down away from Harry’s. Harry felt his pulse quicken.
‘Meet me in the Room of Requirement at 11pm.’
“Saturday. Hagrid told him there’s something up with the Lake, might be worth looking into.”
“But...you…here...” Draco stammered, his voice quavering. The idea was unbearable. She couldn't.
The rest of the day passed in a haze for Harry. He didn't sit next to Malfoy in any of his other classes they had together, but he was consistently ignored by him regardless of where in the room they were both located. He found himself paying less and less attention to the lessons, and more and more attention focused on the blonde as the day went on. Malfoy looked only slightly less dishevelled in person that he did in the pictures Harry had seen in the papers. His hair had grown unruly, falling in strands over his ears and down the back of his neck. There was a gauntness about his face - reminding Harry of Sirius when he’d just escaped Azkaban. Harry wondered if Malfoy had been to Azkaban yet, whether this was just a general trait of those who’d been there. Harry also considered this might just be Malfoy getting older, losing the boyish roundness and inheriting the Black family bone structure. It was strange to think that the Malfoy’s were related to the Blacks, but Draco’s face described the family line perfectly through his cheekbones. They were particularly noticeable during their Herbology lesson, where a ray of sun had filtered through the glass ceiling of Greenhouse One and struck Draco directly on the corner of his face, putting his cheek into sharp relief against the bone, his hair also glowing as if from within. In this moment Harry realised he was staring at Malfoy, and hastily looked away. Why was he just sitting there, every lesson? Why did he seem so… broken? Harry had anticipated him being moody, argumentative, full of anger, but this Malfoy just looked and acted as if he'd given up. And for some reason, this did not please Harry as he thought it would have, it just made him sad. Malfoy was once full of spirit, albeit a pretty unpleasant, mean spirit, but now he was acting like a dementor had already sucked his soul out of him.
Moments passed but Draco said nothing. He just frowned and looked at the floor. Harry pressed on.
“What am I doing?” Announced Harry. “You're the one who started it! You kissed me!” Harry panted, leaning heavily on the wall behind him. He stared perplexed at the blonde, who stood before him, looking furious, his trousers half opened. Harry couldn't help the jolt of lust that rain through his groin looking at the dishevelled blonde. He finally understood why fighting with Malfoy had felt so good.
“I’ll be ok, Draco. Trust me, I promise everything is going to be ok.” She smiled, but the smile didn't make it to her eyes and Draco felt his heart break in his chest.
“Your mother, she… took a life sentence so you could go free.” Harry said, eyes on Malfoy, who’s own eyes quickly darted to the floor.
“A wise choice, I whole-heartedly agree. I have already decided Head Girl will be Ginny Weasley. Those two were a great testament to the school during the dark times.”
“Mother.”
Sprinting, Harry launched himself into the potions classroom, earning the response of almost every head in the class turning to look at him.
“Hogwarts… well, I got a job haven’t I? I don't need to do NEWT’s. And neither do you Harry, everyone wants you in the Ministry.”
“Feel sick.” Harry mumbled through a mouth stuffed with chicken. He swallowed, wiped his lips with the back of his sleeve and climbed over the bench, ignoring the baffled faces of his friends looking up to see him rapidly exit the Great Hall. He wasn't exactly sure what he was doing, but the last 2 days of Draco Malfoy pointedly ignoring his entire existence and acting like a ghost had lit a fire of burning curiosity inside of him, which he couldn't figure out how to extinguish. He wanted Malfoy to do something. Say something at least. And getting him on his own seemed like the only way of doing it.
“Potter.”
Harry waited for a response, but Malfoy just blinked up at him, his eyes flicked quickly from Harry's eyes down to his bare chest, Harry feeling suddenly self conscious at his lack of clothing, and then back up to Harry's face, lingering wordlessly on his eyes before his mouth twisted in a grimace, and he looked down at the arm he was clutching. His left hand was clenched in a fist, shaking slightly. Harry lowered his wand to see it better. Slowly Malfoy uncurled his fingers, revealing an orange glow, which when Malfoy fully opened his hand, read ‘H.P’. Harry, having seen this effect before at the beginning of the year on Seamus when he'd tried getting into Dean's room, was unsurprised. Looking at Malfoy however, his expression of pain transformed into one of mild confusion, then irritation. Harry decided to remedy his lack of understanding.
“I came back to finish what I started, Potter.” Draco spoke quietly. “My education.”
“Merlin's beard!” Hagrid cried, and clapped his hands over his ears.
This however, was utterly unbearable.
“Alright Aurors, let's get a move on. We might even still get in another raid if we hurry up!” Kingsley bellowed.
“I told you not to follow me, Potter.” Harry finished the healing charm and looked up at Malfoy, their faces only a few inches apart. Malfoy was still covered in his own blood. He was shivering slightly, and Harry realised how cold he must be, practically naked on the side of the freezing lake.
“I did not come back to Hogwarts to fight with you. I'm tired of fighting. I’m here awaiting my fate Potter. Sorry if that bothers you but I had no choice.” Malfoy didn't look at Harry as he said this, just stared at the floor. Harry was silenced, and couldn't do anything except stare at the head of the blond that stood across from him. He tried to say something, but nothing came out. Was this really all Malfoy was? No secrets, no motives, nothing? Just apathy, waiting, hopelessly?
He opened the door to a reasonably sized room, and saw a classic Hogwarts four poster bed with scarlet bedding standing centrally against the back wall. a dark wooden wardrobe stood on the furthest wall from him with a small door leading off to what Harry assumed was a private bathroom. A simple desk and bookcase filled the nearest wall. A pair of red and gold curtains was hanging closed opposite the bed, a thin slither of light filtering through the small gap, showcasing swirling particles of dust rising in the spotlight.  Harry stepped forwards towards the window, pulled the curtains apart, and his eyes widened.
“Malfoy, look. If you just told me what’s going on, maybe I could help-” Suddenly all the wind was knocked out of his lungs and he was launched backwards, until his calves hit the bed frame painfully and his back slammed down onto his sheets. A sudden intrusion of a cold sharp point was against his throat and a very heavy weight was on his hips, trapping him. Harry blinked through watering eyes to see Malfoy straddling him, pinning Harry's arms painfully down at his sides with his knees. Malfoy’s face was hovering inches over his, his hard fast breaths warm against Harry's cheek.
Harry swelled with excitement, and looked across the table at Ginny, who was eyeing the parchment curiously, chewing own a mouthful of breakfast.
“Do shut up Potter, before I reopen that split lip of yours.”
Harry stood, and eyed the other boy, lingering in the doorway. His brain whirred. Malfoy looked unsure, a frown creasing his brows. His eyes were still darting around the room, searching. Searching for what?
Deciding he'd had enough, Harry pulled out his wand and leapt up, running with huge strides towards the shore.
“I am extremely pleased you chose to return to Hogwarts, Harry. I was certain I would get no reply from you, and find out you had taken a job at the Auror Office. I wonder why you have chosen to come back here, rather than pursue that path? As I recall, that was the only thing you were interested in as a career choice.” The Professor eyed Harry over her glasses, but in a kind, almost motherly way. Harry took a sip of tea and thought about what he wanted to say.
“Same goes for you pal. Any time. Oh! By the way, Merry Christmas Harry. I guess you’ll be heading home this weekend too.” Harry paused and looked at his watch, the two inner circles revealing the date to be 20/12. Crikey. It was the Christmas Holidays soon and Harry hadn’t even realised. He’d been so busy with NEWT preparation, homework, and...
“Uh, yea ok. I’ll think about it some more, then.”
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and copied Draco’s hurried exit of Grimmauld Place, slamming the door shut and jumping down the steps onto the street. Picturing Hogsmeade, he turned, the image of Malfoy staining his destination in his mind.
Harry thanked Neville, and squeezed his shoulder as he got up from his spot in the library, feeling a little guilty that he hadn't listened to Neville's' problem more carefully, now that Neville had helped him with his own issue.
Ginny then exploded into conversation with Neville about their newly appointed statuses, so Harry looked around the hall, leaving them to revel in the good news. He recognised nearly all of the faces at the tables now, except some of the youngest students. They all recognised him too by the looks of it, many of them pointing and whispering, some waving and giggling. Harry politely smiled as he looked around, pretending he didn't mind the attention. Glancing over to the Slytherin table, he wasn't surprised to see there were only around half as many students sat on that table than the other houses. He suddenly remembered what McGonagall had said about Draco Malfoy, and quickly scanned the length of the table for a white blond head, but to no avail. Malfoy wasn’t there. Harry exhaled, and turned back around to face the other Gryffindor's.
“I’m not sure what made me do it, but the thought of you being killed by something I created was just...” Malfoy trailed off and frowned, then looked up at Harry.
“There MUST be another way!” He shouted into the other boys face. Malfoy looked at him, confusion and fear etched onto his face at Harry’s outburst. Harry picked up Malfoy’s wand and thrust it into the others hand, and held it there as he felt each other's magic pulsing between each other. Malfoy sat up, moving in closer into Harry.
“Yep. It was pretty late. I was only awake because…” Harry remembered the nightmare and shivered. “I woke up from a bad dream.” Ron nodded, understanding painting his face.
The unpleasant feeling only intensified as the weeks went by. Harry had also noticed himself constantly looking out for Malfoy, hoping he’d see a blonde head bobbing along a corridor or in the Great Hall. Sometimes he would get a glimpse of white and something would rush through him like a hot flash of adrenaline. One time, he’d actually found him, and watched Malfoy eat lunch in the Great Hall, the ball of heat in his stomach growing bigger and bigger as he watched the other boy moodily pick at his food, his sleeves rolled up and his white hair flopping over his creased brow, before a stinging sensation broke out over his face and he looked up to the teachers table to see McGonagall looking at him with a raised brow. Harry looked at her guilty and rubbed his face, urging the stinging away, and went back to eating, keeping his eyes down, the image of Malfoy pounding in his head like a virus.
Draco stared, eyes darting around Harry’s wanton form.
“Harry…”
Harry jerked his shoulders, trying to get free, but Malfoy just pressed himself harder against him, this time bringing his hips forward to also trap Harry's lower half in place. Harry struggled against him, pointlessly. Malfoy laughed, and Harry felt his hot breath against his face, stinging in the places where his skin had evidently broken, exposing damp, raw flesh.
“Infractus”
“The Daily Prophet will have an absolute ball if you start telling stories about Malfoy no one else has heard. Don’t you think the ministry has enough evidence to put Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban for the rest of his sodding life already? I know what kind of charges they already have Harry. They're just doing this for the media fanfare. Get dirt on Malfoy to take the attention away from the fact the entire Ministry got infiltrated by Death Eaters. I’d leave it mate, honestly.”
“This is a dark detector. Pretty standard bit of Auror kit. you tell it to fly off and it does a little survey of the area. See its wings there? They pick up on traces of dark magic. Helps us find objects that have a strong magical aura.” Ron whispered something unintelligible, and tapped the little object with his wand and it sprung into the air, wings vibrating madly. Ron gestured his wand forward, pointing over the lake, and off it went. It was fast, almost the speed of the snitch, and just as agile. It flew across the surface of the lake, suddenly stopping every now and again and darting over a patch of lake, to then race off in another direction. Harry kept his eyes on it for as long as he could, the object familiar yet different, and he imagined himself flying over the lake on his broomstick, chasing it as it zoomed inches above the rippling water. After a few minutes, the dark detector returned, and Ron caught it as it flew rapidly back towards him.
He tried to remain positive. He had the wand. All was well.
“Accio clothes.” Harry muttered, and the folded clothes on the boulder flew over to him. He unfolded the cloak and held it out. Malfoy eyed it, as if to deny it, but took it reluctantly and pulled it over his naked shoulders. Harry sat back, and looked at Malfoy.
“Ron’s coming to visit!” Harry announced. Ginny frowned and swallowed her mouthful.
“Potter.” Harry stopped, and looked back at Malfoy, his heart jumping slightly at hearing his name.
“What the hell is wrong with you?”
The two of them stepped up to the broad wooden door of Hagrid’s home, and Harry knocked on it loudly, to which several booming barks emitted from inside the hut. Ron and Harry smiled at each other. Heavy footsteps sounded from behind the door, before it swung inwards, revealing a curious looking Hagrid peering down at them. His expression split into an enormous grin of recognition as his eyes flitted between them.
Harry's brow creased and he stood up again, unconsciously, pressing his hand against the pane. He needed to go down there, drag him out. He was going to get sick, the stupid git. He needed to go get him, shake some sense into him.
“Inferi!” Ron wheezed as he came to a stop in front of them, doubling over, struggling to get his breath back. Harry watched as the aurors skidded to a halt, the majority of them armed with their wands, looking around for the danger. One of them, a tall, bald wizard Harry vaguely recognised, locked eyes on Malfoy, and pointed his wand at his chest.
“DEAN! Your bloody door handle burned me!” Seamus screeched, and shakily opened his palm to reveal a glowing “D.T” stamped on his palm. He looked murderous as the three other boys roared with laughter.
“Yea, I guess you’re right. Thanks mate. Neville reached out a hand and patted Harry comradely on the arm. Harry couldn’t help himself, he glanced back over to Malfoy’s desk, and saw, with a touch of relief, Malfoy getting up to leave. After watching Malfoy disappear behind a bookshelf, Harry heard Neville sigh. He looked back around at him, his temperature finally returning to normal. Neville was looking at the place where Malfoy had just been.
Hogwarts Board of Governors has decided to offer all students who did not complete their N.E.W.T studies last year an additional year of study to complete their magical education and sit their examinations.

All 8th year students will have a shared living space, separate from their house common rooms. As adults, we expect mutual respect and cooperation with the other students from different houses during your final stay at Hogwarts.
Harry knew hatred. Hatred was slow, scary and cruel. This, whatever this was, was not born from hatred. Harry laughed at how obvious it was now. He sank to the floor, and chuckled himself into a stupor. He looked up at Malfoy through blurry eyes and cracked glasses, and his laughter doubled when he saw the dumbstruck look on Malfoy's face.
“Will you stop.” Malfoy grabbed Harry’s shirt, and looked angrily at him.
What had Malfoy been up to last night? Why had he been so late? And was it him in the cloak down at the Lake?
Harry pondered this. His mind went immediately to Ron, but as he wasn’t returning… A moment later a surge of inspiration gave him his answer.
Malfoy looked from side to side and paused, before undoing his cloak entirely, and letting it fall onto the boulder behind him. He unbuckled his belt and let his trousers fall too. Harry frowned, a hot flush of confusion and embarrassment engulfing him. What on earth was Malfoy doing?
“Don't follow me, Potter. I’m warning you.” Malfoy yanked open the front door and Harry ran, arm outstretched, but in vain - Malfoy hurried down the steps, turned on his heel and disappeared. Harry reached the door frame and hung off it, watching as the last piece of Malfoy vanished into thin air. Panic rose in his chest, and from his lips escaped a frustrated shout. Shit, shit, this was bad. What had he been thinking? He hadn't even got Malfoy’s plan out of him before he vanished. Where had he gone? Harry slammed the door and went back to the living room, and paced the length of it. Malfoy was in danger, he was a certain. Would he have gone straight back to the lake? Was he that stupid as to go and face whatever was in there without anyone knowing about it? Harry knew of course. Malfoy’s words echoed in his head. His cries of “I don’t need your help” ringing in his memory. The image of his smile when he was reunited with his wand. But then his sudden determination. Oh god. What was he about to do?
This house had always been empty. The hallways and enormous rooms had always felt a few degrees too cold, and the quietness of the whole place had always been unnerving, echoed noises bouncing through the manor like ghosts.
Harry lay on his bed, bewildered in the silence that engulfed the room. What the fuck had just happened? There was so much he needed to process, so much new information, but his mind was throbbing, a haze hanging over him. All he could think about was how Malfoy had felt underneath him, how his implied words made Harry weak. Harry had the upper hand, he was about to get the truth out of Malfoy, he was so close, and then - the image of Malfoy, wrists tied to the posts of his bed, pounded in Harry's mind, a lump catching in his throat. No. God no. Not Malfoy. He’d just attacked him for gods sake, he'd had him at knife point. Harry flopped down onto his back and pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes. What the hell was wrong with him? Harry tried to concentrate, to think about what he’d just learned. Malfoy had tried to get his wand back from Harry, and Harry had told him he had it, just not in Hogwarts. Harry knew it was somewhere in Grimmauld Place, and now he’d definitely have to find it, keep it within his possession from now on. It wasn't safe there anymore. Malfoy knew that was his home, and considering his Black family bloodline, Malfoy probably wouldn’t find getting inside the house very difficult if he attempted to break in and steal it. He’d have to go tomorrow to be safe. Malfoy had also let slip that the Auror's were coming to get him in the morning, but did not say where they were taking him. There was no guarantee he'd be under supervision for the whole of the Christmas Holidays however, so getting to Grimmauld Place and finding the wand was even more urgent. He’d go tomorrow morning, as soon as he'd seen Malfoy had been taken away. Mrs Weasley wouldn’t mind if he didn't arrive until a bit later on in the day.
“They're coming!” Harry shouted, and grabbed Draco by the elbow, pulling him onto his feet.
“Yes, you were right about that. But what on earth could a wandless Malfoy be realistically getting up to in Hogwarts these days? The war is over Harry. The danger is gone, there's nothing more Malfoy could do even if he wanted to. He's a sad, powerless ex-Death Eater who's just keeping his head above the surface Harry. I really don't think there's any more to it.” Ginny continued to scratch away at her parchment. Harry frowned into the roaring fire. She was right of course, but something still didn’t sit right with him. Even if Ginny was correct, and Malfoy wasn't actually getting up to anything, he still didn't like the fact he was being so… dull. That's something Malfoy just wasn't. He was arrogant, annoying, condescending. Now he was just… apathetic. Malfoy didn't even look concerned about his fate any more. He looked helpless, broken. and that scared Harry far more than any way Malfoy had behave before.
“C’mon then, its bloody freezin’. Let’s go back inside, you can tell me all about your dark wizard catchin’ Ron, and i'll crack out the fire whiskey.”
“But..” Neville's eyes scanned the page, back and forth, and then flickered upwards to connect with Harry’s.
“Was gonna make myself a cuppa if you fancied it. It's a bit early, I know, but I can't get used to these bleedin’ beds. I’d worn my old one in nicely over the years, you know?”
It was still very early in the morning, Harry had wanted to set off before most people were up and about, and in plenty of time of the other students arriving. He also wanted to talk to McGonagall before everything got underway. He felt like he owed it to her, and thank her for allowing him to return. Harry began the long walk up to the castle from Hogsmeade, first passing the shops and pubs of the high street, then ascending the winding path up towards the castle, which he eventually saw looming above him as he reached the top of the hill. It stood as grand as ever before him, the tall towers and spires stretching into the sky, and at the base of it, the Black Lake glimmered in the morning sunlight, stiller than Harry had seen it in a long time. It looked almost like a mirror, with shadows of life hidden deep beneath its glassy surface. Harry continued on until he reached the courtyard, and stopped in front of the old castle doors. They looked the same as they always had, but on closer inspection Harry could see the cracks and scars they had acquired during the Battle of Hogwarts, the legacy of spells and debris that pummelled the castle evident on its old surface. Harry reached out a hand and felt the ridges of the wood, remembering everything that happened that night. He hadn't been back since, and felt a pang of guilt for not being here for the restoration.
Draco Malfoy was stood two rows away, staring at him, a pile of books at his feet. He too looked irritated and hot. A flush blossomed over his pale cheeks, and his hair was curling slightly in the humidity. He looked furious. They locked eyes and Harry's stomach twisted oddly. Malfoy’s pupils were blown, his chest rising and falling visibly, the top 3 buttons of his half tucked in shirt exposing the gleaming skin of it. Harry formed a fist in his hand on the desk and Malfoy’s mouth tightened. There were too many people around. Harry knew that if they acted up and started a fight right now they’d both certainly be expelled. Instead, they just stared at each other, hungrily. Draco licked his lips, and Harry swallowed. He knew Draco was as desperate as he was to get his hands on him and to beat the living daylights out of each other.
The rumbling ceased, so suddenly it startled Harry. He looked around, but the stillness lasted just a split second. The water around Malfoy exploded, launching him into the air. But he wasn't alone. Bodies, hundreds of writhing, flapping flailing limbs and tails were pushing Malfoy up, a cascade of water streaming down them. Harry was frozen in terror- they looked like… but how? Harry saw arms and heads, but no legs. Instead the bodies had tails. They were mer-people. But not the mer-people like Harry had seen in the lake before. These were skeletal, hollow eyed, rotting bodies. These were Inferi.
“Hagrid told me there’s been mer-people going missing after the giant squid died, and he didn’t know what was causing it. I didn’t think much of it until… I saw you, down at the lake one night.” Harry said, watching Malfoy’s expression change to one of horror.
“Well...with good behaviour and regular counselling there’s a possibility it will be shorter than what they’ve agreed on.” Draco looked at her, seriously.
“Huh. Weird. And this was after curfew?”
Eventually Malfoy straightened, snatching his cloak, trousers and shoes up, and strode back towards the castle. Harry watched his progress, shifting to see him for as long as possible before he disappeared from view, leaving Harry staring at the place he vanished from. Harry closed his eyes and rolled his back onto the wall beside the window, and groaned, letting his head drop against the brick wall behind him. This wasn’t good. Whatever he was doing, Harry knew it was definitely not something he could just forget about. He wasn't doing anything suspicious per say, Malfoy wasn't hurting anyone by going into the freezing lake late at night. And seeing as he got out, Harry supposed he wasn’t trying to intentionally hurt himself… was he? The idea of Malfoy intentionally putting himself in harm's way didn't sit well with Harry. The Malfoy he knew was cowardly, always putting himself first, never risking his own neck. But this was a different Malfoy. This Malfoy didn't care about anything, maybe not even his own life anymore.
How the hell had he got in here? Harry looked around quickly, to see Kreacher reappear in the archway leading out to the kitchen. He had a vacant smile on his face. Harry cursed inwardly at the elf. Of course Kreacher would have let Malfoy in. He was a member of the ancient House of Black. Harry couldn’t believe he hadn’t warned Kreacher not to let anybody in while he was away. He'd left in such a hurry, this was his fault. Harry couldn't tell if Malfoy had cast 'imperio' the elf or if he was just that old and thick that he didn’t realise Malfoy was an enemy.
“You probably want to keep a low profile, and being Head Boy of Hogwarts isn’t exactly ideal for such endeavours.”
“You do. I heard you telling Longbottom about it in the Library the other day.” Harry’s mind flashed back to that memory of seeing Draco in the library, the feathered quill brushing along his pink lip, their momentary eye contact, and Malfoy getting up to leave, then telling Neville about the wand. Harry cursed himself for not being more careful, for not checking for any prying eyes or ears. He tightened his grip on his own wand, still concealed in his pocket, his body only half facing Malfoy in the doorway. Harry's chest heaved with a deep breath, and he saw Draco’s eyes flicker over it momentarily before returning his gaze to his eyes.
“Draco, it's not certain yet, there are things involved,”
Malfoy followed Harry through the doors of the bathroom and his eyes widened. He took a breath and looked around the room, taking in the hundreds of taps, and the stained glass windows surrounding the ginormous pool-sized bath.
Regards,
“Hagrid, The lake - it's Inferi.” Hagrid stopped in front of the two boys, and his eyes widened, looking first at Harry, and then down to where Malfoy was laid on the grass. Hagrid gripped his fists, but after a moment Harry saw that he too could feel the vibrations under his feet.
“Oh good. You’re still alive.” Harry said, and untied the paper from the bird’s leg. He pressed the towel into his crotch some more, dabbing at the dark stains that looked more than a tad incriminating.
Dear Mister Potter,
“What is that?” Malfoy said sharply. Burt before Harry could answer, he heard a familiar voice shouting his name from across the grounds. Hagrid was lumbering towards him.
“Yea, ok Hagrid. I’ll see you later!”
“I have it.” Harry said.
The door swung inwards, and a slightly stern but familiar voice ordered,
A whisper escaped Draco's mouth, pushing past Harry's lips, and the light around them disappeared. The heat, the static and the sensation vanished, and Harry felt himself fall, losing contact with Draco, before hitting something cold, and he sank, he couldn't breathe again.
“I’m warning you Malfoy. Tell me what you’re up to or I swear-”
“We need to split up!” shouted Harry, seeing the Inferi closing in. Malfoy needed to draw them away.
The now familiar sound of marble on marble indicated someone was entering the common room, and Harry glanced over his shoulder automatically, before a cold chill froze him on the spot.
“I'd love some.”
“How do you…”
Malfoy laughing eased into a grin, and then into a tired seriousness, and he breathed heavily, looking at Harry. His eyes scanned his face, and came to rest on Harry's bloodied lips. As Harry also caught his breath back, he suddenly felt very aware of Draco's entire body pressed up against his. He could feel the others body heat radiating into him, bony hips pressing against his own, creating an odd twisted sensation in the pit of his stomach.
“Indeed, Headmistress.”
The view from his bedroom window was breathtaking. He could see all the way down into the grounds. There was Hagrid's Hut, sat squat on the lawn, oozing blueish woodsmoke from the chimney, and the Great Lake lay glimmering before him in the afternoon light. He could see along the whole eastern shore of it, the tiny waves crashing into the border of pebbles that surrounded the vast body of water. He imagined himself late at night, watching through his window from his bed as the giant squid came up for air in the moonlight, but then remembered dejectedly about what Hagrid had told him earlier that day about it having been killed after the battle. He scanned the shore of the Lake to see if anything had been washed up like Hagrid had mentioned, but saw nothing but thousands of pebbles and boulders, and the occasional splash of water on the rocks. He turned away from the window and looked happily into his cosy room. He flopped onto the bed and breathed in the smell of the fresh, yet slightly musty sheets. He was home, at last.
“Anyway, Harry, shouldn't you focus on your studies instead of rekindling an old obsession over Draco Malfoy?” she raised an eyebrow at him and he felt the flush rise from his neck up his face.
“Neville. Neville should be Head Boy. He... he really does deserve it.”
“Yea, Christmas.” With a final wave goodbye, Harry watched as Ron turned on the spot, and disappeared from sight with an ear-splitting CRACK. The empty space where he stood was dark, glimmering with moonlight and traces of magic.
“It’s… something to do with the lake, isn’t it?”
Malfoy's eyes connected with Harry’s. Harry wasn’t satisfied with that answer.
“Bloody hell Harry, what are you doing up? I thought I heard someone out here. lower your wand, would you?” Seamus said in a whisper. Harry straightened up immediately and did as Seamus asked, feeling flustered and embarrassed. Had Seamus seen him trying to eavesdrop on Malfoy? Seamus blinked a couple of times, giving Harry a curious look before asking,
Not a single movement. Not a single sound. Not a flicker of a shadow or a distant echo to indicate there had ever been anything more than complete stillness here. Nothing to suggest this had once held a family, however unhappy it was.
“The swimming, it must be part of some sort of ritual you need to do, some sort of magic bond-“
“You’re ability to squeeze yourself into everyone’s affairs is utterly unbearable Potter, it is none of your fucking business what may or may not be going on.”
“I won it from you, fair and square. It answers to me now, It’s mine.” Harry insisted, trying to sound authoritative. That’s what Neville had said after all, it was his now. Malfoy ran his tongue across his lips.
“I have some dittany in my trunk, that sorted out Seamus last time. Well, it didn't get rid of it straight away, but it stopped the orange glow at least.” Harry paused for a second, considering the boy beneath him, wondering if he was about to make a huge mistake.
“Where is it? Tell me!” Malfoy hissed, leaning even closer to Harry's face, and Harry knew this was his chance. With a quick snap of his head, Harry’s skull collided painfully with Malfoy’s, making the other cry out and lean back, the pressure of the dagger suddenly vanishing. Harry lifted his arms free and wrapped them around Draco’s waist, swiftly rolling him over so Harry was the one on top. He grabbed Draco’s wrists as they landed and pinned them to the sides of his head on the mattress, thumbs digging into the soft spots, forcing Draco to release his grip on the weapon.
“Don’t want to be late for your next class too, do you, Harry?” Slughorn's booming voice cut through his musings and Harry snapped back to the present. He realised he was the only one left in the dungeon.
Malfoy blinked and looked up at him, jaw tightening, evidently restless of this weird interaction, and quickly pulled his wrist from Harry's grip, clutching it to his chest defensively, looking away from Harry. Harry waited, but Malfoy said nothing. He sighed and turned back into his room, rolling his eyes when he knew he was out of Malfoy’s line of sight.
“Come in, Potter.”
“Harry?”
“I promise.”
Harry sat there for a moment, and took in what Malfoy had just said. It had worked.
McGonagall shot at both of them, and Harry tore his gaze from Malfoy to look at her. He’d normally feel guilty for breaking the rules but today there was a fire raging inside him, so he didn't care. He looked at McGonagall seriously, as if trying to silently communicate to her that Malfoy had deserved it, the git.
“Well please, don’t keep me in the dark. Bloody well explain what I just saw.”
“Wh- Sorry?”
“Uh..” Harry said stupidly, before he saw Malfoy push past the elf into the hallway. Harry chased after him.
Harry nodded. Uncertainty lingered slightly in his mind but he knew this was the only way he was going to find out what Malfoy was doing, and to put a stop to it if he needed to.
“A weeks detention, both of you, and I swear, if I see you two so much as look at each other again, I will send you home, immediately. Do you understand me?”
The burning corpses of the defeated Inferi had started to wash ashore, and Harry looked at them. Harry noticed a long object floating among them. It was Malfoy's wand, he must have dropped it when he passed out. Harry picked it up, feeling the magic closed within him with the magic of his own wand. He had an idea.
The realisation hit him like a brick wall. The misery inside him hardened into fear. There really was no other way now. He could finally end all of this once and for all. And now with his mother in Azkaban, there was no other option, no one to turn to and ask for help.
“Malfoy! Catch!” Harry yelled, while picking off the Inferi surrounding him. Malfoy, looking terrified, stared at Harry, and as Harry launched the wand at him, he caught it, looking extremely confused and scared.
“We’ve always been in each other's pain, don’t you think?” Malfoy rolled his eyes and slapped Harry’s hand away, a small smile escaping his lips. Harry grinned.
“Well, maybe I could use your ‘elp. I’m flummoxed, really, I got no clue what’s causin’ the disappearances. At first I thought it migh’ be the grindylows, autumn is matin’ season like, so they do act up a bit, but they've not hurt the mer-people before. So then I thought it might be something to do with these new creatures I was introducin’…” Hagrid explained to them all his theories, but as Hagrid's explanations got vaguer and vaguer, Harry started to think Hagrid really didn’t have a clue. He strongly doubted things like “Separation withdrawal from the Giant Squid” was causing mermaids to go missing. Harry looked at Ron, and he raised an eyebrow in response. “All I know is, once the Giant Squid died, the mermaids started disappearin’. That’s the only thing I know for sure.”
“You promise me that you’re not putting anyone’s lives at risk, and that you aren’t being pressured or blackmailed by anyone like last time?” Harry asked. Malfoy rolled his eyes, but remained collected. He considered Harry for a moment, and then replied.
