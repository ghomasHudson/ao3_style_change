Harry laughed again and wriggled out of Draco's clasp. He kneeled next to the fireplace and checked the wards connected to the Floo. It was Ginny, requesting permission to enter the house. Harry groaned but lowered the wards nonetheless. He wanted to wait with the confrontation till tomorrow but in the end, now was as good a time as any.
Harry and Draco stepped back to the library of Grimmauld Place, exhausted after the rather unpleasant dinner affair. Harry dragged Draco over to the sofa in front of the fireplace and pushed him down on it rather forcefully. He scrambled on top of Draco and buried his face in his chest.
"Purebloods," Harry rolled his eyes dramatically and sent a few diagnostic charms over the door and the handle, as he'd done with the back door. Just like before, the door was void of any curses and hexes. Harry spelled the spiderwebs away and reached for the handle. The door was stiff with rust and he had to bump his shoulder against the wood to get it to open. The hinges creaked ominously in the darkness, revealing two steps leading down, into the pitch-black cellar. The sound sent shivers up Harry's spine, and cold sweat ran down his temple. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw a movement to his right. He pivoted sharply on his heels, his eyes searching the darkness frantically, wand at the ready. There was nothing there. Then again, just as he started turning back toward the cellar door, he thought he saw a movement in the back foyer but when he trained his eyes on the spot, it was gone again. He realized he was breathing hard. He wiped his sweaty palms on his robes and looked back to the gaping dark hole in front of him.
Harry thought he could hear a loud bang and footsteps upstairs and it made him look around the room. Why couldn't he find anything? Standing there, he realized the sweat that had broken on his back was starting to cool down rapidly. The room was getting chillier all of a sudden as if there was a draft of freezing air coming from the walls. The atmosphere inside the house changed. The hairs on Harry's arms stood up and a shiver ran down his spine. His time was up.
"Alright, we're on a tight schedule here. Pansy, you go to the library, as usual. Try both wizarding and Muggle libraries this time. Find out the full history of Mr. Gladstone's Bed & Breakfast since the day it has been built. Mark anything suspicious for us. Disappearances. Suspicious deaths. Murders. Potter, you and I have some more studying to do, we only have today afternoon and tomorrow morning for you to memorize all the rules and equipment. Plus, we still have to cover the ghost types. Tuesday afternoon's for our rapier practice," Draco couldn't help but smirk at Potter's excited nodding. His eyes were huge in a way that Draco tried not to find endearing but failed spectacularly.
Harry suddenly turned serious. "Draco, before we… I need to ask you something." He picked at the hem of the shirt Draco was wearing. "Why did you come back? You didn't come just because you felt as if you had to, right? Just because your mum kept nagging at you that you should try to get back with me?"
To Draco's surprise, Potter giggled. Draco wasn't sure how to react to that and decided to continue his lecture instead. "Anyway, then there's rapiers, silver-tipped. We use them to fend the ghosts off."
"Don't be ridiculous, Potter," Draco bristled. "Why the fuck would I be jealous? I'm just astonished there are still some gay wizards left in England you haven't fucked yet."
„Well, if you change your mind,“ Blaise trailed off. „Meanwhile, I and my new best friend Weasley are going to locate some drinks. What do you say, Ronnie-kins?“ Blaise wrapped an arm around Ron‘s shoulders and started dragging him towards the liquor cabinet he‘d immediately spotted on the other side of the library.
"No, that point is not negotiable," Harry glared angrily at the Head Auror. He was standing in Robards's office, Minister Shacklebolt the only other person present for their private meeting.
„I asked you what you were planning to do to Malfoy this time,“ Ron gave him a wary look. „You‘ve been staring at him for the past twenty minutes at least. Even Slughorn noticed you weren‘t paying any attention to your potion and that‘s saying something.“
"Please, go to Diagon Alley and buy two hundred red roses. And Belgian chocolate, the one Draco likes the most. And be back in ten minutes," Harry poured the instructions out.
„You know I am right. Granger will give you a stern lecturing, the Weasel is probably going to throw a fit and possibly even stop talking to you for a while and the Weaslette will hex my bits off. I don‘t want to put you in a position where you might have to choose between me and your friends. Imagine the articles in the Daily Prophet. HARRY POTTER UNDER THE IMPERIUS CURSE?. THE SAVIOUR CONSORTING WITH A KNOWN DEATH EATER! I would love nothing more than to stop hiding from the world but I am scared of the outcome.“ It was a relief to get it off his chest. Draco traced his fingers over Harry‘s spine in an absent-minded gesture. Harry shivered under his touch.
"We broke up," Harry shrugged. He couldn't care less about another failed fling. Harry was starting to realize that no one but Draco would ever be good enough for him. "Why are you asking? Are you jealous?" Please be jealous, please be jealous, Harry thought to himself.
"That's it? I've been gone for two months and you just Potter me?" Harry crossed his arms. He was not able to keep the hurt entirely from his voice.
"Where does it hurt, love?“ Harry‘s heart was pounding in his throat. What had happened? What had he done? This was all his fault. If he hadn‘t been such a moron, he would have listened to Draco when he‘d said he wasn‘t feeling well.
"Are you coming to the Leaky tonight? I know Ron is planning a surprise Welcome-Back Party. I'm not supposed to know but…," Potter hesitated. "You are coming, right?"
Harry felt oddly hurt by Malfoy's words. The tone with which he said it sounded too much like when they were back at Hogwarts, sniping at each other, hating each other, trying to rile each other up. It was not a direction he wanted their newly-found, brittle partnership to go. He had to make Draco believe him. Why would Harry be the only person that could hear the ghosts' voices? What made him different from everyone else? Harry sucked in a sharp breath as a bone-chilling thought crossed his mind.
"How's my favourite Ferret doing?" Ron pinched Draco's cheek, reminding him of Mrs. Weasley. His voice was but a hoarse rasp and he was completely sloshed.
"I don't want your pity fuck! Or are you that desperate to get laid tonight? Don't let me keep you from it then," Draco snatched his hand away as if burned.
"As observant as ever, I see," Malfoy was leaning against the door frame of his office, looking rather smug.
It was getting dark when they finished their tea. They'd been sitting in a melancholic silence at first but then Draco clapped his hands and startled Harry out of his thoughts.
„Well, it‘s just… look at the way he eats, Hermione. All posh and proper! And why is he eating treacle tart? He doesn‘t even like it! Look at the way he holds the fork between his fingers, it looks so elegant,“ Harry ranted.
"Come on, Malfoy, don't tell me you're afraid of tentacles," Potter poked him in the ribs with his index finger.
"You're going to be the death of me Harry," Draco's hips bucked violently on their own volition, his whole body spasming with pleasure.
Draco replied by thrusting his tongue inside Harry‘s opening and was rewarded by the sexiest moan he‘d ever heard Harry utter. He doubled his efforts, pinning Harry against the sofa with his arms, effectively stilling any movement. Harry was meowling, there was no other word for it, and Draco's cock jumped appreciatively. Harry's whole body was shuddering and spasming with want.
"You went first the last time," Draco said lightly, even though his heart was pounding in his chest rapidly. "It's my turn now. Can't have you steal all the glory, can I?"
At that moment, the house-elves carried in a large tray with a whole cooked monkfish placed on top of a bed of fresh rocket. Harry gulped and stared into the dead eyes of the fish. The sight made him sick and he wanted to stab the eyes out with his fork.
Draco fired another Stupefy at the wizard and saw him go down. Shouts echoed from the direction of the Vaults entrance.
It was Draco's time to gape at her. "I don't hate you. I haven't hated you for a long time. I can't take him with me because it's too dangerous. Believe what you will but I don't want him getting hurt. I don't want anyone getting hurt ever again," Draco sounded frustrated even to himself. "Potter is like that mad Bludger that kept chasing him around the Quidditch pitch in the second year. He's unpredictable and reckless. I can't take him with me because I know he wouldn't listen to me. Hunting ghosts isn't fun, it's not glorious. I will not watch him die just because he's too stubborn to gulp down his pride and follow my lead."
"The asylum. Two Aurors died there over a week ago. Harry tried to save them but he wasn't able to," Granger shook her head. "He was devastated after it happened. He wouldn't go back there, would he?" she looked pleadingly at him.
A gentle hand landed on his shoulder. Harry didn't stop crawling until Tracey kneeled in front of him and their eyes meet. Tracey shook her head resignedly and a tear streaked down her cheek. Harry could see the truth reflected in her eyes. He'd been too late. McLaggen and Montague died because Harry hadn't reached them on time. Harry let Tracey wrap him in her arms. He let her stroke his back in comforting circles. She was warm. Harry could feel his body starting to shake uncontrollably but his mind was numb.
Harry left Draco‘s boxers on and instead tucked him in. He kissed Draco‘s forehead, nose, eyelids, and lip. He removed his own clothes, leaving only his pants on. He propped himself against the headboard. Ever so softly he lifted Draco‘s head and placed it in his lap. Draco looked at him questioningly, quirking an eyebrow.
Pansy could feel it now that Draco brought her attention to it. Tendrils of rage were sneaking all around them, nudging at their skin as if tasting it. Pansy shivered involuntarily. If Potter survived the night, Pansy was going to kill him herself for making her come here. What had Potter done to make the house feel like this?
„Draco blocked me out of his Floo and I need to see if he‘s alright,“ Harry pulled at his hair desperately.
„Harry, I‘m going to come,“ Draco wailed and came all over Harry‘s desk, gripping it so tightly his knuckles turned white.
„Well, I‘ve noticed you‘ve not been yourself in the past week. Maybe I could help you relieve that stress somehow,“ she trailed her finger suggestively across her lips.
"Draco doesn't have a fucking hour," Harry pulled at his hair angrily. "I'm going back to the door."
"Do a quick search anyway," Robards's order sounded breathy in Harry's ear. "Alpha, take the first floor. Niffler on the ground floor. Phoenix, you have the cellar."
Guilt coiled in his stomach. He wasn't able to look Hermione in the eyes as he said it and was thankful for having the conversation over Floo. He wouldn't have been able to pull off lying to her like this in person. "I have to go now, I'm going to take a nap so that I'm rested for the evening."
„Good for you mate, but why couldn‘t have been anyone else?“ Ron crossed his arms stubbornly, having finished his morning snack.
"We're in a bit of a tough spot here. One, there's at least a dozen of Spectres," Draco started counting on his fingers. The flashlight was back in his hand and the movement was making the darkening shadows around them jump. "Two, based on the darkness gathering around us, I suspect a Dark Spectre is at play in here as well. Three, Potter's hair is even more atrocious than usual and it hurts my eyes to look at him. Four, quite possibly there's a Poltergeist as we're locked in."
„Oh yeah, what for Potter?“ Draco choked out. He was getting close and tried his best to last longer.
"It could mean the ghost is tied to this place somehow but it's not the manifestation point," Draco answered after giving it a thought. "Or the insulation on the window is not done properly and the owner turned off the heating because she doesn't use the room anymore," he grinned.
Harry almost automatically walked over to Draco. In the last moment, he startled and realized he was invisible and that Draco was in fact talking to the picture frame. He watched Draco smile fondly at the Harry in the picture.
Draco heaved a sigh and cupped Harry's face in both of his hands. "I came because for the past three days I felt dead inside. At first, I thought it was normal for people who'd lost their memories. It actually took Pansy to tell me I was being an idiot and that I should go see you. Then you kissed me and I realized nothing could ever change the way I felt about you. At least, not such a minor inconvenience as an Obliviate spell, anyway," Draco snickered. "Besides, how do you know what my mother said?"
The atmosphere around them changed rapidly. What had felt peaceful only seconds ago, was now a torrent of rage around them. Draco heard the shutters in all directions slamming shut, glass shattering on the floor. A loud wail echoed from the dark depths of the corridor behind them. Draco didn't hesitate. He started running back the way they came, dragging Pansy with him. As he cleared the landing of the staircase and looked down from a small balcony overlooking the foyer, he swore loudly. At least three Spectres were floating at the base of the stairs, blocking his way to the front door. Draco could see their faces, forever twisted in agony, as if they'd died in horrible pain. Draco turned around and noticed another apparition closing in on them from the corridor they'd ran out of just now.
"Two," Draco loosened the snap fastener and pointed the container, filled with a mixture of iron, magnesium, and salt, toward the centre of the room.
"The famous Harry Potter at my doorstep. Don't think that's going to make me pay you more than we agreed on," the woman narrowed her eyes at Harry. Her gaze wandered up and down over him as if she tried to determine if Harry was the real deal.
„Draco, sweetheart, can you hear me?“ Harry whispered. Draco looked so vulnerable like this. Paler than usual, even unconscious his body was folded as if in constant pain. „Please say something, tell me what‘s wrong.“
Once Hermione discovered the effect of introducing adrenaline into the cardiovascular system within ten minutes of being ghost-touched, she immediately tested it on Patient X and removed the stasis. However, it appeared that the charm had interfered with the circulation of the adrenaline in the bloodstream. They'd nearly lost the patient that night and Hermione was forced to put them back into the coma. She'd almost been fired for using Muggle medicine on a wizard without proper authorization from the Board of Healers. She knew the next experimental cure had to be the right one, otherwise, the patient would die. She knew that discovering new cures required sacrifices but the death of a human being was not a price she was willing to pay.
"Tortured," Harry repeated, steeling himself. "Not that many people knew about us. It hasn't even hit the Daily Prophet yet."
"Accio lube," Potter choked out. Draco knew Potter could do wandless magic but this was the best use of it he'd seen so far.
"Oh, I'm so not done with you," Harry laughed. "Let me just take care of a little problem I have. I have to come now otherwise I won't last a second inside you."
Harry‘s eyes widened. He flinched as if Draco had slapped him across the face. He started backing away from the bed, towards the door. „I‘m so sorry, Draco,“ he was shaking his heard, his voice barely a whisper. He suddenly turned around, threw the door open, and bolted out of the room.
Harry beamed at him that beautiful smile that lit up his whole face and made Draco's heart clench with love as he slid onto Draco's lap.
"I am still amazed at how many Type Twos there were inside that house. Something horrible must have happened there," Draco frowned. He'd never encountered a haunted place as gruesome as the one Potter had foolishly braved on his own.
They stayed like that until their breathing quieted, their heartbeat slowed down and the sweat dried on their skin. Finally, Draco moved and let his softened prick fall out of Harry‘s hole.
Harry stared after her, not daring to get his hopes up. He knew Hermione most possibly forgot to eat at work. He decided to make her tea and pulled a plate of sandwiches he'd prepared earlier that day out of the cooling cupboard. He arranged the cups of tea, the sandwiches, and a plate of cookies on a tray and carried it to the library. Meanwhile, Hermione had spread out several tomes on the coffee table before her. She kept consulting the index pages and flipping through several books seemingly at once. Harry knew better than to ask her any questions right then. Instead, he started slowly nibbling on a cookie. He wasn't hungry but at least it kept him busy while he waited for Hermione to tell him what was going on.
"I'll tell you in the morning," Harry's voice shook and he hated himself for it. He didn't want to worry Hermione, with the birth term still two months away. "Please go back to sleep."
"I think you're right. He seems determined to find a solution to the Problem," Hermione said. "If we combine all of our knowledge, it might set us up on the right path to achieve just that."
"I don't think you've lost him, Harry. I think he needs to come to terms with losing his memory. He'll want to get in touch with you when he feels a bit more stable and then you'll woo him all over again. Anyway, I guess we all need to learn to talk more to each other about the difficult things, don't we?" Hermione smiled sadly. "It's a pity it always takes awful things to happen for people to learn from them, isn't it?"
"Now I'll hate myself forever for believing anything my father has ever told me. I hate myself for acting the way I did. I want out Harry," Malfoy's voice is broken and pleading. It tugs at Harry's heart in a way he never thought possible.
"There is one I know of," Potter grinned and sat down on the corner of Draco's desk. His crotch was in Draco's direct eye line. It was not fair Potter unconsciously flaunted himself in front of Draco in any possible situation. Draco quickly glanced at the fabric hiding Potter's cock, wondering what it looked like. How big was it? And did Potter shave there? Draco gulped and tore his gaze away. He stared at the report lying on the desk in front of him instead.
"Oh, really? I think you'll know precisely when I'm flirting with you," Draco whispered seductively. A moment later, he pulled away with a shit-eating grin. "Now, you oaf, stop dawdling and get to work."
"I…" Draco trailed off. He thought about it. What was he going to do? Run away and pretend this never happened or stay and hope it would happen again? Repeatedly.
Potter seemed at a loss for words, stuck between surprise and awe. His chest heaved up and down quickly before he murmured a soft OK.
"We've already contacted the goblin liaison, they'll be here any minute," Robards stated. "Auror Potter, back with me to the base. Nott, Smith, stay here and keep working on that door."
Harry felt bad for lying to his best friend but he felt guilty for storming out and not trying to convince Malfoy harder. A pang of uncertainty ran through his veins as he remembered Malfoy's warning not to go out alone. He pushed the thought away, he wouldn't disappoint Hermione. Her research of the Problem was important and Harry knew it would save countless lives in the future. He was going to do anything in his power to prevent what had happened to Ron from happening to other people.
Harry leaned in, licked Draco's earlobe affectionately, and whispered. "I haven't placed the Tracking Spell on you yet, you prat!"
At that moment, the door in question swung open wildly and hit the wall with a loud bang. A very disgruntled-looking Draco Malfoy, breathing hard, stood in the doorway, his gaze flickering madly between Harry and Robards.
"Potter?" Draco called out. He cuffed Pansy lightly on the back of her head for a good measure and peered over the banister.
„I mean it, Harry, don‘t talk right now,“ Draco shushed him and kissed him bruisingly. Draco knew Harry well and was sure that if he tried to explain his feelings to Harry at this very moment, Harry would hear only half of it and that half would get twisted somewhere on the way to his brain, causing Harry to completely misinterpret Draco‘s words. He had to calm Harry down and he knew how to do just that.
Draco fights will all the strength he can muster. Punches and kicks litter the werewolf's upper body. Greyback only laughs, seemingly unaffected by the desperate blows that land on his arms and chest. He rips the pants off of Draco and pulls him closer across the surface of the table. He pins Draco against the table with one arm and pulls a vial out of the pocket of his trousers. He unbuckles his belt and lets his trousers fall to the floor. His cock is huge and rock-hard, eager. He pours a few drops of oil onto it, then throws the bottle in the corner where it spills its contents.
"I'll be here for you, I promise. No matter what happens, we'll get through this together," Harry smoothed a strand of stray hair from her face and hugged her awkwardly over her baby bump. Hermione rested her forehead on his shoulder, settling into the embrace.
Harry was walking through the corridor leading to his office. He was nervous, just like he'd been nervous for the past two weeks, ever since he decided he would ask Draco on a date. Harry fancied Draco for at least three years now, nearly as long as they were partners. Ron would tell him that was bollocks, that Harry had had a crush on Malfoy since the sixth year. Harry thought that was just plain absurd. Harry wiped his sweaty palm on his robes and turned the knob. Draco was sitting behind his desk, perfect and immaculate as ever.
Draco cleared his throat. "You can sit in on this one, if you want, Potter. Leave the questioning to me, I don't want you to spook our client more than he already is."
Draco smiled at him, inwardly pleased with himself. He knew he would win once he got Harry out of his clothes.
"Draco?" Harry could only gape at him. "It's OK, sweetheart, we can go home now," Harry pleaded, his breath caught in his chest. He knew something was very wrong but his brain couldn't process what was happening.
"Mmm," was all Draco could say, with his mouth full of that delicious hard length and doubled his efforts.
"Draco, please tell me this is one of your stupid jokes. Please tell me that you remember me… that you remember us," Harry whimpered.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the salt bombs hitting their target - the cluster of ghosts that had followed Potter, presumably up from the cellar. Draco had never seen that many ghosts in one place. The Spectres disappeared in a blast of salt.
"Is that what you would have wanted for her? Living with someone who would never love her that way? I'm gay for fuck's sake! I couldn't even get my dick up for her most of the time," Harry barked out. He tasted blood in his mouth, the coppery tang of it felt oddly soothing as he swallowed it and he welcomed the sting of his broken lip.
They were interrupted by a commotion from the podium. Luna was standing there in her loose, white dress, motioning Theo over. He seemed to be reluctant to join her up there.
„Hey, mate, whatever shit‘s happening to you, I‘m sorry, OK? But don‘t take it out on me,“ Ron raised his hands defensively.
„Shhhh, let me take care of you. Let me worship you, and once you come in my mouth or on my face or wherever you want to, we will talk, OK?“ Draco whispered against Harry‘s skin, relishing in the goosebumps his tongue and words had caused. He bit Harry‘s neck where it met the shoulder and held the skin and flesh in his teeth. It always worked on Harry. Draco felt him relax and melt into the mattress as if he was boneless.
Again, Harry could not hear what the hooded figure said. He tried to get closer but stepped on a plastic cup. It crunched under his shoe. Harry cursed inwardly and stilled. Draco whipped around and narrowed his eyes, examining the alley behind him warily. When he couldn‘t find anything out of the ordinary, he turned back to the figure and nodded. The hooded person grabbed Draco‘s arm and Disapparated.
"That wasn't flirting, Scarhead. I was just trying to make you laugh. Successfully, may I add," Draco smiled smugly.
"No, I don't want to talk," Ron said and swung his fist at Harry. Harry saw it coming. He had enough time to move out of the trajectory of Ron's blow but he let it collide with his jaw anyway. He needed to feel that kind of pain, the sharp sting of broken skin, the dull ache of a bruised jaw. Anything to distract him from the pain that was slowly eating him alive from the inside out. The pain of Draco's beautiful face staring at him as if he was Potter again, not the Harry he'd come to love. He relished the way Ron's knuckles bruised his skin, the way the impact rattled his frame.
Harry smiled to himself, the memory of that day warming his heart. Of course, Draco loved him, Harry mused. What was he doing here, sneaking around his office, treating Draco as if he was a petty criminal? Harry knew he had many issues he still needed to work on after the war. He shouldn‘t invent new ones just to hide from the ones he already had. If Draco found out Harry was snooping around his office, it would certainly put a wedge between them.
Harry lowers himself carefully next to Draco and wraps his arms tightly around him. Draco curls into his embrace and cries. They stay like that for what feels like hours.
„I really do love you,“ Harry pulled back. „I have to ask you something,“ Harry said and suddenly turned serious. Looking Draco in the eyes, Harry exhaled slowly, trying to gather his courage to go on with his carefully prepared speech.
Malfoy stood there, gaping at Harry as if unsure he was mentally stable. "You're touching me," he said. The tone of his voice wasn't angry or derisive, merely surprised.
Draco had to admit, Potter-ready-for-action was one of the sexiest things he'd ever seen. Right after Potter-in-action and Potter-in-the-shower. Yes, Draco did see Potter in the shower once, completely accidentally of course. Even more accidentally, he let his gaze roam over Potter's naked body, slick with water and soap suds, for much longer than was polite.
Harry replied with a mysterious smile and dragged him through the bodies swaying on the dance floor. They stopped right under the podium.
"As I said in my letter, Potter is in danger," Draco began. His father would have been appalled with his bluntness but Draco had no time to spare. Granger had sent several Patronuses to Potter, telling him she knew he was going out on his own and pleading him to come back. Potter responded only once, saying he knew what he was doing, not to worry, and that he sure as hell didn't need a sodding Malfoy helping him out. Potter, the stubborn prat he was, stopped responding after that and Draco swore to himself he would punch the git when he found him for making Granger beside herself with worry. Not that Draco harboured any particular love for Granger but in the short time they'd spent together he found out how much she'd been through and how much the baby she was carrying meant to her. He knew too much stress meant she could lose the baby. At one point, while waiting for a reply from Tracey, and to Draco's utter horror, he voluntarily pulled Granger against his chest and rubbed his hand in soothing circles across her back to calm her down. He was surprised when he found out it helped her and even more surprised that he wasn't repulsed by the act itself.
"You're such a sap," Draco replied and couldn't help but let his voice mirror the fondness he was feeling at that moment. "I will never admit to saying this but… I enjoy it too."
"How's boyfriend number seventy-three?" Draco snarled with contempt the moment Potter stepped through the door to their office.
„Then you must know, deep down, that‘s how Draco feels about you. Trust me, Harry. He might make you pay for whatever you did but he loves you dearly,“ Narcissa‘s voice was tinged with a smile.
"Well, this is quite a delicate matter. It's about what I told you on Friday," Ginny widened her eyes slightly and tried to motion Harry toward the kitchen.
Harry nearly choked on the asparagus and scowled at his boss as soon as he was able to breathe. "That is not a standard questioning procedure for victims of a crime."
Potter obeyed without question. It didn't escape Draco's lust-addled brain that this was the first time Potter did as instructed without arguing. Draco filed that information for later.
"Stop, Harry," Hermione interrupted him abruptly. "I meant what I said. I want you to be happy. And if giving it a shot with Draco is what it takes for you to be happy, go for it."
"Nice try, Harry," Tracey snickered. "According to the proper etiquette, men are supposed to walk down the stairs first, in case the lady stumbles and falls."
"Harry, I… I don't want to be your consolation prize," Draco whispered. "I'm sorry, I can't. It would break my heart."
"Where are my things?" Harry asked suddenly. "And why is there a picture of… I don't even know what that is on my desk?"
Pansy could see Draco was furious when he Apparated back into the Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. office. The expression on his face told her everything she needed to know. She immediately jumped out of her chair, where she had been painting her nails, Muggle style. Draco insisted they never wore any charmed or spelled objects when out on a case, including any cosmetic procedures. The first time Pansy painted her nails with a Muggle varnish had been a disaster. Now, her manicure was bottled perfection.
"Don't be ridiculous, Potter," Draco scoffed. "Why the fuck would I be jealous? I'm just astonished there are still some gay wizards left in England you haven't fucked yet."
"Alright, Mr. Harry Action Potter, this brings me to my second point. I need you to verify my theory about the Sources. I already contacted a ghost-hunting agency here in London, they are supposed to be the best in the country. I already made an appointment for you. Tomorrow morning, 9 AM. Here's the address," she handed him a piece of parchment with street name and number scribbled on it.
"Draco, please, please, breathe," Harry's eyes were welling with tears, his voice breaking into a desperate whisper.
Cold dread seemed to freeze Harry for a second. He could not move, he could not breathe. Then his Auror training kicked in and he ran to Draco and quickly used a cleaning charm on him. He tentatively ran his fingers through Draco‘s fringe which was plastered to his face with sweat.
"I'm sorry Ron, I'm really sorry about Ginny," Harry whispered hoarsely. "But I couldn't have stayed with her. It wouldn't have been right. I couldn't keep lying to her and to myself. I just wish she understood that. I've never wanted to hurt her, I promise."
"It's always you two," Robards shook his head tiredly. "You're going to drive me to the Janus Thickey ward. I think a week there would seem like a holiday compared to what I have to go through with you." He sat down and closed his eyes. He groaned loudly. "You're dismissed. And send Goldstein in, will you?"
"Good, let's head to the Apparition point, we'll Side-Along from there. And Harry?" Robards stopped him wearily.
"None of that, Harry," Draco lifted his chin gently. "I wanted it just as much as you. This is not your fault, the blame goes to the person who decided to Crucio me. Not you."
Draco turned around and squeezed inside through the narrow opening. The door slammed shut behind him, trapping him in the small Entrance Hall. Draco immediately threw himself on the ground, his Auror training taking over his body. A curse chipped a piece of stone off the wall behind him. Draco rolled and pointed his wand in the direction from where the curse came. He rolled again and another curse narrowly missed him.
Pansy shifted behind him and Draco moved to the other side of the corridor, checking the opposite door as well. It was only when he moved to the second door on his left, that the temperature dropped to five degrees. The door was closed but Draco could feel the cold seeping into the corridor from under the door.
"Oh, darling," she whispered sadly and ran her hand across his back soothingly. "Grimmauld Place. He lives in Grimmauld Place."
„Ron and I have a bet that I won‘t look at you or talk about you for the whole day. I'm not allowed to even mention you,“ Harry chuckled. „So far I‘m winning and of course, he will never find out that I cheated, will he?“
"As I said before, we're both idiots. Now, you have years of sex to catch up on and you have to figure out if you prefer topping or bottoming. Are you up for it?" Potter quirked an eyebrow at Draco wickedly. The gesture was rather Malfoyish in nature.
"Screw you," Harry spat and started running up the stairs to the first floor, taking them by two. He frantically searched around him, looking for any signs of ghosts or Alpha nearby. He stopped when he reached the top of the stairs. There was a dark corridor, leading to his right. There were at least four doors on each side, some of them open, some closed. Harry could barely see down the far side of the corridor. Spiderwebs were strewn all across the ceiling, almost hiding it from sight.
"Then you can do all the exerting. I will lie down for you prettily and you can fuck me. How does that sound?" Draco lifted his head and ran his tongue slowly across his upper lip.
„I love you too. I‘ll see you in the evening,“ Draco kissed Harry once more and left the office with a longing look thrown over his shoulder.
Suddenly, Draco grabbed Harry by the hips and rolled him over on his back violently. Harry gasped at the wild look in Draco's eyes. Harry's stomach clenched with want and his spine arched involuntarily. Draco grabbed Harry's legs and threw them over his shoulders. He leaned in and grabbed Harry by the neck with both hands. He started slamming inside Harry's hole, the movement so hard Harry's whole body shook from it. Draco's cock was like a piston, drilling inside Harry so fast he thought his arsehole would catch on fire from the friction. The sound of Draco's balls slamming fiercely against Harry's arse was the most arousing sound Harry had ever heard. The feeling of Draco's prick inside him and his hands squeezing the breath out of him was suddenly too much. Harry couldn't breathe, he trashed violently against the bed, his eyes rolled inside his head as the force of his orgasm tore through his body, his cock spurting an incredible amount of come all over his stomach.
"Not everyone here is interested in Potter's private life. Go and be disgusting somewhere else, will you?" hurt flashed through Draco's eyes.
"I'm not going anywhere," Draco gulped and felt his words resonate through his body. He would never leave Harry.
Parkinson was leaning in her chair with her feet on top of her desk. She was chewing bubblegum and winding it on her index finger in a slow, bored manner. She stared at Harry apprehensively. Harry ignored her and snatched some Floo powder from the bowl on the mantelpiece.
When Kreacher returned with the flowers, he spelled the petals off half of the roses and scattered them across the floor and the foam in the bathtub. He arranged the remaining flowers in several vases he'd transfigured from the empty shower gel bottles he'd meant to throw out ages ago.
Harry clenched his fists and nodded slowly. He was furious. He'd tried to convince the Ministry for months to get better equipment for the Auror force. The Aurors weren't safe out there, at night. No one was safe. Had they had the equipment they needed two months ago, Ron would have still been… Harry shook his head. He needed to concentrate on the mission, he needed to stay focused and try to protect the other Aurors as best as he could, if the Ministry's ossified ways would not.
Harry could feel the fabric of his T-Shirt getting soaked with her tears. He rubbed her back with his palm in soft, slow circles.
Draco must have sensed something in the tone of her voice because he quickly turned around and clasped her shoulders in his hands. "Don't be afraid, don't let the ghosts feed off of your fear. You know it only makes them stronger," he gulped and with that he faced the mansion again, climbing up the three steps to the porch. The double door leading inside the foyer stood ajar. A wave of uneasiness wafted from the inside. It felt different from any haunted place Pansy had ever been to, not that she visited that many. Usually, it was Draco and Theo going out on the jobs. And Blaise before. She was never as good as any of the men at sensing the presence of ghosts and disentangling her own feelings from those inflicted upon her by the apparitions. She could never tell if she was projecting her own growing feeling of disquiet onto the haunted sites. She couldn't tell if the fear slowly creeping up her spine was hers or if it was miasma, a feeling of unease caused by the proximity of ghosts. The only thing Pansy was sure about now was, that she didn't want to enter the house.
The ghost floated back a few steps and charged the iron barrier with all its incorporeal strength. Bits of ectoplasm scattered to the floor in pale clusters. Not a single piece of it landed inside the circle. Draco frowned. The ghost recoiled and opened its mouth in a wail.
Harry wiped the tears off of his face resolutely. He unlocked the bathroom door and joined Malfoy in his office.
"I…" Harry trailed off. He couldn't let Hermione down now. "No, of course not, I'm not that childish. Malfoy and I are going out in the evening. I'll be over at yours as soon as we finish."
Draco's eyes are fixed on Harry's, his pupils dilated but his face shows fear. Harry makes to pull away but Draco keeps him where he is with a push of his hands.
Harry slid the remains of the ripped shirt off Draco's arms and let it fall to the floor. He let the tips of his fingers caress Draco's wrists, up his arms to his shoulders. Harry's head was buried in the crook of Draco's neck and he was breathing hard. Draco couldn't believe that such a simple touch could make him that turned on. He felt goosebumps rise on his arms and on his sides. His nipples hardened and his cock jumped in his come-stained trousers. Harry took a step back and Draco's breath caught in his throat at the look of pure love in Harry's eyes. Their gazes locked as Harry ran his palms across Draco's pectorals, while his thumbs caressed Draco's nipples. He stared into the emerald green eyes, while Harry's hands roamed lower, and Draco felt his body quiver as Harry undid the buttons of his trousers teasingly, one by one, taking his time. Harry's gaze held more hunger now, as he dragged Draco's trousers down his thighs, taking the pants with it. Draco felt free as he kicked the trousers off and they both finally stood stark naked in front of each other.
The next morning, Harry stepped out of the Floo and dusted off his shirt. The reception area he found himself in couldn't be described in any other way than cheesy. Harry could have easily found himself on the set of one of those private detective B movies he sometimes secretly watched on TV. There were two doors with frosted-glass panels leading out of the room. Harry presumed those were the offices of the private investigators.
"On Wednesday we'll have to go through the details me and Pansy managed to gather on the Emsworth case as Potter and I are going to visit the manifestation place that evening. On Thursday, you're back to the library, Pans. Potter and I will make some use of his Auror training and try to infiltrate the Muggle police to find out any clues from their investigation of the Gladstone property. Does that sound good to everyone?" Draco asked.
"Anyway, Type Twos. Let's start with those you've already had the pleasure to meet. The most common one would be a Spectre. They always form a clear apparition, in some cases, they may seem almost solid. Usually, they are an accurate visual echo of the deceased as they were when alive or newly dead. Some of them are neutral or benign in their dealings with the living, perhaps returning to reveal a secret or make right an ancient wrong. Some, however, are actively hostile and their primary goal is to cause pain to humans. Presumably to make them suffer as they had suffered themselves in their deaths. You were chased by Spectres back in the mansion," Draco explained.
„I will wait until you are ready, I promise,“ Harry breathed out in desperation. He didn‘t want Draco‘s pity. He didn‘t want to hear that Draco didn‘t want their relationship to be serious. Harry didn‘t want to hear Draco utter those words Harry was so scared of. I don‘t want you.
Draco rolled Harry over and slithered down Harry‘s body to comfortably rest between his legs. He noticed that Harry‘s erection had wilted during his rant but he knew it wouldn‘t stay that way for long. He gently took Harry‘s prick in his mouth, rolled his tongue over the soft flesh, and felt heat pool in his stomach as it quickly grew against his palate and tongue. Draco lifted his gaze and met Harry‘s eyes. They were still hurt and a single tear streaked down his cheek. Lust was beginning to darken Harry‘s expression but the tear nearly broke Draco‘s heart. He released Harry‘s cock and crawled back up to kiss Harry gently on the lips.
"Maybe," Malfoy looked at him sideways and scooted closer so that their legs were touching from hip to ankle.
„Harry, why would I?“ Draco looked at him, pain lacing his eyes. He swayed on his feet. He grabbed the mantel to stay upright. „I‘m feeling really awful right now. God, everything hurts, why does my body hurt so much?“ Draco whispered.
"Draco, dear, stop flirting with Potter and concentrate on getting us out of here," Pansy jabbed her elbow in Draco's side. For a curvy girl, her elbow was quite sharp.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair nervously. He lowered his hand carefully, ready to retract it in case Malfoy decided to bite him, and placed it gently on his shoulder again. Malfoy didn't shake it off this time and Harry felt relieved by the small mercy. He squeezed Malfoy's shoulder reassuringly.
„Good, really good. Excellent actually. Ummm, do you remember when I told you I‘ve met someone special? Someone beautiful and amazing and funny and witty and surreal at blowjobs?“ Harry babbled nervously and shot a quick glance at Draco who was leaning against a doorframe. Draco rolled his eyes but looked pleased nonetheless.
"Thank you, it was a pleasure meeting you. Ms. Parkinson will see you out," Draco stood up and they shook hands.
Harry shuffled inside, dragging his feet behind. He was a wreck, Draco thought. He looked even worse than when the doctor gave Draco the diagnosis. Harry‘s head was cast down, his gaze fixed on the floor. He was chewing the inside of his mouth vigorously.
The spell wears off some ten minutes after the door has clicked shut behind the werewolf. Harry rushes to Draco's side, his legs stiff. He wobbles but manages to cross the room without falling. Harry's cheeks are tear-stained, snot running out of his nose. He wipes it off with the back of his hand mindlessly. He doesn't know what to do. Draco keeps lying there, still, a husk, gazing somewhere far off, unmoving. Harry gingerly picks the shreds of Draco's pants off the floor and wipes the offending white streaks off of Draco's skin.
„Are you real or am I still dreaming?“, Harry asked still half asleep, a happy smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
"Are you OK, baby?" Harry took Draco's face in his hands and looked into those beautiful grey eyes. Draco looked confused and uncomprehending for a moment. Tears of relief and happiness streamed down Harry's cheeks. It was over. Draco was safe.
„Do you know how hard it is, sitting in Potions with a full-on erection? While you parade yourself there, all sweaty and sexy, shirt half unbuttoned, smirking all the bloody time. And then you have the audacity to taunt me? Telling me how you‘d love to squeeze me so hard I fucking faint?“ Harry moaned. His movements were becoming erratic.
"I don't remember any of it, Pans," Draco's throat was sore from crying and his chest hurt. "And yet I feel this void inside me and I don't know what to do about it. I feel so strange all the time as if I'm waiting for something to happen but I don't even know what that something is."
Harry Vanished the rose petals and the puddles of water on the floor. He blew out the candles and went to join Draco in the bedroom. Draco was lying on the bed, stretched seductively on the grey sheets. Harry had asked Kreacher to change the sheets to grey when they returned from the hospital. Draco against grey sheets was his favourite sight in the whole world. Draco was beautiful, his long pale limbs, the barely visible platinum blonde trail of hair on his abdomen leading to his groin, the wetness from his hair staining the silk pillowcase darker. Not even the fact that his mouth was slightly open and he was snoring softly could take away from his beauty. In Harry's opinion, it only made him more gorgeous.
"Right," Harry took a deep breath and coughed a bit more. "That was the worst attempt at flirting I've ever heard."
„Good, that‘s good,“ Draco whispered against Harry‘s lips. „I‘m still loose from our morning fuck and I want you to take me right here, right now, on your desk. I want you to remember shagging me here every single time you're sitting at your desk.“
Potter looked at him like a lost puppy, his eyes wide and sad. He was pouting and frowning slightly.
"I didn't…" Potter trailed off, unsure how to continue. "Look, we're partners, whether you like it or not. I'm here if you need someone to talk to. I'm sure we can manage to hold a civil conversation for once."
Harry was sitting numbly in front of the fireplace. He‘d trashed the whole house, throwing plates, glasses, and statuettes across the rooms, kicking over chairs, and overturning tables. He saw red, he couldn‘t think and all he was able to do was vent the fury by breaking stuff. When the rage finally dissipated hours later, he was left feeling numb. He Reparoed the broken furniture, glasses, and plates. He couldn‘t save the mess he‘d made of the liquor cabinet. Puddles of gin, whiskey, and cognac drenched the oak floor. He vanished the liquids as best as he could and sat down on the floor, waiting for Draco to come home.
„Three months? But you broke up with Ginny three months ago!“ Ron shouted. „Don‘t tell me you broke my sister‘s heart because of the pointy Ferret!“ He was pointing the doughnut in Harry‘s direction threateningly.
"I'm sorry for punching you," Malfoy whispered, his gaze locking with Harry's. Harry could see the sincerity there, the desire for forgiveness.
Draco had never been friends with Tracey back at Hogwarts and even though they shared most of their classes, they barely ever spoke. Draco appreciated she dropped everything to meet with him, even though he knew she did it because of Potter.
They would be sitting on a sofa in their flat in front of the fireplace right now. She would be lying with her head in his lap. He would run his fingers through her hair lovingly. He would place tiny kisses on her knuckles, kiss her temple gently, rub her belly, waiting for their baby to kick.
It seemed that the taunts worked, as Harry slowly inched his way down Draco's body and kneeled between his legs. Harry summoned the lube from the bedside table and smirked down at Draco. Draco's heart warmed when he saw his own signature smirk curl Harry's lips.
Harry's smile turned wicked. He straddled Draco's chest in one quick movement and brought his prick to Draco's lips. He dragged his leaking cock across Draco's cheek and Draco opened his mouth hungrily. He wanted this so much. He ran his hands up Harry's thighs and could feel the tremble running through his muscles. One of his hands came to rest on the firmness of Harry's arse, and he let his other hand cup Harry's balls. Harry's head fell heavily back as he groaned out his pleasure.
"Are you trying to kill the Ferret again, Harry?" Ron clutched his hand over his heart in mock concern.
Granger studied his face for a moment, her expression turning thoughtful. "I believe you," she said at last. "But I beg you, please reconsider it. It is really important. I have a theory, but I need to verify it. I'm not sure if Harry told you but I need samples of ectoplasm."
Potter's knee bumped against Draco's thigh. Draco tensed and glanced at Potter out of the corner of his eye. Potter was talking animatedly with Weasley (Draco had no idea which Weasley it was, the only cognitive sign being a scar across his face). Draco was torn between moving his leg away and not moving at all. If he moved, he would lose the pleasant heat of Potter's knee. On the other hand, if he didn't pull away and Potter noticed their legs touching, he would surely ask why Draco hadn't moved. Draco fought the need to shift in his seat. His cock was starting to fill slightly, the feel of Potter proving to be too much for his poor sex-deprived body. When was the last time he got laid? It must have been before he and Potter became partners. That was surely the reason his body was reacting like this. It had nothing to do with Potter as such, just the fact that he was close, and his body heat was luxurious. Oh God and he smelled amazing.
Draco was shaken to his core. What Granger had just shown him, changed his perspective of the world. Suddenly, he found himself in an alternate universe where he wanted to help her and Potter in what they were trying to achieve. Granger's theory sounded farfetched and crazy at first but the longer he thought about it, the more he hoped she was right. If her research proved correct, they could save so many people, so many lives, and hopefully one day, they could figure out the bloody Problem. They could find out why ghosts could suddenly kill people with a bare touch. Maybe, just maybe, they could change the world for the better, make it safer. Make it what it used to be.
"I just wanted to feel useful," Harry sighed, suddenly feeling defeated. Nothing ever seemed to work out the way he wanted.
Harry jumped in his seat again as the door to the pub opened. A group of middle-aged witches entered, giggling. They were clearly inebriated already. Harry's heart sunk lower. It was nine already and still no sight of his blonde partner.
"Hi Pansy," Draco greeted her gingerly when she stepped through the Floo to his flat. Draco had called her and invited her over but now that Pansy was there, he suddenly wanted to be left alone.
"Pansy's fault and piss off," Draco coughed. "Anyway, I think it's good you can hear the ghosts. Sometimes you can't choose your abilities but you have to accept them and learn to live with them."
Harry settles himself between Draco's legs, bends them so that his thighs rest comfortably on Harry's shoulders. Harry curls his arms around Draco's hips and splays his palms across Draco's stomach. Harry licks Draco's prick from the base up to the tip. He runs his tongue along the sensitive ridge under the head and feels Draco shudder under him.
"I won't argue with you as that is a distinct possibility," Granger smiled. "However, I don't think he would blindly wander the streets."
"Come here," he stepped forward and wrapped Harry tightly in his arms. Draco snuck one arm around Harry's back and let the other settle in the mop of messy black hair. He carded his fingers through the surprisingly soft, silky strands.
Suddenly, the door to their cell creaks open. Harry is hit with a force of a spell that sends him flying across the room. He lands on the cot, in a half-sitting, half-lying position. His head hits the wall and he blacks out for a few seconds. When he comes back to himself, panic floods his body. He can't move, he can't speak, he can't blink. He can only watch the scene unfolding in front of him with growing terror.
"What did the moron do?" Draco growled. "Can you feel how agitated the house is? It's angry, furious actually."
"What? Pull-down staircases leading to haunted attics?" Harry snickered. "Don't be such a wuss, Malfoy."
Draco's eyes widened as he took in the bathroom. It was beautiful, better than he'd imagined it would look like. He didn't expect Harry would go all the way and get fresh roses for him.
„Where is he? I can‘t wait to meet him. And why are you so secretive about this Harry?“ Hermione narrowed her eyes suspiciously.
"Go on, have a laugh! I'm twenty-eight and still a fucking virgin," Draco growled at him. Behind the scowl, Harry could see panic.
„You know I was joking, right, Harry?“ Ron looked at him sharply. „You can‘t sneak around, spying on your boyfriend. He will go bonkers if he finds out! It‘s not right.“
"Not too busy today, which means I had a lot of time to work on the spell," Hermione smiled back, her eyes sparkling with excitement.
Harry crossed the room over to Ron and placed a cup of coffee on his desk. Then he sat down at his own desk and yawned.
Harry's eyes fluttered shut expectantly and Draco took his time to admire the long black lashes that fell on his cheeks. He leaned in slowly and flicked his tongue across Harry's lips gently. Harry whimpered and Draco's heart jumped in his chest. It was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. Draco's whole body was thrumming with rightness. He felt as if a piece of himself that was missing slotted itself back into place. He deepened the kiss, suddenly desperate to taste Harry, to know what it felt like to force his tongue inside Harry's mouth. Draco felt like flying. His body was weightless as Harry's hands pulled him in firmly, their chests finally touching. Their movements became frantic, desperate and Harry's sighs and moans drove Draco crazy with need.
"You went first the last time," Draco said carelessly, waving his arm dismissively. "It's my turn now. Can't have you steal all the glory, can I?"
Harry looked at him in disbelief. The corners of his mouth twitched. All of a sudden, Harry burst out laughing.
Hermione took a shuddering sigh and tried to hold back the tears, threatening to spill down her cheeks. She knew it was a lost battle. Her body started shaking with suppressed sobs. She hugged herself tightly and buried her face in the crook of her shoulder, pretending it was Ron hugging her, Ron's strong arms wrapped around her. She whimpered and let the tears fall.
"Potter?" Pansy laughed. "Shouldn't you start calling him Harry already? Or is this some weird kink you guys have? Do you call him Potter in bed while he fucks you, too?"
He didn't mean to say that out loud but it escaped his lips. Draco felt as if an invisible hand was squeezing his heart and his chest hurt. He turned his face away from Potter and curled on his side.
Draco had a feeling as if he'd missed something important. It seemed as if everyone around him was in on some kind of a secret or a joke and Draco was the only one who hadn't gotten the memo. Well, him and Ron perhaps. Ron seemed to be oblivious to everything and barely even noticed how upset Harry had been. Draco thanked Merlin for his own sharp wit. Nothing ever escaped his attention.
"Give me a single valid reason why you don't want to take me with you. And the fact that you hate me doesn't count as a valid reason," Harry was starting to get angry. Count on Malfoy to make things more difficult than they had to be. Why couldn't he put their past behind him like Harry was trying to do?
"Robards benched us. We're off the field for the rest of the week. What have you done this time?" Ron asked him slowly.
"I think I'm onto something! I just have to verify a few details," Hermione's eyes were glinting in the firelight. She turned on her heel and waddled through the archway into the adjoined library without another word.
The Specters were floating closer to them, they were almost all the way up the stairs now, all three squished against each other, eager to reach him and Pansy. Draco threw a salt bomb at them and watched as they dispersed.
"What do you mean by not good and why are you back in the fucking circle?" Pansy's voice sounded shrilly. "Or more specifically, why the hell are we still inside and not at a safe distance to Apparate the fuck out of here?"
"Weasley," Draco's voice was pitched low and held a tinge of unfriendliness. He was propped on his elbows, one leg bent at the knee. His hair was slightly tousled from their short nap, his lips wet and shiny as if he'd just licked them, his eyes were half-lidded and sultry. Harry knew Draco was making himself look spectacular on purpose, a way of marking his territory.
Draco scowled at him but obediently stepped into the bathtub. He hissed when his toes touched the water surface. It was still hot, Harry must have placed heating charms on the water. Draco groaned and slowly lowered himself into the tub. Harry moved so that he was standing behind him and ran his palms across Draco's shoulders, up and down his arms, over his pectorals. He pinched Draco's nipples and chuckled when Draco arched his back into the touch. Harry's hands continued down, across Draco's chiseled-out abdomen, the fingers splayed wide. He stopped where Draco's hips molded into his thighs.
Draco inwardly enjoyed all the attention he was getting from Harry, and he knew, that Harry knew Draco loved it, but they both grumbled anyway.
Draco tumbled out of his Floo and shut it behind him. He closed the connection so that Harry couldn‘t follow him. He crawled out of the fireplace, leaving smears of soot in his wake, and fell on the white fluffy carpet in front of his sofa. He felt sick, both physically and mentally. All of the muscles in his arms, legs, abdomen, and back hurt as if he‘d spent the whole day lifting weights. He had no idea what was happening to him and hoped it was all just a nightmare. His body was burning up with a fever and he felt like throwing up. He managed to shift and lie on his side, curling up in a fetal position. He realized with a start he was crying, loud sobs echoing in the dark emptiness of his flat. Why did Harry shout at him like that? Harry had never shouted at him before. What did Draco do to deserve being treated like that by the man he loved so much? Why would Harry accuse him of cheating when they spent nearly all of their free time together? Where would he get the fucking time to cheat? Moreover why in the bloody hell would Draco cheat when Harry was more than he ever hoped for? And then the most hurtful thought pierced his mind and wedged itself deep in his brain and heart. Why did Harry not trust him? Harry had promised nothing would ever change the way he felt about Draco and yet, mere days after that promise, Harry suddenly didn‘t trust him at all. Fuck him and fuck his friends then, Draco thought. If only he could get up and take a shower, and then crawl to bed. Everything would be better then. Draco tried to push up on arms and lift himself up. A sharp pain ran through his whole body. For a moment, blackness enveloped his vision and all he could hear was a screeching sound as if someone was blowing a whistle in his ear. His stomach turned and he threw up. He fell back to the floor, the world around him dissipating.
"God, I never thought I would say this but I love bickering with you," Harry's voice was still tinged with laughter. "It's quickly become the favourite part of my day."
„Mr. Malfoy, glad to see you awake,“ the medi-wizard said. He was tall, blonde, and quite handsome, Draco noticed. He was holding a clipboard with notes written across it.
Harry stood up with a sigh and leaned in once more to kiss Draco's temple. He crossed the room and opened the door. He turned around wistfully and glanced back at Draco. "I love you."
"I don't think that's true, Malfoy," Harry pressed on. "I think you want to help, just like me," Harry paused and fixed his eyes on Malfoy's. "Look, Hermione came up with a theory that I need to verify. She thinks that each ghost is tied to our world through a specific Source. What if we can locate the Sources of the ghosts? What if that's how we could banish them?" Harry's eyes were shining with suppressed excitement.
„I have to admit,“ Draco smiled at Harry while cleaning up the glasses and plates. „Your plan worked out rather well, didn‘t it?“
He pronounced every word deliberately slowly, exaggerating every syllable in his posh accent. "There are two basic types of ghosts you can encounter. Type One and Type Two. Theo, Blaise, and I classified the relatively harmless ones under Type One. However, that doesn't mean you can let your guard down around them. A Type One can easily off you if you don't pay attention at all times to its location."
„But you have to wait for it,“ Draco snickered. He licked slowly over Harry‘s arsehole, circling the soft skin there with his tongue.
"What I mean is, I came to ask to have my partner back, now that he's back from MACUSA," Malfoy's face was red. Harry thought he was either exhausted from his sprint or blushing profusely. He hoped for the second option.
„Let me lift you up, let me help you,“ Harry choked out through tears welling up in his eyes. He could barely speak over the lump that had formed in his throat. He loathed seeing Draco in so much pain. He hated himself for being responsible for Draco fainting in his own vomit, all alone. Harry wished he had a Time-Turner so that he could go back to when Draco stumbled in pain through the fireplace in Grimmauld Place.
"And whose fault would that be? It's your bad you're daft. At least you acknowledge your shortcomings," Draco got up and smirked at Harry's disbelieving expression.
„Harry!“ Hermione exclaimed. „Come on, let‘s go, we have Transfiguration next. I don‘t want to be late.“
Draco took her hand and felt the presence in his mind tremble expectantly, lulling him gently back into the feeling of harmlessness. Draco steeled his mind, sharpening it. He erected a quick shield between his mind and the tendrils of the presence trying to overpower him. He didn't use Occlumency, as it would draw the attention of ghosts but he built a wall with the sheer strength of his will. He pushed with his mind against the presence at the same time he pulled on Pansy's hand. She stumbled toward him and Draco caught her in his arms.
The medi-wizard trained his sad brown eyes on Harry and shook his head. "I'm sorry. There are no vital signs. They're gone."
a plonker and he scowled at him. "Blaise, piss off. Why am I a plonker? The arsehole who doesn't see how bloody amazing Harry is, is the one who deserves to be called a plonker, not me!"
"Thank you very much, Kreacher. As Harry said, that will be all for now," Draco nodded and tried to hide his crotch inconspicuously as it was approximately at Kreacher's eye level.
"Just, fuck me already, forget the fingers," Harry growled impatiently. "Split me open with your cock already!"
„Harry, please tell me you are not obsessing over Malfoy again,“ Hermione whispered in his direction.
Harry ignored him, mounted his broom, and started off towards Malfoy, shouting something about proper broom grips. Ron shook his head and headed back toward the castle. Fucking Malfoy and fucking Harry.
„We don‘t have to talk about this until you feel ready. Just… just don‘t leave me, please,“ Harry was starting to hyperventilate, his eyes full of fear, tears threatening to spill down his cheeks.
"Funny," Draco leaned closer to Harry, emboldened by Harry's laughter, and pulled at his hair gently. "And I was OK with letting you walk around with a bird's nest on your head?"
Harry grabbed Tracey's wrist and pulled her back, away from prying eyes and ears, as they headed toward the Apparition point. "Be careful out there, Tracey. Stay close to me and if we get separated, send me a Patronus with your exact location the moment you see something suspicious."
"Draco, please, please breathe." Potter's voice was desperate. In these moments, Draco could pretend Potter actually cared about him.
They sat down to a large round table set with silverware and white cloth napkins. Cut roses decorated the room, and a large chandelier illuminated it with soft warm light. Their appetizers appeared on the plates in front of them minutes later. The marinated goat cheese served with grilled asparagus only served to irritate Harry's stomach. He was starving and wolfed down his portion to chuckles coming from Draco's seat.
"Don't say things you don't mean," Draco breathed out. He needed to be sure he was reading Potter's signs correctly. Draco was attracted to him, and he couldn't stop thinking about what it would be like to kiss him and maybe do more than just kissing, but he would never open himself to a one-night stand. If anything was to happen, Draco needed to be sure it would lead to more.
"Yes…" Harry replied slowly. He appeared to be straining his ears to distinguish the sounds coming from downstairs from the howling of the wind. "I think it's on the pull-down stairs now."
Harry knew he deserved that jab, as he frequently paraded his lovers in front of Draco in hope to make him jealous. Harry had always known it was childish but now, seeing the pain in Draco's eyes, he realized he might have inadvertently ruined their relationship before it even started. Why did that thought hurt so much? Harry needed to get out, to breathe.
They headed calmly toward the Atrium not to arouse any suspicion from their fellow Aurors. The ride in the lift felt like torture and Harry had to hold himself still not to start pacing nervously in the small cabin. Suddenly, there was a tiny tug in his midsection.
„You fucking wanker, stop lying to me, stop pretending you‘re sick,“ Harry‘s self-control finally broke and he started shouting at Draco. „Admit it, you‘re cheating on me. Look me in the eyes and tell me the truth!“
Once they were inside the lift, mercifully alone, Draco slumped against the wall, all his swagger gone in an instant. "I hate this," he pressed the palms of his hands against his eyes and growled frustratingly.
"Of course I missed you, you twat! You know what, just forget it," Harry dismissed him with a wave and went to his desk. He sat down in his chair. It was good to be back home even though Malfoy was being a bigger nuisance than usual. Harry was happy to see him again and he sneaked a peek at him from under his lashes. He had either forgotten just how stunning Malfoy was or he was even more gorgeous than usual today.
Harry stuffed his mouth full of chicken and chewed it for as long as possible in order to avoid answering. Hermione's gaze never wavered and he felt it drilling into him.
„At least 10 minutes I think,“ Harry breathed out. His head was spinning because all the blood had suddenly moved to his nether region. Within seconds, his cock was almost hard. He could feel Draco‘s erection pressing against his stomach.
Harry forced himself to stay silent, wand poised to strike the moment Ginny uttered the first curse. He understood what Draco was trying to do. If Ginny confessed, if she told him in detail how she planned to hurt Draco, Harry could disarm her before she actually cast any of the spells.
„I don‘t mean scared as in scared, obviously. I meant afraid, not that you‘re afraid of anything, mind you, you‘re a Malfoy. I just… I just…,“ Harry fired out another salvo of words. He was starting to get distressed, desperately hoping for some kind of reaction from Draco, other than a frown.
"I can see you're back to your charming self," Harry shook his head in exasperation and rubbed his eyes sleepily. He was so happy Draco was awake he wanted to wrap his arms around him and kiss him silly. He knew Draco wouldn't appreciate the sentiment but Harry beamed at him anyway. Draco's head was bowed and he seemed serious. Harry thought he must be in pain and presumed that professing his undying love to Draco at this moment might earn him a punch in the face. Instead, he tried to cheer him up with their usual banter. "Here goes my hope that your brain suffered enough damage and you would wake up being actually pleasant for once."
„We are going to run various tests on Mr. Malfoy. Both diagnostical charms and examine his blood for any potions or unpredicted substances. Then we will give Mr. Malfoy a dose of Dreamless Sleep. You will then be shown into his room and allowed to stay with him until he wakes up. Now, please wait here, until we transport Mr. Malfoy to his room.“
Harry had a rough time pretending there was no heat rushing into his groin at the words baby boy and fuck. How he wanted to hear Draco utter those words while pushing Harry against a wall, his hands twisted in Harry's hair, their erections pressed tight against each other. Harry pushed those thoughts away quickly. Now was not the time to think about sex. He had to concentrate on the matter at hand. Hunting ghosts.
Harry didn't seem to pay any attention to Draco's shouts and curses and kept fucking him with his tongue. He must have opened the vial because suddenly, there was a slick finger inside Draco's arse.
Harry did as he was told without really meaning to. Why would Hermione not tell him that the supposedly best ghost-hunting agency was owned by the Slytherins? Or at least co-ran by a Slytherin. Surely, Harry thought, it couldn't get any worse.
Granger beamed at him and hugged him tight, as much as her belly allowed her. "I'm glad to hear that. I never expected to say that, but we need you, Draco."
Harry got up, cast a gentle Wingardium Leviosa on Draco, and levitated him toward the entrance. He was afraid of touching Draco again, causing him any more pain in the process. Outside of the flat, he grabbed Draco‘s wrist as softly as he could and Apparated them to the St Mungo‘s reception area.
Harry didn't know what to say. As always, he felt inadequate with his words and anything that would sprout out of his mouth would undoubtedly never express his reassurance properly. Instead, he knocked Draco's legs apart with his knee and stepped between them. He kissed the tip of Draco's nose and when Draco lifted his head, Harry angled his head and ran his tongue along Draco's silky, freshly-shaven jawline. Draco shuddered under him. Harry licked and sucked the spot where his jawline met the slender, pale neck and Draco gasped. Harry ran his hands across Draco's abdomen and pressed his palms firmly against the hardness of the muscles. Harry imagined kneeling on the floor of the lift, pulling Draco's cock out of his trousers and sucking him off, until Draco's knees buckled with pleasure. Instead, he let his finger run lower and stroked just a fingertip across Draco's hardening prick.
Montague snickered and whispered something into McLaggen's ear. They both rolled their eyes. Robards ignored them all. "Any relevant questions to the case?"
„Please go on, Harry. However, you might want to keep such unwarranted information to yourself. I‘m sure your boyfriend wouldn‘t appreciate you sharing that with us, given we‘ve never even met,“ Hermione lectured him.
Harry returned downstairs and found Draco lounging on the sofa with a book propped against his bent knee. Harry tried to engrave the moment into his memory. He came so close to losing this. He couldn't imagine coming to an empty house. Without Draco, Grimmauld Place would never be home again, it would feel like a dusty old crypt. He crossed the room and held out his hand toward Draco.
Harry takes in the broken boy under him. How did they get here? When did the world become so fucked up? He looks into Draco's eyes and sees all the pleading there. But underneath, there is love and a tiny glimmer of hope. Hope for what? Harry thinks. Hope that Harry will take the pain away? Hope that they will make it out alive somehow? He can't disappoint the request in those eyes, the person behind them.
"Go on," Harry prompted her. He couldn't see where Hermione's train of thoughts lead yet but he wanted to find out why she was bouncing up and down in her seat.
Draco didn't ask again and started snapping his hips up and down, drawing his whole length out of Harry and slamming himself deep inside Harry's hole over and over again. Harry held himself still, drinking in the feeling of Draco's prick inside him. The sensation was overwhelming. It burned and hurt but Harry knew the pain would turn to pleasure soon enough. He pushed his arse up so that every time Draco slammed into him, Harry's cock would brush against the silk bedsheets.
„Ewww, that‘s disgusting! Just stop, please, I‘m eating,“ Ron either pretended to gag or gagged for real, judging by the crumbs flying out of his mouth.
Harry's eyes narrowed. There goes Malfoy, being an arsehole as usual. "I'm an Auror, I can handle myself in a fight," Harry spat.
Potter must have been truly shocked by the pursuing ghosts because he obeyed Draco without a word and stumbled into the relative safety of the iron chains.
"Wait, you're still a virgin?" Harry's eyebrows disappeared under his fringe. That couldn't be right.
Harry thought to himself and immediately wanted to smash his head against the nearest hard surface. He had to stop thinking about Malfoy that way or the prat would notice soon.
He could hear voices from the corridor. One voice belonged to Harry and the other one sounded like Draco‘s mother. The voices were muffled but Draco was able to distinguish the words nonetheless.
His hand hovered above the door handle, as he whispered to Pansy. "Get a salt bomb ready but only throw it when I tell you."
„I know but I still missed you. Today was such a strange day, I feel like I haven‘t seen you in weeks, not just a few hours,“ Draco slurred, his voice heavy with sleep.
Today was another dull day and Harry decided to clean Hermione's kitchen, making sure that this time, all the utensils, cans, boxes, plates, and cups stayed in the same place they'd been before.
"Alpha entering the front door," came a whisper in Harry's ear and he jumped a bit. He couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiousness and he forced himself to breathe in and out calmly. He looked around carefully, trying to find any traces of recent human activity. He couldn't see anything, the windows were dark, and the long, dry blades of grass seemed to be unbroken, as much as he could see by the moonlight.
Tracey shook her head in bewilderment and looked at Harry. Her gaze drifted over his shoulder and she shrieked, her face pale in the light of Harry's wand. She was trembling.
"Don't wreck the house, Mr. Malfoy, I would hate to have to send you a repair bill," the woman waved her hand dismissively. "And don't you dare perform some dark rituals or whatever you Death Eaters do nowadays."
"At the same time, as I said before, a trace can also mean a source," Hermione carried on. "Why do some dead people come back as ghosts and some not? Do you remember when I asked Headless Nick the same question years ago when we were still at Hogwarts? He said that ghosts manifest when they feel their deaths were premature or unjust. When there is something that ties them to their former life. I think there must be a specific source of each ghost, they must be tied to our world through this Source."
Even though Draco couldn't see the details of Harry's face in the dark that seemed deeper after the lightning, he could feel the anguish rolling off of him in waves. Draco knew exactly what Harry was feeling because he was feeling it too. He could almost hear Harry's unspoken plea. Please tell me we're going to be alright. Please promise me nothing will happen to you. The prospect of losing another person he was close to was something Draco wasn't willing to experience ever again and he would bet Harry was feeling the same way. Draco knew he was being selfish, even as he placed one hand on Harry's waist, the other on the back of his neck, and pulled him into a tender kiss. Their lips met briefly, finding each other in the dark perfectly, seamlessly, sweetly, as if they'd done so a thousand times before. Harry's lips were warm, soft, and pliant. Draco ended the kiss almost as soon as it began.
"He's been hurt," Harry lowered Draco on the field bed. "He's coughing out blood and bleeding severely, chest and back."
He stood up and stepped away from Potter, and leaning his hip against the desk he crossed his arms over his chest. He saw Potter out of the corner of his eye move over and a seat on the sofa.
"Who the fuck do you think you are, Potter?" Robards spat. "I told you to evacuate. You disobeyed my direct order."
„I‘ll leave you two alone for a bit. Harry, would you like something from the canteen?“ she offered.
"Alright, Potter, what's your most embarrassing sexual experience?" Draco asked shamelessly. He needed to break the oppressive sadness that had settled over them. They needed to think positively so that their feelings wouldn't make the ghost awaiting them stronger. He'd found that jokes worked the best and the fastest to improve the mood.
"Look, Davis, as I'd told Potter before, fear can fill your coffers, if you know how to milk it. Tell me, could there possibly be a better boost to my reputation than saving the Saviour?" Draco sneered, putting up the Malfoy mask he hated so much. He felt sick of himself but carried on. Let people see what they want to see, at least for the moment.
"I know, you were one of the best teams I've had. But I cannot go against an official request from Auror Malfoy," Robards raised his hand as if to forestall Harry's objections.
They left the relative safety of the kitchen with its twenty-one degrees and moved through the corridor back to the foyer, measuring the temperature in each room. There were no significant deviations, the temperature ranging from eighteen to twenty-two degrees.
The offending piece of clothing was thrown across the room, where a shirt, trousers, and pants joined it soon afterward. Potter dragged him toward the bed and they both fell on it in a heap.
Breakfast was a strange affair for Draco the next day. No matter how hard he tried, Potter never even peaked in his direction. Draco had already tried everything he could think of. Talking loudly about Potter. Talking loudly about Weasley (both the Weasel and the Weaslette). Talking loudly about Granger. He even levitated Potter‘s sausage and dropped it in his glass of pumpkin juice. Draco narrowed his eyes. He didn‘t like that Potter was ignoring him one bit and wondered what was going on with him. He got up from his seat and started walking towards the Gryffindor table. Weasley poked Potter in the ribs who instantly jumped up and cowardly ran out of the Great Hall. It left Draco morose and irritable for the rest of the day.
"I'll tell you over a cup of coffee," Theo sighed and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. His voice sounded raspy and his eyes were red-rimmed. "Where's Draco?"
Harry noticed Malfoy was biting his lip, trying not to smile. Harry couldn't help but notice that his teeth were perfectly straight and bright white.
„Fuck, fuck, this is all my fault, I am so sorry,“ Harry was torn between proving Draco he trusted him and making sure he got better. For a moment he was frozen, unable to decide what to do. If he took Draco to the hospital, Draco would be even more convinced Harry didn‘t trust him and it would ruin their relationship even more. If he took Draco to bed and his condition deteriorated, Harry didn‘t think he could live with himself.
"I'm not siding with him, I'm just glad I'm not the target of his jabs for once," Harry grinned and yelped when Draco smacked him.
He got up from the floor in a single, fluid motion and stalked forward as if he were a panther closing in on his prey.
„Stop staring at me, Potter,“ Draco growled but the way his eyes sparkled with delight betrayed him.
"Potter, you're with Davis. Derrick and Hopkins. Montague and McLaggen. I don't have to remind you this is the biggest, most important bust we've had this year. Don't screw it up," Robards looked each of the Aurors assembled in front of him in the eye. "Any questions?"
Draco relaxed his stiff shoulders. "It's just a Death-glow, Pansy," he breathed out. Death-glow was residual energy, appearing in places someone had died. The more violent the death, the stronger the light.
"Pathetic," Draco snorted with a bravado he was not feeling. "I wonder where they studied battle tactics."
„Mmm, I‘m too tired, I think I will sleep here,“ Draco pushed the plate away and lowered his head on the table.
"I think you're the only person who can kill him," Malfoy gives in. "He's awful Harry, I want him to die. I want them all to die," Malfoy's voice breaks into a harsh whisper, his head bowed low, a fringe of matted blonde hair hiding his face from view. "You can't imagine what it's like, living under the same roof with him. My father had painted this picture for me, how glorious it would be when the Dark Lord returned. I was so stupid and naive. I believed him. I wanted to be a Death Eater, to make my father proud."
„Tell them all at the same time? You‘re brilliant, Draco,“ Harry exclaimed suddenly. „We're going to tell them all! Let‘s organize a dinner for Hermione and Ron and Pansy and Blaise. I know it‘s begging for a disaster but you are part of my life now and they have to deal with it. I don‘t want to tiptoe around them anymore. You‘re mine and maybe shocking them into accepting us as a couple is the best course of action,“ Harry nodded to himself. His eyes gleamed with sheer determination. It scared Draco a bit if he was honest with himself.
„We didn‘t want to make the dinner too formal therefore we decided to eat here on the couch. Also, the closeness of the Floo was a rather good feature, in case someone decided to bail after seeing me here,“ Draco looked pointedly in Ron‘s direction. „Anyway, I‘m going to bring the food in.“
Beads of sweat trickled down Draco‘s spine as he dug his fingers deeper into Harry‘s hips. He knew he wasn‘t going to last much longer. Luckily he could tell Harry was close too, by the frantic breaths and wails that were escaping his panting mouth. Draco sneaked an arm under Harry and pulled him up, tight against his chest. He held him there and continued pounding Harry‘s arse. The movement was less deep now but the pleasure of their bodies touching, feeling Harry trembling in his arms, feeling the frenzied beating of his heart against his ribs, brought him close to the edge. He released his death grip on Harry‘s hip and started jerking him off. He thrust his hips forward once, twice, three times more, and felt himself spill inside Harry. Harry followed him a few seconds later, shooting come all over Draco‘s hand and the sofa.
He'd called Harry by his given name, not Potter or Scarhead. He observed Malfoy as he ranted and waved his arms around. Harry had to admit Malfoy looked amazing like this, full of life and passion, anger and… feelings. His hair was messy and plastered to his face with sweat. There was a dark smudge of ash across his cheek and Harry was overpowered by a sudden urge to wipe it off. He resisted but only barely. Apparently, Harry got off on Malfoy saving him.
Harry shook himself and realized that Malfoy must have been studying him as intently as Harry had been examining him. Harry felt self-conscious all of a sudden. He knew he looked good, his hair was still messy as usual but Harry thought that together with the carefully trimmed beard he sported these days, it looked kind of sexy. Harry had also gained some muscle mass during his grueling Auror training and the constant running after criminals had kept him in shape. Today, he was wearing an emerald-green shirt and black skinny jeans which he knew hugged his arse beautifully. However, next to Malfoy he felt as if he'd just rolled out of bed not bothering to make himself presentable at all.
Some of those nights, when Harry lay in his bed and couldn't sleep, he would think about Malfoy's body. Hot water cascading over the stretch of pale skin, the way the muscles in his back moved, his narrow hips, the globes of his round arse. Harry would think of how the moisture darkened Malfoy's hair, how his spine would bow as he lifted his face up into the spray of water, washing away all traces of the day. Harry hated himself a little for imagining that Malfoy would turn around, see him standing there, and instead of hexing him, he would stretch out his hand in invitation and Harry would accept it. He imagined the slide of skin on skin, the press of their lips together, the sighs, and gasps and would wank himself raw.
As soon as he said it, an incorporeal, glowing head of the ghost appeared in the opening. The face was bloated, frozen in an expression old Mrs. Emsworth wore when she died. She was moving slowly, dragging her feet behind her, stumbling slightly on the uneven floorboards. She walked up to the beam where her body had been found and scrambled up on a stool, that was already prepared there. As was the rope. Even from afar, Draco could see her hands trembling as she almost reluctantly placed the noose around her neck. Draco knew what came next but that didn't make it any easier to watch. The old woman's ghost seemed to be fighting her own hands as if she didn't want to tighten the rope. At that moment, the stool toppled over and fell to the floor. Draco glanced at Harry from the corner of his eye. His eyes were downturned and he was studiously looking at the floor. Draco grabbed Harry's hand and intertwined their fingers. He looked back at the ghost, swinging from the beam.
"Planned to do? Are you trying to tell me you truly believe Potter has a plan? That would be a change for once," Draco snickered. This was going to be so much fun.
Draco was leaning against a wall at the back of the club, alone. Their group had dispersed in all directions during the night. Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise were sitting at a table to his left, heads bowed together, shooting occasional glances in his direction. Draco frowned. He wasn't in a mood for their obvious plotting, so he turned away from them. His gaze landed on Luna and Theo next. They were dancing together in the middle of the dance floor, lost in each other's eyes. Their relationship had been unexpected and Draco would probably never understand how the two of them managed to work out so well, considering how different they both were. His heart gave a painful lurch. He was happy for his friends but at the same time, he was a bit jealous of what they had. Draco desperately wanted to have someone in his life who would gaze at him with that much love seeping out of their every pore. He sighed and forced himself to look away from the dancing couple. At the far side of the bar, Ron and Seamus were standing on a podium, completely butchering some Muggle song (which was quite catchy but Draco would never admit it out loud) with their out-of-tune, out-of-rythm howling.
"I'm sorry too," Ron finally said. "Deep down I understand, I really do. I just wish things didn't end up this way."
"Malfoy?" Harry exclaimed. Surely, Hermione would never send him to a Slytherin den on purpose. Harry concluded in his mind that Hermione hadn't known the agency was owned by them. Maybe the owner was someone else and Malfoy's name wasn't mentioned anywhere.
"I do suck, Malfoy," Harry bit his lip seductively. "Rather spectacularly, if I say so myself. Want me to show you?"
"One," Draco reached under his coat and wrapped his hand around a small metal canister, affixed to his shoulder holster.
„Please, Mr. Potter, let me finish,“ the doctor asked politely. He seemed to expect a similar reaction and appeared capable to deal with potential outbursts.
„Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,“ Harry was whispering under his breath. He looked like he was going to be sick, his face was green, his breathing shallow.
Draco took all of Harry's body in, now that he was standing in front of him, naked and gorgeous, all soft skin and lean muscle. His prick was hard and thick, his pubic hair neatly trimmed.
Harry couldn't hold back the giggle that escaped his throat. He looked at the real Malfoy in disbelief. Malfoy's gaze didn't waver from the parchment but Harry could swear the smirk on his face was almost fond. It was the first time Malfoy's signature expression warmed Harry's heart pleasantly. Harry smiled to himself and flicked to page one.
Harry crossed the room, lifted Draco's leg up, and placed it gently onto his lap. He started massaging Draco's foot. As always, Draco had kicked off his shoes and socks as soon as his feet hit the floor of their home.
Kingsley and Robards shared a contemplative look. Some kind of silent communication seemed to pass between them. Finally, Robards turned back to Harry and nodded. "You have one week, not a minute more."
"You and Malfoy, take the left, Smith and Nott will be on your right. You are to sneak in under Disillusionment Charm and evaluate the situation. The robbers are holding hostages, we don't know how many. Do not engage unless it is absolutely necessary. We are waiting for the negotiator to arrive, he should be here any minute."
The house itself was an old Victorian mansion, some of its windows were boarded shut, others broken. The glass gleamed in the moonlight threateningly, like sharp teeth of a basilisk. The front patio seemed deserted, except for an old rocking chair moving soundlessly in the wind. The building appeared to be deserted too but Harry couldn't shake the feeling someone was watching him. It made goosebumps run across his arms and spine. Davis Apparated beside him and touched his arm to let him know she was there. Tracey was the last Auror scheduled to appear on the scene, which meant they were ready for action.
They both chuckled at that in unison. Draco startled, realizing this was the first time ever he and Granger shared a joke. It was an oddly pleasant experience, one he wouldn't mind occurring again.
Harry blushed and gaped at her. Hermione swearing was not a sight one got to experience very often. "Is this the hormones talking?"
Harry shut his eyes tightly and counted to ten. When he opened his eyes again, his eyes confirmed that
"Fuck me already, please," Potter begged. He was panting hard, his arse thrusting vigorously against Draco's fingers.
"Please fuck me, Harry," Draco begged. His body was begging for Harry's cock inside him. He needed to feel him there, as deep as it would go and from the blowjob he'd given him minutes before, he could tell it would be very deep indeed.
"Mrs. Malfoy? Is it possible to love someone too much? So much that it's actually bad for you? So much it can drive you mad?" Harry voiced out the question silently. It had been nagging at his mind ever since Friday night. It seemed like ages ago.
"Robards wants to see you," Draco shot in Goldstein's direction as soon as he walked through the door of his office.
Harry turned on his heel and followed Draco into their office. He was breathing hard and wanted to punch the wall. Instead, he stepped into the office gingerly, wanting to assure Draco he was none of the things Smith had thrown in his face. The sight of Draco, hunched over his desk, his shoulders slumped in defeat, almost broke his heart.
"Oh, really? I'm positive I wouldn't even recognize it if you were trying to flirt with me," Harry stuck his chin out in a challenge.
Next to him, he could feel Potter grin at the word associate and Draco had to fight off a fond smile of his own.
"Potter, don't you fucking dare go out there alone," Malfoy ran after him. Harry thought he heard a tinge of panic in his voice but he dismissed it. Malfoy never cared a bit about him and he never would. Harry didn't understand why he felt hurt by that realization. It was just Malfoy, for God's sake.
Instead of replying, Ron swung at him again, hitting him with such a force that Harry fell flat on the floor. "My sister, my little baby sister is going to end up in Azkaban because of you and your shit boyfriend!" Ron's face was a shade of dark purple, spit flying from his mouth.
„Look at him,“ Harry started his rant as soon as he spotted the pale blond hair gleaming in the sun.
"Come on, Weasley, tell me what you have in store for me today," Draco taunted her. "Give me all the gory details."
"We'll figure it out. Together," Potter offered him a small, reassuring smile. Draco didn't want to feel as grateful for it as he did. He couldn't help it but he was starting to like Potter's presence in his life. He could easily get used to it if he was honest with himself.
"He's Potter, he's going to be just fine. He's too stubborn to die. Now, think of the most idiotic thing he could come up with. The stupidest, most dangerous, ghost-ridden place he could be at. I'm pretty sure that's where I'll find him," Draco sneered. Potter had always been predictable in that sense.
„Thank you, Kreacher,“ Harry shouted, already rushing up the stairs toward his bedroom. He pulled the drawer out with more force than warranted and it came crashing to the floor, spilling its contents all over Harry‘s bedroom floor.
Harry stared at Malfoy's hand for a second. It was pale, the fingers thin and long. Malfoy's grip was surprisingly strong. Harry pushed his hand off and stepped hastily through to Grimmauld Place.
"Harry," Draco interrupted him. "Promise me you won't be reckless. Remember what Robards said. Don't rush in and start throwing spells around madly. You have to let them hurt me so that both yours and Robards's memories can be used in front of the Wizengamot."
„You‘ll see, it‘s a surprise. Don‘t forget, tomorrow at seven,“ Harry grinned at his friends and shut the Floo connection abruptly. He was afraid he would not last under Hermione's interrogation long. Harry was an Auror, but Hermione was beyond anything he‘d been trained for.
"I would set up a protective circle here in the foyer, close to the stairs and to our escape route at the same time. It means we could easily run back here if the ghost starts chasing after us," Harry mused and looked at Draco for approval. Who would have thought he would one day come to desire Draco Malfoy's praise.
"Right, see you later then," Draco said and stalked out of the bedroom without waiting for an answer.
"Well, yeah," Harry rubbed the back of his neck and had the decency to blush. "She's the one who said you were cheating on me."
Draco knew something was very wrong. For some reason, Harry was hurting. Draco felt warmth spread through him when he realized Harry had come for comfort to him first. A second later he was horrified because he'd let Harry down. Draco decided that someone needed to give Harry a hug right that moment. Ron was out of the question, swaying to the song with Pansy in his arms, too drunk to notice his best friend's suffering. Blaise did go after Harry but they had never been too close. Draco knew he himself was the best choice to console Harry anyway. He sighed and wound his way through the dancing couples. He opened the door to the Gents gingerly. Two voices carried over to him.
Potter smiled at him and Draco's stomach fluttered at the sight of Potter's magnificent smile directed at him.
Each room was as empty and filled with dust as the previous one, looking abandoned and sad. Harry wondered what had happened in there, during World War II, what kind of experiments or medical procedures had been conducted in the basement, what horrors had the patients suffered. He understood why there were so many ghosts now and even more why the house felt as dark and gloomy as it had. The walls seemed to be soaked with terror, anger, and madness, and when Harry stopped to listen, he could almost hear faint whispers coming from every direction at once. Once he had a bit more time, he would go into a library and try to find the records of this place. He knew it wouldn't change the past but for some incomprehensible reason, he needed to find out what had happened there.
"Sorry," Hermione had the decency to blush. "Sometimes it's just too much, you know? Too much stress, trying to figure this bloody Problem out. Not to mention I'm swollen like a balloon and tired all the time."
The ghosts surged toward him, faster than he'd ever seen them move. He instinctively threw a handful of salt at them, only for them to appear seconds later, advancing toward him hastily. Harry could feel hate emanating from them towards him in waves. He shuddered. The ghosts hadn't been this angry the last time he was here. What had changed since last week? He ducked again, throwing more salt in their direction, and started backing toward the staircase.
"My arms still hurt a little," he breathed against Harry's neck. "I think you will have to undress and wash me."
„I‘m going to tell him off,“ Harry suddenly jumped up and started resolutely walking across the Great Hall over to the Slytherin table.
"You should have told me. And it was awful, what else did you expect?" Harry poured all his frustration into his voice. A soft voice in the back of his mind supplied unhelpfully, that it wasn't all that bad, especially looking at Malfoy's pretty face and fit body and he squashed the thought immediately.
"Draco?" Harry whispers brokenly. When Draco doesn't move, Harry gently lifts him up and carries him over to the cot. He places him delicately on the coarse blanket and strokes Draco's face with the tips of his fingers. Harry has to fight a wave of nausea, threatening to empty his stomach. Draco stirs and blinks at him. His eyes are lost. Harry swallows and his throat hurts from it.
"Draco," Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes and held Draco even tighter. "Stop fighting me! I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing because we are both idiots!"
"Sir," Harry started again. "You know I'm right. We have to face the fact that the Problem is out there. The bust is going to take place after sunset and…"
"Good thing I'm not a civilian then," Harry tried to gulp down the rising anger. Hermione had said that Malfoy's agency was the best one there was. Harry needed to convince the stupid git of letting him tag along for just a few nights and then he would be rid of Harry for good.
"Was there any other reason you didn't tell Bellatrix?" Harry asks softly and searches Malfoy's face. He steps closer, their chests only inches apart.
The shadows around them deepened, crawling from the corners of the room toward the center, obscuring the windows and therefore the only source of faint illumination they had. Soon, they were left completely in darkness. Draco pulled a flashlight from his shoulder holster, lighting it in the process. He whirled around, surveying his surroundings quickly. Pansy followed his lead and lit her flashlight as well.
Harry laughed out loud abruptly, the happy sound a balm to Draco's soul. "You always say that to me."
"Yes, you're partners again," Robards glowered at him. "Just get out of here before I change my mind."
"You know I didn't say that, just let me explain," Harry reached out a hand toward him and laid it gently on Draco's shoulder.
Pansy was lying on the sofa in her bedroom, wrapped in the fluffy white blanket Draco had bought for her because she constantly complained about being cold without the warming charms she'd grown used to in the Hogwarts dungeons. She grudgingly appreciated the soft, comfortable warmth the blanket provided. It was Muggle, as Draco insisted mostly everything in their flats to be magic-free. There weren't many things about Muggles she appreciated but the home accessories section in Selfridges was one of the few she did.
"I try not to rely on magic too much in the day-to-day tasks. Makes it easier not to reach instinctively for a wand when surrounded by ghosts," Malfoy replied, his voice soft and honest.
Harry gained advantage minutely and rolled Draco over on his back, straddling him. He pushed Draco‘s arms over his head and pinned them there. Harry‘s erection was pressed against Draco‘s and he rolled his hips experimentally. Draco made an appreciative sound and his gaze locked with Harry‘s in a silent challenge. Harry slowly bent down and kissed Draco heatedly.
"Don't you start, you obtrusive git," Hermione snarled. "Not everything I do or say has to be caused by fucking hormones!"
Draco's eyes widened the moment he realized what Harry was saying. He started laughing hard, wheezing as he tried to breathe in, trying to imagine the scene in his mind. "Shut the fuck up! Did you throw up on him? You did, didn't you?"
"Why aren't you trying to save them? Help them! Do something! They can't be dead," Harry screamed. His heart constricted painfully. Alpha couldn't be dead, he couldn't have gone through all that just to see them die anyway. "I saved them."
Harry knew he had to act fast, the longer he stayed in the room, the higher the chance of never leaving it alive. Harry dropped the salt back inside his pocket and fumbled for the adrenaline shot he'd kept at all times in a loop at his belt. He drew it out, tore Montague's robes off his chest, and stabbed the needle directly into his heart. He patted Montague's robes and finally found the emergency portkey pinned to the lapel of his shirt. He activated it and relief surged through him. Montague was safe, he was in St Mungo's now.
"I don't want to be just another tally to you. I really like you and I don't want you to discard me like a broken toy without a second glance," Draco whimpered.
and the wand movement is following," she waved her wand in a simple gesture, an arc ending with a short flick down.
Why would Potter buy him presents? He'd accidentally overheard Potter's and Weasley's conversation during lunch the day before Potter left, not that Draco was snooping or anything. Potter clearly said that he could not work with Draco anymore. That every minute alone with him in the office was pure torture. Weasley had replied that some time away might do him some good. Why was Potter suddenly pretending to be friends again?
"Shut up, Smith," Harry said quietly, trying his best not to punch Smith in the face. His hands formed fists and he tried to unclench them.
"Auror Potter," Robards reprimanded him but his expression remained grim. "In and out, wait for the negotiator."
"I recall someone," Harry stared pointedly at Draco, "wanted me to become his man slave. I don't see a reason why you should start complaining about it now."
Harry was furious. The rage that he was feeling increased tenfold. A part of him wondered how had he gotten this angry. Deep down he knew it was because his heart had shattered. He had never been hurt this much by anyone, he was never in love as much as with Draco. What he had felt for Ginny was nothing in comparison to the feeling of Draco in his arms. Draco whispering in his ear that he loved him, that Harry was amazing, gorgeous, beautiful, and perfect. That Harry was his. Harry recalled Draco‘s sighs when Harry pushed his prick inside him. The way his arsehole tightened around Harry and Draco moaned loudly. Had he been moaning like that for someone else just hours ago?
"Status report," Robards snapped as he Apparated from the base and ran up the stairs to stand next to Harry.
"Ginny knows, which means Ron already told all the Weasleys. Now that I think of it, how many people saw you walk into my office on Monday?"
Harry made his decision. He placed his wand on the floor beside him, drew the adrenaline shot from its loop in his belt, ripped McLaggen's robes off with his other hand, and punched the needle into his heart. Harry could feel his own heartbeat in his throat, he could feel his heart pumping the blood through his veins. He looked around and saw a ghastly arm reach out for him out of the darkness. Harry threw himself on top of McLaggen's cold, rigid body. The hand missed Harry by inches and he blindly reached for his wand. At the same time, he looped his arm around McLaggen's neck and reached around to his own lapel, where his portkey was pinned. He activated it and felt the familiar tug in his midsection taking him away to safety.
"Get the fuck out," Draco hissed and tried to push Harry away. "I knew you didn't give a shit about people you fucked but laughing at me right now is a bit too cruel, don't you think? Just get the fuck out!"
"Would you rather talk about it in the office?" Draco asked mock-politely and batted his eyelashes for a good measure. He knew he was acting silly but he couldn't think of any other way to stop his mind drifting toward dreadful thoughts. Like Harry being dead. Like an alternate universe where he wouldn't be able to drink tea with Harry right now, close enough to touch him if he wasn't afraid to spoil the fragile relationship that was blooming between them.
"He's not breathing, there must be internal damage," the medi-wizard reported and drew a Portkey out of his green robes. "We have to risk transporting him now or we'll lose him!"
"It's urgent, do it now. I mean it, Pansy," Draco shouted over his shoulder and slammed the door for a good measure.
Draco lay on his back and opened his arms in invitation. Harry pouted but folded himself against Draco obediently, resting his head in the crook of Draco‘s neck, tangling their legs together.
"Draco, where are you going? It's not like that, not really. Yes, I fucked up but I've been trying to talk to you about it since yesterday! If only you'd let me explain," Harry begged him.
They took their time, petting each other, enjoying the comfort of their wet, soaped-up skin sliding against each other while they kissed softly. The second orgasm was less but more intense at the same time. Before, it had been an explosion, a pure need for release. Now, their climax was full of love and reassurance that they were both there, safe in each other's arms. That they would handle whatever the world threw at them together.
"I…," Hermione trailed off. "I have an idea but I don't want to talk about it until I'm sure it's going to work."
„Eighteen degrees at the base of the staircase,“ Harry noted in a hushed tone. He felt as if talking out loud could draw the ghost’s awareness to their presence.
"Shhh, it's going to be OK, everything's going to be alright, I promise," Harry kissed her temple and prayed it wasn't a lie.
Under his cloak, Harry‘s breath quickened, his heart began beating faster. Jealousy speared through him, sharp pain twisting around his heart.
Draco shifted uncomfortably and patted her shoulder, hoping she would let go of him. Even though he decided to help her, it didn't mean they were suddenly the best of friends. He couldn't help but grimace as he gently pried her off.
Harry ignored the quip. "I love those two morons. Don't you? Come on, I'll get you something better."
"Shhh, why are you crying, Draco? What is it? Please tell me," when Harry saw the anguish in Draco's eyes, he couldn't restrain himself any longer. He wrapped Draco in his arms and buried his face in his hair. Draco was perfect in his arms and Harry never wanted to touch anyone else.
Harry flushed slightly as those words evoked a rather pleasant image in his mind. Draco shackled to their bed, writhing in pleasure with Harry's prick buried deep in his arse.
"Draco has just gone to the Atrium. I think this is it. We had lunch together and he didn't mention leaving the Ministry early. We were supposed to meet at home, as usual. He said he was going to leave around 4 PM by Floo," Harry related the details as fast as he could.
„When I‘m with you,“ Draco inhaled deeply and carried on rather bravely. Maybe some of the Gryffindor characteristics were rubbing off on him, he thought to himself. „When I‘m with you it‘s like the whole world around me is lit up with a thousand suns. When you're not around, all I can think of is when I will get to see you again. I can‘t imagine not having you in my life. I don‘t think I could have a life you‘re not part of,“ he whispered. Draco suddenly felt as if he‘d said more than he wanted to, but the look in Harry‘s eyes of pure love was worth it.
Harry took a few hesitant steps toward the room where Alpha had died. In the back of his mind, a nagging voice told him to get out while he still could. He didn't have to do this alone and Hermione would skin him alive if she knew Harry returned to the mansion on his own. They could certainly find some other ghost hunters. Anyone but Malfoy. Harry pushed another, more disturbing thought down, into the deep recess of his mind
"Great!" Harry's heart started beating faster. Finally, he would be able to get out and help. Maybe they would get closer to solving the Problem and preventing more innocent lives from being lost.
"Whatever you need to believe, darling. I'll leave you to your important stuff with Potter then," she winked at him, the cow, and disappeared in the reception area. Even the way her heels clicked against the wooden floor sounded sassy to Draco's ears.
Draco pulled away and looked down at his friends. Pansy and Hermione were squealing and hugging. Blaise whistled. Seamus's catcalls were so dirty Draco immediately wanted to rinse out his ears. Luna and Theo were clapping and smiling. The rest of the party-goers were cheering.
"Granger, thank you for accepting me on such short notice," Draco said as he sat down on the sofa in Granger's office. The room was modest and professional, exactly what Draco had imagined a healer's office would look like. The walls were white, as were the tiles on the floor. The furniture and sofa had a grey hue to them and were of simple design. The walls were decorated with diplomas and posters describing in detail various body parts such as leg muscles, individual bones in a hand, and what eyes were made of. There was a glass cabinet alongside one of the walls, holding miscellaneous healing potions.
Draco took another step and immediately cursed. "Fuck!" He jumped back, shivering. His teeth chattered loudly.
„Reciprocate?“ Draco lifted an eyebrow. „I didn‘t know that word was part of your vocabulary, Potter.“
Draco should have probably called before he stumbled in through Harry's fireplace unannounced. He dusted himself off and looked around gingerly. He was standing in a drawing-room of sorts, or a library, he couldn't tell. He didn't pay much attention to his surroundings, however. His gaze was fixed on the sofa in front of him. Harry was lying there, sprawled on his back, one leg bent at the knee. He was dressed in grey joggers and Draco's favourite white shirt. The shirt was left unbuttoned, leaving Harry's chest bare. The sight made Draco's breath catch and heat pool in his stomach. He ran his eyes across the chiseled-out abdominal muscles, the soft-looking skin, the perfect nipples that begged to be teased with tongue and teeth. Harry's head was resting in the crook of his arm, his face turned toward the fireplace. Reflection of the flames danced across his features and Draco took his time to admire the strong, square jawline and masculine bone structure. Harry looked so beautiful in his sleep that Draco wanted to freeze this moment and dwell in it forever. His breathing quickened and Draco knew Pansy was right. He would always want Harry no matter what.
"I know how to question a witness," Potter scoffed, effectively breaking the strange tension that had formed between them after their almost-kiss.
To Draco's horror or pleasure, he couldn't quite decide, Potter had copied the Malfoy smirk masterfully. Potter poked him again.
Harry tried to recall all the details that had been said during their briefing earlier that day. The only recorded violent death inside the house was the suicide of Mrs. Emsworth’s mother. She’d suffered from depressions and one night, she hung herself from a beam in the attic. Her daughter found her in the morning when she left her bedroom to make breakfast and found the attic staircase pulled down from its place in the ceiling.
I need to get better for myself so that I can be better for you. You deserve the best and I hope one day I can be good enough.
„I honestly didn‘t realize. It all clicked into place today, after you...“ Draco left the rest of the sentence unsaid.
"Let me try something else," Draco murmured against Harry's mouth. He rubbed his cheek against Harry's jaw and inhaled his scent. He sighed contentedly, the smell of Harry igniting something in his chest, sending a spark into his groin. Draco bit along Harry's neck and when his lips reached the place where Harry's neck met his shoulder, he bit down instinctively. He knew, before it happened, that Harry would melt into his touch. He knew Harry's knees would give way and Draco caught him reflexively in his arms as he stumbled.
"Am I what?" Draco asked, confused. He shook his head, trying to clear it. They were on their fifth pint and the three shots of Firewhiskey in between definitely didn't help him think straight.
Draco ran up the stairs in a frenzy, his long black coat flapping behind him effusively. Stupid Potter, what was he doing here? How could he have entered the mansion alone, of his own volition, when all Draco could feel was hate, pain, and fear seeping from every wall of the house. Only a raving lunatic would come here alone at night.
Draco cleared his throat. "Primarily, we try to banish the ghosts peacefully, not using violence. Upon entry, we set up our protective circle in case we need to retreat. Iron chains are the safest and work the best. In case of need, iron filings can save your life but you have to be careful not to disrupt the line when you run back into the circle. Some ghosts, well, most of them anyway, attack you once you get near their Source. By the way, never touch a Source with your bare hands. The effect would be the same as touching a ghost directly. That's what this is for."
"Don't you ever compare me to that fucker again," Harry hissed. It cut him deeply that Draco could even consider comparing him to Smith. He had to show Draco he cared about him. "I meant it, you can talk to me. I swear anything you say will stay between us."
Draco had to admit that sharing an office with Potter could be slightly torturous. Especially on the slow days, when Potter hung his robes on a peg next to the door and walked around only in his white shirt and black trousers, both hugging his body tightly, not leaving much to the imagination. And then there were the braces. Black ones. He always wore a self-satisfied smirk on his face when he caught Draco staring at him for a little bit longer than strictly necessary.
"Take Cold Maiden, for example. They radiate powerful feelings of melancholy and malaise, but they rarely draw close to the living. We've only encountered one or two on our cases so far. Another one would be a Grey Haze. Those manifest as shapeless patches of faintly glinting mist. We don't know why but even if you walk directly through a Grey Haze, you can't get ghost-touched by them. It must have something to do with the ectoplasm, most possibly it being spread over such a wide area. It must be less concentrated, at least that's my theory. In all honesty, I haven't had a chance to investigate it in detail yet but maybe Granger can help us there?"
"Minister Shacklebolt, Head Auror Robards, "Narcissa's formal tone of voice greeted them in the parlour of the Manor. "It is a pleasure you could join us."
"I would like to hire you," Harry shrugged uncomfortably. Not in a million years would he have thought that one day he would come to ask Malfoy for help.
"Right, go then. I don't want to keep you from going out to pull some other idiot so you can have your weekly fuck," Draco spat.
Pansy collected herself first, crossed the room, and threw her arms around Draco with a squeal. „Draco, darling! Finally! After years of worthless pining after Potter, you finally got his arse! I‘m so happy for you! Is his bum as amazing as you‘d imagined?“
Draco considered it. He trusted Potter with his life in the field. Why not trust him with his heart away from the field? He knew it was a bad idea, to confide in Potter of all people, but he was so tired of bottling up all his feelings. His whole being was longing to relieve some of the suppressed pain he'd been hiding for years.
Harry smiled into his lips. "Come on then." He grabbed Draco's hand, intertwined their fingers, and led him up the stairs.
Harry didn't wait for an answer and stalked out of Robards's office. He knew he was pushing his luck but he couldn't help it. He would do anything to protect Draco and the fewer people knew about what was happening, the better.
"Of course not, don't be ridiculous, Potter. I am worried about the reputation of my agency," Malfoy's body tensed, his tone mocking.
Two hours later, Harry‘s feet were hurting from having to stand still. His back itched but he didn‘t dare scratch himself as the sound would surely attract Draco‘s attention.
Malfoy recoiled from him. "What? No way, we're not doing that! I'm not taking you to cast a spell in the middle of a ghost-infected area. It's too dangerous."
„Piss off, Malfoy!“ Harry hissed. „I wish I could get some alone time with you and punch you in the face.“
Harry kneeled in the bathtub, the water coming just under the curve of his buttocks. Draco's eyes were roaming Harry's body. Harry knew he must have looked sexy as hell, dripping with water, the foam slowly gliding down his skin. He slid a hand into his hair and threw his head back. He traced his hand lower, ever so slowly, moaning and groaning, as we gave Draco the show he deserved. He allowed his fingers to trace the skin across his chest and he pinched his nipple. He heard Draco inhale sharply and knew he was doing a good job.
"That brings me to our next steps," Hermione nodded. "First, we need to get samples of ectoplasm. I would like at least three samples, each from a different ghost and from a different manifestation point. Of course, ectoplasm is not safe to touch with bare hands, it would kill you. I think I found a solution for that. I will try to tweak the spell we use at the hospital for collecting blood samples and moving them around the lab without contaminating them. I think the spell could be modified to extract the ectoplasm from a ghost and move it into a vial. Just like when you extract your memory into a Pensieve. I'm sure I can fine-tune the spell within a few days."
He pressed his palm against Draco's cheek gently and lifted up his face so that their eyes met. "You're so much more. Come on, I need to show you something."
Draco pounced at him and started ravaging his mouth. They both tore at the clothes they were still wearing. Harry grabbed Draco's shirt and ripped it apart hungrily, buttons flying everywhere, while Draco divested Harry of the joggers and shirt. Their kiss turned sloppy and wet, their tongues thrusting against each other, teeth biting and nipping at the lips. Draco pulled back, breathing hard.
“I’m taking the left, you take the right,” Harry said. He pressed his back tightly against the wall and looked at Draco for confirmation.
„How many times do I have to tell them that any changes in potion recipes need to be tested safely in a laboratory environment before trying them on living subjects?“ Draco ranted. „Who knows what would have happened, had the healers from St Mungo‘s not contacted us on time.“
Harry plastered his chest against Draco‘s, reveling in the sensation of skin on skin, letting his hands roam across Draco‘s spine and tangle them in his hair, all the while kissing Draco passionately. He felt his trousers and pants being pushed down his thighs and he kicked them off without breaking the kiss.
Draco sniffed. "Who do you think I am? The Weasel? I'm not an oblivious fool! I'm sharp-witted, unlike him! He didn't even notice something was bothering you tonight. Don't you worry, I'll figure it out swiftly."
Harry let Draco lay his head in the crook of his neck and encircled him in his arms tenderly. The feel of Harry's body against his own and the scent of Harry‘s perfume mixed with a hint of his sweat helped Draco relieve some of the tension he was feeling. He snuggled closer to Harry, who started pressing thousands of tiny soft kisses into his hair. They stayed like that for what felt like an eternity.
"I'm afraid not. There are already prior cases we are obliged to follow through. Surely you understand," Draco apologized.
Mr. Gladstone stiffened. "What does such a question has to do with anything? Are you trying to accuse me or my wife of some awful crime?" he barked out.
Harry left Hermione's office and hastily crossed the St Mungo's Spell Damage floor to the closest Floo. He didn't look left or right, he couldn't stand being in this corridor for longer than strictly necessary. Not after what had happened to Ron. He didn't know how Hermione did it, coming to work every day, knowing that… Harry stopped that trail of thoughts immediately. He couldn't think of it, not yet, anyway.
Draco watched Harry as he walked stiffly across the dance floor and disappeared in the corridor leading to the Gents. Blaise and Hermione cast a worried glance at his retreating back. Blaise shook his head in exasperation. He said something to Hermione and followed Harry to the toilet.
"If you insist. Now tell me, is it possible that Potter simply decided to wander around town, hoping to stumble upon a ghost a find a Source? With his unbelievable luck, I wouldn't be surprised if he'd actually managed to do just that."
"Then why are you doing it?" Draco was confused again. "And besides, I thought you wanted to show me something?"
"I want you inside me," Potter grabbed Draco's other hand and started pulling him towards the bedroom. It was a bit awkward as Draco wouldn't let go of Potter's cock. He'd spent endless nights imagining what it would be like to have Potter's prick in the palm of his hand, in his mouth, in his arsehole, and now that he was holding it, he would not let go easily.
"You see, that's where it gets complicated," Malfoy exhaled. "I didn't mean permanently as in PERMANENTLY. I meant permanently until Potter returns from Chicago."
„What is it?“ Harry asked. Fear coiled in his stomach in anticipation. Surely this had nothing to do with Draco and his strange behaviour lately.
"Apparating drunk, Malfoy," Harry snickered and closed the distance between them. Draco was so beautiful up close. His porcelain skin was unblemished, perfect. His eyelashes, nearly invisible from distance, were long and curled up to his brows. His lips were plump and soft and begging to be kissed.
"I'm sorry, I'm such a moron. I didn't mean to bring him up," Harry whispered and gently wrapped his hand around Hermione's.
"Pretty, pretty please," Potter moved closer to Draco and blinked those ridiculously long eyelashes several times.
Harry huffed. "You're right, I'll do my best." He set the picture frame back onto Draco's desk. "Anyway, I have to be going now. I'll see you at lunch."
"Exactly," Draco confirmed. "We usually observe the ghosts first before taking any action to learn the patterns of their movement. We try not to engage them or make them agitated. Hence the no magic rule. All the equipment I'm going to show you now is for emergency use only. First, there are the salt bombs. Just aim it at a ghost, throw it, and poof, the ghost's gone. Some until the next night, some only for a brief moment. The next one is a magnesium flare, which I think you have been acquainted with rather in detail."
Draco didn't reply, he didn't want his voice to betray the state of mind he was in, wallowing in self-pity.
Harry found himself back in the foyer and let his gaze flick between two very different staircases. One, leading to the cellar, dark and barely visible from where he was standing. The other, leading upstairs, toward
"Yes?" Harry replies. He's barely able to speak, his throat hurts from crying and he can barely swallow.
„You‘re such a pervert, Potter,“ Draco tried to give him a disgusted look but couldn‘t quite manage it.
"I heard the ghost whistle something but I couldn't distinguish the melody properly," Harry said into the silence.
Harry turned around, grabbed Smith furiously by the collar of his shirt, and nearly lifted him off his feet. Harry's face was inches from Smith's. "Don't get smart with me right now," Harry growled.
"Well, I guess I'm going to see Robards about my new partner then," Harry broke the silence and started for the door sullenly. He stopped in the doorway and turned around. He fished something out of his pocket and unshrunk it. It was a huge plastic bag packed with stuff. Harry handed it to Malfoy. "I got you something, by the way."
Draco followed Harry, excitement building in his chest. Harry's joggers were loose on him and Draco couldn't see much of his body underneath them but he couldn't wait to see Harry naked. He wanted to run his tongue across the planes of Harry's chest, bite and mark the soft skin of his neck. He wanted to unwrap Harry like a present and run his fingers over every bit of him.
Hermione dropped the quill on her work desk in frustration and sighed heavily. She'd been staring at the diagnostic chart for hours but couldn't figure out how to bring Patient X out of the stasis-induced coma. The patient had been lying in the Spell Damage ward for over two months now and neither she nor the other healers had been able to find a cure to his condition. He'd been ghost-touched and would have died if not for his friend's quick thinking who threw a stasis charm on his dying body.
"You're going to be the death of me, Harry," Draco smiled at him and patted his cheek affectionately.
Both of them cast the spell at once and sneaked through the door into the looming darkness of the warehouse. They stopped shorty to adjust their eyes to the dimness and found themselves in a large hall, two stories high. The ceiling was supported by thick metal beams and pillars, anchored in the bare cement floor. Harry's breath quickened as he took in the single metal chair placed in the middle of the large space. Draco was tied to the chair, his back to the entrance. Harry could see ropes cutting and chaffing the soft skin of Draco's wrists. He forced himself to stay still, even though his whole body was trembling with the need to free Draco and Apparate him to safety.
"I… I don't know what to say to that," Harry's mind went blank for a second. He hadn't expected that answer, not really.
Draco didn't say anything and Harry felt the finger withdraw. Instead, something larger, silkier pushed against his opening. Draco let go of his wrists and Harry felt, rather than saw Draco prop himself up above Harry in a version of a plank position. Draco pushed inside Harry in one swift motion, eliciting a harsh scream out of Harry's throat. Draco's prick was as deep as it would go, resting inside Harry's most intimate part.
"You're going to sing?" Draco's eyebrows shot up and disappeared under his fringe. "You hate giving speeches in public. I guess I presumed you would hate singing too."
"I do. I despise having to speak or sing in front of other people. This is basically a nightmare for me," Harry admitted nervously.
"You are quite welcome, Mr. Gladstone," Draco smiled reassuringly at the client. "Please tell us, how may we be of assistance? My secretary informed me you own a Bed & Breakfast in Scotland and that you've been having trouble with your property?"
spell, which will ensure the transfer of the physical substance into a vial. The third spell I weaved in is the one we use at the hospital for collecting blood samples and moving them around the lab without contaminating them. That will ensure the transfer of pure, untainted ectoplasm. The incantation is
"You are such an irresponsible fucker. I'm going to kick your arse," Malfoy towered above Harry, his eyes flashing dangerously with anger. "Why would you go in there alone, especially if you knew how dangerous it was? After two people died in there! What were you expecting to achieve by your little stunt?"
„When are you going to get it through that thick skull of yours, Potter? You‘re not getting rid of me any time soon,“ Draco replied in a mock-serious tone, sticking out his chin arrogantly.
„Get the fuck out,“ Harry shouted again. He grabbed Draco‘s book that was lying on a coffee table and threw it into the fireplace.
"Except," Harry interrupted him. "You arrived after me. It must have been after six and you were confused when I told you you were late. You genuinely thought you were coming home at your usual time."
Draco writhed under him, growling and gasping and cursing. Harry reached around Draco, grabbed his hard prick, and started jerking him off in time with his fucking. The risk of being caught at any moment was bloody arousing.
Harry steeled himself and asked the question that had been nagging at him for the whole day. "Are you then?"
Draco blushed. It seemed everyone but him had known all along that Harry wanted him. He coughed nervously and pulled the microphone out of Harry's hand. "I just wanted to say that Blaise was right. I'm a plonker."
"Oh," Harry couldn't think of anything else to say. He opened his eyes only to startle when he noticed how close Malfoy had leaned in.
„Yes, better. But Draco?“ Harry tried to pull Draco away to look him in the eyes but Draco didn‘t let him. Harry‘s throat was just too delicious. The taste of his skin on Draco‘s tongue was divine and he wasn‘t ready to part with it just yet.
"Oh, I didn't know he would do that," Harry faked a surprise. "I had an argument with him about one of our cases yesterday and I guess it didn't sit too well with him. But I never expected he would assign us desk jobs for a whole week. I'm sorry Ron."
. Harry couldn't decide where to go first but he knew that eventually, he would have to venture into both rooms. He stood in the foyer for what felt like countless minutes. He wasn't able to decide where to start. In the end, he realized he was only losing the precious daylight and decided to face his biggest fear first. He exhaled, his breath shuddering and too loud in the empty hallway, and started climbing up.
„Sure. Can you ask Kreacher to make dinner? If I do that, he‘ll burn it out of spite,“ Harry grumbled.
Harry breathed out. He stomped a few times, relieved he could finally move, and contentedly scratched his itching back. He was torn between following Draco and going back to his desk and the actual work he was supposed to be doing. Following Draco was such a bad idea and surely, the letter was work-related. But who Incendioed work letters? Curiosity and intuition won out and Harry silently snuck out of the office, barely catching the sight of Draco‘s platinum blond hair disappearing around the corner of the corridor leading to the lifts and stairs to the Atrium.
"It used to be a Muggle institution at one point, an asylum," Potter mused, biting the inside of his cheek thoughtfully. "I fear they were experimenting on people. They performed lobotomy and some other horrid medical procedures on the patients. At least, the tools I saw in the cellar suggest that. Believe me, it must have been horrid, being administered there. I think if I…"
Harry was sitting on the back porch, his knees drawn tightly against his chest. He was gazing at the stars, lost in thought. He was shivering with cold but he didn't have the strength to cast a warming charm. He'd poured out his heart and soul into that letter and he could only hope Draco would understand.
"Dracoooo," Potter cried out and came all over Draco's hand, his arse tightening around Draco's cock maddeningly. Draco gasped and shot a hot load of come inside Potter.
They crossed the Atrium purposefully. As they neared the Apparition point, Robards stopped Harry once more with a hand on his shoulder.
"Well, I didn't know magic attracted ghosts and…" Harry trailed off when he noticed Malfoy's disbelieving expression. "What?"
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and willed himself to calm down. Then, he threw the powder into the blazing fire and stepped through the flames.
you might be surprised to find this letter. Well, you shouldn't be. You know I'm bollocks at speeches. I'm bollocks at many things but speeches and talking about my feelings are among the ones I'm really shit at. I wanted to explain why I reacted the way I did and I know I would never be able to do so properly face to face. I would never be able to get out the words that would make the most sense (and not piss you off in the process). Hence the letter.
"Hermione, Ron wouldn't have wanted…" Harry wrapped her hand gently in his, partially to prevent any more stabbing.
"A word of advice, Ronnie-kins," Draco barely avoided the napkin Ron threw at him. "You should select a new team to support. The orange of the Cannons' merchandise clashes horribly with your hair."
Draco sat down behind his office desk tiredly. He couldn't stand a minute longer in the void of his flat. He couldn't bear walking mindlessly through those empty rooms, wondering if he and Potter… Harry had ever made love in them, and what it must have been like to hold Harry in his arms. Had they laughed together or did they fight all the time? What had it been like, to run his fingers across the soft-looking skin, to kiss those rosy lips? Draco was slowly driving himself mad. He wanted to remember. He wanted nothing more than to remember his first date with Harry, the first time they'd kissed, the first time they'd made love. But it was all gone. Forever.
"Say yes, Harry," Draco bit Harry's jawline. "Pretty, pretty please." He accentuated every word with another bite and lick along Harry's jaw. The last time they had sex was in Harry's office when Harry had bent Draco over his desk and fucked him senseless. Draco was mad with want, he needed Harry inside him ever since he woke up in the hospital.
"Let's go to bed, Harry. I still want you inside me. Don't think you're through with me yet," Draco sighed contentedly once he recovered enough to speak.
„You won‘t,“ Harry tore his gaze from Draco‘s arse and looked him straight in the eye. His expression was so sincere and full of conviction that the dark tendril of fear residing permanently in Draco‘s chest unwound and dispersed like a mist in the morning sun.
Harry's eyes gleamed with delight and he nodded several times. He couldn't wait. Already, half an hour into officially working with a ghost-hunting agency, he loved the job more than he ever did being an Auror. Maybe, if Malfoy agreed, he would hire Harry as a regular employee. If Harry was honest with himself, he would quit his Auror position and join Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. in an instant if it meant saving more people that way. Then there was the added bonus of seeing Malfoy every day. When Malfoy left the room, Harry got back to his assigned reading material.
"That's not…," Hary stuttered. Why was he always so bad with words? He wanted to show Draco how much he cared about him, yet Draco obviously understood Harry wanted to have sex with him. "Look, Malfoy, we all have our issues. You said there was never anyone special who would want you because of your past. Well, surprise! Everyone I ever slept with wanted me just because I'm the bloody Saviour. Even Ginny dated me because I was fucking Harry Potter. You never had sex because no one sees the person you are underneath that tattoo. Well, I sleep around because no one sees me for who I am either."
"I don't care, Robards," Harry slammed his fist on his superior's desk. "I want to be partnered with Malfoy or I'm leaving the force."
"Auror Potter, I am sorry but I cannot endorse such behaviour. We need to follow protocol," Kingsley insisted.
"I can ask her in the evening when I get home. By the way, she said she's really close to figuring out the spell to extract the ectoplasm. A few more days at most and we should be ready to test it in the field," Harry said.
"Let me get this straight," Potter stood up, his eyes shining bright again. "So you enter the house, check the temperature in the rooms, and determine which ones are safe and which are the ones where the ghosts will most likely appear."
"Piss off, Potter," Malfoy stood up and stretched his arms above his head. Harry's eyes followed the movement avidly, soaking in every detail. The way Malfoy's white shirt stretched across his taut stomach, the way his body shivered with the stretch, how his eyes fluttered shut.
„It was in the fourth year, when Draco here, I‘ve never thanked you properly for that by the way, hexed my teeth,“ Hermione smiled at Draco.
"Did you figure it out? Is it ready? Can we try it out?" Harry almost tripped in his rush to Hermione's side.
The second medi-wizard, around fifty years old, with dark hair shot through with silver, directed his question to Draco. „Any other symptoms, Mr.?“ he subtly asked for Draco‘s name.
„Mate, I‘ll bet you a Galleon that you can‘t make it one day without Malfoy,“ Ron taunted him. „No talking about him, no observing him, no stalking him, is that clear?“
Draco slowly opened the door, wincing when the hinges creaked. The cold seeped into him when he stepped over the threshold. He immediately knew there was a presence in the room, even without the temperature drop. He felt the small hairs on the back of his neck rise with trepidation. He shook the feeling off and looked around the room. The bed was lit up by a faint, otherworldly, greenish light.
Harry circles Draco's rim with his thumb, observing Draco's face cautiously. He keeps the movement steady, slow, and loving. He runs his free hand over Draco's flank and kisses his inner thigh softly. The expression on Draco's face slowly melts from fear to trust. Harry ever so slowly eases a finger inside Draco's hole. Draco shudders but not from pain. He's still loose from before but Harry doesn't want to think about that. He eases a second finger in and moves in and out, keeping the steady rhythm from before. He finds Draco's prostate and runs the tips of his fingers over it repeatedly. Draco's spine bows and Harry can't stop drinking in the sight of the beautiful boy in front of him, he wants to sear it into his memory forever.
„Don‘t worry about them. Pansy knows I‘ve had a crush on you since the fifth year,“ Draco smirked at Harry.
"Don't you ever compare me to that fucker again," Potter spat out. Then his voice softened. "I meant it, you can talk to me. I swear anything you say will stay between us."
"I'll take you down to my paradise, Harry, I promise," Draco whispered when they pulled away for air.
"You killed my beloved Nagini, you destroyed my painstakingly created Horcruxes. No wand will save you now. I'm going to destroy you once and for all, Harry Potter. Avada Kedavra!" Voldemort shouts spitefully.
He could feel the chill in the air brushing against his skin. It was as if someone slowly traced invisible fingers from his lower back up all the way up into his hair. He tried to shake the feeling off. He walked toward the place they'd first seen the apparition. He was nearly under the beam now, scanning the area for clues to the Source location.
„That‘s just as well,“ Draco said and launched himself at Harry. He kissed him wildly, climbing into Harry‘s lap.
Instead of answering, Draco leaned in and kissed Harry. He let his tongue slip inside Harry's willing mouth. The kiss was slow, gentle, and loving. It was everything Draco could ever dream of.
„Right, you‘re not feeling well. Yet you stayed out till eleven? Are you fucking serious right now?“ Harry asked furiously, trying hard not to shout. There goes being calm, the surpressed rational part of his mind supplied.
"Please Harry. I will be dead in a few hours. I've never… I want to know what it's like when it's with someone... I want you to be the last person who touches me," his voice breaks, his body starts to tremble again.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked, surprised that his voice sounded a little breathy. What was wrong with him?
Harry stopped abruptly. There were footprints in the dust on the dark wooden floor. He crouched next to them and examined them carefully. Davis was standing in the doorway, blocking most of the light. Harry signaled and she walked over to him, her eyes intent on their surroundings, guarding their position. In the past two months they'd been partnered, they learned to read each other's movements and Harry had been happy to realize they were finally working as a team. He still missed Ron terribly but Tracey was a good Auror.
„Accio Draco‘s fancy face oil,“ Harry wandlessly summoned Draco‘s herb-scented cosmetics. He unscrewed the lid and poured a few drops of the oil into his palm. He closed the flask and placed it on the nightstand. Then he rubbed his palms together, distributing the oil evenly and heating it up in the process. Harry began massaging Draco‘s forehead, starting at the bridge of his nose, moving above his eyebrows to his temples. Draco‘s eyes fluttered closed and he purred softly. Harry repeated the movement several times, then moved lower. From the bridge of the nose, under his eyes, ending on the temples again. After several minutes of repeating the set of motions, Harry placed both of his palms under Draco‘s chin. He traced his palms along Draco‘s jawline, pulling the skin gently toward his ears. His fingers tickled Draco‘s neck. The skin there erupted in goosebumps.
"Yes, he did at that!" Ron nodded vehemently. "And then he said I was spoiling his thing, the important thing that he'd been planning for a month."
Harry spelled both of them clean and quickly fastened his trousers back in place, then helped Draco dress too. Draco turned around and Harry‘s heart gave an almost painful pang. Draco was so beautiful, red cheeks, his fringe stuck to his forehead with sweat, pupils dilated. Harry backed Draco to the desk. He pushed his thighs between Draco‘s and hugged him close. They were both still panting from the exertion. Harry breathed Draco in deeply, the smell of his skin, the sweat, the sex, and his perfume felt like home. Draco sighed contentedly and snuggled close to Harry.
"Mr. Malfoy," Robards coughed politely after swallowing the first bite of the fish. "What can you tell us about last week? Any small detail you might find insignificant could prove useful."
"Do you like him then, for real?" Hermione asked after a while, breaking the silence that had settled over them.
"As if you could ever manage to get close enough to bite me," Draco scoffed in a challenge and jumped behind a chair, keeping it as an obstacle between them. Potter laughed merrily and tried wrestling the chair from Draco. Draco feigned a movement to the left but sprang to the right. However, Potter was fast, his Quidditch-honed reflexes as incredible as ever. He tackled Draco, landing in a heap on top of him on a sofa. Potter's leg was tangled between Draco's thighs and his elbow was painfully digging into Draco's solar plexus. Draco huffed and tried to push him off but Potter held himself in place above him.
Harry stared at Malfoy incredulously. Suddenly, he was assaulted with an image of younger Malfoy, the one he remembered from school. His sneer was ugly, his face twisted in an angry grimace. His eyes gleamed dangerously in a silent challenge as if daring Harry to say more. He was furious and his stance changed almost imperceptibly as if he was readying himself for a fight. Something else flickered through his eyes and Harry drew in a sharp breath when he immediately understood what emotion Malfoy was trying to hide under all that outrage. It made Harry want to punch himself for causing it. Hurt. Malfoy was hurt by Harry's words and he was putting up a protective facade of anger, hiding his true feelings behind it. Shutting Harry out.
"Tosser," Harry grinned at him, inwardly pleased with how well Draco could read his moods. Harry grabbed the picture frame from the desk and snorted as the picture-Harry ruffled Draco's blond locks.
"I would rather not parade Draco around the Headquarters. Not while I still have a say in it," Harry reasoned. "I would prefer if you stopped by in the evening. We're having dinner over at the Malfoy Manor tonight. You're welcome to join us at seven."
„Is deranged Master Harry breaking things again for a reason?“ Kreacher appeared in the room with a loud pop.
"Harry I know you are trying to protect me. And I know you are still feeling guilty and it influences your actions and decisions. But this is my life, you have to let me live it," Draco whispered against the soft skin, just under Harry's ear.
„Yes, well,“ Draco waved her off. „Brook, remind me I need to talk to someone from Magical Law about my proposal on the misuse of potion ingredients. There should be hefty fines on this. People come up with crazy ideas, just to reduce the costs of a potion.“
"Falcon, I found footprints in the back foyer, my estimation is at least three months old," Harry reported to Robards through the Listening Spell.
, he corrected himself. From the wooden floor and the vintage metal filing cabinets, to the carved wooden chairs and the dark-haired secretary, who was turned sideways from Harry filing her nails, the reception couldn't be any more cliche. A lit cigarette was placed in a glass ashtray, the smoke trailing from it in a thin stripe toward the ceiling. The secretary ignored him completely, studiously examining her cuticles.
"Not for a lack of trying, I assure you," Harry laughed out loud. "You gave up after two months, my hair is just impossible."
"I saw you at the bar yesterday," Smith said slyly. "It seemed you were having a good time, groping the bloke. I was worried you would choke him with your tongue for a bit there. Had a good fuck?"
They both staggered toward the stairs and Tracey started up first. The skin on Harry's back bristled with goosebumps. He felt the ghosts close behind him, reaching for him. He kept imagining their cold fingers would grab his ankles any second now. He shuddered and urged Tracey to run faster. Harry blindly threw another handful of salt across his shoulder, hoping to dissuade the ghosts from following them up. Finally, they reached the door to the foyer and slammed it shut behind them. Both Harry and Tracey were breathing hard. Harry felt cold sweat running down his temple.
"Don't you worry, Mrs. Emsworth. You'll find your house ghost-free and I'll return it undamaged in the morning," Draco nodded.
"I fucking know how a flashlight works," Potter spluttered. "Are you daft? I want to know what we need a flashlight for!"
Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously. He didn't like Hermione's innocent look one bit. Understanding dawned on him. "You knew!"
"I'm sorry?" Harry tried, even though he hadn't actually heard a word of what Malfoy had said to him in the past five minutes.
"Clear us the way to the chains with salt bombs," Draco cried out and renewed his attack with vigour. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that Pansy wasn't moving. She seemed frozen in place. Her eyes were wide, chin wobbling, her hands trembling.
"Bathe with me," Draco breathed against Harry's lips. He licked Harry's earlobe and bit it gently. Then, without warning, he thrust his tongue inside Harry's ear. Harry's knees buckled and he had to reach out a hand to support himself against a wall to stay upright.
Draco thought about it. He knew there was a reason why they hadn't been able to extract the ectoplasm into the vial. He almost had it, almost realized why but the reason slipped his mind evasively.
"Please send the next client in, Ms. Parkinson," a familiar voice rang from inside one of the offices.
Harry could see that Draco was lying, pretending that he couldn't care less. Harry knew, however, by the slight downward turn of Draco's mouth and his stiff shoulders, that Draco did care about what people thought of him. Harry refrained from commenting on it, knowing their relationship didn't run that deep yet. He realized he loved getting to know Draco better and every day he spent with him, he liked the person he'd become more and more. He hoped Draco would open up to him soon and let Harry see the insecurities and pain he was hiding from the world.
"We've covered the flashlight sufficiently, I believe," Draco smirked. "Now on to the thermometer. You might have noticed that whenever you approach a manifestation site, the air gets colder around it. When the temperature drops down to four degrees, you're basically standing knee-deep in a ghost. That's why we always map the temperature inside the house first. Of course, it only works at night, when the ghosts come out. However, you can discover the manifestation point that way, before the particular ghost rises. Some of them, usually the weaker ones, are stuck in an endless loop, replaying the last moments of their lives. Some only appear once per night, at midnight or at the exact time of their death."
„You seem very stressed, Mr. Malfoy. If you‘d like, I could help you relieve the stress,“ she batted her eyelashes at Draco.
Harry let go of Draco regretfully. All he wanted was to Apparate back to Grimmauld Place and go back to bed with Draco in his arms.
„Of course, Harry. We love you and if Draco makes you happy,“ Hermione trailed off but managed a weak smile in Draco‘s direction. She seemed to steel herself, then took a step forward and offered Draco her hand resolutely. „I think we should start all over again. If Harry can put the past behind him, so can we.“
Potter captured his lips in a bruising kiss. Draco melted against him and allowed Potter to explore every nook of his mouth with his tongue. Draco groaned and slid his hand into Potter's hair, the other running along his jaw, caressing the stubble growing there. Potter pulled at his hips, pressing their erections together.
„Yes, Potter,“ Malfoy quirked an eyebrow at him. He speared a piece of treacle tart and twirled the fork in his fingers. He slowly licked his lips and gently placed the tart in his mouth. He closed his lips around the fork and pulled the tart off of it with deliberate slowness.
"Not a chance, Malfoy. You're not getting rid of me any time soon," Harry said overly sweetly, secretly pleased with the fact it was true. He was going to spend at least a few weeks with Draco.
Suddenly, a hand pulled Draco's glass out of his own grip. Draco scowled at the hand and followed its movement up to where the glass was brought to a set full lips.
„You forgot your lunch again so I thought I would bring some to Weasley too,“ Draco offered. He shot a dirty look in Ron‘s direction. „However he doesn‘t seem very grateful.“
"Auror Malfoy went in first as planned but the door closed shut behind him. I didn't get a chance to follow him in," Harry was anxious but knew the best course of action to get Draco out was to follow the crisis protocol to point. Arguing and shouting would only delay Draco's rescue. "I already tried the basic set of opening and unlocking charms as well as some advanced ones. Nothing works."
