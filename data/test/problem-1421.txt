Harry touched her hand gently.  “No need to thank me.  I understand, Astoria, truly I do.  If you want to, thank Cass.  It’s been her decision, and she’s the one who will be going through the discomfort.”
“Yeah, he’s fine.  Still slouching around the house like a bloody ghoul.  If he’s not snarling about something that’s made him mad, he’s sad about somebody he lost.  It wasn’t fun the first time, but at least all the drama was spread out, yeah?”
Harry, oblivious, continued, “Anyhow, she got more and more worked up, and Ron finally lost his temper, and made a move for his wand, and she stunned the lot of us.  Next thing I knew, I woke up in that weird little shack, tied to a chair.”
Draco rushed in, and barely looked at Harry or John as he hastened to Scorpius’ side.  He was wearing a three-piece suit today, a crisp grey one that looked incredibly distinguished.  His hair was disheveled, though, as though he’d been running his hands through it.  The incongruity was appealing.
“Vi, leave Harry be for a second.  I’ve brought your notebooks.  Maybe you can make a list of useful things for Harry.”
Harry had changed, Draco realized.  After the war, he'd been bruised by all of his losses, but remained hopeful, open.  He'd had moments of unapologetic joy, and his gaze had been firm, unwavering.  This Harry was quicker to drop his gaze, more likely to demure than to fight back.  It was as though he'd had his flame diminished a little.  Draco was afraid to find out what part he himself had played in dimming that light.  Regardless, Draco found that he liked this adult version of Harry.  He missed the way Harry's eyes flashed with emotion, and how passionately he'd once defended his convictions, but he wanted to know more about why Harry now held himself back.  He didn't understand why Harry's face sometimes shuttered and hardened, but he wanted the opportunity to find out.  They'd both grown and changed from the hot-headed young men they once were, but Draco could finally admit to himself that Harry still captivated his attention.
It takes Harry less than an hour to speak to Minerva, pack, and Apparate to the gates of Malfoy Manor.  A house elf ushers him into a drawing room.  Draco sits at a wide desk, writing something on a long parchment.  He’s wearing his glasses, something that Harry knows he only does when he’s too tired to perform the vision correction spell.  He looks exhausted.  His face is grey, and his expression empty.  “Draco,” Harry says softly.
, Draco decided.  “I just wonder whether anyone has been parenting her?  You know, she’s so independent, and takes care of herself and all.  Just what have you been doing all this time, if not raising our daughter?”
“Harry, I never thought I’d accuse you of overthinking things.” Harry has confessed the kiss to Ron, after Ron showed up with a bottle of Fire Whiskey and a vague mumbling about ‘thinking Harry could use it’.  “Also, I don’t know how I’m supposed to help you.  Hermione’s always been the one to help us sort out this sort of thing.  You know I’m pants at feelings and stuff.”
I’m surprised to hear him speak so plainly, and I tell him so.  He laughs.  “Just because I love her, that doesn’t mean I don’t
“Oh, Harry, I’m sorry.  Of course you’d think that.  That was unbearably foolish of me.  They’re fine, all of them.”
“Kreacher won’t let me-” Harry said, at the same time that Kreacher said, “Master Harry isn’t letting-”.
Harry laughs, “Either are you.”  She grips his face with both hands and lays a wet kiss on his forehead, then staggers off to torment Blaise about his relationship with Dean.
“That in itself is progress, Draco.  Harry was taught that he wasn’t allowed to cry.  It was painful for him, today, showing such vulnerability in front of you, but he stayed through the session, he didn’t disassociate, he asked for Hank to come when he felt he needed support.  Those are all really positive actions.”
One of the things that Draco had noticed about seven-year-old Harry was how slow he was to smile.  It was markedly different from how he’d been when a baby, when his mouth had eagerly grinned, widely, toothlessly, at everyone around him.  At seven, rather than flashing across his face like lightning, as they did in his adult form, Harry’s smiles started with his eyes.  They crinkled a little at the edges, and then one corner of his lip would curl, followed by the other.  These smiles were tentative, and shy, and gave the impression that he hoped no one would notice them. It was like watching the dawn break over the horizon, and, when Harry gifted him with a slowly blooming smile then, Draco felt a strange prickling in his throat.  “I’m fine, Draco,” Harry said, and Draco smiled back at him.
“Perhaps.  You’ll never know how he feels if you don’t ask him.  He won’t tell you, unless you tell him first.  Put your pride aside, Draco.  Let him see how you really feel.”
There’s a tired-looking woman standing in front of an enormous mixer, adding a giant vat of cream.  “Mister Potter!  It’s nice to see you!”
He could hear Cass chattering away from the living room, and the deep voice answering.  He stood in the doorway for a moment, watching as Cass demonstrated how high she could kick, and did her best to show her Uncle Professor where his vulnerable bits lay.  “Can you set the table?”
Harry handed Draco Cass’ overnight bag.  “I wasn’t sure what your plans were, so I’ve packed a lot.  Formal robes, Muggle clothes, and everything in between.”
“Yes,” Scorpius said, voice muffled against Malfoy’s jumper.  “Mr. Harry said that I wasn’t in trouble.  But he said that he needed to have a talk with you.”  He looked worriedly at Harry.  “You’ll be nice to my Papa?”
“It’s Weasley now, and no.  She worries so much about Harry, and when she worries, she nags.  And when someone nags Harry, he just goes out and does the opposite, for spite.  He’s not used to people looking out for him, you know?  He’s always done the opposite of what people want him to do.”
“Mrs. Powers, I’m so terribly sorry for your losses. It’s unimaginable how painful that must have been for you, and I can understand how cherished Violet is.  I’ve never lost a child, so I wouldn’t presume to tell you that I know how you feel.  I do know what it’s like to lose someone that you love…” He trailed off for a moment, as his mind readily supplied the list of names that resonated through him like a heartbeat.  Dad, Mum, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Fred…. He drew himself back to the conversation, clearing his throat.  “It’s terrible, and I know that it made me extra-protective of those who I still held close.”
Gringotts is nearly empty at this time of the morning, so it takes nearly no time to be shown to an office.  The Goblin behind the desk views me with disdain.  “How can I help you, Harry Potter?”
Like that morning, when Harry had been late for work, and had stolen a piece of perfectly buttered toast from Draco’s hand as he raced through the kitchen looking for his wand.  Draco had been outraged, and his offended gasp had made Harry smile all the way to the office.  Harry had heard about it when he’d brought Draco a conciliatory sandwich at lunchtime.  “It’s about
“It is,” Cici said.  “They’re both still sleeping, but their magic and vital signs look good.  You can come in and be here when they wake up.”
“I don’t know if I can do it,” Harry confesses.  “I’m so unsettled.  I don’t want to risk causing a scene.”
“That may be,” Wendell agrees.  “But, Boy Hero, you might want to ask better questions about your highly curious memory loss, and why nobody seems eager to help with it.”
“Yeah.  He was really angry with me, and you know how Draco reacts with unexpected information.  I swear, I didn’t try to set him up, I’m just trying to be fair to everyone, but it seems like I can’t help but keep fucking it all up.”
“I know,” Hermione agreed miserably, “but honestly, it makes more sense than Harry taking some as-yet undiscovered mind-altering potion.  He’s an Auror, Draco, it’s all he’s ever wanted to be.  He doesn’t even take headache potions when he’s on-duty.  He took a little too much dreamless sleep just before he defeated Voldemort, and it scared him.  He was terrified of being addicted.  Any time I’ve been at a party with him, he refuses Gillyweed.  He doesn’t even drink really, just Butterbeer.  He doesn’t care if anyone else does it, but he’s horrified at being out of control himself.  It just doesn’t track.”
“No, that’s fine, cheri.  I have some things to take care of.  I’ll give you my email address later, and you can share it with your Dad.  He’ll email me directly if he needs anything.”  Cass struggled to remember the word for how Papa was being.  Evasive.  Any doubt she’d had that she was overreacting disappeared.  Something was wrong.
“Of course, you don’t even have to ask.  I’m delighted we’ll get to have her for longer.”  Draco stayed silent for a while longer, and then, seemingly in spite of himself, asked, “And you, Harry?  Are you staying?”
“Please share your personal feelings about the former members of Slytherin House who you attended school with?”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, tried in vain to wrap his legs around him too, but learned that it was difficult to do so while standing up. They tumbled to the ground, and Draco decided that it was a good a place as any, so he methodically stripped Harry bare and kissed every inch of his body.  Twice.
“Oh my gods, Harry, is that really what you think?”  Draco’s eyes glistened.  He was sitting so close, and this was so much, and if he wasn’t careful, Harry would start believing that this meant something, and he was pretty sure he wouldn’t survive a Draco-related heartbreak a second time.  Harry shrugged, his eyes darting towards the door, trying to think of a way to end this conversation.
Dean busied himself with taking samples, but just before he left the room with the vials of blood, he said, “Hey Harry?  I just wanted you to know that we take patient confidentiality really seriously.  I’m thrilled to see you, and to meet Cass, but I won’t be running off to the Prophet on my lunch break.”

him, he said, and that should make it easier for Draco to admit what he's felt for so long too but it doesn't – or does it? His head is all awash with confusion when he tries to think about it, to practice how this meeting might go, but he can't – can't imagine a word of it, just hopes and hopes quietly and fervently without quite knowing what exactly it is that he's hoping for.
“Shut the fuck up and -” Draco begins, but it turns into a keening breathy wail as Harry pushes his slick fingers into him tentatively, first one and then after a while two, head reeling with the knowledge that he is
The brightness slips from the corners of Draco's eyes, but his body arches up to meet Harry's. Harry's already inside him when he replies, his own voice shocked, whispering, like he's swearing and cannot believe the words that dare come from him -
Draco echoes, shuddering, ready and unprepared all at once, desperation and innocence fighting inside him – he could

“Fuck off -” Draco hisses between clenched teeth, his body singing out the opposite of his words just like Harry's - “Fuck off – and die, Potter.”

Hermione writes at the top of the page, bent over a desk in the library. It feels like she lives here these days, always drawn back to the room in spite of the books animosity towards her. She stares back at the page and nibbles on the end of her pen. Being here – taking time to think about being here – what they're all doing in this house together at this time – it seems strange. She's not even sure any of the others
“Upper west portrait gallery,” Draco mutters, more or less to himself - “Odd choice. Not where I was thinking, but maybe -”
“It was the music,” Harry grumbles when they're back on the ground and he is assailed by a chorus of grumbling,
He's between Draco's legs when it happens, on the verge of pushing inside, and Draco must have seen it in his eyes because his own grow bright with panic and he shakes his head, quick and fierce as a shiver on the pillow.
“Are you shitting me? I'm not that bored yet.” George goes silent. “Give me a bit, okay? I wanna just do something here.”

Harry wonders how many times he is going to have to say this - “Everyone who is here to help me say yes now, otherwise you're free to go. Honestly. I understand.”
He feels his lips move as she dips her head and goes, remembering the moment when he realised what was really important to him. It had been half way up a staircase as Hogwarts crumbled around them, wandless and searching frantically for his son. The staircase had suddenly swung out in a direction he had not wanted to go and he had felt dizzy with helplessness and sick with the motion of it, dropping to his hands and knees on the stones, feeling as though he might fall.
Hermione puts her head on the desk, thinking; this is how she ends up falling asleep here so often she thinks, but does nto really mind. It occurs to her, listening, that the library is actually silent today. The books have stopped snapping and clattering in anger at her very presence. She tentatively lifts the cover of one, curious; it hisses a little but does not bite, which is such an imprvement she raises her eyebrows. It's Narcissa's influence, she suspects, clearly. She has proved such an unexpected ally. It occurs to Hermione that she had come close herself to being too prejudiced against her to allow this; needing to find someone alive to blame for the horrible
“I do,” he says, making a mental note to surprise him with a piano in the cottage as soon as he can after they get home. He wants suddenly and terribly to tell Draco how beautiful he is, how much he wants him right now – a thought no sooner heard in his own head than it is burning his cheeks and he thinks several things at the exact same time in a jumble. He thinks about having him right there over the piano stool or on the cold marble floor of the music room, thinks about how little Draco can ever keep his voice down and how his cries would sound echoing off the vaulted ceiling thirty feet above their heads. He thinks how he is
and you're a terrible liar, which is funny really because so is he. He's very honest and sweet and lonely and to tell you the truth between that and being as brave as he was to me I think he was in the wrong house – only don't tell him I said that – it might hurt his feelings.”
There is a far away look in Narcissa's eyes, the gaze of looking back over an ocean of time and reasoning. Andromeda nods -
“I'm guessing that because you're here, yes. Who sent you? My mother? Granger, maybe? Look I get it, everyone wants to help, everyone wants me and Potter to run off into the sunset and live happily ever after – well like I told Granger yesterday, I'll talk to him later, though frankly it isn't anybody's business and I don't even know where you all get this from, I don't even like him, it's a great big mess, and yes, fine, alright? I want that too? Maybe. Though I doubt he even likes me any more – if he ever did, and dear Merlin's fucking beard we
whatever that is. All of a sudden his parents are poised to move back to the manor, Bill and Fleur are headed back to Shell Cottage and Harry is trying to engage him in conversations about whether or not he wants to stay living at Grimmauld Place, or if
Potter's glaring at him now and the fear abates a little - “I thought – stupid of me, but I thought -” a twitch of his lips and a shadow across the face tells Draco again how stupid Potter clearly thinks it was - “I thought you – I thought you cared -”
“We just want you to know -” Molly says brightly - “That you and your son are welcome with us for as long as you like and we're ever so grateful you know – for what you both did for our Harry – it can't have been easy.”
“Just glad y'all had to put up with it too,” Pansy sniffs then goes a little quiet as she catches Hermione's eye. They go quiet for a minute, awkward; Pansy actually catches herself scuffing the grass with the toe of her shoe.
“Harry and Draco?” she says within half a minute, reading with the speed of someone who only ever stops reading to write - “How long have they been gone?”
stares determinedly at nothing in the direction of the window, thinks of all the people outside, worthless wretched
The funny thing was, that if the music and the make up had started out as a mask, they seemed to have rather become a part of Draco that felt more himself than he was, and if there was still a part of him hiding behind them in fear of the people he used to be, well then – who wasn't hiding behind something, and what made a lie deplorable when it created a beautiful new whole? He wonders, turning away from the mirror, what Potter hides behind. He has always had the rather uncomfortable feeling that in a world full of fakers, Potter might be the only person just trying to be himself without external artifice. He sighs. Speaking of fakers he thinks he can hear Pansy's voice in their shared lounge area ouside the bedroom. He smiles at the sound, finishes the last touches of arsenic green and old gold in the corners of his lips, turns back his collar, fixes the green pin to it and goes out to meet her.
a year or so ago. It had been a rather glowing review. Draco's stage name was still eluding him when he had heard the crackle and tap of a microphone being switched on, and a shockingly loud, mocking drawl startling him so he almost came off his broom -
runs around the table, George grinning and nodding in agreement. Glasses clink so hard that the table is soon doused in fire whiskey and elderflower wine.
“Draco -” his father sounds pained; he feels a rush of satisfaction to hear it. So let him be pained - “You've been in here for four days. You have to come out eventually.”
There's a bed and a guttering candle flame and a moonbeam thrown hastily over two sets of legs like a blanket that will always leave something cold. There's a hand pulling a real blanket up around them and the silence of not knowing what to say that also covers not needing to say anything. There is one boy who starts to cry because his feelings are too big for his body, and the other who holds him, and in the end says -
“You heard me,” the girl repeats - “beautiful. Like sun and moon and they do not even know it.” She splays out her fingers, admiring the shine of varnish in the greenish light.
“Really?” Andromeda's voice is less challenging than before - “I thought you two were always close.”
Something goes wrong. Harry finds himself holding on to Draco's wrist for just a little too long, and he's not even really staring at Draco's arm but it feels to Draco like he
“Yes,” Harry says, and he starts a little; he had not meant to voice the question out loud, he feels half a jerk of embarrassment but Harry kisses the back of his neck, pulls him a little closer, runs his fingers across the sensitive part of his hip and soothes the surprise he feels at having dared whisper it out loud - “ - the realest. The best. Most real thing there is.” He punctuates each phrase with kisses , until Draco rolls over.
Harry huddles close to Draco for warmth as they look up at the London sky, suddenly bursting into life with colour and light, fiery flowers streaking and fizzling across the sky. For a long time Draco stands perfectly still, moving only to slip a hand into Harry's, not even sneering or commenting on the relative standards of non magical versus magical fireworks. All around them their friends and the hundreds of strangers in the square seem very close, very connected as they gaze up at the sky in wonder, dreamy with the near magic of the light and sound and smell of smoke and sulphur. When the fireworks glitter green and gold Harry looks sideways to see the lights reflected in Draco's eyes and the play of shadow and sparkle across one pale cheek and he loves and loves and loves him. They do not even see the final burst of finale fireworks except out of the corners of their eyes, so lost they are in kisses in the middle of that busy square.
“You – you bloody well will!” Narcissa gasps at the end of this, in the same shock that Lucius feels at hearing her use such a jarringly
said it before, you know,” he says gently in what it occurs to Draco is a terribly Slytherin move because in listening to what Potter's saying he does not notice the hand that cups his face like it's the most fragile of things for at least a second and somehow – like it's a spell Harry's casting, he's leaning in and their foreheads are touching and it feels earth shattering, this tenderness, like it might kill him and he can barely breathe.
“Methinks the lady doth protest too much,” Ginny rolls her eyes, Taz high fives her over Harry's head -
“You know what?” George stops walking in the middle of the flow, claps Draco on the shoulder and grins - “I
over and over until Harry had actually got quite scared, like Draco was apologising for Burbage's death, for everything he had ever failed to do, every wrong choice either of them had ever made, for Voldemort, for the war itself and maybe he had felt responsible, maybe after all he had been -)
when he got nothing out of her, not ever. She would not dream of wearing her heart anywhere anybody could see, not like these children all do, not to expose the people she cared about by making them a target like that; she has always known how evil works, how it hits you. Even when she was bleeding inside from how badly she could see her baby hurting nobody could have smelled the blood on her for trying.
Draco raises an eyebrow but decides to be gracious for once this morning and not comment on Potter's knowing this, just like Potter – if he did pick up on it – doesn't comment upon Draco knowing what he drinks either.
Harry nods because he guessed that already. Because he has carried Draco through this one a hundred times. He knows that sometimes he is the one being eaten by the snake, sometimes Draco is being eaten himself, sometimes it's his mother or his father or anyone he has ever loved – sometimes it simply happens exactly as it happened – it is just their old Muggle Studies professor who Draco never even liked. And sometimes, that is part of the whole problem – he knows this because Draco feels the need to say her name every time it's her – as though he killed her himself. Once he told Harry that he had – or at least he might as well have, it all jumbles together in Draco's head until he's the worst person that ever lived and there was a time – they both know it, when Harry would have said that was true. A time when Harry was an idiot.
“No it was – when I said – after the battle – when I realised – I realised you'd been master of the Elder wand all along and – you never even thought of it, never even reached for that power – I realised that I -”
Harry chuckles and rolls away, wondering if Draco will just grab his clothes and run like he used to when they were fifth years. But it's different now, and they know it and he doesn't, just lies very still for a long time, eventually rolling over and blinking, and they're lying on their backs side by side and when Draco's hand finds his he does not pull away. At this rate, he thinks he might one day be able to dream of actually snuggling. He at least dares to look sideways, and Draco's looking back with a a faintly challenging eyebrow raise. There's a butterfly flapping wildly in Harry's chest that he might actually be ready to let out -
he goes back to his room, sighing heavily, wondering why it feels like his chest has been cried straight into.
It's all about healing, she thinks, at the core. All of them together in this house, hurting and tearing their feelings around the walls, each of them a breath of wind in a hurricane. And here she is in the centre of that storm trying to make sense of it by writing it all down. Trying to work out a logical plan of helping.
something he isn't seeing, not to mention – he jumps up before he can think himself out of it. She doesn't stop for him, so he has to sort of trot to catch up to her. That's alright, he's used to that from Hermione.
He wants to be that idiot again, looking at this boy here in the mirror and hating him, no clue of who he is.
“When -” he sighs, he has avoided talking about the battle these past five weeks since he's been hiding out at Number 12, ignoring the press - “When I died – I mean when everyone thought I'd died - Voldemort sent someone to go and check – only it was Narcissa who checked. She knew I was alive and she told him I was dead. If it wasn't for her I
lumos being the first spell he has cast with it in so long – he still has to ask about this, he thinks. He doesn't want to.
“Yeah -” Pansy nods, screwing up her lips in an ugly sneer. “Yeah McGonagall right, cool, only do you know when the last time she ever spoke to me was?”
“Oh,” he bites his lower lip, nibbling the pout away. “It's all in my stupid head again isn't it? It wasn't real.”
This past fortnight ought to feel, like a dream, he thinks; instead it just feels like the only real time he has spent since fifth year. His heart wobbles at the idea – it's been sneaking up on him over the last few days with increasingly noisy steps – that he might actually be starting to feel happy. It's terrifying.
since you started in on the family now, there -” he points to a twist of stars, not the biggest or brightest in the sky but Harry feels with a pleasant shiver for a moment that they shine brighter for a moment, pulsing out a special gleam just for him. “That's Draco – the dragon constellation -”
She almost feels guilty for how harsh she was to Lucius, almost but significantly not, not when she also feels contentment at the look in his eyes which allowed her to hope. Besides, guilt and regret should be saved for the children these days. Considering which, she takes three steps towards Draco's door and then stops, shakes her head minutely and turns her back – just for now – on that door as well.
I shrug.  “Seems weird to define people based on how they were in school.  I wouldn’t imagine that you haven’t changed any, or grown, or learned new ways of looking at stuff.”
, the mind voice instructed.  Yes, right, good.  He returned to Draco’s office, and collapsed into the desk chair.
He smiles then, but it’s chilling.  “Then, I found out that he was dating Harry Potter himself.  I couldn’t target him directly, not with the Chosen One being directly in his pocket.  But that created bigger problems to solve.  You, of all people know that we couldn’t allow someone like Potter to be tainted by Malfoy’s darkness.”  He directs this last sentence directly to Hermione, and my instincts flare, and my bad feeling gets a lot worse when she flushes and looks guilty.
“Yes, he lives with Andromeda right now, but I spend a lot of time with him.  He’s lovely, and it would be nice for you to see your Aunt, wouldn’t it?”
Hours passed, Cass slept on, and Harry seemed to shrink inside himself the later it got.  His face, devoid of its usual good humour and confidence, was grey and blank.  When Draco’s eyes met his, he barely recognized them.  They’d lost all of their sparkle.  Draco had thought that the day he’d broken up with Harry was the worst he’d ever seen him.  He’d been wrong.
“How dare you?”  The woman is shaking her fist in Draco’s face.  “You think that we’ve forgotten?  What you did?  What your whole Merlin-damned
“I…I don’t…I need…” Harry’s eyes were a little wild as he looked around the room, avoiding eye contact with anyone.  Suddenly, he jumped to his feet and sprinted from the room, headed in the direction of his bedroom.
Cass met Draco’s eyes, and gave him a little smile.  “Thank you,” Draco said to Cass, and she shrugged it off, looking about as comfortable with the attention as Harry had been back in school.
He must have fallen asleep, because the next time he’s aware of anything, it’s warm, and sunny, and someone’s talking to him.  For a moment, he is hopeful that it’s Draco, but the voice is wrong, a tenor instead of a baritone.  Ron.  He squints up and Ron’s face is a solar eclipse, his red hair a flare of brightness.  He’s still talking, but Harry doesn’t really know what he’s saying.  The voice sounds kindly enough, though, so at least he’s not in trouble.  Ron is holding out his hand, and Harry blinks at it stupidly, unsure what to do with it.
Draco was dragged back to reality by Scorpius who started to talk about his upcoming party. Draco had a hard time getting a word in when Scorpius got started, but when he was listing all of his birthday wishes Draco nudged him to get his attention. “I haven’t heard back from aunt Andromeda if she and Teddy will be attending your party, would you mind giving her a fire-call while I prepare breakfast?”
“You slipped while making potions, the cauldron fell on your head. I took you here as fast as I could, but you were already unconscious. You’ve been asleep for about five days.” Potter chewed on his lip. “I thought I’d lost you”.
“Of course we will. I can’t believe you’re six now, you’re so grown up. I wish your mother could see you now.” He hugged Scorpius a little bit tighter against him.
Draco stopped, and instead, he nudged Harry down flat on the bed, crawling over him. Still a little loose from the night before, he conjured some lube that he smeared around his opening, before he coated Harry’s cock with the rest. He slowly sank down on him, pressing Harry’s hands over his head on the bed, kissing him until he was seated fully inside him. Taking a second to adjust, he stopped kissing Harry and instead just looked at him: his lips red and swollen from their kissing, a light sheen of sweat over his forehead. He let go of Harry’s hands and traced his own fingers over Harry’s face, over his nipples, making Harry hiss and open his eyes. He placed both of his hands on Harry’s chest and lifted himself a little, before pushing down again. Both of their moans filled the bedroom, along with the sound of flesh meeting flesh. Harry placed one hand around Draco’s hip, pushing him down with every thrust, his other hand firmly stroking Draco until he could feel his abdomen clench before he came with a broken sound all over Harry’s stomach. It was only a couple of seconds later that Harry pushed up harder as he emptied himself inside him.
Draco pushed in a bit harder this time, forcing a moan out of Harry. Harry put his head down on the desk and gritted out, “harder!” Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and started to fuck him in earnest, each thrust more forceful than the one before. He could see Harry’s knuckles whitening, trying to hold on to the table. Harry was meeting Draco with every push, and Draco had never seen anything hotter than Harry Potter leaning over his table, trying to fuck himself on Draco’s cock. He took one of his hands and put it around Harry’s cock, which was smearing pre come all over Draco’s desk drawers. He began stroking Harry in timing with his own thrusts, his knuckles banging against the drawers at every pull. Something primal stirred in him at the thought that Harry would come all over something that belonged to him.
“I was, um, just heard a noise that’s all. Wanted to check it out,” he mumbled, a bit annoyed he couldn’t come up with anything better.
“Grandma says she sees them all the time. I’ve never seen one and I wanted to see one for real,” Scorpius yawned.
Ron looked at him with furrowed brows, but he didn’t answer him, just tapped his knuckles again and gave Draco a nod. He went to the door, but before he reached it he turned and walked up to Draco again.
“Wow,” Harry nods dully, knowing what's coming and struggling to take it seriously - “I feel like Mary Poppins on dismissal day at the Banks house.”
The very fact that he had just been thinking this himself just makes Draco all the more annoyed about Potter's saying it, that and the goody-goody Gryffindor way in which he says it -
Morbid, yeah. He thinks it started with accepting his readiness to die and never really left him. So many times over the years he has wondered if he really did rejoin the living after all. He remembers Ginny in exasperation sighing this truth at him in one of their final rows. She was ready to move on, she said, why couldn't he be too? It was a gap in their connection he could never have breached, a gap which of itself had heralded a severance of that connection. He couldn't move on, he could only keep moving.
“You wish!” and Harry laughs, because of the night, because of their banter, because of the hour that is so early it's really more like late, because of the stars and the air and this boy that he loves dazzling in the moonlight, because, above all, because of the light and life and laughter in Draco's eyes. There was a time he thought he might never see that again and he will spend another lifetime making sure it never goes out.
Across the field, the guitars swing into volume, and it feels to Harry a little like being electrocuted – but in the most beautifully colourful way. The chords are gold; he can almost see it on the air and when the cello sparks to life the undercurrent of sound is amber amongst the gold, so bright at first he almost doesn't notice it's Draco playing.
all be able to decide for ourselves? Regardless of what the others are doing? I know we're all close – we've been living together ever since – well but – it could never be forever. On the other hand -”
They say something else, laughing, that he does not catch because he's riveted towards that stage – him, he supposes, and just about everyone else in the hall and he wishes desperately that he had not been so late down so he could have got closer to the front – although the front, as far as he can tell is mostly screaming first years who look like they might faint from excitement. The lighting widens and shifts and the colours of Draco beam out cross the room in prisms of light. The shiny black of the outfit conceals more rainbows than colour ever could and his hair shines silver, some trick of the light making it look as though there are tiny stars swirling out from him, drifting through the rainbows.
of his presence but not stepping back to increase the distance between them. In fact he steps forward until they're almost nose to nose, both sets of fists clenched, breathing each other's breath.
Man is least himself when he speaks in his own person. Give him a mask and he'll tell you the truth.”
The three of them run to catch up with the others, and they tumble into the bar stamping feet and rubbing hands together against the cold.
“Urghhhhhh,” Harry groans, long and heavy, and sinks back into the armchair he only recently managed to haul himself out of. “I thought I
“Oh.” Draco moves along. George sits down. He glances sideways, unnerved to have someone sat next to him, even if he was the one to make that move, and looks away again.
She finds herself underlining his name. Staring at it for a long time and then not knowing what to write. There has to be hope for help to be given and she honestly does not know what to do with this.

“Just for saving the Wizarding World?” Harry raises an eyebrow - “Okay I suppose I kind of did. Shut up, Malfoy.”
“I've never -” but he trails off; he's always been a bit hit and miss at lying and he remembers far too suddenly that he
“You know what?” George says as they all start to head slowly through the crowds in the direction of the nearest wizard bar - “That was
“Can't picture it, Pans – you and Luna at couples night with – wait is it still a couples night when they're a three-way?”
The court goes wild, the majority of the shouting made up of objection. An angry viewer just behind Draco leans forward and hisses -
“Oh, you can picture the Manor well enough to Apparate yourself, can you?” He can't. Of course he can't. He was only there the once and hardly under the kind of circumstances that gave him a chance to look around or take in any detail beyond the dungeon.
“Because of course, you think only you can do poorly, but I ask you this Malfoy – who is losing the Triwizard Tournament?”
“Oh my god.” He didn't know. It had never occurred to Harry before. He didn't know any of it. He leans back against the wall, wondering whether to be relieved or sad that Draco stopped him just before he finished that sentence –
It's too late, has to be, too late for a happy ending, if he sees anything in Harry's eyes that might redeem him, make him out to be good or innocent or
Harry has ever heard, but then considering some of the things he had to say about it Christmas day, he supposes he should be grateful.
The twin pillars of his life had been clear to him in that moment – not good and evil, not darkness versus light, since it seemed the two could never be separate anyway – no allegiance mattered, no dichotemy in his own soul was relevant, just these two things – Cissy and Draco.
“We should get going,” he replies, stiffly, buttoning up his shirt, looking back over his shoulder to the bed. Harry is blinking in sleepy befuddlement, squinting at the light, adjusting to the shadows, smiling cautiously at Draco, looking at him – oh looking at him with eyes full of fire and light, in a way he would like to be looked at forever. He stands up a little straighter, feeling beautiful, then his chest does that thing again and he swallows down the wash of warmth and happiness.
And he does, because he cannot disobey an order anymore, far too much in need of being told what to do; if only Harry would tell him every step of the way – but he opens his eyes, the voice, the person, those eyes calling him back to the present, back to somewhere safe, somewhere good, and in the end he comes thinking nothing but this, this, this, Harry looking at him with shining eyes, coming inside him, hands gentle on his skin and he shudders out a barrage of breath, filled with some of the terrible blackness that is in him and it feels like it should pollute the air but instead it just dissipates and for a few seconds afterwards Harry holds onto him like he's trying to hold him together.
The closer the start of term creeps the less ready Draco finds himself feeling; but with everyone else apparently both ready and excited for it he does not mention this to anyone, even Harry. Harry, in fact, seems to be avoiding serious conversation as much as possible which suggests to Draco that he does not have time or want to hear about any misgivings he might have, which just serves to make him tetchy about the whole thing, annoyed at Potter's readiness to move on when he isn't and worried that he is going to be left behind. It's going to be so different for them, he thinks, the heroes returning after the war, especially
Lying awake later, Harry kisses Draco on the forehead, and he stirs in his sleep with a contented little wriggle and a sigh that makes his heart seep warm gold. He looks so peaceful in his sleep Harry could imagine nothing bad had ever happened to him. He could imagine him sleeping like this as an innocent squishy-faced first year, and he wishes with all his heart he could have protected him from it all. But it never would have occurred to him that the mean, self assured, cocky, supercilious git would
“Worse,” Draco rolls his eyes - “That's what I pay him for after all, and to be fair why he's a better band manager than you ever were, my dear.”
which – ugh sounds like an awful pedestrian thing to do, but he's not as angry as he used to be, albeit the bar was high – and he deflates quicker these days.
He has not made it into the next corridor before it comes. He stops, he doesn't have to stop, why does he even stop? He should have just kept on going – but no. Stops. Breathes. Holds his face tight in one hand like it might fall off, like pressing that mask right on, digs his fingertips into his hair line and whips around.
sort of relevant though -” Draco persists. “Think about it. Do we really want to go back to furtive broom cupboards and empty classrooms again? Being treated like kids after everything we've gone through? Hasn't this summer made an argument for inter-house solidarity?”
And now she breathes out and nods and thinks they might be alright. She knows she will not really be gone long, but it is so very far to go, and distance can feel like time sometimes.
He didn't mean to come up here; fuck, how he didn't mean to come up here. He stops half way up the staircase, wondering why his treacherous feet have done this to him, what imp in the brain whispered that this was a good idea. Maybe it's hangover from his late night wanderings in sixth year, since that was the only other time he can remember being restless and troubled enough to wander round the castle late at night. Somehow, back then he had come back to this place again and again as though a part of him remembered something that had not happened yet, or he was rehearsing his steps for that final scene.
his sight after all when they died. Draco looks so fragile sometimes, so ethereal, like a moonbeam across his bed – it feels like he could just blow away like sand from between his fingers. Sometimes he can hardly hold on tight enough.
life that had been in danger. He can feel Draco's heartbeat racing like a rabbit's, pattering and pounding like it's in his own chest.
She closes the door gently. Poor man, she thinks. Actually she did mind being in those dungeons more than she let on just there; she just didn't want him to know that. He clearly feels bad enough about enough things as it is. She is about to knock on the door he directed her to, but hears voices coming from inside – it's Fleur talking to Draco. Her first thought is
Draco looks down at his hands, masking a face that just for a second George can see is stamped with hurt, swiftly followed by a resignation that is almost worse.
So, he thinks – firstly – and putting aside everything he had been thinking pre- Malfoy for a moment, because it all no longer seems quite as relevant as it did first thing this morning. Firstly: it's been three years. Had he imagined seeing Malfoy again? Fuck yes, so often, too often. Had he wanted to see him? Yes, if he has to be honest, only – yes and yes and yes. What was Malfoy to him? This one was bigger, not a friend, he was never that but – after he threw Harry the wand that had defeated Voldemort, after he had failed to identify him to Bellatrix, after rescuing Malfoy from Fiendfyre- not really an enemy, ever. When he looks back upon their time as enemies, it feels – and has felt for years – like they belonged to memories of a happier time, the good part of his time at Hogwarts. It feels like their enmity had been nothing more than that of silly kids playing at rivalry and frankly, again, being brutally honest here – he had always rather enjoyed it – and yes, alright then, he glares down at his cock which perks up to give him this reminder- he had got off on it as well.
tell him, didn't he? All of that emotional outpouring, all those confessions made, the start he felt they had begun towards something beautiful, and now Draco won't make eye contact, won't speak to him, has in fact gone back to a positively second year level of sneering at him behind his back as well as visibly and here he is again, getting wound up back as though six years of growing up has done nothing.
The carriage pulls up in the driveway and swings around to let them out in the direction of the house.
“I wasn't -” she begins to lie, then stops. Hermione raises an eyebrow at her and she wonders how she could have lied bare faced to Voldemort and not to a teenage girl.
She puts large question marks by that one. While she's fairly sure Ginny's presence would be helpful to Molly, she's not sure how it would affect Harry or if Ginny could keep from damaging the careful work she's been putting into the Harry/ Draco problem. It's strange enough to her and she knows it weirds Ron out, so how would Ginny feel? Either way, probably not helpful she decides.
ness of Draco - “You got changed?” he suddenly says in surprise, realising that Draco is now all in black, the simple shirt and trousers that had been habitual to him before he became a sensation, chameleonic and dazzling as if from outer space.
“It's um – very – nice?” Harry can hear Draco battling not to make it a question and failing. Luckily Ron and Hermione bound up to them at that point, with Ginny and George.
Lucius moves his mouth a few times. He does not look well, Luna decides. He always used to look so nice, now his hair needs brushing and he clearly does not shave too frequently. In fact he looks rather pale and thin and his hands move a little worriedly in his lap. It's sad.
“Yes. It was exceptional. To be chosen; but do you know something, Malfoy? I have spoken to many girls, girls who were
being understood. Luckily Pansy intercepts him before he can thik about it too much, stalking down the pitch towards him, hands on hips. Draco puts his hands up before she can even start.
had he gone all this time ignoring it? Not that he had set out to fuck himself silly over the thought of him, but there he always was, his face, his hair, the infuriating fucking shape of him, fuelling every late night whimper, every savage wank. So many times his lips had shaped Malfoy's name in silence as he came, wanting to scream it. So many times when he had punched him or threatened him, been held back from him by his friends – he'd been hard for him too; it had been at least half of the reason fueling his rage. Really, thinking about it, Malfoy's annoyance levels, his petty insults – they had not been nearly enough to get under his skin the way he had let them, setting it prickling with the frenzied need to get closer to him – even if he had convinced himself it was only an urge to wipe the smirk from his face. It was
in. An attitude I hardly think is productive by the way and McGonagall says she's not sure quite what she's doing letting the school house a bunch of adult children who do nothing but get up to preposterous shenanigans all over her Quidditch pitch.” She fixes them with a challenging stare.
“But – I feel like they're saying it because they don't know what else to say. I don't think they really
he adds with a hint of spite, side-eyeing Harry who suddenly finds that entire escapade a whole lot less funny than it seemed at the time.
what do you know about loss? But you can't do that, can you?It's not a set of bloody weights and balances -” he shrugs - “I dunno. Doesn't work like that. And you, you're a mess – no offence – you didn't even lose
“Yes. When I am alone in a strange country and my people – that is you people – are not there – often I am listening to the instruments of Bulgaria and it is comfort, you know?”
you know like when you read those silly stories in the papers about monkeys chucking paint at paper and people selling it for millions of – what was it? Pounds?”
over and over, heart and chest and senses balling into a tight fist inside him and coiling up too low down for comfort. He registers surprise in Draco's eyes, shock, a sneer, apprehension, breathlessness. He registers his breathing grow heavy and his eyes darken and drop to Harry's lips at the same fraught moment as Harry's eyes drop to his lips in time to see him moisten them with the tip of a perfect tongue and he's on those lips in a flash, kissing Draco, claiming Draco, body surging forward, pushing him fast between him and the wall, clutching and reaching for him, trying to get skin, trying to touch everything he can, starved for this, desperate, kissing like kisses will save him, feverish and urgent, and one cool soft hand grips the back of his neck like a claw, all nails, and the other one pushes at his shoulder like it's fighting with itself as to pushing him off or pulling him closer but either way Draco whimpers and kisses him back, and the whimper undoes Harry completely. It's been a thousand years and he's not in fifth year any more, he wants more, so much than ever before. He's so hard already and he can feel Draco's cock against him too and when he touches the edge of his face he has to take a step back or come already for the soft perfection of that skin.
“Undetectable extension charm. The peacocks were raging about it too, of course, you can probably imagine, but at least they got to live. Only victory over him my father and I ever won.” Even knowing how ridiculous it is doesn't stop him from still feeling that flash of defiant pride.
gesture with a half arsed right hand. He's perched on the left of the sofa. There's room for another person on the right of him; nobody would have dreamed of filling that space.
“Um. Me actually.” Well this is a first; Harry raises a curious eyebrow – for once, Draco actually sounds
“Technically we stopped – after the international statute of wizarding secrecy in 1692 – we weren't supposed to any more – until then it was easy, and we rescued a lot from this mad wizard who was posing as a muggle priest in the fifteenth century, he cast a glamour burning all these artworks but most of them he sold off to pureblood families -”
he snaps. He sees his father's face go through a series of moves as he wonders whether or not to come back with a typical
“Pans -” he sighs and this time he does turn round, leaning against the stone – Granger punched him here once, he rememebrs with sudden bizarre detachment. He sighs heavily. She leans against the nearest stone, one foot crooked up against it, waiting. She takes a cigarette case from her back trouser pocket and offers it to Draco before taking hers. He shakes his hand absently at first and then sighs again – this time at her -
When did he get so morbid? He's not even sad today, but it's a melancholy kind of happiness, being back, walking the path overlooking Hagrid's hut in the early morning light, pumpkins burgeoning bright orange against the fading green, footsteps crunchy in the frost and leaves and at the same time the sunlight, so bright it can only feel unnatural, so bright at the end of autumn it can only be Hogwarts. The gold and dazzle and broken dream of Hogwarts.
(“And you can shut up as well,” he mutters out loud to his dick, which does not take a blind bit of notice, apparently still thinking about Malfoy's lips.)
“Malfoy -” Harry gulps, all of a sudden Harry knows what to do; it's so clear to him and he's more afraid than ever because he knows Draco has every right to refuse him.
wish, but Blaise is standing, strecthing, yawning before she can speak - “Right. Bed. You especially, Mr Black, I am
“MUDBLOODS! FILTH! BLOOD TRAITORS AND REPROBATES IN MY HOUSE! IN MY HOUSE NO LESS, OH WOE THE DAY! SCOUNDRELS! TRAITORS - Cissy! Narcissa, my dear girl, how are you, it's been too long! And is that young Master Draco? Let me see you, my dear boy!”
He sees Harry and Draco tentatively joining in the clean up – Harry organising, to his surprise - and just as much to his surprise, Draco taking instruction on where to haul boxes and strip walls. He notices the moment that Lucius and Draco catch each other's eye, the one with a painting under his arm and the other peeling off ancient wallpaper with a spell that honestly looks quite fun. He sees the son meet his father's eye for the first time in years and the father for the first time in as long not look away. He sees Lucius put down the painting and enfold his son in a hug, wordless, both of them. He sees Harry and Narcissa in other corners of the room look away discreetly, just like he does.
a yes. Tell me whatever does the saviour think about when it's alone o'clock in the changing rooms?”
“Am I fucking stuttering? Yes, yes the one with the name like stars. You also have name like stars, it is very – you are not – huh -” she pauses – there is something strange here. Whilst yes, the boy's eyes are on her and he is frowning, attention on her, yes – he is not even faintly captivated by her presence. It is as though her aura has not touched him.
“I was here,” he shrugs. “I heard everything. I shouldn't have – I mean -” he fumbles for the words to say, he doesn't find quite the right ones, and what comes out is - “I was a dick to you that year. I should have known better. All that time I spent thinking about you – you have no idea – and I still never figured you out.”
Narcissa could have told him; she sighs without the faintest sound, if only he had been able to ask her at the time, if only she had been able to tell him. She takes herself away discreetly when the children – yes she's not that little of a normal mother and they
The carriage stops so that Draco can whisper a password into the gate, which swings open like great bat wings to admit them. The driveway is huge, between the box hedges, gloomy and dark and the house looms up beyond it like a monster.
“I'll tell you what I can't imagine,” Blaise sighs deeply. “Someone so successfully enunciating so many italics in one sentence so that people can hear where they go. It's a skill Pans.”
“Oh Harry, don't be silly. You can't replace skin with billywigs, that's just silly. Come on, let's sit down, the others will be here soon.”
Ginny? Why would she be mad he wanted to save somebody who saved him? Does she hate him? Does she especially hate the Malfoys? Did Draco do something he doesn't know about? Surely he always picked on Harry the most? And then Ron and Hermione. Maybe Hermione meant think about her fondly – well he does, like all the Weasleys – ah maybe that's it – he ought to be able to summon up something more for his girlfriend. Nope, it's gone again. There's only one face that swims into his mind when he tries to conjure her up, and it's pale and pointed and it's always been there, every time he started to think too much about anything. He darts away from thoughts of that face like he's a shoal of fish, all shivery and breaking up, coming back to this one thing like it's a nesting ground. Bad thought. He feels himself going red. He gets up, unable to account for the feelings of restless itchiness, and wanders the house. There's too much past here. Too many things that belonged to Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, like an In Memorium list. He lingers in the drawing room running his fingers over the gold strands of tapestry – Sirius and upwards to somebody he was told might be his own ancestor, feeling the ancient fabric, the threads without really seeing them. An hour later he hears voices in the kitchen and he looks to where his fingers have been lingering for some time, tracing them over golden threads as though through strands of golden hair, all this time lingering on one name –
“Got this,” Pansy nods, nostrils still flaring a little, but she fist bumps him with a twitch of the lips and nods to herself as she heads away.
he amends, sealing it with another kiss, and it sounds - because he cannot say it any other way – just a little like he hates him again and that's good. He's not sure he could bear to hear that name again -
of course, better than anyone perhaps in the entire wizarding world, she saved it after all, did she not? With a lie? But she finds herself not wanting to now. She knows what this strange young woman is talking about well enough, is just startled to hear her say it and so plainly. Her rude, abrupt manner of speech would clash with her elegant beauty if the one did not rather explain the other. Clearly this is a lady who has always felt confident enough to speak as she finds – the choice to do so is alien to Narcissa, though the confidence she greatly admires. If only she could find away to give Draco a little of
“What – apologise?” Draco raises an eyebrow, the flame pattern aorund his eyes makes them look angrier than he is now that he has – at least a little –
Harry can see thunderclouds brewing in Draco's eyes and where that once provoked him into an urge to chase down the storm it now kicks into his chest with an
“That's different -” Draco had waved it away with an airy flick of the wrist - “You have an extremely kickable face, Potter.”)
“So - “she goes on, surprised to find she has so many words in her once she starts, she will have to thank Bill for the vocabularly - “You are chosen for something, yes, and it is this big word “Chosen” - like a tattoo where everyone can see -” she notes him fiddle with his dressing gown sleeve - “Is like brand. You hate it and you like it. You want it and you fight it. I think this is you with everything. Anyway yes, I am fighting dragon, I am scared as a shit – do not laugh!” but she smiles - “I feel how small I am, how irrelevant, so tiny in body I could just break any minute, gone - and then I am a winner and I feel only – only still this feeling of smallness and of having to be aware that others are not me. And then – this is important part. Then I fail and I fail again. Everyone says “Oh well but you learn from this,” yes? But when you are feeling failure you think only you are not good enough, you think all you have learnt is that you suck. Yes. I feel this. I felt it. I felt I will never be feeling like triumph again – I will feel always like loser, not worth a shit. And this is what you are feeling now, yes?”
“She's a good egg, McGonagall,” Luna nods - “She let me stroke her behind the ears once – as a cat,” she adds when Blaise looks at her funny.
“Yeah,” he nods. Draco nods back and goes to take some of the stuff Ron is holding off him and George can hear that when Ron says -
he breathes in strength and his newly melted but finally beating heart warms out with that breath, singing joyously in the song of
it's what he's thought about for far too long and – is it really true that it wasn't just him? He moans into the kiss, from loss and wasted time as well as need. He thinks about how long he's thought about this, all those guilty wanks and constant streams of thought, thinks about an obsession that he never could categorise as love or hate since he was tiny and first heard the words
he didn't know any of it – about the tale of the three brothers, the Elder wand, the horcruxes, none of it – he takes a deep breath.
he hates him, he despises him, wants him, needs him and if that's not enough he does not know what is. Besides it's not
“You're just -” Draco stares at his wand as though unable to believe it - “You'd just give me it back?”
“Of course. Thank you. Understand, I -” to her surprise she sits down – it is so unlike her to have her head lower than anyone else in the room, let alone – no, she has to stop thinking
look – if they make eye contact for too long - he's going to fall so far he gets crushed by it. He'll never even reach for the surface again, he's drowning in Draco, he's been drowning for so long, reaching for him as he turns is like reaching for air. Touching him is like being set on fire with a flame that tingles every pore of him, reaching under his skin, dragging lust out from between his ribs in streams. He pulls the stopper out the bottle with his teeth so he does not have to let go of Draco's hips, pushing his cock up against him, barely able to slip a finger in first, though he does, then another and Draco whines -
“Do you want – anything – drinks – um – or I can just show you to some rooms but I mean – you're free to – I mean it's your choice,” Harry babbles, wishing he could sink into the floor boards with every word.
“I don't think we should see it like that -” Hermione frowns - “It's not that we're being asked to be
Harry said firmly, his first impulse the easy need to dissuade him from this train of thought because it is so obviously ridiculous and self destructive. But he can see where it comes from – he saw their teacher killed – right there on the table in front of him- he could have touched the body just before the snake unhinged her jaw. He would probably have nightmares about witnessing something like that himself – he
“I'll come with you to the trial, Harry,” Ginny says “But I'm not going to stay and I want to talk to you.”
“No really, it's – cheery, honest, everything a child could ask for, and yeah, shut up - close enough.”
gesture with a rather flappy hand, Luna thinks - “Draco's awake before you. That doesn't usually happen, does it?”
“I don't want to burst his bubble about it. I think – like – he's really into it – just like the rest of you and if I said I wasn't he might – deflate – it's horrible, I can't make him sad, not ever and that's the other thing isn't it? This – with Draco – it's all happened so fast too and now – now I have to think about that and what it all means -”
were listening to me, weren't you Harry?” she wails, positively pleadingly. Harry is still only just sitting up in his sleeping bag on the floor, rubbing his eyes and yawning.
“I don't get it. You'll hate muggles – I mean in the shit on them from a great height sense – why would you collect their art works?”
“How do you know about that?” Suddenly he's wary, half rising, half ready to bolt, but Potter grabs his wrist before he can get up.
had been, and Blaise – well, Draco sometimes suspects that Blaise mainly welcomed his new position as Draco's band manager for the opportunity it gave him to make sure he was eating and sleeping. Idiot Slytherins the lot of them. Draco gets them, finds them easy to love these days.
Ridiculously, Draco feels nervous. He stands by the old battlements, his fingertips jittering on the stone, looking out just to feel the night air in his face, the cool of it after the heat of the hall. He watches his hands move as though he's high on something -and it's not too far a comparison, he's buzzing from the music, the attention, the noise, the adoration of the crowd; it's a good feeling – so to be nervous just about
“You didn't -” he stops, he's not going to put it like that, however worried he is that Harry didn't like the performance. “So what did you think?” He jerks his chin as he says it, as though it's not that he actually
Three years and you two are still attached at the bloody hip. Work out he always did have an eye for an opposing team member, did you weaselette?”
“O- kay,” Draco nods with infinite patience born only of the opportunity it also provides him to patronise Potter - “I mean -”
he whispers, terribly afraid that tonight could break all kinds of resolves; he feels himself very much in danger of saying all those things he has managed to go so long without saying –
“Aww -” Harry wiggles down and Draco behind him, settling himself through the act of settling Harry.
“Look,” Harry says patiently - “I don't know why you're here. But you don't have to be. Nobody ever has to be -”
“What's so funny?” Draco turns, with an inscrutable face which Harry recognises as Not Annoyed Yet but Preparing to Be - “- and if it's another intolerable reflection upon the visual representation of inbreeding I will -”
Those eyes look silver when they narrow, and Draco's head darts forward like a serpent striking to catch Harry's mouth in a kiss; it's a mean kiss, an angry one, and so it is returned but Draco makes a little breathy sigh at the end that makes Harry's heart do something painful.
Harry nods, shifting up the sofa towards him so that they are sat startlingly close together - “But I'm coming with you.”
of them. It's only been three days since Draco's first show, but they feel like the only three worthwhile days he has ever lived.
but he hears it anyway. She sighs - “Look -” she says - “When it came down to it – at the very end – what did you care about? What outcome mattered?”
The tenderness washes through him like sunlight slanting across the floor, everything suddenly and gorgeously painted gold with it and for the first time since the war – or perhaps even longer – for the first time in what had to be years at least he takes a deep breath. A real breath, huge and slow and steady. The kind that pulls the chest out and draws in again like a bud bursting into sudden petals. It feels like this is the first chance he has even had to simply breathe. He looks down at the golden head resting on his chest, a lazily possessive arm thrown across his own ribs, holding him together, and he thinks
“I guess that didn't go well -” Draco says slowly - “Astronomy tower date, I mean – do you want -” he licks his dry lips; he has never felt so courageous and so scared. “Do you want to try again?”
The stars seem close enough to touch tonight; the air so clear and the scent of dew so sharp and sweet on the air -
In a way, a way that is amusing when put up for closer inspection, this reminds him of all those incredibly dull Saturday afternoons as a small child being dragged around stately homes and galleries by Aunt Petunia. Alright, there was usually something worth seeing in the art galleries but the stately homes had been a travesty of a waste of an afternoon, worth anything only for getting him out of the cupboard for half a day.
He's scared of the dark and they both know it, but Harry would not actually be mean enough to say so, just like he would never actually have argued that one. The dark, he thinks, even after all this time, even when to all awareness there is nothing lurking in it, is still a thing to be feared and he cannot blame Draco wanting that hall light.
“Well we'll catch you later,” Ron says, saving her. A little way down the hill they turn round hearing a wailing squawk of a noise, to see Pansy banging her head against a rock and Draco simultaneously patting her on the shoulder and shaking with laughter.
Ten years ago and a hundred thousand extra years, he's dawdling, he knows it, the Harpies are well up ahead of them even on their way to the Quidditch grounds and he hopes this does not portend anything for their matches to come. Gods he's ready to fly, here more than ever.
“Oh -” Malfoy smirks, Harry realises with horror that he's been staring at his lips, shining with clear gloss and glittering with tiny silver stars, even when after he pokes the tip of his stupid bastard tongue out to lick them a little, like a cat enjoying its prey. Harry's never been easy prey and if he's a mouse at all it's the mouse who picked the fight with this pampered, spoilt cat.
Narcissa steeples her fingers under her chin, thinking. It is more than she hoped for and she does not imagine that Hermione is the kind of girl to exaggerate or fabricate, in fact, to her extreme surprise she finds herself quite liking the girl; she is steady and practical and in truth a lot like she was herself growing up.
thoughts about this girl. Has to and will. Thankfully the girl takes the other side of the sofa - “I hear my son cry out so often at night. I can feel how scared he was so many times without being able to undo those things or – or apologise -”
He really is, more than he can say, it's not the first time the frustration has threatened to overwhelm him and he kicks whatever unfortunate article of furniture comes to hand. Hermione simply regards him calmly and takes a sip of her tea.
it fucking hurts his head, this song when the music starts – all that green floating above the stage and the smoke around Draco and the band in the same sickly shade but the song itself –
kind of phrase - “Trust me when I say you need to get used to Mr Potter's presence Lucius, just trust me.”
of wankers -” Draco's eyes gleam. “You'll never guess what I nearly walked in on in the Quidditch changing rooms today -”
In the corridor she closes her eyes tight shut for a second and gathers her thoughts and everything else together with one long intake of breath. At least she knows her priority now, not that it comes as any huge surprise, but yesterday she was less sure. If she needed to look after Lucius, if she needed to get a grip on the family, if she should hurry them out of this place and away from these people. Now she realises that everything she has to do requires them to stay and thankfully they have leave to do exactly that.
or if not fully thought, it then wanted it to be the case. After fifth year, after everything he knew went away, nothing he had, not an object not a thought, not a single thing felt safe; after their house was taken over – it all felt desecrated by the Dark Lord's presence – nothing was
“I shall cry into my pillow every night.” Draco mimics a yawn, and he and Pansy continue by holding onto each other and fake crying at volume.
“The truth is, Miss Granger, I need your help. Can you tell me what made Mr Potter testify for us and then rescue us from the courtroom like he did? I consider myself an excellent judge of character – some ancient prejudices aside – but I simply cannot fathom his actions.”
It's just that the opportunity for derision and scorn gives him something to remember himself by, something to hold on to in the wreckage of himself.
On nights like this it feels like he might have been. Like he could not get a thing right in his life and the movement of the curtain in the breeze is the shiver of snakeskin along the floor and his left arm itches in persistent reminder of a boy who fucked up and he wants so much just to be told he got something right, just once, that he might deserve this life that still bewilders him with it's happiness and levity.
He smiles, sort of shy. Draco smiles. It's the same. They glitter together in the late summer light. They form one long shadow heading back along the street to home.
“I think -” Harry remembers what Luna said before - “I think that's how it was for Draco. I suppose for me it's just been too much to take in. I like quiet.”
Several rounds later Luna drifts into the bar and perches on Ginny's knee, fireworks long gone and the drinking almost over -
“Harry!” He hears Ginny's voice like a crow through the mellow music in his head, hears Luna gently and unsuccesfully trying to disengage her - “Harry, what the hell are you doing! They need you in five minutes!”
“From what I've heard, the Ministry are treating them as a unit, and I can't let two people who've risked that much for me die just because they're connected to a complete cunt, can I?”
he hears Pansy murmur, and he almost smiles but he's too entranced, caught like a butterfly in a net of rainbow and silver stars.
she waves her wand at his back. “I'm not here to be comforting love, I'm here to be a bitch and give actual support.”
“I dunno -” for some reason his heart misses a beat at the bang and it's not just from the startle of it but a weird slick sense of dread - “Sounded like a door slamming.”
“You're complaining? And they always talk about how essential dreaming is to the character of the rock star.”
“-wanting to give me up to the Dark Lord,” Harry nods. “If I make a public announcement that she made a valid point there do you think people will let her off the hook?”
“Look, I'll be more quiet about it in the future if that's what you're getting at – or I'll, I dunno, go to the nearest bathroom cubicle or something, okay?”
“Look -” he says suddenly, blurting it out stiffly and awkwardly - “I'm sorry about what happened to you – when you were at the manor. I – I would not have had that happen. Aunt Bella was a fucking nutter, and I – well like I say I'm -”
about winning, for all they have spent six years striving for dominance – it never could lead to anything other than mutual loss or gain. Draco rips away -
“Oh yeah,” Draco sneers - “That's right. Remind me what I owe you. Thought you were entitled to me did you? Thought you could just do what you wanted then get rid of me? Is that all I – gods, never mind, I don't care, I don't give a fuck, do you hear?”
-Very insulted?-he asked, once they very far enough from the portrait so that its owner wouldn’t hear them,-Very insulted, really?
-What are we doing?-he asked Draco as if his behavior was absolutely normal. Confused Malfoy silently pointed at the chapter they were reading, earning a nod from Potter. They hadn’t talked till the end of the lesson, but it all just felt so…casual? Casual, but weird. How Harry just sat down next to him as if he had every right to, as if it was just something that they did. How their arms touched every time each of them had to write something down. How Harry accidentally touched Draco’s knee with his and then whispered a quiet “sorry” without even looking up. How he just casually used Draco’s textbook because he didn’t bring his own.
-This is stupid, Ron,-he mumbled. Draco was listening to everything and Harry really wanted this conversation to stop,-Honestly, why does it even matter?
It’s been a while since Harry had to wake up this early on a Saturday. With the first rays of sunshine, him and Draco left the castle to visit the orphanage Malfoy volunteered in. Walking down the empty, still dark halls at 6 in the morning felt rather surrealistic. Silent Malfoy didn’t make a picture any more normal for Harry.
-Congratulations to the team of 8th year and especially to their Seeker, Draco Malfoy!-Luna announced. Draco was already on the ground and his teammates started landing too.
-Morning, guys,-Harry said, seeing Ron and Hermione in their usual spot in the Great Hall and one thought immediately struck him. He still struggled with weight of yet another secret upon his shoulders. He truly wanted to come clean to Ron and tell him about his visit to the Ministry that summer, but their relationship was getting better with every day, and Harry feared that telling him would ruin it all over again. He told himself (and Hermione) that he was waiting for a perfect moment, but to be honest, hardly any moment could be perfect to tell your best friend that you had defended a man they both hated at a time in court and then lied about it for months.
-I don’t know what you’re talking about,-Harry said. His annoyance, anger even, grew with every second.
-That’s Astoria Greengrass,-she said, pointing at the girl,-Poor creature had been in love with your date for years.
So instead Harry would bring his homework and complete it listening to screams and rare laughter coming from the field. This way he also felt as if Quidditch was still a part of his life. It reminded him of the first time he caught a snitch. Or of that ridiculous story that actually got him on the team. Which also happened because of Draco. Huh.
-Any one you’d like,-Harry quickly grabbed Aurors’ brochure and without looking at McGonagall, disappeared behind the door.
-Yes. If it’s so important, I don’t blame Draco for anything. Even for that,-Harry said through his teeth, but meant every word.
-I don’t think there’s anything else I can do..,-Hermione said, finally leaving Harry’s hair alone. They stood in front of the mirror, Harry completely dressed, while Hermione was still in her uniform. She touched his hair once again and looked at him, waiting for some feedback.
-Then you have the wrong person,-Harry smirked,-Try these on,-he handed Ron the first tux they saw as they came in. Weasley took it and disappeared behind the curtain of changing room.
-Do you want something? I’ll get us drinks,-Harry asked after another long laughing session. Though it was the end of December and even magic couldn’t get rid of the cold, with all the dancing and laughing Harry’s hair got wet from the sweat, his bow-tie got loose and his jackets was now on one of the chairs – where he’ll definitely forget it. Draco too didn’t look that flawlessly anymore. His hair started curling up and it just amazed Harry.
-Fine,-Harry said. Hermione nodded and looked into the field. Harry hated how forced their conversation was,-Someone slipped him a Boxing Telescope,-he said, just to say something.
While Potter was trying to free his mind from those weird thoughts, Ron approached him. He was smiling ear to ear and definitely wasn’t mad at Harry anymore. Neither was Harry.
But still, sometimes Harry wished he also had someone to get lost in. A person who occupies your entire mind, at least for a while erasing all your worries and fears. All 8th year students were allowed to go to Hogsmeade by themselves any time on the weekends, and Harry didn’t even have anyone to invite.
-We’ll figure something out. Come on!-she took Draco’s hands,-Let’s go! Potter can come too,-Draco looked at Harry. He shrugged.
-I really wanted to sleep,-he confessed,-What are you doing here?-Quidditch wasn’t one of Hermione’s interests, and even being an amazing girlfriend of the captain she is, she rarely visited the trainings
The whole day all three were terrified of the moment to say goodbye. Lucy stayed awake though it was past her bedtime and her eyes were basically closing by themselves. She knew Draco couldn’t stay, but her brain just couldn’t make its peace with that. If he loves her, why does he leave every time?
-Malfoy needs to catch the snitch or it’s over,-Hermione said. She still didn’t believe in Harry’s theory,-God, Ron is going to be destroyed.
-Are you dating Luna?-Harry finally asked, turning his whole body to Draco. A couple of heads turned to them too, but neither Draco nor Harry cared.
-I can tell you have something on your mind, Draco. I’ve worked with children for decades now,-her voice sounded playful. Draco was still scared,-You can tell me and it will stay between us. Even if it’s too bizarre or silly,-she promised.
-What if we skip Defense today?-Ron asked Harry, knowing he would never get a positive answer from Hermione,-I’m tired. And my Transfiguration essay isn’t even nearly done.
-I’m Hazel. Hazel Durd,-the girl said. Harry nodded and pretended that he knew her, of course he did,-I was hoping I could talk to you.
-Oh, finally someone with manners, someone pure!-her hands touched her chest as she sighed,-You are the son of Narcissa and Lucius, aren’t you?
-Thank you,-Draco looked into the village. His mother was only meters away, waiting for him. He could almost see her silhouette ,-Okay then…
-So? Have you already decided on your future profession?-Draco shook his head and asked himself why he even bothered to come there,-No? Well, not a problem. Let’s take a look at your grades,-Headmistress gave Draco a small smile and started studying the material in front of her.
In professional Quidditch it’s called Starfish and Stick, originally for Keepers, but can be used by Seekers too. This move involves a player, basically jumping off his broom, but holding himself with one hand, while another catches the snitch.
-How was I supposed to know they both have dates? Who is Luna going with anyway?-Harry asked, no hoping for an answer.
-He will notice. And he will kill you,-Hermione answered in a calm voice, not asking Harry where and why he was going.
But before that could happen, Harry got under covers himself. He laid down and starred into the ceiling, counting spots and cracks on it. This year was so…weird. Harry felt a little out of place. There was nothing to do, nothing to fight for and it was a strange, unfamiliar feeling. Life didn’t feel like his anymore. He tried not to think about the future, but it was impossible. Potter’s future profession was a closed case for almost everyone who knew him. Kingsley announced it publicly that Auror Academy’s doors are always open for Harry Potter, since there is no other man with his skills, and most importantly his heart. Harry didn’t agree at all. His intention wasn’t to show some extra fake modesty, but he just couldn’t, didn’t want to take all credit for Voldemort’s fall. Whenever someone brought that up (which happened way more often than Harry would want), Potter replied with infamous “Yes, but…”
feels like so much, feels like everything, the warm weight of this soft golden head on his shoulder, Draco's deep breaths warm against his skin, the natural way in which his fingers run up and down the length of the arm thrown over his chest.
“Harry -” Luna says again gently, and tugs on his arm and he manages to move, shaking his head as though to rid it of an enchantment.
“Oh, did you like it?” Molly beams, oblivious - “I never tried Slytherin colours before, you know, wasn't sure how it would work out!”
used to come in here -” Draco sounds as thugh he is talking to himself, and Harry feels awkwardly terrible for hearing his rush of timorous words. “-and the snake. When I was asleep. I'd wake up and there they were, just at the end of the bed –
To Draco, it feels as though it has so often felt, on the verge of a fight; nostrils flaring readying to expell rage like a dragon breathing out smoke. He can feel the hardness in every angle of himself, knows that if Potter does not get his hands on him
specifically, which – given I only have the one and she knows that it's you – I'd say the odds were overwhelmingly in your favour, wouldn't you?”
“Nah,” George wheezes - “No way Perce that's fucking funny. I get it now. Why Fred sent us here. I'm glad Percy. I'm glad it was like that – the last thing he said was to laugh at you, now
improved on our repartee and cutting retorts since school. You cut me to the quick, Potter”. Somebody behind him snickers. Harry half expects to see the shadows of Crabbe and Goyle looming over.
Which sounds ridiculous, given his reason for being in this position, but he's glad, glad of the fear of falling that means he
even before Luna told me – so tell me now, if you did any of those things by choice, or if there's more, then tell me I don't know the worst.”
“No -” Draco's voice sounds distant. “We'd left. We got out, I dunno – seconds after I threw you the wand; mother kind of dragged us – she knew the Dar-
“Yes.” Draco stops, shoulders stiff, not turning to face her, staring out past the standing stones to the forests below - “Yes fine, alright, I freaked out. Happy now?” He drops his head and she can see the tell – tale pink steal up the back of his neck. But she's her, she doesn't care if he
Oh God. Something in Ron's voice tells him he already doesn't want to hear this question, let alone answer it.
They can't stop touching and that's alright with Draco; they were meant for this too, he thinks, to fit together, to curl around and about and inside of each other like they were made out of the same stuff and need fusing back together. That or they're just seventeen and horny as hell, because they've been itching for this for so long after all. Not even just sex, although gods it's constant and incredible, but to wander too far apart feels as though it strains on a thread Draco cannot afford to unravel to a longer distance just yet.
This is how she finds herself at the Ministry headquarters, and then, a silent, watchful but respectful Minister for Magic by her side, taking a Muggle car to a small house on the outskirts of Sydney. The journey leaves her almost obviously wide eyed; she wonders if this is how a Muggle raised child discovering magic might feel – the vehicle with the wheels that move without magic or animal power – impossible for her to fathom – how
“You know though -” George remembers, standing up - “You should talk to Harry. He's better at making people feel better than I am.”
“Mate, I know I said we'd beat you rotten – didn't expect we'd do it before we even reached the pitch”
he'll just break down and never fix himself again. He starts to come thinking about every rotten use they ever put him to, thinking about being awful, worthless, vile; hating that he has to, that once again he has no other choice -
him as a seeker. You know he wouldn't see a snitch if it was flapping in his face. He's a keeper – in every sense of the word. Bless him.
I mean – there's going to be a lot of memories – none of them easy -” she breaks off for a moment, a vaguely distant, haunted look in her eyes, then shakes herself a little.
“That's right. You're a mega bitch, the biggest bitchiest cow I've ever met, and no girl tough enough to earn the moniker of mega bitch is weak enough to ignore a summons from someone who spends half their life as a kitty cat, am I right?”
of – just so he could remind us how lucky we were – so we could be grateful and we were, weren't we? Grateful. Pathetic, just like you said.”
All of this rushes through Harry's mind in the space of a couple of minutes and it's enough to make his mind up – so what if Draco wants to stomp off and cry on his own? He can't have everything he wants, brat that he is, and Harry's not about to let him
She punctuates every utterance with cushion punches shared out between the two boys, who blink at each other sleepily and shrug.
“Shut up,” he mutters. He hates it when Potter looks at him like that – like he has never been afraid to make eye contact in his life, like he can see through every attempt at at projecting or deflecting he ever makes – like he
“I meant being the briggest, brightest, most obvious and obnoxious, Chosen One, not disrespect to seond cousin Sirius.”
let us forget what we owe your great and gloriousness -” he can feel himself getting angry again as he goes on – angry, frustrated, ashamed – and is actually glad to be interrupted.
“You took my hand,” Draco says, straightening up to find he's holding both of Harry's hands in his now.
“Weird is relative,” she says as she rises to go and they follow. “Try getting in a car for the first time. Shall we?”
by it. When they killed his erstwhile Muggle Studies teacher in front of him he could not scream or cry even when he watched the snake slide in, horror after horror parading itself in front of his eyes and no release for any real feeling. He had scraped through by the skin of his teeth and would never be able to let his face be the open book it was before then, or let tears come as easily as they once had. He looks out the window at the familiar countryside, feeling too many things to really hold all at once and cannot look at Harry or take in any of
and his cheeks burn hotly, his lip quivers and he snatches his arm away viciously, mouth twitching at the corners -
He tosses his scarf with unnecessary flair and stalks off back to the band. Harry doesn't care. He doesn't want to talk to him anyway and he
He moans again softly, wondering what now, and squints up painfully into the sunlight. Oh, Draco's in it, Draco
Now, lying in bed, trying to think like Hermione, he genuinely considers getting up and writing all his feelings down, logically like she suggested. He actually gets up, sits down, stares at a piece of paper, just imagines some of his thoughts actually looking at him with visible words and gets shaky at the thought. All of a sudden the oldest and most habitual idea seems like the best one – he drags the old invisibility cloak out of the bottom of his luggage and sets out on a midnight walk around the castle.
Unfortunately, Ron never got a chance to use it. On Wednesday, three days before the Ball, Hermione and Harry watched Ron training the team for the next Quidditch match. After they finished, she approached him and asked to go to the ball with her. Not really asked, she actually told him that they were going together. Ron looked so shocked that for a second Hermione thought he had other plans in mind. Harry just stood beside them and laughed.
-I hope so,-Draco said, but allowed Harry to hold his hands. Trusted him. It was flattering. So flattering that Harry started getting nervous and the clear picture of their destination he was supposed to imagine wouldn’t come to his head.
-Very well. You may sit down,-Draco landed on his chair and looked at his hands. It was over. Everything was over. His life, his dreams and hopes, ambitions and plans. Nothing mattered anymore, he couldn’t control anything. Except for one thing. He won’t let them see him cry.
-Draco! For heaven’s sake!- Madam Polkinghorne was holding a crying girl and ran towards Draco as soon as she saw him. Analise pushed the girl into his arms, cursing him for being late, but Harry didn’t hear anything except for girl’s cries and only after Draco wrapped his arms around her tiny body, Potter recognized angelic Lucy in her red twisted face.
-I knew it!-Harry looked out the window of his dorm and then at the clock. 11 pm, Sunday. Draco and Luna were walking towards the castle, discussing something. Harry tried to think of a single reason why they could have spent that weekend together and each of his guesses was more insane than a previous one. A romantic gateway? Draco and Luna? No way.
-HARRY, SHUT UP!-Hermione kicked him and he looked at her, not noticing a sharp angle in snitch’s trajectory. Suddenly it flew towards the ground. Dora wasn’t ready for such move and inertia carried her away onward, while Draco noticed it and made a move that made the whole crowd gasp.
-Coming!-in a second Pansy slowly walked up to them with a cigarette between your lips and eyes closed from delight.
House met them with indifferent silence and darkness. Harry quickly turned on the lights, but it didn’t help much. It was just the atmosphere, the spirit that inhabited 12 Grimmauld Place that made it constantly dark and lonely inside.
-Oh, you don’t actually think I don’t deserve to be here because of my blood?-with all the changes that Draco had been going through recently, Harry even forgot about his blood-related prejudices. And he definitely didn’t want to rediscover them again.
-It's okay,-Harry just smiled,-She's with Ron now, she's not the one to judge,-Draco smiled in relief and laughed,-She will kill me if I don't hurry up though.
-During the summer I…it was me who…,-Harry kept stopping and stuttering, still not completely positive if he even had a right to reveal what he was about to say.
-Oh, I’m not a Slytherin anymore,-Pansy gasped,-We’re all studying together now,-he nodded at Harry,-And we’re called…brace yourself…”8
Analise tried to pick her up, and only third attempt was successful – Lucy fought back with all she had. She started sobbing again and calling for Malfoy.
-Malfoy, yes. I’ll get us dinner, you stay here and…don’t be too polite to the portraits. They’ll get used to it,-Harry said and walked out, before Draco could stop him.
-I’m not,-Draco said,-We just got along right away. She said I looked like her brother,-Harry already saw some similarity between Malfoy and the girl. Snow-white hair, pale skin. But her eyes were bright blue and she smiled way more often.
The kiss ended so quickly that Draco didn’t even get to react. In a second, he was cold again and Harry was starring at him with pure terror in his eyes. Draco could only imagine how much fear was in his own eyes. He completely forgot about his mother, about Hogsmeade and France. It wasn’t like anything he had felt before.
-See you inside!-Luna waved and together with Ginny walked into the Great Hall. Harry was sure people would stare at them. But Luna was used to that and wouldn’t care. And Ginny seemed too happy to care. But then he imagined how people would stare at him when he walks in with Malfoy and a wave of anxiety that came with that realization almost knocked him off his feet.
-Morning…,-Draco was more surprised than annoyed. He put down the letter and Harry got a glimpse of beautiful careful handwriting,-What are you doing?
A week before the ball, he grabbed Harry and took him to Diagon Alley to get himself the best tux – tux, not robes – they could possibly find and come up with the most romantic way to ask Hermione to the Ball.
-I just have to talk to someone. Give me a second!-Draco looked around, but Harry seemed to have disappeared again.
-Yeah, he wouldn’t,-Harry said, unconvinced. Where could Malfoy even be now, 40 minutes before the ball? - It just came to me…,-Harry started, hoping to be cut off because the end of that thought was rather terrifying.
platform had never been this crowded before. For the first time in his life Harry got there by himself. Not with Dursleys, in their car listening to endless complains and insults. Not with Weasleys, hoping that floo powder will be enough for everyone. Not surrounded by aurors or members of the Order. Harry woke up a little earlier than usual, grabbed his bag and apparated straight from his apartment at 12 Grimmauld Place to King’s Cross Station. By the time he got there, Ron, Hermione and a couple more familiar faces had already been waiting for him.
When the match was a couple days away, Ron almost lost sleep. Having gone through the war, you’d think it would take more than a school sports game to scare him. But it was a pleasant kind of fear. It felt so weirdly normal to be afraid of losing a Quidditch cup again, not starving to death in the middle of nowhere.
-What’s tomorrow?-Harry held himself back from making a very obvious but very stupid joke, thinking that there is no way Malfoy would approve of it and reminded him about Quidditch tryouts.
-I’m sorry, Ginny. I just…I don’t think I’m ready for it now,-Harry sighed. How much he wanted Ginny to believe him now. How much he feared she’d think of his words just as a lame excuse,-But I still want you in my life. I really want you to be my friend.
-Not really,-Ron leaned back on the couch,-But it’s okay if you are. Have you even seen Malfoy today?
-How can you say that?-now he truly exploded,-After everything we’ve been through together, how can you say that?! I’ve seen you at your absolute worst and stuck around! And now you’re accusing me of this just because you weren’t the first person to hear the news?!-Harry was yelling,-You are impossible sometimes, Ron! Stubborn, stupid, unbelievably closed-minded! What sides are you even talking about?-he asked with a scoff,-I’m done seeing enemies in everyone, I’m done wasting my time fighting and hating people. I’m honestly tired of this,-his tone went back now, now sounding more disappointed than angry,-But you, keep that blindfold on, life seems easier this way for you,-Harry spat out and walked into his bedroom. Ron just stood there, replaying Harry’s words in his head over and over again, but still not realizing them completely.
Harry came back in 30 minutes, holding a rectangular box and a bottle of something dark. While he was gone, Draco took courage to examine the house a bit more. He walked through the large living room on the first floor, the kitchen in the end of the hall. Looked at all the portraits, recognized a few faces. Then he made his way upstairs. All the doors were closed and Draco didn’t open any. Same situation was on other floors and after making sure of it, Draco went back downstairs to wait for Harry. If he wanted to appear as a decent host, he was supposed to be the one to give the tour.
-You have to go now! Right now!-Filch grabbed him by the sleeve and started dragging Draco towards the door.
-Has anything changed?-Harry asked. Hermione groaned and threw a hairbrush at Ron who woke up immediately
Harry woke up happier than usual that day. He walked to the Great Hall confident to get the highest mark on his assignment; he already had a date for the ball, which protected him from girls’ attacks; and though he caught people whispering and starring at him, he was kind of used to it already.
-In a little less than two weeks,-Draco said, looking into the direction Potter was starring at. Harry may have been talking to Draco, but his eyes didn’t come off Ron.
-Not me,-he replied to Weasley’s question and it took Ron a second to remember what was it he had asked.
-No, no, no!-Draco rushed to correct her while blushing harder than Harry had ever seen,-As friends. Just as friends.
-Not them, you idiot,-Harry said. Draco still didn’t get it. Or pretended not to,-You saw that my house is too big for me alone…
-Not really,-what Hermione wanted to say was that she hardly notices anything except for the textbooks on the weekends since she has to be her homework and correct the homework of two other idiots she had misfortune to befriend, but decided to keep it inside.
Was Harry offended? No. He had other friends and mostly people were kind to him. And Draco did say thank you. He didn’t really expect any gratitude from Malfoy anyway. That’s now why he did what he did.
-What’s in this thing?-Draco coughed and in time, calmed down. He started reading the bottle, but understood less than a half of the words,-Is there some spell?
This one feels kinda random, but I'm doing my best to express all my favorite headcanons and thoughts about post-war Harry, who is - in my opinion - very lost, very confused and just has no idea what he is doing.
-It’s not. Look!-Hermione nodded at Harry. Ron wasn’t sure what exactly he was expected to do,-His hair!
-I think that’s not your business,-he said, drinking the burning liquid. It really is called firewhiskey for a reason. Harry expected Draco to be gone once he’s done with the drink, but Malfoy didn’t move.
Here's a link where you can find ways to help; donate, sign petitions or just educate yourself. Please visit it. We all should do our best to help.
-Of course. Father wrote about it in the new Quibbler. That’s why we need to be extra careful with who we take to the Ball today. The choice may end up becoming very vital,-Draco seemed to be at loss of words and situation got rather uncomfortable  as Harry still didn’t say a single word and Luna just kept going on about true love. Thankfully, Ginny chimed in and distracted Luna. By kissing her.
She knocks on the first upstairs bedroom door and a voice calls roughly to her to come in. Actually it doesn't sound much like Harry's voice but she goes in anyway. Oh, it's Lucius Malfoy.
is louder, the whole band moving in, crashing waves of anger in the tone and in this one Draco does seem to look out across the audience as though looking for somone to blame. Towards the end the lighting appars to paint lines in silver and gold slashes across his chest and when the false start hisses back into a whisper Harry could swear Draco was staring right at him. The lights go down and he feels a terrible weird churning of guilt.
“Then please – one thing?” she stands up to go and the last thing she says, hand on the door frame - “Don't forget
But then – then towards the end, there had been something else, hadn't there? Something way beyond schoolboy sparring and adolescent lust? He had come to worry about Malfoy, to care what happened to him and pity him for the things he had seen through Voldemort's eyes. He had come to see in Draco somebody who could have been him in different circumstances, somebody braver than he would ever know and better than he had ever expected, incapable of violence or real cruelty even when forced. When he had realised, finally, that Draco had never even known he owned the Elder wand and would not – he was certain of this – have known what to do with it if he had – his heart had softened inside him like a frozen thing unfurling. He had felt as though he had known Draco, from the inside out, along every stage of his struggles those past two years, that he had passed across the stage of his life, seeing just how full of subtlety and shade what he had taken for badness could be. He had felt almost as though Draco's life had been his own, that there was nothing to distinguish them beyond external circumstance. He had wanted to help but beyond the trial he had been barred from it.
“- that's um – that's probably fair,” he shrugs - “Show me where it is?” He looks embarassed, very small and very young, not only not knowing the way around the house he has been in for the past few days but a house that is, in many ways, more his than the rest of theirs.
When he can focus again, there's a hand on his shoulder and Draco handing him a tissue silently, and he is more grateful for that silence than he could say. He takes the offered hand that pulls him back to his feet and after a moment he sees Ron come out of the back of the shop, nodding at the sight of George getting a hug off of Malfoy.
from a different house, aren't I? People should engage with what's different then they won't treat it so badly. Personally I think the whole system is fundamentally flawed.” She nods decisively.
to Draco, actually talk – for more than five minutes, without wanting to kiss him at the very least, without his thoughts racing to wanting him, wanting to touch him, to be close – they were
He doesn't think about where he's going, too preoccupied in actually (shut up) doing what Blaise told him and trying to work himself out. It feels like he's been in a daze ever since Potter kissed him, like he'd imagined that happening so many times already it felt like it already had, but then at the same time it changed everything – didn't it? And what was that he'd bloody said?
“Happy New Year, you tossers!” Harry laughs, slinging an arm around Draco's shoulders who blushes, awkward but pleased.
“Some of these -” he looks around the gallery in wonder - “Some of these are quite famously presumed missing, you know.”
“Mr Potter -” she turns back to Harry - “Do I take it that my cousin left this house to you when he died?”
he wonders, hardly knowing. He looks down at his arm to get away from it, picks at a scab, so many tiny little pinprick scars and scabs from stratching far too hard for far too long, repeated too often.
there like this idiot's his life raft and he's so very sick of drowning and he suspcts that at first Potter's hands are on him to do the same thing – push him away – but he doesn't, just pushes Draco into a pile of stacked furniture and presses his mouth down on his like he's been drowning too, like Draco's lips are his only source of air.
There's a lot of it going around though. He sees it on Hermione's face now when she visits. He saw happiness – and a hint of something even deeper – in George when he returned from Hogwarts, bearing their eighth year Hogwarts letters. He saw it in Molly Weasleys sobs when Percy visited them for the first time – happiness, ready to spark in everyone.
Perhaps it's melodramatic of him; it almost certainly is. It occurs to him for the first time in a long time that after all, he's still a teenager, isn't he
“Uh – yeah -” Harry feels awkward suddenly, as it occurs to him for the first time that if the house had not gone to him it probably ought to have gone to her. “- Sorry,” he adds lamely.
who might make Draco happy and I wondered if you could tell me anything of how Mr Potter feels about
back then, wasn't there? I wouldn't have expected you to – well, you can't compare experiences, can you? Still the peacocks – they were living – father and I were in constant terror he'd found out how many we had hidden before -” he swallows hard - “I don't know why I'm still talking.”
“That is not quite what I asked,” she says, more gently than she has ever heard herself speak before, to anyone outside family - “Forgive me – Hermione – I did not mean to pry – or cause distress – I never had a daughter -”
Sleep has never come easily to Harry, but these days, he supposes, on the whole, that he's almost glad of it. When he does sleep it is lightly - again it always has been - but he supposes he is glad of that too. Some nights, like tonight, he finds himself staying awake long after Draco has fallen asleep, just sort of knowing it's going to be one of those nights. It's cold, for starters, and there's a breeze coming in from under the window. If it was up to him, it would be open a crack to let the air in – stuffy bedrooms have not been a thing for him ever since the cupboard under the stairs. He knows it's been about fifteen years but in these ways, as in so many ways, that cupboard has never quite left him - or he has never left it.
“You're not Harry Potter,” Luna announces. He stares at her, squints a little, sort of glares, looks like he does not know what to say and is trying to place her all at once.
“Bella told me – and these are close to her words- that she would gladly have sacrificed any children she ever had to the service of the Dark Lord. I do not think she approved that I was not ready to sacrifice even the one that I had.”
He needs to get up and leave this cupoard, but to go where? Firstly all the people in the room opposite will look at him and he can't talk to them about this. And he can't follow Malfoy because he's been told in no uncertain terms to fuck off and leave him alone and honestly hasn't he disrespected this enough already not to mention actively violated his personal space?
and the first cries he makes when Harry is completely inside him are pained, yes, but they pause long enough for him to breathe and after that – it's not even just the feeling of Harry inside him, his chest pressed into Draco's back, the tension in their limbs and the cool gritty press of the wall against his palms – it's very far from just that, it's the knowing that's it
“He's being utterly obnoxious,” she says, hands on hips when George Floos in. “Thanks for the soot,” she adds, waving her hand in front of her from the cloud he kicks up coming in.
“Oh god Ron, it's not that I don't wanna think about you wanking mate, it's just that I really don't wanna think about you wanking.”
“In a cupboard?” Hermione sits down on the floor opposite him, watching him with an overly penetrating look.
But she does not say it; Narcissa realises she does not want to help her. Well, she supposes, why would she.
do anythign else; pushing into him is like all the colours of every song he ever heard exploding in his head and if anyone tried to describe this act as fucking Draco against a castle wall he thinks he'd laugh and say he never did that, and then he almost laughs out loud for the sheer joy of realising that he
“That's alright, she doesn't like anyone – except those two. Sometimes me, and she's just protective that's all.”
She saunters out, smiling, almost bumping into Fleur in the hallway who frowns at her in curiosity. Luna gives her a thumbs up and skips aound the corner. As Fleur heads downstairs, Luna lingers for a moment, whispering under her breath –
have to – like if he gives in and lets himself be soft now he'll be vulnerable to anything that tries to break him and there could still be so many things. It was too difficult working for too long on making himself hard to just soften straight away. He might cry if he does and that's unacceptable – certainly in the presence of anyone who isn't his mother. Anyone else will just laugh at him if he cries, mock him, remind him how weak he is, what a pathetic failure, throw in a
it has all finally seemed. He has to face the sheer terror of it and honestly, it breaks him into night sweats for thinking about it, frightens him worse than facing down Voldemort.
“Manly,” Draco announces, dripping sarcasm. “Really. So. You're here, are you? Merlin's ballsack, it stinks in here.”
“Keep it,” Draco hears himself say it before he realises he's doing it, but he hands it back before he can stop himself.
“Nah, fuck that. I think we've all earned a good bit of self pity, don't you? Nah, what you should do is get a bath mate, smells like it's been a while.”
Narcissa finds herself at a loss in what was once her own house. She wanders back upstairs, thinks about knocking on Luicius' door, realises she does not want to apologise and is not going to speak to him until he speaks to her – a battle they always have after a row and one she always wins. She walks on, thinks about knocking on Draco's door but hears him moaning in his sleep and simply goes in. He
they all are. The adults with a whole generation between them and these kids barely understand, but at only a few years removed she rather thinks she does. They have all been forced to grow up too fast and it has stunted them, made them simultaneously too sad, too responsible, bluffing their way through feelings and actions while at the same time being stuck in childish patterns of thought.
he spits it out the same way Draco spat out his - “You started this. You were being a jerk. Now you want me to start listing your good qualities just so's to feel better?”
in fact hopelessly, stupidly in lust with Malfoy. For the first time since he was fourteen (oh fuck it thirteen?
“Come in?” A sleepy voice sighs with very minimal enthusiasm. “Oh -” the boy frowns when she does, sat on the side of his bed in a dressing gown - “I thought it was mother – what do
the Ancient House of Black,” Narcissa half smiles - “I grew up here – with your aunts Bella and Andy – then it was left to cousin Sirius and he – oh well -” she appears to shrug off something very heavy and more than one of the others notice her do it - “I suppose things like disinheritence don't matter like they used to. There's more to life than purity.”
there for some reason – every time he cautiously opens his door with the thought of going out; like the bastard's walking this corridor just waiting for him to do so. In fact
He exhales deeply. Potter's voice sounds cold, hard again and he can turn around without being too afraid of him, and
“We change. We make a place for ourselves in this new system and we stop bleating about what we lost. So many lost so much more and I don't see them wallowing in self pity like -” she stops herself from saying
Harry moans faintly, and looks away so as not to have to meet her sympathetic eye that knows and sees far too much. He
Shipwrecked survivors, they cling to each other as though the other were a life raft, shaking with the waves that subside in the wreckage all around them.
“Don't pee yourself, Potter, it's not a – I mean you know, just – do you know I don't think you ever said that before?”
Nobody is exactly rude to her at breakfast but she feels the iciness when she walks into the room and stiffens herself in return, pulling herself up straighter than ever, jerking her head up higher, aware that this will only alienate her further but knowing no other retort. The Potter boy at least makes an effort to smile at her and she is appalled by how grateful it makes her feel.
“And isn't it just your favourite subject? Listen and learn Potter – this was my father's favourite, probably because of the dragon part. I used to look up at it at night from my balcony and wonder if I deserved the honour of being named for those stars. I won't tell you the conclusion I came to. Anyway. Do you know what a binary star is?”
is the right word, because he sort of lied to Malfoy, didn't he? It wasn't that the morning had been
to be – the plump soft gleam and hard curl of those lips – how they would taste, if Malfoy would still sneer beneath his mouth. If those eyes would darken or glitter with scorn even as he got down elegantly to his knees – oh
recognise him, like there's a link between them, a cord, a spell, an enchantment that even now sets his feet towards that place where he is, even though it's the one place he's avoided like the plague ever since he got back here.
what it is Harry cannot break to him; it seems obvious enough and here he thought – he almost lets out a hysterical laugh – he'd really thought Harry Potter, sodding saviour of the wizarding fucking world cared about
“It's different for me too,” Draco scowls a little. For a moment, in the pale ray of August sunshine, a colour hovering between silver and gold haloing him, he looks very young, his eyes searching Harry's face for reassurance he's not sure he can give. “They'll hate me,” he shrugs.
sparring with Malfoy, be it duelling, fisticuffs or verbal always got him hard; he'll never forget how viciously and furiously he whacked off the night after getting thrown off the Quidditch team. He hadn't wanted to ever stop punching the git, and he hadn't wanted to stop at punching him. He's fancied the bastard since he first saw him get on a broom, the sheer exquisite elegance of him tracing a ladder to the stars. But then – then that same perfect poise made him
irritatingly under his skin. He couldn't save him before, he realises now he had a whole year in which he could have tried – but he'll be damned if he does not try now.
“Happy New Year, you tossers!” Harry laughs, slinging an arm around Draco's shoulders who blushes, awkward but pleased.
“I do – I want you -” Harry groans from how true it is, face in Draco's neck, trying to kiss his way across every inch of skin - “I want you. I want you
The first is Angelina Johnson, who Floos in one afternoon quite out of the blue and insists on taking him out to lunch. He doesn't know what makes her appear, what makes her think of him but she doesn't leave him guessing- it's not like her to beat around the bush. She talks to him about Fred, first and foremost – the thing everyone else does not seem to dare talk to him about as though it would hurt him, as though he is capable of hurt. As though he does not think about Fred anyway. Angelina does not seem to care if the memories hurt; she throws them onto the table with the salad bowls and beer mugs.
“But you didn't, I dunno – put me on some kind of pedestal like every fucker else, never expected anything of me – you have no idea how refreshing that was.”
want to help others be happy with as much as he can muster up a want for anything, which is why he says - “Okay, I'll do it.”
There have been a lot of mirrors over the years. He remembers them becoming the enemy when he was sixteen; of course he became drawn to them, not sure what it is that has always made his enemies somehow enticing. There was a fine line between vanity and self loathing and for a while there it was a tightrope act. He remembers – remembers seeing someone in the glass he was shocked to find out he didn't like; someone who was chosen only for failure, chosen for a victim – chosen – really, for nothing at all. After the war, he decided he never wanted to see his face red-eyed and tear streaked again, so he started with eyeliner. You can't cry, he reasoned, through intricate eye make up; it would be too much of a waste to see it go into streaks. It was the same with music; couldn't hear your own nervous heart beat, your internal neurosis over the sound of a good beat. His father had said it was vulgar –
The boy dithers for a moment before running off. Draco looks at Pansy with a raised eyebrow - “What?”
“Huh.” She drinks a juice, eats a toast; she does not taste things strongly, she suspects it is very different from how other people taste things. Besides, English food, what can you do? “He is not very interesting,” she decides. “I will have one one day but not for now. You can keep.”
He looks angry now, for some reason this makes something hiss in Draco's chest like cold water pouring into an overheated pan - “Fuck
He's grateful for her laugh as he goes because his heart is doing such flip flops, his stomach fluttering butterflies – he's not sure he could have functioned without that laughter. As he heads out he can hear Ginny's voice as she and Taz drift over to talk to Luna and Pansy. Nearby Blaise is seeking feedback from Ron and Hermione, Viktor more effusive in his praise than they have ever heard him. Harry could never have imagined this, all these so very disparate people getting on – it feels like a spell, and if it is he is fairly certain it is one that Draco has cast on them.
“I don't know why I told you that. It's nothing to actually fighting back, I know, not a big thing - but I'm not interested in hearing what you think of us – just in case you were going to -”
like difficult. Like on a test. Sometimes it's more satisfying for being a bit tricky. I'm difficult to like too,” she adds - “I expect. I never really thought about it. I think I'll go and see Harry now.”
didn't you?” Hermione's level of reasonable just kind of makes it worse; she follows him out of the Hall, once again leaving Ron alone with his dessert and struggling to get his head around the entire Harry/ Draco mess.
frowns now, swinging himself out of the bed and reaching for Draco. Draco closes his eyes – he looks beautiful and needy and he
“It's me,” his wife says. Time was, she never would have spoken two words so unnecessary, but she knows she has to now for reassurance. She lays out a small carpet bag on the bed and starts to magic things into it.
“I have heard so much about you, of course -” Viktor breaks off, aware of a rudeness and turns to Pansy - “And you are Miss Pansy of course, Luna's beloved? It is a pleasure to meet you,” he holds out a hand. Pansy squeaks and goes bright red. Draco cannot help but smirk; Pansy flustered is a sight none of them have ever seen before. After an excrutiating moment in which she forgets how handshakes happen she puts her hand in Viktor's – and it hangs there limply. He smiles and shakes for them both.
He shouldn't have kissed him. He should have just pressed it until the bastard talked or even cried – he
“Because -” he works it out as he says it and perhaps it is only for the opportunity to work it out that he actually says it at all - “Because the person singing that song, the character and the point of view – they're someone who hates the person who rescued them, someone who's over it, someone who gets to just
that sends Potter shooting away from him and himself sprawling back on the stone in recoil and leaping to his feet like a whirlwind, taking several skittering steps back, wiping his mouth like the taste of Potter was the worst and not the best thing in the world, and Potter's standing up slowly, wincing and staring at him in shocked confusion.
Of course Potter hates him, he does everything he can to make himself hateable. So it's good, it's perfect, exactly what he wants.
the headmistress yesterday – I need to test the entire pitch for acoustics – I certainly don't want -”
Moments and seconds. Harry trying to make it look as though he was not watching Draco at breakfast, checking that he ate. Narcissa making it look as though she was not watching Harry watch Draco. Lucius noticing the boys holding hands one morning, opening his mouth and closing it again with a sigh and a nod. Arthur showing Lucius how the telephone worked. The way Lucius looked at Luna with an expression that changed his whole face into that of somebody he could grow to like. The look on Draco's face when his aunt handed him baby Teddy to hold and the way Harry laughed and took him off Draco quickly.
Hermione folds her arms and glares at him, tapping her foot in otherwise silence until he groans an gets up.
“You think I brought you all here because I'm such a big fan of your family? No. No way – alright, your mother is – I owe her and she's decent – I think – but I saved you all because of you. You twat,” he adds, just to keep it light enough for Draco not to run away. It works. When Draco rolls his eyes and sighs -
of all places? But then the music swishes out like a wand casting a healing spell, the colours wrap around him in what feels like an apology, and Draco – the lighting makes his own dark mark stand out stark black on white and it doesn't look evil, it never did on him, no matter what he might have once thought or still thinks- just startlingly beautiful and edgy and raw, as though it was his skin he had rolled up not his sleeves, exposing his heart to the world. All of a sudden he's transported back to the Astronomy tower that night and he can see the fear and fury on a face trying to twist those things into pride as he exposed that mark for the first time and he realises with complete clarity why he ran away so hard last night.
Each footstep down the path to the pitch is like a snap shot, a memory, every breath a song of what a place used to be. These breaths offered up to the chill October air hover long after they have passed, plumes of frosty smoke left in their wake; here we go, he thinks, making ghosts of ourselves again.
“Right.” Harry's heart is already racing. “Of course – I'm -” he turns and heads quickly for the hall. In the kitchen doorway he almost runs straight into Lucius Malfoy and his feet feel electric with the need to run past, brain shrieking
But – but it's tempting, and his chest hurts for the way his heart fights back against the thoughts. He can't look at Potter, look at the bed – he has to stop himself when he realises
of us are, but not you. Please -” he finds his voice wobbling, a tightness in his chest he does not think would be there if it
he called it - but she makes it then reaches to open the door. Shacklebolt sees her struggle and reaches across her to open it and she is both grateful and humbled by this, face burning as she steps out.
He darts a quick glance at Potter to check if he's going to say something stupid. He doesn't, just nods. Thank the fucking stars.
“Maybe,” he nods. “Maybe,” and then to Ron who stops on his way out the shop to pick a gadget off the shelf - “And that's still ten galleons to you, mate.”
“I think Draco punched Harry,” she sighs. “I don't suppose that means that much for them – they do that a lot. It sounded like they were – um -” she goes a little red - “
“I'm not – they're up at the castle, sorting luggage; Viktor has about fourteen trunks of clothes, you know- it's fascinating. I heard Pansy was here so I thought I'd – but then I saw you two talking and thought that was nice, so I left it. So I'll see her when she gets back from McGonagall's office.”
“I want -” he says, muffled in knee - “I love -” she can feel him swallow hard, choking it back down whatever it is and she has an inkling, she really does, but she is surprised ot hear him even say this much; she was sure he
have been thinking of saying that - “Not with that hair. But you're smart and you have a really hot boyfriend now and it might -” she sticks her nose as high in the air as it will go and puts on her father's best and snootiest public speaking voice. “It might behove us to communicate more in the future concerning certain persons who may require our assistance.”
“Oh,” Draco says impassively. “Yay. Muggle festivities with Granger and the weasels, I can barely contain my joy.”
“Of all the awesome magical things we could be doing to usher in the new Millennium and you're all dragging me to some crummy muggle festivity -” he gripes happily.
“Draco, do you -” he feels like an idiot, like a kid, he feels like a seventeen year old boy, foolish and stumbling, god it's awful – also possibly brilliant - “Do you love me?”
“Good luck against the lynch mob!” so spitefully that Draco almost jumps out of his skin and so loudly that even Harry hears. He nods to the others by the door and runs down to join the Malfoys -
gets wound up faster than usual and every time, I remember – like I manage to forget in between – that -” he's saying too much, he knows, but this time he can't stop himself - “- well that – he was there too.”
“Draco,” Narcissa sighs wearily. “Meet your Great Aunt Walburga. Can't anything be done about her?” she adds in an aside to Harry - “Auntie always was rather strident, most undignified – you couldn't take her down?”
It's exactly as he feared; everyone stares at him. He forces himself to sit down even though it makes him feel positively sick, and for a moment he just breathes. He had hardly realised this – how scared of the dinner table he was – any table apparently, any group of people like this. He stares down at his hands, white knuckled and clutching the table edge – for a long while without looking up. Then he looks up, and obviously it's Potter, he's sat down right opposite him and though everyone else is doing their best not to watch him, this idiot isn't, is he? He's staring at Draco like he's an affront to their breakfast table, like he would quite like to hex him right off it. It is all he can do not to tremble. Instead he focuses on turning that chin wobble into a twitch of the lips, and it feels like a wash of relief when he feels it, and the sneer allows him to glare back at Potter across the table, sodding saviour with his fucking hero complex, Draco
” Ginny succeeds in impersonating Mcgonagall so accurately Harry finds himself turning round to check if she's not standing behind him - “
on the second floor. Well to be honest, that doesn't feel too weird; the top floor of the Burrow was always his and Fred's, not to mention they were bloody good beaters, if they did say so themselves – he's good with being up high. Flying off into the sunset in year five – he thinks – that had been their best moment, they'll never beat it. He frowns. It's really true.
“Lucius, sit down before you hurt yourself. Yes, I have to go to Australia and speak to some muggles. It should be for long, then I'll be bringing them back here.” She does not say
It feels like he might just as well have ripped off his clothes in the Great Hall and curled up on the ground, exposing everything soft – he could feel his own face screw up, eyes screaming
he feels sick being up here, like his left arm is itching all over again, he half conciously rolls up his sleeve, holds his arm out to stare at it now like it's somebody elses, not his, this arm stained with deep black, marred by the cresecent scar trying to slice it off gave him two years ago; he feels as detached from his own limb, as though it isn't even real. He frowns, trying to remember that feeling of pride, of tenuous importance at being
do that again if he can help it, he has been ever since that day in the infirmary. He can hear a muffled sob even from downstairs, and he sighs and goes up to where he knows he will find the idiot.
“Just over the next rise,” he finds himself murmuring out loud. It is the first thing either of them have said in quite a long time and Harry looks at him directly for the first time in a while, Draco looking back and raising a caustic eyebrow to mask any nervous anxiety -
to be, he always has. He closes his eyes in bliss as they kiss face to face, his hands on Draco - hips and arms and holding onto his shoulders - who arches into every touch with greedy ferocity and jerking hips and it is not nearly as long of this as he has imagined before he's hard as hell for him again and Draco repeats the order -
George looks around him at the foyer, the grand starway, the place where it happened, the place where he died.
and you didn't want to come back, did you? Even to be there for us. He made me take your place – he made me -” he swallows, unable to voice all the things Voldemort made him do, all the things that were done to him while his father was not there to protect him.
“It's not cowardly not to kill,” Harry shrugs. He has thought about this for so long it seems obvious. “Sometimes it's the bravest thing you can do – it was for you, and I don't care what they told you, it wasn't weakness – it's strength -”
(he finds himself gulping on the immediately implied togetherness) – should be looking for somewhere to live, just the two of them. He never even asked Draco about wanting this, and it is only the assumption behind this that makes Draco even halfway wonder if he does. He had still half envisioned himself returning to the Manor with his parents. In the end they come to a tentative decision to stay here, with the place looking so bright now, so inviting, it seems a shame to put all their recent work on it to waste.
Gentle does not last too long; he's too hungry, too desperate, he has to lean in, cover Draco's back with his body so as to stop himself scoring red finger trails through the skin, turning his head with his fingers round Draco's neck, feeling the life in his throat and kissing him hard for a minute, both of them swallowing the moans that drop from the other's lips. He might die if looks in those eyes again, trails kisses down the jawline, obsessed with the nape of Draco's neck, whispering in his ear as he thrusts into him -
It is all so much harder to relate than she had thought it would be, but honestly she is also taking it better than so many would.
“Yeah an illusion, you wanker! A glamour! A trick of the light, not an actual bloody incantation! I can't believe you even -”
“Not – really. Not always. No.” Draco prods at the ground with his foot a little accusingly, hiding the look in his eyes by glancing downwards. Harry goes to him, arms around his shoulders from behind.
at school with all the other memories and ghosts that dredged up. Thank god for the image he was creating, the sensation, the character and the mask; he isn't sure – in his room that night – if he could have got through the day without it. As it is he thinks he played it pretty well; he looks at himself in the mirror and cannot see beyond the curl of his own lip, the glitter in the corner of his own eye – he cannot see
“I'm warning you -” he feels himself fast becoming enraged by the proximity, flaring up at the very existence of Potter, half
Four days not coming out of bed feels like nowhere near enough to catch up to it all. He has his head under the covers when a knock comes on his door. He ignores it, hoping whatever it is will go away. He is still under the covers, like a rabbit in hiding, when he hears the door open and his father's voice saying his name. He does not move, does not reply.
he's so beautiful, so pale, skin so soft hiding all those sharp angles, and sharp angles hiding a softness in his stance, an acquiesance, even enthusiasm, no amount of posturing can hide.
“It's not even so much that -” George nods - “A lot of people – especially the Slytherins, have already made it clear they won't be coming back – there's been a lot of -”
“- so I realised – and I realise I was kind of slow – that when you disarmed Dumbledore you became Master of the Elder wand, and for all practical purposes what that meant was that

The court ripples with people chuckling. Harry only notices that Draco is not one of them. There was a time when he would rather have died than not front the
“It's not my favourite. I prefer the piano – and that one -” he points at the huge classical harp in the top corner.
“To be honest -” Andromeda searches her sister's face intently, and Hermione can see Narcissa doing the same, both of them trying to read each other, to know them like they think they should - “I thought you would expect
“No! Hell no! Get up! Look!” Draco throws the massive brocade curtains open dramatically. He does everything dramatically, though the curtains are so heavy there's really very little option. This is the room he used to have as a child, he told Harry, the first time he finally persuaded him to come and stay.
“No,” he turns back to her, smiling wryly and faintly unhappily, pale gloss lips twitching - “That's the thing, Pans. Not that your charming faux-psych analysis was wrong, per se – but it
Draco sniffs a little, but it's the only expression he cannot stop himself making; he manages to look otherwise like he gets personally introduced to his heroes every day.
Harry sounds on the verge of saying something else but in the next second Draco realises he has fallen asleep and with the moment and the memory and weight in his arms he realises the brush of the curtain in the wind is just the brush of the curtain in the wind and that there is nothing outside the door. Nothing lurks on the stairs or the landing, no ghosts by the bed or slithering in the hall and he's sleeping too, both of them cradled in the starlight spell of the song she spun.
They don't look at each other, just stand in the great cold hallway, clasping hands and looking – even to Narcissa watching them surreptitiously from the staircase above – like a couple of lost children all over again. She has always had a curious secret skill for empathy, and right now she can feel the loss, the difficulty and the hurt that these memories bring back; she has always suspected that they needed to be felt again at least once, remembered like the dead so the boys can move on. It has been half the reason she kept inviting them back here so insistently.
“Shut up. But you kept being a dick, didn't you? I wanted – I don't know what I wanted -” he sighs, walks into the living room, slumps in the corner of the antique green sofa. It occurs to Draco how easily he could just fuck off now, head back to his room like he had thought he wanted to in the first place but here he is, pulled after Potter as though on a string, as though he cannot fall out of orbit or he'll just plummet through space. The cord that binds them never has been able to stretch far enough for comfort. He takes the other side of the sofa, pulling his legs up and holding himself tight around the knees.
and she's afraid, volatile as both boys are, that anything that came out of their encounter might just make things worse. It feels as though they are simultaneously avoiding each other and keeping strict tabs on each other.
“He tried to make friends with you the first time he saw you, he told me, in Madam Malkin's, and again on the first day of school and it went down like a dicky owl. Like Errol. He went down quite hard, didn't he? Used to fly right into the wall. It went down like Errol on a bad day. And yes, of
“You have a favourite?” Draco almost sounds impressed, which means he actually is at least a little impressed but rarely likes to show it.
“It is though isn't it?” - bitterly - “It always is. I have to be the adult. I've had to since I was twelve. Sometimes I just get so bloody
On the whole, he reflects, after the Afternoon Tea Trial – it could have gone worse. Lucius will never like him, he knows this; but he tolerates him because he has to, he knows that it's only because of Harry that the family ever escaped Azkaban and he knows that he cannot personally take any credit for that, that he is forever indebted to his wife and son and now – to his immense gall – Harry Potter – for his very life. They do not speak unless they have to, but it is only ever frosty at worst.
“Seriously. Shut up,” he repeats, and is just on the verge of contemplating a quick wank and at least getting half a level of irritation out of his system when there's a knock on the door.
“Mrs Malfoy!” Hermione looks up from where she has been talking to the younger Mr Weasley on the sofa. She looks, Narcissa thinks, though she is not entirely sure –
She punctuates every utterance with cushion punches shared out between the two boys, who blink at each other sleepily and shrug.
Harry thinks, curling around his idiot protectively, Draco wriggling for a tedious length of time, packing blankets around himself, clutching a pillow, and wriggling his back against Harry's chest
“Yeah – should have said something about this before -” George shifts from his slouched position against the wall. “I talked to Old McGonagall about this, and she's actually disbanding the house system at least for the time being – definitely for your year. She suggested one amalgamated House – being that it'll be a lot smaller than the usual years -”
“You got yours over a scar, and I scarred over mine -” Draco muses. “It's like we balance each other out.” He says it with a tone of sarcasm that he does not actually mean, but Harry takes this as a good sign, if Draco can be sarcastic then he's probably fine. Draco picks up Harry's arm, holding it by the wrist and looking closely -
“Draco especially of course, but they're all struggling. I say keep an eye on them but I suspect that will go both ways. They'll look after you too if you let them.”
Madness too suddenly strikes him today as no reprieve – it was the Lovegood girl who had unmoored him this time – she was mad as a box of frogs; everybody knew it, everybody said so, she knew it herself. Perhaps it had started out as an escape for her once, but apparently even that level of craziness was no excuse for making the right choices, for doing the right thing.
There is a strangled sound from Lucius in the corner by the piano and a choked noise from Harry. Thankfully Ginny saves them all – except Draco - by rolling her eyes from her curled up spot on the sofa, head rested on Luna's shoulder.
“What?” he asks, because he does not see Draco until after she does, staring at him with a positively murderous glare from only a few metres away, nostrils flaring, lips twisting, eyes silver bright before he squeezes them tight shut for a second and half strides, half runs away down the corridor, fists as clenched as Harry's. Heard that. Of course he heard that.
to put him on a pedestal it was Malfoy. He wonders if that was why he always enjoyed their enmity as much as he did; he suspects, now older and a little wiser, that there may have been another reason or two but he's hardly prepared to think of that right now, in light of those silver eyes practically dancing as they scan him in frankly incredulous superiority.
“You first -” Harry hisses, dropping his head again to whisper devastatingly against Draco's neck, squeezing his cock at the same time - “Come for me, Malfoy.”
On these nights he feels so close to waking the sleeper and giving up all pretence of bravery. He wants so much to crack and ask for help at last – help has been given because somehow his need had made itself apparent. He's not quite sure how, he was trying so hard. He wants to break and say
and he pulls his left sleeve down with a savage yank, thrusting out his arm, the scars still visible, twisted after all the abuse he has given it over the years, red and black and white and blistered. He has that face Harry saw for the first time when they were sixteen on the astronomy tower, that face he hoped never to see again so, utterly full of self loathing and disgust, but he sees it again every time they have this row. He grabs Draco's wrist, half angrily, half melting, thumb gently stroking the lower edge of the mark. Draco tries to yank his arm away, but Harry holds on insistently, used to this fight by now and he keeps holding on quietly until the pinched, angry face begins to crumple and Harry lets his hand slide gently up Draco's arm as though soothing over the wound.
The worst thing about arguing with Draco, Harry has discovered after three years of marriage and eight years of school, is not the viciousness, the hurt caused, or barbs thrown. It's not how hard they can get under each other's skin or how predictably one of them – usually him -will end up wanting to punch the other. No, he's used to all this. The worst part is how hard Draco can take himself down these days, how suddenly and savagely he can turn on himself and rip himself to pieces, and that cuts at Harry like like a knife. He still remembers a kid who could never even have
“Nothing.” He holds his left arm protectively against his chest, right hand pressing down on the back of his left wrist, hugging it to himself - “Let it go.”
The exhalation of breath that comes out of Narcissa has to be the shakiest she has expressed in a very long time.
“What?” He cannot believe he's hearing his own objection - “Draco it's not – you're not -” he wants to say that just five seconds ago he was on the verge of bursting into tears, but you can't say a thing like that – not to
“Sorry,” Percy says. His glance skitters away from George in genuine regret - “I wish -” he stops. He wishes he
“Wars aren't just battles -” Luna smiles softly, sympathetically, places a hand on Harry's chest - “The toughest ones are fought in here. You better win – we were counting on you in the last one but you have to win this one for you, not us, you know?”
thought about it – have managed to look at the overall situation from outside enough to wonder at what was going on here, but she's trying, she really is.
“For Draco,” she almost half shrugs - “Of course. For the chance to get back to the castle and find him and because I knew that if Draco was alive, it would be because Mr Potter had made it so. Am I correct?”
he does not want to probe further, not yet. He thinks it looks dark outside the window which means they've slept quite a few hours – but it felt
“Of course you don't.” Luna pats him on the head; his hair feels nice. She does it again until he gives her that look which means somebody is finding her a little
all doing? Harry that doesn't look like Quidditch to me, and Draco – Pansy's going spare over there -”
“I am so sorry about what my sister did to you, Miss Granger,” she says, still stiffly, but perhaps Hermione catches the note of sincerity in the apology because something flickers in her eyes and she looks down before looking back up.
Draco shouts back, his voice very high; sweet Merlin, why, why so many shades of the last time they were up here? The tower was whole then and sturdy, and should not have been a place where so much could fall apart and come loose. It's crumbling now, half of one side torn away as though bitten into, but maybe – if he's really careful - something better could rise from this rubble than what fell apart last time.
“I mean – that is absolutely the least likely way I would have put it -” Hermione sighs heavily. “But. Yes. If you must.”
Now he blinks out at the night beyond the balcony doors, the stars visible even from their bed. Draco's eyes are glitterign like some of the star dust has found it's way into the room and settled on him -
“Yeah you do, don't you?” Draco stops sniffing him and screws his nose up - “You go straight to that Potter, don't let me keep you. Now if you'll excuse me I have a sensation to create.”
“Yes?” Hermione answers without turning round; when she does turn and see who it is her face snaps closed - “Mrs Malfoy,” she says coldly, closing her book and standing up from the sofa defensively, Narcissa realises, not deferentially. The girl opens her mouth for a brief moment, on the verge of saying
“Quite,” she says. “Then live for us, you always did anyway, you don't have to be a different person to change, not when the core remains the same. You live for us -” she leans across, takes his hand, it is the only thing that stills him, stops the fidgeting - “Live
Oh great. Fan – fucking-tastic. Potter slides onto the bench beside him and holds out a flask. He ignores it. So, strop witnessed by all then, inclusing the waiting Quidditch teams, and frankly fuck them – including

but as it comes to his lips, so it comes into his mind – the fact that ever since he can remember, people have commented on that stupid scar, acting as though it was the marker of his entire personality, in awe of it, heaping accolades upon him for it – everything other than anybody ever trying to simply kiss it better – like this was so simple nobody even thought of it. It strikes him as painfully
“Alright? I don't know -” for the first time her face quivers; her chin wobbles, and she glances at Hermione who scrunches back a
just imagining Draco's face if she tried, it makes him simultaneously want to laugh and die. Thankfully, she does not.

objected in fact, even in the face of the band's – albeit recent- success. Frankly, parental disaproval has long since felt like a form of encouragement rather than anything else.
There's the gleam of first dew on the ground glittering down below them as they fly, and there's starlight all around and above, and so far away and close at hand, the starlight brighter just now for the bright gleam of the ground – Heaven and Earth waving at each other in flashes of silver and crystal.
She gives him a look like thunder, but the others are all looking at her so expectantly she sighs - “Oh alright, then,” and they head back to Blaise and the makeshift stage.
what he has to hear right now, and he knows without having to turn that it's accompanied by Draco Malfoy swaggering up the pitch towards him, smirking at his dullness and stupidity. He turns to face him stoically, because – well because he always
“I love you now,” Draco whispers, as though he is still afraid there's a Dark Lord around to hear, and perhaps there is, in a way, the shadows in this room can never be entirely erased - “Isn't that enough?”
to be chosen, yes, often it is, especially if you are like Harry and you are not wanting this. But I see with these girls – my friends from Beauxbatons – it is so much harder
“Maybe,” Narcissa says neutrally, then she whispers a word the lady does not understand and she stops and blinks fiercely and then stares at her -
experience. Like euphoria – like – like when you've had a really good orgasm and your legs don't work and it feels like you've gone drunk, you know?”
“I -” there are spots of brightness in Draco's cheeks, the battle against denying it all visible across his face - “I
share a smallish tent for most of a year – if he's in a mood, better leave him 'til tomorrow. He can be a git when he's angry.”
“Sometimes I speak to Fred in my head – I mean basically – all the time -” George hears himself say, interrupting to put Draco out of his misery, something deep in him knowing that the best way to alleviate Draco's current embarrassment is to tell
“Yeah well,” George shrugs and adds the greatest compliment Harry thinks he could have had from anyone - “Fred would have said so too. C'mon you wankers, you can buy me a fire whiskey!”
For as long as they can both hold the moment, they stand there on the grass in the early morning dew, getting wet trouser legs, staring up at the stars and trying not to love so hard the feeling becomes audible, though it's there in each heart beat, on each breath that clouds the summer night air. There is only one way, Harry thinks, that they can ever have got to this point, and that is by magic. He wonders if that's why they still have to insult each other about fifty times a day – to remind themselves that this is real. But then insults have been the language of their love long before either of them knew what they were doing.
“Draco!” she clicks her fingers right in front of his face, making him jump - “Merlin's twat Draco, are you fucking stoned?”
sounds so very Hermione it hurts - “She was a queen who turned into a statue, then came back to life- I loved that play, it was so full of magic – and Hermione – she was so strong and patient and clever, I thought – that's what I'd look for in a daughter, but -” she stops. “I really don't know why I'm telling you all this.”
even if he was not reaching for Harry like a child grasping for a toy, breath takingly sweet, almost innocent even alongside such beautiful arousal – his voice would have killed Harry before it let him do anything other than what Draco wanted. He finds himself captivated by the bossiness of it, tingling electrically at the sublime arrogance, the certainty in that voice of getting what it wants – at the same time, he can hear a layer underneath that assuredness, a note that is more like a plea, a fragile neediness trapped in Draco's chest. It occurs to him that he is owned by that voice, body and soul and that he
had been thinking of just leaving, then it was very likely that so was Draco - he realised that now, unpleasant though it was to admit – their minds apparently worked in ridiculously similar ways, obsessive, stubborn and sarcastic. He swore internally – how would they – how
Harry does not need to be asked three times; he pushes his cock slowly home, Draco's body rocking beneath him, pushing back and pulling away over and over, unable to decide what it wants between the pain and the need to be filled. Both boys hold still, panting for several long moments with Harry buried balls deep inside Draco, tensing every muscle he has not to come straight away, loving the feel of it, getting used to the feel of it, waiting until Draco starts to push back against him again to move inside him. He bites his lip to pieces to keep from roaring, but Draco – well, he always knew he'd be mouthy but even then he hadn't been prepared for the absolute torrent of mingled screams and orders and swear words that stream from him, like he cannot stop himself.
Draco is shaking like a leaf when he sits back down, half reeling. The court adjourns. When they reassemble it is with the words Harry had desperately expected and needed -
“Flying?” Narcissa frowns, wondering why they expected to go by broom, then she remembers about the muggle flying machines. Gods but she feels like a child, foolish and ignorant. She remembers the day she caught sight of the Grangers in Diagon Alley and wonders if it felt the same for them then. “Oh,” she nods. “Yes, of course – have you – have you used a Portkey before?”
She stops suddenly, her face momentarily betraying how hard she has shocked herself. Lucius makes a choked sound of horror and objection, but stifles it under his wife's glare.
“Ughhhffff -” he groans, because he's been asking himself the same question and he sighs, the words coming out quiet, a little defeated.
Malfoy fronted a wizard glam rock band; he was wondering when it had started, if he could remember the band name, what name Malfoy was going by these days if it wasn't Malfoy. He remembered, if nothing else, why he would have ditched the name, at least for all public purposes. He remembers the last time he saw Malfoy, just after the trial where he had spoken up for them, saving both Draco and his mother from Azkaban. As he recalled even Lucius had been given a suspended sentence, even that which was reduced in the end to – he forgets how many years – of house arrest. He remembers the boy he had watched in the court room; he had watched him almost the whole time, the pale, pinched and frightened face he had barely dared raise, a voice he could hardly make audible, as though he did not even believe in his own defence. He had looked shocked when sentence was not pronounced, watched Harry like a frightened gazelle when he testified on their behalf. Harry had tried to go over to them the moment court was adjourned, to say something – anything – a thank you, a hand shake, a cessation of hostilities if nothing else. He had wanted to give Malfoy his wand back, to tell him what he had realised standing on the bridge outside of Hogwarts in that melancholy, hopeful moment of telling Ron and Hermione it was Draco who'd has ownership of the Elder wand all along. So many things had come together in his head, solidifying in his heart the moment he had heard the softness with which he'd said Draco's name. He had been ready, at that moment, post trial, to confess everything, to ask Draco to offer him his hand again, just so he could take it this time.
him. It feels as though the sofa is simultaneous incredibly long, with Potter far too far away from him for comfort, and far too small, throwing them too closely together.
she doesn't need to. Lucius feels himself open and close his mouth several times like a sodding goldfish before he decides against arguing. Narcissa, clearly witnessing him win this battle, nods in brief approval. She kisses him on the forehead and starts to leave. It's amazing, he thinks, how beautiful someone can look as they walk out a door, amazing how much he finds he could still fight to make her stay if it was forever. He takes hold of that fight and dares to ask it -
“Oh,” she says, about to exit the room as soon as he has walked into it - “I do apologise. I was looking for my son.”
“I'd argue if it wasn't true,” Pansy stands up, also yawning - “Merlin's tits I don't know if I can sleep here – you know what I mean?”
He remembers this now in view of the seemingly impossible order to come out and face this bright and terrifying, new and brilliant emerging world, a world that has every reason to reject him. A world in which he may after all
He supposes he has always known he would come back here eventually, dreading and expecting it and not ready for it, needing it and wanting it and afraid of it. But he remembers, with the shadow of the newly restored castle overhead – remembers how this and only this has ever felt like any kind of home. It does feel like coming home. He supposes he had hoped something else could feel that way, like the Burrow could, like a person could, like Ginny should have, but it didn't and she didn't and he can kind of understand why Hermione came back to finish her studies, why Neville started working here as soon as he could, so as to never have to leave. He wonders why he left himself. There is comfort in this place; in its walls and its earliest memories, comfort in gripping a broom in his hand again now and Hagrid waving at him from the hut down the slope as though he was on his way to his first try-outs on the pitch.
“Tell me how much – Potter -” he swallows heavily on the name, too intimate and not enough all at once - “Tell me -”
It's like he never left. But only in the way it can feel like he never left, while at the same time coming with the weight of three years gone. He remembers it all like nothing else – and really, he supposes now – like nothing it ever was.
with it – ill with music and the way it's left him washed out and shaky, his head full to bursting with the way Draco wielded that bow like a wand, sparking magic from the strings that erupted all around him swirling out in tendrils of golden colour. When he closes his eyes, because seeing so much that, after all, isn't really there is far too much for him – he can still see Draco's face as he tilted his head to one sideas he played, oblivious to all but the act of creating that sound. He thinks about the way his lips were slightly parted, the dark red of those lips dusted with gold and the startling white of his teeth. He thinks about the way the sunlight touched his hair, the light playing all over him, running itself all over Draco like it had the right to touch him like that – it seems to Harry quite frankly obscene. He's going to die of this. He is.
Ginny swears savagely and imaginatively and stomps off. He breathes again in relief, sinking back into the gold bath of music. It's like being drunk, he thinks, has to be what being on drugs feels like. Maybe he
he only realises the truth of it as he says it - “We're just kinda worried about you”. He is surprised to find this out, but he is, and he supposes if he is then they all are. After all, he agreed to this, if Hermione is helping she is doing it second hand. And yeah, damaged as they all are, none of
you're done with me, bloody well don't and see if I care. I'm not stuck here. I can go where I want.”
“Leave it!” he shouts so loudly he frightens himself, can feel himself shaking under his skin - “Just – bloody well leave me alone!”
still have something in common with that kid. If only the something wasn't currently smiling at him with glittering green eyes that look at him as though they care.
fuck him in the same house as the in – laws. He knows without a doubt that he will and he aches with how much he suddenly needs this. Draco clearly sees enough of a fraction of this in Harry's face because he smirks and stands up, pushing the stool in neatly and he walks past Harry, accidentally on purpose walking into him and whispering -
“So that's normal then?” Ron sounds relieved - “Thinking about a person, like bits of a person when you're – y'know – having one off the wrist -”
“After the show. Yeah. Do you know the attic window off the fourth floor North East stairway? The one that leads onto the roof?”
each other – I swear I don't know how you've all missed that rather vital point – he's big headed and arrogant and way too up his own moral arse and frankly so am I, so how people think that's ever going to -”
“Yes. Shut up. Look, love isn't normal; when I was little I thought I'd just sort of find some brilliant boy who lived up to my standards and marry him, you know, just – like you assume everyone does. But I didn't, I found two brilliant boys – and I didn't have to chose between them even though I spent ages thinking I would, then I spent ages thinking it would never work, second guessing myself, writing down lists of pros and cons for every scenario -”
piss off, all this warm air is doing nothing for my chiffon and glitter. I can feel this scarf going positively
The wave cresting inside him shivers on the point of breaking and his voice dashes in a thousand directions like scattering foam -
There is something horrifyingly healing in the way Harry touches him, something that almost makes him capable of hope – if only he did not have to be so adamant on keeping his shirt
“Maybe he can see me already then.” Luna shrugs a little, after all this makes sense, doesn't it? If he's asleep he could be anywhere, with anyone. She rather suspects it's not her though. Not really.
stupid and all I ever do is hate you, yes hate, that's it, absolutely -”” Hermione is surprised to hear herself playing along with Pansy's dubbing of the conversation. Pansy hides her own surprise with a snort before she continues.
Draco likes heights; it's like being on stage, being high up, there's a sort of power in it, the only sort of power he has ever felt much of a need to seek it. Maybe because there's so much freedom in it, sicne he has associated height from such a young age with flying. There is always something of that feeling of flying in it, he thinks; close to the ledge with the wind in his face. He should have gone into Quidditch, like Potter.
“Mr Weasley has explained the concept, yes”. He had even shown her the one in the house and how to use it. It was shocking, she realised, how much the wizardign world had to learn, not to mention dizzying how marvellous muggle things could be. She is learning new respect faster than she ever imagined possible.
“I – I don't know who to be, Freddie – I'm just – we're – we're FredandGeorge aren't we? Gred and Forge? How do I unravel that? How can I be me when we're us?”
“That's because you don't know him. If you did you'd know that Harry would never let anyone be tried unfairly or let them go without all factors being considered. Is it true then – that you saved his life?”
“Yeah -” Pansy nods, panicky - “Damn right I am this time. You know what I am Draco, everyone knows what I am – I'm the coward who offered to just give Potter to Voldemort, I'm the coward who got our whole house stuck in the dungeons and everyone else bloody
“She has eyes,” Luna shrugs - “They're very pretty, don't you think? I've seen her a lot. Anyway she tried going out with Harry before she worked out she was gay, so of course she worked out that he was too even if he didn't – or bi, maybe, she says she's not sure, either way it doesn't matter just now since he's been in love with Draco since first year.”
He thought Burbage was an idiot. He has told Harry many times, like this, curled up and sniffing in bed, half shaking, half still crying. He mocked her in school, scorning her classes – which he never actually attended - her appearance, her mannerisms, her views. He would have hated her, he told Harry, if he had considered her worthy of even that consideration. He thought she was ridiculous, backwards, a joke. He did
“Yeah -” he leans back against the heavy wood table, slumping his shoulders and curling his hands protectively around a cup of tea held in front of him - “Yeah it's that – it's just – it's just
Slowly, steadily, with the help of all of these people, George feels himself beginning to do something that feels like smiling, even if he does still feel guilty about it every time. He feels like the one left behind sometimes, the one who is almost rudely refusing to be fixed.
“You saved our lives today, Mr Potter. Twice, I suspect. Please do not feel a need to be apologetic for anything, my family and I are eternally indebted to you.”
she watched the woman's lips twitch in what seemed to be a savage interior battle before she asked cautiously if Hermione might be able to ask Andromeda to visit with the child some time?
and stirring in milk and sugar cubes until his hand steadies enough to lift the cup. He never takes his eyes off Potter, even over the rim of the teacup; glaring at him as he glares back, clearly too polite to tell him to fuck off in front of everyone else, but it's painfully obvious he wishes him a million miles away and preferably dead. Well, that's fine, the feeling's mutual. He sips his tea. It's too hot but that's alright, it's the first thing he's swallowed in public for a long time. One moment at a time. He takes toast (
means – as he props the broom against the stone and attempts to push his hair back out of his face – it's only barely sucessful, and Draco thinks for the millionth time, how he wants to be the one to do that. It occurs to him that if Harry was to simply push him into this wall and kiss him right now he'd let him, in fact, he wants that more than any other scenario he can imagine. The crackling air feels static around them for his realising this.
he's lying semi - prostrate on a bench at the side of the Quidditch pitch and that anyone who wants to can see him here and wonder what the hell he's doing but he cannot seem to find any kind of ability to do anything else. It's like he's
“Do shut up, Malfoy. I'm trying to say I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I just stomped off to my room last night and didn't try to talk to you. I thought it was what you wanted. I thought – look, I can't pretend to know what you're going through. I won't. But I meant it when I said I wanted to help. The problem is I love you and I'm struggling to see straight from it. I don't know -”
Harry plants himself squarely in front of him to stop him trying to walk off. Draco's nostrils flare, his lips curl -
The way Draco says it, Harry almost expects a burst of sunlight to come out of the clouds just in time to cast a golden glow across the house and surrounding parks as they approach the driveway. It doesn't, of course, not over this house.
and she tries, and she does, but still he looks lost. It's not his world now, and she does not know if she
“Shut the fuck up Pansy, what's -” a first year Slytherin student comes scurrying up to them and stop, staring at Draco for a moment with round, starstruck eyes.
Potter grabs the back of his neck in his free hand and kisses him; it's angry, messy and brief – just to make a point Draco supposes – he could have done the same thing just as easily as punching him and it would likely have felt just as good.
