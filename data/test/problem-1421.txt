“It is.”
Harry's mouth opened to argue, but his voice didn't come out. He felt some of the tension leave his body as he studied the other man's face. It was like the night before all over again. As much as he wanted to tell Draco no, he just couldn't do it. He couldn't leave him alone when he asked.
Most students could manage to get a few drops out or a weak stream. Draco already knew this spell—Bellatrix had liked making fires. Not wanting to seem derisive, he was still practicing it like everyone else, going through the motions that Flitwick had instructed.
"That- That might actually be enough. At least it gives us reason to question him. I need to take this to Robards now." Harry resumed picking up the files, stuffing them back into his bag.
At this point, Harry didn’t care if Malfoy had been the betrayer, he certainly didn’t deserve all of this.
“I was making small talk.”
He wasn’t entirely sure what he meant to do. Now that he knew where Draco was, going to him seemed like the right thing to do. It was only in his absence that Harry noticed just how much the snake had wiggled his way into his life. Even a few hours apart felt strange now.
“Alright, Potter, time for bed.” When Harry didn’t move, only letting out a small groan, Malfoy began to stir. “Your own bed, you git.”
"Oh, it's an icebox." Malfoy shook his head. "But, I've never seen an icebox like that."
Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed.
There was a small snort in the darkness. “I can’t believe I missed you.”
There was another sharp scoff from the other man that made Harry look up. “You know, just because I admitted to liking having you here doesn’t mean I can’t live without you. You’re only really here during the evenings after all.”
“Everything okay?” Draco glanced back to see Harry leaning over the back of the sofa, trying to look into the kitchen. “Oh, we don’t have anything, do we?” He started to sit up like he was going to get to his feet. “I’ll get-”
Draco blushed madly. The worst part was that he really couldn’t deny it. The last few days, he had begged Potter quite a bit but only so he’d stay in the house and not get himself hurt. “Please,” his shoulders fell, “just don’t scare him away.”
They finished up the examination, and Healer Sow declared Harry in good health. Draco was hoping it would take a little longer or that she’d want to show him something else, but it appeared there was no other excuse for him to stay. “I should go home, too, then,” Draco sighed.
Harry abandoned the back-and-forth to lean closer. There was an audible hitch in Malfoy’s breathing. “Did something happen between you and Zabini?”
Giving up on attempting to catch him, Harry stomped back to the elevator and left the building. The hairs on his neck stood up, and he instantly spun around. There was no one on the sidewalk with him besides a young woman trying to hail a cab.
"Are you sure? I don't mind. I can do trips."
Draco was a master of putting on an innocent façade. He glanced between Harry’s wide eyes and slack jaw and what he wore. “What’s wrong?”
All of his focus came back at once. He studied Draco's face as Draco, himself, examined his scar. He dragged his fingers along the whole shape, making another shutter roll through Harry's body. He repeated this action a few times before his fingers returned to Harry's mane.
Of course, no such event happened. Malfoy was actually very good at Potions even without Snape’s favoritism giving a helping hand. The private lessons did remind him a little of a regular lesson with Snape; there were undoubtedly enough insults. The upside was that Harry could now retort without consequence.
When she spotted the fireplace, she remembered what she’d been looking for. She went to open her mouth, but Draco beat her to it. “No Floo either.”
Malfoy's eyes snapped up to Harry. "You want me to come with?" he deciphered the rest of what Harry was going to say.
“I don’t want to hurt your ego,” Harry grunted, failing to sound as cocky as he intended to be. It still seemed to do the trick.
Once they were in his hands, Harry picked up his own set and demonstrated the correct form. Malfoy tried to copy but fumbled. Harry leaned over again and took Malfoy's hand. "The first one rests in your thumb like this, and you keep it steady with your ring finger." He manipulated his fingers until the stick was sitting right. "Then, you add the other." He put the second stick in and pinched Malfoy's index and thumb together around it. "Hold this one like a pen. Now only move these two fingers to open and close them. Leave your thumb still."
“Hey, Draco…” Harry’s words trailed off as he snatched up one of the biscuits from Draco’s plate.
Ron straightened. He crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes at Harry. “You can’t be serious,” he hissed. “Didn’t you just hear her? You’re weak. He can easily overpower you right now.”
With a fleeting look at the door, Draco swept his wand over the table. A small gust of wind pushed open the file on top. Draco looked down out of the corner of his eye as if scared Harry might walk back in at any second.
“I don’t want to take up room-”
“She’s still in the girls’ rooms,” Ron warned as Malfoy hurried to the door. “I just barely got past her, but try to be quiet.”
“Good afternoon,” Harry murmured, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist.
Not to mention the last line. Hogsmeade. Draco wasn’t stupid enough to go there. It was too far from professors and people liable for his wellbeing. He’d be a sitting duck for any curses or hexes. Although he would be lying if he said he wasn’t a tad happy that his mystery pen pal already wanted to meet him.
Draco smirked over him. “Goodnight,” he hummed.
Draco shrunk, but there was a whisper of a smile playing on his lips. “I’ve learned a lot in the last few months. Like how much I wish we had pens at school.”
“You heard me.”
Harry started back towards the couches, his steps slow as the shot of anger faded and he was left feeling even more tired than before. He didn’t truly care about his own fatigue, he was more wrapped in watching Malfoy’s expression. His eyes were dark and focused on the flicker of the fireplace as though it held a magnet his own metallic gaze was drawn to. There was a firm line across his mouth, and he might have looked bored had his jaw not kept twitching as he ground his teeth. Harry’s eyes moved swiftly over the rest of his form, all of it bound tight with his white-knuckled hands holding it together at his knees.
With a little jostling around, they put in the door pin and started up the stairs – Malfoy didn't trust magicless elevators. Soon enough, they were back to the flat, and Harry was finally able to begin dinner.
Malfoy didn't back down. "Just tell me where they live. I'm sure Pansy would love to curse a muggle or two."
“Only little stuff,” he admitted, now feeling like a useless show off. “I was without a wand for a bit while we were…off.” He couldn’t think of a better word for it without going into the long explanation of what he, Ron, and Hermione were actually doing this time last year. “I had to make do when I couldn’t borrow Hermione’s.”
Warmth rushed to the pit of Harry's stomach. He already knew he would be dissecting that statement later. By the wide eyes and flush on Draco's face, he wouldn't be the only one.
They sat like that for several hours, watching various weekend morning programs.
“Nor did I ask to share so many similarities with my older sister.” Andromeda leveled her chin to the ground. “Now please, put your wand away around my grandson,” she narrowed her eyes, “unless you prefer that I make you.”
Draco reeled back, clambering off of Harry to scramble to the other end of the bed. “This is a mistake.”
The woman surveyed their position shamelessly. “Really? I never would have guessed.” She gestured to the cooling skillet. “Finish making breakfast, and disinfect the counters when you’re done.” She turned on her heel and disappeared into the dining room again.
In a final attempt, she looked around once more, and her eyes landed on the telephone. “Do you know how to use that?” she inquired.
Their mouths practically touched the floor.  Pansy snorted. “Told you so.”
Everyone prepared to object again, but Draco spoke first. “Your internal organs are bruised, and no one has any idea what spell was actually used against you. You can take off work for a little while until we know you’re okay.”
"How is your mother?" It was as good of a topic as any. Talking about interior design wouldn't last forever, and Harry didn't want to get back onto the subject of Skeres.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “What’s going on Kreacher? Is he really sick?” A dreaded thought filled Malfoy’s mind as he considered that Harry had sent his house-elf to lie to get out of seeing him.
The healer looked to Ron for help. He started to step forward, but Harry put up a hand. “No, he’s right, I deserve it.” His eyes focused back on Draco, instantly softening with his voice. “I’m sorry.”
“No, you said he kept showing up at your house, so you gave in and let him eat inside with you and that he dragged you to shops.”
Laughter poured out of both of them. Harry was leaning down so closely that Draco's knee was almost hooked on his hip. Draco was too wrapped up in the gleeful moment to hear the words come out of his lips before it was too late, "Fine, prove it."
He started to gesture to the room as if to present proof but hesitated. The whole mood had shifted. Smiles fell and bodies got tense. Harry could feel Draco tensing against his back as well. He instinctively grabbed his wrist.
“Wow, you’re a miracle worker, Malfoy,” Hermione peeped up as she looked down at the E on Harry’s latest Potion’s essay. “Do you think you could help Ron, too?”
“Fair,” Malfoy called back.
The question continued to run through his head all morning. For the first time, he truly hated that they had electives first thing on Monday. When Transfiguration finally came around, Harry stopped just short of his usual desk beside Ron, favoring the one behind him beside Malfoy. There were a few curious glances, including from Ron and Hermione, but he ignored them all.
Harry got to the building, tapping in the code to the door and waltzing in. Malfoy had given it to him the second day after Harry had stopped apparating into the building, annoyed with having to buzz him in every time.
"I have a feeling if they're dying and you're the best chance they've got, they'd put up less of a fight."
Harry grunted a response, and Malfoy started down the stairs before he could get surprised by another one of Potter’s off-kilter comments.
“How is Lorena?” Draco asked as he took the usually forgotten armchair, despite Harry moving over to give room beside him. Harry’s face fell. Draco ignored it. Narcissa studied it out of the corner of her eye.
Harry jumped onto his feet but turned back as soon as he was out of reach. There was a look of betrayal in his eyes. “You don’t have to be rude.” He snatched up the book once more to bat at Malfoy’s arm.
Once, without thinking, Harry had suggested going to Diagon Alley, and Malfoy's panic attack lasted almost thirty minutes. They usually just walked the length of Park Row, going around the block if Malfoy was feeling bold, then back up to the apartment. It was at least enough to get some fresh air.
He barely got restful nights anymore. If it wasn't a nightmare, then it was a very inappropriate dream about the man lying next to him ― the dreams seemed to leave him more breathless than the nightmares. It also made it immeasurably more awkward during the day. Anytime Draco sat a little closer than usual, brushed his hand over Harry's while they were walking, or just looked at Harry a little too long, Harry found himself a sputtering mess.
Something roared in Harry's chest. He didn't know why but he wanted to stand up and smack Malfoy across the face for even muttering such words – which was, perhaps, counterintuitive. Maybe that was just his gut instinct when it came to his old nemesis. He hated seeing him so weak and self-loathing. This wasn't the Draco Malfoy he knew at all. He couldn't allow this to stand.
The woman still appeared unconvinced. Terry sighed and stepped out of the house, pulling the door closed behind him. “Sorry about that,” he muttered to Harry and Ron. “She’s a bit protective after everything.”
Malfoy’s eyes flared. “You don’t have to judge someone for wanting to live.”
She bit her lip, attempting not to smile. “I know how to use it. I’m honestly a little surprised you do.”
There were many things in that statement that threw Draco for a loop. Giving benefits to house-elves was one of them. The one he pointed out was, “None of you stop working, do you?”
Parkinson.”
He knew the answer. It was confirmed by the fall of Ron’s face. He didn’t need to hear the words. “She’s not sure if she’s coming. She has a big game this week that she’s practicing for.”
They tore apart in a second then bolted for the room. They pushed past the door and found Harry had a room to himself. His face was bruised and battered and twisting into a contorted shape as he wrinkled his forehead.
Harry didn't argue further, only rolling his eyes and shaking his head. He walked with wide, stretching steps over to the bar. "You could have sent me home." Harry's husky voice caught Malfoy's attention more than his words had.
Draco nodded solemnly. “You as well.”
“Draco spent the whole morning cleaning for you,” Harry said, dropping his voice and leaning towards her to keep Draco out of the conversation. He was busy sifting through the tea tin. “Honestly, the way he was acting I assumed you’d check his work with a white glove.”
They went up the rickety steps, further than Malfoy had gone last time. They stopped on the landing of the second floor. One door was cracked open. Heavy breathing could be heard from inside, occasionally broken by a whimper.
A firm crease formed on Draco’s brow when he looked back at her. “Now you’re just making up words.”
The conversations in the letters didn’t mention Draco again. However, they did become more frequent, eventually turning into a near-daily occurrence. Before Draco even noticed, weeks had passed filled with talks of other students, complaints of the new Transfiguration professor, or Draco answering questions about homework.
Both of the women straightened. Lorena looked at Narcissa uncertainty. Narcissa’s gaze was locked on her son, her expression unchanging. There was a pregnant pause. Finally, Narcissa dabbed her face with her napkin before sitting up rigidly. “Are you certain that is a good idea?” She carefully smoothed out the napkin on her lap. “It hasn’t been very long since your relationship became public.” She glanced between the two men. “The wizarding world is a stagnant, stubborn thing. I don’t know if everyone has come to terms with it yet.”
Draco’s bemusement was traded for a crinkled frown. “Yes?” he said it as a question.
Draco was just about to start stirring his cauldron counterclockwise again when he felt eyes on his face. He glanced up and found Potter’s blazing green gaze matching his. Potter didn’t look a bit abashed at being caught. There was a crinkle in his brow. His eyes flickered between Draco and Longbottom who now had his head down and was re-reading the material. The question was clear in Potter’s eyes, and Draco answered with a shrug before looking back down.
"Git," Harry grumbled as he dragged his feet towards the bathroom.
“What? No! You aren’t going in there alone.”
He blew past her into the room.
Malfoy finally looked up but with narrowed eyes. “How about you go stuff yourself, then, Potter?”
Grimmauld did to him what Grimmauld did best. He was swallowed whole by his own mind. Alone and in pain, he could barely leave his room if he wanted to, haunted by nearly two panic attacks a day. He almost apparated to Draco’s just out of instinct, but he was too stubborn, and he didn’t want to bother Draco again. He had wrecked that enough.
Andromeda shook her head. “No, no. She would have said… Narcissa would have followed that man into a burning building. She wouldn’t leave-”
She didn’t pause for long, certainly not long enough for Ron or Hermione to notice. “Yes, certainly,” she assured, putting the kettle down to search for the sweetener.
“I missed that pretty face,” Harry said as he ruffled up Malfoy’s hair.
“I’m fine here. It’s not even that late.”
“You would have been fine. You’re just afraid of what everyone is going to think of you.”
“I-” He couldn’t fathom words.
“Why the hell would I take you to him when you’re the one who put him there?”
Draco swallowed. “You quit for me?”
However, if he was going to give in, he needed to do one last selfish thing, no matter how much worse it made the pain. “Can I kiss you one more time, please?”
Harry was wobbling slightly now, and he didn’t notice the chill that came over Malfoy’s eyes. “Right, well, most of my friends just liked me for what I could get them. What’s the purpose of spending time together if we aren’t playing quidditch or studying?”
Ron scoffed but didn’t say anything else to her, which was satisfactory enough for her to leave. Silence lingered in her wake.
Another shaky intake of air could be heard on the other side of the door.
Draco pulled his hand away, and Harry thought he would pull away completely. Before he could even decide how he felt about that, he felt cool skin against his forehead.
He had given into his fate of staying up until dawn when he heard the creaking footsteps on the stairs. The shock of white-blonde was enough to recognize who had joined him.
Harry squeezed his hand once more. “I’m not going anywhere.”
when I don’t want you to listen to me talking about you?” Draco feigned deep thought. “I think I like that better.”
“He should really sit over here,” Susan spoke up at lunch one day.
Harry couldn’t suppress his smile anymore, and it appeared Malfoy was losing control of his own stoicism. “Oh, no!” Harry exclaimed. “Wouldn’t want to ruin that now, would we?”
Zabini raised a brow. “You just said one. Actually, you said several.”
Ron’s smile faltered. “How do you know that?”
Hermione and Ron were making a new effort. They kept him in the conversation as much as they could. Those sitting closest to them were Neville, Dean, and Seamus, all of which were clearly warry but went along with it the best they could. Draco did have the unsettling feeling that Dean was aware of what was underneath the table but he couldn’t bring himself to let go of Harry.
Harry only smiled. “I love you.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think I could care any less.”
Malfoy was frowning. “What are you doing?”
It had been poor timing. Harry barely managed to keep the wine from coming out of his nose as he began to violently cough after taking a sip from his glass. Malfoy looked alarmed. He started to get up to help the other, man but Harry waved him away as he pounded his own chest with his other hand. Harry was eventually able to breathe properly, but he could still feel the alcoholic burn at the back of his nose as he spoke, "No, I wouldn't say that."
“That’s true, but your elf did,” Harry pointed out.
Harry leaned forward, lowering his voice. “Muggle things don’t typically do that.”
However, Harry couldn't help but feel like it fit him in some way. This is what he would have been like if he had been a muggle. All posh and following the sleek trends going into the new millennia, with his old money and Oxford or Cambridge education backing him - instead of Quidditch, he probably would have done something pretentious like polo or rowing.
He made a straight path towards the Muggle-Fiction section and pulled the book. He was already beginning to flick through the pages as he made his way to his usual table. The letter in hand, his eyes skimmed over the words as he got comfortable.
They all slept a little easier that night. Harry almost considered the couple’s familiar, lumpy sofa to be comfortable for once.
“Oh, Jacob, the Hogwarts elves found this in the Gryffindor common room.” Harry opened his bag and pulled out a red jacket he’d recognized in the lost-and-found pile.
For the last five weeks, this was Draco’s life. Eat. Library. Class. He could barely even add sleep in there thanks to the nightmares but he was hoping that he could do well enough in potions to get on Slughorn’s good side, at least enough for him to spare some ingredients for
Draco frowned.
Harry only received a small sipping sound in response as Draco brought his mug to his lips. Harry raised a brow at Draco whose gaze was locked on a distant vantage point.
Harry gave two sharp knocks to the door of the Head Auror office. His body was buzzing. He had thought about this all night after he got home just a little before midnight.
She scoffed. “Too good.”
The floor felt as if it had moved beneath him. Draco tumbled into his chair rather than sat down, a loud bang coming as he accidentally knocked the book off the table.
Harry didn't really consider Grimmauld Place home. He hadn't felt at home anywhere since Hogwarts, and, after seeing so much death within those walls, he couldn't bring himself to return for his last year like Hermione. He didn't need to anyway. Kingsley had allowed anyone who fought in the Battle of Hogwarts to become an Auror – with or without scores. Becoming an Auror had seemed only right for him. He had defeated the greatest dark wizard of all time. Why wouldn't he continue?
“Did you forget something?”
It was agreed upon then and around noon Heather started getting ready to go. Her boss returned just in time for her to tell him she was headed out early. He had little qualms other than to give Pansy a pointed look and comment on her kidnapping his employees. She rolled her eyes in return but it held little malice.
Harry’s smile faltered. He glanced across the room where Ron was in conversation with Neville, Dean, and Seamus.
"I don't care about their opinions," Draco said primly. Harry began to attempt to reset, trying not to become too defensive of either side. Draco beat him before he could. "Can I be anonymous? Enough people hate me; I don't need Death Eaters breaking down my door, too."
Harry started towards the loo but stopped outside the boys’ room when he saw that his friends were out of sight. He looked back down the corridor. Malfoy was still there, a half circle of spiteful faces around him. Harry picked up his pace.
No one pushed it after that, including Harry, and Malfoy went back to his silent reading all alone in the corner. Harry felt something warm blossom in his stomach, not much unlike the feeling that once spurned him on to compete with Malfoy for all those years. A new challenge had arisen.
I feel like Harry should have a lot more issues from his childhood. I honestly don't remember him ever really talking about it to his friends other than mildly bitter comments. (Correct me if I'm wrong. It's been a while since I reread the whole series.)
He pushed it open without indication. It wasn’t an unusual act. People came in and out all the time to call for a cleanup somewhere in the ministry. Even Harry had once called on them to clean up the holding cells after a drunken Wizard had spewed everywhere. He hadn’t remembered seeing Goyle then. He didn’t recall seeing Goyle anywhere. Harry moved so quickly in and out of the office, in a hurry to solve the next big case that he rarely accounted for those around him.
“He doesn’t even trust me. In what world would he trust you?”
There was an odd spark of discussion between Draco and Heather about muggle medical practices. Heather told him about her studies in medical school which greatly intrigued him. Harry couldn’t help but think Draco, Hermione, and Heather would be a great force to be reckoned with if they all combined their brain power.
Within an hour, Harry realized just how much he’d missed in the last month and a half. He’d been aware that Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was up and running again; he’d seen it on his first trip to Diagon Alley to get things for Draco. He had yet to hear the story of how George and Angelina had caught up or how she was now helping out at the store. Percy was also subject to several teasing remarks about some girl named Audrey.
Malfoy fiddled with the long black silky sleeve of his nightshirt. “I don’t want you to think I just came down here for you.”
“Nothing!” Harry insisted. His frown deepened and shook his head. “It wasn’t my fault. Robards just sent me home as a precaution.”
room?” That sounded worse.
"Let's see."
He followed the other man back into the flat and cleaned up the mugs as instructed. Leaving the cups to dry beside the sink, he went back to the bedroom to change. He settled for a button down and some of better kept jeans. Draco was a bit apprehensive about the jeans but let it slide when Harry threatened wearing nothing again.
Zabini leaped to his feet to take Draco’s hands. “None of that matters anymore, though. You’ve been amazing lately. Everyone loves you, even the Gryffindors. We don’t have to worry about that.”
Harry nodded slowly. “What Zabini said, and what he did last night, it all just…” Harry couldn’t find the right words. He was barely grasping at his restraints.
Draco nodded. “You’re probably the only person I understand.” He finally looked up again and the challenging smirk on Harry’s face slipped away when their eyes met. “I wouldn’t have been doing my job right if I didn’t. Know thy enemy and all that.”
“You little—” But Harry was already on his feet and running down the hall. Ron was on his heel, Hermione’s calls to settle down ringing behind them.
“He did love me first. I can make him do it again.”
Harry shook his head, barely restraining rolling his eyes. "No, I think I can handle him."
Harry only let them take a few steps away, making sure they had stepped over a particularly large patch of leaves before he reached up to grab the back of Malfoy’s coat. There was a kaleidoscope of emotion in Malfoy’s gray eyes. Wonder, confusion, shock, horror, and then betrayal. At least Harry didn’t make him fall on his backside all alone, thumping down with him as he yanked Malfoy down.
Harry trembled as his mind recalled the countless times that his aunt and uncle had said those very words to him. He wasn’t special. He wasn’t different. He was just Harry Potter.
Harry snorted. “I think it’s a little different now. All the girls here seem to get off on it.”
“Harry, are you all right?”
“Look at me like that.”
Draco could hear his heart pounding in his ears. He nodded and was only confident enough to muster a muddled, “Okay,” before closing the door and being on his way. He knew he couldn’t actually turn back, though. He had committed to this. He would do it.
doing with my children?”
“If you keep telling me what to wear I’ll just say fuck it and strip down to nothing.”
“Not too busy with your new mate?”
"How?" Ron threw his hands in the air.
Draco’s smile faltered as he became overly flustered. Apparently Harry was just as good at throwing back flirty remarks as he was at insults.
“What do I say?”
This felt like some sort of forbidden topic, possibly worse than the Battle of Hogwarts. He wanted to say as much. He meant to tell the person to keep that sort of information to themselves, pressing the tip of his quill to a blank piece of parchment. The words were not written.
Malfoy’s grey gaze narrowed to slits, but Harry could tell he wasn’t seriously upset. His mouth wasn’t doing that little quirk that it usually did. “I am going to beat you one day, Potter.”
And suddenly, several things about Draco made sense to Harry. All of his self-loathing, all of his anxiety, his willingness to take the blame, it all came from this. The one time Draco had attempted to do something genuinely selfless had backfired and had the opposite effect. It was like casting spells with a broken wand only Draco thought he was what was broken.
Things kept getting better and better. Tuesday evening, Harry and Draco were curled up on the sofa together. Harry had his head in Draco’s lap as the television played though neither was watching; they were too involved in their conversation about a letter Draco had received.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione admonished. “You knew that, and you let the poor boy think you’re straight?”
“Git!”
With the food in hand, he went back towards Malfoy's apartment. He wasn't really sure what he was going to say. Maybe he could come up with a lie about having more questions. He could check Malfoy's wand, although Malfoy had likely used it in the last few hours, and only the previous spell could be recalled.
“I thought they’d wait until the last day to make the announcement,” said Parvati.
"Too busy for everything, then?"
Malfoy sighed. “No, I didn’t think it would help either.” Malfoy looked forward, his nose in the air and the perfect picture of a pompous patrician. “How about instead I help you with Potions?”
Draco responded with just as much sharpness. "Then why are you bringing it home?"
Downstairs, he found about half of the eighth-years. There were a few uncomfortable faces but no mutterings of a scandalous story after he had gone to bed. Something was still ticking in his chest like he was waiting for some bomb to drop. With no Ron or Hermione in sight, he left for the Great Hall to see if there was still anything left of breakfast.
Draco’s words had the opposite affect he meant for them. The sound of his name on Draco’s breath only sent Harry spiraling further. Harry lost focus on the buttons. He secured one arm around Draco’s waist, yanking him, as he buried his face into his collar. Draco had to grab the doorframe to keep from wrapping his arms around the other man.
Malfoy raised a brow expectantly.
It was Pansy who had broken the news to her. They had started frequent correspondents months ago when Draco moved away on his own, mostly to exchange notes on how he was doing when either one visited and to be certain someone was making an appearance at least once a month.
She reacted faintly, as if she’d just been shaken out of a daydream, muttering an apology. However, her eyes danced with knowledge Harry found himself desperate to know.
Harry inched closer, one tentative hand reaching out. Malfoy might have noted that he was not using his wand if his fear had not gagged him into silence. He might have started shaking had he not feared movement.
Harry made a rough sound. “I knew why. Zabini told me.”
He straightened his caving spine to put both of his friends’ faces into sight. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Harry could almost imagine Draco picking them up and joining them for dinner. He could picture the smug smile on his lips as he stole the chicken from Harry’s plate, showing off his aptitude. There wasn’t even a slight chance that would happen now. Harry would have to come to terms with that. He was just too good at saying the wrong things at the worst moments.
Harry watched with wrapped amazement. Self-healing was a tricky thing, especially when one couldn't see the actual injury. There were several healers in the Ministry's infirmary he was certain couldn't do that, although that was one of the reasons he rarely went to them - it was only after leaving Hogwarts did one realize just how great of a healer Madam Pomfrey really was.
Draco helped Harry hobble to the sofa, easing him down and placing a blanket over his lap with sarcastic care. Harry swatted him away, fighting the urge to smile again.
Harry wasn’t just complementing Malfoy and relishing in his fluster; he was now touching him a lot more, and of this sort of scheme, Malfoy never said a word. He even stopped complaining when Harry touched his hair, granted it was less of the furious ruffle as it had been before and now more of a fond pat or mild toying. It wasn’t one-sided now either.
Harry could feel Malfoy look at him and assumed he was deciding how to agree nicely. "I never said that."
The look in Hermione’s eyes told him she thought otherwise, but she did not voice it.
“Er, have you been feeling all right, Potter?” asked Fir.
“No, no!” Draco shook his head fervently. “I didn’t think of it like that at all. You didn’t owe me.”
It felt better to be at work, to be doing something that helped someone. It was strange for Harry to think about now, considering the past few weeks he'd been trying to get out of work so he could come over to Malfoy's. He hoped he was still helping someone.
Malfoy looked up with a firm crease pulling on his brow. “Why me, Potter?”
Harry pretended to pout. “Fine but according to the Ministry of Magic, it is Potter-Malfoy.”
Ron sighed. He shook his head, trying to push away the exasperated yet pitying look on his face.
“How long did it take you to make all those badges?” asked Dean, who somehow now had Seamus all but entirely in his lap.
Their mouths opened under each other. Harry could not think, could not do anything but drink him in, each breath as it came, the soft movements of his lips. It was everything and even more than what he had hoped for.
“Who’s slow, Potter?”
“And trust me, I know you’re a stubborn arse. I would not have forgiven you lightly, but I still didn’t expect you to actually walk out the door.” To Draco’s aggravation, tears began to cloud the rim of his vision, but he kept going on. “I almost followed you just to make sure you could get home okay on your own. If it wasn’t for my damn anxiety, I would follow you every time you leave the house because I am never certain you are going to come back.
Malfoy brushed a loving hand over the ivory upholstery. "Yes, but it
Ron gave him an incredulous look. By now he was used to Harry not thinking about it but he figured his friend would catch on by now. “Your birthday party!”
Once they were back inside the safe walls of 3B, they began to talk about quidditch and what they used to get up to in their common rooms to curve boredom. It was mostly wizards' chess and exploding snap. However, the Slytherins had a fun game of trying to annoy grindylows, which floated past their underwater windows ― the winner was whoever got one annoyed enough to run itself into the glass.
A few more plays passed before Harry finally felt Hermione’s gaze. He glanced up at her on the other couch behind Ron. The speculation in her eyes was easily recognizable after all these years. He raised his brows.
Draco sneered. He wriggled around, pushing away just enough to lay comfortably beside him. “You are such a child.”
A long sigh left Harry’s mouth. He should have known he wouldn’t be able to avoid the topic. “I might have gotten into a few rows today.”
“I love you, too.”
Pansy scoffed loudly. “Merlin, no,” Heather tilted her head at the odd expression, the boys tensed, “the general public are idiots. Give me your best,” she glanced at the chalkboard menu, “of whatever it is you sell here.”
“Your partner needs help,” snapped Cobris. “Have you seen the papers?” He pulled the rolled up paper from behind his back to offer it to Ron. “He’s obviously under the influence of something. It’s even making him hostile.”
Harry had returned, his cloak already ripped off and thrown over the sofa, his shoulders tense. He was slapping files onto the dining table.
When he got to the front door, he waved the usual
“Weasley and Mud- Granger,” Kreacher barely caught himself. The couple might not have noticed whether or not he had said the insult. They were both too busy clutching their chests and trying not to yelp in fright.
Another chuckle found its way out of Harry as he stared at this expression. He nodded. “Yeah,” he brushed a finger over Draco’s cheek, relishing in how soft his skin was, “I know how much my job worried you.”
I loved all of your comments from the last chapter.  I was smiling at my phone like an idiot all day. I hope you all enjoy this one too.
Harry blinked at her a few times, not sure where such an abrupt question came from. Nevertheless, he answered honestly and without further hesitation, “Yes.”
Her eyes pinched for a second as the end of her distant thoughts came into sight before she returned to the present. She dropped her hand from her necklace. “If I am honest, I don’t think he should be looking for either of our approval anymore. I would prefer that he approve of himself.” She surveyed the doorway which Draco had vanished through. “I fear that he never did before.”
Draco felt warmth pool into his cheeks. His chest fluttered.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t understand that. We’re careful. We don’t kiss outside of the apartment.”
Malfoy snapped up to his full height as if he was ready to yell right back, but instead, he pushed his lips into a straight line and stared at Harry through narrow eyes.
“I can ask-”
Harry turned away again, but a fleeting thought popped into his head and ran out of his mouth before he could catch it. "And eat something, Malfoy."
"Fine," Harry snapped. He dropped the food on the ground. "I'll leave it here and go then. Be a pompous prick as always, Malfoy."
“What was that about Gryffindors?” Harry called through twigs, leaves, and laughter.
He didn't like thinking about it too much. However, when things got too quiet and his thoughts got too loud, Harry found himself unable to breathe, his whole body vibrating with every emotion he attempted to suppress. More than once, he heard Kreacher's voice croaking to him, asking if he wanted tea or if he should get help – by now, the old house-elf knew to just cover Harry in a blanket until it passed.
Harry waved them both off before letting his hand rub circles into his temple. The other picked up his fork, but he could only push around the eggs on his plate. “Nothing that bad.”
Harry jumped to his feet and started towards the bin but it lit on fire before he could touch it. He spun around to glare at George. “I think you’ve got the right idea about not reading that, especially considering what I saw out there.” He gestured at the door, referring to the near fight he’d had with Mr. Hatch.
“Who?” Harry demanded.
Call me the one
All she had wanted for her friend was for him to be happy. She wanted to see him comfortable, for him to not be looking over his shoulder every five seconds, for him to put down the bottle and enjoy his life instead of running from it every second of the day. Now here he was, doing precisely that, and it made her skin crawl.
Harry noticed the only thing in the yard that had truly been forgotten was rusted pail underneath frayed rope swing. Weeds attempted to reclaim the area, burying most of the pail and attempting to reach up to the low hanging swing, likely fit for a child. He tore his eyes away. Sympathy wouldn’t help his cause now.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Of course, they did." He eyed Harry. "And you just don't want me to find out, or you're feeling guilty that I was right. Either way, it doesn't matter. He's been out for a week already. He's obviously either given up or is telling other people where to find me. I don't care, though. I'm used to it. You don't have to keep stalking me and bringing food around."
“I- I wasn’t trying to be noble or anything,” Draco insisted. “I knew what they’d do to you if they found out. I just didn’t want to hear the screaming again.”
“Maybe you should go for a visit,” added the dark-haired girl beside him. “Then you won’t have to be around us still tainting our name.”
He stepped up behind her and took the door from her hand. “It’s okay. We just need to talk. I’ll be back in a minute.”
The truth made him feel worse. “Master Potter has fits,” Kreacher said carefully. “He thinks he’s somewhere else or gets angry and yells and throws things. He doesn’t like Kreacher to be in the room.”
He shook his head. “No, I don’t mean physically.”
When there was no witty comeback, Malfoy looked up to find Potter beginning to wriggle out of his cramped spot on the couch. In a flash, Malfoy was on his feet. “I’m going to bed anyway.”
Draco frowned. “Why would they think that?”
Harry stepped into his path, his gaze stable. “We need to talk.”
There was a beat of silence before the pair chorused, and Draco’s stomach dropped. “Hogsmeade.”
“Since when do you draw?”
They never stopped spending evenings together, though, their little routine continuing like clockwork. The most significant change was Malfoy’s attitude. He seemed to have retained some of his old confidence after Harry brought him the potion ingredients he had asked for. The flat almost always smelt like something was cooking though it was a tossup if whatever it was smelt pleasant.
“It’s so soft.”
Harry shook his head, trying not to laugh at his own expense. "Shut up."
Harry began to shake his head again, but his eyes were clearer now. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s not all that bad,” Hermione admitted.
She held out her arms, and he dropped down onto the sofa beside her. Ron abandoned his game of exploding snap with Seamus and took up the spot Neville quickly vacated. “He’s a tosser anyway,” Ron tried, patting his shoulder gently.
Draco panting in his ear didn’t help his cause. “Call in sick,” he whispered devilishly.
It only took a moment for Ron to catch on. He dropped the chip he was about to put in his mouth. As if it was hard liquor, Ron snatched up his water and took a quick gulp of it before settling his full attention on Harry. After another quick scan of Harry’s person, Ron said, “So things went well I presume?”
Draco really didn’t understand why Slughorn had accepted him into the class. Longbottom hadn’t been in the N.E.W.T. class prior, but due to his desire to become an Auror after school, McGonagall had pushed him into the class to get some extra practice before sending him off to the Aurors. Slughorn, never wanting to displease any member of Dumbledore’s Army, rarely corrected him. Typically his horrid potions would earn him “you’ve almost got it” or “better luck next time” and a passing grade. At this rate, Longbottom was going to get someone killed one day.
“What are you thinking about?” Draco’s voice hummed.
He stuck his clothes in his drawer, put his toothbrush in the cup with Malfoy’s, and went out to the living room. Malfoy had added a pillow from his own bed along with a spare duvet. “I guess that’s it,” Malfoy said, brushing his hands together as he looked down at his work. “I’ll leave you alone then.”
“Too you,” Draco insisted. “You don’t know her like I do. She might act like she’s okay with it while secretly hoping it’s a phase. Either way, I want to hear it from her myself.”
Harry couldn’t see the smirk but he could hear it. “Actually,” he removed his hands from Harry’s head to scratch down his back, “I quite like the idea of him walking in on us,” he added more pressure as he neared Harry’s lumbar, eliciting a moan, “then maybe he’ll learn not to come by unannounced.”
The darkness seeped into his irises, and his pupils tried to help him focus on his surroundings. There was a figure beside his head. It could have been Ron. The shock of hair color beside him was not red, though. It was white.
Kreacher made a gruff noise and began to lead them down to the kitchen. Malfoy leaned towards Harry, lowering his voice. "I'm surprised Granger lets you speak to a house-elf like that."
Harry frowned. What was the point of secrecy? Everyone knew they were friends. Sure, most of their public conversations usually involved bickering, but no one could be under the impression that there was nothing more to them, right?
“No promises, ‘Mione,” Ron teased. She sighed in exasperation. He bent down to press a kiss to her cheek and grabbed his cloak from beside her. “Let’s go.”
Draco eyed his longest and dearest friend. The prim, pureblooded girl looked entirely content to lean against the counter of this muggle establishment, sipping on a cup of coffee that was clearly not wizard made. This wasn’t the first time she’d stopped by without them. “When do you come?”
Malfoy pouted at him. "I can-" He glanced at the menu once more. "Okay, yeah, the same."
Ron raised a brow. “You two are phone buddies now?”
In a matter of seconds, he began to dissect everything he had said and realized how insensitive he had been. Clearly, Harry didn't want to talk about it, he said as much, but Malfoy wouldn't shut up. He had been too furious at the thought that someone, a muggle, could humiliate Harry Potter in such a way that he didn't listen. Of course, Harry would be angry with him after that.
“Haven’t you ever thought about the fact that someone else had to tell me where Malfoy lived?”
Ron simply shrugged. “I’m not in any hurry to comfort the git, but she’s got a point. You are all he had.”
“Right, right,” Harry shook his head, trying to clear his panicking mind. “Of course, yeah. I didn’t forget. I’ll be there.”
Draco hurried over to open the door. “What the hell, Pansy? What are you doing out there?” he questioned.
Harry was too overwhelmed to lie. “No, just go. I need to talk to someone.”
Draco perused his lips and sat silently in deep thought for a moment. "You should get a camera the next time you go to Diagon Alley."
"It's okay," Harry assured. "No one gets it the first time. You can use a fork."
“You aren’t?”
Work wasn’t going too bad for Harry either. He was getting reprimanded far less at the very least. Robards even praised him one day for getting reports in more regularly though this was only because Harry desperately wanted to go home now.
She waved a dismissive hand. “He wants to be here for you. He’s just being stubborn. I’ll talk to him.”
He’d be back later, though. He’d find Macnair and get another dangerous criminal off the streets, then come back home to spend the evening with Draco. It would all work out.
He reached for the jacket but Harry held on for a moment longer. “What have I said about being careful where you leave things?”
Harry’s muscles relaxed. It felt like the easiest question to ever be asked, yet he knew what weight was behind it. “Yes.”
That had felt so strange, he told himself. He traded his index finger for his thumb and softened his touch, attempting to reenact Malfoy's actions. It didn't feel the same. Harry's heart didn't beat quite as fast as it had when it was Malfoy touching him. Harry's fingers were too coarse, too wide, too warm. He began to manufacture scenarios where he could get Malfoy to do it again. It was when he began to debate getting punched again that he realized how bizarre his train of thought had become.
Hermione Granger really was a terrifying witch.
He was a few pages in when he came to a stop. A piece of parchment had been folded and pressed into the book. Boredom and curiosity taking hold, Draco opened it. To his dismay, it was not some juicy secret letter from students previous but instead, someone’s Potions homework, stuffed away and forgotten.
"It was a scratch."
Only the barest sliver of sense maintained his distance. This couldn’t be all him. It had to be Draco’s choice. Harry had to know he wanted it too.
Ron snapped back to Harry. Relief flooded his features for the third time in less than ten minutes. “Oh thank, Merlin. I was beginning to question your sanity for a moment. So it’s only Malfoy then?”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “It’s not interesting. Why would I talk about it?”
“That doesn’t make any sense. You’re the Chosen One. Saint Potter. Everyone’s favorite. You have your own fan base. You can pick and choose whoever you want to be around.”
over it and stepped inside. The sound of clinking from the kitchen caught Harry’s attention. He hurried around the small lip of wall that shielded the entrance from the kitchen and found Draco glaring at the stove.
“Oh!” Hermione broke the stiff silence. “I heard from Luna. She still hasn’t found a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, but she still sounds very positive about it. Honestly, I hope she doesn’t get her hopes up too high. There is almost no proof those exist.”
He tried to move closer again, but Draco pushed himself even more against the wooden board. “Don’t,” he hissed.
“What I
"Yeah, I always have to go home before coming over to change into muggle clothes so I can get dinner. Auror uniforms aren't exactly standard muggle fashion," Harry explained. He opened the fridge to find the roasted chicken on its platter sitting on one of the shelves with not so much as a foil over the top of it. He sighed. He'd have to explain Tupperware to Malfoy later. "It's partly why I was so late tonight. That and I hadn't been expected to be at work at all, part of being an Auror, I guess."
This last thought was what made Harry stumble back. Alarm shot into Malfoy’s eyes as he noticed the other boy’s twisted expression.
"What? Now?"
Harry looked up at the man. “No one knows where Draco lives. It’s a closed file; you had to give me his address the day he was attacked. The only people who know are me, Pansy Parkinson, Narcissa Malfoy, Ron, and Hermione. No one who would have a reason to do something like this,” he waved the paper.
“You hardly know me,” Draco argued.
"It means he is a bloody git, and you know it,” Ron snapped without remorse. “All those years in school when he used to torment us, say foul things to Hermione.” Hermione cringed at the mention of it. “Are we all just supposed to sweep that under the rug like it never happened?"
Nothing on Draco’s face looked convinced. He was better at seeing through Harry than he could have ever imagined. Nevertheless, the lie that Harry was holding back was not entirely understood by himself yet. He couldn’t risk scaring him away.
Harry wished they'd been this close during the war, or even before. He could have used that smile back then. Instead, all he had were vague instructions and horcruxes weighing him down. Sometimes he swore he could still feel the weight of that horrible locket around his neck.
“Of course, Weasel,” Draco spoke snidely. “It’s the first time in months I get to sleep in a little, and you barge in like an erumpent.” He yanked the covers over his head and turned away from the open door.
“You know what I mean,” said Harry, sounding awfully like a complaining child.
This harsh emotion seemed to make more sense to Malfoy, and he relaxed. “He’s the one who hinted to McGonagall that she should do a room check. He told me last night after she left.”
“My life has never been private, Dray.” Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to ease the headache beginning to form behind his eyes. “They aren’t going to accept that.”
Her face relaxed. “Everything looks lovely.” She picked up the croissant on the edge of her plate.
For a heart-stopping second, Harry thought he had somehow been transported back in time, back to a place where he wasn’t allowed to look at Draco with sympathy, where his touch may be answered with hexes.
“Are you getting on, sir?” asked the attendant.
A smile played on the boy’s mouth. “That’s not a very good incentive to tell you.”
Malfoy stepped away from the counter and wrapped his arms around himself in a self-conscious act. "I don't know. I just buy stuff that has a long shelf-life. I use a lot of preservation charms too." He eyed the takeaway boxes. "That stuff doesn't preserve as well, though. Too many ingredients, I guess. It's not that bad, though, and Pansy or Mother come around about once a month and bring some stuff."
The uncertainty on Draco’s face transformed. He attempted to put up a mask but it was more telling than doing nothing. “What?” Harry pressed.
A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth, and he shook his head. “Only an episode or two, D-” Harry barely managed to stop himself from saying Draco’s name. “Er, it wasn’t my taste.” In actuality, Harry had found it entertaining, but Draco didn’t understand the humor, so they had kept looking.
People began to spread around once they got their serving. Many went outside to sit at the table which was still set up. The crowd in the kitchen had dwindled down to only Molly, Harry, Draco, Teddy and Andromeda – Hermione and Ron stayed close by in the entryway to keep their eyes on Andromeda. George and Angelina were still in the sitting room, Angelina spooning bits of cake into George’s mouth while his hands were occupied.
A tense beat of silence swallowed up the whole room until Ron broke it the only way he knew how. “Would someone please tell me what just happened?”
Harry shrugged. “He was. You just had the magic ability to get under my skin.”
Draco’s face relaxed with over-exaggerated relief as he started to make his way to the cot. “Thank Merlin, you were out. You’re a horrible patient. You always try to pretend like you aren’t in pain.”
Their initial steps were small and slow, which was usual, but Malfoy soon began to quicken his pace to unnatural speed. They were so close under the umbrella, Harry could feel Malfoy shaking and how he jumped whenever another passerby came a little too close. Malfoy's eyes were darting everywhere, prepared for anyone to pop up and curse him.
“I wasn’t.” Harry tipped him an even glance. “Not at all.”
"Not the killing curse, though," Harry urged. "That seems a bit extreme, even for Malfoy."
“I would assume so.”
"We can get you a nice little doggy bed for the corner," Malfoy said, waving a hand to the empty spot beside the television. "It'll be all cozy." He could barely keep a straight face for himself, feeling Harry's bafflement rising.
Draco relented. He eased his arm, and Harry gradually loosened his grip. When it seemed that Draco wouldn’t pull away again, Harry resumed pulling down his sleeve.
“Well, you know how you can be,” Ron said as though it was a perfect explanation. When Harry’s frown only deepened, he went on, “We’re just worried you’ll get Malfoy obsessed again.”
Draco’s eyes widened. He wasn’t an idiot. He’d known where she was going with this but hearing it out loud sent a shock down his spine. “Don’t make it sound so dirty. We’re only friends.”
Draco stared at him with wide eyes as he put his wand back. “You’re insane, do you know that? How many painkillers are you on?”
There was a knock on the door.
Harry appeared to remember very suddenly why they were there and Malfoy didn’t bother to restrain an eye roll. Harry dug into his pocket before pulling out the small golden ball. It felt like ages since the last time he’d touched one that wasn’t somehow connected to Horcruxes or the Deathly Hallows. It felt even better to have Malfoy be the one standing across from him with it in sight. It was almost as if things were normal again.
Draco was on his feet. “You can’t say that. Anyone who says those types of things to me inevitably leaves. I can’t– Please don’t say that. I can’t lose you, too!”
“Just fine, Lizzy’s already asking if she can go to her friend’s house for the weekend though.”
Boyfriend…
"Yeah, I think that's best."
"In the oven?"
The days which followed held a similar standard. Harry went to the office, even if Robards and Ron weren’t there, and did desk work for as long as he could milk it each day. He couldn’t believe he was actually running out of paperwork to do. He had to start skimming off the other Auror’s ― not that they argued.
Harry didn’t hate Malfoy anymore and it wasn’t about kindness or nobility. It simply felt tiring, like something that was part of his old self, the one that had died that day when Voldemort had shot him with the ultimate curse. There was no reason to hate him. There was nothing that Malfoy could do to him anymore. He could have just as easily forgotten all about Draco Malfoy and everything about their past.
“Not for the tea, you imbecile.”
"It's not going to bite you, and it'll only be for a moment."
Harry’s conversation with Teddy only a few minutes ago came back to him. He glanced at the open door, seeing the very corner of the sofa. He scrubbed the back of his hot neck. “I think I’d rather stay,” he admitted. He got to his feet. “My back has started to hurt a bit. It’s a comfortable sofa to nap on but not a great bed.”
Harry flexed his fingers, inching them just a little closer. Draco did not move. Harry budged his body a little more, and Draco remained still. Harry repeated this until, eventually, he could put his hand on Draco’s knee. “You know,” he said quietly, testing out a slight smile. “I’m not sure why you keep trying to get rid of me. After all this time, you should have figured out that I’m not going anywhere, no matter how hard you try.”
Malfoy sighed, finally closing his book and putting it down on his lap. “You aren’t going to drop this.”
Malfoy was bewildered at the sight of Harry Potter laying across him—and this time entirely sober. He was currently flipping through the pages of what was once Malfoy’s book, going far too quickly to actually be able to read it.
Draco gave him a sharp look. “Don’t joke. She isn’t that bad.”
Draco leaped from the sofa. He didn’t even hesitate to go to the door. It had to be Harry ― he probably picked up dinner on the way home.
Harry pulled Hermione to a stop. “Are you sure?”
Harry felt the mattress move again before he felt a leg rub against his own. He didn’t move away from it. If anything, he moved a little closer as well until he could almost feel Draco’s breath on his face. There was no other conscious movement or words after that. They both closed their eyes and let sleep take over quicker and more peacefully than it ever had before.
"No," Harry admitted. "We ended it a few years ago. We were both too busy for relationships." And Harry was too unstable to trust himself with her.
The tightness in Harry’s chest which had been fed by nightmares became something else very suddenly. His teeth hurt under the pressure of his clamped jaw. “What?” Harry snarled with such venom that it even alarmed Malfoy. His eyes snapped up, his brow creasing as he assessed Harry’s tight features. “He can’t do that! I know a few unlocking charms, I’ll go open it–“
"Yeah, yeah," Draco sighed, waving his hand. "Now go on. Save the world."
"Master is home early," Kreacher noted.
Harry took Draco’s hand and led him towards the house. No one so much as gave them a funny look. Ron called if they wanted to join a game of quidditch and Harry assured they’d be out in a little bit. He led Draco through the kitchen door.
He tossed the snitch in the air and it unfurled its wings. In a snap, they were both off the ground.
“Er...” Longbottom looked at Draco like he was about to speak but paused as another frown formed. Finally, he muttered, “Thanks.”
He slowly entered the room. His gaze was darting across all of the Doxy eaten furniture when it finally landed at the true focal piece of the room. It was a large, ancient tapestry. It looked well-worn, but the original splendor shined through, the gold thread which embroidered it still glittering brightly even in the dull light, connecting the sprawling family tree. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read: The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black ‘Toujours Pur.’
For a moment, Harry thought that Malfoy had actually left. Then he heard the slow creak of careful feet approaching the door. No one spoke from the other side.
Guilt’s slimy hand ran down Harry’s back, but he didn’t let it show on his face. “Yeah, you know I try to spend as little time around there as I can. I was probably just at the pub. We’ll definitely hang out sometime soon, though.”
His smile was wide, even as a wand tip appeared under his chin. “So you’re fine with it, I’m sure. You think you’re just his supportive friend, right?” He licked his lips. “You see, that’s why I wanted to talk to you, actually. I wanted to warn you, but maybe my concern is wasted since you aren’t even smart enough to connect the dots yourself.”
“The only people who know who weren’t in the photos are Ron, Hermione, and Draco’s mother. No one has a motive.”
The once dirty little house-elf Harry had reluctantly taken charge of after his godfather's death had become a closer friend than even Ron or Hermione over the last few years. He had attempted to free him, but Kreacher had hidden in his cupboard for nearly a week, refusing to take the sock Harry tried to hand him, begging that Harry chop off his head like his mother rather than disgrace him with clothes.
Draco was still reeling from Teddy’s first declaration. When he finally caught up, he was shocked to find that he was genuinely touched by Teddy’s generosity. It had to mean a lot for a little kid. “We’re friends?”
“Will you keep your hands to yourself?”
"I finished with the dishes," Draco offered. Harry didn't understand why that concerned him. In an attempt to satisfy, he gave a little grunt.
Draco wondered how hard it would be to turn one of his paper cranes into a dragon. Making it breathe fire seemed implausible for obvious reasons, but he knew he could make it fly around some.
Harry ignored his comment and went on. “I want to see if yours is the way I think it is. All pristine and ornate. You probably don’t even have a poster on your wall.”
She sent him a stern glare. “How do you know that?”
Ron threw his arms up in the air. Harry tried to bat his hands down, throwing a fervent look towards their table. Thankfully, the pair looked to be too deep in intellectual discussion. “Maybe you’d know that if you’d get your head out of Malfoy’s arse.”
Draco considered once if Finch-Fletchley was the stranger when the endeavor first began. However, they occasionally spoke of the Battle of Hogwarts and he knew Finch-Fletchley had not been there. He was simply a paranoid muggle-born, one who was going to drown the whole class if he didn’t calm down.
“Uncle Harry, Draco!” Teddy exclaimed. Andromeda jumped at surprise and released his hand. He ran across the room at the two men. Harry quickly swept him off the floor to pull him into a hug. When they pulled apart, Teddy’s eyes were green. He grinned madly at Draco, the roots of his hair beginning to lighten. “Hya, Dray.” Draco waved though a bit sheepishly.
A disquieting bout of embarrassment fell over him suddenly. “Actually, I don’t have an owl.” He scrubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t have much reason to keep in touch with the wizarding world,” he gestured to the white-walled flat, “and no pets allowed here.”
There was a light tint of pink on Hermione’s cheeks as she muttered something about “dumb boys” and started to pack up her things. The boys followed her lead, Ron packing down the last of his sandwich from lunch as he stood. They started towards the Entrance Hall and made their way to the Charms’ classroom, Harry’s eyes lingering on the golden light which filtered through the autumn afternoon.
“Okay, new plan, none of you talk to each other again,” Harry huffed.
Malfoy nodded slowly, pink blossoming over his cheeks as he tried to resist grinning. "I like having you here too."
The laughter stopped for a moment and then abruptly started anew, only now strengthened tenfold.
Ron shook his head. “Not that I’ve ever heard of.” He ran a hand through his hair. “I’ve never really thought about it though.”
A smile split Harry’s face in half. “That sounds better.”
“He’s right behind me. He was just finishing up a few more files,” Ron said as he tossed his cloak over the back of the sofa. There was a large smile on his face, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes.
When they finally got to the room, Harry swung the door shut, and Malfoy heard it click locked. “Show me.”
Harry stopped tickling Teddy, repositioning the three-year-old onto his hip. “No, we’re ready.” He looked to Teddy who was still grinning from ear to ear. “Do you want to help me blow out my candles?”
win again by allowing this to control your life.”
Harry prodded his lip and didn't feel the slightest bit of pain. Yes, Malfoy defiantly had some experience. There was usually some residual sting after healing; the last person he met who could do it so flawlessly was Madam Pomfrey.
“Magic residue on the bodies,” Harry answered, giving up on his attempt to be secretive with either of them, “and they’re showing up at wizarding locations. The first one was outside the visitor’s entrance to the ministry, the second in Godric’s Hollow, and the last was in Knockturn Alley.”
This whole thing was just a stream of thought writing. I have no idea how I wrote this much in a few months. Half of it was written in the notes of my phone. There are a lot of grammar mistakes but I'm working on fixing them. Hope you all enjoy.
The air felt charged, and Harry’s heart was beating in a weird pattern. The earlier conversation with Ron and Hermione still weighed on him. Somehow, it felt like Malfoy was aware of it.
"Bastard!"
“Malfoy,” Harry said slowly, “stay very, very still.”
“Ronald!” Hermione scolded, swatting his stomach.
Friday was not typically a night he stayed there, but Harry was not surprised when he opened the door and saw the soft splay of white hair poking out of the covers. He had gone to bed too early; he wouldn’t have wanted to chance Zabini being awake.
A rushed sigh left Harry’s mouth, his head falling to the side with something in his eyes that was far too pained to be pitiful. “It wasn’t out of pity for
"Well, I'm not a dog either," Harry said as he started to move toward the corner of the sofa that Malfoy had been in previously.
Occasionally, his eyes would flicker around the room, not out of fear but out of hope. He hoped that someone would notice him, that they would spare a moment of some kindness. There was a dull ache in Harry’s stomach when he saw it. He remembered being young and doing the same thing. He had watched enough movies over his cousin’s shoulder as he was doing chores to know about happy endings. He always secretly wished for something like that to happen to him, for someone to pull him free. Dudley had never allowed anyone to come close enough and eventually he had lost hope. Hogwarts had saved him in more ways than just one.
“Hey, what have I said about running in the halls,” called a plump-faced witch from the top of the stairs. They were already around the corner and out of sight though. The woman’s eyes lit up when she spotted Harry. “Oh! Hello, Professor.”
The silence that followed was charged in a way it had yet to be that evening. Malfoy’s wide eyes began to twinkle, his mouth curving so much that it looked like it was making it difficult for him to speak.
“Are you two…” Draco trailed off, gesturing between the pair.
"I slept last night."
Occasionally, the letter Draco received was not a response to what he had last said at all. Sometimes they felt like scribbled rantings done under partial light in the middle of the night. At times, they were very loose topics, something to get their mind off of whatever they were thinking, and other times they were very honest. They told him about his nightmares, about being chased, about snakes snapping at their heels and the world disintegrating around them. These were likely Draco’s favorite letters. He didn’t like reading about his stranger being hurt―and he knew these dreams hurt them―but it made him feel sane. He wasn’t the only one.
"Okay then."

While Harry was trying to give his godson as much attention as possible, he kept Draco in his peripheral as well as where Andromeda was at any given moment. Draco had his back pressed against the edge of the mantelpiece, one foot edging into the Floo. Andromeda sat at the end of the table, watching Harry and Teddy through careful eyes but also very aware of Ron and Hermione staying nearby.
“Hey, buddy,” Harry greeted, resting the three-year-old on his hip. He was exponentially grateful for Auror training. One or two more birthdays and picking up this child like this was going to become exponentially harder.
. It’s very good. You should read it.”
Draco stepped back into the flat. He should wake Harry up soon, or they’d be late for his appointment.
Harry still couldn't find an answer, so instead, he stupidly opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water.
“Happy Birthday, Harry!”
“Yes, well, I don’t usually come here on Saturdays,” she said. “It’s family day, you know.”
Ron’s face was now turning blue with rage. “How do you even know that Macnair was there? That isn’t public information.”
"Once a month?" Harry asked. His brow knitted into a tight knot as he frowned at the other man. "Malfoy, how long has it been since you left this place?"
This time the kiss wasn’t as mild. Both of them fed off the electricity, moving like they were hungry for more. Draco started to back up until he felt the grand piano press against his back; it only gave cause for Harry to press on him harder, which is what Draco had wanted. He let go of Harry’s hands to snake his arms around his neck. Harry kept one hand on his face; the other slid down his back, attempting to feel as much as he could.
Malfoy’s eyes shot open. He wriggled out of Harry’s grip, shoving himself to the other side of the bed. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” he croaked.
"What about your friends?"
“No, you need to rest, or you’ll never heal,” Draco urged.
Molly attempted to be polite and start up a few conversations with Draco. It was losing battle. He wasn’t trying to be rude but too many walls were built up and his brain was fuzzy. The only thing he could really focus on was examining the Weasley house.
Draco pushed the photos away, starting through the files. The wizarding world had a poor form of forensics. It seemed they usually just followed the smell of magic and hoped the person at the end of it was the guilty party. There were some notes, though.
Harry nodded rapidly. “Yes, thankfully. I’m not sure how I could have faced him with that information.”
Draco shrugged, looking down at his hands. “She might already know.”
Ron raised a brow. “Yeah, the one for your godson,” Ron prodded, “at Andy’s? You are the one who volunteered Hermione and me to bring the cake. Which was a horrible idea, by the way, you know neither of us can bake.”
The following days were difficult. Harry was definitely getting better, but he still couldn’t do much on his own, which drove him mad. He could barely sit still anymore. Draco had to do less healing and more entertaining, continually trying to distract Harry with the TV or games or anything else he could think of.
A cold shock ran down Draco’s chest, and he reeled back. He didn’t have the stomach to even feign being polite. “Fuck off.”
Did they know what the Headmistress’s favorite sweet was already?
Malfoy tensed up. He shifted his weight in the chair. "What for?"
Draco’s mouth felt dry.
Draco grabbed a pinch of leftover chopped-up daisies. “Longbottom.”
Harry threw an arm towards the ceiling, gesturing in the direction of the boys’ dorms. “Go to my room! Talking to you has already made my tea go cold.”
Kreacher’s shoulders fell. He offered the wand back. “Kreacher apologizes. Kreacher has been told to defend himself against wizards because Master Potter often forgets where he is.”
About the only source of conflict between them was Harry's job. Draco was getting sick of healing Harry almost every day. He doubted if any of the other Aurors came home with as many cuts and bruises as Harry did. Leave it up to the savior of the wizarding world to not know when to exercises some sort of precaution. He honestly had no self-preservation skills whatsoever.
“What are you doing here?” Ron snapped as he stomped down the hall, almost a meter ahead of Draco.
