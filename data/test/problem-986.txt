Harry debated his opinions; he could quickly draw the curtains around his bed and cast a silencing charm. Something he would’ve thought twice of doing back in Gryffindor. However, he wasn’t a teenager anymore. Well, technically, he was still a teenager by age. He was only eighteen. He just didn’t feel like one. He felt older. It didn’t feel right to jerk off anymore in a dorm room with other guys around. He much rather takes care of his needs in private. So with his erection still making itself known, Harry quickly and quietly rose to his feet, grabbing a towel and his toiletry bag off of the top of his trunk and heading out into the hallway. He didn’t bother with his glasses, leaving them on the nightstand beside the bed. He then headed to the shared boy's bathroom at the end of the hallway.
“Hogwarts is home for me, as I imagine it is to you. It is important now that we stick together, just as we did then. We must lean on one another for support. Many of our professors will be offering office hours, which can be used for help with course work of course, but also may be used to talk to someone. I would like each and every one of you to know that you are not alone. Not while you are here.” The headmistress looks at Harry now.
A few weeks later Professor Sickawell, the new DADA professor asks Harry to stay after class. Harry doesn’t really know much about him, just that his first name is Henry. “Mister Potter, Ive heard a few rumors you’d like to become a defense against the dark arts professor yourself one day. Is this true?” Harry blanks a little, hope he doesn’t think he wants to take his job from him. Harry just nods, Professor Sickawell claps his hands together once. “Wonderful!” This reaction takes Harry by surprise a little.
Everyone is quiet as he continues. “Ronald, the insults I have thrown at you and your family were terribly wrong of me. I see now you are all very good people and I was, well an arse.” Harry snorts, Hermione throws a pillow at him. “I regret all of the things I have done to you, all of you.” Ron stays seated for a moment but stands and extends his hand. “Wasn’t always just you being an arse, mate. I’m sorry too.” Draco shakes his hand, Ron claps his hand on the back of his, seemingly sealing the deal.
They all sit and chat for about half an hour before Draco actually speaks. “Not to ruin the mood but,” Harry looks over to him, Draco's looking at Ron and Hermione. “I owe you two so many apologies. Hermione, I am so terribly sorry for the things I did. I should never have called you
“He brought home a bloke and I just,” He looks down at his hands. “I’m so utterly jealous I feel like vomiting or crying and I don’t know what to do,” he lets out in almost a whisper. Pansy kicks him under the table. “You idiot!” Harry looks offended, Pansy just laughs in exasperation.
Not only was he doing well academically, he’d made time for his friends and even gone to visit Teddy, who was living with Andromeda, a couple times in his first month back. It was nice. He felt like a person. Of course, he still wasn’t exactly okay. He’d wake up sweating, sometimes woke Ron up with his screams. Sometimes Ron woke him with his own screams. Those nights they’d simply set a light and Harry would dig up his muggle cd player and they’d listen to music until they both fell asleep again.
While on the run the thing Hermione sorely missed was school, she’d missed learning, her professors though some of them weren’t coming back, most of all she’d missed feeling like she was earning her spot in the world. The train ride itself was a bit eventful, little kids, first through third years gathered outside their door, wanting to see the Saviour himself. Hermione had conjured a few curtains to block them out and they’d gone to bother someone else. In their cabin contained the trio, Ginny, Luna and Neville, it was a tad bit cramped but Harry felt at home. These were his people, his friends, his family.
“You alright there?” Draco asks as Harry walks up to him. “Never better, say what are your plans for tomorrow?” Draco looks a bit confused. “Nothing much, why?” Harry smiles. “Would you like to go on a date with me?” He asks suddenly a bit unsure of himself. Draco’s cheeks go a bit pink and he nods. Harry, satisfies with himself, plops down next to him. “Why now?” Draco inquires. “Cause I found out my crush wasn’t so hopeless,” Harry smiles at Pansy, who’s looking out through the window.
They’ve reached the door now and Harry realizes that Professor Mcgonagall has been as much of a parent to him as Sirius. “Professor, may i ask something of you?” Harry asks, his mind going to the future. “Anything Mister Potter.” He takes a beat before he begins. “I would like to follow in the steps of Remus. I would like to earn my place and become a professor here, possibly of defense against the dark arts. Could you give me any advice on how to go about this?”
The last one looks to be homemade, he opens it, curious and his breathe is a bit taken away. The first page is a drawing of Harry and their friends, the flips the pages to see portraits of all of them, drawings of thestrals, the quidditch pitch, Hagrid, Mcgonagall and the last page, it makes tears prick his eyes. It’s a drawing of Sirius and Remus, though Draco had only met Sirius once, the two of them waving and smiling. A tear slips down without his permission and he looks up at Draco, he can’t help it and pulls him into a tight hug. “Thank you,” He whispers into his ear and feels Draco nod. “Anything for you, Harry.”
“What is it with you and animals? Seems like you attract them or something.” This makes Harry chuckle too, he’d heard this a million times from Luna and Hagrid. “Couldn’t tell you, amazes Luna and Hagrid though. Back when I’d live with my Aunt and Uncle there were these stray neighborhood cats I’d always see. I’d bring them table scraps and more than once I’d wake and find one of them on my windowsill. They never did like the Dursley’s funnily enough.”
So, for the last time the Golden Trio boards the Hogwarts express as students. Ron is almost positive he wants to be an Auror, he feels a fierce sense of needing to protect innocent people from losing their lives like Fred, or losing their families like him and Teddy, but he comes along anyways. Says he wants a last normal year, but they all know he can’t bear the thought of sending Hermione back to the sight of the battle, where she almost died, where they all almost died, all alone. Ever the protective one, Ron was.
“My mother and I are safe. Thanks to you, Harry, I got a second chance at my life.” Harry doesn’t shake his hand. He pulls him in for a hug. “I am so sorry for that day in the bathroom,” Harry whispers and a tear slips down Draco’s cheek. “Me too.” They break away and Pansy stares at her hands. “Harry,” she starts. “I’m not quite as eloquent as Draco, but while we’re at apologies, I would like to apologize for that day before the battle. I was terrified, but that’s no excuse.” Harry stands and extends his hand to her. “Past is in the past right?” He says sheepishly and she shakes his hand.
When they walk into the portrait out thirty house elves surround them, asking what they need. “Kreacher is Harry Potters elf! Not you!” Kreacher yells over them and pushes his way to the front. “Hey Kreach, you doin well today?” Harry asks and let’s Kreacher lead him and Draco to the other side of the room. “Much better now that you’re here Harry! Kreacher has become very accustomed to seeing you every day over the summer, Kreacher does miss you!” Harry chuckles and digs in his bag for a moment before pulling out a bag of taffy, Kreacher favorite they’d discovered.
Someone is shaking him, his eyes fly open with a gasp and he bolts upright, nearly knocking Ron off of his bed. "Bad one tonight, mate?" Ron asks softly, handing him his glasses. Harry's hands shake too bad and he drops them on the bed, Ron slides them gently onto his face for him. "Thanks," his voice is quiet and shaky, he wipes away tears from his face and sighs. "Did I wake you?" Harry asks, feeling guilty. Ron just rubs his shoulder. "Yeah, but that's alright." Harry's still shaking, he can't get it under control. "I think I'm gonna go get some tea, thanks for waking me," Harry says and stands, Ron stands with him and pulls him into a hug, Harry melts into it. "Course, mate. Try and get some sleep if you can alright?" Then they break apart.
“IwanttobeaherbologistprogessoratHogwarts,” Neville lets out in a rush, stunning them all a bit. “It suits you,” Luna states simply, the rest agreeing. “Maybe we’ll work together then, Nev,” Harry says with a smile. Neville, ever unsure of himself looks up from where he was staring at his hands and smiles. “Defense against the Dark Arts, Harry?” Luna asks in her dreamy, warm voice, Harry nods. “You’ll be the best Hogwarts has ever seen,” Neville says and knocks his knee against Harry’s own. “And you’ll give Professor Sprout a run for her money.” Ron chimes in, Neville positively beams.
He’d gotten Draco a new sketchbook, leather bound along with a few CD’s of Draco’s newly discovered favorite muggle band. Tonight though, it was a Saturday and it seemed everyone had plans except them, he’d have gone to see Teddy but Andromeda has taken him on a vacation for Christmas. The common room was blissfully empty tonight, Harry was snuggled into a comfy chair by the fire and reading until Draco came back. He’d said something about helping Luna with an assignment but he’d be by the common room later.
As it begins to get dark, and after the thestrals have eaten all their supply the boys start to walk back to the castle. And if their hands brush a few times, and Harry’s heartbeat picks up a little, no one needs to know that. “Think you could help me study for potions sometime next week?” Harry asks as they reach the hall that leads to their respective dorms. “Only if you help me with my defense essay,” Draco replies smoothly as they reach the portrait. When they enter the eighth year common room, they see a bit of a foreign sight. Pansy Parkinson sitting with Neville, not just sitting with him, laughing with him seeming to ignore the studying they had to do.
As their first term begins to wind to a close, Harry realizes he hasn’t given his presents to his friends he won’t see over the break yet. Course he’ll be seeing Ron and most likely Hermione. It’s a few days before they leave when he starts passing out presents. He’d gotten Luna a muggle mp3 player as shed liked his CD player so much, Neville a herbology book he’d noticed he rereads a million times from the library, Pansy a small jewelry box and they’d all appreciated them very much. The last gift, for Draco he’s held on to until today. They hadn’t hung out alone in quite a while and he wants to see his reaction.
It's sometime in March when Harry can't sleep, not that it's surprising, he hasn't ever truly slept well. The trauma of the war made it worse, elevated his nightmares so he'd wake up screaming. Tonight it was one of his reoccurring dreams, watching Sirius fall through the veil followed by Remus jumping in after him. All he could do was stand and watch, tears streaming down his face, and then the dream changed. He was back in the forbidden forest, the spot he had died but Voldemort was nowhere to be seen.
They take his, formerly Sirius’, motorcycle to a diner Draco absolutely adores. They get breakfast for dinner, french toast and coffee. They talk about everything and nothing the entire time, it’s the best date Harry has ever been on. They hold hands as they walk through the muggle streets, headed to a music shop. Harry buys Draco a few CD’s and they kiss in the back corner like teenagers.
Before he knows it, it’s been a year. Ron and Hermione had begun looking for an apartment for just the two of them, Luna and Ginny had as well. Pansy spent more time at her girlfriends, Jen, than she did at home, and Neville had met someone. Their name is Nia, Neville had carefully explained that they weren’t a girl or a boy they were non-binary. Neville was happy, Harry could tell and he was so incredibly proud of him for it, Neville had struggled so long and he deserved happiness.
A few months later, about a month before school starts and he’ll head back to Hogwarts, not as a student but as a professors assistant, someone comes barreling down the stairs. ”Harry! Harry!” The person yells and he recognizes it as Draco and meets him and the bottom of the stairs, Draco nearly falls and Harry catches him. “Slughorn wrote me back! He said he picked me to study under him!” Draco says, so excited he could burst and Harry embraces him. “I’m so proud of you! That’s so great, Draco!” Harry’s equally excited, for a few selfish reasons.
After he sits with Kreacher for a while, both of them drinking tea, he bids him goodnight and heads back to the common room. There's a blonde head of hair that he can see above the couch, Draco he thinks and smiles before sitting next to him. Draco sets his book face down on the coffee table when Harry sits, offering him half of his blanket. "Couldn't sleep?" Harry asks and Draco shakes his head. "Got tired of staring at my ceiling, you?" His friend asks and Harry sighs, his head thumping back onto the couch.
“Bloody hell,” comes from Neville. “I kicked arse!” Neville yells after that, the room going from tense to filled with laughter. Draco gets an O in potions to no one surprise, Luna an O in her magical creatures Newt, Hermione got an O in well, everything. Harry hasn’t opened his yet, he finds his hands shaking and Luna sits next to him. Harry hands it to her in a silent plea for her to open it for him and she does, hands it back with a smile. “Harry?” Draco asks softly from his seat across the room, Harry looks up and smiles. “I got an O.”
“Oh yes, you do know me so well Kreach.” The elf disappears for a moment before reappearing with two bags in his hand. “Now this one is beef and this one is apples, these are just from Kreacher, would you tell the thestrals that?” Harry smiles and takes the bags. “Of course, i’ll make sure to tell you how much they like them.” And with that Draco and Harry leave the kitchens.
As much as Harry had hated his easy recognizability, the expectations of the entire wizarding world on his shoulders, he found himself wanting to go back. Not because he wanted a war, merlin no, he never wanted a war. Harry wanted to go back for one reason, one simple reason. He knew who he was then. The chosen one, the boy who lived, the savior of the wizarding world. What was he now? A hero, they tell him. The next best Auror. Harry’s stomach feels sick at the thought of another fight. Being an Auror, well it meant he’d be fighting the rest of his life wouldn’t he? He’s been fighting for eighteen years, he doesn’t suppose he can do it any longer, he doesn’t want to.
“I used to come here back in sixth year,” Draco says suddenly, Harry hums and shoves a stray curl back behind his ear. “It’s quiet here, peaceful even,” Harry replies easily. “Are you heading to Hogsmeade this weekend?” The blonde boy asks, sounding a bit unsure of himself. “Nah, I was thinking of going to visit Teddy, my godson,” the gryffindor boy replies easily, Draco looks at him a bit confused. “He’s Remus’ son. Lives with his gramma Andromeda.” He hears Draco snort. “I know that you dolt, he’s my cousin. Jus didn’t realize you were his god father.”
At some point their conversation had turned to the future, something they’d never actually spoken of before. Ginny was going to be trying out for the Holyhead Harpies, she was after all the best chaser Hogwarts had seen in decades. Luna dreamed of being a magizoologist, Hermione a healer, Ron an auror, which left Neville and Harry, neither of which had shared yet.
Somehow, he’d actually managed to pull of an O on his Defense NEWT. Harry and his friends were sitting in the living room at Grimmauld place a week after school when the results came in. Somehow, Harry’s home became home to all eight of them, there was more than enough room. Ginny and Luna shared a room, Ron and Hermione shared a room and other than that everyone had their own. Kreacher had passed out the mail, Ron ripping into his immediately and the others following his lead.
As he enters the Great Hall, he spots a few now seventh years standing still as a statue next to each other. Harry walks next to them and lays his hand on the shoulder of one of them before standing to face them. “It is, so incredibly brave for you all to be here. I know it’s hard, just know you have someone in your corner, someone to talk to if you need it. Always,” Harry says, a bit unsure of what had possessed him to say this. He wasn’t well adjusted himself, his hands began to shake at the sight of the forest, Luna had held his hand to walk in with him and the sickness in his stomach toned down from her.
Harry basically runs to the back of the building before he apparates back to the house, Pansy following right behind him probably curious to see what happens. It’s a Saturday which generally means everyone’s home, Draco’s probably reading in the garden. Harry breaks out into a sprint to the garden, almost knocking Luna over and yelling a ‘sorry!’ behind him as he bursts out the back door. “Draco?” He yells a little bit before seeing him, he’s sitting on the swinging bench overlooking the lilies.
“We could’ve been doing that for two years,” Draco says when he stops laughing. “I’m so fuckin dumb,” Harry mumbles, leaning in for another kiss. He can’t help but smile into this one. Harry’s had their first date planned for years, he just never thought it’d actually happen.
“I think Teddy would like to meet you, Draco,” Harry says, unsure if he’s overstepping his bounds. “Someday, maybe I’ll go with you to see him. Still some things I need to make amends for.” He says quietly. Harry smiles gently and knocks their knees together. “I’ll take you, when you’re ready.” They don’t say anything else for a while, Draco pulls a book out of his bag and sketches.
After that day, apologies seem to be made all through their year. Draco apologizes profusely to Luna, and then Ginny. The rest of the eighth year Slytherins following his lead. The younger years are less forgiving, being less involved in the war. They’d all lost friends, siblings, parents, so many loved ones and they blamed the Slytherins, often targeting Draco. Once they realized Draco and Pansy were friends with Harry however, a lot of the hexes and dirty words thrown at them died down. Soon their friend group of the six of them, the trio, Ginny and Luna, and Neville expanded to eight, pulling in Draco and Pansy. It became a support group for them, a study group sometimes. They’d go to Hogsmeade together, study in the common room late at night.
names, I have no excuses. It was a terrible thing to do, I treated you horribly for so many years and I am so sorry.” He’s looking at his hands now. Hermione gets up and stands in front of him. Draco braces himself for a slap, instead a hand is extended to him. Unsure, but with a nudge from Harry he takes it and they shake hands. “Thank you, Draco. I do not excuse what you did, nor will I forget. But I accept and appreciate your apology. I would like to make amends with you.” Draco smiles gently as she takes her seat.
When he sits, his friends question him silently thankfully, just casting a few looks. Luna however smiles at him. “You’re very kind,” is all she says. “I learned it from you,” Harry responds and Luna smiles at him. Before he knows it the feast is over, and Mcgonagall is standing at the podium. “Students,” she begins. “I would like to first and foremost thank you for coming back. I know that it is incredibly difficult for so many of you to see this place, let alone return to it. Many of you have lost loved ones, I offer my condolences for this. To the students and teachers that fought last year, I would like to sincerely thank you, Hogwarts has been my home most of my life and thanks to the bravery and hearts of you, it stands to this day.” She clears her throat, Harry thinks she’s getting a bit choked up, he is himself.
Harry watches, his mind swirling with thoughts as it often does. He’s not old enough to raise a kid, he’s so grateful for Andromeda. But Andromeda, she’s old, one day her time will come. Harry thinks, if Teddy is still underage he’ll take him then. God, he loves that kid. He’s got all the life in him of his mother, all the love for sweets of his father. Kids sharp as a tack already, calls him ‘Unca Harry’ every time. Runs to him and when Harry lifts him, Teddys hair goes long, black and curly, just like Harry’s. One time, there were three lightening strikes on his forehead, just like Harry. He thinks of his life now, once school ends he thinks he’ll study under Slughorn. Slughorn who'd suggested offhandedly that one day, Harry should write a book. Not an autobiography, a text book, for defense against the dark arts. Harry thinks he’d like to do that very much.
Even though he’ll still live at Grimmauld with all of them, he’ll be able to see Draco daily still, and all he’s ever wanted was for Draco to be happy. Maybe he’s known it for a while, maybe it started that day when Florence had nudged him into Draco, maybe the night he’d almost kissed him and fallen asleep in the common room together instead, however long it’s been, it’s come to a point. As he’s smiling at Draco, looking at him tell their friends, excited and hopeful for his future, Harry realizes he’s falling in love with him.
“They’re incredibly kind animals. Luna and I go visit them from time to time, they like raw beef a lot.” Draco looks at him for a second before standing up, holding his hand out to Harry, who takes it and is pulled up. “Where in the hell do I get raw beef?” Harry chuckles at the question and picks up his bag. “The kitchens,” he starts to lead the way.
One of the seventh years, Theo, he distantly remembers his name, steps up a bit unsure, and then he’s hugging him. “Thank you for saving my mother,” he whispers and Harry’s heart breaks a little. “You all take care of yourselves alright? Friends are the way to live through this,” and with that he joins his own friends at the Gryffindor table. Professor, Headmistress he corrects himself, Mcgonagall meets his eyes as he takes his seat and smiles, he can’t help but smile back. The feast goes off with out a hitch, that is until there’s a commotion at the Slytherin table.
Suddenly a book is pushed into his lap, open to the page Draco was sketching on. It’s of a thestral where he was sat, from the side with the landscape of the lake behind him. “It’s amazing,” he whispers and Draco chuckles. They sit in silence for a while after that, it’s a Friday and their classes are all finished for the day, so they have nowhere to be. “You know, I can see the thestrals now,” Draco mentions offhandedly. Harry decides not to pity him, Draco wouldn’t like pity.
It isn’t until three day’s before term starts that Harry tells Ron and Hermione. “I’m going back to Hogwarts for an eighth year,” he states bluntly. Ron looks a bit surprised and Hermione looks incredibly satisfied with herself. “Thought the Aurors said you didn’t have to, mate,” Ron questions lightly and Harry runs a hand through his dark wavy hair. “I can’t be an Auror,” Harry let’s out, a bit too loud. “Oh thank Merlin!” They hear, following a crash in the kitchen and a few moments later Molly is pulling him out of his chair and hugging him. “I’d be so worried for you,” She whispers and Harry hugs back as tight as she is.
He’d won. Blimey, Harry had actually won a war. He’d died, not for long, and he won, they all won. It felt like he could breathe for the first time. All of his life itd been ‘Harry do this’ and ‘Harry be that’ and finally, he was free. Was he really though? Was he truly free? It didn’t feel like it. They’d won but they’d lost so much. Fred, Remus, Tonks, and hundreds of others just to win. Maybe he wasn’t the boy who lived after all. Maybe he was just the boy who lost. The boy who was lost.
The small one had taken quite a liking to Draco, walking between his legs and nearly knocking him over. Draco sits down to avoid falling and allows the baby to crawl into his lap and feeds him an apple. Harry sits next to him, Florence laying next to him, now nuzzling his thigh. Harry takes Draco's wrist gently and lays it on her nose. Draco smiles at her. “This is Florence,” Draco chuckles at that. “Luna named her I’m guessing?” Florence nips an apple from their bag. “Luna names all of them, I can only ever remember Florence though. Took me to the ministry that night, heh, nearly bit Dumbledore cause she wanted to take me back too.” Draco hums and pulls away from Florence gently.
The last day of testing is a week before school ends, a Friday and he ends his test at around 4 in the afternoon. His group of friends finished their tests before him and were sitting in the corridor outside of his potions classroom waiting for him. Luna was tucked into Ginny's side reading a book, upside down of course, Ginny lightly dozing with her head against the wall. Ron and Hermione sat facing each other with a card game spread out in front of them. Pansy and Neville sat on the far end of the group sharing earbuds and listening to Lunas mp3 player. Draco was the first to notice him, looking up from his sketch book and nudged Ginny. "Harry! You did it!" Ron cheers and Harry laughs. "We have a surprise for everyone," Luna says and Ginny smiles pulling the basket that sat next to her into her lap. They'd planned a picnic.
“Spending quality time with you alone in a chamber? I would love that.”
“Perhaps.” Harry looked relieved and glared around the common room.
And, yet, Draco had still been naïve enough to think that Potter would not be fucking shit up.
“Cissa and I have tea every three days. Last time I asked her what you were like as a child. She wasn't to show me a whole photobook next time we have tea.” Draco paled. He had not known that POtter and his mother had tea with each other, yet another weird thing to ignore. He swished his word and immediately a large stack of books fell into his hands, Harry winked and took them off him. It was unfair that he was only a cm shorter than the blonde, the whole growing thing had done a number on Draco’s hormones and he was not enjoying himself.
A few years ago, the mere sight of seeing Draco Malfoy would’ve sent Harry into a rage. But the two former enemies had come to a truce over a year ago now and had become some version of friends, even. They weren’t close mates by any means. But now when they ran into each other on the street or at the grocery store like today, they didn’t immediately want to spit venom at each other or throw hexes.
As his eyes continued to search Draco’s face, he found he couldn't take it any longer. Despite not wanting his first kiss with a man to be a drunken mistake. The need to kiss Draco was too overpowering. The need to find out what kissing a man would feel like. Would it be like kissing a girl, soft and wet? Or would it be rough and hard? He needed to know.
The couple continued to kiss heavily for a few moments longer before breaking apart. Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s, looking deeply into his eyes as he tried to catch his breath. Draco licked his lips, a small smile appearing there. Harry found himself returning the smile.
Harry pulled away slightly from his boyfriend in confusion. His brows were fused as he searched the other man’s face for an answer. “What the...?”
Harry sank deeper into his depression afterward.
Harry just shrugged and looked down at his feet. That was the problem. He didn’t know when he would be up for it again. A heated sense of self-hatred filled the pit of his stomach at the thought. He didn’t know what type of person he would wake up to being tomorrow or the day after. He could never predict his moods and he hated it.
Harry moaned at feeling the slick heat of Draco’s tongue and pressed their bodies further up against one another. His heart began to race as he felt Draco’s growing erection twitch against his own. It was taking everything in him, to not just take the blond right then and there, bedroom or no bedroom.
As much as he tried to fight it, the sadness came. Like it always did despite him taking his medication and everything else.
“Not really,” answered Hermione honestly. “Harry was my friend long before we found out he was bipolar. I wasn't just going to stop loving him because he had a mental condition now. Yes, it hasn’t always been easy putting up with his moods but he has always had them, already long before he was diagnosed.”
Harry found himself getting lost in the kiss. He loved feeling the rough brush of stubble rubbing against his own. The urgent wetness of Draco’s pointed tongue dancing around his. It had been so long since he’d kissed someone like this before. He couldn’t help but marvel at how wonderful it all felt.
"Yeah," replied Harry as he looked over his shoulder and met Draco's eye, smiling devilishly at him.  He was in a really good mood, he thought.
Harry had barely looked at the lunch menu as Draco waved for a waitress and ordered another dry cappuccino and the lunch special (which was half a Reuben sandwich and a cup of chowder soup). Harry, who didn’t care what he had, ordered the same and another coffee, this time a mocha. He knew he would probably regret the caffeine later when his manic episode kicked in but right now the coffee seemed like a good idea.
“I couldn’t,” said Harry flatly. He knew it sounded like a weak excuse and it was. But it was also the truth.
There was a cheesy love song blaring from the sound system. Harry didn’t pay much attention to it though as he began to make his way through the grocery store. He had a list of items he needed to purchase with him this time andplanned on being in and out. He just needed to get the essentials like bread and cheese. He’d run out of food a day ago. He was on a new cocktail of medication and it made him nauseous if he didn’t have them with food.
“Oh,” was all Hermione could muster up to say. She could tell that Harry was upset about it and didn’t want to push the situation any further. The brunette continued to stare at Harry for a moment longer, before taking a long sip of her tea, cradling the warm mug in her hands.
Harry didn’t respond to this. He knew that his friends worried about him. They were the only ones who knew about his condition. They’d been with him when the doctor had diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder.
“Yes, Harry. So fucking good.”
Draco sighed as he stretched out his back. He figured he wouldn’t be getting any more sleep that morning. He glanced over at Harry, who was propped up on his elbows, watching him with a smirk.
“Hello, Malfoy.”
“What for? So you can hold my fucking hand as I cry like a child!? I’m a bloody grown man! Mione!” Harry lashed out in annoyance at his friend.
“Okay,” mumbled Draco after a long pause. Despite the awkwardness and the weird withdrawnness of Harry, Draco did want to make this thing, whatever it was, last. He liked Potter. Like, liked-liked him. Like really fucking liked him. He’d always had a bit of a crush on Harry growing up. At the time of course he would’ve denied it, saying the only feelings he had for Potter were hatred and loathing. But now as a grown-ass man, Draco could see that he’d secretly liked Potter and had hidden it by mocking him, constantly. The blond had been happy to settle for Harry’s friendship, but when Harry had made his intentions known four days ago, that he too liked Draco and wanted to take him out on a date, he’d been over the moon.
“I thought for sure you would’ve left by now,” continued Ron, oblivious to Harry’s irritated look, as he opened his locker and began to pull out his shower kit.
He didn’t bother to look out the peephole as he unlatched the front door and swung it open.
“Of course.”
No, he would visit The Weasley Clan another day. This morning, he would just make the fluffy french toast and peaches himself. He had all the ingredients needed to do so, but peaches.
There was no point in living, he thought.
“What?” Ron mouthed back in the dark as he rubbed the side of his arm.
Draco gave Harry a pointed look before pressing a kiss to his forehead. He hated when Harry apologized like this. Draco had learned long ago not to blame Harry for his moods. He couldn’t help how his brain was wired, nor the chemistry of it. His mood swings were as natural to him as breathing.
The living room soon filled with the sounds of Big Band music as the image of a black and white movie played out on the screen. Harry couldn’t help but smile at himself as he leaned back into the couch cushions and watched as Rita Hayworth sang. Harry had always had a thing for old films, especially film-noir ones. There was just something about the simple, black and white images and dramatic score that soothed his soul. Gilda had always been a favourite of his too.
Harry enjoyed sex, but he didn’t necessarily crave it. When his sex drive was high though, usually when he was in a manic episode and wasn’t in a relationship and his hand wasn’t able to satisfy the need, he would go to a club for a pull. There were two muggle gay clubs he liked to frequent when the need struck.
Pain flashed through his temple, but he welcomed it. He needed to feel something. He only deserved to feel pain, he thought as he felt his heart begin to break.
Harry’s eyes widened in disbelief as he stepped off the last step and took in the atmosphere of the room.
Draco Malfoy materialized suddenly out of nowhere. Like Harry, he too had a shopping basket swinging from the crook of his arm. The blond had his back towards Harry as long fingers touched and picked up peaches before discarding them. It looked like Draco had the same craving as Harry to find the perfect, unbruised peach this morning.
Harry, for a moment, thought that Neville was calling him out on his hard-on. However, he quickly realized that Neville was asking if he wanted another butterbeer.
Right after the trials and funerals had come to an abrupt end a month or so after The Battle of Hogwarts.
Draco who looked slightly out of place just nodded his head, before turning on his heel and making his way through the crowded cafe, seeking out a table.
“Well, hello Potter.”
Harry hummed along to the song playing on the wireless as he uncorked a bottle of a full-body red wine. He’d no clue if the wine was any good or not. It had been gifted to him two Christmases ago by an old colleague at the ministry. It was from Italy though and looked expensive, and he simply assumed that meant it was a good wine. Harry wasn’t much of a drinker.
His self-consciousness soon melted away as Draco leaned his forehead against his and looked deeply into his eyes for a second before stealing a quick kiss. They stayed like this for a few songs, gently kissing while turning in circles.
“Yes, yes. Of course,” said Harry as he closed the door behind Draco as he stepped into the foyer and took in all of Grimmauld Place. It had long ago changed from that drab, dark place it had been during the war. One of the first things that Harry had done before moving into it permanently was hiring a team of decorators and contractors, both muggle and magic to redo the entire place top to bottom.
Harry opened his mouth to protest but quickly closed it as he felt Draco’s warm hands on his waist and his lean body pressed against his. He surrendered to Draco’s touch, wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck.
Pansy wasn’t the only one dancing with him. Harry noticed almost immediately the long blond hair that belonged to Luna and the dark skin that signified he was looking at Blaise.  A few other people were dancing around in their group, that Harry hadn’t met yet. But he didn’t pay much attention to the other patrons of the club. His eyes were focused solely on Draco as he danced as one to the music. He looked full of joy as he laughed and sang along to the song. His lean body was all loose limbs and carefree moves.
He held onto the wall as he slowly somehow made his way into the sitting room, where he knew Malfoy was waiting for him.
Harry was always the first one out of bed and cooing over Nova when she woke up in the middle of the night. He hated to hear her cry.
And that’s where Harry headed. He didn’t bother to put away the milk or eggs he’d just pulled out. The fluffy french toast with juicy perfect peaches on top was long forgotten as Harry sought shelter in his bed.
“I’m coming through,” announced Hermione a moment later.
They drank their tea in silence for a moment longer, before Hermione spoke once again.
“I’ve failed as a father.”
!” Draco closed his eyes and braced himself against the upholstered bed frame. His hands gripped onto the top of the frame as he pushed his ass out, relaxing his lower back as he did so.
Over the last few months, Harry had developed a crush on Malfoy. He’d always had a thing for blonds and it wasn’t until he’d gotten to know the softer side of Draco that Harry realized his feelings. Of course, their friendship hadn’t started off easy by any means. They had put each through a lot during their Hogwarts days. But Draco Malfoy was a changed man. He wasn’t the same snarky pompous ass he’d been at school.  And Harry was all for putting the past in the past.
Harry smirked at this; he didn’t need to be told twice. He pressed his mouth to Draco’s shoulder at the same time as he sank his aching cock deep within him.
“So, how have you been?” asked Malfoy, breaking the silence. There was a touch of concern and genuine interest in the blond’s grey eyes.
Fuck. Baby. That’s good.”
Harry nodded his head as he watched Draco leave the room, leaving him to his own miserable thoughts. He pushed his glasses off of his face and into his hair and buried his face in his hands. He curled himself into a ball and began to rock back and forth. This is what he’d feared would happen when he and Draco had first discussed bringing a child into this world together.
Dating was already hard as it was. Throw in some mental health issues and it made the whole thing almost impossible to do.
“You too,” muttered back Harry as he slipped the ticket into his wallet and slid it into the back of his jeans. He glanced down at the screen on his phone to see if Draco had answered his text. Only the image of his lock screen stared back at him. He put his phone away then and moved towards the bar. He figured he would get a drink first before he tracked down the birthday boy.
Was this what he thought it was? He had heard of speakeasies, but he didn’t know any were still in existence. He ran a hand carelessly through his hair, not giving a fuck if it made it look more wild than usual as he slowly descended the stairs.
Plus, Harry knew what he was feeling towards other boys was wrong. He’d always been told, well not told, Uncle Veron would more likely spit vulgar remarks about gay people and how unnatural and utterly disgusting it was for two people of the same sex to be together was. And, of course, those words had stuck with Harry. He cared very little what the Durselys thought of him. However, he did care about what the rest of the world did, both muggle and wizarding. Homophobia was everywhere he turned. For a boy who just cared to be normal for once hated himself even more for his feelings towards men. Harry didn't want to be gay.
later.
“Good,” replied Draco, the small smile once again returning to his face.
The two men held each other’s gaze for a second. Neither seemed to know who should make the first move.
He was on a cocktail of mood stabilizers and antidepressants that made him feel whole again. He was better, despite what everyone kept on saying about how he could relapse and how bipolar couldn’t ever be cured.
Their eyes locked as Draco then fully entered Harry. His long, graceful cock slid to the hilt. There was a little pain, but Harry quickly grew accustomed to Draco’s size. Their bodies moved slowly at first as they found a rhythm they both liked. Their eyes never left each other; they both wanted to see what the other one looked like during sex.
“Harry, are you alright?” asked a very concerned Hermione as she crouched down in front of Harry’s face in the flames.
There went another date vanishing away. Another possibility of love was gone.
Draco continued to suck Harry off until he couldn’t take it any longer. As good as it all felt, they both wanted more. Draco kissed his way up to Harry’s torso to his chest. His tongue flicked playfully at his nipples before sucking on each of them hard and filthy.
A silence then stretched on for a second or two as Luna continued to look at Harry with a goofy smile on her face. She looked at him like someone who looks at a kitten—something that is so utterly adorable it makes you want to cry.
Harry was halfway through his drink when Draco found him at the bar.
Draco smiled a small smile then. He brushed strands of hair out of his face with both hands before wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. He leaned his body into Harry’s and spoke into his ear, “Follow my lead.”
“It’s just something that reminded me of you,” Harry explained.
“He has good taste,” said Pansy as she made a move towards the bathroom door.
So on that first Friday of the school year, Seamus had broken open a bottle of Firewhiskey and, hence, the first party's start.
The birds were singing a joyful tune outside the bedroom window, calling Harry like a shimmer of hope out of his slumber.
Harry sucked Draco off for a while, savouring the taste of him, running his tongue along Draco’s hard smooth shaft and over his heavy, swollen balls. He was gorgeous, Harry thought. His entire pubic region was shaved smooth, and Harry loved the sensation of his delicate skin in his hands. He’d had numerous other lovers who’d shaved their lower regions. Harry had never really thought of shaving down there himself. He liked his pubes and shaving he knew was too much of an upkeep. But with Draco, it worked. It was so fucking smooth and soft, that Harry couldn’t get enough of it.
“Right this way, sir.”
Then it came crashing down on him. The party. Draco. The past week.
Harry listened as Draco called out a greeting of hello before there was a thudding noise, which he assumed was the dropping of grocery bags by the door.  He could hear Draco’s voice on the monitor speaking words of comfort to Nova before there was the rustling of blankets as Draco picked her up.
“Bugger off!” cried Draco, pretending to be annoyed with Harry, but he really wasn’t.
“No! I need to turn around. I want to see you,” said Draco rather quickly. He could feel his cheeks flush as he admitted his intentions. He knew he didn’t have anything to be embarrassed about. However, he wasn’t good at showing his feelings at times. Before Harry, he’d never craved being with one person for longer than a night. He had been more about casual hook-ups and silly little flings. But with Harry, since day one, everything had been different.
“Help me put it on?” Draco asked as he pulled back a second later.
“Fuck,” swore Harry as he pawed at his cock through the already damp cotton of his briefs, taking in the sight of Draco in a thong. He’d seen his boyfriend in a thong before. Draco preferred wearing them over traditional men’s briefs, especially when wearing tight trousers. However, the sight never lost its magic for Harry. It didn’t seem to matter how many times he caught a glance of Draco’s perfect small round ass swallowing the small string of fabric between its cheeks. It always sent a shiver of arousal through him. “You’re beautiful.”
They stayed like this for a moment, pressed up against each other, listening to the music playing from the Wireless before Draco broke the silence. As much as he wanted to stay in the moment and pretend for once that they were a normal couple. The little voice in the back of his head kept on nagging at him to ask. Draco pressed himself close to Harry for one last second, breathing everything in before taking a step away.
Guilt twisted in his stomach as he thought about how he’d let Draco down. He knew he should jump out of bed that instant, throw on the tux that Draco had bought him for the occasion, and Floo over to Pansy’s house, where the party was.
!” drawled Pansy as she came to stand beside Draco in the mirror. The petite brunette tucked her perfectly bobbed hair behind her ears and, like Draco, admired her reflection. “What are you doing hiding out in here? You’re missing your party.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and concentrated on his breathing like his therapist had taught him to do when he was feeling panicked. A minute passed before he pried open his eyes and pocketed his keys. He let out a deep breath, watching as it came out in a ring of steam in the cold winter air.  He reached up and pulled his black beanie further down over his ears before shoving his hands into the pockets of his coat and beginning the trek to the store.
“No. No, no worries,” spoke Malfoy with an understanding smile. There is a slight note of disappointment in his voice though. He’d been looking forward tonight just as much as Harry had. “The flu is a nasty bugger. Especially during the summer.”
After ending the short call with Hermione, Harry made his way back into the kitchen where he vanished all the rotting peaches and spoiled milk and eggs with a quick switch of his wand.  He craved to go back into bed, burying himself amongst the blankets and pillows. But he pushed through the craving. He had already wasted four days of the week. He didn’t want to waste any more time. Not that he had anywhere to be. He was ‘retired’ now. At 27, he fucking retired.
“So. Can’t I spoil you?” teased Harry with a cheeky grin.
They didn’t exchange a word as Draco took Harry by the hand and led him to the bedroom.
“I know.”
Their eyes bore into each other as their bodies slowly began to move as one on the dance floor. Their hips are gently bumping into one another every so often as they moved to the beat of the music.
“Hello, Harry,” Luna cried over the music.
Neither dared to speak a word as they entered the moonlit room. Both their eyes falling on the large white king-sized bed that took up most of the room. Harry was glad he had decided to put on fresh sheets earlier. He hadn’t been thinking about sex at the time, but he figured some part of his subconscious had. He never changed the sheets if he was being honest.
“I see.”
There was a brief moment of silence between the two men as Draco once again returned to his process of elimination on finding the perfect peach. Harry studied Draco for a second before turning his attention to the peaches as well.
“No. No. No. No, it’s not that!” said Harry in a rush, realization quickly dawning on him. “I don’t feel obligated.”
At some point, someone did the necessary cleaning and protection spells needed before engaging in anything further below the waist. Harry waited for the always awkward discussion on who would bottom and who would top. Harry didn’t have a preference. He liked both if he was honest. He liked these things to come naturally, so he always relied on his partners to make the first move on who would do what. Since Draco was already on top, it only seemed right that that was the way things would go.
Harry smiled brightly at her in return. He’d always enjoyed Luna’s company. “Hi, Luna.”
“I’m gay!” he spoke again, this time with more volume.
“I’m sorry!” Harry choked out.
At first, he had been diagnosed with PTSD and put on antidepressants right away. Those had helped for the first few months, but then suddenly it was like his body was rejecting them. He would go through mixed states where he was constantly anxious and agitated. Wired but tired, as his doctor had described it. And the cycle just kept on repeating. He would have a depressive episode that could last anywhere between two weeks to a few months, followed by having a sudden burst of energy and then followed by another depressive episode. It took about two full years, though, after that first dark episode before he was properly diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.
Draco raised a perfectly threaded eyebrow at hearing this. The blond shifted slightly in his seat as he lowered the mug to the table. He made a small gesture with his hand, signaling Harry to continue.
Harry chewed on his bottom lip as he continued to scan Draco’s face. He couldn't believe how close they were at the moment. This was the closest they had ever been before. This was also the longest they’d danced together too.
It was then that Harry decided to throw caution to the wind and kiss Malfoy. It was tender and lasted a little longer than their first.
He assumed at least ten minutes or so had passed before he felt the wards of the house shift, welcoming Draco home.
It was five days into the New Year before anyone was able to get through Harry’s wards. Hermione had been worried about Harry since she’d seen him last at The Burrow on boxing day. He’d been quiet and remote. She could tell he was on the brink of a low period. She’d seen him like this numerous times before. However, Harry had said he was fine and just tired. She knew she should’ve gone over the next day, but she’d been in the middle of something for work. And then, she and Ron had gone away with her parents on a ski trip in the alps. It wasn’t until they’d come back on New Year’s Day and she tried to Fire-Call Harry and was blocked that she knew something was wrong.
His boyfriend wasn’t controlling or anything like that. Harry knew that Draco liked him no matter what he wore at the end of the day, no matter how much the blond made a bit of a fuss sometimes about what Harry chose to wear. But tonight was about Draco. It was his birthday, and Harry wanted to make Draco proud.
Not another word was spoken as Harry pulled briefly out of Draco, and they rearranged themselves on the bed with Draco lying down on his back, his legs thrown over Harry’s shoulders as his boyfriend entered him once again.
“What about Pansy’s party?”
After the song transitioned into another one, the couple continued to stay pressed together until Pansy had- In Draco’s opinion, rudely- cut in. Draco wasn’t ready to return to his party and friends. He’d wanted to stay wrapped up in Harry’s arms for the rest of the night.
“You’re a fucking idiot, Harry. That’s why,” he thought bitterly to himself. “ARGH!” He cried out in frustration as a new set of tears stung his eyes. He pushed his glasses off of his face and into his hair before pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. He began to sob uncontrollably as he relieved one of the worst moments of his life, over and over again.
To Harry, it felt like ages before Draco was finally kneeling between Harry’s legs. The blond began to rub his cock around Harry’s ass, spreading his precum everywhere. Harry responded by pressing the heels of his feet firmly into the mattress and thrusting his hips upwards. He wanted to feel Draco’s cock stretching his ass.
“Well, Paul an idiot. And you're not Paul.”
Luna didn’t say a word as she rose to her feet and went to retrieve the glasses.
“I’ve been fine. You?”
There was no reply. An uneasiness then fell over Draco as he took a step further into the living room. He didn’t like how quiet it was in the house. It was too quiet, he thought.
Hermione couldn’t help but wrinkle her nose in disgust as the strong smell of dampness and unwashed flesh hit her. She brought the pale pink scarf that was woven around her neck up to her mouth and neck, covering it as she took a small step into the room.
“Mione?” whispered Harry as he cracked open an eye.
"What do you want?" asked Harry in a hoarse whisper. His heart was racing in anticipation of what Draco’s answer would be. He was willing to do anything the blond suggested. He was up for anything.
From afar, it might not look like much, but anyone close to them and paying any attention would know it wasn’t all that innocent.
“Yes, Mione, a fucking date!” Harry snapped. He ran his hands through his hair, pulling at the curls before dropping his hands to his sides. He looked down at his feet. He didn’t dare to look at Hermione. Harry hated how quickly he could lash out at someone with rage. He’d been going to anger management classes, but with his bipolar, it made his rage ten times harder to control at times. He wasn’t really angry with Hermione. His rage was more of the frustrating kind. He was frustrated with himself for not being able to have a proper fucking date.
He knew it was a rude question, but he was just generally curious. Harry wasn't the easiest person to deal with at times, especially when he was in one of his moods like he was today. He had only been dealing with Harry for a couple of months now but Hermione had been dealing with him for a lot longer.
“What?” asked Harry, self consciously.
He hated that his body and mind were betraying him at this exact moment when something good was about to happen for once to him. He fucking hated how the universe was once again spitting in his face.
Draco was going to take his chances and go collect some ingredients he desperately needed from the forest. technically, he was the only student with a pass to go there, but clearly that rule was bent by POtter.
Harry tiredly opened the Great Hall's doors, everyone now used to his underwear and pyjama prone clothing, so no one batted an eye at the purple boxers, at least he wore loose ones. If it had not been for the commotion a now rested Draco had made no one would have looked at HArry, everyone had figured out pretty early in the year the boy was not back for an education or on his own accord and therefore a blind eye could be turned to the saviour of the wizarding race.
He was tired of feeling like a broken person. He was tired of losing people. Draco had been one of the best things in his life in a long time and he’d gone and fucked it all up. Draco had been a major part of why his mood had been so good over the last couple of months. But now there was no Draco. He’d gone and left him.
Harry turned on the faucet of the dingy locker room sink and splashed water onto his face. He was hoping that the coolness of the water would somewhat help simmer him down. His heart was racing like a horse in his chest. There was a flutter in the pit of his stomach, his nerves on edge. As much as he was looking forward to spending the evening with Draco, he was also extremely anxious over the whole damn thing. Harry wasn’t exactly good at socializing and being in crowds.  He was great one-on-one with someone, but he tended to feel awkward like a fish out of water when it came to parties. It wasn’t his thing unless he was amongst friends and had a few drinks in him.
Harry’s eyes were wet, but he tried to blink back the tears. He didn’t want to break down in front of Draco like this. They were in a very public place. But it felt so good to be telling Draco all this. Finally saying it out loud felt like the elephant which had been sitting upon his chest for all these years had finally taken one of its feet off of him, allowing him to breathe.
His eyes grew dark as the sense of longing to join the blond grew stronger with each passing second as he continued to watch Draco. Harry wanted the man in every way possible. His cock twitched with interest as Draco shook that perfect tight little ass in his direction. Draining the remainder of his drink in one fluid motion, Harry ran his hands through his hair, welcoming the sensation of alcohol coursing through his bloodstream.
He then stole a glance at Harry.
“Really?” Harry lowered his drink and looked over at Malfoy in surprise.
It was then that Harry felt it.
Harry was quiet. He just stared at Luna in disbelief. He was used to her saying strange things. But this was on an entirely new level, even for her.
Just as Harry turned towards the fridge and began to pull out a carton of eggs and milk, the weather outside shifted and so did his mood. The sunny, blue skies that had once promised him the perfect day, was no longer as grey clouds rolled in and it began to rain. Now the weather didn’t always trigger Harry and his moods. He rather liked the rain, very much. But not today. His brain took it as a sign from the universe that he wasn’t allowed to be happy, that he would never get to have the happiness he saw his friends experiencing.
A sudden bubble of laughter erupted from him as relief ran through him. He felt like a weight had been lifted off of him, and for once, he could breathe. However, it didn’t last for long. Harry laughed until his stomach ached, and tears began to roll down his cheeks. It didn’t take long before his joyful laughter turned to body-shaking sobs as his brain betrayed him and reminded him that he should feel ashamed of himself.
“I’m gay,” he whispered into the stillness of the night. He held his breath for a second or two as if expecting a blow of some sort to happen. As if confessing he was gay, the world would blow up or something. However, Harry did no damage. The world remained the same.
It took Draco a few seconds of calling Harry’s name and batting his hand away from his cock before he got his attention.
Feeling Harry’s gaze on him, Draco opened his eyes and stared down at the other man currently down on his knees for him.  Draco’s grey eyes were dark and stormy with desire. He held Harry’s eye for a second before nodding his head in silent agreement. He wanted this as much as Harry did.
Harry brought a hand up to his lips and pressed his fingers to them as he marveled over what had just happened. He’d thought for sure that Draco would’ve turned him down just then.
Harry awoke slowly from his slumber, breathing in the soft powdering scent of lavender and baby shampoo. He turned his head to the side, his eyes falling on a small bundle beside him.
“You sound like Hermione and one of her mental health books. You both don't know what you're talking about. I know what I feel like. Not you. Or my doctor. I feel good. I feel really good. Like myself!” stated Harry. His green eyes bored into Draco’s. He was so fucking tired of everyone telling him what he should and shouldn’t be doing with his body. He knew he might seem manic at the moment. But he really wasn’t. He just felt better. He didn’t understand why Draco couldn’t see that.
The other man didn’t bother to argue or reply to this remark. Instead, he just nipped at the tender skin at the nape of Harry’s neck before continuing to press a trail of hot wet kisses along his collarbone and shoulder.
“Harry this isn't up for discussion. I'm going to call the doctor’s office right now and book you in for the next available appointment. You are not quitting therapy.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed at Hermione before abruptly looking away altogether. It physically hurt to hear Draco’s name come out of Hermione’s mouth. It wasn’t like he’d forgotten what had happened. But hearing his boyfriend’s name made it feel fresh again. Tears filled his eyes as the void in his heart began to throb once again.
Draco immediately leaned back into Harry for support as he sank into the waves of pleasure beginning to build within him. He was glad that Harry had enjoyed his present so much as he’d enjoyed wearing it. He’d never been one to wear something so private as a butt plug out in public like that for as long as he had. He’d been playing with it earlier in the day while getting ready for the evening and had just decided to leave it in. It had taken some adjustment. He wasn’t used to walking around and moving normally with an object inside him. However, the foreign feeling soon wore off and was replaced with arousal and excitement. Draco grew accustomed to the small thrill that shot through his body with any sudden movement he made. Wearing the butt plug had made dancing a whole new exciting challenge for him.
“What the fuck, Potter?” spat Draco, his grey eyes dark with irritation as he looked on at Harry.
Pansy snorted but didn’t say anything as she took the tube of lipgloss from Draco and applied it over her already red-stained lips.
He just lay there for what felt like hours in his good clothes of a black & white gingham shirt, black sport coat and fitted black trousers. He’d carefully selected the outfit earlier, taking the painful time to iron it all by hand. He had wanted to look perfect and pristine for Malfoy. Now all his hard work was wasted as it got crumpled as he continued to lay. His glasses were askew on his face as he pressed the side of his cheek into the hardwood floors of the room. He knew he should try to move, but he physically couldn’t. His body felt like it was being pressed down by a series of 10-pound weights. Every inch of him felt heavy. Every little bit of movement took all the energy out of him. Even breathing was proving to be difficult.
He ran a hand through his curls as he waved down the bartender with his other. He needed a drink.
They both stared at each other for a second. Neither wanted to part but knew they had to. Malfoy had dinner with Pansy to attend. Harry watched as Malfoy licked his lips and cleared his throat.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle to himself as he got dressed and caught his reflection in the full-length mirror on the back of the wardrobe door. Somehow by not paying attention to what he put on, he had subconsciously picked the brightest and loudest piece of clothing he owned. It was a rainbow tie-dyed shirt with a happy face on it. There was no better shirt to reflect his upbeat mood this morning than this one. He thought briefly of changing, thinking it was too loud, but quickly decided against it. He liked it.
It wasn’t until the song changed that Draco looked up and noticed Harry standing in the doorway, watching him.
“Forgot about what?”
Being with Harry was like eating peaches and cream and a little bit of acid all at once. You never knew what you would get from one mouthful to the other. One moment it was sweet creaminess and the next bitterness.
He took a sip from his drink and nervously fingered the curled ribbon on the small packet as he looked for his boyfriend.
As Donna Summer’s Bad Girl began to play, Harry excused himself from Luna and made his way off the dance floor towards the bar. He undid a button on his shirt as he pushed his way through the crowd. His shirt was now wrinkled and pressing uncomfortably to his sweaty torso. Who knew that dancing could be such a workout?
“I’m gay!” He repeated, the corners of his mouth twitching up into a grin.
Draco tore his eyes away from the grass and looked abruptly up at Hermione. Grey eyes bore into hazel ones. Draco raised an eyebrow before fusing them in a puzzled look. The statement was out of the blue and took him slightly off guard for a second.
Ron looked at Hermione then at Harry before nodding his head in understanding. He didn’t say a word as he reached out and squeezed Hermione’s hand before exiting the room.
A trip to the grocery store was needed.
“Yeah?”
It wasn’t until Draco made an impatient noise that Harry moved things further along. He pulled at the gauzy underwear, pushing it down Draco’s ass and thighs to his knees, before beginning to stroke the cock.
“Yes. It’s me.”
“Fuck! Harry, you're going to make me cum!” cried out Draco as Harry gave his balls a hard squeeze.
Alcohol coursed through Harry’s bloodstream, making him feel utterly relaxed and not having a care in the world. It seemed he only felt like this on Friday nights as he danced and laughed with his friends. He was not caring for once if he looked like an idiot. Somber Harry hated dancing. He never really knew how to move his body or what to do with his hands. But drunk Harry, that was a different story. He was a confident drunk and loved to feel the vibrations of the music take over him. He loved the feel of other’s bodies pressed up against his own, moving all as one like one giant being or something. He had been dancing in a circle of friends with Ron on one side of him and Hermione on the other. Neville was dancing beside Hermione’s other side. Next to Neville was Luna, then Seamus, then Ron. There was laughter and giggles as they all let loose and threw their hands up in the air.
“Really? What happened?” asked Draco with keen interest. He thought nothing could break up the golden trio. He cradled his teacup in his hands as he crossed his right leg over his left and looked eagerly at Hermione, waiting for her to continue.
“Well, I am. Sick.”
Harry hated how everyone couldn’t just let him be happy for once and truly enjoy this good thing he had going for himself for once in years. Telling Draco would just put a damper on everything. Harry didn’t want that. He didn’t want Draco to look at him with pity like he saw Hermione and Ron do sometimes when he found it hard to get out of bed. Or walking on eggshells around him when they thought he might lose it and go off on them. He didn’t want Draco to be like that around him. He only ever wanted Draco to look at him with those small soft smiles and bright grey eyes. He wanted nothing but those little adoring looks.
Harry hated these questions. He hated when Hermione went into her healer mood like this. She already knew he didn’t like talking about his feelings or being treated like one of her patients at Mungos. He’d rather she just treated him like her friend, just Harry.
"Yeah," whispered Harry as he stopped what he was doing and leaned into Draco's touch.
Harry let out a shuddering breath as he began to fight with himself. Anger and sadness twisted painfully in him. All thoughts of self-doubt begin to bloom like large hydrangeas in his mind. The hopeful, happy side of him that was only there moments ago fought and tried to push down all these negative feelings and thoughts suddenly threatening to consume him.  He shook his head rapidly from side to side, trying to erase all this sadness from him. “Please,” he begged with his reflection in the mirror. His eyes were wet with tears threatening to fall, but he quickly blinked them away.  He didn’t want to cry. He didn’t want to fall apart now.
Harry was trying to be more honest with himself and others about his diagnosis. His therapist thought it would do him some good if he opened up more to others about being bipolar. Opening up his support network further than just Hermione and Ron. So he didn’t spiral downwards as he’d done on New Year’s Day. Harry knew what she’d said was true. He didn’t want to get worse. But opening up and talking about what he was going through was always hard for him. He didn’t want to make people worry or treat him any differently. So they had come up with a list of five or six people that Harry trusted enough to tell his secret to. He had started by telling Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, followed by Luna, Ginny, and Neville.  Draco’s name was the last on that list.
“Hey, that’s mine!” cried out Harry in mock outrage, watching as Draco tipped the glass to his lips and finished it off.
“Do you want to get dinner?” asked Draco as he shrugged on his coat and wrapped a pale blue cashmere scarf twice around his neck. Even though it felt like they had just arrived at the cafe it was indeed hours later.
“Do you want to come in?” asked Harry with a smile towards Malfoy.
He rolled slowly onto his back and looked up at the ceiling, listening for a second or two. He felt groggy and out of sorts like he usually did when he woke up suddenly in the middle of the night from a deep sleep. He let out a wild sound of a yawn before stretching out his legs and getting out of bed.
He hadn’t thought about calling Draco. He’d instead had picked up the nearest object, which had been the mug he was going to put said tea in, and threw it against the wall in outrage. Then soon the heaviness of everything settled upon him like a blanket. His knees gave in, making him slump to the floor.
When they arrive, the thestrals are waiting for them. It pains him to see how many students are going up to them, curious, and petting them. He thinks thestrals know about the ones that can see him, they’d always been particularly sweet to him, especially the babies. They’d come and rest their heads on his lap, find him in the forest when he’d go and cry, they’d bring him small odd presents including flowers, scarves, bugs and one time Fangs collar. Now they would nuzzle the hands of students, seeming to understand the heartbreak they all felt.
Above the crowd, having had grown a few inches over the summer Harry spots Hagrid and breaks out into a smile. He wrestles his way through the crowd and makes his way to his friend, Hagrid wrapping him in a hug immediately. “Harry, my boy! I’ve missed you,” The half giant says when they break apart. “I’m so glad to see you, Hagrid.” The ride to the castle is with Hagrid, Neville and Harry himself, pulled by a thestral that had recognized Harry and nuzzled him as he slipped it a treat.
"Nightmares," is all he responds, Draco just nods. Draco doesn't pry, he never does, always lets Harry start talking about it if he wants, never pushes. "It was all of them tonight," Harry starts, he can feel Draco looking at him and stares at the ceiling. "They were all saying it was my fault, that it should've been me instead of them. That I should have surrendered earlier, that I could have saved them." Harry says and gulps air down, willing himself not to cry. A hand finds its way to his, intertwining their fingers. "You are," Draco says and Harry looks at him now. "You are so good, Harry," Draco tucks a stray curl behind Harry's ear with his free hand. "None of it was ever your fault," His hand lingers on Harry's face and for a moment he thinks he'll kiss him but then he's being pulled against Draco's chest.
Out of nowhere, it's NEWT season again and Harry studies until he passes out into his books. More often than not Draco finds him in the common room, dozing lightly into his work and chuckles fondly before managing to put him to bed. Harry spends hours studying with Slughorn, Hermione and Draco and somehow finishes all of his NEWTS.
Harry tells Draco he loves him for the first time on the thestrals grounds, with Florences head on his lap, hearing her soft snores. Draco decides they should share a room one day in the three broomsticks. Eventually everyone moves out of Grimmauld except for them. “We should move,” Harry says quietly over breakfast one day, seemingly thinking to himself. Draco looks up at him, curious. “This house is too big,” Harry starts to explain. “I don’t think we need all this space for the two of us till we start a family.” Draco gapes at him. “You want a family with me?” He asks quietly and Harry meets his eyes with a smile. “My love, I want everything with you.”
“I’d wanted to free him a million times truthfully, but” He cuts himself off and readjusts his bag on his shoulder. “Your father?” Harry asks, Draco just nods gently. He just hums in agreement. Before he knows it they’re at the thestrals grounds. A small one, couldn’t be more than a month old, walks up to them on shaky legs, Harry gives him a small cut of beef. His favorite one, though he’d never admit it, was actually the one that brought him to the castle all those years ago. Luna had named her Florence for some reason, Florence walks over to him now and nuzzles his hand as he pets her. “Hey sweet girl,” Harry whispers.
The students find out pretty soon after that, about a month into their relationship a fourth year sees them snogging in an otherwise deserted hallway, and runs off the tell the entire school. Surprisingly they don’t catch many homophobic insults thrown their way, they do however see a lot of the staff begrudgingly paying each other. A lot of them seemed to have bet against Mcgonagall and Hagrid, all lost of course.
Suddenly he was surrounded by people, people he came to recognize as Fred, then Nymphadora Tonks, then Lavender, Collin, Remus, Sirius, and Dobby. "Why did you let us die, Harry?" Comes from Fred, Harry can't respond. "Why didn't you go earlier, Harry?" Lavender yells. "Why didn't you save us?" Collin asks, tugging at his sleeve. "Why did we die instead of you?" Tonks asks from behind him, he shivers. "We had a child, Harry. He's an orphan now, thanks to you." Remus says and Harry falls to his knees. Dobby is in front of him now. "Dobby thought we were friends, Harry Potter." Harry shakes, distantly aware he's screaming 'no' over and over again. "It was all your fault, Harry." Sirius says tilting his head up to look at him, his eyes go black and Harry screams.
“I didn’t know you knew them,” Harry says and Sickawell smiles. “You remind me of them, Harry. In the best ways. Smart as Remus, I see. Hair like Sirius, maybe a bit wilder,” Harry chuckles. “And your father, you look so much like him, your mother too. You’ve got her eyes, though I’m sure you’ve heard that a million times,” Sickawell finishes and Harry feels warm, content that he’s like them. Sickawell stands and starts to walk Harry out. “They were good people, and I’ll be glad to hand my class to someone that would make them proud.” Harry shakes his hand. “Thank you, Professor.”
“You were awfully quiet in there,” Harry says on their walk to the forest. Draco inhales deep. “They knew Dobby. All of them.” The memory of holding Dobby as he died floods back and Harry sighs. “Dobby was a good friend,” Harry says, willing tears not to prick at his eyes. Draco huffs a small laugh. “Whenever I’d get into it with my dad he’d bring me a cupcake. Every time till you freed him, thankfully.” Draco smiles at him now and Harry just, takes in his beautiful Draco really is. How his soul is healing and becoming as beautiful as the outside, seeing how he’s a good person, how he’s changing.
A smile tugs at Draco's mouth, a small one, like he’s almost forgotten how to smile. “You aren’t either, are you?” Comes his response, Harry shakes his head. “None of us are. Perhaps the new Harry and Draco could make amends,” He says, once again without thinking. Draco looks a bit stunned. “You called me Draco.” Harry huffs a laugh. “I think, I think i’d like to be friends with you. Harry.” The blonde boy says and Harry smiles. “I’d like that,” with that he stands and returns to his seat.
Distantly Harry feels someone sit next to him and shakes him out of his thoughts. He’s sitting outside the Weasleys newly built borough, feeling a bit too empty and quiet without Fred. Soft damp grass is between his toes, under his bare feet and he sighs. Ginny knocks her elbow against his and he finally looks over at her. “Doin alright there?” Harry smiles gently at her. After they’d won, a few months ago now, Ginny had pulled him aside and explained that losing Fred made her see how short life is, and how she didn’t want to spend a second of it not loving Luna. Harry had hugged her then, and now she rests her head on his shoulder. “I don’t know to tell you the truth,” he says after a few beats pass. ”Tell me about it?” And it’s soft, gentle and not demanding, Harry feels safe and warm so he does. He explains how not having a prophecy to fulfill anymore feels odd, how he doesn’t know who he his, and how he doesn’t want to fight anymore.
Harry sighed as he looked at his reflection in the mirror. It wasn’t that he looked terrible. The actual physical features of his face weren’t the problem here. It was more of a struggle with the clothes he was attempting to carry off. Being a bit of a gym rat and personal trainer, Harry spent most of his time wearing athletic clothes. He was way more comfortable in t-shirts and trackies than anything that required pressing or had actual structure to it. Usually, Harry didn’t care what was on his body, but he knew it would matter to his fashion-forward boyfriend what he looked like tonight, so it was important to Harry too.
He was coming out of a low period. And today he’d woken up feeling like he could get out of bed.  If he’d been in a manic state, he would’ve loved to see the snow-covered streets of London. But not today.
As Burke’s soulful voice began to sing, Harry squeezed his eyes shut and wrapped his arms further around his boyfriend’s, his hands clinging to the material of his shirt. Harry had never heard the song before but that didn’t stop him from being moved by the man singing to his loved one. Harry wasn’t on to get emotional or too attached to a piece of music. However, he couldn’t help but become overwhelmed with sudden emotion as Burke asked his loved one not to give up on him. Tears pricked the back of Harry’s eyes as he continued to listen to the tearful singing. He couldn’t help but think about himself and Draco. He didn’t want Draco to give up on him either, he thought.
Hermione just rolled her eyes and shook her head at Draco’s eagerness to hear the story. She took a sip of her tea before beginning to explain.
Harry reached out with both of his hands and cupped the sides of Draco’s face. The couple looked at each other for a second longer before Harry pulled Draco’s mouth onto his in a passionate kiss.
Harry smirked into the nape of Draco’s neck at hearing this. He already sensed that he was driving the blond mad, but hearing this breathless confession made his heart sore. He loved hearing how the simple touch of his hand could make this beautiful specimen of a man squirm and lose control.
There were only two other younger classmates, two Hufflepuffs that Harry didn’t know.
Harry scratched at the stubble on his chin as he peered at Malfoy in puzzlement for a second. He didn’t recall telling the blond that, but he figured he must’ve at some point. There was a slight flush to Harry’s cheeks in embarrassment before he let out a nervous chuckle.
Harry’s heart was racing as he stared into Draco’s eyes for a second before gathering up all his Gryffindor bravery within him and kissing the other boy on the lips.
The rest of the night went by smoothly.
A small smile appeared across the blond’s face as he looked on at Harry. He was always looking at Harry like this whenever he came into a room and their eyes met. The blond was always generally happy to see Harry. This was something Harry was still getting used to. He couldn’t help but be reminded how Draco had once sneered at him anytime he entered a room in Hogwarts. It still amazed him how things had/could change.
He smiled at the beautiful drag queen dressed head to toe in sequins, looking like a Disco Queen herself, before ordering two fingers of bourbon. Harry usually only drank beer and g & ts. However, he craved something stronger tonight.
“Ron, why don’t you go downstairs and make Harry some food,” spoke Hermione as she turned to address her boyfriend. She knew that Harry was more likely to be willing to talk to her about Draco if Ron wasn’t present. It wasn’t that Ron wouldn’t understand. It was just that Harry seemed to come to Hermione more about his romantic relationships than Ron.
“Why did you come here, Draco?” asked Hermione. This wasn’t the first time that the blond had wanted to discuss Harry. But Draco never just popped over suddenly out of the blue like he had tonight. He was so formal with making arrangements. There was usually an owl sent with several times and dates to pick from.
Harry’s mouth went dry at the statement. He ran a hand through his curls as he looked from Draco’s face back down to his ass. He was unbelievably turned on at the thought of Draco wearing the plug, dancing and shaking his hips like he’d been all night at the club. “That’s bloody hot.”
“Do you want me to stay? Can I get you anything? Soup? Tea? Medicine?” Malfoy was nervous and rambling a little now. He was torn between staying and nursing Potter back to health, but another part of him was screaming at him to get the hell away.
“Fuck! More!
A feeling of warmth filled Harry’s stomach as he continued to watch, mesmerized.
“Yeah.”
Harry continued to sit on the floor, staring at the hole in his sock as Hermione fussed around in the kitchen. The heaviness in his bones had returned and he just wanted to go to bed, but just the mere thought of moving again and climbing up the two sets of stairs to his bedroom on the third level of the house overwhelmed him so much it nearly brought him to tears.
He giggled again before rising to his feet and leaning over the iron rail that ran along the terrace. “I’M GAY!” He shouted over the rooftops of the neighbouring houses.
Adoption, they’d been warned, was a lengthy process.
“Oh,” murmured Harry in reply.
The Floo went off a moment later. Of course, Malfoy would be fucking early.
He smiled to himself as he made his way up the stairs and entered Grimmauld Place.
The bedroom was dark as she pushed open the door.
“Go away!” called out Harry, not bothering to look up to see who it was. He hoped that his voice held enough edge in it to scare whoever it was away. A deadly silence followed, and for a split second, Harry thought he’d succeeded in making the person go away. However, he was wrong as he lifted his head from his knees a moment later and looked up to see Luna appearing down at him.
As Harry turned off the faucet and ran his wet hands through the unruly curls that sat atop his head, his best mate and work colleague, Ron, walked through the locker room door.
“Malfoy, fancy seeing you here!” spoke Harry warmly as he came up to stand beside Draco in front of the peaches. He grinned sheepishly at the blond, wagging his eyebrows playfully.
“To what?” asked Harry in confusion.
There was an awkward pause in conversation as Harry waited for the hostess to say something, but when she didn’t, he continued. “I’m looking for ‘The Funk Room’?” He held his breath, half expecting this tall posh woman to snort in his face. However, she didn’t.
“I feel good. I don't need therapy anymore.”
“It means I like girls and boys and everyone in between,” explained Luna in her signature dreamy way. A small smile appeared on her face as she added with little pride, “I like people.”
Harry let out a moan as a wave of pleasure surged through his body at feeling Draco’s touch on his scalp. His cock was rock hard and pushing painfully against the fabric of his briefs, but Harry ignored it. As painful as it was not to reach down between his thighs and pump himself as he continued to mouth at Draco’s. He didn’t. He waited.
“Harry, what have you done?” Snape looked pained, not even bothering to fake hatred, clearly regretting returning to teaching.
“You. Chose necromancy as a hobby, then decided it's a genius idea to raise a dead basilisk as what I presume is your first endeavour in your new hobby, have not had a wand since the battle of Hogwarts and have unthinkable amounts of power.” Draco had been yelling at him while moving closer. “I do not want to have to console my mother at the funeral of her new favourite person for whatever inexplicable reason because you do not value your life.” The last three words of his spiel were accompanied by cold hands shoving a hot, muscular chest three times, each on beat, ending up with Harry’s back against the door and Draco standing uncomfortably close. Fuck, Draco should not been turned on right now, and HArry did not make matters better.
“Harry as much as I adore this job, this place, I am getting old and I would very much like to retire one day, as would I like to trust the hands I give this classroom to.” Harry smiles at this. “Professor, may i ask, what did you do the two years before you could apply as a professor?” He inquires, setting his bag down on the floor next to him and sitting on the table. “I studied under my old professor actually. My, you’re very serious about this job aren’t you?” Sickawell sits across from him. “I am yes. Do you think, if it’s not too much trouble, you would consider letting me study under you?” The Professor seems to consider this for a moment. “Absolutely my boy. Who better to take my place than someone that actually knows how to fight these things we teach?” Harry chuckles lightly. “If you need any help studying for your NEWT, just let me know alright? After all, all those years ago I did tutor James into a passing grade miraculously.”
Just as Harry thinks Draco is done, Draco turns to Harry. “I know that we have made amends, but I have not apologized to you, Harry. I was cruel to you from the day I met you, trying to drag you into pureblood elitist bullshit. I- I hated being your rival, I really did. I am deeply sorry for everything I did to you, and I am so glad we’re friends now. I wish, I wish I had come to you when I needed help back then, I see now you could have and would have. I was just so scared for my family, for myself and thanks to you, all of you,” Draco looks at Ron, Hermione and Neville and then back at Harry.
They go to a little muggle shop next to Pansys tattoo parlor, she’d become a full time tattoo artist and she was bloody good at it. Once they’re seated Pansy stares him down with her infamous Parkinson glare. “Okay, what exactly did I do to deserve your wrath?” Harry asks over his cup and she furrows his brow. “You know exactly what you’re doing, Harry,” Pansy starts and Harry must look confused because she rolls her eyes. “You’ve been avoiding and ignoring Draco all week!” Shit. Shit shit shit. Harry really thought no one had noticed. “Want to offer a solid reason for your sudden acting like a prat?” Harry sighs and sets down his coffee. “Only if this conversation never leaves this building,” he says and Pansy scowls but nods.
Harry must’ve dozed because he wakes to someone removing his glasses. He mumbles something unintelligible and hears a familiar chuckle. “Just couldn’t stay up could ya, gramps?” Draco teases him and Harry yawns before faking a scowl. “Oh cmon, I’m only teasing,” Draco says with a laugh and gives him back his glasses. Harry wakes up a bit and smiles before digging in his bag. “Open it!” He says thrusting the package into Draco’s hands, Draco chuckles and unties the bow, letting the paper fall away. Harry sees his smile as he looks at the contents, and when he looks up at him. “This is so,” Draco sighs happily. “This is so thoughtful Harry, thank you.” Harry smiles at him and shrugs.
