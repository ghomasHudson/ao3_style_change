Harry’s head snapped up. “That’s what the fight was about. George was angry you stole an unfinished product, that you used it on us.”
Just when Harry thought Draco might be dropping off to sleep, his eyes opened. He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“Well,” Draco breathed, tugging at his collar before folding his hands back into his lap. “I had learned to be thankful by then. To want the second chance at life I had so unexpectedly been granted.”
“It’s not ridiculous,” Draco said. His fingers were worrying at the sides of the armchair, tracing the geometric pattern of the fabric.
Under Malfoy’s penetrating gaze, the statement felt more like a lie than it ever had before. Draco Malfoy saw far too much.
An echo of that fierceness crossed his face now as he stared down at Harry. A wind gusted through the trees behind them, tousling Draco’s blond tendrils.
“Fair enough,” Hermione said, biting her lip. Her skin was flushed and she appeared uncharacteristically frazzled. “I’ll keep looking into it. But in the meantime, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about. You can just carry on as you have been.”
Harry carefully sat down beside Draco, making no move to touch him. It was unlike Draco to spontaneously offer something of himself like this. Though he had confided in Harry before, he’d always been sort of backed into a corner, like he had to
Draco went on as if he hadn’t heard. “I know I only met her a little over a year ago, but sometimes it feels like she’s all I have. She’s been so good to me, and I – I –” He broke off, lost for words.
Smoothing a thumb over Draco’s cheek, Harry gazed earnestly up at Draco. “I meant it,” he said. “I wasn’t making fun of you.”
It was a cheap ploy. He hadn’t found out anything, not really. Certainly not enough to justify lying to Draco. Not that anything justified that. They were supposed to be partners, and Harry had shut him out.
“What do you think I should do?” Harry asked, more to break the silence than because he expected a real response.
“I’ve never understood – why do you think the flowers weren’t able to overcome the residue?” His fingers tightened around Harry’s. “They brought me back from the edge of death. They’ve been fighting all this time. Why haven’t they won?”
It had taken him some time to remember the charms and Transfiguration spells they had learned all those weeks ago, but after a bit of trial and error he’d gotten the hang of it again. It was a physical kind of magic, which Harry always excelled at, and the professor had allowed them to learn by doing, so he had retained quite a bit.
“Morning, Potter,” Draco finally mumbled, voice rueful. He was unsure how one went about apologizing to a distractingly fit former enemy for sleeping on their sofa after blundering about their house in the middle of the night while they cried upstairs. Pureblood etiquette had nothing to offer for a situation as convoluted as this.
Draco sat in stunned silence for a minute longer, before tightening his grip on the ice pack and escaping to the back room.
Still, it was nice to have a say in the matter. Thus far, all the candidates had been pleasant enough, but Draco liked one in particular. She had a breezy, distracted air, reminiscent of Luna Lovegood, and though she looked a little lost around the edges, her eyes had followed Draco’s every move, and she had been bold enough to try to piece together her own version of one of Draco’s teas.
Pansy huffed in displeasure. She continued to study Harry, conflict raging in her eyes. She seemed to be weighing her obvious distaste for Harry against the prospect of Draco’s happiness.
Ginny grinned wickedly, then winked when Harry huffed out a startled laugh. He shook his head helplessly, still laughing a bit as he remembered how Ginny used to pin him to the bed, inexhaustible even after the most intense Quidditch practices.
Draco didn’t suppose that mattered much. Potter had saved him, in the end, from fire and from Azkaban. That was more than Draco deserved. He certainly did not deserve to be saved from this moment of violence. And so, when his cheek exploded with pain, Draco had almost welcomed it.
Draco looked up and seemed startled by Harry’s stricken expression. He brushed the bread crumbs from his hands with a sigh. “Yes, well – I could not imagine anything worse at the time, but now I find the idea rather comforting.”
“Blaise will then proceed to ask me an absurd magical theory question that is just plausible enough to be intriguing. I will spend at least twenty minutes theorizing in response, during which he will genuinely listen, rather than nodding along with a glazed over expression, and that will be that. Apology accepted, friends once more.”
“But I wasted your whole day!” Harry protested, glancing ruefully at the scattering of stars he could see out the window.
Draco was never far from Harry’s mind these days, hadn’t been even before Hermione had turned Harry upside down.
Draco pulled the potion bottle out of his pocket then, and eyes fixed on Harry, he unstoppered it and poured the contents into the water.
Before Harry could fall too far into his reverie, Draco twisted in his arms and rubbed their noses together. It tickled, and Harry squirmed slightly, starting to laugh when Draco wouldn’t let him pull away.
Harry found himself standing beside Malfoy before he even realized he had moved away from the doors.
“Besides,” Malfoy continued, and Harry knew he was smirking without even having to turn around. “You were starting to look like a caged animal in here, Potter.”
He shoved his hands into Draco’s hair, tugged out the band that held it back, and let the delicious silky strands flow over his fingers. He latched onto Draco’s lips, biting and sucking, chasing Draco’s tongue with his own.
“Exactly,” Hermione said. “When you’re injured, you need help. Harry, you needed comfort after your nightmare. It was the first time Ginny wasn’t there to give it to you. And Draco, as silly as it sounds, you needed shampoo.”
Pointing at the arc of dark blue that cut through Harry’s throat, she addressed him directly. “This is the life-debt you owe to Draco.”
With a frustrated growl, Harry discarded the mug on a small table and banished the mess wandlessly. He took a measured breath and shifted on the sofa, moving close enough to Draco that he could take his hand.
He crossed the room and busied himself adding logs to the grate. After the flames caught, he turned to find Draco sipping from the sparkly blue mug Harry had set in front of him on the table.
“You sound like Blaise,” Draco said with a fond smile. He slid down the sofa a bit further so he could rest the back of his head against Harry’s chest. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, watching as his eyes grew distant.
It was a good dream for once. A beautiful one. Warm and colorful and sexy. Harry clung to it, even as his eyelids fluttered open. His hips bucked once, urgently, his throbbing cock fucking into the empty air.
Blaise draped himself regally across the purple sofa, one arm around Ginny as he laughed at her unnecessarily detailed account of how often Harry used to ramble on about Draco in bed.
As they walked along the lake, a tentacle emerged lazily from the water and swiped the stones off the top of the ice floes. Ron nattered on about the desserts he wanted his mum to bake over Christmas and matched his pace to Harry’s.
Harry reminded himself that Padma was stable and forced his mind back to the present. He shifted to face Malfoy.
“What business is it of yours?” Draco snarled viciously. Harry’s gentleness had sparked against his panic, igniting into anger. “Getting bored of civilian life already, Potter? Does the Savior need another hopeless cause to champion?”
“It doesn’t help us,” he said bitterly. “Only three recorded instances? Vastly different results? How do we translate that into a solution? The flowers haven’t accomplished anything on their own.”
Draco smiled in spite of himself. Maeve insisted on specific flavor pairings and never allowed her customers to choose their food freely. She claimed that tea was
They crashed back together then, sharing a groan at the feel of their bare chests meeting, the heated skin luxurious as velvet.
After a moment of hesitation, Harry decided to forgo the suit jacket. He hung it carefully in the wardrobe and rolled his shirt cuffs up casually. Draco continued to watch him, the raw want in his eyes clearly signaling approval.
“What?” Harry asked, pulse stuttering as he watched Malfoy shuck off his trousers. He was wearing snug black boxers underneath. It was nothing Harry hadn’t seen in the Quidditch lockers, but
Draco’s eyes grew distant, so Harry kept quiet as they finished the tea. Draco delicately stirred the sliced cherries into the metal container. Lifting the mixture to his face, he inhaled deeply before adding a tiny pinch of a spice Harry didn’t recognize. Apparently satisfied, Draco popped the container into a larger metal box that Harry assumed must somehow dry the tea.
There was a loud pop, and Hermione’s head appeared in the fireplace, her brown curls writhing wildly in the flames. Harry’s face twisted in frustration, gaze still fixed on Draco.
Without breaking eye contact, Harry lifted the blue mug and pressed it into Draco’s hands. “Where should we put it?” he asked.
“Is that all you got, Potter?” Lavender taunted, flinging a hex at Harry with each word. “Just defense? What, am too fast for you? Come on, attack me!”
Harry gripped on tightly, thankful for the anchor. “Hermione has been making little portable fires since our first year. She casts them without thinking half the time. But yesterday, it took her two tries and then the flames sputtered out after only a few minutes. She laughed it off, said she must be tired. But I don’t think that’s it.”
It was slow at first, as it so often was between them. They undressed each other reverently, fire-warmed skin revealed inch by inch. Harry was careful to only unbutton, not remove, Draco’s shirt, and Draco let out a shaky sob when he understood that Harry had remembered.
“We’re going to go one at a time,” Harry explained. “To practice steering your broom. You’ll start here –” he charmed the grass at their feet to create a bright blue line – “and end over there.” With a swish of Harry’s wand, another line appeared about ten feet away. “Understand?”
done something to be proud of. But from the soft crinkles around Harry’s eyes, Draco knew that Harry understood.
“Oh.” Draco blushed. He was flustered, thrown into the tangle of desire and confusion that worsened every time he was unexpectedly confronted with Harry. This was the first time Harry had ever commented on it though.
Draco had tried to say no, when Harry had knocked on the doorframe and asked him to lunch. He startled violently at Harry’s voice, then tried to hide it by crossly informing him that he was far too busy to go gallivanting off at this hour of the afternoon.
By unspoken agreement, they began to wander through the lush greenery. Harry let Draco take the lead, content to simply shadow Draco as he chased his whims. At first, Draco followed the spiraling pattern of the labyrinth stones, but he soon abandoned them, choosing instead to traipse across the uneven ground, flitting here and there randomly, pausing to admire whatever caught his attention.
“France.” Draco sighed lightly. “She did not care to live amongst the memories.” His hand waved vaguely in the air as he spoke, as if the memories were physical things that could be brushed away with a gesture.
Draco let out a tiny sob as he wiggled out of his pants, dropping them to the floor beside his jumper. Harry pulled off his shirt, but when he tried to stand to take off his boxers, Draco pushed him back down. All at once, Draco was desperately impatient, blood on fire as he reached into Harry’s boxers and pulled out his cock. Harry cried out, thrusting up into Draco’s fist. He was so thick, his flesh hot and slick with pre-come. Draco moaned and wanked him faster, reveling in the feeling of Harry heavy in his hand.
Tiny, intricate flower designs traced an erratic, spiraling pattern all along the wall they were following. Hardly noticeable, the flowers were somehow still as vibrant as the ones that had been in the courtyard last night. Harry drew closer and tentatively stroked a fingertip across a dazzlingly bright orange bud. For a moment, he could swear he felt the petals beneath his fingers, shockingly smooth and warm, and very much alive. But then the sensation faded, and Harry could feel nothing beneath his hand save the cool stone.
She gave him another solemn nod, her pale blue eyes widening. “Want to see?” she asked, pointing at the book.
Raising an eyebrow, Draco sat down at the table. Silently, and without breaking eye contact, he slid the plate across the table toward Potter.
Draco Malfoy. Blond hair falling into his eyes, a scowl of pain, and a rapidly reddening cloth wrapped around the fingers of one hand.
It had been an exhausting morning, but Harry worried Draco might still be too rattled to sleep. He pulled Draco into his chest, wrapped his arms around him, and began to soothingly rub his back. Shaking slightly, Draco tucked his head into Harry’s neck and clutched tightly to his t-shirt. Neither of them spoke, and eventually, Draco’s breathing grew soft and even.
Far too relieved to do anything but comply, Harry stood aside to let Draco into the cottage. Draco swept past him and went directly to the oven, mumbling to himself as he set the temperature and slid the pan inside. Then he straightened and wiped his palms on his trousers, looking anywhere but at Harry.
, Harry thought, suddenly frustrated. He might have let it go then, except Malfoy was still there, and he was still
exactly. He just needed a minute to gather his thoughts, and he really did want to know about Sprout.
Harry did not know what this was, but it was more than a bath. More than water, somehow. It felt thick and smooth, soothing as oil, as if every part of him was luxuriating in the pleasure of a massage. There was a spiraling sensation dancing just beneath his skin, a cleansing surge as every ache, every tiny pain, every fear or worry or sadness seemed to flow out of him, dispersing into insignificance in the water. Harry’s body felt heavy and grounded, but also spacious and airy. Free. He was sinking and floating all at once.
Harry had felt their magics touch before, had even felt Draco’s magic fill his body until he wasn’t certain where Draco ended and he began. But that was nothing compared to this.
“I started by researching life-debts,” she went on, wasting no time. “And I came across an old volume with some very interesting claims. The author argued that the way a life-debt functions is highly influenced by the circumstances under which it forms.”
“It’s such a pleasant surprise to see you,” Luna said, perching on the arm of the sofa. She seemed to have at least a dozen colorful scarves wrapped around her neck and shoulders. There was even a thin pink and green one tying back her long waves of blonde hair. Looking at the pale gold locks made Harry wistful. He suppressed a groan.
felt about him. How could you – how – do you have any idea –” Draco’s throat tightened further, but he forced out the rest of it. “What happens when this all goes wrong? You of all people know I don’t belong with Harry Potter. But you played with us, regardless. You played
“I fire-messaged Maeve earlier,” Harry said. “Your alarm went off and you barely even moved, so I thought you could use the sleep. She replied to say it’s no problem, and that you should take the whole day off if you need to.”
He shivered and gripped his left forearm, running a thumb over the Dark Mark. “About his snake. Poison dripping from its fangs, biting into me. Sometimes –” Draco swallowed hard – “sometimes it has my father’s eyes.” His expression clouded over with shame.
Her voice shook - "and the one time you came to me for help, I dismissed you without a second thought.”
The rest of the week passed quickly, now that Harry and Malfoy were speaking again. With Malfoy by his side, chattering enthusiastically to Neville about the effect of herb categorization on distilling efficiency, Harry didn’t even mind the discomforts of the stifling hot classroom.
“No, wait,” Harry interrupted. “Draco, don’t. Please. Just let me – I need to –” Harry made a lost, desperate sort of gesture. Hot chocolate sloshed over the edge of his mug, spilling onto his jumper.
All of this, combined with the relief of sharing the flower problem with McGonagall, had properly relaxed Harry for the first time in weeks – so much so that he had been able to spend a pleasant hour discussing Quidditch with Ron and Seamus. Blaise Zabini had even offered a few humorous remarks about the new season that were surprisingly insightful.
A delighted laugh bubbled out of Harry, taking him by surprise. “I don’t know if I do,” he said slowly. A giddy kind of lightness rushed through his veins, as if his blood had been replaced by champagne. “But I think I really really needed to hear you say that.”
“Do not try again,” Malfoy ordered. He had risen from the bench and was glaring at Harry. “You’ll only hurt yourself.” His voice caught, despite the imperious tone. Harry could tell he was still worried.
Finally, he emerged triumphant and returned to the sofa. Dropping down next to Draco, he handed him a piece of parchment with an unnecessary flourish.
“I should have taken you seriously, Mr. Potter. I will not make the same mistake again.” She stared him down until Harry finally nodded.
“That's right! And so was I,” Draco cried, eyes widening and mouth hanging open. He flushed and hurriedly closed his mouth. “Well – fish and chips, really,” he added after a pause, “but even so, that hardly seems coincidental.”
Draco opened his eyes and saw Harry’s stricken expression. He reached for him in concern, following Harry’s gaze to his own bare chest.
Draco pushed past. As Harry followed, he saw that his injured classmates were tossing and writhing on their beds, though their faces were eerily blank. Shocked, Harry gasped and skidded to a halt, looking frantically about the room. He had been here just yesterday, had visited on each of the four days Draco had spent brewing the cure, and every time, the patients had been calm and still.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hips. “I love you,” he told him, feeling his eyes grow wet with emotion. His fingers trailed over Draco’s belt. “Is this ok?” he asked again.
The bed creaked as Malfoy got up, looking down at his wrinkled clothes with an adorable little pout.
When Draco’s eyes flicked open, his irises glinted with a brazen daring that took Harry’s breath away. It was like staring into the past, but a warmer version of it, where Draco’s sharpness was used playfully, rather than to wound.
“I really must speak with that Headmistress of yours,” Maeve muttered to herself. “Imagine, Hogwarts graduates not knowing how to
The sense of loss was immediate, so deep and profound and painful that Harry shrank away from it, lest he be rubbed raw. The idea of not knowing Draco was unthinkable, and yet, if Draco had died that night, Harry never would have known how much he had lost.
Draco’s expression softened and he smiled soppily at Harry. But then he cocked his head, a mischievous glint taking over his eyes. Bracing a hand against the edge of the tub, he leaned back and plucked the smallest bottle from the group.
Harry stopped abruptly in front of his door and gripped the knob, before letting out a frustrated growl. He resumed pacing.
He slid closer and pressed himself fully against Draco’s back, one hand trailing teasingly along his hip bone. Draco’s breath stuttered, then quickly evened out. Harry mouthed at the side of Draco’s neck, leaving a path of wet, messy kisses as he worked his way up.
Color flared over Draco’s cheekbones again, but when Harry bent his neck to kiss him, he tasted that trademark Draco Malfoy smirk.
Swirling his tongue, Harry slid his mouth up Draco’s cock to lavish attention on his glans. He sucked and kissed and licked at the sensitive spot until Draco was a whimpering mess above him, practically sobbing into the arm that still covered his face.
He felt that telltale emptiness pulling at his chest, the ache creeping into his bones. He didn’t think he could blame it on the apparition thing this time though. Hermione gave him a pitying look, then got to her feet and peered out the window.
. He didn’t want it to bite into his magic and freeze his blood. This was supposed to be harmless. Nothing more than an intellectual curiosity. A chance to wrap himself in color and beauty and the light of Malfoy’s eyes.
He stretched his arms above his head, relishing the tiny pops of his spine, and mulled over what he might like to cook for breakfast.
No, Draco could not allow his heart to meander any further down this path that had no good end. He closed his eyes.
Draco turned his head, mouth searching for Harry’s, but Harry did not give in, moving to nip at the skin just above Draco’s collar.
Draco stiffened, crushing a bit of cake between his fingers. He rummaged around the mess of the counter for a cloth. “No.”
Harry tried to rewind his brain, desperate to snatch up any detail he could comment on, any question he could ask to divert Hermione’s attention from him, but it was no good. There’d be no going back now. He swallowed hard and fixed his gaze on the swaying tree branches framed by the cottage’s large windows.
Harry poured himself a glass of pumpkin juice and tucked in, content to simply listen as McGonagall and Draco chatted about the techniques Jaffey and Dahnroe had been using to study the residue on the grounds. Draco eventually admitted that he and Harry had briefly spied on the two Ministry employees, and then he looked on in astonishment as McGonagall chuckled.
Even worse, there appeared to be parameters to the situation that he did not understand. When he had left Potter’s bedroom earlier, he had gone straight to the front door. He had no inkling where in London he might be, and had not relished walking blindly through the rainy night, but with the alternative being lurking unwanted in Potter’s house, he hadn’t supposed he’d had much choice.
Expertly wielding a knife, Maeve sliced the dough into twelve identical scones, somehow managing to convey skepticism with nothing more than the movements of her gnarled hands.
The twilight air was a pleasant surprise – sharp and crisp, almost tart. His nerves over returning to Hogwarts today had left him buzzing with tightly controlled adrenaline, which had only worsened with the weight of the Harry-Potter-boy-hero persona he was forced to adopt in public. But suddenly, with just a few breaths, all his tension had whisked away into the night. He felt calm and clean and, and focused, in a way he had not been since the end of the war.
As he drifted to sleep again, Harry couldn’t help but feel that whatever darkness was at the center of those flowers, he and Draco, together, were equal to it.
Harry wanted to bury his head in his hands, but he settled for squeezing his eyes shut briefly. He took a deep breath and nodded.
Draco had not pushed the matter, not after Maeve neatly sidestepped his first few questions, but he got the impression that he wasn’t the first stray Maeve had taken on.
Ron’s mouth flattened as he gnawed on a cheek, uncharacteristically hesitant. His eyes darted to Hermione.
Heart fluttering erratically, Harry dashed down the stairs and through the kitchen to fling open the back door.
“No, that’s not –” Draco shook his head. He twisted a hand into his hair in frustration. “Potter, I know you are about as observant as a peppermint humbug, but
The fire was crackling away merrily, and by the time Draco pushed the (nearly empty) pie plate away, groaning that he could not possibly eat another bite, Harry was feeling warm and full and blissfully content. Draco’s limbs were draped across him, and they somehow seemed to be the only thing keeping Harry from floating entirely away.
“Are you busy?” Harry asked. “Hermione has some information for us. She’s going to call between meetings this afternoon.”
“Hey,” Harry protested, trying to scowl. His eyes were dancing though, and it rather spoiled the effect.
There was a thunderstruck silence. Potter’s eyes widened, as if he was just as shocked at the offer as Draco was.
right?” he asked, anger not quite masking the strain in his voice. He crossed his arms defensively. “If I’m acting a little strange, I think I’m allowed.”
“I went back to the courtyard last weekend, after –” Harry broke off, shame squirming awkwardly in his guts.
The same colors, the very same lights, that had plagued Harry and Draco in that nightmare house created by the Room of Requirement.
Nerves fraying more with every second, Harry rose from the sofa and threw open the windows. Draco closed his eyes and leaned back, inhaling deeply as the scents of cornflowers and sun-warmed apples spilled into the room. A faint smile crossed his face.
Maeve came over all smug at that, as the statement was dangerously close to what she’d been trying to get him to admit back in his workshop. Draco ignored her and grumpily transferred the shortbread and scones into the permanent preservation charms of their display case. He kept a piece of shortbread out for himself and took a huge bite. The hint of clove tempered the bright bursts of citrus, and Draco closed his eyes to savor it. The autumn shortbread never failed to make him feel as though he was sitting in front of a woodland fire, blissfully hot, even as a crisp wind rattled through the dying leaves.
“I made this for you,” Luna announced, wrapping it snugly around his throat. The yarn was smooth and slightly cool to the touch, and it smelled pleasantly of evergreen trees. “It wards off bad omens and it will attract Luminosities!”
Everyone startled violently, even Harry, who was usually very difficult to take off guard. Hermione actually stumbled backward, knocking into the arm of the sofa.
There was a long pause before Draco responded. When he spoke, the words shimmered with awe and love, despite the bitter undercurrent of anger. “Because the residue twists light into darkness, and Luna is the most purely good of any of us.”
to you. And when we came back this year, I didn’t want to say I was sorry, because words are empty. I wanted to
“Hmm?” Draco breathed, burrowing a little deeper into the cushions. Slowly, he blinked awake, only to find his face smooshed into an unfamiliarly plump sofa. At that, the gravelly voice that had just called his name finally penetrated, and Draco jolted upright.
“Fuck, no. Sorry. That’s not –” The words tumbled from Harry in a mortified rush. “I mean, it was – it was good. So good, Draco.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, even though he knew it did. Frustrated with himself, he scuffed his trainers against the floor and sighed again.
Harry fumbled his own cup and it smashed against the table, littering the tea things with tiny porcelain shards. “I didn’t know,” Harry said quietly, eyes fixed on the spreading tea stain as it soaked into the tablecloth. “I should have been here too.”
Draco had raided Harry’s pantry that morning, somehow cobbling together fruit parfaits and a deliciously fluffy quiche from various scraps and leftovers. Harry had never seen Draco so joyful, grinning wildly as he reveled in the spacious counters and used nearly every pan that Harry owned.
Harry gave him a little nod, smiling softly. And perhaps that was all he had wanted from Draco earlier. Trust. An admission in exchange for his own.
Harry’s brain ticked backward, spiraling through all the ways Draco had suffered and all the ways he could have died during the war. The fire, the battle, the Manor… facing Dumbledore on the tower… the bathroom where Harry had cut him open –
“It’s no problem,” Draco said, voice strained, yet kind. He smoothed his hands over his pajama bottoms. “Well, you have what you need, so I’ll just – I’ll just leave you to it.” He nodded awkwardly in Harry’s direction, and then he was gone, closing the bedroom door firmly behind him.
They both turned to look behind them, but the corridor road had entirely disappeared, replaced by the same unyielding blackness that had followed them since they entered the Room of Requirement, erasing everything more than a few paces behind them.
Ginny groaned, but it sounded more fond than exasperated. “He’s designing a magical scavenger hunt. Don’t ask,” she ordered, pointing a finger at Harry. “Not unless you want to hear a thirty minute monologue about the ‘shocking underground nepotism’ of wizarding antique shops.”
Draco squeezed Harry’s elbow. “It sounds like just what those kids need. They deserve to have fun, to bond with someone kind, someone who knows what loss feels like. Time enough for them to learn about the war later, in school.”
With that, Draco pressed a too brief, close-mouthed kiss against Harry’s lips and pulled away. “Leave the t-shirt on,” he commanded, staring down at Harry, “
Harry’s magic crackled through the room like lightning, swallowing Draco’s fizzles until it all flared up around them, burning as bright and beautiful as a sparkler against the night sky. Harry breathed it in, and the air tasted of flowers and starlight, of dueling and flying and arguing and brewing, of Harry and Draco, together.
“I fail to see how that is speaking of hobbies,” Draco countered, trying to ignore the heat coursing up his spine.
Outwardly at least, Draco appeared entirely unruffled. He was dressed smartly in fitted grey trousers and a deep blue dress shirt that made his eyes sparkle. (It had taken Harry all morning to convince him to forgo the tie.) No hint of a blush nor any sweat at his temples marred Draco’s cool composure. The side of his head was freshly shaved, but he hadn’t styled the longer half, and the fine blond strands tumbled around his face in a way Harry found softly beautiful. It lent Draco a warmth, an openness his younger self had lacked, and Harry could tell that Draco was anxious to make a good impression on Harry’s family – to let them in and show them kindness and learn to know them.
Malfoy shut the tap and wrapped his hand in a clean cloth before turning to face Harry. “That sounds – odd, coming from you,” he observed, wrinkling his nose slightly.
Harry grimaced. Pulling away from Draco, he rested his hands on his knees, worrying at a tear in the fabric of his jeans.
Draco was half in Harry’s lap when Harry pressed his mouth to Draco’s ear and whispered, “Will you stay the night?”
“How dare you?” Harry roared. “How dare you talk about opinions? As if yours have ever been anything but evil!”
, harder than he had been in a long time, cock throbbing and digging painfully into the seam of his trousers.
“No, that’s not what I –” Draco let out a small, frustrated growl. “No. No, I like it both ways. Harry, I’m ready. Harry,
It was not something it was possible to regret, and so Harry had pushed the momentary guilt aside and smiled reassuringly at McGonagall. And when Draco began his gleeful explanation of destroying the hooks, Harry had joined in eagerly.
“But you’d be surprised how much time there is for reading when your only friends are an eighty-four-year-old woman and a workaholic financial something or other. Consultant? Advisor? Lackey? I don’t know. Never mind.”
“Oh, darling,” Harry breathed, smoothing a few wisps of hair out of Draco’s eyes. “Of course I’ll teach you.”
Hermione gave a soft, thoughtful hum. “I believe there are many subjects I would enjoy discussing with you, Draco Malfoy. I do hope you won’t be a stranger.”
Weasley shook his head. “I think they do one every couple months, but this is the first time Harry’s fighting.”
“That’s true,” Hermione agreed. Her chin rested in her palm as she drummed the fingers of her other hand against the table.
Draco refrained from commenting on the irony of that. He did raise his eyebrows though, and they both chuckled.
“We’ll start small,” Draco said, straightening. He pointed his wand at the field and marked off a small square. “Target just this area, right in front of us, not the whole Pitch.”
He tried to make a game of it, matching each mug with one of his own teas, but with every one he named, his disquiet grew. Dangerous this, knitting himself so casually into the chaotic fabric of Potter’s life. Bad enough that he now knew where the man slept, had now glimpsed the flotsam and jetsam of his pastimes, had spent a night in the place he called home.
The way Harry saw it, his unlikely friendship with Malfoy had been sparked by the flowers, and had grown and blossomed under the stars. The Draco in Harry’s mind was always surrounded by the lushness of fluttering petals, his silver pale skin bathed in moonlight.
“No,” Harry said, suddenly troubled that he had never really thought of the animals while studying Potions at Hogwarts.
But that was a fleeting thought, easily disregarded, and when his wand had buzzed insistently that morning, the sun only a hint on the horizon, Harry had gotten up and dressed eagerly enough, before staggering off toward the castle.
On Tuesday afternoon, Harry had come across Sprout muttering to herself in a corner, peering crossly at her wand, but the professor had hurried away before Harry had the chance to reach out with Sentiomancy.
“No,” Maeve said cheerfully, eyes amused as she beamed up at him. She offered no further explanation.
Draco was just beginning to muse aloud about connecting the colors to various spells when he noticed that Harry had gone silent. They had finished eating, and Harry had been clearing the plates. He was leaning against the sink now, eyes seeming to look through Draco rather than at him. The overhead lights cast a warm glow on Harry’s face, emphasizing the tension there. The unease that had prickled at the back of Draco’s mind all through dinner reasserted itself.
“What if they say no?” Draco said, voice a tiny wail of despair. He pulled his hands into his lap, fingers clenched together tightly. “I don’t think I could come back from that. I – I think it might break me.”
Draco hummed thoughtfully, sinking down to sit on the low stone wall that lined the street. “Physical things come more naturally to you than magic does,” he explained. “It is easy to forget that, because your magic has so much power, but it’s still true.”
Harry moaned again, then shifted closer to the edge of the window-seat. He braced one foot against the floor and snapped his hips upward, thrusting deep into Draco. He licked Draco’s throat and brought a hand to Draco’s cock.
In the brief time it had taken to put on their nightclothes, Draco’s walls had gone up again, but Harry wasn’t going to wait for him to break this time. He shuffled closer and slipped a hand into Draco’s hair. Draco closed his eyes as Harry carefully undid his bun and combed his fingers lightly through the blond strands.
Harry understood that even now, those words cost Draco something. That even after today’s revelations, Draco was still fighting, constantly at war against those creeping tendrils of doubt and shame. And oh, how Harry’s heart ached for him.
Harry stepped out into the courtyard, but paused in the shadow of the castle doors. Malfoy had not seen him yet, and probably would not be able to see him, even if he suddenly looked up. There was still time to abandon this whim and escape back inside.
Harry smiled tentatively at Draco, the expression so uncertain, yet so sweet, that it bruised Draco’s heart. He thought of what Maeve had said earlier –
Harry nodded, even though Draco could not see him, and rubbed the back of his neck uneasily. “Malfoy, are you –”
“That’s not true,” he argued. He felt Draco’s eyes on him and his voice grew stronger. “Professor, it’s the most useful thing I’ve learned this year! It lets you gather information, and the more information you have, the better equipped you are to act.” Harry paused as he warmed to the idea, the possibilities beginning to take shape in his mind. “Imagine if we started practicing it in first year! What if we learned to sense different kinds of magic
Eyes sparkling, she stared at them expectantly, as if they should be able to divine her conclusions. Draco thumbed at his ring, mind whirring through the implications of this new idea.
Harry jumped as a crackling sensation coursed through him. He stared down at his hands in amazement as whorls of midnight blue ink seemed to pool under his skin. The color spread, and bright flashes of lightning sparked across Harry’s palms, as if a thunderstorm were raging beneath the surface. It didn’t hurt, but he could feel the buzz of the lightning and the rumbles of the thunder over his whole body.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry murmured, awed by the trust emanating from him as he leaned down to kiss Harry once more.
Weasley stared back at him implacably, but there was the slightest trace of amusement in his face. Draco was rapidly losing his nerve and was contemplating ending the call when Weasley nodded again.
look back, but then he wrapped his robes around himself like a shield and kept his eyes on the road.
“That’s mine,” Harry said roughly, joining Draco at the edge. “Nothing there at all, until I find the body.” He pointed at that writhing dark spot, impossible to guess how far away.
The cheery yellow walls settled Harry, calming his nerves as he made his way over to where Hermione was bustling around the stove making tea.
“I wanted to know what to do,” Harry admitted, now scissoring his fingers inside Draco. “I wanted it to be good for you.”
that Harry could not control the gibberish that spilled from his mouth. He whined and cursed and begged, whimpered Draco’s name again and again, slurred out promises and thank yous and words of love.
Draco followed him, licking at Harry’s shaft as he shuffled closer on his knees. Harry moaned desperately, one of his hands dropping to Draco’s shoulder. His hips bucked once, forcing his cock between Draco lips.
as he went. Before anyone had time to react, he snatched a vial from the box in Draco’s hand, squeezed a bead of his blood into the potion, and swallowed it in one gulp. He closed his eyes, letting his magic trail after the fizzling sensation that was overtaking his body. He felt like he was sinking into a warm bath, strolling through the sunlight, biting into treacle tart, flying amongst the stars, tasting Draco’s lips.
“You can stay the night,” Malfoy clarified, padding back over toward the bed and climbing in. “I know you don’t like to sleep alone.”
Harry’s heart began to pound, his breath coming more quickly. He hadn’t planned to talk about this, and he felt something like panic start to well up inside him. He closed his eyes for a moment, focusing on the feel of Draco’s fingers beneath his own. Tapping his thumb gently against Draco’s knuckles, Harry counted to ten, and when he opened his eyes, his breathing had slowed.
“Draco tells me you read mystery novels,” Blaise said. He had picked up a small porcelain bird and was peering at its painted feathers.
“Git,” Draco muttered, but he was smiling, and he turned his head to press a kiss into Harry’s smirk.
“It seemed like it had stopped,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “And – well, I may be avoiding her?”
But then the trees of the Forbidden Forest began to flash against the inside of his eyelids, refusing to retreat.
should have known. They’re supposed to be experts, the all-knowing Unspeakables, but they rush in here and fire off the first spells they can think of?” Draco was ripping up handfuls of grass as he spoke, the green shards scattering around him in emphatic punctuation. “They decide to mount a massive offensive without doing smaller tests? What the fuck did they
After a few minutes, when Harry’s skin was no longer damp, Draco wrestled off his own jumper and threw it at Harry. He quickly made sure his shirtsleeves were buttoned, then fetched the blanket he’d been using and wrapped it snugly around Harry’s legs.
“Will you go to the hospital wing?” Draco asked softly. “Make sure they’re still stable?” He ducked his head, eyes downcast and unsure.
He tugged on Draco’s hand until he looked up and met Harry’s gaze. For the first time, Draco’s eyes seemed dull. Washed out and lifeless, a pencil sketch grey of suppressed
“That wasn’t the plan,” Ginny said breezily. “He seemed like a good choice for a fling. Something exciting to play with between matches. You know how
“She won’t mind,” Harry said, resting a reassuring hand on Draco’s shoulder. “She’s mad for mysteries like this. She’ll have a hundred questions, and you’ll be better at answering them than me.”
They had taken the Tube to Harry’s cottage to pick up brooms (Draco was both relieved and unsurprised that Harry had more than one) and then, like the reckless Gryffindor he was, Harry had apparated them to a secluded field out in the country that he occasionally used for flying.
Without bothering to answer Draco, Harry strode across the room and threw open the door of the cupboard under the stairs. His hand tightened on the doorknob. The miniscule room was exactly as he remembered, right down to a spider scuttling across a discarded sock.
Ron looked over the board. Luna had left her pieces in an impossible position. Draco would be at an extreme disadvantage if they continued the game. Ron grinned, a tad maliciously, then gestured for Draco to sit.
“I want to try the kickboxing moves again,” Harry had said, without so much as a hello. “If that’s ok with you? Draco’s going to help with the magical theory.”
When they got into bed, Draco lay flat on his back, staring blankly up at the ceiling. Harry settled on his side. He braced his elbow against the mattress and propped his head in hand, gazing down at Draco.
Most nights, this did not bother Draco. Ignoring the view, he would bask in the twilight breeze and unleash the wanderings of his heart into books, the words twinkling before his eyes as brightly as the stars ever had. Most nights, he was content in his solitude, and the ugliness of the city streets did not faze him.
“I decided to consult her about the flowers.” He paused for a moment and his hand tightened on Harry’s shoulder. “Is that alright with you? I should have asked first,” he finished tentatively.
Malfoy looked over his shoulder at Harry, an odd expression on his face. “Right,” he said slowly. “Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater scum – an auror.”
Scooping up a towel from a nearby shelf, Harry moved closer and tried to wrap it around Draco. With a rather undignified noise, Draco shuffled out of his reach. He snatched the towel from Harry’s hands and draped it over himself.
He sounded so resigned, so worn out, that Harry couldn’t bear it for a moment longer. He raised his head and looked directly at Malfoy.
Rinsing himself off, Draco groped blindly for his bottle of shampoo, only to find it empty. With a growl of frustration, he threw it petulantly to the floor. Hearing it clatter across the tiles of the bathroom was not as satisfying as he had hoped, and he was now shivering violently in the frigid stream of water still pouring from the pipes.
Harry blanched. He let go of Malfoy’s hand and pulled his knees into his chest, resting his forehead against them. “What are we going to do?” he asked, voice muffled.
“Why all the stuff about potions?” Harry added when Draco didn’t answer. “Does cooking embarrass you or something?”
Draco Malfoy had always known he was beneath Harry Potter, though he’d never expected to experience it quite so literally.
Harry supposed they shouldn’t have been surprised. What they were attempting – well, it wasn’t how the Room normally worked. Served them right to get a weird, horror movie-esque experience in response. He huffed out a laugh at that, and Draco gave him a strange look.
“How about it, Malfoy?” Harry asked, voice only slightly strained. His fingers flicked open the button at Draco’s collar as he mouthed wet kisses along Draco’s waist. “Know what you’re going to study next term?”
Draco stretched against the sheets, distracting Harry momentarily with his straining calf muscles and the elegant arch of his spine, then clambered out of bed as well. Harry noted, a bit smugly, that Draco wasn’t entirely steady on his feet.
“Alright, but it’s somewhere to start, isn’t it? Aren’t there ways to clean up residual Dark Magic?”
“Draco, love, will you fetch me another container of your white citrus blend? I want to wrap up a sample for Mrs. Peakwright.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirked up. “You’re useless at research anyway, you insufferable man of action.”
Malfoy stepped closer to Harry, eyes narrowing as he scrutinized him for a moment. His expression softened.
He’d looked up, when Harry had walked across the grass to join him, meeting his eyes with a tentative nod. He didn’t speak though, and Harry decided not to push him. Instead, he sat with his back to the apple tree, not quite next to Draco, but close enough.
The couple started squabbling good-naturedly. Luna was still humming as she sorted through her many scarves.
she mouthed to herself before turning back to Draco. Her eyes narrowed, coolly considering, but the corners of her lips turned up with a hint of approval.
Ron shrugged. “I told him he was still a bit of a wanker, but since I’d gotten a few punches in over the years, I figured we were ok now.”
Draco nodded minutely toward the beams of light. “It’s about honesty, then. Things we’ve shared with each other.”
Harry’s eyes were still on Draco, his face falling into shadow. He knew what Draco was thinking, and it was clear he no longer knew how to reassure him.
Harry was panting, desperately returning Draco’s kisses, but when he felt those clever fingers reach into his pants and caress his cock, his head fell back against the wall. He let out a long moan and struggled to remain upright.
Suppressing a minute shudder, Draco folded his hands into his lap. “Yes. I had intended to walk home after – what happened, but there was some kind of barrier ward around the doors and windows that would not let me through.”
And maybe Harry should have given Draco more than two days before showing up unannounced at his job… but he couldn’t help it. He missed Draco. And Harry didn’t want Draco getting so tangled up in his thoughts that he somehow convinced himself to actively work against his own happiness. Harry Potter refused to be another thing Draco Malfoy tortured himself with, thank you very much. So here he was.
Harry silently vowed to be more careful. Draco had been nothing but encouraging when Harry asked to test his Sentiomancy on the potions. But this was the work of months for Draco – a portfolio painstakingly assembled, the first step toward being accepted into a Potions apprenticeship. It was an extraordinary sign of trust that he was allowing Harry free reign here – even if his shoulders hadn’t relaxed away from his ears since Harry had started.
Blushing furiously, Harry nibbled on a treacle tart and pretended to be absorbed in a conversation with Ron. Ron however, was too distracted by the bliss of the autumn shortbread to pay Harry much mind.
Draco let out a strangled sound and his hips bucked once before he managed to still himself. Harry moaned at the sensation of Draco’s prick forcing itself deeper, the thick firmness of it dragging against his tongue.
Maeve snorted, then gave him a fond smile as she ruffled his hair. “But the two of you are friends now?”
affect what the debt makes you do. Which is why it couldn’t have been our life-debts causing the apparition.”
“After the war, falling back into you was easy,” Ginny said. The corner of her mouth crooked up and she knocked a knee against Harry’s. “You were handsome and kind and – a little bit broken.”
“There’s something there,” he confirmed. “It’s inside the flowers, but also, sort of – spilling out? It’s concentrated at the center of the buds, but it’s also scattered. It flows down the vines and out into the air. I couldn’t really sense a pattern.”
Harry moved his hands back to Draco’s hips to steady him and nodded. “Whatever you need,” he reminded him softly.
“Draco,” Harry said. He ignored the stab of guilt and reclaimed Draco’s hand to tug him from the room. “I think this house is made up of all the places we ever needed someone. All the times we needed help and were all alone.”
“Luna’s not even an eighth year,” Harry said, the thought only now occurring to him. “Why is she with us? If she hadn’t been in our workshops, maybe –”
“As I said –” Draco popped the biscuits in the oven, snapping it closed a little harder than necessary – “that might not be it. We’re still researching.”
Time ceased to have meaning beneath Draco’s touch. Never more than a fingertip, never anywhere near his balls or his nipples, his arse or his cock. But still mind-numbing, still shiver-inducing, still
“The gardens at the Manor were so unlike this,” Draco marveled, staring out at the beauty around them. Everything about him seemed entirely at ease, but Harry could sense the hurt that skittered beneath Draco’s words. “It was all severe lines and meticulously manicured, everything in neat rows, like the flowers were afraid to deviate an inch from how they were laid out.” He shook his head, a slight touch of bitterness creeping into the lines of his face.
“From my favorite sandwich shop,” Harry said between bites. “It’s where I was going the first time the apparition happened, when I knocked you over in the street.”
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it. He shook his head slightly and blinked up at them uncertainly. Harry sidled closer and pressed a surreptitious hand into his lower back. It seemed to help Draco gather himself.
Draco clucked his tongue, already shaking his head. “But why now? Life-debts need to be invoked, and neither of us did so.”
Harry gasped and trembled, already far too close. Draco’s mouth was on his neck and Draco’s hands were bruising his hips and Draco’s cock slid against his oh so sweetly, and Harry was drowning in silver skin and moonbeam eyes.
The hurt must have shown on Harry’s face, because Malfoy gave him a soft look before throwing his hand to his head in a mock swoon. “Begone, devil! My wardrobe is too precious to risk on the likes of you.”
Harry let out a sound that was embarrassingly close to a whimper, feeling oddly bereft at the loss of physical contact. He leaned deliberately back on his hands, forcing himself not to move in toward Malfoy.
Throat dry, Harry swallowed uncomfortably. The need to help Malfoy was nearly overwhelming, but Malfoy looked uneasy, almost… frightened, and the last thing Harry wanted was to scare him away.
“No, it’s ok. I –” Harry shook his head incredulously. Relief danced in the tips of his fingers. “I’m just surprised. It seems a bit fast, but –” he trailed off.
Draco looked up then, resignation settling over him. He raised an eyebrow at Harry, almost a challenge.
“No,” she sighed. “Mr. Malfoy legally inherited the entire Malfoy estate the day after the Ministry acquitted him.”
Dressed now in boxers and a t-shirt, Draco shot a considering look at Harry before scooping Harry’s sweatpants off the floor. He pulled them on with an air of indifference, but blushed furiously at Harry’s wide grin.
Harry inhaled a shuddering breath and brought his mouth back to Draco’s, kissing him tenderly, each peck sweet and chaste. Draco closed his eyes and ran his hands along Harry’s spine in a languid caress.
Harry steeled himself and cautiously extended his magic into the delicate buds on the vine above his head. The icy shock bit into him, but he didn’t let it consume him this time. He took a steadying breath and waited for his body to adjust to the cold. Then he
“If you are amenable,” McGonagall continued, seeing that he had finally cottoned on, “I would like you to develop and eventually implement an Aperiomancy program at Hogwarts, which, incidentally, would also fulfill the requirements for the independent study portion of the Defense teaching fellowship I intend to offer you.”
Draco’s forehead was creased in concern, but he nodded, encouraging Harry to continue. Harry gave his hand a grateful squeeze.
“Empty,” Draco mused. He leaned back in his chair, unconsciously rubbing his fingertips across his sternum. “I couldn’t breathe. That’s emptiness as well, in a way.”
She touched his shoulder lightly and nodded, before making her way across the room to where Ron was playing chess with… Luna?
“Thank you,” he said, pressing a kiss to Harry’s nose. “That was delicious.” A kiss to his brow, and one to his temple. “You’re an incredible baker.” A kiss to his cheek. Draco smiled impishly and whispered in Harry’s ear, “Your pie is better than the sexy curse-breakers too.”
With a sigh, Draco shuffled off the window-seat, folding the blanket and tidying the pillows before heading to his bed. Before he could climb between the sheets though, there was an odd, swooping feeling in his chest and everything went dark and squished.
Harry felt a rush of tenderness toward him. It wasn’t as if they hadn’t lain beside each other before – they had, the first night Malfoy had followed Harry to the lake – but there had still always been something stiff and guarded about Malfoy.
Harry dithered in the space between Draco and McGonagall, struggling to resist his protective impulses. He was certain Draco would not thank him for calling the Headmistress’ attention to his plight.
Madam Pomfrey was monitoring them with diagnostic spells while Tahlyn worked to stabilize their cores.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.” McGonagall touched him lightly on the arm. “And you, Mr. Potter,” she added.
But still, maybe Harry shouldn’t have spoken about it so lightly. If George succeeded tomorrow... well, it would be a big change, and Draco wasn’t great with that. Harry inwardly cursed himself, not sure what he could say that would help.
Harry grunted, rubbing his head where he’d knocked it against a rock. “No, I hadn’t –” He scrambled to his knees in sudden realization. “But now –” he started excitedly.
When they reached the archway leading up to Maeve’s flat, she shoved Draco in front of her, shooing him up the narrow flight of stairs. Draco’s complaints slowed as he clutched the smooth wood of the banister and tried not to trip.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he choked out. “The stuff in the flowers, it must have gotten to the spells on the brooms, I should have known – Potter – I’m s-sorry – I can’t – I – all my fault –”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, a puzzled crease between his brows. “She’s hiding something. Why would she be hiding something?”
Harry snagged a jug of pumpkin juice from the fridge and followed, pausing to choose two mugs from the shelf. He had set the mugs on the coffee table and poured the drinks before he realized that Draco was still standing. A steaming plate in each hand, he hovered uncertainly by the sofa, frowning into the distance.
As he approached the eighth year table, Harry caught sight of Pansy Parkinson sitting alone at one end, reading. He hesitated for only a moment before walking over and plopping down across from her.
“Of course, Harry,” she replied. She pushed Ron gently toward the door, then sat down beside Harry on the sofa.
“Where did you come from, anyway?” he asked quickly, hoping to stave off any further concern from Potter.
Draco nodded at him in silent thanks, then continued. “It was last summer. I had fallen into the habit of taking long walks, just thinking things through, trying to focus on anything but my upcoming trial, and I stumbled across Novelle’s one day. I hadn’t planned on stopping anywhere, especially not at a wizarding business, but the turquoise walls were so ridiculous –” caught up in the story, Draco let a small laugh escape – “and the flowers in the teapots were so beautiful – I couldn’t stop myself. I went in and ordered a cup of tea.”
Harry followed suit, cutting himself a large bite and groaning as the tang of raspberry hit his tongue. The tartness complemented the custardy sweetness perfectly, and aside from babbling a few compliments at Draco, Harry found himself entirely unable to focus on conversation until he had polished off his first piece.
Harry turned to Draco, expecting to see him glowing with relief and pride, but Draco was frowning off into the distance. His left shirt cuff was undone and he was worrying his thumb along his inner wrist. When he caught Harry looking, he jumped slightly and hurriedly re-fastened the button.
“I must say, I am surprised to find you looking into bonding charms though.” Blaise paused thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t have expected you to jump head first into ancient pure-blood traditions the moment you fell in love, but if that’s what you want, well –” he placed a hand over his heart and winked at Draco – “I fully support you.”
He’d had to work twice as hard after that, constantly recalculating his aim, shifting his stance, self-correcting – and all the while, Malfoy danced effortlessly around him, the embodiment of grace.
Because Harry had seen that look on Malfoy before. And just like that, Harry was snatched up by the past, held captive once again in the halls of Malfoy Manor. Broken and bloody, Harry had known he was minutes away from being handed to Voldemort.
Harry grinned and shot off a truly nasty Blood Boiling Hex that Malfoy neatly dodged. He used his momentum to swing himself around to Harry’s other side and hit him squarely with a clever unbalancing spell that Harry couldn’t quite shake for the rest of the duel.
For one despairing moment, all Draco could feel was hate. Hate for his father and for Voldemort, hate for the past and hate for the war. More than anything though, Draco hated himself. He hated himself for being so desperate to move on, to be forgiven, yet lacking the courage to even try.
Harry wrenched back into himself just in time to hear Tahlyn’s strained voice ring out across the room.
Harry flinched, and his eyes darted to Dumbledore’s portrait. When he found the frame empty, he was both disappointed and relieved. He managed to refocus on McGonagall.
“I know,” Ron interrupted gruffly. “But I’m under strict orders not to let you freeze to death. You can thank Hermione.” He kicked Harry’s shins lightly. “Now come on, I’ll make you a cup of tea at Hagrid’s. Might as well make some use of the place while he’s off reforming the Giants or whatever.”
Harry laughed nervously. “It’s just – does Blaise have a problem with me? I mean, obviously we weren’t friends at school, but I always thought that was just about me and you –”
“Fancy a break?” Harry attempted. Malfoy shifted in his chair and scowled at him, but Harry soldiered ahead anyway. Fighting against blushing, Harry looked away from Malfoy and addressed his question to the floor. “Thought I’d take a walk, if you – er, maybe wanted to come?”
“That we’re bonded because of our past?” Draco said mildly. “That we have to move on from the past for the bond to be broken?” He shook his head. “Fuck if I know.”
Harry dug his fingers into the rocky soil in an attempt to ground himself. An explosion of temper would not help Draco.
Draco and Harry exchanged a look. It wasn’t that the suggestion was unreasonable, exactly, but Hermione’s words fell from her mouth in a jumbled tangle, almost like she was
They were quiet for a time, just as they had been at the lake, all those nights when they were still getting used to liking each other.
By the time they started actually performing spells, Harry was cobbling together the most bizarre answers possible, trying to trick the professor into admitting Harry was incorrect.
Draco’s chest loosened with the apology, and he drew in a full breath for the first time since Harry had revealed the Ministry letter. Even so, he did not yet look up at Harry. Instead, Draco kept his gaze steady on Ariana’s name.
“I remember,” Draco said. He glanced sideways at Harry before quickly looking away. “You invited me to come with you.”
Draco wanted to kiss him. Surely losing him at some vague future moment could not hurt nearly as much as this constant longing? This was like a thousand tiny losses every time they parted. A new wound every time Draco had to walk away.
She almost slid down the stairs she was laughing so hard. “Scared, Potter?” she tossed out between peals of laughter, a passable imitation of Malfoy’s posh tones.
Harry lifted his head. “Yeah? Tell me.” Despite everything, he smiled at the taste of one of Draco’s phrases in his mouth.
Blaise winced and rubbed at his temple. “I haven’t actually been here before. I didn’t know–” Seemingly lost for words, Blaise glanced around at the other customers, all laughing and merry, simply raising their voices to be heard above the din.
Finally, Harry simply mirrored the action that had granted him admittance to this elusive place almost a year ago, running his fingers along the plants as if he were walking idly by. Immediately, a tubular lime-green flower unfurled from the densest patch of ivy, looking disturbingly like a tongue. Draco squeaked in surprise, dodging away from the odd appendage, while Harry calmly fed it a handful of sickles.
Harry shrugged and joined him, crossing his legs and glumly resting his chin against his palm. Draco threw a few pebbles out into the void, but they just fell soundlessly out of sight. He sighed, and Harry shuffled closer, until his knee was resting against Draco’s thigh. The corner of Draco’s mouth quirked up and he let his hand settle on Harry’s knee, tracing idle patterns with his index finger. It was a light touch, barely there, but Harry felt it down to his bones.
“I didn’t know you were so confident in your bedroom skills, Draco,” Blaise said, mouth a lascivious slant.
Draco shouted, cock leaking profusely as Harry continued to rub his prostate. Nearly delirious with want, needing to taste him, Harry shuffled down the bed and swept his tongue over the head of Draco’s cock.
Harry felt a twinge of guilt, but he dreaded even touching those letters, and so he did what Draco said. Bypassing the stairs, he went into the downstairs bathroom and stuck his head under the tap. His teeth were chattering by the time he finally shucked off his sweaty t-shirt and pulled on an old hoodie that had been hanging from a hook on the back of the bathroom door. Without bothering to dry his hair or remove his dirty shorts and trainers, he had dragged himself to the living room and collapsed on the sofa.
“Yes, ma’am,” Draco grumbled, but the both of them were smiling, and by the time Maeve had her hands over his, expertly demonstrating the best way to hold the spatula and just the right amount of pressure to use on the dough, Draco was too absorbed to even pretend to be cross. To be receptacle to Maeve’s eight decades of knowledge was a beautiful and wonderous thing.
Malfoy circled Harry, slowing just enough to waggle his eyebrows before dropping below him and zooming away.
After a few more minutes of cleaning and tidying, Maeve tossed her washrag back into its sudsy bucket with a wet slop and lugged it behind the counter. She and Draco looked at each other for a moment, and then Draco reached out to straighten one tea cup that wasn’t perfectly aligned with the others. Maeve chuckled and squeezed his shoulder before making her way over to Harry.
“Put the suit on, Potter. We –” he trailed a hand across Harry’s hip and palmed his erection teasingly – “are going out.”
– and Harry felt a deep welling of shame. He shouldn’t have needed to hear these stories from his friends to know who Draco Malfoy really was.
The duel had raged on for the better part of an hour as they scarpered around the darkening grounds. The spells flying between them grew increasingly inventive, both competing to take advantage of their surroundings. Harry was particularly impressed when Malfoy had charmed leaves to divebomb themselves into Harry’s t-shirt, creating a distracting itchiness that persisted long after he had banished the offending foliage.
, and indeed, in the year Draco had worked for her, not one person had ever complained. Maeve always knew best, and Draco found that to be surprisingly comforting.
Draco fidgeted with his ring as one of the club’s employees addressed the crowd, explaining that the final match of the day would highlight one of their adult students. He went on to speak about their adult program, and how one-on-one work with a trainer could challenge and support adult beginners.
Harry could tell that Draco was nervous, so he had launched into the story himself. As he spoke, McGonagall’s normally stern expression had grown positively stony, and Harry had faltered in the telling when he realized that he had never seen her mouth in such a thin line.
There was laughter and sounds of agreement from the others, as well as some coughing and muttering from Ron.
Draco’s fingers stuttered where they had been tugging at the buttons of his shirtsleeves. Then he shook his head slightly and took Harry’s hand. “Do you still feel that way?”
“Oh alright,” Ron muttered. “‘Course she told me, you wanker!” He smacked Harry on the shoulder. “But I would’ve liked to hear it from you!”
Malfoy looked up and frowned in confusion, but then he seemed to understand what Harry was offering. His face softened.
But Harry did not know how to say the things he meant, so he just bumped his socked foot against Draco’s.
Absurdly relieved, Harry began to explain. “I’ve been practicing with my magic, using not-Aperiomancy –”
Draco fiddled with his cuffs and nodded, looking suddenly uncertain. He hurriedly fetched the box from the table by Luna’s bed and held a vial out to McGonagall. “It creates a bond – to the protective essence of the flowers.”
“It’s not stupid.” Draco tugged on Harry’s sleeve. “It’s perfect,” he said earnestly, as soon as Harry’s eyes met his.
“No, I know,” Draco said, feeling his cheeks heat. “That’s not what I – I mean, well, it’s just that – I like cooking.” He squared his shoulders and added, “Your mother must be quite knowledgeable.”
Draco kissed back hungrily and hooked his legs around Harry’s thighs. Harry rutted against him in an erratic rhythm – once, twice, three times, and then Draco began to tremble. He arched his back and cried out.
Harry shuddered as his hair, still wet from his post-run shower, dripped down the back of his t-shirt. Abandoning the books, he padded into the kitchen, the cool tiles a shock against his bare feet. When he threw open the curtains to let in the afternoon sun, the rays caught his new (mostly empty) spice rack, making the polished wood gleam. Harry had built it himself, carefully weaving spells into basic Muggle carpentry. He’d had to read two books to figure out the best way to do it, and the research had keep his mind off Malfoy for close to three hours.
Harry chuckled as he rolled his shoulders, working out a few kinks. He reclined on the bed in satisfaction, realizing that the ache felt surprisingly good. Apparently, sparring with Malfoy had been an excellent idea.
Perched above them, Luna continued to narrate the game, but Harry lost the thread of her story. He didn’t know much about chess (seven years of games with Ron notwithstanding), but he knew enough about Draco Malfoy to see that this wasn’t going to be the easy win that Ron expected.
Draco’s eyes cleared and he let his arms drop away from his chest. He shifted slightly closer to Harry. “I hated the flowers at first,” he admitted. “It felt so unfair, that they couldn’t just let me – die. I cried and ripped them off me. I – I tried again, but I couldn’t reopen the wounds.” Draco looked down at his hands helplessly.
Skin feeling hot and far too tight, Harry absently ran his hands up and down his thighs and ignored his yearning heart.
Draco had done his best to meet Harry’s gaze without fear, his own feeble reassurance for his brash and beautiful Gryffindor, for he knew that Harry deserved far better than to be constantly at war against Draco’s many doubts.
“Look, mate, we don’t have to talk about it,” Ron said. He knocked his shoulder against Harry’s. “I’m just here to keep you company.”
“I know,” Draco said. “But I might be able to make larger batches this way. Produce tea in greater quantities.”
“Come on, Potter,” Draco said, smirking at Harry’s dizzy expression. He reached out and threaded his fingers through Harry’s. “Take me to lunch.”
The cottage, a single wildflower decorating the table, a radiant purple that smelled like hope. Mugs in the sink and a pitcher of lemonade. A mess of trainers by the door, a jumper thrown carelessly on top. A burnished kettle. A tin of Draco’s favorite tea waiting by the stove.
Maeve snorted in disbelief, but then her expression grew grim. Without looking at Draco, she tipped the dough onto the floured cutting board and began shaping it into a tidy ball. “You shouldn’t go back to someone who hits you, Draco,” she said softly.
Inhaling deeply, Draco let the comforting scent of his spices and tea leaves loosen his tense muscles. By the time the chimes of the door signaled Mrs. Peakwright’s departure, he had calmed enough to sit down at his desk and plan his afternoon. But just as he began reviewing the week’s receipts, gauging which blends he’d need to replenish, Maeve’s voice shattered his hard-won focus.
Draco looked more flustered than Harry had ever seen him, but he swallowed hard and said hoarsely, “My hair, huh?”
“I tried, but he won’t talk about it, Professor,” Harry said, tone despairing. He looked down at his hands as he continued. “I didn’t want to force him, so I didn’t tell him I saw the letter. I’ve asked a few times if he’s thought about appealing to the Ministry and he just – shuts down. He says he deserves the punishment.”
When McGonagall did not immediately object, hope spilled from Harry’s heart, warming his chest and dancing its way into his fingertips. “And maybe you can suggest some students I can ask?” he added. “I want to collect enough testimonials for the application.”
Less plausible, but still preferable to any alternatives, was the possibility that Draco was at fault. That he was so tired he hallucinated the barriers, or that he was so worried about Potter he refused to leave, or… or that some small part of him wanted so badly to stay here that the magic at the core of him, desperate and unused, threw up a shield to prevent his departure.
“Uhhhh –” Draco had finally dropped the book. His eyes were closed and he was tossing his head from side to side.
Draco started to fiddle with the knit blanket folded over the back of the sofa, braiding its fringe with restless fingers.
“No,” Malfoy said vehemently, sitting up and finally meeting Harry’s eyes. “It’s more than that. It’s – I don’t know, never mind.”
Draco sucked in a startled breath and accidentally knocked his stack of papers to the floor. Bemoaning the miserable luck he seemed permanently cursed with today, he dropped to his knees and muttered crossly to himself as he gathered the receipts into a pile. Re-sorting them all would add at least an hour to his work.
“It’s not fair, Professor,” Harry argued, defensive despite McGonagall having given no indication that she approved of the Ministry’s actions. “He was a
Satisfied that she had gotten the final word, Maeve poured a mug of their signature black tea, plated a crispy cheddar scone, and plonked both on the counter in front of Blaise. She was well used to him dropping in whenever a client left him feeling particularly harassed.
Draco had been doing this a lot lately, when it came to Harry Potter – plunging heedlessly into seas he did not know how to cross. The shimmering water was a lure he could not resist, even knowing he would not allow himself to reach the beauty of the far shores.
Harry attempted a laugh, but it seemed to die on his tongue. His eyes darted to Ron and then away again. “What about you?” he asked softly.
Without being asked, Harry grabbed a towel and spray bottle from the sink and cleaned the cherry juice from the counter. It would have been quicker with magic, but Draco had not used magic at any point while making the tea (not to mention his odd avoidance of healing spells) and Harry did not want to disrespect his process.
“It seems the price of your company is far too high, Potter. My shirt is ruined! Begone from my sight! I may never recover.”
Draco’s hand flew up to cover his eye. He bit back a yelp of pain and blushed, embarrassed by the involuntary reaction. In a belated attempt to mask the motion, he brushed back his hair. “He did not
He had to admit that there were some advantages to the privacy – it was certainly easier to have a leisurely wank in the morning (while carefully not thinking about messy blond buns or intelligent grey eyes) – but Harry missed the comforting presence of other people.
Harry had clearly unsettled her. She’d probably thought he was hungover, feeling the effects of a late night out with friends. She’d probably expected him to wave her off or make a joke before dragging her into the gym.
Draco let his hand fall back to his lap, feeling a pang of loss as he studied the crisscrossed beams of light.  The orange was everywhere, and Draco could not help but worry over it.
“Harry,” Draco said. “Harry, I – I –” He shook his head, unable to find the words. Because the tangled orange knots were not nearly as tangled as they had first appeared.
For a minute, they just looked at each other silently. Harry eyed Ginny’s freckles, the tanned skin of her forearms, and remembered pressing kisses there on lazy mornings in bed. He wasn’t sure what he expected to feel, exactly. Maybe a pang of nostalgia, something vaguely bittersweet. But there was nothing like that. Just the familiar warmth of being reunited with a friend. Harry exhaled in a rush of relief.
Arching his back, Harry stretched his arms toward the treetops, then shook out his legs before dropping into a crouch. He began to smoothly move through kicks, dodges, and punches. Draco waited, watching as Harry added on a new move each time he repeated the cycle. Finally, after completing the expanding sequence four times, Harry’s expression cleared, his body taking on that charged balance Draco remembered from the exhibition match, where his limbs were a natural extension of his will.
Draco took a deep breath, and forced himself to look at Weasley. “I never should have said those things. It was cruel, and I regret it. I do not expect your forgiveness, but I feel it should be said. I truly am sorry.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco muttered under his breath. He threw a clean pair of boxers at Harry and climbed back into bed.
But under Draco’s contemplative gaze, surrounded by flowers and cauldrons and a dozen other visible markers of Malfoy’s interest in life, the lies Harry told himself finally crumbled. He didn’t want to be an auror, hadn’t wanted it for months, if not longer. He’d been walking toward that future like a man to the gallows, simply because it was expected of him.
“I just wanted you to give yourself a chance – and I thought, if you could see that there are people on your side –” Harry’s hands twitched like he wanted to reach out to Draco, but he just tightened his fingers on the testimonials. “I thought it might help. But it’s your choice what to do with this,” he said, setting the sheaf of parchment down next to Draco. “I promise I’ll respect whatever you decide.”
They hadn’t talked about it, not really, and agreeing to a game of chess with Ron wasn’t agreeing to be Ron’s friend. It certainly wasn’t agreeing to announce himself and Harry as a couple.
“The reading I did on the Room of Requirement suggests that its magic can supersede other magical processes, even complex ones. It may have taken over the life-debt bond in some way, and activated in your moment of greatest need.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and dug in his heels as Harry tried to drag him toward the gate. “What is this place?”
“Brilliant,” Blaise mumbled, eyes dancing with reflected firelight. “Thanks.” His gaze went distant as he dug a small notebook out of his back pocket.
Blaise was telling the truth. Of course it had not been like that. Draco knew that as surely as he knew his own name. But
Draco drifted closer, reaching out to finger the shelf’s decorative molding, where Harry had carved a delicate pattern of leaves. “I suppose it is rather nice,” he finally conceded.
He sighed and looked up, finally meeting Harry’s eyes. “I went out to the woods, and I picked a spot where I could see the sky through the branches, and I just – let it all go. It didn’t even hurt.” Draco choked out a miserable little laugh. “I was so broken already.”
“The orphanage you visited today?” Draco took a deep breath and squeezed his eyes shut. “I funded it.”
“I am happy,” Harry whispered, clenching a fist to his chest and squeezing his eyes shut. The worry was back, like a persistent dog biting at his ankles.
“It’s true.” Draco lay down in the grass and folded his hands neatly atop his stomach. “In a way, this apparition problem is the most exciting thing that has happened to me in a long time,” he said softly. “It reminds me my magic is still there, waiting.”
When they reached the entrance to the common room, Draco tugged Harry closer to him and rested his head against Harry’s shoulder. Harry pulled him into a crushing hug.
Pansy’s eyes narrowed, heavy eyeliner sharpening the glints of gold in her brown irises. She looked armed, almost dangerous, and it taunted Harry, made him want to draw his wand and fight. But that was an old reflex, one he no longer had patience for, and the urge stuttered out like a spark that refuses to catch.
Draco turned to face Harry fully, eyes alight. But then their knees knocked together, and Draco startled, as if just realizing how close they were sitting. He scooted back a bit, no longer touching Harry.
But Harry was too flustered to be bothered with even normal pleasantries today. He probably should have avoided the wizarding area altogether (he probably should at least have showered), but his feet had automatically steered him in the direction of his favorite sandwich shop as soon as Ron and Hermione had left the cottage.
Harry shucked it off obediently, then settled beside Draco on the thick ivory and gold rug. He stretched his hands toward the flames and groaned, only now realizing how numb they had been. He sighed gratefully as the warmth seeped into him and the ache started to retreat from his bones.
The memories shimmered in the air around their table, siphoning away a bit more of Draco’s sadness with each passing breath, until his eyes were a mirror of Harry’s, full of love and wonder and simple gratitude.
Draco threw up his hands. “I have theories, Potter! I can’t help it if your cock clears my mind better than the sexy curse-breakers!”
“I added some honey and cinnamon to the butter before making the toast. I thought you could use the sugar.”
and he had to bite back a startled exclamation. Suddenly uncomfortable, he looked away from Draco. The air seemed to buzz as Draco hesitated, but then he stood and slowly approached the shelf.
“Good.” Maeve released Harry’s arms and patted him on the cheek. “I’ll see you in February. Come hungry, and make sure Draco brings me all the new teas. Not just one or two, mind you. I want ALL of them.”
Warm brown eyes appeared above him, crinkled in amusement. William Vazquez swept a hand through his sweaty black locks and grinned down at Harry.
The words seemed to bounce off Harry’s mind, refusing to penetrate. “Hmm?” he breathed, more concerned with Draco’s incredible hands than with whatever he was trying to say.
He glanced around the room at the worn books and fiery colored throw rug by the sofa. Maybe it was time to start looking again, even if the cheaply furnished sitting room of a former enemy was an odd place to start.
The rest of the meeting passed slowly, and Harry couldn’t help fidgeting in his chair. Malfoy’s presence was like a phantom itch, and not being able to scratch at it was driving Harry mad. The answers to all his questions were right there, just three rows behind him, tangled up in Malfoy’s head. Harry had half a mind to get up and drag Malfoy forcibly from the room.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, dropping his legs to the floor and turning so he no longer faced Harry. He plucked a stray thread from his trousers and coiled it around his finger.
“No, Malfoy, it’s ok,” Harry reassured him. “It was bad, but it’s over really quick. As soon as I pull my magic back into myself, I can’t feel the residue anymore. I’ve gotten a lot better at it.”
Harry huffed out a breath that was almost a laugh. “I’m not sure that’s actually an insult, Malfoy.”
Finally, they reached the common room, but Harry did not slow his pace. He led Draco straight past their bedroom door and into a different room, just down the hall.
“This is incredible,” Harry moaned, basking in the aroma of the best tea he’d ever had. It was an oddly bright green color, but it tasted strong and rich, with just the right amount of syrupy sweetness. He took another large swallow, sighing happily as the flavor burst across his tongue. “What’s it called?”
Somehow still beaming, Harry shoved Weasley companionably and said, “I’m starving. Can we get lunch?”
He gasped and bolted upright. There was only one person he could think of who would knock instead of coming through the Floo.
“Why is it a surprise?” he asked, affecting a lightness he did not feel. “I do live here, you know.”
Harry suddenly gasped and choked a bit on his food. “That –” he coughed roughly and paused for a sip of water – “that happened to me the first time – er, sort of. I got dizzy and it was hard to walk, like there was a barrier trying to push me the other way. Toward
Draco’s tone was mild, his entire body relaxed, as if his actions today had been a small favor, hardly worth acknowledging. He wasn’t disturbed, or panicking about Harry’s panic, or demanding that Harry do anything other than exactly what he wanted to do. He looked at Harry like a
“Perhaps,” Draco said. “She taught me quite a bit too. I should write to her.” He straightened the pile of testimonials and placed it on the coffee table. “Did you read them?” he asked abruptly.
The blooms were thickest around Luna’s bed, where Draco had placed them the day she collapsed, but the vines had spread over the walls of the hospital wing, coiling through the headboards of all the stricken students.
But what if they used something else instead? What if they caused the reaction with a spell they’d already mastered?
Harry scowled. Dirt had stuck to the drying sweat on his skin and he was uncomfortably itchy, not to mention his aching calves and empty stomach. He needed a proper meal and a long soak in the bath, not an inquisition from his meddlesome (
“You’re welcome,” Draco mumbled, suddenly shy. Weasley was leaning against the side of the building, determinedly looking away, but Draco felt as exposed as a zoo animal, gawked at and unable to hide behind the transparent glass of the enclosure.
At that, Harry shook his head almost violently, wrenching himself away from the image. Malfoy jumped, and the movement seemed to shatter the last of his restraint.
Eyes wary, he placed his injured fingers lightly atop Harry’s outstretched palm. For a moment, it was almost as if they were holding hands.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded encouragingly. “You said that’s what the evil ice hooks are. And Hogwarts is using the flowers to purge the leftover Dark Magic.”
,” Draco continued, the haughtiness becoming less evident with every word. “I was unaware that it was possible for anything, ever, to feel as good as you just made me feel.”
– pupils blown wide, cheeks flushed, teeth bared and almost predatory – Harry was blinded by the desperate need to touch. The vines chafed against his wrists and grew tighter. His fingers ached to caress the skin beneath Malfoy’s jaw.
The neutral cream shade Draco had chosen for the walls seemed to gleam with subtle gold tones in the light from the fire. Harry had complained that the color was too bland and only agreed to it after Draco let him paint the kitchen a bold red, but now it looked incredibly inviting, suffusing the room with comfort and warmth.
Draco had offered to do it for her, but as usual, Maeve had declined, insisting that the shop needed to feel her physical exertion to know it was loved and cared for. Besides, she’d always add with a wink, it kept her spry.
Harry moaned shamelessly, and he felt Draco’s mouth curl into a smile. Draco ground their erections together, thrusting against Harry in a pace more frantic than sensual.
Harry had spent far too long experimenting with spice blends for his apple pie, and was only just popping it in the oven when everyone else was finishing up. There’d been a jovial air as everyone competed to steal portions of the best-looking dishes (while carefully avoiding Seamus’ burnt muffins and the strangely greasy looking soup Hermione had abandoned halfway through). The professor had blatantly avoided tasting anyone’s cooking, passed around a few flyers for an owl-post recipe subscription service, and then scurried off without a backward glance.
Malfoy stood up and made his way slowly over to the bed. He climbed up and crawled over to Harry, sitting close enough that they were almost touching.
Aside from that, Harry and Malfoy noted small wand malfunctions, spells not quite hitting their marks, odd smells after prolonged casting, and transfigured items briefly changing color.
Draco had finished the book over the weekend, reading for long hours into the night. Deciphering the clues sprinkled through the pages had given him a thrill, and he hadn’t deduced the identity of the murderer until the very last moment, only a page or so before the big reveal. He was not entirely impressed with the detective character – he often overlooked potential leads that were glaringly obvious to Draco – but reading the book had been –
“Does that happen often?” Hermione asked, after a beat of stunned silence. Her startled expression mirrored Harry’s own.
“Fascinating,” Draco murmured to himself, tapping a finger against Harry’s knee. “What made you think of that?”
“No, they couldn’t possibly,” Hermione said, face screwed up in concentration. She did not seem to have noticed Maeve. “Muggles may feel an obligation to someone who saved their life, but they have no magic to create an actual life-debt bond.”
The night of the Reclamation Ball flashed again through Harry’s mind. Malfoy ensconced comfortably on the garden bench – cheeks flushed from the crisp evening air, eyes dancing with the joys of discovery, fingertips caressing the delicate petals of flowers.
Impulsively, Harry entwined his fingers with Draco’s and nodded. “Yeah,” he said, before he could think better of it. “It is.”
But Draco could not seem to stop himself. And it was becoming harder and harder to keep guarding his heart.
They both laughed a little, and then Malfoy lay down in the grass. He tucked one arm beneath his head and closed his eyes, letting out a soft hum of contentment.
“Draco, no, I – I don’t want the first time to be like this,” Harry choked out. Pupils blown wide, Harry’s eyes roved over Draco’s body, catching on Draco’s bare thighs. Breathing raggedly, Harry tore his gaze away and rested his forehead against Draco’s. “I don’t want you to be forced, or rushed.”
Malfoy blinked, then seemed to consider Harry’s words. When he spoke, it was not the response Harry expected. “Do you want to be an auror?” he asked quietly.
“I’m not sure how to do this without you,” Draco admitted, and he wasn’t just talking about selling tea. The corners of Maeve’s eyes crinkled with tenderness, making it clear that she understood.
Harry closed his eyes against the burn of tears, forcing himself to breathe deeply and calmly through his nose. He tried to blank his mind, to focus on Draco’s body pressed against him, warm and alive. He wanted nothing more than to flee from the thoughts that plagued him.
“So we’ll help the flowers,” Malfoy said, finally looking away from his windowsill garden. His eyes caught Harry’s, steady and determined.
Harry’s traitorous heart gave one desperate throb that seemed to flash through his whole body. As Malfoy settled more comfortably beside him, Harry’s palms began to ache. He shoved them into his pockets and nodded roughly at Malfoy.
“We’re past the morning rush,” Draco said, nodding. “I’m sure Maeve could spare me for a bit. Do you want to come back to the workshop?”
“He arranged the funds so that I draw a modest salary from the organization,” Draco said, speaking normally again. “It’s similar to how the board members and employees are paid, though I make much less. I tried to say no, but Blaise refused to be involved otherwise.”
In the weeks since the incident on the Quidditch Pitch, Jaffey and Dahnroe had been methodically canvassing wizarding Britain, and their initial reports had been encouraging. The hooks were fewer outside of Hogwarts and seemed to be less firmly entrenched. The partners had been able to dispatch them even without the aid of the
But Draco hadn’t loosened his grip on Harry’s hand. Harry tugged on it nervously. “Was that ok?” he asked, voice strained. “That I told?”
,” Malfoy continued. “These should not be here.” With that, Malfoy trailed his graceful fingers along the stones beside him, and Harry finally saw it.
Harry felt the air crack, as if Draco had snapped a tether between them. He collapsed against the back of his chair, suddenly reeling. Being snatched out of that bubble of intimacy felt like plunging into icy waters, bones fracturing in the shock of cold.
“No!” Heat bloomed across Draco’s cheekbones at the vehemence in his voice. He wiped sweaty palms on his trousers. “I mean, well – it seems I got a bit carried away with dinner. There is far too much for just myself. Would you – care to stay?”
He could have lied. Harry might even have believed that Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and formerly posh gentleman, cooked while wearing perfectly tailored trousers and elegant, sapphire blue dress shirts that brought out the flecks of color in his eyes.
The sun on his face was pleasant and the colors of the strange flowers – this time, a pale medley of white, gold, and ice blue – seemed to suit his mood. The scent that wafted over him was soothing, lulling him to the brink of sleep. Just as he was about to succumb to it, he recalled how calming the smell of the blooms had been the night of the Reclamation Ball. He’d been all worked up – jittery from the pressures of the “adoring” public and unsettled by his reaction to the apparently incredibly fit Malfoy – but breathing in the crisp perfume of the flowers had instantly relaxed him.
Sizzling sounds came from the stove as Draco dropped the first pieces of bread into the frying pan. He leaned over to sniff something bubbling in a small pot. His face screwed up for a second, before he brightened and added a pinch of cinnamon.
Harry had not applied to the Institute, but he also had not been able to stop thinking about it, and finishing his dueling room had started to feel like a necessary first step. A way to prove to himself (and possibly to the Bodkin’s admission board) that he was serious about Defense and committed to following through with the practical side of his research.
“I don’t know,” Harry said slowly. “I don’t think we’ll ever really understand the Room, or how it works. But…” he trailed off, thinking.
Draco gasped. “Potter! That might be it!” His grip tightened on Harry’s knee. “That would explain why there’s an excess of this one specific kind of residue, even though the Death Eaters used a myriad of Dark spells! But how can we – oh.” The blood drained from his face, making the shadows beneath his eyes stand out starkly.
Draco was staring at the blood. He had dropped Harry’s hand and was massaging his chest like it pained him.
Rage was consuming Harry, quickly burning away all remnants of shock and pain. White-knuckled, hands clenched into fists, Harry was breathing in short, ragged bursts.
Harry knew he shouldn’t have said those things to him this morning. All he wanted was to run to Malfoy and melt at his feet. He wanted to take it all back, but he didn’t know how. He didn’t think Malfoy would want to see him.
“What’s this?” Blaise asked, voice deceptively innocent. “Bonding charms?” He ran a finger down the book’s spine as he looked across the desk at Draco, eyes dancing with amusement.
Harry gasped, back arching so violently that his chest rose out of the water. Draco stilled his finger with a smirk, and Harry whined at the sudden loss of sensation.
Harry considered that as he ran a hand through his sleep-mussed hair. He rolled his shoulders and rubbed at a crick in his neck. “Better,” he said finally. “You didn’t have to stay.”
They moved together, kissing more and more frantically as their bodies sped, as they lost themselves to each other.
“Alright, then,” Potter said agreeably, effecting an exaggerated shrug. “Cheers!” He seized a biscuit and held it out to Draco with a meaningful look.
It was the kind of smile that Harry had only glimpsed once or twice, and only late at night, when Malfoy was too tired to hide. It was open and warm and surprisingly sweet, and the sight of it, illuminated by daylight for once, rather than obscured by shadow, was more than Harry could handle. His heart took flight, and he very nearly fell forward into Draco in a rush of desperate arousal.
The dangling vines fascinated him as well, particularly the ones covered in thorny yellow flowers. He walked by them slowly, brow arched in challenge and a hand trailing lightly over the buds, as if he were toying with the danger of those viciously sharp spikes.
He smoothed his hands down Draco’s arms, then reached to take the parchment from him with gentle fingers. Draco’s grip tightened reflexively and the letter tore a little, but Harry managed to get it away from him mostly in one piece.
Harry sighed, wishing he had chosen to sit on Malfoy’s stool, or perhaps the floor, when they had entered the room a few minutes earlier.
Harry lagged behind Lavender for most of the run, his sleepless night dragging at him like chains on his ankles. By the time they’d made their way to one of the private practice rooms, Harry was pathetically winded. He tried to hide it from Lavender, keeping his back to her as they stretched, but she must have noticed, because she programmed the room’s defenses to a lower level than they had used in months. At this setting, the spells the room itself threw at them would be infrequent and mostly harmless, weak hexes at best, and they would come in too predictable a pattern to present much of a challenge. Harry almost protested, but Lavender’s eyes were sharp enough to make him hold his tongue.
Eventually, the footsteps stopped, and the staticky music of an old radio drifted down the stairs. Draco slipped outside then, not bothering to retrieve his cloak from the workshop, despite the heavy rain falling in bitter sheets.
Draco was stunned. He blinked at her before saying, slowly and deliberately, “I hardly think you, of all people, owe me any kind of apology about anything.”
“I understand,” Draco said. He had regained his composure when he saw Harry was taking his suggestion seriously. “There are other things you can do with Defense though,” he argued. “Or you can just learn about it and do nothing with it at all.”
Draco’s face broke open as he came, and Harry followed him over the edge without warning. He fell into Draco as his body exploded, his orgasm hitting with such power that it felt like everything he had ever been, everything he ever would be, was rushing out of him and into Draco.
Luna wrinkled her nose at him. “Silly,” she mumbled. “Draco invented a potion, didn’t he, Harry?” she asked, turning to smile warmly at Harry.
Draco beckoned to Lavender, who had been hovering nearby since Harry started kickboxing. She glided silently over the grass to join Draco.
Harry felt discomfited. He had been trying to distract himself, but the truth was, what had just happened had shaken his faith in this little pet project of theirs. He didn’t want it to be
Hermione’s voice faltered, and her look of concern shattered the fragile bubble of distraction the conversation had built.
Draco. Yours. You made mistakes, but you never did anything bad enough to have your magic taken away. You deserve this.”
Each new piece of this story, oh so gently explained, cheapened Draco’s relationship with Harry a little bit more. The apparition was nothing more than a trick, a fabricated and flimsy foundation that would surely collapse at the first hint of strain, burying all of Draco’s fearful hopes.
Harry paused, then bit down on Draco’s neck. “That’s so bloody hot,” he said, soothing the bite with his tongue.
Draco made a strangled sounding noise. His fingers clenched into the fibers of the rug as he held himself still for the space of one choked-down breath. Then, almost violently, he rolled himself on top of Harry and attacked his mouth.
Undaunted, Harry served himself and put the platter down. “I rather like the cooking class we’re doing this week. I’d only ever done it the Muggle way before. I might like to try –”
On Saturday night, Harry and Draco were sitting in the common room with Hermione, reading the last two of their pile of books from the Hogwarts library. Draco finished before Harry. He tossed his book aside unceremoniously and fidgeted with his shirtsleeves until Harry closed his own book with a sigh.
“Sometime, when the two of you are alone – bind his hands with one of your ties. Gryffindor colors.”
Harry nodded, a hint of challenge in his eyes. And Draco shied from it, even as everything he was, everything he used to be, rebelled at the idea of backing down from Potter.
If Harry had one regret in all this, it was the desecration of the flowers. Draco had thought, maybe, that only the blooms at the Pitch would have been affected by Jaffey and Dahnroe’s ill-conceived spell, but Harry and Draco had combed every inch of the castle and grounds while dispersing the remaining residual Dark Magic, and they hadn’t come across a single bud. Even the flowers that had exploded out of the Room of Requirement and etched themselves into Hogwarts’ walls were entirely gone.
“I simply cannot fathom anything else being the ‘threat’ the passage refers to. Everything appears to lead us right back to residual Dark Magic,” he mused, staring off in the direction of his windowsill plants.
Harry laughed and Draco scowled, but he didn’t pull away when Harry took his hand. Chewing on his opposite thumbnail and still obviously preoccupied, Draco ignored Harry’s attentions at first, not even seeming to notice the tender kisses Harry pressed into his palm.
“Ok,” Harry said, “but once Hermione knew, why did she tell us all those things about the Room of Requirement and how life-debts work? Why not just come clean at that point?”
Harry flushed, with irritation rather than embarrassment for once. “Believe me? Malfoy, you ran away!”
“That’s quite alright, Headmistress,” Draco cut in politely. “Harry and I would be happy to finish the work of cleansing Hogwarts.”
“I met a little girl who reminded me of you,” Harry added quietly, when he ran out of funny Quidditch details to share. “She taught me about magical sea turtles.”
“I know you need time to process things, Draco,” she said as she shuffled over to where he was standing behind the counter. “I was expecting you to go silent when I first told you I was leaving. But it’s been a few weeks now and you haven’t even mentioned it.”
Draco caught sight of Harry then and snapped his mouth shut, his face whitening. It made the circles beneath his eyes more prominent, as deep and dark as if he had taken another punch on the street.
He went obediently, though he did wonder why Maeve hadn’t sent this new applicant back to the workshop, as she had with all the others.
Harry swallowed hard and scuffed one of his new dress shoes against the ground. When Malfoy didn’t so much as glance at him, Harry finally broke the silence. “What spell was that?”
Harry had been a breath away from kissing him, and Draco had ruined it. And Harry was still here, not bitter or hurt or angry, willing to give Draco anything he needed, without ever demanding anything in return, without ever taking more than Draco was ready to give. Harry was so
Harry had been sure McGonagall would refuse Draco, but to Harry’s dismay, she had agreed, albeit with some trepidation. She hurried off to send a few more owls, and a mere two hours later she had presented Draco with a Portkey that would take him from Hogsmeade to the Ministry at 11am the following day. Travel to Azkaban would be facilitated from there.
Harry huffed out a dry laugh. “Yeah well, I’m in training for the very important position of ‘Quidditch spectator.’”
Without breaking eye contact, Draco wrapped his lips around the head of Harry’s cock. He sucked lightly, then pulled back.
Draco’s hand shook and he almost spilled too much Chardonnay over the vegetables. He steadied himself and set the wine bottle on the counter.
He might have laughed at himself if the feeling hadn’t been so raw. Trying to sleep without first spending enough hours with Malfoy had made Harry feel – hollow, somehow. And that was rather alarming. He wasn’t quite comfortable being so dependent on the other man.
“We didn’t realize at first,” Ginny said. Her mouth twisted wryly, the first hint of apology she had offered. “I didn’t even know the apparition was still happening until I found out Hermione was researching it. And Malfoy didn’t tell Blaise anything about it until recently.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but his expression was fond. Then his mouth drooped and he sighed. “You don’t think it’s silly?” He smoothed his fingers over the stone. “Spying like this?”
Ignoring him, Harry continued in a confiding whisper. “The grieving boyfriend is always the first suspect.”
Perhaps he should have been more direct. Abruptly demanding to know how this fool detective ever made it through the Muggle equivalent of the Auror Academy probably wasn’t the
“Connection,” Harry said again, moving a hand back and forth between them, as if mirroring the tethers of light. “Like our life-debts. Like our – love.”
And then his hand was in Draco’s pants, calloused and rough and entirely perfect, squeezing Draco with just the right amount of pressure.
“We’re the ones who paid attention, who figured it out,” continued Harry. “I figured out the hooks and you figured out the potion, but we didn’t finish it. The flowers are still fighting the residue and we’re – we’re not.”
Because Malfoy had shattered. His entire posture spoke of defeat, every inch of him dull and tired and beaten. But there was a wild look in his eyes of barely controlled panic.
“Yeah, you too,” Harry said. “I, er – worried, about you not coming on Sundays. I didn’t want to get in the way of you seeing your family, but Ron said it wasn’t because of me.”
It was only when Draco reached the bed that Harry noticed what he was holding. Dangling from Draco’s slender fingers was the black suit and fitted emerald waistcoat that he had transfigured for Harry, all those weeks ago. The one Harry had hidden away in the back of his wardrobe, unable to bring himself to un-do what Draco had made. Harry flushed as he remembered how many times he had stroked his fingers over the fabric, heartsick and miserable, back before Draco had ever kissed him, back when he thought his affections would never be returned.
“It was like a chemical reaction, then,” Draco concluded. “The magics fused together to create something new, to ensure we made good on our debts.” He paused, then groaned. “And if that’s what caused the apparition…”
“Use your head, Potter,” Draco groaned. “I’ll admit that the Hogwarts flowers could fit this description. We found the glass flower in the Room of Requirement, where you risked your life, but that certainly wasn’t the greatest act of sacrifice that happened here.” He flinched at that callous assessment and gave Harry a sheepish look. Harry just nodded and waited for him to continue.
A complex blend of Potions and Herbology, their lessons had been highly experimental and largely independent. Malfoy had spent the past few days sequestered in the front corner of the classroom, with no less than three cauldrons bubbling in front of him at all times. He worked feverishly, hardly even noticing the professor’s occasional lectures.
McGonagall adjusted her spectacles then, and her sternness melted away. “Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter.” She inclined her head to each of them in turn, smiling warmly. “Please accept my most sincere gratitude. You have shown remarkable fortitude in dealing with this threat, and at a time when you deserved peace and rest. You will both receive a Special Award for Services to the School, and I will ensure that you receive Ministry recognition as well.”
Draco’s eyes cut back to Harry’s. Harry wound his fingers anxiously into his wild mop of hair and just stared back at Draco, wide eyed.
Draco startled, then rushed to Luna’s bedside, Harry close behind. They settled on either side of her, Draco clasping one of her hands. Neville, Hannah, and Blaise were still sleeping peacefully.
“I don’t think we would have survived it, if not for him,” Luna stated calmly. Her matter-of-fact tone put Harry more at ease. “He brought soup most days, and he made sure we had blankets. He charmed them invisible. Isn’t that clever?”
“I collected the testimonials for you,” he said, gesturing to the paperwork in his hands. “In case you decide to apply.”
Draco stared down at Harry’s teaching fellowship application, eyes roving over the scrawled words that covered it. Blinking rapidly, Draco flipped through the attached pages. Harry had written a multi-scroll proposal detailing three vastly different approaches for incorporating the study of Aperiomancy into Hogwarts’ pre-existing curriculum. Additional sheets of parchment outlined the merits and challenges of each.
“I know,” Harry said. “But I’m not going to send anything to the Ministry. I’ll give it all to Draco, and then he can decide for himself.” Harry paused, his chest aching with the knowledge of just how often Draco spoke of being undeserving. It was like a reflex for him, so deeply ingrained that Draco might never see himself worthy of anything good at all.
Harry had heard that same soft sound enough times in the past few weeks to know immediately who it belonged to. So he turned around and nodded at Malfoy, gesturing for him to speak. Malfoy gave him a quizzical look, but he answered the question.
Draco made his way sheepishly into the main room of the shop and leaned against the counter where Maeve was mixing a fresh batch of currant scones. Her grey hair was held back from her face with a brightly colored headband, and flour dusted her temple, caught in the deep wrinkles of her forehead.
As he walked across the grounds and through the castle, Harry grew colder and colder. He knew it was nonsense, but he couldn’t quite shake the thought that it wasn’t the wintery weather, but Draco’s absence, that was freezing his blood.
Harry padded back to the kitchen and wrapped his arms around Draco in a comforting hug. “Of course I will.”
“Harry,” Blaise agreed, pausing as his fingers found the handle of his cup. He lifted it, but set it down without taking a drink. “Draco – the apparition, it’s my fault. Well, mine and Ginny’s, really.”
George and Ginny glared at each other a moment longer, George throwing a pointed look over his shoulder at Harry that made Ginny bristle. Harry found that – unsettling, to say the least, and was just trying to figure out if he should somehow intervene when Arthur burst into the room.
“I don’t regret being with you,” Ginny told him seriously, propping her arms on her bent knees. “But we would have both regretted it if I had stayed any longer.”
This morning, Harry had walked with Draco into Hogsmeade, and when they arrived, he couldn’t stop himself from making one last plea.
-" Malfoy made an odd, aborted gesture with his hand, like he wanted to grasp onto something, but was forcing himself not to – “was living at the Manor, I spent as much time outside as possible.”
Draco followed, propping himself beside Harry. His eyes were hooded, expression grave, and Harry felt a flicker of apprehension.
Harry swiped the crisps packets aside and crawled across the blanket toward Draco, not breaking their intense eye contact. Draco let out an undignified squawk when Harry pulled him into his lap, but then Harry was kissing him, sliding their lips smoothly together and sweeping a tongue inside his mouth. Draco sighed, every muscle relaxing as Harry held him close.
“At the end of fifth year, Voldemort tricked me into going to the Department of Mysteries. He put a fake image in my head, of Sirius being attacked there. And I went. Even though I knew I was supposed to be keeping Voldemort out of my head. Sirius had been at home, perfectly safe, but he went to the Department of Mysteries to save me, and he died there. Bellatrix killed him.”
Draco jerked back and started to interrupt. Harry smoothed his thumbs over Draco’s temples and pulled him close again.
Neville continued sitting with Malfoy after that, and when the two had shared a wide-eyed look of wonder over a potion that had turned a violent shade of blue, Harry had buried his head in his hands.
Malfoy’s eyes darkened and he tightened his grip on Harry’s hand. “Pansy’s wand has been shocking her. Whenever she tries to do magic on herself. Hair spells, that sort of thing. She said it feels like a stinging hex, but stronger.”
They sat quietly then, Harry waiting patiently as Draco stared into the distance and plucked absently at his cuffs. Finally, he squared his shoulders and undid the buttons at his wrists.
Harry chuckled as he plucked at his drenched t-shirt. He gave Draco a wicked grin. “Well sweetheart, with any luck, after tomorrow, you’ll be able to fantasize about my dirty, sweaty clothes to your heart’s content.”
Heart fluttering erratically in his chest, breath ragged and quick, Harry practically tore his clothes off. Unable to wait a second longer, he stumbled forward into the bath, the water splashing the tiles as he surged toward Draco.
me?” Malfoy finished, hands fluttering unhappily at his sides in a way that belied his indignant tone. If Harry hadn’t known better, he’d have thought that Malfoy’s feelings were hurt.
“Potter, there was Death Eater magic at the Manor, there was Death Eater magic here,” Malfoy said softly. He was holding out his hands, palms raised – weighing the two situations and finding them the same. “These flowers are in both places. There has to be a connection.”
Still smiling, and absurdly relieved to move past the wanking incident, Harry grabbed a piece of toast and crunched into it. “This is good,” he said, surprised by the taste. “It’s sweet.”
They lapsed into silence. For a moment, their humor had brightened the room, almost as if Luna’s ineffable spirit had descended, brushing away their worries as easily as cobwebs. But in the wake of their laughter, the darkness rushed back in, crushing Harry and Malfoy under its weight.
Draco had been halfheartedly batting Harry’s hand away, but at that comment he choked on a guffaw. He coughed, then took a swig of juice, cheeks coloring faintly.
unfurled inside him, and he understood exactly what Draco wanted – to leave no space between them, to join their bodies as intimately as they had their hearts and souls.
“Whatever you need, sweetheart,” Harry murmured, kissing lovingly down Draco’s throat. “You can have whatever you need.”
“Your research is incredible, Draco. You deserve the chance to pursue it. To write those books.” Harry looked at Draco again, and his eyes were shining with emotion. “The war is over. You deserve to have more than one choice about how to live.”
Draco’s eyes went distant. “I knew who you were from the moment you walked through my door, Draco Malfoy. I keep up with the papers, and not just that Prophet rubbish.”
Harry had hugged Draco close, breathing him in, pressing tender kisses to Draco’s cheek and forehead as he murmured a goodbye. Draco had turned to go then, but Harry had called him back.
Harry shrugged. “Ask Hermione, then pretend to read the books she threw at me until she told me the answer.”
“Take me home with you, Potter,” Draco suggested, words a seductive purr, “and perhaps you’ll find out.”
Harry pressed lightly against Draco’s hole and his finger slipped in easily. He moved it slowly, in and out, his own cock throbbing desperately at the feel of Draco’s arse clenching around him.
So he had gone to bed early, when Malfoy had, resigned to a restless night. Harry never slept well when he turned in before two in the morning. There was something about the deep hush of late night (and, he supposed, since he was trying to be honest with himself, something about the company of Malfoy) that calmed him enough to sleep.
Flushing, Draco averted his eyes. Harry hummed softly and tilted Draco’s chin up to capture his lips again, teasing him with kiss after kiss until Draco was dizzy with want.
Draco forced out, the exasperated tone belied by the amusement in his eyes. “Most of these potions are expired. The tub was just the easiest place to sit after I laid them all out.”
“Thank you, Luna,” Harry replied. He risked a glance at Draco, and found that he had gone unnaturally still.
When the Stinging Hex hit, Harry was balanced on one leg, his other foot above his head in a high kick. He flinched and his movement stuttered, a tiny break in his concentration, a fraction of second in which he wobbled precariously. But then he was swinging his leg downward, using his momentum to spin toward the new threat.
Harry glowered at him. But then he snatched the tin from Ron’s hands and shoved two biscuits angrily into his mouth.
Harry slid his hand up Draco’s chest to his shoulder. Bringing his other hand to Draco’s back, Harry gently laid him down against the pillows.
Draco’s magic, normally a pleasant fizzling buzz, sparked against Harry’s, like firecrackers in his veins, setting his blood alight. Harry’s toes curled up, the sudden resonance only heightening the sensations already pulsing through his groin.
After the three of them collapsed in quick succession, McGonagall had evacuated the eighth year dorm. In hindsight, it seemed glaringly obvious that the eighth years would be most affected. More Death Eater activity on the grounds of Hogwarts meant that the residue would be more abundant there than inside the castle.
All at once, the iron fist that had been tightening around Harry’s heart shattered. He had already let go of Ginny. This was a phantom grief, as inconsequential as it was false.
“I was unaware you had excelled at Aperiomancy, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, interrupting the sounds of enthusiastic chewing. “Auror Driffield seemed quite certain that none of the eighth years showed any promise. But if you have progressed to such an advanced level, I am sure I can persuade him to tutor you during your final term, if you are interested?”
It was an accomplishment, even if it was the least complex part of magically converting the large room at the back of the cottage into an experimental dueling space.
racing about in dizzying spirals, leaving scant enough room for themselves, let alone more practical thoughts. And so, entirely naked and without the wherewithal to even attempt to cover himself, Draco looked up into the astonished face of Harry Potter.
“Well come on, Harry! On your feet!” she ordered gleefully. “Are you going to teach me that trick or not?”
“Did you just –” Draco tapped a finger against the edge of the counter as he struggled to find the right word.
He should have left then, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to. His gaze lingered on Potter a moment longer, and a tiny wisp of his concern bled from him. “I think you’d better get yourself that sandwich though,” he said, brow creased. He told himself it was confusion, not worry. “You look –” Draco hesitated. Potter’s shoulders had hunched almost imperceptibly, as if he anticipated an insult. “– tired,” Draco finished, not unkindly.
“The most complex potion I could manage,” Draco murmured, sounding almost as affected as Harry. “Before my trial.”
Harry pressed a thumb to the pulse point of Draco’s wrist. Burying his nose in the side of Draco’s head, he breathed in the clean scent of his hair –
The silence quickly grew awkward between them, and Draco hoped the exhibition matches would soon start. Harry had mentioned that Weasley would most likely also be attending this event, and while that did not bother Draco, he certainly had not expected Weasley to sit with him. He did not imagine Weasley would want to. Pity it was a weekday, or Hermione might be here too.
The sun was beginning to set, and the wildflowers seemed as bright as fireworks in the fading light. A mild wind ruffled the grass and set the tree branches stirring. Harry rested his head against the tree’s trunk, allowing the perfumed twilight to calm him. He was still a bit shaken by the revelation in the kitchen, but that was a problem for later. Harry still didn’t know quite why, but Draco was shamed and hurting, and Harry’s burgeoning feelings would only complicate things.
Draco still did not respond, so Harry lifted his head. Draco was staring at him, face frozen in a stricken expression. His hand clutched his t-shirt, directly over his heart. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I never should have said those things to you, about your nightmares. You were fine, and then I –”
Draco’s eyes flicked away, but not before Harry saw the shadow of pain that lingered there. There was a moment of silence. Draco pressed his thumb to his ring, then blew out a harsh breath and smoothed back his hair.
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, the years you spent at Hogwarts were not kind to you, and I realize you did not often find allies among the staff.”
It had felt like a vigil, listening to those old stories, losing himself in Draco’s memories as his own heart mourned the connection he and his parents had lost too soon.
Draco pushed away from the counter to fetch the baking sheets, grumbling as he went. “I ran into someone. Who is
Draco cleared his throat, surprised to find himself standing upright rather than reduced to a melted puddle at Harry’s feet. “You want me to come over?”
A stout man in a violently blue suit approached the counter then, cutting off Draco’s skeptical reply.
Harry threw up his hands in exasperation, but only grumbled a little. He hugged his knees to his chest and watched as Ron worked steadily through the rock pile, aiming at and hitting targets increasingly far out. The tiny clinks the stones made against the ice were strangely satisfying, and Harry felt the tension in his neck begin to loosen.
Malfoy had listened to Harry speak of Remus, and he had not replied. But he had let Harry be vulnerable. He had accepted Harry’s pain, and shared it, and now he was choosing to trust Harry with something of his own.
Draco shrugged lightly, but Harry saw his fingers tense where he was gripping his knees. “The Manor, perhaps? It seemed plausible that there were protective charms meant to safeguard the Malfoy heir.” Draco’s voice grew clipped then, his tone full of bitterness. “I hated even thinking it. I do not want to be indebted to the Manor, or the Malfoy name. I much prefer being grateful to the flowers.”
“You were so relieved –” Harry trailed off, worried he was about to force Draco to relive something painful.
The whim had struck as they’d crossed the grounds toward the common room. A twilight breeze billowed by them, catching in their robes and whispering mischief in Harry’s ear until he could no longer bear the thought of stillness.
“Ok,” Harry readily agreed. “Let’s do it.” He turned to McGonagall. “Professor, I promise it won’t knock me out again. If you only cast one spell, and I only use a tiny piece of my magic, I’ll be able to access the residue without overwhelming myself.”
“Hello, Mr. Zobinski,” Draco greeted him, darting one last worried glance at Blaise. “Will you be having your usual today?”
, was far too honest an answer. So he settled on the moon. (That’s what he had been thinking about, after all, before Malfoy had appeared and invaded every last inch of Harry’s mind and body, turning all else to dust.)
Leaning forward, Harry let his mouth hover tantalizingly over Draco’s clothed erection. He brought his hand back to his balls and began massaging them gently through his trousers. Draco hissed and his hips bucked. Harry let the tip of Draco’s cock breach his lips, but did not close them. Instead, he blew out a teasing breath. Draco whimpered, involuntarily spreading his thighs. Harry removed his mouth.
Draco darted a startled look at Harry as his left hand moved to cover his right, reflexively hiding the silver band on his finger. But then he shook his head with a tsk of his tongue, as if chiding himself.
Malfoy didn’t sit up, but he did turn his head slightly, as if he was listening. Harry took a deep breath, struggling to keep his tone light and conversational.
“I’m sorry, I –” Draco reached out, but hesitated before touching Potter. He let his hand fall awkwardly to the bed between them.
“Blaise!” Draco snapped. “What kind of Merlin-forsaken excuse for a café is this?” He clapped his hands over his ears and hissed scathingly, “Is this what I’m meant to be angry about, or do you have another delightful surprise in store?”
McGonagall broke off her incantation mid-word, as if her wand inspection had been nothing more than a ruse to give Harry and Draco space. Harry felt the back of his neck heat, but the soft crinkle at the corner of McGonagall’s eyes spoke of pride and fondness, and Harry could not help but feel touched.
Harry’s brow wrinkled, but he decided not to ask, hoping the silence would encourage Malfoy to continue. He was not disappointed.
Malfoy rushed forward and dropped to his knees, reaching out to cup the bud in one gentle palm. The petals shivered, and all at once, the flower bloomed.
“I had not considered that before,” Draco said, nodding slowly. “I’ll keep it in mind while researching. Thank you, Granger.”
Alarmed, Harry pushed his chair away from the table. He leaned forward and locked eyes with Draco. “I promise I didn’t invoke a life debt.”
Some of the tension dropped away from Draco’s shoulders, as if he was relieved to be asked a practical question. “I suppose I should do some research, though I’m not entirely certain where to start. Bonding charms, perhaps?” He paused, one finger tapping against that silver ring he always wore on his right hand. “But we weren’t near each other before it happened, so I don’t see how that could be it.”
Draco pulled his knees into his chest, resting his chin atop them as he gazed out across the garden. His lips were slightly parted, and though he was completely still, his entire body seemed to quiver on the edge of motion, as if his thoughts were racing through him, sparking in his veins. He was glowing with potential, a heartbeat away from discovery, a heartbeat away from bursting into flame.
“How long were you watching me before?” Harry asked, his hands finding Draco’s inside the hoodie’s front pocket. “I didn’t hear you come in the gate.”
Harry quickly looked away, somewhat abashed. He steadied himself by digging his fingers into the dirt beneath him and carefully asked, “they bloomed?”
Harry nodded, then hesitated, obviously waiting for an explanation, but Draco chose not to provide one. He wanted Harry distracted right now, not focused on magic.
. The thought of Malfoy secretly being friends with Hermione, when Harry might have lost him forever, was shockingly painful.
Harry breathed out a startled laugh. Fire flickered in Draco’s eyes for another moment before guttering out. He turned his head to the side and echoed Harry’s laugh, sounding a bit sheepish. He stood abruptly and moved to join Harry on the sofa, sitting far closer than he had before Harry’s nap. Their thighs brushed, sending a flare of heat up Harry’s entire side.
They rarely interacted much before the evening hours, and as the sun rose higher in the sky, Harry had to admit that it was rather novel to see Malfoy lit up by the golden tones of daytime. His hair looked richer somehow, with dozens of shades of blond that made Harry think of wheat fields and autumn harvests.
Harry glanced at Draco then and felt his magic flutter, flaring up happily to meet Draco’s questing fizzles. The touch of Draco’s magic was a question, and Harry knew the answer, because Draco’s eyes were shining with the echo of everything Harry had imagined, offering him everything he could ever want.
Harry’s heart lurched pathetically, then sank, completely ignoring what he had just told it. Harry sighed and headed to the door.
Harry’s focus remained on Draco for one breathtaking heartbeat before he tore his eyes away to grin at Weasley.
“Why –” Malfoy elaborated slowly, as if he were speaking to a child - “do you want to be able to do this, Potter? I wasn’t under the impression that your studies mattered much to you, as your Potions marks can attest.” His arms were crossed and he quirked one eyebrow at Harry.
Draco nodded curtly, sunken eyes still fixed on Luna’s face. Harry thought she looked almost otherworldly laid out across the starched white sheets of the hospital bed, like an elusive creature you could never be sure you hadn’t dreamed. He was suddenly terrified she would fade away, dissolving before their eyes, insubstantial as mist.
“How did you know to pay the – the snake thing?” Draco asked with a shudder. “Is it because you’re a Parselmouth?”
Tossing and turning in his bed afterward, Harry had felt almost feverish, the heat of his anger transfigured neatly into shame. Draco was lost, stubbornly clinging to the past. But Harry knew better than anyone how hard Draco was trying, and how miraculous it was that he had opened up to Harry at all. Draco did not deserve to be screamed at and made to feel small.
The clock struck noon, and one of the café’s servers let out a jubilant cheer. Startled, Draco jumped. He twisted in his seat to see a tall, gangly youth in an apron hurry over to the corner of the room and press a button on a rectangular black box. Loud music started up, the booming drumbeats vibrating through the room. The sound seemed to reverberate inside of Draco, amplifying his already buzzing anxiety until he felt as though he were coming apart.
Red lights burst through the trees as Lavender hunted for him, shooting stunner after stunner in an attempt to impede his movements. He was playing right into her hands by lingering here. Frustrated with himself, Harry slinked around the side of the boulder, guessing that Lavender had already made her way to his side of the divided forest. He scrambled across the brook as noiselessly as possible.
“So, what type of potion would you make out of this?” Harry asked, prodding at the remnants of the fried fish on his plate.
He didn’t finish the thought, but he didn’t need to. For a long moment, the past descended, widening the gulf between them. The shadows that had been creeping into the room grew more ominous, morphing into specters of men in masks, a skull and snake, Muggle bodies writhing in the air.
Harry grinned. Birdsong and the smell of lilacs warmed Draco’s back, creeping in through the open door.
Maeve wrestled a few tins of tea from the shelves by his door before shuffling fully into the room. “You’re free?” she said skeptically. “You looked pretty absorbed in those notes just now. You were chewing on that pen cap, you know.” She shot a wicked grin at him. “And
And when Harry described how he first did it – how he had felt the magic move beneath his skin – Malfoy traced a finger along the path Harry described, from his heart up across his chest and down his arm, leaving goosebumps in its wake.
Malfoy chuckled dryly and dragged himself off the bed. He crossed the room and ducked behind his wardrobe. A minute later he emerged, wearing a loose long sleeve shirt.
Harry dodged left, easily deflecting the oncoming blow with a raised forearm. But he had overextended himself, and before he could correct his stance, his feet were swept out from under him with a well-timed kick. He hit the mat hard, breath whooshing out of him in one painful gust.
“Oh, I – I should have asked about that, before I – fuck, sorry. Do you want it, er – the other way?”
Malfoy’s smile immediately dropped away and he met Harry’s eyes with a glare. “Is this an interrogation, Potter?”
Still, by Friday night, he was more than ready for some air that was not heavy with the odors of brewing. Harry had wanted to spend the evening out at the lake, sitting with Malfoy at what he was more and more frequently thinking of as
Harry frowned, then saw that he was indeed worrying at the edges of the letter he’d brought to show McGonagall. He hadn’t even realized he’d taken it out of his pocket.
And besides, Harry didn’t have much else to do at the moment. Things were a bit boring, and – and lonely, with Ginny gone.
“I know this is easier said than done,” Draco said now, tucking his legs beneath him and shifting on the sofa to fully face Harry, “but don’t be embarrassed. There’s no need.”
“Went for a run,” Harry grunted, pushing past Ron into the tidy kitchen. It was Harry’s favorite part of the cottage, the one room he made a point of keeping meticulously clean.
“It’s not the potion,” Harry assured him, sitting up. “I’ve wanted it for a long time. I just didn’t know how to ask.”
The barest hint of a smile softened her stern countenance, and Harry chuckled wryly. He wriggled a bit then, trying not to be swallowed by the plump armchair McGonagall had conjured for him. McGonagall herself was perched regally on an elegant wingback chair with green accents that matched her robes.
Weeks ago, when Draco had finally decided to submit the appeal application, he had told himself that it was ok, because he wanted to use his magic to do good. He would help people, invent new potions, put healing into the world instead of suffering, for once.
“Do you want to sit?” Draco asked, gesturing toward the part of the room beyond the cherry blossom screen.
Malfoy drew in a sharp breath and looked out over the lake. They were silent for a time, and Harry began to trail his fingers through the water.
“No,” Draco said. He turned his head and smiled shyly, finally losing some of the tension that he’d held since Harry had entered the room. “Thank you, but I was working at the other counter, and I took care of the mess before coming out into the shop.”
“This is a light vanilla sponge, spiced with the cherry tea you helped me make,” he explained, pulse calming with each word. “The whipped cream is infused with one of my winter teas, an especially rich chocolate. I know it’s not even properly autumn yet, but I couldn’t resist the flavor combination.”
Draco took a deep breath, intending to tell her that wasn’t the same, intending to calmly carry on with his closing duties. Instead, he burst into tears.
With that, she took the remaining vials and escorted Tahlyn and Pomfrey from the room, already in deep discussion about follow-up care for Luna, Neville, Hannah, and Blaise.
“I’m serious,” Harry insisted. “I know he and Ginny fucked up. But he’s your best friend, and you need him.”
Harry lay flat on his back on the cobblestone walkway of his back garden. He was drenched in sweat, but the sun felt pleasant against his face and his breathing was finally beginning to slow.
Draco frowned in confusion at the abrupt subject change. “Well, technically I have not proven that it even works with Potions, yet. All my work is theoretical. But… possibly? Is there something specific you have in mind?”
Draco cried out, and Harry’s scalp pulsed as Draco’s fingers yanked at his hair. Harry sucked Draco harder, relishing the bright flash of pain, like a physical tether to the depth of Draco’s want.
he’d given in answer to Harry’s question about his clothes. The implication had not been subtle, and Harry’s eyes had flashed in response. It had been
“No, it’s brilliant,” Draco said. “I mean, I think it is. I haven’t tried any because it still needs to be dried.”
“I suspected as much,” Draco said gently. “They seemed to be offers of employment? I caught a few phrases here and there, but I tried not to read them. I did not wish to pry.”
He was practically vibrating with tension by the time he turned to find Draco holding one of the few remaining mugs. It was large, painted in shifting shades of glimmering blue.
“It doesn’t,” Harry assured him. “Is that what that notebook is for?” he asked, nodding toward Draco’s pocket. “To write down experiences?”
“I just thought, if you’re just as good as me, and you’re not going to be an auror –” Harry trailed off.
Beneath the sharpness of the hooks, Harry had found the magic of the flowers. It was like dipping his fingers into the tin of balm that had once soothed his Quidditch injuries. Laughing aloud in relief, Harry armored himself in it. The hooks retreated, the pain fading away.
He needed to read it again, desperately. But his eyes would not focus on the spindly script. There was a tight feeling in his chest, as if his gasping breaths were not giving him enough air.
“Yeah, he is clever,” Harry whispered, thinking of the way Draco’s fingers would tremble when he waxed poetic over some obscure piece of theory. Harry pictured those same fingers gripped anxiously around a wand, struggling to charm the blankets before his father could see.
“Oh really?” The grin Blaise gave Draco then had something peculiarly close to triumph in its edges. Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion.
Draco tugged down his cuffs, then swept toward the door. He snatched his cloak from the hook and paused on the threshold, his back to Harry, fingers clenched tightly on the jamb.
When Draco shuddered back into existence, the sensation was much less violent than when he had left it. One moment he was drowning in nothingness and the next he was sitting calmly on the foot of the bed. His ears rang with the aftershocks of a loud crack, but otherwise, there was no physical discomfort. Draco took a tentative breath, and promptly choked on it.
The caution and uncertainty in his voice went straight to Harry’s heart. Pushing himself off the doorframe, Harry moved to Draco and caught him by his elbows, tugging him gently forward.
Holding her wand in her left hand, Maeve reached forward with her right, thumb and forefinger pinched together. Slowly, very slowly, she began to spread her fingers apart. She repeated the motion several times before Draco noticed the change.
“You wish, Malfoy,” Harry whispered, and it felt like a ritual, like something he could rely on, the easy rhythms of their old rivalry offering both comfort and strength. Inexplicably, the past relaxed its grip and suddenly Harry could breathe again.
Draco hadn’t come to bed in over a week now, only succumbing to sleep in restless bursts when he’d doze off head in hand, still hunched over his lab table. It was the last week of term, Christmas was only a few days away, and Draco’s projects were in their final stages, apparently needing constant monitoring and adjustment. Harry could not have been prouder of Draco, but still, he had been feeling rather – neglected.
“Potter, why would one of these glass flowers grow at the Manor? There was no selflessness there, no acts of noble sacrifice.” Draco shook his head in irritation. “The book can’t be right.”
Draco’s eyes darted to the side and he hunched into himself, neatly dodging the hand Harry had reached out to him.
Harry expected another eye roll, or at least an insult about his clothes, but instead Draco’s expression grew distant, his eyes troubled.
Harry looked at Draco now, his cuffed shirtsleeves revealing just a hint of pale skin, and realized he wanted to burn to the ground any business that had ever made Draco feel unwelcome. Wincing internally, Harry shook off the irrational anger and shrugged at Draco. “I was hungry. Thought you might be too. Besides,” he added with a smirk, “you told me you wanted me to bother you at work.”
“I may already be working on something like that,” Draco confided, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck.
The word crystalized against Draco’s lips like sugar, sparkling in the intensity of his awe. His mouth had fallen slightly open and there was a dark flush high in his cheeks.
The trees blurred past, the sounds of birds and the lapping waters of the lakeshore receding as blood rushed in his ears. His breathing grew more and more labored. This wasn’t right. He could normally run three or four laps of this trail without getting winded.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest. The room seemed darker somehow, as if the idea of tomorrow had come between them again, looming over the space with a knife-like grin.
“Something that was always there in the background,” Harry said. “And you don’t think it’s important, but then something shifts, and it’s the key to everything.”
Draco was a tad – miffed, that Harry refused to write any of it down, especially as Harry had proposed exploring Sentiomancy as his winter term interdisciplinary project. But McGonagall didn’t seem bothered, and to Harry, transcribing it would have felt wrong. Much of what he did with Sentiomancy was instinctual, and he wanted to build up those instincts, not degrade them by relying on a reference sheet.
Draco blinked slowly at him and his fingers twitched. He pressed them into his thighs and frowned. “What? Potter, I –”
Malfoy pressed in closer to Harry, but didn’t question him further. Anxious though he might be, he seemed willing enough to wait for Harry to recover. Harry could feel the heat of the other man’s thigh against his own, and focused on that until his pulse slowed, letting Malfoy’s presence ground him.
“No, Potter.” He shook his head firmly. “I won’t be able to go through with it unless you stay here.” His eyes skittered away and he hesitated, but he took a breath and locked his gaze back on Harry. “I need to know that you’re what I’m coming home to.”
Harry looked over his shoulder just in time to see Draco take one tiny step backward, the movement so negligible that anyone else would have dismissed it as a meaningless fidget, if they noticed at all. Harry though, he understood Draco, and he saw the action for what it was – a crack. One that would spread to shatter Draco’s fragile, carefully constructed composure.
A raindrop fell from the spindly branches of a nearby tree, hitting Draco squarely between the eyes. He scowled, but stubbornly settled in to wait Blaise out.
“When you said I didn’t belong with you,” Harry added, “it felt like when I was reading through all those awful letters.”
The snap of the closing oven brought Draco back to himself. He flinched as his mind caught up with his mouth.
He closed his eyes and saw a riot of color swarm the darkness. Warmth rushed through him, and he suddenly felt dizzy – he was floating up into the starlight, he was sinking into a bed of blossoms, he was flying and falling and everything in between.
“No,” Draco said slowly, wishing that Harry hadn’t cut himself off. He desperately wanted to know what Harry had been about to say. “Weasley was – kind. Far kinder than I deserve, really.”
Last week, after Harry had admitted to himself that Malfoy was right – that whatever was in the flowers was likely infecting Hogwarts – he had started to see more and more signs of it.
Draco swallowed the words, tongue plundering Harry’s mouth. His fingers roved across Harry’s chest, moving downward to toy with the hem of his t-shirt, little bursts of flame igniting in Harry’s veins where Draco’s skin brushed his.
Harry laughed again, marveling at the man in front of him. Draco’s hair was tousled, and a hint of genuine pleasure softened the tired lines around his eyes.
“No seriously, Potter, get out. I have to shower before class,” he ordered, still smiling indulgently.
“I suppose that would explain the barriers, in a way,” Draco mused, after taking a steadying breath. “We can’t leave each other until the requirement is met, almost as if we’re trapped in the Room.”
Draco knew better than to argue. He would never lie to Maeve. “That’s different,” he said. “Madelyn is your family.” The words felt hollow, just like when he had said them to Harry.
The lack of inflection was alarming enough, but even worse was his unnatural stillness. Harry was used to a Draco that brimmed with life – fingers in constant motion, eyes bright and calculating, energy dancing under his skin. This Draco resembled an inanimate corpse.
“Fucking HELL,” Harry shouted. His hand darted away from his cock to scramble for the sheets, and he had himself covered before Draco could even blink. “I got the lube beforehand this time,” Harry groaned, sitting up and covering his eyes with his hands. “I don’t need anything! Fuck, Draco, I’m so sorry.”
His eyes snapped open and he found himself staring up not at Draco, but at Lavender, a mischievous smirk tugging at her scars as she balanced on a thick tree limb. Before Harry could raise his wand, she hit him with a Full Body-Bind and flipped herself effortlessly out of the tree.
“What are you doing, Potter?” Draco asked suspiciously. He had straightened up, and was staring at Harry with his arms crossed.
“So...” Harry said, pushing through the awkward silence, “have you liked any of the workshops we’ve had? Know what you want to study next term?”
Harry scrambled toward the counter, then hesitated. “Oh, but – I can heal him.” When Maeve started to shake her head, he added, “I’m good with cuts.”
“Oh,” Draco breathed, his heart sinking. He trained his eyes on those dizzying orange knots. “The apparition bond really
Draco suddenly missed the garish shades of Novelle’s with an intensity that was as gutting as it was illogical. It had hardly been half an hour since they left, but Draco wanted so badly to flee back to its warm confines, to sidestep whatever devastating thing Blaise meant to tell him, postpone the pain until another day.
Draco goggled at her, then looked at Harry in mute appeal. Harry suppressed a laugh and raised his eyebrows at Draco, cocking his head toward Hermione in silent challenge. Draco scowled at him, but the fierce expression failed to cover his apprehension.
Draco had just gotten the main course in the oven when a sharp crack echoed through the flat. He jumped, startled despite having been desperately awaiting that exact sound for over an hour now.
“I’ve been doing some research into our little flower problem, though I haven’t had much luck,” Malfoy explained. His mouth twisted wryly.
“It’s because I found this,” Harry said, pulling a piece of parchment from his pocket and handing it to Draco.
It had been a nearly incoherent stream of shudders and words, but Maeve had somehow understood. She had accepted that her machinations were harming more than helping, and finally agreed to leave well enough alone.
McGonagall peered worriedly over at Tahlyn. The Healer did not pause in her casting, but she flicked a hand at McGonagall in a
He scuffed his trainers against the hallway carpet, not wanting to track mud into Draco’s flat. Soon enough, the soles were pristine, but Harry still did not knock.
“Oh, a good ten minutes, I’d say,” Maeve said. “I had a leisurely poke around our discontinued stock, waiting for baking inspiration to strike!”
“No, Draco, it’s ok,” Harry cut in. “I wasn’t fine. Not really. I’m still not. But I think I need to accept that, and think about – all this, if I want to actually be fine someday.” He took a steadying breath. “So please don’t apologize.”
After all, Harry never would have taken such an interest in the flowers if he hadn’t seen Malfoy summon the golden dust. And then they had gone and discovered the glass-like flower together. And so, against Harry’s will, Harry and Malfoy – and the flowers, of course – had become inextricably entwined.
As the fire popped and crackled, Draco had taken Harry apart, worshipped him with lips and tongue and clever fingers, whispering
His heart clenched at the sight of the shutters, piercingly blue against the warm grey wood they had agreed on for the outside. Draco had insisted on the bright azure, arguing that they’d always have a bit of their own clear sky on cloudy days.
“You can stay if you want,” he said casually, facing away from Harry as he folded the collared shirt he’d been wearing and placed it inside his wardrobe.
Harry babbled desperately. His face was a white mask of anguish, and his fists were clenched now, as if he felt Draco’s pain as acutely as he would his own.
“Just some light reading,” Draco remarked, leaning back in his chair and propping an ankle on his opposite thigh. “You do know how I feel about magical theory,” he finished with a casual shrug.
“I know the term ‘kickboxing’ now, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes, but he continued to caress Harry’s knee in a way that belied the feigned annoyance. “Either, really. Both. I want to hear about you.”
“What?” Harry demanded. “They’re really hard to see! It’s not like we all walk around banging our noses against the wall.”
Draco’s shirt slipped from his shoulders as he moved his hands down his body, dipping his fingers beneath his waistband teasingly before unfastening his trousers. He pushed them down and stepped out of them, then straightened, clad only in his tight black pants now. His shirt still dangled from his wrists, cuffs buttoned tight, but it concealed nothing. It was simply an accessory to his beauty, a white veil that served to highlight his nakedness, to accentuate his allure.
They finished their tea in silence. Draco trailed after Potter as he carried the mugs to the kitchen for washing up.
Heat flashed through Harry at the touch, shocking in its intensity, but easily ignored. The long gashes running across Draco’s index finger and thumb were already beginning to bleed again, now that he’d removed the cloth.
Harry didn’t know why he had said it or what he had meant exactly, but he didn’t regret his words. Even if he didn’t understand why, it still felt true.
With one last sympathetic look at Draco, and a firm reminder to keep her apprised of their progress with an antidote, McGonagall swept imperiously from the room, likely to get in touch with her contacts in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry hissed in a breath and snatched his hand away from Draco. There was a loud crash, and Draco’s eyes flew open to find Harry towering over him, the chair he’d been sitting in knocked to the floor.
“Nonsense! I did precisely what you set out to do. And your modifications to that diagnostic spell worked beautifully. You just needed a bit more confidence and you would have pulled that potion residue right out!”
“Well maybe it’s a side effect of being locked in your basement for months. Ever think of that, Malfoy?” Harry remarked nastily, with a cruel twist to the word
“Why Luna?” he’d asked, gaze lingering on her too-pale skin. “Her spell was the first to hurt someone, and now this? Why did it have to be her?”
Harry was standing at the edge of the mat, pulling on his gloves. He caught Draco’s eye and beamed up at him, radiant as the sun. Draco gave him a little wave and Harry winked, before turning back to his trainer, who seemed to be offering some last-minute advice.
Harry rolled over onto his stomach and gazed down at Malfoy, wondering if maybe he should leave. But then Malfoy let out a full-bodied laugh and sat up. He leaned back against his wardrobe with his hands behind his head. He sighed happily, and that was all it took. Harry was staying.
It took five full seconds for the words to pierce the haze of sleep still blanketing Harry’s mind. When they did, he jerked upright and stared wide eyed at Draco.
Harry’s hips stilled, eyes drinking in this pristine, ethereal being that was somehow his. Lean muscles softening the hard lines of him, kiss-swollen lips and sharp cheekbones, the faintest trail of hair winding toward his slightly angled, beautifully flushed cock.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco actually seemed to think about it. He muttered to himself and patted at the pockets of his trousers. “No,” he said apologetically. “But – how well stocked is your kitchen? I’m certain I can find
Draco let his head fall to the desk with a groan. He’d already met with five people today, two more than had been on Maeve’s original list. Would it never end?
Grinning widely, Blaise winked. “Well Draco, I know you’re against the pure-blood ones, but I think we might need to look into some marriage spells, after all.”
According to McGonagall, her contacts from the Department of Mysteries had arrived on Monday. She assured Harry and Draco that the partners had taken Draco’s potion and would be handling the elimination of the residue.
Suddenly wary, Draco was uncertain how to proceed. He dithered awkwardly by the table, but when Harry did not look at him, Draco decided to finish preparing dessert. He got two glass bowls out of the cupboard and began to fill them with layers of cake, whipped cream, and fresh berry compote.
Harry hesitated, then dropped his hand. He turned back to the book, knowing Draco would speak when he was ready.
It was slow at first, Draco lifting up and sinking back down, watching Harry’s fluttering eyelids, following all the tiny muscle movements of his face. Harry was so beautiful, and his cock stretched Draco perfectly, filling him up, making him whole.
When Potter hadn’t reappeared at the teashop, Draco had assumed the two apparition incidents had been a fluke. Some odd magical flare-up, perhaps, like the physical manifestation of a headache or a sneeze. Potter hadn’t looked well, after all, and two weeks was certainly long enough for the problem to have passed.
He opened his eyes with a sigh. “We didn’t get along, back in school.” He broke off another chunk of shortbread and chewed it slowly before he continued. “It was my fault, really. I was not – kind, as a child.”
“I’ve been reconsidering the idea of residual Dark Magic,” Draco said. “Do you think we gave up on it too easily?”
McGonagall seemed confident that by November, they would all discover a promising path forward and be able to narrow the focus of their studies. Harry wasn’t so sure; it seemed more likely that the coursework would highlight all the gaps in his magical knowledge, rather than reveal a previously undiscovered passion or talent, but you never know. Besides, if all else failed, he supposed he could always become an auror.
“We thought it would pull you together,” Blaise went on, “once, maybe twice. Get you talking. Break the ice. And we hoped you would decide to keep seeing each other once it wore off.”
Risking mental whiplash, Harry hauled his focus back to Ginny and Blaise. They weren’t what was worrying him, but he didn’t know how to explain that to Draco, and it was a good thing to hear anyway. He did want Ginny to be happy.
Not that his life has changed all that much. Harry was slowly coming around to the idea that Hermione may have had a point, and that maybe he wasn’t quite as heartbroken as he should have been.
Draco covered Harry’s hands with his own and tilted his chin to kiss him softly. “I like your hands in it,” he admitted in a whisper.
Harry’s face was so close, his eyes alight as they locked on Draco’s. He smoothed a hand over Draco’s brow, slipping his fingers into Draco’s hair.
Draco reached for Harry’s hand, squeezing it tightly. He stroked his other hand gently through Luna’s hair. Her breathing slowed, growing deep and even. When it was obvious that Luna was soundly asleep, Draco stood. He leaned over to kiss Luna’s forehead and whispered, “You’re welcome.”
Draco jumped, his head snapping toward the voice. Ron Weasley sat next to him, hands in his pockets and a smugly amused expression on his freckled face. Draco had always assumed Weasley was as unobservant as Harry, but the man had obviously noticed the direction, and intensity, of Draco’s stare. Draco bit back a curse and tried to smile.
But Harry could not possibly know that, could not possibly understand that the very idea of an appeal had shaken Draco to his bones, threatening the fragile peace he had built around the broken shards of his life.
But he couldn’t quite shake the feeling that running off to the Quidditch Pitch would be disrespectful to Luna and Padma. How could they indulge themselves after everything that had happened? Shouldn’t they be putting all their energy into investigating?
A smile unfurled across Draco’s face, vibrant as an unexpected wildflower in the depths of winter. He kissed Harry once more, then entwined their fingers and pulled him toward the door.
As the other man stalked closer, Harry went entirely still, a very different kind of adrenaline flooding his veins.
“For giving those kids a chance.” The words came out thick, emotion welling up again in Harry’s throat. “It’s more than I ever had.”
Draco huffed out a breath and shook his head again. “Remind me how you managed to save the world?” he teased.
“You said the Death Eaters might have done something to change the residue somehow –” Harry said, Draco nodding along - “but what if they did something to their wands?”
“Yes,” Draco answered. He wriggled the ring loose and shyly offered it to Harry. “It’s the only piece of jewelry she had left that my father had not given to her.”
Malfoy hugged his arms more tightly to his chest. When he answered, his voice was almost inaudible. “Yes.”
Figuring that flooing directly into the Weasley kitchen might prove a bit much for Draco, Harry had opted instead to arrive at a local wizarding pub, hoping that the fresh air on the walk to the Burrow would help settle Draco’s nerves.
But Draco never came, and Harry’s legs had eventually given out on him, cramping painfully and forcing him to stretch out, defeated, with his back to the door.
Draco stood at the edge of the clearing. His head was bowed slightly, a fringe of hair obscuring his expression, but Harry didn’t need to see Draco’s face to know he was in turmoil. The air around him was alive with energy, his magic fizzling around him in increasingly frenetic spirals.
With a beleaguered sigh, Draco shifted his attention to Blaise, who was picking at his scone glumly.
Harry turned to face him and leaned wearily against the wall. “Distract me,” he asked again. “Please.”
Because this brilliant, curious man with messy hair and Muggle clothing and twitchy, excitable fingers was who Draco Malfoy was supposed to be.
The promise in Draco’s voice when he demanded Harry take him home had been arousing enough, but the subsequent Tube ride and lengthy walk had nearly done Harry in. He had wanted to apparate them, but Draco refused, preferring to slowly torture Harry as they drew closer and closer to their destination.
Draco dipped his head and suddenly his tongue was teasing Harry’s collarbone, and Harry succumbed to the pleasure. He threw his head back and moaned shamelessly, letting himself be swept out to sea.
The parchment crinkled as his fingers tightened, craving the physical reassurance that these words existed, that past Harry had actually written them, that some part of him had desired something of Draco.
They paused at the door of their cottage, fingers entwined as they stood beneath the bright blue shutters and welcoming grey wood. The last several weeks had been so busy that they hadn’t returned here, nor had they discussed Harry’s casual suggestion that they live in the cottage next year. Now though, the idea seemed to hover overhead, a gatekeeper demanding an answer before they could enter the place that might soon be their home.
Harry hit the ground hard, the wind briefly knocked out of him. Before he could recover, Draco was kissing his neck and jaw. “Harry, you’re brilliant!” he crowed. “
The flower shivered, then absorbed the sickles into itself, before curling back into the gate with a distinctly satisfied purring sound. A moment later, the ivy shimmered and disappeared as the gate swung open. Beyond it, there was a thick, impenetrable wall of fog.
They rutted together, fingernails digging into skin as they clutched each other more tightly with each delicious slide of their cocks. Draco was panting now, releasing tiny, desperate whimpers that Harry wanted to snatch from the air and stitch into his soul.
In the garden that day, listening to Draco’s shames and secrets, Harry had looked. And he had found a pathway of desire that stretched back through all their years of schoolboy taunts and grudges.
Harry had tried to interrupt, to insist that it would be just as hard for Draco, but Draco spoke over him.
Despair and anger warred in Harry, and without thinking about it, he twisted his body the way he would if Will had him locked in a hold. Inexplicably, the spell released him, and he stalked toward Lavender. Her eyes widened, but she reacted quickly, aiming a Stunning Spell at him. He blocked it, instinctively moving his arm as if he was kickboxing, rather than in the standard wand motion of a Shield Charm. The force of his shield knocked Lavender back and she staggered. Before she could recover her stance, Harry stepped close and swept her feet out from under her, making use of a kick he had perfected over many weeks training with Will.
But Harry couldn’t settle. Something was bothering him, chipping away at the coziness around him until he could ignore it no longer.
But doing things like that was how you wound up with a false reputation for being “deranged” or “obsessed,” and Harry was trying to keep a low profile this year. So he tried to listen to the Headmistress as she told them all about the new curriculum she had devised for their eighth year.
Draco had more of a sweet tooth than he ever would admit, and Harry longed to indulge him. All week, he’d been daydreaming of the holidays. It was only mid-November, but their prolonged battle with the hooks had taken its toll. Harry was more than ready to spend a few carefree weeks plying Draco with sugar and seeker games and sex. He didn’t know if Draco would want to spend the school break together, but he hoped. He played with recipes that would tempt Draco’s palate, and he hoped.
Harry’s eyes lingered on the glass flower from the Room of Requirement. It sparkled merrily, its brightness seeming to sharpen the pang of melancholy that cut through Harry. He closed his eyes, mind suddenly whirring with hooks and flowers, flames and ice, battles fought with the aid of colorful blooms.
“Be with you in just a moment, dear,” Maeve called from where she was poking at something in the oven. A nutty, almost spicy scent wafted out.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but when Draco’s eyes narrowed, he stuffed it full of lasagna instead. The sharp look had abruptly reminded Harry why Draco had started cooking in the first place. It was his last connection to magic, one of the very few pleasures he allowed himself, and Harry would never deny him the comfort of that.
Harry gave Draco Malfoy the words he had never spoken, the words he had tried so hard to hide. “I know coming back from death was the right thing to do. But when the war ended, I wished I hadn’t.”
Harry’s moment of hesitation felt like an eternity. The room was spinning before Draco’s eyes by the time Harry stood and pulled a thick stack of parchment from the bookshelf.
And now, all but collapsed on the bench and pain still echoing through his body, he was more than grateful to bask in the familiar comfort of Malfoy.
Hermione shook her head. “The episodes always follow some type of injury, and then the unharmed person involuntarily apparates to the side of the person who is hurt.”
The three of them were sitting around the table in Harry’s sun-dappled kitchen. Though Draco held himself rather stiffly, he had been perfectly polite, and Hermione seemed entirely at ease. She had hardly reacted at all when she stepped out of the floo to find Draco and Harry squabbling over the last triangle of cheese toastie. Draco had just poked Harry in the ribs and taken a triumphantly huge bite.
Harry woke, warm and dry, with his head on Draco’s chest. Draco was staring up at their ceiling sky, fingers trailing gently over Harry’s spine. Harry snuggled closer and kissed Draco’s cheek.
Draco’s tears stopped, giving way to a series of quiet moans. His legs trembled, his hands and toes curling up tightly. Harry saw the moment when the darkness let Draco go. He arched his back, and the lines of his face softened as he opened his eyes and stared up at Harry, the deep grey pools reflecting nothing but trust and love.
When he darted a glance at McGonagall, she was sipping her tea as placidly as if her former students confessed love for their childhood archnemeses every day of the week.
, and Harry could no longer hold back. He loosened, magic pouring from him in undulating waves. He felt it flowing into Draco, felt Draco’s magic flowing into him. Draco gasped and threw back his head, as if he could sense it too.
“I’m sorry,” Draco breathed, running his hands up and down Harry’s arms. “I shouldn’t have doubted you. You’ve never given me any reason to doubt you. I love you. I’m sorry.”
By the time they reached the castle doors, and after several failed attempts to interject, Harry decided he might as well let Draco get on with it. He’d tire himself out eventually.
Draco glanced sideways at Harry, and from his expression, Draco could tell that he had seen the light of the sign too.
It was not a surprise, exactly. Not after the way Harry had looked at Draco on the night of their impromptu dinner party, bold and certain and full of barely contained
“C’mere,” he growled, seizing Draco by his shirt collar and pulling him closer. Draco’s posh trousers slid easily over the porcelain, and a moment later Harry was swallowing Draco’s startled gasp. Their noses banged together as they kissed roughly, Draco almost knocking Harry off the rim of the tub in his enthusiasm.
Draco’s breath left him in a quiet whoosh. Harry smiled and kissed him again. Everything seemed to go silent and still, nothing between them but fluttering eyelashes and shared breaths.
Draco went deathly pale. “What? Why would she –” he shook his head incredulously before finishing with a pathetic little whisper – “but she promised.”
“Wonderful.” Maeve clapped her hands together and spelled away the wards that had hidden them from the customers. “Time for cake!”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, staring down at their hands. Then his mouth tightened and he wrenched himself away.
Draco had been independently studying advanced Potions for years, often alone, but also through extra lessons with both Snape and Slughorn. One of the things he had previously mastered was a process that Healers used for adapting spells into ingestible antidotes.
“Their blood?” McGonagall repeated, pressing a hand to her chest. Her expression was drawn, almost fearful.
“No?” Harry echoed tentatively. He held his breath, hardly daring to believe what Draco seemed to be implying.
Harry pressed his hand more firmly against Draco’s chest, rubbing his thumb across his sternum. “And?” he prompted.
There was a rustle in the underbrush behind them and they both jumped. A small animal darted across the shore of the lake. An owl glided silently after it, a graceful grey ghost on the hunt.
“Oh,” Draco sighed. “Well, alright. Do you have their titles? Perhaps I can track them down elsewhere, or –”
– when McGonagall finally bustled into the room. She looked down at all of them with an uncharacteristically soft expression on her face. Smiling warmly, she began to speak.
At least until a scolding voice rang out and startled him to his feet. “It’s more polite to use the door when you’re coming into someone else’s shop, you know.”
“And you,” she replied, “always name the teas.” With a wink at Harry, she bustled away to attend to her other customers.
Draco blushed, and then surrendered, stammering out his agreement only a heartbeat before Maeve burst in, snatched up his papers, and harried them both out the door.
“I wasn’t.” Draco smirked at him. “I think I caught a glimpse of McGonagall’s mysterious Unspeakables.”
Rolling closer to Draco, Harry kissed his cheek lovingly before returning his fingertip to Draco’s hole. He circled the entrance teasingly, then finally pressed inside, his own moan tangling with Draco’s when he felt that tight, grasping heat.
Draco hesitated, eyes flitting toward Harry and away again. He shifted slightly on his chair, putting some space between their legs. “I was in the shower after work. It had been a tiring day and I spent too long relaxing in the steam. When the water went cold, I decided to deal with the discomfort and wash quickly, but my shampoo bottle was empty. I got out of the shower to fetch another from the bedroom –” he looked at Harry again, the tip of his tongue darting out to wet his lips – “but Potter appeared before I could leave the room.”
The cottage door creaked shut behind him, and with silent tears coursing down his face, Draco began the long walk home.
Draco had said that the Death Eaters might have done something to affect the residue. It had seemed like a solid idea at first, until Harry had spent more time researching advanced Aperiomancy (or Sentiomancy, as he still affectionately called it). The thing was, there just weren’t a lot of ways to tamper with magical residue. It existed independently of the spells it was born from. To consciously create a new type of residue, the Death Eaters would have had to invent a specific spell for it, or –
“Yes,” Draco said. He had been scowling down at his sandwich, but now he set it aside. Raising his head, he pinned Harry with a weighted look, his irises the heavy grey of rainclouds. “And storm like you – fierce, unstoppable – and green like your eyes. And bloody
But Draco had not forgotten. Draco was still enchanted by the flowers, and if this was what Draco Malfoy was up to this year, then Harry
“Because you knew I wouldn’t let you do it alone, no matter how I felt about it,” Draco said, still more question than statement, even though he was nodding.
He had nodded off against the wall, sitting cross-legged on top of the Potions table. After one wild moment of disorientation, his eyes focused on Draco.
When the crack of apparition came, for one wild moment, Draco thought it was the sound of his ribs snapping in his chest, his bones no longer able to contain the howls of his heart.
