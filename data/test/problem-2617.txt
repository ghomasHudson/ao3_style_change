“How did Hagrid get into Godric’s hollow.  Pettigrew is still alive.  Shouldn’t the fideleous have held?  Or did he already have the secret?”  Draco asked with obvious curiosity.
Harry quickly found a spoon with blackcurrant jam placed in his mouth before he could protest.  It was delicious, despite the fact that he still felt slightly sick from the amount he’d eaten at the Burrow.
Hermione decided that there wasn’t going to be a better time to bring the subject back to wands.  There was definitely something strange about the wands, and it seemed she was the only one to have realised.  “There is one other thing, I’m slightly confused about.” She started sheepishly and looked at Kingsley, who encouraged her to continue.  “Harry’s wand was broken last year, and he started using Malfoy’s after he stole it from him.  You said there were three wands in play.”
“Really.  But we can’t do anything until you’re placed there.  And we probably need to find a place to take him where he’ll be safe.  No one can know who we are right now.  And if anyone finds out we have him, they’ll try and take him from us.  So we need to get some money, some identities, and a place to stay.”
“It’s just me.  I don’t care.  Fluff half the notes and I’ll still think it’s beautiful.”
“Say I’m thinking about trusting you… not that I believe a word your saying… What do you want me to do…?”
“Fine, but don’t be surprised if next time you miss breakfast you end up with a dozen Howlers screaming at you” Ron winced, clearly remembering something unpleasant. “How did you end up with a kitten anyway, it’s kinda cute I suppose.” Ron reached out to stroke the fuzzy creature.  Rather than purring contently as it was doing with Harry it reached out a paw and dug its claws into Ron’s hands, drawing blood.
“That’s not true Scorp.  They all care.  Dad asks about you in his letters.  He and Draco are really worried, and I’ve seen the stack of unopened ones your father’s sent you.  I’m worried.  I miss my friend.  Lily’s the most worried of all.  She’s blaming herself.”
“Okay Father” Scorpius replied, smiling to himself.  His and Al’s plot was working perfectly.  His Father always insisted on new robes first and so had suggested to Al that he try and get to Madame Malkin’s for 9.30am. If all went to plan, they would have at least half an hour in the shop to talk.  It would be the first time he had seen Al in four weeks and he missed the company of his friend.  They owled at least twice a week, but with their fathers’ being reluctant to interact with each other, he hadn’t been able to see his best friend since school broke up.  Both he and Al hoped that if they managed to “accidentally” bump into each other, he might be able to get Father to agree to Al coming to the Manor, or for him to go to the Potters’ at some point over the rest of the summer.  They had tried a variation of the same plan last summer too, but it had failed. This year they had put more thought into it and were sure they could pull it off.  Scorpius had spent most of last summer bored out of his mind.  In his first few years at Hogwarts, summers had meant holidays abroad to France or Switzerland, but after his mother had died, Father had stopped that.  Now summers meant days sat in the mostly empty Manor with the house elves for company. Father sitting in his office working.
Harry took a deep breath.  He had a pounding headache and was exhausted.  He just wanted to curl up to sleep and Sirius was testing his precarious control over his emotions.  The ritual had taken a lot out of him.  He had relived not only every horrible moment of Tom’s life, but his own and Draco’s as well.  It was shocking that both he and Draco were able to function at all right now.
Teddy ordered starters and mains for the two of them, choosing a couple of milder items, as well as a few with a little more heat that the two of them could share.  The waiter poured them both out glasses of champagne before he left.  Justin took a tentative sip.
“Biased idiot.”  Draco smiled warmly as he says it, however.
“Harry, what makes you think you have to apologise for that.”
“It’s just…” Harry wasn’t quite sure why he was saying this “I could try the potion.  If I turn into a Stag then…”
Harry didn’t quite know what to say.  He’d enjoyed his time teaching the DA and running the training classes at the Auror academy, but he’d never thought of returning to Hogwarts to teach.  He also knew his leg, however much it had improved over the last few months, still wasn’t up to full time work and dealing with a whole host of teenagers.
“Plus Narcissa in all likeliness.  Although that is dependent on whether she can deal with seeing Draco again.”  Blaise had once told him about Narcissa’s last conversation with Draco.  It had happened just before Draco was sent from the Ministry holding cells to Azkaban.  She had told Draco, that even though she loved him, that she couldn’t deal with the person he’d become.  And she couldn’t be there to see him completely destroyed by Azkaban.  Then she’d left for France and not returned since.  Harry hated her a little for what she did to Draco.  Harry was the one who’d stood up for her and allowed her to be pardoned.  He’d also been responsible for Draco’s dramatically short sentence compared to every other marked Death Eater.  Because of Narcissa’s words, Draco spent his time in Azkaban reliving every awful thing Bella had ever done to him and others and believing that he was exactly like that.  That he was the worst of humanity.  Just because he had a condition that she had passed on to him, and he couldn’t do anything about.
“Draco, you have been through far too much.  More than he realises, I think.  I think the best thing for us to do is all sit down together.  I think you need to talk to him properly about your fears, otherwise they will keep on eating at you.  And you know what happens when you let them.” She looked pointedly at the plate of pasta that he’d managed to mush up with his fork, turning it into an unpleasant looking mess, without having eaten more than a handful of the pieces of seafood. “Do you think you could manage a slice of this pizza?  It’s really very good.”
“You sent me a fucking Howler.”  Harry held himself back from shouting, but knew his voice was cold.  “A Howler.  What the hell did you think you were doing?!”
The elf popped in with a crack.
“Oh.. I keep forgetting that.  I think I freaked out a few people.”
Hugo sighed, then did something Scorpius couldn’t see.  The slide had turned back into a staircase.
“I had Harry set up the blood protection wards.  You were asleep.” Draco said, as if Sirius was being supremely stupid for having not worked it out.  It was a tone Draco had used with Harry all too often.
“So you won’t do it again.”
“No.  Don’t go after him Pansy.” The same tone was detectable. Something between a laugh and tears audible in his voice.  “His daughter’s pregnant.”
“You feeling okay?”
“Plus, I think guilt over everything may have amped up all of our birthday and Christmas presents this year from both of them.”
“I do.  I just don’t know what I’m supposed to say.  And what if she brings one of the others with her.  I can’t face them yet.  I also don’t want the bloody media or the Ministry catching wind of me being out in public.”
“Of course we can.”  Harry replied.  “Come on lazy bones” He added to Draco as he pulled him off the sofa and onto the floor.
“Yes Daddy.  She told me how sorry she was about how she reacted when she found out about the baby.  I apologised too, which made me feel a lot better about everything.  You and Angelina were right.  We did need to make up.  Then I talked a bit about what Tabitha said today, and what Pansy told us.  I didn’t feel ready to tell her what I decided yet though.”
“How drunk are you guys?” Ron exclaimed, looking round at the collection of glasses and empty bottles.
“Get a plate!”  Hermione admonished.  “And you’re not eating the whole lot of them today.  You can take them into work tomorrow and share with George and the others in the shop.”
Lucius Malfoy looked truly shocked at that statement.  He spent several long seconds examining Harry’s face.  Harry didn’t know exactly what he saw there, but as the curiosity didn’t disappear Harry went on.
Harry snorted.  “Without you, we’d both already be dead.  Just because your connection is different, doesn’t stop it being just as important...  Like Sirius’.” The last words were heavy with sadness.
“Still not talking then?”
“Does she know about Lucius yet?  I assume the Ministry contacted her too.”
“I’m getting him out of there.”  Harry said the moment Blaise appeared in front of the fireplace.
Blaise did as he was told and took the hand of his very confused looking Father in law and practically dragged him into the house.  Harry, who had let go of Blaise to take Draco’s hand again, led him into the house after them.  When he stepped through the front door Draco stopped in open mouthed astonishment.  Instead of walking into a house they walked into the grounds of a Manor house, almost as large as his own in Wiltshire.  Harry and Blaise had really found and done up the Potter Manor.  The home they owned, but for some reason no one in the Potter family had bothered to live in, or even work out its location, for at least 100 years.
“Oh. Mr Potter.”
“I was visiting the boys yesterday when you arrived and stayed with them overnight.  I thought that you and I could catch up this morning.”
“It’s okay.”
Draco helped Harry to drink a potion that he recognised as one of the ones Narcissa had used in the first weeks after they’d rescued her.  It tasted awful.  Thankfully, Draco had a glass of water waiting.  Draco held the glass and tipped it gently so Harry could drink both for his thirst and to wash the taste of the potion out of his mouth.
They ended up staying in the hospital wing for a further two days before they were released, thankfully at the same time.  Blaise had managed, somehow, to persuade the nurse to let him stay with Draco as the Slytherin dorms were empty at the moment.  She wasn’t pleased about it but allowed him to take the bed next to his friend’s.  By the end of the two days, Blaise was exhausted.  He had had to ensure that the beds were separated every time Pomfrey came to check up on them. Day and night.  Once they had left the hospital wing, the question was then what to do next.  Draco wanted to go down to the dungeons and stay there, as it was empty.  Blaise didn’t think it was a great idea though, as Professor Snape could walk in on them down there, and there was no way they’d be able to hide Potter if he turned up.  It was Potter that came up with the best place to stay.  He showed them up to the 7
“So that’s all five.”  Sirius stated.
“I’m glad Harry.  You always did have good friends.”
Trigger Warning:  Suicide attempt - occurs off scene but some descriptions of aftermath.
“Thank you, ma’am.”
“I also think that maybe we should talk to Doris together at some point.  She might be able to help us from fucking it all up this time.  If we’re going to really try this.”
“I suppose I could sleep on the sofa.”  Blaise said sounding unsure.  As soon as he’d spoke both sofas disappeared.  Draco started to laugh.
“We did used to do that.  Maybe we could try that in the morning.”
“You know why not.”
“A good idea at the time.  At least when you turned up on my doorstep begging me to help you run and hide you had the excuse of being eighteen.  You’re supposed to be grown men.”
“Off with you then.  We’ll see you in two weeks.”
When the others entered the room just over an hour later, they were sat working on homework.  Lily was sat up at the table writing an essay, whilst Scorpius was led back on the sofa, using the feather Lilly had conjured as a quill to make notes in his Ancient Runes textbook.  Rosie had walked over to him when she entered and peered over his shoulder at the book, seemingly interested in passage he was translating.  Then embarrassingly, she whispered in his ear that his shirt was buttoned up wrong, his fly was undone and that he should probably try and cover the trail of bruises on his neck before Al arrived.  He saw Hugo whispering something to Lily as well, and from the way she blushed he assumed she was getting a similar run down on her appearance.  Lily was looking slightly dishevelled and it was obvious that the two of them hadn’t been sat doing homework for the last hour.  He’d rushed off to the nearest bathroom and groaned when he saw his appearance in the mirror.  It didn’t take much to fix it, but however well Al seemed to take his and Lily’s relationship, he certainly didn’t want to flaunt what the two of them did in private to his best friend.  Dashing out of the bathroom he went to the kitchens before heading back to the classroom and grabbed a hamper of food from the house elves for the group.
“Very noble of you Potter.  But there’s no changing who I am, or what I did.  The world has every reason to hate me.  You know that they hate and mistrust me.  Even the word of the Saviour isn’t going to change that.  You’ve already done too much for me in the public eyes.  Now let me up.  Please Potter.  Don’t make this worse than it already is.”
Harry and Draco waited nervously outside.  Harry thought about how different things were back in this time with him.  In his old life he probably would have headed straight into the hut and grabbed the horcrux himself, without thinking it through.  Now though, he had people who cared about him who would be cross if he risked his life that way.  He knew Hermione and Ron cared about him, but they’d always joined him in the rushing in headfirst before.  Now though, he had Draco, who was much more cautious than he was, and adults like Remus and Narcissa, who reminded him to keep a level head.  Sure, Sirius was reckless.  He was the epitome of a Gryffindor.  But that was one out of four.  There were also the babies to think about.  He couldn’t let anything happen to him.  He had to protect little Harry and little Draco.  They were everything to him.
“Now that sounds like an idea.”  Blaise interjected, and Draco knew he’d made a mistake with his last point.  Making irreverent comments like that never ended well for him when Blaise could hear.
“Aren’t you cute?”  An old woman stopping at their table said, looking down at the two babies.  “You look so similar.  Are they your brothers?”
Draco nodded, ever so slightly, and Harry immediately came towards him, careful to avoid stepping on the broken glass and mix of potions on the floor.  He was only wearing socks on his feet.  He wrapped Draco in his arms.
“He most certainly would.” Rose answered for Al, looking disapprovingly at her friend.
“Leave the bottle.  You can leave us.”  Draco seemed to be regaining control of himself as his dismissed the house elf who quickly left. “Potter grab me my cigarettes.”
“Daddy,” Lily said as she entered the room.  “Can you please take me home?  I want to see mum.”
They spent several long minutes just staring at each other, hands roaming and touching to make sure the other was really there.
“Squeeze my hand as tight as you need to.  Okay.”  Draco added.
“Shit, you’re serious aren’t you.”
“I want to make a cake for Teddy.”
“I had a bunch of people from Hogwarts here not long after I graduated.  We all got really drunk and a few people were dared to try and get up there.  It was not a good idea.  I had to call the elves over to clean the mess of vomit that resulted.”
Al joined them for the rest of the journey.  Rose, Hugo and the twins joined shortly after Al’s untimely interruption and they all chatted inconsequentially.  The whole group eating Chocolate Frogs and Pumpkin Pasties from off the food trolley until the train pulled into Hogsmeade.  Getting off the train they got into the horseless carriages. Scorpious knew they were pulled by Thestrals.  Father told him that when he went back to school for eighth year, over three quarters of the students could see them, rather than the usual handful.  He wasn’t sure whether he would have wanted to or not.  In the end he hadn’t been given a choice about being with his mother as she died.  Lily went with Hugo and the twins whilst Rose, Al and Scorpius rode in another carriage.  Scorpius tried his best to be enthusiastic whilst talking to the two Prefects about their new responsibilities and the pressures of their OWL year, but his thoughts kept wondering back to the music and Lily’s hand trailing up his thigh.  His distraction lasted through the Sorting and the feast.  He kept looking over to the Gryffindor table hoping to catch Lily’s eyes, but she seemed deep in conversation with Hugo whenever he looked over.  Finally making his way down to the Dungeons and the common room, he crawled into bed.  Putting up silencing charm around the curtains of his four-poster, he played his experience on the train with Lily in his head, praying that his charm held so Al wouldn’t overhear as he relieved the tension in the best way a teenage boy could think of.
Draco rolled over and looked up at Harry.  He reached up to his husband’s face and pulled him down into a kiss.  “I really love you.  I’m just scared of what will happen next.  That things will change.”
“We need to keep him with us until we can trust he has ours’ and baby Harry’s best interests in mind as far as keeping our secret is concerned.  And keeping baby Harry out of the Dursley’s hands.  I don’t trust that Dumbledore won’t try and force baby Harry to stay there no matter what.  It’s what he did to me.”
“Yeah.  Sorry for being such a secretive prat.”
“I don’t dance.”  Harry remembered his own miserable attempts at dancing at the Yule Ball with Parvati Patil.
“Actually.  I don’t want to know.  Just draw it for us.”  Harry did not need to know what Sirius had gotten up to in school.  It was far too weird to think about.
“Yes.  We’ve talked about this.  Neither of us want to raise this baby.  I know you’re with me on that at least.”
Harry thought about it.  “No.  Anything I say to Sirius, you can hear too.  You are the most important people in my life.  I trust you.”
“There’s a potion you’re meant to soak in every evening.  I’ll put fresh bandages on after.”  Blaise rolled his eyes.

“Fuck you, Death Eater scum” Ron said, as Draco pushed past them.
“You know this means we’re not finishing what we started.”
“Absolutely.  She knows what it’s like for me in England.  She knows I never wanted to marry a woman.  I was doing that for her.  But I know that more than anything she wants me to be happy.  She will help hide us.  I think Blaise would help too.  He has a villa in Tuscany.  We can head there from the Manor.” Draco said, thinking out loud.  “I’m sure he’ll be a little shocked to see the two of us turn up unannounced, but it can’t be helped.  We can work out the rest there.”
“Shhh, Harry.  It’s alright.  I’m here.”
“Prat.”
Blaise half dragged, half carried, Draco back to the common room.  He helped Draco get into his pyjamas, then, rather than leaving Draco to his own torment, crawled into the bed with him and let Draco cry himself to sleep in his arms.
Both Ron and Hermione stared at him open mouthed.  It was obvious that Ginny had failed to let them know that part of the story.
“No.  I’m not telling you who I’m living with.  There is something I haven’t told you though Ron.  I’ve been putting it off, but… I’m not living with a woman, okay.  I’m living with a man.  Well two men actually.”
Harry found the least disgraceful t-shirt from the pile on the floor and pair of jeans to get dressed in.  He finished his toast, dumping the plate back on the kitchen side and made his way to the centre.  It was just before 11am when he arrived, and staff were helping the kids wash their hands ready for snack time.  He nodded to Angelina when he walked in and headed straight to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and help the volunteer in there get the vegetables and fruit cut into easy to handle pieces and make up a jug of water.  Snack time with a bunch of 6 month to 3-year-olds was a messy affair, with all of the adults busy helping the little ones.  Harry sat near Hattie, who was now nearly 7 months old. She was busy mouthing a slice of peach and there was the evidence of the piece of banana she’d enjoyed before that, all over her hands and mouth, as well as the highchair in front of her.  Watching her eat he saw her become evidently bored of the fruit, deciding to throw it on the floor before grabbing for her beaker full of water.  The water too seemed to hold little interest.  She took one sip before it followed the fruit to the floor, and she started to bawl.  Harry quickly grabbed the sticky baby and picked her up, uttering soothing sounds.
“Lily, we know you want the baby to be adopted.  It’s a brave decision and both Draco and I respect it completely.  What we didn’t know is what kind of adoption you wanted.  Whether you’d be willing to let someone you knew adopt the baby.  Draco and I have discussed this at length, and if you’re not comfortable with it that’s okay, we don’t want to put any pressure on you.  But, well, we thought maybe, you could think about the two of us adopting the baby.  You’d get to know them.  I know it would be strange being your own child’s sibling, but we would make sure we were completely open and honest about the situation.  We don’t want this to be some dreadful family secret that comes out years down the line to traumatise everyone.  We want to help.  And we want to know them too.”
“Your right, love. Sod it all, we’ve lived with this secret for too long.  If they see I was able to get over the view that all Slytherins are evil, and that people shouldn’t be accountable forever for mistakes they make at sixteen, maybe they’ll realise what idiots they’ve all been.  We’ve never really given anyone a chance to deal with this and get over themselves.  We got over ourselves didn’t we.  I’m not telling you how we got together.  That’s just for me and Draco.  I will tell you when we got together.  It should be more than enough for you to work the rest out.  We got together nearly 25 years ago.  Around two or three months after the war ended.”
“I don’t know either.  I’m always here for you though.  So are Blaise and Draco.”
“You’re okay my Harry.  I’ve got you.  I’ve always got you.”
“Anything interesting in there today, Love?” Harry inquired.
“The potions help.  Tara helps.  He won’t become like her.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am though.  I am the same person.  Every time I hear you call me that despicable muggle name, I know that I am Voldemort, not Tom Riddle. I know every time you call me Tom it feels like something is crawling inside my head making me want to hate you.  And as for your parents.  I remember killing them.  I remember wanting to kill you.  I’ve tortured and murdered.  And I’ve enjoyed it.  I know even with all of my soul I’m not a nice person.  Those two men you prevented killing me.  They know it to.  And they’re right not to forgive me.”
“It seems so” Malfoy shrugged.
“I want to see Lily”
“And she said she was bringing Teddy?”
“So any luck working out what the hell is this thing then?”
“He does?  He’s very different to the person written about in the press cuttings from back then, isn’t he?”
“He told me afterwards that it wasn’t that he was ashamed but that he’d rather tell people himself.”
“Why are we in the Cheltenham flat?  And why can’t I leave?”  Sirius snapped the second he saw them.
Harry almost felt overwhelmed with anticipation and fear.  True to his word Lucius dropped his appeal immediately and made the requisite requests.  The Minister had been over the moon when Harry reported back and enthusiastically agreed that Harry would be the one to accompany Draco to his Father’s execution.  The rest of the week had been spent in mad planning.  Ensuring the wards on Grimmauld were impenetrable.  Packing and shrinking what possessions remained; they could be collected as soon as it was deemed safe to get back here.  Grimmauld was too well known as a possibility for him hiding for them to use it as a safe house anymore.  Despite the fact it had been a home to him, Draco, and Blaise since the end of 5
For all Scorpius’ good intentions about talking to Al, he managed to procrastinate, continuously telling himself it wasn’t’ the right time.  Three weeks had passed since that first meet up in the library and his and Lily’s kisses had become a lot less chaste.  He and Lily had discussed telling Al, and both knew it had to be soon, before the gossip mill around Hogwarts caught on and Al found out from someone else.  Tonight, he and Lily were meeting up in a disused charms classroom.  Al was on Prefect duty with Rose, meaning that they should be able to spend a couple of hours undisturbed.  Sometimes the two of them sat and just talked for hours, other nights they sat and did their homework (he did have an enormous amount this year), but more often than not their meeting devolved into the two of them making out.  Neither of them had learnt locking charms, which was something he had kept meaning to rectify, yet hadn’t gotten around to, so there was always the slight anxiety that someone would open the door to whichever unused classroom they happened to have appropriated that week.  The charms classroom they were in had a huge pile of cushions in one corner.  The two of them organised them into a comfortable seating arrangement and proceeded to start on their homework, Scorpius reading an Arithmancy textbook, whilst Lily lead on her stomach copying a diagram of a unicorn and labelling it, her feet resting on Scorpius’s lap.  Scorpius’s hand was trailing up and down Lily’s foot and calf whilst he was reading.
“We need to work out where he is going to be.  I haven’t got a clue.  I just know he was caught after Pettigrew blew up a street and faked his death.”  Harry said, excitedly; words racing ahead of thoughts and tumbling out of his mouth.
“So he was under the invisibility cloak?”  Hermione voiced her suspicion and was surprised at Harry’s answer, although she suspected she shouldn’t have been if she’d thought about it properly.
“He’s the most famous baby in the world.”  Harry’s godfather admitted.
“Your Harry?”
“I don’t know what I’m doing.” Harry admitted.
“Blaise…” Draco tried to chastise, hoping but not expecting the idea to be dropped.
__________________
Draco looked up to see the waitress walking towards them with their order.  Before she reached them, he felt Harry tense up next to him, his hand almost painfully clenching Draco’s knee.  He anxiously turned back towards Harry, knowing that something was seriously wrong.
It didn’t go away though.  Another week passed and still no sign of her period.  She started avoiding spending time alone with Scorpius, not wanting to have to admit that she thought that she might be pregnant.  She hated being the cause of the hurt look in his eyes every time she made some feeble excuse about schoolwork, yet still unable to just confess what was wrong.  Hugo stuck with her like glue, despite the fact that it put pressure on his own relationship and his other friendships.  Lysander seemed very understanding that Hugo was spending all of his time with her, but it didn’t feel very fair that her disaster was making things difficult for the two of them.  The more time that passed the worse she felt until she didn’t feel like she could possibly feel ghastlier.  She wanted to push everyone away and wallow in self-pity.  Then the nausea started, and she felt as bad physically as she did emotionally.  She felt sick all day.  It was worse at mealtimes.  The second the food appeared on the tables before her the nausea became overwhelming.  Just the smell of food wafting up from the table and she was barely able to make it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  It was when that particular delight started that Hugo, again, began suggesting she go see Madame Pomfrey.  Not just to get the pregnancy confirmed but also because he was sure it wasn’t healthy not to be able to keep any food down.  Her weight was dropping and her uniform starting to hang off her.  She knew it wasn’t good for the baby, but at least the baggy clothes would hide any outward sign of her pregnancy.   Hugo also tried to talk to her about speaking to Scorpius.  She had felt so guilty when he told her that her boyfriend had tried to follow them out of the Great Hall a few times after she’d had to make a run for it.  Still, she was grateful he’d manage to keep Scorpius away from her when she was like this.  Lily was sure of it at this point, even without a test.  Still she could barely admit it to herself, let alone tell a grown up.  And the thought of telling Scorpius was worse.  The fear that he would want to leave her because of this whole disaster was eating her up.  Her grades were slipping; she looked and felt like shit.  Why the hell would he want to stay with someone who was just going to ruin his life like she’d manage to ruin her own.  Every doubt crowded her mind.  Every negative thought she’d ever had about herself weighed down on top of her.  It was all her fault her parents were getting a divorce and she was making her best friend and the boy she loved miserable.  She was a useless excuse for a person who shouldn’t be around anyone.  She’d even lashed out at Hugo a few times.  Telling him that she wasn’t worth his time or attention.  He hadn’t listened, yet she was sure in time that he would abandon her too.
“I’m still going to have to go to Italy to see my mother.  At least for part of the holiday.”  Blaise said.
“I think I’m going to be pushing it getting Draco out as it is.  But I know Draco and Blaise will want to see you again.  Instead of coming here afterwards, you could come back to ours.  That way Draco will be in his safe space.”
“Welcome to the Noble and most Ancient house of Black.  Toujours Pur and all of that bollocks.  This is my house.”
“You know that rule isn’t exactly enforceable in magical houses.”
A decade later and Harry hasn't been found.
“Use my floo Harry,” and Doris waved her wand, still in her hand from opening the window, at the fireplace lighting it.   “I’ll leave the slot open for you tomorrow at four.  Please try and make it if you can.  I hope Lily is okay.”
“I agree.” Draco responded quickly.  “Being here brings everything back, and the stress of the last couple of weeks isn’t helping either.”
Harry was feeling exasperated.  He was tired and this was a bizarre situation for all three of them.  He could do without the fighting.  “Siri.  Dumbledore knew from at least when I got my first Hogwarts letter that my home life was abusive.  It was addressed to the cupboard under the stairs.  I trusted him for a long time.  He was one of the first adults who didn’t treat me like I was something filthy they stepped in and was dirtying their shoes.  But even when I pleaded, he sent me back to the home where I wasn’t fed and was locked up.  Where being hit was something I expected.  I begged him not to send me back there and he still did.  When you died, he finally told me the prophesy about me and Voldemort.  He said he’d kept it from me to preserve my childhood.  The thing is, thanks to him, I never had a childhood.  There was nothing to preserve and if he’d just told me, you might not have died.  He may be a great man to you.  He was to me for a long time.  But then I grew up and realised that for all the good he might have done, he was still the man who forced me to go back to the Dursley’s year after year.  No blood protection was worth that.  Nothing was worth that.”
Sorry this is another short chapter.  I do have one more written at the moment and will hopefully upload it in a week.  I am planning to finish this, it's just taking me a while between work and life etc.
“And is there any reason that I have to use this house rather than being let into the Manor?  I want to see my son.”
There was a sound down the corridor and Harry looked up, expecting to Ron and Hermione, or maybe Molly.  Instead he saw Draco and Scorpius making their way towards them.
“As long as you’re telling the truth, Siri, I won’t tell Dumbledore.  I swear it.”
“Oh yeah.  That.  Probably should be more grateful to have that twat in our lives.”
“Draco.  Nothing bad is going to happen to me at work.  Besides, I thought you wanted me to go to work.”  Blaise said, looking pointedly over at Harry who proceeded to ease himself off the sofa with his sluggish limbs.
“Yeah, I think I’ve made some progress with all of them.”
Blaise could manage this.  It was going to take some interestingly large bribes and threats from their solicitors to keep it private, but he could manage.  “I’ll get it sorted.”
“Why…?  Why did he do it?”
“Decided?”
“I could see that.  Go on.  Off with you Harry.  Before one of your friends thinks to come looking.  I’ll be with Draco the whole time.  I won’t let go of him.  You know you can do this, and I’ll help him.”  Blaise said seriously.
“You can stay Harry.” A look of concern pouring from Draco’s eyes that he hadn’t seen for years.  That he’d thought he’d forgotten.  “What happened?”
“I can’t imagine why that would prompt you to visit.”
Harry’s back was to the front table, but he heard the commotion as someone got up and started to move towards them.
__________________
It was Sunday and he was due at the Burrow very soon.  “You sure you’re okay with me going to the Burrow?”  Harry asked again. Ever since he’d agreed to go, he’d found himself asking Draco the same question. This must have been at least the 20
That was the crux of the issue.  If anyone found out about his relationship with Draco, they would be vilified.  He’d be up before a misconduct committee and Draco would probably end up in prison.  His family would hate him.  He’d lose everything.  He’d lose Draco.  He sighed.  He had no bloody clue what to do next.
The family were all at the Burrow.  It was their regular Saturday morning brunch.  They were all sat in the garden enjoying the warm spring sunshine.  Hermione smiled looking at her daughter making daisy chains on the lawn with Ginny and felt a kick from the baby growing inside her.  She started to walk over to Rosie and Ginny, thinking she’d join them on the grass.  It was days like this when she felt happiest.  Something caught her eye before she reached the pair on the grass, and she looked up to see an owl flying towards them.  She stared as it dropped a large envelope at Ginny’s feet before landing in front of her with a small note attached to its leg.  Hermione took the note and the owl flew off immediately.  She opened the note and gasped at the familiar scrawl.  Tears started to well in her eyes as she read the short message over and over.
“Yeah well… can’t change anything now. Mostly I think I just need some sleep.”
“I had something I needed to do.”
“We will mother.  Right away.”
“I think I’m going to ask you about that one later, Harry.  Look, come on Blaise.  We had an idea about the link and you stabilising it.”
The three children nodded, and they all left the station.  Draco hailed a black cab from outside the station to take them to Charing Cross where they could walk to the Leaky Cauldron and floo straight to the Manor.
“She’s so fucking happy about his ‘great plan’ of hers and our dads.   None of them care about how I feel about all of this.”  He knew how selfish and immature he sounded saying this, but he couldn’t bring him self to give a damn,
“I’ll go let her in.” Blaise said.
“Sit down Lucius.  Draco, stop messing with your father.”  Harry said, smiling gently at his blond husband.
______________________
“Harry.”  It was Ron that answered, his voice flat and not bothering to clarify his statement in anyway.  Either not caring how his reply was likely to be interpreted, or simply unable to form his thoughts into an actual explanation of the morning’s events.
“I’m fine, love.  I need to do this.  Besides, you’ll be with me.”  Harry replied and kissed Draco lightly.
“Harry’s going overboard.  It wasn’t anything your average fourth year couldn’t have managed.” Draco grumbled.
“Then what is it?  Someone behave like a prejudiced twat?”
They were grinding into each other, lost in the pleasure of the moment. Then white happiness washed through Draco as he felt himself come.  He could sense that Harry was close too.  He reached his hand down between their legs and into Harry’s trousers.  It only took a few strokes before the warm, sticky wetness of Harry’s come was coating his hand and the inside of Harry’s underwear.
“They did.  I wasn’t really listening.  There’s a written copy with the meds I’m meant to be taking.  I left the bag at Grimmauld though.  Should probably pop back and get them.”
They stood there, both smiling, watching when Hattie noticed her mum enter the room.  She stretched out her arms toward Tabitha, clearly asking to be picked up.  Tabitha obliged and picked up the baby before swinging her around, then placing her on her hip.  She took the baby over to Scorpius and he seemed entranced by the infant.  Lily just stood there with her Dad and watched.  Angelina got up and walked over to the two of them.
“Neville, this place looks amazing!”
“I have to insist, Sir.”
“Well that…”
“Well that was a delightful evening.”  Draco said, lying back on the bed in the room they usually used when staying in the Manor.  It was very late.  They’d ended up cutting it slightly fine with their escape from Hogwarts, having spent more time than planned exploring the castle.
It was moments like this that reminded her exactly why she’d married Ron.  He’d proved time and time again since the war that he was on her side.  The knowledge made her more feel more confident about talking to him about this.  It didn’t help her know where to start, however.  There were three specific memories that Harry had given her that she either didn’t have any of her own memories of, or her memories differed in some way.  The flying, Diagon Alley, and the party.  With each of these she felt that from Harry’s point of view at least, she had let him down in some fundamental way.  She hadn’t noticed the length and extent of his depression; she had shown him why he couldn’t trust them about his relationship; and if it truly happened the way he described, the whole family had all committed a disgusting betrayal by not considering the implications of that night with Ginny, instead focusing entirely on their own desires.  She squeezed the hand in hers, drawing strength and comfort from her husband before finally turning to face him and starting on the difficult topic.
“I’ve brought some of Molly’s biscuits too.” She said, pouring him a cup and placing a thick piece of the homemade shortbread on the saucer.
“Even when you and your friends beat the crap out of me.”
“Harry, you’re back.”  Blaise said, concern all over his face as Harry walked into Draco’s room.
“Blaise…. It hurts…” Draco started whimpering less than two minutes after Professor Snape had blocked Draco’s view of Potter and gone to talk to him.
“Because we didn’t want to stay anywhere Dumbledore thought it likely someone could take baby Harry.  We don’t think it’s probable that he’ll notice for a while that Harry isn’t at the Dursleys, but we didn’t want to risk it.”  Harry answered calmly.
______________________
Harry, Draco and Sirius kidnap baby Harry from the Dursleys' doorstep.
“So no Dursleys.”
“Doesn’t mean you should smoke.”
“Won’t we increase the risk of being found if stop moving though?” Harry pondered and Draco wasn’t surprised that his partner had the opposite opinion on him on what was the riskiest course.  Harry had never had to hide in plain sight like Draco had.  The majority of Harry’s experiences of hiding came from his year on the run, constantly moving.
Harry gave James enough money for lunch and his school things then left with his younger two through the back of the pub, into the busy shopping centre of Wizarding London.
Harry spent the weekend reading some of the books Angelina had sent him in preparation for Monday and doing various household chores.  By the time Sunday evening came around Harry was bored again but looking forward to his venture into the world of looking after other people kids the next day.  He was sat in the sitting room, the fire blazing and a pot of tea close to hand when the fire flashed green, indicating someone was about to call, or come through.  Harry had assumed it would be Hermione to let him know what Ginny had said over lunch yesterday, but instead Lee Jordan’s face appeared in the flames.  Harry hadn’t known him well whilst they were at school.  Lee had been good friends with the twins, but they hadn’t really spoken much until Ginny started working with him.  He got on well enough with the other man but given the current circumstances he wasn’t sure why Lee had decided to turn up in his fireplace.
“Do you really want six months?  Surely a few weeks would suffice.”
“Yes, Draco.”
“Work.”  Harry stated.  He wished Blaise were here right now.  He missed his solid warm presence and hated himself a little for wanting it.  Blaise had known Harry would be out of sorts, it was why he’d wanted to take more time off work in the first place.  It was only Harry’s stubbornness that prevented him doing so.
Ron grumbled but went and grabbed a plate from the cupboard.
“I’m going to go order some drinks before I sit down and tell you exactly what’s on my mind.  What are you having?”  Pansy took charge.  Potter looked like a deer in the headlights, frozen but wanting to bolt with every fibre of his being.
“Not really.”
“I love you too, but it’s bedtime now.”  Draco replied, noticing the gleam in Harry’s eyes.  “And not that kind of bedtime.  It’s time to sleep.  I’m exhausted.”
“You have to insist what?”  A cross sounding women said from behind Harry and Draco.  The two of them turned and smiled at the person who had just arrived.  Draco was very pleased that it was Yara Clearwater who’d gotten his message.  She was one of the best solictors in the firm.
“Come on Grama, I did drawings on the floor.  Just like Burp.”
“So we break into Hogwarts.  I think me and Moony could manage that.”  Sirius stated.
“Mummy.  Come see what I did.” The child shouted excitedly, not seeming to care that she was in the middle of a public place.
“Then I’m coming too.”  Draco said firmly.
“That I’m a stubborn idiot.  I should never have let you leave.  I should have chased after you.  I had the opportunity back then and I missed it.  In these last few months, I’ve had more than one opportunity and I fucked it up all over again.  I keep getting lost in my own head.  No matter what Doris says I always manage to do it wrong.  I push away my friends.  I push you away.  I don’t want to push you away anymore.”
“Any chance you can get it?”
“I know.  But we can’t sleep yet.  We only have a few hours before we need to get back to Privet Drive.”
“I promise I won’t tell Hermione until you’re ready, but… Well I think I have a fair idea about who exactly you’re keeping a secret from us.”
“I’m sure I can keep Harry here entertained and not missing you too much.”  Blaise teased.  Draco rolled his eyes.  One of these day’s he was going to make Blaise regret teasing him by flirting with Harry.  For now though, it was enough that Blaise’s antics appeared to have brightened Harry’s mood.  He was at least smiling again.
The waiter left and came back to the table with a bottle of red, a jug of water and a bowl of olives, before leaving Draco and Doris to it.  The wine was good, but Draco looked nervously at the olives.  The reproachful look on his therapist’s face urged him to take one.  He sat there, picking little bits of it.  Eating them as slowly as possible.
“How do you know…?  We might be able to…”  Harry didn’t want to believe that some twist of fate had landed them here, but he was still unable to do something.  Change the course of his life from the misery he’d endured for years.  To stop himself from becoming the chosen one.  The child of the prophecy.
One of the red clad aurors stepped forward. “Mister Malfoy.  We are here with a warrant to search your property as well as place you under arrest for the kidnapping of one Harry James Potter by use of illegal potions and/or curses.”   They hadn’t even gotten his husbands name right, although that was probably to his advantage, but he decided not to press that particular point, as his solicitors were best placed to deal with that kind of technicality.
“Did you manage to stop her finding us?” Teddy said as he wrapped his arms around his Grandmother, showing how anxious he was about the whole mess.
His life changed.  Slowly but surely.  He saw Blaise, and sometimes his other friends, once a week, along with his therapist, in Tuscany and started to get his own semblance of self, back together.  There was still Potter though.  Even with his ever-increasing feelings of self-worth, he wasn’t able to stay away.  The day after his third therapy session, a particularly brutal one that had left him feeling dug out and hollow, he was the one who caved and messaged.  They had met at their favourite restaurant and after a decadent meal, had relaxed in the spa.  Seeing Potter fully dressed Draco had found him hard to resist.  The swimming trunks had been too much, and before he knew what was happening, they were booking a room in the attached hotel.  The sex was still just as breath taking.  Being around Harry, close to him in any way, just as intoxicating.  One slip was all it took for them to fall back into their old patterns.  Their relationship had changed though.  He didn’t know whether it was a conscious effort on his part, but he found he was become more distant whenever they were together.  The sharing of joys, jokes, pain, and regret petered out, and at the back of his mind a clock was counting down.  Harry’s wedding was approaching.  However much he wanted the man, he knew that when Potter was married, this thing that was happening between them would have to stop.  That eventually he’d be unable to cope with the deception and secrecy, or Harry would, and they wouldn’t be able to do this any longer.
“Blaise…  Make it stop…”
“Not a chance, old friend.  Harry’s mine.” Draco said possessively, pulling Harry into him and making Harry laugh again. “Besides, you know I’m the better catch.  I’m worth at least 10 times as much as you, am much prettier to look at, and unlike you, am not straight”
Hermione didn’t seem to notice the odd phrasing.  Hugging Harry one last time she left, the crack resonating on the front step as the air moved into the space she had disappeared.
“Not a clue as to what happened, but as for where we are…”  Harry looked around again at the familiar park. “I’m fairly certain we’re in Surrey, Little Whinging.”  Not that that made any sense, but Harry couldn’t imagine there would be two places that looked just like this.
“So you’ve felt…”  Potter looked scared and slightly ashamed.
“You’re my friend too.” This came out almost as a whisper.
Tom opened his eyes properly for a second time.  Something still felt off about calling himself that, although he was minding a little less each time these two said it.  He examined first the dark-haired boy with the scar running down his forehead through his right eyebrow and just touching his right cheek, then the blonde boy, who was more beautiful than any other person he’d seen.  Features full of aristocratic pride, yet with a softness of expression, which became even more evident when he glanced at the dark-haired boy.  Tom reached out to the scar on the dark-haired boys face.  Running one finger down it.  He was drawn to it.  Then he took the blonde boys left arm and pushed up the sleeve.  There was an ugly tattoo there.  Like with the scar he couldn’t help but trace the tattoo with his finger.  He knew both these marks were important.
“I get that Harry, but it’s a huge risk.”
“I’m the only person you see, other than the elves.”  It hadn’t taken Harry long to realise he was Malfoy’s only visitor.  He didn’t know who else would visit anyway.  Malfoy’s mother had escaped to France as soon as she’d been pardoned, and Lucius was in Azkaban.
“Harry, I want it to be okay too.  I’ll be here with him.”
“Oh thank god.” The boy sighs in relief and Hermione guesses that the guilt she thought she saw, was due to him thinking he’d just broken the statute of secrecy.  “I’m Teddy by the way. Please, why don’t you come inside and have a drink.  It’s hot out here, and my house may be pretty disgusting right now, but it has cold water and glasses.  I think there’s even still some whiskey stashed somewhere.  My gran would be appalled at me, not to mention Dray, if I didn’t at least try and make it up to you for making you almost faint.”
Harry woke up with a large dog half draped over him.  He still felt like shit, but it was a little more bearable.  There was still a constant tugging at his head and chest telling him he was in the wrong place.  It was also accompanied by the now familiar gnawing sensation, only about ten times worse than it had been at school.  Still, he managed to shuffle himself from underneath the Animagus. In doing so, however, he managed to accidentally shove Sirius unceremoniously off the bed.
“You’ll be there too.”  Blaise tried to reassure.
“I think you have a lot of explaining to do.”  Andromeda sighed, turning to Draco.
“Harry.”
It took over five minutes for the door of the room to open and Draco to walk in.  Harry’s legs were burning with the strain of staying half in the fire. “Draco, can I come through please?  I want to talk to you.”  It took an immense amount of effort for Harry not to let the pain show in his voice or expression.
“Still love me though.”
“Sleepy…”
“Well he’s not in the rest of the house, Herm.  But I can’t imagine why he’d go up there.  As far as I know it’s just an empty room now.  He stopped using it when Gin moved in.”
Harry had only taken two steps outside their front door when Blaise’s patronus found him.
“I wasn’t sure you’d come.”
“Neville… I forgot.  How did I forget?  We could have…”  He didn’t know how the fate of Neville’s parents had slipped his mind.  There had been a lot going on, with looking after Little Harry, and Sirius, and rescuing Narcissa and Little Draco, but Harry didn’t think any of it was a good enough excuse for not doing something to prevent the torture of Alice and Frank Longbottom.
“We told you….  There are two versions of me and Harry right now...”
“You can tell George if you like, just make sure he knows not to tell the rest of the family until I’m ready.”
“This looks great Dad” exclaimed James as he started piling his plate with breakfast.
“You know my Father’s gay, right?”
“As far as I’m aware.  He came over to scream at me about the whole thing, except I didn’t know until he told me.  I was more than a little shocked and collapsed at his feet like the pathetic idiot that I am.  He had to all but drag me to a chair. Then we talked, and he told me he still wanted me and then I told him to go away.  That all he did was hurt me.  I just can’t do this again, not when my son needs me”
None of them had spoken on the train ride from Manchester to London.  All of them were too on edge; waiting to be caught.  The most nerve-wracking part was getting the additional ticket in St Pancreas station, but somehow the whole thing went off without a hitch.  They were now all sitting in the first-class accommodation on the Eurostar, heading towards the Netherlands and the entrance to their safe house.  The journey there was a lot less awkward than it could have been.  Mostly because all three of them spent most of their time sleeping.  None of them had had a proper night’s rest in months.  Occasionally Lucius would look like he was going to ask them a question, then promptly closed his mouth again and remained silent.  Harry and Draco had had a few silent conversations through the bond, but both had avoided difficult topics.  Mostly they just sent the familiar feelings of love and affection back and forth.  Revelling in the open bond after two weeks of silence between them.  Their hands remained clasped together the whole way.  The train was a direct one and took just over six hours.  When they arrived in Amsterdam, Harry took the lead, his fingers entwined with Draco’s, who was at his side; Lucius followed close behind them.  Harry knew that Lucius wasn’t going to run off anywhere, so didn’t bother paying a huge amount of attention to the man.  Even if he had the energy to do so, where would he even go. After a short walk, Harry stopped outside a rundown looking house, between a coffee shop and a brothel, in a deserted back street in the red-light district.
“Parents are weird.  Want to play exploding snap?  I think I’ve had enough of the heavy topics for one day.”
“Like you would.” Harry snorted.  “And anyway you like it when I show you muggle things.  Your whole face lights up, even more than it used to when you received the abundance of sweets from you mother back at school.”
“So I’ve been told.” And told and told, Harry thought to himself.  It was one of the first truthful things he’d ever learnt about his parents – he didn’t count anything the Dursley’s had told him.  He looked like his father, but he had his mother’s eyes.  “Siri thought I was James when I found him.”
“It was your potion” Harry said it so quickly that he was unsure that Malfoy had heard him properly.  Before Malfoy could answer, the fire flashed green and Ginny stepped into the room.  She froze seeing the two men stood in front of the fire place, and Harry quickly let go of Malfoy’s wrist.
“Blood of the unwilling servant.  Willingly given.”
“Good. What should we do to the floor?”  Harry tried to keep his voice as gentle and even as possible.
This chapter has been retrospectively added in here.
“I’m fighting between trying to cause the least pain for myself and the most pleasure for others right now.   Every day I see Lily and can sense the baby grow, and her stomach get bigger, I feel more connected to the baby.  When I have my hand on her stomach, she kicks as I talk to her. But I know ultimately that keeping her will cause more pain than it will happiness.  My Father’s friend talked about both loving and resenting her daughter.  I don’t want my little girl to grow up with parents who regret what they couldn’t do just because they love her.  Then I look at my Father and Harry.  I can see nothing but joy and love when they talk about her.  They aren’t going to resent her.  Even if taking care of her is hard for them they will welcome every hardship.  I know that not calling her mine will hurt, but that pain will be less than the pain I will cause by trying to keep her.  My pain might be lessened slightly in the short term.  But my Father’s pain, Harry’s pain.  They will be increased exponentially.  I don’t think I can do that to them.”
The first two weeks after the kids had gone back to school were lonely ones for Harry.  Ginny was gone more and more, and Harry found the empty house oppressive.  He’d never noticed Ginny being absent this long whilst he was working.  Then again, previously he’d been gone for long stretches of the day too, relying on Mrs Weasley to act as a babysitter when they were both at work and the kids were home.  Sitting at home doing nothing did not suit him.  For the first few months he had the hospital and physio, followed by the summer and entertaining three teenagers and their host of friends.  Now there was nothing.  He needed a focus and he needed to fix his crumbling marriage.  He’d planned to talk to both Neville, and Ron and Hermione about Ginny, but hadn’t gotten around to either.  He also thought he might visit George in Diagon alley.  After his twin died, George had become morose and separated himself from his family, throwing himself into the joke shop he had started as a pair.  Harry had invested in the joke shop when it was still an idea in the twins’ head, and it had become a roaring success for them both during the war.  Harry remained a silent partner.  He wasn’t sure how much it brought into his account at Gringotts, but he was sure he had made his 1000 galleon investment back many times over through the years.  He enjoyed George’s company, and his wife Angelina’s.  She had been the one to pull George out of the blackness that surrounded him in those post war years.  Most people assumed that Harry had been fine after the war.  Those that knew better, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, all assumed it was one of the others that had pulled him up from the depression and drinking binges he’d used to escape his nightmares in that first year.  It had been none of them, but given no one asked or spoke about it, Harry had been able to keep his secret.  Harry hadn’t seen George or Angelina all summer as they had taken a trip to Australia.  George was probably the best of the Weasleys to go to about his Ginny problem, and maybe he would be able to help him get out of the slump in the rest of his life too. Although Harry still had no idea what he wanted to do with his life, at least now he knew what to do with his day. With his mind made up that he wouldn’t spend another day sat around moping by himself, he fire-called Ron and Hermione first.  It was a Saturday so neither of them were at work, and he found Hermione sat in the living room reading.
“So the Lestrange Vaults then?”  Harry asked, and Narcissa shrugged.
“I’m sure they’d love to join us.  Now, do you think you can be good for Blaise for a little bit longer, Teddy?  I need to go and visit someone I haven’t seen in a long time.”
“Fine you win.  Let’s go get one of these stupid bleepy things.”
“I…  I…  I know something is wrong in my head.  I know I’m being paranoid.  I just… I can’t take them.  They’re all wrong.”  Draco murmured into his shoulder, with more clarity than Harry had heard from him in days.
“Please.  Everyone wants to see you.”
“Harry, it’s not your fault.” Blaise murmured into his ear.
“I don’t mind so much now.  I was a prat too.”
“It’s not both of them, it’s just Draco.”
“Oh?”
“Harry.  Do you know how turned on I am right now?”
“Can I take you inside Draco?  Harry is cold and you are too. We need to be inside.”  Blaise said gently, though not risking touching Draco yet.
“No.” Harry exclaimed and pulled Draco tight into him as if he thought he was going to try and walk out again.  As if he could.  It had been hard enough before.  Draco knew he didn’t have it in him to do it this time.  Harry continued “We leave together.  We run.  I know you said it was a ridiculous idea.  That it was impossible.  I don’t care.  We’ve both got more money than we know what to do with.   We can use it to hide.  To see the world.  Whatever we want to do.  Together.”
‘No Harry.  You have to let them.  You can’t let them know your part.  They’ll just lock you up too.’
“They were in our classroom…” Alcohol was making it all too easy for Harry to confess everything to Malfoy and the conversation all too quickly had gone from light and amusing to bringing back every painful memory.  Tears had started to form in his eyes, so he closed them.  Trying to hide the fact that he was so close to breaking down.  This wasn’t how this evening was meant to go.  Then Harry felt a warm hand on top of his.  The slender fingers all too familiar.
“That was very wrong of him.  And them.  Little Harry is very lucky to have you.”
“Teddy’s always welcome.”  Ron replied.  Harry smiled in response then said his goodbyes and headed home.
“He was still your father.”
“That’s more consideration than I deserve. It also doesn’t really explain how I ended up at, what I presume, was your house with no clothes and about a day’s memory missing.”
“Malfoy has a kitten? Weird… I can’t picture it.”
Draco closed his eyes and tried to ignore the tearing at his chest.
“I can’t Harry.  He’s… I just can’t.  Not after Lily and James.”
Doris worked out the whole Harry/Draco thing at this point.  It was a little obvious when she heard the same stories from Draco as she'd been hearing from Harry over the last few months.  She can't say anything to either of them though due to confidentiality.  It doesn't mean she can't given them a nudge towards each other though.
“Are you going to be going back there now?”
“No, I know you’re good at potions.  I just doubted you’d give me something that actually made things better, not worse.”
“Oh…” Narcissa raised her eyebrows and then continued with ice in her voice. “And are you the reason I’m unable to enter?”
“It’s all about getting yourself into the right frame of mind with potion making.  No guess work on timings, heat level and stirring.  Concentration and counting.  There are some tricks to getting your head in the right space, and if you already understand the principals behind why a potion works, then that’s half the battle won”
“God I love you….”
“How?”
Despite the school nurse’s assurances, Harry thought Lily looked pretty dreadful.  She looked thinner than when he’d seen her at Christmas.  There were large bags under her eyes, which looked red from crying.  Harry didn’t know what to say now they were all together.  That he was disappointed.  That he’d wanted more for her. That he was scared out of his wits and had no idea what to do next.  Lily was clearly scared enough without him pouring his own insecurities and fears onto her.  The image of Hattie and Tabitha on that first day he saw them kept popping into his head.  Of a girl too young to be carrying the burden she was carrying.  His daughter wasn’t Tabitha though.  He and Ginny weren’t going to abandon her.  And he was fairly certain Malfoy wouldn’t let that son of his abandon Lily to leave her to deal with this by herself.  Scorpius wasn’t in the hospital wing.  McGonagall had told him that she’d sent Scorpius to his head of house and then back to the dorms for the night.  She did say she was impressed with the boy though.  The moment he’d found out he’d brought her straight to the hospital wing.  Despite the healer’s thoughts about this apparently favourable behaviour, Harry couldn’t bring himself to look favourably upon the Malfoy boy though.
“They’re the same… but… not.  Are you going to explain how this is possible now?”
The whisk of elf magic took Draco, Harry and Tom away.  The last thing Harry saw was the shocked looks of horror on both Sirius’ and Remus’ faces.  Then he collapsed into the blackness.  Tawly would keep them all safe until they’d recovered a little.  Then they would explain.  Then everything was going to be alright.
“You’re the best Harry.”  Ron said, clearly caring more about the cake than what Teddy meant by ‘cussin’.  “You told mum you bought desert yet.”
Harry’s mind resonated in sympathy.  If it were his mother in that situation, if she were still alive, he was sure he’d be half killing himself trying to save her too.  Even if it meant doing something that he would never do under any other circumstances.
“So you’ve desked yourself?”  Ron asked as soon as they were sat down in the canteen with their toasted sandwiches.
“So they’re okay?”  Sirius asked.  “They survived?  The paper doesn’t say.”  Given both boys reaction Sirius suspected not, but Harry saying he’d seen them sparked a little bit of hope.  Frank and Alice were both good people.  He didn’t know either of them well, they were a few years older than him.  But he’d met them a few times at Order Meetings, and they’d always been kind to him.  And their son was the same age as Harry. The war had orphaned enough children.  To have another lose their parents now, just didn’t seem fair.
Harry winced.  “Not really, once the kids were born, it sort of gradually ebbed away to special occasions only.”
Pansy and Draco were sat in an overpriced cocktail bar in Covent Garden, on their third brightly coloured and highly alcoholic beverages.  It had not quite been a month since he’d run out of Potter’s house.  He’d heard nothing in the papers, or from Scorpius about the Potter’s pending divorce.  They had probably worked it all out and gone back to their perfect looking marriage.  There was a photo of the female Weasley next to an article about females in sport last week, and he thought detected a small bump and seen her hand flicker to her stomach.  It would certainly explain why she had decided to go back to Harry if she were pregnant.  Their row and her leaving had probably just been hormonal or something.   He knew he shouldn’t care about this, but somehow, he had let himself hope that this time it could work out.
“That would be the one for pain.  Pain that must have been excruciating this morning, but you ignored.”  Draco chastised.  “They tend to do that.  And no you’re not stopping it.  I know you.”
“Your hair looks good by the way.”  Hermione commented.  “I wanted to say before, but you didn’t give me a much of a chance.”
“We’ll all help.”  Remus reassured.  “You don’t know why you travelled back here, nor why the things you’ve changed didn’t cause a disaster.  You probably didn’t remember because it was something you weren’t meant to change.”
Harry had to practically tear the little boy out of his arms he was clinging so tight.  He could obviously feel the tension in the room and was scared.  It didn’t help that his playmate had started crying too.  The door closed and Harry could hear the echoes of the baby’s cries pounding at his head and he swore he would never do anything that caused little Draco to make those noises again.  And Little Harry was so quiet now.  Draco had given him the potion to make him fall asleep whilst Harry had been fighting with little Draco.
Andromeda welcomed him warmly when he arrived.  He accepted her offer of tea and she went off to the kitchen to make it.  Teddy was lying on a playmat batting at the unicorn swinging over it.  Harry walked over to the 5-month-old and sat next to him.  Noticing Harry, Teddy stopped playing and stared.  Harry watched as his eyes turned green to match his own.  He picked up the baby and took him over to the sofa.  Sitting Teddy on his lap facing him, he played ‘This is the Way the Lady Rides’ over and over, delighting at the happy giggles from the baby.  When Andromeda came in with the tea, she suggested taking it into the garden.  He carried Teddy out and the three of them passed a pleasant morning until Teddy started grumbling and getting tired.  He handed the baby over to Andromeda so she could put him down for his nap.
Eventually pulling away Draco spoke.  “Harry, I don’t really know what to say.  I don’t know what Pansy told you, and I’m going to have to strangle the bitch for telling you anything, but I was a complete mess after that fight back in eighth year.  Well I was a mess before the fight, but that’s not really the point here.  Pansy, well she saved my life and I spent months stuck in a hospital, miserable and fantasising that you would come and take me away and rescue me.  It took me a long time to realise that the only way I could really be happy was to learn to live with myself and what I’d done.  I couldn’t rely on someone else to rescue me.  And as much as I loved you back then, more than anything I needed a saviour to rescue me.  The thing is now, however fucked up I am, with my barely controlled anxiety, I know that I can manage most things that are thrown at me.  The only shit I cannot manage is you coming in and out of my life it seems.  These last few months have shown me that magnificently.  I love you and therefore you are the person best placed to hurt me.  You’re a shit communicator and I’m not much better, but Doris has helped me see that.  I love you too, but I don’t know whether that’s enough yet, Harry.”
They were out celebrating.  It had been a month since they’d found themselves thrown into the past and neither of them had ever been happier.  It was just the two of them out, as none of the others had felt like it.  Narcissa felt drained after speaking at the trial.  Having to go over everything Lucius had done during the war, as well as her personal experiences of his temper was awful.   Especially with him sat there on the chair in the centre of the room glaring at her.  Just seeing him looking at her like that made her want to flinch and hide.  She’d had to think about the end result and how important it was for keeping Draco and little Draco safe from him.  That she was the only person that knew the information and facts that he couldn’t worm his way out from.  She’d burst into tears on Sirius’ shoulder when the verdict was read, and she was free from him.  All the years she’d been married she had never expected to ever escape, let alone have her rebellious cousin helping and supporting her.  When she arrived home it was to all of the warm support of the rest of the household.  She wished she had the energy to enjoy her first night of true freedom, but she didn’t.  Instead she crawled into bed, safe in the knowledge that she wouldn’t have to sleep with one ear open for her husband ever again.  Sirius and Remus had decided to stay home to look after the little ones and make sure that someone was there if Narcissa needed them.  Sirius had seen how frightened she was at the trial.  He was the only one of their little family that had been able to attend with her.  For the first time he really felt the importance of taking up his role as the Head of his House.  Most of the time he didn’t think about it, but it meant he could be there to support his Cousin.  Remus stayed because Sirius did.  He still wasn’t entirely comfortable around the older Harry and Draco.  It was getting easier for him, but it was slow going.  He loved both of them and felt protective about them.  That wasn’t going to change anytime soon.  The problem was that enough on some days it felt completely natural to have them around, on others he was hit over again with the realisation that they really shouldn’t be here and that the life he was now living was of a consequence of them meddling with something no one should ever meddle with.  Harry and Draco, however, felt elated and hadn’t wanted to stay in the house.  They wanted to go out and have fun.  They wanted to be irresponsible teenagers.  Harry wanted to go to the cinema, to his delight Raiders of the Lost Arc was playing – he’d always wanted to see it, but the film didn’t start playing till 9pm so they went and grabbed dinner first.
“And I was right about the Weaslette… and
“Okay,” Harry replied.  “It also might be an idea to talk to her about what is happening with the kids.  This is hardly the most sensible time for us to try and do this and I don’t want to put more strain on them than they’re already under.”
Harry ignored the disdain the elf was showing him.  Drinking with Malfoy probably wasn’t a good idea.  Drinking at all probably wasn’t a good idea.  But damn it.  The shock and stress of the day was enough of an exception for one drink.
“If that’s what you want.”  Blaise smiled, and went to sort out trays for them.
Harry sat up and pulled Draco with him into his lap.  He could guess why Draco was bringing this up today, but he hated that the man he loved ever felt insecure about their relationship in this way.  He kissed Draco passionately before he replied.  Needing to reassure him.
“Not so sure about that.”  Andromeda responded, taking a large sip of her drink.  Too many bad things had happened over her lifetime for her to be anything other than a realist about her own situation.
“I put Teddy down for his nap 20 minutes ago.”  Draco murmurs against his lips.
“Was that when he hit you?”
“I gather there was some kind of accident?  Do you need the Aurors to investigate?”
“Thanks, you’re looking particularly fetching today too.”  Harry replies with a grin.
“Yeah well, I really don’t give a damn.  You’re the one it bothers, so you sort it.  Whatever discomfort you manage to get into it’s not like it truly bothers me.”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry before he responded.  “I’m rebelling.  Didn’t you know?  It started by shacking up with you two.  What would people think?  Living in sin with two men.  The horror.”
“I don’t want you to be by yourself, Mother.” Narcissa still had several obvious bruises but was moving easier today.  It would take a few more days of potions before she was fully healed, but that would play in their favour today.  Looking every inch the battered wife would definitely help their case against Lucius.  Seeing her still like this made Draco feel very protective of his mother, however.
“It’s weird.  And aren’t you the one who was meant to be raised with proper manners?  Unlike our scruffy partner stood in front of you.”  Blaise retorted.
Blaise came over and gave Harry a kiss, then leant down and kissed the still sleeping Draco, just where frown lines crinkled his brow.  The blond was tense even in sleep.
“I guess I should go see her and apologise.  The kitten was rather time consuming and when she got near it, it really freaked out.” Harry said, trying not to sound sheepish given that Draco’s was exactly where he was.
Harry reaches his hand up to his hair and feels the rapidly drying paint. “Fuck.  I’ve gotta go.  I’ll see you tomorrow.” And with that Harry practically ran down the lawn out of the Manor, followed by the jubilant sound of Malfoy laughing.
“We ended up making out in the living room and being caught by one of the Weasley-in-laws.  I think she used to play chaser on the Gryffindor team.”
They walked in silence up to the office.  The entrance was clear, and they were able to go straight in.  Doris stopped briefly in the reception area to quickly talk to the receptionist before ushering him through into her room.
“I guess he doesn’t like you much.  Look how I got him is a bit of a long story, I’ll tell you about it later, but I think I need to feed it now.  Can you what you wanted to talk about wait?”
Potter managed to stand but the coordination needed for walking seemed beyond him.  Draco braced himself and put an arm around him and half carried, half dragged him to the closest guest room.  He put Potter into the bed.  Before he could let go of the man, Harry had managed to pull Draco towards him. They were so close.  Draco’s hand strayed to Harry’s face and their eyes met.  Draco had to force himself to pull away from that gaze.
“Wow, that’s...But you had no memory, and therefore I assume no real control over your Animagus form. That’s not really how it’s supposed to work”
“I’m due to meet her for lunch tomorrow.  I’ll talk to her then about this.  There is no way you can wait till Christmas to tell the kids.  It won’t be too many weeks before the papers start speculating about Potter baby number 4, and the kids will wonder why you didn’t write and let them know.  I’ll make sure she gets in contact with you by the end of next week and try to talk her round to talking to the kids before Halloween.  That should be before she starts showing too badly.”  Hermione was in full planning mode now.  “Come on Ron, we should go.” Ron finally seem to come out of his daze when Hermione spoke directly to him.
“This is the most inanely boring evening.  And pea soup.”
Nothing much happened through November.  All three of his kids wrote letters at least weekly.  They all seemed to be doing as well as could be hoped.  He and Ginny had given a brief joint statement to the prophet saying that they had separated the first week in November.  Ginny had taken all the blame in the story and had received several Howlers from the public.  Only their close friends and family had been told the whole truth.   Lee had also gotten some backlash from the public, but he, like Ginny, seemed to think it was the least they deserved.  Harry continued volunteering at the Centre, more often than not helping with the youngest age group.  He mostly stuck to mornings but had managed a couple of extra afternoons too, when the centre was short of volunteers.  He was growing quite attached to Hattie and Tabitha.  He had spoken to the young mum a few times now and she was becoming less nervous around him.  He wanted to come up with some way to help her.  Maybe find a way for her to continue with some N.E.W.Ts.  She’d mentioned one day that she had wanted to be a Healer before Hattie had come along.  She hoped that she’d still be able to work at St Mungo’s doing something in the future, even if she couldn’t be a healer without her qualifications.  Harry knew very little about working in healing or what was required for a career in that speciality.   His own experiences of the hospital were restricted to that of a patient.  He’d had more than his fair share of those though, and thought maybe he could talk to his physios about some of the other career options in medicine for wizards and what qualifications might be required for them.
“Okay.  I don’t want to see her tonight.”
“Harry…”
“I’ve just been busy I guess…” Draco knew that Doris would see straight through his attempts at avoiding talking about why he hadn’t wanted to see her but didn’t seem to be able to help himself from trying.
“I do want to see Moony….”
“You saved me.”
“Harry, let me help you.”  Sirius said.  Harry couldn’t find his voice to answer so nodded.  Sirius was quickly by his side, wrapping an arm around him to support him and help him up the stairs.
Harry started with telling Doris about his plans regarding volunteering, letting her know that he was going to be booking in his first session for the following Monday.  Although normally it took a week for the paperwork to get sorted, someone at the Ministry had spotted his name and had seemingly rushed the whole thing through.  He’d received the news with his morning owls and immediately wrote to Angelina, asking for his trial session as soon as possible.  Doris seemed pleased with this progress.  Moving on to the next topics was a little more difficult though.
“We know.  But we didn’t travel in time on purpose and once we were here Harry couldn’t not rescue little Harry.  And I wasn’t going to let mother suffer again under Father.  Once we’d decided to do that much it wasn’t too much of a stretch to decide to stop Sirius from being a reckless idiot and getting arrested.”  Sirius looked offended at Draco’s words, but then shrugged and accepted the mild insult.  It wasn’t like it wasn’t true.
“Well the most difficult ingredients, the ones that makes this almost impossible, we actually have.”
“I’m sorry Gin, you deserved better than me” Harry managed to get out, the tears finally stopping, but still unable to look up at her.
“For the same reason I never loose my wallet or keys when you can’t go a day without wondering round the house in frustration having misplaced your handbag.  It’s just how it is. I get this, you get to be able to read, absorb and understand the multitudes of books and facts that just go over my head.  I don’t get why Harry thought that was such a major event though, other than it probably being the only time Malfoy was ever spotted in a wizarding area after the war.  Unless Harry was already with the bastard.”
“I think so.”  Harry replied.  “It certainly looks like her Animagus.  And cats don’t normally sit that rigidly.  I didn’t know she knew about me being left like this.”  Draco reached and squeezed his hand.  It was comforting.  He thought he could trust his head of house, despite her not listening to him about the stone, or Umbridge, or various other things over the years.  She still seemed like a good woman.  Seeing her here and complicit with the abandonment of himself as a baby made him doubt that.  He didn’t really want to talk about it though.  The warm hand in his was enough for the time being.  After everything said between them over the last day, and the way they were working together to try and change things for both of them, he knew Draco would be there for him should he decide to discuss it later.  Non-judgemental and accepting of whatever Harry’s thoughts and feeling were about this revelation.
Lily looked around for somewhere to sit but there weren’t enough chairs.  Her Dad seemed to notice the problem too and looked towards Mr Malfoy.  Scorpius’s father sighed and rolled his eyes before taking out his wand and conjuring enough seats for them all to sit on.  The silent communication between the two of them unnerved Lily slightly.  She’d never seen the two of them behave like this together.  She was much more used to seeing disdain between the two of them, but this had looked like affection.  Lily clenched Scorpius’s hand.  He squeezed back and smiled down at her, but she could see he was nervous too.

“She says you can come up.”
“It’s been hard.  Number two stayed off work at home with number one whilst I was in the hospital.  It was pretty bad from what I’ve been told. And One had a nasty episode last week.”
Blaise sighed and then admitted, because he was too tired and stressed to think of anything else to say. “Because Draco can’t.”
“Mine.”  Draco’s voice was commanding.  His eyes may have been open now, but there was nothing behind them.  “He’s mine.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.”  Over and over again the words were repeated until Draco collapsed, exhausted into his arms.  Blaise sobbed.  He was confused. Nothing made sense.  All he knew was that Draco had been hurting beyond anything he’d ever seen before, and Harry wasn’t here.  Harry was the only one who could take the pain away.
“I need to feel.  Clothes stop me feeling.”
“What the hell is happening?  Theo go grab Professor Snape.  Draco….” It was the same voice.  Draco heard it quaver slightly on his name.   Draco felt like his head was splitting in two.  The pain had been nothing before this.  He wanted to vomit but just ended up dry heaving.
“That’s wonderful.”
“If you’re sure Harry.”
“I don’t’ know what to wear.”  Draco whined in distress.
Blaise lifted Harry and carried him the few short strides to the bed where Draco was lying. He was so pale.  His left arm was tightly bandaged, and he had tubes that appeared to have been inserted into several of his veins, with potions slowly dripping down into them.  He tucked Harry into Draco’s right side, then laced their fingers together and hooked Harry’s ankle around Draco’s.  Other than being on the wrong side of each other, it was how they slept most nights.  Blaise kissed them both lightly on the forehead.  He was satisfied when he saw Harry edge a little closer into Draco.
“Sure” Scorpius replied, not sure what 90s Brit Pop was but willing to give it a try.  He watched Lily shift over and move her feet off the bench.  Then, taking a deep breath, he moved to sit next to her.  She took one of the white things and put it one of his ears, brushing his face with her hand slightly as she did.  He quietly prayed to himself that Al’s prefect duties kept him really busy.  From the thing in his ear he could hear music playing.  It wasn’t something he recognised but he quite liked it.  The music distracted him for less than a minute before he felt her warm thigh press against his.  He tensed slightly then relaxed, not wanting to remove the gentle pressure.  He hoped his body wouldn’t give away his thoughts in a humiliating way.
Draco reacted to that by immediately pulling Harry in closer and whispering ‘mine’ over and over again into his hair possessively.
With Harry supporting Draco they made their way back into the study.  Once Harry got Draco onto the couch, he didn’t know what to do.  The way Draco looked brought back memories of when Draco’s anxiety had gotten the better of him all those years ago.  When he looked so fragile that all Harry wanted to do was wrap himself around him and protect him.  Harry just stood there at a loss whilst Draco sat silently, his fingers tracing where Harry knew scars lay on his arms even through the long sleeves of the robes.  Clearly lost in his own thoughts.  Thoughts that looked to be anything but pleasant.
“Yes.  When Rosie got her prefect badge I was surprised Ron didn’t announce it in the papers.  I can’t believe she’s entering her last year in September.”
“No.”  Harry admitted.  He’d been putting it off, telling himself that he would do it when they were home.  Now they were home, he still didn’t want to do it.
“What then?”  Harry said, shifting from behind Draco to next to him on the piano stool.
“There was… It’s not important.”
“That’s it.” Draco replied, unbale to keep the melancholy from his voice.  “We just go back to our separate lives and pretend that this didn’t happen.  Again.”
“Oh… Thanks I guess….”  There was along pause.  Draco could see Potter chewing the inside of his cheek, as if thinking very hard about something.  Something Draco fairly certain he didn’t want Potter to ask. “Hey, how did you know I didn’t use it?”
“I… I just…”
He couldn’t believe he was actually doing this.  But for some reason it was vitally important to Harry that his friend take some of Draco’s cake home.  He was knew Harry wasn’t exactly thinking straight.  He’d managed to get Harry laid down next to Draco again, still in the same blood-soaked clothes and had cut two large slices of the cake and conjured up a box to put them in.  He’d given Harry one last kiss before leaving the room and heading out of the ward.  He walked out of the doors and Blaise spotted the red-head he vaguely remembered from school sat opposite the entrance to the ward.  The red-head looked up as he exited.  When he saw it wasn’t Harry he looked back down again.  He clearly didn’t recognise Blaise from school.
“I did too.”  Harry whispered, remembering the wish for things to be different.
“Draco…”  Harry cracked the door slightly, peering in and hoping Draco wasn’t working on something that was likely to explode.  Harry immediately noticed he wasn’t actually working at all.  He was sat on the floor in one corner, and Harry was taken back years to the fragile Draco he remembered from the library.  He immediately swung the door open fully and went straight to sit next to his husband and wrap his arms around him.  It had been a stupid fight and he’d been even more stupid to storm out on Draco the way he’d done.  At least Draco was here and not in the library.  If he’d found Draco in the library in this state, he didn’t think he’d be able to forgive himself.  This whole thing was as hard on his husband as it was on him.
“To berate me for being an irresponsible child, and then tell me I’m having occlumency lessons with him on Dumbledore’s orders.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck.”  Harry replied and then took Draco from Blaise and held him close.  Peppering him in kisses.  Blaise could see Harry willing the limp form of Draco to wake up.  Blaise was surprised that Harry had taken the time to comfort him before trying to comfort Draco.  Blaise didn’t realise that he was just as important to Harry as the blonde.  That the bond may have tied Draco and Harry together in ways that made their relationship unique, but that didn’t always override the love he felt for others.  If it had, Harry would never have left the castle.  Would never have recklessly gone to the Ministry on his fool’s errand.  As far as Harry was concerned, Blaise was just as important.  What they didn’t understand though, that Harry’s comforting of Blaise first was another shift in the stability of the bond.  That they were coming closer to being able to use it, rather than just exist with it.  It had taken the loss of Sirius to achieve.  It was a high price to pay, but it was an inevitability.  From the moment they had cemented Blaise into their bond someone had to pay the price.  The bond was greedy and stole Sirius’ magic as he fell through the veil.  Neither Draco nor Harry would ever realise this was the cause of the increased strength they would discover in a few months.  This was one secret the bond kept from them, and always would.  They wouldn’t have been able to live with the guilt.
“I know, Blaise.  I’m doing something about it now.  I know I’m an idiot for letting it get that bad.  It shouldn’t have taken me nearly dying… but I am doing something about it.”
“I know I fucking don’t.”  Draco snapped.
“You were cheating on her, weren’t you?”
“Mother…  I’m not Father.”  Draco said, walking slowly towards the frightened woman.
The knock on the door made Harry jump.  He’d gone ahead to Grimmauld to wait for Andi and Teddy to arrive.  Draco was in a panic, and Blaise was dosing him up with calming draughts to get him into the floo.
“I guess not. Unless they knew about what happened back then, I don’t imagine they would have gotten why you decided to turn up on my doorstep, of all peoples, when your marriage fell apart”
“You would have made an abysmal snake Potter.  Anyway love.” Pansy continued, turning back to Draco.  “I’d best be off.  Leave you to two to it.  Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
“Tawly.”  Sirius called.  The elf appeared with a pop.  “Can you get a glass of firewhiskey for my friend. Cissa?”
“I’m not tired though.”  The iridescent lights flared brighter and the swirls started to become more violent and erratic in their movements.
“You know, the longer you’re able to stay in contact, the weirder this gets.  Also I don’t see how you two came to the conclusion I am somehow stabilising your weird bond.”  Blaise was sure he wasn’t important to this.  He just happened to be the one there when they desperately needed someone to stop them dying in the cold, and then to help them keep their secret.  Anyone could have done it.  Anyone would have done it.  The thing was, that wasn’t true.  Most people would have helped by taking them back to the hospital wing.  Wouldn’t have worked so hard to keep this a secret.  Would have tried to separate the two boys and that would have spelt disaster.  More importantly, no one else would have been able to make the two of them stop paying attention to each other to the exclusion of everything else.  Blaise was their co-conspirator in the essential task of keeping them together.  Even when he’d suggested research, there was no thought of looking for a way to break the bond, as most people would have suggested given the two boys history with each other and them being on opposite sides of the war.  The bond knew.  There was something else as well, something they’d only gotten hints at.  Blaise helped keep them together, but he also allowed them to come apart.  Allowed them to not get overtaken by the link entirely to the exclusion of all other needs.  They’d learn this eventually, but for the moment, Blaise felt unimportant.
“I am here Pansy.” Draco said, feeling a little miffed about being talked about like he wasn’t in the room.
“Snape explained the whole not possessed thing when he came to see me in the hospital wing.  Look can we go up to the dorm to talk about this, rather than doing it in the common room.”
“I don’t think it works that way Scorp.  You might be able to still do everything, but I won’t.”
“On the floor Teddy, that’s interesting.”  Andromeda replied, looking a little concerned.
“Not now.  After dinner, Teddy-Bear.”  Teddy stuck out his bottom lip, and Harry could just see the start of a tantrum.  He tried to head it off.  “We could do some colouring.  I brought your special crayons and picture book.”
As Draco was unable to sit up unsupported, Blaise grabbed the bedding off all of the other beds and created a soft support for his friend to lean against whilst his feet were soaking in the bowl.  He helped both of the boys into a comfortable position.  He then proceeded to them get undressed and into dry clothes, which they were unable to manage themselves.  This task was made much tricker by the fact that they would not let go of each other.  Undressing Harry, he noticed the Gryffindor boy was at least as thin Draco.  As if he also hadn’t eaten properly in a long time.  There were also several scars hiding under the clothes.  The sight of them made Blaise feel a little sick.  There was really only one explanation for the many identical small circular scars of healed burns on Potter’s back, and he wondered who the hell had done it to him.  He thought it best not to ask though.  He doubted if it would go down well if he started asking the boy, he barely knew, who had used him to stub out cigarettes on.  The scars at least looked old, which was something – although that implied that Potter was quite young when someone decided to do that to him.  Trying to distract himself from these dark thoughts, Blaise focused on periodically casting warming charms on the water Draco’s feet were bathing in, to increase the temperature incrementally and slowly.  He really needed to get some proper food for the two of them but didn’t want to leave them, and he didn’t even know where the kitchens were anyway.  Instead he rummaged amongst his unopened Christmas presents and dug out the box of chocolates his mother sent him every year.  It wasn’t exactly nutritious, but at least it had plenty of sugar.
“Grandkids maybe.  Although the thought of that makes me feel really old.  You just wait till yours have left Hogwarts.  It’s horrifying.  I’m just glad Teddy doesn’t seem to have found someone to settle down with quite yet.  I don’t think I’m ready for that particular turn of events.”
“Come here.  Let me show you how to do it properly then.”
“It’s not really fair on Ginny to keep things going like this though.  I don’t want to be with her.”
______________________________
“I’m really sorry.  We just didn’t know what else to do.”  Harry answered.
She looked at him curiously, he felt her eyes bore into him and he was reminded of Legilimency lessons with Aunt Bella.  The slam of memories almost made him throw up, but Draco managed to hold himself together.  He thought she may have noticed something off with him for a second but then she closed her eyes and sighed.  Clearly, she’d come to some sort of resolution.  To his relief the older woman took out her wand and cast a series of spells, familiar to Draco that prevented anyone over hearing them speak.  Then she held out her wand to face him and waited.  He took out his in turn and they made the oath.  It wasn’t quite an unbreakable vow, but it was similar.  What was spoken in this room would remain secret.
She let go of Scorpius’s hand and stood up.  Now it was her Dad’s chest she was crying into.
Their visits to England over the years had been pretty limited and since almost getting caught that first time, always under the strongest charms they had.  They occasionally did some ridiculous things in England, and occasionally Scotland, but never risked being discovered as them. Even if they were caught behaving like idiots in Diagon Alley or some other equally public venue, no one would ever discover it was them, and they had the best solicitors, money could buy that could have gotten them out of any trouble.  They had also made a mutual but undiscussed decision never to visit their old haunts.  This would be cathartic for both of them.
“Well I don’t care.”  Draco retorted a little too quickly.  Then he saw the hurt expression cross his friends face when he said this, and he immediately regretted it.  He changed his tone from the prickly one he’d been using in his annoyance at being caught.  When he spoke again it was with the soft, almost pleading tone.  “No, I’m sorry, I do care.  I just… Look I can’t talk about it.  It’s… when I know what the hell it is and manage to find some sort of solution, I’ll tell you.  But until then I just can’t okay.  And if you are truly my friend, you won’t push this.”
“But Neville… His Grandmother is pretty hard on him.  She puts all this pressure on him to be like his father.  We could have…”
“I will.  What are we going to do about this whole you feeling my pain thing though?  The chances are, even without getting more detentions from that bitch, I’m not going to be able to avoid getting hurt for the rest of the year.”
“Yes that’s right.  We both love you and we want you to wake up.”
“Andi?  What you are you doing here?”
“I wish there was more I could do to help.”
‘I’m getting you out of here.  I have your wand.  I’m going to unlock the cuffs and give it to you.  When I say, set off the strongest patronus you can conjure, and we’ll throw up a ward.  I’m going to unlock your father.  I can’t believe I’m actually about to do this.  Whatever you do, do not let go of me for a single second.  If we’re pulling this off, we need to share power.  Fuck I wish Blaise were here too.  It would make things so much bloody easier if there were the three of us.’
“Finished the ballroom.”  Draco said enthusiastically, like a child bringing home a picture to their parents, delighted with themselves and wanting everyone to see what they achieved.  This Draco, the bubbly, happy, enthusiastic Draco, was all it took to shake away the last of the bitter mood, Harry’s day at work and meeting at the Ministry, had left him with.
“I couldn’t Hermione.  Our friends understood why we were in hiding. Some of them helped to hide us in the first place.  In the beginning it was only Blaise and Cissa that knew where we were.  Eventually we invited Andi into the secret, and I got to know a few more of his friends.  It didn’t happen overnight, and they haven’t replaced you and Ron.  What we went through together is something no one else will ever know.  But not having to live with the memories of hiding from Voldemort was a relief.  And with them I didn’t feel guilty, like I do with you.  I didn’t have to live up to some image everyone had of me”
“No… we can’t… they’ll… just take us to the dorms or something.”  Draco pleaded, eyes wide with fear.
“I’ll have to quit.”
The therapy session went better than expected.  There had been no disdainful looks at the gate or as he walked through the village to the office.  It had actually been a relief to talk to someone about the disaster of his mind.  His therapist had also given him a regime of potions to take, to help with his sleep, anxiety, and general low mood.  He wasn’t so sure about them, but he wasn’t completely averse to trying.  He was due back in a week, and if he didn’t like what they did, he would just tell the man he wouldn’t take them.  Rather than heading straight back to the Manor, Draco decided to take a walk around the area.  It was a beautiful place.  It screamed wealth, but he was used that.  There was a park in the centre of the village and sat down on one of the benches, taking the time to admire his surroundings.  It was the first time in far too long, he didn’t feel threatened by witches and wizards who might notice him.  He wished he could just move here.  He supposed he could now.  He’d been given his freedom back.  If he wanted to live abroad and not deal with the turmoil and guilt being in England and the Manor brought, he didn’t have to.  The only things stopping him were his mother, and Potter.  And that was the problem really.  No matter what he said to Harry, he couldn’t escape the draw between the two of them.  He knew he’d go back to England and the next time Harry messaged him, as he no doubt would, he would run straight back into his arms.  Over the last year, his entire wellbeing had been dependant on the scruffy Gryffindor he’d foolishly fallen in love with.  That the idiot had fallen for him too only compounded his problems.  Maybe next week he would open up to man who’d agreed to try and help him through his issues, for a significant fee, about Harry.  Maybe if he did, he’d be able to escape the gravitational pull Potter had on him.
“Clearly have some weird magic tying us together.  This is why we want to try this.”  Draco said.  Then added softly.  “Do you think it would be okay if Harry tried touching you?”
Draco didn’t have the will or the energy to resist.  If he was being honest with himself, he wanted nothing more than to curl up in bed with Harry.
“I think so.  Actually I’m fairly certain they’ll be looking for me.”  Potter’s voice sounded slightly distressed at admitting this.  Guilt appearing to start eating at him.  Blaise felt distressed too.
Teddy made an enormous fuss over Harry and Draco trying to negotiate getting him into the buggy, so they abandoned the task.  The toddler decided that he wants Draco to carry him, and won’t take no for an answer.  The fight with Teddy to cover his hair with a hat was, however, successful.  They apparate out of the living room, Blaise with the buggy in his pocket and Harry side-alonging Draco and Teddy.  The apparition point is only a short walk from the play centre in Oxfordshire they selected for today’s outing.  Draco looks a little like he’s going to be sick on landing.  Harry almost offers to take Teddy off him, when he notices Draco holding the little one close, and Teddy softly petting Draco’s hair.  Having Teddy in his arms, seems to be helping Draco.  When they get to the centre itself Harry pays.  The woman behind the counter looks a little oddly at the three grown men with a toddler, but doesn’t say anything, to Harry and Blaise’s relief.  Teddy tries to tug his hat off, and pouts when he can’t.  It’s an adorable face, and significantly better than the tantrum Harry experienced with Teddy the first time he’d taken the boy somewhere muggle and he realised that Harry wouldn’t let him take the hat off.
“You’re not?”  Justin sounded surprised.
“Assume.  I’m fairly certain they think I’m seeing some girl and have just moved in with her.  You know I always keep the downstairs rooms at Grimmauld looking relatively lived in, but they must have gone upstairs and seen it was completely empty of any of my stuff.  Anyway.  Enough about me.  I want to know how you and Teddy are.  Has he said any new words yet?”
“Thanks.”
By the time Sirius and Remus had reached them, Harry had managed to compose himself again.
“Well thank him for me.  I’m sure me and Teddy will love them.”
“I’m sorry.” Draco said, softly, feeling a little ashamed, although wasn’t sure exactly why he admitting to feeling bad about the way he behaved towards Potter.
“Well I am a genius, what can I say.”  Draco said, smugly.
“It’s not your fault, love.” Harry stretched an arm out towards Draco.  Draco responded and reached his own arm towards Harry and clasped his hand.  They drew comfort from the simple touch, both thinking over everything that had led to this point.  Eventually Harry continued.  “I chose this.  I knew what running away would mean and I don’t regret it.  I don’t want to go back to that life.  I was miserable and none of them saw it.  None of them saw me.  I can’t pretend that there aren’t some things I miss though.  Like Teddy.  His Grandmother is looking after him.  I was meant to take him after his parents died but wasn’t ready at 18.  I was still a big part of his life and he mine until I left.  He was the only one who could make me really smile after I got married.   He reminded me of you. I don’t know whether you knew, but Teddy is your second cousin or something.  It’s your mother’s sister looking after him.”
Out of everyone, Ron was the most invested in Harry and Ginny’s relationship.  Even more than Ginny, and her radiant joy was obvious to all around her.  Ron’s enthusiasm couldn’t be matched, however.  He was going to be Harry’s brother, truly and properly, and his ecstatic satisfaction should have been infectious.  It would have been infectious had the dread of what he was doing not be stamping all over him.  Had he not been completely and irrevocably in love with someone else.  Someone who he’d have to tear apart all of the strings that tied him to the family he’d created to be with.  The Weasleys didn’t deserve that.  They’d taken in the child who’d couldn’t remember what love felt like and welcomed him into their home.  He was finally going to complete the bonds that tied them.  He was determined.  He thought he was determined.  Each day that ticked away ate at him.  His phone burned in his pocket, calling at him to contact Draco.  To try one last time untangle the mess he’d made of everything.
“We’ve got our ninth anniversary coming up in the Autumn.  You don’t know how grateful I am for you whisking Draco away from his marriage contract to Tori.”
“I guess I don’t.” The intrigue in Malfoy’s voice was becoming more dominant.  Harry thought this was probably the longest, least antagonistic conversation the two of them had ever managed.  Pondering on the potion and its effects Harry suddenly had a thought of how they could test whether a kitten was really Malfoy’s Animagus form, or whether it was just a weird effect of the potion.
Lily had out her potions textbooks and had started working on her latest homework assignment when Scorpius arrived.  She didn’t see him at first, concentrating hard on her essay on general antidotes to poisons.
Something about that sentence didn’t sit right with Draco.  Why would Potter’s relations have prepared him for pain?  Before Draco could form his thoughts into some kind of coherent question, Potter spoke again.
“Why does Draco get to sleep in?”  Harry grumbled.
“My Godfather lives in London, so it’s closer to St Mungo’s.  There are also a fair number of protective wards over the place so it’s a relatively safe place for me to be.”
“They still had sex with him the night before he did though.  And the bitch only managed 6 months before she contacted him again.”
“I love you too, my Harry.”
“They are kids Malfoy” Al’s dad replied.   Scorpius noticed again that his father seemed to be avoiding looking into Al’s dad’s eyes and had said nothing in reply.
“Yeah, really sorry.” Lee visibly cringed as he replied and seemed unsure of what else to say again, so Harry put him out of his misery.
“Who the fuck did this to you?” Draco couldn’t keep the concern out of his voice.
“Blaise…”  Harry appealed.  “You should go back to work.  Like I told you this morning, Draco and I will be fine.  We’ve got this.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I guess not.  But dealing with a bit of law breaking and a murderous lunatic seems a hell of a lot easier than this.”
“Yes, they’re fine.”
“I know.  I just want to sit down for a bit.  Leg’s hurting.”
“No.  I… I want to be placed on exclusive desk duty for at least the next six months.”  The words came out in a rush.  Robards just looked at him stunned.  Speechless at Harry’s request.
“I’m okay, Draco.”
“No Hermione,” Harry said, feeling a little drunk.  “I think we should sit here and drink until it’s time for George to set off the fireworks.  Let the kids be kids.  What’s the worst that can happen?”
Harry focussed back on Draco, running his fingers through the fine blond hair.  Glad that Draco was asleep and not hearing this conversation.
“Sorry for interrupting.  I didn’t realise Harry wasn’t alone.  George is about to set off the first fireworks.  Do you need a few minutes?” Angelina’s eyes darted down to the very obvious bulge in Draco’s trousers.  Harry’s own erection was only not visible to her by the virtue of him being sat down, with the arm of the chair blocking her view of that area.
floor of the building.  Getting into her offices without being seen was in interesting affair, but at least his stick didn’t stand out with the number of people visiting the host of hospitals squashed into this small area of central London.  It took him 10 minutes of waiting around on the upstairs corridor before it was free of muggles heading to the various departments they used in this centre.  Walking straight through the barrier he entered a bright reception area.  He didn’t recognise the receptionist, and there were a few additional certificates on the wall, but other than that this room hadn’t changed.  Before Harry could even announce himself to the receptionist, Doris floated out of her room and greeted him.
Draco walked slowly towards his mother, who was stood next to the wooden cross at the head of the grave.  The marker that would stand in place until the headstone was completed and installed there.  Andromeda was stood near her but moved away towards Blaise and Harry when she noticed him approaching.
“Can we talk it over with Tara together?”
“Yeah…  I’m sorry for… I know better now, but you were a right git to me up until extremely recently.  You stomped on my face and broke my nose 8 months ago.”
“Okay.”
Harry looked conspiratorially at Victoria and then snorted.  “You’re gonna have to be a bit more specific.  Here’s the tea menu.  They’re all good.”
“Fuck…”
“I’m such a fucking mess.”
“Are you okay?”  Harry didn’t like the implications of Andi needing to see a healer.
There was a pregnant pause.
“Don’t worry about it.” He dismissed the elf before he could finish and ran through the corridors to the blue room.  It was the latest room to have undergone a makeover.  As he approached, he heard crashes and splintering wood.  He could hear Draco shouting, but couldn’t make out what he was saying.  He opened the door cautiously.
“Thanks Molly.  I don’t know what we’d do without you.”
“I know love.  I know.  It will be better soon. He’ll be here with us soon.”
“Well to start with you can scoot next to Harry and have a very large drink.  It’ll make this less weird.”
“Hawwy…” The toddler interrupted before Andi could answer.  She quickly passed the baby over who started trying to alternately grab at Harry’s coffee and poke his fingers in Harry’s mouth.  Harry broke a piece of shortbread off the biscuit he’d bought to go with his coffee and handed it to Teddy to distract him whilst he spoke to Andi.
“I love you.”  Harry tried to soothe.  Draco wasn’t buying it.
“Very well, Mister Harry Potter, Sir.” And with one last glare towards Draco, the house elf disapparated.
They moved rapidly through the house, Malfoy leading the way, their hands entwined.  When the stepped into the fresh air Harry breathed a sigh of relief.  Running through the house like that didn’t exactly bring up great memories for him either.
Her Dad came to pick the two of them up from platform 9 ¾ alone.  The rest of the school wouldn’t be out until the next day, but Lily and Scorpius had been allowed out a day early.  They had caught the regular train that some witches and wizards used to travel between Hogsmeade and London.  Lily wasn’t sure what she expected from this meeting.  She and Scorpius had used the long train journey to talk at length about what Pansy had said to them.  She thought she was leaning towards getting rid of the baby and she was pretty Scorpius was leaning that way too.  One thing she had learned through all of this though was that Scorpius was going to be a wonderful man someday.  She just hoped that the two of them could make it through together so she could experience it.  That one day when she told him she was pregnant that he’d be overjoyed, instead of filled with dread.  Their relationship was still holding strong for the moment though.  From her conversations with Rose, she knew that most people in their situation, didn’t manage to stay together.
“Just…. I can feel them at the edge of the wards.  Make them go away.”
The blonde answers this time.  “One I think you’ll like rather a lot.  We’d very much like to have a few days to prepare for this particular story to break.  So we are going to agree to answer three questions in exchange for three days delay.  We think it’s very generous.  It’s certainly a bigger break than a journalist barely out of school could ever expect.”
Draco disapparates from the room, straight to the Manor, unable to look at Harry any longer.  Unable to see the hurt in his eyes.  He heads straight to the Floo that will take him to Blaise.  They’d worked out how to set up a new connection undetectably a few weeks ago.  He can now go to Blaise’s directly, without the fuss of having to go via the Alps and through the gates that bar entrance, for the majority, to the village.
Draco started screaming.  It was a completely unearthly scream.  Even worse that the scream he’d let out that night before Christmas.  Before Blaise had known about any of this.  Before he knew Harry.  Before he’d let the scruffy dark-haired Gryffindor into his heart.  He thought he was going to break.  He knew in his heart that scream meant Harry was gone.  Then Draco’s eyes flew open and his tone changed completely.
“Promise.” Justin was too intrigued to say no.  He’d never had someone let him in on a secret.
“What are you thinking about Scorp?” Al asked, grinning.  Clearly the expression on his face was giving away something his friend found amusing.
“Exactly.”
Flitwick hurried away, and reluctantly the five of them entered the Great Hall.  No one noticed at first as they started making their way to the table where Teddy Lupin’s party had been given seats.   It was unfortunately close to the front.  As they walked between the tables, people stopped talking as they recognised the late comers, and then started whispering furiously.   Harry made a point not to look at anyone, determinately moving forward with Draco’s hand clutched tightly in his.   Thankfully, when they reached the table, there were six empty seats, with only a couple, Harry didn’t recognise, sitting there.  The five of them sat down, ignoring the place cards, and arranging themselves how they wanted to.  Harry was next to Draco, their hands still linked together.  The couple on the table were staring open mouthed at them.  It seemed to be the default reaction.
“Okay then, we won’t dwell on it for now.  Come on, show me Harry’s potion regime.”
A damp flannel dabbed at the sweat on his face.
“Yes.” Hermione placed her hands on her hips and glared at Ron crossly.  She definitely knew the answer and it more than likely involved her husband having too big a mouth on him when he was two pints in.
“Mister Potter.   We is having tea ready for you in the conservatory.”
This is the final chapter of part one of this, and mostly containers teasers for the rest of the story.  I do have a few chapters of the next installment written but they need some significant work doing on them before I start posting.
The two of the all but raced out of the room into the hallway and upstairs, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts again.  Teenagers may be a nightmare on occasion, but he wouldn’t swap any of his three for the world.  He got up and went to the fridge to grab a beer.   Just as he was pulling the door open there was a sound behind Harry, and he turned back towards the door from the kitchen to the hallway.  Rather than Lily or Scorpius, who as far as he was aware were the only ones not outside, Harry was shocked to see Draco Malfoy stood there.  Harry hadn’t seen him since that night when he’d turned up at the house in Oxfordshire.  Somehow, he looked better than Harry remembered, although a little on the thin side.  The suit he was wearing was perfectly tailored.  His hair still as strikingly blonde.  His eyes still that enticing shade of silver-grey.
“You go get Cissa and Andi up.  I’ll try and reign him.  And make you a really large cup of coffee.”  Harry said.  Draco kissed him lightly on the cheek in thanks, before going to go get his mother and aunt.
“Of course not.  I’ll stay here and make sure Tabitha’s okay.”
“Always.”
“Not at all.”  Harry half laughed.  “I can’t promise they’ll agree to meet you.  But… this week has…”  Harry paused trying to find the right words. “Let’s just say I want some things to change. I even quit my job.”
Draco picked at his food.  There were only a few other people in here at this time.  He barely noticed the tables around him beginning to fill.  It wasn’t until Potter entered the room that he was able to haul himself out of his introspection.  He didn’t know how he knew it, but somehow the second Potter entered, he knew the other boy was there.  Glancing at him, he thought Potter looked almost as bad as he felt.  Dark circles cut deep under his eyes, and he looked like he hadn’t even bothered to get changed out of last night’s robes with the number of crinkles in them.   Classes dragged more than they ever had before that day, and he wasn’t sure how he managed to stay awake through them.  If he’d had history or magic or defence, he definitely wouldn’t have managed it.  Still, come 9pm, rather than crawling into bed as he wanted to, he left the common room to wait for Potter.
“What do you want Hermione?  I’ll order while you find a table.”
“Why do you think you idiot?  I couldn’t face seeing what they were saying about you in there.  It was even worse the day of your escape.  I was desperate to look to see if it had succeeded, but too bloody scared in case it had failed, and I lost the both of you.”
“And little Harry won’t automatically distrust all Slytherins just because of their house.  He won’t be begging the sorting hat to send him anywhere else.  He will know better than I did.”

It was Hermione that answered.  “No…well he did go retrieve one of the things we were looking for by himself from Gringotts.  But he wasn’t quite alone, he took a Goblin who we rescued from the Malfoy’s house with him and who helped him break in, in exchange for the sword of Gryffindor.”
“If you’re sure.”
“After all these weeks he came begging for you back.  The arrogant bastard.”
“That sounds lovely.  And I believe I will be busy for most of the evening anyway.  I will see you soon.”
“Always.”
“No.”
“Oh, okay then” Ginny seemed to buy the tale a little too easily, but Harry wasn’t going to argue.  “Are you going to invite me in properly?” the hint of flirtation in her voice obvious to Harry.  Seeing her look him up and down, he suddenly realised that he was only wearing his pyjama bottoms.
“Fuck…”
Her Dad chuckled.  This was so weird.
“Not my fault.  It was a stag before.”
“I’m sorry to hear that.  You would have made an excellent teacher.  I understand though.  It must be tough on your family to have such rubbish printed in the paper, particularly with what you’re all dealing with, with Scorpius and Lily.  I can see what you wouldn’t want to aggravate the gossip and upset them further by being here as a reminder to the other students”
“Harry, you’re okay.”  Hermione said, as he stepped into their main room and running forward.  Before she could envelop him in a hug, Harry stopped her.
“Sure, Scorp.  We’re coming,” Lily said and turned to pull herself up out of hot tub. She looked back over at Scorpius once she’d eased her way out of the water.  His eyes were fixed on her.  When he noticed she was watching him he blushed, looked away, and quickly rushed into the changing room.
“Dad.  I don’t know what to say.” Lily replied.
Lily thought Angelina would make a great mum.  She seemed to know exactly what to say to her.  It was then she remembered why Angelina didn’t have kids and it made her sad.  Here she was with a baby she wanted to get rid of, yet all over the world there were unable to have what she didn’t want.  She wasn’t going to keep this baby; she knew that now.   But hearing the longing in Angelina’s voice made her know that she couldn’t be so selfish as to take the potion and stop this baby from existing.  She knew it wouldn’t be easy.  Tabitha and Hattie were proof of that.  Tabitha hadn’t been able to take the final step.  But Tabitha was alone, and she had a whole family to support her.  And maybe, if there was an Angelina out there to love her baby, she could be strong enough to do what Tabitha couldn’t.

“Why not?”
They arrived at the school and he exited the carriage.  He offered his hand to Ginny to help her down.  She did look beautiful tonight.  She was in a silver dress with royal blue trimming, perfectly complementing her complexion.  Her long red hair had been professionally styled, and effortlessly curled across her shoulders and down her back.  She was the perfect date to have on his arm.  He looked over at Ron, who was now helping Hermione out of the carriage.  He wished he could feel half the enraptured love that he saw in his best friend’s eyes as he looked Hermione.  If it were Draco here tonight, maybe he would, but instead it was Ginny.  The person everyone expected him to be with. The Great Hall was decked out spectacularly.  It was unrecognisable from the last time he’d been in there.  Witches, wizards, creatures, beings, and everything in between filled the room.  There was no sign of the four house tables, that signified the separation, and rivalry, that was drilled into the eleven-year olds when they were first sorted.  Round tables were scattered around the edges of the room, leaving the centre open as a dance floor.  The teachers table was still there on the dais though, and Harry knew his seat would be there.  Where everyone could look up and stare at him.  The table plan confirmed his suspicions.  Ginny, Hermione, and Ron were up their too as well as the dozen or so other people deigned important enough for the honour of the head table.  He took Ginny’s hand and led her up to their seats.  Even if he couldn’t feel it, he could outwardly portray that he was the perfect boyfriend.
“Me and Hannah weren’t suited.  We jumped into a marriage straight after the war, just like many others; trying to get through the grief of losing so many people.  You might have also noticed Hannah was trying to hide something from not only the world, but also herself.  She thought that if she got married to a guy who she liked and was friends with, she would fall in love with him.  It didn’t work like that, and I believe she’s infinitely happier with Daphne than me.  And I have my plants, my pupils and the other teachers”
“He stopped being the father I loved sometime around 4
“Hey.  It’s not silly.”  Justin said, feeling incredibly privileged to be let in on this highly personal piece of information.  No one had ever shared anything like this with him before.  Not even his sister, who he loved more than anything, and was the only person who really understood him.  Instinctively he reached across the table and placed his hand on top of Teddy’s.  It was so strange for him.  He never touched anyone he wasn’t completely familiar with, but there was just something about Teddy.  “I may not have any experiences like that but it’s not silly to want to feel connected to them.  I could see how they felt about you, even from only seeing you together for ten minutes.  I know your birth parents….” Justin trailed off, knowing that this was probably not a particularly pleasant subject for Teddy to think about and wishing he hadn’t brought it up.
“I will do whatever is within my power to ensure that she lives a free and happy life.”  Harry held his breath and waited.
“Harry spent the year telling us Malfoy was up to something, not that we believed him at the time, even if he was right about him being a filthy Death Eater.”  Ron voiced her thoughts for her.
“Hello, Dobby.  Is there any chance you can tell us where Mother is?”  Draco replied to the little excitable elf.
.  The day we came back here.”
“What the fuck am I looking for?”
“Your allowed to worry about him.  Just think, it won’t be long, and you’ll see him again.”
“So, Potter and the Weaslette are getting a divorce.” A nod from Draco.
“I need to insist that you don’t ask me.  I’m… I don’t feel like I’m going to be ready to go into the field for a while.  I’ve been seeing a mind healer.  She doesn’t want me going anywhere near danger until she signs me off.”
“Do you think…” Harry started in a quiet whisper.  A horrible thought was creeping up on him.
“No.  I’m staying with someone else.  The healers said it would be better if I had someone around.”
“I’ve ruined everything.”
Tom wanted to say yes.  Wanted desperately to say yes so that these two boys who had no right to be kind to him would just put him out of his misery.  But he couldn’t lie to them.  They knew the truth.  They had seen every awful memory of his, as he had seen the worst of theirs.
“Harry… make them stop.”  Draco begged.
The cold voice echoed in his head and Tom retched again.
The silence felt heavy.
“I think you’d be coping better if you had your mum there to help you too.”
“About father.”
“I’m trying…”  Sirius sounded nearly in tears himself.
“Prat.”  Harry said, chucking a half-eaten bread roll at Blaise’s head.  Blaise retaliated with an olive.  Draco rolled his eyes and ignored the two of them, although he did move the bottle of wine away from both of their reaches.  Food fights were not an uncommon occurrence, even when they were out for dinner.  The two of them enjoyed them far too much, even though they were in their 30s now and supposed to be grownups.  This was how their friendship worked.  The pattern having established itself right from the first day.
“Mew” the Malfoy kitten replied.
year in the DA.  They could try and make sure of that at least.
“Sorry, Blaise.”  Draco and Harry said in unison.  Harry reached out to pull Blaise into a kiss, although he kept his hand around Draco’s waist.
“If you need to write to her first you can.”
Blaise had to physically tilt Draco’s head up so he could look at their head of house.
“Well until last week I didn’t look it.”  Hermione huffed.  Harry looked over to Ron, pleading for help for the right thing to say.  Ron opened his eyes wide and shook his head slightly.  Harry took it as a sign just to back off and not mention it.  It seemed Ron had already put his foot in it at some point about the expanding stomach of his partner.
Draco sat at the breakfast bar and watched Kreacher busy himself at making breakfast.  A cup of hot coffee was placed in front of him and he savoured the bitter taste.  When Kreacher was done he put everything on a tray.  Draco dismissed Kreacher then, telling him that he would take the breakfast up to Harry.
“Lily, I’m sure Scorpius has told you I’m not exactly one for subtleties when it comes to this type of situation.  Other situations sure.  But not ones like this.  I know your pregnant and are probably petrified out of your mind.  I know I was, and I was a few years older than you when it happened to me.”
“Well, I’m sure it will get better once you’ve finished your training and actually get to do the job properly.  You always wanted to be an Auror and you’ll be amazing at it.  You were made to catch Dark Wizards.”  Ginny leaned in close as she said this and put one hand on his knee.  He wanted to tell her to stop touching him.  To not tell him what his life was meant to be.  He couldn’t bring himself to.  The same way he couldn’t bring himself to tell her he didn’t want to get back together.  He knew he shouldn’t be stringing her along but didn’t want to make her and the whole family unhappy if he told the truth.  They were all already unhappy enough after losing Fred.  Maybe in a few months it would be better.  Maybe she would notice that he just didn’t like her like that anymore.  It wasn’t like they’d officially gotten back together.  It was just that everyone assumed they would.  So he let her continue to flirt as he picked at his food. Even though he’d skipped breakfast, and all he’d had to eat so far today was a few bites of biscuit, that Teddy had mostly stolen and drooled over, he wasn’t hungry.  The problem was, he didn’t want to be here at all.  It made him sad.  But what made him worse was that none of these people, who were meant to be his closest friends and family, even noticed.
“Okay, let’s try this.” Malfoy moved his wand in a complicated pattern and wallpaper started peeling off the wall, exposing the smooth plaster underneath.  Whatever Malfoy had done went completely over Harry’s head.  He didn’t think he could copy the motion, let alone cast if wordlessly with just one demonstration.
Draco looked appalled at the suggestion.  Harry stared at him wide eyed and pleading.  He needed Draco to do this.  Eventually Draco nodded.  Harry and Draco handed their wands over and Sirius stood there watching with narrowed eyes, as if expecting this all to be a trick, or an elaborate joke.  Harry didn’t blame him.  If he were in Sirius’ position, he wouldn’t have trusted them either.
“Blaise it was awful.  I was awful.  I should have refused.”  Draco managed to croak out.  “I don’t deserve you here trying to comfort me.  You should go find him.  He deserves you more.”  Draco’s thoughts felt disjointed.  “The look he gave me when he saw me next to Pansy.  I don’t think he knew which one of us sent the trip jinx.  But it wasn’t me.  I promise it wasn’t me.  Everything is starting to hurt.”  It felt like someone was squeezing something in his chest with bruising force and he felt himself starting to panic.  “What if they expel him?  He can’t leave the school.  I need him…”
The three of them got in the bath and Harry basked in the love and attention his two companions gave him.  The room produced a chilled and delicious bottle of white wine, which they shared. The room didn’t care that they were underage, nor that it was a school night.  It could tell they needed to relax.  It always took the bottles away when it decided they’d had enough anyway. Draco washed his hair with loving attention whilst Harry sat on his lap.  Blaise massaged the tension out of the muscles in his back and shoulders.  His scar tingled but as he felt more and more relaxed the less it did.  Maybe this was the key to occlumency.  Clearing his mind had never been easier than when he had Draco and Blaise helping him.  They eventually managed to drag themselves out, and Harry felt insanely jealous when Draco and Blaise got into their pyjamas, whilst he had to put his school robes back on once he’d dried.  All things willing he’d be back with them in half an hour.  It was in fact an hour before he was able to get back, after the interrogation he got about the lesson from Ron and Hermione in the common room.  He had never been more grateful for the ward around his bed when he snuck out just after his dorm-mates got into bed.  When he got to the room, he dragged Blaise and Draco into their bed and they spent a fruitful hour undoing all of the stress the hour apart had caused Harry, with tongues and hands exploring pleasurably, before all crashing asleep feeling sated.
“Not really.  She’s… well, she’s gotten herself into rather huge mess if I’m being honest.  But we’ll get through it.  She has a family that loves her and will support her.” Harry felt so light-hearted even talking about Lily wasn’t enough to bring him down.
“I think I missed me too.  Now you were thinking about something, and I’m sure it wasn’t our dearest and most delightful relatives.”
