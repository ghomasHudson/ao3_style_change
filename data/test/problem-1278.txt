“Awfully presumptuous of you.” Harry drawled, affecting a tone similar to one Malfoy himself tended to use. “I’m not just some renter to book by the hour, Malfoy.”
Rosie falling asleep after dinner helped provide an easy excuse for Harry to usher his friends out well before the sun set.
Harry felt himself frowning, annoyed. That curse nonsense again. Hermione was always bringing it up when she visited him, and now Draco kept mentioning it too. “I needed to breed you because you’re my
“Is it, Potter?” Malfoy drawled, eyes sharp with interest, trailing down his body to fixate on the thick bulge between Harry’s legs. “I’d heard you were bigger.”
Draco’s hips jerked forward at the words, trying to slot his prick into Harry’s teasing mouth, and he moaned, bringing his hands down to cradle his swollen belly, head tossed back.
“Very well, I won’t deny our audience, and I can call on him if I have any questions.” The blond demurred, once again adopting a princely pose as he crossed his legs and settled into his chair.
Harry felt himself untense, his muscles relaxing just slightly. He was happy to count this woman as his friend, and was glad that she was apparently his mate’s friend as well.
“Let me take care of you, sweetheart. I know exactly what you like; what you need.” Harry chided, pulling his mouth back just slightly to chastise his mate. “You just lay back and take it.”
Harry’s larger cock, the ovipositor, butted up against the bump of his mate’s belly, and he was only slightly forlorn at the fact that he wouldn’t be able to fuck Draco’s sweet cunt or arse for a while yet, stuffed as they were with his eggs.
. It tended to include incredibly well fitting, tailored suits, trousers which always somehow managed to cup his gorgeous bum in an unseemly way, and waistcoats that drew your eye to just how tight his waist was.
Draco stepped eagerly under the rainfall showerhead, his platinum blond locks darkening in the spray. He let out a happy moan, eyes shut and head tilted up towards the water.
And with that, we conclude the tale of the Beastly Mermaid and his Little Beauty. And their ridiculous sex life. Rest assured that Harry is just as lewd when un-cursed. Draco will be well taken care of.
Ron’s eyes immediately widened, and suddenly his gaze swept more discerningly over Draco’s form. Draco had begun to use highly effective tailoring charms on some of Harry’s things, so the swell of his stomach was less exceedingly obvious, but -
“Hello Draco, hello Harry!” She called, and Harry had to fight down a flare of territorialism at the sight of another male near his mate.
His breathing was measured, practiced at this point as he was with distance running. He rarely felt winded anymore, even after an hour of exertion nearing his top speed.
Harry laughed, an easy, carefree sound, and wrapped him up in his stupidly muscled arms, which were now bare. “You love it, Malfoy. You can’t deny it, not after you came so hard that you started getting slick like a girl while I was eating you out.”
stay here, with me. I won’t let you go, and I won’t let people come here to potentially hurt you and my clutch.”
managed to recover the Mermaid’s Thistle that Draco had picked, and he made Harry be extra careful with
They strolled up and down the streets of Marseillan together, doing their grocery shopping, going out for dinner, getting morning coffee and pastries.
Draco gasped, eyes rolling back as a wash of magic rushed through in. The familiar tingle of a cleaning charm ripped through him, uncommonly powerful, the locus of which focused on the sensitive furl of his arsehole. The feeling was so close to an orgasm that it almost physically hurt him, sensitive as he was, and he was left shivering and shuddering as the magic flowed through him.
“It will have to do.” Draco replied, looking over the jar in his hands, just barely able to make out the shifting masses of the gillyweed bundles suspended in pond-water inside. “All of my normal suppliers are completely out.”
Harry wants to snap, before realising how revealing that would be. How many of Harry’s secrets Malfoy seems to read so plainly, when Malfoy is still a mystery.
“Hmm.” Thoughtful, she tapped a leaf with the tip of her nail. The plant crawled up and wrapped itself around her finger. She smiled, a sad softness to her expression. “‘War survivor’. It’s all in the label, isn’t it? Being constantly labeled ‘survivor’...it permeates everything. Every conversation, every gesture, every new relationship you make. It gave me a certain amount of power, it’s true. People leave me alone, most of the time. I can devote myself to my research. I can be quiet. I can not talk to people for days.
“Hello, Mr Potter,” Draco’s assistant greets him. Jemima is always so nice to Harry, all bright smiles and friendly words, and Harry feels doubly like shit for deceiving her as well.
As much as it pains me to see a fellow Slytherin excluded from the fun, Draco, rules are rules: only the people present on that fateful night can play. Next time, please consider that, lest you get your BFF
He thinks of being thirty, Harry Potter on his doorstep, offering his personal security services in a bloody suspicious series of circumstances, and being unable to send him away.
There’s a door on the side, opening onto a huge walk-in wardrobe with neat rows of suits, shirts, coats, wizarding dress robes, and perfectly spaced piles of jumpers and shirts on the shelves. Underneath the shelves, along the wardrobe walls, is a collection of shoes that would make a shoe shop pale in comparison. And, interestingly, a couple of pairs of rather muddy trainers. So Malfoy’s a runner, then. Not that Harry couldn’t have guessed — he certainly has the body of one, all lean muscle and supple gait.
Malfoy’s grey eyes are cold despite the warm firelight. Harry notes the taut shoulders, the tight-knuckled grip on the book, the lips set in a thin line.
It was Harry's turn to ask difficult questions. Draco couldn't very well tell him that any career choice he made was doomed to be moot, since he would restart another new life on his next birthday.
Harry spent the evening with us last night. Everybody likes him. (Even though Gran Narcissa goes after him every chance she gets.) (I think she’s testing him.) (Adults are weird.)
All things considered, I prefer the latter, but no matter. This whole awkward dance has to stop. I’ve work to do. This isn’t conducive to a productive work environment. Find a way to END IT.
its existence. One thing that trip confirmed, though, was my passion for Magizoology. So when I came back to England after six months studying various Scandinavian creatures in their natural habitats, I applied for a degree at the Newt Scamander School in Cambridge.”
Pansy held his arm, her fingernails polished with dark green digging into his sleeve. She buried her face into her scarf and Draco cast a Warming charm over them.
Finding out the truth about Harry’s presence in his life feels like a double betrayal: like Draco’s own heart betrayed him, just as much as Harry did. It’s a truth Draco’s mind can’t reconcile.
Malfoy was grinning in earnest now, eyes flicking to Harry, as if uncertain whether he should meet his eyes or firmly look away. Merlin, how long had it been since he’d looked at Malfoy from this close? He’d forgotten—he’d forgotten how
Because the man — Harry’s gaze travels up the tall, lean frame and up to the back of a shockingly white-blond head — is Draco Malfoy.
“So we’re agreed, then?” Jeff said, holding out a paw in Draco’s direction. “You agree to my terms, and I agree to yours?”
But then Harry looks at him with those eyes, those fucking eyes Draco’s spent so long thinking about in the depths of his Hogwarts bed, and Harry smiles at him, the bright, open smile he used to save for his closest friends... something warms in Draco’s chest. Something he’d long thought would never warm again.
Harry announced out loud. The gargoyle bent its head ever so slightly and stepped aside, revealing the spiraling stone stairwell leading to the office. With one last look at Draco, Harry took the stairs two at a time.
Cautiously, he started skating, the blades of his skates carving lines on the ice behind him. Skating was like flying, in a way: the gliding speed, the cold air whipping his hair, the graceful motions of his limbs. It came back quickly. Draco skated around the rink a few times, more self-assured with each turn he took. It felt good, actually. It felt
Harry’s chest ached at the sound. It was novel and thrilling, knowing he was the one who made Malfoy laugh like that.
“What a fitting term, Draco. It’s wonderful.” Luna beamed. “I’m so glad you picked a career as a journalist. You have such a way with words.”
Draco felt Harry’s hand slip into his again, pulling him towards the castle. This was something Harry liked, apparently. Hand-holding. The cold afternoon air smelled of snow and firewood and Draco felt warm again.
Gripping Draco’s arse through his jeans, Harry moves impossibly closer, bites at Draco’s neck. “I’ll suck your cock, I’ll—I’ll
information. Ears hot, curiosity and guilt swirling in equal measure in his chest, Harry had sifted through every one of them avidly.
The newspaper clippings are followed by several bank statements, showing revenue streams from countries around the world.
Harry pushes the door open. The storage cupboard is small: barely more than ten feet deep, with tall shelves on each side, and enough room between them for a grown man to stand long enough to grab the supplies he needs and get out before it becomes claustrophobic. At least, it’s the kind of space that would feel that way to Harry, were it not for Draco’s presence in it. Draco is standing with his back turned on Harry, jacket discarded somewhere — on the back of his desk chair, Harry remembers in a flash, stupid of him not to have paid attention — shirt sleeves rolled up and lean forearms on display. He lifts his wand to wave it at a box on the highest shelf, the fabric of his trousers stretched across his arse and his long legs. Harry swallows dryly and mindlessly shuts the door behind him.
“It’s not,” Harry tells him, heart jumping in his chest. Jesus, he did not expect to have that kind of talk with a child when he woke up today. He did not expect —
“You’ve never minced your words, Potter,” Malfoy smiled eventually, slow and intent. “To think I used to hate that about you.”
“Sorry,” Hermione smiles at them in apology, “my boyfriend had some unpleasant experiences with Acromantula in his youth. He does love and support them, though!”
Did you get my last letter? (It’s a rhetorical question. I know you did. I sent it by owl to be sure you got it.)
Not only was Harry single, but he had come out to Draco and Draco had come out to him—Draco who, apparently, was notoriously
“Temporarily. Give me… three days. Enough to bring Scorpius home, get things sorted. Enough for me to think.” He looks back at Harry, and it’s almost pleading. “Can you do that?”
Tamara stretched her forelegs forward and extended her wings. Her eyes blinked open to reveal shiny onyx irises and she stared straight at Draco as she lifted herself onto four legs with a clinking noise.
But… But Harry wouldn’t— He’s not that kind of bloke. He can’t— He can’t let a man suck him off… can he? He looks down through the blur of thundering need, to the place where Malfoy’s fingers hover. Harry looks at the bulge of his cock tenting his pants, so close to Malfoy’s face… to Malfoy’s
Draco lets his head drop against the back of the sofa. “It’s over.” He sighs, a trembling exhale. “You’re the one who saw it first. You’re the one who said it. ‘This is a nightmare. This is fucking
It’s not the first time the Ministry has tried to give him this type of work. He’s always refused: he has no interest in financial cases. He likes action-oriented jobs, and sitting at a desk reviewing pages and pages of accounting records holds no interest for him.
“You alright, Draco? You look a little pale,” Harry said, his smile wilting in concern. He flew down to Draco’s level, hand held out. Draco stood very still, willing his broom to behave. He would not let Harry touch him again; experience showed Harry’s touch tended to turn Draco into a flustered, babbling fool. It was just unfitting of a Malfoy and of a professional demon. “I mean,” continued Harry, this time with a tiny crooked smile, “you always look pale. I was wondering—”
Draco cast a spell on his right hand, the one with one finger currently engaged in fucking Harry’s hole. The sparks of magic skittered against Harry’s rim, and he felt Draco’s finger slick with conjured lube on the next movement upward. The sensation made him moan and writhe wantonly.
“What’s a good name for a Niffler?” Luna said, placing Jeff on her shoulder. Jeff, resigned to his fate and determined to make a good impression, curled around her scarf.
The burnt hydrangea on his right hand side, its grey petals singed brown. The tall grey vase, a long crack running up its side as if hit by a spell…
It always was—Draco hated to admit it—a lot of fun. All of them were good players, even Weasley, now that the pressure of performance was off. Often, the other Eighth Year students would gather on the stands to watch. There was also the constant side effect of having Harry Potter on the team: the gawking Potter fans. Students from all years huddling on the stands and cheering loudly if Harry so much as lifted his forefinger to push his slipping glasses up on his nose. The one time Draco has caught the Snitch at the beginning of the year—his first win against Harry ever, which was personal cause for celebration—the student body was so furious they had almost caused a riot. Since then, McGonagall had forbidden access to the Eighth Year's Quidditch for anyone who wasn’t an Eighth Year student, and the games had a much friendlier feel to them.
Malfoy is gone without a word in the time it takes for Harry to recover from his orgasm. He adjusts his clothing the best he can, unsure if Malfoy’s concealing spells still hold now that their caster is gone. Then he stays in the dark box, staring into the distance, the ballet coming to a close on stage. He must have missed more than half of it, between the moment Malfoy had sat next to him to the moment he’d licked his lips and risen, slithering out of the box before Harry could grab his wrist and haul him back on his lap and—
So he marches up to him. Malfoy watches him with a lifted eyebrow, but his expression changes as Harry comes closer. He steps backwards, his back hitting the windowpane. It’s too dark to make out the subtle ripples of emotion on Malfoy’s face, but Harry sees wariness, hesitation. Vulnerability, as he closes his fingers around Malfoy’s chin, cups his jaw. Malfoy’s skin is smooth, with just a hint of stubble underneath the pads of Harry’s fingers. He hears the catch of Malfoy’s breath; can feel his own, stuck in his throat. His face is barely an inch away from Malfoy’s, bathed in Malfoy’s warm breath. He smells of smoke, clean laundry, that masculine cologne with hints of leather and cut grass. And Harry wants… He wants… He wants things he’d always been told he shouldn’t. He wants more than Malfoy’s mouth on his cock, more than Malfoy falling to his knees to avoid Harry’s eyes, more than the hurried, impersonal taking of pleasure with no chance of giving it back. He wants to feel Malfoy — the whole of him — wants to feel that lean, hard body against him. He wants to bring Malfoy’s face to his, and so he does, with a tug of his fingers in Malfoy’s hair.
Harry makes the decision for him. He strokes Draco’s hair out of his face, tucks it behind his ear with warm, featherlight knuckles. There’s a raw, reverent tenderness in the way he touches Draco, and Draco is helpless and unreserved in his hands. Harry’s fingers trail along the collar of Draco’s shirt. They stop against his pulse point, a question.
Harry felt his face heat, half in embarrassment and half in reluctant desire. Over the night, they’d fucked so many times, they’d acted so uninhibited, he had lost track of what had been said and done. In the soft daylight bathing the cabin, Malfoy’s filthy words and their unabashed hunger for each other felt surreal.
“I do now,” Harry said, hands balled into fists. A furious frown twisted the lightning scar on his forehead.
All right, I’ll be serious. Something I didn’t expect was how supportive the people who truly mattered were. Your friends and family, especially. I’ve had a healthy fear of Hermione specifically, ever since she punched me when we were schoolkids. I half-expected her to repeat her performance after finding out I was shagging you.
“I’ve never heard of you being anyone’s bodyguard. Actually, come to think of it, I’ve never heard anything about you
“I would have never accepted this mission if I couldn’t protect you and your son the way you needed me to.”
Harry gets a whiff of Narcissa’s rose perfume as she leans over Draco. “Happy birthday, baby boy,” she whispers as she kisses him goodnight, but Harry catches it.
“You mean, the people who almost locked me up seven years ago for war crimes, and would gladly lock me up today for theft and burglary?”
Harry’s gaze met his across the pitch, and he smiled, brightly, openly, a smile that Draco knew was meant just for him.
“You didn’t even clean up after the last time,” Malfoy murmured behind him, his voice trembling with lust. “Mmh,” he added with an appreciative hum, his fingers already pumping inside Harry, “you feel so wet, so filthy. So full of my spunk. I could fuck you all day and you wouldn’t get enough, would you?”
All the people Draco is supposed to be are mixed and jumbled in Harry’s head, and he can’t tell which one he’s supposed to hate and which one he’s supposed to like anymore.
“You don’t know that, darling. You’ve been there for years. He’s probably not felt like this for as long as you have. Give him time.”
They hastily bent their heads over their parchments, pretending to take notes. This earned them a stern look from Granger.
“Kill Harry Potter?” He hoped Mephistopheles couldn’t see the bobbing of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed. “A ridiculous and utterly useless plan, if you want my opinion, but if it makes the bosses happy...”
“And… Ron wanted me to tell you it’ll be fine if you find Draco is innocent. He’ll work with you to see it through, if that’s your conclusion. However, he asked me to remind you that you still don’t have any information on the origin of Draco’s wealth, and that might be the only thing that could satisfy the Minister.”
He caught Harry’s questioning gaze from across the table and smiled. Lucifer, how good he looked. His jet-black hair was in its usual state of disarray, but now Draco knew how soft it actually felt when he carded his fingers through it. He knew how warm and smooth Harry’s skin was under his hands. He knew what Harry’s smile meant.
Mephistopheles bristled like he always did when he wasn’t sure whether Draco was pulling his leg or not. Given that Draco did it every occasion he got, he was surprised the demon hadn’t dropped dead from sheer irritation yet.
“Seems like we have stuff in common nowadays, too,” Potter said. He still looked furious, his cheeks pink, his glasses slightly fogged up. And so were Draco’s, perhaps for entirely different reasons. Potter was breathing hard, straight in Draco’s face, and it wasn’t a long stretch for Draco to imagine Potter breathing like this in an entirely different scenario. Possibly one that didn’t involve their entire Hogwarts class watching. He was beginning to worry that if Potter came an inch closer, his erection would poke him in the groin. He was hard as an Erumpent’s horn and probably just as likely to… er… explode at the slightest touch. If he didn’t get away from Potter immediately…
“The ‘Bend and Snap’ is infallible, Penelope.” He grins, winking at her. “I promise you, your team’s morale will be off the charts once everyone gets laid next weekend.”
she’d probably say with her teasing smile. But it's been so long, and Harry's the one with him now. So he holds Harry’s head in his hands, thumbs bracketing his face. Harry’s cheeks are pink, his eyebrows drawn, his eyes gleaming in the soft half-light.
“Yes,” Draco grits out, choked. Anything to take the edge off. To make him forget how real this is. “I don’t want gentle. I want
His eyes trained on Malfoy’s pretty bum, he didn’t notice Malfoy had stopped, frozen to the spot, until he walked right into him.
The sky was turning orange and pink when a shiny-faced and frizzy-haired Hermione cast the last preserving spell on the snowman—a masterpiece of sculpture and collaboration, if she was to be believed—and everyone took the direction of the castle. His hand in Harry’s, walking side by side with him, Draco noticed most of them were in pairs. Ginny and Luna, Ron and Hermione, Pansy and Neville, Dean and Seamus. It seemed so easy, so normal—a group of teenagers, some single, some not, walking back from an afternoon of teasing and fun in the snow.
“So you haven’t looked at potential careers yet? Only ways to decide which general areas might fit you better?”
Draco’s eyes flicked to the spot where his gaze had kept returning since they’d sat at the Library table.
He stands, picks up the clothes he’s dropped in a bundle near the bed. Draco hasn’t stirred yet. His closed eyelids and peaceful face are begging to be kissed. Would Draco object to being woken up for a round of slow morning sex? Not wanting to try his luck so early in the day, Harry decides to come back with a cup of coffee as enticement — shower, fresh clothes, then coffee. He pads out of Draco’s bedroom as quietly as he can. Rushing up the stairs naked, he’s suddenly more grateful than ever that Draco’s room is just a floor below his. At least there’s no risk of running into an unsuspecting child or house-elf in his state of love-bite-covered undress.
Draco hesitates. But Harry’s expression is expectant, open, so he says, “I could make myself available tonight, for instance—”
Harry grabs his wrist as Malfoy moves to pass him by. Malfoy freezes. His eyes slowly drop to the place where Harry’s touching him, then drift back up.
Draco snorted before he could help himself. “I seriously doubt it, Potter. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that it wouldn’t be
now? — isn’t the best time to be suddenly madly turned on by the reality of their new situation. Harry wills his cock to behave.
He took Harry’s arm. “We’re getting out of here, Potter,” he said. Harry understood immediately: he was going to Apparate them out. Except… Malfoy screwed his eyes shut, tensed as if about let the Apparition magic flow through him, and then—
The moment was warm, easy, intimate. Something had shifted in their friendship. Draco couldn’t tell if it had happened tonight, or if it had been months, maybe years in the making.
“Merlin,” Malfoy breathes. “That would be almost too hot to bear.” He pulls back regretfully. Harry sits up, taking his t-shirt off, reaching for Malfoy’s. Malfoy stops him halfway through, a slightly dazed expression on his face. “I… You—” he stammers. His eyes travel down Harry’s chest, his navel, the line of dark hair leading to the waistband of his joggers. “Fuck. I want to see every inch of you.”
“Yeah.” Harry leans in again. Draco can feel his erection through layers of clothing. It hasn’t wilted, and neither has Draco’s. His eyes want to roll back in his skull, but Harry takes his chin, turns his face, and whispers in his ear. “Confident. Dauntless. But — you know that, don’t you? You look like you’re daring the world not to
“Boyfriends would be the most accurate term, yes,” Draco conceded. The word still stung, and he chastised himself.
Mistor Potter. Ernestina is only saying.” Then she turns her back to him and continues her preparations.
feel that way anymore. I hope the good I’ve done since the war surpasses and outlasts my past actions. I might never apologise enough for them, but I’m also sick of apologising for them, you know? There’s a delicate balance between fruitless remorse and indulgent self-satisfaction, but I need elements of both. Remorse keeps me on the right track. Pride in who I’ve become gives me a reason to keep going.
Sitting all night on a sticky leatherette seat squished between a drunk Weasley and an equally drunk (but still abysmally dour) Smith, or having dinner with you? Hmm. My heart wavers.
Marvelling at Draco’s impeccable composure in the face of embarrassment, Harry watches him disappear down the kitchen staircase. He is, once again, left to face Narcissa Malfoy alone. Her thin lips are still curved into an unsettling smile, but her eyes, now stone-cold, have lost the gleeful shine they had a minute ago.
Draco realised he still held the Prothimioscope in his hand. He set it on the central island and the little bronze device started spinning, its gentle buzz filling the hush of the kitchen.
the light from the massive windows hitting his eyes, the overcast London sky altogether blinding despite the late afternoon hour.
There’s a second of hesitation in Malfoy’s eyes, but his expression sets to neutral too fast for Harry to read into it. He backs away, hands lifted in apology, a rueful smile on his kiss-pinked lips. “The pleasure’s all mine, Potter. You don’t owe me anything.”
Draco feels his ears grow hot, and raises a brow. “I don’t wait for you to be around, Potter. I bend over fairly often. Every weekend, in fact.”
In the back of the study, Draco rises from the ground, wand still pointed at Smith, his other hand rubbing his eye.
Harry said, fingers digging into the planes of Malfoy’s back, legs wrapping around his waist. “Fuck me, Draco,” he said again, Malfoy’s first name escaping from his lips in the daze of his lust.
That’s what you’re supposed to do.” Draco purrs by his side. He grabs his hand again. “Here,” he says. “In my office.”
“Draco...” Harry tapped his fingers to his lips, his eyes wide and full of mirth. “It was. It was a truly terrible thing. We just defiled our dear friend’s kitchen.”
Harry thought. There was no other way to explain the faint tremor in his chest, the butterflies in his stomach.
“Clearly,” Draco says, his voice cold. He's panting. It's ridiculous. He should be… he should be punching the air, bursting with glee. He shouldn’t be feeling like his body's frozen over, a dull dread seeping through his veins. He pinches the bridge of his nose, exhaling shakily. “Harry… we’re not supposed to…”
With Harry’s friends around the table, Draco decided to seize the opportunity to bring up something that had been nagging him since their last day at Hogwarts.
Daydreaming has turned into a dangerous act. The memory of the stolen dalliance hovers in the periphery of Harry’s mind, like the elephant in the room that Harry refuses to acknowledge.
“And how does that pertain to my job?” Harry demands. “Isn’t the Fraud and Finance Department on that case?”
Draco has a few hours free on a Sunday afternoon. Draco, Harry and Scorpius take Balzac for a long walk in Hyde Park. It’s a cold, overcast, calm February day. Enough that Scorpius doesn’t get sensory overload. Draco and Ernestina learned about the value of this kind of weather for Scorpius through trial and error and Dr Dawson’s directions, but Harry seems to understand it instinctively, suggests they go out.
Their little chat, though, seemed miles away from Harry’s mind. Yards below Draco, spurred on by their teammates’ cries, Harry was barreling towards the fluttering golden ball at a vertiginous speed. Draco, rooted to the spot, didn’t even try to catch up to him.
Thank you to everyone who read, commented and left kudos so far ❤️ Your words of encouragement and your enthusiastic speculations never fail to put a smile on my face!
at him, like he’s about to pull the rug from under him — and leans forward. He lowers his head over Draco’s cock, keeps his eyes on Draco for a heart-stopping moment, before licking a long stripe from root to tip. Then he takes him into his mouth, and Draco’s vision goes white around the edges.
ensured their conversation stayed private. It was the perfect configuration for a discussion about the future of the Boy Who Lived and the youngest Death Eater alive. “I counted about forty-three different personality tests we could take to determine our ideal careers.” He gave Draco a conspiratorial little smile. “You were right. McGonagall doesn’t have a clue what she asked us to do.”
Draco gives his head a shake. “I’m not. But it’s time I followed in your footsteps. Being with me in the circumstances we’re in… it would ruin you, Harry. And I can’t—” His voice breaks slightly, and Harry watches him, mute dread spreading through him, as Draco takes a steadying breath. When he speaks again, it’s clear to Harry that he’s made his decision, and no amount of convincing will change it. “I can’t let that happen, Harry. I can’t live with myself, knowing I’m the cause of it.”
Now I’m taking a break from it all. My friends worry I’m going to turn into some sort of rich layabout if I don’t choose another career path soon. And not even a fun, eccentric one, to make their assumptions even more tragic. They really needn’t worry, though. I have a few ideas already. But, as I said… I need a break. I need to do nothing for a while. Be with my thoughts. Go for coffee in the mornings, have a nice chat with Cecilia, then go for a long walk (London is so bloody lovely in the spring.) Come home, cook, read a book.
Harry’s certain that he’s not straight now, and it took Malfoy to reveal that foundational truth about himself. He’s not straight, and yet he doesn’t want to test that new knowledge with anybody else. He just wants to be… not straight with Malfoy.
“I used to think you were the luckiest bastard on earth, you know?” Draco tells Harry when he thinks he can speak with a steady voice again. “Being Harry Potter sounded so fucking brilliant. I was almost resentful that you didn’t take more advantage of it.”
They stood where their orgasm had left them, Malfoy bent in half, Harry draped over him, catching their breaths for a long time. Harry was the first to move. A reluctant wiggle, and he pulled his cock out. Malfoy moaned softly as he straightened himself.
Harry turns his head. In the dimness, Malfoy’s eyes glint like a cat’s. “Why, Potter,” Malfoy says. “I’m here to enjoy the show, just like you.”
“Hello, kids,” Ginny Weasley called. Hand in hand with a pink-nosed, ski-goggle-wearing Luna Lovegood, they approached the small group huddled around the six-foot-tall snowman they had built. Ginny whistled appreciatively. “Blimey. I see you’ve been busy.”
Draco’d flashed him a look, but had peered inside the bag nonetheless. He’d stopped still for a speechless moment, then pulled the old vinyl from inside.
has to be the responsible one here, don't you think? We clearly have no idea what we're doing. Imagine if we come back to McGonagall with something as predictable as ‘Harry Potter, Head Auror’ and ‘Draco Malfoy, Captain Of The England Quidditch Team’?”
“Oh.” Harry lifted an eyebrow. “So you won’t sneak boastful details about how good a lay I am in your article about Luna?”
a family. And we’re all going to be together on Christmas.” She fingered her girlfriend’s long, radish-shaped earrings fondly. “You gotta stop saying things like that. You’re bumming everyone out.”
“I liked your room,” Draco told her, for lack of a more constructive thing to say. It wasn’t a lie. Draco remembered the slight, but real, bite of envy he’d felt at the sight of Luna’s freely-painted walls, covered in a haphazard collection of family photographs and watercolour illustrations of fantastic animals Draco had never heard of.
it’s true.” Harry waggled his eyebrows. Draco laughed, thoroughly charmed. It felt brilliant to finally be able to do so in Harry’s presence. “You can’t ask me for an interview after sex. I’m weak and pliant, and I could agree to anything. It’s unfair.”
“Merlin’s holy bollocks,” Malfoy said, and finally his mouth twisted up in a smile. “You think I’m fit. You’d like me to shag you. Oh, sweet Salazar. This is definitely worth being around for the end of the world.”
Indeed, it had. They were lying on the floor of the cabin, Harry’s Auror cloak long gone, discarded in one corner of the room or the other. Harry couldn’t remember, despite the protestations of his scratched elbows and knees—a reminder of the last time they’d fucked before sunrise, Malfoy holding him by the hips and pounding him roughly from behind, the both of them moaning as though it was the first time they’d ever fucked and not the fourth already. A soft ray of sunshine was filtering through a crack in the shutters that wasn’t completely filled with snow.
A few other times — rare times, but still — it all feels like an interminable lie. Moving on from the lies he’s been told as a teenager, to lying for a living himself. There are times when he wants to tell the world — and the Minister — to shove it, and today is clearly shaping up to be a day that tests his resolve.
“No, Penelope, I’m genuinely curious.” He puts his hands on his waist, tilts his hips, gives Potter a defiant glare. “Potter here appears to believe I live as a personal insult to him.”
I don’t understand why Daddy would make it a surprise. (I dislike surprises. They break the routine. They give me little frights. But I noticed some people like them. It makes them feel ‘special’, Nestine once explained.) (I feel plenty special on my own, thank you very much.) Also. Isn't a surprise only when the other person doesn't know it’s coming? Harry must know. After all, last Wednesday, he took me to the same shop as Daddy did the Saturday before. (Bright. Loud. People. Why do they insist on taking me along with them?) (But the shop is muted. Low voices. Flitting gazes. I like it.) Harry looked at the rings. He asked me what colour Daddy would prefer. (The answer is silver.)
Nice to see Draco Malfoy at a loss for words, for once, Harry thinks, and reaches up to undo Draco’s trousers as Draco’s hands fall to his hair, fisting it lightly. Above Harry, he’s already moaning softly. God, Harry hasn’t even begun to touch him. Hasn’t even pulled his cock free. Maybe it’s a good thing that Draco’s so into this, because Harry has no idea what he’s doing, no idea if he’ll be any good at it. All he knows is that he
Behind him, Harry lets out a humourless laugh and pushes his fingers deeper. “You're even bossier up in your office, aren't you?”
I bought tickets, met her in front of the Burger King on Leicester Square, and we had Whoppers and fried onion rings before going to the play.
in the middle of a Muggle street. He thought he’d been on time, but maybe it was best not to start the day by contradicting her.
“That makes two of us,” Harry said, running his thumb across Malfoy’s wet lips. “Gits like you shouldn’t be allowed to be this hot.”
but I might have to preface a lot of the next chapters the same way as well, so... Yeah. This is my favorite part of the story.
“Oh, who cares?” he moans. “There are giant bloody spiders hanging over our heads! I don’t want to hear about spiders, let alone giant ones, I just want to eat my weight in canapés and get out of here as soon as humanly possible.”
With one last smile, Harry joined the snowman-building group. Luna Lovegood was next to Draco in an instant.
deliberately not caring whether it hits Draco as well as himself. He pulls his pants and jeans back on. The glittering lights of London and the sweet summer air of the evening seem to taunt him, mock him. He’s not sure he wants to stay here much longer.
Harry wonders idly as he scales yet another sumptuous stairwell, thinking of the sea of bared decolletages swinging across the ballroom floor a few rooms away. He’s never seen the point of so much exposed flesh. He’d been fine fumbling with Ginny in the dark, back when they were still dating years ago, chasing the tail ends of heightened teenage lust. Even now, he doesn’t need to see what he’s touching to be… to be… to be
Malfoy mimicked Harry in a high-pitched falsetto voice. “Please don’t tell me this is how you’ve made all your life decisions so far.”
They reached the Great Lake. Dark waves crested with white foam rolled at the surface. The Lake had never looked like a lake to Draco. It looked like a small ocean, downsized to fit in the Hogwarts grounds. It scared him a bit, the way the ocean always did. He remembered the chill he’d felt during the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry had dived into the muddy waters in Fourth Year—
“They have conducted a post mortem of the whole Voldemort fiasco, you see. The general consensus is that Voldemort should have received more direct support from our higher-ups in the Hereafter instead of letting him run unchecked. You know as well as I do that the bosses hate to meddle with human evilness when it reaches such professional levels. But the lad had a lot of potential. He could have gone far. And to be defeated by—by a—“ Mephistopheles stuttered the words as though the very thought of them was repulsive. “—by a
“Well.” Harry gazes at him, a small smile on his lips. “You looked so — confident. Anyone would feel shy in comparison.”

the scars. Fucking twisted, am I? I like them, because they’re real. They’re the public’s opinion, materialised on my skin. It’s always going to be there. I look at them and I remember… everything I used to believe in, all the past I’ll never be able to erase, no matter what I do, no matter the good I do. I’ll always be a monster. A
Harry had the habit of making Draco’s ribs feel too tight for his lungs, sure. Yet making a fool of himself just wouldn’t do.
Every single one of Draco’s words is like a blow to the face, and Harry wants to shake him. “I know. I know you don’t need me. But walking away from you now would be as good as giving up, when I know that the Ministry is waiting for the slightest hint I could drop to justify an investigation.”
Had Malfoy… no choice but to steal? But Malfoy is old money, has always been old money. And old money doesn’t run dry… does it? Harry realizes he’s never given much thought to what had become of Malfoy after the trials. His father had been sent to Azkaban. His mother had been sentenced to five years of house arrest. And Malfoy… Malfoy had slipped through the net thanks to him being a minor at the time of the events. Thanks to him never committing evil acts of his own volition. Thanks to Harry, who’d testified for him in front of the Wizengamot.
Harry threw his head back, clawing at Malfoy’s back. Malfoy’s thick cock was slowly sliding inside, breaching Harry with shallow little thrusts that barely left time for him to adjust to the girth of it—
Mr Potter,” Pansy drawls, her dark eyes flicking up and down Harry’s body. He’s worn dress trousers and a crisp white shirt for the occasion. He supposes Pansy’s sharp fashion sense approves of his outfit, if the appreciative tilt of her head is anything to go by. There is no trace of contrition in her tone or posture. It’s as if her last words in Harry’s presence hadn’t been to hand him over to Voldemort. She holds out a red-nailed hand. “Delighted to meet you again. And for our dear Draco’s birthday, no less.”
His colleagues are watching him with a focused, hungry look on their faces, and Draco smirks. “Step two: you bend to grab the thing you just dropped. Like this.”
His head is swimming with the shock of Draco, his shirt off and on the floor of his bedroom, his nakedness equally defiant and vulnerable, all the marks from the war exposed for Harry to see. The scars…
anything besides indifferent contempt—intrigued, jealous, fascinated, infatuated—was also just this: an
“Yes, yes, we did fuck a lot, Malfoy,” Harry rolled his eyes to mask his embarrassment—and the utterly unprofessional fact that, deep down, he’d rather spend another 24 hours stuck here with Malfoy than resume their investigation. “Yes, you ran to the bathroom and cleaned up right after
It’s only been a couple of weeks since Scorpius' accident. His magic is still unstable, sometimes rolling off him in waves that feel loud against Harry’s skin, sometimes going quiet for hours. He seems unaffected by the magical turmoil, though. Harry, as always, is utterly impressed with the boy’s resilience. Scorpius takes a breath, puts his hands on the keys, and a lilting, melancholy melody rises from the piano. The assembled guests fall silent. Even though Harry has heard it before — Scorpius has been practising ceaselessly for weeks — he still holds his breath while the child plays. Around him, the guests look on, equally mesmerised. Pansy squeezes Blaise’s hand between her own. Hermione has her mouth open. Ron holds a forgotten canapé between thumb and middle finger. Narcissa and Ernestina both discreetly dab at their eyes with handkerchiefs. And behind the sofa, Draco stands with his arms folded and an expression so proud Harry has to look away, like he’s witnessed something hidden, intimate.
Harry doesn’t envy Kingsley’s job. He’s perfectly content with his own occupation: the fieldwork, the planning, the wait before a big strike. He enjoys his independence, and he enjoys occasionally working with Ron’s team of Aurors and Hermione’s army of Unspeakables.
still hanging over them, Malfoy touched his fingers to Harry’s naked chest, his brow furrowed. There was an odd expression on his face—as if the sight of Harry naked had rendered him speechless, making everything more… real.
“Scorpius is autistic,” he says. “He was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome about three years ago. He has regular appointments with a special needs therapist. She helps him with reading social cues and communication, self-soothing skills, handling his magic, and so forth. He’s been doing much better since we were able to determine what made him...
Ron shakes his head. “Harry, Kingsley has a lot more faith in you than in Smith. In the end… I think he’ll listen to what you have to say.”
“For fuck’s sake, woman,” he mutters with a mock-disapproving shake of his head. He glances at Potter, takes a breath, and straightens his shoulders. “Yes, Potter. Over here. I can sign this in.”
He’s not sure what Harry sees in his expression. His eyes are closed, and he starts when Harry’s hands come to rest on the dip of his waist.
As you are well aware, your dear friend Potter asked me for a favour yesterday. Said favour contributed to your team winning the most recent installment of your ridiculously childish ‘betting war’ (ugh).
“Oooooh yes,” Malfoy moans, head between his arms, “so good, so slow, fuck, Potter, you’re huge, yes, keeping going, keep fucking me, I want you  balls deep in me—”
He keeps the suit jacket he’s wearing underneath, patting it down. His fingers brush the small, round shape in the crook of his pocket. Since Malfoy gave him his Snitch back, Harry’s taken to carrying it around everywhere again. But now the feel of it is tinted with sadness. The memory of something he thought he could have, and flitted out of his hands like a Snitch taking flight.
Well, fine. They’d see. He would go to his class’s tenth year graduation anniversary kicking and screaming—metaphorically speaking, of course. Draco did no such things as kicking or screaming.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Shocking. Although... She is frighteningly clever, I admit. Besides, with her Muggle background, she might even know about Muggle jobs, which the wizarding books I found in the Library can’t help us with.”
It might be the weekend, but Harry's still supposed to be presentable. It won’t do to be late just because he can’t keep his prick in check.
Draco shakes his head. “...And, Salazar, eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy is doing a happy dance as we speak. I’m friends with Harry Potter. Harry Potter is actually taking my side. Un-fucking-believable.”
“You know I’m right!” Harry laughed behind him, and he heard his footsteps as he followed Draco across the bridge.
He lifts the heavy door knocker — a golden snake, for fuck’s sake, and he rolls his eyes at the cliché — then he steps back and waits. A few seconds go by, and he’s about to knock again when the door creaks open as though of its own accord.
He’d run into Pansy in the kitchen the next morning, his t-shirt rumpled, his hair a mess, his chin and cheeks pink with a tell-tale stubble burn. With a playful, knowing smirk, she’d teased him about ‘finally getting a leg over Potter’. Embarrassed and laughing, he’d waved her off.
“Right,” Malfoy says, and Harry swears he can see a small smile forming on his lips. “I didn’t steal anything from you
Merlin. For all Draco had wanted this—had extensively fantasized about this—he could never have imagined what the first pump of his mouth around Harry’s prick would feel like. Lips stretched around the girth of it, the soft wet slide of his tongue along the veined underside, Harry trembling and breathing hard above him—
Hannah winks at Draco. Draco would take great pleasure in watching the colour rise in Potter’s cheeks if he wasn’t sure he was blushing himself.
“Oh, cut the crap,” Harry rolled his eyes. “I know for a fact that you don’t suffer from a lack of suitors, Draco.”
“Mmh, stop it. I don’t think I have a drop of spunk left in me,” Malfoy pushed Harry’s hand away. Harry could hear the grin in his voice. “You wrung me out, Potter.”
he hadn’t noticed. He was walking at his usual brisk, elegant pace, seemingly unhampered by the snow and the irregular terrain, his chin held high like he owned the place. The place being the mountainous slopes of Ben Macdui, in the Cairngorms National Park, currently covered in feet of snow and very much
For everyone else, it was a time of peaceful celebration. For Draco, it was a time of turmoil like he’d never felt.
“Hey... how much do you know about Harry’s plans after Hogwarts?” he asked, voice guarded. Hermione and Ron exchanged a look while Ginny leaned her elbows on the table. Nobody answered and Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh,
Harry stammers, fucking harder. His fist tightens in Malfoy’s hair in warning. It has, astonishingly, the opposite effect. Malfoy’s moans turn into loud groans as he swallows Harry deeper, tighter, too hot, too much, too soon—
That earns him an eye roll. “You need to know the name of the thing you want to Accio for the spell to work.”
“Alright, alright!” Malfoy laughed, throwing his hands up in mock surrender. “I won’t make fun of you, I promise. I won’t tell anybody. Deathbed confession and all that.”
and sat next to him on the piano bench. They’d become steady piano partners after that. With a fond smile, Ron’d told Harry that Rosie now wanted to learn the piano ‘when she was big like Scorpius.’
Harry’d managed to school his features into something that he hoped projected calm, casual confidence, although he felt sweaty-faced and guilty. Ron had appeared at the end of the aisle. He’d narrowed his eyes while he’d taken in Harry’s disheveled state. His clothes were rumpled, his shirt tails untucked, but his flies were done up, thank Merlin and Morgana. Yet Ron must have read something out of the ordinary in the scene: he’d watched Harry, lips pinched, a sure sign that ‘Senior Auror Weasley’ was mentally cataloguing the sight for future examination.
But he’s interrupted by a third Auror who bursts inside the study, pushing a small, bound figure in front of him.
Harry is watching the dregs of his morning tea dry on the inside of his mug, lost in thoughts of shiny rings, blond hair, and denim-clad legs, when the announcement of the interdepartmental mail delivery man snaps him out of his ruminations.
few years older than us. She’s a barista in the coffee shop I go to whenever I run out of coffee, which is always because I never plan ahead. It’s close to
Yet Draco had managed to give Harry as good as he’d got. He’d pushed him into the guest bathroom at the end of the corridor, then into one of the stalls, and—
He unbuttons the top buttons of his shirt as he walks to the wardrobe, and pulls it up and over his head, throwing it on the floor. He grabs a long-sleeved t-shirt and turns, bare skin exposed to the cool air and to Harry’s appalled gaze.
“Dinner is ready, Mistors and Misses,” Ernestina. says before following the little boy upstairs. “Mistor Draco ask Ernestina not to go out of my way,” she adds with an affronted tilt of her eyebrows. “Apologies if the Mistors and Misses don’t find dinner to their likings. It is Mistor Draco’s fault, sirs.”
Harry had bitten a trembling lip and Draco had wrapped his arms around him, humming softly into his hair, murmuring nonsensical reassurances that it would all be alright, one day. It would never be completely alright again, but Draco didn’t expect it to be. He was learning fast that this imperfect balance of joy and pain and sadness and love and fear and bittersweet nostalgia was an intrinsic part of being human. He was fine with it. He had chosen it. He had held Harry close until his shaky sobs had eased into calmer breaths.
“I’m not even sure you need to apologise to anyone, really,” Harry continued. “Tell you the truth, Hermione would probably be terribly disconcerted by a formal apology. And Neville would be terrified. Still,” he said thoughtfully, “I think if you did, they would appreciate it.”
Harry recognises his ‘CV.’ Every single line of it is fake, at least the ones that come after 1998. Nevertheless, he knows each one of them by heart, with a good story to share about each of them, and he knows he could discuss it with Malfoy without raising the slightest suspicion.
Harry’d cringed. “That was an unexpected surprise.” He’d taken the Disillusioned bag hidden behind him on the bed. “But I still have a gift for you.” The spell had faded away instantly, and he’d handed it to Draco. “Here.”
When Dennis Creevey rang the doorbell, Luna jumped off her armchair to greet him. Draco welcomed the break. He felt oddly wrung out, his shirt sticking to his armpits in an uncomfortable, cold sweat. He cast a tired
“And we wouldn’t have ickle First Years visiting us here if our common room wasn’t open for the occasion,” Pansy added, directing a toothy grin towards the First Year boy who lingered near the fire. With an alarmed yelp, the little boy scurried away.
They all take seats around the table — Harry ends up between Draco and his mother. From across the table, Blaise lifts an eyebrow as if to say,
“I wasn’t supposed to tell you about this,” Draco says, shaking his head. “Looks like I can’t even keep my own secrets safe anymore.”
The Christmas tree near the grandfather clock is so tall. Taller than Daddy. Nestine Leviosa’d the golden star perched on the tallest branch. Fourteen (No.) (Fifteen.) gifts on the floor under it. Shiny, pretty paper. Garlands of lights wrapped around the tree. Turned off. I touch it. (Tiny lightbulb. Round, smooth under my fingers. Satisfying.) The lights flicker on. Magic is cool. (Sometimes.)
“You're doing so good,” Draco murmurs, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry lets out a little whimper and humps Draco's hip harder. “So good. You feel so good, Harry.”
part. Just the hiring Harry Potter to be around him 24/7 part. That's idiotic enough. That cannot end well, one way or another. He thinks about stopping it. Actually, he thinks about it too many times a day. It’s hindering his productivity, honestly. Another excellent reason to fire the impossible prat.
Yes, everything’s crystal clear, except for the one little detail that truly caught Harry’s attention.
Went from one extreme to another, the rumours say. Went from blindly abiding by the old pureblood values and traditions, to pulling scantily dressed, glittering young men in the trendiest gay clubs of Muggle London.
He pushes the binder to the side, the silver emblem embossed on it — a serpent wrapped around a sparkling wand — gleaming on the front page.
“No.” The word comes out forceful. Harry throws him a look, and Draco’s face softens. “No. I’m… glad you didn’t.”
“This is something of my own invention,” he said. “Remember the war—?” He met Luna’s eyes again, and barely stopped himself from cringing. He looked away. “Remember when he...when
Draco sighs, a theatrical puff of air that sends his fringe flying up his forehead. “Listen, babes, the long faces shan’t solve the problem of your lackluster lives. Have I taught you nothing after all these fabulous years in my company?”
Draco shuffled his question cards, looking for the next thing to say. There was an odd lump in his throat that made it harder for him to speak right away. After a pause, he asked in a rather raspy voice, “Apologies for another personal question, but our readers are keen on finding out more about your relationship with Neville Longbottom. You’re one of England’s favourite celebrity couples. They even have a name for you: Luneville. Did you know that?”
“Exactly!” Draco exclaims. He and Hermione look like they’re about to invite everyone for a round dance. “That’s what Caduceus is about! You can’t have a potions company without a proper Research and Development department.”
“I’ve received the books and leaflets we ordered,” Hermione had continued as if Harry hadn’t said a thing. She’d rummaged in her school bag before handing a stack of books to Draco. “Here. You’ve got more material on the Muggle personality and career tests we talked about: Holland Codes, Myers-Briggs, NEO PI-R... If you take these and apply the formulas you’ve showed me, you should be set.”
Draco doesn’t come closer to his mother, and she doesn’t seem to mind. Maybe the Malfoys are always like that, Harry thinks — or maybe Draco knows he’s already given too much away without his mother noticing the smell of Harry all over him, too.
Harry stares at him in disbelief, unable to reconcile the image of his Draco, his clever, observant, logical Draco, with the walled-off man in front of him.
He had expected to burst into flames. To explode. To evaporate in a mist of purple smoke. To die, whatever form death could take for a demon.
Harry had imagined something… colder? Greener? Neater and perhaps a bit minimalistic? Something to match Malfoy’s cool, severe persona. Or perhaps the Slytherin cliché Harry had in his mind. Nothing like the pleasant, attractive space he’s standing in at the moment.
By the time he’d managed to get Scorpius asleep, Harry could have recounted Chopin’s life by heart. He’d risen from his chair and cast the motion-sensing charms Draco had told him about. The magic had shimmered over Scorpius’ sleeping form, and Balzac had let a low rumble at the back of his throat.
If Draco didn’t already like Harry a little, seeing him with his son would be the final push. But he’s self-aware enough to know that, however foolish it is of him, he does like Harry, now that he gets to actually know him.
to look at him to know. His cock was thickening by the minute. Draco crossed his legs and strategically placed his hands over his lap.
Taken aback, Draco looked down at his question cards. As expected, he couldn’t find an answer to his predicament there. “All right. So the war encouraged you on your path to become Britain’s leading Magizoologist, which makes a lot of people consider you—quite justly, I might add—a prominent figure of the post-Second Wizarding War generation.”
Draco, ridiculously, had thought he’d become this kind of friend to Harry. Apparently, he’d been mistaken.
“Honestly,” Hermione had said sternly. “I know how Harry can be, but I expected better behaviour from you, Draco.”
“Aww, do you wish I’d visit more?” Jeff said with a saccharine smile. “You know I always say we don’t see enough of you, down by the red oak tree.”
“Easy for you to say. I’m only the estranged cousin. You’re the providential godfather. You could do no wrong, even if you woke him up.”
Narcissa nods. “Draco owes you his life, Mr Potter, perhaps on more than one level,” she says. “However, do not forget than you owe me yours.”
“Don’t forget the Prothimioscope,” she said. She smiled fondly when Draco placed the device on the carpet and it turned upright and started to spin around. Its low, characteristic buzz soothed Draco a bit. He snapped his fingers and the Quick-Quotes Quill sprang to life, tip on the parchment and ready for his next notes.
Draco places his hand on Harry’s. On the table, where everyone can see. And Harry’s certain everyone around the table has their eyes fixed on their joined hands, but Draco is only looking at him.
Draco took a deep steadying breath. Some good could still come out of this encounter, and he knew how to turn a situation to his advantage. He hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin for nothing, after all.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He gazed at Draco, fond and bashful. “Do you—does it bother you? That we fucked here, after your work was done?”
So seeing Malfoy again — in the middle of the Ministry cafeteria, no less — was a strange kind of shock. Less strange than seeing him bent over in a room full of weirdly attentive women, of course, but Harry was curious.
“Yeah,” he concedes. It’s not like he intended to hide what transpired between him and Draco from his best friends, but — it’s still so new and raw, and there’s still so much he’s struggling to unravel, still so many feelings battling for dominance in his head. Guilt. Desire. Affection. Curiosity. It looks like he’s going to have to explain this to Ron and Hermione, though he wishes he could have kept everything to himself for just a while longer. He glances at Ron. “You’re not going to be happy about it.”
“You never do anything half-heartedly, do you?” Pansy muses from behind her glass of wine. No one can tell if she’s talking about Draco or Hermione.
Hand on his mouth, Harry stifled a laugh. “If I’d known you were this bad at flirting, I would have done this instead of challenging you with duels and fights all these years.”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. Draco watched the bob of his Adam’s apple with some satisfaction. So much for not wanting to upset him.
“Discards for the Lost and Found!” the delivery man says, and drops the bulky cardboard box on the desk of Harry’s intern. Wilson looks up at Harry, waiting for his instruction. Delivering the evidence box to the DLF has been one of his tasks since the beginning of his internship, but he still awaits orders with bated breath every time something new comes in. Harry doesn’t know if Wilson will make the best or the worst Auror, some day.
“Maybe it’s for the best, yes,” Draco tells her, not looking away from Potter. Who keeps staring, abashed but unrelenting.
Harry nearly chokes on his saliva. He coughs gracelessly, and Malfoy laughs. “I’d be happy to oblige.”
He nodded towards the trapdoor, and Malfoy gripped his wand in his fist, his face shining with excitement.
The grand ballroom of the Wizarding Chamber of Commerce shines bright tonight. As bright as the rows of diamonds glittering around the necks of the pretentious old bags waltzing around with their richly-dressed — and equally old — husbands. Well, not all of them are old: here and there, Harry can spot younger, perkier replacements, rivers of pearls gleaming across bouncy cleavages that leave little to the imagination. Among the crowd of benefactors, Harry spots a few journalists here and there. The page six columnist of the
Harry chuckled. “It’s true, but you know which one I’m talking about. Nobody likes to be reminded of their lack of experience when it comes to love.”
Harry takes a breath. This is the part where his made-up profession and motivation come in, and he hopes he can sound convincing.
Harry was already there, buttering a piece of toast. He lifted his head when he heard Draco come in.
family, regardless of whether they’re related by blood. He supposes even someone like Malfoy has best friends. And, knowing him a little bit better, he’s not as surprised as he might have been a week ago.
Draco still thinks of the summer before sixth year as the time when shit really hit the fan for him. He didn’t owl Pansy at all during the summer holidays. He couldn’t. He just couldn’t. The Dark Mark was still burning under his skin like a cattle brand. He was too afraid of her reaction when she’d find out he’d been Marked; he was too afraid for her to be associated with him in that way.
Draco pushes a breath out, and then his hands are in Potter’s hair, pulling his face closer, and he’s kissing him. He’s kissing Harry Fucking Potter. That is an experience in itself. Harry’s hands are on the small of Draco’s back, bringing their hips closer, pulling his body flush against his, and at the same time he’s crowding Draco against the door — Draco’s head hits the wood with a dull thud that he registers in the back of his mind, a mild inconvenience in a sea of wonder.
After, the others had scattered: Granger had said she needed to stop by the post office to see if they could deliver the Muggle order form she had filled the previous day. The other boys had made a go for the Three Broomsticks. Harry had asked Draco if he would help him shop for Christmas presents. Draco had said yes. Not because he was truly excited by the prospective of going from shop to shop, but because he was a hopeless fool. Any excuse to spend time alone with Harry was valid.
Draco slides him a glance then claps him on the shoulder. It doesn't feel friendly. It feels… almost sarcastic.
With a growl that sounded barely human, Draco closed the gap between them and kissed him again, furious and possessive. He pressed his body flush against Harry’s, trapping him against the island. Harry let out a sigh that sounded entirely too delighted.
“Still not sure how I was meant to know you were allergic to raspberry jam,” Harry grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest, and doing an uncanny impression of a grumpy Teddy to Draco’s mind.
“I wanted to be an Auror too!” Harry exclaims. He’s so utterly, inexplicably charmed by Malfoy’s revelation that he doesn’t notice the way Malfoy’s expression darkens.
I wanted to thank you all for your lovely, amazing comments!! They make me smile and laugh and even tear up at times, you guys are the best.
“We just kissed,” Draco admitted in the silence between the deserted row of bookshelves. “It was just a kiss. Well.
Harry just gapes at him, unable to choose between offense and apology. That seems to irritate Malfoy even more. With a roll of his eyes — the mean kind, not the fond one he’s given Harry in the recent past — he sets the book on the coffee table and pushes up to his feet.
Harry shrugged and resumed walking, lengthening his stride to catch up with Malfoy without making it look like he had strayed behind.
And if he wants this so much… more than he’s ever wanted any other sexual experience… then it means he’s definitely not straight, right?
Without breaking eye contact, Draco leaned to the side and grabbed the object of Jeff’s longing glances. The Niffler’s face fell slightly as he did.
“You owe me, Hermione,” Ron mumbles, taking a big gulp of wine and wiping his forehead with a paper napkin. “You owe me big time.”
Just then, her snores stuttered and she opened her mouth in a yawn, emitting an almost bird-like trill, her tail flicking upwards and away from her eyes which remained tightly closed. Draco’s own eyes widened and he realised he was holding his breath.
“I’m not going to—” Harry throws his hands up. “God, Draco. This is crucial information! It’s enough to prove you haven’t committed some horrible action to get to where you are today! It’s enough to close the case!”
His fists clench. Most days, he likes the job he’s chosen for himself. He likes the freedom, he likes the feeling of working towards something good, something bigger than him. He likes following in the footsteps of the people who shaped his view of the world, back when he was just a kid.
Draco pulled the soft, rounded flesh apart with his thumbs, whispering a gentle cleaning spell. Harry’s entrance was furled and dark pink, twitching at the sudden exposure. Draco brought his lips to it and kissed—a wet, open-mouthed, sucking kiss that made Harry cry out above him.
Harry had seen the forums. These lunatics believed the mountain hid a labyrinthine net of corridors and caves, like a giant ant hill for them to take refuge in while the rest of the world burned. It was easy to dismiss them as a bunch of sweet loonies, until they started disappearing. Not just them, but all the other loonies—Muggle and magic folk alike—who had followed them to Ben Macdui. Muggle families reported that their relatives weren’t answering mobile phone calls; wizarding families said their owls returned after failing to reach them.
“No, Harry, that was a joke.” At Harry’s blank expression, Malfoy gives his head an amused shake. “Look at you. I never imagined you as the high-strung type. You can ask me personal questions sometimes. I don’t bite.”
around them. Draco felt the tingling wave of magic surround him. All of the sudden, the atmosphere was as warm and cosy as if they'd been sitting directly by the fire. Draco remembered finding Harry by the fireplace yesterday.
It doesn’t help that so little has changed since the war; that same bloody fountain, the same whooshing sounds of Ministry employees coming in and out of the Floo, those same claustrophobic lifts that he avoids whenever possible. He prefers the exertion of walking several flights of stairs to the dreadful memories that the creaky lifts never fail to trigger.
Would you please make your next bet something along the lines of ‘Potter cannot come down to the Forensics lab for at least a WEEK,’ because this just won’t stand.
“I’m going to suck you off,” Draco said quietly. It didn’t really need to be stated. He still loved the sound of the words coming from his mouth, dirty, filthy, grown-up. The opposite of
He steps into the dining room, pushing a hand through his wet, messy curls, hoping last night’s activities aren’t too obvious on his ridiculously contented face, when movement across the room makes him stop short. Instinctively, he holds his breath, draws his wand and points it—
“Shh, shh.” Harry cooed, bringing his hands up to take a firm hold of the meat of Draco’s slim thighs, easily muscling them open again as Harry pulled his head back slightly, his dark gaze flicking over the overwhelmed, disbelieving look on his mate’s face, and then back down to stare at his cunt.
He and his mother had moved to one of the Black family’s properties outside of Paris, and as part of his parole, Draco was charged to enroll in one of France’s Muggle-Education-Bridging-Programmes, while simultaneously re-writing his N.E.W.T.S by correspondence through Beauxbatons.
Draco was gasping now, chest heaving, his whole body taut and flexing against the rope holding him still.
Potter growled, digging his face in further, nose tight along his crack, beard hairs bristling over the sensitive skin there. He was sucking at Draco’s hole again, greedy and obscene, as though he’d never had another meal, as though he’d never eat again.
Sighing as he finally pulled his hands away, Draco lay back for a moment, just allowing himself to breathe, his legs pleasantly tingling with the force of his orgasm.
Draco blinked at her, then at Harry, and then flushed, looking back at Hermione with disbelief in his eyes.
Draco burst into happy laughter, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders, and Harry couldn’t help but kiss his sweetly smiling face.
In the end, he was too caught up in staring at Malfoy to make a decision. The absolute tosser apparently had another, previously unseen side to his muggle wardrobe.
Harry accepted it with the appropriate level of awe, his mouth parted slightly. “Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy.”
‘Also, if you could please let Pansy know that I am still alive, as I was supposed to check in with her this morning. I am certain she has been in touch with various authorities to begin a search for me. I was also forced to leave my rented boat and the collected Thistles out on the water, so if you could direct her to please collect that for me. Sorry for the bother.”
Harry had tasted his mate again, licking between his legs, sucking cum from Draco’s cock and lapping up slick from his cunt. Draco had enjoyed a careful blowjob with Harry’s dangerous mouth wrapped around his prick just as much as Harry had guessed he would.
Draco watched, keen eyed and trying to be as thorough as possible in his observations (for future Pensive use), as Potter shoved himself back into his clothing.
Sucking marks against the skin of his thigh between the frame made by the rope holding him open, Potter got his hand on Draco’s flaccid cock.
Beckett had become a guide of sorts to what had quickly become one of Harry’s favourite secret societies: the BDSM and fetish lifestyle.
“Well, sometimes I’m a bit... more wolfy, than normal.” Harry admitted, hedging. “I’ve never been exactly typical for a werewolf. But I’ve never bitten anyone, and definitely never knotted anyone.”
“Better?” Harry asked, trailing his hand under the blanket to cup over the swell of Draco’s belly again, possessiveness still urging him to continue to touch his mate.
“I think you’ll prefer this, anyway. I want you to fuck my mouth, baby.” Harry crooned, pulling back just slightly to stare up at his mate’s flush face. “No need to be careful of my sharp teeth.”
“Sure thing, lad.” Beckett agreed, but pursed his lips. “And it looks as though you’ve finally trimmed yer beard. Couldn’t be bothered with the hair, though?”
Lips pulling back from his teeth, Potter nearly snarled at him, his body radiating heat as it pressed up against Draco, making him feel flush and weak at the knees to feel all of that hard muscle and sharp magical energy.
Draco rolled his eyes, huffing. “We’re going straight to St. Mungo’s then. I can only assume something completely baffling will happen to me, knowing your track record. Should’ve known better, really.”
They were both too headstrong, both wanting to take the lead; Ginny, having had more experience from previous dating, and Harry, naturally wanting to take control over any given situation, especially after the War. And then there had been the moment that Ginny had seen his cock - the look of shocked surprise, and then trepidation, and then finally, the absolute failure of Harry to even fit inside of her.
Draco was positively glowing lately, and his hair looked like burnished silver in the light of the setting sun. His cheeks had filled out slightly, his whole body slightly more plump, his stomach swollen to the point that he looked ready to give birth any day now.
“And a massage.” Draco couldn’t help but point out. “But seriously Potter. You’re... you don’t - you’re fine with.” He stopped, biting his lip. “All this?”
“I can manage both at the same time, you know.” Harry teased, grinning lecherously at him before settling down on his stomach between Draco’s legs, eyes fixed on the still lax hole peeking from between Draco’s bruised cheeks.
“Ugh, whatever.” Draco huffed. “It’s not like I haven’t spent ages testing out my Polyjuice variants. I think I’m pretty well accustomed to having all sorts of different anatomical configurations. It will be worth it regardless, to get my hands on the Mermaid’s Thistle.”
His normally lean and flat pecs were just slightly more full, the flesh swelling up from his chest in a plump curve, ending at the peak of his tight, pink nipples.
Hermione was much more thorough this time in her diagnostic spells on Draco, humming and sticking a tongue out as she worked.
“Of course.” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “And I should mention that I... may have taken immature gillyweed, last night, so I have... different bits.”
“Draco is a creature who prefers the finer things in life, Mr. Potter. He deserves the world, as you so eloquently put. He has worked hard to overcome the struggles of his past, and was just blossoming into the flower of his youth. He runs his own department, is at the forefront of his field, and commands the admiration of professionals across the world. He has been accepted back into society.
Malfoy huffed a laugh, running a hand through his hair and ruffling it into a slightly disheveled state. He was beginning to look more and more desperate.
As he was a rising star in the criminal law space, Malfoy was warranted his own office, but being as he was still
The cool air felt fantastic against his bare skin, and it was only a thin amount of restraint that stopped him from stripping completely and running starkers into the woods behind his house.
Potter was sprawled out at a table, mirth turning the corner of his lips up in a smirk as he watched Weasley talk. And then he looked over as Draco and Pansy entered, and Draco felt like his heart would stop.
Done with it all, Harry had eventually elected to try the more anonymous route in Muggle London. It was there, over the last 5 years, and with the help of Beckett, that he had finally found an outlet; a place where he could let loose, and feel comfortable in his own skin.
Harry dripped slick the whole time, eagerly pumping it into his mate to get him wet and dripping with it, letting his clasper swell and swell and swell until the base of it was nearly as big as his ovipositor, needing to stretch his mate’s tight opening.
All of their main territories were mapped, and there weren’t any known territories in this region, so realistically he had nothing to worry about.
The sight of his mate with a child on his hip, his gentle smiling and soft words. Draco was wonderful with her, and both Ron and Hermione kept shooting him knowing looks.
Malfoy turned to look expectantly at Beckett, who hadn’t quite managed to sit back down yet, and was staring between Harry and Malfoy like he was watching a tennis match.
Blood continued to bloom in the water, and Draco often had to stop to cast minor healing charms on the little lacerations on his fingers and palms.
With that thought motivating him, Draco sat up and pushed off the ground below him, gliding back up through the water.
“Hello there, little one.” Came a low, rumbling voice right next to Draco’s ear. A nose trailed up along the back of his neck, nuzzling into his hair. “You smell so
He was buzzing with nerves as he cleaned up their dishes, having helped ease Draco down into his favourite spot on the couch, covering him with a soft cashmere blanket that Pansy had sent him recently via owl post with her latest letter to Draco.
Molly pulled him into a furious hug, and Harry felt tears well in his eyes at the familiar sight and scent of her. He buried his face in her red hair, just breathing for a moment.
The Wizengamot had been lenient, ridiculously lenient really, during his sentencing. Draco had spent months in Azkaban awaiting his trial - the Dementors gone, but the prison itself having left Draco a shell of himself.
All in all, the wizard had been giving him a worried look as Draco cast off from the dock, clearly unimpressed with Draco’s sea-faring abilities, but happy enough to take his Galleons, with an extra-large security deposit.
Silvery grey eyes widened, and Draco’s mouth dropped open as Harry opened the palm of his hand, holding it up towards his mate, who stared down at the two rings there, one silver and red, the other gold and green.
Draco moaned around his tongue as they kissed again, and Harry grinned at the feeling of his mate’s little cock rutting against his own wet cocksheath. Harry’s own larger cocks were already almost all the way out, his clasper slick and eager, wrapping Draco’s prick tight in it’s hold.
, but Harry had slowly stopped even attempting to fuck anyone after he had had to suffer through watching them wince and gasp in pain, even after extensive prep and liberal use of lubricating spells.
“Yes, yes, of course. I’d love to marry your son.” Harry jumped in, nodding eagerly. He hadn’t thought of it to be honest, as in his mind, they were already mated, their bond consummated under the full moon. But that was a mermaid rite, and the idea of a wizarding marriage appealed to him greatly. A muggle one as well, now that he thought of it.
“P-potter, you’re absolutely filthy -” Malfoy moaned, chest still heaving, his legs squeezing tight together, hand pressing down to grind the heel of his palm against his cock.
The Herbology Professor nodded eagerly. “I look forward to it. I hope you have a great trip, Draco - and watch out for any mermaids; they’re very territorial!”
Draco’s hands clenched where they held his own thighs open, his head tossed back as he moaned and gasped, his breathing a desperate panting with each swipe of Harry’s thumb over his clit.
Finally, the man pulled back, his lips as red and wet as ever as he grinned up at Draco, who could barely keep his eyes open, his whole body shuddering with the aftershocks.
looked at Draco like he was a moment away from attacking him - those intense green eyes full of an animal magnetism of sorts.
Goose pimples broke out over his moonlit skin, his nipples pebbling, tightening into hard little buds at the cold, and he bit his lip, already worried about having to adjust to the water.
“I am.” Harry confirmed, but still didn’t clarify on what Malfoy was obviously looking to hear. “But I’ll make sure to take my time to prep you, don’t worry.”
His mate looked good, comfortable and swollen and tucked up on the couch, a book resting on the bump of his belly.
“R-right. About that - “ Draco said, sounding hesitant, yet still breathy. “We really ought to talk about... about what h-happened. Can you stop that!”
What followed was a surprisingly methodical and calm process. Potter easily and confidently bound his forearms tight together, always careful and checking to ensure that the rope wasn’t too tight.
Draco was sobbing again, desperate, his hole spasming around Harry’s massive, heavy cock, the muscle fluttering as he came and gasped, trying to milk out the come he wanted so bad.
Perhaps there was something on the boat he could transfigure... Maybe even two somethings - one for his desperate cunt, and one for his neglected arse.
Harry spent the rest of the afternoon cuddling his mate, who was still somewhat pensive and melancholy after their visit from Hermione and their subsequent discussion, though overall Draco seemed to have thawed out a bit from his icy anger.
“Potter...” Draco’s eyes flicked up to meet Harry’s concerned expression, his pupils blown, eyes hungry. “Is your cock... has your cock always been that... that
The eggs in Draco’s stomach wouldn’t ever become viable in the inhospitable environment, and would end up being used as supplementary nutrients for the rest of the clutch and Draco himself. His mate needed to eat only sparingly, to keep up his broader nutritional needs and to sate his cravings.
“Still an awful lot of talk, Potter.” He breathed, aiming a saucy look at the taller man, hoping to egg him on, desperate for it; desperate for anything that Potter could give him.
, it feels so good. They-they’re rubbing all over my sweet spots. Oh, I - I won’t be able to last -”
Though it made Harry just as wild to see the blond wrapped from head to toe in well-tailored but draping robes with swaths of fabric covering him, Harry still hadn’t gotten over Malfoy’s new
“Indeed.” Draco agreed, taking another sip of his tea. “Quite unexpected, to say the least. I was hoping
Draco felt himself teetering on the edge of a thought, his vision tunneling, his eyes fixed on the chart in the Healer’s hands. He barely heard Harry making noises resembling questions behind him.
“You’d have to ask me nicely for that, Malfoy.” Harry replied, leaning back in his seat, ready to take back the upperhand.
Harry felt his throat go tight. He didn’t remember anything about his family, but he had been told his parents had been killed. He felt an emptiness within him, and only Draco and their yet unborn child were managing to make him feel whole again.
Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, hands gripping the armrest of his chair so hard that the wood creaked. He took in a few deep, steadying breaths, and tried to get himself under control. He was a dom here, he was in control; absolute, complete, control.
Harry swallowed eagerly around Draco’s cock as the other man began to pump in and out of his watering, hungry mouth. One hand was wrapped around the base of Draco’s prick, angling it down slightly so that Harry could get his mouth around it without needing to worry about his mate’s swollen belly being in the way. His other hand had a firm grip on Draco’s hips, trying to steady the other man, careful and supportive as Draco began to rut faster, desperate and uncontrolled, into Harry’s mouth.
As soon as they reached a quiet alley beside the club, Draco slipped an arm through Harry’s, waiting expectantly for him to apparate them, and they were off.
“We had Bill come down to try to break the curse, but he said he couldn’t figure it out. Ron and I tried asking Harry about the curse, trying to pry out any clues we could on how to break it, but Harry just... can’t answer. He always talks around it, like it’s not there. The only things we’ve been able to understand that might be the answer is that... well.
“Is that what you want, sweetheart? You want me to get you nice and strapped down, plugged up with my thick cock, and stuffed with come until you’re nice and full? Want me to give you my heir?”
Potter stared at him like he was a feast, eyes mapping over all of his exposed flesh, but most often caught and stuck on his cock, which was almost painfully hard, pressed up against the flat of his belly, needy and dripping.
Potter didn’t stop, the width of his hand now pressed inside of Draco, snarling and growling as he tucked in his thumb, as well.
“I -” Harry paused at this, his instincts warring inside of him. “M-maybe after... after the birth. I just need... I need him to be safe. To be sure no one will hurt him.”
“Perhaps I was always meant for another path?” Harry teased. “Did you have any more hard limits, or anything else I should avoid?”
Harry smirked at him, bringing a hand down to curl around the base of his thick and heavy cock, pumping it twice, eyes still locked on Draco’s even as the other man trailed his gaze back down. “As far as I know.”
Nothing riled him up more than being in an enclosed space with a bunch of people arguing about budget cuts and procedure overhauls. Especially when Undersecretary Priscilla Babcock kept wearing that ghastly perfume that set his nose twitching. Or when fellow Auror Anthony Goldstein repeatedly proved that he had no self-control, smelling constantly aroused while staring fixatedly at Harry every time they were in the same room, making the hairs rise on the back of his neck and his teeth ache as he tried to rein in the impulse to snarl at the man.
Harry propped himself up on his elbow, and gazed down at the figure laying asleep beside him, at the man’s platinum blond hair and pale skin, so radiant in the sun’s light.
“Of course I’d fuck you.” Harry admitted with a laugh. “I’d be hard pressed to find a single man or woman in all of England who wouldn’t. No, it’s not
Draco went limp as he felt Harry stilling inside of him, that massive cock throbbing, thick and twitching, lodged deep. There was a splash of heat, deep,
Harry was groaning constantly now, and had fairly collapsed on top of him, rutting in a thunderous rhythm, hips busily working his cock in and out of Draco’s tight heat in a furious rush.
“Just my luck then.” Harry grinned crookedly, knowing that Beckett and he shared a lot of similar features - the other man was a fair bit paler than Harry, but of a similar build at just over 6 feet with broad shoulders, though Beckett was also a bit thicker in the stomach - definitely a daddy dom if there ever was one, coupled with the greying hair at his temples and in his thick beard. “Why aren’t you keeping him for yourself?”
Harry was standing in the middle of Draco’s bedroom now, torn between exasperation and laughter. “Is this how Ron and Hermione ended up with an invitation to your small, subdued, friends-only dinner party?”
Night has fallen, but Harry only turns the light above the cooker hood on. The small lamp bathes the kitchen in a warm, low glow, the edges of the world blending in the dimness.
Life in the years after the war served to clear Draco’s head of any remaining fantasies of green eyes, lean, compact bodies and strong fingers twined in Draco’s hair; for which he was neither thankful nor resentful. He just didn’t think about Potter anymore, not in the obsessive, bitter way he used to.
Draco told her. Next to him, Harry was silently shaking with repressed laughter. Ignoring Draco's annoyed look, he gestured towards his parchment and quill and started writing.
“As though you didn’t look like an obnoxious little rugrat back then, Potter,” he replied. “Thank Merlin you grew into your looks.”
Oddly, it grounded Harry. He felt calmer for Malfoy’s agitation. The storm might be raging outside, but they were safe, here, together. For now.
When they leave, Harry kneels next to Scorpius, takes a look around the devastated study. He wipes the blood off his face with a dirty sleeve. He’s alone in a big, empty house, with a catatonic child and an unconscious dog. He’s certain the loud ringing in his skull can only mean one thing.
He’s not supposed to have slowly become Harry’s friend. He’s not supposed to be someone Harry is starting to have feelings for, he who hasn’t felt that way for anyone in years.
And that his fascination with Malfoy, recently exacerbated, possibly carries an undercurrent of… something more personal, something that’s always simmered between them, something that says more about Harry than he’s been ready to acknowledge until now.
“I know,” Harry repeats. “I can wait for him—” he gestures in the direction of the parlour, drops his hand at Ernestina’s raised brow, “—or I can come back later.”
“It’s alright.” Draco unrolled his scroll of parchment, nudging Harry to do the same. Slughorn had begun his rounds around the classroom. He dictated today’s lesson, still blissfully oblivious of Draco and Harry’s whispered conversation. “I was wondering why you were taking Advanced Professional Potions this year if it wasn’t part of your career plan.”
He stands in the middle of his office, hands in his hair, breathing hard. Now, why was he looking for a box of quills again…? Ah, yes. Draco slides his hands down his neck, shakes himself out of the emotions swirling in his head. He’d broken the tip of his quill and needed it for —
“Daddy,” Scorpius says again, and without waiting for Harry to respond, breaks into a run towards Draco’s study.
In the pale light, Draco’s skin is flushed prettily, the sharp planes of his face seem softer, his cool eyes almost tender. There’s a hint of stubble across his jaw, and Harry is filled with the urge to press his lips to it before his heart jumps at the realisation. He shifts his eyes away from Draco’s face under the pretense of looking at the boxes laid open on the floor, his eyes trailing along Draco’s shoulder, the curve of his biceps through the sleeves of his rolled-up shirt…
“Exactly. We don’t have long.” He teased the buckle of his belt. “Or have you changed your mind, Malfoy?”
they weren’t getting enough sleep. Certainly, sex was to blame; Harry slept in Draco’s bed every night now, no questions asked, and Draco let Harry fuck him with helpless abandon, hands in Harry's hair, murmuring his name like he couldn’t get enough. Like he didn’t know how much longer he’d have Harry for himself. Harry had told him about Kingsley’s ultimatum — the reason that really kept them awake at night. Getting Hermione on board and putting her ruthlessly powerful mind to work along with theirs had been one of their best ideas. She’d taken on their deadlock like it was a puzzle to solve, like it didn’t carry the same weight of personal crisis it did for Harry and Draco. She’d meet with them at Draco’s townhouse at the end of her work day and force them to go over their options over and over again. Ron would tag along occasionally, sometimes bringing little Rosie and Hugo with him. Hugo’s Nesting pushchair would sit in the foyer, like it was defying Harry to find a solution. Rose had eyed Scorpius curiously the first few times, unable to decide if the quiet, unsmiling boy was worth making friends with. Until one evening Scorpius was sat in front of the grand piano to play a mazurka for her. She’d whispered,
He’d opened up to Malfoy. He’d let Malfoy get to his knees for him. He’d taken Malfoy’s face in his hands and kissed him like one would kiss a lover. He’d gone after Malfoy and showed him his hand — showed him his hand like a lovesick fool.
“Yes,” Draco tried. Two could play the flirting game. “I wanted to see you, maybe take you for a walk up to the Astronomy Tower again...” He searched frantically for the next bit, face heating. “...maybe, er, pick up things where we left them?”
Harry had told him, his green eyes wide, dismayed and earnest, and Draco, weak as he was, had believed him. Had
Draco leans back in his chair and shakes his fringe out of his eyes, arms crossed and rings shining against his white shirt, which is still unbuttoned at the neck. He returns Harry’s disconcerting stare, defiant, challenging. Let Potter think of him whatever he pleases.
“... for the best supply of Valkyrie hair, the meticulous witch or wizard should travel to the forests of Bavaria, where quality raw material can be found...”
“That would be lovely, but I had other ideas in mind.” Malfoy’s words would have been painfully casual if he hadn’t sounded so devastated. He turned, pushing his naked arse flush against Harry’s groin. All the air left Harry’s lungs.
“What have you got there?” Harry asked, pointing at the books Draco was holding. His cheeks were still pink and his eyes seemed huge, almost unnaturally green in the firelight. Draco held out the books for him to see. Harry read the titles out loud.
They stare at each other, Harry looking for any sign that Draco might be lying — hiding something from him. He doesn’t find it. He never expected to.
“I’m still not sold on the ‘Bend and Snap’ trick,” Parvati muses from her desk once the quiet has returned. She Summons the pot of coffee and pours herself a fourth serving. “There aren’t any good men left in England for us to pull, anyway.”
“Thank you. I wish I could say it was my idea, but I’ve read about it in a book. Mind you, it was a footnote, but—”
“And this is Scorpius,” Malfoy drawls, and Harry doesn’t miss the note of pride in his voice. “Scorpius, this is Harry Potter.”
Potter’s mouth snapped shut. He blinked. He was still close enough for the collar-grabbing Draco envisaged. Close enough to punch. Close enough to kiss…
“Oi!” Ginny threw a dessert spoon at her brother from across the table with the skilful aim of a Chaser. It hit Ron square on the forehead. Draco could finally admit he’d always found her a bit intimidating. “Harry didn’t
“Let me finish, ‘Mione! I wanted to say, I haven’t seen Harry like this... haven’t seen him like this in ages.”
— a grey hydrangea. The room is minimalistic but bright and warm. There is no trace of its previous occupant, to Harry’s relief. The place looks both lived-in and completely blank, the perfect combination for someone to adopt it, to feel instantly at home in.
Hermione had spent nights reviewing all the wizarding law books she owned as well as the impressive collection at Draco’s house. She’d said wizarding laws regarding house-elves had evolved slightly since the war but remained full of loopholes. Magical folk still couldn’t be bothered thinking of house-elves like real people, she had ranted, her brow furrowing in a furious frown. Harry had half-expected her to take her old SPEW badges out of whatever box she’d put them away in and start wearing them again.
“Scorpius is a clever, brilliant, endearing child,” Malfoy snaps. “And yes. It goes without saying that getting on with him and treating him with respect are requirements for the job, even more so than everything else.”
Harry jumped as if burned, frantically looking around. Draco’s stomach dropped. For the second day in a row, he had unwittingly initiated a conversation with Harry. For the first time in his life, he’d have given anything for the Snitch to get lost into the Forbidden Forest, get swallowed by a bloody Thestral for all he cared, if it meant he could continue to talk to Harry.
“Yes, Draco, show us how to pull hotties,” Parvati huffs without pausing in her task, and turns another lost object into a Ministry form.
Scorpius gives Harry a long-suffering look, like he can’t believe how forgetful Harry is, and launches into a detailed enumeration of his plans for the evening. They’re always the same, always in the same order: first, cuddling with Balzac in the foyer, going upstairs for his bath, putting on his pyjamas, coming back downstairs to work on his piano piece until supper, then going to sleep after a story that Draco usually reads him when he’s home. Harry knows the schedule by heart, of course. But he sees the way Scorpius relaxes when he lists everything, so he asks him all the same. For Scorpius, it’s all about knowing what to expect, and knowing he will be surrounded by the people he cares about — his father, his nanny, his dog. Harry’s grateful that he somehow also became part of the little boy’s routine.
Draco Malfoy is photographed walking out of the building, the large silhouette of another man looming over him as he opens the door of a sleek black car parked a few feet away. The scene lasts for all but two seconds before the photograph loops back to Malfoy walking out of the building again.
Turning another coat rack, he finds a man with his hands deep inside the pockets of a mink coat. A mink coat that is decidedly a woman’s, and decidedly not his.
Potter took a swig of his champagne. “Still. ‘S nice to be asked sometimes,” he muttered into his glass. The words were petulant, but Draco thought he could hear something else under them. Something vulnerable. His Potter-sense stood to attention.
“Shove off yourself, Potter,” Draco outright laughs and puts a hand on Harry’s chest, pushing lightly.
He stops. There’s only a foot of distance between them. When Draco releases the breath stuck in his lungs, it kicks back in quicker, faster, like he’s been running instead of standing there, watching Potter close the distance between them.
Mere feet from the ground, Harry’s fist closed around the Snitch, and Draco heard the mixed cries of “Alright! Harry!” and “Malfoy, I’m going to catch you and
“I think Ron would like this one,” Harry said, sticking his nose to the shop’s window like a little child. “He left his favourite chess set at Hogwarts at the end of Sixth Year. He says it’s lost now.”
Harry studies him while pretending to be absorbed in the swirling patterns of steam rising from his mug.
“You know I’m not, Draco,” Greg tells him, his deep, rumbling voice soft as always. When he speaks, his lips barely move. It’s always been that way. Draco was one of the few people who could understand Greg’s poorly articulated words. He knows that to almost everyone else, it accentuated the impression of Greg being slightly dim; someone who’s only good enough to play one of Draco’s cronies.
“Don’t let Filch find him or your new pet is gone,” Dean Thomas said, moving towards the lit up Entrance Gate.
“That’s because you trust me, and I trust you. That’s the kind of person you need to find,” Greg tells him, his earnest eyes trained on Draco’s.
“Besides,” he continued, willing the flush to go away, “it was over ten years ago. Water under the bridge, and all that.”
“But…” Harry’s insides go cold with the thought, “...they could still find you. They could still try to silence you somehow. None of them know what you do… right?”
“Books and quills... this might be a bit too obvious. I bet half of Hermione’s trunk is packed with those already.”
, if Draco remembered correctly. He’d sat in these lessons so many times, in so many of his past lives, the curriculum was seared in his brain.
He walks to the desk. Zacharias Smith’s certificate is still there, slightly crumpled, the ink smeared with sweat. The feeling of being inside Draco only a few minutes ago, of holding him while he came, of rocking him as he rode the last of his pleasure, is nothing but a distant memory.
“All the Christmas decor is a little too much for my taste,” Blaise eyed the large fir tree with a slight moue of distaste, “but if it makes all of you happy...”
Harry realised it as soon as he stood: there was an downside to being in a standing position that he hadn’t thought of. He brought a hand to his arse and squeezed his legs shut when copious amounts of come dripped out of him and along his thighs. Face heating, he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow the slow trickle of spunk down his legs. There was an almost imperceptible smirk on his lips, and Harry watched as Malfoy’s cock gave a hopeful lurch.
Harry pushed his leg between Malfoy’s thighs and kissed him. A long, deep, wet kiss, one that he hoped was the perfect preview to what he’d do to Malfoy in a minute… Malfoy who was rutting against Harry’s thigh with helpless little moans as Harry kissed him.
Harry watches her for a moment, mind whirring. She’s a free elf; she seems to think the enslavement of elves is a preposterous idea; her delightfully melodic accent reminds Harry that he still doesn’t know much about her.
One of the girls snorts in the background, but Draco’s attention is all on Potter: the pink on his cheekbones, the rise and fall of his chest under his pressed, crimson Auror shirt, the helpless movement of his Adam’s apple in his throat. Merlin, if only the annoying prat wasn’t so bloody gorgeous…
“Oh, no, no, no. None of this, Potter. I heard you. We’re going to die. Now spill it out. Is there someone? Who would you like to fill your—ah,
“Right,” Harry says, shoving his wand in his back pocket. It’s June fifth. Of course. He’s totally forgotten about the date and what it means. Great way to start a new relationship, surely. He works very hard not to fidget under the piercing blue gaze of Draco’s mother. “Sorry I pointed my wand at you.”
Dear Draco (yes, sorry, I just. I can’t keep with the charade. I’ve seen you, for Merlin’s sake. In the flesh. Across a table from me at Bel Canto, eating your dinner with manners worthy of a young prince. Your cheeks going pink with the wine and the warmth of the restaurant and the warmth of our conversation. Under the drizzle when we walked outside, your hair sticking to your forehead. Sprawled on my bed, naked, hungry, eager),
Harry had no scientific meteorological knowledge, but his instinct rarely lied. And now his instinct was screaming at him to find a place to hide from the upcoming downpour, or face the risk of being turned into a very dead, very Harry-Potter-shaped icicle within minutes.
“Yeah? Did you imagine it? You and me?” Harry asks, panting, rocking into his own fist and bringing Draco closer to the edge with each pump, each question. “Naked, fucking on your sofa like a pair of randy teenagers?”
“Forgive and forget much, Potter? I was a dumb teenager. Making fun of people about their tiniest flaws was a normal pastime.”
“I haven’t met anyone,” he says, trying hard to unclench his teeth and fists. “That’s not what it is.”
“We don’t have to,” he whispers, sliding his thumb across Draco’s cheekbone. “We don’t have to, Draco. I just wanted you to know.”
“I told you. She loves children. It’s her vocation. When Astoria and I found out we were going to be parents… not having Ernestina alongside us to raise our child was out of the question for all of us. Nesting is a well-rounded affair. We don’t need to be on site. We barely need to keep an eye on it, these days. My mother takes care of the finances, with the help of a Muggle accountant.”
Malfoy leans over Harry to turn the light off. “Maybe I’ll make you live up to that promise tomorrow morning, then,” he whispers.
For a fraction of second, Draco’s eyes travel down his face, down his neck. When he looks back up to meet Harry’s eyes, it’s shockingly intense.
moments. “Tell me,” he probed again with a mock-lascivious smile, “and I might let you have a closer look.”
“You offered to protect me, all these months ago,” Draco says quietly. “This is me protecting you back.”
“What?” Draco drops the form on his desk, but doesn’t sit. “Why am I getting you a receipt form? Other than the fact you’re incompetent and forgot to bring one with you?”
I am done exposing myself, worrying how every one of my words could be understood or interpreted. I need to do what is good for me. And I’d decided, years ago, that what was good for me was staying away from the media.”
Draco shook his head and pushed the thoughts away. He reached the end of the rink, gathered speed and successfully spun himself around. Lucifer, it felt so good. How could he have let other people dictate what he should or shouldn’t enjoy for so long? Who cared, really, if something was unfit of a Malfoy? Who cared if demons weren’t supposed to have this sort of easy fun? Nobody was watching Draco now, so why did it matter?
He looks up at the sound of the door opening, and stills when his eyes meet Harry’s. Harry stares back at him, his jaw hanging open.
I’m not asking you to spill Harry’s darkest secrets. He told me about what he wants to do. I just—” He faltered, unsure if he wanted to give that much away. He picked up his napkin and tore one of the corners, placing it neatly on the table as if laying his cards. “I just want to know what you think of them,” he added cautiously.
“If idiocy doesn’t kill, maybe there’s a chance we’ll come out of here alive,” Malfoy muttered, turning away. Still smiling. “That is, if we don’t kill each other first.”
“Harry.” There’s something in the Minister’s calm expression that makes Harry realise he knows the outcome of this discussion before it’s even finished. “You’re the only one we want on this case. You’re the only one who can crack Malfoy’s shell. And yes, your shared history, no matter how unpleasant, might make all the difference here. We believe Malfoy will be unable to resist the temptation to hire Harry Potter as his security detail, partly because of your reputation, and partly because, given your old antagonism, he might—well,
He braces himself for refusing the case—he’s never been one for financial fraud cases, and he supposes that’s what this one is—when his eyes fall on the next page in the folder.
Penelope isn’t the head of the Department of Magical Lost and Found (also known as DLF) for nothing. She took in all the lost kids, for one, and helped them find themselves. All the queer kids that didn’t know where they belonged after the war. We'
“Leggo of me, you HELLISH BEASTS, you pseudo-mythical MONSTERS, you self-important CRETINS, I have done nothing, NOTHING, I say leave me alone this instant!”
And just when he’s about to shut the door behind him, he hears that satisfied drawl, directed at his colleagues.
It seemed as though the Hogwarts staff had decided that the Christmas decor had to be truly over the top this year, as if to make up for the remainder of destruction still strewn across the castle and grounds. The gutted walls, the torn paintings and tapestries, the fallen trees and impact holes; stark reminders of the war remained everywhere one looked. Yet the trees were festooned with gold, the fairy lights glittered along the path, Hogwarts was all decked in resplendent colours. It all brought winter holidays to mind. Outside, everything was covered in a thick layer of fresh, crisp snow and scattered with illuminated trees. The landscape didn’t look like the battle scene it had been, only half a year ago. It looked like the Hogwarts Draco had always known and loved, mere days away from Christmas.
Two white-eyed ravens descended from the tree after Mephistopheles and perched on each of his shoulders. From inside the demon’s coat pocket, the pointy, twitching nose of a tiny creature emerged. It was a black Niffler whose beady little eyes fell on Draco’s signet ring instantly.
He’s noticed the way Harry’s eyes always scan the rooms they’re in. He’s listened to Ernestina telling him about Harry’s coming and going at odd times of the day.
But at least he intends to do something with all the money his parents and Sirius left him. He used to have that image in his head, of him sitting atop a pile of Galleons like the gold-hoarding dragon in
“Checking my Arithmancy calculations—” he started, but Granger had already extricated herself from her boyfriend’s arms and jumped down the sofa. Weasley protested at the loss but she didn’t seem to notice.
him to push and bite and take and claim. With one last lick across Harry’s swollen lips, he pulled back an inch.
And somehow this is Harry's fault. When Malfoy’s the one who left Harry without a word of explanation, left him alone to fret and second-guess himself and be deeply miserable for weeks.
“I need a special type of quill to sign the legal agreements for the Romania plant, but I can’t seem to find it,” he drawls. Despite his clear annoyance, he has a bored expression carefully in place. Harry knows it can only mean one thing: that Draco Malfoy’s been in this cupboard for far too long and is coming at his wit’s end.
“Yeah.” Harry smiles, and reaches up. He runs a knuckle down Malfoy’s cheek, and a little sound — half gasp, half moan — escapes Malfoy’s parted lips. He leans in just another inch, and he presses his body against Malfoy’s, feeling the heat through layers of clothes. “More specifically… I like you.”
Draco tugs at Harry’s belt and opens his eyes. Harry’s staring at him, heavy-lidded and slack-jawed, and when Draco undoes the buckle and pulls it open, he lets out a strangled, surprised little whine that goes straight to Draco’s cock. He pulls Harry’s jeans down and Harry wiggles to help, pushing down his boxers, letting his half-hard cock hang free as he bends to toe off his trainers and socks, stands again to roughly pull his t-shirt off.
“You know about the shelter? You did do your homework, Potter!” He heard Malfoy’s mocking voice behind him, muffled by the howling wind. “And here I thought you made it through five years in the Aurors by being the Chosen One and looking pretty!”
remains to be seen,” Malfoy snarls, and pushes at Harry’s fists, forcing him back. Harry staggers, one hand still wound into Malfoy’s collar, as his back meets the next row of cloaks. The hangers clink like wind chimes. Harry gropes at the coats for leverage. He’s surrounded by the thick, dry, muffled smell of a dozen winter cloaks, and pressing against his front, the scent of Malfoy. Pressed cotton and fresh laundry detergent and the lingering aroma of a masculine cologne. Malfoy’s breath is hot and fast against his face, and Harry feels his senses go taut with it.
“Welcome,” Harry said, leaning closer, the whole left side of his body touching Draco’s right. Draco put the almond in his mouth and watched Harry. The candle on their table gave off a soft halo of light, reflecting against his glasses and highlighting his dark hair.
Still smiling, Harry put his chin in his hand, elbow resting on the back of the sofa. Draco meticulously placed his books on the floor next to the sofa, wondering if somewhere in Harry's open, friendly attitude, there was a cue for him to leave. He came up short. Harry was giving no indication of wanting to be alone, so Draco stayed there, hands clasped in his lap, watching the fire. his mind was frantically wiring for something to say, for something to justify his presence here, so late at night.
“You’re not the boss of me, Potter,” Malfoy grumbled, until Harry’s hands found his arse and squeezed. “Who am I kidding,” he yelped. “Yes you are.” Laughing, Harry obliged by lifting his hips off the ground when Malfoy pulled his trousers and pants down in one motion.
One arm holding Draco up against the door, Harry unzipped Draco’s trousers and pulled them down with his pants. He closed his other fist around Draco’s cock and stroked him frantically, his jeans still bunched around his legs, his softening, wet cock brushing against the hairs on Draco’s thighs. Barely aware of anything save for Harry’s hot panting breaths on his face and Harry’s hand wanking him in time with them, Draco let his eyelids drop. Harry’s gaze was fixed on him and Draco forced himself to maintain eye contact. It was the most painfully intimate thing he’d ever experienced. He’d have averted his eyes, were he not drunk on Harry, taken over by the feel of him, by the love and the lust radiating from his body like the soft buzz of magic. Harry twisted his wrist and Draco stilled and came in a blaze of euphoric heat, his vision going white as he felt his come splatter the front of Harry's shirt and drip on his fist.
“Look at you. Dressed up all nice for once.” Beckett teased, his warm brown eyes crinkling up at the corners as he assessed the younger man. “I tell you I have a little surprise, and finally that makes you put in some effort?”
“Well, if you’re asking so very nicely.” Draco drawled, sliding a hand into Harry’s messy hair. “Who am I to deny a man on his knees.”
It was right where it was reported to be, in full bloom, the dark green tufts bobbing and billowing in the current as if on a breeze, the dark stalks long and hardy.
The blond made a plaintive noise, his eyes shutting as he pressed down against his cock even harder, “Potter, stop -”
“Nothing that immediately stands out, but I assure you, I will be quite vocal if you try anything untoward, Potter.”
“My apologies, Neville.” Draco said demurely, sliding his arm into the curve of Harry’s elbow. “Best listen to him though. No hugs at the moment, I’m afraid.”
“Still too sensitive, sweetheart?” Harry asked, his tone saccharinely sweet. “Or will you let me make you come some more? Let me work over your sweet cunt until you’re completely drenched with slick?”
, I’m - just not sure what the long-term plan entails, so nothing is set in stone right now. We’re making do -”
Draco gasped as Potter’s mouth came down on his, a hot tongue pressing immediately against his lips for entrance, which Draco granted with a ready, eager moan.
Swallowing, a soft pink tongue came out to run along Malfoy’s lower lip. He cast his eyes down, thinking.
Potter’s grin was positively feral as he pulled up and away from Draco’s chest, come dripping from his thick beard, his lips red and wet from their efforts.
Draco gasped, a pained whimper crossing his lips at the wrenching feeling that pooled in his stomach, making it clench.
Draco’s fine brows rose, a dangerous look rolling across his features as his eyes narrowed, mouth opening with what looked to be a biting retort.
Draco didn’t look ready to back down, however, and his expression only grew more incensed, his silver eyes narrowing. It was unfortunate, how lovely his mate looked when he was mad, because Harry really wanted to kiss him.
They had taken to floating in the calm water of the lagoon at night, gazing up at the stars. Draco was able to point out all of the constellations, and though Harry vaguely remembered some of them, he didn’t know them half as well as his mate did, and he couldn’t have imagined all of the fantastical stories Draco was able to tell.
Another finger entered him with a squelch, and it happened again. Draco screamed as he came, not from his cock, but from his hole.
Harry dropped to his knees, placing his hands on Draco’s slim hips. “Please, can I suck your cock now?” He begged, eyes wide with supplication as he stared up at his beautiful mate.
Malfoy looked relieved, and then smirked. “Of course Saint Potter could never bring himself to willingly hurt a poor, defenseless person. It would go against all of your holier than thou morals.”
“Harry, hurry up and come cuddle me. Your darling spawn have been draining my magic dry all evening. Hermione said they’re getting close, so we will be extra needy for the last stretch.”
By the time he reached Draco’s chest, the blond was already close to coming, so worked up from their earlier conversation, and then the ropes, and even the
draw for Harry towards a partner, the thing that he willingly ignored every other preference for, was their ability to take cock.
“Ah, ah, ah.” The mermaid chided, pulling his arm away, twisting his wrist out of Draco’s clawing grip easily. His skin was apparently thick, for Draco’s sharpened nails appeared to have no effect on the flesh. “Don’t worry little one, I promise not to hurt you, but you have to be good for me. You
Harry reached over and pulled the wand from his bedside table, slipping it into Draco’s waiting palm. He had really admired his mate’s thigh holster, and had enjoyed removing the leather straps from Draco when he’d brought the passed-out man to bed just after sunrise.
babies.” Draco cooed, his hands rubbing at where he had them cupped under their small forms. “They’re so
“I - I can feel them moving around inside of me.” Draco gasped between moans, one hand pressed tight against his stomach, the other clutched in a vice-like grip in Harry’s hair. “Oh
He gurgled, still coming, his hole clenching and squeezing around the cock inside of him, out of his mind with pleasure.
It had been a week since Harry had filled Draco with his clutch, and Hermione had advised, quietly just before she left, that two of Draco’s eggs looked ready to come out; no longer viable, and his body needing more space inside as the other eggs continued to grow.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him, remaining in his casual seated position as Malfoy uncrossed his long legs, looking like he was about to stand.
Harry moaned around his mouthful at Draco’s words, and his own cock ached painfully between his legs. His mate was so
“Harry...” Came a breathy voice above him, and Harry blinked up, lips still pressed in a kiss just above Draco’s bellybutton. His breath caught as he looked up into Draco’s bright silver eyes.
Draco shivered as that long tail drifted lazily up between his legs, the sheer thickness of the scaled flesh forcing him to straddle it with his thighs spread wide, immobilising him more. The scales were a dark green, peppered through with little flecks of black. Long, shimmery fins drifted gracefully around the tail, similar in colouring; so perfectly camouflaged that they seemed to disappear into the water around them.
“Thank you so much for coming so soon, Granger.” Draco said, polite and cordial, as though the woman had arrived just in time for tea. There was a hint of sarcasm in the man’s tone, and Harry felt amusement course through him at his mate’s cool attitude, his unflappable calm and humour in such a fraught situation.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open, and he stared down at Harry, his pupils so flared with desire that the silver of his irises were almost gone. He nodded slightly, but Harry frowned back at him.
Draco let out a happy noise as he settled back, and hummed appreciatively when Harry fairly wrapped himself around the smaller man, tucking into his side and covering both of their legs with the blankets again.
Draco sighed, for some reason looking put upon by the suggestion, and struggled to sit up better in the bed.
“You’ll need to stay here in the meantime, to attend to my needs. Might as well move in while the renos are underway regardless.” He continued, peeling off his leggings, and carefully magicking them to hang by his bedroom door, ready for the specialty cleaning they required.
Biting his lip and looking unsure, Draco allowed himself to be led into the small pool inside of the grotto, a space that had grown familiar over the last week, as he had joined Harry there nightly.
“I’m going to get you out of your clothes, and then I’m going to bring out my jute rope. I’m going to tie you up nice and tight so that you can’t move, and then I’m going to get to know all of the most sensitive spots on your body. I’m going to suck your cock until you come, and then I’m going to keep playing with your cock until you come again. Then, I’m going to finger you open, and play with your prostate until you come again. Then I’m going to eat you until you're dripping wet and begging for my cock. We’ll see if you can come just from being eaten out.” At this, Harry smirked at Malfoy, who looked both annoyed and flustered.
“Of course, your highness.” Harry demurred. “That was a pretty intense scene. I have some water here for you to drink, and some chocolate.”
Draco moaned as Potter began kissing his way down his neck, interspersing sharp nips and meaty bites with long, wet sucking against his pale skin, marking him up.
“You’re my mate, Draco. You came into my territory. You let me give you my mating bite. You let me breed you.” Harry reminded him. “You have my clutch, inside of you. My babies.
A grimace of a smile graced her lips, and she looked at him with a piercing gaze that made him feel like she was staring through him, breaking him down into his component parts, to better understand his puzzle.
Much of this had come about during the voluntary 8th year that had been offered for returning students, and Headmistress McGonagall’s push towards inter-house unity and cooperation.
Harry only just stopped himself from reaching down to squeeze his aching cock at that look, at how much Malfoy could take, but that wasn’t the only thing he wanted to know.
“Look at these pretty little tits.” Harry praised, cupping his big, tanned hands around the plump skin, his thumbs flicking over the perky, pink nubs of Draco’s nipples, already so hard and tight. “You’re going to swell up nice and full for me here as well, aren’t you baby? Gunna get nice and full of milk, and let me suck on them?”
Heading to his bedroom to try and scavenge for some clean clothes, Harry’s eyes caught on a familiar flashing light by his bedside: his muggle mobile phone.
Suddenly on edge, Draco pulled out his wand, and began the process of carefully harvesting some of the rare herb.
Draco stopped, and the egg sucked back completely inside, his hole tightening into a closed-up little furl, and Draco gasped, his hard cock oozing out a little burst of precum that Harry could taste in the water around them. Draco’s cunt was so slick already that it was dripping out around the plug.
Draco gasped, his voice thick with lust at Harry’s words, and his mate finally settled down further, tilting his hips and angling his arse up for Harry to play with.
With only the head of his cock still in Potter’s mouth, Draco was woefully under stimulated, but with the constant battery of that slick muscle against the very tip, Draco was helpless.
Potter huffed a laugh, leaning in to kiss him gently, tongue licking soothingly against his own for a moment, before letting Draco suck on it, moaning.
Draco went rigid, his heartbeat thundering, and he couldn’t stop himself from reaching up a hand to grab for his wand, which the mermaid still had pointed up under his chin.
A flare of white light burst through the room, and Harry felt incandescent with it. He was wrapped with warmth; with safety and happiness and hope and
He hissed as he pricked his finger against the thorns on the flower, having forgotten that aspect of the harvesting in his awe at his own transformation. A little bloom of blood flared around his finger, disappearing in moments.
Too bad the paps had managed to snap a shot of them, Potter pressing Draco up against the wall of a public quidditch pitch after they’d played a friendly seekers match one late summer afternoon.
“Ready to come again, sweetheart?” He asked, mouth hovering and breath hot between Draco’s legs, drawing in deep breaths through his nose as he scented along the crease of Draco’s thigh. “Ready to let me taste this sweet little cock next?”
Draco shivered, his cock hardening fully at the thought, twitching and leaking out a little pearl of precum, which Harry lapped up eagerly, grinning.
marks, little red crescent moons spread all across the smooth skin. He kissed at the deepest of them all, Harry’s mating mark, which was sunk deep into the muscle of Draco’s shoulder.
Draco reveled in how those green eyes looked at him, solely focused on him, on how to mark Draco further, on how to mold his limbs into exactly what he wanted.
Potter had eventually become a freelance Curse Breaker, and had given up on portraying any sort of image that might please society. Most of the jobs he took were outside of England, so it was months after Draco had returned home before he’d even had a chance to see the man again.
“Now then.” Hermione said briskly, taking out her own wand and ushering Draco to sit on one of the couches. “Let’s have a look at you, shall we?”
“I think you’re forgetting your place here, Malfoy.” Potter hissed, delivering another sharp slap to his other cheek. “You should be
Luna had warned Draco about Mermaids as well though, and had given him a special charm to wear (which he was indeed wearing, though it appeared to be a little conch shell on a string, which looked almost to have come from a novelty shop.) Neville had warned him before he left, and now this local wizard...
Without another word, Potter engulfed him in his mouth, the searing wet heat of it hitting Draco like a wall. He groaned, oversensitive from having just come, but desperate for it anyway.
When Hermione arrived a week later, this time with Ron in tow, she had a massive chest that she hovered behind her as she walked up the beach from the apparition point, Harry having let down the wards for only these two people who he already trusted.
When he finally arrived at Draco’s cock, he found it still half hard, and leered up at Draco with a hungry look in his eye.
“Of course.” Harry murmured behind him, pulling off his own white henley and throwing it to the floor. Draco frowned, and used his wand to whisk it into his laundry basket.
Draco closed his eyes, feeling nice and floaty and tingly, all of his limbs flush with sensitivity, his cock raw in a pleasant way.
The familiar sneer on Malfoy’s face almost transported him back to his hotheaded teenaged rage, but he managed to corral himself.
Draco watched, eyes half lidded and mouth open in a soft moan, as Potter began to tie his thighs to his calves, leaving him forced open in a frogtie, exposed.
He lay there for an eternity with Potter murmuring soft praises at him, sucking marks into his skin, holding his aching cock in a tight, punishing grip.
Harry though - he was still buoyed by his happiness. His mate had decided to stay with him. His mate, who was safe and healthy, and his clutch, safe and healthy inside of Draco.
“Was that good, sweetheart?” Harry asked, leaning down to press a chaste kiss against his mate's reddened, bitten lips. “Did you like getting stretched open by my eggs again?”
“Merlin, you’re so tight, milking me so good baby. You just keep coming on my cock, squeezing me over and over.” Harry murmured. “You that desperate for my come? Ready for me to breed this sweet cunt of yours?”
Soon enough, Potter was yanking the loosened corset over his head, tossing it carelessly to the ground as his blunt fingers went for the small, pearlescent buttons of Draco’s sheer white button-up.
Still sucking eagerly, Harry swallowed it down hungrily, his own cock leaking so much precum he thought he would burst just at the taste, at his mate’s little whimpers of overstimulation.
Draco keened, awash with sensation as another finger squeezed into him, taking up a brutal pace as he was finger-fucked, Potter still tonguing furtively around his hole where it opened up around his fingers, sucking and lapping, wetness positively dripping.
Something happened, something inside of him bursting; he wasn’t coming, his cock was wrung out, incapable of ekeing out any more.
. So, he took all of the pre-requisite courses during the summer when he’d turned 19, and then enrolled in
loved a pillow princess; he got off on not letting his partners lift a single finger, preferring to hold them down or tie them up or strap them to a breeding bench. All the better if they preferred to just lie there and take everything he would give them.
Moving into a flat in the heart of Paris with some Muggle roommates had pushed him well outside of his comfort zone, in all of the best ways.
Thank Merlin the man was also willing to provide Draco with a crash course on some of the major charms he would need to actually pilot the boat.
“Oh darling.” Narcissa said, her voice soft with something like sorrow. “Why didn’t you tell me? I want to be able to help. I can assist with looking for a new home - our vaults still have enough to afford you something nice, even if you decide not to come back to England for whatever reason. And perhaps I can move closer, to be with you to assist with the child -”
It was a very open space. There were very few rooms in the home, with the kitchen, dining room, and living room all flowing together into one big, bright space. There was his bedroom, of course, a needlessly lavish bathroom, a few closets for storage, a laundry room, and a door out to the back patio. But otherwise, it was all air and light, the sun able to warm up his entire home easily.
“You had some unusually high hormones present in your bloodwork.” The Healer continued, skimming down through the list. “Ones only present in a veela who is actively in a mating cycle.”
He made a long, guttural noise as Potter’s lips fixed tight around his hole, sucking, a lewd, wet noise emitting from the other man as he hungrily dived in.
And maybe it could also be a solution to the curse that afflicted the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
“Time to get started, then.” Potter reached down beside him, to a large gym bag he had brought over with them. From inside, he pulled a long, meticulously wrapped coil of dark green rope.
“Got it in one, mate, got it in one.” Harry admitted, running a hand over his face, pushing up his glasses to rub at his eyes. “It’s - I’m a bit overwhelmed.”
“I’ll be back next week, to check on you again!” She called out, smiling somewhat sadly, before she was gone with a
“I might have said I’m surprised by this turn of events, but then I would be lying.” Came the posh drawl that Harry was so familiar with after having known the other man for 13 years. He let his eyes open, green meeting silvery grey as Malfoy smirked at him.
His mate cried, moaning and keening as the slick appendage worked up into his cunt, squeezing in alongside of the eggs still tucked up in there. “Feels so
When he’d graduated both programmes at 25, Draco had opened his own business; a lab specializing in his own personal blend of pharmaceuticals and potions, and he’d taken the market by storm with a revolutionary anti-viral cure to Dragon Pox.
Flushing and biting his lip, Draco looked about to argue, but then just nodded, no longer trying to touch his cock.
Harry smiled tremulously back at him, tears spilling over as he looked down at the two babies that were settled against Draco’s bare chest, their little arms squirming, their faces red and wrinkly.
The moment he had spotted that mop of messy black hair when Beckett had brought him into the club, part of Draco had gone immediately into defense mode. In exactly no world would Potter
Draco moaned hoarsely as the rest of the egg popped out, the clasper with it, leaving his hole a completely fucked out, gaping mess, the loosened muscles barely able to close at all.
Naked, Draco strode into his ensuite, turning on the shower and stepping in, groaning at the lovely heat against his tired and overused muscles. Potter was quick to join him, allowing Draco to hog all of the spray, and taking up the soap when the blond passed it to him.
, Potter, don’t flatter yourself. I was actually thinking about purchasing a bigger model, so I’m looking forward to a trial run.”
Draco had already somehow successfully managed to ingratiate himself with the rest of the group, including Granger and Weasley. For some reason, they all seemed to
“Oh sweetheart, you want me to knock you up? Want me to fill you so full of come that you’re dripping for days? Think I can get you pregnant with just one load, or will I need to keep breeding you all night?”
“C'est une pleine lune ce soir. Soyez à l'affût des sirènes. Ils ont tendance à être dans une frénésie.” The man cautioned as Draco set up the required charms, the map of where to find the Mermaid’s Thistle pinned down to the console next to the steering wheel and navigation dashboard.
Sobbing again, Draco angled himself more sharply, his hands clenched in the nest beneath them, his chest flat to the ground, hips canted up as he pushed, his legs shaking with the strain.
But Harry was already gone. He’d taken a Curse Breaking job in France, and only Hermione and Ron knew what had become of him in the year since.
“You think they’re coming?” Harry asked, feeling a manic blend of joy and fear race through him at the thought.
This chapter will finally be all plot, no porn. A rarity for me, I know. But take heart, because the story is complete.
Harry caught Draco’s hand when it tried to reach down to jerk at his hard little cock, pinning it down.
As Harry ushered his mate inside, he felt prickly with a flare of possession so strong that he couldn’t help but nearly snarl.
Mermaid's Thistle was a horrifically rare potions ingredient, and Draco was almost entirely sure it was the missing piece to his most recent project.
Harry’s fingers trailed over the soft swell of Draco’s chest next, his big, tanned hand cupping up under the plush skin of one of the man’s little tits, squeezing it ever-so-softly, not wanting to wake him.
Draco seemed to flush, his body clearly warmed by the hot spray. His mate’s sweet little cock was still half hard, and it was making Harry’s mouth water.
“You gunna come in your pants just from the thought of a dirty bit of rough like me besmirching that fabled Malfoy innocence? I bet you were supposed to keep yourself pure until marriage, and here you are, ready to let me, of all people, into that tight little arse.”
The wizard manning the Welcome Desk at St. Mungo’s looked like he’d just borne witness to the second coming of Christ as Harry strode in, holding Draco in his arms.
A hand worked between them, and Draco gasped as he felt the heavy slap of Potter’s naked cock against his reddened cheeks.
Draco made a choked noise, but hooked his hands under his knees, obediently drawing his legs out and apart, his cheeks positively pink, face turned to the side.
Needing to ensure his clutch remained safely tucked up inside of his mate, Harry shoved the thick tip of his ovipositor into Draco quickly, groaning at how it slipped in with barely a whisper of resistance.
It had been one thing when Harry had only had to see the git infrequently in the halls of the Ministry or at various functions and society events, but then he’d started getting friendly with Hermione, a fellow champion of legislative changes in the Department of Magical Creatures, and Luna, who brought him as her plus one to basically every friendly event she attended with their group, giving Draco the chance to prove to them all that he was no longer a complete bastard (and was perhaps even the slightest bit likeable, in a prickly, sarcastic kind of way).
His other hand was busily working between his legs, his index and middle finger trapping the hard nub of his clit between them as he worked himself over, sliding back and forth over his clit, his cunt getting slicker and slicker until the glide was so easy that his fingers fairly flew over the swollen flesh between his lips.
“It’s a potions bench.” Draco muttered, pointing at a prime spot that he’d made Harry clear earlier with the intentions of using the area for his new potions lab. He watched as Ron levitated it over, placing it carefully on the ground.
Harry pursed his lips in a frown, and then went back to pacing, eyes flicking to the door anytime there was the slightest hint of noise beyond it.
‘Harry is human by day, but the curse changes him into a mermaid at night. We - we thought it would be best to keep it all a secret, so that no one would... try to take advantage of him, in his present state. He’s stuck here, in this area; his territory on the sea.”
“Draco broke the curse.” Harry muttered to Ron as well, pulling back and grinning widely at his best friend, who looked over the moon at the news. “And he’s
Malfoy gave him a desultory look, “I’m afraid your friend Beckett here all but confirmed it for me. Unless, of course, there is some other big-cocked dom you were looking to set me up with, hmm?”
“They - they’re kind of hideous, actually.” Harry choked out, unable to hold in his laugh as Draco scowled up at him, before he, too, burst into laughter, making the twins gurgle at the unexpected motion. “They look a bit like mandrakes.”
made it out, before it slipped back into him again, clattering up against the next egg inside, making him buck and jerk. “C-can’t - can’t get it
His eyes were shut, but they opened in a flash as he felt Potter’s mouth back on him, trailing down and getting dangerously close to -
Draco had been settled into a comfy lounge chair with pillows stuck in various strategic places behind his back and under his arse, out on the deck overlooking the sun-bright sea. Waves caught the light, glittering and flashing, gulls cried out overhead, and the air smelled fresh and briny.
“I can’t be sure that I’m right, Draco.” She admitted, turning. “But... I hope you can bring him back...”
Tears were filling Draco’s eyes, and he covered his mouth with one hand, his silvery gaze wet as he took in the sight of Harry on his knee, recognition blooming on his face as he stared at the rings.
Huffing, partially annoyed, partially amused, Harry sat back in his own chair, unrepentantly palming his cock to readjust it to sit more comfortably in his trousers.
on something as he came. He let out a frustrated moan, and worked his clit harder, determined to come again first and then try to deal with that problem.
“Indeed.” Narcissa said, sipping at her tea. “Your letters never mentioned any of this... news. And you’ve not been back home to visit in over two months.”
Potter snarled, beastly and hot, mouth refusing to leave it’s feast, but suddenly a finger was there, thrust inside.
“Yeah, great job champ.” Ginny followed up, drawing him into a hug complete with a series of rough backslaps. “Way to piss literally
He drummed his fingers against the battered leather on the arm of his chair, taking a moment to wonder at how unlikely this would be to work out. Over the past 5 years, he had managed to squeeze his cock into a few apparent “size queens,” but had never managed to actually
His knees fit easily into the shape of the breeding bench, his arms draping into their designated spots as well. It was the work of moments for Potter to strap him in, buckling him tight and secure, legs spread wide, arse at the perfect height to be used.
“You can say no, Malfoy.” Harry prompted. “I won’t bring it up again, if that’s not something you like; I’m sorry, I-”
, he was wearing a sheer white collared shirt that was unbuttoned at the throat, exposing all of that long, creamy neck that Harry almost never got to see between his robes and buttoned up work clothes. The outfit was all the more evocative for closely mirroring his preferred everyday clothing, but in the most inappropriate way possible.
Dark, tanned skin, covered in almost a set of full tattoo sleeves. The colourful shapes and lines finally began to make sense to Draco’s overwrought mind, and he gasped.
As Draco’s cries reached a peak, Harry felt the smaller man come, the pressure on his mate’s sweet spots too much, and the slick inside of him ramping all of the sensations up. Harry finally pulled his cock back, sliding the slick red length of it out of Draco’s now swollen hole, leaving it reddened and leaking slick.
“I - I feel, um.” Draco flushed, shivering as Harry kissed him lower down, on the underside of his swollen belly. Harry’s own hair was a loose tangle of black waves, and the strands trailed between Draco’s legs, which were spreading wider to accommodate Harry’s presence between his thighs. Harry’s cheek brushed Draco’s hard cock with the next kiss, and Draco’s breath stuttered. “I feel, ngh, so full, still. Oh -”
Harry started to pull Draco away, back into the house, and Draco stared after Hermione’s form as she walked back off the deck.
The light of the full moon coupled with his adapted eyesight allowed Draco to trail his gaze down his own body, his pale skin emitting a nearly luminescent glow in the dark waters. He hadn’t stopped to look since he’d fully transformed, and he gasped lightly as his gaze lingered on his chest.
There were a few scattered seating areas spread throughout The Griffin, interspersed between all of the fixtures for scenes, including a St. Andrew’s Cross, a few stages, various pieces of specialized sex furniture, cages, and other paraphernalia. It was still early, but as it was a Friday night, the club had begun to fill up, and various couples or groups were already in the full swing of things.
Having re-read this chapter during proofing... well, seems a bit of a shame to skimp out on the planned egg laying and lactation kinks I had originally planned...
Luna was giving him a serene, beatific smile, while Ginny had a familiar shit-eating grin on her face.
Harry nearly growled, but managed to pull back the sound. Still, he leaned forward in his chair, eyes narrowing back at Malfoy, the green in them hot with ire. “You’re out of line, Malfoy.”
’ Malfoy. Now, will you let me lick your arse? You can always tell me to stop, if you don’t end up liking it.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Harry teased, grinning savagely. “Any other fantasies I should know about?”
The dark haired man yanked his shirt fully from his arms, and it fell to pool at his feet. Next, Potter gently, reverently, helped Draco step out of his heels, before carefully setting them to the side.
Potter groaned, mouthing at Draco’s spread-open thigh, nose burying itself against his skin. “You’re so fucking good for me, sweetheart. Gunna make you feel so good.”
“You may rest easy knowing that Potter didn’t manage to infect you with the werewolf virus.” She immediately clarified, easing his initial worries.
Narcissa is as beautiful as her son, and somehow manages to look graceful in full formal robes as she strides up the beach while they wait for her on the deck of their cottage. She leans in to kiss Draco on both of his cheeks, embracing him, and goes stiff at the feel of his swollen belly.
“You’re so fucking beautiful, sweetheart.” Harry crooned, swimming closer to his mate, pulling him into his arms so that he could kiss him, deep and demanding. He brought a hand down to cup over Draco’s swollen belly, making the man moan and shift in his arms. “I can feel how much more swollen you’ve gotten in just the past few days. You’re carrying my clutch so well, baby.”
by Robards to coach Harry on his apparently shite skills at testifying at court, or filling out legal paperwork.
Potter’s mouth was searingly hot, his teeth sharp and merciless, and his tongue a soothing balm on his tortured flesh. The man bit and licked at the skin all around his pecks until Draco was red and littered with teeth marks across his pale skin, his scars feeling like cold-fire and liquid pleasure, his nipples tight buds of sensation, hot in Potter’s mouth, cold and exposed when not, and sharp with pain as those plucking fingers squeezed and abused them.
Turning up his long front drive, Harry’s gait slowed into a light, loose limbed jog, before he stopped entirely in front of the door to his house. Light speckled through the trees surrounding the small cottage.
Harry admired it for a second, thumbing up against the reddened rim and pushing back the next egg that had slipped down to press against Draco’s opening. That one, he could sense, wasn’t ready to come out yet.
He immediately liked the feeling, as well. He wasn’t quite helpless yet, but the idea of being completely at Potter’s mercy appealed greatly to him.
Harry struggled not to shrink back from her. His possessiveness of Draco was at the core of his being, but he struggled to reframe his desire in a way that would be appropriate to explain to this highborn lady without his normally crass mannerisms.
Everything about his transformed body seemed amped up, and the pleasure that coursed through him as he began slowly working over his clit with tight little circles of his fingers against the swollen sweet spot was well beyond anything he’d felt in any other bodies before.
Harry had managed to clean their little area up (with a liberal, surreptitious use of a powerful cleaning charm), and had packed his rope back into his gym bag, by the time Draco had slipped back into his Louboutins.
The next egg was already sliding down, squeezed down Draco’s spasming passage to press against Harry’s fingers.
Draco groaned as the clasper slid into him again now, the thin tip easily bullying its way into Draco’s cock, wiggling down and opening him up, stretching him and making his silvery eyes shut with pleasure at the sensation.
Draco’s eyes were barely slitted open, his chest heaving, his stomach just as swollen as it had been when they’d started.
before. The first round of parent-teacher meetings had gone so horrifically that he’d ended up with one of the more overzealous mothers being held at wandpoint, and the board of governors had had no choice but to sack him.
Potter’s legs were spread wide, the dark fabric of his tatty jeans pulling tight over the thick, powerful ex-Quidditch player’s thighs. He was wearing a pair of scuffed black boots, the laces nearly half untied. His chair was pushed back from the table so he could sprawl out more easily, occupying the space around him with a presence that made Draco’s mouth water.
Part of Draco wanted to balk, almost on principle, to rile Potter up. But the other part of him, eager and desperate for what Potter could do to him, to see what lovely pattern the other man could make against his skin with the rope, jumped forward to do as asked. He had rather liked the look of rope bondage during his research; it had a definite aesthetic appeal.
A silky green underbust style corset that came up just to the bottom of his pecks, framing the soft swell of muscle in a way that made Harry close his eyes and pray to any divinity that might be listening.
Full up of eggs still in both holes, and now pumped full with slick and his swollen clasper, Draco was probably feeling more stuffed than when they had originally started, especially as most of the eggs inside of him had probably grown since Harry had first pumped them inside of his mate.
Even if he couldn’t fit his prick in anyone, he had learned to get his rocks off by doing everything just shy of fucking his subs.
Harry Potter; Chosen One, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Heroic Defeater of the Dark Lord, general Do-Gooder and Golden Boy.
His mate looked beyond gorgeous in the red-tinged sunset, his belly swollen in a way that Harry could sense needed relief.
But the sweet siren song of home called to him, with his mother desperate to move back to England, so he’d accepted a position at St. Mungo’s, as a consultant to head up a newly created R&D wing that he would build from the ground up.
“Why don’t we get you checked out while Ron and Harry start unpacking some of your things.” Hermione suggested, and Draco appeared torn for a moment.
“Beckett,” Harry greeted with a nod, sitting in a similar chair beside him, feeling immediately comfortable in the dim light of the club, which had become a favourite haunt of his over the past 5 years.
his family had been about Pureblood supremacy. The experience had been truly eyeopening - to such an extreme extent that Draco decided to immerse himself nearly fully into the Muggle world after completing the Programme.
Draco had gone up to bed after that, thoroughly sated, leaving Harry to patrol his territory below the waves, until the dawn came again.
There is a good amount of plot in this chapter as well, and you will finally learn about the curse of the Beastly Mermaid and his Little Beauty.
“I - “ Harry buried his nose in the back of Draco’s hair, and Draco had the feeling he was trying to hide his embarrassment.
Draco would go to the ends of the earth to procure it, if it meant a cure for this sweet man’s parents, and everyone else who had been affected by similar dark magic.
Harry felt his own face break into an effusive smile, and Draco smiled back, still looking somewhat annoyed.
Harry returned an arch look of his own as he watched Malfoy recline comfortably, looking like a prince holding court as he crossed his long, elegant legs, a flash of red confirming Harry’s suspicions about his footwear.
Malfoy nodded, uncrossing his arms as the Healer aimed her wand at him again, this time directly at his abdomen.
“You can do it, sweetheart.” Harry soothed, oozing out yet more slick to help ease the pain and the stretch. “Don’t you love opening up for me? Doesn’t it feel good?”
Draco had missed all this, having skipped out of town, and feared that the larger group would be reluctant to accept a former Death Eater amongst their ranks. He feared the prospect of their judgement, and what it would be like if they found him wanting.
The moon was hanging low over the waves as Draco set anchor near the spot where the Mermaid’s Thistle was purported to be. He still had most of the night to complete his task, but he wanted to start as early as possible.
“Now then.” Harry said, excitement lighting up his sharp grin. “Let's get you on your hands and knees. I’m sure you’ll love squeezing the one out of your arse just as much, won't you, baby?”
The texture of his long, rough tongue was enough pain to thrill the little pain slut, but Harry was always very careful to not nick the pretty little cock with his teeth. His tongue curled around the prick in his mouth, and he felt saliva well up at the bittersweet taste of the precum that Draco was positively leaking.
got him going more than a decadent, demanding piece of toff who needed to be reduced to a pliant mess of overstimulation. The more posh, the better, in his opinion. And he’d
“All of it, obviously.” Draco replied, tone deadpan. “I’m going to be stuck out here for who knows how long, incubating Potter’s spawn -”
Somewhere along the line, Draco had misunderstood that heels were a women’s muggle shoe, but when Harry had tried to point it out to him in a friendly way at one of their pub nights (after a few pints, for courage), he had received only an arched brow and a pedantic explanation of the history of how heels were popularized for men in the 17th century French Muggle Court for royalty, and that the tradition had continued into modern fashion with such illustrious fashion houses as Prada and Louboutin, and that such footwear, was, in fact, utterly suited to his fashion sense.
“Are you part Dementor now as well, Potter?” Draco teased, but worked with Harry as he moved to bring the bottle of water to his parched lips.
“N-no, I - “ Draco’s heart was beating furiously, and he reached out, unthinking, and found Harry eagerly holding his hand, taking the seat next to him and practically pulling Draco into his lap, making soothing noises. “He can stay.”
Draco, however, looked nearly frosty with displeasure, and Harry went to him, glad that his mate didn’t shy from the possessive touch that he laid on his lower back, urging his mate to sit with him on the couch.
His sweet little rim was widening further, but the egg was still firmly inside, barely pushed even halfway out by Draco’s efforts.
Draco stared at him for long moments, his silvery eyes steely, before he sighed, shaking his head in resignation.
The sharp prick of nails at his hips, the growing pressure at his clenching hole, and the blinding pleasure of heat at his core were suddenly blotted out by the sharp pain of Harry sinking his teeth into the meat of Draco's neck.
inside of that sweet hole, baby.” Harry growled, ramming harder, rocking his cock as far in as he could get it, wrenching Draco's cheeks open wider. “You’re fucking creaming all over my cock, sweetheart,
Harry’s hands are shaking as Hermione presses it into his palm during her next weekly visit. He tucks it into the pocket of his jeans to clink against the Black ring that is already secreted away in there. He can’t stop himself from touching them over and over throughout the dinner.
being able to squeeze himself into a sweet, willing, receptive body. Being able to shove the whole, thick length of him inside of a tight, wet heat.
Instead, Draco had very calmly offered his hand to the man, and had been overtaken by the low pool of warmth in his belly when Potter had actually shaken it.
Draco gave a pleased hum as Harry started working him over, rubbing at his skin, trailing over all of the marks he had made earlier.
my favourite, as it happens. It’s 9 inches.” He gave Harry an assessing look from under his fair eyelashes, as though challenging him.
A camera shutter, a bright flash, and both of them looked over to find a grinning pap smirking at them from behind a nearby bush.
“Gunna fuck you now, baby.” Potter rumbled, pulling back from where he had draped himself over Draco’s back. He let his cock lay against Draco’s lower back, letting his precum pool in the dip of his spine. “You look so small under me, sweetheart. I don’t know if your arse will be able to take it.”
Draco would have thrashed if he could, desperate for it. He found he could no longer speak, and so he moaned and trilled, low and needy, trying to angle his strapped down hips to get Potter’s huge cock inside of his empty hole.
Draco moaned a long, greedy approval as Harry fed him the rest of his cock, inch after inch sinking into him, filling him up.
He always felt worked up and in need of some sort of release of tension after a full day of meetings. He’d been incredibly peeved that morning to learn his full Friday had been booked solid, not allowing him to go out into the field on a case, or even to make use of the training room for a spare hour over lunch.
Thank Merlin Draco had managed to find a wizard ahead of time from which to rent a small boat, so he made his way to the wharf, and sought him out.
The slick red tip of his clasper began to work its way in alongside of the ovipositor, and Draco’s face lit up.
Draco groaned out a noise of agreement, feeling like he could never manage to move again, his body completely drained, happy to lie there under Potter’s gaze.
Hermione looked far away, brown eyes shimmering with sadness. “He didn’t remember either of us, when we found him. We had to work to become his friends again. He trusts us now, and let us into his life, just a bit, but he doesn’t
He was still nearly insensate at the feeling as he felt it - Potter’s hungry mouth pressed right up against his hole.
And then his mouth was back on Draco's chest again, sucking with that devastating pressure, and suddenly his hands had moved as well, forefinger and thumb squeezing one of his nipples in a sharp pinch, making him keen.
“Immature - !” She spluttered. “Who sold you that! It’s not to be used outside of fertility treatments!”
It looked thin and delicate now, and Harry was even more in awe of this gorgeous creature, at how well Draco had taken him.
“Narcissa, thank you for coming!” Harry greeted, standing and going to embrace her, returning her air-kisses over each cheek. They had come to understand each other better over the past month or so, and she smiled warmly at him.
Draco arched hard as he came, moaning long and low as he continued to work his clit through it, coming and coming and
Terror running through him to the point of panic, it took Draco’s wide, silver eyes a few moments to process what he was seeing.
His big hands allowed him the ability to prise Draco open, his thumbs hooked down between his cheeks, slipping in to frame his hole, tips digging in and opening him up so that Potter’s tongue could spear into him.
The air had been a bit more chilly tonight, so Draco was wearing a thick but simple robe. Harry kissed him lightly, licking into his mouth and moaning with pleasure as he untied the robe’s belt, pushing it off of Draco’s sharp shoulders, leaving it on the rocky ground outside of the grotto’s beach entrance.
.” Draco moaned, eyes widening in momentary surprise, clearly having forgotten that there was another egg that needed to come out today. “I- I don’t know if I can do it again tonight, Harry, I’m already so tired, and -”
Neville gave him a disbelieving look, huffing out a laugh. “‘Minor side effects.’ Yeah, right. Well, I’ve given you all the warnings I can, so don’t come crying to me if your bits go all weird.”
Potter bit you, and there is no known precedence for the knotting, but that will all take some additional research.”
Just when Draco thought he would go mad with it, already on the edge of coming, but painfully desperate for more sensation, Potter pulled back, just slightly, and got his tongue on the tip of Draco’s cock, and began his next assault.
“You’re lucky I like you mouthy, Malfoy.” Potter crooned, leaning in to drag his nose up the column of Draco’s neck, breathing deeply, practically panting into his skin. “It’ll be so satisfying when I fuck the posh right out of you.”
Beckett had picked one of his favourite seats in the place - a beaten up old leather chesterfield that suited the Scotsman well.
“Well I am certainly glad you finally decided to invite me to visit.” Narcissa looked about the room, and Harry felt like the space was definitely not passing muster. Their little cottage looked homey, yes, but was getting a bit cluttered. It looked a bit small, now that Harry was really considering it. “It’s quite a quaint little home. How long do you intend to stay? Don’t you think you’ll be needing a bit more room, rather soon?”
“I’ve rented a villa in Marseillan. Luna, Pansy, and Ginny are already planning on dropping in for a few days.” Draco said. “I know you already said you would be busy, but you and Hannah are more than welcome as well.”
Draco had been in a woman’s body via polyjuice before, and it was a somewhat unspoken rule that it was almost
“You -” Harry stared at him, green eyes wide, mouth open with awe. His cock, which had been fully hard nearly since he’d woken, was now throbbing with need. “You’re so fucking
His muscles tensed again, his body going taut, and Harry stared down, greedy and hungry for the sight of it, as Draco’s fluttering cunt finally managed to shove, push, and
With a furtive glance around the club, Potter waved a hand, and suddenly all of the knots of his rope slackened, slithering off of Draco’s skin as though commanded to release him.
Draco let out a sob, but his muscles all tensed, and Harry sighed in pleasure as his hole flexed open wider, struggling around the width of the egg just within.
“I saw... in my research, and over there, when I came into the club...” Malfoy paused, biting his lip, clearly hesitant.
He felt cloudy and light as the hits stopped, and a trail of kisses shivered up his spine. He let out a trill of pleasure, wiggling his arse back as he felt Potter’s hips butt up against him, the harsh press of dragonhide against his hot and tingling skin.
Draco blinked slowly up at Potter, who’s eyes were darting all over his body, an odd expression on his face; one that Draco had never seen before.
Harry hurried to make them some breakfast, and hovered out plate after plate of food; fresh fruits, eggs, bacon, toast, anything he could think of to please his mate. Draco watched him over the rim of his teacup, smiling and clearly pleased.
And then, finally, Harry was lining himself up, holding one of Draco’s red arse cheeks open as he fitted the head of his thick cock against his empty hole.
Harry dutifully kicked off his shoes, following at Draco’s heels as he made his way to his bedroom, talking all the while.
Experimenting with styles and fashions he had never conceived could be possible became a favourite hobby of his, and nearly every time he walked out of his flat, people stared at him; at his bright red lipstick, paired with his slouchy tailored suit draping over his lean frame, paired with the sharply pointed toes of his newest pair of Louboutin heels.
Potter sucked him completely down, holding him in the wet cavern of his mouth as Draco thickened fully, the tip of his cock just barely touching the back of the other man’s mouth and the opening of his throat.
“He’ll need constant monitoring.” Hermione cautioned. “And honestly, it would probably be best to take you back to St. Mungo’s for fuller testing and future check ups -”
Luna Lovegood. She had acted as a sort of bridge between them all, and now it seemed like their entire year at Hogwarts were all the best of mates, having put the past behind them.
If anything, he was still feeling too pent up with energy, even as he approached the end of his run back home from the Ministry. His muscles all felt tight, an itch pushing him to do
To say Harry was eager to get his mate fully back into the water, to watch as Draco attempted to push out his first couple of eggs, was an understatement.
, it was basically a closet. And so, Harry had spent an excruciating hour hovering over the blond as he sat at his desk going over scroll after scroll, drilling Harry on his evidence logs and harping on him to
“A great lot of work for a potioneer to go through. I really hope it’s worth it for you, Draco.” Neville said earnestly, still with a bit of worry in his tone.
Draco looked at it curiously as the other man stood and began unwinding a length, beckoning for Draco to move closer to the bench.
“What?!” Draco demanded, staring down at where her wand was pointing, feeling where Harry had gone tense beside him.
“I’m afraid Potter here is very... virile. And likely satisfied some of those… conditions, under which a veela might be receptive.” The Healer deadpanned, and Draco glared at her. Harry was still staring at him, mouth now hanging open. “May I do some additional diagnostics?”
