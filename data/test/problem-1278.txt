Draco sighed in defeat. “You know that this is completely unnecessary, don’t you?”
Before anyone could answer, Neville pushed past Ron and lunged for the table, crying, “Malfoy!”
With a groan and a curse, he kicked off the clinging fabric, rolled to his feet, and staggered over to the dressing table. He found a Firewhiskey bottle among the scattered tubes of makeup with a quarter inch of amber liquid in the bottom that he downed in one swallow. Then he shoved a hand through his hair to push it back off his face. The starveling ghost staring back at him out of the mirror quirked a sour half-smile and rolled its eyes.
"That ought to do the trick," he remarked, as he tucked his wand into his robe. "I live in the hope that Ernie will find a direct route to Hogwarts, just once in my lifetime, but I fear I am doomed to disappointment."
“You have a true gift for stating the obvious.”
Kingsley paused, half out of his chair, and cast her an appalled look. “Censorship? Merlin, no! I wouldn’t dream of censoring the Press!” He settled back in the chair and leaned across the table toward her, saying earnestly, “No, my dear, I’m arresting you for receiving stolen goods, which is a criminal offense and one which will garner little sympathy from your publisher or your public. But regardless of their feelings in the matter, you
"I might ask the same question."
Even as he screamed this promise to himself in his head, knowing full well he could do none of these things, Harry came out into the square and halted. There, to his right, was the off-kilter, shabby, half-timbered bulk of the
“Yes. To get a confession out of me.”
“Your family isn’t going anywhere. You don’t have to give up being an Auror for us.”
“No pants?”
He lifted his head and squinted up at her. “Why did you go all funny when my mother mentioned Slovenia?”
“We’ll have to disinherit this one, like we did Bob, as soon as it’s born.”
“Vell, you do not,” Krum said reasonably.
wedding! The society event of the decade!”
“Yes. A life with Draco. That was always what I wanted.” He took her hand and gazed straight into her troubled, brown eyes. “You need to understand and accept that, or say good bye to me. Whatever happens from now on, Draco and I will be together, and where he goes, I go. If he’s not welcome, then neither am I.”
Harry tightened his hold on Draco’s steel-strong body and pressed a kiss to the base of his throat. “How regularly?”
Fuck, Draco…
Harry stared first at the shattered hand and then at the tears streaking Draco's face, and he felt more helpless than he ever had in his life. As he watched, appalled, Draco leaned over to kiss Pansy's lips. "I'm sorry," he said, and Harry felt the chill of recognition go down his spine again. "I'm so sorry."
Draco looked helplessly around him. "How do I find it?"
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the new chapter! Thanks for reading!
“Ready again so soon?”
Draco looked up into Harry’s face, saw the righteous anger, the drive to rescue even such a pathetic excuse for a human being as himself blazing in it, and against all reason, a smile tilted his lips. “My hero.”
“My colleague did warn me that removing the constraints on the baby’s sex may remove other constraints as well.”
“And I’m a Muggleborn Hufflepuff.”
“She won’t,” Bob declared smugly. “And anyway, she’s always making speeches about how Hogwarts doesn’t tolerate bullying or prejudice, so she ought to be pleased that I’m doing something about it.”
"Don't be a prat. You're always cold…"
"So he was, and it was very sensible of Hagrid to bring him straight to me, without trying to meddle in things he doesn't understand. But it's nothing I can't fix."
“No!” He sat up and swung his feet to the floor. “You have no idea what you’re…”
all you’re worried about, I have more gold than I know what to do with.”
Potter must have seen him shaking. He couldn’t see Draco’s tears or hear his silent sobs, but he knew he was crying and paused in his work to murmur, “Don’t. It’s okay. You’re going to be okay.”
“What if
Iffy gave a ragged laugh and felt some of the anger seep out of her. “I won’t. Dad says I need to be dignified and civilized. And Mum says, if I start fighting now, I’ll spend the next seven years in detention.”
Draco quietly set his cup on the table. He got to his feet and took a step closer to Harry.
Draco's voice hardened. "I don't want to talk about it."
“Huh. Trying to turn her up sweet? Dropping your Malfoy Galleons on posh presents won’t do it, mate.”
“Bob,” he demanded in his rough whisper.
Harry broke out in a grin. “Yes, I see. And you decided to ponder the mysteries of an apple in a Vanishing Cabinet at three o’clock in the morning?”
“Isn’t it, though? But only after I’ve finished my breakfast, and only for as long as it takes you to ravish my defenseless body.”
Harry glared at him, seething, but said nothing.
Harry gaped at them both in horror. "Someone at Hogwarts?"
After a moment’s hesitation, Harry lowered his wand.
when he couldn’t.
Harry's head came up with a jerk and he stared blankly at Vincent Crabbe. The Slytherin was sidling around the screen, clutching something in his ham-like hands and shooting furtive looks between Harry and Draco. At the sound of his voice, Harry felt Draco's guard come up instinctively. The walls slammed into place, and Draco was once more out of reach. Harry swallowed his disappointment and nodded at Crabbe, his face carefully neutral.
Harry exchanged a wary glance with Ron and traipsed out of the office on Robards’ heels. In the Head Auror’s office, he took a seat in front of the desk and waited.
“Not your problem,” Ron growled. Hermione could see the tension in him, see that he longed to be shot of Nero as desperately as she did.
“He was with me.
“Tell me,” Harry urged softly. “Let me help.”
“Bugger that!” Madam Pomfrey declared, startling Harry so much that he nearly fell off his seat. “These are children.
“Mrs. Weasley did the difficult parts.”
The decision made, she settled quickly into Academic mode, her qualms forgotten in the joys of imparting information. Her voice warmed. Her eyes lit. Her hands moved over the parchment, finding salient points and supporting data.
"No, and the less said by any of us on that head, the better."
“You saw him over the holidays. Did he look healthy to you?” If Draco didn’t know better—if his entire brain hadn’t been turned to mush by the stasis charm—he’s swear that Severus Sodding Snape was genuinely concerned about him. “Did you ask him how his studies were going or remind him that he had two full years to prepare for the exams? Did you tell him you’d still respect him if he didn’t get top marks in every class? Did you even
knows her better than I do! At least he met her when she was a child!”
Pain and panic shot through him. His hold on Draco’s fragile body tightened.
“You want me to kill this toe-rag, Harry?” he barked without taking his eyes off the guard.
“Please,” Harry cried in growing desperation, “I’m not looking for contraband or anything, I just want to find…”
“Benvolio.”
“And Dumbledore still thinks you can trust him?” He snorted in disgust, then began to gnaw his lip. “I know Dumbledore is brilliant and all, and I trust him with my life, but he’s got this thing about second chances. He’ll give
"It was Voldemort." He clenched his teeth against a fresh muscle spasm, then whispered, fiercely, "He was in my head! I heard him!"
“It’s too late for me.” He swallowed painfully and rasped out, “My father saw to that. But it’s not too late to save my son.”
Draco chuckled, pleased with himself. Harry was snapping again, instead of petting and coddling him. That was good.
“The hell you will. You may be the most selfish git in nature, but you love Harry. Even I know that. And you’ll love Harry’s baby just as much.”
He regarded Harry solemnly for a moment, then murmured, “I’ll do whatever I can to make you happy, Harry, and I’ll try to get over this… over myself. I promise.”
"Madam Pomfrey has arranged a kind of hospital wing annex, down here in the dungeons, where all of the student who were injured in the attack can rest comfortably. We'll be moving you and Draco there in just a moment."
"And I think you're lying to me. I think it bothers you when they call you my plaything or my trophy, and you take it out on me. Push me away. Pretend you don't care about
“Tell me it was good.”
In his office, Snape lit the candles with a wave of his wand and moved behind his desk. “Sit.”
"But you have to!" she blurted out, then she blushed furiously. In a small, pleading voice she went on, "He'll only tell me later, anyway. And I helped him find Draco to begin with, so I'm as much a part of this as Harry is! Why can't
Harry laughed and planted an affectionate kiss on her cheek. “Actually, we’re both Mr. Potter now.”
"But you just said…"
Ron shot Harry a stern look as he plunked a cup and a coffee pot down on the table in front of him. “I came here to make sure you were still alive. Three days without a word? Honestly, mate, did you expect us to just let you disappear?”
Draco stared at him, while Potter tugged his long plait free of the shirt collar and draped it over his shoulder.
Her hand stroked his hair lightly. “The Dark Lord foresaw even this. He knew you would protect Harry Potter’s child, at any cost to yourself, and provide the necessary magic to complete the spell.”
“Let’s call it a celebration,” Harry suggested. “We both behaved ourselves in the courtroom—well, mostly—we weren’t sent to Azkaban, and we got out of the Atrium alive in spite of all those bloody journos. Oh, and your parents get to spend some quality time gazing at their navels on the Janus Thickey ward! I’d say that’s cause for celebration.”
Narcissa tilted her head back and called, loudly, “Lissy!”
“Did she really write this?”
Mrs. Weasley snorted. “Yes, well, you could use a proper haircut, yourself. But you’re polite enough,” she added brightly, “and don’t seem inclined to bewitch Muggle objects or make the furniture explode! Maybe your good manners will rub off on Fred and George.”
“I’m not talking about Azkaban! I’m talking about what they did right here in this building! When they brought him in for questioning!”
Draco abandoned himself to it. He moaned into Harry’s mouth, reached for him with his tongue, opened himself ever wider to his searching hand, and worked himself against Harry’s cock, hips and loins with an unguarded, lascivious hunger that took Harry’s breath away.
"You only say that because
He straightened up, pulled back, and fixed Draco with a stern look. “Don’t call me that. My name is Harry.”
“We’re going. Take Mr. Platters,” he held out the plushie, then fastened his hand on Bob’s shoulder, “and stay close to me.”
"Thank you, Miss Zabini." He threw her a frigid glance and drawled, "Hurry back to your father. I know he missed you."
“Oh, Dragon…”
The calm before the storm. Harry gets a surprise visit from adolescence (those sneaky little hormones!), and Sirius makes his presence known.
already?!”
Draco gulped and turned his face into her soft body. Her tenderness was worse than her scolding, unmanning him completely and pushing him to the brink of tears.
"No, the one that says you know more about what's going on in my head than
Instead, he pulled her into his arms and gathered her up against his chest, murmuring, “I know and I’m sorry. Shh.”
When Harry at last let him go, settling him gently back onto
"I'm okay." Harry knew that was a lie, even without the wash of emotion that came off of Draco. "What happened to you?"
“But I sent that to…”
Somehow, the elf managed to look even more lugubrious than usual. “What is it that Master Harry wants? Kreacher has duties at Hogwarts and his former mistress’ house to care for. He is very busy, yes, very busy indeed.”
It took him less than a minute to finish the job. He was a master at this, after all, and he could tell by the tremor in Harry’s thighs, by the urgent, panting noises he made that he was at the end of his endurance. To drag it out would only cause him pain.
"Severus, I have a number of owls to send that will need our strongest security charms on them. Please find Professor Flitwick and bring him to my office. I'll be there shortly. Minerva, I leave Hogwarts in your care until I return. We shouldn't be gone any longer than a day, I should think, but one must be prepared for all contingencies. Do your best to keep the rumors to a minimum. Granger and Weasley will need to be told where Harry has gone, but no one else. And Poppy, if you would put everything you can remember about Draco's condition down on parchment, I'll take it to his healers at St. Mungo's, along with his warmest cloak I think…"
“So he’s… you know…
He crossed his arms and stared hard at his underling. “You may be a celebrity to half the Wizarding world, Potter, but you’re still just a junior Auror and you answer to me. So start answering.”
“But you didn’t go into the club. You didn’t make that choice. Now you’re here with me, and that means it’s not too late.”
Harry sighed. “Yes, I did, and I already live to regret it.”
Without stopping to think about it, Harry clambered onto Draco's bed and sat down on the lower half of the mattress, his bare feet tucked under him for warmth. Draco showed no outward reaction, but Harry felt a slight wash of relief go through him and knew that Draco was glad he hadn't left him to face Dumbledore alone.
"Of course not!" Hermione's brows flew up. "I think it's an excellent idea, as long as you aren't letting him do the work for you…"
“But?” Harry prompted.
He didn’t like throwing his weight around, or his power, but in this instance he had no choice. His memories of Draco were more than personal. They were intimate. And they contained secrets that would destroy Draco, if they were widely known. The Vow, the rape, the scars Greyback had left on his body, the torment his father had put him through, even his comparatively innocent romance with Harry Potter were all incendiary. Harry despised himself for sharing them, even under such heavy restrictions, but Kingsley and Pauncefoot both agreed that it was the only way. And he had sworn to do what ever it took to free Draco.
“And this,” Ron swept his hand over the Rogue’s Gallery on the desk, “isn’t all of them.”
“I won’t reveal a source.”
Three people trooped in. Harry, looking even grimmer than when he’d left, with a mulish set to his chin and a fire in his eyes that would have frightened Draco, if he didn’t know all that anger was brewing on his behalf. Weasley, Aurored up and full of brisk authority. Narcissa, as beautiful and graceful as ever but looking almost small between the two stern Aurors.
He snapped the watch shut, tossed it carelessly onto the shelf, and scrambled out of bed. Kneeling beside his trunk, he shifted aside a stack of neatly-folded shirts to find a shining object lying on the black velvet of his dress robes. It was a small photograph in a silver frame, a picture of Draco seated under a tree by the lake, staring out at the water, his face distant and sad. He lifted the picture out of its hiding place and carried it to the bed, studying it doubtfully.
“Do you want Ronald? He’s in the…” she started, but Harry cut her off brusquely.
The words filled him with panic. Draco was dying! The charm was killing him, and Harry didn't have enough power in him to stop it! His heart racing, Harry pushed himself upright and leaned against the bed, bracing his hands on the floor and screwing his face up with the effort to force every scrap of strength he possessed through the link. It had to be enough! It
” before he could stop himself. Balling his hand into a fist, he reached out with the other to open a door.
Harry cast a doubtful glance at the boy in the next bed and thought, privately, that if he were any farther from 'perfectly fine,' he'd be decomposing.
“Fuck, no!” Philippe growled down low in his throat and grazed his teeth along Draco’s jaw. “I just thought I’d have to work a little harder for it, is all.”
“End of August, beginning of September. Why? You weren’t really off fucking strangers last Autumn, were you?”
The day Snape returned the essays, Harry almost skived off of Potions, too afraid to face him in a room full of largely hostile classmates. Ron was ready to join him in a spot of truancy, but Hermione flatly refused and marched them both down to the dungeon. Once he was seated at the table with his cauldron in front of him, Harry found it easier to stay and face the music than come up with an excuse to run.
“I’m not ly—”
a lost life. It was a depressing collection. Some pieces, like the bits of Slytherin uniform, were things he might have expected Draco to preserve. Others, like the handful of familiar blue and white flannel, completely baffled him.
going to owe me!”
“We must have some way to keep track of them all, if nothing else,” Flitwick opined.
Draco had always adored Harry’s body. He couldn’t remember a time when he didn’t want to touch it, explore it, enjoy it, pleasure it. Even as a child, when he had no idea what to do with another boy in his bed, he had seen those bony wrists poking out of Harry’s wide, black sleeves and longed to touch them. Fondle them. Press his lips to the blue veins pulsing beneath his sickly-pale skin. He had burned at the thought, flushed with shame and hot with desire.
Harry nodded but didn’t trust himself to speak.
"I need to talk to you about Harry."
It was so good… Nothing like his fantasies… The heat of Harry’s body. The way it clenched around his cock, seeming to swallow it. The sounds he made when Draco drove into him. The way his head fell back and his eyes rolled up. The way his skin flushed with want and beaded with sweat. The way the wetness from his cock pooled on his belly.
Ron slid down in his chair, yawning theatrically. “We’ll have a kip together.”
(Draco got a good laugh out of that one.)
Then he started off down the passage, his eyes scanning the cells. They had gone less than half the length of hallway when Snape called, “Here!” and lunged toward a cell. Ron followed, dropping to a crouch in front the bars and gripping them ’til his knuckles whitened.
“Doesn’t matter. They’re purebloods, aren’t they? Your lot always stick together.”
He found her presence in his fireplace unnerving, even now that he’d recovered from the initial shock.
didn’t bother to tell us that Harry had
“Ickle Ronnikins!” George bellowed, pulling him into a quick, fierce hug, then passing him to George for more of the same treatment.
“Acrobatics will not save you, Potter!”
"No. But I don't want to be."
For a beat, no one spoke or moved. Then Narcissa drew close to Harry and murmured, “Shacklebolt? Are you sure?”
“I know.” Draco turned his lips into Harry’s palm and closed his eyes, soaking in the warmth and power of his presence.
Harry gave her a convulsive smile, his face too taut with strain for anything more natural, and ducked away before she could smooth his hair or straighten his tie. He escaped from Mrs. Weasley only to run straight into his godfather. Sirius leaned bonelessly against the doorjamb, hands thrust in his pockets, dark, troubled eyes fixed on Harry's face.
, he told himself,
That caught Harry completely off guard. He blinked. Raised his brows. Felt his mouth drop open.
“Because they’re rubbish,” he stated baldly, setting off a wave of murmurs in the seats above and bringing an angry hiss from his father. Pushing ahead in spite of the noise, he tilted his head at his parents and said, “I was raised on the notion that I was somehow superior, gifted with special abilities and the promise of unmatched power, simply because I was born a Malfoy. And because I was the only male heir, I was expected to carry on the name, to increase and pass down that power, no matter what the cost to myself. No one bothered to tell me what this arcane power was or how I was meant to use it. It turns out, no one told me because no one knew. Because the power doesn’t exist. It’s a fantasy in my parents’ fevered brains.”
“If you had?” Ron prompted, when he stalled out.
“I’m anxious to protect my own reputation,” she snapped back. “I don’t give a rat’s arse for that tosser and I
Draco couldn’t stand it. What right did the prat have to go all wistful on him, when he was so weakened by blood loss that he couldn’t withstand one look from those cursed green eyes? He’d have to get Potter for this when he was himself again.
“Not half as long as it did with the twins,” Tio said.
“Please. Don’t call me that.”
“I know you can, but I still worry. Me and Kreacher, both.”
"Look at the stars! Is it Voldemort's magic that makes them pulse and glow like that?"
“No.” Draco tried to wrench his head away, but he had lost both strength and volition at once. He could do no more than turn his face from the fierce green eyes fastened on him.
Harry shot a knowing look at the plate of suspicious-looking cakes in the middle of the table, then cracked a grin at the Slytherin. “Sure you were.”
"Don't worry, Poppy. Young Mr. Malfoy will not get his hands on it." He flourished the wand, and a funny, squat little table on crocodile legs appeared beside the bed. At his gesture, Madam Pomfrey set down the thing she held on it.
Draco clambered onto the stone awkwardly, his hands still bound behind him and his body stiff with a deadly mixture of cold and fear. At Lucius' direction, he turned his back on Voldemort, facing outward toward the ring of Death Eaters and Dementors, and he sat back on his heels. His face was blank, white, and still, a death mask with dark wells of pain where his eyes should be.
“What,” Ron retorted, “did Ickle Vincent learn to write his own name?”
“He did,” Harry concurred, face grim. His voice took on a dangerous edge. “Felix, how did you break my spell?”
“Apparate. I’ll take you with me, if you’re not confident in your skills, yet.”
"He went to Diagon Alley and bought me the biggest, smartest, most magical magic toad he could find, and a beautiful glass tank to keep it in. Then he came home and set it up in my room, and he sat down and showed me all the things the toad could do, all the ways he was better than the plain old toad in the cardboard box. So I took the plain old toad back to the stream and let him go, and I let the house elf take care of my magic toad, because he was actually kind of boring."
“Only if you do me, first.”
"You can't cut the link!" Harry blurted out. "He'll die without it!"
"You still have it? Can I... see it?"
“When did this happen?”
"We're worried about you. Not just Ron and I, but all your friends, Professor McGonagall, the Headmaster, Snape..."
His hesitation brought a smug glint to Draco’s eyes, undercut by the fresh tears in them. “Of course not. I’m Daddy’s little whore. No one’s going to stick their neck out to help me.”
Isolated behind a powerful Muting charm designed to keep the living room protected from the chaos of life in the Burrow, Draco did not hear the floo-call. Nor did he hear footsteps
Granger laughed. “Honestly.” Then, to Trevor, “Does that baby look like a Bob to you?”
"I know." A familiar prickle of apprehension moved over Harry's scalp, and he frowned. "I've been trying to convince Hermione to stay. She, better than anyone, should understand how dangerous it is out there for
“Hmm.” Draco sank back against the cushions, accepting the freshly-warmed cup of tea that Harry levitated into his hands. He took a sip and smiled as Harry resumed rubbing his feet. “As long as I don’t have to walk up all those stairs.”
"I'm not finished."
of this seem normal? Especially if Draco wouldn’t even talk to him?
He recognized most of the dozen or so partiers. Neville was seated at a table, a pint and a plate of chips in front of him, with Dean Thomas, Ernie MacMillan and Anthony Goldstein crowded round. Several other Aurors had come, including some of the older men who didn’t usually mix with the Young Wands. Montague, a former Slytherin who worked with Seamus in the Department of Magical Games and Sports, was chatting up the barmaid, while Hannah’s brother Gideon sat talking to Dean. Ron was not there.
“Yes.”
up.” He lifted his head, fixing his eyes on Harry. “Don’t you remember? In the Pensieve? My father said I’m not fit to carry the Malfoy name. My mother said…” He shook his head as if trying to banish the memory, then lowered it and settled it against Harry’s shoulder again. “It doesn’t matter. There are no Malfoys left, so the Ministry might as well take everything that belonged to them.”
The drink flowed through him like liquid fire, easing the shivers and bringing life back into his numb fingers. He unclenched his muscles a little and took another swallow. It was good to feel warm again, good to feel alive. Harry put one hand to his chest and rubbed it, remembering the terrible pressure of the closed link, but then he felt the huge damp spot on his pajama shirt and jerked his hand away in alarm. He wiped his palm on his leg, leaving a red smear on the flannel of his trousers.

“Only because the Head Auror refuses to let go of his prejudices and join the 21st Century,” Hermione said tartly.
"Minerva and I will take care of that, right now. Go back to the hospital wing. You'll feel better for it." Snape nodded again and turned toward the door. "Ah, Severus? Your word?"
Ron smacked his hands down on the desk and glared at Ernie. “Oi! That’s my case, you tosser, not yours, and
“I…” Fresh tears filled her eyes and spilled down her cheeks. “That was a terrible accident.”
He must have cried aloud, because Dumbledore was suddenly stooping over him, gripping him by the shoulders and speaking in an urgent voice to the others.
Harry leapt forward to catch his shoulders and pull him back. Draco uttered a tearing, wordless cry that was half agony, half rage, and slammed his head into the bedpost again. Echoing his cry, Harry grabbed his head in both hands and tucked it forcibly into the curve of his own neck.
"You wouldn't be fretting that Malfoy might forget your little romance? Maybe choose another place to sleep?"
Draco looped his arms up around Harry’s neck and leaned into him, murmuring, “You can’t dance to save your life, Potter.”
Harry looked up to meet his hard, black eyes. “Do you believe her?”
Harry wanted to cry out.
Draco smirked and touched the keys. His fingers were clumsy with lack of practice for the first few bars, then he found his groove and played a soft, lilting version of his mother’s favorite Christmas hymn. Mother had never set foot in a Muggle church, but she loved their Christmas music. This one was called
him, you're a damned fool."
Neither of the boys had moved or spoken in some time when they heard the dungeon door bang open and hasty footsteps enter the room. Harry rolled off the bed and padded over to the screen. Peering around it, he gave a yelp of surprise and started down the length of the ward at a sprint.
"I get it from my mother's side of the family. In fact, I get everything from my mother's side of the family. My father is always joking that I'm not really his."
They were well down the carriageway, clear of the castle, the cacophony of battle fading behind them, when Draco heard it again.
Harry gave a sobbing laugh. “Seriously?”
“You’re up, Cleo.”
"Not if we can stop them." Dumbledore bent over the Pensieve, both hands grasping it, and shot Harry a look from beneath his lowered brows. "Can you do this, Harry? We have no time to spare. We must see this through and find out what really happened, or the Ministry of Magic will take Draco away from us and lock him up for the rest of his life. Do you understand?"
“Believe me, if I had anything to say about it, he’d still be rotting in a cell.”
"So what are you going to do? Just wait? Again?"
The throng of Death Eaters had collected once more about the table, a palpable excitement radiating from them. In the three days since last they had stood together in this dungeon room, Ron had suffered a lifetime of fear and pain. And he had only been forced to listen. He didn’t dare think too hard about what it had been like for Draco—suffering unspeakable torments, feeling Harry’s child grow inside him, knowing that he was simultaneously betraying the person he loved most and handing the Dark Lord his ultimate weapon—or he’d go mad. He might, still, he thought, as he crouched in his cage, watching Lord Voldemort prepare to gut his friend and steal Harry’s child.
“The Burrow. It’s the only thing that makes sense.”
“No! I don’t want to hear it!” He made it to his feet and stepped pointedly away from his mother. “I want my son, and I want to leave. Get him down here, Andromeda!
"Oh, Harry."
“I wasn’t thinking about Neville,” Dean hissed, his eyes cutting over to Harry.
With a nudge of his hand, Harry coaxed the broom a few inches lower and Draco, moving as if under the Imperius Curse, swung his leg over the polished handle. Harry jumped on in front and waited for the smaller boy to slide up against him. When he felt Draco’s free arm go around his waist, he gave a crow of triumph and kicked off from the floor. A moment later, they were soaring through the open window, away from the castle, up into the wide, winter sky.
that hurts!” Draco grunted, pulling his knees up and spreading himself for Harry’s use.
“It makes sense. He knew I had the cloak and knew where I kept it. He was up here, in this room, alone, just this morning. And I told him where to find Draco. I told him. Oh, God.” He ducked his head and wrapped his arms around his torso, fighting nausea.
Harry stepped back, breathing a little too hard, his cock now aching and his bollocks tight. Draco looked a bit wrecked, himself, and the sight only made Harry’s guts twist harder with longing.
Andromeda had watched all this without visible reaction, but at Harry’s offer, she pursed her lips and said, “Harry and I will have to discuss any such p—”
Tears were dripping from her eyes and down her nose by now. “No, Master Draco.”
Draco heard words coming out of his mouth that he hadn’t summoned, heard himself admitting to things he didn’t know had happened. He watched a quill scribble his words down on parchment—those words that came out of nowhere—then stop when Warwick told it to. When Warwick or MacMillan or one of the guards were forcing the ugly words from his mouth with a wand or a fist.
She paused for a beat, then turned back to Harry and asked, “Is any part of the arrest you just described correct and legal?”
"Hallo, Malfoy!" Harry called, as he blew into the room, bringing the smell of green things and cold wind with him. He exuded so much energy and eagerness that Draco felt instantly tired. "Sorry I'm late. Practice ran long, and I had to take that hensbane root back to Professor Sprout. It was starting to grow purple fuzz from sitting in the leeching solution too long."
he thought, in the last moment before sleep claimed him,
"Stop it. I don't want you to do that."
“This is why you wore them, isn’t it?” Harry mumbled against metallic blue lips, smearing the paint with his words. “Because you knew I’d find a wall for us.”
hatred?"
“I won’t do anything without consulting you,” she murmured.
“That’s exactly what I mean.”
Harry, bless his noble Gryffindor heart, didn’t hear the darkness lurking in those words and responded with a wide, adoring smile. He clasped Draco’s head in both hands, cradling his face between his palms, and leaned in to press a lingering kiss to his lips.
“Actually, he’s not. But that’s hardly the point.”
Draco stared critically at his reflection, taking in every detail of his appearance with detached clarity. He'd worked very hard to achieve this result. He had even managed to pull his hair back with a ribbon, though no one - least of all Potter - would ever know how long it had taken him to tie a decent bow behind his neck, where he could neither see it nor feel it with his crystal fingers. The few strands of hair that fell loosely over his forehead, tickling his eyebrows, softened the austere style just enough to suit him. In fact, the entire picture suited him and made him feel more confident than he had in weeks.
Andromeda was clearly waiting for him. She opened the door before he could lower his hand. Her face was composed and unsmiling, showing not a hint of fear, even when he pinned her with a burning glare that would have cooked a lesser woman in her boots.
"But what will you do with our bodies, when you've let the Dementors have our souls? Won't that be rather messy? Awkward, even? Not really cleaning house, at all, with a bunch of zombies roaming around the place."
“Well, he is all over the papers right now, and the stories are pretty grim.”
“You can just switch it off? The spell?”
Hermione shoved Crabbe to get him moving. The Slytherin boy seemed frozen with fear, and it took Hermione a moment to realize why. Crabbe's most vivid memory of Moody was the day he'd turned Malfoy into a bouncing ferret. This event had left a deep impression on him and imbued him with an almost reverential fear of the old Auror. Of course, it had endeared Moody to the rest of the school in a way that nothing else could have, but Hermione was a fair enough person to admit that Crabbe had reason to be leery of him. She refrained from yelling at Crabbe when he hung back from Moody, merely planting her shoulder in his back and throwing her weight against him to get him moving, uttering a muffled "Oof!"
"We don't even know that his father is still alive…"
“You are a scamp, Mr. Potter. How is it that I never noticed that before?”
Draco moved cautiously about the room, careful not to disarrange anything or make a noise, until he reached the fireplace and spotted what looked like a pot of floo powder on the mantel.
“I don’t know. Neither of us knows what will happen—whether we’ll have a girl, a boy, or no child at all—and I’m okay with that. But are you?”
The others in the compartment were listening to them now, and they all shared Theodora's expression of horror.
"I thought I told you to get some rest, Potter. You look dreadful."
Harry’s scalp prickled in warning.
"Hmph. But you did just ask me to talk about Malfoy – with my
McGonagall’s lips thinned and she said, her voice harsh with anger, “The Ministry of Magic has taken Lily away."
"Hermione and I found him on the grounds tonight, alive but badly injured. Madame Pomfrey can't get to her stock of medicines, and from what Dumbledore said, they probably wouldn't help anyway. Malfoy's been hit by dark arts spells - bad stuff - and he's dying."
"What of Malfoy?"
He knew how to do this. He’d done it to himself often enough for the enjoyment of others. He knew the spells he needed for cleansing and protection and to coat his fingers with lube. He knew how to circle the rim, coaxing it to relax, slicking it up, then ease in a
He could make Harry come just like this… Take him, torment him, satisfy him, draw that beautiful, needy sound from his lips…
“Just what Professor Sprout said. It took a shine to Malfoy.” Harry scowled at the memory of how the class had mocked Draco’s mishap with the Devil’s Snare. He’d thought it was hilarious, till he’d seen those bloody Ravenclaws making fun of his dragon. Then he just wanted to hex someone. “I’m not sure whether it thought he was its mother or its dinner, but it sure wasn’t going to let him get away.”
“Hmm.” Ron stared broodingly at the photos. “The real question is, how has the Thief found
The other man did not stir.
She licked her suddenly dry lips and answered, in a rasping voice, "At the Manor."
“Do you
She gave him one more quelling glare, then turned on her heel and swept out of the room. Draco stayed where he was, unmoving, wand still pointed at the empty doorway, until he felt his mother pass through the outer wards. Then, as if he were a puppet and someone had cut his strings, he dropped into the nearest chair. His wand clattered to the table as he crossed his arms on it and crumpled forward to bury his face in them.
With sudden, explosive force, he hurled himself to his feet and stepped away from the bench. The entire Weasley clan watched, wide-eyed and tongue-tied, as he thrust out a hand toward Harry and snapped, “Your wand, Potter!”
"Nope. It'll be a breeze," Harry muttered back.
"You're a pig, Fred," Ginny retorted, coldly.
afraid of what I’ll do to you.”
Something inside Harry broke at the terrible longing in his voice, and he reached out for him without thinking. Gathering him up in his arms, he murmured, “Oh, Dragon.”
“McGonagall said they all caught something,” Parvati said.
Draco nodded silently, his eyes on the ground and his cheeks hot.
“After St. Mungo’s, I’ll stop by the Ministry and make sure his paperwork is in order. We don’t want any confusion about who he is or where he belongs, in case your parents decide to make trouble.” When Draco continued to scowl, Harry asked, anxiously, “Have you changed your mind? Do you want them to have him?”
Before he could catch his balance or his breath, the elf was talking in his bullfrog’s croak of a voice, bowing low and washing his hands in agitation.
“Humm,” Draco murmured, opening his mouth to Harry’s questing tongue and falling back against the sofa arm when the other man leaned into him.
“I know what I am! You don’t have to remind me every time you open your mouth!” He crossed his arms defiantly and added, “And my name is Potter, not Malfoy.”
Robards threw him a reproving look, telling Harry that he wasn’t quite ready to surrender yet.
He nodded numbly and started for the door behind a whispering knot of young Ravenclaws. So distracted was he by Madam Pince's strange behavior and his own premonition of danger that he still carried his essay, half-rolled but wholly forgotten, in his hand. Out in the hallway, whispers burst forth into full-blown shouts, as the students tried to make sense of this summons. Fear—and bitter experience—told them that Hogwarts was once more in deep trouble. And more than one of them stopped dead in the corridor to stare at Harry as he strode by them.
Harry stood quietly beside Draco's chair, his hands pointedly shoved in his pockets, while the guards tapped the chains that held Draco to loosen them and hauled him to his feet. Draco moved as dully and obediently as always, but as they turned him toward the back of the pit and the door, his blank gaze passed over Harry's face and he hesitated. Awareness flashed in his eyes for a moment.
After a moment, the nausea subsided, and Draco grunted, “Let me up.”
“Wait outside,” Nasty said to the guards.
Staggering under the other man’s weight, with his own body limp and drained, Harry stumbled over to the nearest chair and dropped into it, settling Draco astride his lap. Draco lifted his head to gaze at him in lust-addled confusion, then he groaned and fastened his lips to Harry’s. In the next moment, they were once more moving together, hips rocking, thighs working, breaths mingling, rising toward another shattering climax.
Neville closed his mouth with a snap, hesitated, then nodded. Turning back into the common room, he called, "Harry! It's for you!"
A grunt of annoyance cut him off. “Weasel should have kept his mouth shut. And you should have come to
“Only, think about the pattern. The attacks are ugly. Brutal. But most of the men didn’t suffer permanent injury—if you don’t count the lost memories. Now, who has been seriously hurt? Boggs? Aysgarth? Nero? What’s so special about them? What sets them apart from Nott or Croaker?
“Harry Potter is not asking.”
“Okay.” Draco settled his head in the curve of Harry’s neck and let his eyes drift closed in contentment. “We can put ‘Rescue Shakespeare’ on the to-do list.”
Harry gave him an indulgent smile that only increased his irritation. “Yes?”
"Mental," was Ron's verdict, as he once more attacked the heap of food on his plate.
Hermione noticed how his eyes followed Rose, and a smile tilted her lips. Plucking the baby from Ron’s arms, she returned to her seat on the settee, facing Draco, and settled Rose so that she sat back against her body.
split the air, followed by a miserable wail. Harry felt a pair of scrawny arms fasten about his legs, nearly pitching him over on his face.
He sat up to face Draco and said, earnestly, “I need to know what you meant by that Bob Potter remark.”
, I love you, Draco Potter!” he groaned, as he sank into Draco’s body.
“Only someone with a wand.”
Draco opened his mouth again, but Harry silenced him with a kiss, then gave him a gentle shove toward the door. Draco huffed and rolled his eyes. That earned him a slap on his bare bum that sent him skipping into the bedroom. In spite of himself—his insecurities and his worries and his guilt over what he’d done to Harry—he was smiling as he scrambled into his ratty pajamas.
“Get that shite off my table,” Harry said irritably.
The tears slipped through his lashes and down his face. “Harry,” he whispered.
“Yeah. If I’m not back soon, take him to the Burrow or home with you. Whatever works. Just try to keep him calm and watch out for his magic! He’s way stronger than you think!”
“Maybe you don’t need them tonight. Maybe you’re getting stronger.”
responsible for saving the world."
“Never mind. It’s a Muggle thing. Tell me what’s got you so spooked, Dragon.”
Narcissa nodded her acceptance, but her face had turned colder and haughtier than ever. "On the evening of March the 21st, Lucius and I were preparing to leave the Manor, when we heard a disturbance in the forecourt. Someone was attempting to break down the main doors, which are charmed to open only to members of our family, and the doors were protesting.
"I gave the students my word that they could owl their parents."
“You’re… what?”
Beside him, Draco clutched a brightly-wrapped package to his chest and retreated, turtle-like, into his winter-white peacoat. It was an unconscious, defensive posture that made Harry smile, even as it squeezed his heart. His dragon looked like a snow prince, so effortlessly beautiful and graceful that he seemed to transform his simple Muggle clothing into regal finery merely by wearing it. Even the tension in his face contributed to his princely air by turning it blank and aloof.
“Well, he does know quite a bit about Voldemort. You must grant him that.”
* * *
"What is it, Albus?" McGonagall urged.
He tried. Tried to think, tried to speak, tried to obey. But he was overwhelmed, drowning in the sensations that filled his body and swamped his mind.
, Bob!”
Snape sighed, and Harry was suddenly reminded that the professor had injuries of his own that had not been treated. The dour Potions Master came perilously close to drooping. "Spare me your attempts at logic. Just tell me what you
"There's just one little problem..."
“I got that.”
“We have no comment,” Harry said firmly and made a move to shove his way into the crowd, but the photographer was planted squarely in his way.
“How long was I asleep?” he asked through another buttery mouthful.
With that, he headed for the door, leaving behind a startled and distinctly unnerved Draco. In the doorway, he hesitated, turned back to his father, and mused, “I hope you pick the baby’s name so she gets the perfect one from the start.”
“In a moment.” Planting the boy in front of him, Draco clasped his small shoulders and looked down into his upturned face. “Write to me and tell me about the Sorting, yeah?”
Draco shook his head and started for the door without looking at the other boy. "I'll raid the kitchen later. Dobby will find something for me."
Molly looked mildly surprised at that. “What about her?”
"Yes."
“But you do remember Nero.”
Tears began to slip down her cheeks. “You’re cruel. How can Draco love such a cruel man?”
Harry started for the stairs with Ron beside him. “What do you think it is?” he asked worriedly.
Marchbanks answered in a flat voice, betraying no emotion. “Mademoiselle Crécy declined to attend this hearing. Her exact words were…” She paused and held out a hand to Percy, waiting for him to place a small piece of blue parchment in it. Then she read, “‘Let them fight it out between them. It’s nothing to me.’”
“Back to the Tower, then to dinner.”
“With my own, two hands.”
"Leave me out of this!" Ron bellowed.
She disappeared into the darkness beyond the door, leaving the two boys alone again. The torches sank back to a sullen glow, and a second one guttered out. Ron picked up the hunk of bread on the tray, stared at it, then dropped it and shut his eyes. Draco cried out again, calling for Harry this time, and Ron gritted his teeth to control his own tears.
Draco blinked at him, startled into stupidity. “You… you did what?”
He glanced up from the lovely thing in his hand. “Unless what?”
The wolfish grin widened. “Let’s just say that what you don’t know can’t come back to bite you on the arse.”
"Stop looking at me like that! And stay away from me, or you'll end up as wet and muddy as I am," Harry scolded, fending off Draco with one hand. "I have a better place to study, where no one will disturb us."
The answer was prompt, flat and firm, no hint of emotion in it. Harry felt something in him unkink. Perverse as it was, knowing that he’d guessed right gave him confidence.
Draco stiffened and toppled sideways, his hands falling away from Harry's throat. Running feet sounded all around him, and Dumbledore – a blur of purple robes and white beard – knelt at his side.
“Toilet,” he finally said through clenched teeth.
He’d never been as good as Draco at assuming a mask. In fact, he was pants at it. But he needed one now—he needed to summon his inner Slytherin and do this the Malfoy way—because he absolutely, positively
Draco sighed and slumped back against his heap of pillows. “Do you?”
Harry stared at him in disbelief for the space of a heartbeat, then he laughed. “Neither can I!”
“Hmph,” he grunted dismissively. Then he took a drag on the cigarette.
"Well, you'll be safe in Hogwarts, at least. That's my comfort. Oh, Harry!" She pulled him into another enveloping hug. "All I want is for you to be safe and happy. You believe that, don't you, my dear?”
was anything but reassuring.
“What.”
Draco to be guilty. They will do everything in their power to prove that he is, including distort the truth and manufacture or destroy evidence. If they catch you in a lie—which they will—they’ll take that as further proof that he’s guilty! That his mother knows it and is so desperate that she’ll sacrifice herself to save him!”
, Harry!"
“Sit down, Draco. Please.”
She did not move or speak for a long, burning minute, then she stepped up to the table and pulled out a chair. As she settled into it and reached out one hand to clasp Harry's where it lay on the table, she gave a tired sigh. "Why are we arguing about this?"
I’ll say hello.”
“Instead of verbally dueling with me, why don’t you
, as you call him, can destroy your strongest spells on a whim! What do you think he’d do to one of those brooms his cousins were so proud of?” Before Harry could answer, he went on wrathfully, “I’ll tell you what! He’d strip off every last safety charm, and then he’d be off to Antarctica to visit the penguins, or down to Australia to play with the real platypi!”
,” he gestured to his swollen belly, “fit inside a suit of armor?”
“I remember a party.”
“Draco.” Harry stepped up close to him. Stroked gently down his arms to catch his hands. Drew him forward a step. “Don’t run away from me, please. I can take anything but that.”
“How can you be sure that’s what it is?” he demanded, hoping against hope that Hermione could actually be wrong for once.
“What the…” he gasped.
“Don’t worry. You can still get in,” he told them with a tired smile, “just apparate directly into the house. How about the Concealment charms?”
He clasped the other boy's cold fingers in his own warm ones and murmured, "It's okay. It's only Madam Pomfrey."
Draco said nothing to this for a long, quiet minute. He traced one glittering, crystalline finger down Harry's breastbone and along the curve of a rib. Harry squirmed and twitched, muffling a snort of laughter, but Draco did not seem to notice. His face remained distant, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on his own hand, as he laid it flat on Harry's chest.
His entire body jumped at the touch. He bolted upright and grabbed for Draco, finding his tousled head and loose hair.
“So you
“No, no,” he waved that away impatiently, “I was just wondering… will it work the same in the air as it does on the ground?”
"Shut
Harry eyed him in some perplexity, a smile twitching one corner of his mouth. “How is it that you—a pureblood brat who grew up surrounded by house-elves—are so shy about one knowing what you get up to in bed with your husband?”
” Anthony Goldstein wailed. Both he and his partner, Padma, had failed to maintain the charm for more than a few seconds.
He was not going to cry. He was not going to throw up. He was not going to think about the fact that Harry Potter had just kissed him, and that it had almost driven him mad and he didn't care... he didn't care...
The ache in his throat turned sour, and he suddenly wished Bill, with all his kindness and understanding, at the devil.
“I have it on
Dean got to his feet and took a step toward Harry. “What did he tell you?”
“Nothing.” Harry finished the job with a touch of magic and straightened up to continue staring at his husband. “The countryside doesn’t look like much in Winter, but there’s a nice little village a couple of miles down the road.”
"You have company," Madam Pomfrey said, still in that brisk way, and she grasped his arm to pull him upright. When Harry made a move to take his other arm, the nurse caught his eye and shook her head the tiniest bit. He let his hands drop to his sides again and watched as she coaxed Draco into a sitting position.
“I checked the Hogwarts casualty lists,” he muttered instead. “He isn’t on them.”
“What’s that?”
When he was finished, Harry gathered Draco close again and petted his hair in a tender, protective gesture. Nuzzling his lips into Draco’s ear, he whispered, “If you ever need me to change, I will. Just tell me what you want, Dragon. I’ll do anything.”
She huffed and rolled her eyes. “You’re not the only wizard in Britain who can cast decent wards, young man! Ours were good enough to protect you from Lord Voldemort, so I think they’ll do to keep out a few reporters! In fact, I’ll pop home now and have Arthur get to work on them.” She got to her feet and shook out her robes purposefully. “I’ll be back before you hear from Draco’s healer.”
So far, it had worked. If anyone had recognized him, they had either refused to accept the evidence of their eyes or decided that his degrading existence as a Knockturn Alley whore was punishment enough for his crimes. He had remained safely anonymous.
it, but you’re here. With me. Where you belong. And I won’t give that up. I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you here.”
Harry looked at the comb with new interest. "Really? Ron gave me one of those once, but it didn't work. It just made my hair stand up in spikes."
He looked just like Harry. But that wasn’t possible… was it?
Fear clutched at Harry's heart. Had he fooled himself, after all? Had he imagined the incredible rush of longing he had felt with the touch of Draco's mouth on his? Was he hallucinating, remembering the link, wanting something so badly that he created it in his own mind and deluded his own heart? Then he looked at Draco, really looked at him, refusing to be fooled by the mask of flawless ice he always wore, and saw a panic every bit as frantic as his own building inside him. Draco was not rejecting him, only protecting himself, which Harry could appreciate.
“And some food,” Harry went on, stubbornly ignoring his words, “something to warm you up.”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, lurching to his feet and backing away. “I’m sorry. I’ll go.”
"I'll talk to Ron and try to make him understand," Harry said, desperately, "but there's nothing else I can do! Don't you get it, Hermione? It's too late to go back and pretend none of this happened. It's
“We’re chums, now?”
"Not a chance. Slytherin," the girl shot back.
Harry shot him a sour look. “I’m painfully aware of that.” Reluctantly letting go of Draco, he stepped away from the table to confront his twitching, nearly-frantic partner. “The question is,

No sooner had Harry apparated into his sitting room than Kreacher
“They tricked Kreacher,” the old elf whimpered. “They said they were looking for Ron Weasley. They said Harry Potter sent them.”
"The court is letting itself be nose-led by a senile old man and an arrogant child!"
Philippe squeezed his hand. “All right?”
“Follow the magic. Yeah, I know it’s not much, but…”

" Rowena demanded.
The portrait of Draco is just a little present for my readers. It was done entirely on my iPad, with an electronic pencil, but is made to look like a mixed-media drawing. I’m still learning how to work with electronic art tools, instead of canvas and paint, and this is my most ambitious project yet. I hope you like it!
"She did
* * *
He began to rock, pulling against the hardness nearly tearing him in half. A sizzling jolt of pleasure went through him. He moaned and clutched at Harry’s chest, eyes fluttering closed.
"What was Sirius Black doing here?" he asked, coolly, betraying nothing.
"There are going to be a lot of angry students when this is over," Ron said, dryly.
Firenze trotted a few steps, impatiently, then matched his pace to Hagrid's, while Harry half-ran between them. "We centaurs do not meddle in the affairs of humans, but neither do we harm the innocent, and this intruder is but a foal."
Harry felt his features tighten with mingled anger and grief, but he held himself rigidly under control. He was not going to break, no matter what Dumbledore said next. He was not going to turn into a tearful child who let the adults around him decide the fate of the people he loved. Not this time.
He shot his friend a panicked look, and Ron, as always, rose to the occasion. Grabbing the files from Harry’s hand, he tossed them down on the desk and turned the other man forcibly around to face the door. Then he gave Harry a shove to get him moving.
Rodolphus hoisted Ron away from the support of the tree, giving him a shove to start him moving toward the edge of the clearing. As he stumbled into the trees, dropping to his knees at the Death Eater's command, he saw that he was not alone. His friends and fellow students were sprawled all around him, lying and sitting, awake and unconscious, trussed up in magical bonds like so many smoked hams. He heard Bellatrix shouting more orders and twisted around to peer back into the clearing, even as Rodolphus fired a binding hex at him and ropes looped around him, pinning his arms to his sides. He saw Bellatrix flick her wand at Malfoy, and his body rose several feet in the air. Draco's left arm, the only part of him not frozen by Bella's spell, hung limp from his shoulder. Blood dripped steadily from his empty sleeve.
“One of them is more than a friend.”
The fight abruptly drained out of Harry, leaving him limp in his chair. He stared at Hermione, so full of pain and confusion that he didn’t even know where to start.
Draco crinkled up his nose at that. “Sex in the sand sounds messy. Not to mention uncomfortable.”
“Draco, please! It’s me! It’s really me, Harry, I swear it!”
Granger gave another discontented snort and pointed her wand at Draco. “
“Tea,” Draco said hurriedly. “I’d like tea.”
Malfoy stood in the open doorway, curved seductively against the jamb, his head cocked to one side to let his curtain of smooth, shining, silver-gilt hair fall about one shoulder and halfway down his back. His eyes were artfully made-up with charcoal-black shadow and eyeliner, black mascara darkening his crystalline lashes, and a touch of deep burgundy on the lids that matched his gleaming lipstick. He wore nothing but a pair of black jeans that Harry suspected had been spelled on, since they were far too tight to actually pull up over his arse. They rode low on his hips, the fly unbuttoned to expose a V of porcelain skin, the legs ending a few inches above his perfect ankles. And on his feet…
“It’s your
“Very well. Get back to your husband, Harry, but don’t disappear. Stay in touch, let me know when Draco leaves hospital, and keep me apprised of his progress. I may not be family, but I care very much what happens to him, and I need to know for official reasons, as well.”
“How long?” Fiddy asked curiously.
“May I speak to you outside for a moment?” Lucius said, his voice cool and courteous.
"When Draco was no longer fit to be called a Malfoy," Dumbledore added, gently.
“Good bye, Mother.” Draco pulled her into a fierce hug that seemed to surprise her. After a moment of startled stiffness, she softened and slipped her arms around his shoulders. Draco just held her for a long minute, savoring the closeness of her, then loosened his hold and stepped back. “Take care of her, Lissy.”
happy,” he added, inconsequentially.
“Yeah, well, I’d sick up, too, if I thought Bellatrix Lestrange had crawled up out of her grave.”
” His voice followed the two Aurors as they turned to leave, echoing down the stone corridor and starting a sinister rustling in the cells they passed.
“How long?”
A small voice in the back of his mind whispered to Harry that he was jealous. He hated Malfoy, because Malfoy had a claim on Draco's loyalty and affection, and Harry didn't think Malfoy deserved it. If Harry had his way, Malfoy would get nothing from his son - no love, respect, trust,
“Draco.” Harry stepped up close to him. Stroked gently down his arms to catch his hands. Drew him forward a step. “Don’t run away from me, please. I can take anything but that.”
“He won’t know the difference. Honestly. When he wakes up, he won’t remember any of this.”
"For a number of reasons," Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Dumbledore held up a hand to silence him and went on, "which I will now give you. I will give you all my reasons, all your options, and the answers to all your questions. Then I will give you time to consider before you choose, but not much time. We do not have much time, any of us, and you least of all. But for now, I only want you to listen. Will you do that?"
Hermione almost shrieked.
“I… all right.”
“I’m the one asking the questions,” Duckworth snapped. “How much did this man pay you and for what?”
“What’s this, now?” Professor Sprout cried, hurrying toward them with her wand in her hand. “Careless, Malfoy, very careless! You can’t take your eyes off a Devil’s Snare!”
Before Harry could think of an answer to this, he heard the thud of heavy paws on the grass and turned to see an enormous black dog come bounding out of the shadows toward them. Ron looked too, and a smile of relief spread over his face.
"Yes, Headmaster," Crabbe mumbled. Then he summoned his courage to add, "I'm sorry I didn't bring it sooner. I wanted to show it to Malfoy... Draco, I mean, not the other Malfoy... because he might want Mr. Malfoy - the other one - to find... uhmmm..." Swallowing nervously, he flushed and let his confused explanation die off.
Not bloody likely.
“Oh, yeah!” Ron enthused. “Let’s check it out!”
And Harry found himself powerless to withstand them.
Harry laughed and bent to kiss him. “Damsels can’t be up the duff. It’s in the job description. And I’ll make sure your armor fits. Draco, love,” he stroked the hair back from his husband’s face and kissed him softly, “we can do anything together, remember? Even stand up to your mother.”
“But he’s your supervisor, Harry. It’s only polite to…”
“You’ll have to read about it in the

“A wizard prison outside Lovikka, Sweden. She’ll live at the prison, with the other house-elves employed to care for the human inmates, and have plenty of work to keep her busy. Aside from the fact that she’ll be confined to the prison grounds, it won’t be much different from working at Hogwarts or the Ministry. Apparently, the Swedish Magical authorities have done this before and found it very successful.”
Draco broke out in a wide, melting smile. “I know you really loved me all those years, no matter how badly you wanted to pound my pointy face.”
Her words echoed into silence.
"Would you feel better if I told you that practice was a complete disaster? That we're going to suffer a humiliating defeat against Ravenclaw and won't be able to show our faces around the school for the rest of the term?"
Draco said, and even with no sound to give it shape, his voice was full of wonder.
“That’s exactly what I’m saying.”
“Come this way, Draco,” Molly said, as she turned back into the hallway that led to the kitchen. “We’ll sit in the living room, where it’s warm. Ginny? Are you joining us?”
"Now listen very carefully." Leaning closer to him, Harry said, very softly but clearly, "Draco Malfoy, you are so incredibly gorgeous that I can't keep my mitts off you and I have to ravish you or I'll go mad."
"So that's why you wanted my blood."
“That sounds like the Ginny I know.” Harry quirked a smile at him. “I gather you like her.”
Smirking triumphantly, Draco lifted his hands and executed a creditable pirouette (only wobbling the slightest bit as he came to a stop facing the desk again). “You see now why my parents are so anxious to get Harry out of the way?”
Harry smiled again, shrugging off the compliment. “I have a comfortable home and friends I love—when they aren’t trying to hook me up with random blokes in pubs, that is.” Ron blushed again and rolled his eyes. “Abraxas may be snarky, but he’s excellent company, and I like the attitude. It kind of… fills in an empty place in my life—grey eyes, pale hair and snark.”
Snape just grunted and picked up his pace, forcing Ron to sprint a few paces to keep up with him. They reached yet another branch in the passage that Ron did not recognize and stopped. Snape threw a glare at him, silently demanding that he choose, but Ron did not have the faintest clue which way to go. Then he remembered his own words to Snape about Crookshanks and got a wild idea.
Hermione glanced up and smiled.
“Let’s start with your name.”
his eyes skating away. Then he ventured, “Here for a conjugal visit?”
He shook his head slightly.
“I take it plenty seriously. That’s why I won’t let Potter cast it in my direction.” Nodding at Harry, who stood poised, wand at the ready, he urged, “Go on, then, Granger. Show the Hero of the Wizarding World what you can do.”
"Yes! It's exactly what I wanted, and it makes everything so much easier."
“Yeah, so? Are you thinking that Ferret is hiding in France on some old Malfoy property? I thought we already searched them all.”
The two boys reached the upper level and walked together down the corridor in silence. At the far end, torches burned in iron brackets along a row of grilles, each with a dark, gaping space behind it that seemed to swallow the light. Down here, the lift gates were not the shiny golden things Harry had seen upstairs. They were tarnished and rather grimy, as though no one had bothered to polish them, or even wipe off the dust, in years. The first button he pushed made a grinding noise and stuck halfway in. Harry grimaced at it and moved farther down the row 'til he found another call button.
Draco plucked the bottle from his fingers and downed its contents in a single swallow. It tasted terrible, but he had long since given up complaining about it. The stuff was Nectar of the Gods to him, now. The moment it hit his stomach, he collapsed back against the pillows with an ostentatious sigh of relief (only the tiniest sliver of which was for show). Harry curled up on his side facing Draco and reached over to clasp his arm. His eyes were still maddeningly closed.
“Are you angry with me?”
Draco halted and turned to fix horrified, tear-bright eyes on her. “Get out,” he choked. “I mean it. Get out of my house…”
Through watering eyes, Harry looked around for the source of that hideous laughter. He saw dark figures materializing around them, drawing in from the rocky shoreline and pouring out of the prison—Death Eaters, dementors, and wizards who had thrown their lot in with the Dark Lord but not yet earned a place among his chosen ranks—but no Voldemort.
"He wouldn't apologize to a Dementor," Snape interjected. "He must have known it was you."
Finally, he said, “There have been a series of unusual events. Attacks, some of them. They may be totally unconnected, but they don’t feel random to me. And the men…”
Snape shot Harry a measuring look. "He's in a bad way. He wants Potter—seems convinced that he's the only one who can bring the child back—and he's already wandered off in search of him once. Now Pomfrey has him locked in the Room of Requirement, with Ron Weasley to keep an eye on him."
“That’s quite enough out of you, George,” Arthur said sternly. “This is not a joking matter.”
Forbush watched all this with raised brows, looking from the tip of his wand to Draco’s huddled form in mild surprise. “That was unexpected. Let’s try it again…”
"I told you not to nag him about it, Ron," Hermione scolded. "I told you he wouldn't want to..."
“Harry and I are old friends,” Myrtle said coquettishly. Then she abruptly shifted to a pout. “But not good enough friends for him to tell me that he had a boyfriend.”
"She feels Draco is in danger?"
“If you two are going to start your Vaudeville routine, I’m out of here,” Hermione said tartly.
He moved to a chair that faced the door, wanting to confront whatever came through it head on, and sat down. He clasped his hands in his lap and schooled his features into cool detachment. Then he waited.
They all shuddered at that one, but Ron went on blithely.
"I can't watch this."
He rose to his feet and turned to see a witch in sober, charcoal grey robes hurrying toward them. She had a baby on her hip and a toddler clinging to her hand, both of them with shocking red hair. Her own brown hair was pulled back into a severe bun, but even that couldn't quite tame it. It escaped to fly about her face as she strode through the crowd.
“I’m serious, Harry. Dumbledore knows all about it, and he’s got a plan to keep me alive.” Draco hesitated, then added with more honesty than prudence, “Sort of.”
“Realistically?” She grimaced. “According to that first article, the reporter tried to get a statement from him, so he already knows at least some of the story.”
He was a prisoner in Hogwarts castle, trapped here by the threat of Voldemort and the will of Dumbledore. He was a murderer, with his father's blood on his hands. He was a traitor to the Dark Lord and an outcast from the wizarding world. He was no longer fit to be called a Malfoy, but he had no other identity, no other place in this world. Except with Harry.
“No, but you can take me to bed and fuck me into the mattress.”
Since the hearing, Draco had begun to relax around his son, to trust in his own parenting skills, and Bob’s behavior had mellowed accordingly. He was now almost as calm and cooperative for Draco as he was for Harry or Molly. And while Draco wouldn’t exactly call him scintillating company, he did enjoy having him around.
Harry just shook his head, unable to speak in that aching, ecstatic moment. Then adamant fingers touched his cheek, lightly, hesitantly, and the voice he loved best in all the world came in a whisper from the darkness.
so happy for you. But I’m also frightened, Draco. After all this fuss in the Press and the nasty mail we’re getting, the thought of you going out there alone makes my blood run cold.”
Harry lifted his head and looked around in confusion, startled to find himself still dancing in the night garden.
"The only lucky thing in this whole mess is that Lucius was a known Death Eater, and if anyone in that dungeon was actually sorry he was dead, they kept it to themselves. But if they'd found out about the other one…" Harry broke off and shuddered.
“You wouldn’t be the first person to say so.”
A wizard wearing a Visitor’s badge that read ‘Protestor’ noticed Harry’s Muggle clothing and took him for a sympathizer. He grabbed Harry’s arm, shook it, and bellowed in his ear, “Get yourself a sign, mate! There’s a stack by the fountain!”
what he wanted to do—pack up a squalling newborn, jump in the floo, and leave the house with no word to Draco—but he didn’t see an alternative. Not if any of the three of them wanted to survive the night.
The next thing Draco knew, Harry’s wordless, wandless spell had rendered him nearly weightless, and he was cradled in his husband’s arms like a (very pregnant) bride, on his way to being ravished in their marital bed.
“Ferret survived it,” Ron pointed out.
“Let’s hope my looks are the only thing she inherited from the Malfoys.”
“I’d be happy to destroy that copy,” Harry said, flexing his fingers and letting his magic spark.
“What did you say?” Ron demanded.
Harry stepped into the Minister’s office at Kingsley’s side, only to pull up short when he realized that Robards and MacMillan were there before them. Kingsley checked in surprise, then continued on his way to his desk, nodding to Robards.
“The shop is too crowded this time of day,” she offered lamely, “and I can’t leave the lobby desk.”
Harry broke the seal and spread the thick parchment flat. As he read, his brows rose up under his fringe. Finally, he dropped his hands and let the scroll curl up again.
“Mm. We each pay him a few Galleons over the course of the night for the privilege of fucking in the booths and pissing in the bog, instead of doing both behind the bins in the yard.”
“Got it. No weasels. Fuck like mad hippogriffs, then?”
"You didn't chase him…"
"Poppy, when you've finished with that dressing, we will see if we can rouse Mr. Malfoy."
“Never mind the formalities. I’m here to help. How are you, Harry?”
That was when Draco noticed the neat holes punched in the sides of the box, just below the lid. Air holes. His brows snapped together and his smile turned to a threatening scowl.
“I’m sure I’ve got the spell right,” Forbush informed him briskly. “Maybe it’s the wand movement.”
“I’ve been hurting for you all day, you git. It got so bad that I almost dragged sodding Krum into the bushes for a shag! Oh, f…!” Two fingers entered him, startling him out of his teasing and dragging a cry of pleasure from him. “F-fuck! Harry… please!”
Those words fell with a resounding
“Oh, I’ll still play Quidditch. I’ll just take her with me. She’s a Potter, after all, so she’s bound to love it.”
Draco finally bestirred himself enough to lift his head and rest his chin on Harry's ribs. "I don't think so."
“We may not have another day. And what good is he to us, if he’s too bollocksed to confess?”
, Dad,” she said, rolling her eyes. Then she broke into a run and disappeared through the barrier. Her father followed her at a more dignified pace.
“I want to take you apart.”
Still frowning—more in discomfort than anger now—Harry padded over to the table and dropped into a chair. “You came here to cook for us?”
“Where to first?” he asked brightly. “It’s kind of early for a butterbeer.”
” Harry’s touch was gentle, his movements careful, but the pain they ignited in Draco’s body when he lifted him nearly pitched him back into unconsciousness. He grunted, his head dropping helplessly back and his eyes rolling up.
I couldn’t let myself think about it, but I couldn’t shut it out.”
"You mean, you thought I was doing this for
“Stop right now or prepare to taste pickled fish for the rest of your natural life!”
“Must be the leather trousers.”
"Not bloody likely. But I've watched that boy closely since the siege," Moody grinned and pulled his magical eye around to stare straight at Dumbledore, "
Harry, usually so susceptible to his husband’s wiles, only laughed and chided, “Twat!” He casually summoned Draco’s plate and fork, stabbed up a blob of scrambled eggs, and held them out to his scowling husband. “Now, be a good boy and eat your breakfast.”
Harry closed his eyes at that. He couldn’t help it. He couldn’t look at Warwick, knowing what he’d done, without leaping over the barrier and tearing his head off with his bare hands.
, Draco!”
"Because this is the best feeling I've ever had in my life."
“The ring came off. The world still thinks I’m a murderer. This could be your chance to start over…”
Harry tried to concentrate on his work, but he couldn’t help noticing that the rest of the class was having as much fun as Sprout was with Malfoy’s discomfiture, and they were far less subtle about it. The idea that a baby Devil’s Snare had become so enamored of Malfoy that it had tried to poison him kept them in stitches. They exchanged increasingly off-color jokes at his expense until even Professor Sprout couldn’t ignore them. When she caught one of the Ravenclaws making an obscene gesture while miming the moment when Malfoy had nearly fallen headlong into the pot, she took away twenty House points and set the boy to mucking out the rank, blood-smeared food bin. After that, the others kept their voices down and hid their crudest jokes behind lifted hands, but Harry saw it all. His temper was on a slow boil by the time class finally ended.
"That's it, then. He knows."
Draco dived for the pillow and grabbed his wand. Scrambling around to located the worst patch of flame, he pointed the wand at it and cried, “
Harry lifted the still hand he clasped and dropped a kiss on its knuckles.
“We’ll leave you both to get some rest,” Dumbledore said, motioning for Pomfrey to join him at the foot of the bed. “Harry, this is your last night in the hospital wing. You need to get back to your dormitory and back to work, now that Draco is on the mend. Draco, I’ll plan to remove the block on your magic tomorrow and you can return to your dormitory on the following day, assuming that Madam Pomfrey gives you a clean bill of health. We’ll talk tomorrow, while it’s still safe.”
Ron finally managed to muscle Harry out the door, but at that, he turned to spit over his shoulder, “He’s here because you ordered him to come! The entire fucking department heard it! So either he walks away free, or I go to Shacklebolt and tell him that you ambushed your own man, with about a dozen witnesses to back up me up! And I’ll tell him about the illegal Trace on Malfoy’s wand, while I’m at it!”
“Get out of my way,” Draco said, quietly.
” Warwick snarled, interrupting Harry’s testimony for the first time. “Longbottom is lying!”
“I have a public image to uphold. I can’t embarrass myself in front of the entire wizarding world.”
“What if we don’t? What if they…”
Harry was close beside him, having crossed the room silently while he stared at the bracelet. He caught Draco’s hand. Lifted it. Dropped a kiss on the tip of the scar showing below his cuff, then another on the pulse-point in his wrist and another in his palm.
Ron chewed that over for a moment, then nodded. "Right. He could still be hiding in the dungeon."
“He has none, as far as I’m aware.”
Harry would recognize that pattern of thin stripes, that beguiling combination of age and softness anywhere. But hospital wing pajamas? Why would Draco steal a pair of hospital wing pajamas and carry it with him into exile?
Harry abruptly fell back against the canted end of the tub, carrying a shaking, sobbing Draco with him. He didn’t touch his back, didn’t try to restrain him, just clasped his head and petted his hair and kept repeating his soothing noises. Draco huddled against him, face burrowed into his neck, the ugly words still spilling from his lips no matter how desperately he wished that they wouldn’t.
Countless eyes swiveled to Draco once more, studying him for signs of bodily destruction. A faint ripple of laughter swept through the crowd and quickly faded. Draco smiled sweetly but said nothing.
“That was not meant as a criticism.”
"We have the word of everyone in this room – except yourself and Remus, of course, whose words would not help our cause – that they fought with Narcissa. And we have the Knight Bus as evidence of their violent intent. We can also, in a pinch, prove that Narcissa threw an Unforgivable Curse of her own."
"Can you shut up, at least?"
“The Headhunters are investigating the theft, and I know Kingsley will do what he can to stop Skeeter. She has his memories, too, after all. But I’m not counting on him getting to her before the other stories are published.”
“Do you believe any of her protestations?”
“What in
Sirius' face darkened, and he snapped, "Don't make light of this!"
“It’s the perfect name,” Harry insisted. “After all, we had to
Harry’s shock erupted into fear-edged anger. He twisted in his chair to face Draco and grabbed his hand, squeezing a little too tightly for comfort. “Have they threatened you?!
Draco’s chest heaved, and Ron knew that he was crying—silently, agonizingly, the only way the proud Malfoy knew how to cry. “How do you know all this?” he ground out between unacknowledged sobs.
The man had his robe up around his waist and was working on his trousers, still half choking him with his tongue, when a lamp suddenly flared to life. Draco turned his head, tearing out of the kiss, wild with mingled panic and hope, to see his father standing in the doorway. His attacker turned at the same time, but he did not relax his posture or let go of his fistful of silver-gilt hair. Draco was thoroughly, humiliatingly pinned beneath the man’s body and his father’s scathing glare. He shot a look of desperate pleading at his father, but Lucius flicked his eyes away and fixed them on his attacker, without ever acknowledging Draco.
Draco went on, in a quiet, desolate tone, "It doesn't work this way for you."
“Hm?”
"Nothing. Don't pay any attention to them."
So why did he care if she wept?
“Fine,” Harry bit off furiously. “Then find out who did.”
“Who?
Harry chuckled. “You know what I mean.”
“It was hideous—just what you’d expect from that cockroach—but nothing compared to what’s coming. The next one’s about the Unbreakable Vow.”
“Draco.”
Draco laughed down low in his throat, stepped swiftly out of Harry’s arms, and took his hand. Then they were striding through the crowd, making for the doors and the castle beyond.
“The Aurors rounded up everyone at the club who’d had any kind of contact with him. I was at the top of their list.”
With a dismissive shrug that told Draco just how little this soulless creature knew about love or magic, Forbush pointed his wand at Draco’s bulging belly and spoke the Coptic incantation. Magic poured from his wand. Draco tried to twist away but could not escape, and the dreadful, alien magic struck him yet again.
“Oh.” Her plucked, painted, pencil-thin brows rose precariously above the frames of her glasses. “Was my attendance voluntary?”
He couldn’t go all the way up to the tearoom on the top floor. That would put too much distance between him and Draco and cost precious minutes if something happened to him. Or even if he was waking up and Harry needed to get to him. No, he had to stay close.
“They’re your best mates. They’re bringing curry and pappadam, your favorite. What could possibly go wrong?”
“Ohhh.” Bob gave him a wide-eyed look and poked a finger into his mouth. “Papa promised
"I'd rather stay, if you don't mind, Professor. I want to hear what Madam Fox says about Draco."
The lift eased to a stop. A cool feminine voice announced the Second level. Harry and Ron stepped out of the car and strode away before she had finished listing all the departments to be found there.
“Maybe it’s not related, but it’s bloody convenient,” Harry snapped. “Lucius just happens to be out of the country on the day his son is attacked on the street and his grandson nearly kidnapped? Where, exactly, has he gone?”
A loud thump made his door tremble, and a grating voice called, “Oi! Colin!”
“Maybe, but you shouldn’t have to. Especially not on a night like this, when you’re hurt and you’re scared. I should’ve comforted you, not attacked you like a ruddy maniac.”
“Hmm?”
He flushed with pleasure. “Yeah, well, it’s my job, y’know.”
“No. You were too busy whinging.”
Whew! Here we are at last, at the end of the story!
“Wha…?” Ron gasped, caught in the act of jumping to his feet and nearly toppling over in shock. “Wh-what do you want with Harry? You don’t think he…”
"No, I simply know my students. Harry would hate every moment of wearing such a thing, and I have no doubt that he'll lash himself into a frenzy of remorse every time he sees Draco with it. But Draco is cut from different cloth." Minerva snorted. "He is not shy, has no desire to blend into his surroundings, and takes it as his due when others set him apart from the common herd. I predict that our young Mr. Malfoy will soon be wearing his adamant hand as a badge of honor."
“Here. You’re bleeding.”
"I can walk," Malfoy said to Snape, sounding irritated.
Pulling the book from his pocket and returning it to normal size, Harry casually expanded the settee so he could lean up against the arm next to Draco, then flipped to the marked page and held it out.
All of this flashed through Harry's mind in a the time it took to digest Draco's words and come up with an answer. Malfoy was still looking at him with unguarded eyes, and Harry felt a curious twinge of guilt at the trust implied by that look.
The latch scraped, then the door swung ponderously inward. Snape stood just inside, glaring fiercely at Ron with his habitual sneer twisting his face.
She carried Bob’s bag over to the bed and set it on the floor. Then, after a quick rummage through it, she pulled out the blanket covered in fluffy yellow ducklings. Harry helped Draco to lie back down on his side, Bob tucked in close to him, then he and Granger swapped the ducklings for the blue blanket that had so offended Draco. He watched, eyes heavy with pain and clogged with tears, as Harry framed the little face in folds of white flannel dotted with yellow.
In answer, Harry unfolded his legs and rocked forward onto his knees. Draco did not move, did not seem to breath, and Harry had a brief vision of a deer caught in the headlights of an onrushing truck. Then he closed his eyes and leaned in to bring his lips to Draco's.
Draco was struggling to look composed and dignified in front of a man he neither knew well nor trusted, and who overawed him by his mere presence. The best he could manage was stiff.
“We can’t be sure he’s there,” Hermione temporized, always the voice of reason (even when no one gave a buggering fuck about reason). “The charm only gives us a direction. He could be anywhere along this trajectory, and it may be coincidence that it passes through the Ministry.”
“I want to see you warm and open,” he breathed into the kiss. “I want to see you spread out on the bed under me.”
George winced, but Fred looked mulish. "It's our room, Mum!" he shouted back.
“A baby gift?” Draco eyed his husband in some surprise. “I realize that’s the last thing we need—we’re in imminent danger of being buried alive under a heap of onesies and plush toys as it is—but it’s not exactly sinister.”
Once again, Harry turned to look at Malfoy, and this time Dumbledore did not draw his eyes away. Harry watched the shallow rise and fall of the other boy's chest as he breathed, the only sign of life in him, and remembered the strange thrill that had gone through him when he saw the shimmer of his own power in Draco's face. "I think I understand."
“I do know what a twat is, and I have, er, encountered one
"No, you will not. You will let those boys deal with this in their own way, and you will say nothing, unless one of them comes to you for help. Do I make myself clear?"
"Implicitly. Why do you ask?"
The silver-blond head turned in his direction. In the uncertain light, Malfoy’s face looked ghastly pale, with heavy shadows beneath his cheekbones and circling his eyes. Oddly, the torchlight did not seem to warm his skin, but rather to accentuate the contrast between marble-cold flesh and ruddy flame.
"Not so good." Harry swallowed painfully. "How did… how did you guys know he was here?"
“Stop! You’re hurting him!”
“Lissy.”
“Mmm.” Twisting his head so he could fix Harry with half-lidded eyes, Draco demanded, “Why so anxious to bugger off, Potter?”
Diggory nodded in satisfaction and stepped back. Dumbledore gestured for Harry to follow and started for the telephone box at the far end of the room.
Draco’s promise lasted for less than a day. The next morning, over their usual chaotic breakfast, Harry handed him a letter. It was not a Ministry missive but was inscribed very formally to
Their lips heated. Their heads tilted to bring their mouths more firmly together. Their bodies swayed in delicious unison, legs interlocking, arms holding each other strongly. Draco sighed and sank his fingers into Harry’s hair, pulling him still closer. And suddenly they were dancing in a net of glittering light. Gold and silver power, woven perfectly together, flowed around their bodies, blurring the lines of their figures and binding them to each other.
“Thank you,” he murmured.
As he twisted onto his side and reached for his wand to clean himself up, Draco reflected that it was both a shame and a relief that his promises to himself made it impossible to enjoy a repeat engagement with Alec. He wanted that man—in his bed, in his body, sweating and pumping between his thighs. He ached for him. But the sad truth was that his fantasy of Alec had given him far more pleasure than the reality. Because Alec wasn’t the one.
Pensieve…"
His own grandparents had not taught him this, of course. They had never played with him, never indulged him, never come into contact with him at all, unless he’d been groomed and dolled up and cowed into rigid silence. In fact, they seemed to view their grandson as some rare species of warm-blooded statue. Molly had certainly not taught him either, being the sort of grandmother who would just as soon adopt the little ones as her own and raise them without their parents’ unwelcome, unnecessary, largely inept interference. So, who had?
“Nobody wants to talk to me, anyway.”
"Why don't your parents talk to your cousins?"
Ron turned a few more pages, frowning. “Not during the twenty-four hours prior to the attack. The only odd thing was a few days before. They had a visitor to the Manor.”
in this ridiculous state. “I’m fine!”
"But Madam Fox," Harry broke in, "how can you be sure that his memories won't… do to him what they did the first time?"
“Here’s where I left off,” Harry said, pointing to Benvolio’s speech.
“I don’t know what I want,” Draco whispered, tracing the image of his father’s face with a fingertip.
But he already knew the answer. Potter hadn't come because he was being hopelessly, desperately high-minded and noble. He was trying so hard to live up to Dumbledore's expectations of him, trying so hard not to let anyone down or make a wrong move or tarnish his image as Perfect Bloody Potter, that he wouldn't do what he wanted, only what he thought was
that brought a happy ache to Harry’s chest.
"Do you have any idea how long she's been gone?" Dumbledore asked.
He threw another swift glance over at Seamus, Dean and a whole line of avid faces ranged down the table beyond them, all waiting with baited breath to hear the latest delicious details about Malfoy’s mysterious disappearance. Then he turned back to Hermione and said, tightly, “You try telling him.”
he thought, willing his words to reach the other boy.
Fudge fixed him with a cold, disdainful eye and snapped, "Be quiet, Mr. Potter, or you will be removed."
When Ron had signed off, Harry made his way back upstairs to the bedroom. The two bodies in the bed had not moved since he’d left, so he was surprised, when he slipped under the covers, to hear a soft voice in the darkness.
He had slept in this bed for days without feeling the familiar knot of fear and revulsion in his guts. Until tonight. Until he’d invited another man to share it with him. Then, suddenly, the dreams returned and the bed that had felt so safe for so long was just like all the others. Soiled.
“I don’t.”
“This is going to hurt,” Harry whispered, as he pulled his hand from between Draco’s legs and reached for his own flies. “I’m sorry.”
Instead, Hermione had crashed in on them before he'd really gotten started, and now Draco was alone. Harry was facing Hermione on a rampage. Both of them were confused and embarrassed, and God only knew what Draco was thinking! Harry could kill her. He loved her, but he still would gladly kill her. And if she started in on him about Draco, he just might do it.
"Indeed. It's through his position at the Ministry that he got his son the job of conductor on the Knight Bus."
“I thought you wanted children.”
“I’m not a healer, Harry.”
Nasty, of course.
“Not about the child, no, but the other… you must have realized that you, er…”
The next week passed more slowly than any of Harry's life. He attended classes, he practiced Quidditch, he did his homework, and he ate on a semi-regular basis, but none of it pierced the fog of shock and misery that surrounded him. Hermione and Ron quickly gave up trying to talk to him, but they appointed themselves his guardians. One or both of them were always at his shoulder, making sure he got where he was supposed to be or deflecting the unwelcome attention of other students.
Draco swallowed audibly, then spoke to the window in a rough, hurried way that told Harry just how hard he was fighting to keep himself under control. “I’m trying, okay? I’m trying to be adult about this. Sensible.
“Always such a stunning grasp of the obvious,” Potter said, stealing one of Draco’s caustic lines, if not the tone that rightly went with it. He lifted their clasped hands and dropped a kiss on Draco’s knuckles.
Harry's insides went cold with horror, but he did not dare to protest. It was a mark of how shaken they all were by Draco's behavior that not one of them said a word. Not even Snape. They all stood in grim silence, looking at Dumbledore, waiting for his decision.
“A part of you,” Harry said softly.
Either would work.
Lucius whipped aside the tapestry and shoved Draco roughly down the first few steps before following him into the looming, torchlit maw. “Silence! I won’t have such treachery spoken in my house!”
Instead, he fastened his own hands in Philippe’s thick, dark hair, pulled his mouth tighter to his throbbing nipple, and groaned, “Taste all of me!”
Draco sighed wearily. “Don’t talk with your mouthful. And no, we cannot go see Teddy’s broom now. He invited us for tomorrow afternoon, remember?”
“That’s good.”
“Find Ron and Hermione. Tell them, ‘I found him. He’s safe. Wait for us at the cottage.’”
“They don’t leave much to the imagination.”
Her eyes widened in horror, cutting him off. “What is Harry Potter saying?!” she squeaked.
“A toast it is,” Bill said brightly. “Around the Christmas tree. Where’s the good brandy, Dad? Or do you two need a shot of something stronger?” He threw a smiling look at Harry and Draco, who were still plastered against the wall, looking a bit spell-shocked. His scarred, handsome face was full of nothing but warmth and sympathy. “Let’s all go back to the living room. Give Mum room to work.”
We all know the saying: The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Well, Harry is about to learn the truth of those words and get his first lesson in Consent.
Maybe there was some mercy in the world.
“That’s a terrible analogy,” Draco mumbled damply.
Ron accepted this without a blink, used to Snape’s constant verbal abuse. “What do we do?”
They came in the same breath, Harry’s blood mingling in their mouths while their spunk painted Draco’s skin. Draco clung to Harry, weeping silent tears, until the delicious spasms finally eased and he could breathe without sobbing again. But even then he could not move. He could only lie against the wall, pinned there by Harry’s weight, caring for nothing but the press of his husband’s body against his own and the hot slickness that fused them so perfectly together.
“How about if I just take it a cup of tea?”
“Did she behave herself last night?” he asked, as he sat in the chair to Draco’s right.
Harry, as terrified as his lover, once again reacted on instinct. Whipping up his hand, he shouted, “
“Oh! Oh!” Teddy began bouncing on his toes with excitement. “Is it time, Harry? Can we go in?”
to cool down!” Draco cried petulantly. “I want this… this
tightened his grip, closed his eyes, and lost himself in the heat of his lover’s sweet, idiotic, entirely delicious mouth.
"Who was it, Harry?"
“Help! They’re getting away!”
Fred jerked his head toward Malfoy’s still form. “What about him?”
“Harry…” he whimpered, sounding pathetic in his own ears and not caring.
“Maybe if you bothered to read it once in a while, you’d know what’s going on in the world! You’d solve your cases faster, that’s for damned sure!”
to kneel between Harry’s spread legs, his hands braced on the mattress to either side of the other man’s head. His long hair spilled loose around them both, trailing on the eiderdown and forming a curtain as silvery, rare and beautiful as the cloak they had just discarded. Their eyes locked. Harry licked his lips, making them gleam wetly in the soft light.
Without looking at any of the faces turned so anxiously to him, Dumbledore strode over to the blank wall and raised his wand. A muttered spell, a light touch with the wand, and a large section of the wall vanished. Harry hopped off the bed and slipped between McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey to move up beside Dumbledore. He stood, staring at the small, frozen figure in the bed, and he thought that the pain would swallow him whole. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had caught Draco with any other expression on his face, but the binding hex had trapped him in the moment he awoke from the stunning spell, his eyes wide and glazed with terror, his mouth half open in a cry that never happened. Looking at him, Harry did not know which he wanted more – to crawl into the bed and wrap his arms around Draco, or to find a very dark hole to hide in until he came back to himself.
Looking into his earnest face, Harry made a snap decision not to give a fuck about fucking Robards. He was a prick and pillock and not worth the energy Harry was wasting on him. Neville, on the other hand, was his friend and Harry wasn’t about to brush him off.
“The Manor.”
"You know," Harry remarked, "you remind me a lot of Professor Snape."
Draco almost groaned aloud.
Whether Bill picked up on the shift in his mood, or simply decided that they had nothing left to say to each other, he rose to his feet and brushed the dirt from the seat of his well-cut trousers. "See you around, Malfoy."
His head came up. His eyes found Harry’s. Then both men turned at the same time to see Bob, sitting up on his cot and knuckling his eyes.
Ron chuckled, some of his sour temper evaporating at this rare chance to see his wife discomposed.
The last time he’d set foot in this dungeon, he was a beaten, helpless, humiliated seventeen-year-old boy, huddling in a chair wrapped with chains, facing down the fury of a purple-robed mob. They called themselves judges, but they might just as well have been waving torches and pitchforks, so bent on vengeance were they. Harry had saved him then, standing up to them all without flinching, speaking out on his behalf and persuading them to listen. Now here they were again, in the same dungeon, with the same purple wall looming over them, but Draco was no longer that terrified boy and he didn’t need Harry to save him this time. He could take care of himself.
He turned to face her, fixed her with his most compelling gaze, and threw every ounce of sincerity he possessed into his voice. “You can’t keep us here. And you can’t let my mother take us to the Manor. If you do, my baby and I will both die.”
“No, sir,” he replied automatically. Mention what? What had he missed while he’d been wool-gathering?
“What in Merlin’s name is going on here?!” Arthur demanded.
Her gaze sharpened again, and she gave her skirts a brisk shake as she headed for the door. "That's what the Closed ward at St. Mungo's is for, young man."
“I know.” He gazed at Harry for a long moment, then shrugged and dropped his eyes. “I don’t think I can explain it to someone as sane as you.”
Harry caught the wary note in his voice and smiled crookedly. “I know what you’re thinking, but you don’t have to worry about Kreacher. He’s got a bee in his bonnet about his blessed Family, but he’d never do something stupid or dangerous, even for the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.”
Then, with no thought for his mother-in-law’s daunting presence, Harry scooped his laughing husband up in his arms and carried him away.
Harry held him tightly, savoring his closeness, and asked, “Do you want the candles out?”
That thought gave Harry pause. Did he really think that Draco was the most loathsome person he'd ever met? If he told himself the strict truth, he would have to say no. Lucius Malfoy was much worse. And Cornelius Fudge was a coward, which was much worse than a sneaky rat in Harry's book. Then, of course, there were the Dursleys. They were stupid
He lay there for a long time, staring at that window and wondering what day it was. Thursday? Friday? Did it matter, since he couldn’t remember the month or year either? He had a vague notion that it wasn’t quite Christmas yet, because the shops in Knockturn Alley hadn’t put out their decorations—not that the denizens of the Alley went in much for Christmas cheer, or that he ever saw more than the telltale glow of colored lights from his little window—but that’s as close as he could get. Not-quite-Christmastime in some grey Winter after the war that was supposed to fix everything and hadn’t.
He’d meant it to sound dry, but it came out doubtful. Thanks to his recent ordeal, he had learned to view the obsessive devotion of house-elves with suspicion. He wasn’t at all sure that he wanted to live with one bowing and scraping and fawning all over him, his speech to Harry about the duty ancient Wizard families owed to their elf retainers notwithstanding.
When Harry flooed into the parlor midway through the afternoon, carrying Bob in his arms and a bag bedecked with ducklings over his shoulder, he was met by a frantic, furious partner who was circling the room like a starving vulture.
Draco shook his head dumbly, too sickened for words.
"All right, then, is there a chance he's still here, but he's hiding? To frighten us?"

“Healer Bulstrode was the obvious choice to oversee this pregnancy,” Granger said primly.
“Erm,” Harry cut in, clearing his throat awkwardly, “actually we do.”
“Fuck that. You’re my partner and this is our case. I need you, mate. Unless you have to get back to Ferret,” he temporized.
"Shut up, Potter!" Draco groaned, as Harry's hands finally reached bare flesh.
“Maybe she would have tried. And maybe the Dark Lord would have punished her, like he’s punishing me.”
Here's a short epilogue for you - a bit of domestic fluff (and a tiny bit of smut) with the Potter family.
The entire wizarding world reads this rag!”
Felix stared at McGonagall—her square spectacles, uncompromising face, tartan robes and hat wreathed in holly—and gave her a gap-toothed smile. Then, cooing and gurgling in the most enchanting way possible (Harry was sure that no baby in all of History had ever been as enchanting as Felix, unless it was Felix’s father), reached out his little hands for Draco. Without hesitation or concern for his fantastically expensive robes, Draco plucked Felix from Harry’s arms and cradled him against his chest. Felix gave a shriek of delighted laughter that turned heads all around them, grabbed Draco’s blue-streaked plait, and shoved it in his mouth.
“Hey, I never said she…”
Dumbledore nodded, let him go, and did not waste another glance on him as he hurried away. All his attention was riveted on Draco, who sat like a marble statue in the middle of the bed, his eyes wide and his face blank.
He forced himself to look up at that caressing word, to meet the green eyes fixed so ardently on him, and found Harry bent close enough that his chest nearly touched Draco’s shins.
Harry’s flush deepened. “I like that name. It’s… dignified.”
Ron shrugged and grinned, then nodded at Dumbledore, who followed only a stride behind him. “Actually, it was the Headmaster, but here we are.”
touch that child!" McGonagall growled, and Draco heard the rustle of wands being whipped out of robes.
As if reading his mind (which he probably was, given that pregnancy had rendered Draco incapable of guarding his emotions), Wart leaned across Draco’s tummy to wrap both arms around his neck and whispered, “
“It’ll take him time to confirm that you were anywhere near the
“You’re an Auror. Surely the Ministry…”
It took me a long time to write this chapter, because I had convinced myself that it had to be as close to perfect as I could get it and I was frankly terrified even to start. Then I realized... I didn't want this one perfect. I wanted it raw, spontaneous, erratic and painful, as if we were experiencing the scene from inside Draco's head in real time. I wanted it to stagger and limp and fly apart, not flow in a neat story arc. So I closed my eyes (metaphorically speaking, of course, since I need them open to type) and jumped.
Ron shifted uncomfortably on the bench and ventured, unhappily, “Shouldn’t he be in class with the rest of us?” Harry just grunted, refusing to look at him. “Seems like this is the time to get himself back into the swing of things—when no one’s taking it very seriously. If he waits ’til after the hols…”
"Give it here."
"Yes!"
"Blimey! The 'Eadmaster!" he exclaimed, eyes popping.
"What do they want?" Harry demanded, a trifle petulantly. He'd been enjoying his afternoon with Draco, especially the last bit, and he didn't relish an interruption by two people virtually guaranteed to put Draco in a bad mood.
“Blimey!” Harry gasped. “I thought you were upset!”
"How could I?" his mother lamented, her eyes lingering on the dragon tooth swinging from his left ear.
"So Black is a hero."
Draco just stared at her, stunned into stupidity.
“Then we certainly will be.” She smoothed her robe again, eyes following her hands, and hesitated slightly before venturing, “I also gather that Harry will be adopting the baby.”
Draco shook his head.
She sighed. “Can’t it wait ’til tomorrow?”
Thank you again to all my readers and the loyal reviewers who keep me writing! I hope you enjoy the chapter!
“I’m only doing it for Felix. So he can have his baby brother Tio.”
Ron rolled his eyes in exasperation. "Because you haven't looked like that since Malfoy got his marbles back, and you only
"This one works."
“No, she misses your eloquent speeches and ruthless arguments. She said that no one wakes up the Wizengamot like you do.”
A few hours later, Harry slipped into the Room of Requirement and shut the door behind him. Glancing around, he saw no sign of Draco, but this did not put him off. The Slytherin rarely left this room, and never without Harry as a guide, so he had to be here somewhere. Tiptoeing over to the nursery corner, he peered into the cradle and saw Lily curled up in it, sleeping peacefully. He watched her for a moment, unable to tear his eyes away from her lovely face, then he turned to the only remaining place where Draco might be hiding.
“Mmm.” Draco wrapped his arms over Harry’s and squirmed still more closely into his embrace.
The taproom of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly empty at this hour. Tom nodded a greeting as Draco stepped out of the fireplace, then turned back to endlessly polishing glasses, assuming that the new arrival was headed out into Diagon Alley through the yard. When Draco approached the bar instead and eased onto a stool, the old bartender lifted his brows at him.
“Looks like he got you right across the cheek.”
“I’m saying that I can save Draco by confessing to the crimes myself.”
"What's going on?" Harry demanded, as he stepped around the privacy screen and stared at them in bewilderment.
Maybe.
choose you and father over Harry! I will
“Mm.” The throaty sound was all contentment.
He looked. He saw. He groaned in agony and turned to bang his head against the wall.
Draco took one hitching breath, slipped his arms around Harry’s waist, and began to cry in ugly, tearing, heaving sobs that threatened to rip his body apart.
"Ferret, please."
Diggory scowled at Madam Bones, mentally chewing over her suggestion, refusing to be distracted by Fudge's exchange with Narcissa. "If Dumbledore has put his memories in the Pensieve, how will we learn anything with Veritaserum?"
