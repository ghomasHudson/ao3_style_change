Harry grins and follows her into the kitchen. “No, I’m fine. I just came to see if you had some time to kill.”
, and it all seems very trivial and stupid now. Because he never had a choice.
Harry almost forgets to write his reports until Thirty-nine firecalls him one evening at Grimmauld a week later. Apologies spilling from his mouth, he updates the man, describing the fading, the bursts of mist, and Malfoy’s relative silence. Malfoy hasn’t said anything pertaining to the case, and Harry’s not about to push it. He tells Thirty-nine as much, and the latter nods, agreeing. But he reminds Harry anyways, that while the data the Unspeakables seek is not as urgent, it’s a different case with the resistance.
Harry barks out a laugh. But quickly sobers himself. The situation. Right. He relays the information; except the git part.
Harry frowns. “Hermione?”
“Harry,” Ron says, “is that your patronus? It looks a bit different… Wait, where are the antlers?” He pauses. Then, “Mate! Don’t tell me—! Did you turn into a girl? Are you secretly a girl? When did this happen? Why didn’t you tell me!” he all but wails.
“Draco,” he gasps. “Draco, Draco, Draco.” He sniffs and hides his eyes behind his sleeves.
“Unspeakable number Thirty-nine.”
“And what are you trying to tell me with this?”
He secures the last shingle down and steps back to survey his work. He feels that new yet welcoming feeling of satisfaction well up within him, and he almost shouts in joy. But with much of the wards down due to the destruction of the house, he stops himself. It wouldn’t be good for the muggles to accidentally stumble onto the premises due to this whim.
“How did you like our new, beta-version, indoor-fireworks?” George adds, squishing Ron out of the way. “Safe—if not a bit loud—won’t set things on fire, and
The fox lights up and starts sprinting excited circles around Harry. Harry laughs and remembers the alphabet paper. He sets it down on the table.
“Why not?” He frowns. “He has calm so I’m just gonna take some.”
There’s nothing to do except sit, so he does and lets his thoughts wander, desperately keeping them away from the possibility of death. He wonders how Luna must be doing. Luna, Luna, Luna. Luna, who had been caged in the Malfoy dungeons for months. Luna, who held no grudge but had indulged his request for forgiveness anyways. Luna who stayed with him and comforted him and offered to share her home even when his burned. Luna who only ever gave him the one request to keep her plants and home safe. One request and he couldn’t complete it.
Harry pauses. He’s angry, of that he’s certain. But
Instead, he sits back and summons a bottle of butterbeer. After the incident with Luna, Harry’s found that he’s not as avid about getting drunk on a rooftop as he probably would have been before. It’s a romantic concept really, to sit under the sky with a drink, but he’d rather not risk rolling off the roof with no one to catch him this time. So he sips his butterbeer and enjoys his rationality as much as he can, which is to say, not a lot.
“Yup.”
“I’m Draco,” Harry continues. “Draco Malfoy.”
“You can’t?”
“Unspeakable number One, head of the Department of Mysteries.”
The kettle whistles.
* * *
Harry nods slowly. “Yeah, I guess I’ll go. Thanks. See you around.”
Eyebrows lifting, he turns to regard her with questions evident on his face.
it, before the next hurricane or tornado comes along and tears it all back down with nowhere to start from again.
“A sick prison, that’s what it is,” Gale mutters darkly. “Know what we found?” she turns towards Harry.
But now his father’s dead and his mother’s in France and no one will rescue him this time. He’s scared. He’s so very scared because he knows he’ll die this time. There’s only so many ways to avoid death. Each misfortune is a roll of the dice, and he’s run out of luck. He resigns himself to his fate, slowly but surely; yet even as he comes to understand this fact, he’s scared. He doesn’t want to die.
Harry shrugs and gives Ron a smirk. “I guess the Chosen One just has a superior capacity for magic.”
“ Harry!” A strong shake brings him out of his thoughts. His eyes focus on Victor, who, Harry notices, actually has a real expression on his face. “Have you calmed down? You’re shaking the whole house man.”
. The
In all honesty, Harry doesn’t get it. Doesn’t think he ever will because he’s not the one stripped down to a bare soul. He has his inner monologue, his “physical” thoughts and emotions, and he can put words to everything he thinks and does. He
It’s Hermione who comforts him this time. With her little pats on the shoulder and whispers of “It’s ok, it’s ok. That’s perfectly fine, Harry.”
But now, Draco continues to look at Harry. And whatever the doe finds in him, it must be good, because Harry can actually feel the bright tidbits of satisfaction and… and comfort.
. That’s all.
“Did you—” Harry takes a breath, his voice shaky. “Did you contact St. Mungo’s?” His eyes beg, pleading that Victor did the right thing when he was so out of it. Because it all wouldn’t matter if Malfoy were to die.
They grab a quick bite from the Leaky, and before he knows it, Ron has convinced Harry to side-along him to Grasmere. He thinks he should be a bit frustrated with all the prodding, but it’s Ron, and he knows his best friend wouldn’t ask for something so unusual without wanting to help. So he agrees and lets Ron take his arm.
“So, what do you want to do today?”
He looks at Malfoy’s hands. Then he glances down at his, still tucked under his thighs. They’re getting numb. And before he can think more of it, he slides his hands out and tangles them with the limp hand lying closest to him. He picks at Malfoy’s fingers, marveling at the slender digits which are
Harry Potter, but also because of his swollen eyes he hasn’t managed to get down to a normal level. A healer stops him on his way to Draco’s room and passes him a potion to help with the swelling, and thanking him, he downs it in one gulp.
“Wh-what?”
Malfoy unfreezes and gives a jerky nod in acknowledgement. Then with a small swirl of mist, he disappears. Harry sighs. He feels like he’ll be sighing a lot. But hopefully Malfoy returns later. They were finally starting to get along so well.
“Not loud in volume, Potter. You just stand out a lot and your fame is not helping. This case
* * *
“Yes sir.” Harry turns to leave, then pauses. “Wait, why didn’t you give me the Malfoy case this time? You know I had to deal with him last time, and I really
“Yes you are. As someone who witnessed your sixth year at school, I believe I can firmly say it’s the same thing all over again! Plus, this
“Erm…”
“I don’t know, so detached? Carefree? What were you even doing these past three years?”
But Harry himself found that he hadn’t and doesn’t particularly like telling other people his feelings. It’s annoying and frustrating, and when people don’t understand, it makes him all the more upset. They don’t understand what he’s been through, all the little events that led up to the explosive anger he has today. And explaining it over and over is tiresome, burdensome, and he just wishes they could just…
Anyways, I hope that was an okay chapter...? We're back to Harry with the next one and I'll try to get it done faster because I don't like cliffhangers either 😂
The tray contains a cup of water and a small bowl of some kind of soup. The lighting is too poor to tell. He eats every last bit. In the past, he would have worried over poison, but these people want something from him, so probably not. It wouldn’t be productive to starve out of spite either. Who knows when his next meal would be? Anything to live.
“Well, I guess it’s good you’re sitting down already for this…”
It’s an evening spent well, Harry eventually concludes. He doesn’t think he’s ever dined out with Luna like this, ever, and Draco simply dozes in the hood of his jacket the entire time, faded and small. It’s different from dining with Hermione and Ron, and Harry thinks it’s an interesting contrast that would be interesting to observe if melded together. Perhaps it’s because he’s known Luna for a shorter period of time. Maybe he’s not as close with her? But when Luna laughs loud enough that the other patrons of the restaurant turn to stare, he guesses it’s just because Luna is free in the way that others can’t restrain. And being with her rubs it off on him, so in a place where no one knows him, or Luna, or Draco, he also laughs.
Hermione’s openly observing him now, and Harry can feel her worrying gaze as she rakes over his face. She takes the paper and folds it neatly before filing it back into her bag. “Are you okay, Harry? I’m sure it’s kind of sudden, but I know you don’t read the paper and just in case you hadn’t heard yet…”
Draco gives a huff.
He looks for a house, and he lets Luna lead him around her quaint little town and decide that this is a place he can call home. So he finds the perfect cottage and brews his potions and bakes with Luna, and makes his house his home. It’s not perfect and it’s hard and half the world may hate him, but here, where no one knows him except Luna, it doesn’t matter. It’s all precious to him, and that’s enough.
But Luna’s now going through a pile of articles and doesn’t give any indication to what she’s just heard. Turning back, he’s relieved to find those grey eyes waiting and staring unfocused into Malfoy’s tea.
“Well, I mean, since you can clearly leave the hospital, then that means we don’t have to stay there all day do we? I can be with you elsewhere?”
Malfoy’s tail wags a bit and Harry takes that as a yes.
“You’re welcome.”
Draco isn’t there, or at least Harry doesn’t know if Draco is there or not, and while he’s not sure, he’ll keep apologizing until he’s heard. And in the meantime, he keeps his head bowed towards Draco’s body, not daring to hold those pliant fingers in his own. He apologizes for taking apart something precious. He apologizes for the intrusion. He apologizes for being selfish and tainting Draco’s home in the hopes of making his own. He’s sorry. He’s so sorry.
and sparks that fill the room.
“His patronus is a doe? Interesting.”
After all, he just wants to be there. To be there when Malfoy reaches that dream. To be there when the shards come together and bless him with that calm, that peace, that bit of Malfoy that has since shook him all those days ago.
“What?”
But anger is destructive, and Harry sees that now. And when he’s angry, he acts rashly—not that he doesn’t act rashly normally—and it’s led to this. The consequences don’t outweigh the satisfaction of the moment, and it’s not worth it. It’s not worth it.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “No?”
A pause. “Er, mate?” Ron starts. “What
For once, Harry doesn’t know if he’s mad. Doesn’t know if he’s sad or upset or in shock. He doesn’t know whether he is supposed to cry or yell or whatever the appropriate reaction is, so he settles for nothing and simply sits and stares.
* * *
“What, no I’m not—”
“Mhm.”
Harry gives a startled shout and cracks his head on the wall in his effort to scoot away from whatever it is. As the bit of smoke clears, he sees Luna, awake now and backed into the opposite wall. The doe hasn’t moved.
no actual thoughts as he simply
And there. That sentence. That was more than Harry could handle because it was just a bit too close. It was more than acquaintances, more than he had asked for, more than he had decided on. Because he did not need to know that Malfoy was attached to Grasmere and all the implications that came with it. He did not need to know that perhaps Malfoy loved the lack of civilization and the sea of green and the vast expanse of sky. And he most certainly did not need more things to mess up the meticulous order of his life.
But of course, life doesn’t bend to his will, and when eight rolls around and Draco has yet to appear, Harry forces himself to stand and take his leave. He spends the night not thinking. In some ways, he craves to go over the day, review his apologies and maybe come up with something neater and more refined. But he’s tired in more ways than one, and as soon as he lies down, he falls asleep.
“Well you see, being a qualified and legal joke shop, we are also legally allowed to be in possession of a bunch of,
“Nice scare though,” George puts in, and Harry can practically feel Draco preening.
But not for long, because it seems as if not a second later, he’s waking up to sporadic tremors of shivers not unlike passing through a ghost. When he opens his eyes, it’s to the disorienting view of a silver otter swimming around and through him.
Harry grunts.
“Maybe.” Luna’s smile widens.
Many cups of tea later, there’s a knock and George pokes his tired face through the door. “Hey Harry. Sorry, but I need Ron down in the store. Customer complaining about an exploding quill.”
The two act like children, like teenagers, and although they’re all only in their early twenties—still young—Harry feels old. It seems like lifetimes have passed between his childhood and now. A whole war happened, seven years crammed full of action and fear, and never for a moment has there been a break. And all these events only seem to elongate the time in between so that Harry could wake up forty tomorrow and he wouldn’t be surprised. He feels forty.
“I’m still sorry though.”
The four settle themselves around Draco’s living area, the doe squishing himself as close as possible to Harry’s legs without actually going through them.
Draco wakes, and for a moment he panics, because it’s dark and eerily silent and he can’t open his eyes. It takes a while for him to stop trying, and only because he realizes that the rest of him is bound and stuck too. The memories resurface soon enough, and he realizes with a sinking realization that he has been abducted—again.
Ron takes in the inside of the house just like the outside. With a calm gaze and curious eyes, Harry can practically see his mind spin as he catalogues everything. In the end, Ron doesn’t say anything. He simply trails along as Harry wanders the interior, following whatever catches his eyes.
“But he clearly said…” He whirls to face the doe, who’s staring at him with eyes that must be as wide as his own. “You did say something right?”
Luna simply continues through the small garden, but Harry pauses at the front gate, feeling like he really shouldn’t be intruding on someone’s property. Especially when said property belongs to an ex-rival who isn’t even there to defend his place against the likes of Harry.
home?”
The fox pauses. Then takes a slow look around at the room, at the house. At his home.
Another groan.
doesn’t fit. There are clashing memories and the familiarity that only comes with years of being together, and everything keeps overflowing into his other shelves and boxes and It. Doesn’t. Fit.
“Oh…” Harry shifts his weight awkwardly.
“We’re calm.”
Malfoy tries to laugh. Probably.
There’s the clanging of the door and Draco whips around to see the Dementor coming towards him. No. No no no nononono.
Then,
“Ah they should be ready now.” She stands, dusting herself off before carefully floating the cookies out of the oven and onto a plate to cool.
“Oh. How do you hear?” Harry remembers something. “And how do you think? The other day you said you don’t have a mind?”
“Good morning?”
of the world and the freedom Malfoy never had and may never get to have again. He cries with regret that he couldn’t have understood sooner, and he mostly cries for himself. He’s confused and muddled, and while he now understands the frustration, the anger, he can’t understand the calm, the escape, and peace with crystal skies and seas of green.
The door opens and he hears it click shut. A second later, he feels the bed dip as Hermione sits, but he’s already resolved to never show his face again, so he stays curled up.
“These are just trial cookies,” she says, and Harry opens his mouth to say something but is almost immediately cut off. “I’m sure they’re quite safe though, so please try them. You did agree to be my test subject and I’m holding you to your word.”
* * *
“Mal—Draco.” The fox pauses just for a second, then cautiously looks at Harry. Harry lets out a breath. “I figured we could talk this way. You can point to the letters and I can read it out?”
Harry creaks the gate open and walks towards the cottage, patting his pockets for the key.
act mean and arrogant.
“He’ll be ok,” the healers says suddenly, and Harry starts. “His body will be fine, and we’re just trying to find a way to get his soul back in. That’s it.”
He pauses when he realizes he’s rambling, and sneaks another look at Draco. He stills, and though he’s not sure where he’s gone wrong, regret floods him anyway.
With his panic calming down, he sets about drying the water on the ground and the walls. And when that’s done, he drags his blanket back and arranges a nest on the ground, deciding to wait out the rain. Yet not five minutes pass before Harry realizes that it’ll be awhile before the rain stops, and he might as well find something to entertain himself with.
Draco snorts. Harry frowns. “What happened?”
But he’s determined and has a purpose today, so he gathers his nerves and speaks up. “Hello, Malfoy. Is Luna there? I’d like to talk with her.”
The fox eyes soften and turn around. Ears flatten and fur trembles in a silent purr.
, tilts his head at him.
Harry bites back a laugh and fails.
I'm honestly trying my best and I've read so many already yet I still don't know how to write...
But then he remembers he’s on leave and he can technically do whatever the fuck he wants whenever he wants. So he ignores his stomach and decides to open another book. Perhaps the rain will stop soon, he’ll never know.
He wonders what Malfoy thinks about, stuck in his patronus like this. He wonders what Malfoy thinks about in those long periods of silence and when he disappears, and it’s such a lonely thought that Harry has to leave for somewhere more crowded to take his mind off the matter.
Harry nods dumbly. Yeah that’s it. He just wants to stay.
Nono what would his therapist say? Breathe? Alright, he can do that. Closing his eyes, Harry takes a few deep breaths, willing his mind to empty. Now, think reasonably. What can he do right now? There’s nothing to do in Grimmauld and he hasn’t blown up a room in anger thankfully. So he has to get outside. But where? Does he need groceries? No, Kreacher had already gotten them yesterday. His friends? Everyone’s at work—oh, that’s right, Luna.
“That’s not a life!”
Harry waits for the fox to elaborate.
Her plants? Harry’s lost for a moment. Why do her plants matter? Then he remembers his last proper conversation with Malfoy. He’d mentioned something about house and plant-sitting.
Harry is
He goes back out to the hallway, and looks at the furniture now blocking the walkway. A desk and a chair. Squeezing around them, he sets off, looking through room after room. Yet everything has really been cleared away and it’s all just tables and chairs now.
With no more excuses, Harry panics for a second. Then he decides to fuck it and just get it over with. He apparates over to Luna’s and raps on the door.
His eyes follow Malfoy as he walks quickly and quietly, cloak wrapped tightly around him as he practically hugs the wall. His windblown hair rustles with the movement and his gaze is steady and sure, if not a bit tense. The pause in Harry’s shouting is just enough for Robards to put a steady hand on his shoulder and draw his attention back to their argument.
a Saturday, would you like to join Ron and me in his hunt for more exotic tea?”
“Ah yes, that’s the building we found you in. Radolphus Lestrange seems to have been the last to be in ownership of it.”
He wakes when something hard smacks into his face, knocking his glasses askew. He opens his eyes groggily and feels Draco laughing, the pulses of happiness hitting him in waves.
Luna kneels besides him with her notepad as he lies facedown from where she had dragged him away from certain death. “Yes yes,” she says soothingly. “You’ll get it.”
“Welcome to my office,” he says with a wave and a small bow, and he ushers them in.
—the boy that taunted and teased Harry and stalked Hogwarts like a prince. What did the world know about him? What right did they have to torment this specific person like so? And now he is bleeding all over again, and the lights are reflecting harshly off the bathroom tiles and the blood, oh god, the
“You are! You’re the same as the lot of them! You’re thinking, why does this git get to run away and live peacefully while everyone else suffers! You’re thinking, it’s not right for me not to at least
“Hello, Harry,” Ron’s voice suddenly cuts in, and Harry turns from the coffee machine to look at the dog that’s appeared next to the otter.
Also, I'm considering doing a switching POV thing? Not sure. But if so, the next chapter would be from Draco's pov. Thoughts?
Harry raises an eyebrow, but decides not to question it. When he enters the kitchen, he finds Luna sitting on a stool, staring intently into the oven at what looks like a few unassuming cookies. He sets the pies down on the table.
something that’s supposed to be left to the detective division isn’t it? Meanwhile, I suggest you take the time to clear your mind so that when they
“Hey, hey, we’re perfectly fine though. Just a bit of minor damage. Why anyone would attack a joke shop is beyond me. Must be a bunch of idiots.”
And Harry barges in. He watches himself, the short conversation at Luna’s, and then the fight. He watches himself shout about
But then a more horrifying thought strikes him, and he gasps. Malfoy’s never been fading like this before. And if fading now means that Malfoy will just disappear for good one day—no, he can’t think about that. What’ll happen to his dream? To
Draco wakes when someone abruptly yanks the chain connecting his hands upwards. He groggily looks up, and although the person’s face is obscured, he instantly knows it’s Baker. Three days must have passed then.
He stills, and as he waits, the mist slowly solidifies into the small fox. He’s facing away from Harry, looking out the window at the same sunset, at the same sky. And even as a breeze blows through the room, Malfoy’s mist sways and flows, blurring the image. He fades in and out of sight, and suddenly, Harry wonders how long Malfoy’s sat there, even if Harry couldn’t see him.
Draco thinks he’s been in this cruel place for at least a month now. His mother’s with him this time, and he’s glad for it. Nice Harry’s been appearing less and less, to be replaced with the more realistic one, and Draco doesn’t like him anymore. When the nice one does appear, Draco takes full advantage, crowding into his space and crying as Harry soothes him.
It’s not his ideal choice of reading per se, but there’s honestly nothing else in the house, and books will at least take some time to read. So he grabs a few in his arms and stalks out, resolutely ignoring the silver glow coming from the other side of the room.
“Malfoy, is that your patronus?” Ron shouts incredulously.
“What? What’s wrong with him?”
But that’s all Draco gets to think, because as soon as his feet hit solid ground again, he’s hit with that familiar wave of despair and anguish and he immediately curls up into a ball on the ground. Whoever’s accompanying him let’s out a noise of annoyance and hauls him up by an arm, dragging him forward. The cold and sadness only grows, and eventually, just when it’s too much and he just wants to die, they stop. Draco’s on the ground again, and he listens to the rustling sounds and the murmur of low voices.
“You know what?” says Hermione suddenly. “Maybe you should go visit Luna again. She knows Malfoy best after all, and then perhaps you can figure out where everything stands.”
Harry pauses for a moment, then turns around and heads towards his desk. Lights off mean the problem is being taken care of—or has already been taken care of—and he figures he’ll just drag the news out of someone at lunch. In the meantime, he has piles of paperwork to deal with, and he still needs to go over the last write-up with Victor.
,” Ron gasps, and wipes a tear that Harry cannot and does not see.
“What about the prisoners?”
“But I... already fixed half his roof?”
“Yeah, yeah, that’s good.”
* * *
“Dammit, Malfoy.” He thumps his head down on the bed besides Malfoy’s hand. “I’m here for work you know. They’re trying to get your soul back into your body so you can wake up.”
“Wow,” Robards finally says when Harry’s done telling the tale. “What the fuck indeed.”
“So?” Luna replies.
After all, just as how speech is the voice of the mind, is writing not the voice of the soul? Harry, with his abrupt and spontaneous life, constantly stopping, changing directions, his rash and loud personality that defies structure yet upholds justice—does his handwriting not suit him well? Harry thinks it works anyways.
“That’s fine. Now regarding our last main issue here—”
“You—you do?”
No one had visited today, and being a Sunday, it strikes Harry as a bit odd. But he doesn’t mind. It’s a rest day, he thinks. For once, it’s nice to be alone. His thoughts still run all over the place, but it’s harder to overthink in a place with no worries. So he doesn’t.
Draco jabs out, and Harry only barely follows the movements with how furiously quick Draco’s pointing out the letters.
“Ooor you could just describe him or draw him.”
“Oh shut up, prick. Memories are a bit more reliable.”
Harry takes a rattling breath. “Why are we here? And I don’t even know if I can find his house, and, and—”
Except where Malfoy should be is some old wizard who looks like he’s on the verge of death. And Harry balks. He
There’s a flash of white and then there’s nothing.
So he squeezes his eyes shut again and flips to the next page and glances down. And his eyes land on the words “Architecture, 1800s.”
He ends up bumping right into that desk outside. He really ought to move it out of the hallway, he muses. So gathering his strength, he shoves it back into the room, the table legs making an ungodly screech against the floor that has his teeth chattering and skin trembling. Then he curses himself because why hadn’t he thought to just levitate the damn thing? So he levitates the chair over instead and unceremoniously dumps himself in it.
Harry soon realizes that it’s more normal for Malfoy to be zoning out than being consciously aware. He comes back to the room every day, and more often than not, he comes across the fox staring out the window or at a wall or simply floating mindlessly in the air. And when Malfoy’s zoning out, he fades in and out of view like a spectre haunting the edges of Harry’s mind.
Harry doesn’t know how long he stares at the doe. Thoughts flit through his mind and disappear just as quick, and there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZaRQmLuChc&list=PLJKdpJnnRDMd-5Jp37r_qZDk8xfewtuOs&index=33
He grabs his things and ignores the questioning stares, only mumbling a “thanks for the tea” at Luna before whirling out of the room.
“Always?”
workaholic and protector of the people—
And while Harry had spent that time hiding within the confines of Grimmauld place, away from all the noise and chaos, the two remaining Malfoys had simply disappeared. For another while, the roar of public outrage rose to unprecedented heights. Then when weeks turned into months and still nothing new had emerged regarding the Malfoys, the world finally seemed to accept that this was just another thing that just is.
He tells himself that his steady job with his respected position is everything he ever wants. Enough to live a comfortable life, enough to have fun with his friends, and enough that he feels proud of himself. And that’s all that should really matter. Him and his friends. Them against the world.
Robards groans again. “Ah, I guess I didn’t tell you. That’s on me.”
“It’s a good thing he didn’t build that pyramid.” Owen frowns. “But if the resistance has his plans, that’s not much better.”
“I, uh, I just remembered I have things to do. I gotta go.”
“What, why? What’s so bad about a pyramid?”
Finally, they stop in front of what Harry immediately recognizes to be Malfoy’s house. Or rather, Malfoy’s half-wrecked mess of a cottage. The burns are still there and many of the windows have yet to be fixed, but the hole in the roof seems to have shrunk.
. Except there had for him, and Harry struggles to hold on to the hope that maybe, just maybe, Draco will hear him out, take pity, and accept his apologies.
It happens a few more times over the next few days, and with each occasion, the cloud shifts more and more into something less vague yet not concrete at all. But it’s the fox that always returns at the end of the day, and with it, the relief and peace.
So on the fifth day, he sits in Draco’s room and apologizes. He bends his head over again and keeps his hands in his lap and he
At least, Harry decides, it’s quite nice to walk around without all the rush and hustle of a big city. No reporters, no paparazzi, no one to judge his every action the moment he leaves his house. He takes a deep breath, taking in the rustling trees and cottages, all under that vast blue sky. He thinks he can appreciate it.
Ears flick and the doe tilts its head.
“There’s been a leak! We need to leave now!”
Another laugh. “I think I’ll do that.”
They have all of Draco’s boxes carried over from where they had been stored at Luna’s, and although there’s many of them, Harry has barely found any furniture. With Draco’s guidance, he unpacks and puts the various objects around the house. Pictures on the walls, books to line the shelves, and an endless supply of potions ingredients, cauldrons, and literally everything and some that Harry swears he’s seen at the Apothecary on Diagon.
Anyways guess I'll try to post more often from now (seeing as I'm stuck home due to the coronavirus... stay healthy/safe y'all!)
So he painstakingly pulls notes and books and interviews and he compiles the perfect guide. And even as he stays with Luna, he watches his home put itself back together.
to take him seriously. And he wants it
. All he’s wanted from Harry is just calm and quiet. He wants that gentle demeanor Harry gives his friends. He wants that smile, that trust, that companionship. His Imaginary-Harry was exactly that. And when he appears, Draco cries in his arms and lets himself dream.
Baker stops pacing to crouch in front of Draco. “We’re going to overthrow the Ministry, Malfoy. And you will either help us or die.”
“Ron?”
Harry wakes up enough to see the doe prancing circles around his sofa. Then he stops to nose at a letter on the ground.
All of a sudden, the cups on the table shatter, spilling tea across the table and dripping onto the floor. Malfoy flinches back, looking with horror from Harry to the shattered remains.
Eyebrows furrow. “But thats… what?”
Right on cue, Harry’s stomach grumbles. He laughs. “Sure. You’re right on time.”
“Woah,” Harry says. “What brought about the floating chandelier?”
“Harry,” she says firmly, “you need a break from all this Malfoy stuff. He appears after three years and you’re suddenly wrapped all around him!”
Harry sighs. “No, I just need to, um, take some time to sort through some things. See how it goes.”
“That’s pathetic!” Harry screams. “If you don’t try, then all you’ll be is a Death Eater! You’ll always be a Death Eater!” He grabs Malfoy’s left arm and shoves the sleeve up. “This!” Still gripping Malfoy’s arm, he shakes the faded mark in front of Malfoy’s face. “This is all you will ever amount to!”
Ron’s looking back at him with a frown and that same frustration. “Do you even know what time it is?” he demands.
Then just as Harry’s starting to think he’ll go mad, a silver mist floats out of Malfoy’s chest. It swirls around before slowly condensing into a fox. A red fox? An arctic fox? Harry doesn’t know the particulars, but it’s a rather small fox and really fluffy-looking, and if he hadn't known it was Malfoy, he would be tempted to grab it and cuddle with it.
It’s a few days later—Harry’s given up keeping track of the days now—that he stands up one afternoon to go grab a late lunch. Draco’s still perched on his shoulder as he had been all morning, and it isn’t until Harry’s halfway down the hallway that he realizes Draco’s still there. He can leave the hospital room.
The fox pauses. And almost like an afterthought,
“The tip-off led us to what seemed to be an abandoned manor belonging to the Lestrange family on the outskirts of London.” Owen taps his finger on the map that’s now covering the table. “We believe it used to belong to Radolphus Lestrange. We’re not sure how the resistance came to occupy the building.”
Draco’s tense and even more frozen than Harry, and for once, the mist around him is still and rigid and
“No, you’re not.”
“Yes!”
Luna greets him with a dazzling smile when he shows up at her cottage twenty minutes later with a bag of pastries.
"A Black," the elf squeaks. And to Harry's utter astonishment, tears start flowing down the crinkled face. "It is Kreacher's honor to serve a master of the honorable House of Black." He gives a deep bow. "Kreacher shall prepare your quarters." Then with a crack, the elf leaves to do just that.
Luna just looks at him for a bit before putting everything away into her bag. “Harry, sometimes, people don’t feel safe so they create their own safe place.” She maneuvers Harry into a standing position, then apparates them to the ground. “And this safe place should remain a safe place. You can’t take it away.”
Harry brings two cups over and sets them down on the table. Draco’s home hasn’t changed since Harry last came—except for the dust covering everything, which they had spelled away upon entering. Draco himself hadn’t seemed upset at seeing his house fixed and whole again, and with each passing minute where the fox wasn’t bristling in anger, Harry’s trepidation eased away. It did nothing for his guilt, though, so he stays silent and quietly lets Draco take the lead should he choose to do anything. But curiosity wins in the end so he asks.
Harry thinks he’s comfortable here. No, he knows he’s comfortable here. For once, it’s peaceful. There’s a nice quiet that’s so different from the sickening silence of Grimmauld, and in this place so far from home, he wonders how it’s possible. There’s the sound of insects and the quiet chatter of far away conversations and Harry never wants to leave. Never wants to go back to the rushed life and social obligations waiting back at London. Never wants to leave this feeling of
“Well that explains the attacks. And the ministry is chock full of purebloods,” Owen concludes. “So Radolphus’ goal and the resistance’s goal just happen to align. And we still don’t know what the Dementors are for or where they are. Ugh this is such a mess.”
“Why were you at work on Sunday?”
He buries his face in his hands. “I think I’m getting worse again, Hermione. I don’t even know why I’m upset. And I hurt him too. What if I can’t control it?” His voice turns shaky at the end, tears threatening to spill out. And he remembers how Malfoy had cried and how he has never seen someone so hurt yet angry at the same time. And it was directed at
Luna hums an assent.
There’s a knock on his door. “Harry? Are you in there?” Hermione calls out.
“No buts.” Robards folds his hands neatly and looks Harry straight in the eyes. Harry instinctively stands up straighter. “I’ve also been informed that you may have a certain history with Malfoy, and with all consideration, it may interfere with the investigation.”
But Harry’s not in London right now, and he feels like he’s in the middle of nowhere, at the edge of the world. It’s not hard to imagine, and there’s a novelty in that idea. As if he were suddenly living in a fantasy. But it’s not scary at all, because his friends are still here. Luna lives in Grasmere, one of the speckled lights that dot the close landscape. Ron, Hermione, even Ginny—they’re a bit farther but with magic, they’re just a hop and a skip away.
“Oh. Alright. But—”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRWuY3pV2c
Hermione stays silent, waiting for him to continue.
It’s going to be okay? Nice Harry thinks it’s going to be okay for Draco to die? But no, this Harry is smiling and glaring and Draco doesn’t know which Harry it is anymore. Maybe both want him to die.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “What Draco said?”
“What? What’s the fuck about?” Robards asks, back in commission now.
“They
“Bullshit.”
Harry’s the one making them tea this time, and he listens to Luna’s chatter and the silent pauses in between as he focuses on the tea leaves.
“We also ask you to send Thirty-nine a message if you discover anything with souls,” One declares. “I will also send him personally on occaision to check on Mr. Malfoy’s condition. Know that Malfoy’s healers are aware of our investigation.”
Harry opens his mouth, then closes it. He’s frustrated for sure, but if Hermione had reason to personally ask Robards to bar Harry from the case, who is he to go against it? Of course, that doesn’t mean he has to take it nicely. He spins back around with a sniff.
Harry walks through Grasmere for the first time since Draco’s been found. He doesn’t even realize how long it’s been until he’s walking the familiar streets and admiring the landscape. He misses it, but at the same time, he knows he
But the next chapters will actually clear the air beetween Harry and Draco and I'm excited to get all the baggage out of the way ^-^
, lying there, without his stupid, smug grin or that calm gaze and he has to fix it. He
“Yes, precisely. And being blunt, we’re getting quite desperate. It’s been almost a month since we found out, and we’ve run out of leads. If Malfoy knows anything, we really hope you’d speak now.”
Eventually, Kreacher gets annoyed of his ceaseless pacing and shoves him out of the house with a box of homemade pies. “Master is being in the way of cleaning. Kreacher is asking Master to do his walking somewhere else.” The door slams in his face, and Harry knows this is Kreacher’s way of saying “You’re being annoying. Fuck off and go solve your problems already.”
“God knows how many times I’ve already tried to ask him something only for him to just disappear,” Mike pouts miserably.
And he disappears.
Then Thirty-nine is pushing the door open, and a bright room not unlike the theme of the hallway spreads out before them. It’s not a large room, but it’s white and clean and simple, and there’s an open window letting in a cool breeze. Plants dot the area, and for a moment, Harry forgets where he is, his purpose. He closes his eyes tiredly, and just for a moment, Harry’s somewhere new, at the edge of the world, looking down at the sky.
“We suspect he was going to be kissed or may have been kissed,” Thirty-nine says. “And then in a last-ditch effort, he tried to produce a wandless patronus.”
Nothing.
Harry puts the alphabet paper back in front of the fox.
* * *
At this point, he’s simply yelling back whatever pops first into his mind, and nothing makes sense. What’s his argument? Why’s this wrong? Why’s it all wrong?
gotten the fuck out. His instincts knew if he didn’t, Malfoy would have cursed him straight out of town. It was a good thing too, perhaps. An hour later, buried back under his covers at Ron and Hermione’s house, he knows he was in the wrong. Even if he was angry, he shouldn’t have grabbed Malfoy. Shouldn’t have flaunted Malfoy’s own mark in front of him. Something so evil. Something that was supposed to be in the past. He wallows in his guilt.
* * *
“No,” Hermione sighs. “They all had masks and illusion charms. The aurors won’t release any information either. Everything’s just a huge mess right now.”
“Ah, that’s good I guess. I wasn’t sure how you’d take it. Maybe I was expecting you to get angry.”
“It’s okay, I’ll take you there some time,” he says back to the doe. And then he says to his other friends, “Draco wanted to see the moat and booby traps.”
much more elegant than his own callused hands. Perfect for that flowy handwriting, he thinks.
Hermione nods. “I can understand that. Well whatever works for you is fine. Don’t stress it.”
“Draco, you’ve seen Luna?”
She makes it sound so simple, and for Harry, that’s enough for now. One step at a time. It’s simple.
“Yes, Hermione, I’m awake. What’s going on?”
And while these are supposed to be reassurances to their renewed friendship, Harry can’t shake the guilt that’s been stalking him since his epiphany. He’s always been an angry, frustrated person. He’s quick to anger, slow to appease. When he forgives, he doesn’t forget. So when Draco forgives and forgets in the span of one day and one night, Harry doesn’t process it.
“Well, anything
“Harry,” Luna intones.
looked at me like I was crazy!”
The next few days, Harry pushes just a bit more. He inserts some noninvasive questions into his conversations, and while Malfoy answers in short phrases, he doesn’t speak more. At first, Harry’s a bit exasperated. But then he can’t care less, because talking like this is fun and he forgets that the point of visiting Draco is to interrogate him in the end. So he goes home every night with a well of Draco’s likes and hobbies and nothing of his ordeal at all.
“Oh shut up. You try walking and holding this paper in front of your face and holding a conversation all at the same time. Anyways, you
“Maybe you left too quickly last time, mate,” Ron adds after a moment. “Give it a chance this time, yeah?”
“Treacle tart?” Harry asks tentatively.
“Yeah. Thought you’d like to know.”
Baker starts pacing. “The war was supposed to get rid of all this pureblood supremacy. But guess the fuck what? It
Now to find out that all along, Malfoy has been hiding away in some small rural town—probably having fun frolicking among the plants and trees with Luna—Harry can not and will not get over it. And indeed, he is still fuming two days later when a file lands on his desk regarding a sudden attack in the otherwise peaceful Grasmere.
Ron nods. “Be right down.” Then turning back to Harry, “Sorry mate, work calls.”
“Okay, okay, we’ll go. Let’s go. Just let me go grab my jacket.”
Sorry, I know I'm real bad at updating regularly, but I've been trying to figure out some key plot points.
With more range of motion now, he slowly explores the room. The floor and walls are all made of rough concrete, and as he trails his hands in the air, he finds that there is no other furniture either; just the chair. The only bit of light coming into the room seems to be from the tiny window in the door, and when Draco jumps to try to look out of it, all he sees is an opposing wall a few feet away.
And Harry only looks helplessly at her as he feels his hands and feet start to jitter under the table. Ron quickly grabs his hand and gives a reaffirming squeeze.
“Are you saying I’m not trying? That I need to help fix the world?”
Sleep’s almost won when the coolness shifts and turns. Harry hums and cracks an eye down at the fox. Large silver eyes look up at him.
“Luna’s fine. She’s still making those terrible cookies. She tested them out on me when you were gone,” he pouts.
“Anyways,” Ron cuts him off and gives him a pointed look. “I’m not going to question your sudden recurring interest in Malfoy, assuming we’re both responsible adults. But try to keep that temper in check, yeah?”
he did wrong, well, Luna won’t tell him and Hermione won’t tell him, so he’s left to figure it out for himself.
“Yeah, I guess. I just never really thought about it. Since I always see you in the room.”
“Is it beautiful?”
* * *
A bit drunk now, Ron scooches back to Hermione, swinging an arm around her shoulder and squeezing her close. “So, got any insight, ’mione? Help these poor souls decipher Luna’s message?”
“Ah right. Might as well. Let me go grab a coffee and then we’ll head out.”
. He stares and stares and stares, and he’s
If Draco senses the turmoil rolling off of him, he certainly gives no indication. Instead, Harry only watches as Draco sprints and jumps through the air, observing the fox as if to strip the mist down to pure thoughts and rational. And if Draco starts taking the decreasingly rare moments where Harry’s silent and thinking to cautiously perch on his head or shoulders, well, Harry lets him.
“No, just,” Harry huffs, “you, you’re running away! The world’s a mess and you just disappear and instead you’re here prancing among the flowers—”
“We don’t have to do anything in particular,” Luna reiterates. “Being with people you like is perfectly fine.”
A doe.
Harry looks up at the hole in the roof—at the hole he’s sworn has shrunk since his last visit with Luna.
* * *
Malfoy is openly glaring now, his arms crossed across his chest. “And why is this my problem? Why should I have to do it? I’m perfectly fine where I am, Potter. I don’t see the world flipping out over it.”
Harry had hastily agreed and exited the ministry, eager to get away from all of Hermione’s coworkers’ judging stares. Yet the moment he had stepped out of the wretched building, Robards’ patronus had popped up, yelling about a pixie infestation.
He huffs and watches as Luna continues her scribbling while mouthing words under her breath. He catches “drunk,” “suppresses rational thought,” and “prefrontal cortex” before tuning her out. She’s not paying attention so he refuses to pay attention.
Yet even while he’s being roughly shoved up and bundled out into the hall with the blindfold back on, Draco’s mind is whirring. He jumps between his fear and his curiosity and he almost misses the pop of apparition. Shit, well, if they’re moving him, it’d only be harder to find him—if anyone was looking in the first place. But still, he thinks. The Ministry had wiped Azkaban of Dementors, and at the time, that had been that. He supposes he hadn’t really considered what had happened to the Dementors themselves. But in some way, he knows where they are now—with the resistance—and it’s not a happy thought. What were they doing with Dementors?
Lol honestly I don't know what to think about what I just wrote. Also, it's so much easier for me to write Draco than Harry??? I think it's just because I feel closer to Draco lmao. Anger for Harry is just so much harder for me big rips.
Malfoy. The one that’s quiet and collected and is currently looking at him with a detached gaze.
George turns to Harry, eyes wide. “A girl? Harry, you’re a girl?”
Draco stares at him for a while. Then looks away thoughtfully.
He freezes. He lets himself still and continues his slow breathing, and until Draco notices that he’s awake, he simply watches the fox play with his hair. It takes a few minutes, but eventually, the fox stops nosing at his mess to curl up on Harry’s chest and stare. Harry stares back.
Luna stands and looks around for a while, then looks at Harry. She doesn’t say anything and it unnerves him, because he really thinks she’s somehow found a way to look through his soul and into the depths of his regret.
But his mother’s here right now and she’s petting his hair and combing through it. She’s whispering those sweet nothings again. Reassurance that no, Draco, I don’t hate you. Will always love you.
And while the question is phrased and said quite simply, Harry knows that when Luna asks something, one doesn’t just refuse. So he manages out a “sure,” and follows her miserably out the door.
dead all messed up like this. Yet the white-blond hair waves gently in the breeze, and wrapped up in bandages and blankets like this, Harry thinks Malfoy rather fits. He fits in this place that’s like Heaven on Earth.
Everyone gathers around Robards enlarged table, and Harry takes a look around, noting the four Aurors and the three Unspeakables present. He doesn’t recognize any of the aurors, and why there are Unspeakables, he has no clue. He’s never seen them take part in a case before, and to say that they are now can't mean anything good.
And Harry realizes just how much life has burdened him. How he’s always stressed over
“There’s nothing to be angry over. And I’m not even that close with him.” A pause. “So I don’t really know how I feel. It’s just… empty.” He makes a vague gesture in the air.
“It’s Thai food. But yes I did get a treacle tart. Thank your savior.”
“Your test cookies?” Then, “Wait, the cookies from last time?”
Baker’s yelling and spitting everywhere at this point, and Draco’s starting to realize that he’s really, truly, run out of luck this time. Not only is Baker acting like a deranged, well, criminal, he’s spewing some nonsense that has Draco’s senses telling him he’s in some bigger shit than he initially thought.
Coffee forgotten, he stumbles back to his sleeping bag to stare blankly at the ceiling. He stares long enough that the first rays of gray sunlight are peaking through the window before he realizes.
Harry thanks the gods for Kreacher’s slightly-creepy intuition for making Ron bring him a sleeping bag and more blankets. He had been dreading the idea of sleeping on the floor again. Ron himself had left right after dinner, but not before promising to come back the next morning with breakfast and anything else Harry might need for his indefinite stay.
The man takes that as a no; not that he’s wrong. “I’m disappointed. What happened to daddy’s boy? Where’s the ‘My father will hear about this?’”
“But why is his patronus here?” Ron continues, and everyone turns with questioning eyes.
“Potter,” Malfoy’s voice is gentle now. Shaky, but gentler. “Even if I try, I
Anyways here's my song rec this time!
And he can’t control it anymore. Because the
Harry suddenly realizes that she’s treating him like a baby, and frustrated, he immediately flips over. “I’m not a baby!”
“Okay okay fine. The healers are actually stuck up, prejudiced people who don’t give a shit about the Malfoys. But let them do their job! God knows how hard it is to deal with whining customers.” Harry has to strain to hear that last bit, but he hears it nonetheless.
Draco allows himself a small whine. “Fine. Stay with me?”
, and then suddenly I hear that cursed alarm going off in the aurors’ department, and next thing you know, there’s a stampede going down the hall and insane amounts of screaming like you wouldn’t believe—”
Harry relaxes back into his chair and contents himself to listening to Luna talk and eating his treacle tarts. That's the thing with Luna. She always seems to know how Harry is feeling. And instead of questioning him, she rambles about whatever she wishes, allowing Harry to drift between her words and his thoughts, not settling on any particular thing.
Saturday dawns golden and misty, and Harry revels in the slanted beams of sunlight that filter through the clouds and into the sky-room. Everything’s white and grey and gold, and for a while, he simply allows himself to be fascinated by the dust motes floating through the air. Eventually though, he drags himself up to begin the day’s work.
But Harry understands he thinks. Just a little. That want to have the pristine peace and calm back. That want to fix what was already perfect. He wants it back.
He’s aware of part of the problem though. He doubts his sudden outburst and shredding of paper would be fine with anyone, much less Draco, someone he’s still technically on shaky terms with and was just starting to build a budding friendship with. But he’d
“You know,” Luna pipes up, eyes never leaving the cookies, “we did learn in school that alihotsy is used for laughing potions. But I figured that if I could tweak it just so, it would help with depression and the like.”
Harry gapes and splutters. “But y-you always asked me about the plants. And I asked.” With wide eyes, he takes in Luna’s serene smile and Draco’s pokerface. Except the corner of the fox’s mouth is tilting up and the tail is wagging.
Harry drags his hands slowly down his face. “Ah, I feel so stupid now.”
* * *
- Not sure how many chapters this will be or how often I will update
or else that floating feeling will return and Harry will really lose something and not just imagine it.
“Would you like some tea as the cookies cool down?”

have a moat. Or booby traps.”
He’s halfway through the second book when Ron apparates into the room with a bang and a pop. Harry’s so invested in his reading at this point that he yelps and bangs his head against the wall behind him. Then he looks up with a frustrated glare.
“Here.” He holds it up so that it’s in front of Draco.
Draco dips his head. And the flames die down.
“Go away!” he screams. “Go away! Please, please I’ll do anything. Just go away!”
With a fond eye roll, Harry sets off. They walk the familiar streets, under that familiar sky, and suddenly, Harry feels a semblance of calm. Here, in this small town reserved for Luna and Malfoy, he can pretend nothing has changed. That he’s here to visit Luna and quarrel with Malfoy in that homey kitchen, where fights mean nothing more than a gentle tease.
A pause.
He’s just talking Victor through the reports back at the office when Robards and a small group of Aurors and Unspeakables walk by. He ignores them at first, but then one of them whispers “Malfoy” and suddenly, Harry’s all ears. Grabbing Victor’s shoulder, he ignores the startled look and whispers urgently.
“Hey, long time no see,” Thirty-nine calls, when they meet in the cafe that’s taken up residence in a corner of the Ministry lobby.
“See you!”
“And who are you to tell me that?”
“So…”
And he laughs. He laughs and laughs until there’s tears at the edge of his eyes, and he wonders why he’s laughing so hard. But this is Malfoy, and of course Malfoy would do extensive research on architecture and construction just to fix his house. No one in their right minds would go to such lengths, and yet, here’s Malfoy doing just that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYHNdTPV7pM
“Draco?”
But the gate opens smoothly as always, and as soon as Harry’s through, they freeze. Luna’s kneeling on the ground covered in dirt and leaves with a shovel in one hand and a plant in the other, and even though Harry’s surprised, he guesses he shouldn’t be.
miss it. He’s been with Draco from day one, and being with Draco was as good as being in Grasmere. And he comes to the sudden understanding that perhaps his ties to this place has always been Draco, Draco, Draco.
“I… promise not to yell.”
. And every night, he goes back to fend off reports and “suggestions” from his fellow Auroras and Unspeakables and then to spend a sleepless night crying and thinking and thinking and thinking.
“Wait wait, let me get another piece of paper.” Harry quickly conjures another one, and when he’s properly set with his pen in hand, Malfoy carefully starts nosing at the paper.
And with a wave and a spin, she disappears down the street. Harry stands there for a while, still dazed, before looking down at the small package in his hands. Time to brew some tea.
For a moment, Harry is in shock. Then he snaps right back at the presumptive woman. “That’s a lame ass excuse and you know it. Just shut it until your fucking administration actually starts caring about your patients’ privacy.” Ignoring her indignant sputtering, he storms into the lifts and follows his memory to where Malfoy’s room is.
Harry raises his eyebrows. Right. He’d almost forgotten that Malfoy’s friends with Luna.
* * *
A cold tingle passes through his arm, and he looks up to see Draco sitting back on his hind legs, a paw raised in the air as if to swipe at Harry.
Hello hello hello! Here's my song rec this time!
“Hold on, hold on, you’re saying the resistance wants to get rid of the purebloods?” He hears gasps.
taking a break from work? Is the sky falling? Quick, check!”
“Er, yeah, but that’s not—I’m not—”
“We say we found them all soul-less, but really, we found everyone soul-less except Malfoy.” Gale practically bounces in her seat with anticipation.
It’s strange how quickly Harry reverts back to his sixth-year habits of stalking Malfoy. Only, this time around, Malfoy is really missing and Harry doesn’t have a map to point him. It’s all just ink on crinkled paper and the empty whispers of a man hated and lost.
She throws the shovel hazardly away and skips over. She skids to a stop a foot away from them.
Kreacher mumbles and shoots him glares the entire time Harry’s there. Yet with all the complaining, food and drink are set before him at regular intervals and Harry almost wants to curl up and cry. His life is empty yet full. His house is devoid of life and yet he lives. The shadows haunt him, and in that moment, he appreciates that Kreacher at least cares.
When Harry doesn’t elaborate, the fox sniffs delicately and settles down, attempting to dig into the bed sheets that aren’t actually moving.
They all laugh at that one, and Harry hears a third person in the background that can only be Hermione. Then Luna settles besides him, giving a grin of her own. “I really liked the dragon one,” she says.
It’s another hour or so before Harry suddenly recalls his lunch with Luna. By all means, he hadn’t intended to forget, but it was as if another veil had lifted from his mind and everything’s finally as clear as day. He sends a patronus off to Luna to inform her of this new development while snippets of words and conversation pour through his thoughts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3FVfge7Ao
Point is, Harry really doesn’t know how or why he started calling Malfoy—and all the other Slytherins for that matter—by their last names. Just imagining his eleven-year-old self, strutting around yelling last names like they had weight has him cringing. Maybe Malfoy—no, Draco now—wasn’t the only prat in school. Harry groans and ducks to hide his face in his hands. He’s getting secondhand embarrassment for
By now, they’re at the front gate, and Luna turns to look at him. “You can’t take it away. Do you understand?”
Draco asks one day.
“I just want—” He hiccups. “I just want some peace. And I’m gonna get it.”
Hermione moves into focus. “No, shush, Ron. I’m sure if Harry were a girl, he—or she’d—tell us, right?”
“The attacks are related to the revolt?”
Malfoy appears a few times throughout the afternoon; usually after something Harry’s said, so he figures Malfoy
But mostly, he’s just scared. Because feeling empty and not-grounded means he’s also isolated. And when he falls into that downward spiral, he can’t get out. While he knows Ron and Hermione have and will always be there, he walks his path of anger alone. And the farther he walks, the more he realizes that he
“Dementors must’ve kissed the lot of them,” adds David.
It takes all of the next day for Harry to finish fixing the roof. He feels just a bit guilty for not listening to Hermione, but he’s already done so much. Would it hurt to just finish what he started? He’ll take responsibility for his actions anyways. If he isn’t sure of anything else, he’s now sure of this one thing. He’ll take responsibility.
Malfoy sleeps on.
Harry racks his brain desperately for a safe topic. But with the war being taboo and their Hogwarts days full of taunts and schemes, there
Logically, he knows it’s not a big deal. Really, truely. If he won’t believe himself, at least he’ll believe the therapist Hermione tried so hard for him to get. He was fine just a moment ago, but now he’s not, and Harry can’t control it, can’t control it. But he can’t help it because it’s stupid, the world is stupid, and he really really needs something to hold on to so his hands will stop their godamn shaking.
child and indoor friendly—unlike the ones we launched at Umbridge back in the day of course.”
“Mike. Junior Aurora.”
The dog disappears in a wisp of silver smoke, and Harry just stands there. When he finally turns back to walk up the stairs, the otter is gone too. Alone again. Alone again with his thoughts.
He hears nothing all morning and into the early afternoon, so he takes Victor along on some minor cases to a local park, then someone’s house, and then a muggle museum where a niffler had gone loose. But he’s distracted the entire time, so he lets Victor take the lead. Excuses aside, he tells himself it’s good experience for the lad.
have done. Should have been able to. He wishes he could. And it’s not exactly the frustration he would usually have felt at such a thought. He’s… sad. And tired. That’s it.
It’s with trepidation that he enters Draco’s room that day. He’s not excited for another day of apologies and crying per se, but it’s something that must be done, and Harry really would like to fix this thing with Draco. But yesterday had done nothing, and the idea of starting over is crushing yet sobering.
“Alright. But visit Hermione some time will you? You know how she worries.”
Each room he passes dumps its amount of frustration on Harry’s growing pile, and soon enough, he’s shaking with the effort to keep calm, to not punch his fist straight through the nearest wall. He’s resolved to keep Malfoy’s house dry, and he can’t keep his barrier up if he leaves, and god dammit if he has to sit and do nothing for who-knows-how-long for the rain to stop.
Here's a song I really love ^-^:
Once, he imagines Harry sitting across from him. Harry, with his green eyes glaring at him behind glasses and messy hair. Hair he wishes he could comb his hand through, just for the sake of it. But no, this image of Harry he imagines is mad at him, and it’s the last memory of him he has. That fuming expression when Draco had tried to tell him he’d tried. He’d tried so hard.
Malfoy frowns, just a slight downturn of his mouth, and still not looking at Harry. “Then why are you here?”
He doesn’t want to go back to that. Back to that dread and suffering. It was suffocating. He’d finally built himself a life, a home, and for a while, it’d been his own corner of bliss. But of course, nothing gold can stay.
He almost falls asleep again when the cold tingle moves. Then there’s a cool drizzle on his face, and Harry startles awake. Silver eyes stare down.
“My plants are fine. Same as I told you last time. The nargles have been keeping away too.”
“Wha—what?”
And when the fox finally comes to settle down on the couch next to Harry, the air's long been receiving his yawns and his reports have all been sealed and sent on their way. With Draco once again clinging to his shoulder, he stands and gets ready for bed. His routine comes methodically, and he wonders the whole time through what the fox is going to do. Grimmauld can’t be more fun at night than St. Mungo’s, and he’s sure a sleeping Harry or Kreacher wouldn’t provide for much entertainment.
“Let yourself in, the door’s open,” she says. “I’m in the middle of baking some alihotsy, and it does require the utmost attention, I’m afraid.”
“Oh you’ll see soon enough,” is the answer. At Harry’s constipated expression, Luna laughs brightly. “Don’t worry, it’s not that far. It’s a small town afterall.”
Harry spends the next few days throwing himself into auror missions and spending a record amount of time at Hermione and Ron’s place. It’s to the point where his friends simply offer him their guest room, which he takes gratefully. Harry knows they want to question him, ask if he’s ok, but they know by now to give Harry time to gather his thoughts and categorize where exactly everything stands in his life at the moment.
, and he imagines himself as Draco. He runs through their Hogwarts years. He looks at Hogwarts, their school, their home, and he sees himself put proudly in Slytherin, making friends, and making childish jabs at Harry, Hermione, and Ron. He sees the pranks, the hexes, the name-calling, and he does them all.
Harry feels like he’s drifting. Drifting aimlessly and floating on clouds. Except it’s really not as nice as it sounds, because he’s also lost. There’s a void in his chest he doesn’t know how to fill and nothing he thinks of feels right. He needs to be grounded, he knows. But he’s known that for the past twenty-one years of his life and nothing has changed, so why would it be any different now?
He staggers back to the chair and slumps down in it. It’s a rickety old thing, made of wood and probably on the verge of collapse. A fitting throne for the damned. How fate must be laughing at him.
The morning’s still young, and since Harry had arrived at St. Mungo’s promptly at 8, there’s time. So much time. But he doesn’t know where to start with Malfoy, so he’s been sitting here doing nothing for the past hour, and he can tell that Malfoy’s starting to get bored. He rolls around on the bed, whines silently out the window at the birds and trees, and occasionally prances through the air around the room, giving Harry a wide berth.
Harry sits up, shoving his blankets to one side. He looks down and picks at his fingers and the loose threads. “I insulted him,” he whispers quietly. “I said he doesn’t try. I said he’d always be a Death Eater.”
“Radolphus? He’s the prick who tried to shut down our Department years ago. He has yet to be forgiven,” the head Unspeakable seeths. Eleven and Thirty-nine nod along solemnly.
Harry ponders that. Draco doesn't have a mind? If he doesn't have a mind, how is he thinking? How is he communicating like this with Harry? How is he still very much, well, in his mind? Besides that, he's sure he's seen Draco dozing plenty of times on his bed or on top of his own chest.
Harry blinks. “Oh, I didn’t think of that.”

Hello! Just in case you didn't catch the summary, this is my first actual fanfic!
He goes back an hour and a coffee trip later, and he sits with the cooling beverage in his hand, staring off at the wall, out the window, at Malfoy. He talks occasionally. About anything and everything, and all of it is mindless chatter to fill the silence and maybe to get Malfoy to show up.
“Noted. We’ll look into any connections.”
Anyways, point is:
Harry continues to stare, and there’s turmoil in his chest and he’s trying to decide if it’s guilt or pity or something else. Malfoy looks dead. Harry doesn’t understand how he
Harry feels Malfoy raise a metaphorical eyebrow.
But Harry, it was and always is Harry. It’s Harry he looks for, Harry he worries over, and Harry he silently cheers for in the safe confines of his mind. In his dreams, it’s Harry who rescues him, Harry who smiles at him, Harry who saves him from the depths of his despair.
“Oh.”
“He didn’t get the kiss?”
No, focus. Step one, survey the damage. He rushes forward, dropping heavily to his knees besides the person. Now, look for injuries and check for a pulse and—
“H-E-L-L-O,” Harry mumbles as he writes. “Hello!” He grins at the fox.
“So, I’ll get straight to business,” Thirty-nine says. “You’ve told me that Mr. Malfoy here changed form some time between last night and this morning, and you can now hear his thoughts?”
Time passes slowly, or quickly. It’s not worth counting days by meals, he knows, because kidnappers really don’t care to be on time. He’s given food at random intervals, and in between, he dozes, daydreams, and tries to keep himself entertained. The only other person he sees is the person who delivers his food. He thinks it’s the same person anyways. The clothes are similar at least. Probably.
“I will not have you here just to insult me, Potter. Get the fuck out.”
A fox.
Hello! I orginally meant to post like every week but that didn't happen and the chapter's shorter than I would've liked TT^TT

The window curtain flutters.
Draco tilts his head and Luna gives Harry a secret grin. “But if you really want to do something, well, Draco what do you want to do?”
It’s still dark outside so he grumbles, but nevertheless gives the otter his full attention. It’s not often Hermione uses her patronus. When he turns to look at it, the otter finally stills and speaks.
In the end, it was Baker who suddenly popped by and shooed the Dementor away with a wave of his wand. Baker simply stood and looked down with his usual disdain at Draco, who, by now, was filthy and ragged and really couldn’t care less about what Baker was planning to do.
Another while later, there’s the clinking of the door rattling and opening. A person walks in towards him, and Draco tenses. They must have some kind of obscuring spell charmed on them, because when he tries to look at their face, it’s a mess of mist and blurred colors. Occasionally, he’ll get a solid glimpse, but the moment he flicks his eyes away, the images are forgotten, leaving him with a vague sense of discomfort and unease.
. He apologizes and apologizes until his voice is hoarse and scratchy and the tears have drenched his sleeves.
“You ha—” Then a muted thud as he crashes into a wall.
But this belief is interesting, because Malfoy’s writing is smooth and flowy. Harry thinks back to his last encounters with Malfoy, and eventually decides that perhaps it’s justified. Malfoy’s strangely soft now, and who’s he to decide if smooth handwriting describes him or not? He doesn’t know this Malfoy anymore. He certainly knows the Malfoy from Hogwarts, however, and if he had had this flowy handwriting back then too, well... Harry would think about that later if it ever comes up. Yet for now, Harry simply wonders if he will ever calm down enough for his handwriting to smooth over—to achieve that peace where every word need not be rushed; where nothing needs to be rushed.
Harry nods, still shaking.
“Always.”
“...What?”
Harry gives out a low whistle as he stares at what was once a quaint cottage, not unlike Luna’s. Except now, all the windows and doors are shattered and half the roof is gone from presumably an explosion of some sort. He casts a few charms, just to make sure the building wouldn’t be in any danger of collapsing should he enter. Satisfied, he turns back.
“Yes, Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy.”
Also, online school is actually stressful?? And all my college decisions came back and oh man those were not good.
WARNING: There are a few sensitive topics later in this chapter, but there's nothing graphic I think so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“It is? Nobody told me that.”
see again, there are ears flicking in front of his chest. He screams and flinches himself away and almost into the fireplaces.
“Hm, Baker, okay. Did you happen to catch any specifics of his appearance?” Owen asks.
“R-right.”
But under that late morning sun, Harry swears he sees something like two speckled ears that are decidedly un-fox-like flicking on top of the cloud.
“No?”
Here's one I love TT^TT
Harry sees how that could be a problem. Obviously, not much is known about an ejected soul, and Malfoy’s the first.
Baker’s voice suddenly lashes out, and Draco flinches. “So, made your decision, Malfoy?”
Harry gets through the entirety of one book before his stomach rumbles. He looks up blankly at the sky, and to his disappointment, it’s still raining. It doesn’t hit him that that’s actually a problem though, before his stomach rumbles again. And now he
Luna grins a bit before busying herself. They drink their tea in silence, and Harry flounders between panic and mild confusion. What is a person even supposed to say after such an announcement? Luna obviously has her reasons for whatever strange thing she’s always doing, and Harry really doesn’t know if he should read more into it or not.
“The blood of halfbloods and muggleborns flowed to save us! Not save you! We died for a better society! Not for the continuation of a flawed peace at the hands of people like you! There’s a blood debt the purebloods owe us, and we’re invoking it.”
“You did?” Harry asks, pleasantly surprised. “I really meant it, I’m sorry, I don’t know how much you heard—”
Draco gives an eye roll and shakes himself out before resettling. Harry huffs out a laugh in response and thumps his head back. He stares at the ceiling.
and—and I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. I’m sorry if I was rude or anything, was I rude? I’m—”
But Harry knows he’s only running away. He’s trying; he’s trying so hard to try and stuff Malfoy into the imaginary cabinet labeled “acquaintance.” But it doesn’t fit—
Harry starts to lower his hand.
But now that leaves Harry with the problem of having too much time on his hands. Time to overthink, to relive, to dig himself into the bottomless pit of despair and anger. He needs to be busy, to do something to distract himself.
Harry considers it for a moment, then nods hesitantly.
“I’m not! I’m just trying to help find him—”
* * *
He glances at Draco, and the fox tilts his head but otherwise makes no other movement.
“You see us as our patronus? Do you see mine?”
It’s late in the afternoon when Harry finally decides he should probably just leave and give Malfoy some space and come back tomorrow. He’s propping his head up on his arms on the bed, trying to convince himself to leave this heaven-like room. The window’s letting in yellowing rays of light now, and the room is bathed in a golden hue. From silver to gold, Harry thinks, watching Malfoy’s hair flutter around. Fascinating.
Harry nods.
“Mate,” Ron sighs, “Malfoy was injured. And you know the healers are trying their best—”
It doesn’t ring a bell, but Draco stays silent anyways, making sure his face is as blank as he can possibly make it.
It’s Harry’s turn to pause. Is she friends with Malfoy? “Are… you friends with him?” he asks tentatively.
But really, there’s no use in dwelling in fantasies and false hopes when he could just confirm for himself. So he flips open the cover with his eyes squeezed shut and quickly cracks one eye open at the first page. And it’s blank.

“So what?” A quiet reply.
So under the vast sky with stars he’s never seen before, in this town at the edge of the world, he doesn’t feel lonely at all.
“Okay, wait, hold on,” Harry voices his—and well, Draco’s apparently—concerns. “The last I checked, you guys did
“Thirty-nine wants to see us at the Ministry tomorrow morning,” he tells Draco.
Luna puts a sudden arm on Harry’s arm. “Harry, we can’t hear Draco.”
There are few guards in this place, and occasionally, one will pace down the hall outside his cell, sneering at him with their patronuses trotting or swimming after them. Draco envies them. He envies their freedom and their bare arms and their magic. The only time he feels something other than despair is that infuriating frustration at his lack of magic. Since having his wand taken away, and given his government-issued wand that does the bare minimum, he’s never taken magic for granted. He misses the warmth underneath his fingers, that thrill of magic and smoothness that flows through him when a complicated spell goes right.
She grins back. “Now, since it
of calm and grace. Harry lets his eyes roam, taking in the figure slumped down in his oversized hoodie, hair ungelled with strands caught floating in the air. The grey eyes, once piercing, are now quiet like the rest of their owner. They glance up, and Harry flinches, averting his gaze to watch as Luna carries over tea and biscuits.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been existing in this dark plane of existence before he feels a blindfold being ripped off his face. His head is whipped to side at the force of it, and with another realization, he accepts that these are cruel people. That, or they just hate him.
Anyways, MAY THE FLUFF—and more angst still sadly—COMENCE HENCEFORTH
“Yes, Robards,” Harry sighs.
He shuffles to his chair, and glancing at Draco’s face on the pillow, he bows his head silently. He doesn’t know how long he sits, zoning out, when he finally lifts his head to get rid of the cricks in his neck. And there, on the windowsill, is the small misty form of Draco’s fox.
Harry Potter,
Harry himself had wondered a great deal about Malfoy’s whereabouts. While some part of Harry still thought of Malfoy as the Hogwarts git, the rest of him had been too tired to care. So why did he care? Harry supposed it was jealousy. He was jealous that Malfoy got to escape the world. That
Hihihihi! Ahaha what's up people! School's almost out oh god I'm so excited. I've been super stressed this past month or so due to homework and ap exams and oh god.

In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed this chapter!

But Draco isn’t slowing down and only seems to be getting more furious with every passing second, and Harry finally reaches out and shreds the paper. He tears it into halves and more halves, and because his fingers are still jittery, he crumples the pieces together and chucks the ball out the window as hard as he can.
He’s just sitting now, letting his voice rest and thinking that maybe he’s beyond forgiveness. Perhaps he’s gone too far this time and there’s really no turning back. It’s a terrifying thought. It’s like dying.
Ron decides for him that it’s impossible to get a straight answer out of Luna, ever. Having been comforted out of his mood, they drink to that. All the while, Hermione sits on the other side of their pile of food, watching with a knowing and exasperated smile.
never had a choice.
He pockets the notebook.
, a pause,
He hopes that her plants haven’t died. He can’t bear the idea of Luna coming home to find that her beloved work and pets have withered. He doesn’t want her last impression to be of a Draco who can’t even keep a simple promise. He hopes she knows he tried. He hopes she knows he’s sorry. For everything. Truly.
to be out there, and do what? Help the masses? Who are you kidding?!”
Harry nods. Slumping down next to Malfoy to wait it out, he lets his emotions simmer, feeling the pent up anger turn into a sad, sad resignation.
“Yeah,” Harry sighs. “But something happened when he got kidnapped, and now Draco is actually a patronus, so…”
Draco and Harry look at each other.
“And we didn’t actually find any Dementors ourselves,” Mike cuts in. “We only found all the prisoners soul-less.”
He looks back at Malfoy again, but this time with the intent of work. He scans the body, and he’s confused because what does an ejected soul look like? He was told it was a patronus? There are no patronuses.
When he opens his eyes again, the room is bathed in golds and greys and a darkening purple. He sits up slowly, groaning and trying to shrug the stiffness out of his neck and shoulders. Malfoy’s body still looks the same, suffering and painful but less pale than before. Or maybe that’s just the lighting. And he looks soft. So soft.

Left I mean.”
“I’m taking care of your plants, Draco,” Luna tells the fox.
When no one answers, Robards turns back to Harry. “As you know, Mr. Malfoy was abducted about a week ago in Grasmere. Luna Lovegood reported him missing when she did not find him upon her return from Brazil. We intended to keep the entire thing quiet for now due to… public misconceptions. However, Rita Skeeter found out anyways, hence that article.” Everyone grimaces. Nobody at the Ministry was a fan of Skeeter. It was a miracle she was still employed even with all the complaints.
Malfoy’s lying in the bed, still and breathing, and unrecognizable if not for that shock of blond hair. When the head Unspeakable had diagnosed Malfoy with an ejected soul, that was all Harry had expected: an ejected soul. So he’s not at all prepared when he looks at Malfoy, bruised and battered with bandages wrapped around him so he’s almost like a mummy. He’s gotten skinnier as well, and Harry feels the sudden urge to reach out and run his hands over Malfoy’s hands and arms. There are heavy eyebags under Malfoy’s eyes, and suddenly Harry realizes that this here lies a fragile man; a fragile boy.
gotten more. And that’s if Draco wants him back. If this even works.
“Oh.”
The fox nods and flicks its tail, and though it makes no sound, Harry knows: “
Harry lets out a small laugh. He’s too spent for retorts now. Too tired. Too old.
“So um, I want to know what’s going on.” He phrases it like a question. When no one says anything, he continues cautiously. “Why is this a top-secret case, and what happened to Malfoy? Ron and Hermione told me he’s being isolated at St. Mungos?”
At that, Harry and the doe sit up straight.
And now, he’s back to pouring over Malfoy’s diagrams, following the instructions as he slowly gets the boards and tiles down by hand. It’s a slow and tiring process, but there’s satisfaction in feeling his hands physically create something. He thinks he could get used to this feeling.
He glances frantically away from Baker, and for a second, he thinks he sees Harry standing next to him. It’s just a glimpse, but Harry’s there, and he’s glaring and he’s mad and it’s almost like he’s challenging Draco. Challenging him to do wrong. To be a disappointment. Draco shudders, and against his will, a few tears leak out of his eyes. He’s hyperventilating now, and he gasps, even as he cries harder. There’s no way to express his fear, and it’s so so scary.
He sticks out a hand towards Malfoy, even though he knows there will be no hand-shaking today. “Hello, I’m Harry. Harry Potter. And you are?”
Harry returns to work Monday morning sleep deprived and jittery. He’s had about four cups of coffee already and he desperately wants to know what happened to Malfoy. But when he steps into the Auror department, everything’s operating smooth as can be and there’s no indication of the chaos Hermione had described. He tries asking around in the breakroom, but everyone he talks to seem to be either confused or just give him funny looks. So he stops and goes back to his work, keeping his ears peeled anyway for even the slightest mention of Malfoy.
But then again, it’s not like he can just tell Draco to turn back into the fox he’s come to know and love. So he lies on his side and watches the doe try to twist its neck to look back at itself in between the periods of darkness that means he’s succumbed to sleep.
He doesn’t think he’s crying for the right reason though. He figures most people who cry when someone they know gets abducted is crying because they’re either happy—since it’s Malfoy and all—or they’re worried for the person. Is he worried over Malfoy? He really doesn’t know. He doesn’t think so at least. But he hates not knowing exactly what he’s feeling so he turns in early for the night and overthinks in the comfort of his blankets rather than the kitchen.
“I’m the Chosen One! The one person that the whole fucking world relies on to save its ass every time something goes wrong!”
“Now? What happened?”
While he’s… happy—and a bit excited he supposes—that Draco’s a doe now, he certainly misses the fox’s smaller form. If only so Draco could curl up again beside him, on his chest, by his hair. He wouldn’t really be able to feel it either way, but it’s the thought that matters; the thought.
After that shocking revelation, Harry had jumped more readily into the discussion, determined to find a way to see for himself just how Malfoy’s doing. He’d argued, and in the end, Robards and the Auroras granted him temporary but limited access to the Aurora Department, given he already knew the case. However, he is to strictly follow orders and barred from actual field work. The only thing really worth noting is his newfound permission to visit Malfoy with the purpose of extracting information.
But Draco and Luna could be sixteen again and running through the grounds of Hogwarts like they all
Here's one for this chapter (^-^):
Draco rolls his eyes and huffs.
“Okay, well, despite this… unanticipated piece of information, we have a reason for calling.”
, and it was only after joining the aurors that he realized the extent of its reach. Heck, there are still branches of the government he hasn’t discovered yet. Besides, why would someone want to overthrow the Ministry? It wasn’t the perfect system, but there have been pushes for reform, led by none other than Hermione. And reform has never been a quick overnight thing.
“So? Your answer?”
“Well, certainly not. I was in the middle of writing an article about blibbering humdingers. But seeing as you’re my friend, I think I can squeeze in some time.” She sits down at the small table and gazes serenely up at him.
“Dementors? Didn’t the Ministry get rid of them?”
Ron frowns down at him and hands him his glasses. “Yeah, it’s me. What are you doing here?”
Robards whips out a notebook and jots it down. Owen looks at them with wide eyes for a bit before nodding.
Eventually, they find themselves in that last room. The one with the roof gone and Harry just sprawls himself across the ground, imagining himself hurt and burnt on the imaginary scorch mark. Ron stares at him for a second before joining. And they lie there, watching the sky go from gold and pink to a darker purple and their breath start to appear in tiny clouds of mist.
“What, really? You sure?”
Ron’s terrier runs in front of him and gives him a glare when Harry turns to run out the door.
And as soon as they’re on the first step, Thirty-nine holds out an arm to halt them. He swishes his wand, and with a slight jerk, the stairs start moving on their own. They go up and up, and Harry notices that every floor they pass is identical. It’s just doors and doors and doors, all spaced evenly around the circular walkway around the stairs. And despite the lack of artificial light, it never gets darker. Eventually, they stop on a floor that looks the same as all the others, and Thirty-nine leads them to one of numerous doors.
But... he gets it now. He does.
* * *
“Wait, hold on.” Harry runs back to Draco’s room and grabs the alphabet paper before heading back out again.
Baker pauses for a moment. Whether in surprise or confirmation, it’s not clear. But then Baker snorts and throws him aside harshly. “Well I, for one, am glad. Don’t need some sniveling bitch working with me.” He walks back to the door, and with a last glance and a “Have fun,” he’s gone.
“Alright, so do I just…” he takes out his wand and swishes it randomly.
And it’s timeless.
Ron starts and gives a hearty laugh. “Well someone’s gotta be the mom friend when she isn’t around.” At that, the tension in the room fades and Malfoy is temporarily forgotten. They take turns ranting about their day, work, and Ron’s growing tea obsession. Harry takes the opportunity to calm down, immersing himself completely in the conversation.
“Maybe so, but if laying everything out where you can physically see it makes you feel better,” he waves a hand at the covered floor, “I can get that.”
,” Ron mutters after a while. “It’s just
Harry doesn’t miss the pause. He puts it away in the back of his mind.
Moving carefully through the wreckage, Harry searches the house for anything out of the ordinary. The objects littering the rooms give hints as to what was there before—a library, the kitchen, a sitting room, bathroom, and, huh, a potions brewery.
“Me too, me too,” Thirty-nine says. Harry watches them share the moment of solidarity. But their words are intriguing, and now Harry knows that Malfoy can disappear. It’s unexpectedly more patronus-y than he had thought, and suddenly, the task in front of him seems that much harder. Especially when he doubts Malfoy has the best impression of him.
“Thank you,” he whispers, more to himself than anything really. But he pretends nevertheless. “What would I do without you.”
Harry surrenders.
He’s still having his existential crisis when he feels something cool and misty brush his arm. He looks up, just in time to catch the fox flick away from him towards the other side of the bed. Mal—
He stops abruptly and turns to look with wide eyes at the fox. Draco tilts his head and imitates Harry’s expression.
So Harry takes the hint and hurries down to the cafeteria. There’s quite a line, and no matter how hard he tries to will it to move faster, it doesn’t. In the end, he grabs a random sandwich off the shelf, pays, and dashes back up to the peace of Malfoy’s room.
“So…I can hear you now?” They sit at Draco’s kitchen table, a steaming cup of tea in Harry’s hand and Draco’s doe crouching on the other end of the table. Luna’s gone home after the firecall, but only so once she’s made them promise to eat out with her later.
“In that case, I believe this wraps up our meeting. Anything anyone would like to add?”
But now, doing this, this repetitive motion of laying down the tiles and shingles, Harry might be feeling just the tiniest bit of regret. Not for joining the magical world, but regret for forgetting the joy of actually using his hands. He decides right then and there that he really ought to be reconsidering his priorities. Anything to live and feel this joy again.
But for now, he decides to humor Ron and sits at the table quietly, if not irritably. As he stares out the window looking down on the rest of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, Ron flits around his office, no doubt busy making who-knows-what kind of tea. Eventually, a cup of light-brown liquid is set steaming in front of him. At Ron’s gesture, he takes a sip—vanilla and cinnamon.

“Hermione!”
“Yes, wandless.”
Harry sniffles, wipes the rest of his tears away, and gives Hermione a tentative smile. “Thank you.”
He starts seeing his mother and Harry more and more, and he’s not sure if that’s a good thing or not. They comfort him and berate him, and Draco finds himself alternating between imagined comfort and heartbreak. His mother only has gentle words. She whispers sweet nothings that he’s longed to hear. She caresses him and assures him of her presence. She’ll always be there, she tells him. She’ll protect him this time.
“That’s not the point!”
“Um, I’m not quite sure actually.” Malfoy lowers his head in dejection. “I-I’m sure they’re fine,” Harry says quickly. “I can ask her later for you if you’d like.”
He sees his therapist the third evening, and he tells her that he’s never thought this much in his life. For once, he’s thinking more than he talks or acts, and she simply tells him that it’s a positive thing; he’s moving in the right direction. And he knows. He
“Do you think it’s because you’re a, um, doe now?”
Hehe I love The Chainsmokers <3
Luna pulls out a few homemade dishes that thankfully look pretty normal, and Harry immediately swipes a cookie and stuffs it into his mouth. “Ifs preffy ‘ood,” he says around his mouthful.
“But not smart of him to show his face,” Imaginary-Harry smirks.
- constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated but please deliver it gently! thank u!
When lunch rolls around, Harry leaves for the small cafeteria on the ground floor of the building. He eats his food carelessly, not noticing what he’s putting into his mouth, and when he’s done, he steps outside for some air. He’s frustrated. He’s frustrated and sad and glad and angry, and he can’t go back quite yet because he knows it’ll show. And it can’t show because Malfoy’s a delicate creature now and Harry refuses to yell and say things he knows he’ll regret later. So he stays outside.
The room Draco’s in is dark and damp, and it’s impossible to tell time. His government-issued wand has obviously been taken away, so he can’t even check. He could’ve been there for a month already and he wouldn’t know. Three days? In a place where the neither sun nor moon shines? There is no time.
“And don’t worry about…” the healer waves a vague hand at Malfoy’s left arm. “The healers in this wing care more about research and their patients than reputation.” It’s said with an unfortunate yet factual tone, and Harry nods.
I. Have. Never written this much dialogue in my life. Ever. Between that many people. Never again. *shivers*

The fox stills. Then it gives a silent whimper and disappears.
He rearranges the potions room to Draco’s liking, and he almost startles at that silver glow coming from that one wall of shelves. The vials of memories are as glaring as always, and he’s sure the fox catches him standing and staring at some point. But Draco doesn’t elaborate and Harry doesn’t push.
He only tells Ron and Hermione about his encounters with Malfoy and Luna after there’s a lull in the dinner conversation one evening and Harry can’t stand it anymore. How everything is so confusing and different and

Ron takes another few steps before realizing. He turns and walks back to Harry, ever the concerned friend, brother. “Hey, you ok?”
“No!”
“We’ll also send some Unspeakables since the Dementors are currently under our jurisdiction.”
He’s talking to Malfoy again one day, and Malfoy’s lying on the bed, chin resting on his body’s chest. He looks as if he’s about to drift off the sleep, but Harry doesn’t mind. Company is company, and Malfoy listening is more than he’d ever hoped for. And suddenly, Malfoy’s form dissolves into a larger cloud of mist and Harry stops to stare, nervous and apprehensive.

got to escape from all the responsibilities while Harry was still out here, still required to maintain the appearance of peace. All at the expense of his own.

Ron waits, letting his words sink in and the shaking subside. When it does, Harry gives him an incredulous look. “Who the heck is willing to walk through an entire village house by house?”
Harry hums.
But Harry thinks back on the argument with Malfoy and realizes that it isn’t enough. Maybe it’s enough for him, but it’s not enough for Malfoy. Never enough for Malfoy. Because it isn’t Harry and his friends against the world anymore. If anything, it’s Harry
“Oh Harry.”
“Oh shut up,” he growls.
“Um…” Malfoy clears his throat.
It takes him a moment to recall everything that happened the previous night, but when he does, he drops his head back on the floor with a gentle thud. But where’s Ron? He turns his head around, not willing to get up quite yet, and spies the note on the ground next to his head. He shoves the rock holding the paper down away, and holds the note up in front of his face, squinting at it.

“Anyways, we have kept the investigation for his missing person secret. However, in the proceeding of this case, we were given a tip regarding a bigger issue.” Robards pauses for dramatic effect, and when Harry just gives him a blank stare, he deflates a little.
Harry gets the image of a frown and a vague sense of dissatisfaction. Then a spark of amusement as he feels Draco settle on a crude picture of the man.
The fox is still at it when Harry migrates to the kitchen for some coffee and breakfast, and he really only stops when Harry starts speaking.
The Dementors never come close to kissing him except once, for which he is glad. They seem to heed whatever instruction Draco had heard given to them, and it was only one incident where the realistic Imaginary-Harry had yelled such hurtful words that Draco had really just considered starving himself and dying. Immediately, a Dementor had swooped in and gripped his neck, lowering its hood with the other hand and coming closer. He couldn’t have moved away if he wanted to.
He tries to make small talk. He asks about the weather, about their day, about their favorite colors and times of day and books they like to read. But whoever it is simply regards him with silence and walks away after setting down the tray of food.
Harry is fuming when he first sees Malfoy for the first time in three years. Or more specifically, he's in the middle of a one-sided shouting match with Robards in the Ministry lobby when Malfoy appears in a burst of green flames.
When Malfoy is aware though, Harry talks. He talks and talks and fills him in on the news and the weather in Grasmere and the state of Luna’s plants. Malfoy listens attentively enough, and although he doesn’t contribute much to the conversation, he’ll occasionally jab out a question or two on the paper, and nod when answered. Otherwise, he seems content to just let Harry rant.
