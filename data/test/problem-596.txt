Unless the rooms moved location completely arbitrarily, Harry thought he knew the right door, but there was only one way to find out for sure. He paused, however, before making any attempt to open it.
Not that he planned on wandering off into the depths of the manor, but he could check the potions lab for a start. He better remembered the way now, and it took him far less time to find the reverberant glass atrium.
And Harry would inevitably need to see him again. He knew at some point in the not-so-distant future they would be planning a time to touch base on their progress. He would have to be in Draco’s vicinity, and somehow not think about all the incredibly naughty things he wanted to do with him.
Harry shivered through a hot chill, and felt a twinge of interest in his trousers, shutting his eyes against the feeling with a deep steadying breath.
“Precisely. Now stop faffing about in your head and pay attention. I wanted to get to casting tonight, while we’ve got the time to do it properly.”
“Ah, well then. Congratulations to you too!” Lawrence muddled out, bestowing another firm shoulder pat, that only years of Quidditch practice kept Harry standing solid under.
He slouched in his chair, a growing uncomfortableness in his pants, completely unable to get Draco out of his head.
Forcing a smile that he hoped looked genuine, he scrambled to remember the man’s first name before the silence between them grew too uneasy. He shook the former Slytherin’s offered hand in the meantime.
Ron was fishing, and it sounded as if they’d been speculating what he might be up to. Harry’d really only been able to tell Hermione in his letters that they were working to improve conditions in the city for disadvantaged Muggles, he’d left a lot of the ‘how’ unsaid.
“Yes, alright,” Draco dismissed quickly, not quite meeting his eye. “Tea first. Then we can get into the gory details.”
After appearing reluctant to touch it, Malfoy spelled his chair back into place with a hand wave, before catching Harry with a rather dangerously piercing smirk.
Draco appeared to be waiting for him to elaborate. When Harry only shrugged in lieu of an explanation, he gave up and went back to his menu. “Right. Fish. Grand.”
“Guess not.” Harry hid a smile with a properly long swallow. Licking at his lips to chase the ensuing smoothness, he caught the downward flick of Draco’s eyes to watch—which was all the excuse he really needed. “Fancy a snog?”
“Any children are too many children, but there’s a much larger number of elderly people as well. Then of course there’s people with substance abuse problems, people in need of mental health services, people in need of legal help—”
What with all the distraction it took Harry a moment to find the words dancing at the tip of his tongue. “Thought you said—”
Harry nevertheless went on gazing at it wistfully a moment, until Draco caught him by the shoulders and propelled him out of the bedroom.
Harry might’ve been judging them just a bit. He tried reminding himself that he was also there on a Friday afternoon for expensive French cuisine. It never would’ve been his first choice, but he had agreed to this, just as he’d agreed to that ridiculous firewhisky Draco’d very successfully tempted him with the night before.
“Well you can’t touch them. We’ve basically come all the way in here so you could ogle the pretty lights.”
“I should stay with them all a while longer—they’re molting, now summer’s ending. I take it you can find your way back to the library alone?”
Draco led him past several worktables, mostly neat and clean, but a few had small clusters of bottles and ingredients surrounding full or half-full cauldrons. A couple of the cauldrons were currently simmering under a low heat, and one was expelling a dark blue smoke.
Draco emerged from his lab then with a swanky purple bottle. Harry had never seen him wear the top of his pyjamas before, a perfect match to the silky grey of the bottoms, and he looked oddly younger with it on. However, even with Draco’s shirt on it was becoming increasingly difficult for him not to jump to conclusions.
Draco had put on another pair of silky pyjama bottoms, black ones this time, and he was again sitting in one of his chairs by the fire.
The afternoon ceremonies would not begin for at least another hour, he had time to check that Malfoy was alright. Although it was a bit annoying to Harry that he apparently now cared enough about Malfoy’s welfare not to let him go wandering off into the Forbidden Forest alone.
“Nevermind that. Watch me, I know you know how to do that, and pay attention. I’ll be certain to let you know when you’ve done something wrong. For instance, stop fondling the forks, you’re smearing the silver.”
Ginny finally even talked him into a dance, in spite of his being still completely hopeless at it. He thought she had looked particularly beautiful then, flushed and breathless from laughter and dancing, and seeming not to mind too terribly that Harry found it difficult to avoid trodding on her feet.
He hadn’t even bothered to use Parseltongue, but Draco shuddered anyway, shoving his arse back into the quickening push of Harry’s hips, and moaning ever louder.
It occurred to him then that if Ron had dropped by at the same time just two days prior, he would’ve got quite the eyeful. They really should’ve been more careful—he was mostly ignoring the bit where he was bizarrely enthralled at the idea.
“It’s alright. It’s true it might not always be perfectly wholesome around here all the time, but that’s also very far from all of the people that need our help—and not even by half. Above all else they
Of course, the bill was a bit of a shock. He had a fair amount of cash leftover after his tent purchasing spree, and could more than cover it, but he couldn’t help feeling slightly offended on principle anyway.
trust you, Harry,” Hermione tried diplomatically. “We’re just concerned. Ginny is concerned for you. We had to be sure you were alright—that you’re not in over your head on anything again. We can keep your secrets; you know we can, but you’d tell us if you were in any real trouble, wouldn’t you?”
He had made plenty of impulsive choices in his past, but he thought this might be a crowning achievement in rash decisions. Had the Memorial that morning hit him so hard that he completely lost his mind?
Despite his lazing about, Harry scrambled to his feet with a ridiculous amount of readiness at the invitation.
Eventually he had drifted off to sleep there, and dreamt a restless dream—in which Draco was very naked and very moany under him, in a large bed that Harry had never seen before. When he woke later, he wouldn’t really remember the dream, though his cock very obviously did—
“How fast do you think I could make you come?” Harry murmured, pressing his cock’s obvious interest to Draco’s through thin layers of cotton and silk.
According to Draco, but that was hardly a good enough excuse for all his inappropriate behavior. There was no real excuse for the cheating, hence why he so often buried it unexamined. When he couldn’t even manage justifying it to himself, how was he meant to explain it to anyone else?
Draco sighed in an overly-dramatic sort of way. “I’m trusting my future freedom to a Muggle social worker.”
“Nothing’s the matter. Just—” Cutting himself off with a scoff, Draco caught the front of his shirt in a firm grip and dragged him brusquely into a much narrower break between two buildings.
Internally, some part of him was likely mortified at the inanity of the statement, but the firewhisky helped Harry very much not to care.
She and Ginny exchanged another look, leaving Harry once again very suspicious of what was being said.
In his owl, Harry included a small bit of instruction on the function of the Portkey, and one other note:
His Charms lesson forgotten, Harry lowered his wand, gripping it tightly at his side—but his tension eased some in the wake of Draco’s palm sliding down his arm.
It was rushed and a little frantic—once again, neither of them really had the patience to bother fully undressing. Harry had bent him over the kitchen table, and Draco had pushed himself back on Harry’s cock with an eager sort of shamelessness that Harry found completely irresistible.
A bit flustered, Cassie started pulling open drawers on her squat metal desk, looking for one with any spare space. “Sorry, my desk is rather messy.”
“Oi,” Ron called. “Where do you think she picked that up? Charlie taught us all to feint—and how to counter them.”
When he returned, he held a dusty and rather ancient-looking bottle of firewhisky in one hand, and a cut-crystal tumbler in the other.
When he curled his fingers a bit, Draco threw his head back against the mahogany desktop with enough force to
“Shut up, Malfoy, yours is before mine,” Harry complained, and started nipping steadily at his neck, until Draco was breathing a little unsteadily. “How long did you say you had?”
Harry chewed his lip uncertainly. He hadn’t been sure if he should tell Draco or not—but it was out now. He didn’t get to see Draco’s reaction though, because the blond man rose from the settee, and appeared to have a sudden pressing need to examine the shelves behind his desk like he’d never seen them before.
Harry broke first, gasping as his lips parted under the strength of heat, shuddering faintly as it overtook him, pulsing several thick bursts of come over Draco’s hand.
The painting was happening around them, but the paintbrushes were doing all of the work. Occasionally, drops of white paint would escape from the brushes painting the ceiling to land on one or both of them, but they were both far too distracted to notice.
Draco surveyed him idly before he pushed off the desk. He caught Harry’s chin in his grip, turning his head for Draco to get a better look at his cheek one more time. He didn’t say anything, but he
Harry had ordered a pot of tea, and it was steeping soothingly on the table between them. There were biscuits as well, and a few small sandwiches, of which Harry had already had two. He’d worked up quite an appetite running about all morning.
He was still angry. Draco was obviously still angry too, kissing him biting and hard and frantic, none of his slow taunting, and it hurt—even more as Draco’s grip tightened in his hair, both of them groaning and gasping in sudden heat.
“So yeah, we’ve planned to do most of the setting up tomorrow—er, if the weather cooperates,” Harry concluded. “But it’d be really helpful to have your input moving forward.”
Harry wanted it to be true. He wished neither of them had been forced to live through what they did—but he was there with him now. They had made it out alive, and he knew on some level that if he really wanted, he could probably have him all the time. If he was brave enough.
,” he gasped, caught up in the low vibrations of moaning each time he pressed the tip of his cock just that much deeper down his throat.
“They’ll ride up with wear,” Draco dismissed airily. “I suppose you’re decent enough. At the very least, now it shouldn’t be an embarrassment being seen with you in public.”
It was as he stood there watching Draco frowning again over the mess of Harry’s notes, that some thread of control just barely hanging on in Harry snapped free—and he thoughtlessly blurted his next question, completely unprompted by anything they had just been talking about.
“It looks fucking incredible,” Harry admitted, pressing unconsciously closer as he worked his fingers gently in between as well—Draco’s grip tightened on his shoulders, but Harry didn’t tease him, he was as careful as he could be.
“I really like it though, your skin,” Harry admitted with the honesty of a person having several firewhiskys in him. “How is it you’re such a sexy ponce, Draco?”
Harry waited another five minutes or so for Draco to leave, and checked himself over one last time for any remnants of Draco on his person before he found the will to head back out to his cubicle.
In addition to small journal, in which he’d apparently jotted several pages of notes, he’d also brought several large and yellowed looking tomes, of varying sizes and thicknesses. All together the stack stood a bit taller than Harry’s pint glass on the bar top.
At the end of the corridor was a set of very tall double doors, and Harry felt an odd sweeping in his stomach when Draco charmed them to swing slowly inward, revealing a very reflective ballroom with a high, vaulted mirror ceiling.
Everyone else seemed content to give them the space to talk—Ron was arguing with George at the bar over who was going to pay for Harry’s drink.
It had two levels, smaller than the library at Hogwarts, but perhaps not by all that much. Harry took it all in with a genuine interest, though of course his first thought was of Hermione, and how she likely would have enjoyed perusing such an old library.
He let another hot sharp cry when Harry pulled out to slam back in as Draco’s hips bucked under the weight of Harry’s. Gasping, Draco locked pleasure-blown gazes with him and Harry felt the telltale tremor of Draco’s impending climax deep inside.
Toward the center of the room was a great desk that looked to Harry to be a dark mahogany, if he was recalling his woods properly. It was surrounded on all sides by a few chairs and a settee, all of which were scattered with books and unrolled scrolls of neat notes on parchment.
Of course, some of what he’d seen through those mirrors had been pretty unforgettable—like the way Draco’s expression went all blissful when Harry—
Harry thought she must’ve seen the slightly trapped look in his eye and he tried to straighten up a bit. “I’ll be down if I can—I need to make the rounds, and I want to check in on Hagrid.”
"I couldn't tell you. It all sounds very ambitious, which I can appreciate, but also very charitable, which I cannot. Saving the Elves not enough for your lot? Now you've got to save all the Muggles as well?"
On Thursday night he used the blackboard to inquire about the progress of the enchantments, unfortunately Draco reported back that he was hitting an unforeseen snag on the calculation of intent fluctuations. Until he could sort out the error, it was holding up his ability to start refining all the protection charms together.
With a groan of annoyance rather than pleasure, Draco pulled back to narrow the stormy darkness of his eyes on Harry accusingly.
That Tuesday would mark the two-year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts and—if it were anything like the last—it would be something of a memorial and a wake, all in one.
Ginny nodded, kissed Harry’s cheek, and headed over to chat with Seamus and Dean. They were seated at the old table with an impressive line-up of empty shot glasses.
“Smells like honey,” Harry pointed out casually. It felt thick like honey too, but it stuck where Draco smeared it, and didn’t drip down his face at all.
It was the look of fear in their eyes that was so familiar to him, and Harry thought what concerned him most were the significant number of children present in the winding line. No child deserved to be a Dementor’s prey.
Draco finished helping to tug Harry’s shirt over his head, and the long slim length of his cock brushed up against Harry’s front as Draco stepped out of his trousers entirely. They undressed with surprisingly little hurry. It all came off so naturally that Harry didn’t even have the chance to feel very awkward about standing completely naked in the middle of a library.
Draco flashed a smirk, but of course his answer was to take off for the open gate, leaving Harry behind to belatedly register what’d just happened.
Tracing his fingertips up the outline of Draco’s cock, Harry discovered he was already stiff and pressed to the front of his trousers. When he chanced a look, Draco’s head had tipped back, his eyes fallen closed.
Harry couldn’t help noting it was sort of nice that when Draco was soft like this, he could fit nearly all of him into his mouth at once, without choking.
“How long ago?” Draco asked, picking through a variety of bottles, tins, and jars on the cabinet’s shelves before he pulled out a small pot of something that looked somehow wet and solid at the same time.
Harry really tried to give what he thought was a customary warning tug, but it was nearly too late—even before he was swallowed down until he rubbed the back of Malfoy’s throat again—and then it was too late, and Harry was coming with a breathless cry he only barely kept from echoing out in the room’s deceptively calming glow.
“Er. So…today in the alley, you were starting to say something. You said ‘I can’t’, but what was the end of the sentence?”
Just as they were stood watching, a number of men and a small family joined the end of the line. They all appeared to be perfectly ordinary Muggles, queuing politely, and none seemingly inclined to so much as cut the line. Only as they drew closer did it become apparent to Harry why the Dementors had found this particular queue so appetising.
“They’re a bit long, aren’t they?” Harry muttered, dutifully allowing himself to be turned one way, then the other.
The thought had no sooner crossed his mind than Draco was slipping his arms around Harry’s middle beneath his robes, catching hold of his arse, and pulling him very much closer.
It didn’t matter how many times Harry heard him say the word, it sent an ache through his cock every time.
Settling over him he could feel every gasp and shudder, pushing his cock steadily deeper, until his hips were flush to Draco’s arse.
Malfoy did not immediately acknowledge him. Harry watched as he dug into the inner pocket of his robes—and pulled out a palm-sized potions bottle, rounded but rather flat, and sloshing with a blueish-coloured liquid that Harry wasn’t sure he liked the look of...
He felt awful for lying at all, but he also knew there was no better option. Telling the truth was obviously completely off the table.
Harry thought that only seemed likely to worry everyone more. He recalled how Ginny had reacted to the books—and the way she’d looked at him at the Ball, like she couldn’t trust him not to be reckless.
Harry laughed breathlessly, and bounced his hips up with a lazy playfulness as Draco bit down on a moan.
Someone was shaking him awake, and despite being soundly asleep it didn’t take Harry long to sort out who.
Malfoy seemed to realise he may have overreacted. As he sipped irritably at his absinthe, Harry thought he could safely take a moment to consider him a little more closely, but Malfoy caught him looking almost immediately—and somehow, with only the deliberate arch of one pale eyebrow, Harry felt suddenly very flushed.
The War had left its impact on all of them, one way or the other. That first year there had been too many funerals, and what had felt to Harry then like an overload of loss.
Draco’s footsteps echoed purposefully off the marble as he crossed the room. In the nearly ten years Harry had known him, Draco had always seemed to walk that way. At times he had been running purposefully away in fear, or even purposefully striding toward trouble, often up to no good—but always his steps were sharp and certain, carried with the sort of confidence Harry often wished for, yet only seemed capable of channeling in the direst of circumstances.
The silence stretched out between them before he couldn’t help but ask the next most obvious question. “What for?”
Draco sighed when Harry got a bit more soap in his palm and moved on, reaching down to wash between Draco’s thighs. It took a bit of doing to find and work all of the sticky honey residue from his skin. Harry started in on his balls, and in short time felt the prodding of Draco’s hardening prick between them.
Draco’s moan went guttural and low, and Harry groaned back, grinding down harder before he was aiming to find the best spot. As he rolled his hips for it, he found the coordination to tug his shirt over his head, press the sweat-sheening warmth of his chest to Draco’s back and feel him arch when Harry found what his cock was searching for.
Harry was just packing up what had survived of the objects he brought with him when a throat cleared quietly behind him.
“I doubt we’ll get very much accomplished in an hour, but no matter. What’s the latest, Potter? Have you summoned me here to discuss your mad project? …Or is this about my exceptional Potions skills.”
Draco moaned his name again, tighter and closer, and Harry teased through fine darker-blond curls to press Draco’s prick flat to his front, working the heel of his palm over it hard and rubbing. Draco writhed, shuddering between the pressure of Harry’s hand and the penetration of his cock, spurting up his own stomach until Harry pulled his hand away to let him come over the freshly changed sheets.
It stiffened under the attention—hard as Harry’s cock, which Draco now nipped a purposeful path toward.
The closer he got to exposure, the more uneven his breathing became. He knew he was being toyed with; it was arguably what he’d asked for. As his eyes fluttered closed, Malfoy yanked the hem of his pants down past his hips, exposing Harry to the nearly-empty room, and more importantly, to Malfoy.
And then Harry fucked him harder, taking his own pleasure from the tightening heat, and the tense shudder of the lithe body pressed beneath his own.
Harry pushed up to his palms for more thrusting momentum, his breathing growing more uneven with each penetrating press.
As Malfoy had so succinctly put it, he needed more information—information he couldn’t find in any of the books on the shelves at Malfoy Manor, nor any other magic library.
Scoffing a disbelieving laugh, Draco spun a larger plate and murmured a few lines of quiet Latin as an array of neatly-chopped vegetables arranged themselves. With a few more precise wand-waves, he enchanted the same plate under a shimmering dome of translucent orange magic.
“Can I fuck you?” he whispered, nudging them back toward Draco’s bedroom—not an easy task when the world still tilted slightly on him.
In the midst of everything else going on in his life, he somehow found time to squeeze in a small amount of research. Unfortunately, Harry quickly discovered that his personal library—what few books he’d accumulated between school, gifts from Hermione and raiding the study at Grimmauld—was lacking in most of the subjects Malfoy had mentioned in his letter. Given he wasn’t yet prepared to bring any of it to Hermione, what little information he had uncovered in the meantime would have to do.
Harry hadn’t actually expected him to have one up his sleeve, not everyone did, in fact most people didn’t, nevertheless now that he was considering the notion—
He knew he ought to have been completely exhausted, they hadn’t napped for very long at all, but their excursion in the shower had been oddly energizing, and Harry made pretty good progress whilst Draco was gone.
“Honestly, I’m very excited to see it all, it sounds so…fantastical, in the nicest way of course. I haven’t got anything scheduled for tomorrow, I could certainly plan on popping by.”
When Draco first stepped into Harry’s sitting room, he looked as if he expected a hoard of Weasley’s to descend upon him in righteous fury at any moment.
He cast every revealing charm he could think of, and came back with only a seemingly normal Portkey spell. As a last resort he closed his eyes and held the key loose in his palm, feeling out the magic with his senses rather than a spell.
“It’s not, until we get on increasing the number of locations—then it could become quite a lot to keep up with. Unless—there may be a way to connect them all to the same enchantments…”
Though he supposed, that wasn’t entirely fair. The Muggles did appear to be trying to do something about it—but given the slow progress of the ever-lengthening queue before them, and also the sheer number of people very clearly in need of help, it was difficult to argue they were doing any of it particularly
Harry was trying to speak as slowly and clearly as he could, still adjusting to consciously speaking the language in the first place. It was nice he didn’t have to keep staring at Draco’s headboard now—that he could look right into the lusty darkness of his eyes and watch Draco writhe as Harry stroked the full length of his cock in tight, purposeful pumps.
They were stopped in the entryway. Draco had to nudge him from behind, and still it took another moment to move his feet, but he tried shaking off the weight of memory to cross the room to the corridor of back offices.
Harry’s coherency was reduced to a moan. Draco really was trying to test his stamina. He coiled an arm around Harry’s shoulders for balance, lifting himself up to sit on the edge of the desk, and Harry moved too quickly working Draco’s thighs apart. Only belatedly did it occur to him he didn’t know what he was doing after that.
He saw Ginny edging over from the bar with his drink and one of her own, and he waited for her to join them before he launched into anything.
The smoke didn’t appear to concern Draco at all, he didn’t even glance at the tables either, and stopped instead at a fancy looking wood cabinet with coloured glass panes in its doors.
Even better, if his experience over these last several weekends with Draco was any indication, he was potentially on the verge of several nights in a row of restful and dreamless sleep—a powerfully alluring notion.
"Not to mention we’ve already saved them once, or did you forget the Dark Lord wanted to use them all for a slave army?"
Knelt at his feet, Draco started tracing the tip of his wand very lightly along the inside-leg seam of the too-tight trousers he was wearing. Harry cleared his throat a little restlessly.
Draco spread his legs a little wider and Harry thrust a lot harder, fucking him against the desk as Draco’s moans grew ever tauter and more urgent—until his cock twitched hot in Harry’s grip and Draco came only seconds ahead of Harry, who shoved himself in deep in time for Draco’s everything to clench tight around him.
When Harry pushed in deeper Draco’s smug attitude melted into a low, carnal sort of moan that shot through Harry like a hot arrow.
Ron nodded. “You know her. She’s not going to stop reading until she finds what she needs to prove the point she wants to make. I’ve offered to help of course, but when she tried to explain what she was looking for—”
That was new. Moaning, Harry parted his lips almost obediently to make way for a demanding tongue, whilst neither of them seemed capable of halting the steady rock of their hips together.
Wiping down an empty one toward the centre of the room, Sally waved at them as they passed through, insisting that they visit again soon.
On Monday morning he found a scroll of parchment on his desk from the department heads, giving him official approval to be off the last half of the week. He hadn’t imagined they would deny him, but it was stretching courtesy to be asking on such short notice. Someone else would need to take his place Dementor hunting with Savage on Thursday, but Harry was very grateful to have a week away from hunting the increasing swarms of menacing nightmare-agitators.
Harry snorted and winced simultaneously at the thought of them exploding at all. “Suppose that’s something to be thankful for?”
Harry had been up against the painful edge of arousal for a while now, but he fucked Draco as thoroughly as he could—grabbing at the arched curve of his back to help pull him harder onto the swell of his cock.
Harry exhaled heavily, attempting to get control of himself—an entirely pointless endeavour, as Malfoy only moaned in response with a reflexive sort of rock up against Harry, hips first. Now they both moaned.
Harry had gone to look over Hermione’s notes again—but then Draco offered to cast the Protean Charm on the push-lights for Harry, so that Harry could concentrate on getting more familiar with the modified Extension spell, as well as the new layers Draco had added since the last time they’d worked on things.
Having only been once before, and under duress at the time, Harry was nervous he might Splinch himself trying to get to Malfoy Manor, but when he popped into being he was standing at its gates. A peacock squawked at him from behind the gate, and Harry looked at it warily as Draco waved his wand about with some quiet murmurs.
“You alright?” Harry whispered, sure he might’ve blacked out for a second, but not so far gone he didn’t realise he might’ve hurt Draco slamming into him so hard against such an unmoving surface.
He couldn’t keep it all secret forever, he couldn’t go on doing it forever…but how long could he continue to tempt fate? Because he wasn’t yet ready for any of it to be over.
In the silence that followed, Harry slid Draco’s letter into the back of his trunk with the others, tossed on a quick locking charm, and made his way downstairs to prepare tea for his fiancé.
The big news, it turned out, was that Fleur was expecting. Bill was absolutely ecstatic about it, and Fleur appeared even more glowing than she normally did. Most everyone had been there, though rarely were Ron and Hermione able to make it at the same time, and Hermione was hardly there at all.
Draco considered him seriously a moment, then began tracing his fingers through Harry’s hair in soft careful movements, sending an overwhelming sort of pleasant contentment washing over him, far too soothing to resist.
It had never occurred to Harry once in all these years that Draco might’ve cared for Dobby at all. “I’m sorry, Draco.”
,” Draco gasped, the force of Harry’s hips rubbing his cock into the hot sticky mess of his sheets as he spilled inside him.
For a few ticks it looked as if Malfoy might protest, but he didn’t. Instead he wandered through the high grass a moment before locating a hidden stump, and proceeding to Transfigure it into a table which came to about waist-height.
It was so much harder than the last time. Far more often lingering flashes of intense ecstasy would frequent his thoughts and dreams in new and interesting ways. Harry was not doing so well blocking it out this time—there was too much more to remember now.
A pale brow furrowed faintly. “But you’re not boring, and you’ve never been. You’re a risk taker. You’ll walk right up to the precipice and jump, and never question why you’re jumping until you’re falling through the air.”
It was also becoming apparent to him that, for whatever reason, time spent with Draco held the worst of the dreams at bay, for a little while. Harry didn’t know what to do with this new information—it wasn’t as though he could ask him to stay over every time he had a bad dream, that would be ridiculous, not to mention impractical when his fiancé inevitably came home.
Caught in the torridly tightening tug inside him, Harry was breathless too. He gasped unsteady on the edge, his hips rushing in time with the wave of heat coursing through him, just before he broke.
Which was how Harry found himself standing in the gardens of Malfoy Manor scattering an odd mix of seeds and bugs for an ostentation of albino peacocks—while Draco talked at them all as if they were cats, with their own names and personalities and everything. Harry couldn’t tell them apart, they were all white and feathered and disconcertingly threatening in their flamboyance, but Draco seemed to be genuinely fond of them.
Reaching back for him, Draco gripped at his arse, urging on the force of his thrusts with a breathier moan. “
When Harry went in to brush his teeth, he watched his cheeks tinting with warmth in the mirror, as Draco appeared to have no compunctions about nudging up beside him to share the bathroom sink.
Fumbling open Draco’s trousers, Harry pulled his cock out to pump him forcefully, whispering Parseltongue secrets beneath his ear all the while.
Some nights, it took all of his energy even to drag himself from his comfortable chair by the fire and up the stairs to bed. Sitting there on those colder nights, his mind would overflow with thoughts, anxieties, and concerns that only grew harder to calm.
“Nothing in particular you might like to attempt then? Aside from what you’ve already promised, of course.”
“We’ll need to switch it up, I imagine. Different families, individuals, different needs. We’ll need to create a variety in that regard. If we can squeeze it in, a few of them should have three bedrooms at least.”
Harry kissed him hard and a touch claiming. Draco’s low groan was lost to it before he broke their lips apart to start tracing his own over the light stubble accrued on Harry’s jaw overnight.
“Salutations, Ginevra.” Malfoy couldn’t have sounded any less enthusiastic if he’d tried, but it was civil at any rate.
Harry may have grumbled a bit, but he acquiesced, and went off to find himself a small tumbler of firewhisky.
Glancing quickly away, Harry reached out to take the offered bottle. He was apparently reckless enough to drink a completely unknown potion, sight unseen—so long as it didn’t cause Malfoy to drop dead on the spot.
“Oh—sorry, I thought I’d told you—she’s put together a small map for us. I was thinking I might go and have a look at them soon, in person…”
Hurrying to tug the neat tuck of Draco’s shirt from his trousers, he slid the flat of his palm beneath it, warmly tracing a pale blond path. At the impatient shift of Draco’s hips, Harry pressed against the lovely curve of his arse while his fingers ventured on to unbuttoning his trousers.
The clouds were unleashing even more uninhibitedly in this part of the city, and the tree could only do so much to protect them from the deluge.
Draco pushed his trousers down to release him, and immediately kneeled down to capture Harry’s tip on his tongue—a perfectly surrounding heat as Draco’s tongue danced over his shaft in a taunting play that left Harry clutching at the sides of the ladder for purchase.
Harry couldn’t help the half-grin he flashed at Draco, and for some reason, his smile made Draco go flushed, and not only at his ears either, but high in his cheeks too, which really only happened when he—
He cancelled Draco’s vibration spell, his wand stilled in his hand, and Harry didn’t think much about wiping it clean on the nearest pile of trousers.
It was good enough—though the prospect of meeting with Malfoy again was triggering that anxious flipping in his stomach, a feeling which persisted all through the few short hours it took to receive a response.
He felt a strange flash of nerves when she joined them, looking as elegant as she ever did, in an appropriately-festive gold dress. Of course, Harry knew from experience any combination of Malfoys and Weasleys was a precarious tinderbox of eggshells, even in peacetime. On the other hand, he’d been talking to Malfoy for quite a while by then, and hadn’t felt the urge to strangle him even once.
Harry was doing what he did most Mondays—paperwork of the most mind-dulling sort, a whole week’s worth backed up in piles on his desk—when something very unexpected happened.
The duck came out quite good. Harry helped himself to more than he probably should’ve, and ate for several minutes before he bothered to stop long enough to say anything about it.
Draco’s lips curved a bit wickedly, and he did not hide the path of his eyes up Harry’s stretching form. “Very good work today.”
“Three women—and a few more men than I care to count…none of whom have ever fucked me more than once.”
They were a glass and a half in when Draco leant in enough to nip just once at his cheek, and Harry abruptly drained the last burning swallow before catching at his chin to pull him in for a slowly pointed kiss.
“As I said, you’ll see soon enough. Today the assignment is to remove as many Dementors as possible from the surrounding areas of Westminster. For now, the Ministry considers this a Muggle problem with magical pests, and we’ve been asked to help out the Pest Control Board. In you get then!”
“You like it?” Harry questioned breathlessly. He squeezed at Draco’s cock, stroking him to the same languid rhythm Harry was using to penetrate him.
Whatever pretence he might’ve had that this was not actually a date had fled his mind about half-way through the meal. It was far too much like one to deny it, even to himself. They’d shared a bloody dessert.
“Quite. Try not to spill.” After a careful swirl he took a short sip before passing off to Harry, a thoughtful purse to paler lips. “I suppose it’s decent—smooth enough. I’m not certain it’s really that many galleons worth of smooth.”
Malfoy ignored his other question completely. He eyed Harry up quite thoroughly before brandishing the bottle a bit in his direction.
There was a moment of silence between them wherein Draco caught on to what he meant, and then seemed to be peering at Harry with some new level of respect—and also a touch of amusement.
Harry took a deep breath, hoping he sounded nice and casual, as if he hadn’t just recently spent several hours naked with the man. He was caught somewhere between being proud of himself, and concerned that he was getting so much better at lying to people.
Harry recalled quite vividly the feel of Cruciatus on the tip of his wand, and the tip of his tongue. When it worked, the power of controlling that sort of all-encompassing pain had been—as Dark Magic tended to be—dangerously addictive, even if Harry had struggled to find the strength of hateful intent required to harness it properly. He couldn’t imagine being forced to use it regularly, as Draco had been.
He couldn’t do anything to hide the twitch of his cock, and Draco’s smirk was infuriating, but he relaxed his thighs, and let him push them open even more.
Even if it hurt, once they started kissing they couldn’t stop, and they went on fucking each other’s fists with growing urgency. Draco caught at the soaked mop of Harry’s hair to keep their lips hard together, muting their moans. Harry’s grew steadily rougher and deeper the closer he got to coming, and Draco’s grew longer, and more wanting—but they never stopped kissing.
Neither of them was actually wearing any pants, but Draco spun to face him with a challenging sort of head tilt, and held Harry’s gaze as he worked the hem of his pyjamas down over narrow hips. Harry tried not to look down, but failed completely, the sound of shifting fabric drawing his attention in time to see Draco stepping out of them.
Annoyed at himself, Harry re-read his letter before he scratched out a quick signature at the bottom, and took a long swallow of the fiery liquid in his glass. He attributed the letter’s warm closing to the drink he was enjoying, and that was excuse enough to call it done, and send it off with Ginny’s golden barn owl.
“Not if we want any control over the security enchantments or the secrecy. Essentially, we’ll need to consider a less...portable approach.”
Draco whispered a time spell, and a smoky glowing clock face materialised in the dark room above their heads. It was almost four-thirty.
“I’ll help however I can, of course…” Cassie still looked hesitant, and Harry imagined that might have something to do with his being especially cryptic.
Some of Harry’s tension eased then too—that whatever wild nonsense they had got up to, it wasn’t going to impact the project. That was important to him.
Harry frowned at the tumbler. “Taste’s interesting enough—but for all that, it would need to be fucking bottomless. Even then it’s too much. That’s completely daft.”
Harry kissed him harder, until Draco growled quietly against his lips, and shoved him back against one of the wooden ladders leading up to the library’s second level. Its steps’ sharp edges dug into Harry’s back, and he winced, but Draco was biting at his ear now and he moaned out an embarrassingly desperate sound.
orbs, it had completely slipped his mind that magic light balls would obviously not be an option for any future residents.
“If you want them to be generally uniform, then yes, and it’s going to take rather a lot of practice, I think.”
Harry followed his gaze to see a small cluster of the Ministry’s top officials huddled around together. As he watched, Kingsley joined them with what looked to be plenty of good holiday cheer. The speeches would be starting again soon.
Harry summoned his broom from the hall cupboard and the two former Gryffindors walked the short road from town back to the Burrow, through the garden and on up the hill to the orchard.
When he offered Harry his wand back, handle-first, it vibrated quite intensely in his grip, and Harry gasped softly at the realisation.
“Westminster’s latest shelter, I imagine. Just ‘round the corner there, probably giving out breakfast or somesuch.”
He checked the push light, which was off—acknowledging Cassie had seen his message—and when Harry clicked it on again her reply was short and clear.
Draco shifted minutely closer, so that his shoulder pressed lightly to Harry’s whenever either of them breathed in.
Harry found himself studying the line of them, until he realised he was missing the answer to his question.
Draco paused in sipping his coffee and their eyes met for a split second of shared remembrance before Harry went a little flushed and Draco hid in his cup a moment before he replied.
Harry hesitated not at all backing him up against said tree to kiss him again. Draco’s low hum vibrated on his lips, and he was ready to properly deepen it when a rather unfortunate reality prevented him doing so.
Harry had to stretch to reach for the tea tray and carefully pull out the spoon he’d left sitting in the honey jar, hurrying to hover it over Draco’s stomach, up his chest and back down, swirling about his navel, and lower yet.
In the bedroom he watched Draco stripping down to his pants before he did the same, removing the perfect fit of borrowed clothes, and sensing the gaze following him as he did, before he was crawling into bed to join him.
Caught up in kissing, it took a fumbling moment to find and properly push into the maddening pull of Draco’s clenched heat with one, and shortly thereafter two fingers. He was fully tight to start with, so it was taking longer than usual, but whatever awkwardness lingered between them quickly vanished when Draco started moaning over his lips, teasing with his tongue into deeper kisses
The new tolerance, peace, civility, whatever it was, it felt like a good thing, a bright spot in the darkness. However, it obviously was not enough of a bright spot to make Harry feel any more inclined to be at this excessively extravagant party.
attract any attention from the Muggles, we’ll need to call in the Obliviators, and those prats’ll never let you hear the end of it.”
And if it had been Ron, Hermione, any of the Weasleys at risk, Harry was not sure what all terrible things he might’ve done to keep them safe, had his hand ever been forced to do so. He hadn’t hesitated to reach for an Unforgivable in Minerva’s defence.
As on the night of Harry’s birthday, he sounded peevish and sleepy, and it was oddly attractive. Draco considered him a moment longer before he huffed a small sigh.
For several beats, the only noise in the tiny office was the sound of Harry’s pen moving on the notepad he’d bought for the occasion. He nodded for Cassie to go on.
His gaze swept over Harry more closely then, and Harry ignored the increasingly familiar nervous twist it gave him—but what Draco left him with was rather unexpected.
He was pretty sure they were responsible for his nightmares being so frequent lately as well—the Dementors were very good at stirring up all his worst memories, and Harry was far from the only one suffering because of them.
He'd got a bit distracted. However fucking Draco was something Harry knew how to do. It was starting to become a habit, actually.
Draco moaned darkly encouraging around him and Harry thrust reactively in a throb of heat. Then he did it again, and again, through each erratic bolt of pleasure.
Even saving the world wasn’t enough to protect him from bad press forever. Was the risk worth the consequences?
He couldn’t focus on her imminent return now, not and still see through what he and Draco had started, so he simply didn’t acknowledge it.
It was nice to shift focus for a few hours—though Harry still felt the chaos always looming on the next day’s horizon.
Hermione tugged Harry around to the table behind the stairs leading up to the Inn’s few rooms. It was always just a touch quieter there.
Harry caught Hermione and Ginny exchanging looks he could not read at all, only adding to his general unease. They had clearly covered for him with everyone else—both Neville and George asked after Hagrid when Harry joined them at the bar.
“We’ll rest a few minutes, and get right back to it,” Harry reasoned, feeling the soft nudge of Draco’s nose, the steady puffs of breath on his neck.
He leaned in, biting a slow kiss into the soft underside of Draco’s exposed thigh—and kept at it until he’d left behind a dark pink bloom on pale skin. Draco’s moans pitched deeper between every quiet gasp and tight breath, the sound of him testing Harry’s patience not to pull out his wand and fuck Draco into the chair, but then—
“Then I’ll have to find someone who understands it better,” he decided. “S’pose I could start asking around at some of the shelters we keep clearing.”
When he teased in with his tongue again, Draco clenched tight all around it, and Harry knew by now that he was fighting very hard not to come all over the mirror a second time. The slight whine in his moan was another clue.
He wasn’t sure how much longer he could stand it—living at this level of wrong, all the lying. When he actually emerged from the comfort of his denial long enough to examine any of it—Harry had to wonder
Draco was waiting for him when he emerged from the bathroom, freshly showered as well, smelling spicily of coconut and already fully dressed, in yet another dangerously attractive Muggle suit.
He was sprawled out on his back, and Draco watched him a moment hesitantly before carefully stretching out atop him. Both of them were wisely careful to keep their hips apart from each other, and it was actually quite cosily comfortable—perhaps even dangerously so.
It was only as he backed them into the darkened room that it occurred to him, they had never fucked in a bed before.
them. I’d like to maybe try to do something for them… but it’s all a bit of a longshot really. I—well, actually—maybe you’d be willing to offer some guidance in future? I have a bit more work to do on the er, the case, but I’ll probably be in touch again—soon hopefully. With any luck we might be able to make things a bit better.”
“Hopefully you can all put up a good fight next season,” Harry encouraged genuinely, though it was difficult to shut down the ripping guilt in his chest that he was betraying someone so full of joy.
Harry stared at him somewhat uncomprehending as a twist of desire on a level he had never experienced before washed over him, amazing—and also terrifying. It was taking Harry a ridiculous amount of effort not to act on it—not to back Malfoy right up against that tree and—
Probably he should’ve walked away then. He didn’t, though he did give voice to a small spike of annoyance.
As the day crept later into the afternoon, he was so pleased with his progress that he wanted to share, and curious enough about how Draco was getting along that he decided to pop by for an unexpected visit.
It took them both a while longer to recover this time, but eventually they got back to the process of cleaning up and putting their clothes on again.
In the short time Harry had been at the Ministry, he'd learned very quickly that the Improper Use of Magic Department had a reputation for being all ego and power-trips. He wasn’t really a fan. But, if they could do this correctly, hopefully they wouldn't have to deal with them at all.
“I hope you aren’t expecting me to politely refuse.” Good or not, Harry rarely turned down the offer of firewhisky these days.
Harry leant over him enough to trace the tip of his tongue up the length of Draco’s cock and when Draco gasped pleasurably and arched toward his mouth, he did it again only longer, and using more of his tongue.
“That’s not what you were saying a half hour ago,” he taunted, lifting his hips only enough to pull his trousers back up.
After a moment’s thought however, he pushed up enough to lightly brush their lips together, almost questioningly.
A passing gran looked about in a scandalised sort of way as they neared the main road, but they hadn’t dispelled the Disillusionment Charm yet, and Harry was hopeful she hadn’t seen them.
In the frantic interplay of their heavy panting, Draco’s broken moan cut through loudly as he released between them in several twitching shots, all over Harry’s front.
Unable to stifle a rather loud snort of derisive laughter, he ducked back to avoid the impact when Draco tried flicking his forehead in retaliation.
Harry does some gardening, has a talk with Ron and Hermione, and receives an unexpected visitor at work.
“Yes, well—it’s quite sexy, you know…all that hissing.” Draco had gone a bit defensive. Harry could see his ears going lightly pink.
He only barely resisted leaving without him. When Draco eventually seemed satisfied that he’d made him wait long enough, they Apparated to London.
Thankfully, no one seemed to find any of this unusual, though it took effort for Harry to not show exactly how much it hurt taking most of Ron’s weight. At least it stopped him having to hug every drunk friend in the entire Inn, he felt awkward enough as it was.
Unhesitantly Harry shoved in the rest of the way, even as his overstimulated cock shot sticky heat into the man writhing under him, and he could feel Draco go taut with ecstasy, inside and out.
“More?” he pressed, breathing harder himself when he shifted enough to feel the hard rise of Malfoy’s cock against hip.
Seated at the worn wooden bar of The Hog's Head, Harry opened his mouth to object, but someone beat him to it.
He had felt the worst for the people, of course, forced to so regularly live under the Dementors oppressive emptiness, with no idea at all what was causing so much of their pain.
An arched eyebrow seemed to be asking if he would be getting to the point any time soon. He took a deep breath.
That tense tone was back, and it gave Harry pause. Suddenly it didn’t actually sound like nothing important, but he would let the subject drop. The middle of a swanky Muggle restaurant was probably not the best place to be discussing strange magical phenomena anyway.
“We might consider a Taboo enchantment. I know, Potter—hear me out first—of a very different sort than the one keeping everyone ‘You-Know-Who’ing for years. We could, theoretically, adapt it to be more limited. It might save us the pressing problem of secrecy on the Muggle end of things.”
“What if I asked you to try it again? On purpose this time.” Draco’s voice was low, and unusually resolute.
Harry would’ve taken that as an affirmative if he weren’t so busy shuddering under the assault to his senses.
They both cursed simultaneously when opening the door did not reveal the petrol-black hall, but instead what was clearly a solar system suspended in actual space. There did not appear to be a floor or ceiling to this room.
He left the ‘don’t touch anything’ unsaid, but Harry didn’t have a death wish so he kept his hands to himself.
, this is astoundingly unfair…” But he shoved Harry back down into his chair, and seated himself firmly on the hardened outline of his cock. “Don’t fucking stop.”
“You want to snog a bit?” Harry finished for him, taking the chance he’d read his intentions properly to press closer.
Draco glared fiercely, his every word cutting in sharp furious syllables, as if it hurt him to say them aloud. “Don’t be fucking
Harry nodded, quirking an easy smile. He couldn’t recall ever properly smiling at Malfoy before, but stranger things had certainly happened to him.
Harry thought he had never looked more attractive—at least, until the next time he watched him come.
“You’ve already promised to feed me, you’ll need to work way harder than that to get me to leave now.”
Beyond knowing it was probably fish, he had no way of knowing what he’d ordered. When he asked, Draco only told him in French which, while admittedly amusing, was not at all helpful.
As they ventured past them, Harry observed a lot of superfluous founts of woven and embroidered blood splashing about. Of course, some of them were quite pretty too, twinkling placidly with stars, or streaked by the white blur of a galloping blessing of unicorns.
He was hard, had been for uncomfortably long, and it was starting to get under his skin. He was finding it very difficult to concentrate on his reading. By seven thirty-five it was too much, and he set aside his book and touched his wand to the board again.
“You wanted to see it. It isn’t a fancy topiary garden with peacocks and a massive greenhouse, but it’s mine.”
He only seemed to realise several beats later who it was that had just questioned him when Harry snickered.
But his world was narrowing in on him, Harry could feel the impending heat tensing, deeper than he could control. “Fu-
“Your father nearly killed me in the Hall of Prophecy—and destroyed a lot of the ‘prophecy’ bit in the process.”
A devious slant to Malfoy’s smirk only caused the simmering heat swirling through him to intensify as he abruptly stepped much closer, brushing his fingers against Harry’s skin again—the barest of touches trailing across his throat. The resulting heat danced its slow way down into Harry’s body, and only left him wanting more.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a long wordless look across the table, and Harry wondered if they realised he could read them like a book after all these years. This would almost certainly be about Draco, then.
It was at once heart-breaking and infuriating, and Harry found himself asking so many questions that he even managed to wear on Savage's normally good mood, more than once. He supposed he would have to do his best to be less overbearing—only without Hermione around to speak up, he felt somewhat obligated to do it himself.
It was late to be having dinner, but Harry had undeniably worked up an appetite in the few hours since he turned up to the library. He let Draco lead him to the kitchen—down several narrower corridors and one particularly curvy stone staircase before they approached a large wooden archway that opened up into the kitchen.
When he shrugged them on, he discovered an unexpected weight in his pocket, and found tucked within it a small potions bottle. It was not the wicked blue potion of earlier, but a smaller green bottle with squared sides.
Harry and Draco spend a rainy afternoon in Muggle London looking at empty lots, then Harry takes him home for tea, among other things.
“Cursed. Must’ve been quite bad, if it’s still here,” Draco mused thoughtfully, dipping one finger into the substance before he was raising it to trace a line across what remained of the curse’s cut on Harry’s cheek.
Malfoy had been nothing but helpful when it came to the research end—invaluable even, as Harry didn’t think he would’ve got so far on his own. There was so much more to do as well, there always would be, and all the more reason he couldn’t outright reject the help when it was being willingly offered.
Harry kissed him with everything he was feeling as he shuddered and rocked through his orgasm in Harry’s lap.
“I do. It’s also one of the biggest rooms in the manor, which is why we’re here. Now let’s get on with the unshrinking, it’s going to be an arduous fucking marathon as it is.”
When he wandered out of Draco’s bathroom to find his clothes, Draco was sitting in one of the dark chairs by his fireplace with a mug of something that smelled of chocolate and cinnamon.
“…I suppose I could.” As usual, he was haughty even despite his fatigue. “But you’ll need to wait if you’re expecting me to do anything requiring movement.”
Malfoy waited for him to open his eyes before taking in the tip of his cock for his tongue to roll against, and Harry discovered it would not be easy to stay upright. His knees already felt weak, and that was before Malfoy started teasing him to the point he felt like he had to thrust in a little deeper.
The bar was quite busy, as wedding bars tended to be, but he hadn’t been waiting very long when he was approached from behind, a heavy hand landing on his shoulder and setting his nerves immediately on edge.
“We’ve fallen a bit behind where I’d hoped we’d be by now, but if we can make it to midnight we’ll be on track again.”
One Saturday afternoon in late March, Harry made enough time to go on a fact gathering mission. He spent well into the afternoon popping around to several of the organisations and charities that he recalled seeing regularly-busy over the last few months. He spoke to whoever he could find, but in particular he wanted to talk to anyone who had a feel for the pulse of the city, and what it needed.
It had been a witness interview, and unfortunately hadn’t amounted to much in the end, but it got Harry away from his cubicle for an afternoon.
Harry thought he might wait in the sitting room, but Draco gathered up Harry’s notebook with his own and followed him out into the kitchen.
Watching the other man writhing and coming beneath him, Harry decided then he would need to invest in a Pensieve, soon.
to yourself. I don’t recall saying anything about your cock,” Draco drawled smugly, as Harry swelled to hardness under his friction. “Or your mouth…”
Harry had just been curious, but given the writhe of Draco’s hips—he decided to just go with it, and discovered he rather enjoyed lingeringly fucking Draco with his tongue. He pulled out occasionally to brush his lips over the sensitive ring, or rub the flat of his tongue against it before he would press back in, each of Draco’s tight quiet moans compelling him on.
hurt, but it hadn’t yet, and undeniably he wanted Draco badly enough he was willing to take the risk.
Charming chocolate-coloured covers down, Draco crawled with exhausted grace up the bed to stretch out on his front, and Harry followed after, flopping down beside him with a bit more
It was nearly half-past Draco’s meeting time before Harry finally watched him step into the sitting room fire and call out the name of a pub Harry had never been to before.
was very wrong… but Draco had been unusually un-snarky when he left that morning, and Harry was a bit worried he might’ve upset him somehow.
Smirking, Draco summarily settled into straddling his lap with maddening grace, and leant in to whisper very softly into his ear. Harry swallowed hard, and not just from the shiver all his whispering stirred up either.
Distracted enough to let himself be led out to the ballroom, so that they might make use of all the mirrors again. As strange as it was to have Draco Malfoy suddenly determined to dress him, he didn’t really care enough about his clothes to bother arguing over it—at least, so long as they were comfortable.
If Draco minded Harry talking about his engagement, he didn’t let on, only shrugged rather disinterestedly.
Sometimes, later into the afternoons at the Ministry, he would daydream about Draco walking in as he had earlier that month…but Draco’s birthday was only once a year.
Now he was daydreaming about what might’ve happened if he and Draco had been forced to work together properly in school. If they’d been taught to collaborate earlier, rather than consistently pitted against each other from the start, then perhaps…
“What the hell?” Harry whispered, a little embarrassed that he had to bite so hard on his lip just to quiet an unsatisfied groan when the touch and the feeling vanished.
“Yes, quite. The much more interesting part is you remembering that particular rumour,” Draco drawled
“Harry?” drifted echoey and concerned from the floor below, barely audible over the sound of running taps.
“Her notes say it’s owned by the borough, but there’s no record of them ever wanting to do anything with it. It’s not for sale—but it’s not used for anything important either. It’s just…an empty lot.”
While he waited for an answer, Harry finally received his drink, but his question had prompted a look of faint trauma to overtake Lawrence’s otherwise churlish expression, at which point he proceeded to bequeath a lesson.
They took a break for tea and food before they got into the casting, but it was getting later in the evening and Draco was anxious to get started, so they made it as quick as they could.
“Fuck, I’m so hard,” he exhaled, a compulsion to breathe finally overruling his need to feel Draco’s tongue all over his.
Harry found himself smirking, until Malfoy caught at his hand again, forcing it beneath troublesome layers of fabric to wrap around his cock. He gripped tentatively—having never tried this for anyone but himself before he was in decidedly unfamiliar territory, but he was pretty sure it all worked the same way.
“Honestly, I’m excited to see what you’ve been working on. You always seem so enthusiastic about it.”
“I—” he tried, and his voice, among other things, was somewhat painfully raw. He tried again. “You’re alright?”
With a desperate noise, Harry pushed up and gave him the space to roll over, and Draco was already whispering spells as he pressed his perfectly pale, undeniably flawless arse up, and back against the length of Harry’s cock.
When Draco eventually pulled out, it was only to slip into his lap once more, spanning it to start in kissing him for a very long while.
“Of course. I’ll owl you then, when I’ve got some of these enchantments in a workable order. And we both ought to practice the base—just be certain to use an Undetectable clause when you ward off wherever you’re practicing.”
. We shared a dorm for years, that doesn’t mean I want to fuck him. He isn’t the one I want to fuck.”
one of our newest cards. …We had also hoped you might be willing to put us in touch with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.”
“But?” Harry turned to look—now that no one was stopping him. He caught Malfoy dropping his robes and undoing the buttons at his wrists.
yes good,” Draco murmured, very carefully pulling Harry’s glasses from his face before ensnaring his lips in a deeper, much more humid kiss—the glasses clattered down into the basin behind him, but neither of them noticed.
He blinked surprise when Malfoy chose two flutes of something bubbly from a small tower of them, and immediately handed one his way.
When he stopped to wait, leaning at the doorway to the bedroom and still delightfully naked, he was already a touch hard. Harry was too when he joined him, capturing saucily smirking lips to kiss them as he pressed Draco briefly to the wooden edge. Draco’s moan was beguilingly stunning when their cocks bumped together in the teasing shift of their hips—as such, it took them a few more minutes before they even made it into the bathroom.
Harry spends a Thursday morning and a bit of the afternoon with Draco at Malfoy Manor, properly delving into casting extensions, and wearing down at Draco's resolve to be all work and no play.
It was likely a good thing he was going to see Ron and Hermione tonight, for a proper chat. Even if Harry was slightly dreading it, it was a reason to get out of the house, and stop replaying Draco’s every touch in his head.
But it was as if he could flip a switch these days. When his denial was feeling robust enough, he could almost pretend he wasn’t being a dishonest snake, for a little while.
It would seem Lawrence had learned this lesson the hard way, and did not want anyone making the same mistakes.
“I can certainly give it some thought. Nothing is coming to mind just now, of course, but if I can find anything I’ll—oh, dear. How will I get in touch with you?”
It was far too easy for Harry to get completely wrapped up in him, forgetting all of the many reasons why he shouldn’t be doing this, surrounded as he was by all of the many reasons why he should—
The lifts came to a stop down the end of the room, and when the gates opened, Draco Malfoy stepped out of them. Harry had only just glanced up quickly, but of course he had to double-take to be sure he hadn’t imagined him.
Draco summoned a couple of chairs to the table, then started in charming a selection of notes and books to float over as well. Harry watched the process, sipping his tea, and finishing off a sandwich and a half.
Given how cheap property was in Ottery St. Catchpole, and additionally, how expensive Malfoy’s robes had always looked, Harry thought there was a good possibility that it was an accurate assessment.
In the red-hot tension that followed, he snapped his hips forward hard. Draco had to press his arm to the mirror to keep from colliding with it, but he moaned louder just the same—murmuring low words in that raw tone Harry couldn’t resist.
Harry’s shirt was left on the floor of one of the narrow curvy corridors when Draco pinned him there to remove it, biting forcefully along the top of his chest.
He’d also spent a ridiculous amount of galleons—the exchange rates hadn’t been the greatest after the war—buying out the tent sections of several shops in the city. It might’ve been a bit excessive, but then he hadn’t really been using the gold anyway. It had been sitting in his vault doing nothing productive, and Harry was very happy to put it toward something useful.
Exhaling some of his nerves, Harry curved his fingers in searchingly to lightly tease at Draco’s prostate, watching the arch of him as he pressed into Harry’s touch. His head tipped down and Draco braced his palms on the mattress, rocking forward over the end of the bed and back ever harder.
Occasionally, when they inhaled at the same time, their lips bumped unintentionally and it was a bit of pleasurable torture.
Malfoy seemed to take the question as some sort of challenge, throwing his weight into rolling them, straddling Harry’s hips and aligning their cocks in one smooth rock of them. Then he thrust forward, and Harry saw stars, an aching hardness trapped in his trousers, caught under a demanding friction when Malfoy began rubbing down on him in slow, steady thrusts.
All Harry really wanted then was sleep, but inevitably they stayed too late—chatting and drinking—and would surely be miserable the next day. Harry and Ginny had said their goodbyes—hugs and handshakes all around, and took the Floo from The Hog’s Head home.
Checking that they were even open, Harry pushed at the door and caught an older woman wiping down tables with a damp cloth just inside. She looked quite tired, and Harry sympathised.
With soapy fingers, Harry stroked over the abused skin of Draco’s arsecheeks with aroused fascination and Draco sucked in a pained breath.
“Don’t forget to sleep, Potter. You look awful. You won’t be very effective casting anything if you’re running yourself into the ground.”
“You must be fully pissed if you think you have any hope of convincing me to care about the plights of destitute muggle masses. As I’ve already told you, it is not my problem…. or yours, for that matter. Just banish the Dementors like a good Auror boy, and walk away.
Never one to mince words Ron Weasley, though even he seemed disinclined to fight Harry any more on the matter.
When he’d finished eating, he sat with his wand hesitating just over the surface of the board, deliberating whether or not he should ask Draco to move the time up.
“I’ve been thinking we ought to convert one of the tents into a sort of office. We’ll need to be in and out fairly regularly, and we’ll need an Apparation point that’s secure and out of sight. Having one on premises would be ideal.”
Harry didn’t press, but nodded understanding, fighting off an absurd urge to start stroking at his hair. Draco looked annoyed, Harry really didn’t want to get snapped at again.
Harry immediately wrapped his lips around them, brushing with his tongue to taste the bitter salt of Draco’s come on the pads of his fingers, and they moaned together. Irresistible lips soon covered his again as Draco arched to kiss him, and ease slowly off his cock, only breaking the lock of their lips to whisper a couple quiet cleansing charms.
The atrium also had a second level, balconies which ran along two of its curved sides, though they connected across the middle via an old-looking black iron bridge.
Draco’s cock stiffened before very long, but Harry kept at it intently—until Draco tightened around his tongue with a rather desperate groan.
He threw himself into his work instead. A stack of Auror reports, waiting for him in his Ministry cubicle, would hopefully be distraction enough to stop Harry thinking on all of the many ways he was literally fucking his life sideways.
He made the time to meet with Neville in Diagon Alley one afternoon to consider some of the plants at Noltie's Botanicals, and discuss Harry’s garden.
When he attached his mouth to Harry’s nipple, tonguing over it repeatedly, Harry arched under him with a breathless gasp—surging with a heat which only grew more pointed when Draco caught the tiny peak between his teeth.
Perhaps he hadn't entirely known what he was asking for, but Malfoy had promised satisfaction. Harry needed to know if he meant it.
Draco didn’t need to know what he was saying to come over his hand and all over his shirt with a very deep moan.
Harry didn’t have it in him to refuse an offer like that. Draco shrugged his robes off, tossing them over the back of a chair and Harry followed suit.
“So you say, but I’ve seen the dashing robes and the fancy holsters you lot get. All a bit over the top, if you ask me.”
When he wasn’t working or struggling to sleep, Harry was practising the modified Extension spell as much as he could.
He made it only a few days into the first week before Harry could no longer take spending all evening after work faffing around the house. He couldn’t focus on his reading or his spells, even despite now having the privacy and spare time to cast them.
It took a ridiculous amount of his already dwindling energy, but Harry made it through the painstaking steps of the spell, all twenty-seven minutes of it, though when he was finished he was a touch unsteady on his feet. Whether he noticed or not, Draco took hold of Harry’s wrist and tugged him into the tent.
Harry wondered if Lawrence minded terribly that his new wife had Gryffindor friends, but not sensing any hostility, he allowed his guard to relax a bit more.
When they were both as clean as they were going to get and the water started going fully cold on them, Harry stopped running his hands all over the slick wetness of Draco’s body long enough to shut it off. They went on snogging in the not-running shower for several more minutes before either of them had the presence of mind to use a drying charm and go back to the bedroom.
Then he was crushing their lips together, and Harry was so relieved, he felt as if all the air had been knocked out of him.
She opened one toward the bottom, full of several flat stacks of folders that had just enough clearance for the dome of the light, and they tried it there. It was faint, but when the light was on it was visible from the outside—and Cassie promised to check it on occasion as well.
The Ministry had come to all of them the year before asking for speeches, and all three of them had refused in perpetuity. Harry had suggested Minerva in his place and, as she had last year, she gave one of the more powerfully heart-wrenching speeches that morning. They had all been a bit overwhelmed, and Harry was unable to stop his emotion overflowing some as she named so many of those they had lost. It hadn’t entirely helped that Hagrid was openly weeping into his handkerchief several seats down.
“You cared,” Harry said and did his best to avoid grinning smugly. “You either cared or you pretended to care.”
“If I’d known you were coming, I would’ve cleaned the place spotless,” said a grizzled voice dryly from behind the pub’s counter. “Not many Malfoys deign to grace my humble pub.”
His disdainful superiority and sharp iciness was back, contrasting several months spent watching him falling apart in a hot sort of ecstasy, it was only feeding into Harry’s temper. Glaring searchingly at an impassive grey stare, Harry wanted to see him feel something, as he was feeling—and beneath his escalating anger he was hurt, and very jealous.
He opened his mouth to argue but Draco arched an eyebrow and Harry took a slightly annoyed bite of his sandwich instead.
Draco arched an eyebrow at him. “You really only asked the once…the first time round my cock was in your mouth.”
“That’s quite the assumption,” Draco drawled, but he was watching Harry from the corner of his eye, and Harry absolutely caught that hitch in his breathing.
Monday evening after work, he was just finishing up a bowl of magically reheated soup when Ron popped in unexpectedly, flaring out of the Floo at about quarter-past-six.
Through the heat Harry was determined to watch him, indefinable in the low light, and Draco watched him back with dazed silver darkness.
Harry chewed his lip, not entirely sure how to even begin to explain. He felt quite silly, but ultimately settled on the truth—for the good of the spell.
Three of the Dementors cleared off immediately under the assault, as three others skirted around the chaos to continue their deathly hovering procession.
And Draco was right there, even and controlled as he walked Harry through the spell’s complexities—and he smelled so intoxicatingly good that Harry was getting a little hard, even before Draco pressed firmly against him from behind, brushing his lips at the nape of Harry’s neck.
Clumsy from sleep, it took him a moment to find the coordination, but then Harry was trailing his palms down the smooth stretch of Draco’s back and beneath a thin layer of sheets to the perfectly bare curves of his arsecheeks. He palmed them a bit excessively before he forced Draco firmly down, pulling them ever-tighter together. Draco’s rhythm sped under his hands, a rising urgency, and in their quick escalation they filled the room with heavy gasps of exertion, an abundance of groaning, and the soft sound of shifting sheets.
There was a frustrated exasperation in the narrow of Draco’s eyes. He licked slowly up Harry’s cock, tasting his tip until he squirmed, but then Draco moaned pushing up to crash their lips together again, hurrying to get his trousers off.
“What’s happening in Whitehall and Westminster?” Harry asked, making conversation and catching himself up as they headed for the tiny lift.
When he cast his first attempt, the bag apparently did not stand a chance. Rather than do what it was meant to, the charm he cast burst it open, and tiny bits of brown paper rained down on them like drab confetti.
In the space of a heartbeat Harry came with jolting thrusts and a tight groan—entirely lost in Draco and heat for the duration, before he gently lowered himself into collapsing atop him.
For most of the rest of July, Harry went back to work, his studies, his training, and all the rest of it. The intervening time seemed to fly past much too quickly—despite his being perpetually deficient on sleep, or perhaps because of it.
“You may want to start by buttoning your trousers,” Malfoy drawled with obvious amusement, rising to his feet. He cast a short but effective cleansing spell over them both, and yet another had his buttons do up themselves.
“Oh! Oh my…that’s not really an easy ask you know; we tell each other absolutely everything and you’re—well, you’re
Harry was asleep in minutes, and did not hear Draco’s sigh of exasperated resignation as he stretched out in the bed to sleep beside him.
His eyes had to adjust to the dim inside-light before Harry spotted Hagrid sat in his chair, wrapped in a quilt, and soundly asleep. He looked peaceful at rest, despite the ear-ringing snores.
However, when the rain finally started in earnest, Draco spent a good several minutes opening and closing the umbrella in curious fascination before he allowed Harry to actually use it. By the time he seemed satisfied in his understanding of how it worked, they were both a bit wet already.
Without looking away from him, Harry adjusted his wand, and pushed in and up, gently searching with its wooden tip as Draco’s cock stiffened taller.
Instead, Harry reached out to pull him closer, palming one sharp cheek to kiss him with a quietly muffled moan. Draco pressed in and kissed him back, fitting warmly to his front, and as thin as the silk was he might as well have been naked.
Quite unconsciously he licked at his lips as he worked open Draco’s trousers, and when he chanced to look up the shift in energy between them sparked considerably.
For simplicity’s sake, it was all one floor, the kitchen and sitting room interconnecting at the entrance to the tent, and further in was a bathroom, and two bedrooms.
It felt far too good to question what was causing it, but Harry endured several more shots of heat when Draco’s muted moan hummed against his back, the prod of a pointed nose into the curve of his neck—and the hard nudge of Draco’s cock against his arse.
Harry did not. Instead, he plodded on with the subject, as he was becoming more and more convinced it might actually work—even despite the bit where Malfoy was telling him how incredibly illegal it all was.
Draco moaned very loudly for him, a pointed nose pressing to his cheek, and Harry ignored an intense breathlessness to kiss him, lightheaded as Draco drew out his slow riding.
Draco was obviously attempting to be the voice of reason, but Harry was looking at him with imploring green eyes, as he appeared to be having a very difficult time denying him.
Some of their clothes were quite worn, and many were heavily layered with jumpers and jackets. A number of people in the queue carried with them a range of carts, sleeping bags, rolled-up tarps, and any number of other possessions.
When Harry turned to head back to the tent, he discovered Draco was standing just behind him. He nearly ran him over, although he wasn’t exactly complaining to find him so close. Unfortunately, Draco had other reasons for hovering.
Draco still had Harry’s wand. He whispered a quiet charm, and a clear slickness dripped down the wood. Harry watched him spread it down from the tip, his cock jumping jealously.
Just at the end of the corridor, a low balcony overlooked the neatly tended grounds of the manor house, which Harry could only assume belonged to either the Waddell or Lester family. The balcony’s tall glass doors had been thrown open, allowing in a cooling night breeze, and several long splashes of bright moonglow.
Despite his saying they were invisible, Draco looked about a bit anyway. Harry only barely managed not laughing.
“Interesting,” Harry teased with the sort of naturally charming half-grin that seemed to get Draco all hot and bothered.
“I’m sorry, Gin. Only at least let me get another drink or two before you ask me to make a fool of myself in public.”
Harry was ready to move on, but he was momentarily distracted watching Draco idly stirring his teacup. It took him a beat to snap out of it.
Even as his climax spun forcefully through him, Harry was trying to find the sense not to press back on Draco’s cock any more than he already had. Draco shifted them both away from that temptation to slowly thrust the full length of his cock between Harry’s cheeks, spreading cooling seed all between them. There was quite a lot of it.
“Potter?” Malfoy finally sat up, snapping long fingers in front of Harry’s face. “Have you been Stunned?”
Draco hummed a quietly contented noise at him, a sort of charming rightness to the sound, stirring a slight smile to tug at Harry’s lips, even as he drifted unknowingly into darker dreams.
A glance down between them made clear Draco was already hard again but Harry shifted down to suck at his cock for a bit anyway, until he moaned so much Harry was achingly hard too. Then he was moving back up, his mouth in search of Draco’s, and Draco greeted him tracing Harry's lips with his tongue, teasing slowly between them.
As the Saturday he was meant to meet with Draco again approached—Harry felt somewhat more prepared than he had for their meeting the week before. He’d actually practiced this time, and was getting the base Extension spell almost perfect—he thought. He wanted Draco’s input first, as he had a much more critical eye for detail than Harry.
He often wished for the power to wave his wand, and solve it all at once—but Harry knew they had a lot of work yet to do. That they were actually making progress was one silver lining to help get him through his week. Another, that at the end of the week not only would they be making further progress but he’d get to see Draco again as well, and possibly even pay him back for that parting tease of his.
Draco groaned deeply, shifting one hand off the basin’s ceramic edge, far more daringly balanced as he reached between them, stroking firmly at his cock and intentionally smearing a few impatient drops over Harry’s abs.
However, when they were nearly done, Draco broke their otherwise thoughtful silence a little urgently.
Caught just as deep in the snare of his own lust, Harry naturally pressed back. His tightness only barely gave way—but just enough for a final burst of Draco’s heat to get inside—and then Harry was coming very suddenly too, adding to the mirror’s sticky mess.
“It was pecking incessantly at the corridor window. I’ve tried collecting the letter myself, but that only starts it screeching at me. I wasn’t sure if I should wake you, but I thought it might be important.”
“Think I might grab something to eat at Hagrid’s then. Maybe you’ll go get the latest on what everyone’s been up to for me?”
Draco trailed off, intently scrawling a note on something at the far corner of the page. Harry sipped his tea, waiting for him to finish writing before he continued.
He had to slide his tip around some to find it—and when he did, he thrust in hard, pushing past pliant muscle to sink himself in about half-way. He could feel the heat radiating off Draco’s body entangled with his, the press of tensing thighs on his arms as he sunk in deeper.
Draco rocked back on his cock with a low, shouted cry, and came all over the back of the chair. Harry nearly tipped it over, he was thrusting so hard then, surrendering to a long accumulation of ecstasy as he came into the perfect tight of Draco’s arse.
Harry got a better idea of what all the Protean Charm involved on the casting end of things—for a half hour or so—but as before, when Draco was standing so close to him, guiding Harry’s wand in motion, all his many doubts came rushing back to him.
Smirking, Draco caught at his hair, pulling his lips down to ravish thoroughly, rocking up to meet his rhythm when Harry's hips sped. Every kiss hurt, but as raw as his lips were he let Draco kiss them anyway, in exchange for all the throaty cursing he breathed over them.
Harry sighed. It was a lot to ask, for a goal that might ultimately be total folly, or even outright harmful. The work Draco had already done was a lot to ask, and apparently all in exchange for a half-arsed drunk Ministry tour and a clumsy hand job.
,” Draco murmured, and the chandeliers in the ballroom went out, bathing them both in total darkness.
He didn’t need to search for his friends very long. He found the lot of them—everyone left at so late an hour—packed into The Hog’s Head Inn.
Draco arched a questioning eyebrow at him, the fine strands of his hair frazzled from sleep. He was completely shirtless, wearing only a pair of silvery silk pyjama bottoms which left absolutely nothing to the imagination.
The room was keyed to only accept magic from Aurors—Draco wouldn’t be able to get back out without him, but Harry didn’t think that would be a problem.
Sighing as if Harry were spoiling all his fun, Draco gave in. “It’s a sort of fish soup. Halibut, with lemon and herbs and such. I’m sure it’s exquisite, everything here is.”
He dangled the spoon over Draco’s cock, drizzling lazily and watching it stiffen at his pronouncement. He made sure to get his bollocks and a bit of his thighs—but the spoon was nearly out of honey now.
Harry kissed him back, teasing deeper into his mouth to flick against his tongue in turn—but then Draco was pulling back, and shifting down between his legs again.
But the details were already fading away from him, and by the time he was half into his morning tea, Harry could only recall the cool glow of the prophecies, and the reflection of that same light in a pair of silver eyes.
Pressed closely to so much bare skin, he nearly gave in to the temptation to start touching him, but they were wearing a lot of residual mess after last night. Harry didn’t mind the mess most of the time, but this was a bit excessive even for him.
Harry was significantly more sober now than he had been when he first arrived, and he sat now on the edge of Draco’s ridiculously soft bed and summoned his trousers off the floor.
Finally giving in to his fight with gravity Harry let himself fall back, head finding a spot pillowed somewhere beside the vicinity of Malfoy’s hip. If there were any complaints to be had, Malfoy didn’t voice them, and as they fell into silence, both men seemed to find some contenting distraction in the vast carpet of stars above them. Harry was half off the lounge, but it was comfortable enough.
His breathing went ever more uneven pushing a tangle of pants and trousers down Draco’s thighs, watching the long length of him point heavily at the mirror.
“Imagine killing one of the most powerful wizards in living memory, and what do you receive for your troubles? A cubicle.”
“You took the potion, Potter. What’s wrong with you?” Malfoy was infuriatingly smug. “I had originally planned on finding someone to enjoy it with after I left this perfectly morbid occasion… It was only just my luck the Savior of all Wizardom decided to follow me into the forest.”
“Alright, Harry?” Ginny appeared to have finally extricated herself from where Percy had been updating her on his latest clerical accomplishments.
Beyond being an insufferable prick, and often a hateful one, there was also the attempted poisoning that had nearly killed Ron, and the necklace which had nearly killed Katie. They were unsuccessful murder attempts, but Draco’s intent to kill had been undeniably there.
Summoning another sheet off the top of the stack, Draco caught his eye, smirking as though he were fully following the less-than-innocent trajectory of Harry's one-track mind. Consequently, Harry’s next set of curtains came out slightly lopsided again, but fortunately he managed to fix them on his own this time.
“You want it?” he asked breathlessly, lust-shadowed green landing intently on silver in their reflection once more.
That was Hermione’s department. She hadn’t mentioned a problem with Dementors recently, but what with her working in the Being Division, and with her full focus on the drafting of new legislation on what constituted a Creature in the first place, Harry supposed she had bigger things to worry about than Dementors.
“Here’s what I’ve been able to find in our library. It’s not everything that I’ve got but it will get you started. Essentially—”
However if he had known they were going to go traipsing about where they were not meant to be, he might not’ve had quite so many drinks.
They’d said they would be quick, only they were into such an agonisingly good rhythm, Harry didn’t want to stop now—Draco didn’t appear to be in a rush anymore either.
“We’ll probably need to tell her what we’re really up to eventually as well,” Harry reasoned. “I can’t be on top of what’s happening in London all the time and you certainly aren’t going to be volunteering for that.”
It was approaching noon, but Draco summoned what they needed for a late morning tea, and they ate in the garden with the peacocks.
Perhaps if she thought he was there on official Ministry business, she would be more inclined to answer his questions. As intrinsically intwined as the issues of the Dementors and the security of both communities really were, it wasn’t so far off either. He could keep to himself the fact he was actually going a bit rogue on this.
When they were finished with ward practice, they paused to have a quick late dinner at quarter-past eight. It was only leftover duck, but Draco made them each a strong cup of coffee as well, something to help them through the work they had left to do.
As the conversation petered off, Harry became sure they would now part ways. He even considered grabbing a glass for Ginny, if only to make up for his behavior at the wedding a few months ago—but Malfoy proceeded to distract him with a question.
person you should expect to support your little lost cause. Why are you even talking to me about this? Where are your usual suspects?”
“Our main goal will be drawing the Dementors away as much as possible, before we do any casting. They’ll always go for a Wizard’s essence first, ‘seems they’ve got a taste for us,” Savage explained, nose wrinkling in disgust.
Catching the annoyed narrow of grey eyes in the mirror, Harry smiled a bit cheekily, but then Draco smirked back at him—and deliberately took even longer shifting about delicate platinum strands.
. Harry couldn’t shake the fear he might lose most of the people he cared about if they discovered the full extent of his involvement with Draco—and the thought of losing any of them was absolutely terrifying, more even than his Gryffindor bravery could entirely overcome.
He braced a steadying hand on Draco’s hip, rocking his own to gently slide his cock in deeper, losing himself now in tight heat. If Draco took issue with Harry’s gentleness he didn’t complain, and when he turned his head, panting across Harry’s throat, Harry chased his lips to kiss him hard, his cock twitching eagerly inside. Draco met each of his drawn-out thrusts with low, enticing moans.
His voice was so hushed and even, Harry found it impossible to read him—and apparently, he wasn’t allowed to look either. He also couldn’t really deny to himself what Malfoy being so close was doing to him.
Harry fought off a yawn, ultimately surrendering to it, and Draco’s drawl continued, a faint amusement bordering his tone.
He had a lot more to get done that evening, but he wanted to go over some of his notes before he set in to the bulk of it. Only he would have to do so whilst also eating dinner, because he was running out of hours, and knew he needed to attempt getting as much sleep as possible for tomorrow.
. The desire to bite them even more so was strong, but the heavy hard length of Harry's cock would’ve painfully protested the neglect. He whispered a spell to slick himself and rubbed slippery between Draco’s cheeks before pushing in past tight muscle, their relaxant spells of earlier long since dissipated.
On the other hand combining them with the Dementors tell-tale cold became indication enough they were on the right track.
It was getting toward evening when they found themselves standing in Harry’s sitting room, significantly less furious with each other than they had been at the start.
Closing the lid, he considered the box a moment longer before passing it back to Harry. “I don’t see why it wouldn’t. Shall we get started?”
Every month it seemed there was a new announcement of engagement, families beginning, weddings being planned. Ron and Hermione had been one of the first to take the leap, and surprisingly it had caused Harry no small amount of conflict. To him it felt as though they were rushing things a bit. He was happy for his best friends of course, if they were happy, but it had all seemed to happen so quickly.
and was expected by most of the Wizarding World, and his closest friends, to marry her at some point in the next year or two.
“I know I was hateful.” Draco cut him off sharply, not quite meeting Harry’s eye. “Only I thought I was right. My father, my aunt—really, everyone I had ever respected or loved thought you all disgustingly naïve and stupid, and I believed them.”
He went to open the door, but of course it was still locked, and he shot an impatient look over his shoulder.
“—then I had to take a broom up and go all over the ceiling charming gum out of the rafters. It was a bloody mess.”
Harry flushed, and though he wanted to, couldn’t deny that he’d been jealous, or that he was surely the reason Draco wasn’t presently back in his library working on the spellcraft.
Harry swallowed tightly. Draco showered for him. Should he have showered? He’d showered that morning before work, and had only sat at his desk all day—he was probably alright.
Taking in each wavering moan, the eager rock of hips and pale hands bracing on rough stone walls as Harry swallowed him deeper—he didn’t think he needed that much practice.
Harry held firm, letting him fuck himself on his fingers—he looked incredible doing it. He may have wanted to press his cock inside with a red-hot sort of intensity, but he wasn’t going to rush this.
Malfoy laughed humourlessly. “Good luck with that job, Potter. You won’t find me skulking about on Muggle backstreets anytime soon. I must draw the line somewhere.”
“Yes, your cock is making that exceptionally clear,” Draco taunted low, nipping back at Harry’s in turn. “Only remember you’ve promised to make this quick.”
Harry worked up to the base of his cock, tonguing at the honey collected there before he was murmuring over sensitive skin. “What do you want?”
They were all rather relieved when George passed a flask down the line and everyone indulged in a sip—even Hermione, who Harry noted looked very tired. He would need to ask her later how her work was coming along.
Harry got fantastically lost in hot kisses and seductive friction before he managed to breathe the spells they needed over Draco’s lips. His legs hooked over the backs of Harry’s thighs—but when Harry tried pressing in, even with the ease of the spells his moan went tight and pained and Harry held up, his tip leaking slickly on the inviting whirl of his arse.
“I’m not wearing a coat, Potter. Also, I gave them all fancy new clothes when the house passed to me. Most of them have moved on to Hogwarts.”
While he was at it, he finally got around to owling Luna as well, asking after her, and catching her up on what everyone else had been up to.
Of course, Harry hadn’t been listening at all, too caught up in his own thoughts on how he shouldn’t want to be kissing Draco—now Draco’s lips were so soft, every breath on his neck so chill-inducing, it was even more impossible to focus—and surely Draco knew that.
Malfoy surveyed the rounded brass box curiously, turning it over in his hands before he prised open its lid. It clinked slow notes at them, the key having not been wound.
Harry was confused for the long stretch of uncomfortable silence it took to dawn on him—Draco had actually used the Protean Charm before, to communicate with Madam Rosmerta, when he’d had her under Imperius. Harry recalled her testimony at Draco’s trial, and while he might not’ve harmed her physically, Imperius was a violation of will on a profoundly disturbing level—there was a reason it was Unforgivable.
Chewing his lip, Harry waited for Draco’s messages to vanish, and vanished his own before sliding the small rectangular slate back into his bedside table for the night.
“What about you?” Harry asked impulsively, if only to steer the conversation off his infidelity. Thankfully Draco usually liked talking about himself.
He picked up a rhythm, teasing a touch up to rub just behind his bollocks, and Harry’s humming muffled around a slight choke when Draco started pushing more persistently into the back of his throat.
Soothing his palm up flushing skin, pushing Draco’s shirt up with it, Harry held him firmly to the mirror, speeding harder thrusts and chasing louder cries, until Draco’s writhing stilled as he came over the reflective glass, and himself.
They could easily have gone on with their whispered argument, but they had reached the door to their destination. Harry was very careful to both open and close it behind them as cautiously as possible.
all the measuring and the timings and the numbers, and then you needed to worry that the instructions might be horribly wrong. He was capable enough, but the work itself took a lot more out of him.
They were a few ticks late for their meeting, and by the time they returned to the now Dementor-free road the queue had shortened down to nearly naught.
“Fair,” Harry answered quietly, and felt it curiously natural to curl his arms around Draco, pulling him back more securely. Fighting off an impulse to nuzzle into the soft hair tickling his cheek, his heartbeat thumped so loudly in his ears then that he was sure Draco could feel it, just as he could feel the nervous shift in Draco’s breathing.
Harry bristled. He didn’t have to be such a prick about it, though apparently, he was not done being one.
Draco shot him an exasperated look. “Do I really have to tell you not to talk with your mouth full, Potter?”
Draco wasn’t being outright rude, not any more than normal, but there was an obvious wall of cool detachment when he spoke that had not been there before.
It was probably not the wisest of plans for him to be wandering drunk through an old magic house that he was mostly unfamiliar with, and which was known to contain rather a lot of Dark Magic secrets. Yet Harry carried on, ever more a Gryffindor when the burn of firewhisky was lowering most of his inhibitions.
“We’ll be headed to the surface through the visitor’s entrance today; our business is in Whitehall and Westminster, and that’ll drop us right where we need to be.”
“Alright, I think I’ve sorted them. If I’m right, then it should be fairly simple to frame them out and tie them all into a single illusion, wherein the illusion is really just a reflection of whatever’s actually on the other side. You understand?”
Draco was silent a moment before he answered, reluctantly. “I don’t suppose you want to talk about whatever it is you’re trying to forget?”
Draco’s eyebrow quirked with an aroused sort of amusement, but as Harry’s gaze travelled naturally down between them, Draco’s cock twitched hard as he very slowly spread his legs for Harry.
Even just waiting there with his arms crossed he was oddly attractive. A multitude of well-familiar idiosyncrasies, from the stiffly impatient tilt of his head to the over-poised set of his shoulders, little things Harry had once found quite profoundly irritating, now he could only think of how thoroughly he’d traced every bare inch with his tongue in the late hours of the night.
Seated on a spindly wooden bench in his attic to read it, Harry Potter was smiling—try as he might to stifle it.
Savage seemed to brighten even as he spoke, as if this logic could put the whole of the matter behind them.
“Oh,” Draco drawled in distracted annoyance, crossing the other half of the bridge to hand off the curvy bottle.
Harry panted through the speeding slam of their hips, and Draco went on moaning hoarsely, arching under Harry’s rougher touch down his back. In the undertow of heat between them, Harry was well beneath the surface, too deep to hold anything back.
“I’m not here to take over your balcony,” Harry found himself snapping back, despite some minor slurring.
Before he stood however, he gave the soft rise of Draco’s arse a strong smack, and his subsequent moan echoed resonantly through the library.
It was nice to see her so happy, but as always, the double-edged sword of his betrayal hung over them in the back of Harry’s mind, colouring every moment.
He nearly dropped his wand, but Draco took it from his hand and tossed it onto the desk beside them.
Did he really feel that way? Was there something more behind the dismissiveness of his shrug, or was Harry overthinking the whole thing?
Reigning in his control, Harry thrust through the bliss, slowing the push of his cock, but not straying from steadily sliding over Draco’s prostate. He watched raptly in the mirror as Draco’s eyes fell shut with a rhapsodic gasp, rocking back to meet his thrusts in a tranquil rhythm.
Snorting a quiet laugh, Harry spent a moment in thoughtful hesitation before posing the question he’d been wanting to ask since they’d walked in.
Harry slipped out his wand, tapped his own board, and beneath Draco’s careful script, Harry’s unruly scrawl spelled out:
Harry quirked a faintly amused eyebrow at the commandeering of his wand, but he didn’t question it. It appeared to obey Draco as it did Harry, and Harry had certainly used Draco’s before.
“I’m not sure we’ll need to; with a bit of Transfiguration and a few minor adjustments it should be easy enough to convert without rebuilding the internal structure. We ought to choose one with an extra room, then we’ll have somewhere for storage as well, which we’ll clearly need.”
“Malfoy.” Harry wasn’t in the mood for unnecessary insults just then, especially not at the expense of the dead. “Anyway, not exactly. Sirius told me about the whole thing long before Teddy—er, came about.”
He'd caught a curse to the face during one investigation gone awry, and spent more than half a day being Healed for a nasty cut beneath his left eye. Harry didn’t think it would scar but it would probably take a while to heal properly.
Ginny accepted his glass, and then did not seem inclined to return it. Her silence was unnerving him a bit.
“For comfort—well obviously I originally thought heating spells would be prudent, but that was in January. What with us heading into summer now, probably a Temperate charm makes more sense. Works for all seasons.”
But Harry couldn’t really bring himself to argue with his partner either, who seemed to be the sort not to want to rock the boat when it came to the complicated office politics always hanging over every Ministry job. He also knew it was rather silly of him to expect Savage to have the answers to all of his questions. They had only really been given enough information to carry out the task the Ministry was asking of them.
Draco requited with a harder bite to his trapped prick, and left Harry throbbing in protest when he sat upright, taking the heat of his mouth away from where Harry wanted it so badly.
Grateful for the change of subject, Harry launched into a summary of the latest office politics and gossip for the last bit of their walk to the house.
Forty-five or so minutes later he was still brooding when the fire in his hearth flickered and sputtered, and Draco Malfoy dropped out into his sitting room in a swirl of grey soot. He’d changed out of his pyjamas.
“Really well…” Harry nosed in to nip rather possessively at his throat. “I also wanted to see how you were getting along with the intent problems.”
Knelt on the floor just between his knees, Harry only licked his lips and caught his breath, until Draco slid off the cushions and into his lap to kiss him. They moaned together as he took his time tasting himself on Harry’s tongue, his free hand sneaking between them to rub at Harry’s cock through his trousers.
“Oh, I nearly forgot,” he drawled, digging in his pocket a moment while Harry watched curiously before he produced a small blue velvet drawstring bag, and laid it on the table between them.
What with the privacy charms, the worst that might happen was someone would hear them—so long as Malfoy didn’t start shouting his name it would probably be fine...
“I’ve got more of the wards to sort out. It might take another week—two at most, but I’m hoping not.”
Harry got his answer in several deliberate bites into the flushing skin down his throat. Draco’s mouth was hot on his skin, and his teeth sent shots of pleasure straight to Harry’s cock.
Draco slipped around to face him, his lips only just brushing Harry’s, barely any contact at all—beyond the captivating lock of their eyes.
“Er, yes—that is, I think we’ve settled on a good spot, and we have plans for it, but we’re still working out some of the magical logistics. It’ll be much easier to show you than trying to explain it all, but—if you’re still interested, when we’re ready, I’ll be in touch with the push light to plan a time to meet. Hopefully no more than a few weeks or so, roughly.”
He kept the Portkey in his pockets the rest of the week, and as the meeting drew closer, it became a weighted reminder of his plans—a reminder that often sent his thoughts spiralling off into a debate over whether or not any of it was really a good idea. Wouldn’t he only be causing more trouble than all their efforts were worth? As an Auror, how could he justify breaking the laws this way?
He caught her hand, kissing the simple gold band on her left ring finger, and Ginny smiled a genuine, soft sort of smile at him.
They didn’t mention the wake in the invitations, of course, it was the ‘Second Annual, Second Wizarding War, Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance Memorial Ceremonies’. It was an all-day affair.
“It’s very old, it’s got a mind of its own sometimes.” He tugged at Harry’s sleeve. “Come on. Library’s this way.”
“Wondering about what, exactly? If I might’ve change sides before the end of the war? If we would’ve fucked sooner? I doubt it. You hated me.”
Harry smiled soft uncertainty, not just at the prospect of having to dress up either. There were many reasons ‘why not’. The Muggle world was one of the only places they could safely be out together in public, but even then, it would be chancy. Even Cassie was somewhat of a risk, especially considering her sister.
