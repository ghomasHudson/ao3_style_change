he’ll start hexing left and right, but mostly because he doesn’t actually want his friend, possible crush, to have a heart attack.
“His father?!” Remus continues, “You want him to be
Harry goes jogging to him, but Krum just waves off his fellow Durmstrangs and walks calmly until they meet.
He comes in with a box that he nearly drops when he sees them.
Hermione breaths in like it’s nothing, so Harry tries it and it comes out like a stuttering mess. Still, she tells him to try again and the trails on his back don’t stop for a second. They work together until he can breath without smelling smoke and only then does he notice the oddities of the night.
“Yep! But Misty won’t have to be jumping with Mister Draco repairing!”
“He’s already gotten to Harry, Ginny, and now
The story goes that Carla showed up at June’s shop during one of Draco’s teaching sessions, slammed a piece of parchment in front of his face, and then confiscated his wand until it was filled out. She didn’t tell him what it was for, what she was going to do with it, but all of it was about the art of potion making, how long he’s been brewing, and small, obvious details about him. In all honesty, he thought nothing of it. Thought it was some sort of weird qualification to give to the people who are still a little skeptical of him.
WARNING! There is child abuse in this chapter! It's starts out from Harry's point of view also! Be prepared!
side!” There’s no malice behind his words, and the smile really dampens the whining effect, but it makes Draco laugh. Blaise does a weak impression of it that has them all snickering and for a moment he can breathe easily.
Draco laughs.
“Harry James Potter! I have half the mind to hex you, young man! Do you have any idea how worried we’ve been?”
LuLu warms up to him like she’d been personally birthed for his every need. Within an hour it’s like she knows him better than he knows himself, keeping still while he studies, rubbing against him when he begins to get frustrated. When there’s a knock on his door, one he recognizes as his Call for Crucio, LuLu blocks his path, growling.
The point, the real one, is that this is weird behavior for Harry. Harry, who just realized the person he saw die was his mate’s mum. Less saw and more experienced, really, which just makes the whole thing worse.
“Oh, so you didn’t want to see us?”
Hermione, the best of them all. He loved her when all he knew about her was her annoying knowledge, and he can't imagine life without her, not now, not ever. He’d be lost without her and Ron at his side.

“Mister Draco be needing a shirt.” She says once he’s finally calmed down.
And his shirt! Theo’s gone and forced him into a short-sleeve, silk button down, with not one, but
“Draco!”  She cries, opening her arms wide and suddenly he’s safe and warm and almost happy. They stay close for a few moments before his mother pulls away to cup his face. “Look at my boy, you’ve grown so much! I can’t believe I haven’t seen you in so long, I can’t believe I missed your birthday! We’ll simply have to celebrate it tomorrow..”
but also because he’s very tired and would very much like to go to sleep now.
It's a slowburn, I won't lie. Like I'm mid way through writing chapter seven and harry and draco still haven't come in contact, mainly because it's primarily about draco healing after the war, all the chapters are twenty pages long (bare minimum), so it's a long fic so far.
Snape switches his brow’s height, the right one springing up as the left one burrows down, “Get on with it then.”
The Gang: We have to leave Hermione alone
It’s nice, Theo’s hug. Warm, but not uncomfortably so. Something he honestly never thought he’d get to experience again. His friend smells like cinnamon and nutmeg, with just a hint of old spice and it takes him back to simpler times, back when he, Theo, and Blaise would argue over who smelled the best.
Harry gets to experience love, from family that he has now, friends that he never expected to make, and the biggest asshole that always makes him warm. He gets to feel happiness, but only if the world’s biggest killer comes with the little joy that’s filling his life.
“Teasing you is much more fun.”
“You told her?”
Well, he might not live up to Anvi, but he can definitely picture her holding on for dear life as an angry dragon tries to fly away.
Also Draco, looking at the paper: oh. that trauma.
Lucius doesn’t suspect a thing. Draco feels an odd sense of pride at how easily and perfect his mother’s lie came. She truly is brilliant. His father takes the cup without suspecting a thing, one large swig later and he’s frowning.
“Draco, get on with it.”
Dumbledore mules over this from behind his tiny glasses. The office hasn’t changed much from last year. Still bright and cheery, filled to the brim with odds and bits that delight him to no end. Fawkes perches on his shoulder as he takes in a new ornament or two, waiting for his owner to respond.
A click of a lock is heard and Harry really wishes he wasn’t so curious all the time.
“I have Howie’s renovation plans to fix! We have to start in a week or we won’t make it in time for the Holiday break!”
Sirius looks out into the night with a sigh, “And then we went to Hogwarts. And I wasn’t put in Slytherin. I begged the hat, I knew what would happen as soon as I was in Gryffindor reds. Father was close to death, Mother had wanted to disown me from birth. Bella was starting to lose her sanity, Regulus was being black mailed into Voldemort’s arms, and Sissy...she was too scared to stick her neck out for anyone that wouldn’t benefit her. It was shit. Got my first howler that told me I was disowned, and I really thought there was nothing left for me. But then I met James and Remus.”
It looks just like it always does, except, instead of reading
Currently, he sits in Mrs. Daisy’s shop, trying her latest creation: a matcha chai.

“Luna.” Draco sighs, “She needs someone in fourth year or higher to take her and I don’t want her missing out. She’ll love the decor.”
And now he’s here, half naked in a dying house, wondering if she’d still smile at him after everything. If she managed to make it to Japan, if she was caught, or if she was-
Blaise and Hermione glare, but Fred and George nod. Draco sighs, “He’s got a point.”
Hair still messed up from sleep, shirtless and in pants a little on the big side, yawning and making Sirius’s heart double in size.

(See the end of the chapter for
“And how do I know you won’t hurt him? I know you’re on our side but-”
That’s crazy, Draco. Even by our standards! We don’t even know if it’s true!”
“Who?”
Nothing except going to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast and finding out that Sirius Black, the murder out to get Potter, was in the fucking building and had ruined the Fat Lady’s painting.
Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him about his last school visit with dear old dad. He takes a deep breath, “Speaking of being safe. I’ve found out who has the diary.”
Something about ignorance being bliss comes to mind as he reads, and then rereads the stupid thing. Hagrid’s vanishing act starts to make a lot more sense as phrases like ‘
Harry, externally: you're an idiot
Draco can glare all he wants to, he can’t hide the amusement clearly written in his eyes or the soft smile that really takes away from the whole ‘annoyed’ persona. “Are you ready or not?”
Okay, that’s fair. But still: “It’s time for Misty and I to make dinner!”
For a second Draco is a hundred percent sure his father is going to find a way to curse the twin with wandless magic, and then to his surprise Lucius softens. “You’re just children….”
“By that of course I mean, Harry Potter and flying cars. I do believe his stunt will be all over muggle news in the morning, do you think they’ll claim it to be a UFO?”
“There’s time right now. Come down to the party with me, we can eat jellybeans and hang out with Ginny and the twins, Ron’ll be talking to Seamus about the game for at least an hour, that’s more than enough time for a break.”

huge.
you talking about?”
“Yes, yes I suppose I do.” Blaise sighs, and then he flicks his wand a bit and one of the books on the shelves comes flying out.
Snape: Maybe this year will be calm
There’s never dust on his green window seal, and the snitch that flies around on it is always polished, but the succulent that Nevile sent the first week after Harry sent an owl always looks a little unkept with all it’s uneven little petals. His desk is always neat, always polished and papers in order, but the cups of pencils are all different sizes, and Kreecher must not know where to put scissors, so they’ve somehow ended up in the little cup too. The little frame of Harry and his friends that Pansy had cut out of the
“Hey!” He says once he’s in front of them. “You got a second?”
“So, are we not going to talk about it?”
Safety. Security. A
Draco rolls his eyes. “A party is something we had last Yule, it’s getting drunk and having fun, there are very little rules involved. A gala is supposed to be a charity event. We haven’t had one in years, but typically there is a bit of drinking. Less beer and more fancy wine. There’s a dinner, but given the season I’m assuming Pansy is going to go for a summer spread, and for entertainment I suppose classical music, we are still posh, you know.”
Draco had somehow managed to pull mostly Outstandings out of his ass, Transfiguration being his only Exceeds Expectations. While he was disappointed, Pansy had been jealous. Even though her and Blaise had worked their asses off, they somehow wound up with three EEs and only two Os. Crabbe and Goyle were just happy to pass with Acceptables and no Trolls this year.
Seeing his mother come home, spending the day with her. Getting LuLu, falling asleep with something warm in his arms. Last year, when Harry had been saved, when Dobby had told him he was safe and freed. Snape smiling at some dumb joke he made, Dumbledore offering him a lemon-drop, Fawkes fast asleep on his shoulder. Pansy coming out of her dorm, groaning and not laughing nearly as much as Draco had when they accidentally matched their outfits. Blaise and him cuddled up watching books come to life. Crabbe and Goyle rushing to him to tell him they passed two of their finals with Exceeds Expectations. Draco alone at the top of the Astronomy tower, watching shooting stars. The small moments he treasured, all fading and falling away into images that left him chilled to the bone.
None of them know what to do, but the common room does. A door appears right between the two main fireplaces. Draco takes one look at it, shrugs, and then leads his friends into a surprisingly well kept room, green couches and three cups of tea waiting. He gently sinks into one of the couches, leaning all the way back so he can finally rest his head, and waving a blanket on top of him and the Kneazle curled up on his left collarbone.
Sirius frowns at him. “Are you okay?”
It’s honestly amusing to watch Potter fail so many times, landing at least three times on his ass before throwing up frustrated hands. Draco can’t hold back his laughter, and he does regret informing Harry that he can produce a Patronus, thank you very much.
“I’m sorry, that was too far. I didn’t mean to-”
“Good. Make more of them, we’ll send a Christmas basket.”
Draco’s been there. Harry’s nightmares are
“I haven’t named her yet, and yes, ‘her’ is appropriate. Despite her appearance, she’s not a housecat.  Rather, a fetching Kneazle. I know your father is training you to protect yourself from such things, but with the Dementors and Black on the loose, I couldn’t risk you going back to Hogwarts with only an owl, this girl here will protect you, guide you when you are lost, save you from those with ill intent, and give you company when I cannot.”
Geia sighs.
Blaise got Longbottom when he wasn’t looking, “Didn’t wanna be too mean with Mcgonagall standing right there, just a quick pantsing spell, he was wearing heart boxers.”
Hedwig flies into the room, landing on the spot next to him and hooting.
Draco’s stomach drops. LuLu is a filthy traitor. An absolute menace. A little white-
Harry, sobbing, finally feeling complete and utter joy for the first time on his birthday: huh?
Merlin, give him strength. Draco counts to ten, pointedly ignoring the piles of animal skulls, that are very much real, so he doesn’t start screaming. “Fine, then. The last time you saw
Sirius hands him a chalk stick.
“Oh, Professor, he
just to make his god father proud.
Misty has the foresight to grab some magical mold and mildew cleaner, and then drags Draco over the paint aisle where he stops her because he might have been coerced into doing the floors of the house today, but he can’t even get to all the rooms because of the damn stairs, and that somehow ends with him paying for a new staircase as well.
It doesn’t make sense to buy plants, they can barely step in the front door without the little cottage falling apart, but Draco buys a wiggentree and a lavender bush anyways.
Draco’s blood runs cold. He swallows. “Yes, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to resist that.”
If Theo’s walking fine, and has Blasie with him, then Draco doesn’t have to keep an eye on him. They’re not under attack, so there’s nothing to prepare for yet, there’s no training course today, not even an event. No school work to do, no potions to brew, no rush in the day. It’s the first time all summer that Draco feels relaxed to his very bones.
Draco nods, and to his surprise they each pat him on the back. “Do you want us to go with you?”
Deek nods, and vanishes without a single word.
came up with the bloody plan!”
Harry’s friends were honestly adjusting well to Malfoy being on their side. To tell the truth, Hermione hadn’t given it much thought because she was so in over her head with classes no one understood how she was taking. Ron had been sure it was a dream at first, and then Scabbers went missing and between that and someone casually letting him borrow their Nimbus 2001, a broom much better than anyone had seen on the Gryffindor team, he was a little preoccupied. Harry himself hadn’t really thought about how much Draco was impacting him until the stupid broom showed up with a note in weirdly familiar handwriting;
“Now they can’t break it when I’m not expecting it, right?”
He’s not sure why he does it, but in one single flick of his fingers a cracking sound vibrates in the forest around them.
Draco looks out the window as he speaks, drowning out the story they’ve all heard before and spotting a group of rather suspicious people moving back towards Hogwarts; Mcgonagall, Minister Fudge, Hagrid, and Madam Rosmerta. A few seconds later Granger, Weasley, and Potter followed.
Lupin holds open the Defense Against the Dark Arts door, “Well, I’m not much company, but you’re welcome to eat with me. I keep a few bits of fruit in the classroom in case my students get light headed, you’re welcome to it.”
He doesn’t really think before he does it. Just pulls out a wand, casts a voice-enhancing spell the Gryffindors use during Quidditch matches to scream louder, and says
to fix that problem. Patrolling every night since Sirius Black had somehow managed to get in the school
the twins and ron: well, we can't just let him do it alone
your father? I’m surprised he hasn’t greeted me yet.”
Lucius: let's talk about this
that he was bleeding less than two hours ago. The cut was bad, probably from one of those pointy things he thought he dogged, Pomfrey let him go so he thought it wasn’t a big deal. But here, on his arm, instead of a scar, or even a jagged line that he was half expecting, are some weird blue symbols nearly translucent on his skin.
Calm down, he needs to calm down, what would Snape do? Snape would be calm, Snape wouldn’t lose his composure over someone who wasn’t even his friend. Snape would look at the paper in Granger’s hand. Draco eases it out, careful not to let it rip, and then reads it over, filled with information about Basilisks, small bits of information clicking together in fragments of seconds. Potter was a parselmouth,  he probably heard the snake where it went, which is why he’d been at so many of the discoveries. It explained how the first Slytherin had controlled the beast. Why the victims hadn’t been killed, none of them looked directly in the eyes. Granger had even written down how it got around, through pipes.
Draco looked into the endless black and felt fear, the crippling loneliness that followed him everywhere clogged up his throat, somehow the wound on his arm seemed to throb, and then it was happening. The creature leaned forward and he could feel it all slipping.
Hermione: You're the only idiot, mate
He knows Narcissa told him not to kiss her husband, but he deserves a kiss for that. A full, snog-you-breathless kiss. Sirius only hopes a bottle of wine and one of Remus’s chocolate cakes will do.
“Maybe he’s still wearing the face, we could still get in a few good laughs before class starts.”
“Happy Valentine’s Day! And may I thank the forty-six people so far who have sent me cards!”
Dobby recites them like they’ve been branded onto his body. “Number one, Harry Potter mustn’t be allowed to return to Hogwarts this year, because there is danger, but Dobby shouldn’t be showing himself to Mister Potter, and should only be discouraging from afar. Number two, nobody is to be knowing what house Dobby belongs to, especially not that Master Draco sent Dobby to Mister Potter. Number three, Dobby is not to be talking about this to anyone other than Master Draco, because it is dangerous.”
Draco grimances. “It’s supposed to be carrot and apple soup.”
So maybe he could only bite back the
“Draco!”
And then Weasley strikes. “Your bloody arm isn’t even injured is it? I bet you're just milking it to get Hagrid in trouble.”
He is woken up by Flint, “Good morning, Draco, care to join the rest of your team on the practice field this morning?”
Hermione’s hair is half done, and Pansy is trying to fix it, but she keeps glaring at him in between spells. Draco’s so mad fire is building around him, Blaise and Theo are scarily composed. The only ones truly unbothered are his godfathers. Even Lucius seems a little miffed.
without making the front page.”
“Make yourself scarce,” Vernon glares as Harry hands him his briefcase, “my wife deserves better than a stain in her house.”
Kingsley sighs for a third time, must be a new record. “Sunday, Draco. I mean it. Tell Misty it was lovely to meet her.”
secret to Hogwarts and exploit it like it was his right. And, because he really forgets to think things through, he had found himself almost dying in a secret room all over again, at least this time it was because of a giant snake and not a trusted professor. A giant snake, and a bloody diary of all things. Kept under lock and key- not a normal key of course, more like a password that was rather simple for a parselmouth like himself- and distributed by Lucius Malfoy no less. The same Malfoy that kicked and hit Dobby right in front of him and once again, because he rarely thinks his ideas over- he should probably work on that- he’d snuck the elf a sock and freed him, almost gotten cursed, and managed to anger the man who wanted to kill him most, well most after Voldemort himself.
“Yes, and now I’m going to use it and save Sirius.”
“Well? What ‘re you waiting on?”
to see it.
“I’m merely growing up a little early, I assure you I’m fine and well, just maturing is all. Perhaps I’m meant to be a violent moody public figure for the rest of life. Scaring people into submission is just a perk, isn’t it?”
And from that point on Draco completely ignores the rest of the world for the day. Gabbi leaves tomorrow, so they spend the entire time playing games and talking late into the night. Gabbi tells them about Cousin Apolline and Cousin Monnie. She tells them that Grandma Aimee is coming to visit the second she gets back and yes, she’s just as furious as the rest of them. Apparently she’s already thanked Harry for saving her life when they went to visit Hagrid yesterday, which is great because Draco’s kinda thrilled at the idea of his family getting along with his boyfriend.
Then, the strangest thing happens. Lockheart, the massive brainless prick, takes his wand to Potter’s arm, and what had once been limp and out of place, hangs like a wet noodle.
theo: what horrible friends
“They’re alive?” Draco asks.
“Um? Yeah, Ra healed me before we came up?”
“No I’m not. I need-do any of you know how to fix clothing?”
every last inch of his items clean before spelling them into cabinets. Next he puts the food away because the
“It was a lovely cottage. And look, I know you’re worried, but he’s been through a lot. All we can do is be here for him now. If he wants to see a Mind Healer, I know you and Narcissa will get the best one possible. If he doesn’t, we’ll work around it. Either way, we can give him something he hasn’t had in a long time.”
a runes section, but Winky apparently knows exactly where it is, which is how Harry ends up seeing one of the most stunning sights of his life.
Sirius is yelling again, but Harry’s a little too struck to do anything but mumble an awkward ‘hello’.
One look to the stands and he knows who it is, pale hair against a dark cloak, eyes cold and illusive. Lucius Malfoy, in the flesh.
“Really? Because despite their protective nature, a Kneazle cannot withstand a Dementor for even fifteen seconds, much less a whole minute. Do you know what that tells me?”
“Draco, creatures like Buckbeak do not make these types of injuries. I am curious as to what happened.”
“I don’t like what you’re implying.” Draco frowns. “Our mothers are very close friends you know.”
he knew.
Draco writes back in turn, tells him about the experience of seeing King Rallam in real life, complains about Moody, tells him about how excited he is for his Transfiguration project, how much he likes lessons with Poppy.
Harry, who's never been on a roller-coaster but has heard about it from Dudley enough to know it would make him shit his pants: for fun?
Merlin, no. Winky would be completely honest, and he doesn’t need that at all.
Draco stiffens in his seat. He hasn’t quite had time to process just how badly he and his friends messed up this round, or the amount of trouble they were in, but one thing was becoming scarily clear to him. Narcissa was right. Her blood coursed through him, he was a part of her for nearly a year, her blood was so intermingled with his and every person with a brain knows how much flesh was shared between a mother and a child. Father provided sperm and magic, but it was the mother’s body that built babies from within….constructed them with their own blood. And since blood contracts needed a willing person to sign with blood borrowed from their mother…
“Pans? You said-”
“Draco, love, you’re hyperventilating, and I’m pretty sure my arm is going to fall off if you don’t let go.”
“Will you get on with it?” Ron groans. He gets a single manicured nail salute before Pansy continues.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before Harry can really ponder over that he’s led into the stadium and his brain stops for a moment.
Draco’s seething so much he can barely focus on the conversation until one of the men, thank fuck
“Follow me, Potter.”
Wait a minute… “Days?!” He croaks again, “What do you mean days?!”
“You were the only one uninjured when you came out of the lake.” Hermione points out suspiciously.
Hermione glares at both of them, opening her mouth probably to insult their intelligence, but then the rest of the Weasley crew come up behind her. It takes all of one second for the twins to pull Ron and Harry into a bone-crushing hug, Ginny right in the middle.
“I love them” he smiles, once again treading the line of happiness, only avoiding it encase his father got any ideas.
“That’s….different.”
As soon as the sadness let him breathe, he lugged himself out of bed to find Snape. Misery loves company, and it’s much less dangerous that way. Pleasant at first, simple ‘happy Christmas’ exchange between two people, a warmer atmosphere by Snape’s fire. They exchanged presents, a few of his godfather’s favorite chocolates and a pocket watch for him. After an hour of prodding and poking at the boy, he had finally caved and told Snape his latest bouts of emotions haunting him even in his dreams. The potions master didn’t take it lightly, telling him of all the ways to curb such sadness and even making him practice a few. At the end of their long talk, having missed Christmas tea, Snape pats his shoulder, almost affectionately. It shoots him back to three years ago, although it feels like a lifetime ago. The memory of his father, giving him the same tight smile, the same pat, on the same shoulder.
Harry: Your words mean nothing to be because my brain refused to process them, have a great day!
pleased that I wanted to make you a partner! Such a helpful goblin, he even gave me this contract for you to read!”
His brain can’t handle it, the noise, the people. It’s Diagon Alley all over again, it’s Olivander’s shop being blown into pieces, it’s Dark Lord propaganda, it’s shoving shop owners to their feet, it’s killing blokes when no one is looking, it’s all happening right in front of him and he’s stuck all over again, not being able to do a

Draco’s mood plummets.

“Your goal, Albus has been to protect him.” Molly reminds him, “If Riddle already has a hold on him then Severus is right, there is no need to force him into that position!”
Crabbe and Goyle peer over his shoulder, relief flooding through them.

“Why not?”

Draco Malfoy has run here, wherever here may be, to die.
Ron frowns at that, setting aside the chess board as Winky brings them tea before wandering off in the direction of the Gala Planning Room. “Why do you do that?”
“Theo, I’m not-”
He has no clue why Cedric is frantically waving at him to stop talking, all he’s doing is trying to calm Fleur down, but Krum is starting to look highly amused also….
“It’ll be fun!” He announced in class one day, smiling from ear to ear, “A Valentine’s treat! From you-” he pointed to Granger, who raises an eyebrow, “to you!” Potter, the other selected merely snorts.
Dumbledore nods.
They make for an odd sight, and Draco understands this. He
Draco doesn’t care for most of them, doesn’t care for the telly at all, really, but he dutifully watches it with her every Thursday night, each of them working on their respective sides of their tapestry.

Dobby nods, “Dobby is loyal to Master Draco. Whatever Dobby is asked by master, Dobby will do.”
Which leaves him sitting in Mrs. Daisy’s bakery, head bent of a pile of papers, on his third cup of coffee, with Theo breathing down his neck.
to leave his side, and Blaise is glaring back with a large t-shirt in his hands. Draco appears to be shirtless.
In all reality, maybe he has. He’d begged Dumbledore not to make a big deal out of it, promising to be good and not try out any of the ‘experiments’ he and Snape had talked about. Anything to avoid spending time with his father without his mother there to protect him. Call him a coward, but Draco would much rather
“You’re taking that thing with you, I hope?” She snorts, but Harry’s more surprised that she’s actually talking about him with someone else. “It won’t do to have a freak in my home, Vernon would faint if he saw what the garbage brought with it this time. Nevermind that Lily could never make the right choices, what with settling us with that-that
He’s born, which has potential, but then his parents were both violently murdered, so that’s not all great. And he had a chance to live with his godfather and the werewolf boyfriend, literally the plot of some romance novel, he’s sure, but that somehow ended up with Sirius in Azkaban, Remus depressed, and Harry in the care of some of the most abusive people he’s ever met in his life. He’s lied to for
The yell is so loud it startles Harry back to the land of the living, and then right out of his seat when he sees the small grey figure.
Draco raises an eyebrow that she smooths down. Narcissa steps away from him.
From the margins, the underlined bits, and the general warnings, Draco starts to understand why a wand is needed. Firstly, the spell has to be done under the light of the full moon while the ocean is at high tide, there’s a bit of blood that has to be dropped into the sea, there must be three firelights hanging around the elf being bound, and the spell only lasts for ten years.
“You’ve said that at least ten times, Draco. Sit down, Fawkes is getting worried.”
“Pathetic. You’re becoming more and more like a disgrace everyday. The Dark Lord will be among us shortly, you better hope he comes soon, or you and I will have some training to do.”
“She...she says she’s sorry.” Harry translates.
Pansy and Blaise grabbed his hands, Crabbe and Goyle met his eyes.
“Yes, sir. He did.”
“I knew him.” Lupin corrects, “He was a few years ahead of us all though. A Perfect when we were first years, and quite terrifying if I remember correctly.”
Misty looks ten times better, eyes wide and happy, and then, to Draco’s shock, the fireballs disappear and Misty’s face falls, shadowed with her back to the moon.
“Defense.” She replies, coming seamlessly back into his arms. “We’re going to get Os on the Ancient Runes, it’s Potions I’m worried about.”
I have several ocs in it, like the gossipy shopkeepers (I would die for Mrs. Daisy) and a house elf (Misty, my love) who whoops draco into shape. Kingsely also has a big role in it, as do various gryffindors and slytherins. I won't spoil too much, but I'm gonna be posting the first two chapters of it on March 5th so I hope you're just as excited!!!
The Gang: gross.
to do it.
Misty follows him over to the table, wide eyes taking in the sights, and then she glances at the soup and frowns.
Oh fuck…..”How long do I have?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco takes a breath, but Misty beats him to it.
Buckbeak bows back and makes to come near him, but a chain keeps him from going far so Draco meets him halfway, hands reaching out to stroke surprisingly soft feathers.
“Good afternoon to you as well, Draco.”
going over the course material! Once my father hears about this-”
Harry would like to believe Draco would also go all scary veela on Aunt Petunia like he did on Crouch Jr, but he’d have to beat the Weasleys to her. His family would, without a single doubt in his mind, curse Petunia until her hair turned grey. Well, all of them except Ron. Ron would just punch Dudley and let Hermione knock out his Aunt. They’d save Vernon for Mrs. Wealsey.
“Yes, they make quite the couple, but they’re not as cute as Harry and I.”
Blaise.
“You know you don’t have to be sneaky about it. Your mother and I don’t care if you eat in your room.”
“In that case take some of those pistachios with you.”
Harry needs a full thirty minutes to digest that, but Blaise only gives him ten seconds.
Draco looks back at him, and the right at Potter, apparently caught in the middle of making a very difficult decision. He can barely hear him over the commotion around them, but by Merlin can he read lips.
Hermione chokes. “No, no I did not know that.”
“That’s never worked well in the past and you know it, that’s exactly how we ended up with Blaise in here.”
Misty’s face darkens instantly. “We do not be talking of that bad man here.”
Who is Black? Is he the one that brought Harry in? Once he finds out what he looks like that guy will dead as-
“Absolutely not. I refuse to let you burn my entire house down.”
“Draco. I seldom extend this offer, but given the circumstances, and our relations outside of school, I find it imperative that should you have any troubles, personal or otherwise, you come immediately to see me. It is rare to find a trustworthy friend among spies, but I believe we each fit the role. Furthermore, an old friend used to tell me that ‘bottling up emotions’ is extremely unhealthy, so be careful not to. Not when you can always come to me.”
“Study?” Pansy glares at the boys, “Work? Design the best dress this school has ever seen? Maybe not die for one year? I’d very much like to have just
He’s shaking worse than he was when Draco kissed him the first time.
Harry nods, because he’s not supposed to speak until spoken to in this house, but it’s Remus and he knows Remus would never let anything hurt him, and he’d like to make sure he isn’t hallucinating because he hasn’t slept in a bit so he whispers his response. “Remus? You’re-you’re real?”

is staring at him. As soon as recognition hits his eyes they’re pulling him in for a hug.
Pansy smirks. “Oh, I have a few ideas.”
He almost drops his wand, bolting as soon as the wood is in place.
But then he had to go through Wednesday morning without being able to ask Hermione about

They make it inside right before the rain comes pouring down.
“This is going to seem silly,” Draco starts, “But I need that in the contract. Bring it to the Astronomy tower after dinner tomorrow, I’ll meet you there after my extra assignment with Lupin. We’ll go over every word, work out any discrepancy, and if it meets everyone’s standards….”
Dumbledore marches on, “And how did you get so familiar with Dementors?”
“Winky! What are you doing here?”
Even if he wanted to he couldn’t stop the horror gripping his every atom.
He doesn’t find out what’s going on until the very beginning of class when the Potion’s Master very calmly and cooley said “Professor Lupin is sick today, I am your teacher. Turn to page 394”
“It is!” Harry holds his outfit out to her. “Look at this! It’s like they’re trying to make me a champion! And look at Cedric! He looks like a walking Hufflepuff sign! No offense, Cedric, but

That’s impossible, Harry.”

“Mister Draco is a wizard and wizards be needing wands!”
Which is a problem seeing as he can’t remember what comment he made in the first place but Harry is staring at him, so he carries on like he does know what he’s doing.
Hermione has the decency to look guilty. “Yes. Well, I mean, they
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Blaise asks, looking up from his book. “I mean Potter hasn’t stopped looking at you the entire ride.”
No one is safe!”
“You brought it up!”
“You is coming here because the ocean told you to.” The elf, Misty, tells him. “It called Mistress too, when she was upset, but the bad people came and took her away. Are they going to take you away too, Mister?”
Draco: what trauma?
Naturally he does, “What do you mean?”
Currently, he has two tables pushed together and filled to the brim with books and papers. Fleur left when the books started piling above his head, or maybe that’s just because it’s nearing curfew and she’s just as freaked out about the first task as he is. Madam Pince comes over to kick him out, so he checks out
“Or the other times!”
And, it has occurred to him more than once, but he should
, he’s grateful when Snape snaps out that he has an antidote. People are laughing through their swelling, most of the class can’t even talk through their enlargements, and he supposes it would be funny if he wasn’t one of the affected.
“Think of how blissful it will be for you and Hermione when you accept that Death and I are frequent acquaintances.”
“This is it?”
one more time and I’ll burn your beard off!”
They both nod as he walks away and hides behind a corner until they’re gone. Then he goes back towards the way they came, right to Dumbledore’s office. The old man is waiting for him, like he knew it would happen, a baby Fawkes peers at him as soon as he enters and derails his thoughts.
you dipshit!”
Geia lowers her head fully onto the pillow, if her eyes were open Harry would be staring straight into them.
It’s weird getting gifts from adults, but his friends make it a bit easier.
Narcissa steps between them, holding her hand out for Harry to shake. “Closet? In the nicest way, love, you don’t have much of a closet to go off of. When Sirius owled me last night Lucius had to stop me from sending you clothes then and there. On the plus side, this is a perfect opportunity to test the waters, hm?”
His friends openly gawk now, uncomfortably so, almost enough to make him wish he hadn’t told them. “It’s fine,” he reassures, “I’ll still be getting presents, and they both write frequently, I’ll have the pitch to myself, and time to get ahead of my classes. I thought it was a great idea, really.”
Draco snaps his head back to the conversation to find the teacher he thought hated him most giving him a serious yet kind smile. “Do be careful, we cannot afford to lose two students in one night.”
Apparently laughing is
No one would want to see the Dark Lord, and Draco was sure a few heads would roll if he stepped up and a dead Harry Potter looked back at him.

Draco Malfoy greets the boy with a smile and an outstretched hand. He looks bigger, stronger, somehow happier and Harry is smart enough to know it’s because of the man a few isles next to him looking like he’s about to fall over.
Sirius, holding Harry's broom he forgot in the hallway: Sure.
“So,” Ron asks, popping a licorice in his mouth, “Have you heard from Sirius yet?”
“You’re overreacting.”
“Yes? Did you find out anything?” Katheriene asks as Pansy helps him off the floor.
“Draco I don’t think that’s a good idea-”

He hadn’t seen them there, all he could focus on was the wood in front of his seat. He didn’t even hear his long list of acquisitions, just Potter protesting his return to Azkaban and Kingsley leading him away to the Manor.
“A new wand?”
I'm already working on the first chapter for the next part! If I don't get it up today it will be up tomorrow!
He’s around three seconds away from punching Potter in his smart mouth but the brat turns around and walks away, leaving him fuming and glaring at empty walls.
The way she calmly continues making her smores is starting to scare him, but LuLu is eyeing a cup of milk on the table so he guesses it can’t be that bad.
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t-I thought she wasn’t going to-”
“A potion’s lab?” Draco whispers.
Draco would bother with a glare, but he’s a little busy sprinting up steps.
needs sleep. He shakes Harry just a bit more.
“And why were you worried about my son?”
“Because he’s male audiam!”
Which means the living room is swamped in red and Sirius has to hold Molly back because if he doesn’t get to hurt the Dursleys then she doesn't either.
Everyone holds their breath to watch their little exchange, so Draco decides to make his intentions
Parkinson and Zabini and here as his moral support just like you and Harry are here for me. Suck it up or leave!”
He spends the rest of Tuesday doing homework with Fleur popping in and out every now and then. Pansy’s somehow found time to start on her end of the year art portfolio, which means he’s had to listen to her worry about getting paint on her dress robe projects for one day and he’s already fed up with it. He kinda regrets getting her new paint supplies for her birthday.

“I bet he has some hidden under that sweater-”

“Disappoint me? You could never.”
If her questions don’t kill him maybe she will.  “Stop trying to distract me, you’re in trouble.”
Then again, Draco needs a little happiness. Desperately needs it. Long nights are cold when there’s no company but thoughts and fears. Pain had proved useful to ground him just like he thought it would; he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t put his own ebony knife to good use on his thighs. On the plus side, his knife wasn’t cursed, so the cuts he gave himself only lasted for a few days, unlike the one on his arm that was just beginning to heal from where it had been reopened over break.
“Draco? What are you doing out here?”
WARNING! For mild abuse and anxiety!
Griphook flashes him that nasty smile again, full of sharp teeth coated in yellow.
“No!” Draco gasps out, “I didn’t-mother bought her-I swear I did-”
“Keeping secrets already?”
Blaise does close the door, and then takes a seat beside Pansy on the chairs across from his couch. No one touches the tea.
“But wait, maybe what Ra said will calm him down? He’s a big deal, right? Maybe he can make Dumbledore, I dunno, calm down a bit?”
them…”
Dobby grins at Harry, who manages a pathetic excuse for a wave, and then peers at the girl with her jaw on the floor.
She scurries away before he can return the favor, dashing down the hall and mummering spells to locate her missing students. The mere thought of Potter taking on a basilisk is enough to send anxiety through his veins, hands shaking as they climb the tower to Dumbledore’s untouched office.
“There are some families who stayed neutral.”
And although he knows Hagrid can’t hear him, no one could miss the nuzzle Buckbeak gives him in response.
Harry squeezes her tight, already planning on making her be the one to explain what the hell she just did and what it means to Draco. “Can’t be participating in a Death Tournament.”
“His mother?” Snape asks.
Because Bill and his weird feelings for Draco aren’t enough, Mr. Wealsey managed to force him to come face to face with one of the hottest Quidditch players he’d ever seen. A Hufflepuff six year Seeker that Harry really never paid attention to when they were off the field but now….when the fuck was he going to stop running into attractive men? Shouldn’t he be finding women attractive?
“Are you going to show me how it works, or just explain the theory?” Poppy asks with a little smile, and because he has the time before their morning Saturday rush, Draco grabs Frankie from his closet and the little pocket watch that used to be normal.
“We”- his son takes a few steadying breaths- “We need to get out of here.
“NaHui?”
“Have you had them before? The nightmares, I mean.”
“Excuse me!” Granger calls out. Oh yeah. They don’t know. “What the hell is going on?! I

them, Harry summons four more blankets. His chest aches at the sight of tear marks on their faces, at the way Fred and George have their pinkies linked, how the four of them seem to be touching in some way or another. Be it a Ron’s foot on Fred’s stomach, Ginny’s ankle on George’s thigh, or Ginny’s head on Ron’s shoulder.

“Blaise would’ve done it, but he was torn up, Draco. Shaking like a leaf, I’ve never seen him so fucked up. Ron and I had to help him walk, and if Harry hadn’t been there I don’t know what Luna would’ve done. I didn’t think she could cry until that day.”
going to be happy.
“I don’t have long and I cannot explain fully, but you all must be careful. Blaise, your mother is working with me to protect the pureblood children. We’ve gone over several ideas. We’re trying to warn others we know want no part of the war, those who want to fight for the side of the light. It is not as black and white as history would have you believe. For now, when you go to school this year, distance yourself from those who speak highly of the Dark Lord. You must be safe, you cannot be accused, and you must be smart about every move you make.”
Draco: i mean....if that's what you call 'fun'
Dobby’s ears perk up, “Anything for Master Draco!”
Pansy rolls her eyes, “We’re still studying with you. I’ll have you know one of my two Os
“She’s been worried sick.” Pansy glares.
“No doubt about that.”
If you weren’t there he would’ve died, don’t you
And that he fucking is. Potions comes around, his favorite class of the day where he can get some frustration out and be led into doing silly things by Crabbe and Goyle like tossing bits of things right at Scar Face’s head. They’re brewing Swelling Solution, he’s half-tempted to snag a sample to use for next Halloween. Can’t really see his friend’s heads getting bigger than they already were, though. Pansy would kill him if he messed with her nose, rather disappointing because it would be awfully funny.
“Um, thank you, it’s, uh, nice to meet you too.”
For now, he has to find the other champions.
“You’re just jealous!”
The only issue is, Draco doesn’t want to. Leaning on people is being weak, is it not? That’s why he’s kept his secrets, hides his vulnerable parts from everyone. He doesn’t break down and cry in front of others, that’s saved for when he’s safe behind the curtains of his bed, curled around LuLu. He doesn’t talk about things, he waits until he breaks down and goes to Snape because he has no one else to tell. He lies, and he cheats, and he fakes his way through life until he’s at the top.
Her left hand cards through his hair, the right pulling him close into the familiar and calming lavender smell that’s been soothing him for as long as he can remember. Draco pulls back just an inch so she can cup his face. He reaches up to brush away the tears.
“Can you take me to your things?”
Apparently it’s not what Pansy was expecting. She takes a step back into a frozen Blaise, who looks at him like he’s lost every last shred of sanity, but Draco is tired and not in the right state of mind to refuse them, and since he’s already spilled his guts to one friend tonight, why not clue in his two best friends while he’s at it.
Draco swore when he closed his bedroom door, trading shoes for slippers. If he was going to worry about Potter now, he might as well be comfortable.
The worst part about being in the competition is not being able to watch the competition. He wants to know what the others are doing, but he can’t because watching them is apparently cheating, and apparently you can’t do that in plain sight, no matter what Krum says.
“I feel like that clashes with your vomit preferences just a bit.”
Which gives him an insane idea.
thank you. Draco, dear, I can’t-I don’t have the
Harry weaves his way past toys, clothing, and other shit he’s afraid to touch, right to his little corner of the world.
“Listen, don’t  be mad, okay? But I know how we’re going to save Sirius.”

He’s in for a long night all over again.

He know it’s an stupid thought but, bloody hell, does he really sound
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco huffs, clearly in control of the dred creeping up his throat, “I’m perfectly thrilled that my father is here. Let’s give him a good show, right?”
“What?” He scoffs, after a much too telling pause he prays they don’t pick up on, “Where would you get an idea like that?”
“Well Draco, I assume you’d have to publicly choose a side for that to happen. And while it may not be ideal for intel, it may eventually be exactly what we need.”
Sirius enters the room first. Clad only in a pair of loose sweatpants, holding his wand up like he’s still half asleep. “Move and I kill-”
Harry almost laughs at the ‘rules’ popping up. They’re more like advice if he’s honest.
Draco and Blaise, with their noses in books, lounging in the Slytherin common room while Theo sneers at them. Millie, smirking evilly with the twins as a dung bomb goes off in the background. The brebones of their Yule outfits in Pansy’s hidden workshop. Hermione nearly snorting tea out of her nose in the Gang’s Room. Winky clearly tutting at Draco, who’s asleep with his head on his desk. Harry easily laughing with Cedric and Cho. Luna in one of her famous outfits, smiling at Ginny, who’s blushing even in black and white.

He can’t breathe, he’s choking, he can see Dobby limp on the floor….the elf is covered in some red shiny substance….
At precisely three o’clock the Malfoy Manor is finally peaceful again.
“I’ve seen this before, it’s the look of a prisoner from Azkaban. His father must have put him in the Dementor room again….”
Sirius squeezes him once more before nodding, letting Lucis lead the way upstairs.
about whatever
An hour later and Dobby has finally calmed, walking him through every second of his interaction with Potter. He spends hours going over every little detail, making sure there is no evidence to lead back to himself. If his father doesn't kill him once he finds out, Severus most certainly would. Eventually he draws it up to being blamed for everything, which he deserves for being a giant ass to everyone, he supposes.
like that.”
The world takes a second to gather around him. No light comes in through the dungeon walls, which makes it that much harder to focus. He can breathe this time, an improvement. A majority of his roommates are asleep, curtains drawn with a spell or two to keep them out. His are also shut, but knowing that his apparent captain stands behind them is enough for Draco to sit up and throw them open.
“You’re telling me. I’ve got Potions covered, it’s McGonagall’s end of year project that’s going to kill me.”
That being said, he still has a type. One that a skinny, old, no-nose, strangely pale Dark Lord doesn't fit into.
Above ground, the manor can still pass as a family-friendly home. Sure, it’s big and the walls are spotless and the floor echoes footsteps, but there are soft couches, even gentler lights. The dining room may have seemed dark and cold from his perspective, but the table was warm oak, and the rug beneath it white, fuzzy, and pure. He’s eaten dinner so many times with his parents there, his father at the head, and he and his mother on either side. It had been home once.
He turns to face Snape, all irritated and fuming about Potter not being punished still. “Seriously?
“Since he arrived, Miss Parkinson.”

suit. Though Draco only has a few seconds to focus on his pathetic excuse of a father when he notices the family pensive right next to him. It swirls with silvers and blacks, and it’s exactly where his mother leads him.
“Obviously. He does need to learn about his heritage, and I understand he’s supposed to be extremely powerful, but he’s still just a boy. He’s like Draco, all power and limited control.”
Draco tunes them out from there and does protest something fierce when a manicured hand removes his notes. “Hey! I wasn’t done with that!” He roars, turning around to glare.
“Yes, I’m pretty sure we’ve covered that already. Are you going to keep laughing at me or tell me what the hell I’ve been missing?”
Harry has a sudden bright idea. Draco is going to kill him for this, literally murder him right before Hermione can get close enough, but it’s worth it. “I’ll give you my broom. It’s the fastest in the whole school, and I’ve seen you fly. You should be able to get around your dragon if you fireproof it. I was told something about antidotes and dragon-proof clothes?”
It reminds Draco of the ocean.
I understand that there are a lot of similarities, but personally, there are a lot of similarities with most drarry fics. These include Harry and dragons, Draco and Hermione being study budies, Krum and Hermione dating, Pansy being That Bitch, saving the basilisk, the list goes on. I view ShanaStoryTeller's fic as a soulmate au, and that is not what my fic is. My fic is the result of me watching the HP movies, thinking 'draco definitely sent dobby', and also a paper on world mythology and lore that I wrote last semester.
Godric, what the hell has gotten into him?
“I don’t know.” Millie pauses, “It makes more sense but I honestly have no clue. Anyways, she’s going with him, and started complaining about Pansy not making her dress, so I told her I wasn’t getting one either because I didn’t plan on going, and then she got upset and after listening to her whine I told her I was only going if I got asked, because as much as I want to see Theo sneak in alcohol, I don’t want to babysit all of you all night long because you can’t handle your liquor-”
The ‘D’ had been the most amusing part, if Draco was suddenly going to start leaving him little notes, they should probably come up with another, less obvious sign off. But in order to do that, they would actually have to

Of the boy who’s ass he constantly had to look after? Of the idiot with a scar he could never hide? He knows he should stop, Snape is going to have a row with him over this later, but he’s started and can’t stop now.
It hardly takes any time to reach the greenhouses once he drowns out the blithering idiots beside him. It does, however, take an immense amount of effort not to scoff in Lockheart’s face as he flaunts about in front of Scar Face.

“You don’t know? Or you won’t tell me?”

Dumbledore gives him a coy smile, “Do what you think is best for the boy, but remember what he has just gone through. Be kind if you can. Remember that the Truth is sometimes exactly what is called for.”
“I’m okay. They happen every now and then, it’s a little freaky, actually.”
“I don’t know!

It’s then that Nagini decides to rise from her spot over by the couch, head lifting up as she blinks at Harry.
“Anniversary?” Harry asks.
“You never come and visit….are you making it up now?” If ghosts could blush she’d be the color of Ron’s hair by now. “Going to put on a show for me, Harry?”
Harry: *breathes*
He’s not sure how he manages it, but he ends up talking Misty out of going into town. She still makes him get up before noon and start on the wards.
His friends make faces at him from his left and right, they had teased him the entire trip down and would no doubt be teasing him the entire trip back. Draco does not squeal when the game starts, but he does get joy from seeing Potter so lost in Cedric’s wake. He is supposed to be watching the yellow Seeker, but his eyes stray back to a certain scar face eyes time. Probably, no, most definitely, because Potter will end up getting hurt. It’s raining, it’s starting to get weirdly cold, lightning blinds them every five seconds, and that is plenty for the idiot to find some cursed way to injure himself. That’s the only reason Draco can’t stop watching him, he’s sure.
Luna: I am here to cause problems
Draco’s eyes narrow the second he spots Harry, it’s scary enough that Ron and Hermione actually back away, but Narcissa just rolls her eyes so how bad can it be. Well, she rolls her eyes until she sees the reason her son is stalking towards him, then her eyes narrow and Harry experiences a fear like no other.
“I have a different plan.” Harry smiles. “I won’t even need a broom. I can’t say a lot, but it’s going to be showy and a big ‘fuck you’ to the whole competition. If you take the broom, you’ll probably get done before the others, and I fully plan on taking as long as possible, so don’t worry about it.”
“I protected you because you’re too stupid to protect yourself, Dumbledore is the headmaster and concerned about all his students. Dobby was a house elf of mine since childhood, and as for sides...I am always on my own side. Whatever is best for me is what I will choose.”

Draco nods.
It’s wonderful, the world when magic was still alive.

“I can’t, Theo. No-no,
It’s loud enough to make them all still, eyes moving from the wand to blazing green eyes.
Or at least, that’s what it bloody looked liked, but then something worse happens and Draco can’t do anything but watch in horror, gripping his friend’s hands until it hurts as Potter falls off his broom and plummets to the ground.
“Don’t be silly,” She says as Draco decides it doesn’t really matter because she made his favorite hot chocolate and it tastes so fucking good. “So you question the marshmallows but not the coco?”
Narcissa, after looking through files for ages, had left at midnight, giving the men time to thoroughly clean one bedroom and fall into freshly made sheets. They’d have to put in a lot of work to make this place feel like a home, but it’s starting to look a little better. Krecher already has coffee waiting for him by the mantle, so he figures maybe hope isn’t lost. Finding a way to renovate a home when you’re a wanted criminal sounds like the type of challenge he’s been missing, plus it would make for a fun story when he

“Which he won’t” George grins.
And all they could find was ash.

Dementors, awful creatures. They’d been roaming lately, and came straight to Lucius’s mansion, where the man had locked them in a room and thrown Draco in just because he passed out under the Cruciatus Curse. That had been a harrowing evening, he’d been forced out some hours later, shaking and looking broken enough that Lucius had actually hugged him and sent the house elves to draw him a bath. He’d even been allowed to eat what he wanted to that night.
“Inhale, Harry. Just like this.”

“Then we do!” Draco snaps, a little too violently for the situation. Awkwardness hangs between them for a moment, and then Harry pats at the space beside LuLu. Draco sits down in it, wrapping himself up in the blanket and getting a little embarrassed about his outburst until Harry lightly touches his arm.
