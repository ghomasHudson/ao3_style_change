"Draco's just fixated because he spends so much time on his own hair every morning." Harry jumped at the feeling of ice crawling up his spine as Myrtle made her presence known.
He peeked beneath the hoods — which was actually quite easy considering the height differential what with him sprawled on the ground and them standing upright — and noticed a menagerie of animal faces staring back at him; each face looking a bit off from what the average person would normally picture.
"It was a definite shock adjusting to this reality," Lily admitted, most likely in an attempt to reassure Harry. Harry appreciated the gesture and smiled in return.
"I'm sorry, did you just say that legally both Wednesday, specifically, and the concept of time,generally, do not exist according to the government?" Harry was sure that this particular version of Voldemort was quite possibly a child, denying the existence of things that he either feared or did not like.
But you already knew that, so shame on you. I hope you'll take the opportunity — during your 14 day mandatory imprisonment in the underground cells of the dog park — to reflect on your actions.
"How'd you know that about Draco anyways?" Harry asked, as he angled himself so that he was half hidden behind Ginny (who was not amused at being used as a shield and threw him a dirty look and made sure to grind the heel of her foot on his exposed toes).
"I honestly have no idea why I was in the department of mysteries to begin with — maybe I was just bored? But I could have sworn that stupid curtain was taunting me so I walked right up to it, intending to give it a stern talking to and then I was hoovered right in." Harry offered when it was his turn.
Remus and Sirius were outside trying to convince their assigned Ministry agents to film the two having sex (which was well outside their usual duties) but it seemed that the couple had a pretty effective bribe that they were sure would help their case.
"Those masks are horrifying. I think they pulled them fresh from the animals," Sirius whispered, shuddering in horror. Harry thought back to his own inspections and had a feeling that Sirius might actually be right — yuck.
Harry quickly made sure Draco was okay with the direction things were going before leaning in and sinking his teeth into the soft flesh in his hands. He pulled back and lapped at the bruised skin in apology before working his way inward. Spreading those pale cheeks aside, Harry exposed his target, enjoying Draco's whimpers before leaning in and gently nibbling along the raised ridges before moving in, working Draco open with fingers and tongue until he was a moaning, writhing mess begging Harry to let him come. Harry thought about fucking Draco and the thought was so tempting, but he had had a plan before he left the house and he was going to see it through. With a mournful sigh, he teased the reddened hole one last time before turning Draco around to face him, and smiling reassuringly when he saw the confused look on the blonde's face.
"I'm glad you find such comfort in my broadcasts," Draco said, sipping his own wine and buying time as he thought over the question. "It's interesting that you ask that, considering —"
Now you may be asking yourselves, "how are you sure about that, Draco? Maybe I had a spectacular week that blew yours out of the water? You don't know me". And that's where I'll have to remind you that you may not know me but I do know you. Of course I only know you the way that you exist in the eyes of your Ministry assigned Aurors and how their individual brains choose to interpret what they see and hear from your homes as you go about your lives before condensing it all down into a weekly report that they submit to the Ministry. Those reports don't tell me how you feel (unless you're the type to actually talk about that kind of stuff, and if that's you, then congratulations. That's wonderful). The reports don't contain the version of you as you perceive yourself.
For once, all my interns have made it to the end of the week unharmed and I think that's cause enough for celebration — oh, wait. Intern Sophia is trying to tell me something.
"I never did get a chance to have a kid back home, so I'll welcome this opportunity," Lily said, voice soft and gentle and everything Harry had imagined back when he was a child dreaming of such things.
Our illustrious reptilian overlord, Lord Voldemort, leads our Vague Yet Menacing Government in controlling — I mean leading — the citizens of Wizarding Britain. The Ministry of Magic is not a part of the Vague Yet Menacing Government — as they are far from vague and are only vaguely menacing.
I have been informed, by the piece of parchment that had been slipped under the studio's door by station management that it is now time for our once daily reminder that the dog park is off limits. Do not enter the dog park. Do not look at the dog park. Do not make eye contact with the Unspeakables living in the dog park. Do not try to run if one of these hooded figures chase after you, they are quicker than you will ever be and the chase will only excite them — you do not want to excite them.
The wispy cloth — for that was all it was, regardless of the fact that it was fortunate enough to be given the duty to decorate the entrance to a mysterious portal — had seemed to be taunting Harry.
He looked up and took in the fairy lights (which somehow managed to sneak past the acknowledgment ban), the soft music playing in the background, and the way everyone was dressed. It was this last bit that had Harry falter, suddenly feeling self-conscious and severely underdressed. But then Draco was at his side, smiling softly and guiding Harry to their reserved table and before he knew it, they were sat across each other in a private corner, legs close but not quite touching yet. Harry took note of that before focusing on the vision of Draco — hair soft and silky and falling naturally into his eyes softening the sharp angles of his face and just generally giving off a very different vibe than the counterpart that Harry had been more familiar with. But this was good — it was different and that made everything easier, because Harry could treat this Draco as his own person and it wouldn't be quite so hard.
"And the Vague Yet Menacing Government?" Harry could practically feel the capitalization in the words.
"I get your ass next time," he muttered, only faintly registering the chuckle from Draco before they both fell asleep.
Now, it seems that this [BEEP!] appeared in Godric's Hollow where he met up with [BEEP!], [BEEP!], [BEEP!], and [BEEP!]. If you'll recall, the existence of those four individuals was reported by Old Lady Bagshot some months back, before our illustrious reptilian overlord took the time out of his very busy schedule to personally deny their existence and remind us that anyone who acknowledged their existence would be sent for re-education in the dog park. Well, it seems this new individual is now staying at the home of the four people that most definitely do not exist.
"Wow, Harrikins," One of the twins said. Harry thought it might be Fred because Fred tended to hand out annoying pet names like candy on Halloween. "I never noticed, but I guess it's true." He finished, which was something different about the Weasley twins of this dimension — they tended to finish their own sentences, instead of going for the back and forth his own twins reveled in.
Faintly, he heard Draco interrupting the mind-numbing story he had been reading to patch in their latest caller.
"You look great," Harry complimented, meaning it. He enjoyed the flush that climbed up Draco's cheeks, noticing that it started from below the mandarin collar Draco had chosen for the evening and that only made Harry wonder if he would be able to see more later on.
"You can move now," Harry prompted. "Fuck me nice and hard." He continued, wanting to be sure that Draco wouldn't hold back on account of this being their first time together. Harry needn't have worried though, as Draco flipped them over to get better leverage before pounding into him with deep thrusts that Harry just knew he would still be feeling the next day. And then Draco, the absolute dick, would break the pace to tease him with agonizingly slow thrusts, dragging his cock out of Harry inch by inch, making sure the brunette could feel every stretch and slide until Harry dug his heels in and clawed his fingers into Draco's shoulder in retaliation because he had been so close goddamn it. Draco took pity on him — or maybe he was just as close — and bent Harry in half, changing the angle just so and now Harry was babbling and incoherent and Draco was tugging his throbbing cock erratically until they both finally crested.
"Lucius put up a big stink. Staged a strike. Had a public meltdown outside the Ministry Building and threatened to quit and leave all the paperwork to Voldemort himself if he went through with it."
I concur. Let's all try and help these Merfolk make a good impression — remember, Nessie is confined to large bodies of water and therefore her opinion of the local Merfolk also extends to the surrounding land-going citizens as well. I, for one, would never let it be said that Draco Malfoy is a bad host and I trust the same goes with all who are listening — which is everyone, as this is a government mandated radio broadcast.
"What's your name, kiddo?" James asked, as he led Harry further into the house into a room filled with familiar people.
"Must have skipped me," Harry said with a pout, not having known that particular characteristic before and now feeling annoyed that he hadn't inherited that specific trait. "You guys are taking this all rather well, by the way." Harry said, intending it as praise but knowing that some of that was tempered with shock and a liberal sprinkle of suspicion.
Sirius helped him get dressed, even letting Harry borrow his beloved leather jacket, while Remus dabbed some of his own cologne in specific locations on Harry's skin — only mumbling that less was more and that placement was everything. James, Merlin bless him, actually slipped a mortified Harry a packet of condoms and some lube, and Lily made him take a commemorative photo. He knew that everyone in that room fully expected that he would be fucking Draco that night (or the opposite, which was what Harry was secretly hoping for) and wouldn't be returning until the next morning and it was so embarrassing. But it also made him feel so warm inside, in a very fuzzy and familial way, knowing that he got to go through this experience with these people even if they weren't his original family.
So let's see here. It looks like someone had been spotted in the dog park yesterday — Really now? Didn't I take the time to go over the rules regarding that on the broadcast? Tsk tsk — and had managed to escape without any injuries, thankfully. The Unspeakables are understandably very upset about this occurrence and have written to their liaison with the government requesting that the figure be returned so that they can study him in greater detail. It appears that he is yet another traveler from another dimension — which is my cue to once again remind everyone that of course there is no such thing as other dimensions. This reality is the only reality you need; it's the one you were born into and it is the one you will die in. The existence of other realities is a myth. Like the existence of mountains. You've never seen a mountain, now have you? Admit it. No, please, lean into the microphone placed in your homes so that your assigned agent can record you denying the existence of mountains. I shall patiently wait in order to give you enough time.
It is because of my eyes, this physical structure that allows me to process information visually, that I was able to see for myself just how thick and lustrous our new resident's hair really was. And listeners, the pictures and descriptions do not do it justice. There's just so much of it, and it's so tempting, to sink your hands in it and tug and find out if it's as soft as it looks.
Harry was feeling bored one day. He knew it was inevitable. He had been here so long that it was only inevitable that he would acclimate to his new dimension and begin viewing its quirks as just part of the normal backdrop of daily life in Wizarding Britain under a Lord Voldemort that had contented himself with being a very silly Lord of the British Isles.
As he made his way up the path to a familiar house, one of the men from the tent stationed in front of this particular house waved him over. Harry, not knowing what else to do, made his way over to the gesticulating man to see what he wanted — he looked harmless enough anyway.
"Would you mind letting them know that the front curtain is closed? Makes it hard to see into the house," he explained and Harry supposed that it made sense and so agreed to the request before continuing on up to the house and knocking gently on the front door.
"How delightful!" Harry chirped, reaching out a hand to intertwine their fingers atop the table. "So do I. So, can I interest you in making some new memories tonight?" Harry asked, not even trying to be subtle because honestly that just wasn't him and Draco should know that now.
"Oh I keep forgetting that you're new," Myrtle said, with that fake-apologetic tone. Ron rolled his eyes from behind her, knowing full well that she didn't forget — it was why she was practically targeting Harry to begin with.
"Of course. It really is very pleasant to listen to, which is great, because we have to listen to you talking quite a bit," Harry explained. "Anyway, hey listen, this morning I was out walking into town because Lily" — a loud beep blocked out her name on the wireless, but Harry knew that Draco could hear the words unredacted. "Anyway, she sent me into town to buy a bag of apples for some project or other, she's probably making a bunch of pies which is the new thing she's gotten into. Anyway I bought those apples and had every intention of bringing them all home, but then I came across this gorgeous thestral (BEEP!) and just couldn't leave the poor girl outside. So I bribed her with some of the apples and brought her home. She just has the biggest, most sorrowful eyes you'd ever see on an animal, let alone a thestral (BEEP!). So now she's sleeping near me and it's very cute. I wish I could show you."
Harry groaned as Draco collapsed on him, though he enjoyed the weight enough to allow it for a few more minutes before pushing the other off of him. Repositioning themselves, Harry muttered a quick cleaning charm, before curling into Draco's chest.
I'd like to preface all this by letting you know that what I am about to say is all objective and true and was approved by the Ministry of Magic. The views soon to be expressed here do reflect those held by station management as well as our ministry and was painstakingly written out by the members of our Vague Yet Menacing Government and so it would please us greatly Draco if you do not read this portion of the document aloud... Oh! Oooh. Well. They really should have marked this better to let me know which portions were instructions and which were the parts to be read aloud. Really now. This cannot be blamed on me.
The interns and I all drew a lot and I am sad to announce that intern Mira had been chosen as the representative.
So, when station management returned Mira to the studio room, with their instructions pinned to her soulless husk, I had to sift through quite a lot of instructions and memos and let me tell you, I do not enjoy reading before the sun has risen.
Something you may not have known, though, listeners, is that our current minister — whom has only been in office for two weeks so far — has held a record breaking number of press conferences. He is actually listed in the Hall of Records as the sitting minister with the most press conferences in the history of the Ministry of Magic.
"Your monologue on the topic. I remember," Harry cut in smoothly, smiling sweetly at his date, who looked pleased instead of angry at the interruption. "I loved how you so easily broke it down, presenting the different angles to the audience before pulling back and letting us decide how we wanted to answer that question. So, in perfect confidence between two people trying to get to know one another, which view spoke the most to you?" Harry stretched his legs out then, letting them brush against Draco's beneath the table, allowing the contact to stay and enjoying the heat from where their legs met.
All the figures were a bit too tall, a bit too fast, and a bit too interested in Harry. So he made the only sensible decision all day and disapparated before they could close the rapidly diminishing distance between them.
The wolves bared teeth that were longer, sharper and more visible — the eyes milky white with amber slit pupils. The deer faces looked a bit too tight, and when one opened its mouth — exposing the tears along its jawline and displaying darkened rotting sinew —, Harry spotted two rows of short, razor sharp teeth. There was also an assembly of cat faced figures, furs dark and disheveled, eyes a bit too human, mouths a bit too big, skin a bit too loose (as if it was pulled on like a mask instead of being the one they were born with).
Good morning listeners. I hope you've had as productive a morning as I have! Now, I know that we all awoke at the same time — because the daily morning howl has been scheduled for the same time every day for as long as I can remember — but I also know that some of you have been climbing back into bed right after. Don't try to deny it. Your assigned Auror's have already reported as such to the Ministry of Magic in their weekly briefs.
"Such luster! Much soft!" George fawned mockingly, reaching out a trembling hand to cautiously caress the ends of Harry's hair before turning to faint in his twin’s arm.
"Hey kid. We see you're going up to our house here." The man that was speaking to him was wearing a fox mask — though this was obviously a mask, however attractive, and nothing like the uncanny animal faces on those hooded figures in the park he had first appeared in.
"Of course, David. Make sure to share some with Steve this time. I know you ate his slice yesterday," Lily scolded, hands on her hips and in full view of the front window so that the men could see her disapproving figure through their omnioculars.
"So, tell me about you. Who is Draco Malfoy when he's not the voice keeping us company every day?" Harry asked casually as he took a sip of the white wine that Draco had picked. It was perfectly suited to Harry's taste and Harry let Draco know that immediately, enjoying the pleased look he was able to get in return.
"No hiding that, I'm afraid," said Sirius, who was not his godfather, with a laugh. "Though you are rather short. Most Potters like to tower."
"Me and Remmy here," Sirius began, wrapping an arm around Remus' waist and tugging him in close to his body. "We were on a top secret mission in the Department of Mysteries and got a bit lost and found ourselves near that veil. Then an Unspeakable appeared out of no where, scared the shit right out of us and before we knew it we were falling headfirst into the psychedelic acid trip beyond the veil." Remus shook his head in exasperation at Sirius' explanation but didn't object to any of the details.
So Harry walked up onto the platform, intent on giving the cloth a stern talking to when he was suddenly suctioned into the portal behind it — like a dust bunny being hoovered up (the indignity of it all!)
"I'm sorry," She said looking down in an attempt to look apologetic, but Harry could see the sly unrepentant smile on her lips.
When he figured he was as prepared as he could stand to be, he lined himself up and slowly allowed himself to take Draco inside him. As he slowly inched down, feeling that cock stretching him open each step of the way, he realized that it was even better than he had expected and that was wonderful. Once he was fully seated, he looked up at Draco and felt himself melt as he saw the way the other man tried to stay still and allow Harry to dictate the pace.
"You sound like you're talking from experience?" Harry watched as Sirius shifted guiltily in his seat, seeming to try and hide behind his lover who was just smirking in amusement.
"Oh yeah. So apparently our counterparts in this world are dead. Voldemort was not happy when he found us here. Course we promised that we'd play nice, so he just threw his hands up and declared his only press conference where he issued a blanket denial of all of us. You're not supposed to acknowledge that we exist at all." Harry thought about that, and had some more questions.
Their lips met in hesitant brushes at first, gaining confidence with each swipe until they were sure that the other wouldn't run away if they became a little forceful. A tongue slipped into one mouth, exploring the unique contours before coaxing its partner into a dance. Someone moaned, as hands began wandering, stripping off clothing and sliding against naked skin. Draco moaned as Harry pulled away to kiss a trail down his neck and into the crook of his neck where he sunk his teeth. Harry felt Draco slip his hand into his hair — as he'd imagined out loud for all of Wizarding Britain to hear — and tugged at the strands in encouragement, rutting his hips as he gasped out for more.
He had been in the Department of Mysteries — which, alright, was already highly suspect as he really had no reason to be there in the first place — and had found himself in the Death Room (or the curtain room as he referred to it in the privacy of his mind). To someone with far more sense than the current iteration of Potter, this already would have been cause for concern and most likely setting off alarm bells in their head — obviously, this was not the case at the present moment.
"Better," George said in awe before the twins broke down laughing, leaning on each other for support as they could hardly stand straight from the force of the wheezes wracking their bodies.
"Well, I suppose I don't really have a choice, now do I?" Harry snorted, before blushing as he realized that he'd unintentionally sassed his not-original-but-now-sorta-adopted-father. The fond look he got in return made him feel warm and went a long way in endearing this very odd world to Harry.
"I was just sitting here in my room, alone because everyone else in this house is too busy to spend time with me, and then I heard your lovely voice and realized that you might be interested in what I had to say."
Harry Potter was now older and wiser than the reckless teenager that threw himself headfirst into danger while at Hogwarts — or so he had thought.
Good morning listeners! I hope everyone has been having as fantastic a week as I have. Oh, who am I kidding, you possibly couldn't.
Now, for an important message: [There was a pause of silence to indicate a transition. Then, an ear splitting screech was relayed over the air. It continued on, like rusty nails being dragged over a particularly squeaky chalkboard before cutting off as abruptly as it began.]
He had even accepted that the public libraries (which were a delightful addition to Wizarding society in Harry's opinion) were now staffed with banshees rallied under the ruthless leadership of the Grey Lady who now went by Charlotte. Of course, now the punishments for late book returns and property damage were more deadly, but overall the fact that Magical London even had a public library at all was considered an improvement.
"He actually completely destroyed it. Did away with prisons entirely. That's when he came up with the idea for the re-education camps."
"Oh! And the redactions from the broadcast?" Harry remembered the series of beeps that had covered up each of their names.
"James took Padfoot for a walk in the dog park. They had stupidly assumed that the name meant that it was for people to walk their dogs. It was not. They had to go into re-education, which apparently consisted of just writing lines repeatedly every day for two weeks." Remus explained, sounding amused by the experience.
"We should invite Albus and Gellert over — they're also from another dimension. Oh! And the Weasley's. They actually are from around here, but we've grown quite fond of them." Before James could toss the floo powder in to summon all the people he'd listed though, a tinny voice appeared to come from the bowl of fruit placed in the middle of the room.
"Would be a bit hypocritical of us, otherwise. None of us are originally from around here," Remus said from beside Sirius, sounding just as sensible as his old school teacher.
The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him, studying them. They looked green and ghastly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet-they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too. It was as if he sprouted flippers.
"I'm afraid there's nothing you can do, Dragon," she said. "The best thing we can do for Harry is give him time. And the best thing you can do for him is simply be there for him."
Then there were the worst words spoken not by an enemy but by you. Words that didn't faze you (not in the beginning) but was a slap across the face to those close to you. Words that stung them worse than a knife's kiss.
Harry rubbed his cheek harder, but there was still a stubborn spot that refused to be moved. Close to the corner of his lip.
Sirius made it happen. There were hardly any buts to stop him. Not from Fudge, who despite everything, thought it was a fine idea. Not from Dumbledore. Not from Aunt Cissa. Unlike last time, Draco didn't put up a fight or refusals, but the look of absolute hurt in his eyes said enough.
To everyone's surprise, the hippogriff bent its scaly front knees and sank into a what was an unmistakable bow.
Viktor recalled Walter's beet-red face as he exploded in fury. He recalled the pleading and screaming from Ms. Parkinson as he ran, following him into dreams until he locked them away. He shook his head to clear away the memory, but he could still hear her screaming.
"Her Veela senses would still classify as a weapon," Theo replied. "And quit complaining, Parkinson. She was brilliant and you know it."
A woman emerged from the flames walking into the room with such elegance it stunned Draco that she wasn't a pureblood. She certainly possessed the looks. Though she wasn't as regal as his mother, there was something striking about her. Something that drew the eye. Waves of fiery red hair tumbled down her shoulders and the most striking pair of green eyes smiled as they looked down at him.
Severus scoffed. To think, the fool actually believed it was that simple. "So hard to do so, Lupin, when a threat is near. The Headmaster seems to think otherwise but I am not that trusting."
"Well-" Harry tried again but Neville, who had been lounging by the chair close to the mirror, chose that time to speak up.
A smile curled Harry's lips. The World Quidditch tournament was today, which Harry and his friends would be seeing thanks to Mr. Weasley who had gotten great seats from a friend at the Ministry. Enough seats for his entire family, enough seats for Ron to bring Harry and Hermione along. It was like the wizarding world's version of the Olympics, bigger though with flying and tricks. The last time Harry went, he was around nine or ten and it was one of the best nights of his life. Uncle Lucius had gotten them the best seats, treating the boys to all the toys and food they wanted. Harry and Draco could barely sit still, cheering as they watched the players whirl over their heads.
"Seems to be part of my job description," Draco resisted the urge to snarl at him, knowing whatever he threw at him the grouch would threw it right back. "Harry hasn't spoken to you at all?"
Pettigrew ran over to the piano but realized too late he backed himself into a corner. Remus by his left, Sirius by his right, wands drawn, faces hard as stone.
A week before Draco went off to France, after sending dozens of unanswered letters, Mother went over to Grimmauld Place to check on Harry. He insisted that he came along, but she refused to. Half an hour later, she returned looking shaken.
There were times when she was so brilliant, she amazed even herself. And this was one of those moments.
A fresh layer of snow laid over the forest, so white and soft-looking like a plush, fresh blanket, completely untouched. Only it didn't stay that way for long. Soon the fresh sheets of snows were marred by footsteps and handprints as the group of friends were engaged in a fierce snowball fight, shrieks and laughter and curses echoing throughout the woods, filling the air.
Harry's smirk broadened. If it wasn't for the fact his body was so weak, Draco would have threw a pillow at his head to knock off that smirk.
Along with the fact that this Mr. Evans who persuaded Leah to change her mind would be the same one leading Scorpius's class.
If life was fair, then he would be allowed to eat all the sweets he wanted without being scolded for ruining his appetite.
That was a good question, one that required Harry to think long and hard about it. "I trust…that he's a brilliant wizard."
It was when the yelping stopped did he realize why. Sirius was back in his human form, body scrunched into a ball, hands over his head.
The girl's eyes narrowed into slits as she looked to Draco. Then widened as they stared at Harry, recognizing him instantly. "Holy cricket. You're Harry Potter."
"You obviously know about the full moon and the effects it has on werewolves. I'm sure you experienced the effects firsthand with the former Professor Lupin. Its' sister, on the other hand, is not widely known."
do that to me again!" Draco demanded. The words no softer than a murmur but the intensity behind it as powerful as a scream. "Do you understand?"
"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth...a spell or two of my own invention...a little help from my dear Nagini," Voldemort's red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, "a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided...I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel.
But this Sunday tea was different. Another pure-blood would be coming, but this pureblood was a newcomer in his parents' social circle even though he was part of a family that has been around for centuries, rich in wealth and influence.
It was either endless hours spent practicing or luck orchestrating every step that made the dance come out as flawlessly, clean-cut as it did. Sure, they were a few bumps here and there (99.9% of which came from Harry) but overall it went well.
Harry left the office without saying another word, too tired to even offer a nod. He was so tired, as if all the lost sleep that were traded in for studying and practicing were finally catching up with him, like bulldozers plowing into him. He grabbed onto the nearest wall to keep himself steady.
Severus's eyes glared warningly at his tone, but answered, "You start by learning to defend yourself. Firstly with the mind."
thought Draco was being crazy? Or stupid or drunk and crazy? What if he rejected him? A picture flashed through his mind. Vivid green eyes filled with unmasked, unspeakable horror and disgust, cringing at the sight of him. The image made fear coil tightly in his stomach. Made him nearly turn the other direction, to go back to his room and hide till New Year's.
Harry dropped his schoolbag beside him and took a step closer. His eyes looked at the bed covered with treats. Brows arched when he saw the movies Draco had lined on the trunk.
Grasping to find an adequate word, Draco sucked in quiet, frantic breaths and, when he was sure he could move, looked over his shoulder for a second. At first all he saw was black hair. Felt those lips still on him, softly kissing and nibbling along his ass cheeks, wringing out whatever energy he had left that wasn't dripping down his legs.
It took some time to adjust to the overwhelming red and gold décor of the room, a vast contrast to the green and silver he was used to. There was a fire toasting in the fireplace but no patrons to warm. Silence hung over the dorms like the strands of tinsels and lights hanging from the walls. The silence wasn't surprising, though. Most of the students went home for Christmas break. If he recalled correctly, only a dozen Gryffindors were here.
His uncle cut him off with an arched brow. He set a tray containing tea down on the table and sat down in his favorite chair. Harry leaned forward to grab a cup but not before he saw a plate of sandwiches next to the tea kettle. Peanut butter and jelly stuffed with marshmallow fluff, his favorite. Feeling a smile spread across his face, he looked up at Severus, who took a sip of his tea, avoiding his eyes.
And he was a good five seconds away from finishing Zabini off with a stab to the neck. Slowly, he turned his head away from the door and over to the other remaining patron of their island, his hands balling into such tight fists, he could feel his skin breaking.
Well, for Harry, it wasn't quite as simple. Actually, it was- just not the black and white close-minded simplicity Andromeda and so many others were under. But his own kind way of simple that wasn't as restrictive. He was a boy. Sometimes he was a girl. Sometimes he was both. Other times he was neither. He was a being who loved high-fashion. He was someone who loved tulle and satin as much as leather. Could appreciate a well turtleneck and pants combination just as easily as a strappy top and a skirt paired with heels. He simply loved fashion, including dresses.
Without another word to her, Draco picked up the books and left the library, ignoring the librarian's squabbles about him needing to check them out.
The serpent blinked his eyes several times, as if he needed time to adjust to his new condition, before looking up to his two spectators. His tongue peeked from his sealed lips, followed by a sharp hiss that warned of trouble if he was disturbed.
Harry's formerly limp body was curved into a tight ball. His eyes shut so tightly, Draco saw the veins rising through the skin. Draco reached for his shoulder and nearly lost his hand in the process.
The youngest Weasley child and Tonks's son, the adorable flower girl and ring-bearer, started off the march, stinging along smiles and laughs from the crowd as they made their debut.
Draco hummed in agreement. Definitely not up to pureblood standards, certainly not as elegant as the balls held at the Manor, but it was still better than what he expected.
He told them everything-all except the mysterious Death Eater who was given a harsh warning from his master, who kept silent while the rest of them laugh, who studied Harry with his pale eyes while strands of blonde hair escaped from his hood.
Severus snarled. Draco was beginning to understand why Uncle James was good friends with the man. They both took great pleasure in pushing Severus' buttons.
And so Harry did. He picked one up and took slow bites, helping himself to another, then another, and another. While he ate, Severus poured them tea, pushing Harry's cup towards him while he finished his own in one gulp.
seemed too kind to use. Draco wasn't even sure if what he had on should even be considered clothes. Scrapes seemed more fitting, the type people wouldn't even donate to the less than fortunate. An old jacket in a nasty shade of reddish-brown overstuffed with so many frills and laces. It looked more like a dress and possibly would have been considered presentable in the later 19th century with matching pants that barely covered his ankles. His vest was an odd gold-patterned thing that looked like it was designed in the dark, three sizes too big for the weasel. And for the finishing touch, a purple big tie that was knotted into a poorly-done ruined bow that sagged like a withering flower.
Dear sweet Merlin. He was actually talking to him about hormones. Hormones. The conversation may not have been as detailed as his parents' talks but it was just as mortifying.
Despite the fact he was only two, Jamie grinned as if he understood Harry's words. He grabbed onto Serena's little hand, which to their great relief didn't send her down a crying fit. "Baby."
Theo handed Harry his glasses. Harry thanked him with a nod and used his elbows to prop himself up into sitting position, ignoring the painful protests his body made. "What happened?"
In that moment, they were utterly powerless to this feeling, this fire that threatened to consume them from the inside out. Draco grabbed Harry's legs and lifted them. Harry wrapped them tight around Draco's waist, head flung back, their lips breaking apart as he groaned.
"Nothing. Just wondering how many times you had to beg and grovel until the poor dear finally took pity on you and said yes."
"I…" he swallowed down a nervous lump down. "I might have an idea. It actually kinda ties with my Christmas wish."
Like envy, secrets entangled you into their web either by accident or on purpose, clutching onto until you were choking.
It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. The speed of the players was incredible-the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to the one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.
Harry stepped forward and leaned his head against the mirror, hoping that Hermione and Neville were too lost in their private conversation to notice how flustered he became. The cold touch of the mirror helped cool down a bit of the heat, bringing back some form of clarity. And an idea.
"Apparently this Dumbledore thinks that you should live with us. Something about blood wards, which is suppose to protect you." His aunt said. She was a nasty-looking, uptight woman with a high, unpleasant voice to match her personality.
He didn't know what he expected to find, but knew as soon as he came into the clearing that it wasn't there.
Unsure what to say, Harry glanced over at the name on Andromeda's left. Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double link to Rodolphus Lestrange.
The last part wasn't too big of a request to make, mainly thanks to Aunt Cissa who was keeping her word to Minister Fudge about them staying put in London. The boys barely left the manor other than to go to Diagon Alley once their letters came in again to get new school supplies, including a killer Monster book that nearly tore the book-clerk's hand off.
"When I got jealous seeing you with Daphne at the Christmas ball. And when I got jealous again when you took Pansy to the Yule Ball. And…and what happened afterwards." Heat surged through his veins, pooling in his lower gut as he thought back on it.
This time, though, Draco needed assistance. "I need every single book regarding the second Wizarding War, particularly books and articles mentioning anything regarding the Dark Lord's followers."
"Each one weighted a bloody ton!" he complained during the carriage ride, rubbing his aching head. "What the hell do you have in them?"
She nodded with a smile. Harry walked towards the exit. He was close to five steps in when he realized he wasn't hearing footsteps behind it. He turned back. Draco was still standing at the same spot.
Harry really didn't see laughing the same thing as drooling but decided to keep that opinion to himself, knowing he would be the new target of those glaring eyes if he said anything.
A childish part of him wanted to snap at her. That she was annoying insect like Granger. But he forced himself to remain cool, grinding his teeth so hard, he could feel them cracking in the process.
"When I-I-I get my h-h-hands on you, P-P-Parkinson," he snarled, his teeth chattering. "I'm gonna have your h-h-head."
Harry remembered playing with the badge when he was little as his dad showed him all of the Hogwarts prizes he saved in his trunk, including his old Quidditch gear. He wondered what happened to that trunk. If it was still in the basement or destroyed along with most of their house.
Obviously there were gaps, big ones in between those moments. He could feel it. Yet for the life of him he couldn't remember. It was like there were black holes planted in his mind. The more he tried to grasp onto something, a memory, a fragment, the bigger the holes got.
He gripped onto the ground tightly, silver light pooling around his body. His eyes snapped open, pale blue eyes glowing vividly. He unclenched his hands from the ground and slowly got up. As he stood, wiry branches flocked with feathers sprouted from the scars on his back, growing and expanding, unfolding and spreading into a pair of beautiful pure-white wings.
A steak of warmth flared his face, stirring in his stomach as he remembered how Fleur caught them holding hands, an act that was simply natural to them but may come across as strange to an outsider.
The grimace on Harry's face caused the left corner of Severus' mouth to lift slightly. "While I'm happy to see that lessons Narcissa has given you on etiquettes and pleasantry conversation are still intact, you should know that I see right through it."
That was certainly one reason why he didn't tell them about the Death Eater. The other reason was Draco.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in a low whisper, but each word rang with perfect clarity. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate powers of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death-if you aren't as big as the dunderheads I usually have to teach."
Dobby flinched from the harsh demand, but wasted no time. "Come Mister Harry. Dobby will take care of you. Dobby will make sure you're okay."
The choker had been a non-negotiable deal with Narcissa, but the dress was the major one with Andromeda. When she heard the news of their engagement, much as she tried, Andromeda couldn't completely hide the grimace that smacked onto her face. Seeing it, Harry was almost tempted for the sake of the peace to switch into a suit. It would have been an easy route, and he was sure he would find something equally as good that would match and also stand out from Draco's own. But in the end, he just couldn't. He couldn't see himself see anything else but a dress. It meant too much to him.
Minutes later after much sewing and poking, the robes were done and packed. Draco reminded Madame to watch herself next time while Harry thanked her with a smile.
The water didn't sting as it did before. It didn't even feel cold. It felt nice. He felt nice, pleasantly cool and very light. After one more glance at his webbed hands and flipper-like feet, Harry began to swim, moving so far and fast that he was soon approaching the depths of the lake.
Harry looked over at Draco, whose eyes shone in approval of the armor. "I thought you were a princess?"
"Your parents set aside a large sum that should have you living comfortably until your sixteenth birthday, which is when you'll be able to have full access to your inheritance."
Those beautiful green eyes weren't as empty like before but they were still weary, hooded. Draco, though, was able to see a bit of amazement that broke through the surface of that hooded cover as Harry looked at him. Almost as if Draco was the one that was missing and Harry was the one anxiously waiting for his appearance.
After getting one more reminder from Uncle about minding themselves and studying and hugs and kisses from Aunt Cissa, the boys boarded the train. Almost every single compartment was full. They walked down to the end of the train until they found one vacant of people.
The smile she gifted him was so sweet, dripped with honey, and leaned in for a kiss. Soft lips devoured him with each suck and nibble. Soft hands unraveled him layer by layer. Vivid emeralds were all he could see before everything fell away to black.
Draco scoffed and examined his nails, needing something to do. "Just the same as every other kiss I received: completely, utterly irrelevant."
Sirius tilted back his head and finished the rest of his drink in one swig, grimacing as he swallowed down. Anger in those glassy eyes as he studied the tapestry, toying with the cup as if he were deciding whether or not he wanted to throw the glass against it.
The Weasley twins were less than pleased. One titled his head back and let out a groan. The other slapped the palm of his hand against his forehead.
Harry rolled his eyes, but couldn't stop the grin that lifted up the corners of his lips. He took out his sword and held it high. "Onwards!"
With the last button undone, Harry exchanged his school-shirt for a red t-shirt, then threw on a pair of sweat-pants.
Draco laid his head onto her shoulder and felt a familiar hand sliding into his open palm. He glanced over to see his and Harry's hands joined together, fingers entwined. Warmth sent off in his chest and he grasped his hand tighter.
Another good question. Harry thought back on it. One side of him was too stuck on Karkaoff's words, painting images of the dark mark inked on Severus's forearm, his face concealed by the sterling silver mask, turning a blind eye to the pain going around by him, having an hand in causing that same pain. Another part of him refused to give in, reminding Harry of how Severus was trusted by his mum to care for him, how the man did exactly that and more. That same part that recalled thousands of memories of Severus protecting him, watching out for him, holding onto him and letting him cry when memories of Halloween night were too much to handle, scolding him when he screwed up, quietly encouraging him with a rare nod or smile. Being not only a reliable, trust-worthy uncle, but becoming a father to Harry.
He managed to put on a soft smile on her, but he noticed how frail hers suddenly became. Mother studied him, truly studied him, eyes darting over his eyes, his cheeks, his nose, then back to his eyes again. Taking everything in.
Draco captured every moment of it. Like the way Harry's body nearly curled into a ball around him before going limp and open in his arms. Didn't want to miss the unending groans and whimpers Harry tried to conceal by biting down on his bottom lip. The total, complete ease of bliss that spread across his face.
Unable to take it anymore, Draco yanked away his hand and kissed Harry so hard, he felt the impact vibrating through his teeth. His tongue darted frantically around Harry's mouth, claiming every centimeter.
He wasn't alone in the feeling. Severus looked as if he were tempted to join Draco into making Weasley-bastard confetti.
Nisa's breath came in a soft whoosh as her back landed on the red satin sheets in the candle-lit bedroom of the she-devil's lair. Alll her thoughts, all her focus honed on the dark beauty before her, standing at the foot of the bed, equally bare as she, pinning Nisa down with those wicked eyes and smile.
Any other person, Harry would have hexed them for the comment. However if there was anyone who shared in his misery from gossip from last year, it was Pansy who came under heavy fire after the mess at the Yule Ball.
From the faint consciousness of his mind that wasn't spiraling into a void, Harry picked up the sound of shattered porcelain. He could feel the spilled tea seeping into his shoes. But most of his attention was focused on the snap he felt break inside him like a bone, a snap that went on and on, bending this way and that, the cracked fragments dropping all the way down to the pit of his stomach.
Anxiously, Harry had stretched out his hand. The second his finger touched cold glass, a strange curl twisted his mouth that was unsettling, a drop of red splashed in center of his eye before it spread. A vivid, menacing red that completely consumed emerald-green until not a speck of it was seen, holding a smile within its gaze that chilled Harry right to the bone as they stared at him.
"Minister Fudge, your opinion on the matter holds the same irrelevant value then as they do now," Fudge flinched as if he were slapped. Narcissa didn't spare him a glance, focusing her cool gaze on Sirius, who returned it with an icy glare of his own. "Allow me to rephrase the question. What makes you think I'd allow you full custody?"
Pansy would've clawed his eyes out if Crabbe and Goyle didn't hold her down. Blaise glanced between the two locked in a death-glare match, amusement ringing in his voice as he said, "We got liquor, shovels, books. Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful life together."
The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail's neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail's weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rime of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud.
Draco opened his mouth to respond, then closed it, dumbfounded. Harry laughed. His right wrist may have broken, but his left arm was fine. Or was until Draco slammed a hard punch against it.
Before a question could be asked, a breath could be taken, Draco silenced him again with his another kiss that produced into another, then another, making him forget about insignificant things like the cold or time. He kissed Harry passionately but precisely, making him cry out for more. Then when his lungs needed air and he had to pull back, Draco's kisses were imprinted onto his neck, licking and nibbling and sucking, making sure not one spot was untouched.
"But," Harry said. "Since you're also my best friend that means you're also my boy. Which means you're mine, too."
"Let's see," he said in his silkiest voice. "Ten points from Gryffindor for provoking a student, fifty for dueling on school grounds, and five for verbal assault on a teacher."
The stinging sensation spread from his left side to the right, stretched down to his hips, reached up to his neck until it felt like thousands of fire ants were crawling underneath his skin, biting their way through the surface. No, not fire ants. Spiders. Each touch iced his veins, paralyzed his limbs, causing him to fall flat on his back. Dimly he was aware of the anxiety and yelling that shattered throughout the room, but all he could focus on was the pain, the intense cold.
He refused to give her the satisfaction on knowing that she had gotten to him. He refused to give the students with their whispers, their looks more fuel to use for their stories. For the whole hour of class, he managed to keep a calm, cool composure that actually would please Aunt Cissa. Lucius too.
From the corner of his eye, Draco spotted Harry and Granger standing near Weasley who was still at the table, his date long gone. Judging by the frowns on the weasel and insect's faces, they were locked in an argument. Judging by the half-annoyed, half-exhausted look on his face, Harry was struggling to keep the peace.
What if something went wrong like it did with his broom? What if the gillyweed only got him to the bottom of the lake and then failed on him? What if the gillyweed's power wore out before he could get back what was stolen? What if he had to fight a band of mermaids?
As for himself, life couldn't be any better for Draco. His best friend now lived with them, was now part of the family, and he could see Harry anytime he wanted. They had lessons together, though sometimes there were sessions meant for one that the other couldn't attend. After lessons, they'd disappear into the backyard or the Quidditch field where they'd be gone for hours. They even slept in the same bed together. The first night living together Draco slept in his room while Harry slept in the room Mother set up for him that was next door. Even though there was a door that connected the two, the distance felt odd. Within minutes, Harry came into the room and Draco welcomed him into his bed. Since then his room had became their room.
"However I know that you will manage through it. As long as you stick close, keep your guard up, and stay close to each other. Though I doubt the latter will be much of a problem for you," Draco nudged Harry and gave him a smile that was returned. "And further more I expect you both to be mindful and study hard. You both made top marks the past two years and I expect the same for third year."
Harry scooted over, making room for him on the tiny bed. Draco settled himself in, pulling Harry against him. Harry laid his head on his shoulder.
"Here is what you are going to do,' Draco said in that calm, velvety voice he used for Granger. He leaned down. "You are going to keep Harry's name out of your mouth and encourage your fellow Gryffindors to do the same if you know what's good for you. You are going to make clear, should any question be asked, the only fault of this whole mishap was yours for believing in the garbage that is the Daily Prophet. You are going to insist, that if dark magic was used, it was a curse triggered by your great recklessness and stupidity."
"I wasn't present at dinner when the announcement of the troll was made. I-I was a bit preoccupied," There were still faint traces of tears on the girl's face. Weasley looked at them and then away, ashamed. "Ron, Harry, and Draco saved me. If it weren't for them, I'd probably be dead."
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him. Harry immediately rose his hand along with Hermione's. Professor Umbridge's pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.
Pansy laughed as well but for an entirely different reason, saying, "Or like dear Nott in Hufflepuff."
"When I said, Potter, the best way to kill the scandal is to create a bigger one," Blaise said. "I should have stressed that when creating that scandal, there's a fine line between sizzle and a total shit fire."
He wasn't going to be hiding away when Voldemort returned. He refused to be helpless like last time.
“Are you speaking from experience, Pansy? Only Angelica told me you and Blaise were looking cosy after I left that night.” Draco shifted his head slightly to look at his friend while remaining in a reclined position.
Borgin paused meaningfully at the name, though Draco couldn’t understand the significance. Gaunt was a terminated pure wizarding bloodline. That there could be any relic of theirs that was recognisable, moreover what the Dark Lord would care about it was a mystery.
“Or here’s another one, Queen Titania’s Tiara. ‘Said to remove illusions from the eyes of the wearer,’” suggested Harry, but Luna merely blinked in response.
“But how could he believe it? Potter isn’t even named in the prophecy, it could have been anyone if the dates lined up.”
Harry’s brow furrowed. He’d expected that the other four would all be avoiding each other after their rift the other night. Of course he wanted things to blow over, but not without him.
“Alright, drop it, you two,” said Harry, steering his guides down a tapestry-lined corridor. “Haven’t we got somewhere to be?”
“I mean what an idiot,” said Draco at last. “He spends half of his life fighting against the wizard he ultimately succumbed to in the end. Was he a rebel or a follower?”
“Honestly, Muggles have no sense of fashion.” Draco picked up the sleeve of a puffy jacket slung over the back of the desk chair and let it fall.
Hogwarts loomed like a gothic cathedral reaching upwards into the sky. The dwindling rays of sunlight cast a golden sheen to the windows, while the velvety sky overhead already twinkled with starlight. Had he really been in this magnificent place all this time?
He stopped dead in his tracks, picking up a flashing paper and unfolding it to reveal a portrait of his parents, holding a dark-haired baby boy and smiling.
McGonagall’s mouth twitched, but she managed a curt nod. “It is a significant loss for all our kind.”
“Business dealings… with my father?” said Draco, still trying to wrap his mind around what was being said. In all the accounts he’d heard of his father’s ties to the American wizarding community, he was positive neither golf nor a business venture with Edgar DuPont had ever been mentioned.
The door opened to reveal a bare room with tall ceilings and three long windows which cast beams of light on the pale floor. The walls were a cream coloured sandstone, curving into a dome shape overhead. At first, Harry thought the room was empty, but then he saw that on the floor was a lone object: a dingy silver tiara encrusted with sapphires.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow in bemusement. “In wizard sports, the teams are there to win,” he said with teacherly patience.
“After the roaring success of the first one? It’s my fault you’re in this mess,” Draco said, his eyes fixed on the hem of Harry’s bedsheets. Somehow, he couldn’t bring himself to look Harry in the face. Not while he was telling him half-truths. “I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me that you’d be targeted there. I should have seen it coming.”
“Did I just hear Hermione Granger insult a lesson plan?” said Draco, raising his eyebrows appreciatively. If he didn’t know better, he might start to think there was more behind the insufferable bookworm than he’d been led to believe.
Draco hardly felt the pain, as the skin on the back of his hand was cut open and in a moment his signature was glistening menacingly on the page in his own blood.
“To parents that had thrice defied him?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Name anyone more likely to have done so than members of the Order.”
As they began to take off, Draco heard a shout from the far end of the street. A group of three dark figures came clamouring into view, spouting off stunning spells in their direction. Tonks responded immediately, putting up a shield on their side of the street. More than half of the pack was still on the ground.
“Not enough.” Try as he might after the session with Malfoy, Harry couldn’t access the memories of the green flash. And now more than ever he was dying to learn about these incredible people he had never known, but who so many in this world held in high esteem. “What’s Malfoy’s story, anyway?”
Suddenly a jet of red light flew out of the wall of mist and hit Draco on the arm, causing him to leap off the stool.
She hated when he called her professor outside of Hogwarts. It was one of his many small tells she had learned over the years; his use of the formality was a quiet reassurance of the natural order of things. Despite the tinkle of laughter in his voice, she had the genuine sense that Albus was afraid.
It also didn’t help that Draco was looking particularly refined as he sat with one leg crossed over his knee, chin resting in his hand, perched on the arm of the chair as he looked over the plans they had sketched out. Only Draco could make a zigzag striped jumper and joggers look elegant.
“Please,” said Harry, turning back to the elderly teacher and hoping there was something he could do to appeal to her judgement. “My friend is still out there – I have to get back to her. Don’t you think my parents would want you to believe in me enough to let me go?”
Voldemort’s head snapped to him so quickly, Harry thought he saw the enchanted flames shudder. “What did you say?”
Whenever he thought of squashing old arguments, Potter’s annoying face came swimming into view. He’d replayed their conversation at the statue over and over, wondering if his longtime foe had really grown past their old differences. Wondering why it was he thought Draco would do more with his life than marry rich.
“And why do you think he chooses orphans, Harry,” said Voldemort, taking a few slow paces to turn and face him, a dangerous edge to his voice. “Because we are disposable.”
” trailed off into frustrated scribbles. Perhaps his mother would sense something unusual in the vagueness and he could attempt to share further details over time. Did a Fidelius Charm weaken with age?
“You can’t possibly be here to play golf, so what is it you’re really up to? Trying to expose me for a fraud, hm? Because I’ll have you know it will not work. I’ve already gotten Edgar’s blessing on the match. It’s practically a done deal,” he lied.
“Fine by me,” he said, wondering what a proper wand would feel like if the ones he’d been using so far weren’t a match. “Thank you, Mr Ollivander.”
The man who spent every Sunday for the last decade with him was not solely invested in him as a pawn in some grand scheme. Al cared about him, didn’t he?
His name? Hermione hadn’t equipped him with a false identity, only a longer nose. He glanced over to her, where she was biting her lip, realising her mistake as well. It sure would be a good time to know Legilimency, he thought reluctantly.
“That’s just it,” said Harry, settling back into the sofa and looking at Draco with relief. “I know exactly what I need to be learning, I can see it in all the books Hermione’s brought me, but they’ve got me focused on levitating feathers and shooting off red sparks.”
“You’re mental,” said Cedric, heading to the basin as usual and summoning it to a nearby table. “The Cannons have had their best season in years. And they pulled off that win against the Magpies in the middle of a hailstorm, remember?”
“Who knows?” said Draco flippantly. If he were famous, he’d probably pick a pretty but silent one too.
, share stories about the other students in the castle, or just generally take Harry’s mind off things.
Harry faltered. There was no way for Luna to know this, he’d never even told Draco the story of Dudley’s 11th birthday.
Reflecting on his feelings for a moment, he recalled the initial shame he felt when Draco started first seeing his memories of the Dursleys. It had been a part of his past he wished he could rewrite. But now, knowing who his parents were and, more importantly, the power he had to create his own family, he felt that his childhood no longer defined him.
“Very well, I’ll send Cedric,” said McGonagall, trying to bring the conversation to a close. “Anything else, Miss Granger?”
“Oh,” said Draco, lingering by his things. The austere corridor seemed colder and darker than he remembered it. “I should go up and see her.”
“Harry, I’m really not sure this is such a good idea,” interrupted Hermione, who was biting her thumbnail anxiously.
“The prophecy is real?” asked Draco in disbelief. “You said he went after the Potters to make an example. Because they were Muggle sympathisers and rebels.”
Harry searched his face for the signs – it checked out. He was telling the truth. But there was something else, something he was hiding carefully, always tiptoeing around the subjects that might connect him, as Harry suspected, to followers of the Dark Lord.
At the Ravenclaw table, Luna was piling a scone with bacon and blueberry jam, seemingly oblivious to a bumbling Neville who was trying to get her attention with a small wrapped gift.
“The investigation into Albus Dumbledore’s affairs has nothing whatsoever to do with the governance of this school,” said McGonagall with biting coldness. “Nor have I given any permission to conduct the search that is being undertaken in this very office, and I will not consent to a single belonging being removed from this room.”
“Master?” said Snape. Draco was surprised to hear a tone of amusement in his voice. “Keep your glory, Draco. If it were power I sought, I would not have become a teacher. But be careful – our ‘Master’ is not known for sharing power, and he grows stronger every day.”
“Your navigation is definitely improving. Let’s start in the same place as last time. That seemed like a stable memory.” Malfoy drew his wand out of a robe pocket and pointed it at Harry’s chair, dragging him closer. Harry clamped down on the seat to steady himself. “Only instead of using a token in the room, try picking something that isn’t there tangibly. We’re just trying to go from the room to an unlinked memory and back, keeping you in control the whole time. Got it?”
But Snape had started doing something Draco had never seen, nor even thought possible. He was laughing. His shoulders bounced with quiet laughter as he shook his head, his dark hair falling in front of his eyes.
“You played golf with my father?” Draco asked, hesitantly. He was almost certain this could not be the case. He couldn’t remember a time his father had touched a non-magical item, much less picture him walking around a green.
“This isn’t you,” she said, holding her wand steady but failing to mask the concern in her voice. “You forget I can always tell when you’re lying.”
“I mean if you had told me you planned on bringing a date to London it would have saved me having to owl Potter last minute to get him on the guest list,”
“Very well, sir,” said Draco. “All the allied families have maintained cover at Hogwarts. I don’t think anyone at the school expects our involvement—”
“Oh, that’s from my programming class,” said Harry, recognising the gift from Mr Salerni he’d packed. “You can borrow it if you like. Computer science is a lot like spell casting, you might find it interesting.”
Harry found himself in a hazy room with a mobile overhead. Snippets of memory, the warm hands of his father, the calming lullaby of his mother, overlapped like fuzzy patches on an old film reel.
The room was quiet as the grave for a moment as each person seemed to be waiting for someone else to break the silence, when suddenly Malfoy burst into the room. He was still wearing his green Quidditch robes which were streaked with rain, and looked like he had just run there. He ran a gloved hand through his damp hair, cheeks slightly flushed as his eyes fell on Harry in the bed.
Draco wasn’t sure if this was a slight or a compliment, but he carried on with the conversation, “I was wondering if perhaps you might shed any light on a certain deal, which my mother mentioned in her note?”
“No, definitely not,” said Hermione, blinking sceptically, as though it were the first time she’d considered such a thing.
“A heart!” said Luna, as looking between the cup in her hands and a textbook opened across her knees. “That means romance, or a loving home. Unless…” She turned the cup sideways. “It might be mountains, which means significant challenges lie ahead.”
“At school, sure. But in the Manor, we were often alone as a family. That’s just the way things are done,” said Draco, pretending the question wasn’t a sting. “Our position in society dictates a certain level of decorum.”
He was gaunt, his face thin and angular, but he was whole. The eyes that had been crimson and demonic when he’d seen them last were a deep maroon, only just starting to turn. Beneath the strong cheekbones and noble brow, Harry could almost see how the man had been formidable at one time, maybe even beautiful.
“Well, first of all, that’s just a preposterous deal to make over a game of golf,” she said, sitting up and collecting herself. “And second, because that’s Oliver Wood right there. He works for the Falcons now, doesn’t he?”
“I knew that Harry would have to break the Fidelius, eventually. I only wish I had realised it sooner,” said the portrait, lacing his fingers together. “You were right, my good friend.”
Minerva lingered a few moments longer, momentarily tempted to take Harry for her own, but she knew it was a futile wish. In a flurry of robes, she returned to her Animagus form, leaping up to her spot on the garden wall and twitching her cat ears in the direction of the sleeping child.
“Which is where you’ll head once you’re in,” said Harry. “We’ll have you under glamours so you’re just indiscernible enough not to be noticed by any students, and can blend in with Umbridge’s guard. Meanwhile, Hermione is under the invisibility cloak, ready to cause a diversion.”
“Probably because that’s where Ollivander’s shop is,” said Hermione, casting a diagnostic spell on the ring. “Your leg’s looking better by the way.”
Draco nodded in reverence. “And I presume you did your duty otherwise our Lord would not be with us now.”
“Well, it was better than the alternative,” said Draco. “By the way, how did your little Gryffindor gathering go in the end?”
Harry discovered that an unnamed dark wizard and pure-blood zealot had attempted to assume control of the wizarding world by amassing a collection of followers and honing illegal dark magic. However, he died when he attempted to perform a Killing Curse on a young magical family that defied him.
Harry was regarding him seriously, dark eyebrows knitted together, with a look of genuine concern — or was it pity? Draco could feel his blood boiling.
Crossing to the end of the bed, he pulled the heavy locks open and arranged the chess set out on the table. He sat down across from it, placing Ivy on the far side as if she were playing white. Folding his arms on the table, he studied the board, but it looked exactly the same as he remembered it all his life. He grasped a pawn, feeling the cool marble that had comforted him so long ago.
“Merely a rumour,” said Dumbledore, waving this away. “But we are the only ones who know the truth, and so we are the only ones who pose a risk to Harry if the secret were to get out.”
“Yes, of course,” said Hermione, sounding confident, though Harry could see her fingers fidgeting nervously. “The thing is, we’re in an advanced class for dark magic identification and prevention. Dudley and I are training to be Aurors.”
Draco sat back in his chair, returning the smile politely, trying to recall if he had ever met this man before. The office was altogether too.. still. He was used to the hum of magic, but this place felt devoid of it. Books stood solemnly on their shelves, pens were clustered in a cup, and a computer whirred away softly on the desk.
Snape’s nostrils flared as Draco smirked at him from his reclining position against the cabinet. The Potions Master wouldn’t dare cross him, Draco knew, not while he was under his father’s thumb so completely. He was pushing it, but he had a feeling Snape wouldn’t put him in his place. Not anymore.
“I’m insufferable?” hissed Draco as he marched behind him, trying not to speak too loudly as to be overheard by the other two. “You’ve come barging in on my quality time with my fiancée, attempting to upstage me at golf, of all things, and I’m the insufferable one? Should I expect the
“Surely with so many loyal followers to pick from, and several who could have offered him a home as nice as the Manor, he had to have a reason for coming to us first.”
“Harry!” called Luna, bounding over to the couch, the tassels of her fringed leather jacket flapping around her. “Did you see everything? What were the rebels planning?”
Draco leaned back instinctively. Surely the boy-legend himself couldn’t have been raised in a cupboard.
At the end of this little speech, she tilted her head and smiled, laying the scroll on the end of the desk with a little pat, where McGonagall did not touch it. The Aurors continued to toss the room noisily as the women stared each other down. Harry and Draco were glued to the spot.
He passed into a cavernous space that must have been a sitting room before it was enlarged to become the personal quarters of Lord Voldemort. Tall arched windows that faced the black grounds glistened in the low light, reflecting Harry as he passed by. Where there had recently been a long table, there was now only open space, flanked by masked Death Eaters who clustered around the walls.
Draco stumbled, at a loss for words. He had been pushing Potter rather hard. There had been a lot he was willing to show, more than Draco had been looking for even, but now he worried that the trust he’d spent the last few weeks building was wasted. Harry’s walls were back up, and stronger than before.
This close, Draco could see the faded mark of a lightning bolt shaped scar, obscured by a dark tangle of hair.
Draco held up a hand, and the man fell silent immediately. At least his pull outside of Hogwarts was still as strong as ever.
“He was loads better than they make him out to be in that book,” said Luna from her spot on the floor. “You should read the exclusive interview he gave the
“Thanks for everything, Luna,” said Harry, accepting the small form of Ivy back from her and tucking the snake into the pocket of his jumper. “I’ll never forget you. Or this place. Or any of it really,” said Harry with a laugh.
“Not even if I had to,” said Harry with a laugh. Draco cracked a grin and Harry was pleased to have done something to earn it.
“That’s got to be my friend, Charlotte,” he said with a laugh. Cedric frowned at his notes. “It’s an inside joke. You know, Lois Lane, the famous Metropolis journalist?”
Draco’s head snapped around from the Pensieve as Harry made his way behind the desk to converse with the portrait head on. He would have thought he’d have a million things to say to Al after all the nights he spent lying awake, thinking through how he would have done things differently if he could replay their last conversation over again. But he was drawing a blank.
“Why?” repeated Tonks, draping an arm over his shoulder and pulling him closer. “Because he’s a madman, that’s why. Whose brain had been too addled by dark magic and fucked up shit to make sense anymore and his followers are too blind or scared to do anything about it. I mean honestly, who culls their entire following on a regular basis and still manages to take over the world?”
Some of the Death Eaters that were nearby cried out, but Cedric dodged in behind Harry to shield him as a barrage of spells were shot their way. Harry glanced over his shoulder to see that the Death Eaters had overpowered several of the students and the fight which had at first seemed so promising, now seemed like a struggle for survival.
“He never mentioned a sister,” said Harry, holding the book gingerly. “I always assumed he didn’t have any family. Like me.”
Luna turned to face him, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “It was you in my vision too,” she said. “It has to be.”
Harry regarded the blond opposite him. At first glance he’d seemed like such an arse, but every time Harry met him, he revealed another interesting layer.
“Hey, you down there,” called a voice from the top of the stairs. Harry quickly flipped the hood of the cloak back over his head as a Ministry official came into view. He yanked his foot, but it was still wedged in the step. “What are you doing down here?”
Charlotte studied him for a moment, seemingly calculating how fast she could make a break for it if she decided Harry was an absolute nutter.
“More to the point, let’s pick up where we left off on memory recall,” said Draco, brushing the unwelcome sympathies away and lacing his fingers together, just as his mentor had sat when he first began tutoring Draco. “Our last session was a good baseline for shared thought experiences – now you know what the presence of a Legilimens feels like. But I think we can go deeper.”
Despite the verdict that Draco had been prepared to give himself, Harry saw more seeds of doubt than his friend had been willing to admit. None more poignant than his most recent conversations with Professor Snape, which had been some of the hardest memories to watch.
“Master Regulus!” cried Kreacher, snatching at the air, tangling his little hands in the golden chain and trying to tug it from Cedric’s grip. “Kreacher tried so hard. Kreacher tried his best master, Kreacher hasn’t forgotten his duty!”
“Oh, Harry, how dreadful,” said Luna. “I can tell you everything I know about it if you want. But you can ask anyone – if people knew you were alive, you’d be famous in our world.”
Tilting his head indulgently to mask his genuine concern, he drawled, “I hadn’t realised I was so transparent.”
But Draco shook his head. “It won’t work. He owns me. He will know when I’m nearby, if not today, then soon. If I show up again without bringing you in, he’ll torture me till he finds out where you are and without the Fidelius I’m not sure I’m strong enough to keep him out. And I’d rather die than be the reason he finds you.”
“I never said it would be easy,” said Harry. “But I want to know you. All of you. So don’t push me away now.”
“Dearest,” said Pansy, moving closer to him and running her hand through his hair. “Before too long you’re going to be married, and how will you feel then when all this is just a memory? I don’t want that for you. I know what it’s like to want something you can never have.”
As the memory faded and Draco found himself back in Sirius’s room, he could barely meet Harry’s gaze.
“Yeah, like what’s been going on in the Muggle world for the last four decades,” said Harry, narrowing his eyes. He was certain that Draco had to know something about world affairs beyond the small bubble of wizarding Britain, but he looked just as confused as Harry felt. “Jesus, don’t they teach you anything about the Muggle world? Surely wizards are impacted just the same if there is large-scale political upheaval.”
He had been unsure what to expect, heading out through muggle London earlier in the day with the address his mother had received by owl in response to her note to Lucius’s old business acquaintances. All Narcissa had told him was that after the first wizarding war, she and Lucius knew they needed to move quickly to realign their political affiliations with the right factions. His father had been extremely motivated to diversify the family’s investments in the instance that they were unable to get back in the ministry’s good graces and needed something to fall back on.
“Blast! Are you sure?” said Hermione, accepting the locket and turning it over in her hands. “Neville was so convinced. And he said Dumbledore practically gave his life for it. That has to mean something.”
It helped that every time he showed up in the room in Harry’s t-shirt, that Harry raked him over with his eyes. What Draco wouldn’t give to dive into his mind in one of those moments and see what he was thinking.
“I had hoped you’d come to the same conclusion, but I see now I have no choice,” said McGonagall from behind him as he strained to push through the barrier.
“You’re joking! Aw mate, you’re too good to us,” said Blaise, slapping Harry on the back, which seemed to knock the wind out of him.
“To reunions with old friends,” he said. The snake on his lap flicked her tongue. “I can’t tell you what a pleasure it’s been to see you, Draco.”
Wormtail wrung his hands and glanced at the snake nervously. “I’ve tried to find him once or twice, but I’ve never managed to get to him in time. He always… disappears.”
Harry didn’t think there was anything Hermione could say that would give him hope he’d be seeing out the day alive, but somehow this did.
“Now, now, this is a strange turn of events. The prodigal son returns only to partner with a usurper,” said Voldemort, continuing to chuckle heartlessly. “What do you think of that, Lucius, hm?” The silver-haired Death Eater did not move.
“I found the Quirrell file,” continued Cedric, scraping back a wooden chair next to Draco as the others gathered around. “It wasn’t easy, the department had it buried deep. But if we weren’t sure before, we can be now. You-Know-Who is definitely back.”
Meanwhile, Angelica and Harry seemed to have buddied up. She could be seen rambling on about something or other while Harry looked on and nodded, smiling and commenting every so often. As much as Draco wanted alone time with Edgar, he also didn’t want Angelica cosying up to his rival. If push came to shove, he wasn’t sure how attractive a future with him looked compared with what was certainly a life of fame and financial stability on Harry’s arm.
He saw the lock of his shower unclick and it was pushed open, and he looked directly into the face of Harry Potter. Draco just stared at him, his eyes raking over his perfectly sculpted abs, and then sighed.
“Colesevanescet is a spell that” she blushed “removes the genitalia from the person the spell is aimed at”
Harry sighed, and dropped his head into his hands. He wasn’t gay, but what he had just done wasn’t very straight. It was something about Malfoy, he couldn’t help it. The way he was so flirtatious, and confident with everything he did, never second guessing himself. He knew how to get a reaction out of Harry. and he was damn good at it. Always had been, ever since they were younger Malfoy had always drawn Harry’s attention. Ever since he had refused that handshake. How different would have things been if he hadn’t? Nope, Harry didn’t have time for existential wonderings. He cast a quick cleaning charm across himself, zipped up his jeans and stood up, running his hands through his hair to check he didn’t look like a complete mess. He knew his hair wouldn’t look perfect, but at least it wouldn’t look like he had just wanked over Draco Malfoy. He walked out of the classroom and back to the eighth year common room, pretending everything was normal.
Harry was overwhelmed for a minute before remembering the time limit, and how smug Malfoy would be if Harry lost.
He cut himself off again with a moan as Draco swallowed him down to the base of his cock. Hollowing his cheeks, he placed his hands on Harry's hips to stop him thrusting forwards.
Potter moaned as Draco pushed the heel of his hand against his cock, his hips automatically thrusting forward. Draco smirked, looking pleased with himself at this reaction. He put his lips against Potter’s ear “still straight, Potter?” he whispered.
“Shut up, Potter” Pansy cut him off before looking back at Weasley. He looked between Pansy and Potter, and looked as if he was deciding who would be worse to annoy. He decided it was Pansy, which was a good choice.
They all mounted their brooms and flew onto the air. Draco, Blaise, Theo, Lavender, Parvati, Padma and Daphne all hovered in a circle.
Pictures passed through his mind, Draco wanking alone in his bedroom. Draco on his knees in front of Harry, his blonde head sucking Harry's cock with earnest. Draco moaning Harry's name as he thrust into him, quick and hard. This was the image that pushed Harry over the edge. He came into his hand, moaning “oh fuck, Malfoy” as he did.
Mostly everyone was in bed, however mcgonagall was in her office, pacing slowly up and down. Harry allowed himself a small smile as he thought of how he had seen dumbledore do the same walk over and over again in the small space in front of his desk. his eyes wandered around the castle, seeing if anyone else was awake. Mrs Norris was moving through the corridors, Harry briefly acknowledged that he had never seen her sleep, he was so distracted looking at the map that he didn’t hear the quiet footsteps entering the common room until someone whispered “hey” softly from across the room.
He let Draco thrust forward in time with his hand, soon he moaned “Harry in going to-“ and came onto Harry's hand.
Blaise started “okay, Parvati and Padma, you two are beaters, try and distract Potter If he catches the Snitch, we're screwed. Me, Lavender and Daphne are chasers, we‘ll focus on getting goals past weasley.
“Good boy”, Draco glowered at him, Harry moved towards him. Palming Draco's cock immediately, the blonde boy moaned loudly. A creak could be heard from above them.
She threw a pillow at him. “no I just mean, for straight people it’s obvious. I’ve never had an actual guy inside of me with his thing”
He had just finished his usual shower routine, he thought no one else was in the showers. When he heard someone move around.
He put a hand on Malfoys waist and leaned in. Their lips met and Harry closed his eyes, he moved one hand up to Malfoys cheek and tilted his head slightly. He ran a tongue along Malfoy’s bottom lip, causing his mouth to open. Harry thrust his tongue into Malfoy’s mouth, coaxing a gasp out of the boy.
He shot her a glare, he knew he couldn’t resist. That was both the beauty and curse of slytherin truth or dare. “11 months”
Everyone laughed, but they looked away and continued playing. Apart from Potter, who continued to look at Draco with an open mouth. He smirked at him, then winked. Which seemed to pull him out of his stupor, Harry pulled his eyes away and flew across the pitch.
“How is slytherin truth or dare different from normal truth or dare?” Weasley asked, obviously unable to avoid looking at Malfoy for any longer.
Harry looked disgusted, and Ron shuffled away from him. “Nope, no, no, no, no, not happening. Make Harry kiss someone else. I’m not making out with a boy”
As much as Draco wanted to deny it, Harry was fucking hot. He had obviously been working out since the end of the war and it showed in every line along his stomach. Every muscle that was so defined it was practically in HD, he had scars almost everywhere, but that was to be expected, he had fought in a fucking war for merlins sake. he had a specifically large one just below his neck, as if a necklace had burned him there.
Pansy looked between them mischievously, “I don’t know Draco, I’m sure you once told me about a dream you-“
But Parkinson didn't look perturbed, “don't” she said to them both and stood up. She looked incredibly confident as she walked over to Ernie. She grabbed his hands and pushed him against the wall, her wand pushing into his throat. She leaned forward and said something quietly enough that Harry couldn't hear it, but Ernie's face drained of all colour. She took a single step back.
i’m sorry this is so late!! i’ve been on holiday recently and didn’t have the time, nor the wifi to be able to work on this
He did the first thing that came to mind, just as Harry was about to catch the snitch he shouted, “Potter, I want to suck your cock”
“WHAT THE FUCK POTTER?” Pansy shouted once again, her voice rising as her eyes darted back and forth between the two.
He was cut off as Draco grabbed his cock with one hand and  ran his tongue along it. He moaned and his hips thrust forward automatically.
Malfoy smirked at him, before cutting him off with his own lips. At first it was a tight lipped, ‘people are watching and I hate you’, kiss.
He saw Potter watching him, looking impressed. Draco smirked at him, maintaining eye contact as he drank another, that Pansy happened to place in front of him when she saw Potter watching. Potter raised an eyebrow, Draco didn't look away.
“Anything,” Draco moaned out, attempting to thrust his hips up once again, “everything. Everything you just said”
Potter stood up and collected his bags together, he deliberately took longer collecting his. As Potter walked past his desk he shot him a glare, Draco just smirked and winked. Which caused Potter to look even more angry, probably a mistake on Draco’s part but totally worth it.
Harry smirked and grabbed Dracos chin, moving it so they were making eye contact “Draco, don't think you are the one in charge here”
Around half an hour later, Potter’s team were winning at 6-2. Apparently Theo was not great at being keeper. Draco was so determined to catch the snitch, Potter was looking even more smug every time his team scored, and it made Draco want to kill him.
He gripped the arms of the chair as Blaise started to snore lightly and stared angrily into the fireplace, cursing Potter for messing up what would otherwise have been a perfectly good school year.
“I appreciate the early progress report,” said a tetchy McGonagall. “But I have much to attend to. If you need something you’d best get to the point.”
“Well, we always knew you were good at starting fires,” said Hermione, swatting at the singed pages of notes.
“Great, as soon as we know what we’re looking for, I can try to find what’s ‘hiding in plain sight,’” said Harry.
Draco withdrew from the memory, dreading the expression of disgust that would be on Harry’s face. Harry looked horror stricken.
“That’s it. Saving the world is on pause until we can figure it out,” joked Harry, jumping into the chair opposite.
He wasn’t sure what to make of Malfoy just yet. The first day they met he thought Malfoy embodied everything he hated about elitists, but the last Legilimency session had come as a bit of a surprise. He seemed genuinely interested in helping Harry access his memories, and he’d been true to his word about letting Harry take the lead.
“Making a buck? Yeah, I guess you could say that,” said DuPont with a shrug. “But if life gives you a buck, build an empire.”
“You’ve just got all the right problems for my solutions, I expect,” said Draco. This was just a facade, he told himself, something to keep Potter believing. But whatever it was, it was making his heart race.
“I am honoured, my lord,” said Draco, as the cold hand closed around his wrist and the point of a wand was dragged down the pale skin of his forearm.
“A wise lesson. But, every good friend was once a stranger,” said the voice. Draco pushed on the memory, trying to bring the voice into focus, or nudge Harry into the light to see the face of the speaker. But the park was growing hazy, like a mirror fogged up with steam.
“Depends on how far you’ve gotten with everything else,” said Cedric, looking in Hermione’s direction.
“Are you so determined to keep him from our kind that you would rather the world think him dead than see him placed with a loving wizarding family of no relation? Why even Sirius could—”
“Who else would I be talking about? It’s clear he terrifies you,” said Harry, leaning forward finally to reach out to his friend, laying a hand on his arm and fixing him with a solemn stare.
“Here let me try, '' said Harry, holding out his hand to accept the offending battery. “Do you still think she’s a nutter then?”
Realising that he might miss his opportunity to get involved in this little plot, Draco was quick to make his entrance with a polite knock. Whatever secret it was that Dumbledore was getting them to hide, he wanted to be the one to reveal it to the Dark Lord.
“Listen, Char,” he began, his hand closing reflexively around the holly wand in his pocket. “Before we go, there’s something I’ve got to tell you. Remember the dreams I was having, about the snake and the people in masks?”
A rustling like the sound of robes gliding over the rug issued from near the doorway he had just walked through.
Dumbledore chuckled lightly, the half-moon glasses on the end of his nose bobbing. “I need a great deal more than that. A dose of common sense would have gone a long way.”
“It’s for a Thestral who’s in love with a unicorn – could have sworn I mentioned it the other day. The Thestral fell in love at first sight, but the unicorn doesn’t know he exists because he’s never witnessed death.”
“Maybe Borgin would have some idea. What do you think, Draco?” said Hermione, turning to him. “Would you be up for a return visit?”
“You called?” said another voice from the kitchen as an identical redhead emerged. Then it clicked; these two had been Gryffindor’s Beaters, the Weasley twins.
“No, they… they couldn’t.” Harry flexed his hands angrily and a strange pulse of energy pushed through the room, rattling an empty plate on a dinner tray and ruffling the pages of an open book on the desk.
Draco hesitated. The face of a certain dark-haired wizard came swimming into view. Someone who was once an enemy, but now was a champion he was prepared to stand behind. Or beside.
“No, I mean it,” she insisted. “You’ve never given us a reason not to trust you. We’d be crazy not to put your mind to good use in all this, and I’m not about to let some stupid prejudice get in the way of that. And so… I’m sorry.”
“How could you admire a man who sanctioned that?” asked Harry, his dark brows furrowing. “That’s not justice, it’s barbarism.”
For one thing, having the others around all the time meant that he was never alone. For another, the old house was vast and filled with strange nooks and crannies, which were perfect for exploring when the team could no longer put brain power towards the task at hand.
“Seems a waste of time to be spending all that energy flirting in the first place,” continued Hermione, ignoring his comment. “She already thinks the world of you, Merlin knows why.”
Draco paused for a moment, processing what she’d said, and before he knew it she was playfully pushing his shoulders down to the bed, now completely on top of him. The golden curtain of hair fell over her shoulders, brushing lightly against his chest.
“Oh, was that everything? I didn’t expect there to be so little.” Harry scrutinised Malfoy for a beat, trying to sort out whether he really was the prick he made himself out to be, when the corners of his mouth quirked up.
Shifting to the edge of the bed, Harry became aware of an oppressive weight around his neck, hissing in a breath as a chain shifted. He reached into his sleep shirt to pull out a heavy golden locket – Slytherin’s locket from the Riddle memory – and noticed deep scorch marks in his chest beneath it.
“Well, my friend, you and I know there’s only one way to deal with a secret,” said Voldemort, his face parted in a smile that showed far too many teeth. “Either become the Secret Keeper. Or kill them.”
“Wands match the temperament of their owners,” said Draco at last, catching Harry’s eye as he looked up from the
“There was a note in it,” said Cedric, handing it across for Hermione and Harry to see. “Someone already came for the locket in the cave and replaced it with this one. He knew it was a Horcrux too – someone called RAB.”
“Well, you’re obviously not playing it right,” said Draco, feeling his lips quirking into a smile as he anticipated Harry’s reaction to what was about to unfold. As one might with an adorable puppy, Draco told himself sternly, and not with an incredibly attractive wizard. “Pawn to E4.”
“Sure,” said Draco, pushing back from the desk. “And by the way, you missed an error in the first paragraph. Lattice fly instead of Lacewing fly. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were losing your edge.”
“And I’m a Gryffindor,” said Hermione, beaming. “Honest, brave, practical. Many would say we’re the best house. Your parents were in Gryffindor.”
Draco tried his best not to look shocked with the news. Callum Harper the backup Seeker, and Theo Nott, one of his closest comrades, together? “Since when..?”
Draco was about to urge him out of the memory when there was a commotion in the water and Harry looked around, catching sight of his fat cousin flailing not too far off. He was moving swiftly out to sea, his head falling below the surface once or twice, unable to get out a sustained call for help. In a split second, Harry was off, paddling toward the pudgy Muggle.
“He lost control of the vision. He had to let me go,” said Harry, beaming. “Don’t you see? We’ve got the upper hand now! When the others get back, we can figure out a new plan. We may be able to kill him yet.”
“By then, of course, the entire country had gone to pot and by the time the world was back in order, it was largely forgotten,” continued Greenacre, swivelling slightly on his creaking chair. “Flamel & Sons even ended up making up for their losses after the war, but who’s surprised that war is good for medical alchemy.”
Harry strained against the vision. If McGonagall knew he was communicating with Voldemort, she might turn him over to the Ministry, or worse.
“Thestrals, my boy! Thestrals,” said the bard, dropping his lute dejectedly. “Creatures that feed on the blood of the innocent. A face like a skull, vicious fangs like tusks to rip and tear—”
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry flew into a rage. His breath was coming in shaky gasps, and his hands tingling, his ears ringing, and suddenly an explosive burst of magic ripped through him, shaking the house like an earthquake.
“It would be my pleasure,” Draco said, brushing past Harry to take his place down the practice hall. “Hate for you to end on a low note, Potter, but sometimes that’s the only way you learn.”
“It’s obvious,” said Angelia, flicking her long ponytail off her shoulder and then lacing her fingers together on her knee. “You are on the precipice of wizarding society. One wrong move and you will be living out your life on significantly different terms than you started it. And if I’m not very much mistaken, I don’t think your finances are faring too well either, judging by the state of the Manor. Moreover, you are the last of your bloodline. Quite an inconvenient position to be in for someone with no interest in women. What you need is a partner, a lineage, and a financial backer to lift you into your proper place in the world. How am I doing so far?”
The Thestral touched down in the park at Clearwater Court near where Harry and Al used to play their endless games of chess. It was surreal to be back in this place – only a few weeks gone and he already felt like a stranger. He gave the creature a good pat and the rest of the meat from the feast, before taking off in a light jog back to Privet Drive.
Luna took a few steps into the room, her footfalls echoing around the cavernous space. She cast a quick charm in the direction of the tiara and before Harry could say “wait!” she bent over and plucked it off the ground.
“Doesn’t it?” Harry sat back and fixed the group with a level stare. “Voldemort has no problem killing anyone who isn’t useful to his cause whether they be fighting against him or sacrificing their lives for him. He killed my parents, he’s trying to kill me, and anyone who followed him would have to be crazy to think he wouldn’t do the same to any one of them.”
His hands trailed lightly down the spines of the books in the secrecy charms section of the library, but he’d been reading up for weeks and there was nothing on how to break a Fidelius anywhere. He paused at the end of the row. The library was practically empty at this hour, and there was one last place he could check.
“I just thought I’d see if you wanted company for dinner,” she replied, hovering by the door. “My father and I used to have dinner together every Sunday, so it occurred to me you might be missing your family.”
“So Peeves stole Dumbledore’s Deluminator and removed every light from the castle on the night of the Christmas feast?” asked Harry, his cheeks red from laughing so hard.
“So he and Lucius re-wrote the history. Scratched out all the muggle alliances, even covered up some of their more sizable investments in muggle businesses. I assume you’ve looked at the books, so this is probably old news to you. But then things got a little hairy when it became clear that this new guy, this ‘Dark Lord,’ was after personal immortality and soul magic over some of these lofty ideals he’d been touting. Once there was talk of a new world order, only the fanatics were still the true followers. The rest were locked in out of fear.”
“We’ve got to be careful,” said Harry, taking a step over the threshold and raising the invisibility cloak. “If anything happened like the damage the ring caused, I wouldn’t be able to help.”
“Merely postulating on the difference between day and night,” said the bard. “Night, she benefits from secrecy, but is plagued by solitude. She would much rather be Day, where others may revel in her beauty, but she fears her secrets laid bare.”
“It’s not looking good, Harry,” called Cedric as he strained to hold the shield. “We need to get out of here. They’ll decimate us if they tip the scales much farther.”
“I agree,” said Draco, glaring across the room at Hermione and Cedric. “Maybe the two of you should take some time to get your stories straight.”
Draco’s jaw dropped, which Pansy apparently took as immediate confirmation of the fact and not pure abject horror. Of all the secrets she might have guessed, this was not the one he had in mind. He struggled to find the words.
Draco turned to the last page where there was a list of about a dozen names signed in a dark reddish brown. Most names were not familiar at first glance, though the third name on the list caught his eye as the signature had a line running through it. Rodolphus Lestrange.
“He’s all yours, Pansy,” said Draco, quickly adopting his usual cavalier facade and throwing a trademark grin in her direction. “Professor Snape and I were just finishing an extremely compelling conversation on the best way to draw blood from a bloodstone.” He could feel Snape shift behind him. “But anyway, I’m off to the Quidditch pitch for practice.”
“Or teach seven years of magic in four weeks?” said Draco, flipping the book shut with force. “A task you yourself said was impossible.”
Draco looked back around at him. His aristocratic features were creased with worry far too heavy for someone his age. He opened his mouth to speak.
He tried to force his concern for Harry and the rest of the group out of his mind, and found himself wondering about Tonks instead.
“That’s not just any chess set, Harry,” said Hermione, crossing the room in a few quick steps. “That’s a wizard’s chess set!”
“I told her she doesn’t have to,” said Harry, heading to the corner where they always held their Legilimency sessions.
“No,” she said again, more confidently now. “I couldn’t think of it, Albus. It’s more than just fame getting to his head. There are a million reasons we shouldn’t leave him here. These people are vicious, to say the least. I’ve seen the way they treat others and I’ve only been here a matter of hours.”
The first was Charlotte, walking on her own but her eyes were glazed over, unseeing. Draco knew in an instant this was the effect of a heavy Imperius Curse. The second, the man who controlled her, was Blaise.
Massive thanks again to my beta, Honeybeet, who asks all the right questions and gives me the encouragement I need to keep at it. Thanks as well to my friends M & E, who do not even ship this, but read each chapter diligently and lovingly. And to my roomie, Z, who provided all the good golf and tarot knowledge. You guys are the best!
“Alright, Saint Potter, I’ll bite,” said Draco, stepping closer to him. “What would you have me do?”
The figure of Albus Dumbledore reached into his pocket (surely he had not travelled all this way with a baby in his robes?) and pulled out his Deluminator, darkening the street lamps before approaching the garden wall where she was perched. He sat down slowly and deliberately, keeping his eyes fixed over the quiet lawns of the neighbouring houses.
“Diggory, tell us what’s happened so we know what to give you,” said Draco in a clipped, clinical tone. “Was it poison?”
His logical brain knew he needed time to process this, maybe time to grieve, but the hum of magic coursing through his fingertips told him otherwise. The only thing that would bring him resolution was to act.
McGonagall came to an abrupt halt, looking at Harry like she hardly recognised him. “Well, Mr Malfoy, it appears as though Potter has explained enough for the both of you,” she said, blinking between the two.
“I’m sure he did,” said Draco. Four other heads in the room snapped in his direction, but instead of continuing he kept his attention fixed on the small snake, depositing her on a nearby stack of books.
Harry’s breath caught in his chest as he watched the boys roving around the park, looking behind trees and picnic tables, when one particularly rotund boy spotted Harry’s bushes. Harry was about to make another run for it when a brown tweed shape obscured his view. An old man had come to sit on the park bench, appearing out of nowhere.
“Ugh! I’m having just the best time. I love you guys so much,” said Angelica, bouncing in place. “Hopefully, we’ll be able to see each other again soon. Otherwise, I’m sure we’ll see you all at our wedding next year!”
And if Dumbledore was this involved in Potter’s life, it changed things. Here in this trunk lay the keys to the Dark Lord’s undoing. Draco’s hands twitched as the thought crossed his mind that he ought to hit it with a
“No, I’m sick of holding my tongue,” said Hermione, shoving Cedric’s hand off and taking a step towards the couches. “The rest of you may have had stars in your eyes for Mr Perfect, but I for one have seen right through you from the beginning. Why don’t you tell the truth for once, Malfoy. You’re not even here to help Harry, are you?”
Nearly every Slytherin was present in the common room, whispered conversations hissing through the air as the boys entered the room, close to hundreds of eyes fixed on Harry.
"Fuck you're beautiful," Harry gasped and practically attacked Draco's throat, fisting the blond hair to keep Draco's head steady. He sucked and then bit down.
His attention was turned away at the sound of the floo, roaring from the fireplace. Quickly untangling himself from Draco, Harry climbed out of bed, threw on his robe, and walked over to the fireplace.
He blinked his eyes in surprise, then again. Harry stared back at him silently. Draco couldn't help wondering if maybe he was just hearing things. "I-I-I beg your pardon-"
Draco's only scrape of relief at the memory of the tale, with an exaggerated neighbor putting the yapping dog out of everyone's misery. And Lupin. Unlike his partner, he looked just as uncomfortable being there as Draco and Harry were. And rewarded said-partner with a hard elbow to the side Draco was pleased to see turned that canary-chewing grin into a pained grimace.
Of all the animals, all the creatures the Champions could compete against, the idiots conducting the tournament had to pick dragons.
When Severus's back was turned, Harry attended to the note. Unfolding the paper, he saw Draco had drawn Harry on his broom, his head target practice for incoming balls. Underneath the drawing, Draco wrote
"If you gentlemen are done," McGonagall said, tapping Ron on the shoulder with a rolled-up paper before gesturing him to join the others. "Follow me."
Besides, he had a good feeling most of those couples were huddled with their friends in their dorms, their common rooms, gossiping over the Slytherin love triangle.
Harry was released from the intense lip lock and barely managed to catch his breath, loud pants being squeezed from his lungs. Draco laid underneath him, his eyes glowing silver and his chest heaving up and down – clearly he was as affected as Harry was and that pleased the dark haired boy.
"I don't know whether I want to tear the pretty dress off you and have my wicked ways with you. In very creative ways." Harry whimpered, fists clenched to his fists, as his mind was assaulted by a stream of images of those creative ways, with him in very creative positions. "Or have my wicked ways with you in that dress."
"And more importantly, I'll be right there with you every step of the way." He leaned in and pressed a soft kiss against his forehead.
Fair warning, this chapter will contain some maturish scenes. Just giving you a headsup. Also asking for prayer since tomorrow I'm taking my second to last final, which is gonna kill me.
It was a slow progress but everyday in small ways and large his best friend was coming back to him. There were times when he'd fall into sudden silence, which sometimes lasted minutes, sometimes lasted longer. There were times when he'd leave the room to be alone with his thoughts. But he was talking again. He was answering questions, asking some of his own, and participating. Best of all, if those silent moments were too much for him, he'd seek Draco out, and he was more than happy to distract his friend from those dark moments or wade it out with him.
A loud whistle blew from the train, a message to all students and family that it was time for departure.
Warmth didn't just blossom inside him. It didn't flow through his body. It didn't curl in his stomach. It exploded inside him, bursting like a firestorm of fire that licked every cell in his body, reached every corner of his body.
"Oh my…" Harry heard Hermione mutter behind him. He didn't even need to turn around to know that Ron's jaw practically hit the ground, sensing his shock that was billowing out like fumes.
In DADA class, it took everything Harry had not to give into the great, dark urge burning inside him and hex the ugly toad into a pile of dust. Or swing his fist over and over again until the teeth to that nauseatingly sweet smile of hers were knocked out- a look that might would have actually be an improvement from her current state. It was a struggle though, but he managed not to do it.
With the remains of his tattered, mangled heart completely torn to shreds, Harry turned away from Draco and buried his face against Sirius's chest, keeping it there.
Sirius gave the man a pleasantly-dark smile. "I'd be careful where you shot the venom, Amos. Skeeter learned the hard way that the critics carry quite a bite." He bared his teeth.
Draco returned the frown with a chilled smile. "Granger, you are aware you're the only one who likes hearing yourself talk. Meaning, there's no need for you to keep at it."
"I know things, Malfoy. Just like my mom knows things. Thanks to my grandfather who was there to see certain things," A mad glint sparked in his eyes. "Including witnessing every accused Death Eater that came in and pleaded their innocence before the Jury. Like your snake of a father."
"Harry, no." She moved onto his lap, hands cupping his face. "It's not that. I do want another baby."
"Whatever you say, Draco." Harry rolled his eyes, then paid close attention to Draco's shoulder. Or what was behind it. A smile curved his lips. "Hagrid."
"More…" He tried to think of a word that would best sum up the strange feelings and one clever enough that didn't make him sound like an idiot. Sadly, his mind couldn't could come up with the right word. "More… tingly."
That was when Harry saw them. Dementors, close to a hundred of them, gliding in a mass of black, around the lake, inching closer towards them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides. Fog was starting to cloud his vision. An unsettling ring blared in his ears. More dementors were coming out, appearing from the shadows, at every possible corner, closing in on them.
Harry sped on, starting around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; gardens of weed, rocks that were shaped like homes, and grindylows floating around, baring their teeth at him. More merpeople came out, flanked by his left and right, spears clutched in their hands, their mouths twisted into cold smiles as they lend their voices to the haunting song.
A soft smile curved Remus's lips. "A pleasant memory but still not strong. Not nearly as strong enough."
"Draco?" Harry slowly sat up in the bed, peeling himself from the duvet cocoon that was starting to feel more like a straight-jacket.
The stroking stilled but the thumb remained where it was. Draco's eyes slowly moved from his mouth to his eyes. Harry had no idea how close they were till he felt Draco's cool breath brushing against his skin.
The name didn't ring any bells, but it didn't make the vague familiar feeling go away. It had to be an ingredient Severus talked to them about. During Potions class or maybe even before Harry and Draco came to Hogwarts, back when they were learning the basics about magic and were getting private lessons from him.
He should have been ticked off by the smell of powder Harry was peppering his arm with. It wasn't until Draco heard the "magical" words did he begin to realize what Harry was up to. By the time he caught up, he was at the boy's mercy, getting the life tickled out of him.
Thanking her, Harry set the book down on a desk and flipped through the pages, skimming through the passages. One of the pages showed a picture of the flower. It was like a dozen or so mini, deep-lavender flowers stringed together to make one big flower.
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. "I'd hardly call wetting your pants, sticking your wand in the oaf's nose, and getting caught helping, Weasley."
The statement was taken in by a brisk, unreadable look. Severus leaned back into his chair, let out a heavy breath, and stared at the fireplace.
A complete disgusting, nauseating, irksome cockroach the general population (about a good 95%) wanted to stomp on after their reputations were tarnished by her articles. A cockroach Draco himself wanted to squash with the heel of his shoe after reading one too many of her articles targeting Father, trying to make him into some sort of evil, power-hungry villain.
He'd never forget the time Harry learned that lesson first-hand at one of Mother's favorite restaurants in Paris. When the food had been brought in, Harry eagerly dove into his dish.
"No. I mean yes. I mean-" Draco grabbed his arm and held on tight. "I-I just…I do wanna eat." He cringed again as those words left his mouth. Another symptom to hangovers: voicing out verbal stupidity. "And then…then,"
Harry wished it could be that simple. "You know we can't. Not now. Your parents won't let us. Not when…." Not when an alleged madman was after him.
His father rose his wand hand, the tip glowing silvery-white. Draco was there in an instant, tossing the wand aside and grabbing his wrist.
Students quickly parted to the left and right as the front doors opened with the four Champions gliding into the room, filed in a single line, arms linked with their dates. Delacour led the group, a living goddess incarnate in a thin-strapped, silver dress that sparkled underneath the beaming lights. Her escort was a seventh-year Ravenclaw who wore a blindingly-bright grin as if he were the luckiest guy in the world.
"I must admit I am impressed," Father went on, settling more into his chair, crossing one leg over the other. "I'd even call it a whole new record."
It took Harry a minute to read the letter. It only took him ten seconds to climb up the stairs afterward, crumbling it into a ball he tossed aside.
"Yea," Neville said. "The taste isn't exactly great but it gives you the abilities of a fish and should last enough to help you."
Truth be told, as odd it was, Draco honestly didn't want to go back. Though the house was smaller than any room he was used to, though winter was especially freezing at night, he didn't want to go back. His best friend had finally broken free of his stoic trance, allowing Draco in. He had finally spoken to him, and it amazed Draco how one could a miss hearing a sound after a long period of time. Also he liked the coziness of the small house and the warmth Harry's body provided for him.
He learned that life wasn't fair. It wasn't as wonderful and bright like the story-books portrayed it. It wasn't as great as he originally believed; going by his father's philosophy that life was just for those born for greatness, particularly those lucky enough to be born a Malfoy.
Harry rolled over to the other side, irritation and mortification stinging his cheeks. Seconds later, he felt a set of arms wrapped around his waist and a pointy chin nuzzled against his hair.
Defeated, Harry looked out the window, watching splashes of orange and pink streak across the sky. It was almost morning. It wouldn't be long before the others woke up and discovered he was gone.
He couldn't pull away. He couldn't even if he wanted to. His eyes were drawn to the boy just as they were when Harry was removing his layers of shirts and he caught a peek of bare, pale skin. The ache grew bigger in his chest, the heat burnt hotter, his breathing became heavier.
Draco's mouth-and possibly his stomach-dropped as his wide, disbelieving eyes took note of the lack of harnesses they had on.
The wet, desperate hacking from McLaggen's throat was such a fascinating sound. His hopeless struggling was a delightful show. Truly delight, with the tips of his fingers darkening to charcoal as he continued to struggle against the burning rosary, the bruises on his neck growing to the size of a baby fist.
He did, but left off the part about his stench. Draco could feel his eyes watering being so close to the man.
…Nisa awarded him with another kiss, more thorough than the one she gave him earlier. Wolf-calls and whistles sounded all around, galling to their deaf ears as they lost themselves in temporary bliss.
Harry actually was grateful to Cedric for coming up and giving him the hint about the bath. Time in the prefects' bathroom, lounging in the large porcelain tub helped him forget about what happened. Until he came back to the room and Draco somehow smelled Cedric's scent on him, implying something else went on between them other than exchanged tips.
Frantic. Wild. Desperate, clashing with every collision, every meeting of their tongues. Feeding into the heat that grew.
"I-um-" Harry dropped his hands and pulled back. Draco had no choice but to take back his hand that was already missing the sweet warmth. "I better get back to Luna."
The moment the word "flustered" left his best friend's fascinating lips, Draco felt the blood rushing to his face, coloring his cheeks. For the millionth time he wished his skin color wasn't so fair. "I'm fine," he said, though the words sounded weak even to his ears. He cleared his throat and pasted a smile on his face, one that became more genuine as Harry returned it. "Just glad second year's over."
Attempting to breathe through her throat that was clogged, her chest that was tight, Nisa covered that soft hand with her own and kissed her thumb. "Aria."
Music to his ears. Draco's senses, his mind, his body, all of them hummed as if he drunk the most incredible champagne and was floating, feeling so happy and nice and warm. He pressed himself more against Harry, nearly piling all of his weight onto him. How he made it through this summer living in different continents with letters to make up for lack of physical contact, he had no idea. How he managed to sleep without his favorite pillow was a mystery. How he survived without his best friend by his side was unbearable. What he did know, though, was that this would be the last summer such a thing would ever happen. "Never again."
If Harry didn't think the man was mad before, he was now fully convinced. He also saw that his hatred for Muggles and the prophecy weren't the only cause of his downfall.
The next picture was of his mother climbing up the stairs, arms full of books, dark red twisted into a messy bun. She rolled her bright green eyes when she realized she was being photographed, gifting the camera the finger as she passed by.
A barely-suppressed snort rose. Eyes narrowing, he looked up at Blaise who was struggling to keep his laughter down. "Something to say, Zabini?"
." Theo smiled innocently at the dark look she sent him. "I only hope I get a front row seat to that show."
"So he is," Aunt Cissa's smile grew as her eyes darted over to Harry. "And you make a fine knight, my dear."
There was a moment of hesitation before feet shuffled, moving slowly towards the door. Harry didn't turn around. His eyes were still locked on the wardrobe, watching it rattle, picturing the dementor creeping inside.
The man in front of him who for years people thought was the Dark Lord's right-hand man and betrayed his parents was actually innocent, just as he claimed. The man behind Harry was a werewolf that lied to him about who he was. The man that was being dragged by the werewolf was the actual traitor that had been masquerading as one of his friend's pet. The man Harry and Draco were holding up with their magic was knocked out because Harry was desperate to know the truth and would have his head as soon as he woke up, which Harry hoped wouldn't be for a
"Not at all. A fool's downfall usually consists of one thing. Yours, on the other hand, consists of several." Blaise listed them off with his fingers. "Pride, which as history has taught countless times, is the ultimate downfall to any man. Alcohol, which is severely underestimated, removing the mask guarding the unconscious mind. And another person, an unfortunate victim, you brought down with you to the post. That's not the making of a fool, Draco. Those are the makings of an idiot."
The arched brow rose higher, decreasing the likelihood of Theo coming out from this little demonstration in one piece. "And you think that I am?" A trick question that would determine whether or not he'll see tomorrow if he answered it wrong.
"Git." Draco repeated in a hiss, flicking his tongue. The boys fell into another mess of giggles. It took even longer for them to catch their breath. Each time one would try to control to control himself, all it would took was a glance into the other's face for him to lost it all over again, laughing twice as hard.
"Well she's my friend, so that makes it my problem." Harry shrugged off his hand and joined the weasel in their hunt to track down the witch.
Draco felt his face curdling as if he tasted a sour lemon. He pushed back the unpleasantness and focused only on the pleasant. Like how beautiful the snow looked outside and how much they'd enjoy it later on. Like the fact it was Christmas, one of his favorite holidays, and the tree Harry insisted they add to the room was packed with so many presents just begging to be opened. Like how peaceful Harry looked sleeping beside him.
It was no secret that Dumbledore trusted the Malfoys as much as they trusted him, which was less than little. Harry still remembered how stunned the Headmaster was when Aunt Cissa was named as his guardian. He remembered the small conversation he had with Uncle Lucius that quickly went from chilly to downright cold in a matter of seconds.
….His hips rocked against Harry's warm, pliant body twice more before he flung his head back with a cry. It was explosive, whiting out his vision, searing Harry's scent, the feel of Harry against him into his memory, into his very cells.
It took almost five whole seconds for Harry to look at him. His cheeks were two bright splotches of red. As bad was it, Draco was happy to see he wasn't the only one suffering. "So…"
He found himself pushed backwards, clothes gone into a warm bed. She came to him, her slip bunched to her waist, her chest bare. He touched every bit of free skin he could reach. He tried to capture every morsel of sweetness he could suck from her lips.
The train delay didn't damper than excitement for the first-years eagerly awaiting sorting. A majority of them were split into Gryffindor or Hufflepuff with Ravenclaw gaining ten more ravens and Slytherin eight new snakes. After the sorting was done and the choir performance of a haunting tone that matched the darkness of the storm blowing outside, Dumbledore stepped forward.
Bare hands. He was going to strangle Pansy with his bare hands and enjoy every second of her struggling.
There were a few more pictures of his parents. More of their Slytherin friends, including a funny picture of Pansy shoving Theo into the snowman they built while they were too busy trying to keep themselves up, practically dying from their laughter. However, most of the pictures were of him and Draco. Pictures from this vacation and past vacations. Pictures of them at Hogwarts, going back to first-year, including one of them waving at the camera, big grins on their faces. Pictures of life before Hogwarts, highlights of their childhood. Racing each other on their toy-brooms in the sky and on foot in Aunt Cissa's gardens. Building an army of snowmen. Engaging in intense snowball fights, hitting each other with dozens of snowballs. A shot of them huddled together in bed, arms wrapped around each other, looking completely content, like they wouldn't move for the world. Another of them camped out in their blanket and pillow fort with a large book laid out in front of them, with six year old Draco using his finger to follow along with the passage of the page while Harry paid close to what he was saying.
Harry chewed on the feather to help him think about then wrote down the first thing that came to mind.
The idea of his solemn uncle dressed in a bright color, a startling shade of pink, was so surreal Harry had to bite his tongue to hold in his laughter.
"Usually," Father said. "I find public displays distasteful. However, given circumstances, I suppose expectations can be made."
, Draco concluded with a frown. Granger was a nuisance but at this point it was common knowledge. Besides she wasn't worth his attention. What was, however, was the fact she was there, Weasley was there, the rest of his friends were there, but he didn't see Harry anywhere.
A family portrait taken last Christmas. Lucius seated on a silver chair that was designed as a throne. Narcissa by his right, hand on his shoulder. Draco by Lucius's left, Harry by her left. The two teens managed to keep their faces neutral as they stared straight, but a shared glance caused bits of mischief to slip through the cracks, their smiles small but warm with affection, eyes bright.
"Well," She choked out the word when no one came to her aid. "Well…I can see I'm going to be overruled. I'll say this. Dumbledore must have had his reasons-"
Draco refused to part so easily, at least not without making an impression. He pulled Harry close to him, buried his face in Harry's neck, and pressed a swift, sharp bite right there.
It was like drinking iron, searing-hot iron that burnt his throat as it went down. Hard to take in, hard to keep in. He nearly spat out the first sip.
"Dumbledore has informed me of your-" Severus paused, seemingly searching for a word. "ailment. Hopefully this batch will be able to sustain you for the time-being."
Harry said so himself that was he returning the day after his birthday. Draco was getting anxious. He knew it. His parents knew it,too, judging by his father's scowl that deepened with his pacing and his mother smiling. Even the simple-minded house-elves knew it.
Platform 9 ¾ buzzed with noise. Loud laughter bursting from friends reunited after months apart, hugging and jumping on each other, talking excitedly about the new school year. Pets rattling in their cages, banging against the bars. Parents smothering their kids with hugs and kisses, repeating over and over that they'll be missed, to write every day, to be on their best behavior. Porters carrying suitcases and caged pets onto the train.
To ease the tension from the wand-shop, Father took them to the pet shop, getting them both owls. Harry's was the color of fresh snow he named Hedwig while Draco's pick was an eagle owl with piercing eyes. Afterward they stopped for lunch at one of Draco's favorite spots, then over to the ice-cream parlor for dessert, where Father treated them to large sundaes.
Despite his anger of having the truth hidden from him for so long, a twinge of sympathy went off in Harry's chest. He wondered how many of those looks Remus had to endure over the years.
Leave it to annoying Gryffindors to cut through his thoughts and remind him why he rarely ventured to their dorms.
He wanted to knock that stupid, smug smile off her face. He wanted not only to see her knocked off her high horse but wanted to watch the tumble on the way down. Wanted to remind her she was insignificant. What was a more perfect way than reminding her of her lower-than-low, dirty blood status?
Fuming, Draco blocked Harry from her view as he stood in front of her. "No one asked for your opinion," he spat. "You filthy little
He expected Harry to respond, but heard nothing. He turned around. He broke away from the group and rushed over to the Gryffindors that the House Perfect was having a hard time organizing, over to Weasley.
"I'm gonna make you pay, Potter." Harry tried to wiggle free but Draco was persistent, holding his arms tightly. Harry tilted his hips, trying to shift Draco's heavy weight, and Draco felt heat shot straight to his lower region, burning through his body like a flame. Harry stilled, his chest rising and eyes widening, startled by the scorch just as he was.
To get through the new wall created between them, they talked. Talked so much, making up for the months of silence. Talked more freely, more openly than they have in quite a long while-possibly in years.
Underneath the sheets, Draco heard the whisk of the wand and the murmured chant, but refused to look up. It wasn't until he felt the blankets and pillows pushing forward, entangling around his body, lifting him up from the bed that he began to wake up.
Harry was still with the two Gryffindors, talking among themselves. There was nothing unusual about the sight, but it caused sharp needles to prick into his heart and stomach, especially as he saw how they smiled at Harry, like he was already one of them, and how Harry returned the smile with the same warmth.
Draco was a slightly better condition, despite being only in his trousers and inner shirt, losing the tunic along the way of their tryst tumbling. Without taking his eyes away from Harry's eyes, Draco gave him that slow, wolfish smile that made heated fingers stroke lazily against the pit of Harry's stomach while moving backwards to the couch. He peeled off the white undershirt and dropped it to the ground before he sat down, arms spreading over the top, legs crossed in front.
"Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa request the young masters' presence immediately," he said. "It's urgent."
For a moment Draco thought Goyle was talking about them till he saw what the other boy was pointing to.
