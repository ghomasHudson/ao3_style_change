“She’s always been like that.”
Harry sneered.
“We’re your
He gestured vaguely. He hated this. He hated realizing that there were lasting influences from being raised by the Dursleys that he still hadn’t managed to shed. Whenever he thought he must have escaped, little things would show up and betray him. They would be habits or aspects of what he considered knowledge that it had never occurred to him to question or trace to their source. Like how when they were younger he used to stow away food from the feast, until Hermione caught him at it and forced him to explain why. Or like this moment when once again her keen eyes were trained on him and he had to fight his sudden, violent distaste for Dean and Seamus because the
Harry dragged a jar on the edge of his table towards him, popped the lid open and took a handful of the white sand inside. He let it run through his fingers into the cauldron. Malfoy didn’t go away.
Thanks to Morphine again for betaing, I've changed the ending of this chapter since you read it, but I hope you still approve.
Potter kicked off his shoes. He took off his glasses and placed them on the table next to the probably useless book on dementors.
Draco is holding himself rigidly, Harry must be able to feel how tense he is. His hold on Draco’s arm is loose, he could pull away if he wanted to, but he doesn’t. And Draco knows he has to ask, even if he can feel his throat closing up around the words, even if he doesn’t want to know.
Harry hesitated. He didn't want to.
“We’ll be two hours at most. Do you think you can finish the runes in that time?”
He poured himself a glass of water, drained it and then headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He did need to sleep. Despite his best efforts to avoid it, he had ended up with a morning shift, and if he didn't get at least seven hours he would definitely end up murdering someone before he was halfway through the day.
Harry turned and saw Draco disengaging from a flock of Slytherins. He came towards them, his luggage hovering obediently behind him.
Malfoy turned to him with a blank stare.
“You’ve made mistakes, Draco. And those mistakes have had consequences, but
“There might not be much of a mind left in him, but I could try and see what’s there?”
Harry shook his head.
Harry looked away, willing himself not to say anything sharp about "the role he played".
“Why are you up here?” Potter shot back at him, the second of embarrassment already passed.
“I can’t extend it that far.”
Ron’s eyes already had a glazed look. Harry leaned closer to him.
“Are you coming, Harry?”
He climbs off the bed, stands up, straightens his shirt. He’s looking anywhere but at Draco.
Malfoy hesitated. He looked back at Harry and the silence stretched between them, brittle and awkward. Harry noticed for the first time the way Malfoy had curled in on himself, how tense his shoulders seemed, and the answer was right there on his face. That it hadn't been a joke. Eight years of hatred seemed to hang suspended in the air, and Harry saw Draco's fingers curl seemingly unconsciously around the left sleeve of his coat. Then a car rushed past them on the street, bright headlights flashing over them, and the stillness broke. They both looked away quickly.
"If you've got a wand, why aren't you using magic? To light your cigarette," he added, when Malfoy just looked puzzled. "Or to boil water."
“We could call it something else, and maybe it could be more like a duelling club. I know we can’t use the room of requirement anymore, but it wouldn’t have to be a secret, so maybe we could talk to professor Jenkins or professor McGonagall about it.”
“It’s not about my father – I don’t care about him, he’s gone, it’s that place. It has to be destroyed.”
“I uh… I was looking for you,” said Pansy. “I thought you might be up here and… well, I didn’t think anyone… that he would be here. Too.”
“You know, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but that actually makes a lot of sense.”
. Honestly Ron, that was all we did.”
“No, there’s a voice that speaks inside your head,” he said, though calling it a voice didn’t seem exactly right – when he tried to recall his sorting, he remembered how the words had appeared in his mind without bothering to pass through his ears first. “It kept saying I would do well in Slytherin, but Ron had already told me that it was the evil house, so I kept thinking that I didn’t want to go there and instead it put me in Gryffindor.”
I know very well that Draco is
The footsteps came to a stop and Harry hesitantly raised his head to see who had come to see him. It was a tall man wearing a black turban and black drapings, decorated with wine red adornments.
He had known the poison was in the air even before he entered, but he hadn’t cared. It had been a long time since he cared about himself being a casualty. He wanted to just catch the other wizard so he couldn’t hurt anyone else.
“So, so, my son. That I certainly don’t hope for. You are still meaning to marry Draco, are you not?”
“I, what?” the man drawled, clearly not seeing who Harry truly was. Quickly, Harry came up with a reply to save the moment.
to serve until someone wishes them to be free. You are trapped within your own powers, Jafar. It’s over!”
“I want to.”
“Uh… I was just thinking… maybe… you’d like to become a genie? To be able to grant any wish?”
~THE END~
He was still crying when he felt the carpet stop. He was still crying, hiding his face in his hands, when the carpet rolled him down onto a protrusion of the caves stone walls. He was still crying when he heard a very worried chatter and felt a hesitant pat on his shoulder by a very small hand. And then he was crying of fear and relief instead of fear and grief, all the while hugging his best friend closely to his chest. Then he was hugging the magic carpet, and they were all hugging each other, but he didn’t stop crying. Not until the fire burned out beneath them.
“It’s like a whole new world!” Draco exclaimed, and Harry could only agree. Yet, Harry wasn’t only looking at the scenery around them; he was watching the man beside him.
Ron was lying, surely. Draco didn’t care about him. Besides, it couldn’t be true, he hadn’t been dead for
“Oh, that,” he said. “I believe… that I’ve found that, as well. I found it in you.”
He waited until the other man had stopped singing before letting him know of his presence.
(See the end of the chapter for
I end my monologuing there, knowing that throwing a curse mid sentence is the only way I can catch him off guard. I let the hate I have for him fill me up and I shout out the words.
It lasted half a year. Then he died again. And he simply didn’t let himself wake up again, because he had failed. He betrayed him. He didn’t deserve the happiness he had started to feel by Draco’s side the past months. So he chose the right thing; to leave him behind.
“May I kiss you, the way I’ve dreamed of before?” He asks, and I nod even before he has finished the sentence.
Stuff like… Ron Weasley… he’s, if it’s possible, even more infuriating than Potter. And mostly because of his height. I have always known that he is tall, but it was easy to ignore before, when he also was very gangly. He didn’t fit his height. But he does now. He’s just the right amount of chubby, and his crooked smile softens his sometimes hard facial features. And, Merlin save us all, he has even grown into suiting his fiery red hair! It kind of reminds me how his older brother – what’s his name? Oh, yeah, Charlie – looks when he’s among his beloved dragons. He looks content, certain with himself and… alive. Exactly like his hair, then.
Harry’s expression darkened slightly, but he still answered. “No, I didn’t. My friends had learned how to sleep through them when we still were at Hogwarts and before that… no one cared enough about my wellbeing. So I’m making sure Al never feels that way. But I’m not sure I’m succeeding.”
“But…” Harry cut in. “I won’t be sultan, right? That’ll be Draco…?”
“I actually don’t know.” Genie answered. “First thing I was minding my own business in the lamp and the next I’m summoned by you, but you were unconscious and drowning in the sea and I’m sorry but I had to use one of your wishes to save you.”
Dear bloody Merlin, Gryffindors are a menace. I am currently sitting in the Eighth Year’s Common Room, trying to busy myself with ordering Christmas presents for my friends and family. It has proven quite difficult to do though, as all around me, my Gryffindor year-mates are jumping around, celebrating something – what, I don’t really know. After all, I
In one of the corners of the room, a stool was placed. Right now, that chair was occupied by one wary-looking monkey.
“I’ll do it!” Harry exclaimed without hesitation. “I have three wishes, right? So I can just use two of them for anything I want and then I’ll use my last one to set you free.”
I admire how he’s accepted me. He didn’t know about our relationship before the accident. He didn’t know about me being part of Harry’s life at all before he found me broken in a hospital corridor while the mediwix performed their best to keep Harry alive.
“Yes… but… what about the other dream you have?” Draco asked, “the one that mostly was a memory?”
And the dreams he spoke of were full of wisdom, and Harry felt like he could listen to his tales forever, even though he’d never know who the man really was. He had humour and cared about other people in a way that was very similar to how Harry operated with the people he met in the streets. The longer Harry watched this man, taking in the smooth white skin and silver eyes that he could make out under the hood, and listened to his voice, the more his heart ached. He
I know she hasn’t given up on him, she has just never been very strong when it comes to emotions. Her forte isn’t feelings, because they can’t be tamed by logic, by the mind.
? Also, please believe me:
“Yeah, you see those wristbands? They’re actually magical handcuffs that bonds me to the lamp, and by that, to whoever temporarily frees me from it. But even then, I’m still bound to the lamp. The only way I can be truly free is if my master uses one of their wishes to make me free.”
known that. He had expected Draco to just walk back to his life and let Harry return to his. With wide eyes he looked at Draco, who peered back at him with a slight blush, before placing a sweet peck on Harry’s cheek.
“But Harry doesn’t.”
“Perhaps you’d like to hear the tale?”
With each word I come closer and closer to him. I grip my wand tighter, clench my jaw only to force it to relax so I can keep talking.
The three friends flew as fast as they possibly could over the dunes, across the desert. The wind whacked Harry in the face but he didn’t care. All that mattered was coming back to Agrabah and Draco as soon as possible. Even though they were far away from the municipality, Harry could see the dark, ominous clouds that floated above the palace. Must they not be too late.
He hated himself for it. He saved the world, he was the youngest Commander Auror ever, he was the Chosen One, and he couldn’t even handle a bunch of spiders.
They couldn’t do it. When they approached the opening, the man who had escorted Harry showed up and blocked their path. He demanded Harry to hand him the lamp, or he wouldn’t let them out. Naturally, Harry had given it to him without hesitation, but it helped him in no way. Instead of getting out of the way, the man just took the lamp and stood tall, not moving away at all. He pulled forwards a golden staff with the shape of a snake, its eyes made out of two shining scarlet gems. As he thrust it forwards, a wave of power came through and it pushed Harry, Abu and the carpet back into the cave. The unexpected action caught Harry off-guard and he found himself falling off the mat.
“Yes but first… where is Abu?”
The hurt that cut through Draco’s heart at these news were completely unaccounted for and Draco quickly sped out of the room to hide in his quarters and let himself cry out the pain without anyone watching.
His voice grew more silent with every second as his aching heart made it hard to get the words out. Instead, he tried to communicate what he meant by action. He raised his hand to let it trail the shape of Draco’s jawline, his touch as frail as a butterfly’s colourful wings. And Draco leaned into the touch. He was finally free to do whatever he wanted, nothing to stop him from seeing the world. Yet, there was nothing he wanted to see unless Harry was by his side. So, he chose to just enjoy the moment, enjoy the presence of Harry letting his love wash over Draco’s soul.
that!”
“Hey, Ron! Come on, let’s go out and play in the snow.” I am about to decline when he adds, “We can build an igloo! We can make it big enough for all of us to fit and then we can sleep outside tonight.”
“I told you,” I answer easily. “To talk.”
He didn’t answer because he couldn’t lie to Draco. And if he answered, he knew his words would be lies. He couldn’t promise that.
Just then someone else kneels beside me. Though I can’t turn my head to see who it is due to too much pain, I soon realise that it’s Granger who starts to murmur healing spells.
“What are you doing?!” he half shouts as soon as the door is locked behind us and I have put up a silencing charm. “Why’d you bring me here?!”
Harry sighed and nodded. He had known that.
“What? What were you talking about?” Ron asks, already having forgotten about his dramatic problems with Seamus and Dean’s love life.
“So… welcome to my place…” Harry mumbled before moving the fabric to the side, clearing a path through which the man could enter the ‘house.’
“I know, I know but… I KNOW! You can make me into a prince!”
Prince Harry — fabulous he — Harry Ababwa”
Then they were off.
Draco quickly went back into his room and called on his pet tiger, Rajah. Together, the two of them made their way to where Harry was. As Draco walked towards Harry, he sent Rajah off to find Jafar and make sure that the older man couldn’t spy on them.
Spring wasn’t a time for new beginnings and rebirth anymore. It’s a time to lose those you love the most.
Potter regards me with a piercing stare that makes my skin prickle, but I don’t break our eye contact. Then he nods and grunts. “Fine. Talk.”
That was the only thing he regretted, making Draco hurt like this. But he also knew the hurt would pass, that Draco would be better off without him.
Lost in thought, the man didn’t notice the large man that approached him on his right side until the man was over him and snatched his small, black and gold leather bag.
Harry slides one of the silver bands onto my finger. I put the other one on his, smiling as I can feel warmth even in his fingertips.
“Yes! I’ll do it. That’s my first wish. Genie, I wish to be a prince!”
As I had predicted, Draco’s jealousy instantly kicks in. “You will do no such thing,
“Aah, hi there Abu. You alright, buddy?” he greeted the monkey who swiftly climbed up to sit on Harry’s shoulder.
“Uh, I don’t think I’m powerful enough to do that, because that’d mean I need to change the past, but I can however make you
Harry was in the middle of a conversation with a salesman, while Abu was taking a couple of oranges behind his back, when the shouts further down the street drew his interest. As he turned away from the sales stand, the marketer turned around as  well… just in time to see Abu jumping onto the stand’s roof, arms full of fruits.
“Yeah sure, old man, you know as well as I do that I don’t stand a chance against you in a boxing match. I had another idea in mind.” Harry took an effortless jump towards the man only to then dodge back and manuouver to the guard. Swiftly, he drew the sword from its sheath, and turned back to his opponent. “I was thinking you and I could have a little fencing match.”
“You…
“Dra– Malfoy? Why do we need to talk about Malfoy?”
“Yes, sir, now, I demand you to let this go as well as giving me an answer. Who. Ordered. Harry. To. Be. Arrested?”
Perhaps it’s good that they aren’t apart very much anymore, because if Draco and I are together on our own more than we are now, I would most certainly go completely bonkers. Every other sentence he utters is about what Potter said earlier or whatever kind of secret date they are going on in the upcoming weekend. Strangely enough though, I’ve found that I very often start to smile to myself whenever Draco gets on with one of his rants. I don’t have to listen to every word, because the liveliness in his voice is enough on it’s own to bring me joy. And it gives me time to think about other stuff.
At last, the stairs leading up to the entrance became visible, but something about them seemed wrong. When they got closer, Harry realised why. They were falling apart. Giant holes in the sand showed them to be extremely frail and anyone who’d try to take a step on the was obviously mental.
Where the caravan camels roam
“Yes, of course.”
obvious that Ron Weasley doesn’t have a clue what’s going on. Neither does any of the others in our dorm, which isn’t very strange, really, since they both have been really good at hiding their relationship. Even from me, before the start of the month. And if they managed to hide it from me, maybe it isn’t too surprising that Ron doesn’t know either.
together.”
Each breath began to hurt, the foul air frying his trachea, eating is lungs. He welcomed the pain. He stopped trembling. He didn’t know if it was because his body couldn’t move anymore, that he was incapacitated, or if he just... let everything go. Let the darkness embrace him.
“Don’t say that! You might accidentally use up your last wish! And you promised you would use it to set Genie free.”
At first, it worked, they got inside the palace without encountering any of the patrolling guards, and they quickly ran through the rooms to find the evil sorcerer. He was in the main hall, proudly residing on the throne while watching Lucius clean the room, and Draco was sitting on the floor beside him, holding out a tray of fruits for Jafar to eat. Draco was bound to chains that were attached to Jafar’s wrist, causing Jafar to control every move Draco made. Maybe it was jealousy, maybe it was the wish for vengeance of maybe it was just a sense of justice that made anger boil inside Harry at the sight.

This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware!

had gotten inside his clothes. I stare up at the sky. The snow is still falling softly around us, as it has done all day. With only our soft breathing and some whispers in the air, the atmosphere feels gentle and safe. I close my eyes. Let the moment be for a while. Then I turn around to lie on my stomach and open my eyes to look over my friends. My gaze lingers on Blaise for a moment, but I quickly move on before certain thoughts get the chance to manifest in my head. Then it stops again when I see Harry.
“It’s none of your business, Riff Raff, now get out of the way!” another guard spat.
He was back. Back where it all started, where his pain did nothing to save the lifeless body of his older schoolmate. Back where the voice he hated became constant in his life. He was back in the first moment he blamed himself for someone’s death.
doing here?!” Draco shouts as loudly as he can, though his voice breaks a bit. I turn back again.
“Hi, there,” he smiled to it. “I’m Harry, and this is my best friend, Abu.”
after all.
“I know how that feels,” the man cut in, surprising Harry. “I… I come from a place where… freedom really isn’t a thing. All I ever wanted was to get out of the walls surrounding me, get out and explore the world.”
“Alright, I’ll give you that one,” he said while shaking his head. “But you won’t be that lucky next time. Now, what do you wish for?”
had I only been faster. But it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that you–”
Though the ride was quite long, it still wasn’t quite long enough. Harry found that the rush of flying was a better relief than anything he’d ever done before — even better than jumping down from rooftops and between houses — and the carpet turned out to be excellent company to keep Harry and Abu’s excitement on top. Harry would’ve loved to just stay in the cave, flying with Abu and Carpet forever. But he remembered the promise he had made the man above the cave, and he was determined to fulfill that quest.
“Yes, it’s exactly that obvious!” The two of them share a look, before Draco promptly stands up from his armchair and they leave the room together. Naturally, everyone misses the quick peck Potter puts on Draco’s cheek, because they are too busy watching me die of embarrassment. Those bloody lucky bastards.
I plan to ask him to stay with me, but as my mind and mouth really doesn’t want to cooperate today, what comes out instead is, “Protect me.”
Slightly frightened by, but mostly curious of the small man wearing a blue tunic and a white turban, you take a step back from him, but keep your attention on what he is going to say next. Naturally, he notices your interest and he turns directly to you.
, and they left Draco standing in the doorway with his mouth hanging wide open as they started up the movie.
You feel quite offended by his demand to invade your personal space and decide to repay him by stepping upon his feet.
I introduce you to the world of Hogwarts Eighth Year, seen through the eyes of Blaise Zabini, and the discovery of the first of the pairings.
Yes. Smiling, because I love him, and I’m not on my own anymore.
“Father,” Draco called out, “please don’t. Come here. He’ll hurt you.”
In the dining hall all the other Death Eaters are assembled around the grand table, The Dark Lord sat on the very end of it. He turns to me when I enter.
And Harry understood. The old man that once had helped him to survive was the man who now stood before him. He had never been a true genie, but simply a guardian angel who looked out for Harry. An angel who had taken the form of a guarding genie when Harry had needed it. Harry nodded approvingly towards the man, hoping it was enough for the time being as a thanks for everything. Then he turned to face Draco and Lucius while Genie got to work with wishing Jafar’s oil lamp to disappear from all who wished to find it.
“What’s gonna happen to him?” the man asked, nodding towards Harry.
Naturally, the monkey didn’t listen. Instead, he jumped onto Harry’s shoulder and the two sped off down the street — towards the tumult Harry had heard a few moments earlier and away from the swearing salesman.
Now, Harry was sitting beside a fountain in the back garden, petting Abu while contemplating how to solve this mess. Both Carpet and Genie were expressing how they thought Harry should just go to Draco and be himself, and Harry could understand why. The only problem was that if he did that, he wouldn’t be able to get close to Draco — he would be thrown out of the palace before even getting a glimpse of the prince.
“Wait! Don’t go!” the man shouts. “I can see you’re only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, that you’d be the most rewarded to consider this.”
“There,” the small man continues, “Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment.
Time goes by, but I don’t know how much. Maybe it’s mere minutes, maybe it’s whole days. I have no clue really. But it doesn’t matter. Because I have made up my mind. Harry Potter had been my last hope. He had been my life line, my ticket out of this hell. He was the one that was supposed to fix this. And he was gone.
Ah! You're gonna love this guy!
“Alright, it’s your choice to believe it or not, I guess. But let me tell you. The story about this lamp is true, and you’re loss to not buy it.”
“What is this?” he asked, daring to test his luck by voicing this question.
Harry could see Genie whooshing through the crowds, and he could hear him making commentary to woo the people into noticing different parts of his parade as extraordinaire. And then he heard him compliment Harry himself, causing him to blush tremendously. He wasn’t exactly used to hear nice words in the context of describing
“No… but… do I know you?”
And once again thanks to
Hesitantly, he went to the glassdoors of his room and sneaked a look out over the garden. Down by Draco’s favourite fountain he could see the prince, sitting with a defeated posture while talking to the man by his side and… Abu! It
“Harry Potter, we have come to arrest you on behalf of a royal order,” one of the guards growled.
“’M sorry My Lord, the Boy Who Lived tricked me. When I got down to his cell he pretended to be dead. When I went to check his pulse, he attacked me. But he was weak. I merely threw a
“I… it’s not–”
“Say: "Hey!
“Not really,” Harry answered earnestly. “It’s not like I have acted and eaten through a proper meal before.”
One of Lestrange’s curses.
For Prince Harry!”
I’m no good on my own. But there’s perfection when I’m with him.
“Draco, wait–” I start, but my friend is already at the door across the room and he leaves without looking back once.
Trumpets played fanfares and girls danced in front of Harry as he watched the people of his town look out of their windows.
“Won’t do that, twat. Only way you’re getting out of here is by me escorting you away. And I won’t let you do that until you’ve given me my saber back.”
“I hardly see why it’s relevant for you to know my name, Harry,” the man mumbled.
“Hmpf, justice. And unless you move along, you’re gonna get a piece of that as well.”
Chancing a glance upwards, I catch sight of Ron who is now standing
The day had already displayed several surprises for Draco, so perhaps he shouldn’t have been that surprised when he was woken up by a small pair of hands, gently shaking him. But he was. Because it wasn’t Scorpius pale hands that shook him, and it wasn’t a question of a glass of water that brought this to happen. It was Albus Potter that stood beside his bed, and he was crying. Tears slowly streamed down his colored cheeks, and to be honest, that scared Draco a bit.
“Yes! Finally, someone here who knows how to help!” Jafar’s deep voice rang through the room. “Genie, I wish for you to make me the most powerful genie in the world!”
Before my thoughts get the chance to run away with me (again), I hear Seamus call my name.
He had entered the Palace trying to act as he thought royals acted. He had asked to see Prince Draco, had explained his mission was to ask him to marry him. It was as he had been talking about this that Draco had arrived, and he heard only the part about the marriage. He didn’t hear the part where Harry explained that he had met Draco once before, and that he hadn’t been able to think about anything but that meeting since. He had explained that with every second that went by had him falling deeper in love with him. But Draco only heard the question about marriage, and then he stormed out of the room.
. I really should get better friends.
“Just a little snack guys… and my name isn’t ‘street rat’, it’s Harry!” the boy shouted back nonchalantly before jumping onto a rooftop and speeding away from the scene.
Then came spring.
A tad reluctantly, I do raise my gaze from his body and let myself finally watch his face, bracing myself against whatever sort of rejection I will see in his blue eyes. Except, it isn’t there. Instead I’m met with a blinding smile, and I take in a sharp breath.
The sky was a dull blue, dimmed by the high heat that was the result of the sun shining brightly on the sandy ground. Any wise man would make sure to keep still for the time being, spare the energy for later activities and draw back to the shade and stay at ease. And most people did so. Imagine the surprise these people felt when a young boy clad in ragged clothing suddenly burst through the street, followed by angry shouts of ‘Stop him!’, ‘Thief!’ and ‘Riff Raff!’ coming from a swarm of palace guards. Though this did make a lot of villagers peek out of their homes, it didn’t help the guards to catch the boy — he was out of reach before anyone had realised what was going on.
“You’d really do that?”
“I… don’t know, sir,” Genie stammered.
“Yes, father I have,” Draco said, “but —”
[trigger warning for under cut: suicide]
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Potter mutters.
. Why is that?”
But now that he thought back on it, he realised that he had recognized the voice of the prince. It had been Harry. But that didn’t make any sense, because Harry was no prince and Jafar had said that Harry was… dead. Yet, Draco was sure that the voice had been the one belonging to the young man that had saved him two days before.
Harry looked at the man the entire time he was speaking, drinking in the looks of his soft lips forming the words, the muscles in his face working to show expressions. He was beautiful. Inside and out. Dear Allah, Harry was in trouble.
do. I can’t make someone fall in love with you.”
Goodnight Draco. 💚
marry you, ever!”
Suddenly, the shouted insults are drowned out by a loud crash. The boy had run up a pile of wooden boxes, and in the rush accidentally sent a barrel falling onto the guards.
He was back. Back where it all started, in the cupboard. Back where shouts about him being lazy echoed through a townhouse simultaneously as he heaved up what little food he had eaten previously in the morning. Back when he was sick and he was told it was his own fault.
“I already know,” Lucius interrupted. “Jafar accidentally told me in one of his grand monologues. About how he had gotten rid of the diamond in the rough, the street rat that pretended to be royalty:Harry Potter.”
. How you’re studying and talking and…
“He told me I died,” he muttered.
experience, and there are times that it hurts too much for him, but at least he is not broken. And he is as whole as anyone could be after going through that. And I think that you should acknowledge that. You should go talk to him. Get to know him. Leave all of that stupid rivalry behind you and maybe try to become his friend. He might not say it, but I know that he wants it, he wants to be with you. And Salazar knows he deserves that. And–”
! How can I do that?”
“Yo, Weasley!” Malfoy shouts. “No time for daydreaming. You can’t just lay off and expect the rest of us to do all the work!”
?” he asked. “And I’m sorry too. I know what you heard and it was wrong of me to say that. But… I thought that was how royalty spoke…”
I can see that obviously, Draco is trying his hardest to look bored, uninterested, in all that’s happening, but the small tinge of pink on his cheeks proves that he’s not completely focused on the snow falling outside. I smile lightly to myself. Who would’ve thought that someone like
“Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place
“Why wouldn’t he– why wouldn’t you let me stay that way?”
What  met him upon his arrival wasn’t an unusual view per se, but there was one significant difference. There was a large man who had taken possession of a much smaller person who he probably planned to perform his needs on. Only, usually that happened to the petite girls in town. And this person was… well, ‘petite’ certainly was the right word, but ‘girl’ was not. In the hands of the large man was another smaller, hooded man who furiously kicked about, trying to get free.
Ron entered next, broad shoulders, jaw set in a proud stance. Eyes burning equally as much as Draco’s did.
“Me too,” Harry smiled, “Nothing to make me feel trapped anymore.”
He hated himself. No matter how much good he did, how many crimes he stopped, how many criminals he put away, it was never enough. He was never enough. He hadn’t saved them. He failed.
“Checking on you, of course. And apparently, I’m following your
“You did. Again.” Ron said matter-of-factly.
“Yes, but I was asked to be here since your father has something important to tell you, Draco.”
Draco smiled. “Only every hour of every day.”
“Why don’t you go talk to him?” I ask, and laugh when Draco splutters in response.
Then I began to sing. Rarely any words, just melodies that came into my mind, hoping the sounds would bring Harry back.
“Thank you,” he whispered through tears and the widest smile Harry had ever seen. “Thank you so much, Harry. You truly are a diamond.”
Soon after, he heard the rustling of Abu following him. The monkey once again took its place on Harry’s shoulder.
Potter blushes. He’s quite cute when he does that. Takes away the killed-an-Evil-Dark-Lord-vibe a bit.
As Harry had ran to follow Draco, he stumbled into a man. A man which he recognised immediately. It was the man who had brought him to the Cave of Wonders and then thrown him to his death!
“I’m sure you’ll be fine. Just do what I do and no one will know. Now let’s go and meet him.“
I can’t bear it either, but I’d rather watch him like this for the rest of my life than not see him at all.
On the second anniversary of that first night, Draco knelt down in front of Harry and asked him to share his last name. Harry didn’t get to answer, because all the kids in the house; James, Lily, Scorpius and Albus shouted it out for him:
The salty tears spread over his tongue as he kissed Draco’s cheek, his jawline. The taste lingered as he moved to kiss Draco’s throat. The taste lingered even after they both came, chasing each other to the end of the universe. The taste lingered even after Draco fell asleep, crawled up against his side, face hidden in the crook of his neck.
Fred.
Startled, the man turned to look at him. “What are you doing here?”
“How dare you set your foot in here, you blasphemer!”
“I know that it was supposed to be your mission, My Lord, to kill the famous Harry Potter. But I swear upon my pride that it could not be helped.”
job these days,” a very familiar, and very annoying voice barks from close behind me, and I jump in surprise. Stupid
Remus.
“What happened?” Harry asked.
“You can’t! There’s nothing you can do. He made me make him into the most powerful sorcerer in the world! I couldn’t do anything about it and neither can you! You should try to escape with your life while you still can.
He hasn’t questioned me once.
I cast an eye over the crowd still in the room. They are all still laughing and playing around as if nothing has happened. Except for Potter. Potter is standing still, as if struck by lightning, exactly in the same spot he was before. He hasn’t moved at all and he is visibly very confused by what just happened. I sigh and rise from the chair.
Harry stopped him before he could say anything else by whispering ‘not now’ into his ear. Draco nodded a short almost nonexistent nod.
“No, you’re not,” Genie cut in. “You are a hero and a diamond. You are no longer just a diamond in the rough; you’ve gone past that. And I promise that you’ll be just fine. Do you trust me?”
I know it’s unfair, Harry didn’t want to leave me, and he hasn’t really left. He hasn’t given up. He’s fighting to get back. But the fact is, he isn’t here with me right now. Not really. I’m on my own, despite all the people helping me, trying to hold me upright. I’m all on my own.
“Yes. You are the one that got me out of the lamp, and so I am required to grant you three wishes, just like any other genie.”
It’s snowing, the ground is covered with thick layers of white dust, but I don’t mind. Snow is nice. Snow covers up. It makes it a little bit easier to live through the pain. The pain. It’s hard to think of the few weeks left until Christmas, because… the pain. Who would ever have thought that Christmas, the one holiday I have always loved, would come to hurt me this much? The pain.
“I know, Draco, I know. But I thought he needed some cheering up. After all, he had just realised that his most trusted man had betrayed him. And I think
has ever asked me that. But it’s an easy question. There’s only one dream I’d ever want to come true. I want to be free.”
Ron comes by at least once every day. He can’t stay very long most times, too much to do as a single dad since he and Hermione got divorced. But sometimes he stays the entire afternoon. He doesn’t talk, but his presence is somehow more consoling in silence than it would’ve if he tried to comfort me.
I clench my fist firmly around my wand – the wand that I would’ve willingly given to Harry had he been alive – and I march up the stairs, away from the dungeons. Away from his body. Away from my saviour, towards the voices of my nightmares.
“You better ask him about it. He’s the one that found you. He’s the one that spent months searching for the right spells and potions. He’s the one that preserved you, kept you safe. He’s the one that reached out to me when he couldn’t cast the spells because he couldn’t stand losing you. That’s not something you do to someone who’s just your partner.”
“What?” the man exclaims. “It is no fairytale. It is a true story!”
“Actually, I don’t have to do anything. You have trapped yourself in this, you see. Because when you became a genie, the prescription came with a side note, but I don’t suppose you read that, did you? This is how it is: A genie can only grant the wishes of others. A genie can only obey its master, not itself. A genie is
The man, who was walking next to Harry, once again looked bewildered at Harry. “Me? What would I wish for? In all my years as a genie,
“It’s probably for the best you spoke up Molly, with all this talk at the Ministry about raising the majority age. Making your guardianship of Harry clear was probably a wise decision.”
Harry chuckled. “It’s a chair.”
Rey rolled his eyes. “Yeah, the power and birthrights that almost destroyed them. I don’t think you’re really seeing the whole picture.”
Draco looked up at her as if she was nuts, “of course not, he didn’t play. He just watched. I did it, with my play wand.”
Judge Fumeurs nodded tiredly. “It is so noted Madam Healer. Please continue with a brief summary of the young man’s health.”
“I thought he wanted me but not enough to fight Dumbledore for me.”
Tawy leaned against a corner of the practice room. There was no way she was packing herself in with the ‘audience’. She hoped the masses would get bored and leave but she doubted it. There was just too much interest in Harry and Draco right now, the media couldn’t seem to get enough of them. The population’s interest had been fanned into flames and her staff was not immune. If she banned viewing, there’d only be speculation and rumors. More rumors and mystery were not something Harry and Draco needed. The only thing she could do was dim the observation room’s glass and make it harder for those in the room to see all those gawking.
Harry chuckled beneath his breath, while Draco rolled his eyes. “Must not be Hogwarts. They’re made of tougher stuff.”
Mandy smirked. “Yeah, you don’t really hide it well. Violet thought you were flinching at the prices not the fabric. I got an idea.”
“Teddy,” Siri smiled, “we need to go back.”

year, no matter how they have to work it. So, with that in mind,”
Draco looked at her steadily, his own mother could be said to have a potion addiction. At times Draco thought he wouldn’t mind having one for himself.
Ben believed it. He’d been freaked out since that lunch. When that kid said he could hold the curse. Ben knew he hadn’t been lying. He’d been torn between questioning and staying away from them ever since.
Harry stood from the bench and stretched, popping his back and rotating his neck.
Tawy sat the furthest away. She found a chair and sank into it with a sigh. Molly’s greeting had been gracious but cold, which was expected. She was relieved that coldness hadn’t been extended to Draco, only decorum that once turned away, seemed to melt into pure interest on Molly’s side. Tawy didn’t notice at first, her attention taken up by Percy Weasley, who insisted in reintroducing himself and speaking about the new ministry. So, it wasn’t until Tawy saw her stand that she paid attention. Ginny didn’t sound angry when she requested to speak with Harry alone, which Harry granted, though he looked anxious and not quite happy to do so. Draco even less so. The glare Ginny twitched towards Draco told her that Ginny might be a problem. It seemed, from what Harry had revealed to her, that Ginny had been much more invested in their relationship than Harry had been. Though Tawy didn’t think Harry had been aware of that.
“I never said that.” He was genuinely confused, “I said we wouldn’t work. That my life was too crazy and chaotic. Ginny that hasn’t really changed.”
Tawy had been at her job more than twice the time the Malfoy boy had been alive and usually she was able to keep a level of distance from her charges. She cared about every child put before her, how could she not? But something about the Malfoy boy pulled at her heartstrings a little harder than most. She thought maybe she was still tender from caring over the Potter boy, who had about broken her heart, but she put the idea aside. Draco was a heartbreaker all on his own.
Ginny scowled and glared Harry’s way as she walked back and forth. She’d been waiting for this moment for a while, “don’t you have something to say?” She questioned, hoping to hear some justification.
He took a deep drink of port and shook his head. The Ministry had always been fools and this time… well he wished the Ministry luck in the endeavor.
Draco grabbed his wrist before Harry could even finish standing. Harry scowled at Draco as the blonde shook his head. “Wait Potter. You can get righteous in a moment.”
Murphy raised a hand, “enough Mandy. They did. Tawy agreed that’s exactly what they did. Now we need to move on.”
“I don’t think they’ll let me in here,” Violet whispered.
Knock-knock
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Really?”
Molly sagged a little into her chair, “Do you think she’d take them from the school?”
Mandy seemed thoughtful, “there’s this girl on the floor above us. Serious cutter, she always gets a hold of a knife. They have no idea how she does it, but as soon as they take one, she has another.”
Hermione looked up to him, he nodded his head towards the door. She followed his nod to see Pansy and Blaise entering and frowned herself. They’d had to do the whole thing without them and their say-so over Malfoy. They’d had to practically throw Harry and Malfoy’s relationship in everyone’s face several times to back everyone off and it hadn’t been fun. “Let’s go see where they’ve been hiding.”
Draco smiled at his hands. “I could.”
hphphphp
“Andromeda told me about it, can you imagine?” Molly’s face twisted with a scowl, “that woman was to be looking after them and this happens. Ridiculous.” She looked down to her tea cup, turning it left and right for a few moments, before she said quietly to it. “I know Harry and Ginny had broken up but I had thought, you know, perhaps, maybe they would reconnect this year.” She sighed sadly and shook her head, “But now he’s gone and tied himself to the Malfoy boy. I had no idea, just none. All Harry did was rant about that boy. He was ob,” Molly stopped abruptly, her eyes wide, “oh,” the word puffed from her lips.
Violet took a deep breath. “Thanks for breaking it down Mandy. So if wizards see them?”
HPHPHP
“We’ll check and see if the cabs here. Give you both a minute.” Mandy said, opening the door.
Neville grinned, “Bloody hell, good on Harry.” He raised his half-empty mug in a prideful salute, “I’m glad he got his man.”
They went to the library. Harry couldn’t think of anywhere else. The media room was always packed and all the muggle stuff in there made Draco nervous at the best of times, same with the game room. Their room was too small, too filled with the reminder that they were far from everyone they knew and not leaving anytime soon. So in lieu of a potion’s lab the library was the best he could do. Harry went to their regular table, regular in the way that it was hidden and slightly dark and they’d never seen anyone else sit there. Draco sat heavily next to him.
Draco scoffed, “One of many mistakes. At least this one hasn’t nearly killed me. You watch this hair will cause me problems yet.”
“Goodnight,” they echoed after her.
Draco must have felt the same because he shifted over without a smart word. They sat next to each other for several minutes of silence.
Draco nodded, “I am. I was born at the manor and our family’s private physician has always seen to me there.”
Teddy shook his head with a small grin and a chuckle, “You guys have no idea, do you?”
Harry didn’t say much during group and Draco said less. Harry felt sure Murphy was trying to stay on ‘safe’ topics for their return. He did notice Mandy, beside him, hadn’t moved her chair away from him. Beside Draco, Ella hadn’t move either. He wondered what that meant. After group, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to make a quick getaway.
Ron laughed and nudged her, mostly playfully and kind-a for a moment wished they could’ve worked it out.
She nodded as Malfoy dismissed her and she shivered at his controlled menace.
group.” Harry announced.
Harry approached and looked down with Draco, both watching as Draco’s long pale fingers turned and twisted the dagger. Draco glanced up at him, “should we wait or do it now?”
“I have to leave early. My sisters visiting early cause of her work schedule.”
Judge Fumeurs nodded and waved for him to sit back down, “alright then, first things first.” He picked up a parchment. “Let us proceed with the new charges leveled against the defendants.”
“Now that we’re all here, let’s get started.” Murphy glanced around the group, “anyone have anything they want to start with?”
“I would like a copy of the custody decree.” Molly announced, perhaps in looking it over they could find a loophole or a measure of comfort.
After a few breaths, Harry jogged over to Draco, laughter bursting from him. “That was so much fun. We’re doing that again!”
Belinda nodded, “Well I’m afraid I can’t tell you anything else. Perhaps Madame Malfoy.”
He tried to shove the last of his stuff into his truck. While Sev and Siri might have been apologetic about it, Teddy really didn’t mind going directly to the school.  It might have been a mob scene if anyone recognized them anyway and this way they could plan to meet with their friends out of the spotlight.  Teddy shoved and then sat on his trunk. He might need to ask Sev to help. Sev could pack anything.
Ron nodded and sighed at the change in Charlie’s tone at the Malfoy part of the sentence. “Give Draco a break Charlie. Harry loves the guy, like loves him. I’ve never seen Harry get anything he truly wants so don’t throw mud at it, right?”
Normally the Grand Wizengamot would have been led by the Minister of Magic. However, since he was so new to the post and had been in the field during the action, it had been decided the highest court would be led by a senior Judge. This allowed Shacklebolt to speak for the prosecution when he was needed.
Hermione looked down the table, towards George, who hadn’t looked up from his paper. Feeling   her eyes, he lifted his head. “The Ministry took Harry and now the papers are all claiming he’s off making best mates with the Malfoy kid. Someone official fed that line to them, they’re all repeating it. We aren’t allowed to know where Harry is or what they’re even doing to him. Therapy? We’re all in group therapy through Hogwarts, why they couldn’t go there? We know Harry and at least understand that Malfoy kid. We’re more likely to help them than anyone.”
“Yo-gert?” Draco kept eating.
Draco smiled a real smile, lacking everything but joy, “I don’t know. I didn’t plan on living through it.”
“Yes.”
Murphy blinked and turned red. “Ah yes, I had forgotten that. Sorry Harry.”
“Yes, yes, we could, that’s, thank you.”
Tawy sighed, “He was too scared to.” She ducked down to meet his eyes, “Draco, are there any other potions you’re sensitive too or any other reactions?”
Tawy folded her hands on her lap. “Right now, you’re both still minors and we’ve spoken about the guardianship remaining in place.”
Violet followed her with a sad backwards glance. She shut the door behind her, determined not to ask, though the curiosity ate at her. The cab wasn’t there yet.
Harry scowled while Draco gritted his teeth, neither said anything.
Ron was on the alert the moment Harry stepped out of sight. He wasn’t going to let his brothers bully the love of Harry’s life no matter who he was.
Next to him, Draco huffed still unsure, but Harry leaned forward. “You want answers to whatever questions you have fine. Get us stoned and we’ll answer them.”
“I like your hair.” Harry almost reached out to touch a lock but didn’t.
as all this sitting and waiting serenely while the courts held them up was nerve-racking. His mother was so still beside him, though sometimes she would stroke a lock of his hair. His father was at the small table speaking lowly with their head solicitor.
“You’ll go?” Mandy hadn’t been sure if it was the right thing to do but seeing how excited they were she felt pretty good about it.
Draco blinked rapidly, refusing to let the tears gather, “thank you.”
He picked up the fine golden chain from his desk. He’d gone above and beyond on this little piece of work. Narcissa’s blood had been the final piece and getting the blood of wizard without their knowledge even between them had been neigh impossible. However, it was now done.
“Woh.” Ben looked around, “What? That’s serious shit.”
Violet chuckled and then turned, “oh my, they are causing a tad bit of excitement, aren’t they?”
be staying in your room.” He was tired of being spoken over.
The women scurried after him.
Tawy found that hard to believe. The building was still standing after all. She looked to Murphy, “Here.” She took off her necklace, “this will allow you to grab the boys’ wands from my desk. Quickly.”
“And it isn’t too crazy and chaotic for Malfoy?”
Draco laid on Harry’s bed and exhaled with a surprised chuckle as Harry pushed him down and straddled his hips. Harry leaned over him, bangs hanging down and Draco tugged on a dark lock. Harry studied him for a moment before he said, “Do you not want to go back?”
Hermione gathered the parchments off the table, around her other 8
be able to repay him and he
His eyes widened, “I didn’t think, I mean, in group. They say such shocking things.”
“It’s a game,” Draco replied, still tense.
Mandy raised a hand. “Believe me not a problem, they’re powerful, like scary powerful. I don’t know that they even need the wands really. I think they just use them for show. Whatever else Violet, they can take care of themselves, so if something happens, get to safety. They’ll be fine.”
Draco had always thought he’d be overjoyed to be known as ‘powerful’. Someone different, someone to be ‘feared’ but he found reality left a bitter taste in his mouth. ‘Different’ was something he no longer wished to be. It certainly didn’t make him better. He’d had his fill of it, alone, hiding in his closet while madness reined around him. He didn’t want to be feared or hated or anything really, but perhaps forgotten. Change had been hard for him, some lessons so excruciating he couldn’t even function half the time. Going back to who he’d been was impossible even if he’d wanted to. He heard Harry pronounce the article nothing and maybe the other’s believed him, but Draco heard the tremor in his voice and felt him lean closer. This wasn’t nothing. He missed Uncle Sev more than ever. Draco was certain he’d know what to do.
Vos (though Harry remembered he preferred Bear) walked closely behind Malfoy until they reached Tawy at the forefront of the Judge’s bench. On one side, Andromeda stood from her seat as she stared at Draco. On the other, Narcissa covered her month with a discrete hand, though her whisper of “Dragon” seemed to carry.
“You’re asking someone, who is a parseltongue, whether it’s evil trait.” Draco announced dryly, “How’s he supposed to answer that?”
“They aren’t normal kids Murphy. They’ve never been normal. For the last couple of years they’ve been living weapons. They need the groups they’re in, let them stay.”
HPHPHPH
Draco set the soda down and smoothly took the paper from Harry’s slack hand. He read it over quickly. He thought momentarily before pushing the paper onto Harry, “read it.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “If I cut out all the people in my life, who have directly or indirectly tried to kill me, I wouldn’t have anyone.”
“Thank you.”
Finally, it was the Slytherin who took pity on him, “They’re in love.”
“When did he learn to dance like that?” Hermione replied.
“I’m just glad the Ministry didn’t put up a fuss about us taking Harry in.” Molly announced.
Tawy smiled warmly. “I’m glad to hear it.” She turned, “Draco?”
Partially down the article Neville heard Pansy chant ‘no’ beneath her breath. She turned her head away, blinked rapidly, before she turned back with fury. “I’m going to sue this rag to the ground the moment Killsmen gets back.”
Draco scoffed. He doubted he’d enjoy meeting anyone. He glanced up and saw Potter looking rather non-pulsed by the idea as well.
Tawy laughed. “Very well then.”
“And sometimes, when they didn’t want her worthless ass, she’d sell me to get them.” She seemed to be bragging about it. Daring them to say something.
Rey shook his head. “Bad idea.”
Harry had frozen once he’d wrapped his arms around the other boy. He didn’t hug people, but as Draco relaxed so did Harry. “I know it will help.” Harry said with conviction as he leaned back and finished the new braid just as there was a knock on the door. Harry had barely called out before Tawy looked around the door.
Harry shrugged, while Draco nodded.
“Mandy,” Ella started but obviously didn’t know what to say.
Harry stiffened and looked around. He recognized that voice from their group. They were at a table on the other side of one the nearer bookshelves. At first, he couldn’t see where they were, but then he caught a glimpse of black hair. He found if he leaned back and then moved over a little, because Draco shoved him, they could see the table through a narrow space between two book shelves.
Healer Kelly nodded. “Thank you.”
Harry shook his head, “Ginny, I told you we weren’t meant to be together. You asked and I said no, I thought I was very clear.”
Harry glanced at Narcissa in time to see her react with a sharp movement paused by Lucius’ hand. He leaned over and murmured softly to her.
Mandy, as well as everyone else, made noises of surprise and curiosity. Healer Kelly didn’t answer their questions, but sent them out the door, “directly to your rooms please.”
Draco frowned in thought. “Very and so are you.”
Tawy sighed, “I have a feeling I won’t like this answer, who?”
Mandy nodded, “Yeah.” She looked around, but it looked like while everyone had stuck around they were waiting for her to explain. “Not forever but for a night.”
Blaise raised an eyebrow, “I thought that would be a lot harder.”
She waved him off and when he stepped closer, she pulled away from his comfort. “No, it’s alright Harry,” she turned away tears welling up in her eyes, “just go back down. I need a minute.”
Draco shrugged her hand off, “I’m fine Mother, really.”
“I can’t give them anymore,” He whispered down to Harry, “I have to take what I’ve got left and try to make something new. Something worthy of your love.”
Then she started in on her unmovable plans for the future and he remembered why he’d gotten out while he could.
Draco shared his first concerned look with Harry as he walked in. The room immediately put him at ease. Unlike the rest of the place, this room would fit right into the manor. It was a luxurious room with dark wood walls and thick rugs over the fine floor. Shelving covered each wall, holding wondrous feats of magical enterprises, more of the same floated around the room. There was a large dark desk that even his father would have treasured, the chair behind it was dragon leather covered. To the left of the door, a sofa and two chairs, covered with looked like the softest navy leather, the lush rug underneath matched.
Violet measured them. “Alright.” She looked them over with a smile. “I’m guessing the shops first.” She looked around them. “You didn’t bring anything?”
“Here.” Clara stood up, from where she’d sat silently in the back, she skated around Ben and Mandy, who tried to stop her. “Here.” Clare offered him the lit joint.
“Well?”
She seemed impressed and Hermione blushed, “This just makes me so angry.”
“Out of all the students, the two of them always had the oddest reactions to things. One could never tell what might set them off.”
“No Tawy,” Harry answered.
Teddy nodded. “I knew and love you anyway. You’re my family no matter what names you use.”
“We need to send an owl Potter,”
Bear nodded and both men left to start on their part of the plan, next to Tawy, Helen straightened. “I’ll go grab the first batch of potions. We might as well get them in him before he’s awake enough to really taste them.”
“Just when he hasn’t had his wand, mostly.” Draco answered.
Tawy nodded, “I think I have the fix for that,” she pulled a purple potion from the table, “in fact let’s start with that one, open up dear.”
Neville could help but ask, “It doesn’t seem like either of you have aged a day.” Neville thought they looked even younger without the whole world on their shoulders.
George nodded.
Draco looked like he was going to be sick. “Are you serious?”
Ella giggled. “I’d stare at both but yeah I could question Potter. All the papers say him and Ginny are over.”
Hermione nodded and returned her attention to the mess before them. They’d all volunteered to help the Headmistress. Mostly able to do very well, but setting up their own housing arrangements was proving to be harder than most things. It was one of the last things to complete as well. The school was repaired, cleaned, and nearing the final preparations. She glanced around their new common room. It was lovely, even if she did say so herself, as she’d done much of the work once given the room. It held a bold, but classy mix, of house colors and comfortable furniture. The excitement swelled within her. She couldn’t wait to immerse into school life again.
They eyed each for a few moments, sharing a nod and then Harry struck, and the game was on.
The one in the lead waved a parchment as he stormed forth. “Senior Judge Fumeurs! We have an injunction.”
Harry brought Draco a little closer. “Like leave here?”
Harry looked up and couldn’t believe it, “Romilda?”
Harry looked to Draco, who shrugged. Harry didn’t know who they’d contact.
Harry nodded anyway and she accepted it with another sad farewell to him.
Harry scoffed, “how kind of you.” He got up and stretched, his body stiff for some reason, “here,” he offered a hand down to Draco.
“Doubtful. There they’ll just fear you less and stalk you more. You are the Victor of a war after all. Not to mention the first years.”
Silence was the answer as they looked among themselves.
The solicitor spoke about a prearranged fine that the court had signed off on. It turned out the Malfoy’s had signed over to the Ministry a personal gold mine that produced nearly a million gallons a year, the public was astounded. The solicitor gave a small speech about how the Malfoy’s were, from their own generosity, paying more than any other family due to their genuine want to help out those harmed by the war. People whispered in shocked but pleased tones.
Harry avoided Hermione’s hands and jumped off the table. Hermione and Ron started to get up but Harry waved them off. He looked around the room, noting how people wouldn’t meet his eyes and how pale and horrified they looked. At the door he shook his head, “I can’t believe I fucking died for you people.” He slipped through the door.
Ron shrugged, “Harry’s claimed him as a soulmate or some shite, so yeah, he’s mine too. Piss off.” He said it with such casual protective ferociousness that everyone acquiesced before they really understood what he’d said.
Harry shook his head. “It’s weird, it’s like she cares about every little thing we do and wants to talk about it.”
“Master?”
Sev shook his head with a smirk, “It certainly wasn’t. You’d gotten that letter if you lived in Antarctica, but that’s not the question here, is it?”
Just then Draco walked by, holding up two backpacks, “which do you prefer Harry? We’ll need something to put our stuff in.”
They walked from castle together, “not so fast,” Neville admonished, “we want them to see us coming.”
“Your godfathers?” Ella looked around her, “we never,”
“What? Damn Rey what?” Mandy barked. Ben looked to him.
Harry frowned, hating to be caught out and not sure what to say. “Ah,”
Ron choked on his pint. Blaise patted him on the back, with distracted precision. Hermione rolled her eyes and Pansy grinned with glee, “Really?”
“I’ve known.” Draco said quietly. “I’ve always known. I could see the difference between how other people treated their children and how my parents treat me.”
“How did my boys do in group?” Tawy sat across from Healer Murphy, smiling hopefully.
Harry smiled down at him, “I wasn’t talking about me. Malfoy has also had the privilege.”
Harry could relate. “My mistakes just kill others.” He brushed his fingers against the scars on his neck. He didn’t think anyone would understand. Didn’t dare share it with anyone, didn’t want to. He wanted to push it so deep he could forget, but he couldn’t forget. It was in his nightmares, every touch he had to endure. “I wanna forget.”
Ron rolled his eyes, nodded his thanks to Zabini for the drink, “I don’t know why we ever broke up. You obviously hold me to such high standards.”
Sev reached across the table and squeezed his hand. All this touching was surprising to Teddy as usually neither of his brothers were very physically affectionate. “It’s probably time we go back and settled things there anyway.”
“Granger writes letters to me?” Draco eyebrow rose, “really?”
years stood talking, mostly about Harry and Malfoy. She was just glad they’d hashed out a working setup. Most weren’t happy but really when it came to Harry very few people had more say than herself and Ron.
They read the paper and she’d expected a lot of responses. Anger, the practice room was open and waiting, maybe tears, maybe demands, something. She’d been ready for nearly everything. Except dull acceptance.
Harry sat back down but didn’t pull his wrist from Draco’s grasp and Draco didn’t release him. Harry thought maybe Draco was preemptively staying ready to stop him from charging over, but Harry didn’t mind.
Bill took the pen with wide eyes, “ah, thanks Draco.”
She laughed as she accepted the joint back, “Oi that answer at least makes sense. How long before you’re off then?”
Harry glanced to Draco, “That’s on us, isn’t it?”
“I’ve always,” Harry started, and Draco elbowed him, “been able to…” he finished weakly and turned to Draco, who rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, cause we’ve been so friendly.” Rey scoffed.
Hermione made semi-loud excuses about showing them the room they’d chosen for Malfoy, but once inside Hermione charmed the door. She looked to Blaise, who shook his head and dropped heavily onto the closest bed. “Blaise?” Blaise waved a hand towards Pansy.
Tawy let them go and they didn’t wait around.
“She does know we’ve been basically raising ourselves for years, right?”
“No, it doesn’t need red and fine, we’ll go to group.”
Harry turned to Mandy as Draco ordered people around as was his nature. “Thank you, he needed this.”
The walls yawned as all felt the presence of immense power, like a wave hovering and waiting to overcome them. Every wizard in the room, who had a wand, went to it as if by unconscious call, all but for Tawy, who raised her clearly empty hands. “No, Harry, that’s not what we’re doing at all.”
Hence it was a strangely different Draco Malfoy (ex. child icon of pure blood ideals) who’s picture was splashed across the wizarding papers, while sneaking into Gringotts. This Draco Malfoy wore Louboutin shoes, dark sunglasses, and a muggle shirt declaring someone Queen.
“Posh Resort? This place?” Rey rolled his eyes, “whatever would we do without the contraband magazines your sister sneaks in for you?”
“Madam Healer,” Judge Fumeurs started but didn’t get to finish as he was interrupted by Andromeda’s head solicitor, who had started gesturing frantically. Judge Fumeurs acknowledged him with a backhanded wave.
Draco stepped through first.
Draco crossed his arms and leaned back against the wall. He was doing his level best to appear unaffected by all of this. He felt uncomfortable under the stare of the new Healer though she wasn’t giving him any dark looks just looking.
Rey’s book was still on his lap, though he wasn’t actively looking at it. “Anyone with a bit of common sense would be afraid of the cruciatus or any of the unforgivables really.”
Tawy nodded, glancing between her auto-med quill as it wrote out the diagnosis and Draco, who was still blinking at the room. “Bring him some of that muggle organic soda-pop, the teenagers love that stuff.”
If Draco had learned one thing over the years it was that Potter did not break a promise. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and squeezed tightly, “That I can do Potter.”
“Like it just flows now, no need to call it, it’s just there waiting. Me too.” Draco paused thoughtfully, “I wonder how long our magic was siphoned for us to feel like this. It had to be a long time, long before the he arose.”
“He’s a fucking Duke!” Mandy spoke loudly, over them all and they all looked to around to see if anyone had noticed her outburst, especially the table across the room. Thankfully Potter and Malfoy weren’t paying them any attention.
“I may have looked through a window of one. Not sure.”
Harry bit off the growl and his anger.
Harry wrapped an arm around his waist and Draco appreciated Harry’s palm, warm and comforting beneath his ribs.
Ella looked strangely interested. “How did you know that?”
Then there was Draco. Harry always loved Draco, always craved his presence, regardless to any other feelings or numbness. However, as much as the ties between them helped him and gave him strength. Sometimes, they guided each other to some very dark places. Places where all he could do was cling onto Draco and hope they pulled each though. Places that without Draco he wouldn’t have wanted to pull though.
Tawy moved away from the desk and towards a door to the side. “Here we go boys, hash it out in here. No magic please and I’ll be right with you.” Harry paused even as Draco stood and she turned back to him. “You’ll be able to say goodbye before we leave.”
“We usually take the tube.”
Draco snorted, “At this point I’m thinking birth was a trigger.”
Once in the hallway, Harry checked his band. “Do you wanna go to the library until we have to go to Healer Tawy?”
“You won’t.” Harry felt sure, but all the same hoped he wasn’t wrong. He wanted to tell Draco he’d always have him but wasn’t sure how that would go over or even how to explain. Harry did know he didn’t want Draco to move away and nearly didn’t let him go when he started to pull back. Harry glanced down to where Draco’s hand stayed in his. He felt something begin to burn in his chest, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. Harry thought it might be hope.
She straightened even further, “I am.”
Until he heard his mother’s voice.
Draco’s smile was bright but fleeting, even as he busied himself, taking longer than he needed and dropping his head to affix the sunglasses back to his shirt.
An undertone of sound spread throughout the area, which quickly fell off again when the solicitor returned, holding the door open behind himself as Andromeda Tonks entered the room.
Tawy nodded and left the topic, “Alright so no muggle toys?” Draco didn’t un-tense as she thought he would, his back remained ridged as he drew a… “Draco what is that?” She watched as he coloured in the cube he’d drawn, small multi-color boxes on the bigger cube.
“And we’re really not in trouble?”
Draco forced himself to try the apple slices he’d chosen.
Molly looked to Tawy as Hermione shrunk Harry’s trunk for him, “Harry is, of course, welcome to stay here while you go to that place.”
They didn’t hear the Healer’s answer as Harry stepped through and the shield snapped close.
“Who?” Neville frowned. This was ridiculous.
Draco shrugged. “I used it because I was supposed to and,” he smirked at his apple, “it pissed Weasley off.”
She nodded. “And his followers?” She didn’t look away from Draco.
“Oh Mandy, you do like to drop me in it.”
The manor was quiet. The screams and raunchy laughter of last night had gone silent hours ago. Draco knew everyone in the manor slept in. He shouldn’t hear any of them for hours. The early morning was the only time he felt somewhat safe. Still he was cautious, as he slipped on silent feet down the hall, eyes wide and watchful. On the wall a vigilant portrait put a finger to her lips and hurried him on with a wave. He nodded to her. Draco wouldn’t have left his room at all, but he needed a book from the library for classwork. Classwork that at this point his mother demanded he do but he figured might never be seen by a professor.
The End.
“She’s fine Harry. The bond?”
Draco moved around him and placed his hand next to Harry’s.
After the chuckles died off, Harry leaned forward, “Has the deluminator lit?”
“And they were just like this when you found them?” The woman glanced to her and then to the boys again.
years. Minerva answered her with as much as they had decided and hoped it was enough.
And the who’s who of wizarding youth was all here. Mandy rolled her eyes, determined not to show any fleck of being any sort of star struck, she pointed.
Harry started losing track of the names by then, and the rest of the people were doomed to remain identity-less faces in his memory.
“Well that’s the only other option, and awful as his parents may be, he is still a child in all of this.”
“Of course you can, I’m just being polite. Cheers.”
“Potter!” he said again. “Get up!”
For a second Potter looked like he had been punched in the face and Draco thought he might try to beat him to death, the loathing in his eyes was so pure. But then his face closed up. He let go of Draco’s wrists and stood up.
“I still remember all the things I did,” he continued, fighting the urge to lean away. “It’s like no matter where I go or what I do, I can always feel that pressure of his hand on my shoulder. His claim on my life. And I’ll never be able to forget how it felt.”
"Who names their kid Gregory?" said the boy on Harry's left.
“Did quite a few wrong things first.”
“Hi,” called Draco.
Ron lowered his voice.
"Draco says you went to school together," said the girl, looking curiously at Harry. "I kind of expected you to be another posh white boy."
," he said, unable to keep the sneer out of his voice. "He was so fucking civil about it, hardly even insulted me
“From the look on his face I’d say he’s thinking the same thing I was.”
, Draco thought.
"Really?" he said, and Draco rolled his eyes again.
Ron grimaced.
“The ones down here aren’t feeding on the prisoners! The prisoners aren’t enough to keep this many of them alive, they would starve or suffocate, like what we’re trying to do to them with the patronus chain – or they would go somewhere else, or if they
Ron snickered.
He was getting to his feet without much elegance.
Harry stepped closer to him.
“Yes,” she said. “Let’s not talk about that part until it becomes relevant, shall we?”
“You know Voldemort was threatening his family, he had no idea what he was doing!”
“Hermione’s right, you’ll be fine,” said Harry. “Ron and I have been giving regular reports on how much of an idiot you’ve been ever since first year, I’m sure by now actually talking to you can only improve their impression.”
“Sure, except for when you stole Luna’s wand after Ginny had won,“ said Ron.
“To elaborate a bit on what I’ve already told you, I’ve been… restructuring my life a bit over the last year. I've moved out of the Manor, found a job, you know, things are going well. So I've had some time to reflect on what happened during our last years of school-”
“The feast,” repeated Potter. “Just, there’s been a lot of… people are excited about Halloween in Gryffindor, so I just asked if, yeah, nothing.”
Potter shrugged.
“I guess we should,” said Draco, straightening up and finally releasing Harry.
“That’s just… the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.”
“Neville, do you think silencing spells are enough?” asked Ginny.
“Cameron Boyle, I think.”
“They saw us,” said Draco. “They recognized you.”
“That sounds unlikely.”
“Of course, as a Malfoy I used to be able to buy whatever I wanted anywhere, but that isn’t the case anymore...”
The door to the guards’ room was closed, but a sliver of light shone out from under it. Draco held his breath when he passed. Harry had stopped, waiting for Draco to show the way, so he went past him and retraced the route the auror had taken all those months ago, forcing himself to believe that he was remembering it correctly. They reached the iron door and he stopped and put a hand against it. He looked back over his shoulder.
“But I can’t rule a country! I’m just a street rat!”
“Well then, Harry, nice to meet you. Oh, hi Rug Man,” the man turned to Carpet. “Haven’t seen you in quite a while, how are you doing?”
“WHAT?!” I shout out in disbelief. Here I was, talking about them just getting to know each other, and… apparently, I’m the one that needs to get to know
“Can’t a man be left alone to die in peace?” He grumbled.
Harry looked confusedly at Genie. “What do you mean?”
“Are you kidding me? I would
“Yes, he does!”
“Because, usually, when he does that, he’ll slip me a note or something to let me know where I can meet him so we can be alone and… talk… and sometimes, you know… fuck… but often we just talk. But he didn’t give me anything this time.”
“It’s fine, Draco. Potter already told me.”
, I find myself feeling small, only because I know that Ron is towering over the rest of us if he’s in the room. And despite it causing me to feel vulnerable, I am drawn to him in a way I can’t explain. I
Smiling into his kiss.
And then they were inside the gates.
On the other end of the street, a new figure made an appearance. A man draped in a heavy cloak. Though it did hide most of him, it didn’t cover everything. It didn’t quite make him look like one of the common people, and the jewellery on his turban, glittering through the shadow of his hood, clearly told that this was someone of a high rank. He was born and raised in this town, yet no one knew him and neither did he know any of his neighbours. He was a stranger in his own town.
The sun had been down for over an hour, and the rising moon found a view of Draco Malfoy sitting on the border of Scorpius’ bed, passionately reading a bedtime story. Tonight, though, the bed wasn’t just occupied by Draco’s only child. There was an additional person sharing Scorpius space: Albus Potter. The two boys' friendship had flourished into something rather beautiful and Draco was more than happy to provide all the comfort he could for them during their sleepovers.
“Yes.” Draco’s father answers simply. “Draco has told me that you have ordered a man arrested without consulting me about it. That is not acceptable, Jafar.”
“Draco,” said a voice coming from the Sultan, though it sounded strange. It wasn’t Lucius voice. It was too animated. As if someone else was speaking through him. “Due to your inability to find a suitor—”
He was back. Back where it all started. Back where Lily and James died protecting him. Back where their screams filled his ears.
be able to figure things out, right?
“It’s not that I don’t want to stay here with you. But, my father… I have to go back to him. I don’t really hate him. Or Agrabah, I just hate being locked inside the palace. To feel so trapped. Though I have a feeling that wouldn’t be as horrible if you were there with me.”
“Uh, Harry. Harry Potter.”
At that, Abu shook his head and moved towards a small hole in the wall. From there, he pulled out… the lamp!
Just like that, Lucius changed from shouting angrily to cheering happily for his son had finally found what he had always been searching for. Love.
“It’s okay,” Potter mutters. “I’m here, I found you. We’re okay.” Another light kiss on Draco’s cheek. It’s extremely intimate, but I can’t find it in myself to look away. “Look, Draco, I found a freckle,” Harry whispers and places a kiss higher on Draco’s face. “It’s very small. Almost invisible. But beautiful. And I found it.” Kiss. “Another here. I can count them. Hmmm… seven on this side.” Now, Potter just lets his thumb run across Draco’s skin, ever so gently. “And let’s see… eight on this side. They’re so beautiful. I found them. I found them and I found you. It’s okay. You’re okay. I love you.”
“I know. And I understand. But how did you? I mean, how are you a prince now?”
Harry held on to Abu as tightly as he held onto the carpet, and felt the headwind grow stronger as they sped up. Up ahead, he could see that the Tiger’s mouth was about to close, and he leaned forwards in an attempt to help the magic carpet fly faster. There was only a few dozen metres left. They could do it!
The man looked curiously upon Harry with an unwavering gaze, yet it didn’t make Harry uncomfortable. He liked being watched by this man.
“You didn’t have to.”
“Oh, I will be sure to be that now. I’m the Sultan of Agrabah, the most powerful sorcerer in the world and the most powerful genie in the world. You can do
Everything is white. The walls. The floors. The ceilings. The windowsills. The curtains. The bedsheets. White, white and more white. Occasionally, the white is disturbed by some steely grey, such as the bedposts and the buttons on the beeping machines that stand beside the one occupied bed. The grey doesn’t bring any comfort at all. It makes everything seem even more washed out. Lifeless.
Listen! Aah, still good.”
going to the library because we both finished our homework before starting on our Christmas ordering, so he doesn’t have a reason to go to the library this late in the afternoon. I also know that Draco has several small places in the castle where he hides whenever he wants to be alone. Though, I have never found any of those places and I know that if he leaves, I won’t be able to find out what’s wrong. Every time he returns from his ‘moments’, he likes to pretend nothing happened.
It grew silent for a short while before Harry piped up again.
Here he comes!
Still, it refused to listen and in his desperate state with too many strong feelings mixed up within him, Harry found himself crying. He was scared. He was so scared. Scared of the fire, scared of dying — no, he wasn’t scared of dying, he was scared of not having lived a full life before dying — and he was scared of losing his best friend.
Harry looked at him with wonder shining through his eyes.
“Come on,” Harry called out softly. “I ain’t gonna hurt you, I swear.” From behind a glorious full-length mirror, he noticed a small movement and he slowly crept closer. “It’s okay, I’m not dangerous. You can come on out.”
too much brain power for you to understand. Well, if you don’t go talk to him, then I shall do it instead.” I smirk. “And, perhaps I’ll even get to offer him some of my… services? Sweet Salazar, he might even say yes? With him coming out the other month, and I
"Don’t play dumb, Potter, I get enough of that from Draco already.”
“He told me
At that, Blaise gives me a strange look, but I guess that’s just his… worried look? I can’t really know, because I haven’t actually seen him worry before. Despite the fact that I’ve… admittedly been watching him a lot lately.
“He… he what?!”
“Jafar,” hissed Draco. “What are you doing here, Jafar. This is supposed to be a family dinner!”
It couldn’t be true, because if it was, Draco was running headfirst into his own grave. People who loved Harry ended up dying, being tortured, being hurt worse than what most people could imagine. He had to make Draco realise he couldn’t love him.
While walking back to Agrabah, Harry continued to communicate with Genie, getting to know him a bit better as well as trying to get some help with figuring out what two wishes would suit him the best. However, it wasn’t long until Harry lost track of the subject and he was talking about the prince. He had already told Genie about how he had ended up in the cave, and he had told him about the incredible encounter he had had with Draco.
While rapidly ranting out the last part, seemingly out of nowhere he manages to produce a small stand with loads of trinkets that he’s obviously trying to sell. Your interest in the man immediately starts to dissipate — he’s not nearly as curious as he first seemed to be if he’s only a salesman — when he continues:
“Do you trust me?”
He gives me a last wave with his hand before he leaves the room, side by side with Dean.
“We do have to tell him, you know,” Draco said. “About you not being a real prince.”
There was no loud bang this time. Just the silent clatter of metal falling onto marble, as Genie’s wristbands unlocked and fell to the floor.
“You mean that you just want to keep staring at him. Then what?”
Genie winked before snapping his fingers and then he disappeared, leaving Harry to stare into the thin air with a heavy feeling in his chest.
Forgetting.
“You ready for dinner with my father?” Draco asked when they parted, at last.
— the guard to get them out of there. Dear Allah, did he wish that no one would bring this up in the future. So embarrassing!
When they found the place where the lamp was, Harry was instantly reminded of the man’s warning for traps. The lamp was placed on the top of a mountain which was surrounded by a lake of lava. He asked Carpet to stay back and keep an eye on Abu while he himself made his way towards the lamp. Carefully, he approached the lamp and lifted it from its pedestal with a tender, yet firm hold on it. Nothing happened, and Harry let out a breath of relief. Now it was only to get back to stable ground and then fly all the way back to the cave’s opening and then he’d be free!
him, Harry and Draco only focus on each other. Draco’s eyes searched Harry’s for answers just like Harry’s tried to tell them. Lucius continued to yell about Jafar being so obnoxious as to make him marry Draco off to him! Unbelievable! None of his words reached the ears of the other two men in the room though, for they solely saw and heard each other. At last, Lucius caught on to the sensation in the air and he turned around to see Draco leaning in to place a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips.
“Imma zap your pretty face if you don’t stop calling me that, you know.” I retort without stopping to admire the red haired man. I let my eyes roam over his tall figure, appreciating the easy posture he has when he’s talking to Seamus on the other side of the room. But I stop when I feel that the view has started a bit too much action
“What do you think you’re doing, street rat?” the guard in question spat. “Isn’t stealing enough of an offence for you? You have to go and assault a guard as well? Just wait ‘til we get ya!”
The list is endless.
White-faced, Genie nodded, and bowed his head towards his new master.
The man proceeded to tell Harry about different things that he could grant Harry, if he only wished for it.
The genie shouted out to the public, demanding people to pay their respects to the prince.
“Hurt him?” Jafar snorted. “Of course I won’t hurt him. I’m simply going to
“I don’t know why you’re insisting on such a mundane task as
Before the man could react, Harry danced around him, slashing with the sword back and forth, up and down, here and there before taking a few steps back. He’d gotten some nice cuts in the man’s rich but dirty clothing, yet not harmed him in any way. Except for one thing. His hand. The hand which had previously been holding onto the smaller man was now laying on the ground.
that I will.”
to stop me now!”
“It’s alright, Harry. I’ll tell them about how you saved me today. It’ll be alright.
Harry didn’t even find it in himself to answer. He still had to let the view of the prince in front of him sink in. Had he thought the man was beautiful
Closing his eyes, Genie raised his hand and snapped his fingers. Lightning struck through the room, from the entrance all the way through the air until it reached Jafar. A loud bang followed and then you could see that Jafar’s skin had gotten a new tint of purple in it.
“This cave can only be entered by one person, and I am not that person. You are. You are, shall we call it a diamond in the rough.”
“Come on, Carpet!” he cheered on. “I know it’s steep, but you can do it, you can get us up there!”
“Yes, of course, the lamp is in here, in my room.”
“Not to worry, your majesty,” Harry said. “Jafar controlled your mind using this staff!” Harry thrust the cane into the air. “He also tried to have me killed, possibly more than once.”
Harry continued to whisper reassuring words until Abu had fallen asleep, and even after that he continued in the hope of also making himself believe his words. The longer time that went by, though, it got harder to believe. It was strange how much easier it was to give up hope on surviving than it was to give up hope about some day actually visiting the palace for real.
This far, it hasn’t. But I’m not giving up. It’s all I can do. Every night, I let the tones sound through the hospital room. And every morning, I go quiet, since the rising sun reminds me that yet another day has started, and I’m still on my own. And I cry again.
He drove Draco to and past his breaking point within a week. He made Draco lose his perfect composure, his stoic lift of his chin.
Away from Harry Potter.
“What about you? What’s your story?” he asked. Not really expecting a reply, he only waited a few seconds before continuing with his own story. “You know, all my life I’ve felt… trapped. Like the corners of this room, the streets of this town, are holding me back. I want to be free.”
Amidst his brooding, Harry noticed the faint sound of footsteps closing in. Hurriedly, he hid the sleeping Abu under his vest. Could he not save his own life, he was going to do anything in his power to save Abu’s.
. The green is a tad darker than the usual Christmas shade, but it’s definitely the right color for that card. It’s surprisingly elegant, to be something of Harry’s making.
Christmas cards,” Malfoy drawls, “but I suppose it can’t hurt to stay here with you. Since I’m certain Harry will want to.”
for your invaluable help. You're the brightest star in my night sky, right now
deserve that.
“Oi, Malfoy, are you alright?”
He lost all sense of time as he walked along corridor after corridor, the pathway constantly surrounded by different kinds of treasures. But he still hadn’t seen the lamp. He felt Abu stirring beneath his vest, a telltale sign of the monkey being close to waking up. But that wasn’t the only sensation he got. Harry also had the feeling that someone was following him. When passing an alley of expensive-looking mirrors, he quickly snatched a silver hand mirror which he used to watch behind his back while he still kept walking through the cave in search of the lamp.
“Well, look who we’ve got here,” the guard smiled ruefully. “If it isn’t the infamous street rat, Harry Potter!”
in question was nowhere to be seen.
His train of thought was stopped when the tall man suddenly ordered him to stop and get off the horse. Harry did as he was told, and the man followed suit. He held out something for Harry to take and in the faint starlight, Harry could see that it glimmered in gold.
“As the sultan, I demand that Lucius and Draco Malfoy become my slaves. Not servants — slaves! And you!” Jafar pointed at Harry. “You are about to die. Again!”
“I’m sorry, I’m not as fast as you are,” he explained apologetically when it did come back.
Soon, we’ve accidentally started a full on snowball war, three against three. Me, Blaise and Seamus versus Harry, Malfoy and Dean. By now, it’s long since everyone else left us to finish the work on the igloo as it is almost done anyways. And our playful fight probably scares most of the other students off. No one – except maybe Neville, ‘Mione and Ginny – dares to have a fight with any of us. We’re the ultimate war heroes, after all. At least us Gryffindors. The Slytherins are just scary as hell.
The genie stared at Harry dumbfounded.
“Oh, that’s my amazing thieving best friend!” Harry cried out and once again hugged Abu to his chest, before taking the lamp and examining it. “I wonder what the man wanted this for? It’s clearly not very valuable. Look at how dirty it is! But what, I think there’s anything written there. I can’t quite make it out.”
Panic rising in his chest, Harry once again ran around the room, looking under every cloth he could see. His best friend was nowhere to be seen. Harry felt his heart ache so much he found it hard to breathe, and he didn’t know what to do. His pulse began to race and soon his entire body was shaking. Then Draco was there by his side, holding him firmly. Consistently, he worked to calm Harry down, petting his hair softly and mumbling reassuring words into Harry’s ear. He didn’t know if it was the words or the vibration they sent through Harry’s skin that did the wonder, but nonetheless, it worked. Fairly soon were they both sitting on the floor, breathing normally again, no more trembles rushing through their hands.
Yet, there was something in his heart that told him to not lose hope. It wasn’t the sound of the old man that had helped him as a kid, and it wasn’t the voice of his own head. The voice had a tone that reminded him of Draco, but it wasn’t quite right. But he trusted it. He trusted the voice, for it was all he could do. All he could do was hope, dream. Even when there was nothing left.
“Oh, bloody hell,” I breathe. And then I realise something else. “Oh,
“Uh, I don’t know.” Harry said as he started to walk to the silhouette of Agrabah that he could see towering up by the horizon. “It’s quite a lot, to ask someone to wish for three things that could be anything, wish for any dream to come true. What would you wish for, Genie?”
“Yeah, but I thought– wait, what do you mean ‘been with him’? I thought you two only met when you study for group assignments and such. You mean you’ve seen him more than that?”
“Obviously.” I mutter.
Abu chattered a rather long rant, to which Harry nodded along with a serious expression, until Abu got silent and he smiled a cheeky grin at the monkey.
“Jafar has taken it,” he said, not bothering to hide the bitterness in his tone. Then another thought crossed his mind.
“Only once, if you had just been successful.”
You learned to love the heat of summer instead. Long nights spent in one another’s company. Tipsy evenings at the beach, playing in the warm sand.
“Someone special,” he answers cryptically, before casting a glance towards Malfoy who’s busy staring out the window. “Also, I'm not going to spend Christmas Day at the Burrow. I have some sun to catch.”
I am the only one who knows about him and Draco, that much is clear. At first I didn’t believe him, but after that day we spent building the snow house, it is
Thanks again to Tacky for looking this through for me. You’re amazing!!
“He told you about
“What would that be?” he asked, a tinge too naive and oblivious to understand. The larger man laughed a sickening laugh and took a step closer, sneaking a hand onto the smaller man’s hip, only to snatch him towards his large body.
“That’s better,” he smiles, “I’ve always adored your high cheekbones, that tight jaw… would be a pity to let them face the ground where I can’t see them, wouldn’t it?”
The man sighed, huffed a little and then went lax with slumped shoulders. “In the past my superiors,” he now spoke clearly and with strength, “ordered me not to make a file and to ignore Madam Tonk’s requests.”
“You do realize this is a mad house,” Mandy rolled her eyes, “they don’t just leave knives lying about.”
Violet sipped hers. “No, that’s ok, this is awesome. I’ve never been in here and watched the staff work like this. Then again, I’ve never been here with someone spending money like water. But man, you boys clean up nice.”
“I don’t think they practice the type and amount of torture it would take to make myself or Potter talk.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Tawy, I’m not going to leave Draco Malfoy alone in the middle of muggle London.”
Draco dusted off his robes, “that felt good.”
She shrugged, “I am, though our most notable family members were squibs, a musician and a doctor. I guess healing runs in the family.” She smiled, “we’re going to apparate to St. Mungo’s, and you’ll side along with me, alright?”
Harry sighed, relaxing as Draco’s weight anchored against him.  “Nope and it’s big enough for both of us, so relax. I won’t let it hurt you.”
She smiled and nodded back before turning to take in the whole group. “Before we begin I will drop a privacy bubble over us and remind you that this group is under hex. This group above all others will not tolerate any type of tampering. Everyone here, is here for the same reason and there is no shame. This is a safe zone and I will maintain it as such, everyone understand?” She glanced around the circle, waiting for every person to nod before moving on.
Neville blushed with a pleased grin, “Mostly the work of my wife.”
Harry steeled his nerves, turned his head and brushed his lips against Draco’s.
He looked to Ron, who always came back for him. “If you don’t like it, we’ll come save you, yeah? We owe you a couple.” He meant it, even if he had to fight the whole Ministry to do it, he’d try.
Hermione and Ron shared a look of ‘here we go again’. Ron scowled and decided to stop the whole thing before it got started. Depending on Harry’s mood he could start defending or cursing Draco Malfoy but either way it took forever to calm him down. Harry didn’t even carry on about the Dark Lord as much, which they very carefully didn’t mention. Hermione thought there was something to that. Ron didn’t want to know. “Listen mate, they’re going to get what they deserve. I know you said you were going to speak up for Mrs. Malfoy but the other two didn’t do squat for us, so let them rot.”
Murphy nodded. “Yes, it does, and because these memories and feelings are awful, you may want to avoid the triggers. Avoiding things that give you terrible feelings is normal and it will make you feel better in the short term.  But in the long run, avoiding triggers will make things worse. Instead of avoiding triggers, we learn how to manage our reactions when they happen. It’s not fair, but a lot of surviving, is overcoming experiences that are not our fault.”
“Take a moment, think back to the things we’ve recently spoken about.”
“Two people, I was required to take note of any sigil magic on the accused and this mark appeared on the Malfoy’s. I’m sure it’s the same, I never forget a sigil. Madame Malfoy informed me it was Black family magic, part of the marriage rite. She would tell me nothing more and, as it tested out as non-threatening, I had to let it go.”
Molly frowned and rubbed her forehead wearily, “Bad off then. We knew there would be some repercussions. Ron’s,” she took a deep breath, “he’s not well. Something called PTSD they tell me, the muggle-born healers, there’s no cure, no potion. They broke up, Ron and Hermione, I’d thought, well I thought I’d have weddings to plan but all I have is broken.” The tears gathered in her eyes. Minerva moved from around her desk and took the chair closest to Molly, moving it even closer and comforted the woman with a soft hand and no empty words. Molly gripped her hand.
‘I don’t know what’s supposed to happen,’ George had said, ‘Ron doesn’t know either. He just told me he received a letter from Dumbledore, and you know how he is, all it said was the deluminator would light the way when it was time. Ron was afraid to take it with him to Australia, so he left it for me to watch, but I have a feeling this has something to do with the rest of it, ah so, you’d better take it. At least till Ron and Hermione return.’
“How?” She pressed, looking between them.
Rey shut the door on the girls’ questions and another room appeared at the back of the wardrobe.  It was pretty much as Harry expected. Though Ben seemed awfully disappointed neither of them was that impressed.
Tawy met her look with one of her own, serious and pointed, “Of course they’re dangerous. They’re wounded children, who were used as pawns and weapons for years. All that pain with a vast amount of power at their fingertips.” She shook her head, “Headmistress, until you suggested it, I had no intention of sending them back here. But you made some excellent points and I concede to them.”
“Look at them,” Ron hissed, “it’s like they don’t even care.”
Ron’s dragonhide boot pushed against the table as he balanced his chair on the back legs. His eyebrow rose, daring Smith to deny it, “Why in the muggle hell would I do that to my best mate?” His wand twirled between his fingertips, a move that looked graceful and easy now, but Hermione knew it had taken hours of work, while sitting a tent and trying not to worry.
Ella nodded and slowly took a sip from her drink, dragging it out, as she held their attention. “I saw the memo at the healer’s station. Along with the number allowed viewing at one time and a reminder that taking any pictures of them is strictly prohibited.”
The only other option was a blood adoption. Take a pure-blooded orphan and through ritual and blood turn that child into a Malfoy, just as binding as birth and without the wait of pregnancy and infancy. That way he would know the child’s tendencies and personally beforehand.
“Good, that’s lovely. Do give it back to him.” Tawy looked to Molly. “That’s all they’ll need. We will provide everything else.”
Harry scratched the side of his head with his wand tip. “Your daughter has a what?”
“No, but it might help,” Tawy said softly, “If you want to, if not, that’s okay too.”
“My parents never used the cruciatus curse on me. They tried to keep me safe.” Draco looked to his parents, his father stoic, his mother’s gathered tears.
, but kids this powerful and this tightly wound, problem.
Draco brought his heel up onto his chair and put the anklet on, it flashed slightly then, nothing. After a few moments, he put his foot back onto the floor. “I guess we’ll see what good ol’ da’s up to sooner or later.”
“Like since we were 11.”
“I took several deep breaths and talked myself though what happened. I realized it had nothing to do with me and was able to calm myself down.”
“And if they tell us to shove off about everything. I’ve wasted good shit and got nothing.” She glared at Rey.
Ben grinned wickedly. “Hey we can see? You know the scar and the dark mark? Come on, huh?”
Tawy shook her head, “no, thank you. I can’t stay long, but thank you for making time for me.” Hogwarts was lovely and while the office wasn’t as she had pictured it, from Draco and Harry’s words, she imagined the changes were only due to the change in occupant. The new Headmistress had a stern manner but Draco and Harry spoke highly of her.
“Draco,” Neville smiled, “You look good.”
“Leaving it exactly as it is,” Harry turned from Ron to interrupt. He took the end of braid. “Look Hermione I learned how to make a fishtail braid.”
“What about when your friends find out?”
Violet seemed a little shy as she opened the door to her flat. “It’s not much, certainly not what you’re used to, I’m sure.”
“Healer Robertoun,” Shacklebolt quickly got up and walked Healer Tawy’s way with purpose. They ignored everyone around them, throwing up a privacy shield once close enough.
Neville nodded. “Yeah, nothing involving Harry is ever easy. I know George.” He took George’s arm and squeezed it, “I-We got this mate.”
“No. Vincent and Goyle were the only children that were invited to the manor and they certainly didn’t know any. I never played any muggle games. We played hunt the muggle, but I didn’t like that game. And one of them always ended up crying when they got the hex.”
Draco shook his head and gave up any pretense of drawing. “I need to get over it. You need to give me a potion to make this go away.”
“My apologies, we didn’t mean to cause any trouble. Dr. Stride,” he offered his hand, but Harry didn’t let go of his wand or Draco, so after an awkward pause, he dropped his hand with a smile. “I work in mental spell damage. I haven’t gotten a chance to introduce myself before now, but I must say that was some bloody impressive magic.”
She shivered but shook her head. “No.”
Murphy grinned. “That’s fantastic Ella, really good work.” He looked around, “did everyone see what Ella did? Instead of reacting with panic, she looked around herself and took the time to calmly study what was happening.”
Half way through his sandwich, Ron broke up their conversation about Hogwarts’ reconstruction to say, “Do you think Malfoy’s memories will get him time in Azkaban?” While not seen in open court, the memories forcibly taken from the accused were used against them as charges and in reference.
Harry shrugged at Draco questioning look before following the others into the room. The boy, who had called them in, lay on his bed, book propped in front of him. The room didn’t seem any different than theirs, just further from the healer’s station. Harry couldn’t see how that would make this room any safer from getting caught.
Draco blinked. “But that’s rude.”
Tawy thrust the potion to Helen and approached him with her hands raised. “Draco it’s alright. You don’t have to take the draught, we have other options,” her voice was musical with calm soft influxes, “Can you tell me why you don’t want to take it?”
“I agree,” Draco didn’t want any more unwanted attention on Harry. Nor did he want attention brought onto anything that might make Harry even more attractive to the harpies. He took up Potter’s hand and slid the ring onto his finger, where it adjusted happily.
Judge Fumeurs appeared saddened and nearly at a loss as he gently said. “Son-Your Grace, they used the imperius on you, quite often I might add.”
Draco’s eyebrow rose and Harry’s eyes widened. “Masses?”
Draco glanced at who was coming towards him and nearly sobbed (but certainly didn’t) at the pain and righteous anger on Potter’s face as he moved closer. He knew that look and knew for once that anger wasn’t aimed at him. Potter took his hand and Draco couldn’t help himself, he launched himself onto him and wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck. Harry’s arms wrapped around him tightly and he could hear Harry whispering, “it’s okay Draco, it’s alright.”

“I’m afraid I don’t know that game.”
“Suffer cause she sneaks in the good stuff too Rey. Keep it up and I won’t share.” Mandy didn’t even look up from one of the newest magazines hidden on her lap. “Listen here, the last bloke on trial said Draco Malfoy was the Dark Lord’s torturer. The mag says the judge wouldn’t even hear it and rightfully so, according to them. The judge sentenced the bloke to Azkaban.”
Seated next to her, Padma murmured, “Shaped up quite nicely that one”.
Harry waved a hand at him. “See there you go. So?”
Tawy nodded, “Alright, let’s start there.” They nodded and she continued, “the 8
Anger rolled up her spine as Potter smiled at Malfoy. “You bastards, how did you do it? Tell me.”
Minerva sighed and carefully didn’t roll her eyes. She picked up her cup, “Indeed,” she didn’t see how anyone could have missed the signs. Even Severus had noticed. What she really wanted to do was remind Molly that she was not in fact Dumbledore and had no use for meddling. Especially in Harry’s life. She actually thought removing Harry and Draco from their adult influences might not have been such a bad idea, through the ministry had cocked it up in the way of removal.
Harry brushed his bangs down while Draco brushed a hand over his sleeve.
Ron nudged his other shoulder, “It’s his own memories which are going accuse him mate. You say whatever you have to say to make it alright with yourself. Just remember, in the end it’s the court’s choice.”
“Potter, I’m sitting next to you, so not good for me if you lose control.”
“Me too. But she,” Harry stopped.

Draco didn’t glance around. He held his head high and looked indifferent to the whispers around them. He followed Potter to the table and, since neither wanted to sit with their back to the room, silently arranged the chairs somewhat on the same side of table. Far enough apart that they weren’t really sitting next to each other, but both had the comfort of the wall behind them. Draco took up the shake, determined to get it out of the way. Potter must have had the same idea. It didn’t taste all that bad and he finished without thinking about it. It also filled him. He pushed his tray away the same time Potter did.
Harry wiggled his fingers through his damp hair then rolled the sleeves of his grey shirt. At least he didn’t have to worry about what to wear. He had a wardrobe full of the same thing. There were some light green loose pants, which were at least soft, some trainers, a drawer of underwear and socks, along with variations of short-sleeve matching green t-shirts, and gray long-sleeved shirts. There was even a soft gray hoodie with his last name on the front.
“We’ve noticed,” Zabini added, “but besides send Killsmen after them. There’s not much to be done now. The whole world knows about it, likely Draco and Potter, where ever they are, do as well.”
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “Can we try?”
Neville didn’t think he’d even seen Draco grin like that, carefree and young. He thought he might now see why Harry was so taken with him. Then he chuckled as Hermione let Harry go and threw herself into hugging Draco, who seemed pleased but unsure how to act, rather like an owl getting its feather’s ruffled. Neville grinned at Harry.
“And you know he doesn’t read. So of course, the whole war just went over his head.” Mandy teased.
“There you go Murphy. Thank you.”
Mandy’s face pinched. “People always say something. Pity the poor girl whose mother sold her for potions.”
Zacharias’ scowled deepened. He’d left the D.A. and Hogwarts before the final battle. He needed something to distinguish himself before school’s end. Potter and Malfoy’s friendship would do that. The reporters didn’t even know his name, that did not bear well for his future. He thought furiously, but there was nothing for it, he had no rebuttal, frustrated he gritted out, “And Malfoy, he your best mate too?”
Harry could arrest to that.
“You didn’t know them.” Draco scowled.
Harry shook his head, “No, here, let’s see,” Harry pretended to think.
Draco turned away from him and Harry wrapped his arms around him in a tight hug. He released him and did a loose braid.
“Play?” Harry repeated, he glanced at Draco, who shrugged, “we’ll try.”
Harry hummed something close to, “uh-huh” while Draco shrugged.
Harry leaned into the hug, tightly hugging George back, he could smell cigarettes and a hint of alcohol, but he wasn’t drunk as far as Harry could tell.
“No. We made it up.” Draco said seriously.
Draco inhaled and after a moment exhaled, smoke wafting around them. Draco leaned back. “Insane every one of them and we deserve everything we get.”
“Who’s to say she’d know more than you? I think it’s just a waiting game now.”
Draco shook his head, “but that was for my safety. They had to, I broke through it a lot, can’t stay under.  And I couldn’t, not,” He broke off unable to put into words all the things he couldn’t handle when the Dark Lord had lived in their home. The imaginations of those in the courtroom quickly began to speculate.
Pansy sniffed, “I never did like him, arse. Pulling this shite on Draco, dropping this on him. Draco didn’t want to be his leader. He tried to get rid of them a million times and the stupid things just came back. Draco told them he was dangerous and that idiot has the audaciously to blame Draco for his fucked-up life.” She looked to Ron and Hermione and waved a hand over the parchment, “what do we do with this?”
Robertoun, he glanced at the healer, “you’re a pureblood?”
“And if they did, we could let their arses get caught.” Ben shrugged.
Draco scowled. “Your mother kills her husbands.”
They assured her they did not and wouldn’t before making their way went to their room.
“You remember what to do?”
Draco didn’t even know why she’d said anything in the first place.
Draco bit his lip and played with the apple slice. Likely anyone they met would worship Potter and hate him, but if he was on somewhat good terms with Potter, well maybe people wouldn’t outright hex him. “Yeah.” And honestly, he was rather over fighting.
“Hmm,”
Draco joined them a few minutes later and handed Harry a full toiletry bag, “you’re set.”
Harry didn’t yank away, as long Draco held him, he had no fear of being pulled over the step. He patted her hand, “Maybe Romilda, but I think I was made for him,” he tilted his head towards Draco.
Narcissa’s hand wrapped around Draco’s wrist, her thumb at the underside, the hold was iron tight, yet her thumb made soothing circles against his pulse. “Will we be able to visit?”
Shacklebolt tilted his head with a curl of lip that was neither a smile nor a grimace. “The Malfoy’s are next up on the block after lunch.”
“My hero.”
The girl behind Romilda groaned, “fuck, they’re looking for you two, go!”
“We just got caught up,” Draco added.
“Even when the article was written by Hermione Granger.” Mandy threw her hands up.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if they were.” Another Weasley voiced.
Murphy started talking even before they sat down, not giving any room for questions, they’d already been told not to ask.
Harry glanced over to Draco, people wanted to take pictures of them? Really?
Draco looked to Tawy who smiled and shrugged. “My predecessor had a taste for the finer things in life and it’s so beautiful I just kept adding to it.”
Rey grinned, “It looks like even healers aren’t immune to having celebrities in their mist.” He frowned and twisted in his seat. A whole bunch of people hanging around and watching them, made him nervous.
They had only attempted to restrain he and Draco once, after a nightmare. He couldn’t imagine how it would’ve gone had Tawy not torn into the room and removed them. The potions however yeah, they took a lot of them daily and neither one of them were sure what most of them were. He didn’t want more of that.
The Healer paused. “What are you doing?”
Finally Hermione announced, “Ready to meet the masses?”
Clara looked up. “Oh, Harry Potter and… Draco Malfoy.” Her eyes widened, “leave them alone Ben.”
“Right here,” she called out as she jogged up. “Potter and Malfoy what’s happened?”
He chuckled, “Really? Draco? All I can say is our crazy and chaotic make sense together.”
Draco chuckled. “I have no idea Potter. I know most people touch each other all the time. My friends have tried it with me, but I didn’t like it, so they stopped.” Harry started to lift his head. Draco stopped him. “But I’m willing to try with you too Potter. I’ve never had someone of my own either. I like it when you touch me. I don’t seem to have boundaries with you.”
“Hello boys, got yours right here, finish the shakes, yeah?” The lady handed over a tray to each of them and Harry quickly scanned for a table. He found an empty one by the wall and headed towards it.
Teddy thought carefully about what to show them. He steered clear of the gossip and fan pages, then immediately thought of the first thing and clicked the favorite tab.
They worked over Draco for little over two hours and he was groggily pulling himself out of sleep when they finally finished.
“Thank you,” Harry offered, but even Rey could tell his attention was on Draco and the small dagger he held.
Blaise looked around and Ron knew he’d been hanging out with the snakes too long because, while his handsome face showed nothing, Ron knew he was really upset. Ron could see the same on Pansy’s face. He couldn’t even pinpoint how he knew, as her face was serene, but Ron knew. Perhaps it was in the way her hand turned and clutched Hermione’s.
“That’s what the papers said.” Ben didn’t even look up from his hunt for the perfect chip.
Harry grinned into the platinum hair as Draco moved closer instead of away from his tighter grip and decided he was never moving aside for Pansy or anyone else.
Harry rolled his eyes. He’d noticed Malfoy only said the dreaded word when Ron was around. Actually, Hermione had and then he’d paid attention and found the same. Harry played with the edge of the plate. “Um what does siphoned mean?”
“We can um roll you a few, right Mandy?” Ben looked at her with wide eyes, already nodding.
“Oh, not going there.”
George didn’t know why they put up with it, but instead of anger Neville gave her a fond thoughtful nod.
“And if they don’t listen to Potter’s demands?”
Ben looked up. Potter and Malfoy were nearly at their table. Maybe it was the idea of them or something but Ben would swear they moved more fluidly or powerfully. They just felt different somehow.
“I’ve set up times for Saturday. That way we can have Sunday before we have to go Hogwarts on Monday. You’ll still have a couple of days there before the train arrives.” They nodded but didn’t offer anything else, “Do you remember what the goal is for this year?”
Ron couldn’t imagine anyone (even Draco) calling Lucius da and for some reason it cracked him up.
“We’ll be alright.”
Mandy blinked. Malfoy had saved them.
Even as Draco bristled next to him, Harry just felt exhausted. He touched Draco’s hand, “Is that what this is about? You want us to tell you all the ways they fucked us up.”
Still Harry wasn’t able to hide his relief when it was time to leave. Though he felt bad. Draco needed more than platitudes and afternoon small-talk from his parents but Draco didn’t know how to ask and Harry didn’t know how to direct him.
do this without you. I’ll defend you. I’ll fight for us and when I fight, I fucking win. I just need to know that you want me too.”
Draco’s whole body relaxed, his smile widened, he swung Harry’s hand, “Have you ever seen the gazebo Harry?”
Draco was relieved when he heard Potter begin to write. Made him feel like he could write and not worry about what Scar head was doing. He looked down to the last part he’d written. ‘Potter’s touch doesn’t make me want to get away. I don’t know what that means. I want to trust him. I don’t trust anyone. We talk and he doesn’t remind me of all the mistakes I’ve made. There is no reason for Potter to want my friendship now. My name is in disgrace. My parents have no power to do anything for him. We have money but so does he. Potter has everything, he won. He’s the all power-full Savior. And yet... he doesn’t brag about winning and sometimes, in group, when things are hard, he’ll press his leg into mine and I feel better. I like it when I say something, and I look over and see him smiling at me. I don’t know. All I’ve had is alliances and relationships based on need. Is this friendship? After all this time, he wants to be my friend, why when I have nothing does he offer?’
She ignored Kade and offered her hand to Ron. “Mr. Weasley, I presume.”
He nodded and she released the bubble. She turned to Draco, “Draco can we talk for a bit?”
Vos (nicknamed Bear, for reasons obvious to anyone who saw him) growled, “Sentez will start on the paperwork. I’m going to the Ministry to rid that arse of his job with extreme prejudice.”
Harry could see Lucius’ shoulders un-tensed a little and Narcissa leaned back a touch in her chair.
Teddy shook his head, looking between his brothers. He owed it to them to be honest. “I want to go, but,”
If he chose correctly half his work would be already done. They would know pure blood ways and if he chooses a child older than Draco. Well that would make things twice as easy. Age would already set him up as the next Lord Malfoy. He would tell Narcissa that this way Draco was free to do whatever he wanted, to follow wherever his fancy took him. He would set aside a generous investment portfolio in Draco’s name so he would never want for a galleon no matter how he spent. He would allow Draco to keep the Black titles and inheritances as Narcissa would certainly insist and the titles gifted to him at birth. He would make sure his new inheritor would sincerely take care of Draco and his wellbeing. That should bring Narcissa around to the idea.
Harry frowned, “about what?”
All of her contacts answered their floo save Mrs. Tonks. So instead of leaving a message she left some files and then reconnected with the Ministry.
in their lives they’ve ever chosen for themselves are each other. They will fight to protect what they’ve found together. They will use everything you people put into them to do it. Without hesitation, just as they were taught.” Tawy scowled, “Hence, if I find reason, any reason, I will remove them.”
Harry turned and stared. Draco had changed clothes, fitted jeans and sky-blue collared shirt with the top buttons undone. Sunglasses perched in his hair. “They make the best shoes here Harry. I’ve picked out a pair and some clothes for you. I need you to come try on.”
“It’s worse casting,” Malfoy whispered, and everyone stopped talking, “when you have to hold it too long. Held long enough and the cruciatus stops being a screaming punishment and becomes a clawing death keel. Held that long and they stop screaming. They claw their own skin down to the bone trying to stop it. They piss and sometimes shit on themselves. Their bones begin to snap as they slam onto the floor and all they can do is jerk and hitch.” Malfoy tilted his head. “Like a fish,” he starred at the floor and everyone starred at him. “Then, when you finally let it go. They can’t stand, can’t function as their mind is gone, choking on their own teeth and blood. You can heal the body, but the mind will never mend. Then Avada Kedavra is a blessing.” Malfoy’s soft words tapered off. He hadn’t looked up once, his eyes on some distant spot on the ground.
“If you say so, it must be.” He handed Potter the joint.
“You’re the only one marked. The only one our age in the inner circle, because he had an unhealthy fascination with you.” She tapped her finger against the table, marking her points. “He got that fascination because Lucius and Narcissa let him see you. Had they hidden you away, he would have never seen you to get fascinated with in the first place. Draco you were there, and you damn well shouldn’t have been.” Pansy had thought about this a lot. She had thought about it every time she’d seen Draco’s picture recently, so daily. “You’re beautiful and powerful. They were stupid if they didn’t think that would grab his interest. And neither Lucius nor Narcissa are stupid. Their egos were just too big. They thought they could flaunt you in front of him and still protect you.”
He looked to Ron and Hermione. Ron didn’t seem very hopeful and they both looked to Hermione, who bit her lip, not a very comforting gesture.  She frowned sadly. “Siphoning is serious business Harry. It means someone’s been taking your magic. It’s important you fix this,” and thinking of Harry’s nightmares added, “and maybe the other stuff too.” Though she didn’t say it, Hermione recognized the position they were in, trapped within the Ministry. They couldn’t afford for Harry to lose control if they ever wanted him back.
“Ah, thanks,” Harry knew he was blushing and that the ladies noticed when they laughed good naturally. “We would like to take you out to lunch after this.” Harry figured they at least owed them a lunch for their patience. He had to force it a little, Violet seemed a little reluctant to eat on their dime, but Mandy talked her around and Harry nodded her along.
Harry calmed under their support. Finally, he nodded, taking comfort in their relief. He looked up, “Alright, I’ll go.”
Ron grabbed her hand and looked up at him with a pain-filled expression, “Harry, mate, we all know what you hear around Dementors.”
“What’s happened? Drinking? Drugs?” Tawy spoke to the viewing glass. She couldn’t see either of these boy’s as capable of losing control to this degree without help. They were just too tightly controlled to let this loose. As controlled as two unstable and powerful beings could be.
“Ginny?” Harry grinned and hugged him tighter. “You and Gin. Brilliant mate!”
“I can be calm and understanding.”
They paused outside Malfoy manor. Harry swung their hands as he gave Draco a moment to look the building over. He glanced at Tawy, who appeared in no hurry. “Do you wanna destroy something or spend money?” Harry offered. He was down for either choice.
Draco nodded.
Hermione had an arm around both Ron and Harry. He could just see her fingertips at Harry and Ron’s sides. Charlie couldn’t see much around, he assumed Malfoy’s back, due to the long platinum hair. What he could see was Ron’s head lowered to Harry’s, practically forehead to forehead as they whispered. Harry’s arm wrapped around Malfoy’s waist and gripped Ron’s wrist tightly, where Charlie could see Ron’s fingers wrapped in white locks. Perhaps Malfoy’s inclusion in their number wasn’t as unwelcomed as he’d thought.
Harry frowned. “So soon?” He wouldn’t be allowed time to say goodbye to the other Weasleys, his friends, or even get anything?
Harry glanced at the byline, and sure enough Hermione’s name looked back at him. He skimmed the article. He read about the paperwork filed with the ministry when he and Draco were 15, along with their classmates, which marked their magic ability as slightly above normal. Then he read of the original paperwork found in Dumbledore’s office, which not only proved Dumbledore falsified ministry paperwork, but that he and Draco were quite a distance away from normal. Hermione made great pains to explain why Dumbledore might have done such a thing and had downplayed the idea of them having such a magical ability having any meaning. Harry had read her words enough to know it came from her. Still damn-it. He threw the paper onto the table. “It says our scores were above average that’s it. Doesn’t mean anything.”
“What?” Harry caught himself, before he clutched the silken white ribbons of hair in his hands, but it was a close thing. “Don’t.”
“Draco,” Pansy started unsure, which caught Draco attention, “I saw your parents. Your mother gave me a letter for you.” Pansy slid the letter across the table. She expected Draco to dive onto it, but instead to took it and folded it to stick in a pocket.
“Ah,” the man danced between his feet, “I don’t have his file with me sir.”
Harry put the smaller bag into the backpack, as Draco did the same. “The young lady at the counter recommended a lovely restaurant.”
“Time that I’ve got,” he sighed, “and it’s theirs. I guess, if anything, the other kids will get a sense of being happy it wasn’t them. Maybe it’ll help them overcome their own fears.”
“So, we won’t get house points taken away?” Harry asked.
“Well we could just offer to let them in on it.” Ben suggested.
“Oh my god, that poor kid. And Harry?” She couldn’t believe the amount of trauma and pain that kid must be suffering, unbelievable.
It also became fashionable to need therapy to deal with it all. Open therapy groups, one of the newest ideas taken from the muggle world. Hand in hand with the new vogue to embrace anything muggle. Especially if you happen to be a pureblood.
“I don’t think they’re coming.” Rey whispered to Ben.
“She’s right,” Seamus added, “We know the ministry is up to something, what with this resort bollocks. Ron told us what they did. How they just took them.”
Harry didn’t answer. He stared at her for a moment before he slumped and tightened his hold on Draco. “Oh, fuck Draco. My aunt, cousin, and uncle hate me. Like really hate me, no matter what I do. She once kicked me because I called her mum by mistake. I can’t even pretend they liked me even a little bit. I know family hate and I promise, you could turn into a glow worm and Narcissa Malfoy would still love you.”
Hermione laughed. “You did, it looks great. You look great.” He did, healthier and so much happier. The dark circles around his eyes were gone and as he sat up, his shoulders weren’t hunched by invisible weight. She wondered if they had seen the papers or heard about what people were saying and she loathed mentioning it. She stood up, “Harry, come grab some drinks with me.”
“Kingsley and Healer Tawy.” Harry watched as the Minister pulled some parchment from his robes, the Healer a quill.
The assistant tapped her wrist and eyed the list of names before announcing. “They’ve left dinner and have just entered their room.”
She knew they were right but thought about trying anyway. She left them with the promise to deliver their dinner herself and that they wouldn’t be disturbed.
Tawy grabbed the wands, hoping having to focus their magic though the wands would help them regain control. She left the observation room and cautiously approached the doorway, where she held the wands on an open offering palm. They flew from her palm and into the hands of their owners, she nodded with a smile. They didn’t need to think she was angry. She made her way back to the observation room.
