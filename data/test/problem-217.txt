“Harry…” the blonde started, not sure where he was going with the sentence. He just wanted to say the brunette’s name. Not one second after the word was out of his mouth, Harry stuck his tongue in and crashed his lips upon Draco’s. The blonde moaned as he was finally given what he wanted, casting any thoughts of reasons why they shouldn’t do this aside.
Harry was just about to close the diary in frustration. He was nowhere near finding the mysterious owner and he was going to be late to class, but then his name caught his attention in the next entry and he simply couldn't put the notebook down now. He made his way to DADA, placing the notebook descretely behind a textbook to appear as if he was studying, then continued reading through class.
“That is absolutely not how my field works, Harry. You should know that better than anyone. How would you feel if someone gave you a mystery case that apparently could not be solved before and expected you to just have it solved within an hour?”
Harry decided he couldn't hold back anymore. There would be no more fake smiles and light conversations. This was truth time. He spoke from the heart.
"I was sincere earlier when I- when I said you could talk to me. So, would you like to tell me what's wrong? No more yelling. No more apologies. I promise."
“Yes!” Harry said instantly without thinking it through. He wanted to slap himself when Draco recoiled and flinched at the loud response. Speaking more quietly, Harry explained “I am sorry, Draco. I-I know that you don’t want to talk about it, but you really scared me yesterday and-”
He stopped at the lady's address and found that the dog, a Labrador, indeed, was starving. He was clawing st the door and didn't even bother to bark when seeing a stranger enter. He merely walked to his plate and moved it around with his foot. Harry scrambled to find his food and when he did, emptied the entire content into the plate, even though he knew it was unhealthy to give the dogs more than they would normally eat. He didn't care. This dog deserved more than what was done to him and his owner. Just like draco did.
"Draco. I need you to listen to me. You are not a burden to me. You aren't now and you never were and you never will be! I am serious. Please believe me. Don't you trust me? Why would we have stayed together for so long and why would you be here now if you caused me any trouble? I loved you before and I care so much about you and well-being now. If there's anything or
Harry could only watch in horror as the blonde ran, stumbling, and made it into a stall just in time to vomit everything the brunette had just forced him to eat. Harry closed his eyes, and, though it broke his heart, he knew there was no other way. Someone had to know about this, about everything. If this continues for a few more weeks, the blonde would be dead for sure and Harry couldn't let that happen. He had to tell Pomfrey everything. She would know what to do, even if she has to force nutrition potions down the blonde's throat. Harry didn't care how she would go about it, but it was the last day of the semester and Harry was out of options.
“M-my condition makes me very...sensitive. You’re very important to me, Harry. When I make you mad-”
"Please don't do anything else to me." he said wetly. Harry was about to envelope him in a comforting hug, when the blonde dashed to the floo, called out knockturn alley, and disappeared without another word.
Harry didn't want to ask. Perhaps it was private, but the bathroom incident had taught him never to cast a spell that he didn't know the outcome of and draco has been a tad suicidal as of late, so he just had to know.
"I'm sorry." he heard the blonde whisper, though it was muffled. He looked back to find Draco burying his head in his hands, leaning over.
Draco simply stared at him. Harry flinched. He had forgotten for a second that none of those things would happen, not while Draco was like this. He shook his head and took the blonde to a mall anyways, regretting it as soon as they entered the place and draco made a beeline for the 'husband chair' in the corner. Harry sighed and they left shortly after. The day couldn't have gone any worse, but then it did. It was almost 9 pm when they returned and Harry groaned at the thought that he would have to force Draco to eat something. Before he could open his mouth, though, the blonde turned to look at him with a genuine smile.
Harry's heart broke at his words. Not what he was saying, but the way he spoke, as if Harry was any other person, as if he needed to thank him, as if they had never been together before that fateful event in Myrtle's bathroom.
"I made a promise and I won't back down on it." he said firmly, trying to convey how important it was for him that Draco trust him. Draco looked away, seemingly.. Ashamed?
The emotions hit him fast, too complicated and contradicting to understand at once. Draco was scared, relieved, worried, ashamed, and sad. But the guilt was the greatest. He felt like clawing his eyes out and shredding his face in shame of the terrible crime he was committing, but he was certain he would never regret this decision. Carefully, he placed a hand on his stomach and started to think of ways to explain himself before his child disappears.
"You aren't going anywhere until you eat SOMETHING, Malfoy." Harry hissed through his teeth and Draco flinched at the name, then looked up at Harry wide-eyed, looking panicked.
“Yes, I know what a special is. I just-don’t know what they are for today. If you’ll excuse me for a moment, I can ask-” the blonde started, and was already walking backwards towards the counter when the guy yelled out again.
Harry couldn't help it. He really couldn't. He knew he shouldn't be reading these personal, tear-stained, thoughts, but it was as though he couldn't put the mysterious journal down.
Harry jumped at the sound of Pomfrey's voice, who was now standing behind him with a sad smile on her face. He remained quiet, thinking he had just imagined the whole thing.
No. He couldn't go there. He couldn't. Draco has to be alright. He has to! Harry won't rest until he is, no matter how little he understood of why draco was feeling this way.
No. Draco spent too much of his pathetic life being a burden on people. On his father, who wouldn't look him in the eye after he failed countless times on death eater missions. On his friends, who didn't really understand why he felt down all the time. On everyone else, who had to tolerate his stupid comments that he only needed to say to feel like he was superior. It never worked. He only ever felt weak and useless. He was even a burden on harry, too needy and clingy all the time. It's funny. Draco malfoy was never needy, but he wasn't Draco Malfoy with Harry. He was simply himself. He always wanted his full attention. He resented his other friends for getting to spend more time with Harry than Draco did. He resented the whole Wizarding world for supporting a 17 year old on a suicide mission. Although, he somehow managed to make that last one even harder on Harry. It would've been much too easy to convince himself that Harry didn't even like him and that he would rather be doing anything than spending his time in the chamber of secrets with Draco. But Harry would never have that. He always reassured Draco and held him while he cried about another one of his father's discipline sessions. So understanding, his Harry.
Harry couldn't help himself. He smiled. The journal had been filled with so much pain up until then that Harry had even started dreading reading it, but he knew he had to find the owner no matter what.
"Friends?" draco mumbled to himself before quickly and frantically jumping up adn running as fast as he could down the stairs and off the tower. He had to get away. He had to get as far away from Harry and his frantic calls as possible. He couldn't do this anymore. This week was to complete his task. Then, with his mother safe, he could die in peace.
A look of panic suddenly made itself known and Harry knew that look all-too-well, but he wouldn't let on that he knew what happened, not until Draco wanted to talk about it. He knew from experience that being forced to talk about something when someone wasn't ready could destroy them.
“I know you’re doing this to get out of your shell and I am very proud of you for it, but...I’m worried it might get too much for you to handle-” the brunette started, but was cut off by Draco.
Draco watched in horror as a bout of accidental magic from the clearly distressed Harry Potter shattered the entire box of potions, along with the two potions on the counter, sending most of their content onto Potter and the remaining onto him.
Harry knew, then , that even if his draco was in love with this other man, that Harry would still need him in his life. He  could just be a friend, even if the thought of that has his stomach in knots.
The witch placed a tentative hand on Harry's knee, then sighed and soothingly said "This is a self-induced coma with no apparent causes. It's a medical mystery until I can find out the reason he is in this state. As such, it is hard to say."
“Why would you ask me that? I thought I made my feelings very clear,” he hissed out. The brunette looked devastated at his response and a bit confused.
Draco snuck into Jashua's house once when the man wasn't there to take a look at one of the male pregnancy books, but he couldn't risk bookmarking the potion, so he wrote all the ingredients and process down and carried the paper around. One of the ingredients was too rare and growing the others was taking too long. Draco was determined, though and he walked around the neighborhood with a repaired bag he got from a garbage can, trying to gather as much ingredients as he could. He only prayed none of them would go bad before he had a chance to sneak back into Jashua's and make the potion. He didn't think he'd also have to worry about Harry talking him out of it. It seemed like a real possibility now that Harry knew just how to get Draco to show up.
Draco hated himself for thinking this. He hated that he just couldn't let Harry go. It was better for the both of them. Still, his legs followed Harry. He couldn't not know where Harry was going. He couldn't stop his heart's erratic beating at the thought that Harry was meeting someone else. That would be the only thing to truly break Draco.
OK. So, I know the tags say angst with a happy ending and this is, I swear. It's just that I didn't feel like this would make sense if I crammed it all into one part, so I am turning it into a series, with each part showing a different phase of Draco and Harry's life (his life when it comes to Draco) and having an ambitious ending, then the last part having a happy one. I am also thinking of adding a first part that shows their relationship in school, ending with the scene from the trials.
“I need to investigate this. Thank you for your input,” Harry said, using the indifferent tone they were taught to use during investigations, “There’s nothing I can say to prevent you from going to the prophet with-”
“They’re wrong!” Harry snapped, unable to comprehend what he was hearing, “I would’ve remembered marrying my childhood rival or...or conceiving a child with him. These are the only two ways a bond could form, right?”
"N-no! I w-won't let you do that either." he chokes out, "Y-you don't want this, Draco. Trust me. Please don't do this."
Draco sighed. He didn’t want to explain to his cute, innocent best friend why life just didn’t work like that. Then he really thought about Emmyl’s words. He didn’t want to invade his mate’s privacy, but Harry was just so devastated. Draco didn’t want to see him that upset ever again! It was his job to make his mate feel better, after all… Seeing Harry happy again was also a huge upside.
“Perhaps I cast the spell wrong,” Harry heard the officiate say loudly enough for everyone to hear. The same thing happened once he cast the spell, again, though; the veil refused to even come close to Harry. Ginny’s eyes watered and she instantly yanked her hands back and ran down the aisle and out the large doors, all the while crying her eyes out. Hermione got off her seat and followed the red-headed girl out. Harry watched the scene unfold as if he was an outsider, then shook his head and attempted to follow.
He hadn't even thought anything all the way through. He only remembered finding the fertility potion that Jashua had slipped into the blonde's drink before he took him that day harry ran into them, then taking a muggle pregnancy test, which work for males as well, and freaking one. He only knew that he had to get rid of it, but he didn't think about the process and the promise he made to Harry in return for the potion.
Draco seemed to take Harry's actions as a refusal. Desperation crept into his voice as his sobs grew louder and his arms wrapped around his stomach while he was pulling at his sleeves.
He knew he wouldn't break his promise to Harry, even if the next three days turn out to be absolute hell, he'll keep his word, if only to ensure that Harry would be there in case something like this happens again.
But Harry had heard and he had a horrifying thought of what Draco was planning to do. He reached out his hand only to have the blonde step back.
"Just... Keep going. I'll get there." he reassured the brunette with what he hoped was a steady voice. But Harry wasn't convinced and Draco could see he was reaching out for his wand, no doubt to cast a lumos. Then, Draco would be caught and he'd be on display, all faults and everything. He couldn't have that.
"because I want to protect you!" Harry yelled, then realized this was the last thing that Draco wanted to hear when a triumphant but sad smile plastered across the blonde's face.
Determination and compassion suddenly filled the older Draco as he watched his younger self jerk out of his thoughts at the sound of approaching footsteps.
"Why is my son not awake?" he asked the witch. The coldness of his voice made Harry shiver. Pomfrey actually glared at Lucius.
"You were speaking as though the world stopped when I left. Like you just couldn't move forward even though everyone else could."
Suddenly, the blonde felt a sharp, burning pain in his hands and turned to see that his fingertips were morphing into talons. He held in a gasp and shoved both of them under his thighs in an effort to hide them from Harry, who was still sniffling sadly next to the blonde. Draco looked up and saw that Harry didn’t seem to be convinced that the blonde cared about him. Draco’s whole body shook with a different kind of pain. He felt a strange prickling sensation flood everywhere within him, poking him under his skin. His entire body was begging him to do something, but he didn’t know what that was. Not knowing what else to do, he surrendered his body completely to his instincts, surprised when they caused him to lunge forward and wrap his arms around Harry, who thrashed in resistance. The blonde gasped again as he felt his skin radiate an odd kind of magic. Suddenly, his mate seemed to calm down considerably and stopped thrashing. Seconds later, Harry broke down, his entire body shaking wildly as he cried his eyes out, wetting Draco’s shoulder.
“Too bad!” Ron said loudly, “You’re letting criminals get away with a crime, Harry. What kind of Auror are you? Huh? What kind of person are you?! Do you not want your parents’ money back? How can you be so calm about this?!”
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts when he realized his Harry had tossed the cloak aside and was approaching Jashua with a furious expression on his face. Draco lunged at him, hiding him, protecting him, keeping him safe. It worked, even though Draco knew Harry could fight him off easily if he wanted to. But Harry seemed too happy about seeing Draco to worry about Jashua anymore. Draco's heart sank.
“I’ll report them, I will. Don’t worry, Harry. We’re getting all that money back. They won’t get away with this.”
"draco!" he yelled one last time. The blonde turned around looking annoyed and impatient. Harry didn't care. This one was important. "When can I see you again? Where? I need to know."
He didn't read into Harry's every move like he did now. He didn't think Harry was with him out of sheer pity and obligation. These feelings seemed to have grown after the war. And Harry wanted to delve deeper and find out what had caused them, but he had promised draco he wouldn't look at any memories after the trial and he honored that promise.
He expected it. He knew it would happen. So he wasn't too surprised when he found Harry apparting into their alley on the next Friday. He felt relieved. He felt awful.
Draco said nothing, staring down at his left sleeve, reminding himself why he had to do this, why he had to be so harsh with his perfect Harry.
Wanting Harry's forgiveness, Draco looked at what he had left. His breath caught. It was the journal Harry got him in third year to replace the one his father had destroyed. Draco had been so excited about it, he had shushed Harry completely and began to write in it right away. The brunette had stayed by his side, smiling and just staring at Draco lovingly like he couldn't believe they were together.
"No. Not until you talk to me." he replied firmly, expecting a fight. What he didn't expect was for Draco's shoulders to slum and his body to start shaking with fear.
"And what's your name, little guy?" Draco asked Scruffie in the most adorable of voices, continuing his assault on the puppy's belly as Scruffie wagged his tail.
Hey guys! I'm very sorry about how long it took to get this chapter out. Midterms are really taking it out on me and I didn't have time to write. I am going to try to update once a week though even while exams are going on. After that, you can expect more frequent updates again. Enjoy!
Then, finally, finally, he left on the fifth Monday. Harry almost leapt off his bed and apparated to the market he went to on the other side of town. He thought about it for a second, but couldn't focus on the logic. All he could see was Draco's panic and fear. All he wanted to do was take him home and tell him everything was going to be alright. So Harry apparated and went into the store. He didn't see Harry right away and Harry thought of running out before he does. Just as the thought crossed his mind, a fist collided with the side of his face.
“Sorry, dude. I don’t,” the boy said, then continued to walk. Draco groaned internally. He would have to approach another muggle. It took everything he had just to talk to that one! He should’ve brought a calming draught with him.
He accessed the locator spell, desperately hoping to find Draco before the injuries get worse or... Before he goes back to Jashua. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Draco was still in the house, but then was filled with dread at the implication of the blonde's actions. Was Draco truly that frightened of him?
Draco hated himself even more than he had in years when he saw Harry give a slight nod of understanding then ordered two meals and coffees. He looked back at Draco with a forced smile, which turned into a sad one as he started to speak.
By the end of his rambling session, Harry was pulling at his hair violently. Again. Draco had no idea what to say. Everything Harry just mentioned was true, but how would he even begin to answer the questions Harry had.
"what are you so afraid of?" he asked again, loudly. He knew he was messing it up again. He knew how much Draco hated being yelled at, but he couldn't stop for the life of him. He needed answers and he needed them three years ago during sixth year and two years ago after the trial and with every letter he sent. He needed them now!
"I don't want you to see." he repeated quietly. Only then did Harry really trace the source of all the blood and he couldn't keep his anger at bay anymore.
Suddenly, Harry caught sight of the psychology section and a thought came to his mind. He thought of Hermione and how she always turned to books for answers. He never used to do that, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
He awakened sometime later to find himself embraced by the blonde, who was murmuring "Please no. Please no. Please no."
He remembers thinking it would be a consolation to update Harry's parents, tell them what a perfect man Harry had grown up to be, but who was he kidding? His afterlife would never be spent at the same place as the two people who birthed his beautiful Harry. No. He would wind up in a place much darker, much hotter. He wound wind up with his father, who would still look at him like the world's greatest disappointment, but that is what he is, after all. It's what he deserves.
Harry wouldn't let up. Draco knew this. He loved it and he loved Harry. And he hated himself for loving it and loving Harry.
"Can you move?" Harry asked Draco in a voice so low that that he didn't even recognize it. The blonde flushed the toilet, then got up and took two steps. The second he was outside the stall, he collapsed and leaned on the wall for support. He looked at Harry with an apologetic gaze and shook his head.
"So, you never sent back replies to my letters asking me to leave you alone over and over until I stopped sending you any??"
When the blonde came back, Harry threw on a wide smile and shoved the jar towards him. Draco pulled out a random paper.
Terrified that he would get too close to someone who would just abandon him because of his three 'problems'.
Draco's own version of the memories weren't as bad as Harry thought they would be. They weren't exactly a hundred percent happy. Draco had been insecure and on edge the entire time, worrying that Harry would leave him and find someone more worthy of Harry's love. But, at least, he believed Harry loved him and he loved Harry back. That was something. It was everything.
The blonde didn’t even realize he was screaming the words out loud in a shrill voice until his mate turned a brighter shade of red and advanced towards Draco, who stepped back until they were both in the house then shut the door. Harry jumped when he heard the door close, presumably too drunk to be aware of what was happening around him. Then, he turned back towards Draco and started chuckling bitterly, then slurred.
He didn't even know how he got there, but suddenly, Harry was on the floor sobbing harder than he ever had in his entire life, touching Draco all over as if to reassure himself that he's real, silently begging him to forgive Harry for letting him walk away after the trials. He knew this would happen. He knew it would. He had had a feeling and he should always trust those. He did, but it was too late. He started to imagine what would've happened had the blonde been successful. Harry's last memory of him would have been reporters tearing them apart and him standing there looking like a ghost of who he once was. This all made Harry cry harder and suddenly the blonde was comforting him and hugging him , even though Harry was sure it was very painful for him. He didn't  mention leaving again until Harry was completely quiet and sniffling while tucked beneath Draco's chin and cuddling up to his chest.
The blonde knew that, logically, Harry’s words were true. It shouldn’t be expected of him to just accept workingon such short notice, but he just couldn’t bring himself to actually
Draco shook his head, as if that would make everything magically go away. This couldn’t be happening. Maybe it was just another one of those completely fabricated stories! But where did they get the picture then? Maybe he wasn’t that hurt! But then, why was Ron screaming like that? Weren’t they done being friends?
"Please, Draco?" Harry pleaded, not knowing what else to say to put Draco's worries to rest. They were true, after all. Draco was, in many ways, insufferable, but that was the disease, not his ex-lover and Harry had to remind himself of that before letting it show.
To his surprise, the blonde perked up immediately, sat back down, and began digging into his food. Harry smiled at him, but his heart radiated concern. It didn’t make sense that the blonde could be miserable one second then ecstatic the next. He needed to understand what was happening. He had to talk to Hermione about it the next day. He knew it was a breach of privacy, but he hoped Draco would never find out.
“He isn’t offering you very much considering how hard this position is. You don’t even get benefits,” the brunette said with a frown. Draco laughed.
He knew he couldn't speak to Draco when he saw him on the train, and he wasn't even expecting the blonde to acknowledge his existence in public, as much as it pained them both. But... The way that Draco had looked at him - like he was in pain over seeing Harry - told the brunette he had been caught. Draco had that look in his eyes, the 'I need to take care of you now' look, but it was mixed with a fury Harry had never seen Draco show before.
Harry was about to lie and say no, when he remembered their pact to be honest and how touched Draco was at Harry's normal attitude around him.
"It's alright." Harry told him, then placed a tentative hand on his shoulder, which the blonde flinched away from. Harry tried not to let that reaction hurt him.
Both Harry and Pomfrey stood completely still, narrowing their eyes at Lucius, astonished by his cold tone and insult.
After an agonizingly long bath, where Harry had to jerk Draco awake multiple times so the healing potions could continue to take effect, the blonde was, by all appearances, brand new. But Harry wasn't an idiot. He knew Draco would need some time before he would reach the mental state he'd had merely hours before, when he had left the alley happily and looked back at Harry once before proceeding down the street.
Draco’s eyes widened. How had he never noticed how beautiful Harry was before? His sparkling green eyes, his gorgeous, toned body, his unruly black hair. All the blonde wanted to do was be on Harry or under Harry. Anything! As long as he gets to touch the brunette right that second. His skin was starting to burn, itching for him to touch Harry, to taste him and make him moan in pleasure. Draco’s mind was blank. He couldn’t think of the camera or the potion or the fact that Potter was engaged to someone else. He couldn’t even remember his own vow to lose his virginity to the love of his life. All he could think about was Harry’s face, Harry’s skin, Harry’s arse, Harry’s abs, Harry, Harry, Harry.
Draco smiles in return. Not his sad smile, but a wide, genuine smile. He looks away for a moment and Harry fears that he might take off or worse, but then he looks back at Harry with a curious expression.
Draco said nothing, continuing to stare at his left sleeve, the mark underwhich the only thing that gave him enough strength to do this to his Harry.
Harry told himself it would be fine, that Draco would be fine. He had a good day, despite it all. This could be enough for Harry for now.
Harry willed himself not to cry at what he was hearing. He needed to leave before he had a complete breakdown. Now more than ever, he didn't want Draco to go back to Jashua. But he couldn't force him to stay and he couldn't leave without being sure that he would see the blonde again. There was only one way to go about this, even if the thought of what he was about to say brought him closer to a meltdown.
It came off as a lame question, but draco seemed satisfied. The thoughts didn't stop there, however.
"Y-you didn't like my cookies much after… S-so, I started to make you brownies. That's what I would've made for you if I had known you were hurting."
He couldn't tell Harry anything. Not about where he had been or what he was planning. It would devastate his Harry and the brunette deserved better than to spend his life trying to make Draco happy.
"It's alright" he said, relasing draco, then stepping closer to the chamber's enterance and holding out a hand, "Don't be afraid. Come with me. I'll protect you."
"You don't know, do you?" Jashua whispered, then laughed out loud. "Well, let me ask you another question, then, do you recognize this wand?"
"of course." he said quickly, not wanting the blonde to take back his friendship. Draco looked unconvinced.
1) Chapters 8 and 9 have been completely changed, so I'd suggest to go back and read them so you won't be lost.
Suddenly, the blonde couldn't hold back the gasp of air as his anxiety reached unbearable levels and Jashua took the opportunity to pour the liquid down Draco's throat. The Blonde was determined not to swallow and held his breathe until he passed out completely, with Jashua whispering in his ear, aiming Draco's head to continue looking at his dead ex-lover.
"Fine" he said loudly, then took a large bite of his sandwich and a sip of his pumpkin juice, "Happy?"
"Snap out of it, Draco!" he screamed, "I never sent you any bad letters. They were all filled with words describing our time together. I wanted to find you. I wanted to meet up and perhaps take things further. I was worried. I-I loved you. I never said anything bad to you. Ever! And if these letters hurt you, then rest assured they were not from me just as your responses were apparently not from you!"
There it was. Not 'potter'. Not 'harry'. But 'the great Harry potter'. This wasn't his draco talking to him. This is the cold, distant, hurtful malfoy he'd seen outside the trials. Could drugs affect someone even after they were out of their system?
The potion he chose is supposed to kill the feotus and remove it entirely from his body without any blood, so Harry shouldn't have had any reason to be this worried. Through it all, Draco remains in the sitting room, kneeling on the couch with an arm around his stomach and the other covering his eyes.
Suddenly, the blonde's fingers tightened around it and he looked up at Harry with a strange expression on his face.
But his mate had fallen asleep in his arms, calmed by the weird sensation that the veela was giving off. Draco gently laid him down on the couch, then crooned as he watched his beautiful, perfect mate sleep soundly. It took a couple of seconds for him to snap out of it and realize what he was doing was creepy, at which point he called Emmyl and asked him to take Harry to a guest bedroom and tuck him in.
"sorry, mate." he said, "I got in touch with a muggle friend recently. I am sure you've noticed how distracted I've been. The truth is this friend of mine meant a lot to me. He and I were very close at some point and he has this thing called major depressive disorder apparently and it was hard seeing him suffer. I am certain everything will be-"
"I don't know what you mean." Draco said slowly, as if speaking to a confused child. This only made Harry angrier.
So, he skipped the alley, wanting to hold Harry's hand for just a bit longer before he is forced to let it go forever. He besrly contained the tears when they came back to the alley. Draco needed to be strong. He needed to let Harry go, but Harry seemed so sad and Draco hated himself for doing that to his perfect Harry. He hid in the shadows, knowing that Harry would be back eitherway. It was clear the brunette wouldn't let this go anytime soon.
“Draco, I am telling you that you didn’t make me angry in any way. Does that make you feel better?” Harry asked, not knowing what else to say or do to make Draco’s suffering disappear.
Harry didn't seem to care that the blonde wasn't offering. He just grinned at the fact that Draco finally spoke and kept raving on about how amazing Draco's brownies are. The blonde blushed deeply, especially when other customers turned around to ask him for the recipe. He wrote it down on a napkin and passed it along, not saying anything.
"no!" Draco had sobbed, trying to keep his emotions in check. Jashua didn't like him being so needy.
Draco didn't need to wonder or worry for too long, though. A few minutes after he got home, Harry was knocking his door down. The blonde's heart broke when he saw the brunette. His mate’s face was almost red with fury, but the look he cast at Draco was the saddest one the blonde had ever seen.
Harry was enraged by the end of the entry, but then caught Ron's puzzled look and hastily smiled. He was more determined than ever to make this person his friend now, whoever they were.
The blonde instantly recoiled at Harry's soft tone, looked contemplatingly at him for a split second then took off, leaving behind his groceries and exiting the supermarket all together.
"Draco.." Harry started, not really knowing where he was going with this. He continued to fight the urge to pull at his hair as his hands dangled uselessly at his side. He sat on his knees next to the blubbering blonde not having any idea of how to make him feel better. They needed to discuss treatment options for Draco that day. Harry was determined that they do. He was still hopeful. This was just a setback. It had to be. Draco had to be alright.
It had been two weeks since draco stood Harry up. Even Ron wasn't finding it funny anymore that he keeps showing up to work 'hung over'. Him and Hermione kept obessesing over him like some child whose puppy just died. They never found out about him and draco and he couldn't bring himself to tell them how stupid he was to think it would last.
Draco thought he, too, would start hitting him if he could. Draco wouldn't blame him. He did fuck up the child's life.
Draco, now, smiled at the memory. He was right to be insecure and clingy in Hogwarts. If he could go back, he would never let Harry leave his side at all. Not when he knew how everything was going to turn out.
Draco felt very guilty about his threat, even if it was true. He knew the only way Harry would help him is if he thought he was saving him. But still, this was Harry and he had done nothing wrong to be manipulated like this.
You could just stay here now. You could stay here forever if you want to. I don't want you hurt and I don't want you around anyone or anything that will make you feel bad. I am serious. I like your company and I would like it if you stay. You know, if you want to. But I repsext your wishes and your boundaries nonetheless and I won't seek you out if you don't want me to. Just please tell me you want me to be a part of your life. Please!"
Harry smiled widely as the idea came to him. Hermione would find a way to solve this. She always found a way. In fact, the young witch was known for her determination when it came to the ‘mystery medical field’. Of course, those mystery cases almost always turned out to be some kind of curse that the patient hadn’t been aware of, but, surely, Hermione could also find out how to cure whatever disease Draco had as well.
"I don't know!" he cried out, trying to protect Harry's identity at all costs. Harry could normally protect himself, but Jashua wasn't like any other opponents. He's smart and manipulative and deceiving. He could get his opponents to knowingly walk in to his house unarmed and think it is for their own good. That is what he did to Draco, after all.
The blonde felt at a twinge at the insinuation that he wasn't important enough for his mate to tell him that he'd leave him early. But that didn't really matter. He was more worried about where his mate was and whether he was alright.
"You know what's in there, myrtle! You know no one can see it! Please don't drive me crazy and just tell me if you've moved it."
"I could take vertiserum." Harry quickly added, "When we are together. Just so you know I am being truthful, that I am not lying to you. Then, would you believe me?"
The blonde watched, sorrow spreading through his very core, as Harry got up and left the room without another word, looking devastated.
"Do you really not remember anything?" he asked Draco softly, trying his best not to somehow scare the blonde off. He needed to get help.
There it was. Draco was caught. He was bad again and he needed to be punished. Harry is bad for Draco and Jashua needs to protect him like he always has.
"You heard me." Draco whispered looking at the floor. "I never sent you any replies. You must be mistaken."
He sprinted up the stairs and was panting by the time he was in front of the room. Harry had the door closed. The brunette lifted his head from his arms the moment Draco walked in, then smiled tearfully at him. He had his knees against his chest and his head resting on the arms wrapped around his legs. He looked so small, so sad, so unbelieving of what he was seeing. Draco felt a momentary pang of guilt for doing this to his perfect Harry but willed it away. Harry had told him it was fine. Harry had extended the last branch. The past was past and they were together again. It would be fine. In this moment, everything would be fine.
He arrived at the location to find that Draco was nowhere in sight. Suddenly, the reality of being late hit him. He had no way of contacting the blonde and Draco was already hesitant about the friendship and wouldn't want to meet him again if he thought Harry didn't want to see him. What if Draco had arrived hopeful and left devastated after seeing that Harry hadn't shown? Would he lose Draco because he was ten minutes late? He was snapped out of his thoughts by the sounds of quiet sobbing and looked immediately to his left to see Draco laying across the ground next to the dumpster sobbing his eyes out, his arms covered in blood. His heart sank and he remembered the story behind the blonde's first suicide attempt.
Draco stared wide-eyed at Harry as if he didn't believe what Harry had just done. Then he cleared his throat.
“Huh?” Harry asked, confused. Malfoy furrowed his brows, still saying nothing about the nature of the purchase.
"It's not like that, Ron. There was a reason I didn't tell you about him. But I will. As soon as he's better, I'll tell you all of it. I'll introduce you. You'd love him if you get to know him. I am sure you would. You will."
Harry hates himself for two reasons 1) his cock twitching at the idea of getting to touch his Draco again, despite the state the blonde was in, 2) he should've found him sooner and fixed him before it got this bad.
2) This chapter and the next will be very Harry-centric, and they will end in them becoming more than friends. That's mainly because of the tournament and how emotional Harry always becomes after having to be with the Dursleys for three months.
Draco knew that Harry doesn't care about him and didn't want to help him. So he made it about saving instead and, of course, Harry immediately withdrew his rejection.
Without even realizing it, Harry was asking him all those questions, unable to hold back. The blonde  bursts into tears once more and hides his face in his hands, shivering all over. Harry's heart breaks at the sight.
Harry returned to the alley every night. He searched the prophet for any sightings of the blonde. He looked through knockturn alley, but no one had seen Draco come or leave.
He almost cast the spell right then and there, just to get a sense of what to do to help draco. But he couldn't. The words were frozen in his head at the thought of having to endure the same suffering as yesterday. Was draco going through that all the time?
He wanted all of that, but, to his horror, Draco could feel himself wilting, even in Harry's touch and that was what convinced him that he was completely and irreparably broken.
He told himself neither of those things would happen, that he was too withdrawn to feel anything anymore. How could he not fall back in love with Harry? Every single second spent in the brunette's presence made Draco just...feel. Suddenly, Harry was all he could think about. Again. And coming back to Jashua's treatment only made him long for the brunette more. It made him hate Jashua more.
Draco knows it was a mistake the moment a dark shadow crossed Harry's eyes. He instantly kicked himself mentally for thinking he could get away that easily. No. Harry needed to make sure that Draco was saved and fine. Well.. He can pretend for two more days if that's what it takes to get Harry to leave him alone.
Draco was stunned. Was Harry serious? He was really giving Draco control? This couldn't be...there had to be some kind of catch. Or maybe he'd give the blonde everything then take it away just to torture him. Yeah. That sounds right. Harry wants Draco here. The blonde didn't need to enjoy being there so that Harry can be satisfied. He just needed to stay with Harry and then Harry could do whatever he was planning to.
"Could I, at least, throw that away?" he asked, already reaching out to take the empty vial from Draco.
Upon seeing Draco's furious expression and hearing his huff of disapproval, Harry chuckled and dragged the protesting Draco into the place, then sat him on a very comfortable booth, sitting right next to him and effectively trapping him for the day. Draco sunk lower into the booth, trying not to feel anything towards Harry's persistence.
Draco silently walked back to the kitchen, with his head down in shame. He didn’t want to look up and see that everyone was staring at him. This was humiliating enough. He quickly came back and told the customer the specials, wanting him to order, eat, and leave as soon as possible.
" What I am saying, Mister Malfoy, is that it seems wild magic is at play here. Someone is trying to hide this boy's injuries and they seem to be doing a fine job of it."
You said you'd had fun! W-why do you want to leave? I don't understand! Please explain it to me so I can convince you to stay."
“I really need this job, Potter. Please don’t mess it up for me,” he whispered, continuing to look down at the counter.
Harry took a deep breath, or he tried to anyway. He couldn’t get any air through the lump in his throat. His entire body was frozen to the spot and he felt like everything was spinning around him. What was happening to him? This was supposed to be easy, wasn’t it? It was supposed to be the happiest day of his entire life. Why was it so hard for him to just go downstairs already? People were waiting for him. Ginny would be walking down the aisle any minute now. Imagine how pissed she’d be if he wasn’t there!
Draco didn't even move from where Harry had thrown him, too petrified to do anything. The memories were still playing in his mind and, no matter how hard he wanted to apologize to Harry, not a single muscle in his body would bloody work. He couldn't even move his hands to stifle the sobs that were escaping his mouth. He was barely aware of his surroundings, of Harry rushing over to him the second he shoved him away, whispering 'its going to be alright' in his ear.
After the dementor attack on the quidditch field and him fainting yet again after hearing his mother's screams, Harry just wanted to be alone. And where was he about to achieve that if not in moaning Myrtle's bathroom? Apparently, someone else had had the same idea, but by the time Harry had calmed his breathing and exited the stall, this other person was gone.
"I-I" the blonde starts and lifts his head. Upon seeing the look in Harry's eyes, however, he suddenly straightens up, and all emotions leave his face. Harry barely suppresses a growl of frustration.
He knew the question was coming but he didn't want to answer it. It made him feel stupid to have trusted anyone other than Jashua and let them break him. He mumbles something intelligible.
"oh my poor baby. You're very confused." Jashua had said, gripping Draco's hand tightly, "from what I understood you were feeling down and talking about ending your life. He is the savior after all. He felt obligated. That much is clear."
Important note: Chapter 14 has been changed entirely. I'd suggest you go back and read it before moving forward so you won't be lost.
"No!" he screamed, tears filling his eyes as he rushed towards the letter, grabbed it carefully, then held it out to Harry. "Why would you do that, Harry?! Please, fix it! Please!"
“Yes, you would! You would.” Harry sobbed out, interrupting him, “Everybody does. Every-everyone betrays me and manipulates me and hurts me and I-I try to give them the b-benefit of the-the doubt, but I-I always end up a-alone.”
"I think you're lying. You want me to be truthful with you, but you're lying to me. You're trying to manipulate me. I am a lot of things, Harry, but I am not stupid."
He always used to cast an invisibility charm on the pile before Draco arrives, but in the haste of this occasion, he had completely forgotten. Harry saw the realization dawn on Draco's face and knew he had been caught. Draco knew about the locator spell, about the detection spell, about the thought and emotions spell. Draco knew everything Harry had done and was now looking at him with fear and hatred.
With that, Harry was gone. And draco ran out of the place like it was on fire, then found an abandoned alley where he pulled opened his bag, looking for the shard of glass he had acquired the night he left knockturn alley. His heart sank. One of his ingredients had rotten, effectively ruining the others. He tossed them all out with a sob, then yanked his sleeve back and started to cut deep lines along his mark, the physical pain not relieving him of the hurt look on his Harry's face, but giving him enough strength to get up afterwards and leave the alley, searching for more ingredients.
He felt as though he couldn't breathe and he couldn't, for the life of him, move or say anything, even though he knew Harry was frantically pacing around him, trying to speak with him.
“Yes, thank you! I’ve been looking forever!” the blonde cheered. The guy nodded, then leaned in slightly and whispered.
Afraid he'd say the wrong thing and people would stare at him silently like his father's guests used to.
Draco felt his eyes become wet at Harry’s hurtful words. How could his mate think he didn't like him? Draco loves Harry so much it
"Draco, you're dying. I can't let that happen. You haven't eaten. You can barely stand without falling back down. You- you look dead already. I can't stand by and watch this. I am just going to get Pomfrey and she'll know what to do. She'll make you better. Don't you want that?" Harry had to restrain himself from shouting. Surely, Draco was taking the piss if he was asking why Harry needed to do this. Does the blonde really not realize how sick he is?
"do those words look like they belong to someone who ever cared for you?" he had asked softly, pushing the letter towards the blonde. He  shoved it away violently, not wanting to see anymore of it, then a terrifying thought occured to Draco.
"I can't, Harry." and Harry felt guilty yet again, but he knew this was important. He knew if he didn't say the right thing now, if would be over, so he cast that's blasted spell again and was immediately conflicted and in pain.
Only when he got to his dorm did it occur to Harry: the last entry was dated back two years. Malfoy was fine. He was. Wasn't he? Harry should just leave the journal for the blonde to find then get on with his life. No one said Malfoy still felt the same way. No one said he was still thinking about...
Harry smiled widely, thinking Draco had read his loving letters and was about to break up with that arse Jashua, who kept them from Draco. But when Draco looked up, he had tears in his eyes.
Draco shrieked and stood suddenly, banging his head against the sinks. Harry chuckled, then dragged draco out from under the sinks, loving his child - like attitude.
“What happened yesterday?” Harry asked softly, breaking the uncomfortable silence that had been surrounding them both for about ten minutes as they ate breakfast. Draco’s fork stopped in midair, then the blonde put it down, sighing and suddenly looking nervous. Harry felt guilty about bringing it up, but he had to! He was freaking out. He knew he should be more patient and give Draco space. It was what the blonde had always done for him, after all. But Harry just wasn’t wired that way. He couldn’t just know that something was wrong with Draco and not ask what it is or not even try to make him feel better. Suddenly, he respected Draco more than ever before for giving the brunette space when he needed it, not that Harry was going to do the same now. He needed to help!
"Are you really sure you want to see me again, Harry? This isn't some kind of phase. I don't want you to save me. I will always think the way I do and I will always go back to Jashua. Are you prepared to accept that?"
At this thought, Harry only cried harder. He couldn't stand it. He couldn't bear to hear draco's mind being so cruel to his beautiful ex-lover who was frantically trying to comfort him, saying things that didn't reach harry's ears from around the clapping noises and vicious thoughts.
"when are you going to admit defeat draco? You're powerless. You're just a sad little boy without his magic wand or his mommy and daddy to protect him. My father was the leading witness in their cases. He sealed those monsters' fates, he did. I watched them get the soul sucked out of them. It was beautiful. They got what they deserved and so will you. You're already broken. No money. No prospects. No friends. Nothing. You're nothing, Draco. You're worse than nothing. You're the reason many are dead. You're the reason the great Harry Potter is dead. You did that to him. You're just my toy now. How does that feel? The great Draco Malfoy reduced to someone's bitch. You have no idea how much it turns me on to see you like this.. No control."
He couldn't even get Harry a birthday present or send him letters or surprise him with treacle tarts on Halloween like he used to.
“What are you on about, Harry? Are you really suggesting that I explore and treat an illness I know nothing about without seeing the patient even once? I cannot do such a thing.”
The blonde gave the red-head a grateful look, then instantly raced to Harry’s side once Ron left the room.
Draco knew this thing with Harry wouldn't last long. He woke up on the third day in Harry's arms and it felt wonderful. That is, until he remembered that he was nothing, that he was nobody. He now knew Harry didn't think so. Afterall, he could've hardly fought the potion and changed the memory. Could he? Would he go through that much trouble just to help Draco? Draco was fine, though. It was a bad few weeks and they've past and so will this.
"I haven't been able to eat one of those without you having the other half. Care to indulge me?" he asked, desperately hoping Draco doesn't interpret it as a pity offering.
"Scruffie." Harry answered, still in awe of the situation, and not wanting to say anything to upset Draco who was finally, finally, smiling, "his owner is on a long vacation and asked for someone to look after him."
The blonde heard his footsteps, looked up, then smiled widely, ran towards Harry, hugged him tightly, and pulled away starting to rant.
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts when he saw that Harry was exiting Ron’s office and quickly making his way over to their own office a bit slowly, looking a bit nervous. Once he noticed that Draco could see him, though, he smiled widely and hurried into the office.
Even when they were minutes away from the game, Harry only found himself to be more anxious, having jumped to steady the blonde after Draco had stumbled for no reason on the field. The blonde's eyes instantly snapped to where his father was watching the scene intently.
Instantly, boxes of basically everything that Harry liked to eat appeared around them without Draco doing anything, and Harry beamed at him for the thought, but still had no appetite.
“Hermione, please. He means a lot to me, alright? I know he might have gotten used to his condition, but if there is something, anything, that could help him, I want to know so I could help him,” Harry begged, not knowing how else to convince the witch. He thought he heard Ron snorting and saying ‘Careful there buddy or people might start thinking you’re gay for ‘im.’ He ignored the red-head and kept trying to stare Hermione down. She seemed to absorb what he said and nodded slightly. Harry sighed in relief.
"Ghosts can't move things, Draco." myrtle told him slowly as if speaking with a child, then let out a small sob at the reminder of her limited capabilities.
The blonde seemed frantic, pulling at his sleeves and looking all over Harry's body again. Then, he took Harry’s hands and placed them on his own chest, sitting the brunette down against the wall again, just the opposite of how they had been sat before leaving for the summer. Draco smiled at Harry and started to whisper shakily.
They all just treated him like a freak, like he's always been treated and he could risk Hermione and Ron being that way. It would just destroy him. But this other person seemed to understand everything so well.
The blonde sighed and let his hand linger over hers for a second then sat on the ground crossed legged. She joined him and listened intently.
Suddenly, it was after the trials and Harry's heart was breaking and he was silently begging younger draco not to leave him, that he needed him to comfort Harry just like that day in the cupboard, that a lot of people he'd known had died or gotten into relationships and that he felt absolutely alone.
"You startin' ta sound like me." he heard a voice say. Perhaps it's his. He didn't know when it happened or why but he was saying the first things that came to mind and couldn't stop. "all clingy and you don wanme to die n'stuff."
Harry always yelled at Draco and Draco deserved it. He was such an idiot. He needed to get back to Jashua and beg him for forgiveness. Those three days had been just what Draco had feared: a huge lie.
He wasn't a burden anymore. He had his vault money. Harry was right. He understood that what was taken from him wasn't supposed to be. He knew of the Black's finances. Half the vault would keep him going forever. He was finally enough for Harry and for himself… for now. The rest, he could figure out later.
“I mean...I would understand why given the symptoms you’ve listed. Perhaps I can give you a set of questions to ask him, then.”
Harry didn't want this. He didn't want Draco feeling like his own pleasure didn't matter, but apparently, he had pushed Draco away a little too roughly in his haste to prove it and make it all worse. His heart clenched as his lover laid at the foot of the bed unmoving with a terrified look in his wet eyes.
Draco simply smiled then got back in the bed, when Harry suddenly cast a lumos. He had been doing that all night. Waking up, casting the spell, then, after he made sure Draco was there and in one piece, cast a nox and cuddled up to the blonde again with a happy sigh.
So, he really hated what he had to do once they finally arrived at the coffeeshop. Harry let go of his hand and held open the door for him, only to frown deeply when Draco made no move to get in.
Knowing Draco would immediately ask to be obliviated if he senses for one second that he was, indeed, being a burden on Harry.
"No. And it wasn't a child, whether you want to hear it or not. Five weeks... It can't hear or see and it doesn't have organs and stuff. Please see reason with this. You only removed some cells that would've turned into a child eventually, but they weren't yet. It wasn't murd-"
"I've simply looked everywhere for it! I don't know how I could be so stupid!" he wailed, then placed his face in his hands again.
Harry apparated them both to the alley. Draco asked him to wait in a corner, but he couldn't risk the blonde running away afterwards, so he stayed where he can see Draco, but couldn't hear the conversation. Draco pointed out that no dealer would come out if there was an auror in sight, so Harry cast a not-me-not charm and waited. As promised, Draco returned to Harry with one of his sad smiles plastered across his face. Without warning, Harry had him back at the house with all the doors and windows locked and every sharp object in the house removed within seconds. The blonde seemed surprised, but shrugged, uncorked the vial and gulped it down in one go.
Jashua threw a wooden wand on the floor in front of Draco and the blonde immediately looked towards the sound and gasped. It was.. It was...
" fine! That wouldn't be ideal. It wouldn't even be nice, but I told you I want you around. I want to be in your life, even if just as a friend. Can't you believe that? And leave thoughts of the future for the future?" Harry asked desperately, willing Draco to just... Stop.
Draco's hole was leaking blood and semen onto the tub floor and it looked like someone had ripped him open. His back had extensive bruising and his chest and stomach were purple, which proved that his ribs were affected as well. His wrists and legs and cock and bullocks were all deep purple, like the blood was trapped there for some reason. They had magical fields around them. Harry would recognize the spell anywhere. Jashua was binding Draco to the house, causing the binds to tightened more as Draco went further and further away from it. Harry was surprised his limbs and cock hadn't fallen off by the way they looked.
Draco giggled, rolling his eyes as Harry sat on the edge of the bed, holding an envelope, and suddenly looking kind of nervous.
Harry blushed at the statement, but continued to just be there, unmoving, content to do so through the cramps and restlessness if that was what Draco needed from him.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked him, praying he would give an honest answer. He eyed the vial of vertiserum that he hadn't taken yet and, for the first time, wished their situations were reversed. Apparently, he didn't need it though, because Draco started talking instantly.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, sighing and not really having the energy to comfort Draco. It had been a really horrible day and it hurt that the blonde hadn’t even asked Harry how he felt about the suicide tournament. Draco looked up at him in disbelief through red-rimmed eyes.
When Harry returned to the sitting room, he opened his mouth to apologize for the thousandth time when suddenly draco lunged off his side of the couch and onto Harry, clasping their lips together, holding onto Harry desperately as if he never wanted to let go. Harry sunk into the kiss and melted. It had been far too long. He knew that much. He had been so frantic in moving them to the bedroom and getting Draco's clothes off that he had forgotten to undo the mind-link spell. He only noticed when his hand flew to Draco's groin and he was assaulted with a memory that wasn't his own, a horrifying one. Suddenly he was standing in the corner of a small sitting room, watching as Jashua cupped draco's crotch through his trousers. Draco moaned and shook his head. It wasn't a sound of pleasure. Somehow, the moan sounded panicked.
" D-did the doctors say anything?" Harry asked him, hoping the blonde wouldn't freak out at the forwardness of the question.
"where are you going to go?" he had asked, frustrated, pulling at his hair to find something to do with his hands that didn't involve reaching out to touch Draco, whose life had just shattered and who was looking calmly at Harry, as if it were any other day.
"What the bloody hell is your problem? I-" Harry starts, but cuts himself off when he sees Draco recoil.
Harry’s eyes widened. Where had that thought come from? He wanted to do this. He wanted to marry Ginny.
"M-money. Fifty galleons. And I N-need to get to knockturn alley and back home without being seen. M'not a-allowed in the Wizarding world anymore, remember?"
"interesting." he murmured, "tell me. Is this not the same guy you had a relationship with in hogwarts who used to indulge in your ridiculous needs and enable them."
The blonde paled at Harry's words and let go of his hands completely, wrapping his arms around himself.
"My appearance has nothing to do with the situation at hand. If you choose not to believe me, then that is your right. Eitherway, I am staying here as promised, so if I am lying to you, I'll begin to experience withdrawals at some point and then you'll know."
"It's not the same." the blonde whispers back and Harry nods in understanding, though he seems crushed. Draco is astonished that Harry doesn't press the matter further. And for a split second, he thinks the brunette might finally, finally understand where Draco is coming from. That is, until he speaks again.
"No!" Harry shouted, filled with rage at the words he was reading, not aware of the people around him stopping and staring at him.
Harry’s chest clenched at the blonde’s words and at the look of sheer despair on Draco’s face. He wanted to help Draco like Draco had been helping him. He wanted to take his pain away, but none of the blonde’s words made any sense to Harry. How could he help fix a problem when he didn’t even know what it was?! Then, it hit him.
Draco tries to fight his demons when he gets traumatic flashbacks during sex. Harry, as usual, has no idea what to do.
But seeing the kindness behind Harry's eyes, sensing his love, all the effort he was putting into just making Draco better… It was all too much. How could he have thought that he deserved that? How could he have forgotten all the horrible things he had done? Was he that selfish? It seemed so.
Draco was worried sick. Harry had left to get a pen from his best friend and never returned. He even went to the red-head himself, but all he got was a "sod off, Malfoy. He doesn't need to tell you where he's going all the time. Maybe he just left early."
"Hey Ron?" he called out to his friend, who was sprawled across the adjacent mattress. The redhead only groaned in response. "Did you have another friend right before hogwarts? Like someone from a pureblood family perhaps?"
"no. He did. I know he did." he had said frantically, trying to summon images of their happy times together, only to come up with the hateful words of Harry's letters.
"P-please?" he wailed, "I-I have no one else. Maybe I don't des-deserve anyone else, but I-it's done N-nothing wrong. It's not its fault I am s-so broken. Please. I b-beg of you. H-help me, harry."
" You could still have it again!" Harry screamed frantically, hovering near the door to prevent the blonde from leaving even though Draco had made no attempt to go near the exit and could not leave the Wizarding world without Harry, eitherway.
Draco seemed escastic as he ate, like he hadn't tasted real food in decades. Harry would've normally been content just watching him moaning at the taste with a wide smile on his face and a spark of light in his eyes. But he wasn't. The arms of the clock ticking where like shards of glass digging into every inch of his body, ticking away as his limited time with the blonde made itself known.
It didn't take that long for Harry to discover a spell of permenant occlumency on certain memories. It was only a phone call to Hermione that found him knowing it. Suddenly, he beat himself up for calling the witch instead of dragging him time out with Draco and searching for the spell, himself. It didn't matter. He needed Draco to leave as soon as possible. He couldn't imagine what his huge boyfriend would do to him  if Harry kept him for even longer.
There it was. His confession. Harry pitied draco. Harry never loved him. Harry had spent all this time with him out of discomfort at the thought of telling him he wanted to break up. Harry was humiliated by him.
Harry starts pulling at his hair once again, a tactic he adopted after starting his relationship with Draco during third year. The blonde git sure could be frustrating at times, but he was never this broken and bloody confusing! Harry has no idea what to do or say, so he goes with his gut, hoping Draco gives him any kind of answer to the questions running through his head. He starts with the most obvious.
"Y-you don't have to, Harry." the blonde informed him, but Harry didn't think twice before gulping the contents down.
“So, you’re not dying?” Draco asked, his smile slowly returning and his eyes lighting up. Harry’s heart seemed to leap at the scene and he nodded happily, glad he got the blonde out of his needy, panicked state early this time. But, as he thought this, the smile on the blonde’s face instantly vanished and Harry growled internally.
"Perhaps, then, my parents would've been alive. I am not blaming you, though. You're too kind and you've wasted your time with me. I can never repay you. Anything that has happened since then was all my fault. It's all my fault."
"No!" Draco screamed, shaking his head, tears falling down his cheeks, "Please don't do this, Harry. I told you I would eat and I did! I wasn't lying to you. I want to get better, but not th-there not with anyone forcing me to. I'll get better on my own. Please-"
He didn't plan on showing himself to Harry, ever, but what else could he do when he found Harry wandering to Jashua's neighborhood?
He's not being possessive . He's not. If this had happened to Hermione or Ron, he wouldn't have reacted so greatly. Sure, he'd be concerned, but he wouldn't count it as a personal failure. No. He'd only do that with Draco, who he had promised to protect no matter what when he found out about Lucius's abuse. Of course, he couldn't protect Draco back then, but he had another chance at the trials and let him walk away.
"Finite" he said, pointing his wand to himself. When nothing happened, he drank the potion and stated clearly. "I am Harry James Potter. I am not Polyjuiced. I am not wearing a glamour. I swear."
The blonde exhaled in relief, then opened his other hand and gave Harry the vial to discard. he took it quickly and vanished it, then smiled at his ex-lover who was already showing signs of improvement. He briefly wondered if Draco was faking and his thoughts were still clouding his judgment, but scowled at himself for even thinking about casting the connection spell again. He couldn't do that to Draco. They need to trust each other if whatever this was was going to work out.
“Me...my illness. It’s the same thing,” the blonde said bitterly, then buried his face in his arms. Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He didn’t want to suggest healers or pester Draco for details again. The brunette remained sullen and quiet for a few minutes before determination shone in his eyes. Maybe talking just wasn’t the answer. Draco wasn’t going to give him any useful answers anyway. Harry was a bit upset that the blonde wouldn’t confide in him, but, deep down, he understood. Everyone had things they’d rather not talk about. Harry hated it when people forced things out of him. Why was he doing the same thing now?
"I didn't know you were such a dog person." Harry teased, intending for a light-hearted conversation. He failed miserably.
It took Draco a while to stop crying into the plate, especially because Harry didn't comfort him. Draco wasn't used to that. Harry always comforted him when he was upset, no matter what.
Many apologies for not posting yesterday. My life has been all over the place. I'll try to keep up with the 'one chapter a day' thing from now on. Here's the chapter we've all been waiting for (Draco starts getting better). I am used to writing Angsty endings and Angst in general so please bear with me through what I hope will be non-cliche fluff. And please if Draco's progress or Harry's responses seem a bit unrealistic, let me know. I am always open to changing chapters, sometimes entirely. Enjoy!
"You do, don't you?" he nudged gently, trying to get the blonde to eat guilt-free, "Then you also remember that I couldn't get you anything, right? I wanted to. I wanted to get you everything you wanted but I simply didn't have the means. A-are you mad at me for that? Did you think *I* was some sort of burden?"
It didn't matter what Harry thought anyway. Draco couldn't stay there. It wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be fair for Harry. Harry has everything to offer and Draco has nothing.
It became worse after he saw Draco's torso and the bruises left there by Jashua, he assumed, and the scars that Harry had inflicted upon him when Draco was being controlled and had no idea what was happening. Harry didn't mean to look at the blonde with digust. The feeling had been toward himself and the blonde's so-called 'loving' boyfriend. But Draco seemed to have absorbed the digust completely and aimed it at himself as he shrank away from Harry, curled up into a ball, and started sobbing his eyes out.
“Oh. Y-you said that a long time ago. We’ve gotten closer since then, and I thought-” he started, but Draco cut him off.
"Draco, none of that was me. I swear it!" Harry said, starting to pull at his hair at awkward angles.
Without waiting for permission, Draco flipped Harry over and swallowed him whole in one go, trying his best not to gag around Harry's thick and long cock. Harry arched up and groaned, but Draco placed his hands on either side of Harry's hips to keep him steady. He tried his best to keep Harry distracted from the tears landing on his groin and cupped his balls, squeezing and massaging them. It seemed to have worked, since Harry put both his hands on draco's head and gently pulled his hair.
"you know you're leaning on the door for the chamber of secrets, right?" Harry asked after a few moments of silence.
Harry came out of his thoughts to see that Draco was openly sobbing. He seemed to be trying to hold it back given how quiet he was being. He felt awful.
"As per my understanding, oagreement was that I stay here for three days. So, I am allowed not to talk the entire time if I don't want to."
"Draco, it's not that. I just think you're cute when you overreact." Harry said hoping the blonde would blush at the compliment then move on. Draco wasn't having it.
"Sorry about the pain potion. I know you said you didn't want any but I freaked out, whatever you took was causing you so much pain. I didn't know what else to do. Do you forgive me?"
Draco was screeching by the end of it and Harry instantly moved to comfort Draco with a hug, when Scruffie suddenly jumped on Draco, frightening the sobbing boy. He yelped and Scruffie just shook his tail and began licking away his tears. Harry was afraid of Draco's reaction, given the past presence of werewolves in his home at full moons and the scars he saw on Draco's body that resembled a wolf's scratches. But, to his surprise, Draco started to giggle and began to pet Scruffie as soon as the dog laid down between them on the couch. Harry had meant to teach him to stop doing that, but the dog was just so damn cute and his puppy eyes didn't help Harry say no.
Draco was a monster. He had reeled Harry back in and now they were both miserable. Harry needed to forget about Draco and the blonde still couldn't understand how the brunette had any love left for him.
“Mate, I am just trying to help you.” he heard his friend say firmly, then felt the couch dip next to him, “If you really don’t want to do anything about it, at least talk to the bank. You shouldn’t have to pay a dime to them, not after they neglected to make sure the Dursleys were following your mum’s wishes. Don’t you think?”
"I didn't mean it. You have to know that, Draco. I don't hate you and I didn't back then, not really. You haven't ruined me. I am just.. Yours. You're not insufferable. I only suffer when I am away from you." Harry whispered and Draco eyed him for a second before setting him back down on the other end of the couch where he was immediately assaulted by Scruffie, sniffing him, making sure he was alright.
“Mr. Potter, all these documents are confidential and so is anything that pertains to them,” the officiate said harshly. Harry gulped at the sudden change of tone.
Harry's breathe hitched, but he fought to control himself. He needed Draco to say the words so he could really help him.
After the dog was finished he lunged at Harry. For a second, the brunette was afraid scruffie would attack him, but the dog simply pinned Harry to the floor and started to lick his face. Harry had planned to come by to feed the dog daily, but upon playing with him and petting this lovely creature, Harry didn't have the heart to leave him, so he left a note with his muggle phone number, saying he was a friend of someone who was in the ward and had overheard her while visiting. With a twist, he apparated with the dog to his home and unleashed him to check out the house.
His voice is angry by the end of his rant and Harry doesn't know how he manages to switch his tones so quickly. He waves it off as a result of the obvious addiction that the blonde is denying.
He was snapped out of his thoughts by Draco's soft moaning. Slowly, his eyelids fluttered and soon, Harry was gazing into sobered silver eyes. It was the first glimpse he'd had of his real Draco since hogwarts. He loved it.
"he.. Felt obligated?" draco whispered. He finally had it. The missing piece of the puzzle. The explanation behind why Harry loved him: he simply didn't.
"Listen to me, potter." Harry flinched at the use of his last name, but draco continued, horrified at the idea of Harry finding out about his tasks and the mark and how the dark lord was threatening to kill his mother if he doesn't succeed. "You will let me leave and you will leave me alone afterwards. You will not talk to me or look at me and you will pretend none of this ever happened."
Harry thoughts were cut off by the sound of the floo coming alive. He immediately went downstairs to check if Jashua somehow found out and had come to show Harry a piece of his mind. If that were the case, Harry wouldn't let the man leave his home in one piece.
"I sucked people in by making them pity me. I-I never deserved your kindness. I forced myself on you and you were too nice to say no."
Harry’s heart stopped at those words. He hadn't heard them, but, from the guy's lip movement and Draco's face going pale, the brunette was sure that the guy had said these words. He didn’t know when he had gotten up and marched over to the guy's table, but he was there and the guy was looking at him, wide-eyed.
Harry didn’t want to show him the paper. It was too embarrassing and private. That was the whole reason that he went to the smallest, least-known apothecary in the wizarding world. Of course, Malfoy just
"You threw it up!" Harry screamed and Draco flinched, but Harry couldn't find it within himself to care. The blonde was too good at this. Harry had already almost folded three times just by looking at Draco. He couldn't let himself be manipulated. "And-and it wasn't you who ate, even! You were trying to get away from me, if you recall. You were trying to break your promise. I had to force those cookies down your throat and don't you dare claim otherwise. If- if you wanted to get better you wouldn't have made up some excuse about that letter. I can see your wand under the sink, Draco! You could've fixed it here, but you were trying to run. Why? And then you lied about having a wand. Why would you do any of that if you had any intention of getting better? The answer is simple. You don't."
Harry kept smiling despite his panicked thoughts. They hand exchanged rings and were now holding hands, waiting for the officiate to officially bond them
"Or there is the more simple explanation that there is nothing wrong with the boy and that the game has taken a lot out of him. He's been training at the manor on weekends, as I requested from the headmaster and this has often occurred. He sometimes does not wake up for days. There is nothing more to it. Healers have confirmed that it is a result of stress on his body. The boy is just weak."
Just the thought of that brought him back to the same conclusion he often had: I am a terrible person.
Harry nodded slowly, even though he didn't really understand. There were too many things he didn't understand.
"Why are you doing this?" he asked the invisible brunette a yard away from the house. He didn't dare wait until they arrived at the house and risk Jashua seeing either of them. He would kill Harry. And Draco couldn't step foot back into Jashua's house without finishing the Sterilization Potion. He couldn't risk another pregnancy, and he needed to do this now before he talks himself out of it again.
Harry was just about to ask what he meant when Draco suddenly wiped around and looked at him with a horrified expression.
"y-you were on my balcony dead today." he whispered, then sobbed harder, "You showed up one day out of the blue a year ago and took me by force after being so nice for some reason. You said you'd protect me, then you disappeared. Y-you y-you sent all those ho-horrible letters."
"You lied to me. You said you would never lie to me." Draco whispered, looking at the floor and wrapping his arms around himself.
He often wonders whether Jashua truly loves him like he claims. It didn't really matter since Draco had nowhere to go, but Jashua gave him what he deserves, so in a way, Draco loves him and he felt it would be better if the honest, kind dark-haired, blue-eyed man in front of him somehow felt the same. He was possessive and overwhelming, always asking where Draco was going and who he interacted with. He never like the idea of Draco being outside for too long, saying that others may treat him badly. He sometimes cries and hugs Draco tightly when he  brings up leaving. Draco always feels guilty then. He didn't mean to upset him. He just didn't want to burden him anymore. He reassured Draco that he wasn't, that he enjoyed having the blonde around and proved it by locking Draco indoors for another month. Draco never brought up leaving again. That made him think that Jashua does love me and Draco held onto the thought for dear life.
The question was out of his mouth before he could think about it. Then, it was too late and Draco was releasing shaking breathes, trying to stop his tears. Harry didn't want that. He just wanted Draco to be fine, not pretend to be fine!
"H-Harry?" he asked breathlessly. And, for a moment, Harry thought there was hope after all, despite the shaking of his Draco's entire body and his sad expression. But the blonde seemed to collect himself, showing no more emotions as his signature sneer masked his expression.
"I-I can't let you leave, Draco. You understand that, right?" Harry said soothingly, trying not to freak the blonde out. It didn't work. Harry was sure Draco would've run if he had the energy and the fact that he didn't only strengthed Harry's belief that this was the only way.
"was it just me or did I see Harry Potter walking out of the store just now?" he asked quietly. Draco didn't know whether he was looking at him. He still faced the wall, trying to avoid any eye contact. Perhaps if he kept doing that, the entire day would go away.
Draco jumped upon hearing the brunette’s voice, then blushed violently, having just been caught using Harry’s wand to blow bubbles all around his room.
Only, then did Harry notice one of the food boxes was gift-wrapped. It had a note that said 'Harry Birthday, Harry. I wish one day I'll be able to be there to celebrate with you.'
It was just a bad day, Harry told himself, and it would be over soon and Draco would be fine. With these pleasant thoughts in mind, he let Draco drift to sleep, setting a plan to convince the blonde that he needed to he to help.
Harry's voice was hopeful, but draco's thoughts were running wild at the memory. He had completely forgotten about Harry and his bruised jaw in the frenzy of Jashua's rage. He had once again hurt Harry and doesn't know how to make it better. Suddenly, he is crying again. Silently, but he hated himself for it. Harry was the one who was hurt and Jashua was very angry, so why was Draco acting like an emotional brat?
“I feel like going into the muggle world for some pastries. Care to join me? Or is it too early for a second date?” the brunette asked with the same wide smile. Draco nodded happily, forgetting all about the long speech of apologies he had prepared. The creature inside him was jumping up and down in pure joy. The blonde sighed in relief, somehow knowing that his inner veela would not bother him in the near future. If Harry just kept doing things like this...Draco might just be alright. The blonde couldn’t be sure, though. He didn’t know what was wrong with his inner veela, after all.
"Please don't go! Please stay! What do you need from me to believe that you aren't a burden?" Harry cried out, "Gods, Draco, it hurts just thinking about it. You're so far away from being a burden that using that in the same sentence as having you stay with me is ridiculous. I want you here so badly, it takes everything I've got not to do this everytime you leave on Fridays! I.. It hurts to think I am sending you off to your own doom everytime, and Scruffie and I cry for hours after you've gone every week, but I've respected your wishes and I've done as you've asked for so so long, could you please, just please, do this one thing for me? Please stay."
"I am so sorry, myrtle." he told her, putting his face in his hands, "I didn't mean to upset you. It's just that you and I have become so close, that I sometimes forget-"
