Malfoy, who’d yet to make eye contact since waking, turned a critical gaze on Harry’s leg.
Harry grinned. "Three, at least. Maaaybe four, if you stay the night. That would be a new record for me." He took another bite--it was just as good as the first. "As for the lack of injuries, part of that is Ron watching my back, for sure. The rest is...well, I've always had a knack for defense, I suppose."
Draco was curling up into the blankets and sheets (and all over Harry, as if he were a big pillow) as he heard Harry speak. At first, he thought he had registered his words wrong; had Harry really just asked him to stay? As in, move in? Or was that Draco just being too hopeful?
(That doesn't seem like much of a challenge. I did it anyway, but what is the point if no one sees it?)
He gave her a quelling look. "Don't you have weights to lift?" he retorted smartly, dropping the bands to the mat with a soft and bouncy thud.
"Harry," Draco moaned as his legs began to stutter, "come on, love... Fuck me like you mean it."
Draco pumped his fist until Harry was fully spent and then held him close, with both arms wrapped around his lover's trim waist. He nuzzled the nape of Harry neck with a smug, lazy grin--ignoring his own still pulsing erection.
Since you're going to be here a while, you may as well decorate a bit, yeah?

They sank together into the wisps of his memory. It had been a while since Draco last went diving into a pensieve, and the odd feeling of drowning as his consciousness slipped away was no different. He blinked at the bright, flashing lights of the club. They stood near the edge of what was practically a mosh pit (with more hip gyrating); not far from three familiar faces.
Dear Draco,
And he thought he might earn himself some extra special after-date entertainment for his effort.

form would be?" he asked after a few quiet moments. The question gnawed at him. Potter could easily be a lion...with a particularly scruffy black mane. Or a bear. Maybe even a bull. Something large and protective, he was sure.
Draco chose to forgo his next nap in favor of writing letters: one to Gringrotts to ask about Harry's official title, another to his father to let him know he would not be available next Wednesday (but didn't mention it would be because of dinner with a "mudblood" and Weasley), and the last to his mother asking if she would send more expensive chocolates from that gourmet chocolatier he liked. He set them all aside for sending later as he couldn't send them while staying with Harry (he didn't want to accidentally alert anyone to where the man lived somehow and he had promised to avoid contacting people). After, still choosing to avoid his usual cat nap, he decided to read (in the nude, of course) until Harry returned.
Bless her, she was on the right track, but it would be so much faster if he could just show her. He stood fully upright and reached for the book, grunting and snorting to get her attention.
"Not that we need it, but oysters are supposed to be an aphrodisiac. I also have grilled salmon and lobster cannelloni. For sides there is salad with a delicious orange sauce I made myself, grilled squash with lemon pepper, and a treacle tart the size of your head for afters."

to get in the way of his usual paranoia. Draco gripped the blanket tight and nodded curtly at the demand.
I am sure once we get a few rounds out of our systems we will be okay to talk. After sleeping it off, I imagine. I won't go easy on you.
Gieves nodded and went to inspect both the garment and his client. Potter stood still for his perusal, surprisingly at ease with the whole affair. Draco re-seated himself on the settee, resting one arm along the back and dropping the other into his lap. He caught Potter's eye and with a wicked smirk, palmed his half-hard prick through the fabric of his robes and started stroking himself lazily. Gieves was too busy to notice.
Who was not kidding about the hex
It's practical, isn't it?
He followed Malfoy's gaze over the reception hall and caught the hastily turned heads and defiant stares of several curious onlookers. There was literally no one among them he wanted to talk to. He'd done his duty in wishing the bride and groom congratulations and thanked the Rosiers for the lovely evening. He'd plastered a polite smile on his face for all the greedy, beady-eyed sharks who wanted a piece of Harry Potter to advance their standing in the cutthroat circles of pureblood society even though half the people in the room had been rooting for the other side in the war. A celebrity was a celebrity, apparently. Even a dusty one like him who had done very little of interest in the years since.
"Mr. Billingsley," he said in greeting, trying for professional cordiality. He offered his hand...and was summarily dismissed with an upturned nose and disdainful sniff. That stung more than he let on (though turnabout was fair play, he supposed, remembering a scrawny pair of first years and a life-alteringly bad first impression).

vanish this if you prefer. I purposely wore some old clothes I have no love for anymore just for the occasion, as I was half-expecting to have to play literal doctor. I even brought my own special, home-made remedies with me," Draco hinted at the bag still perched on the bed as he spoke.
pleased. I don't even know who this mystery man is!
Potter nodded, expression earnest, if irreverent.
Malfoy appeared content to continue laying (and writhing) on the couch, so Harry rose from his seat to urge him up and out. He couldn't turn him loose in the Ministry like that, though. Really, Malfoy shouldn't even apparate in the condition he was in. Harry would have to get him home.
think about it. A good deal more frequently than he would like. And once the idea took hold, it began seeming... well, not entirely out of the question.
"Hermione, Ron--Draco," he introduced; trying to move past the baggage of last names (and possible slurs). "Draco--Hermione and Ron."
, he thought matter-of-factly. In fact—
There was a slightly teasing quality to his tone, at least. He ate far more delicately than Harry, and by the time they reached the park he wasn't even half through.
"It's after five," Draco argued, the entitled whine tickling the hairs below Harry's left ear. He sat up with a mischievous glint in his eyes that could only spell trouble. "Someone should write an exposé about the poor, overworked Saviour and his abysmal working conditions," he proposed.
"I'm sorry I ever did anything to make you or anyone else think that I'm ashamed of you," he earnestly began. "I'm not. Far from it. I'm lucky to have you and I know it." An idea that had been taking root for weeks clamored for attention, demanding to be spoken. Harry opened his mouth to do just that--
"Sleep as long as you like," Harry whispered, running his fingers lightly through Draco's hair. "Stay as long as you like. I'll be here when you wake up and... And maybe....
To Our Real Secret Santas,
Needless to say, Draco bought every copy he could (all of them) and bribed the paper to keep their mouths shut and not print anymore. Both to save Potter from more humiliation and to keep those details to himself as much as possible.
I've got a black market pensieve memory that somehow missed burning in the cleansing fire you might find interesting...
Draco was still as a statue except for the wild pulse fluttering in the hollow of his throat. Harry wanted to taste it but he waited, a niggle of doubt suggesting he'd made another catastrophic error in judgement at the hunted look in those slate grey eyes.
Where was a bomb threat when you needed one?
"Be right back," he promised his friends after taking their contributions to dinner and getting them settled.
Draco plopped onto the proffered seat as soon as the invitation was given. His head fell back and he closed his eyes, leaving the long column of his pale neck exposed. He took a slow, deep breath. Normally, if things had been normal, the blonde might have considered commenting on the plebian way Potter settled himself into his desk, but proper posture was not on his current list of cares.

on the settee, exactly where it had been prior to suffering minor magical abuse.
Harry flinched at the mere mention of it.
"How about we take both of your suggestions and share? I wouldn't mind," Draco purred and slid his hand across Harry's thigh (teasing the edge of his clothed cloth.)

He gave a defeated sigh and looked away, but at least his glare had disappeared.
The Centre was outfitted with a wide array of state-of-the-art exercise machines and office equipment, more than half of which Harry wagered Malfoy'd never encountered before (particularly given the skeptical, slightly terrified way he looked at everything). The poor sod was the very definition of a fish out of water.

While receiving a small massage around his Achilles, he used his talented toes to inch Potter's shirt up, thankful it had not been tucked in. Once he could, he pressed them into the lower part of Potter's abdomen.

Harry did as told, with great relish. He was still careful not to hurt Draco, but he began to pump his hips in long, slow thrusts. Draco broke the kiss to gasp; it sounded more like pleasure than pain so Harry rolled his hips once more, balanced on his knees and toes. The sensation was exquisite. Different than a cunt. Rougher, even with lube. Tighter, but in a limited ring around his prick rather than even along the whole thing, like wanking with just his thumb and forefinger. He got off on the novelty of it.
"Son, why didn't you tell us?"
"Are there dangers inside I should be aware of?" Potter wisely inquired before stepping through. Apparently even Gryffindors could learn to look before they leapt. Draco shook his head. None besides the usual dangers of a well-kept Potions lab, at any rate.
"Hmm, I don't know... Sounds dangerous." Draco felt his cheeks burn a little, but it only lasted for a second as he took a long, controlled breath. He shrugged nonchalantly as much as he could, considering the smile he was suppressing. "I suppose it wouldn't be terrible... I've walked these grounds so many times I could probably draw a map."
I know what my sexuality is--I've known it a long time--so that isn't in question (for me.)
Draco scoffed as he stood from where Harry had sprawled him.
"I was in a hurry not to be late... The traffic back in from Russia is quite busy this time of day. Oh, I got you a gift--nothing big, I confess."
He reluctantly eased off and freed himself from the confines of the skirts, leaving both hands beneath it to knead Potter's muscular thighs. "That was rather the idea," he retorted dryly. "But if you'd rather wait until I'm buried inside you, that can be arranged."
Harry scoffed. "No wonder your sleep schedule is so barmy if you think 11pm is nap time," he remarked fondly (due, in no small part, to the flood of endorphins in his system). "I, for one, will be going to

I have no idea why they would think my feelings for you are anything but genuine. After all, who wouldn't naturally fall for your roguish good looks--topped off by your darling mop of hair and those dazzling green eyes--or your daring, fearless attitude?
Well, what am I supposed to do then? It isn't as if (normal, private) men are knocking down the door to have sex with me (despite what you think), and the few that do openly want me are just in it for celebrity status, which means even if it's a one-time pull I can't be too careful, because likely as not it'll end up in the Prophet.
It was more than a little surreal.
He was still pompous, entitled, and pratty, of course, but he was a fair sight less evil. He did a lot of good for the world, in fact, in his post as the Prophet's official Ministry reporter. Go figure, right? Who would have believed five years ago that
I am confined to my home without company and my usual entertainments have worn thin.
"Because the half dozen you left on my neck aren't enough for you?" Harry scoffed, holding Draco round the middle and smirking up at him.

One never knew how crucial a seemingly trivial detail might be until the end.
Dear Merlin,
miss you?
"You haven't made it to any of your appointments," Harry replied. "This is a house call." He opened the backpack at his feet to reveal the rope ladder, deflated exercise ball, ankle and wrist weights, and assorted other bits of gear it contained. "A genuine one."

Unable to stall much longer, he sat up and withdrew his hand. Draco whimpered. Harry shushed him gently and rested the other on Draco's thigh for balance, then guided his cock until the head, flushed deep red and glistening, nudged Draco's pucker. Rather than pushing in straight away, he dragged it across Draco's winking entrance, toying with him to test the limits of his notoriously thin patience.
Harry laughed again, maintaining a leisurely pace despite the demands of his impatient partner.
Draco chuckled as Harry quite obviously burned his tongue. He grinned and rolled his eyes.
Draco straightened his clothes out and tried his best to hide his disappointment (and the way the voice inside screeched like a banshee in protest.) Once he knew he could answer without his voice shaking, which took a couple of minutes and a lot of deep breathing, he placed his hands on the table, palms up in offering for Potter's.
It is because I love you that I hate to see you all sad and pouty over a scruffy, guileless Gryffindor. It has been particularly pathetic as of late. Just take a stab at a good shag, get him out of your system, and either move on or get on with it.
"So modest," Harry chuckled. He was thoroughly impressed by Draco's culinary prowess--he really was artistically gifted. Harry wondered if he could paint or draw, as well.

"Anyway," he continued, fixing his glasses from where they'd slipped down his nose, "if anyone bothers to notice you, they'll probably think you're a semi-pro footballer or something. But you'll find most of the folk in here to be focussed on their own business, not yours."

"Um...your mum's not around, is she?" Harry asked uncertainly.
He took a large swallow of whiskey and let the burn clear his mind. He was only thinking about Malfoy because of the case. That was it. His brain just got confused, is all.
Sadly, this fic was put on hiatus by the unexpected demise of Prinn's computer but she is now up and running with a new one, which means so are we!
Dearest Pansy,
"Treats are on the mantle," he said dismissively as he untied the attached note. The bird ruffled itself. "If you need water there is a fountain outside."

The room wasn't large, so it was fortunate that neither one of them was much interested in personal space just then. Maneuvering around Draco, Harry adjusted the taps so the water would start heating (the plumbing in Grimmauld Place was muggle, magically enhanced) and turned to attack the buttons of Draco's waistcoat.

He probably shouldn't have been as pleased by it as he was. Regardless, Harry felt a little thrill that Malfoy wanted his help badly enough to admit he had been an unpleasant arse for much of the past hour.

"By design," Gieves said blandly, tightening the corset further still. Draco snickered--he'd been on the receiving end of the man's merciless approach before. "It is meant to display your waist and décolletage to best effect," he continued with no hint of irony in his dry tone (though Draco suspected it was there beneath the surface). If the tailor had any opinions about how Draco planned to spend the evening with his unusually costumed houseguest, he didn't show it. Potter frowned, his brow furrowed, breath coming in shallow pants.
Blearily Harry blinked up at the person-shaped silhouette looming above him as he fumbled for his glasses, the sun almost directly overhead.

The caress of Draco's voice pushed Harry over the edge.
Harry arched up off his desk with a sucking hiss, upending his inkwell in the process. He didn't notice. His arse
"Who's stopping you?" he retorted with a smirk.
"If you're tying to sell me something you'll have to do it naked."
"One advantage to dating a shorter man is the easy fit," he chuckled into Harry's ear. He let go a second later and jerked his thumb forward. "All right, Mister Auror. Escort me. Just keep heading straight and turn right when you can."
"First off," Harry said tersely, "there's no telling what danger might await you out there so I don't want you leaving without me, got it?"
"I've had a fair bit of experience with wanking, if that's what you mean," he jokingly replied. He mouthed along the top of Draco's shoulder and rolled his nipple between his forefinger and thumb, eliciting a delicious gasp. "I've always been a quick learner," he added, voice a silky caress. "Particularly if the subject excites me," he tightened his fist when Draco bucked into it, adding friction and drag.
But more than anything I still feel this is a trick. One meant to lower my guard or perhaps to have me pen a disclosure to be used as blackmail. You must understand that my circumstances have forced me to be cautious and having such a nice missive quite out of the blue is highly suspect.
******
There was also the fact Malfoy’s wand was lit up like a Christmas tree.
It seems to me you could have done the same thing--that is, make amends--with Potions just as well as law enforcement. That stuff you sent was far more effective than what the hospital has now. Oh, and I'll be stuck here at least another week (maybe longer). They "don't want to take any chances." Bastards. But if you send over files I can at least do some paperwork for you.

"OhthankMerlin," Harry exclaimed on a sigh, slumping with relief. "I thought you were dosed for sure. Godrick, I felt horrible." He grinned sheepishly and closed the distance between them. "I'm totally in my right mind," he assured the dubious Unspeakable. "I never drink anything I didn't see come out of a bottle or can. Too many close calls for me not to be cautious."
I caught you looking at my arse today in the Ministry as I was picking up my dropped glove. Care to elaborate on that further? Say, my office?
As he set the wards on his office door--with Draco nibbling his ear and whispering the filthiest of promises--he couldn't help feeling like he was forgetting something...
I'm following all the Healers' orders, yours included. Hopefully I'll be back soon so we can both stop staring at the same four walls.
Draco froze.
," Draco moaned as he stared into deep, emerald green. His toes curled into the sheets as he came closer to his prostate, purposely teasing himself by inching closer rather than pressing directly into it. His cock was lightly tapping his abdomen as he began to thrust harder, faster--his hips bearing down as if he really were being fucked by something other than his fingers.
"Ohhh f-fuuuck...!" Draco drawled out as he dug his knees in, stiffened his mid-section, and held onto the headboard for dear life as he was roughly taken. His cock was growing hard again, despite its previous protest, though after his hard climax before the building up felt bruising.
"Thank you."
"Are you sure you were dropped? Or did you just fall headfirst from a few too many trees?" Harry raised an eyebrow at him. These past two days that they'd been hanging out so much they had become pretty close, which was surprising, to say the least. Harry handy expected that Dudley would be so fun to hang around, and despite the fact he wanted to, he hadn't expected he'd be able to forget the first thirteen years of the torment Dudley put him through so easily, but he had. It was easy, somehow.
"They were startled someone had heard them, but once they realized I wasn't gonna judge them for talking about it, they explained it to me. They said that 'asexual' was when a person didn't feel sexual attraction for other people and that 'aromantic' was when a person didn't feel a romantic attraction to other people."
"Alright Pads, go get your man." Padfoot glared at him before bolting out the door, and Harry couldn't help but laugh.
A few hours later Harry had the urge to ask. They were in his room on his bed, as Dudley read a comic book of some superhero, and Harry finished his transfiguration homework. If he didn't have that done correctly McGonagall might just actually turn him into a stopwatch so he could 'manage his time better.'
'Harry, I'm bored." Whined Sirius from where he was sitting.
Harry was currently upstairs in his bedroom with Sirius sitting on one of the chairs beside his bed. He was doing his homework for a lack of a better thing to do. Plus, he was interested in his homework, which was preposterous because he didn't like Potions class. Although, he found it quite interesting when he understood the material, and when Snape wasn't breathing on his neck all the time. Seriously, what did he ever do that guy-
"HE WAS STICKING OUT OF THE BACK OF HIS HEAD?"
"Oh Harry! What's going on?n Is everything alright? How's summer been treating you? You holding up alright?" Harry rolled his eyes. Ever the doting mother figure in his life, despite being a man. His Moomy, if you will. Harry snickered.
"Hullo, Uncle Moony."
"I come bearing gifts." Harry says in a soft, lilting voice.
"Yeah. I'm just glad we're close now."
"Haha, giant snake go brr." Harry didn't even know what the fuck that meant but he found it funny anyway.
"What the fuck is a Moldy-wart?" Harry nearly pissed himself.
"Dudley? What are you doing?" Vernon spluttered.
"Fuck you, I AM a six year old."
"Speak for yourself." Harry shoved him, and they laughed.
However as he locked the door to his room, he couldn't help but think to himself 'what just happened?'
"I'll explain on the Walkie." He says, and then louder, "Which apparently Pads isn't going to."
"Oh you're big lads, you can jog to the Tesco on your own." He said, and waited for the undoubtedly hilarious reactions.
"Nah, I was too fat to get on trees. However, I had also been too fat to be held. Mum tried anyway, hence why have such a deformed head." Dudley responded, swinging back and forth from the branch.
'Go upstairs to your room, okay? I'll deal with this." Harry didn't need to be told twice.
"Hey, are you okay?" Harry snapped out of his thoughts.
"I mean, we had a whole conversation a couple of hours back about my sexuality, or well, my lack of one, so you know? Why not?" Harry steeled himself. He didn't know why he was asking. He supposed he was curious to see if he was the only one with such thoughts.
Harry couldn't help but remember the conversation with fondness. It was hard for him to remember how to calm himself down, and how to breathe properly, but he went back to that conversation when he needed it. The memory not only served to remind him how to calm himself but it also gave him a distraction of the destructive thoughts in his mind. This particular memory was important to Harry. After all, it had been the first time Harry had a friend, or anyone really, talk him through an episode.
"Sirius!" Harry screams, and Sirius is c a c k l i n g.
"Harry..."
A knock startled Harry out of his reverie. Panic surged through him once again. Was it Vernon? Had he come back to finish what he had started? Had Dudley not been able to stop him? Was Dudley alright? Surely Uncle Vernon wouldn't hit his son, right?
After a few more minutes of much needed rest (and water, copious amounts of it), they make their way back to the house, walking this time ('Thank Fuck.' Harry decided he liked that a lot more).
"Well, I just don''t think you should hang out with him. He's a bad influence!"
"Dudley!" Aunt Petunia screamed as soon as he got in the house. "Where have you been? Where you with this- this filth?" Padfoot growled, getting in front of Dudley. Harry was surprised. Padfoot was...protecting Dudley? Though Dudley didn't seem to notice. He just sighed. "Oh, your mutt's back." Petunia said, disgusted.
"So, Harry, where the hell is that dog of yours?" Dudley asked from beside him, sounding like he was just taking a nice midday stroll, the bastard.
All these changes had happened when Harry was gone for his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. Imagine his surprise at seeing the change of his cousin.
"Harry." Wow Sirius thought Dudley really sounded like Hermione in that instance.
"Yes, I did!" Sirius very helpfully supplied.
"So you may want to sit down for this, or it'll be a REALLY long Walkie, and I rather tell this story more comfortably."
PLEASE READ! Hey all! I know its be a hot minute since I last updated, and I sincerely apologize for it. If you've read my bio on this profile than you already know these two things about me. Numero Uno: I am absolute shit at updating. Like actual stinky, moldy, crusty, old shit at updating. I don't have an uploading schedule, and I'm just always all over the place. Numero Dos: I am Puerto Rican. The reason that this has any relevancy at all is that I was at Puerto Rico for these last two months because of a family emergency (don't worry, it's taken care of now), and i didn't bring my computer because I'm a fuckass (the ghetto way of saying i completely forgot). I didn't have access to a computer either (big sad boi hours). Anyway, those are my excuses for being a lazy shit. I hope you understand and I also hope you enjoy this chapter, which I tried to make super long because of the long wait (super long for my standards, anyway.)
"Okay, then, how do I stop myself from hyper-er. From breathing too fast?"
"Don't take too long, or I'll disconnect you from the phone!" He stomped his way out of the room like some sort of overgrown child. A very, very overgrown child.
"How do I do that, though? The air just seems to get thinner around me." Harry hadn't been lying. When he had a panic attack, he felt as if the air around him just wasn't enough for his lungs. It was as if he was climbing the highest mountain in the world without an air tank, and the air progressively got thinner and thinner the higher he went.
"Dudley, dude, why are you like this?" Harry sighed. It's been two days since the whole 'incident' happened (yes, the incident is what Harry has taken to calling it). Dudley had stuck to him like glue because Sirius wasn't back yet. If he were to be left alone, Vernon would probably kill him for "corrupting his sweet Diddikins." The first time he had said that Harry nearly pissed himself laughing at hearing a fully grown man talk to his almost fully grown son like he was a puppy. The only thing that saved him from another 'incident,' was that Dudley had laughed to, with a "What the fuck, Dad? You doin' okay?"
"HERMIONE IS SUCH A BADASS OH MY GOD. IN A JAR FOR A YEAR? Q U E E N."
'Yeah, but just let me go get something real quick." He went down the stairs and Harry sat on his bed, waiting for his cousin.
"You know we're going to at least walk this off afterward right?" Dudley asked and Harry groaned.
"Always remember to try and calm your breathing, Harry." Harry shook his head, still shaking.
"I'm using the telephone." He replied calmly.
"Alright."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, we're still young and stupid." Harry agreed.
"Oh, uh yeah." He went and sat down on the chair that Sirius was sitting at before he left for Remus' place.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's not any better."
"...Shit. I gotta up my workout routine."
And so he told his story. He first explained about Sirius and being an Animagi, but that just brought up more questions, so Harry basically told his life story from the age of 11 and up. If he thought that it was going to be a depressing story, boy was he wrong. Dudley didn't let it be.
"My asexual ass could never."
"Do you consider me a sibling? Like a brother I mean?" Dudley looked at him shocked and thought for a little while before answering.
There was a hot moment of silence.
"See? Look at how he's got you talking to me. You used to never talk to me like that. You used to respect me!" Dudley stopped, but didn't turn around. His head was down, and he was glaring at the floor in front of Harry.
"Do they go hand in hand?" Dudley shook his head.
"We really need to stop calling them Walkies. We sound like six year-olds." Dudley says, trying to lighten the mood despite the fact he no doubt wanted an explanation.
Maybe he could find a friend in his cousin. Another ally in the place that was supposed to be his home but never had been. Perhaps it would be like it was always meant to. He'd heard Ron talk about his cousins like they were a second set of siblings, and apparently everyone just had a favorite cousin they liked to see at family parties and whatnot. Even Hermione had talked about having a cousin she treasured. Someone who was disconnected in your life outside of familiar affairs, but was still important in your life because they had known you for so long. Maybe, just maybe, Dudley could be that for him.
"Padfoot, Dudley's fine. He's not gonna hurt me." Padfoot gave Harry a incredulous look, whilst Harry gave him a pointed one. In the end, he backed off, but not before giving Dudley the stink eye.
All in all, Harry actually had a lot of fun telling this story, which he didn't think was possible.
Harry thought that the whole 'growing up together' thing had to do with it, but he couldn't help but feel that it was also because Dudley had his blood. He had someone who was blood-related that liked him. That had never happened before. And it feels different from Ron, or Hermione. He does think of them as siblings, but Harry had lived with Dudley his whole life. He knew what it was to have blood-related relatives, just not ones that liked him, and now he understood.

"Ferrets are not rodents," Draco said (just to be contrary).
Even more details? You're a greedy bastard, Potter.
Dear Potter,
*****
Draco half-glared at the hero, his chest heaving. He had no idea just how sensitive he was down there, despite his experimentations and everything he and Harry had ever done.
"Then it's true," he murmured, voice barely a whisper, thoughts racing, tumbling from his lips. "Pansy helped... She must have. But why? She works with the Healers at St. Mungo's, you know. I heard a rumor that muggle medical technologies may be integrated by the Healers in some sort of program starting in the next few years--very few people know about it. She's high enough in staff to have known... She very well could have produced the needle," Draco's stomach gave a queasy lurch. "I only know because I still use my father's connections to keep up. He told me about it recently, but nothing has been totally confirmed. Even the program is just an idea for now... She might have had to do research or something, or made an underling do it to avoid the extra work." The more he talked, the more he picked up steam until he was nearly frantic.
"If by holding hands you mean letting me cling and you not jerking away, then of course you were fine," Draco picked a shred of fish up from the cone. He stopped in his tracks as he sampled the well-fried meat and made an approving hum.
Draco hummed. "You go," he said. "I'm going to stay for a few minutes to actually apply soap to my body, and I don't need you around to continue distracting me." He gave Harry's thigh a playful smack as he moved (somewhat sluggishly) to stand. He had to use the shower walls and Harry's shoulder for support until he was upright and his legs no longer shook.
I am not defending it, I am just saying it isn't so strange to those of us who grew up with it. But of course I want out! I certainly don't want to marry a

Draco sat at the humble table in the basement-level kitchen. The chairs were wood and without cushions, but as soon as his rear hit the seat he knew they had been charmed--it was as comfortable as sitting back on the sofa. A shaking hand swept through his hair, mussing his bed-head even further.
Draco
"Mmphmf," Harry replied around a mouthful of eager Slytherin. He walked Draco backwards until they both tumbled onto the sofa, their kisses becoming more urgent with the introduction of the horizontal plane.
Draco flailed as he was suddenly tugged away from the side of the bed and under the covers. He glared once they were settled through the shield of his mask, though his arms did hug Potter's neck in a loose embrace.

Harry might have whimpered.
He winked to let Draco know he meant no offense.
"Sure you were," she smirked. Then, with her characteristic go-getter's attitude, she rubbed her hands together and proclaimed, "All right, boys, what've we got to work with?"
He began whisking the melting chocolate and butter together in a pan. "And
"And, no, I am not scared to dance with a man," he added tightly (because Malfoy's taunt demanded a reply), "but that was not part of my agreement with Robards for this event. I demand at least a week of paid leave if he expects me to dance."
There was nothing Draco could do for the time being, and he was not one to engage in piteous self loathing in front of others, so instead he shifted his thoughts around via well practiced Occlumency until all that was left in the forefront of his mind was Harry, the earnest look the Auror was giving him, and just enough numbing nothingness that Draco was able to sport a slightly flimsy seductive smile.
"Leave now," he rumbled, "or I will not be held responsible for my actions."
Draco stayed curled on the side of the bed hidden from the door with his face now hidden in his blanket. His heart was racing so hard the blonde feared it would jump right through his rib cage and out his chest. Despite everything that had happened and what was happening now, hearing Pansy shriek in terror and what might have been pain was still unpleasant.
We should probably play sooner than the tourney, and that's not terribly far (I assume?) so perhaps as soon as.... Next Friday? So we aren't too tired before the game?
Thoughts tumbling chaotically, he saw himself out with the intention of sending an owl when he got back to the office.
A wide grin split his face.
Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco, silently asking if he had an opinion on how the loaded question should be answered. Draco merely inclined his head, giving him the floor.
Harry faltered, looking even more guilty in his stammering denial.
Malfoy tossed the pillow directly overhead and swung his wand (pulling Harry off-balance in the process), pairing the gesture with a clearly articulated, “
Harry allowed some emotion into his voice, the weight of his conviction lending strength to his words, "You've already served your time. This self-imposed house arrest is unfair. And I couldn't care less what the papers say about me. They have been printing lies since I was a kid. A sterling political reputation and positive public image mean next to nothing to me, I have no intention of running for Minister. What I care about is doing what's right. In this case, that's helping you," he pointed at Malfoy to underscore the statement. "So would you be willing to give me a pensieve memory of that night?"
"What are you on about?" he deflected (futilely), making sure Sarah's 'World's Greatest Receptionist' mug was safely out of harm's way. Janine was like a ruddy Crup when she had an idea in her head--eager, determined, and relentless. Harry appraised her warily. Her hands were firmly placed on her wide hips, elbows akimbo, brown eyes narrowed dangerously. All bad signs.
His jaw was beginning to ache from how hard he'd been clenching it; he willed his body to relax, but his tone was steel when he concluded, "If you do and I find out about it, that will be the end for us."

A knock sounded at the door and Harry felt the flutter of excitement that always accompanied Draco's arrival these days.
One month had passed. During that time Harry insisted on introducing Draco to as much muggle stuff (food-wise) as possible, saying it would be good for him. Most times it was true, as with the case of certain cookie brands and the ice cream cake he always been curious about, but other times he wondered what Harry was thinking (as with the case involving certain vegetables he hadn't even heard of). Draco also had never been introduced to cheap, canned beer (when Harry had mentioned them Draco had asked why they would drink something in a
"Dudley." He said.
'I don't think so! You don't pay the phone bill in this house! You're probably about to call you freak friends from that freak school of yours!" Vernon yelled, spit flying out of his mouth onto Harry's face. Ugh. Padfoot growled low in his throat, and Vernon glanced at him.
"Because you're an ugly motherfucker that does things like making people run." Dudley stopped to laugh at that. 'Oh thank God, or Merlin, or whatever deity there is out there that gave me this small mercy.'
"Not with these wimpy biceps, I wont." And Harry laughed, but secretly, selfishly, he hoped Dudley would be far, far away somewhere when the inevitable war happened. He was Harry's last blood relative. Harry's basically brother. He wouldn't lose the only blood relative he liked left. Dudley had his mother's blood in him. Dudley was his brother, and if he couldn't protect the rest of his family (Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Remus, the rest of the Weasleys) because they would refuse to hide, then at least  he could protect Dudley.
"That you think this is FUN." This sent Dudley into another round of laughter.
"I-It was an accident, the- the chair-" Harry didn't get to finish the sentence before he was slapped across the face. His uncle raised his fist for a punch, and Harry clenched his eyes shut. awaiting the blow.
"What the bloody hell does it look like I'm doing?" Dudley spat.
"What do you think you are doing, boy?!" Called Uncle Vernon as Harry picked up the telephone.
"Whaaat? Pffft. No Pads is just a normal dog just doing normal... dog things." He gave what was obviously a nervous laugh, and Dudley gave him a weird look though he was smiling. He looked to Padfoot, who was giving him a look that clearly said "Seriously?" Had he been in his human form, Harry was sure he would have face palmed.
"Sirius? Wait, PERSON?" And Sirius is just fucking losing it.
"How will that help, 'Mione?" Hermione gave him a calm smile.
"There's a term for that?" Harry had never known that. He only knew 'gay,' 'lesbian,' and 'transgender.'
"Aren't girls also into funny dudes?" Harry asked. "You're pretty funny."
"B-But why would you defend him? He's nothing more than a freak!" Harry couldn't see Dudley's face, but he could see him shaking his head.
"Actually, I'm a Magic Person that just so happens to be able to turn into a dog!" He yells again.
"Let me see." He told Harry, finally meeting his gaze. Harry turned his head and found that his cheek did indeed feel sore, almost like a dull sort of throb. He hadn't thought much of it at the moment. He was...otherwise preoccupied.
"Never mind, I ship Umbitch x Dementor more."
"I love it that you think I know anything about girls."
"Yes. Thank you, Hermione. You're amazing!"
"Hey, Dudley? Can I ask what could potentially be an awkward question?" Dudley looked at him for a second before shrugging.
"See? We're like siblings." Dudley said, and Harry smiled.
"Oh, um. I haven't, uh, checked yet." This was undoubtedly one of the most awkward conversations he'd ever had, and he's had 'The TalkTM' with Sirius.
And thus it became their new tradition. They would run every day, and if they came home to either Petunia or Vernon yelling, they would have a plate of cookies, and go for "Walkies" to avoid the Parents (TM), and to burn off the calories. They would also drag Padfoot along.
"...Fuck, I don't have twenty pounds. Here, have a Galleon instead."
'This is it. This is the moment when I finally kill him. Sirius Black is no more. When I get my hands on him-'
"Well, it depends on your definition of bad. If by bad you mean rapidly turning purple, and oh God, is that yellow? Then, yes, absolutely bad." He frowned.
"You-you know what his comfort is?"
"He's not a freak. He's just different than us, and that's okay. What is NOT okay, is you doing this. Hitting him for something that wasn't even his fault. For something as stupid as broken plates. They're not even the nice china plates, Dad." He dropped his father's fist and turned to face Harry, holding out his hand for Harry to take. Harry took it hesitantly, and Dudley helped him up.
"With his boyfriend." Harry said without really thinking about it. He was currently more focused on trying not to pass out than keeping the Statute of Secrecy, because priorities, thank you very much.
Dudley and Harry get to chat after 'the incident.'
"Yeah, me too. Now lets go! I wanna know what Sirius looks like, and what he's like." And they raced back.
"How dare you?!"
"Don't you?"
"You think you're so clever, don't you?"
"Well, we can both relate to your mum and dad being arseholes, then." Dudley gave a watery laugh.
But it never came. Harry's eyes flew open only to reveal that Dudley was holding his father's fist in his hand.
"I'm not expecting you to forgive me, but I just want to say that for all those times that I was the one who hurt you, or insulted you, I'm really sorry. You didn't, still don't, and more than likely never will deserve that." Harry was stunned for what felt like the millionth time. He knew that Dudley had changed a lot during these years, but he'd never expected a whole 180-degree shift on his personality.
"I've never heard of that term before, though," Harry said thoughtfully.
'Unless he was tricking you.' He stopped in his tracks. 'Nah, he's not smart enough to try that.'
'Harry, did Padfoot just talk?" Sirius heard Dudley ask through the door.
"We had this conversation yesterday, and the day before that."
"Not right now, Dogfather. How about you call up Uncle Moony and hang out for a bit? Its been a while since you two have been alone." Harry wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
"Come on. You know you want to." Dudley looks at the plate of cookies and the glass of milk for another second before throwing his head back and sighing.
It wasn't until the third week of their tradition that Sirius decided he was going to reveal himself, unbeknownst to Harry.
"Never mind, I don't give a fuck if your sad, give me the cookies back." Dudley laughed, and for those brief moments, all was well.
"Harry, I could pass for one of the aliens from Star Wars." Harry laughed harder. Dudley grinned. "It's okay, I'm hella ugly, but ya know what? I still like myself. I don't have to be cute to be good. That's the real reason I turned it around. Was it because it was the right to do? Heh, no. Imagine being ugly AND an arsehole? No girl would look at me." Dudley looked at Harry seriously and Harry was still laughing.
"Really now? What other things make me undesirable in your opinion?" Dudley looked nothing but amused as Harry sunk to the grass and laid there heaving.
"Um, yeah? There's a term for everything nowadays. What do you even learn in Wizard School?" Dudley rolled his eyes before getting off the beach. He stumbled a little and sat where Harry was sitting on the ground. "If I hadn't gotten off of there I think my head might have fallen off."
"So are you aromantic?" Dudley thought for a second.
"Well, I have abs." This sent Harry into another fit of laughter.
"We'll see." And Harry once again seriously considers his theory that Dudley is secretly a wizard using magic on him to get him to do those absolutely fucking dreadful runs.
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. I'm pretty sure it's longer than the last three. or maybe I'm just tripping. I'l see you in the next update, which hopefully doesn't take me another fucking life time. And PLEASE if you can, and want to, comment. I L O V E knowing what your thoughts are or if you enjoyed the chapter. It makes me feel all warm inside.
"I know." He sighed. "I've been one of the people to put bruises on you too." He looked down at the floor with guilt, and Harry just didn't know what to do for a second.
Harry's feet pounded on the pavement as he jogged beside Dudley, his breath leaving him in staggering gasps. He was also taking gulping heaps of air that distantly reminded him of hyperventilating, except there was a distinct burning in his lungs put there by physical exertion that definitely wasn't there when he was having a panic or an anxiety attack. He almost preferred them. At least he didn't have to RUN when he was having a panic attack! He could not BELIEVE he let Dudley convince him this was a good idea AGAIN.
"Better, right?" Hermione smiled smugly.
'Well, if he wants to, I don't oppose it."
"That isn't what I thought you were gonna say but now that you ask, I guess, that yeah. I could see that. I mean, we did grow up together and all. Well, we hated each other, but that's beside the point. There was definitely a difference in my life after you went to Hogwarts. You might have thought that you weren't the center of attention here at home, but you did take a lot of it. Almost everything my parents did for me was done specifically to torment you. Once you were gone, they didn't buy me presents or even talk to me much. I started getting yelled at for my wrongdoings more often, and even got hit too for stupid shit." Dudley paused for a second, as of contemplating whether he should continue. In the end, he did.
"Um, I think it has to do with being dropped on my head a few too many times," Dudley says from the tree he's hanging upside down from.
"What did they say?" Harry had a basic idea of what it was because of what Dudley said before, but he hadn't heard 'aromantic' before.
"You're not gonna punch Voldemort out, Dudley."
"Come on, Pads, we're going for a Walkie!" Harry knocked on the door where Sirius was napping. Sirius groaned.
"Uh... the beginning?" Harry could recognize Dudley's attempt at lightening the mood and he appreciated it so much. Harry had discovered that Dudley could make light out of basically any situation.
"You can sit down, you know? If you want to, that is." Harry offered. Anything to get rid of this awkward tension. He'd never actually had a conversation with his cousin, and although not entirely unpleasant, it was definitely unfamiliar.
"Whoa there. What you growling at me for? I'm just hanging."
"Of course you don't. Use protection."
"Give me the stupid fucking plate." Harry laughed and sat beside Dudley and shared the plate and the glass of milk. Padfoot wanted some too, but Dudley wouldn't let him because apparently chocolate and cow milk were bad for dogs. Harry was going to get an earful after this.
"Hullo?" Remus answered.
"I bet you twenty pounds i can spell "I show not your face but your heart's desire" backwards without pausing."
"What do you mean your dog is a 40-year-old-man?"
"PADS!" Harry screeches as soon as he catches sight of the dog laying outside of the front door. The dog pounces on him, licking his face with what Harry thought was way too much slobber. "Ew, Pads, you dirty bastard, ger'off me."  He laughed, whilst pushing him off. However, once Pads caught sight of Dudley he started growl, jumping in front of Harry protectively. Dudley put his hands up in surrender.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That bad?" Harry gave a small smile, despite the throb of his cheek.
"I don't know..."
"Yes, everything is alright. I was just calling to see if Padfoot could stay a couple of days? He misses you. Don't look at me like that, Pads, yes a couple of days. You haven't seen each other in well over a month."
"Its when you breathe very fast."
"But, when I went to Hogwarts, that changed. Not only because I found people that cared about me, but also because I found people that hated me a hell of a lot more than even Uncle Vernon did. After that, you were just minor inconveniences during my summer. So, I guess what I'm getting at is that it's been a while since you were the villain of my story. It's easier for me to forgive you. So let just let bygones be bygones." He got up and held his hand up in an offer of friendship, much like a certain blonde had so many years ago. Harry quickly pushed the thought away. He tended to get a little...carried away when speaking or thinking about...him, according to Ron and Hermione, anyway. Harry thought it was fine, thank you very much. Dudley got up too and shook his hand. They grinned at each other, which Harry quickly stopped because ow, his cheek, but the sentiment was there.
"Well, there are many different methods. The most common one is counting. Count until four as you breathe in, and four as you breathe out. Try it right now." Harry did and was surprised to see that even though he hadn't been hyperventilating, it still helped to calm him down.
"Well, I don't understand why you would want to hang out with him!"
"Yeah?"
"Okay, here." An ice pack. Harry couldn't help the small smile that crossed his face, despite the fact that he definitely tried. His face was really starting to hurt, now.
"Bye, love you!" He hung up.
He tried to go back to that particular conversation, as he always did when he was having an episode, trying to remember the comforting and helpful words Hermione had spoken to him.
"Harry?"
"Go play outside like a dog, or something." Answered Harry, without looking up from his homework. Perhaps Hermione had rubbed off of on him a little.
"It's Voldemort."
"All you have is being a good person, then?" Harry's cheeks hurt from laughing and smiling
"I'm getting Dudley's comfort food."
"I really ship Rita Skeeter with a Dementor. I can't wait for their first kiss!"
"No?"
Dudley and Harry get closer.
'No, Harry. Healthy breathing, so to speak, happens with a balance of oxygen going into your body and carbon dioxide leaving it. By hyperventilating, you are upsetting this balance by exhaling more than you inhale." Harry remembered wondering in amazement how it was Hermione Granger knew everything. Of course, he still wondered that, it just no longer surprised him.
"Good boy, Pads." He told Sirius before typing the number Remus had given him.
"How would I know you're saying it right though?"
"Yeah."
"Not necessarily. You can like a person and want to date them, but not want to sleep with them. Or it could be the other way around. Or maybe you just want to be friends with that person." Dudley shrugged.
Of course, the Dursleys, being Petunia and Vernon, had noticed the dog wasn't around to protect Harry, so that meant Harry was back to cooking and cleaning for a couple of days. This always happened when Padfoot left for Remus'. He never told Padfoot because he knew that if he did, he wouldn't leave to be with his boyfriend anymore.
"Remember that the air isn't getting thinner. Try not to hyperventilate-"
"What do you mean convicted criminal? The fuck? Why?"
"I don't THINK I'm clever. I KNOW I am." He bumped his shoulder with Harry's and Harry gave a small laugh.
"Ugh, I don't wanna. Let's go out and do something fun." Harry didn't know what it was about today that he just didn't want to go outside. He just wanted to stay inside and do nothing. Or well, do interesting homework. He'd leave the boring bits of it for the last minute, probably.  Okay, so maybe Hermione hadn't rubbed off on him too much after all.
"Hey. I just wanted to check up on you, ya know? See how you were doing. He got you pretty good on that first slap." Dudley rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, not meeting his gaze.
"Yeah milk and cookies. So are you gonna let me get it?" Petunia looked at him for a second before wordlessly getting out of his way and going to the leaving room, letting Harry get the snacks.
"Why is that so bad? Shouldn't that help me get more air into my lungs?" Hermione shook her head.
"Here's a piece of paper, write it as i say it. E-R-I-S-E-D-S-T-R-A-E-H-R-U-O-Y-T-C-A-F-R-U-O-Y-T-W-O-H-S-I"
"BOY!" Uncle Vernon bellowed, and Harry knew what was coming. Nevertheless, he tried to explain himself.
"No, how dare you?" He whirled around and walked past Harry back down to the foot of the stairs. "You're the one that's being unnecessarily rude, and melodramatic."
"That's part of why I let my dad keep...hurting you, even after I realized it was wrong. I was stuck with this mentality that 'if he's hitting him he's not hitting me.' And I know that's fucked up, but that was the only escape I had from that. My parents only loved me when they knew it would hurt you. Otherwise, I was unimportant, and even a nuisance, in their lives." Dudley looked sad, and this, in turn, made Harry sad.
"Yeah, most people haven't. It's like this big taboo thing, for some reason. To not be normal, I mean. That's how I realized that what I was doing to you was wrong. That just because you weren't what I considered 'normal' didn't mean you deserved to be mistreated for it. I realized that I wasn't what everyone considered 'normal,' either. That when other boys talked about how big a girl's breasts were, I didn't feel anything. Then I thought, 'oh my god, am I gay?' But when I thought about boys that way I didn't feel anything either. I thought there was something wrong with me. But I heard some kid talking about aromantic and asexual people so I asked them what it meant." Dudley smiled a little sadly.
"So yeah. That's my life. I wonder what Voldemort has in store for me this year."
"Wow. I wasn't expecting that. You used to be one of the main villains in my story. The first eleven years of my life are plagued by memories of you and your family just being awful to me. And you kept being awful to me until I was thirteen. I can't forget that." Dudley nodded in understanding, although his eyes seemed downcast. However, Harry wasn't done just yet.
"Bloody bastard."
Once again, not a terribly long chapter. I'M SORRY, OKAY? I'm not good at this, lmao. I like this chapter overall. I think this is the first chapter I'm the happiest with, despite the fact that I think it's also the shortest (I wonder if there's any correlation to that). Anyway, yes, I made Dudley ace, and it wasn't planned at all. That was spontaneous as hell, and I don't know what possessed me to do it, but it happened. I hope you like it though. I'll see you in the next update, which I hope is also soon. At the very most five days in between, lol.
"Yeah. um, no problem." Once again, the atmosphere had turned awkward.
"What's that?"
"They don't teach us about that. Do they teach you?"
"Yes, yes, I know you're on a diet, but you deserve a cheat day."
"I could explain all the science you undoubtedly don't care to know, or you could take my word for it." And she had been right. He hadn't wanted to know.
"Ah, jeez, dude. You should put ice on that." He cringed.
"Man, sometimes I swear your dog is human."
Sirius blushed a little.
"Where do you think YOU'RE going?" Aunt Petunia screeched once more as he made his way to the kitchen, blocking the entrance. This was honestly getting old.
"Hey," he gently urged, setting all the food aside and drawing Draco to him (ignoring his stomach's angry protests). "Unbox that anger. We're still talking."
Godrick's knob, Harry shouldn't have let Malfoy have the rest of that potion. He was flip enough without it lowering his inhibitions.
Best of luck,
Harry briefly entertained the idea of storming off, but he quickly thought better of it. Janine, batty as she was, hadn't meant any harm. It wasn't fair to take his frustration out on her. Besides, she was a patient.
because it was part of Harry's life.

"You're right... I may never like you, ever. I can't easily forgive you for what you did. And I certainly doubt I'll ever be comfortable with you around my home or my daughter, but it doesn't mean we can't be civil when we do have to interact."
Harry heaved a dramatic sigh but finished it off with a smile. "As you wish," he graciously replied. Having dessert there would at least let most of the patrons filter out and the terrible congestion outside the building clear away before their departure. And he had been impressed with the food so far.

scared you away from class.
Truth be told, he did look slightly ridiculous in such a casual and ill-fitting outfit, but who cared? It was just them in the house. Plus there was something appealing about Draco in Harry's clothes.
Added: Draco lives in an open bi-level. In case that lay-out confused anyone.
"So," the blonde began as he grabbed the bag back up and walked to his expansive kitchen, "my news. My mother sent word. I shall spare you the finer details and say simply she has approved of you. Her exact words were 'He'll do.' With her on my side father has no chance!"

Dear Harry,
Potter retrieved his spectacles from the nightstand and balanced them on his nose. "Well, it's still bloody impressive. Wizards have been trying to figure out a potion like that for almost as long as there have been animagi."
Delightful.
He widened his knees to wank more effectively and pinched his own nipple through his robes, staring pure, molten sex at Potter as he did so.
...Salazar, he may have just given himself a new kink.
Dear Malfoy,
Instinctively, Harry reached out his hand, placing it on Malfoy's tense forearm. "Hang on, then," he urged, mind racing to make sense of the scene. "You came to see me for a
Draco smirked and shook his head at his boyfriend's grin. He just knew the man had so many jokes he wanted to make but was holding them back. His arms wound back around Harry's neck as he was dragged into a kiss, already carefully dragging them back to his extremely large, pillow stuffed bed. He twisted them around just before his knees hit and shoved the Auror out of the kiss and backwards over the edge of the bed. Draco immediately followed, straddling his thighs.
Draco wiped his mouth off with the one available napkin Potter had managed to grab him with the biscuit and ran it over his hands to make certain they were clean. He took his tea back from Potter before they began their trek from the lifts to wherever the Auror's office was. The Slytherin Prince was oddly quiet, though it could have been his frayed nerves. He put the cup into a passing receptacle after a long swig (it burped) before he lifted his hands to cross over his arms--like a loose hug with himself--and obediently followed. He nodded jerkily at the mention of the pensieve.
Harry scoffed.
"You know that I quit the Aurors because I was injured, right?"

Trading glass for spoon, he pinned Malfoy's foot between his legs so he could capture it and bring it onto his lap. "No one in their right mind would ever call you
"But we have the advantage," Draco continued as his air intake seemed to pick up, the blonde was desperately trying to control his nerves through deep breathing. "My bedroom is cloaked and the door and walls automatically lock when I'm inside. They can't see us or get in, yet... The wards on my bedroom keep anyone I don't invite in with me out, but they're weak. She'll break it in under a minute."
Harry rolled his eyes and opted to continue stuffing his face with crisp fried potatoes instead of dignifying the question with a response. But Malfoy persisted—
"Thanks, Luna," Harry answered meaningfully, voice muffled by a fall of cornsilk hair.
"You're a clever little thing, aren't you?" Potter continued, wholly unaware of Draco's struggle. "And so handsome!" Draco resisted the urge to preen, but he did rub himself against Potter's fingers. (Added to the list of things he would

I appreciate the generous self-sacrifice of you living with me these past several months. That sounds snide but I mean it sincerely. I wouldn't even be on probation now if it weren't for you, and I am not too proud to admit that I sleep better at night knowing you are there.
It was once my dream job, yes. Then I decided I had had quite enough of danger and adventure.

...The number of which dwindled when Ron chased his brother out the door and Dean and Seamus followed (the latter mouthing, "Sorry!" on his way past). Hermione frowned after them but stayed behind to see the conversation trough.

But I will stay another day. It's the least I can do after all you've done for me. I will beat this bug yet.
Arthur cleared his throat, capturing the attention of all in attendance. "Come, let's sit," he urged with quiet authority. "Please." He unbuttoned his tweed coat, revealing a pale green waistcoat underneath--threadbare and faded with age and pulled tight over his rounded belly--and seated himself near George. Ready to intervene if necessary, Harry thought.
"Didn't you?" Harry fired back, shoving his hands into his pockets to keep from doing something regrettable with them. "The timing is rather convenient."
Someone familiar walked up behind Harry that made Draco's eyes widen with surprise. Blaise Zabini, perhaps having followed Harry--though he was certain Harry would have realized, was waltzing up to them like he owned the place (a swagger he perfected thanks to Draco himself, the former master of such a skill.) At first he merely nodded politely and moved to walk past them before pausing upon sudden recognition. Draco could see Harry tense up like an angry dog.
Harry's blood thrummed in his veins. He slicked his prick (breath catching at the feeling of his own hand; this probably wasn't going to last long) and cast the necessary spells. Draco watched him all the while with eyes gone dark and piercing.
"She's fine," Ron answered. "No fever and mum's got her on all the potions."
“What are you playing at, Malfoy?” Harry all-but growled, shooting up to his feet. His hands prickled, skin feeling far too tight, as embarrassment, confusion, anger, and want warred for dominance within him. “Why are you flirting with me? If you want to punish me that’s fine. I get it. I’m sure I deserve it. But
Except that no. This is miserable. My head hurts. My body hurts. ...Actually, my

Draco licked the edge of Harry's jaw where it met his neck.

Dear Harry,
"The collar's fine," he lied. He glanced quickly at Malfoy's outfit (the frosty colors and gaping neck and...chains?) and decided it would be best to pretend he hadn't been asked his opinion on it. "Why stay if you're only here to appease your father?" he asked, changing the subject.
"Sorry I took so long," he said with a small, apologetic smile as he approached. He took the chair across from Harry and accepted the proffered teacup.
“Bixby?”
While that wasn't strictly-speaking true, it was close enough. Especially where Malfoy was concerned.
Draco,

Draco held his legs, and even widened them, with a grip on the back of each knee. He pulled them as close to the bed as he could to give Harry plenty of room to maneuver and work at his hole. His cock twitched weakly in response, though the sounds he made increased.
"Be that as it may," he responded dryly, "I can't imagine many people would have been privy to the fact you had a soft spot for your infamous rival." It was news to him, certainly. "That gossip would have spread like wildfire. Unless you Slytherins are more loyal than I ever gave you credit for..."
Pain largely forgotten--a useful byproduct of the Dark Lord's 'tutelage'--Draco rolled until he was looking up at the man, untroubled by his lack of clothing. Potter left his hand in place, which meant it now rested on his naked abdomen; his palm was a scorching brand, his expression toward Draco open and inexplicably fond.
"So, heard someone was trying to kill you. I guess that happens when you act like a git and treat your friends like dirt," Ron smiled, but it wasn't too friendly.

"I don't think you'd let me off the hook so easily for such willful disregard of your instructions," he smiled (meanly). "I believe
"Bloody hell, why are we still wearing clothes?"
Potter's eyes darkened (and only then did Draco realize his spectacles were missing). "Allow me to rephrase," he replied, the husky timbre going straight to Draco's cock. "I like it better when I can hear your
Dear Malfoy,
"I am certain you would keep me warm," Draco purred while he began to stir as directed.

At least that meant he got to visit Hermione.
He couldn't help but wonder why he'd been invited back into the man's rooms, especially after his unwelcome intrusion earlier in the day, but he wasn't about to look a gift Gryffindor in the mouth. If he was doomed to continue this infernal entrapment, at least he could benefit from Potter's odd penchant for weasels and their ilk.
Draco appraised him speculatively. "Maybe. You are no longer scowling hard enough to ruin your pretty face so I think my work here is done."
Draco was waiting patiently for Harry's return (he was too lazy for impatience most days.) He was in the kitchen wearing only an apron and flicking his wand at a couple of pots and a pan. Chicken was browning, noodles were softening, and what looked like a thick tomato sauce from scratch bubbled gently as it was magically stirred. The oven was on and a glass pan sat near by covered in a layer of ricotta and feta cheese. The floo flared just as the noodles were being drained.
It was after midnight when Harry finally dragged himself out of his Floo. He'd be sleeping in the guest room that night--he was too exhausted to climb the stairs to his own room.
Dear Drakiekinns,
Neither was the experience as a whole.
As soon as they were on the doorstep, he pushed through the wards and in through the door, dragging Draco along behind him.
Harry snorted. That sounded exactly like Nancy. She was a dogged one, she was.
"Do you want to go out for dessert," he asked against Draco's lips, "or whip something up at home?" He had a definite preference between the two, but he'd let Draco choose.
"I should have known I would make even this look good." He chuckled. "You at least know how to wear a suit, even if it looks as hard as a brick. Why did you choose to wear something with such a stiff collar?"
At first I was certain your owl had to be a prank. George is working on a forgery quill that magically duplicates people's handwriting--it's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. But then I checked and found your magical signature all over the parchment and I owled your mother and she assured me that you are not in your right mind, which was frankly obvious from the content of your letter.

"I'd never had pumpkin juice before I got to Hogwarts," he said, looking back at Draco's open, fretful expression. "The idea of it sounded disgusting when I first heard about it. But other people liked it and it was around at every meal so I decided to give it a try. It was a bit of an acquired taste, but it's one of my favourite beverages to this day."
******
Draco shrugged, as if the whole thing was no big deal.
Yes, we are on to you. And we love you dearly.
Draco
I hope to adopt someday. More than once, even. (Feel free to pick your jaw up off the ground.)
Draco,
"Hermione and Ron are good," he replied, tone fond. "They have a daughter. Don't know if you knew that." Malfoy probably didn't care, actually, but it was good of him to ask. And it mattered to Harry, so he was going to have to start caring if this--whatever it was--was going anywhere.
Draco glared icicles as his protective gear was pulled away. At least the git had been gentle and didn't tear his hair out.

The easy, self-satisfied arousal of minutes earlier was replaced with a soul-searing, gut-wrenching, mind-numbing lust that had him pulling at the ropes until his muscles ached and his wrists were surely chafing.
of late."
"Until what now?" he asked cheekily as he forced Draco to wrap his legs around his waist in order to remain upright, causing Draco's cock to be sandwiched between them.
He wanted to roll around in that smell. To fill his fur with it so he could carry it with him always.
I won't use any embarrassing terms of endearment if you don't.
"It shouldn't be hard for me to translate," she asserted, turning her intelligent gaze on him, "but it will be time consuming." She tucked a wayward curl behind her ear. "If it's all right with you, I'd like to take your notes home with me. I promise I won't duplicate, publish, or steal any of your work, though I might like to try this potion after it's been perfected."
Harry’s brain stalled out, grinding uselessly inside his skull. He couldn’t possibly mean...
...I expected rather more fanfare.)
He reached over and twined his fingers with Draco's for a moment to say thank you.
Finally remembering himself, Harry took a deep, energizing breath, shook his head to clear it, and craned his neck to the left and right, releasing the pinching tension coiled there with a satisfying pop.
Draco's head fell back to watch his lover as he nodded and began to enter him slowly. Draco had played with toys before, as he so often stated (leaving out the detail of them never being particularly big, certainly not Harry's size at least), and obviously had a number of his own fingers inside, but Harry's cock somehow felt larger than anything as it slowly broke his ring. He did his best to keep his breathing steady as one hand pulled a pillow under his neck to avoid discomfort and the other laid on Harry's hip with a squeeze.
Malfoy blinked at him.
"I hope you mean your place. I don't think I could go back to mine tonight..." Draco closed his eyes a moment to regain some of his lost composure. "I am so tired I think I could sleep for a week."
*****
He willed himself to relax and let Draco explore. There was no other way to find out for certain whether he liked it or not. One hand rubbed his back comfortingly while the other stroked and pressed light circles between his cheeks. Once Harry stopped freaking out about it, he determined that the sensation was decidedly not bad. It still felt odd to have his arsehole fondled, but it was also surprisingly sensitive in a way he felt low in his belly and sparking through his prick.

"Watch it," Harry warned, checking his immediate and instinctive flash of anger as best he could. "You might end up like Zabini."
Draco
Your symptoms are concerning. You should be under the supervision of a qualified potions expert. Want me to come tend to you? I can help alleviate at least two of those problems.

Draco's eyes widened in surprise and sudden pain as he was tackled nearly backward on his chair. He instinctively wrapped one arm around the man's neck and returned his enthusiastic, bruising kisses with his own--sucking on the Auror's tongue wetly.  His free hand clasped his lover's firm ass through his jeans and squeezed tight. Harry's ass was planted on Draco's hardening cock, which prompted the blonde to buck up roughly.
With a last regretful glance, Harry snuck around the building and into the back entrance, bolting the door behind him.
That wasn't what Draco expected, but pleasant the surprise was all the same. He gasped as he was thrown against the door in a fit of animalistic lust and again as he felt the Auror's erection meet his currently flaccid (but not for long) cock. He barely had time to appreciate the man's outfit!
Harry shrugged, obviously none-too-concerned for his lack of punctuality. His grin widened as Malf--
How did he want to proceed? His stomach growled again, having a clear opinion on the subject. "How about we do dinner, for starters," he chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck in mild apprehension. "I can throw something together, if you'd like to stay?"
******
A confident knock echoed through the foyer, halting Draco where he stood. Potter was late, but he was there.
He scratched the back of his neck where it prickled under Malfoy's scrutiny; he'd turned to regard him fully while he spoke. "That worked all right for a few weeks," he continued with casualness he didn't feel, "until one day it didn't. My leg completely gave out under me. Godric, it hurt like a motherfucker. Almost as bad as the original injury. Maybe worse. At least then I had shock on my side."
Heaven.
He let the 'threat' hang in the air as he stood up from the floor and stretched the kinks out of his back--arms and legs tensing and pulling away from each other as each muscle was lengthened and slowly returned.
He parted his thighs to make space for Harry undoing his trousers while he attached his teeth to Harry's earlobe.
"Will it do for your makeshift clinic?" Malfoy asked, moving stiffly to seat himself and arranging his robes artfully once he’d done so—a practice Harry had never had the patience or skill to master. Given that the settee was the only chair in sight, Harry decided he'd be relegated to standing (which probably wasn't accidental, knowing Malfoy). "With Mother's bookshelves and pianoforte gone, it has plenty of open floor space."
******
He didn't even mean them, not really. They were the remnant of a petty schoolyard rivalry best left forgotten and the fact he felt out-classed in a battle of wits against the blonde.
"Stairs," Harry confirmed, no nonsense.

"I usually order the lemon shrimp with quinoa," Draco replied conversationally. "You'd probably like something heavier, though. Like the Poulet Basquaise. It's a hearty chicken stew. Classic comfort food."
“Bollocks,” said Harry, earning himself a surprised look. Good. “Draco Malfoy,” he continued, tone authoritative, “you are one of the most powerful wizards I know. You were top of our class at Hogwarts, second only to Hermione, and she’s a freak of nature. You restored an unusable vanishing cabinet
Draco grasped the bars above his head once more with another petulant huff, though whatever negativity he was feeling faded away immediately as soon as Harry complied. He nodded curtly.
were twenty-two... And that guy looked all of seventeen."
"... Please say you didn't drink any. I would really hate to think the only reason you chose to sleep with me was because of some potion."
The blonde looked down sharply and found his outfit was stained significantly, and bodily fluids were not easy to get out. Not that he would have

That is very open of you (and exactly like you, of course), but I do not think you comprehend the significant ramifications of such a union. You hate the press--anyone who isn't an idiot can see that--and you hate crowds. You think you are too popular now? If you date someone who was just last year an enemy of all the Wizarding world, your life will become utter chaos!

He openly gawked without thought to the dress being wound about his body to the point of crushing as Draco began to casually undress. He chuckled to himself at the thought that the pureblood had wanted to be so presentable for Gieves not ten minutes earlier and now didn't seem care one whit what the tailor saw.
That was it. Draco couldn't take it anymore. As soon as that rough, burning hand touched his already stimulated nipple--standing erect beneath his shirt from wave after wave of delicious tingle that accompanied Harry's skillful tugging--he came.
There was more grinding than was strictly necessary when Draco returned and Harry knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that this was the very best risk he had ever taken.
on the subject of his love life...or lack there of.)
Draco fell with Harry to the tub. He didn't bother with concern for personal space or care if the Auror happened to be too hot as he sprawled on top of him--his head on Harry's shoulder and his legs curled up where he sat between his lover's legs. The water was still going strong, washing away what was left of the mess. He chuckled warmly.
is a fabrication, I've no reason to believe that your supposed qualifications aren't, as well."
"Seems I'm a bad influence on you, Hero," Draco leaned into murmur in Harry's ear with as sultry a tone he could muster (considering his body was shaking and his legs felt like iron as they walked.) "So when we get back... I say I influence you into my bed and have my way with you. We already established how. Want me to go into detail or would that be too much?"
He thrust with abandon, movements becoming jerky and abrupt as his muscles and ligaments strained, the tension building to a critical threshold. He was on the agonizing cusp for what felt like an eternity, this orgasm not so easily won after the two that preceded it. He needed just a little bit more but couldn't get it on his own. Not tied up like he was.
Still holding Draco's legs in the air, he bent forward and licked a broad stripe across his entrance, tasting conjured lube and the blueberry stuff, mixed with the unmistakable musk of a man. He hummed with pleasure and went back for more, alternating fast and slow and an occasional foray inside.
Hello Boys and Ghouls! In honor of the holiday, I have risen from the grave to actually publish a chapter. Happy Halloween!
Draco
thought so.
Ron went to Hermione, unsure whether he should be seeking comfort or offering it. They moved as one to the love seat and whispered, heads bowed together, casting barbed glances in Harry and Draco's direction.
Draco bucked back hard and squeezed tight around Harry's invading prick in answer. He turned to look over his shoulder from where he gripped his large, dark-cherry headboard with a smolder and a grin. Harry didn't hesitate after that, thrusting with abandon into Draco's hot, tight chute. In no time the bed was screaming and banging against the wall, they were both covered in sweat, and Draco was throwing his head back with a deep, low moan as he came.
