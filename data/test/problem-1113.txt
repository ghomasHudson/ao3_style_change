"Need a hand?" his cousin asked, making Harry give him a strange look. Dudley had been acting weird ever since the dementor attack, and Harry wondered if a part of the boy's soul had been taken after all. Dudley acting
It was the people who weren't so nice that made Luna sad. She felt bad for them, for surely there was a reason they acted the way they did. So when they stole her things or teased her, Luna only smiled at them. Of course, what they did still wasn't okay, but she could hardly care. She had a friend now, just like her mother once said she would, a true friend.
Sighing, Harry closed his eyes, finally allowing himself some sleep. Of course, he woke a few hours later from the nightmares of that night in the graveyard. This wasn't unusual, however, so you'd think he'd grow used to watching the Hufflepuff die over and over again. He wasn't. He had grown used to a few hours of sleep a night though. At this point, sleep just seemed pointless.
"Something no one should have to go through." She looked directly into Harry's eyes when saying this, her voice firm and assertive. It was almost like she was reassuring him about something, and he would have thought as much if they hadn't been speaking about Snape. Harry squirmed uncomfortably under her gaze, breaking their eye contact.
It was a long drive to King's Cross Station, for Harry at least. He spent the entire time looking out the window, looking at all the different cars and buildings as they passed. Finally, they made it just ten minutes before the Hogwarts Express was due to leave.
"Right, well, sorry for running into you. I'm just going to go now, bye," the ferret said, jumbling over his words and talking so quickly Harry almost didn't follow what he was saying.
The day got even worse when he ran into someone on his way out and fell to the ground, his glasses being knocked off his head in the process. He cursed under his breath, as he searched the dirty floor for the things he couldn't see without. Seriously, he was practically blind without those things.
"Listen, Harry, I know I got kinda out of hand before, and I swear I'm not usually so dramatic. I just hate when people lie to me, so could you please...not?"
Draco then slowly moved his arms from around Harry so that he was no longer touching him but he didn’t shrug off Harry’s arm that was still around his shoulder and didn’t seem physically uncomfortable so Harry didn’t move.
Draco had written a little section about this that he wanted to include in this part of the book in which he formally apologised to Hagrid and explained the cause of his actions and how he regretted them. Draco had never known what happened to Buckbeak and was happy when Harry had told him the full story. They laughed when they realised how furious Lucius would be about the whole thing. As Draco was still insisting on being named throughout, Harry was of course happy to include his section.
Hope it was worth the wait. I'd really love to hear what you think. our comments are what motivate me to keep going, without them I'd have probably given up long ago but you give these stories life. Without you there just silly little ideas in my head so please talk to me about anything!! I answer every one of them! :) <3
Harry nodded again. “Yeah I can now, as long as I’m in the right frame of mind then everyday stuff around the house is pretty easy but it wasn’t always and sometimes even now I lose control of it. I did have to work hard at it in the beginning too.”
For a while it had just been him and Harry, nothing else had mattered. Now Draco became aware of the other things in the room again such as the main course plates that were still on the table. How long had they been talking for?!
“You look lovely tonight Daphne.” Harry said, walking through the light large hallway. “Sorry I should have said earlier.”
“I told myself to get over my ridiculous obsession though. I never ever thought I’d actually ever have you.” Draco carried on explaining. “When I moved back to England I was bored of casual sex and I didn’t think I could get any enjoyment out of anything else so I just thought I’d be alone. I never thought about you, avoided the papers, never saw your face and just lived my life and focused on the business. Then one day, just as I’d finally opened my shop, you walk into my office and turn my world upside down again.”
Just then a beautiful silvery stag bounded past him that almost took Draco’s breath away but it was gone before he knew it and he was left wondering if he’d really seen it. He turned to look at Harry behind him who had his wand drawn.
“It’s fine Draco, I’m glad you’re here, really I am. You don’t need to apologise to me. I’m the one who is sorry.” Harry replied. “I pushed into your home, into your private life without being invited. I didn’t listen to you or respect your boundaries. You had every right to get angry at me.”
“Come on, get the fresh parchment.” Harry said giving Draco’s leg a little poke. “I’ll tell you the whole story and you can take notes.”
“I didn’t think I would have… options, as you put it.” She said looking now at Harry. “But I find myself grateful for them, thank you.”
“The later I think, maybe you should also say that the engagement ended because you found out I still had a lover in France or something, suggest to them that you think I might have returned there but that you really have no idea and couldn't care less. Will you draft something today and let me see it before you send it please?” Draco asked and Daphne nodded.
“He was actually pretty good about it, I think he might have even expected it.” Harry replied. “Robards didn’t get it all and was trying everything to get me to stay but Kingsley knew I’d made up my mind even though he said I’d be missed. I told them it should be Ron though and I meant it. I know you guys tease him but he’s actually really good. He’s always been in my shadow, always been my partner and second best. Everyone gives me the credit for our efforts as a partnership, yes our stats are the best of the department but no one seems to understand that I couldn’t have done most of it without him. He’s solved most of our cases and he jumps into the field with the most appropriate spell. His instincts are good and his confidence has grown a lot, he’d be a good leader and he deserves it more than I do. So I convinced them to give it to him and let me leave. Ron won’t need a partner as Head Auror anyway and it will soften the blow of me leaving for him, he’s the main reason I haven’t left before to be honest. Once they got their disappointment out the way they didn’t need much convincing. They both respect Ron a lot and his record speaks for itself, he has a lot of love in the department, he’ll be fine.”
“And I’ve told you that you have to come! You’ll have to close the shop that day anyway seeing as I’m taking the day off so you can’t use that as an excuse.” She countered.
“It would be better in the long run too.” Harry said hoping again he wasn’t overstepping but wanting to try and persuade them that this really was the best option. He wanted justice for Draco and Lucius deserved to be locked up. “He will be secured as a criminal not just as a patient. Either he’ll be a permanent resident of St. Mungos or if he gets better then he will be arrested and tried for his crimes instead of just released from hospital care. Also if he is a criminal then it would help your divorce case immensely, he wouldn’t have any rights so you could probably get your inheritance back Draco, if you wanted it.”
Draco seemed like he was trying to say something but he didn’t know how to say it. He seemed tired and stressed. He was dressed in the same outfit that Harry had first seen him wear as Pierre and Harry figured he’d probably come straight from work.
“Firstly, the very first conversation I had with Harry determined that if he once hated you that doesn’t matter because he doesn’t anymore and I told you that. Plus he is no longer an auror if that is a concern to you.” Daphne pointed out.
Louis already seemed like a very chilled out baby and certainly didn’t seem to mind the hustle and bustle of the Burrow. It was probably a good thing that he’d been born into the chaos of a family gathering as he seemed to be used to it already! Victoire had been quite a difficult and clingy baby but then she had been born during a very different time where people were still stressed and grieving after the war. Teddy had been even worse than her but then his first year had been very challenging for everyone. Thankfully he had grown into a calm and accepting child.
Draco had provided very detailed drawings of exactly what he wanted but he still knew he’d have to supervise the work which had added complications. He had a brief moment of panic when he recognised the two wizards that came to do the work, Gryffindors from his year at school. He was grateful for his business alter ego he’d spent so long on. He’d practised lengthening and darkening his hair by magic enough that he’d perfected it now and even got Blaise to get him some muggle lenses to change his eye colour. Thomas and Finnigan didn’t look twice at him when they introduced themselves and they immediately got to work. Draco had to admit he was quite impressed, he always thought of these two as clueless idiots but they knew what they were doing. He was once again forced to remember that school was a long time ago and it seemed everyone can grown up and changed.
“Yes,” Daphne said, gathering her thoughts again. “Well like I said he just wants to talk to you. I’m not sure what about exactly but… well I think he’s got something going on at the moment and it’s probably the real reason why he quit the aurors. I get the impression he didn’t like it much and I think he quit. I don’t buy this ‘mutual decision’ rubbish. He said… now let me just remember this exactly…”
“I’m not joking. Draco really is my boyfriend. We’re living together, he’s not moving out. We’re officially a couple and it’s serious.” He said sincerely and rather quickly. A bit like just ripping a plaster off.
“Well I always liked Herbology, maybe you and I could take a proper look at the greenhouse tomorrow. If you wanted? Perhaps we could spruce it up a bit” Said Proudfoot.
“No they didn’t make me leave, it’s not like that.” Harry said quickly. “I’ve been thinking about leaving for ages really... I’m sorry I didn’t talk to you about it but I knew you’d always convince me to stay and to be honest I felt bad about leaving you, we’re partners you know… but, erm, well they told me that they were going to offer you the job, -congratulations by the way-” Harry said with a genuine smile and Ron gave him a little half smile back. “I knew you wouldn’t need a partner anymore so it just felt like the right time for me... Truth be told, my heart’s not been in it for ages.”
“Nice to know that you’ve given up on me entirely bro!” George said to Charlie. “I’m only 27 I could still trick some witch into marrying me and having my children!”
“Papaya.” Draco corrected. “Mixed in with ginger kombucha. You drank it remarkably well. Some people turn their nose up at it.”
Turned out it wasn’t nearly as bad as Draco expected. He was worried that his pre-bed meditation would be affected with Harry in the same room, and it had been really, but then it hadn’t seemed to matter as he slept well anyway. Maybe the meditation wasn’t really needed now that he was actually happy... that would be something.
Harry stiffened. How did rumors get so out of hand? Shagging, honestly; the thought repulsed Harry. It had nothing to do with Luna, she was wonderful. Sex had never appealed to Harry, for many reasons. Shivering, Harry shifted awkwardly in his seat, well aware the entire school was watching him.
Scanning the beds, he looked at each of their occupants, stopping at Pansy's for a moment to glare at her sleeping figure, and then moving on. Malfoy was nowhere to be found, and Harry half-considered checking in the beds surrounded by curtains, though somehow he knew the blond wouldn't be there.
"That might have worked, except for one tiny detail...LUNA AND I AREN'T TOGETHER!" Ron stepped back, hands held up in surrender, while Harry glared daggers at him.
"Now, you can either tell me what that was all about, or we can forget it ever happened," the redhead said, as the two walked out of the bathroom. Harry was silent the entire way back to the Great Hall, where he'd left his bag. He gulped, not wanting to go back in.
Letting his glamour fall, Harry faced away from the mirror. He shrugged his robes off and let them drop to the ground before removing his tie and untucking his shirt from his trousers. He bent down to pick up an old shirt of Dudley's that he was sleeping in that was on the ground.
"Sorry about what? What happened to him?" Harry asked, genuinely curious as to what his Potions professor could have possibly gone through. Luna stared at him for a few seconds, a more definite frown appearing.
Harry slumped back into bed, closing his eyes and listening to the grumbling of Parkinson on the other side of the room. When the doors to the wing opened, Harry didn't even bother seeing who it was, his eyes much too tired and relaxed to open. That is, until he recognized the voice that spoke less than a moment later.
"That the best you got, or are you waiting for your girlfriend to come and save the day? Word on the street is, she's just as mad as you!" The Slytherin smirked, knowing exactly how to get a reaction out of him.
"No, I didn't. Is there a way to get rid of them?" She giggled, and shook her head slightly, while a rare smile graced Harry's face.
"Give me a minute, that was exhausting." Harry sighed, before letting out a yawn, his eyelids growing heavy.
"What, no snarky comeback? You're not going to pull out your wand and try to hex me? Punch me, maybe? Has Malfoy gone soft?" Harry smirked, watching as the ferret's head whipped up.
Looking away from the Slytherin, he spotted Luna waving at him. Well, that's what he'd thought until he realized she was beckoning him over. Harry hesitated, contemplating the pros and cons of sitting at the Ravenclaw table. In the end, Harry made his way over to her, trying his best to ignore everyone else in the room.
And then her lips were on his, and though he refused to kiss back, she didn't stop, instead moving to his neck. Harry was frozen in fear; it felt like years, and he just wanted it to stop. He jumped when Pansy's hand moved to his crotch, right before she was pulled off of him.
Harry let a small yelp of pain out, releasing the shirt and clutching his chest, which didn't help any. He whipped around so he was facing the mirror and studied his bruises that, for the most part, had faded to an ugly yellow. Unable to look at himself any longer, Harry bent down as quickly as he could and picked up the shirt, ignoring the pain in his chest. He threw the fabric on and finished changing, walking out of the bathroom and tossing the clothes into his trunk.
"Friends don't lie to each other." But didn't they? Ron and Hermione lied to Harry all the time and vise versa. And it wasn't like it was anything important, just a small fib.
Harry looked in the mirror one last time, casting a glamour charm before leaving the bathroom, shutting the door behind him on his way out. He walked down the stairs and checked to see if the cupboard had been unlocked yet. When it opened, he pulled his trunk out, grunted at the amount of effort it took.
Letting himself smile just a little longer, Harry continued on his way to the Great Hall, with a feeling that was so close to happiness, he desperately wanted to believe it was. So close, and yet he felt miles away from happiness.
"Sorry, sorry! I'll just...sorry!" Harry frantically apologized before standing up and walking out as fast as he could in his condition.
"Nothing, I just figured since she's your girlfriend, I could make you worry about her worrying or something. It made sense in my head, alright?"
"Can I borrow your wand, Ginny? I left mine up in my dorm, and I'd rather not go up there again." Nodding, Ginny passed the wand over to him.
"Sorry..." Just as Ginny was opening her mouth to say something, Madame Pomfrey came up to Harry and closed the curtain behind her.
"Oh my, would you look at the time? We're going to be late for dinner if we don't leave soon," Luna said a few hours later, looking at Harry, who was now working on Potions work. Harry groaned, setting down his quill and closing his eyes.
"Harry, oh my god, are you alright?" Ginny asked, springing up from the neighboring bed she'd been sitting on. Harry, finally seeming to notice he'd been injured as well, took a minute to examine the casualties before nodding slowly.
"Save it; I won't tell anyone. Just leave me alone, and we won't have any problems." Harry turned away and opened his trunk. He grabbed some pajamas and walked into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.
"Yes, MP," Harry sighed sadly, looking at his lap. His eyes widened when he realized what he'd said. "I meant Madame Pomfrey!" He could hear the muffled laughs coming from Ginny, and he rolled his eyes.
"Maybe you are loony, going around making friends with that girl, not to mention that whole ordeal with the 'horses' a few nights ago. How would you know if you were crazy or not?"
"It most definitely is not! And what about you, then? Now that you've moved on from me, who are you so helplessly infatuated with?"
"Potter, must you always be such a nuisance? The halls are for walking through, not obnoxious laughter and yelling." Snape sneered at the spawn of James, who was resisting the urge to roll his eyes. He didn't want to lose any more house points than the ones Snape would unquestionably be taking any second now.
"Oh I'd love to, really, but I'm chasing down the wrackspurts right now." Harry didn't even try to hide his confusion, and Luna gave a small laugh at the expression on his face.
"Harry, are you alright?" Hermione asked, noticing how tense he had become. Ron looked over at the question, and they both stared at Harry, expecting an answer.
He quickly fixed his chair and got out his Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook, as well as a fresh sheet of parchment. He pulled out his quill and examined the nub that was already looking sketchy. He hadn't bothered to buy a new one for the year, seeing as he already had a few unused ones in his trunk. Deeming it alright, for the time being, Harry inserted the dull tip of his quill into the ink well and started on his homework.
He'd heard of friends that outgrew one another or simply fell apart, but he hadn't ever thought that would be the three of them. They'd been through so much shit together, he thought they were closer than the closest of friends. Harry wished he still had hope for the three of them, but he'd given up on hope a long time ago.
"Would you rather be expelled, Miss Parkinson?" Professor Snape spat, glaring at the furious girl who had a nasty scowl plastered onto her face. Harry raised an eyebrow at the scene, finding it quite odd that Snape would be threatening to expel one of his
He laid in his bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering why the last one was bothering him as much as it was. No snarky remarks, no glares, not even a glance his way. It seemed the blond ferret was avoiding him, why, Harry hadn't a clue. It had only been a day, after all, maybe he was thinking too much into this.
After a few hours, Harry fell asleep, and stayed asleep until he was shaken awake by Hermione, who was already changed into her robes.
"Ginny, hi," he sighed. Harry didn't really know whether to be relieved it was her or ashamed for being caught during his meltdown.
Harry's uncle was standing near the door with his arms crossed, tapping his large foot impatiently. "Well, get a move on now! You should be grateful we're taking you, you freak!"
Stepping outside of the hospital wing after four days of being cooped up in there was like a breath of fresh air. He was terribly behind on schoolwork, even if he'd gotten a fair amount done while bedridden. Turning a corner, Harry saw Luna and Ginny at the far end of the corridor, and he couldn't help but sigh. It was painfully obvious they fancied one another, to Harry at least. Yet again, Harry had to deal with this, though Ginny had said she'd seen Ron and Hermione snogging, so maybe that ship had finally sailed. Why hadn't the two told him?
"Hello, Harry. Did you need something?" Her voice was dreamy, a truly pleasant sound. She had turnips hanging below her ears, and her wavy hair framed her face. She had a necklace made of old bottle caps and a magazine in her hand.
"Mr. Potter, I insist you quit that nonsense this instant. You could lean too far back and crack your head open, and I will not have blood splattered all over my books!" Madame Pince stated, coming up to him.
Professor Umbridge was yet another problem to deal with this year. Only a day, and it already seemed like she was trying to change everything. And the pink, the horrendous pink and lace that she wore make Harry want to puke. She'd been at his trial over the summer, which meant the ministry was now interfering with Hogwarts.
Madame Pince returned the hello, and Luna smiled, turning around and walking towards a shelf, scanning the spines before pulling out something on Goblin Wars.
When the two students had reached the library, they walked in, Luna insisting on saying hello to Madame Pince. Harry smiled, something he seemed to have done a lot more of in the half-hour or so he'd been talking to Luna. She was like a breath of fresh air in his life, something he seemed to value a lot less than he used to.
Harry tugged on the collar of his shirt then undid the top button. It was much too tight, constantly choking Harry, reminding him of things he'd rather not be reminded of. He loosened his tie, finally feeling like he could breathe fully. It was torture, wearing that thing all day.
"Not hungry," Harry replied, sitting up in his bed. He was hungry, but it wasn't like that was unusual. He was still a tad bit mad at Hermione and Ron, though he wasn't entirely sure why he was upset with the ginger.
"You didn't tell me your ankle hurt, Harry. You said you were fine," Ginny sighed as she got back in her bed, Harry doing the same. He looked over and saw a look of genuine hurt on the girl's face, making him feel a twinge of guilt.
"Of course there is, silly." And then she walked away, leaving Harry standing alone in the hallway, confused and yet more calm than he ever remembered being in his entire life. She really was something, she was.
"Oh, I was just spending some time with Ginny. She's quite nice, did you know?" Harry chuckled softly, smirking when he saw Ginny's flushed face.
"Hey Ginny, mind if I ask you something?" The redhead hummed in response, nodding her head for him to continue. "How come you never talked to me much before this year?"
Harry snapped awake at the screaming, nearly falling out of his bed in alarm. His eyes darted around for the source of the noise, landing on two individuals in the far corner of the hospital wing.
Sitting down, Harry frowned when he noticed no one was seated in close proximity to his friend. Didn't she have any other friends? Surely Harry couldn't be the only one...right?
"Then don't. And for future reference, her name's Luna, Hermione." And with that, Harry stood up, forgetting his dinner entirely, not that he'd been in the mood for food anyway. He left the Great Hall, furious and annoyed.
Regardless, Harry took a seat and got himself a small portion of Shepard's Pie, trying to overlook the many staring at him to no avail. The attention he received always bothered him; why would now be any different?
The next morning, Harry was in a mood all through breakfast. He'd snapped at Hermione when she bugged him about eating more, ignored poor Neville who asked him if he'd completed all the work they were given over the summer, and left the table when Ron and Hermione started their usual bickering. Today was one of his bad days, that was fairly obvious.
Harry was done. He stormed out, something he seemed to enjoy doing quite a lot, still in his pajamas. He saw Hermione reading a book in the common room, but ignored her when she called out his name and walked out the portrait door. He jumped when he saw something on the ground. Though he quickly realized it was a someone, with vibrant red hair and Gryffindor robes.
"BOY! GET OVER HERE NOW!" The Gryffindor sighed, and walked into the living room, dragging his trunk along with him, Hedwig's cage resting atop it. Where the bird was was a mystery to the boy, he'd let her out last night and she hadn't yet returned. But she was smart, she'd find her way to Hogwarts eventually.
"'Course Luna, see you then," Harry said before he walked off towards Gryffindor tower. He was about halfway there when he paused, hearing shuffling around in the nearby broom closet. Tentatively, he walked towards it, gripping the handle cautiously before he swung the door open.
Sighing, Harry leaned against a nearby wall, leaning his head back and shutting his eyes. Taking a few deep breaths, he felt his anger retreating, only mild annoyance remaining. Though the pain lingered, the pain he got every time he took a fucking breath.
"You're welcome, though any decent human being would. Oh, and you'll never guess what I saw the other day! Ron was snogging the living daylights out of Hermione, and I thought I was going to throw up. Poor Hermione, falling for an oaf like my brother," she ranted quickly, and Harry wondered why he'd ever thought she was quiet. Speaking of which...
Harry groaned, sitting up from his bed in the hospital wing. Looking around the room, he noticed it was considerably more full than usual. After Ginny had yanked Parkinson off of him, she'd started attacking, and then it had turned into an all-out brawl between everyone, though Harry and Ginny were unquestionably outnumbered.
"Hey Harry," she said as she passed him in the halls. What was going on today? It was like his world had turned upside down, and it was only the first day back. Well, second day, if you count the train ride and dinner, which he didn't.
Harry nodded, and together the two were able to get Harry's things into the trunk. "Thanks, Dudley." The boy nodded and hopped into the car, Harry following.
"So," Ginny said, flopping onto the bed she'd been sitting on when he'd woken up, "you like anyone?"
Harry laid his head back onto his pillow, his eyes fluttering shut. He figured he'd get some sleep since there wasn't much else he could do.
"Maybe," Harry shrugged. "Everyone else seems to think so anyway. Now, this conversation is  odd enough, so I'll be on my way now." He could feel Malfoy's eyes on him as he left towards the bathrooms.
"Mr. Potter, you cannot leave this bed until I say so, you hear me? You have far greater injuries than the rest, somehow, and you will leave when I see fit!"
"Luna Lovegood. I've been able to see the horses since first year, they've always pulled the carriages. Your just as sane as I am." Luna's voice was dreamy, and she smiled a lot. Harry didn't find many things to smile about these days.
"Don't you think Lovegood'll be worried; you barely had a bite yesterday night as well. Come to think of it, I haven't seen you eat much at all since we've gotten here," Ron said, though it seemed like the last bit was more to himself than Harry.
"Of course, just wait out here a few minutes." He nodded, and leaned against the wall next to the door, closing his eyes and groaning softly, suddenly feeling tired. He hadn't got much sleep last night, or any night for that matter. If it wasn't nightmares, it was strange dreams he couldn't explain.
Our family. Unusual, obnoxious and loud — but it’s the family we have chosen for ourselves and who have chosen us in turn. Nothing is more important to me than that.
Can you please enlighten me as to why your other parent seems to want us to live in this miniature home forever? I’m seriously annoyed now, and have been for a while. Harry insists that him going back to work requires him to actually be working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day and when he gets home, he is too tired to even think about deciding what to eat for dinner, let alone actually looking for a house or eventually moving into one.
A year has passed once again, and it hasn’t been a quiet one. We have entered a new decade, so it should be ‘out with the old and in with the new’. And it has been, in good as well as in bad.
All in all, we are happy. More than happy, actually. I now have everything I’ve ever dreamt of — Harry, a family, friends, safety, and a home. Well, the home is actually a bit of an issue right now since I want to start searching for a bigger house, something more suitable for a family with children, but Harry seems dead set on staying in this flat forever. I can’t for the life of me figure why. Wouldn’t a nice house somewhere be a much better choice? I don’t even need a manor, just a proper garden, more than two bedrooms, maybe a little gazebo, a Quidditch pitch… Hell, anything we want really. This is something I won’t give up on, though. This is not a family home, but a place for bachelors or newly-weds. Which we’re not since we have our 8th anniversary in a couple of weeks, thank you very much.
The impact shook the whole table and the completed perfumes that Draco had already made fell off the edge and smashed on the floor. The cauldron shattered and remnants of the pewter pot went everywhere crashing into bottles and breaking them but worse than that was the boiling hot liquid from the cauldron that shot up everywhere. Draco threw his hands over his face to protect most of it but splashes of the liquid went all over his hands and down one side of his neck burning his flesh on impact.
Draco had somehow ended up sitting on Harry’s lap who was now occupying his desk chair but both of them stiffened up and turned towards the source of the noise. He was sure he’d heard the shop door open and close again.
He had made a fish curry before and it had been a hit so he thought that could be a good option for dinner tonight as there was a massive fresh fish stall too. In the past though he had cooked more Indian or Thai type curries and wasn’t that sure about Caribbean curry. The lady selling the spices was super helpful though and he spent quite a long time with her as she talked him through her favourite spice blend and how to cook them all off and make a paste. She even told him what else would be good in it and by the end of their chat he had a pretty good idea how to make a Caribbean fish curry.
Fred put his plate down on the coffee table and scooted over on the sofa towards Harry. He put his arm around him and pulled him close.
“Well thank you for making time for me, Professor. I will try not to keep you for longer than necessary.” He said with his cool Malfoy exterior firmly in place thinking that he didn’t really want to be here either.
“I know the deal, I’ve been telling myself over and over again for years that you're not my boyfriend and obviously I know that we’re not exclusive but I’ve been living my life as though we were. I told myself I was fine with the concept of an open relationship or whatever this is but I’m not really, it’s just not who I am. I’ve always thought that I was the one who couldn’t give you what you wanted. You needed more than I could give you so I was totally fine with you getting that elsewhere but you still made me happy so I thought it was working…”
A talk with Daphne was definitely in order. Draco owed it to her to make sure she would be happy with the changes. He would floo her later and discuss it all and then maybe they could meet Graham tomorrow over lunch after he’d had a chat with George. Draco definitely didn’t like the idea of Daphne being alone in the shop of course and he didn’t want her to think he was abandoning him but if Graham could work at the shop with Daphne on the days Draco wasn't there then that would work out well. To be fair, on the days where Draco usually brewed downstairs all day and Daphne ran the shop, they hardly ever saw each other anyway so he didn’t think she’d mind. If Harry managed to get these bands set up then at least he’d feel safer knowing he’d be alerted immediately if something was going on.
She took a moment to recover her surprise glancing at the hand on Draco’s shoulder and then back up at Harry. Then a small smile appeared at the corner of her mouth. “No, Mr Potter.” She said with a mischievous look that reminded him of Daphne. “It’s Ms Black now, like my son.” She said looking straight at Draco.
“My bedroom until Hogwarts was a cupboard under the stairs. It had a lock on the outside so often I was locked in there, sometimes only let out for bathroom breaks or to get food. I wasn’t always though, most of the time I had free reign of the house as long as I didn’t go into my cousin’s room or my Aunt and Uncle’s room... I wasn’t allowed to sit and watch TV either though so it didn’t leave a lot of places and if I was just around them Uncle Vernon would always complain about me being under his feet or in his eyeline so even when I wasn’t actually locked in, it was just easier to stay in the cupboard when I wasn’t needed... It wasn’t too bad, I managed to sneak in a couple of Dudley’s broken toys to play with and I would make up adventure stories in my head with these little toy soldiers I had... Some of them were quite good but I never had anything to write them down on… I haven’t thought about those in years actually… The rest of the time I was kept busy with gardening and household chores, things that Aunt Petunia needed doing and often I cooked for them, although I wasn’t always allowed to eat what I cooked. Sometimes I’d just get bread and water. If I was lucky I could eat the scraps off my cousins plate...”
“Yeah sorry, I have to.” Draco explained. “I’m behind as it is with some perfumes getting destroyed in the explosion and not having the rest of the day yesterday to work. Plus Graham had to work at the Weasleys in the end so those potions weren’t done either and I have appointments. I-”
After a short break at home Friday afternoon, he arrived to Ron and Hermione’s in time for a cuddle with Rose before her bedtime. Harry read to her and snuggled her to sleep thinking about how much he actually loved spending time with children. Once she was safely asleep in her cot Harry went down to have dinner with his two best friends. He liked this new Friday night tradition and they agreed they would make it a weekly thing too. Ron said he was really missing Harry at work which made Harry feel a bit guilty but both Ron and Hermione said they could tell Harry was happier already.
“Of course we can mother, I know how much you liked your roses. They will grow again, I’m sure.” Draco said kindly.
The house elf seemed to be muttering to herself now more than anyone else as she was taking food off the trolley and onto the table. Draco on the hand was considering how thoughtful his mother had been to get Pinky safe and out the way and how on earth she managed it with no one noticing. He thought perhaps he may have been underestimating her.
“Yeah, how do you think he always managed to be places where he shouldn’t be and know things he shouldn’t know?! Annoying nosey git!” Draco said only half joking.
Who wants to see Draco get slightly drunk with margaritas and talk about Greengrass-Weasley babies?! I do!
“Fair enough.” Fred said, withdrawing his hand. “You sober enough to work out and use the floo now?” Fred asked half-seriously.
“It was good to get to know your mother more but I prefer this.” Harry said stroking down Draco’s long lean back with his other hand. “Just me and you, here in our home together.”
Draco followed Harry up the stairs into the twins flat. Despite all the times he’d been in the building for business meetings it felt wrong to be up here in their home. If he wasn’t careful he’d end up being friends with the twins… or maybe they already were.
“No I can’t because there are hundreds of white wines out there and some of them I don’t care for!” Draco insisted. “You asked me what I wanted and I want a glass of Sauternes, it’s my favourite.”
"You really are something, Luna," Harry said, tilting his chair backward so that only two legs were on the floor.
robes, wand, and book bag!" Saying the password so the stuff wouldn't rip the portrait up, he watched as his things came flying towards him, and grabbed them all. Passing the wand back to Ginny, Harry gave a quick thanks before moving to go to a bathroom and change. He stopped when he noticed a tuft of blond hair behind a wall at the end of the corridor.
The signs were all there, he supposed. With Ron and Hermione's countless bickering, and Harry's reluctance to trust anyone, something that had always bothered Hermione. The thing was, Ron and Hermione still seemed as close as they were before, if not closer. The thought made Harry frown, and he wondered if he'd done anything wrong. Or maybe this whole thing was all in his head, he did tend to overthink things. Shaking away his thoughts, he turned his attention back to the lesson.
They walked towards the doors, each with a limp, though Harry's was considerably greater. Just as Ginny was reaching for the handle, the door opened, and she jumped back in shock. Standing in the doorway, with her hands on her hips and her lips pursed, was Madame Pomfrey.
"I suppose." They began their walk to the Great Hall, which didn't take long since it was on the same floor as the library. With a final goodbye, both parted ways to their own tables, whispers erupting in the Great Hall as they became noticed.
Already exhausted, Harry slipped into unconsciousness, being graced with a few hours of peace before the nightmares corrupted his sleep.
"Ignore them," Luna whispered, grabbing his hand loosely, sending a buzz throughout the Great Hall. Harry felt sick, the bile rising up in his throat.
"We went to see Charlie in Romania for a few weeks, so that was nice. Fred and George apparated all over the house, making mum go crazy. She was ready to strangle them by the time summer was over. Bloody awesome, it was."
"Shut up, Parkinson," he growled, glaring at the girl in front of him. She cackled, along with Crabbe and Goyle, while Zabini rolled his eyes at his friends. Harry's eyes drifted to the blond, who was avoiding eye contact, lips pressed in a thin line.
"Are you gay, Potter?" Pansy asked, her horrid breath spreading over Harry's face. Harry felt as though he was going to suffocate, and just as he had decided to make a run for it the girl had placed both of her hands on either side of him.
Finally, Harry reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, saying the password and stepping into the familiar red and yellow room. He'd always felt the colors were a bit bright for his taste, but it's not like they have this entire room redone just because he asked. Well, they probably would have, actually, since he was the boy who lived. Harry rolled his eyes and shut the portrait door.
"I'm fine! Let's just get in," he replied, bewildered and angry. And there was the thought that he might be going insane, that was always comforting. They got into the carriage that was to take them to Hogwarts, along with Ginny and a girl with dirty-blonde hair.
"I'm fine," he responded, feeling a cold sweat rise. Luna didn't look very reassured, though she still smiled sweetly up at him. Harry felt lightheaded, like he was going to pass out at any moment. He took a shaky breath, and reached for a glass of water, his trembling hands causing the water to spill out, until he dropped the glass entirely, spilling water all over the table.
Ron and Hermione were whispering furiously, until Hermione slapped his arm, shutting him up, and turned to him. Harry stopped chewing, looking at her expectantly, wondering why she was holding her tongue. Hermione always spoke her mind, so her behavior was unusual and mildly unsettling.
Madame Pomfrey left after checking over his injuries, deeming him fit to leave in the next few days. Great, just what he needed. He always struggled more with homework when he had to learn everything himself instead of in class, not that he paid much attention most of the time.
"Oh, it was amazing! My parents took me to Rome, and..." She went into a long explanation of all the wonders of Rome, not that Harry was listening much, though she didn't seem to notice. When she had finally finished, she turned to Ron and asked about Ron's summer.
“And you think becoming friends with a man that I’m attracted to but can’t have will make me happy?” He scoffed.
Draco was shocked, too shocked to even react; he just sat stunned into silence behind his desk. He had a range of different thoughts and emotions running through his head at once that he didn’t know which one to express or prioritise. Part of him was happy to know that his mother was at least physically OK but part of him was sad that she had been so close to him yet he still couldn’t see her. The son in him always missed her as much as he tried to ignore the feeling. Mostly though was worried about what this might mean. He knew full well that his mother could not leave the Manor without Lucius knowing exactly where she was going and why. She would also be under a thorough questioning when she got back.
Your baby brother and sister are almost five months old now, and we fall in love with them even more every passing day. They look so similar and yet they couldn’t be more different. Oden is very quiet and happy all by himself, and Idunn is happy only when she’s the centre of everyone’s attention. And despite being non-identical twins and born almost at the same minute, they always eat with an hour between them (Idunn first and Oden an hour later) and subsequently do everything else within that same time frame, too. Sleeping, pooping, waking, crying. It’s truly a blessing both of us can be at home most of the time since twins are a full-time, all day everyday kind of work. My writing can wait until a more opportune time, and Harry’s taken an extended paternity leave from St. Mungos for at least a year, maybe even two or three. We both want to be home and present for all the firsts — when they learn to roll over, when they start babbling, maybe even their first words (which better be something other than ‘mommy’, even if I know Harry calls me that behind my back).
What crosses my mind just as often as your potential Hogwarts House is your character. Would you have a temper like us, a love for potions and not so much for rules? Maybe less Quidditch and more studying in the library? Or would you have been charming the pants off of every witch and/or wizard in Hogwarts when you got older? It comforts me to think about these things. It keeps you with me, very close to the surface.
The test could have been done a month ago, but my fear suddenly came back, stronger than ever. What if… What if I wasn’t able to... again? Would we survive it? Wouldn’t it be best to just hope without knowing? To not be crushed again? But today, in honour of your birthday, I decided to just do it and have the Healer perform the spell. And it was positive. I am 8 weeks pregnant.
Harry has been back at work for one or two days a week (now that he’s actually working and not building secret houses for me) to help those in need at St Mungo’s (and feel needed and helpful, I know my husband). I hear that the pediatric ward and its staff have been missing him, and that’s no surprise — he’s indisputably the best Healer they have. On the days Harry is home, I have been working a bit, too. Potions Quarterly has reached out to me and asked if I would write them a feature about a more effective cure for Dragon Pox, something I slowly and quietly started thinking about after the twins got sick. It’s a huge honour, of course, and I’ll do my best to deliver an article of high quality. Truth be told, I’ve been a bit eager to get some actual work done outside of raising and caring for our family. I consider it my “me-time”, and I think it’s important as well as healthy.
I hope you like the flowers we brought today. They are Zinnias, and they convey longing which I feel — now more than ever. (Even if I’m not ready to admit to myself what it is that I’m longing for. But you know me.)
Time sure goes by like a bunch of fireflies. Another year has gone by, and it has been a good one for us. The twins are now 2,5 years old and always on the move. Oden was a bit slow to start walking in the beginning, but now all they do is run around, normally chased by me or Harry, laughing and being extremely mobile and surprisingly hard to catch for their age. I’ve been trying to reason with Harry about getting a house-elf, but to no avail. I’m going to keep trying, though. He, on the other hand, has started talking about a magical nursery school where they could meet children their own age, but I’m still hesitant to let them out of my sight unless it’s someone we know and trust implicitly.
Harry gave a bit of a chuckle, he couldn’t help it. As far as he knew they’d never actually spoken to each other before but he found that he was actually enjoying this interaction.
Over the years he had developed more of a sense of style than he used to have but he still wasn’t great at it and often never left himself enough time to get ready properly which had been exactly what happened today. He pulled out his favorite pair of black suit trousers and crisp stiff collared white shirt. He left the shirt slightly open at the neck and tucked it into his trousers securing them with a black leather belt that had a simple silver buckle in the centre. Then he just slipped his favourite emerald green suit jacket over the top and finished the outfit with his smart shiny black shoes.
Potter finished a lot more confidently than he started and Draco thought it was very clever. Of course he wanted to know everything, of course he wanted to not only have access to the book before everyone else but to know more than everyone else knew... and he definitely wanted to control his own involvement in the story. How could he refuse that?
As always I'd love to know what you think. Your comments inspire me, motivate me and just generally make me really happy so if you're still enjoying this fic (and it hasn't bored you to death with how out of control crazy long it is getting) then please take two minutes just to let me know!
For a split second he was taken by surprise. “I’m sorry, your date was with Harry Potter and you just forgot to mention that?!” He said, lacking the energy to even try and keep the bitterness out of his voice.
“Yes of course I can see you idiot.” Harry said, rolling his eyes. He had spoken it affectionately through.
Weirdly that made Harry smile. He had no idea why, probably just the ridiculousness of the whole situation, but smile he did as he took Malfoy’s hand and accepted his help off the boat.
“Of course we would welcome him Harry. Whoever he is, if he’s good enough for you then we will love him like family.” Molly said reassuringly. “If he is good enough for you that is, if he’s not then I shall give him a piece of my mind. Is he good to you Harry? Are you happy? Please tell me that you’re happy you deserve that so much...”
Draco had stood up and held Harry for the longest time. Neither speaking, nor moving, just holding each other and providing comfort for one another in that moment. Hopefully they would always be there to give that to each other.
“You know, in some ways when I can ever tell Ron and Hermione about us, part of me doesn't think they’ll be surprised. I think they thought I was half infatuated with you that year, they certainly got fed up with hearing me talk about you.” Harry said light heartedly.
There was a pause for a moment as the two men looked at each other and then Draco cleared his throat. “So what about you?” He asked seriously.
“Just get them some more cloaks from Fred and George and have them apparate here under them and it will be fine. I can floo call them and give them the address. Having them know it as part of the fidelius charm won’t make the house any less secure, they still won’t actually be able to speak the location even if Lucius does somehow find out they visited.” Harry continued explaining.
She held his gaze and Draco was just considering whether he should hug her when Leo strolled in from the garden through the double glass doors in the room whistling as he left them open behind him. Neither of them had seen him coming and he didn’t seem to notice that he may have been walking in on a private moment between mother and son.
Harry interrupted her again. “Hermione, I appreciate it I do but I think it’s best if you just stick to advising me about the book and my mental well being! You gave me really good advice there and you do say a lot of things to me that make sense but I just don’t think I want you to set me up with anyone, I’m sorry. Things got a bit awkward between us before when you guys got involved in my love life and I just don’t want that, is that ok?” He said, trying to be honest but put it as kindly as possible.
“Sure, thanks.” Draco said as he smiled again. Harry looked into his eyes and thought that his new owl really was the perfect gift as he reminded him of Draco’s beautiful eyes.
Draco opened his drawer and got an elegant black gift tag out and another gold quill and ink set then placed them on the desk in front of Potter. “If you write it I’ll attach it on for you.”
“I am impressed you recognise me but maybe it’s those auror skills of observation.” She smiled sweetly. “Yes we did, I was in your year although I’m afraid I was a member of your least favourite house.”
He was still deciding what to say whilst finishing his mouthful but then she spoke again. “My younger sister is happily engaged, it’s very annoying.” Daphne said but she was smiling and there was no hint of bitterness there.
“Yes you are.” Draco said clearly allowing his possessive side to put him back in the mood. “No one else gets to kiss you like I do.” He said as he then proceeded to kiss Harry. He broke away and his hands ran up Harry’s back under his long sleeved top like he had earlier that day. “No one else gets to touch you like I do.” He added softly.
“It’s OK Harry, I know neither one wanted to come across too strongly too soon but I actually do much better if I know where I stand with someone and have a label for something too. I like rules and structure and I think it was only a matter of time before I lost my mind and asked exactly what we were doing here.” Draco said honestly.
“Yes that’s an idea, it might stop the waitress from fawning over you so obviously.” He said looking at Harry’s face carefully for any reaction.
Merlin, the man really does love his godchildren, or is it just kids in general that gets him looking like that. Suddenly he felt like this was an important moment but the subject had come up organically so Draco just went for it trying to sound as casual as possible.
Lucius spent a lot of time sitting in that same black chair by the fireplace reading. He had given Proudfoot a list of books he wanted from Malfoy family library and the list had obviously passed ministry inspection as they had been brought over the next day by one of the aurors conducting the search of Malfoy Manor. Lucius had also asked for (or demanded) a desk to be set up where the window seat had been with some parchment and quills, consequently turning the only sitting room into his private study and not really giving his son anywhere to sit. What exactly he was studying Draco had no idea but he didn’t feel particularly inclined to ask.
Then again, Draco had been through a lot over the past couple of days, well over the last month really, perhaps longer. It was obvious now that Draco had never really had an easy life. Harry was contemplating everything that Draco had shared with him. He was so furious with Lucius and he wasn’t giving up on trying to convince Draco to turn him in. He knew Ron would help and they could put Lucius away for good. For now though he would just try and encourage Draco to relax while he was here, get some sleep and eat properly. All those things would help. At least both of them felt confident that Lucius wouldn’t find Draco here.
So, where was he now, he wondered. Shouldn’t he be here, celebrating with his Weasley girlfriend and adopted family? The boy-who-lived-again, (as he would surely be known now) would no doubt want the attention of his devoted fans, everyone congratulating him on his victory. Maybe he was just waiting for his grand entrance. Hopefully Draco and his family would be gone by then so he wouldn’t have to witness it. That’s what Draco wanted wasn’t it? To never see his school rival again. Then he thought about whether he truly would ever see him again. I mean, of course he would see his face on the front page of every newspaper and magazine in the country no doubt and everyone would be talking about him, they always did. But would he ever really see him again, be in the same room as him, exchange words with him? Probably not. The war had been won, what reason would a Death Eater and the Chosen One possibly have to see each other. They were hardly going to socialise together. Maybe he would never see Harry Potter again and that would be a good thing, right? They had been enemies for so long but what would they be now? Strangers? Somehow that just didn’t feel right either.
"Ugh, what is it with girls and asking that? It's always the first thing they want to know," Harry muttered, rolling his eyes.
, mate?" If Ron wasn't alarmed before, he was now. Great, now everyone probably thought he was going mad.
"Harry, oh my god, are you alright?" a voice asked, though the Gryffindor was too distracted to recognize who it was, if he even knew at all. He did flush though, embarrassed at being caught in such a vulnerable state.
"That's what I said! So MP was all like, 'Immediate family,' so I rolled my eyes and tried to explain that all of your family was dead and I was family enough, but she still wouldn't budge!"
Shaking his head slightly, he began strolling over towards the fourth years but stopped abruptly. What if they didn't want him interrupting? They probably didn't; he should just leave. He had just turned around when he heard someone call out his name. Panic shot through him as he faced the direction of the voice, though he tried to shove it down.
"Ginny? What're you doing out here?" Harry asked, giving the lump on the ground a small kick. The girl snapped up and pulled out her wand, pointing it directly at Harry. He flinched, taking a small step back.
Narrowing his eyes, Harry walked towards the person slowly. As he got closer, he realized the figure was undeniably Malfoy.
"Hey, it's alright. Look at me, I'm right here." Harry didn't want to look up, he really didn't want to, but they practically forced his head up so that he had to look at them. Through his blurry eyes, he could make out a lot of orange, or...red hair?
He opened his eyes to the sound of footsteps nearing his proximity. Draco Malfoy was walking his way, nose buried in a textbook.
Surprisingly, the time has done its duty and everyone got along fairly nicely. It’s said babies do that to people, strangely enough. The twins were absolutely not impressed with having cold water drizzled over their heads (who would be, though?) and threw a proper tantrum which made my mother and Molly reminisce about some other bad-behaving babies. (Not me, I’m sure). In the end, Oden and Idunn were named properly and, all in all, it was a nice gathering, if fairly tiring for the twins (and their parents, too).
Ron and Luna’s first child was born not long after my last letter. Luna was adamant she would give birth at home, surrounded by Freshwater Plimpies and so she did, at five in the morning, to a very small boy they decided to call Humbert. Despite his size, he’s got very healthy lungs and such an appetite (after his father, I’m sure) that he makes it look like Oden and Idunn are on a strict diet.
I still can’t believe it, even though I have hoped, deep down, and sometimes even felt it before today. Especially when I’m hugging the toilet at six in the morning or snapping at Harry about leaving his socks on the floor. (Well, truth be told, that last bit doesn’t differ much from my normal behaviour, but this time, suddenly, the socks seemed like a much bigger deal.)
It’s our sixth anniversary soon, and Ron and Luna have offered to take the twins for the evening but I’m not all that sure I can be separated from them yet. It’s not that I don’t trust them, but… our children need to be with us, right?
It’s been a year since that awful day, and yet it feels like yesterday. A whole year since Daddy Harry and I lost the one we loved the most. The one we vowed to always keep safe and sound. You, our baby son. Scorpius.
And even worse, I’m fairly sure he’s keeping secrets from me.  I just know he’s up to something, and as much as I love surprises, I would rather a lot like to know what’s going on. I trust Harry enough to know it can’t be too bad, but I would still like to be informed. Any suggestions on how to worm myself into his head? He has learned way too much Occlumency for me to just sneak in. Luckily, Oden and Idunn keep me busy during the day so I don’t have too much time to obsess over it.
A lot has happened here since I last wrote to you. Ron and Hermione discovered they were better off as friends, after all. (I called it before, Harry wouldn’t want to believe me.) And now, your uncle Blaise seems to be spending more and more time in London, and in your aunt’s flat in particular. Interesting development, I’m sure you agree, but not an unwelcome one. We spent Christmas together, all of us — your Daddy Harry and I, Ron, Hermione, little Rose, Blaise and Aunt Luna. If last Christmas was a disaster and I couldn’t even leave the house, this one was at least tolerable. We had a good time and I got to hold your little cousin Rose which I hadn’t been able to bring myself to do before.
This year I’ll visit you alone because the twins have a bit of a cold right now and Harry has offered to stay home and try to keep two stuffy-nosed and extremely unhappy babies in their cots.
Once again, I light a candle under the canvas in which your constellation is painted - and think of you.
Along with the exceptional food, the greenery here is almost like no other, and from your grandmother’s garden I picked you yellow Zinnias this time; it means ‘daily remembrance’ and not a day goes by that we don’t think of you.
We just moved in not long ago, and I still have trouble believing it’s not just a dream. It has five bedrooms, four baths, a proper garden and play area for the kids, a grand kitchen, a sitting room and even a dining room (Although, Harry insists eating can be done in the kitchen, but how about dinner parties?). And he did it all for me! Or for us, I suppose, but I know the children only care about the garden and the play area so I guess the rest of it really is for me. I’m floored. Even after all these years, the amount of love your other father showers me with is baffling.
not a proper choice for a 5-course dinner.) He won’t notice, though, since all his most ratty Gryffindor t-shirts and hole-y joggers will stay firmly in place. He insists he keeps them for gardening only, but then I find him in the garden, on his knees, wearing whatever he was wearing at the moment inspiration for weeding hit him.
The 20th Anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts was held a bit over a week ago, and we were, of course, invited and attended, as were a lot of our family and friends. It’s always a bittersweet date to all of us, but this year things finally seemed a bit more cheerful and happy — like enough time has passed to fade most of the sorrow to make room for fond memories about the lost and loved ones. Time does what it’s supposed to, I think, for all of us.
This year’s flowers are a very selfish choice: Christmas Roses which mean ‘tranquillize my anxiety’. Merlin knows I need it. But writing to you always calms me down, and nowadays it even brings me joy and happiness instead of sadness and overwhelming grief. I finally think that everything is going to be okay.
These six years with Harry have been the most perfect time of my life though, even with all the desperation and sorrow, and it should be celebrated appropriately. If it’s even possible, I love him more and more every day. He’s been my rock, my never-ending and constantly loving support. He’s the best father any child could ask for and I never want to spend a single day without him. I don’t tell him often enough and he needs to know this too. Although, he knows me well, better than anyone, so perhaps he’s already aware.
You see, your Daddy Harry has brought up a wish for a baby sister or brother for you. But how can I even consider it when I’m still in despair after losing you? I admit, there are more tolerable days than completely awful ones, now, but how could I ever even try to replace you? Nothing and no one will ever be like you,
I think it’s nearly time for us to go visit you now, and after that Harry and I will go to the cinema — a Muggle entertainment I have come to enjoy a lot as it gives me other things to think about aside from the mess in my head. And I also like the popcorn, oddly enough, but it’s a hard pass for that poison Harry calls Coca-Cola.
I know, this letter comes at an unusual time, but I don’t care! Your brother and sister are finally here and dear Merlin, but they didn’t let me off easy. I’m still sore and in pain sometimes, but it doesn’t matter one bit — they are here! This is the first moment in three days that I’ve had even a bit of time to myself without your Daddy Harry hovering over me. I loaded him with our bundles of joy and made myself comfortable on the bed to write to you.
Summer is almost upon us, it’s already quite warm — Daddy Harry is constantly disregarding all common sense and warnings about his health and is sunbathing on the balcony. Although, I must confess — he is very handsome doing that. You, on the other hand, would have had my alabaster skin, so no sunbathing for you, my little man.
You turn 11 today, which means you would have gone to Hogwarts this year. I often wonder which house you would’ve been sorted into — Gryffindor after Harry or Slytherin after me? Or maybe Ravenclaw? Or Hufflepuff, like Teddy? It doesn’t matter really, of course, since every quality imaginable can be found in every person, regardless of which house they’ve been sorted into. You are your own person, not a carbon copy of your parents or grandparents, and that’s the way it should be. As your father, I would never tell you or your siblings what you have to be or what you need to do — it’s up to you to decide what is it you want out of life. The only thing Harry and I wish for is our children’s happiness, wherever it may be found.
In light of all these changes in our lives, I’ve picked a bunch of White Violets from our garden for you today in preparation for our annual visit to you. They symbolise ‘the courage of taking a chance when offered’, and that’s what life is often about. I will never regret taking a chance with Harry, and we wouldn’t be the same without you. No regrets, none, ever.
At the same time, I’m over the moon and so, so scared. The past is still haunting me, yet I finally look to the future with hope and joy.
Teddy has been with us, too, when he’s not at Hogwarts — last Summer, over Christmas and also for his Easter break a little over a month ago. The twins like him a lot and are so very fascinated about his ability to change his appearance, so he makes a terrific babysitter. The only downside (according to our double terrors) is the fact that they can’t do it themselves (and luckily Teddy’s abilities only apply to himself) since Idunn is hell-bent on having green hair with pink and turquoise highlights. (Un)fortunately, she has to wait until she’s of age (if you ask me) to commit such travesty. I already told Harry to steel himself for when she comes pleading about it. Oden isn’t much interested in his appearance, but he’s told us he’d like to have a beak instead of a nose. Luckily, that’s not possible either.
Your uncle Ron and aunt Luna finally tied the knot last autumn, and the wedding was as weird as it was beautiful — it’s Luna, after all. And oh, their honeymoon undoubtedly did its trick since they are expecting again. It is a bit quick, Humbert is only three, but at least they don’t have that much of an age difference and will attend Hogwarts together. They will surely have a full house soon — Rose is staying with them a fair bit now that Hermione is busier than ever.
I know I told you in my last letter, that I still was very unsure about our future regarding children or being pregnant again. But during the autumn, I found myself thinking about it daily. All the good and the bad — and every possible scenario in between — were happening one after the other in my head. By the time Christmas rolled around, I knew what my Christmas gift for Harry would be. First thing in the morning on Christmas Day, I got the present from under the tree and gave it to Harry. Normally, when it’s been just the two of us, we don’t even exchange the presents until after dinner and so he was a bit confused and a tad hesitant to open the box. But open it he did, and then, I swear to you Scorpius, he gave me the brightest smile anyone can receive and hugged and kissed me silly. Yes, perhaps you’ve guessed it already; it was the fertility potion. I was ready to try again and, of course, Harry had to be the first one to know.
But make no mistake about this, my little star, you will always be with us. As a constellation in the sky, as a daily reminder to keep going, as we bring flowers to your gravestone in Godric’s Hollow where you rest next to your grandparents, Daddy Harry’s mom and dad. Today, the everlasting bouquet will be Cyclamens. I don’t know how much I’ll be able to teach you, my son, but maybe one thing could be flower language. Merlin knows your Daddy Harry never got the gist of it. He would gladly bring you yellow Carnations on your birthday and be on his way.
