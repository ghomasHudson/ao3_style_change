Be honest with me. The words fly, bouncing along the tile, ricocheting towards the windows, and they break, letting in the windy misery of January. Shards rain down upon them, and Harry kneels, arms raising to cover his head, but he knows that when he stands, he’ll be somewhere else. In another dreary memory, reliving every painful moment from the past two years. He hopes it will go by fast but suspects that it won’t.
I make playlists for every fic I write, so here is a short one for Melancholia, including tracks from the story itself (Blue Moon, parts of Deftones' White Ponty, etc) and other story-appropriate songs from Radiohead, Frank Sinatra, and The Smiths.
“Do you recognize her?” Harry asks, and at the same time, Draco demands, “When did you record this?”
“Crybaby.”
Throughout his young but eventful life, Harry Potter had battled a dragon, faced Voldemort multiple times, and died, but nothing caught him off guard so much as Draco Malfoy kissing him.
“Then how’d you find out?”
“Maybe you should see this as an opportunity,” Hermione remarks, passing him a soapy plate. “To make a clean break.”
The beach house is painted dark blue, its inhabitants vacated, the white shutters and door still intact. He’s been here many times before, but never has it sagged this much, like a lover weary of arguing.
“That was fast,” Harry remarked, watching it roll away in the grass.
“No. I’m doing what’s right.”
he thought. But Draco’s robes were soft and warm and freshly laundered, and his shoulders rose and fell slightly with every breath, with a rhythm akin to a gently rocking boat…
Halfway through his rambling, painful account, Harry is interrupted by an employee coming in to grab a stack of files. He barely glimpses her face, only the top of her jet-black hair as she mutters, “Sorry, ‘scuse me.”
“Won’t you be disappointed that there are no exams?” Harry chimed in.
him? You
“I’m not dying today,” Draco said decisively. “Twenty-two is a stupid age to die.” His gaze flitted towards the remaining wizards. “Duck,” He said and yanked Harry to the ground as an array of Stunning Spells carved into the tree.
Cosmic music is too magical a concept for Harry to accept, but he humors Draco’s words for a moment, watching the heavens like a rapt audience member. For a moment, he fools himself, and imagines a stringed symphony playing in a silver-fretted chamber.
“That’s what I thought,” Hermione said scornfully, and it was the first time in years that Harry wanted to wipe the know-it-all look off her face. “He’s using you. He’s trying to turn you to his cause.”
“’Course I did. Couldn’t miss the chance of you getting beaten, could I?” Ginny grins, nudging him in the shoulder.
“Are you ready to get weird, get loud, and lose? Your? Heads?”
“Don’t be modest,” Harry told him. “You rarely are. What’s gotten into you?”
“Mhm. You were saying?”
Slughorn had begun his customary rounds of the classroom, peering into cauldrons to see if the concoctions were fit to be tested. He gave Hermione and Ron an approving nod, Henrietta’s solitarily brewed potion an appreciative sniff, and the rest of the cauldrons a combination of raised eyebrows or outright grimacing. As he peered into Draco’s and Harry’s cauldron, a smile spread across Professor Slughorn’s lined face.
“I don’t suppose,” Ron began slowly, “You’d like to stay with my family? I assume Harry and Hermione are coming as usual, and Ginny invited Luna for Christmas dinner. So I figured - I mean, Hermione and I figured - that you might as well come, too. Anyway, I don’t think Mum will mind adopting another kid for a bit. The more, the merrier, you know.”
“It’s faded.” Faraday glanced at Harry, then back to the Mark. “What have you been doing for it?”
Over the next week, Harry did his best to harmonize Draco with the Golden Trio, with mixed results. Hermione, with her forgiving nature, managed at least to be semi-friendly to Draco, and they had bonded on more than one occasion over their love of academic writing. Ron, however, interacted with the Slytherin as little as possible; Harry appreciated his best friend doing away with the insulting comments, but he felt things weren’t moving fast enough. He told Ron as much, while the Trio studied together by the fire one night.
And before Draco could stop her, Narcissa slid out of bed, white-stockinged feet landing on the wooden floor. Her arms shook with the effort of lifting her body. Hyacinthe rushed forward, his duty as a Healer overriding his suspicion of the Malfoy family.
“Joey? Joey, what’s going on?”
He repeated the mantra, but hot tears welled in his eyes. “She was - she was on the ground, and I refused, and he - I don’t know - he
Luna smiled, holding the stack of
took care of. But You-Know-Who brought her himself into the house. He said he was disappointed in me for not killing Dumbledore, so he wanted to give me a second chance with this girl they found.”
Malfoy tucks a lock of hair behind his ear. Harry starts a little at his nails, which he’d expect to be polished and manicured, like any rich girl’s. Instead, they’re clipped short, and a bandage is wrapped around one knuckle.
. The wand movement doesn’t matter too much, but I find flicking works the best. Say it without wands first.”
Suddenly, Harry’s expression changed, eyes widening, and he nodded. “Transgender,” he echoed, “I remember now. Hermione mentioned that in her essay.”
“You ought to come as well, Draco,” Luna said thoughtfully as the fivesome arrived at the castle’s interior.
“Well, don’t keep us in suspense,” Ron urged, putting his hands beneath his chin in a caricature of an eager student. “Give us a good story.”
Draco, startled, let Harry take his hand for a moment. Then he pulled away. “Not everyone can be as careless as you.”
“So, what made you run off yesterday?” Harry said.
“The Ministry can’t prove any of it,” Joey said darkly. “My record is spotless, remember? You did that.”
“I wonder who attacked you,” Harry said, blatantly changing the subject. Draco let him. “They came just to hurt you, it seemed like. I don’t suppose you have any ideas?”
!” Potter cries desperately, but the jet of water from his wand evaporates immediately in the heated air.
"What's so funny, Malfoy?" Harry was beginning to get irritated, and he had to work to keep his voice low.
“Yes, ma’am,” Ron replied, reaching for his knapsack. “Coming, Harry?”
As Hermione had predicted, there was, in fact, pudding at the castle. Though the Battle of Hogwarts had left the first-year class smaller, the Slytherin tables emptier, and the conversation quieter, it didn’t stop the house elves from outdoing themselves for the start of the year feast. Harry heaped his plate with treacle tart, the familiar taste bringing bittersweet tears to his eyes that he quickly wiped away.
“Well…” Harry broke off into incoherent mumblings, ending with, “Yes.”
“That sounds really cool,” Ginny said enthusiastically. “A toast, then,” She added, raising her bottle of butterbeer, “To the future and to flower gardens. To 1999.”
He emerged from the musty, stale air of the library to the cold halls of the castle, footsteps echoing on the flagstones. Most students were either studying or outside enjoying the few sunny days that January provided, so the corridors stood empty. Harry decided to stretch his legs for a few minutes before heading back.
“I still want to talk to McGonagall,” Draco said, nonetheless unsettled, “About my parents. We should go before school tomorrow morning before classes start.”
Yes, Harry had seen it. The way Padma had wanted to get away from Gavin as fast as possible, muscles tensing like prey ready to bolt. Hand raising defensively as if anticipating a blow. What had Padma cried when Gavin tried to apologize?
"Oh, please. Granger's spells are better than Weasley's by a long shot."
“I have to hang up now,” Padma interrupts. “Be there in ten.”
“Quiet, Bellatrix.” Snape inclines his head. “Think of it as a test, Draco. Complete it, and you will earn your place.”
During the last class of the day, Harry opened his textbook as McGonagall lectured about Featuristic Transfiguration. As he flipped through the pages, a loose bit of parchment sticking out from behind the front cover caught his notice. Harry placed the scrap onto his notes, immediately recognizing the cramped cursive:
The final gong reverberated through the cold depths of the dungeon as Harry skidded to a halt in front of the classroom’s entrance. He quickly twisted the handle and slipped inside, panting. Thankfully, the rest of the class was still chattering as they lay textbooks next to their cauldrons, and Harry’s rushed appearance went mostly unnoticed. Even Hermione, whom Harry knew would otherwise throw him a scolding look for tardiness, talked animatedly with Ron and paid him no notice. Professor Slughorn had his back turned, rifling through his notes in preparation to write on the board.
He and Harry exchanged another one of their meaningful glances, and Joey realized what had to be done. As much as she wanted to be in the thick of it, battling enemies all the way to the exit with a dragon in hand…She couldn’t separate them. Not if their teamwork in combat was as good as their chemistry - and Joey had heard from multiple classmates that the pair excelled in both fields.
When Harry kicked off into the air for the second time, all his worries flew away in a gust of wind. He scoffed at himself for getting so nervous for tryouts, though he could’ve been worried about seeing Ginny again.
He realized that he’d thought of youth as an entirely different age group to himself.
Her voice, soft, continues, “You’re safe here. We’re both safe. Keep breathing, Draco.”
In a flash, Draco let go of Harry’s hand and lurched forward towards the wizards. Hoping to Merlin he wasn’t wrong, he grabbed the wrist of the wizard, who grunted in surprise. Draco yanked him towards the mask, and as soon as his bare fingers brushed it, he disappeared in a flash of blue light.
“I dunno, it’s hard to explain.” Draco felt lightheaded, but much better than just a few moments before. He focused on the sound of the burbling fountain, the feel of Harry’s hand on his wrist.
A jet of red light streaked through the air like an arrow. Harry slashed his wand through the air to block it, but only a faint shimmer of a shield appeared for a brief moment before the curse hit him square in the chest.
Writing this fanfiction, during such a turmoil-filled year, has been an intense emotional journey. I began in November of 2019, before COVID-19, before J.K. Rowling’s transphobia controversy, before the issue of police brutality took center stage in my country, before same-sex marriage and abortion rights were threatened by the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Since the beginning of this fic, I have undergone great change as a writer and person, just as the world has.
“Awry,” Joey echoed darkly.
“Not shit odds when it comes to you, Harry. I’m counting on you.” Ron gives him one last thump on the back before disappearing back up the bleachers.
“Kiss me again instead?” Harry suggests.
Good evening, my dears. Don’t raise your wands. Are you enemies?]
“Something’s definitely ‘up,’ but it’s hard to get a straight answer out of him,” Pansy replies. “I don’t know how long I’ll be gone for.”
“So, they’re increasing the guards,” Draco guessed.
“It’s pretty messy in here,” Harry says apologetically.
“The Weasleys are kind people, they’ll warm up to you soon enough,” Harry said reassuringly. “I promise.”
Narcissa tilted her chin. “Perhaps not.” She lowered her voice so Hyacinthe would not hear. “You’ve done well with my letter. I did not expect the Ministry to help you. How did you persuade them?”
He avoided glancing in Joanne’s direction as he passed her table. She wasn’t scary, really, he told himself.
A stone circle with a diameter comparable to a car’s length was sunken a quarter ways into the ground. Harry had seen the portal many times, but he’d never seen it active. The space within the circle had taken on a shimmering, almost vaporlike quality, sparkling blue despite the weak sunlight. A maroon-uniformed wizard stood by it, wand gripped firmly by his side.
“Take a look at our division name.” Harry might have found this condescending from anyone else, but Joey’s voice was so even that he didn’t feel spoken down to. “We’re dealing with criminals. They don’t respect the rules that we, as government workers, are bound to. And some lack morality. We’re already at a disadvantage. Secondly, international. Ever been out of the country, Harry?”
“Did I know him?” Harry echoed. He remembered seven years ago, unsure of himself in the vastness of King’s Cross, holding a nonsensical ticket and laden with possessions he hardly knew how to use. He’d heard Molly Weasley’s voice first, cutting through the faceless crowd like a lighthouse beam of comfort, and seen the rest of the family, dressed in threadbare robes and holding beaten trunks. All six relatives seemed happy and carefree around each other, none of the children ever ducking for a scolding blow like Harry had at the Dursley’s. They glowed with warmth and familiarity, Fred among them, teasing his siblings and his mother, reassuring his sister along with George. Unexpected tears pricked Harry’s eyes as he realized, not for the first time, that the happy little unit would never again be whole. “Yes. He was a good friend of mine.”
Before Harry could check on his teammates, iciness suddenly washed over him, as if he’d been dunked in the wintry Black Lake. Tears pricked his eyes. It didn’t matter that he’d downed two opponents - more enemies were to come. They would always come, in crippling numbers, and there was nothing he could do about it. Fred, his parents, Dumbledore, Moody…Their sacrifices had all been in vain.
“You haven’t drunk any water?” Harry yelped as they reached the top of the staircase. “You’ve got your wand, right?”
Harry swallowed. “Yes.”
doing here?” Gavin asked, his icy blue eyes narrowing at Draco.
“I’m done,” Harry sighed three hours later. In front of him, covered in scrawls and multiple crossing-outs, a long piece of parchment held his completed outline and introduction paragraphs.
Harry laughed along with Ron until he saw a dark shape flit by the window. Draco, already in his black Hogwarts uniform, strode purposefully by.
Hermione gave them both a panicked look, but it was too late to change anything. Three masked strangers, clothed in crimson, peered into the compartment. The one in front, whose face was hidden with the visage of a serpent, slid open the door slowly.
“You sure, treasure?”
“I’ve done a lot of reading on Voldemort,” Hermione did not linger on the wicked name, “And the intricacies of his followers. There were only a few pages on the Dark Mark. Not much is known about how it’s given, and I didn’t even know it could be taken away until I came across a few certain lines. Apparently, it’s a relatively easy incantation, but it requires a deep emotional connection between the bearer and the remover of the Mark.” She raised her eyebrows questioningly. “What have you and Malfoy been doing to make yourselves deeply emotionally connected?”
Theodore took another drag, eyebrows furrowing through the ensuing plume of smoke. “Mother of Merlin.”
Harry traces his pale collarbone, listening to his still-shaky breath. “They should.”
Charlie smirked, picking up on Hermione's favoritism. "Word on the Weasley street is that you're Ronnie's girlfriend," He said.
“J.M. Barrie. One of my favorites I found in my
“Oh, more suspicious then yanking me into a closed space?”
“And you were wrong.”
one for long, elegant speeches,” Draco begins. “But when…when I look at you now, I can’t…” He sighs heavily in frustration, then steps closer. “I can’t find the words.” His pale cheeks have already turned red in the chill. Harry can count the snowflakes clinging to his eyelashes.
“You’re
Harry shouted internally.
Harry turned away from her after she spoke, watching Draco intently. The Slytherin’s jaw was already working - from anger? Harry wondered. Or was he imagining things?
Ginny huffed but immediately scooped up a handful of snow, packed it, and tossed it at him. Her aim was dead-on, but George dodged the snowball, and it hit Hermione instead.
“I don’t know,” Draco said to no one and looked at himself in the mirror. Mussed hair, shadowed eyes, forehead lined with all the emotions swirling inside him for the past couple of weeks. Shame for wishing his father dead. Guilt for leaving Harry behind. Anxiety for coming to terms with being stuck in a job poisoning him from the inside out. Just like the Dark Mark.
“I’ve told you,” Draco said, slightly irritable as he dropped his bag on the opposite couch, “You can call me Draco.”
Just then, the door flew open, revealing Professor Dahlia, whose short black hair was dripping wet. Beneath her black robes, the jeans and T-shirt she was wearing seemed to be damp as well, but she strode to the front of the classroom as if nothing was out of the ordinary.
“We’re not leaving without you,” Harry told her, and when she opened her mouth, added, “Please don’t argue with me.”
“Oh, er…that’s alright,” Ron said awkwardly - even after a couple months of being tentative friends, he and Draco hadn’t gotten comfortable with one another yet.
He’s curled in the blankets, in the snow. In the stars and sky.
“You’re supposed to make up your
Joey clenched her jaw. “No, Auntie. This is my choice alone.” She closed the door without looking back.
“The Sphere of Knowledge imbibes all the experiences I’ve had with the members of my division,” Belton explained, grasping the orb in his bare hand, “Including knowledge I may have forgotten about over these past three years. It will make an informed decision based on this, and choose Aurors three at a time to assign them…” He suddenly broke off and closed his eyes, and when he spoke again, the voice was no longer deep and calm, but high and raspy.
“That’s interestin’,” Hagrid murmured, seemingly to himself. “That’s real interestin’. Not ‘xactly what I expected, but not surprising, considerin’ all…” He trailed off.
“Quidditch tryouts,” Harry said, tossing the apple into the air once and catching it.
There’s no protest when they reach the bar, one of Draco’s favorite places in Ashfell since he moved. The din that accompanied the stroke of midnight has barely lessened, nor the crowd - Harry pushes through a throng of cheering, chattering people just for a couple of feet at the bar. A faint cloud of cigarette smoke hangs over the mussed revelers, made visible by the Christmas lights still strung near the ceiling.
One page of the journal is dedicated to this night.
“What an interesting approach.”
Henrietta didn’t argue, running to Anaya and helping her up. Draco allowed the two girls to flee, but the second they left, he raised his wand again. “You should have minded your own business, Parkinson.”
The stars dominated the sky that night, the moon only a sliver as it hung above the ocean, its reflection twin wavering in the waves. The drizzle from that morning had faded in the late afternoon, the clouds now far behind them. Harry had the feeling that it wouldn’t be the worst weather they’d encounter on the voyage. There was still plenty of distance to cover, and he didn’t trust his luck one bit.
“Someone check on him,” Professor Dahlia commanded, but Harry was already running.
you’ve got it?”
As fate would have it, it was Henrietta Carrow they met at the doorway. She stood at the edge of a bunch of students waiting to be seated. A few curls escaped from her ponytail, framing a serious expression that brightened when she spotted Draco.
“Caramel?”
“Nothing to be worried about yet.” As Draco set his mug down, Harry leaned in and kissed him. He tasted of wedding cake and champagne, Draco observed, and that combined with the faint pine-scented cologne was rather intoxicating. He had to stop himself from tearing off Harry’s clothes, and instead pulled back, catching his breath.
His eyes met Harry’s, and they were full of tears. “I’m only going to drag you down, Potter. You know that; I know that. I appreciate you being there for me, and I believe you when you say you love me. I’ve been thinking…I still can’t forgive myself - for what I did to you, to Ron, to Hermione. I know it seems like I’m over it. But what if, secretly, nothing’s really fine?” He lifted his hands, looking at them, remembering them caked with blood and dirt and shame. “What if all the people I’ve hurt stay that way forever? Because of what I did?
“Draco,” Harry said warningly.
“Of course. Hey,” Harry kissed him on the cheek. “I’m proud of you for coming in here. We’ll get it all fixed up, make it feel like home again.”
“Twenty years is a lot to work through,” Dr. Patil says, nodding. “I’m sure you’ll think of something.”
The wizard operating the portal shouted the name of their destination, and Harry felt himself dissolve.
Also, this is probably a good time to mention that there will be more mentions of sex and non-graphic sexual activity going forward. Nothing that will warrant an Explicit rating, but I just wanted to make y'all aware.
“Yes, but…” Henderson frowned at Joey, tapping his chin. “Aura blocking is not something the Healers in London will have any experience with. Nor the Healers here, even. I’m assuming you want it fixed?”
“Then I will take my leave.” Connors waved her wand, and the protective bubble dissolved. The rain came hard and fast, drops pattering down upon their shoulders. The ground would be turning to mud out there, Draco realized, and he wished for an Anti-Slip Charm to cast on his shoes, but no such thing existed. He heard Harry mutter the spell he used to make his glasses water-repellent. “Good luck, Aurors.” Connors turned with a sweep of gray robes and ran into the clearing to aid her fellow wizards.
Harry still knew almost nothing about her, which bothered him because he was usually good at reading people. She did invite him for a drink, which seemed friendly, but didn’t offer to pay for him, which wasn’t unusual, he supposed, but she wasn’t even looking at him now. What was this lady’s deal?
To the bitter end.
I haven't really asked for feedback thus far, especially since there are so few readers, but I'm glad some of y'all seem to be following along! What do you think of the story? The drama? The characters? Let me know in the comments :)
“I’m not going anywhere with you. How stupid do you think I am?”
Percy’s nostrils flared. “I do wish you had sent me an owl too, Mother,” He said bitterly, and sat down hard in his chair.
•  •  •
But where the circumstances might have gone next, neither Draco nor Harry found out, for there came a great burst of sound from downstairs. A whoop of laughter from Ron and the chatter of three others announced the return of the rest of Harry’s friends. The tipsy, reckless moment passed as soon as it had come. Draco sat up immediately, worry and guilt knitted into his face.
The image of a child strangling a man, no matter how despicable he might have been, was burned into Joey’s mind. She couldn’t help but be reminded of herself. She replayed the sight of Draco’s and Harry’s figures huddled around a corpse in the rain. It was as if Dahlia had reached out from death, showing Joey the decisions she’d made and where it had led her.
“I’ll give you all back,” Luna whispers, adjusting her mirrors. “Every last one.”
Hermione, who was ten questions ahead, leaned over and sighed. “Well, it’s not badger fur, darling. Skip it and come back to it later.”
“Take a look at this,” Hermione said suddenly. The other three paused their conversations and peered over obligingly. “It’s the flag Professor Dahlia has in front of her desk, next to the one for Thunderbird.”
"N-no, thank you," Harry stuttered, taking a step back. "Er…Professor? How long until the potion wears off?"
His friend leaned towards him and gathered him in her arms. Harry gratefully returned the embrace, pulling away after a minute. “You’ll be okay,” Luna promised, and Harry started to believe it.
High school, soccer field, autumn dew. Long legs and lip gloss and a voice that commanded attention. Later there was anger, frustration, any slivers of friendship snatched away in lieu of an inner struggle that Harry learned about years after.
Harry looked from the spots of wreckage and glanced at Draco, vaguely wondering if he had been one of the Death Eaters that destroyed parts of Diagon Alley during the War. As if sensing Harry’s thoughts, Draco’s brow furrowed, and he didn’t speak for the whole walk, keeping his head resolutely forward.
“What d’you mean? You’ve snogged Cho, haven’t you? And you must have done…things…with,” Ron shuddered, “My sister.”
“Being your…friend has made me realize I want to start being more honest.” Only then did Draco look up, his silver eyes piercing Harry’s even from several feet away. “And I’ve tried to suppress this feeling I’ve had for years, but I’m done hiding from myself. It’s taken me a long time to realize that I like boys the way everyone expects me to like girls.”

Forgotten by the other three, Draco and Goyle slump against the wall, still gulping lungfuls of smoke-free air. Potter, Weasley, and Granger talk in hurried, frantic voices, then run off as the Hogwarts castle explodes in chaos.
A hand landed on his shoulder, and the touch was so familiar that Harry turned around immediately.
A moment of sticky silence fell over the room. Next to Harry, he could hear Draco’s breath coming in anxious, shallow spurts.
As they passed through the doors, Draco suddenly looked back again at the landscape. A syrupy twilight began to fall over the forest-green mountains, the last of the day’s gold sunlight finally breaking through the clouds and pooling where shadows did not yet deign to fall. The Slytherin’s brow furrowed, and his lips moved slightly as if to speak.
“We can escape from the erasing,” Harry realizes. Draco opens his eyes, and they glimmer with satisfaction. “You’re brilliant, absolutely brilliant,” Harry proclaims, covering Draco with kisses, one for each word.
“I think I’ll sit this one out,” Harry sighed, putting down his cards as Joey gathered the deck. “You two are leagues ahead of me.”
“Me neither.” Harry’s words are robotic, following a script. He needs to get through this memory as fast as possible. Draco’s lips look terribly, terribly soft, and if Harry’s not careful, he’ll miss him even more. “Ever thought about having kids?”
Then Draco saw someone very strange. One of the students, wearing the yellow-edged robes of a Hufflepuff, strolled in front of them. The student had platinum-blond hair, pale, sharp features, and piercing blue eyes. They stopped as they reached Harry, looked down the length of their nose, and said, in a scathingly London accent, “Scared, Potter?”
“I’m working up to it.” Latifah’s wand accidentally shot out yellow sparks, and she yelped, sliding it back into her holster. “Sorry. She said you’re being sent away.”
“You don’t know everything, Joey,” Latifah said kindly - she said everything kindly. “Besides, Caroline pulled some strings. The school board knows enough about your talents to let you do the final semester. Six months; that’s all.”
Harry settled back down and raised his voice over the noise, saying something in Khmer. Draco shook his head at him, and Harry pursed his lips. He wiped stray dirt off his lenses with his sleeves and waited a few moments before trying again.
“You don't know them. A poor orphan I plucked from the streets. They needed guidance, so I took them in.” Dao raised and lowered one shoulder. “Small prices to pay for a servant. They’re a slippery little rabbit.”
Harry was beginning to think that it might rain, gazing up at the clouds, when he ran right into someone. “Sorry, I didn’t see you.”
“I’m glad to see such enthusiastic players and a great number at that. Of course, that means it’ll be harder than ever to pick our team. If you’re willing to work hard and put in the hours…”
from this morning. Thought you might be interested.” He handed it to Draco, his other hand dipping back into his pocket.
Harry’s thoughts were going a mile a minute, but he managed to take the magazine. “Uh, sure. Thanks, Luna.”
“Potter and I are friends,” He replied smoothly, and Gavin’s eyebrows raised in surprise.
Snowflakes drift on currents of moonlight and beams from a nearby streetlamp. Justin’s shoulders rise and fall with his breath, which puffs into white vapor.
Draco grimaced. “Get stuffed, Parkinson!” Harry shouted. “Draco can be with whoever he likes.”
A series of beeps, high-pitched and digital, sound through the field.
“I don’t understand the point of this exercise,” Draco sighs dramatically; even at eight years old, his personality overflows with his father’s petulance and his mother’s wit. His speech, clipped and enunciated, impresses most adults - until they get to know him better.
“Lovely morning, isn’t it?” Ron greeted all of them loudly. His broad grin didn’t fade even when he noticed Theodore. “What a surprise! Nott, is it?”
“It was only for an instant. Red cloth, someone’s robes, I guess. It wasn’t exactly the shade of the Gryffindor colors, though. More like a deep ruby.”
“Don’t be thick, Ron, you’re gorgeous too,” Harry teased, causing his best friend to throw a pillow at him.
“Yes, but he’s undercover. At some point, we’ll be on our own,” Joey said gravely.
“I’m not tired!” Teddy insisted, hair darkening to an angry scarlet.
“You do no stumbling,” Joey said roughly in Igbo, then switched back. “Speak in what you like. I’m here to discuss a coll- um, friend of mine.”
“It’s run by the government,” Harry said bluntly, and his partners were satisfied with this explanation.
And then they stopped, and Draco had realized what he had done.
“You seriously need to take a shower before you go anywhere,” Draco said critically, though he didn’t move away. “Don’t wash your hair, though.”
“Sending a letter?” Harry asked as he knelt by his trunk, rummaging for a clean uniform.
Red, pink, and white pulses in the windows of every public building in Ashfell. Shiny hearts, sparkly streamers, and paper Cupids decorate the restaurants, hair salons, even the goddamn 7/11. Harry switches from watching the road to glaring at the street more often than he ought to, and he notices that one of the passerby’s hair is not colored by a blinking neon heart as he initially thought. He stops, halfway parked by the sidewalk, and rolls down the passenger window.
Keep no secrets.
In which Harry finds no reassurance on solid ground.
Draco thought triumphantly.

“It’s seven, Hermione,” Harry started, but she shut him up with a look.
a small voice in Harry’s head scolded.
“You can tell me.”
A tentative knock sounded at the door. Ray slid the poison-filled container into another drawer and called, “Come in.”
“Can’t you be a bit nicer to my friends, Malfoy?” Harry said sternly as the blond sped up his pace, so they walked in tandem.
“Merlin, no. Tabs and I don’t run with that crowd anymore, do we?” He replied, squeezing her shoulder. “I’m a businessman, simple as that. Don’t be so suspicious, Malfoy.”
“Does he ever trust anyone outside his inner circle?”
“Ah.” Ray nodded understandingly. “We don't use wands to direct our magic here.” From his neck, he lifted a thin, gold chain hung with a clear, sparkling gem, set in a base of carefully carved wood. In the very center of the stone, Draco spotted a flame of red - a fiber of phoenix feather, he guessed. “Amulets are more powerful. Less precise and predictable than wands, but we prefer them.”
“Erase them?” Harry echoes. “They’re just…gone? Poof?”
There was a touch of real regret in his tone, and Harry squeezed his hand comfortingly. “We’ll have our own in time. Remember when I gave you that apple, and you ate it in, I dunno, five seconds?”
“All right, all right, I’m going. ‘Night, Malfoy.” Grinning, Harry shut the door behind him and made a beeline for his and Ron’s shared bedroom just as he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
“Nah, they alternate getting caught and do it in intervals,” Ron replies, plucking a jazzie from her palm, and pops it into his mouth.
Ron sighed, leaning so far forward that his forehead rested on the desk. “This is an awful lot of writing for one day,” He remarked, voice muffled. “I’ll finish it later.”
After he finished, Harry collapsed, shocked, onto Draco’s trunk. The Slytherin raised his eyebrow at this but allowed his friend a moment to process.
a man and a woman,” Draco said, anger inching into his voice. “They always intended for me to marry a rich, pretty, pureblood girl. Homosexuality, in my father’s eyes, was an unnatural abomination. He forced that idea into my head from a very young age. I hated myself, Potter,” Draco’s voice broke, but he quickly cleared his throat and pressed on. “Sometimes, I still do. And when my father found out that I was gay…”
Draco pursed his lips. “Sorry I brought it up.”
Harry raised his eyebrows at the possible implications of the statement, and Draco slipped his hand surreptitiously from Harry’s grasp. “I’m fine, Professor,” Draco said. “It just hurt a lot…”
“Healer!” Harry shouted desperately. “We need potions, something, please!” But the Aurors were dealing with prisoners and injuries of their own. A broad figure with waves of dark hair - their commander, Draco was sure - looked in their direction and stood.
“No,” The Fat Lady said shortly and closed the passageway herself.
“Who’s grabbing who now?” Harry teased, and before Draco could stay something about this not being the time, he yelled, “Dragon!”
Draco’s eyes, red-rimmed and exhausted, seemed to plead for help. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it. Instead, a sigh of relief escaped his lips as he fell forward into Harry’s arms.
Leather gloves deep in his robe pocket, a necklace resting against his chest, both the color of night, and a carelessly-draped scarf adorned Harry as he met Draco in the dungeon hallway. The older boy was dressed impeccably in charcoal-grey robes, opened over a - shockingly - Muggle outfit of a midnight blue turtleneck and pressed black trousers. Harry nearly felt inadequate in his tieless uniform until Draco took his hand without a single cutting remark.
“You can’t,” Dahlia croaked.
“Could be an Animagus,” Harry murmured warningly, but the cat seemed utterly disinterested in the three wizards and disappeared from sight.
Instead of answering, Draco leaned down and kissed him. Harry could taste the fear and desperation on his lips, and he pulled him closer, taking his pain away and making it his own. Draco pulled away a bare centimeter, mouth brushing Harry’s as he murmured, “This would make a good memory.” Harry opened his eyes to see Draco, unsmiling, but with something like hope, or yearning, in his gaze.
Draco yelled, swiping his wand viciously, and a crackling jet of blue light shot towards Pansy. She deflected it at the last second, the Shield Charm absorbing the spell with a sound like thunder. Harry stepped forward to help, but Draco threw out an arm, holding him back.
As if reigning himself in, Draco suddenly pulled back and gasped soundlessly. “It’s getting late,” He said monotonously. “I don’t know about you, but I’m getting pretty tired.”
•  •  •
“Oh, I wish I could’ve seen the look on your face,” Ginny giggled from behind, and she moved to sit beside him. “How come you’re not dancing?"
Draco snickered, then turned his head to cough. “Astutely observed.”
Draco sighed, trying to fight back the smile that played across his lips. “If you insist.”
“Oh…” Harry readily accepted the hug, his head naturally nestling in the crook of Draco’s neck. “Erm…I didn’t do much. But you’re welcome.”
Dr. Padma Patil, expression serious as ever, leads Harry to a round table away from her desk, where she’s set up a notepad and a voice recorder. “Please, have a seat,” She says, and Harry sits across from her, leaving the garbage bags on the floor. “I need you to tell me all you can about Draco Malfoy,” She instructs, and even the brief mention of his name sends poisoned spikes afresh through Harry’s chest. Dr. Patil slides over a manila-colored card, where a phrase has been typed out. “Please recite this with the blanks filled in when I hit record. Then, I’ll ask you some prompting questions. Answer them as fully as you can.”
“Is that why you turned invisible and snuck down here? To criticize my hair?”
“I don’t know about
“Your mother would have accepted my decision. Being stubborn, seeking your own version of justice, even compromising safety of others. That is a choice your father would have made.”
Harry seemed to pick up on Draco’s discomfort, because he said, “Sorry. You-Know-Who. So…was that who you heard?”
“In one way or another,” Draco admitted.
“Or break in from the inside,” she said.
“If this is your idea of a protection charm,” Dao said, apparently unmoved, “I’m not impressed. Just because I use Dark magic on occasion doesn’t mean I want to wear it around my neck.”
“I’m fine,” Narcissa said airily, and with a muffled grunt, she stood up, swayed slightly on the spot, and walked over to the curtain. Draco followed hurriedly, ready to catch his weakened mother if she stumbled.
“And who are you to lecture me, Death Eater?” Dao hissed, but Draco didn’t flinch, Harry noted with satisfaction. He only wearily bowed his head, body trembling in pain.
“Erm…” There’s something off in his gaze. Draco’s hands clench as they fall to the bed. He glances away, thinking. “The Charles River is frozen this time of year.”
The wind changed, whistling with a sudden chill. Carraway drew close to a nearby building, its pastel walls bone-pale in the semidarkness. Streetlamp light sparkled off the water in a silent fountain, standing on its lonesome in the center of a courtyard.
"She knows what you mean," Hermione reassured him, but even she looked unconvinced. "Harry, why don't you…" She tilted her head towards the direction of the stairs.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Not really.”
“Nope.” Harry sat up, stretching languidly. “We’ve got to start planning while the information’s fresh.”
A couple Gryffindors gave Seamus frustrated looks, but most of the class sighed with relief that they hadn’t all been killed.
Luna waved her flags, red and blue each, with gusto. “Both teams! Whichever way the game goes, I’ll be happy.”
“Do you mind helping me out today?” She said, keeping a close eye on the players as they lined up to score against the first potential keeper. “The few people who were going to try out for Seeker decided not to once they saw you sign up.”
Balmy wind carried the salty trail of the sea as Harry, Joey, and Bennyson Carraway stood on an unpaved road a little ways from the ocean shore. They’d arrived in a tiny village minutes away from Nice, dressed in undercover Muggle clothes. Harry patted his upper arm, feeling for the wand holster hidden by long sleeves.
“Please, have a seat.” Potter nodded to one of the two chairs in front of his desk.
“Anyway,” said Draco, placing the bones back inside the hollow, “I’ll show you everything else later. For now,” he brushed off his hands on his trousers, “Flowers.”
“Harry, the castle is safest-” Hermione began, reaching for him, but Harry brushed her off.
“It’s a different kind of strength,” Harry replied. “It takes just as much to step up as it does to step down.”
The two young men watched each other warily, making steely eye contact.
“Oh. I meant, why push down your true feelings? Why lie to yourself?”
Draco’s lips, slightly chapped, tasted like smoke. The kiss was sweet but brief, and as soon as they broke apart, Harry wanted more. But then a question popped into his head, and it spilled out of his mouth in a rushed, tangled hurry.
Harry gave a start when he recognized the plant. “Is that…?”
One of the longest chapters yet, though it encompasses little more than a day. The content explores Harry's and Draco's relationship deeper than ever but doesn't hesitate to focus a bit on the Golden Trio's friendship as well. I like to think of "Swing" as a turning point for the main plotline - after this, changes will start to progress more rapidly than before.
“A story?” Harry repeated, perplexed. “About what?”
“Excellent work, as usual,” He commended. Draco smiled smugly as Pansy threw both he and Harry a dirty look from across the dungeon.
“You know, Draco,” Harry said amiably, glancing from the textbook to their cauldron, “I think we replicated it perfectly.”
“A targeted, purely magical explosion,” Draco murmured to himself. “It’s never been done before, and barely attempted. If this works, it’ll make history.”
“Draco.” The sound of his name on that gravelly, disapproving voice made Draco shudder. Lucius’s face was shadowed with stubble, long hair lank and stringy, lip already curling at the sight of his only offspring. “I hear you’re training to be an Auror.”
“You’re allowed to say ‘gay,’” Draco told him, rolling his eyes. “And it never came up.
“They’re not stupid,” He murmured, silver gaze swishing back and forth like a predator’s. “We shouldn’t be together so often. I mean…” He bit his lip. “I know I said I’m ready, but this is too much, too fast.”
“I couldn’t agree more.” Harry stood, bringing Draco with him.
A small, logical voice within Harry reminded him that she’d never meant to hurt him all along. Harry took a deep breath of the salty air. He’d traveled this far; they’d fix Joey’s aura problem and be back home in no time.
“Kids die in battle zones,” Joey growled. “Weren’t we just talking about collateral damage? Their lives are worth something. It doesn’t matter if they might grow up like their parents. You must realize that.”
“You can come in now,” The Fat Lady huffed.
“But of course, the most important thing is to have fun and try not to break any bones,” Ginny said with a broad, Fred-like grin. “Break up into your groups and let’s get started!”
Finally, Harry repeated, “He didn’t tell me any of this. I want to know that he’s okay. Where can I find him?”
“If you would.” Draco stared pointedly at his boyfriend.
Joey let her eyes adjust to the flickering brightness of the corridor, stretching in seeming endlessness before her. The sconces filled with scarlet flames; the slate gray stone walls, and dark, polished wooden floors created an intimidating aura - precisely what the Ministry intended with a remodel, Joey heard, after being broken into a few years back.
“Over where? Oh.” In the direction Draco pointed, a vast, high-ceilinged room swelled into existence. The floor and walls were made of stone, like the rest of the castle, but steel ribbed the ceiling to offer extra support.
On Wednesday, marble-sized bits of ice pounded the castle’s windows; the sharp noise caused many teachers to cast Muffling Spells in their classrooms. The strangely inclement weather kept everyone fixedly indoors, and if the students did have to venture outside briefly, they used their heavy textbooks to shield their heads from the pelting hail.
"Well, probably." Hermione's expression changed to doubt, but it passed quickly. "Just because Voldemort is dead doesn't mean his supporters are!"
“George!”
can do?”
Ron scoffed. "Nah, are you kidding? I'm sure he worships the Chosen One even more now." He playfully punched Harry in the arm, and the brunet laughed and shook him off. Secretly, Harry was immensely relieved that Hermione and Ron hadn't been entirely put-off by Draco's gift. Although that probably had a lot to do with the fact that Harry left out the part about their midnight rendezvous and simply told his friends that Draco had given the necklace to him before bed.
Joey sat down on the edge of her bed and reread the letter. Then she read it a third time. She thought of Draco and Harry - her friends - and their astonished and happy faces when they opened their envelope.
“It’s too late for me.”
“Merlin, no. Children of said murderers. I was talking to a few people; apparently, they all stay in the homes ’round this courtyard.” Harry took a deep breath, looking up at the windows. Joey followed his gaze; light shone from a few, though she didn’t see anyone.
Joey glanced over and flushed in embarrassment. “Ah. Thanks.”
“I think it’s realistic,” Hermione said reasonably. “We’ve been through a lot; there’s no use in denying it. But in the end, we have each other. We do our best with what we’ve been left with.” She looked up at the candles floating above their heads. “‘Ash spun to silk.’”
“All’s fair in love and war,” said Draco, and again, Harry ignored the interruption.
, mate. Years and years of ‘Malfoy’s a slimy git’, ‘Malfoy’s an entitled arse,’ Malfoy this, Malfoy that. That kind of stuff doesn’t just go away.”
“Mm.” Luna gives Pansy a reluctant half-smile as she drapes her coat over the arm of the pullout couch. “Gosh, my hands are freezing. I need some hot water.”
Nothing happened for a long while. The Aurors finished the box of chocolate twists on a bench outside of the convenience store, watching as its sole employee left and drew rickety metal shutters over the windows. A few kids kicked a worn ball down the dusty street but were soon pulled into their respective houses by chiding mothers. Soon, the village had emptied completely, the only light emitting from the moon’s bleary, half-closed eye.
Draco opened one eye to give him a critical look. “You’re calling
“Enough. Twenty wizards against their fifty, but most don’t have wands. Ye should be fine. Lotsa cover in battle and they’re not expecting ye. That’s not ta say there’s no guards,” Charon warned. “Expect trouble.”
Wind rushed in Draco’s ears, but he heard the flare as it went off, a high-pitched whistle, accompanied by a cloud of yellow, glowing smoke that smelled of burning pine. A moment later, he began to notice the signs of conflict: crackling spells, screams, and the smell of singed human.
“Thanks,” Harry muttered, feeling the edges with his fingers before throwing them across the lake. Ron mimicked him, skipping stones, so they bounced four or five times on the surface. As they threw, Ron began to discuss Quidditch, asking his best friend about Gryffindor’s upcoming match with Hufflepuff the next week. Harry tossed out what he hoped were satisfactory answers, but in truth, he barely followed the conversation. He focused more on his own thoughts and the path of his stones. Each bounce elicited a slight splashing sound, and Harry found the rhythm strangely soothing as if he was listening to the clipped cadence of Draco’s speech.
Harry inhaled sharply. “He told you…?” He seemed perplexed, lost for words.
Draco shouted something unintelligible, running towards him.
“What’s the matter with your arm?” Harry asked, genuinely concerned. Though he’d never admit it, not even to his friends, he did care a small bit about Malfoy. After all, he’d been a school rival for six years now; surely that meant something. And Harry felt troubled at the prospect of haughty Malfoy being so unhappy that he’d hurt himself.
As Joey drank the rest of her soup - the taste wasn’t something she could describe, but sweet Jesus, it was good - a noise came at the window. Something brown, a little smaller than a typical owl, fluttered against the yellowed glass. Charon frowned and immediately made to open it.
“I don’t have a problem with her,” Draco insisted, unconvincingly.
Justin raises an eyebrow as the glow of the monitor turns his bronze skin pale. “Don’t
A snow globe holding a miniature Big Ben, from their trip to London.
Joey cursed - her vengeance would be hard to attain. “Harry, left two, Draco, on my right!” She commanded. Her jaw clenched as she growled, “The rabbit is mine.”
“Yes, we have some.” Draco patted at his clothes, the enchanted cloak shimmering as he moved. Joey glimpsed a couple of golden vials - Draco’s signature targeted explosion potion, already set to protect himself and his two partners.
“J.M. Barrie.”
“The cuts on my face weren’t as deep as these,” Draco said. His tone was not accusatory but composed. “Madam Pomfrey said that dittany wasn’t enough to erase the scars entirely. I’ll always have them.”
Luna, sensing that something is terribly wrong, stands, wavering and unsteady from the high. “What’s going on?”
Rabbit and Dao were joined by several other masked wizards and silvery Patronuses, swimming and trotting above their heads to keep the dementors at bay. Harry’s spirits lifted - perhaps none of the dementors had gotten to Draco.
The Charles River. It rings a bell. Pansy’s eyes slide towards her backpack. She’s sure she can find something to help her. “Alright.”
“Insufferable…” Draco muttered, but he was biting back a smile.
In the warm darkness of the dorms, Harry was able to get away from his friends’ questions. The only sound rippling through the silence was Draco’s breathing, which sounded slow and even. Though Harry doubted that the Slytherin would fall asleep that quickly, especially so early, he still kept quiet as he got dressed.
Malfoy blinked and shook his head, the lovey-dovey expression on his face replaced by his normal stern one. "I…" He began, glancing at Harry. "Oh, sweet Merlin. Did I really say all those things to you? And hold your hand?" Draco's porcelain-pale cheeks flushed a deep red, which Harry found quite gratifying. "Sorry about that. I'm so embarrassed." The other students were making similar apologies to their partners, and everyone's skin was tinted in varying shades of pink.
Harry raised his hands defensively. “All right. I wasn’t going to.” He turned to his boyfriend, taking his hand. “So? You think you can do it again on Monday?”
Hermione’s explanation seemed too nuanced to be an excuse to leave him. “All right.”
“Kayala,” Ray confirmed. “It’s strange she wanted to speak to the Chosen One, so close to the power transfer.” A sudden flash of fear crossed his face.
“If you want.”
Harry groaned, burying his face in his hands. “Who came up with this plan?”
“No.”
“Yes, Professor.”
Harry grimaced. “But Ron and Hermione-”
“It’s all right if you’d rather not say,” She assured him. “But keep that memory in mind when you practice, okay?”
“Good
Draco’s nervous eyes glanced at his two-person audience but never once flickered to his boyfriend. Draco was skilled at many things, Harry knew, but poise came naturally to him. Admittedly, he hadn’t exhibited that quality much in his youth, but now, it was one of the things Harry liked most about him. The confident flow of speech, the graceful movement of his hands, his impeccable posture. Harry figured he could single out Draco from a lineup just by resting his hands on his shoulders, without even looking.
Professor Dahlia nodded, tucking a lock of blue hair behind her ear. “Coolio. Also, not to impose on your language, but ‘lesbian’ is an adjective, not a noun. Why do you ask?”
“First of all, I want to thank you guys for dropping a free period to help us out,” Professor Dahlia said from the center of the classroom. Desks had been stacked neatly against the wall to provide an open space. On one side stood the thirteen eighth years; on the other, a group of third years that eyed the older students warily.
, Potter. Please.”
“And us?” Joey demanded.
“Good. Because I have something else for you, too.”
” Dahlia shouted at the boggart. Out of nowhere, a bucket of water dropped onto the creature’s head, sopping his black clothes and covering his head. The third years giggled delightedly, but the damage had already been done. Draco turned and fled, shielding his face from his classmates.
“Yeah.” Harry half-carried Draco to a nearby tree, letting him slump against it. Harry pressed a hand to his forehead - he was cold and clammy. “Draco?”
Wearing a slightly puzzled expression, Harry let Draco guide him to a chair in front of the sink. “Close your eyes.” Harry obeyed, and Draco turned on the faucet, spilling water into his hair before reaching for shampoo. It was the same kind he used himself, almost identical to the bottle his mother had sent him the first week of Hogwarts.
“I don’t suppose you and I could…go to Hogsmeade this weekend?”
Draco chuckled, and met Harry’s gaze for a bit longer than was necessary. When Draco broke off the connection, returning resolutely to his papers, his heart hammered in his chest.
Joey was too confused to correct him on her title. “Excuse me?”
“I reckon I can get over six this time,” Ron said, and Harry looked up from the pebbly ground to see that his friend was already calf-deep in the water, searching for flat rocks. “Want to join us?” Ron called to his girlfriend, but she shook her head.
“Somewhere near my left waist. Opaque, light pink flask.” Spots danced in his vision. “Hurry.”
“Er…”
Harry wanted terribly to say yes, but the truth was, he couldn’t. He was familiar with the eighteen-year-old Draco, knew of his parents’ situation, and knew a few of his habits, hobbies, and pet peeves. But of the Death Eater Malfoy, who committed countless, nameless crimes, Harry knew virtually nothing.
Harry scoffs. “Just because my accent’s a little weak doesn’t mean I’m not British anymore.” There are other reasons for that.
“Oh, right.” Harry shuffled to the crowd and faced her. He missed being captain, but Ginny was no doubt talented, and indeed more professional than he had ever been. She’s never called me Potter before, he thought, with a small sinking feeling.
“I know, mate, I’m just taking the piss,” Ron laughs.
“That’s quite poetic,” Harry comments.
A second person, a girl, by the sound of it, less familiar than the first. Harry cocks his head, straining for more snippets.
Draco expected to feel a rush of magic, hear the whoosh of the spell, something. But nothing seemed to have happened, and Harry’s disappointed silence revealed much.
In the early evening, twilight glittering on the white snow, the work had finally been completed. Stifled from the warmth and labor inside the house, Harry, Ron, Hermione, George, Ginny, Luna, and Draco bundled up in their various coats and scarfs to venture into the fresh winter chill.
“They’re from Wiltshire. Her uncle used to be proper good at football. Nearly made it to England national, but he shattered his knee.”
“You would never kill me,” said Lucius, and it was both a statement of relief and disdain.
A wand flew handle over tip through the rain, and Harry caught it. Magic hummed through his body, crackling like electricity, and he grinned as the rain turned to steam around him.
Draco’s mouth twitched. “How are you so sure?”
“We’ll talk, but I’m going to keep eating,” Draco tells him, “I don’t exactly get a two-hour lunch break.”
“The truth is, I knew Draco as Isabelle back then. He was one of those preppy rich girls, you know, but a hell of a lot smarter, and not as many friends.” Tape-Harry seems to choke up a little; he clears his throat. “Part of that might have been my fault.”
“Our former Muggle Studies professor, Charity Burbage, tragically perished in the last Wizarding War,” McGonagall continued, smartly deciding not to mention the Carrows. “We are honored to host the Ministry’s own Amelia Bones to take over her position.” From her spot at the head table, the newly minted Professor Bones nodded at the students’ respectful applause.
“Percy!” Ginny chided. “Don’t be mean.”
“Speaking of which.” Joey’s voice, urgent and stunned, caused the two wizards to look towards her.
To his immense disappointment, Faraday shook her head. “I don’t normally deal with this level of Dark magic. Even to let it into my home feels like a violation.”
“You’re right.” Draco winced; he hadn’t expected Harry to say that so bluntly. “I don’t need you. And I don’t need Ron or Hermione either. I lived for eleven years without knowing them, without knowing you. But I can say honestly that my life would be a whole lot worse without them, without you. You make me happy, Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled, but his eyes were welling, too.. “I’ve said this before, and I’m saying it now: I don’t know how I fell in love with someone who used to be my worst enemy. It just happened. And I don’t regret it happening.”
“What memories have you been using?” Hermione inquired as she unwrapped a sandwich.
Wishing fervently for any kind of cloaking charm, Harry edged slowly around the clearing, cringing at every crackle of twigs or leaves. Luckily, the rain hid his blunders, and the wizards seemed too preoccupied to watch for intruders. Dao and Rabbit seemed to be leading the conversation, speaking rapidly in Thai with much gesturing to Draco and the dementors swarming above the Patronuses protective bubble. Harry counted seven wizards in total. A piece of cake for a fully-fledged Auror force. For a wandless twenty-something? Hopeless.
He recalls a manila card in the post, addressed to a Mr. Justin Finch-Fletchley.

“As if all purebloods aren’t related,” Harry said dryly.
“Isn’t that funny,” Pansy jeered. “Look how little Potter does whatever Draco tells him to, Henrietta. Like a dog.”
“Stop! We can’t afford ta blow our cover,” Charon growled quietly. Around them, people averted their eyes from the bodies, covering the eyes of their children, moving away from the stench of death.
“Hey. Having fun?” Harry directed the question to both him and Henrietta, who grinned.
“We had nothing to do with that,” Draco cut in, “Which you might have known, had you bothered to do any magical back-tracing.”
A pecking sound came at the kitchen window an hour after breakfast. It was the Sunday the Hogwarts students had to return to school, and most of them were scattered about the house, looking for lost gloves and deciding whether to pack extra jackets.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Um, excuse me?”
The grass stood in vibrant green as if no one had been here in years. Clouds floated like leaves upon a stream across the sky, pale blue and grey in the late morning. It smelled like rain, heavy and metallic. Gravestones waited in neat monochrome rows, smooth stone tops unbothered by the possibility of getting wet.
“Don’t know. Something probably bit her, look,” Luna indicated with her hand. The edges of the cut were ragged as if torn with teeth. “A wolf, maybe. There are a lot of dangerous things in here.”
“The usual. ‘Don’t talk when the teacher’s talking,’ and all that. But she said I was right,” Harry added, “That people shouldn’t compare sufferings. You should’ve seen the look on Parkinson’s face.”
“Well…” Latifah shook off her shock and continued, “Caroline says it’d be good for you. I think it will be, too.”
•   •   •
“If it’s enough for you. Do you really like me that much, Potter?”
“It’s been months since we started trying to be friends.”
Joey smirked as she showed the face to him. “Nice try.”
“’ Bye, then, everyone. See you at Christmas. ‘Bye, Ginny.”
Draco thought when he saw that the attacker was masked up to their onyx-colored eyes. But they were dressed entirely in black and unencumbered by flowing robes. The stranger made a gripping gesture, and Joey was dragged upright, struggling against the magic, reaching for her weapon in slow-motion.
“That hair style is smashing.”
“What’s a
“Come on, you two,” She chided, “There’ll be pudding at the castle.”
Black eyes narrowed in anger. The witch’s fists opened to small orbs of fire, burning orange and blue with heat.
Hermione took Ginny by the arm and set her down immediately to perform a cleaning charm. “There,” Hermione said, “Gone already, no need to-”
“What?” Harry turns to see Draco toddling down the hall, a little boy in an overlarge sweater, then an ambling teenager, then himself, running a hand through his lavender-colored hair. Draco blinks at Harry, mouth falling open slightly. “Oh, no.”
As if sensing his presence, Potter looked over his shoulder and met Draco’s eyes; the Boy Who Lived wore an open and friendly expression on his face. “Hey, Malfoy,” Potter said as Draco neared. A look of disgust flitted across Weasley’s face as quickly as lightning, but the Slytherin didn’t miss it. Granger, however, gave him the courtesy of a nod.
The owl stopped in front of Draco, flapping its wings to stay afloat, a letter clutched in its beak. Gnome still in hand, Draco took the note with a frown. The owl gave a confirmatory screech and sped away again, its pale shape disappearing into the bright sky.
“Can’t be much,” Anaya said with a chuckle that Harry couldn’t quite decipher from a forced laugh. “Fallen rather far from the top, hasn’t he?”
Christmas came dressed in freshly fallen snow and an azure sky dotted with a few immaculate, fluffy clouds. The Burrow’s residents, despite being on the cusp of adulthood, still rushed with enthusiasm downstairs to the living room. The sweet-smelling pine tree that had been bedecked with lights, tinsel, and moving ornaments the day before stood in all its dazzling glory. Beneath it, wrapped in brilliantly colored packages, were…
“What?”
“Here.” Harry took Draco’s wrist and placed a small object into his open palm. Draco peered at a pin emblazoned with a moving, illustrated image of a scarlet squid drifting in green water; it waved its tentacles serenely, brushing through minutely-detailed strands of seaweed. “I do
“Do you need help, ma’am?”
“I knew you
“You got it,” She replies with a knowing smile.
“I’m not accusing you of anything.” Harry backs off quickly. “It’s just… This is so bizarre.”
Potter had smiled with so much hope that it was stupid. Draco’s heart dropped like a stone once he realized that once - if - Lucius gained back all his memories, he’d recall his son’s homosexuality. Draco would be disowned all over again. He thought of the tearstained letter, gathering dust in his trunk, inscribed with razor-sharp words that cut him to his core.
Vung Tau appeared less idyllic up close, but every city had dirty streets, plants growing wild at the edge of crumbling buildings. A motley collection of Vietnamese inhabitants, sunscreened tourists, backpacking students, walking or on growling mopeds, filled the road and sidewalks. Harry couldn’t imagine a more different city from London, but he loved it all the same.
“Get up!” Lucius kicks his son in the stomach, and Draco grunts, remaining limp. Lucius grabs his face and tries to force the Veritaserum down his throat, but Draco twists away and stands with difficulty. “Rosier,” Lucius commands, and the Death Eater steps forward, punching Draco across the face.
Draco clicked his tongue while making a finger gun, a gesture that Harry found strangely American. Joey appeared duly bashful.
It’s brief but really fascinating.”
“Bisexual?” Hermione offered kindly. Harry’s head lifted, and he saw her smiling at him.
“So, this is why you brought me.” Harry’s expression was calm, his gaze meeting Joey’s in a gesture of understanding. “You have a half-hour,” Harry continued. “A half-hour, unless you’re planning not to come back.”
Harry understood.
The stranger tenses, mouth deepening into a frown. “Sorry. I thought you were someone else.”
“Oh, getting familiar, are we?” Theodore slid the shirt back into the rack. “It’s like I said, I came for Tabitha. But all right, I will say,” he added as Draco glared, “I was hoping to catch up with you, too. Haven’t seen you since-”
“It’s a chore just being around her,” Henrietta sighed as the party in front of them was led to their seats, and the multitude shifted forward.
Then he faltered. “Did you say half-blood?”
“Alright. Goodnight, Harry.”
“I suppose so, Potter.”
She’s had two glasses already; she doesn’t trust herself with more. Padma clicks the mouse rapidly, if only to settle her nerves. The technology is doing most of the heavy lifting now, whirring through memories at a steady rate. Part of her wants to leave, but she’s glad to stay, and she couldn’t stand having to come all the way back if something goes wrong again.
If he was honest with himself, Draco almost jumped at the chance to go home. He wanted to leave the cracking noise of spells, the dampness of blood and rain, for the safety of Cambridge and St. Mungo’s. But then he caught the fierce look in Harry’s eyes, and Draco knew that the man he loved would stay behind amidst the danger and smoke. Draco couldn’t sit still at home, not if he knew he could stay and watch Harry’s back. Harry would do the same for him.
Faint moonlight threw the contents of the room into sharp silhouettes. A figure twitched on the bed, the blanket on top of it nearly falling off. Harry edged forward and put his cup down on a nearby nightstand, squinting through the tenebrosity.
Draco closed his eyes, opened them. “Okay.” His torso moved with a breath, and Harry felt his nervous energy, felt the tension in his magic before he even said a word. “
“We’ll be back before you know it,” Harry told his friends. He took Draco’s hand as they followed Joey to the portal.
Draco took out his wand and held Harry’s hand almost on instinct.
Draco bent closer, his hand brushing against hers. It didn’t move; she didn’t react. He knew what would happen, even before it did, but he was numb to it. He’d watched this fate come too many times. Harry, though, shook with resistance, clutching Dahlia’s hand as if trying to pull her back.
“This all matches what I heard at Hogwarts. Some people from the Following came to our school,” Harry told Ray. “A few attacked. One of them talked to me on the train, asking me to join their cause; she seemed to be their leader.” Harry paused, a realization crossing his face. Draco suspected what he was thinking.
They arrive back at Draco’s just as morning begins to trundle along in full swing, the streets filling with commuters and parents taking their kids to school. The noise of cars replaces the sound of the cassette tape as Harry takes it out of the console, then rests a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hey. We’re here.”
“Yeah…I suppose so,” Harry bent his head toward his essay to hide the feeling of searing disappointment. Why would Hermione talk to Draco and not Harry? He’d finally been getting used to being without her and Ron, and briefly considered moving on completely after finding new friends the night before. But this new development felt like a kick in the stomach. Harry watched Draco, whose soft lips parted slightly as he read from the poetry book, sunlight glancing off his blonde hair.
Harry glanced at Draco, noticing his tense shoulders and gaze fixed upon the bedspread. Harry offered his hand, and Draco took it.
Only Draco eyed his companion with a mixture of disapproval and interest as Harry took the seat next to him and hastily retrieved his copy of
Draco paused, letting their hands fall away, but he kept them entwined. With his other arm, he leaned casually against the kitchen counter, not-so-subtly filling more of the space between them. Harry’s heart was beating so loudly in his ears, he wondered how the whole house didn’t hear it.
Draco thought to himself. Next to him, a mousy-haired secretary knocked timidly on the door.
“I guess I’ll see you at breakfast,” Harry said casually, inching towards the door.
“Not exactly. I don’t fancy, er, a particular person. Although I do find them attractive. Objectively. But lately, I dunno. It just feels right being with them. It’s similar to how I feel about being with you both, but not quite. It’s hard to explain,” Harry sighed. He felt like he was grasping at straws.
Sunlight receded slowly from the space between them. Twilight was on its way. Draco watched the shadows on Harry’s face; he slid his hand over his jaw, rough and unshaven.
The door to the apartment finally,
“Shut your mouth,” Harry said suddenly, and before either Dahlia or Draco could stop him, he stood up, glaring at Pansy. “Shut your
“How many?” Draco asked.
“But that’s me. Potter.” Harry struggles for what to say next. Clearly, this person isn’t the girl he knew in Salisbury. For one, he seems more comfortable in his skin.
Harry rested his head on his arm. The letter was quite long. Unwittingly, he slipped into a dream.
Harry’s heart leaped in his throat, and he considered standing to help, but before he could, Draco said, “Let her go.”
“Probably nothing we’d ever make,” Ron said, in response to his girlfriend’s question. “I dunno why Slughorn even wants them.”
A sudden breeze rustled the spectators’ scarves, the red and yellow robes, and the nearby trees. Ginny dissipated the suspended patterns she’d made, then tucked her wand back into the holster in her boot. Harry watched, idly, as Ginny moved behind Willow, helpfully tying her cornrows into a ponytail as the younger girl adjusted her gloves.
“We don’t have any furniture yet,” Draco pointed out, unscrewing a bottle cap.
At Lockhart, the receptionist, Luna Lovegood, beams up at Harry. Today, her earrings are made of painted clay mushrooms. “Hello, Mr. Potter. How are you this morning?”
“You’re wrong,” Draco chokes, though he barely believes it himself.
For a moment, the flames turn as red as Voldemort’s eyes, and Draco feels a wrench of loss as he watches his future go up in smoke.
It had been a while since Harry had done any Transfiguration, but he turned to the fountain, both hands raised. “
“Not really. Do you think I should be?”
“If you’re so sure, why don’t you go talk to them?”
“Following your shitty example.”
“You think you can just walk away from this?” Lucius drawls, walking in a full circle around them. “You’re a fool, Draco. You were born into this life. You can’t escape.”
“Yes.” He gently replaced the items and closed the box. “It’s very nice, Harry. Thank you.”

“Is that another way of saying you can’t hold your poison?” Draco ribbed.
Resisting the urge to turn around and face Draco, who dutifully took notes a few seats away, Harry folded the parchment and slipped it back between the pages. He tried to squash his grin as he copied the diagram for transfigurative wrist movements.
Harry took all that Draco had told him and attempted to make sense of it, recalling how clingy Pansy appeared toward the Slytherin in later years. Back then, Draco seemed to enjoy her constant attention and affection - but then again, if his prior status as Death Eater was any indication, Draco knew how to put on an act. And he did so convincingly.
“Fair enough,” Harry smirked into his cup, secretly glad that Draco wasn’t afraid to knock him down a peg or two. “People don’t assume we’re together since we’re both blokes,” He pointed out after a sip of butterbeer. “We’d have to be snogging outright for them to realize.”
“What are we going to do?” Draco mumbled as he rested his forehead on Harry’s shoulder. “Pansy’s made it her mission to make my life hell. And now she’s got the perfect ammunition.”
“Silence,
“Alright, you can go,” She said cheerily, and Harry left. The bell clanged a few moments later, signaling the end of the first period. The Gryffindors gathered their things and began to exit the classroom. Ginny and Hermione said their goodbyes to their friends and left for class, while Ron mentioned something about the library.
“Hey, girl!” Harry winced as Athena nipped his fingers, yellow eyes glaring at him accusingly. “I know, I know, I’m sorry. But we know you can take care of yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s heart sank. They didn’t like him as much as he thought they did. “Yes. That’s fine.”
Draco’s lip trembles, but he forces himself not to cry. Crying means weakness, and he will
, Ronald,” Hermione interrupted, and both Harry and Draco chuckled, knowing exactly the look on her face. “I’m sure you boys have a lot of stories to tell, but save it till Harry and Draco come home. No doubt this call is costing them a fortune.”
She did not hear him. Her eyes fixed to the sky as if searching for the stars hidden behind the storm clouds.
“I’m not planning on anything,” Joey said honestly, and her wand slipped into her ready palm.
Draco was so close Harry could see the pale, icy blue that ringed his irises. “You think we’re falling for each other?”
Perspiration had gathered on Malfoy’s brow, and he wiped it off impatiently with his bare forearm, slightly mussing his blond hair. As he reached for a flask to pour the potion in, Harry caught a glimpse of his arm. The inside of Malfoy’s left forearm was wildly crisscrossed with raised scars, some redder and newer than others. Harry’s eyebrows shot up into his hair; Malfoy had been looking more wan and depressed lately, but harming himself? It didn’t seem very Draco-Malfoy-ish of him.
A blast of warmth hit Draco and Harry as they sidled hurriedly into the hut, door slamming behind them. A fire roared cheerily beneath a copper kettle that emitted a white plume of steam. A couple of pheasants hung from the ceiling. The ominous scent of burning flour and raisins meant that Hagrid was baking his infamous rock cakes. His dog, Fang, was nowhere to be seen, but Harry noticed a terrarium in the corner that housed a small, hedgehog-like creature that appeared to be sleeping; a knarl, Harry guessed.
“Draughts for flesh regeneration and blood replenishment.”
“Wasn’t it…” Harry shuddered involuntarily at the memory of that nightmarish night. Enchanted fiery beasts devouring forgotten objects and taking the life of their foolish caster. “Destroyed?”
Draco’s pale fingers curl around a glass of dark soda. He lifts it to his lips, eyes trailing slowly around the restaurant and its customers, never resting on Harry.
Draco’s mind, muddled with fear, was easy to enter. Harry heard the same sounds he did: a deeper, male voice, shouting, and the shrieks and pleading of a woman.
A friendly, warm atmosphere settled over the eight students as they relaxed in the golden candlelight. Utensils scraped quietly against plates as they passed around food, waiting for Draco to begin. He took a moment to think, pale fingers thoughtfully tracing the rim of his goblet. When he spoke, his silver eyes were focused on the people around him, no longer dipping to the table in hesitation.
, had just put up its loading walkway. Harry could pass for a model, Draco thought, on the cover of some glossy and unmoving Muggle magazine. Though perhaps not with the round spectacles. The twenty-first-century youth didn’t appreciate a bookish beauty like Draco did.
history worksheet!” Ron cried, only half-listening, and the paper zoomed into his hand.
“Wait, not in the open,” Draco muttered as he pulled away. “Here…” He sat down on Harry’s bed, its inhabitant following suit. With a flick of his wand, Draco caused the hangings to draw themselves tightly around the bed. Another incantation and an orb of light floated above their heads, basking their faces in gold.

“Harry Potter.” Joey said the name like she would any other, and Harry realized-
Ginny looked a bit taken aback at this but decided to take it as a compliment. “Thanks.”
A single green leather glove. More dragon sculptures, of wire and glazed clay, handled with care. A toothbrush. A half-full bottle of cologne. A box of red hair dye. A heating pad. A scarf striped in their school colors, green and gold. A green plastic comb.
“The end,” Ollie concluded, satisfied. “And we got a happy ending this time! How fortunate.”
“You would have done the same.”
“Okay.” Harry knelt beneath their workstation for the root, counting out the stalks and setting them upon a cutting board. He had just gotten out his silver dagger when Draco returned with a vial and a bell jar.
. Stop this. It’s not too late.”
And then he’s running, cleats over grass, bruised knees against the fog, teammates pulling into formation around him.
Draco frowned as they entered a clearing, the same one in which he’d been attacked by Buckbeak all those years ago. “What are we…?”
“Here.” Luna held out her bag to them. Draco made a face, reluctant to touch raw meat, but he gamely took a piece and threw it. The nearest thestral snapped it out of the air and chewed viciously. Draco shrieked and took a few hurried steps back.
“Hey. Where’s Erin?” Harry asked.
“Yeah,” he replies. “Something like that.”
“C’mon, mate, the whole castle will hear you.”
“Where are you going?” Harry asks.
Harry decided he could dissect the meaning of that exchange later. With the witch distracted, he summoned forth a surge of strength and got to his feet, pushing against her constraints, determined to fight back.
Something warm was draped across Joey’s waist. The blanket, thin but sufficient, moved as her bedmate tried to shake her awake.
“God, I feel awful,” Joey muttered, resting back on both her arms. She trembled all over.
“Glad to hear it. Partner assignments are starting soon,” Antigone said conversationally. “You two are one of the only pairs I know that will certainly be assigned with each other. You work impeccably together.”
Harry looked up from the letter to see Draco pacing back and forth in the snow, muttering to himself and running nervous hands through his blond hair. “I have to go…But they’ll kill me…I need to find out what happened,” He said quietly.
“I thought I removed it.” A range of emotions, from confusion to betrayal, paraded across Potter’s face.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco shrug. “Doesn’t mean it’s not true.”
“I can’t.”
,” She proclaims, flopping onto an armchair in the living room.
“Yeah,” Harry said with a heavy sigh, “You saw how nosy they’re getting,” He added, indicating the common room with a jerk of the head.
on it. “Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley,” She said coolly as they entered. Her voice was lower than most women’s, though not unpleasantly so. “Please take a seat. Hermione, you may sit next to Owen. Ron, with Gavin. Harry with Anaya, there.” She jerked her head towards the back of the class, where a small, dark Slytherin girl sat stiffly. “Perhaps keeping you three apart will lower those tardy tendencies, eh?” She chuckled to herself as if there was a joke everyone else was missing.
“I want to show you something,” Draco said, a little out of breath. “And possibly ask a favor.”
“Good luck,” She told them, and not a moment too soon. The dragon’s eyes snapped open, milky-white against the void of its body, and it let loose a gravelly screech. The surrounding wizards cheered. Harry and Draco sprinted forward as it took flight. And Joey - she spun around, heart in her throat, and flung open the nearest door.
Draco knew that after he’d rejected her, Pansy would exact some kind of vengeance, though, at eighteen, she had the patience to bide her time and plan. At the beginning of the year, she acted friendly towards him, more or less, but Draco could tell it was a front. And when she’d found out about him and Harry, he feared that she’d wield the information for as long as she could to make his life hell.
part of the series. The next oneshot will be available, I hope, within the next week or so. If you were asking about smut in this particular series, I’m going to say no. I don’t mind sexual scenes, but when they get too graphic, it tends to ruin the more serious tone of the story that I’m going for.
This time, it was Harry who kissed him first. Draco’s ears were deaf to the whispers and exclamations, eyes closed against the incredulous faces, his other senses overflowing with skin and gardenias and the hum in Harry’s throat. The Three Broomsticks' patrons could have all been making the most obscene, hateful gestures at them, and Draco couldn’t have cared less.
docked alongside other small cruise liners, its white hull bright against the ocean’s deep turquoise. A beach edged along the whole coast, dotted with people, boats shaped like long canoes, cabanas, and umbrellas. Kites in all colors and patterns swooped before an azure sky painted with white clouds, circling around a lush green hill that was not quite a mountain, presiding over the buildings below like a half-asleep guardian. The city itself gleamed in the late afternoon, sunlight winking off the glass and metal.
Harry silenced him with a fierce kiss, parting Malfoy’s lips unwillingly with his tongue. Simultaneously, Harry pressed Malfoy’s knees to the desk, arms flexing with the effort, to allow him easier access. Malfoy let out a startled “Mmph!” as Harry’s length filled him once more, silver eyes rolling back at the sensations this new angle created. But the moment he’d gained his bearings once more, his gaze snapped back to the boy fucking him ruthlessly, taking in every drop of sweat and inch of bronzed skin. The order in Harry’s emerald eyes was crystal clear, and Malfoy wasted no time complying.
“Snap out of it,” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, though he was commanding himself, too. “We’ll make a break for it, okay? Draco?”
“What do you think, then?” Harry coaxed.
Faraday shook her head gravely, not bothering to hold out her hands this time. “Not good. If I’d succeeded, you wouldn’t look so distressed. Whatever’s inside you is beyond my reach.”
Joey looked positively revolted. “That came out of
“Draco?” But the boy had already fallen asleep, and Harry watched him for a while, his lips parted, chest rising and falling with slow breath.
Even Joey had human vices, and she nodded. “All right. But quickly.”
The message is short but straightforward.
“Harry, listen to me.” As Harry began to break free, Draco grabbed him, pulling him close. Though his own face was ashen, Draco held him and whispered, quickly, urgently, and slowly Harry relaxed enough to be let go. Then, both of them looked at Joey. “Are you okay?”
The café near the beach has a decent cup of hot chocolate and less-decent booths that make Harry sit up too straight. He bends over his journal again, doodling meaningless things, writing meaningless words. Someone else walks in – Harry spots the pink hair again, and the boy. More of a man, really, but clean-shaven and with an air of sophisticated youth. He slides into a booth facing Harry, just far enough that he can still see his face. The stranger orders a plate of pancakes and a cup of coffee.
Together, Draco and Harry released the spell. Draco sighed, a great tension relieved from his arms. He prayed he wouldn’t have to bear it again.
“Let’s go!” Draco forces a manic smile. “Let’s go, now, just the two of us. The stars are so clear there, and the ice is still and empty… It’ll be nice.”
, honestly…” And to Harry’s surprise, hands patted his shoulders as well, sweat- and rain-stained faces beaming at him. “Good catch, Potter!”
“I mean…what if my robes rip, or something? What if someone sees?”
"Malfoy?" Ron hissed, "As in Draco Malfoy? What would that scum want with Harry?"
The eighth years’ last class of the day was Herbology; during Defense Against the Dark Arts, the only other class they had all together, Professor Dahlia gave them a quiz and Harry hadn’t yet had a chance to speak with Draco. That week, he barely spent any free time in the Slytherin common room, but when Harry asked if he was okay, he always responded with a resounding “yes.”
Hagrid grunted approvingly as he put on a lumpy oven mitt, grabbed the kettle, and poured hot water. “Suits her. One of you can keep her if you like.”
“I know I do.”
"Oh, Harry," Hermione frowned sympathetically. "C'mon, let's get some breakfast in you. We're all going to need our energy today."
Draco’s breathing grew shallow. For all of his adult life, working in the porn industry, he’d been advanced upon more times than he could count. Handsy actresses, sleazy video directors, even his own father to some degree - they’d comb their greedy fingers through his hair, grope him when they thought he was asleep, give him sloppy kisses on the cheek that he hadn’t asked for. And yet, here was Harry Potter, named the “king of sex” by Vanity Fair, asking for permission. Draco had never gotten turned on so easily by mere words before.
“Uh… Whatcha doing, Pans?” Justin calls. “Oh - ha, pans. Like pots and pans.” Luna giggles, and he grins.
The creaking of the dungeons’ door echoed throughout the stone-lined common room. The trio’s conversation paused as they listened to someone’s footsteps, accompanied by the sound of water dripping on the floor.
Hermione rolled her eyes exasperatedly. “Didn’t you read the notice?”
“Choke me,” Ginny pleads, and Harry knows her well enough to guess she’d hate it, but she’s searching for something to fill her, so he obliges. He grapples with that feeling, too, the gnawing emptiness that reaches for lust and love like a fumbling hand on a high shelf. Harry’s fingers close impersonally on her pale neck.
“You think this was his plan all along?” Ron asked doubtfully; the pair seemed to be having a conversation that excluded Harry, who wasn’t sure which “he” they referred to. “Did he think he could pull it off from the beginning?”
Padma gave an exaggerated sigh, standing from the table while wiping at her eyes. “You’re impossible,” She declared and turned to leave.
The portrait swung open, but not of the inhabitant’s own volition; Ginny poked her fiery head through, eyeing them worriedly.
Mostly-equal parts of character and plot development going on...Harry-Draco interactions are at the forefront, of course, but we also get a glimpse of how Draco's getting along with the others.
Of course, I am.”
“I’m not at liberty to say.” Draco nearly laughed at Harry’s serious face, but he smothered the smile at these words and elbowed him.
“Other than the weird Horcrux Hermione in Slytherin’s locket? No.”
“I suppose not. But seeing as I know no one else here,” Draco holds out his hand. “Let’s start over. My name is Draco Malfoy. I just moved here from England.”
But what the commentator said next, Harry did not hear, because Ginny was shouting, “We won! We won! This is it, final stretch, everyone…!” Willow, Danny, Richie, Eleanor, and Quinn were all slapping each other on the back, congratulating, “Nice save on that last shot!” “You three were
Harry recalled the bottle they were talking about, a slim glass vial reinforced with copper wiring. The concoction was purely Draco’s invention, a sort of teleportation spell in a bottle. Harry didn’t think they would need it either - they could Apparate, after all - but Joey had been insistent. Better to be too prepared than not enough.
“Your hair’s getting long.”
“It’s fine. I’m just saying,” Harry glanced over at Draco, who had drained his mug and listened attentively, “I’m not dating him because I feel sorry for him. Maybe, deep down, that’s why I let him approach me, but that’s definitely not the case anymore. I genuinely like you, Draco,” He continued, speaking now directly to his boyfriend, “For lots of reasons. It’d take me all day to list them all. I hope you don’t think I’m with you just because I feel obliged to.”
“My humblest apologies,” Melocotones said with an obnoxious bow of the head. “Please, stick close to me, all of you. We shan’t speak of the mission’s details in the open.” He turned rather jauntily and headed back to the pedestal, the trio of young Aurors close at his heels. Melocotones took out his wand, and Draco inhaled sharply, glancing about at the Muggles, but none of them seemed to notice. Melocotones slid the tip of his wand vertically down the brick. Nothing appeared to change, but Joey felt the atmosphere shift, something like cinnamon and ancient, castle-bred musk drifting from within the pedestal. The scent of magic.
The inexplicable scent of dewy gardenias nearly made Harry forget what he was going to say next. He put his arms around Draco’s neck and unswervingly met his gaze. “No, I’m serious! We should talk about this,” He said teasingly.
A Muggle weapon in a magical  fight. Harry wasn’t sure if Joey was either very brave or a complete idiot.
“Need something?” Draco asked, not appreciating being stared at.
“He’s not on the map. He dropped off the map, I have no idea where he…” Justin breaks off, abandoning the computer, and reaches for Harry’s house phone instead, dialing Pansy’s number as fast as possible. “Come on, pick up, pick up…”
“She said she’s lost,” Harry protested without looking at him. “I’ll help her get where she wants to go.”
“So, where are you going?” Harry asked casually as they brought their dishes to a marked receptacle.
“Bullshit,” Joey said abruptly, and her partners looked at her in surprise. “That’s what the game is called. It’s not a game of speed, but deception and cunning.”
Harry struggles not to roll his eyes. “We’ve got twenty minutes. I can show you the grounds if you’d like.”
A flurry of movement as Harry hurriedly removed the spoon, and Draco flicked his wand at the fire, extinguishing it. “Come on,” Draco murmured, fanning away the lilac smoke.
Draco, dry to the end, answered, “Legally speaking.”
“One day, a bird flew over the desert and dropped a seed next to the poisonous flower. A rose grew there.”
“You’re an idiot,” Draco sighed, but he didn’t mean it, and Harry could tell.
“Yes, yes I am. I’m infallible; you should know this by now.”
“One of these days, we won’t have to be so careful,” Harry hoped.
It was Draco’s turn now, and he tensed uncomfortably under everyone’s gaze. “I guess…Same as Weasley. Looking forward to the future.” His voice quavered slightly at the last word, and though everyone else missed it, Harry certainly hadn’t.
Draco hovered by the couch his boyfriend sat in, unsure whether his presence was intrusive or not. “Good morning,” He said neutrally, and the trio responded with equal politeness. “Someone’s birthday?” He asked, eyes lingering on the torn wrappings.
Large windows looked out onto the Black Lake, presenting a view of prickly underwater plants and sleepy grindylows. In front of one of the windows sat a young man with platinum-blond hair.
Joey grit her teeth in anger, scanning the trees, but before she could decide where Rabbit had gone, a familiar shout ruptured her focus.
"That's alright," Ron said and rubbed her comfortingly on the back. "Although, it is pretty weird that he contacted you, mate. Don't you think?"
“Show-off,” Ginny grinned, then sharply blew twice through a whistle hanging around her neck. “Reverse directions!” She called out.
“Hi.”
To escape from the stifling setting of the classroom, Draco and Harry took their conversation outside, to one of Hogwarts’ many roofed walkways next to the dining hall. Snow had begun to fall faintly, dusting the branches of a nearby tree with powder. Harry shook slightly in the cold, having forgotten his extra-thick cloak, but Draco didn’t seem bothered at all by the weather.
Hermione’s lips press into a thin line. She grabs her basket of finished laundry and heads up the stairs. Ron doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes, scratching the ears of their dog.
A flash of black past his shoulder. Harry ducked and rolled, narrowly avoiding the Bludger. A sickening thump and frustrated grunt a few feet away told him a Ravenclaw Chaser had been hit instead. A few minutes later, a bell clang echoed across the field, and a moment later, so did an amplified voice, “Ravenclaw scores first, making it ten-zero!”
Harry punches him in the arm to shut him up. “I’m not queer,” He hisses.
The tutor, patient but disappointed, raises his voice and raps the point of a quill on the table. Startled, Draco glances back, blinking rapidly. The star chart before him remains empty.
One after another, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny left and returned, each glowing with the prospect of the future. The rest of the class seemed excited, too, their voices buzzing with post-school plans, and twice Dahlia had to tell them to be quiet. Finally, she called, “Harry Potter.”
The younger woman, face hidden by a tiger-shaped visage, jerked her head in recognition. “Just a moment,” She said in Thai, “I want to speak to her.” Dao walked closer, footsteps hushed on the dirt. A sun-darkened hand emerged from the red fabric, grabbing the older woman’s chin and forcing her face upward. The prisoner gasped at her touch, but unwillingly met her gaze - her eyes were bloodshot, streaming with tears.
“My name is Luna Marie Lovegood, and I am here to erase Padma Amita Patil.”
“That would defeat the purpose,” Hermione said soothingly - easy for her to say since she was winning by three pairs. “Wait a moment…Yes! A four, I win!” She cried, much to the dismay of her friends. “Shall we play again?”
“Which way do we…” Draco broke off as the roof began to tilt, the supports on one side failing.
he told himself,
“You two,” She points at them, “Sickening.”
In the end, it was Draco who calmed Harry’s frantic brain waves. The rest of the Slytherins and eighth years had gone to bed close to midnight. The Black Lake pressed darkly against the windows, the crescent moon sparing no luminescence for its depths. Thus, it was by the warm green light of the enchanted sconces that Draco pulled Harry aside and sat with him on one of the room’s many black leather couches.
“You scared me,” he said meekly.
“It’s my business if another pureblood is on track to fuck up their bloodline with filth.”
His heart was beating desperately fast. No. This wasn’t supposed to happen; no one was supposed to know.
“Easy for you to say,” said Ron, “You don’t have to go to school.”
“More.” Draco’s eyes opened in anticipation, taking in the glow of the office, a workspace they’d marked as their own. “I want you.”
“Do you remember Hermione’s end-of-term paper last year?”
“Humming is not singing, Pansy dear.”
“Good point,” George doffed his hat at them. “Have a jolly good school year,” He added, in his best imitation of an upper-crust accent.
The walk from the apartment is a short, biting one - the brightness of the day is deceptive, and the wind blows just as icily as the night before. Harry is eager to get back into his apartment, and he dials the thermostat as soon as he and Draco walk in.
“Joey’s trying her best like all of us are. She made a mistake,” Footsteps sounded on the floorboard, then the springs creaked as Draco joined Harry on the edge of the bed, “That you still haven’t forgiven her for. That’s not the Harry I know.”
“I’d better get going,” Hermione declared as they ascended to the ground floor. She gave Ron a quick kiss on the cheek and a brief wave to the other two before rushing off to Muggle Studies.
“What do you mean, ‘why?’ They’re supposed to be my friends, and they completely tossed me the minute I brought you into the equation.”
The secretary knocked once on the door. “Come in,” Commander Danjuma called, and Joey was let inside.
“You’re welcome.”
•  •  •
Andromeda waved him off with one butterfly-like hand. Though she and Draco looked almost nothing alike, Harry could spot the family resemblance in their mannerisms. A few times during dinner, they’d unknowingly performed the same, simultaneous gesture. “Please, he’s my grandson. I’m lucky to be able to spend this much time with him.” She smiled warmly at Teddy, whose hair turned rose-pink as he beamed right back. He flung his short arms open wide and knocked over the sippy cup of water on his high chair.
Professor Slughorn had strolled to his fallen student, a look of grandfatherly concern displayed on his face. “Anything I can do to help, Madam?”
,” Harry intoned, sending the spell searching for anyone around. But either there was no one, or the culprit knew how to cover their presence.
The Patronus’s light bathed them in a small pocket of warmth as they moved past the prison cells. Cobblestone and thick metal doors separated them from the victims inside, but Draco could still hear their muffled moans and sobs of despair.
“Eugh, isn’t it damp?” Joey groaned.
Once they had gone, Harry collapsed to his knees. He looked across the lake, at the green hills, foggy mountains, the faraway trees, and saw nothing. His hands and feet were cold, but nothing felt so numb as his heart. Fear and guilt clawed icily up his throat.
“I will lead us soon enough,” Dao said proudly, straightening. “I’ve told you my plan.”
Another figure, dressed in red, slowly approached from behind the rabbit wizard. Her mask was carved intricately in the shape of a tiger, but Harry quickly realized it couldn't have been his old professor. The way this witch carried herself, haughty and regal, the way her dark hands rose with the Patronus Charm, was completely different.
Harry acted first, and a jet of blue light landed where Dao’s fingers touched Dahlia’s skin. Cruel, white frostbite raced over Dao’s hand - she screeched and let Dahlia go.
