Harry, however, wasn't really listening anymore. He had heard a door open a few seconds ago in the back of the room and had already turned towards that direction. Oh sweet mother of…
Harry didn't bother to say anything in return. He turned towards the door again, took a deep breath and let it out before knocking three times and entering Draco's room.
Harry took a deep breath and let it out before starting. "Ginny, have you already forgotten what happened before Christmas?" he asked.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, seemingly frustrated. "You just don't fucking get it. It's none of your business. Leave me alone."
day during the war. I heard about the dreadful plots against you... but I couldn't do anything. Then one day you were brought to the Manor and I was so afraid that you were gonna die, and... I wanted to save you, but... you know." His voice faded.
"Uh... why not", Harry sighed absent-mindedly, resting his face against his palm. His gaze was glued to the Slytherin table where he saw Malfoy sitting with Goyle, the two of them having an intense conversation together. His head felt like exploding by any minute. Almost having kissed Malfoy, Ginny wanting to sleep with him… What the hell was he supposed to do?
Before he had them fully buttoned, Draco pushed the curtain aside and pulled Harry into the light. Draco circled around him. He tugged the sleeves down on Harry’s arms, smoothing out the material before folding them into crisp cuffs around his elbows.
“It’s the middle of the night.” Draco said, keeping his tone hushed and neutral, “What are you doing out here?” Potter shrugged in reply. He shivered and leaned closer to the fire. Sighing, Draco summoned a blanket off one of the couches. It drifted through the air before flopping down on Harry’s lap. The Gryffindor mouthed a silent thanks. Winding the blanket around himself, he raised an eyebrow at Draco and stared at the clock on the wall to return the question, “I thought I heard a noise out here, so I came to check.”
“You’re glad now, just wait to see how much gladder you’ll be when I’m finished with your hair.” He ran his fingers through Harry’s hair for one last time, “Now’s the part where I need you to stay still for me.” Harry shut his eyes. He couldn’t see anything anyway. A comb flattened his wiry hair down around his cheeks and down on his neck. Cool metal brushed against his neck, making Harry want to jump out of his skin. But he stopped himself.
"Because it brought us together," He drawled. Lifting the old trainer by its laces, it dangled in front of them, "Would you like to do the honors, or shall I?" Harry pressed his hands against his flushing cheeks, warming his chilled fingers.
“Really, Harry, now you speak?” Harry nodded, curling into Draco’s arm in the tight space of the bed.
“What does happen when Umbridge looks down here?” He asked in a low voice. Snape sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
How exactly did Snape know about the ancient Hogwarts Writ of House Protection? That's what Harry wants to know. The opportunity to ask comes when Draco drags Harry to Snape's private lab to help out with some brewing. What does Harry learn when he's supposed to be sitting quietly?
“What the hell just happened?” Ron blurted out. Hermione’s gaze followed the two out of the Great Hall.
“Just tell me,” He said, his gaze dropping to his wrist. Harry gripped the spot where the words were as tight as he could without wincing, “please,” He added softly.
“This takes you to my uncle’s private potion’s lab, hurry there and wait for someone to come and get you,” He ordered.
“I don’t think this is a good idea.” He caught the blond’s eyes in the reflection of the ornate mirror. Draco tousled the dark locks that flopped around Harry’s glasses, “Haircuts and I don’t turn out well. It just grows back in a few hours.”
“It’s fine. If you want to make it up to me, I’ve been invited to a dinner tomorrow night and I need a plus one.” Harry’s eyes widened behind the lenses of his glasses. He brushed any remaining hairs off the back of his neck.
Draco rolled his eyes. He took the second to tie up his dressing gown before approaching the stricken Gryffindor. Harry didn’t seem to realize that he wasn’t alone in the room anymore, he didn’t stop pounding on the wall until Draco spoke.
“Hush Potter, you had this coming,” A voice, muffled beyond recognition, sounded from behind him. Harry shuddered, straining to get a peek at his assailant. But the arms gripped him tighter, “None of that. It will be challenging for you I’m sure, but try to be on your best behavior.” Harry let out one last strangled mewled behind the hand, falling still.
Draco draped a sheet around Harry’s shoulders, breathing close to his neck when he tucked it into one of Harry’s new sweaters. Harry bit his lip.
He felt Harry’s arms wrap around him, pulling him toward the Fifth-year boys’ room without breaking the embrace. In the distance, he could hear Blaise’s fists pounding on the entrance. But the other boy would give up eventually and despite his quick temper, it would fade quickly too. Especially once Draco revealed that the essay was under Blaise’s pillow the whole time. And until he did, Draco was safe in Harry’s arms and thankful for the Write of House Protection.
Draco shook his head, letting the scrap of paper fall to one of the cluttered side tables, "Any terms to the bet, then?" He asked, half hoping that Potter would slip up and answer him out loud. It wasn't like he actually expected the Gryffindor to take him up on it. But his dark hair flopped over his face when he bent back over a new scrap of parchment. After a few scratched lines, the new parchment landed in Draco's waiting hands.
“There’s 1000 in there. If that’s not enough, let me know.” Draco rolled his eyes but pocketed the coin purse. Stopping Potter from throwing his money around. That would have to be a lesson. He reached for a pad of paper, summoning a quill from the other side of the room to make a list of everything he’d have to do to fix Harry Potter. To turn him into a proper lord.
“And how many times have you visited this week?” Harry’s brows furrowed. He thought through his week, but couldn’t remember coming to the Slytherin common room at all. Even the lunch he ate with the Slytherins his nose was stuck in one of his textbooks. A wave of guilt swept over him. He supposed he had been neglecting Draco this week.
Draco Malfoy lounged on one of the couches in the common room, a book balanced on his stomach. He jumped when Harry and Luna walked into the room, his book hitting the floor with a dull thud. The blond boy didn't lean down to pick it up. He'd frozen like a frightened animal. Luna strode forward and scooped up the fallen book. She set the book back in the Slytherin's arms.
Harry scraped his finger over the edge of the batter bowl to snag a chocolate chip while Luna's back was turned. He hummed to himself, grinning at the taste of chocolate melting on his tongue. Luna blew on the mugs of hot cocoa that the Hogwarts elves brought them. She swept her blonde hair back behind her ears and offered Harry his mug.
“Remains to be seen. So, if you’re invited to tea then eventually, you’ll have to return the favor. Let’s go over how to serve tea in a slightly more formal setting than between school companions.”
“That’s sufficient to start. We’ll start first thing tomorrow and whatever I say goes. Do we have an arrangement?” He asked. Draco offered Harry a hand. An image flashed into his head of a much younger Malfoy on a train platform, a hand offered out to shake. A younger version of himself whipped his hand away, refusing whatever Draco had to offer. But he grasped Draco’s hand in a firm shake. He and the blond grinned at each other, “Then pleasure doing business with you.”
“My apologies, good morning professor.” Draco snorted. The man seemed equally amused by his performance.
Harry frowned, giving a wistful look at the setting sun, “Fine. A few more minutes. But don’t blame me if you end up in the hospital wing.” He rubbed his hands over Harry’s at the sight of the Gryffindor’s red fingers, “What are we going to say to McGonagall?” The Gryffindor’s rosy cheeks paled a fraction. He gulped, his hand stroking his throat in an absent tic, “Relax, when have you actually ever gotten in trouble with McGonagall?” Draco offered.
“Our doors will be open to you always, whether you need protection or not.” Harry let go. He bent down to retrieve the abandoned stick, as well as some of the other ones. Draco shook his head. He slid the stack out of Harry’s grasp, “Go find your Gryffindors. They’re probably worried about you.”
Harry’s eyes flashed behind his glasses. Lips flickering into a crooked smile, Harry let himself be dragged the rest of the way to the entrance to the Slytherin dorm without additional fuss. He leaned heavily against the figure behind him, taking in the mixing scents of heavily gelled hair and cologne. The arms nudged him upright again.
Not that he’d admit it to anyone, but he was beginning to miss the Gryffindor’s chatter. The two had played chess games almost every night that week, but he had a feeling it was no substitute for Harry’s conversations, “Mr. Malfoy, see Mr. Potter to the hospital wing.” The headmistress and transfigurations professor ordered.
“Both,” He said, glowing, “coming, Harry?” He asked. Harry nodded, stood, and laced his fingers through Draco’s.
“I’m teasing Potter. I’ve never been a good sport.” Draco offered, squeezing Harry’s shoulders. He settled the Gryffindor back to his side, so he’d lay back and rest. Harry hummed in agreement.
Harry woke up to clattering sound. There was enough noise and clamor, that he almost forgot he wasn’t in Gryffindor’s dorms any longer. He rolled out of bed and fumbled around until he found his glasses on the side table. Casting a quick tempus, he found it was almost dinner time. He’d somehow managed to sleep his afternoon away when he didn’t remember falling asleep in the first place.
"Don't go." Draco rolled his eyes. He wasn't even sure that the Gryffindor knew who he was, at all at the moment. But he couldn't stand to see him looking so pathetic. Tucking Harry's new boots and the parcel box beneath the bed, he climbed back onto the mattress with Harry. The dark-haired boy's fingers latched onto Draco's sweater, and before he knew it Potter was fast asleep. Draco sighed. He, once again, removed Harry's glasses. Stroking the boy's messy hair, Draco resigned himself to settle back into the pillows until Harry woke again.
“Luckily, I’m prepared for all situations,” Draco announced. He balanced the text between them and flipped through the pages. He slung his arm over Harry’s shoulders and pulled him closer.
"Sulking doesn't become you, Draco. That should buff out just fine, and if not here's the latest Gladrags catalog. Order a new pair." Picking at soggy shepherd's pie, Draco eyed the catalog Pansy slapped onto the tabletop between them. He sighed and paged through the glossy booklet. Maybe a new pair of shoes was exactly what he needed, after all.
"Because the Draco Malfoy I used to know wouldn't try to protect me. He wouldn't give me presents, flowers, or compliments either. It doesn't seem real." Draco squeezed Harry's shoulders, reminding Harry that the Slytherin at his side was real as anything. He pinched the bridge of his nose in a way that reminded Harry of their old potion's professor.
He scrounged up a burgundy waistcoat out of the pile, trading his green shirt for a white one. He slipped into the fitted burgundy trousers with a black stripe that ran down the side of his leg. Sliding on his black dress robes, he brushed them down and straightened everything before returning to Draco. The blond nodded, he held up a hand to signal Harry to turn. He turned, redder than the undertones in his waistcoat and trousers, “Now, if you really wanted to be civilized, I’d insist you switch out those boots for dress shoes, but I don’t want to push it.” Draco smirked, “Now take off the dress robe, we’re going to the front of the store.”
“If he tries to steal me away, I’m sure you could protect me,” Harry began. He chortled before managing to say, “Or at the very least, stage a kidnapping.”
“I’ll keep it to myself.” The man gave him a grateful smile as the room fell silent again only seconds before Draco burst through the door. He strolled over to their worktable, brows raising at the sight of the two sitting so close together.
"I'm sure it didn't mean it, Petal. Besides, I'm rather fond of the Giant Squid." Harry squirmed in Draco's hold. He turned himself around until he met the blond's gaze in the fading light, eyebrows furrowing.
“That’s not what happened, Mione,” He began, “He’s only been my boyfriend since the end of breakfast.” She giggled, returning to her reading. Ron was scribbling out his charms essay with a sullen look on his face. Harry was about to offer him a game of chess once he was finished when the Fat Lady turned to the inside of the common room.
“Good, now once you finish your tea, go put on something you think would be appropriate for a ball.” Harry groaned. He sunk lower into the cushion of his chair, savoring his tea. Agreeing to do whatever Draco said seemed less of a good idea by the moment, but he had to keep to his word. He downed his tea and slid back behind the curtains for a new outfit.
Harry set the parchment aside. The two played one round, then another. Draco muttered the occasional comment now and then that made Harry have to stifle his laughs from making the others, and a spell to rekindle the fire. Harry stayed otherwise silent, but the Slytherin found himself in awe of how much the Gryffindor could say without words at all. In the lifting of an eyebrow, the cocking of his head, and the pursing of his lips. By the end of the third game, their eyelids were drooping and the two offered each other soft smiles before reluctantly returning to their respective beds.
Draco wrapped the tie for his dressing gown tighter around his waist. He padded into the common room, stopping short at the sight of the fire crackling. Brushing the sleep out of his eyes, Draco peered around until his eyes settled on a shock of black hair poking out from the top of a squashy bean bag chair. The blond sighed, strode to his usual overstuffed armchair and sank into the cushion.
Harry gulped. He picked up the brush and began to attack the next of the cauldrons. Burying his head in his work, he tried to focus. But he felt the man's gaze settling on him. Despite the professor's cold tones, things had been less heated between them since Harry and invoked the Writ nearly a month before. But something struck Harry. Gathering his courage, Harry broke the silence in the room.
Harry hesitantly ordered one of his pawns to move forward in response. Blaise ordered the ruthless execution of that pawn. Pulling his knees into his chest, Harry told one of the pawns on the other side to make its move.
"Shameful, Potter, just shameful," A sleepy drawl started Harry out of his thoughts. He turned to see Draco propped up on his elbows, lines creasing his pale cheeks from the sheets, “swing those up here. I need to fix them." Harry nodded. He lifted his feet into Draco's reach and watched the blond's graceful ministrations on his laces, "Feeling better this morning?" Draco asked. His tongue poked between his thin lips in concentration.
“It’s just a little charm. It stops when you catch it.” The snitch floated way out of reach. It settled itself onto one of the high bookshelves like it was waiting for something. Shrugging, Harry bent down to gather the rest of the checkers. He and Luna raided the rest of the cookie tin while they waited for Draco to emerge from his dorm. The snitch was almost forgotten by the time the blond boy left his room.
"It's Umbridge. She's the threat." Snape's eyes darkened. The professor rested his chin in his hand, eyes far away.
“If I didn’t want to, I wouldn’t have offered,” He pointed out. Glancing around, Harry realized that no one seemed to care he was in the common room of Slytherin house. It was as if he’d been a part of their house all along, “Besides, if you’re going to be Slytherin then we need to get you better at strategy. Don’t we?” Biting his lip, Harry nodded and sat back to watch Blaise’s first move.
"I doubt that, Dragon. It was a threat much closer, something inside the castle." Draco's eyes narrowed. The flash of pink tweed crept back into his mind. Umbridge. He'd heard rumors of her detentions, and of course, Potter couldn't keep himself out of trouble for more than a day. He'd had at least one. Draco untangled himself from his uncle's hold and crept back over to Harry's bed.
Draco's nose wrinkled, not wanting his shirt to be mussed by whatever the Gryffindor stepped through last. He plucked the shoe out of Harry's fingers and shook his head. His pale skin flushed in the cool dusk air from the night chill and the efforts of keeping the other boy aloft.
“You’re late Potter,” Draco called. He held up a string of popcorn and cranberries, “Come help before Lovegood eats it all.” Harry smiled. He batted away the snitch and sat beside the other boy. Draco focused hard enough on his stringing that his pink tongue poked through his lips. Harry laughed. He handed Draco pieces of popcorn out of the bowl, sneaking a few cranberries here and there. Draco swatted his hand away from the bowl, “Just as bad as she is.”
“And James…My dad, helped you because he had to? Because he was acting as an emissary?” Harry asked. He watched Snape consider the question, as he poured the potion into vials with steady hands. The professor stoppered them one by one until he found his answer in a low tone.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes. He dumped the package on the boy's lap, "Go ahead," He watched Harry peel the paper back in a reverent way, even as his fingers quivered from the effort. It was only some brown paper, not even gift wrap. But it didn't seem to matter one bit to the Gryffindor. Draco ran his fingers through his hair, but quickly tired of watching the boy fumble with the parcel, "Shove over, Potter." Harry shifted, feeling the mattress dip beneath the blond's weight. Heat seeped into Harry's side when Draco's arm hooked around him. His larger hands steadied Harry's smaller ones. Nestling against the Slytherin, Harry managed to tug the package open. He lifted a piece of stiff parchment addressed to Draco. Brows furrowing, he read,
“Thanks,” He muttered, still staring at the opening. The professor dipped a pale hand into the depths of his robe and emerged with a vial. Offering it to Harry, he explained, “Essence of Dittany for your wrist. It will not make the message disappear because we’ll need that for evidence later. But it will take away the pain and chance of infection.”
"Uncle Sev, there has to be something you'll let Harry do. These aren't even complicated brews." Draco declared. He reached across the table to snatch up a knife and mandrake root to begin dicing it into neat, even pieces. He ignored his godfather's exasperation, burying his head into his work. Until the man massaged his temples, flicked his wand, and silently summoned a stack of filthy cauldrons from the opposite worktable. He appraised Harry with a single raised eyebrow. Waiting for him to complain or storm off, but Harry shrugged, lifted the brush, and began to scrub at the first of the cauldrons.
Harry nodded. The snake flicked his tongue uneasily. But it slithered back further in the frame and moments later the opening slid apart to allow them entry. They stumbled inside moments before the opening slammed shut behind them.
The steps groaned beneath them and Harry tightened his grip on Draco's hand, "I go down these steps at least once a week. Don't worry your pretty little head about them," The blond teased.
Draco threw back his blanket. He dressed and tugged his fingers through his hair before venturing back to the common room. Knowing that Potter never came back had kept him awake for what little sleep he could have gotten. He walked into the common room, ready for another outburst. But instead found Harry curled up on the stone floor in front of the enchanted window.
“This looks cozy,” He drawled. Draco rolled over, scrambled to his feet, and tucked himself under one of Snape’s arms, “It’s only been a few hours, Dragon.” The man muttered, but he returned the embrace to his nephew despite his complaints. He gave Harry a cool, warning gaze over the top of Draco’s head.
"Get my uncle in here, now," Draco commanded. He strode through the common room, getting himself and Harry Potter out of sight. Something had gone horribly wrong and he needed answers.
Approaching slowly, Draco cleared his throat to announce his presence. Harry whirled around, the scene fading behind him back to the lake.
A gentle mist of water flowed around his head. Freshly damp hair clung to his cheeks and the back of his neck. Draco’s fingers ran through the strands of hair, teasing out tangles. His buffed nails tickled Harry’s scalp in a way that made Harry melt. He let out a happy sigh, settling deeper into the chair.
“It was good to see you again, Severus,” Harry said, the young man’s tanned face was flushed pink through his cheeks.
Wishing he hadn’t begun this conversation, Harry swallowed down a dry lump in his throat, “I’ll spare you the details. But an incident occurred one full moon where I foolishly stumbled into a situation beyond my understanding, leaving me at James’s mercy. I asked for his help.”
Tentacles flapped in gratitude for the shoe in the Gryffindor's view. Harry gave a hesitant wave back, giving his regards to the Giant Squid.
“I’ll think about it. Please excuse me.” He stood up, grabbed his book, and rushed to his dorm. Harry and Luna watched him retreat. The door slammed shut, “I think you should tell him.” Harry shook his head, “Why not?”
“That’s for me to know, Potter. Now onto business, what skills do you think you lack to be a proper lord?” Harry fumbled his teacup, almost dropping it on the thick carpet beneath his feet, “Other than a certain lack of grace.” Setting aside the teacup, he laced his fingers together until his knuckles were white.
“Are they going to get in trouble for all of this?” He asked, a hand pressing against the glass. Snape snorted behind him.
Surprise! I was only planning on this being a one-shot story, but I felt a little inspired by the comments to expand it. So, here's a bonus ficlet for you all. Hope you enjoy and are staying safe out there!
"It would seem that Potter has unwittingly invoked an ancient Hogwarts writ. The Writ of House Protection. When a student is in danger and they request help from a member of another house, they are admitted to the house until the time that the threat is neutralized."
Draco fished a cookie out of the tin. He dunked the cookie into his hot cocoa before taking a big bite. Harry grinned before doing the same. Luna didn’t even glance up from her notebook, but she did summon her snack to enjoy while she wrote.
With their common room being in the dungeon, the Slytherins didn’t get natural light as the other houses did. Someone had put up an ornate mirror with a spell that gave it the appearance of a window. It was often the lake or other parts of the castle grounds, but it could be made to show anything. Potter’s hand rested on the glass over the current image of the quidditch pitch. The pennants rippled on a gentle breeze. A tiny flash of gold flitted around, making Draco smile. He’d never seen the mirror display the golden snitch before.
“Indeed, I know you’re stressed but it’s no excuse for disappearing on me,” Draco mumbled, pressing his face against Harry’s shoulder. He nestled into his Gryffindor boyfriend’s side, “You know if you need help, you only have to ask for it, don’t you?” He asked. His nimble fingers tugged on the sloppily tied Gryffindor tie around Harry’s neck.
Draco hadn’t imagined that the writ would take the protection of the house so far as to lock Harry inside the dorms. Of course, it made protecting him from Umbridge easier if Potter couldn’t leave. They only had to protect Potter from himself. Rolling his eyes, he snatched one of Harry’s wrists before it could slam into the barrier again.
“We’ve got to do something about that snitch.” Draco nodded. He stood up to go retrieve the popcorn off the floor before the elves could scold them for making a mess.
He caught the reflection of Snape sweeping back over to the table, his conversation finished. The man cuffed the back of Draco's head, having caught him in the act of snooping. Draco flushed sheepishly. He rubbed the back of his head, "Who was it, Uncle?"
“But Draco-” The name slipped out of Harry’s mouth before he realized what he was saying. The blond eyes flashed, a cheeky grin on his face.
“Good evening sleeping beauty, I wondered when you were going to grace us with your presence again.” Draco teased his fingers through a sleep mussed cowlick near the back of Harry’s neck, “You’ll find we’ve been busy.” Harry gently shook off the blond and stared at Slytherins’ handiwork.
Harry gnawed on his bottom lip. He really hadn’t considered his classes. He hadn’t considered much of anything when he agreed to Malfoy’s bet. People never accused him of thinking before he rushed into anything. It wouldn’t be difficult to convince his professors that he had a sore throat for a day or two, but any longer than that and it would raise suspicions. If he made it that long to be an issue. Being quiet wasn’t as difficult as he thought, but Draco Malfoy’s banter made it hard to resist.
“Merlin Potter, never scare me like that again.” Harry nodded, even when it made his head ring. He squeezed Draco back and shoved over to make space for him on the narrow hospital bed. The blond hesitated for a second before clambering onto the bedside him.
After cooling off for an hour or two, Harry returned to the great hall. He found Draco and Luna sorting through boxes of ornaments that the elves left out for them. The snitch perched on Draco’s shoulders. It sputtered back to life when Harry walked in and twirled around his messy hair.
It swirled around, roiling beneath the surface to reveal the common room. Grinning, Harry pulled over one of the stools. He grimaced at the squeals of its stoppers over the stone floor. Harry scrambled on, transfixed by what he saw on the other side. Draco, Blaise, and the other Fifth years stood with their backs against the wall. Draco right in front of the tapestry, to block Umbridge’s path if she made it that far.
"You wish," He mumbled into the material covering his legs. Draco snorted. He reached over and hooked Harry's chin in his hand. Giving soft tug, until the Gryffindor had no choice but to meet his gaze. Harry found warm grey eyes staring into his.
“I wouldn’t do something like that. I know everyone else isn’t convinced, but I don’t have a death wish.” He insisted.
Draco hadn’t mentioned that the dinner invitation was from Severus Snape. Harry tugged on the hem of his green sweater, the one that Draco insisted he wore because it brought out his eyes. He sat in the parlor next to Draco, waiting for their host to return with tea for them.
He turned on his heel and stalked back to his bed. Tossing his blanket over his head, he tried to block out the enchanted light. Leave it to Potter to ask for his help, then act like Draco had taken him prisoner. Stewing in his thoughts, he listened for the door opening. For Potter to stop being so stubborn and come back to the room. He never did.
Harry's grey sock squelched against the pebbles of the rock beach. He grimaced, staring down at his one remaining trainer. A puddle of lake water pooled around him. Sighing, he watched the tentacle of the giant squid wave mockingly back at him. Harry's shoe dangled off one of its suction cups by a pair of grubby laces. The squid shot a single spray of ink, splattering across Harry's glasses before dipping back beneath the water's surface.
The Gryffindor cocked his head to the side, warily examining the offering. Draco rolled his eyes. He flicked his wand, wordlessly flipping the cloth into Harry's face. Harry squawked, he tore the kerchief out of his face and glared at Draco. Huffing, he wiped the ink residue off his face. The pure white cloth stained grey with the grime. Nose crinkling, Draco banished it from Harry's fingers before he could think of offering it back.
Harry swung his legs over the end of the bed, eyes swimming from the effects of the squid ink and the mist building in the corners of his eyes. He stared down at the brand-new boots and kicked them back and forth.
“I will ensure she is relinquished to the proper authorities. All of this needs to be cleaned up by the time I return,” He warned, before sweeping out of the room.
"Pull up a stool, Potter." Harry scampered across the room to retrieve his stool and placed it beside his professor, "I'm sure you're aware I attended school with your parents and their friends?" Harry nodded. Fumes from the bubbling potion fogged his lenses, but his eyes were wide behind the glasses, "And that your mother and I grew up together?" Harry shook his head. His mouth fell open, but he clammed shut again in case the man decided not to continue, "Yes, well that is a story for another time, perhaps." His usual piercing gaze seemed far away through the haze of the bubbling potion, "Bring me some of those vials and stoppers from the table," He said.
Harry started when the common room entrance slid open and Snape appeared in the opening. He took in the sight of Draco sprawled next to Harry’s side, the two sharing Draco’s charms book. A dark eyebrow raised.
“For the record Potter,” He rolled over to face Harry, “what happens in the dungeon stays here. Even when you return to Gryffindor, got it?” Harry nodded. It wasn’t like anyone would believe him anyway if he told them that Draco Malfoy liked to cuddle. Before he could say anything else, a little house elf popped into the common room carrying a tray of food.
He scooped them up and carried them between the tables. The potion hissed when his professor added them into the hot liquid of the next cauldron, “My godson is dawdling, I’m sure. You might as well make yourself useful grinding some dried lavender.” He pointed out the mortar and pestle on the edge of the worktop. Harry nodded. He took special care to grind it down to a consistent, fine powder.
“Dumbledore or Lupin?” He asked. His tone and expression unreadable. The Gryffindor swallowed before he gathered the courage to respond.
“Thank you, though I believe at this point in your life I’m not your professor. Severus would suffice.” Harry’s eyes went wide behind his glasses, but he nodded stiffly.
Harry yelped, but fingers clamped across his lips to stifle his cries. He twisted and thrashed against the hold. All he managed to do was kick up some of the layers of dust. Sputtering behind the hand, Harry’s stinging eyes watered. His potions textbook slipped from his fingers. It fell with a bang to the flagstones beneath them.
Harry jumped at the sudden intrusion. The Gryffindor’s usually unruly hair was wilder than normal from sleep, but Draco noted his eyes were glassy and red around the edges.
"Potter, why in Merlin's name do you only have one shoe?" Draco's nose wrinkled at the sight of the grey, dripping sock. Harry gripped the back of his neck, flushing at the state of his appearance.
"Fine, I'm not going to dislodge you," Giving Harry's legs another squeeze, Draco carried him the last bit of the way to the lake shore before setting his Gryffindor down on one of the boulders. He scrambled up next to Harry, hooking an arm around him. Draco's chin rested on Harry's cowlicks. He swung Harry's legs over his until the chilly Gryffindor was practically in his lap, "What do you think of that sunset?" Harry sighed happily, curling deeper into Draco's side. His gaze traveled over the lake, where an eruption of bubbles spouted across the glassy surface.
“Draco,” Luna broke the comfortable silence in the room, “we’re helping the elves decorate the tree in tomorrow. Would you like to join us?” Draco’s eyes widened. Most of the eighth years decided to let go of the past. No one was unkind to him to his face, but he wasn’t often invited to events.
“I’m sorry too,” The dark-haired boy opened his mouth to continue, but before he had a chance Professor Snape strode into the common room.
"Merlin Potter, do you ever stop talking? I bet you couldn't keep your mouth shut if you tried." Draco let his textbook slam shut. Unlike the Slytherin common room, the eighth-year dorms were always loud, and it seemed like Potter was always to blame for the noise. If it wasn't Potter then it was a member of his fan club, so he was equally responsible for that nonsense even if he wasn't directly involved in it, as far as Draco was concerned. How was he supposed to get any done?
"Where?" Nose wrinkling when Draco shook his head, "Is this one of those times where it's not actually a surprise? Where you're just not telling me because you think I wouldn't come if I knew?" Draco smirked. He put his free hand against his heart in feigned hurt over Harry's words. But he pressed his curled lips together, doubling his pace down the hall and dragging Harry behind him, "Don't play innocent. That's exactly what this is."
“Open it,” he ordered. Harry snorted, “For the record, it’s not my fault the password was changed and no one bothered to inform me.” Rolling his eyes, Harry leaned forward to whisper in parseltongue to the snake in the portrait.
“Correction, Scarface. It just grows back if you don’t like the cut, and that was accidental magic. You’re not a little boy anymore, you’re one of the most powerful wizards in Britain. Let’s make you look like it.” Harry gulped but nodded his head. He didn’t have much of a choice. Draco would get his way, one way or another. Stiffening, he felt his glasses slide off his nose. Everything blurred. Harry shivered, he shook his head and reached out for his glasses.
“For everyday use, and because I’ve got the day robe on it’s appropriate to wear if I’m invited to a daytime event like a tea.” Draco nodded, sipped his tea, and placed the set back on the table.
“Very funny Potter, did you forget I was a seeker too?” Harry shook his head. The snitch hadn’t settled. Luna said it would stop when it was caught. But it hadn’t stopped. Draco let the golden ball go. It darted back around him before perching on his shoulder like a bird, “What kind of snitch is this?” Harry shrugged.
He gently turned the blanket back, reaching down for the brunet's wrist. The one he'd been protecting and curled around when Draco found him in the hallway. Bringing it into the light, he felt his stomach turn at the sight of a set of raw cuts across the back of the other boy's hand. In Potter's messy scrawl the message
Harry had just convinced the black set of the wizard’s chess pieces to play him when footsteps padded down the hall toward the common room. Muffled voices carried to his ears. The rest of Slytherin house was waking up for the morning, funneling toward the common room. From what Harry gathered from Draco, none of them would be surprised to see him. Most of them had witnessed when Draco dragged him into the room. Harry flushed, ordering one of his pawns to attack one of its rivals.
“Knock it off, Potter. It’s too early for this.” Harry froze. He whirled around from the wall with his eyes wild. The boy’s fists were curled at his side, nails digging into his palm.
Harry's eyelids fluttered. A dull ache throbbed through his skull. He groaned, yanking the familiar starchy hospital wing bedding over his head. Madam Pomfrey bustled over to his bed. She tutted, dimming the lights in the room to a soft glow that wouldn't be so harsh on the Gryffindor's eyes. Two glasses of potions clinked against each other, sloshing the potions inside them. Harry gagged at their scents, swallowing down the stale air in his throat before he dared to emerge from the blankets.
“Of course, it’ll be good practice for your lessons to try to behave in polite company.” Harry’s shoulders drooped. His gaze fell to the toes of his boots. Right, even being asked to dinner was purely business. He didn’t know why it bothered him so much, but it did. He swallowed a lump in his throat and dragged his gaze up to catch Draco smirking, “I’ll be by at 6:00 to help you choose your outfit and fix your hair.” Harry rolled his eyes, but with one look at Draco’s wide eyes, he nodded.
I definitely wrote this instead of sleeping, but I hope you all enjoy this silly, little bonus ficlet anyway. There may be more eventually 🤷 Let me know if you'd all be interested in that...
“I’ll tell the others tonight.” He gently lifted Harry’s sleeping form into his arms and moved to his feet, “I’m going to put him in his bed. See you later, Uncle.” Snape watched Draco maneuver himself and Potter back to their room, shaking his head. A soft smile crept on the corners of his lips before he turned and billowed out of the room.
When I woke up I was alone in my room. Well at least there were no humans in my room. In the furthest corner of my bedroom there was a big shadow. Its red eyes looked directly at me and its mouth was full of sharp teeth. It leered at me and I thought on its teeth there were traces of blood. It licked its lips and continued staring at me. I could feel its breath on my face even though it was relatively far away. I stared at it for some time, too scared to move but eventually I stood up slowly because its breath seemed to become ragged as if it lusted after my flesh. Well the blood on its teeth said everything. I slowly started walking to the door of my room. While I walked the breath of the creature got louder and it seemed to be coming towards me. As fast as I could I stormed out of the room feeling the grasp of it brush me. That was really close. The creature didn’t follow me out of the room though.
Harry couldn't. He finally got his pyjamas on and was starting to get up, but was immediately stopped by the Slytherin's hand that landed on his shoulder.
Draco just stared at him for a while until a tiny, uneasy smile appeared on his lips too. "Uh... thanks, Harry", he said.
Harry's dominating tone was making Draco furious. He instantly stopped walking and turned around, staring at the other man venomously.
"Well, as long as she'll behave, she can stay", Harry said to Ron. "I don't want anyone to ruin our day."
"If I could take everything back, I really would, you know", Draco continued. "If I had a chance to go back, I would never join Voldemort. I would fight by your side."
"You do know what they say?" she had said. "Once a cheater, always a cheater. I wish you luck with that."
They kissed again, and Draco's heart was filled with love and joy. Only an hour ago he had thought he had lost everything, and now... Merlin, he couldn't be happier.
They soon entered the train, Harry on the lead and Draco right after, walking along the long train aisle.
Harry didn't answer. Instead he let out a little laugh. He noticed that his voice had gotten a little raspy because there was so much noise and they'd had to talk so loudly to hear each other speak that night. There were still so many customers before him that he'd have to wait for at least few minutes more before being served. And of course now he was stuck waiting with Malfoy, the man he had fallen for…
Harry was left alone, staring at the wall with blank face. He didn't know what to do with his relationship with Ginny. He had hurt Ginny very badly and he felt terrible about it. He had never wanted to hurt anyone...
Draco shook his head. "No... At first I was thinking of visiting Azkaban during the Christmas break and telling him in person but I don't know how he'll take the news, so..."
The Slytherin's grey eyes were looking deep into his own. "Fuck me, Harry. I want you so much", the blond breathed.
"Fine. No talking then", Harry answered, tightening his grip around the Slytherin. Silence fell over.
Harry was looking at the picture with a blank face. He remembered when Hermione had taken that photo of him and Ginny. They had still been so happy during those days.
His mind was immediately filled with Malfoy's full, soft, but still so powerful lips kissing him clumsily and those stormy grey eyes looking deep into his soul afterwards... Oh god,
Ginny was staring at him for a while, her brown eyes flaring. Harry was waiting for a snap or a slap to his face, but he definitely didn't expect what happened next.
Harry had gotten a lot of nice presents from his friends and the Weasleys and while Draco didn't have as many presents as Harry, they were a lot more expensive than his. Draco had soon went through his own presents and just sat there on the couch, observing Harry as he still had two last presents left.
"Honestly, I don't even know what to say, other than... thank you, Draco. I love it", he said with a gentle smile.
The other man shrugged, lowering his gaze. "I don't know... There are many reasons... I've been an arse to you ever since we were kids... You've always been after girls, not guys... You're the man who killed Voldemort, so you could have anyone... Why would you want
It didn't take long until they both were already naked except their still remaining underpants. Harry was moving his lips everywhere on Draco's beautiful upper body, loving the view and scent. He was sucking and biting on the Slytherin's neck, this time without a doubt leaving marks on it. He was licking and sucking Draco's nipples and kissing Draco's chest, moving his lips and tongue along the scars. The Slytherin was gasping and moaning under him all the time, his body trembling with want.
"Be my guest", Malfoy said, showing no intention of leaving. He leaned back on his chair, throwing back his head and stretching his arms, eyes closed.
Harry sighed heavily. "I'm sorry, Ginny. I never thought that things would go this way... It's just that I've been thinking about this a lot and... God, I don't even know how to say it. I don't want to hurt you, but I also need to be honest with you, and you'll hear about it soon enough anyway." He paused to take a breath after babbling for so long. This was so hard...
Harry hadn't known that it would be possible for him to fall even more for Draco, but that moment proved that he had been so wrong. Harry felt warm and safe in the Slytherin's arms, and he wished that he would never have to leave. He wanted to stay nestled in the other man's arms like this forever.
An hour passed since Ginny had left and it was already midnight, but still neither of them seemed to have any intention to leave the room just yet. They still hadn't said a word to each other, either. Harry had to admit that it was starting to feel a bit annoying since the same thing happened almost every night. Why was it like this? They used to argue and mock each other all the time in the past, and now it seemed like they didn't have anything to say to each other anymore. Harry wasn't afraid of Malfoy or anything, but he just didn't know what to talk with him about. However, this was their final school year and after that they wouldn't probably ever see each other again, so perhaps it didn't even matter.
They spent a long time just caressing and kissing each other, until they decided to go and take a shower.
And that was the last thing they said to each other that night. It didn't take long before Malfoy already fell asleep in Harry's arms, face resting against his chest, but Harry himself was unable to fall asleep so soon.
"Better give you what you want then", he breathed against Malfoy's ear after their lips parted again, moving his lips to the Slytherin's neck instead. Malfoy smelled and tasted so good and his skin was smooth like silk against his lips. He couldn't get enough of this man, he could just eat him up. He wanted to touch and feel him in every way possible.
"You break it, you buy it, Potter." A voice broke the silence behind him. The hairs stood up on the back of Harry's neck. Harry snapped his hand back from the teacup like someone smacked it. He whirled around to face none other than Draco Malfoy. Eyes wide, he took in the blond. They hadn't seen each other since they left Hogwarts three years ago. Draco looked taller, dressed in pinstripe trousers and a matching waistcoat. The rolled-up sleeves of his white shirt were crispy pressed, "Is there something I can do for you, Potter?"
Harry shook his head fast enough that some of the excess cream sprayed out of his hair. Draco grimaced, wiping the flecks off his cheeks.
“Some of that jasmine tea and a tin of those biscuits you brought me last month.” Draco turned to Harry who was still squirming on the countertop. Deciding to give him a little reprieve, he said,
“Honestly Harry, you should be more excited than anyone else that Umbridge is gone,” Hermione began while spreading jam across a piece of toast. He shrugged and picked at his breakfast. Owls swooped from overhead to deliver packages and copies of the Daily Prophet that would be splattered with stories about Umbridge, no doubt. But an unmarked letter from an owl Harry didn’t recognize fell into his lap.
“Just do it.” The hands left his shoulders after one final squeeze. Harry listened to the clip of Draco’s shoes against the tile floor. A clatter of metal and plastic carried to his ears, though he tried not to think about it. He squinted to try to make out what Draco was doing, but beyond the blur of blond hair he couldn’t make out anything. Closing his eyes, he leaned back and waited.
Draco stared down at the hunched form of Harry Potter, sprawled across the stones of the dungeon floor. His eyes narrowed, flicking back and forth for signs of anyone else in the hall. But Potter was alone. The dark-haired boy was clutching his wrist and shaking like a leaf.
Draco rolled his eyes. He dropped onto the bench beside Harry, leaning over to mutter something low in his ear. Harry flushed. He resisted the urge to burrow his face into his arms on the table. A daisy petal drifted from the crown. It tickled Harry's nose until he sneezed. Draco smirked. He leaned forward to brush the petal off of Harry's face, "Make a wish," He drawled, balancing the little petal out on his finger. Harry rolled his eyes but obeyed before leaning back against Draco. His green eyes flickered around the hall at all the eyes staring back at them.
“I’m in the process of acquiring your school bag and your other things, but it will take time as everything has to be clandestine. That melon-colored medusa is incessant on tracking you down.” Harry shivered, tightening his grip on the pillow. Draco caught sight of the shift. He slipped from his uncle’s embrace and joined Harry back on the floor. Untangling Harry’s hands from the cushion, he gave them a soft squeeze,
Somehow the thought amuses Harry even though he probably shouldn't be amused in a situation like this. “I...I didn’t try to kill myself! Well at least not intentionally...I just tried to...I just didn’t want to see them anymore...I...the Kamala was...it was whispering to me again, standing right behind me the whole day and it...I think it drove me crazy. Its gone now though. At least for the moment.”
“Why did you-?” “How are you-?” They stop for a second unsure. In the end Harry slips on the bed to sit beside Draco and slowly takes one of his hands in his to caress it. “Go first…” He mumbles silently. Draco takes a little breath and then starts again. “I just wanted to ask you how you are doing...I mean now that im not with you everyday anymore. Well cant be.” Harry starts smiling, surprised. “You're the one who tried to kill himself and you're worried about me?”
Only later after he leaves his session and is on his way to Draco to eat with him does the thought struck him. Dracos Kamala could help.
It seemed to work. A small smile appeared on his pale lips. “A cupboard? I think I got a few things wrong about your childhood.” He said still smiling the bite from our time at school still not present. Was this even the Draco Malfoy I met at Hogwarts? I didn’t really think so. We were still looking and smiling at each other when Mary approached us. “Hey, you two sorry to interrupt but your family is here Harry.” She said smiling at us. I threw one last glance at Draco before standing up. He smiled at me one last time before his gaze swayed over to the Pond again. “Ill see you at group therapy Harry.” He said. I smiled at him even though he couldn’t see it and turned to Mary who was watching us interact, smiling. “Where do I meet them?” I asked her and she led me to a room I wasn’t in before.
Hermione interrupted me again. “Harry we will do all that. Nothing is going to happen to your house because we will take care of it okay?” I looked at all the people in the room and everyone looked at me seriously and nodded. Everyone except Ginny. She never really talked to me since the war, since I ended our relationship even though I explained to her why I did it. And after the war I couldn’t just return to normal because everything that happened was just so…it just made everything different. I was different. Ginny was different too. I looked at her while she kept looking down, completely ignoring my presence in the room. Even though she didn’t talk to me she was always there when Hermione and the Weasley family visited me. I couldn’t make sense out of it. Maybe she thought I would change my mind and we could be together again I didn’t know. I nodded to myself and sat down on the Couch nearest the window. Just like Draco always did. I wiped over my eyes to get rid of the tears before they could escape. Hermione and Ron sat down beside me and Molly and Arthur sat down across from me.
“I think these were enough questions for today. Draco must still be exhausted. I want you to write an essay about the things Draco told you and your theories on how the syndrome works. Also you may include your thoughts on how to deal with the syndrome and maybe even how to heal it.” Then Draco heard footsteps shuffle out of his bedroom again and then there was silence. Finally I was alone. Now after a whole week he could see Harry again.
When I woke up I wasn’t alone. I opened my eyes slowly and sat up. A white blond head was lying next to me. Draco. What was he doing here? Why was he lying beside me? When my mind came into full consciousness and I remembered what had happened the night before I was all over Draco immediately.  He seemed to be ok. At least he wasn’t bleeding anymore and he didn’t seem to be in pain. Draco slept peacefully. I watched him for a little bit. All my worries from last night slowly poured out of me and though I couldn’t get rid of them completely at least at this moment they were out of my mind. While I was trapped in my thoughts I didn’t notice that Draco woke up. I only noticed it when I heard him chuckle. I looked up and our eyes met. His eyes were full of life again, the dullness from yesterday were gone. I smiled at him when I noticed he smiled at me too. “How...When did you get in here?” I asked him. “Must have been after midnight...I think...I don’t really know. I wasn’t feeling so good and I everywhere were these monsters again so Itward showed me the way here. Come on it should be time for breakfast any moment now.” He sat up and stretched. I stood up from the bed and started to get my clothes to get dressed. We started getting dressed in silence when something came to my mind. “Where is Lockhart? I didn’t notice before but shouldn’t he be here?” I asked Draco suddenly curious. He started laughing shortly and as he did I noticed again how he wasn’t the same person as in Hogwarts anymore. “Lockhart is not here anymore. They shipped him to America because they have a ward there specifically for memory loss through accidents like these. I don’t know the name of it anymore though.” I nodded along as he spoke and waited for him while he finished dressing. Mary must have put his clothes here. “Come on Harry lets go to breakfast. You should eat before your first appointment.” Draco said as he grabbed my wrist and led me to the dining room.
Each time, the hollow in his chest overflowed with that blazing fire.  But Malfoy never seemed to shrink back, burning just as brightly.
It didn’t matter how many times he re-potted his hydrangeas, or how many hopeless letters he sent to Ginny.  For once in his life, Harry was tired of being the Saviour.
The routine they’d built was teasingly familiar.  Harry let out the breath he’d been holding when he saw those familiar legs.
.” Malfoy’s shaking fist pushed at Harry’s chest half-heartedly.  His head dropped to Harry’s chest and his shoulders shook as he wrung himself out onto Harry’s shirt.
“I know.  But it wasn’t yours either.” Malfoy stared up at Harry, draped over the toilet with his cheek pressed against the seat.  His eyes slipped to half moons and his lips slipped into a predatory smirk.  Harry felt hot under his collar.
So he slipped into the backroom and swore it was for the sake of comfort.  There really was something soothing about the sound of leaking taps and gusts of wind rattling the half open window.
“It must be hard, huh Potter?  Playing Saviour all the time.” Malfoy spat a bloody mess into the toilet and trembled when he pulled himself up onto his feet.
“I don’t know what you’re playing at Malfoy, but I’m not entertaining it.” Harry thought he saw a flash of fear in Malfoy’s eyes at the deathly quiet hiss.
Add in the sounds of his slick hand working over feverish flesh and his throaty gags and Harry was glowing with a deep flush he couldn’t pass off as firewhisky buzz.
Did he go out like this every night, in the hopes that Harry would show up?  Or did he finish every night with a different man?  Whisper with the same sultry tone in their ears?
The only time Harry appreciated waking up to an empty bed was when he jolted upright in the pitch black darkness of midnight, soaked in sweat and panting with the imagined heat.
“Hmm... don’t forget to breathe.” And then Malfoy’s tongue was pressed flat against Harry’s cock.  He dragged it up the length, following an obscene vein bulging at the side.
Usually memories of the war would make him break down into fits of anxious breathing, but he was too exhausted that night.
.  Absolutely ridiculous, complete meaningless panic.  The fire was a thousand apparition points away, safely locked away in a dusty corner of Hogwarts.
Despite his best efforts, Harry never managed to finish his final year at Hogwarts.  McGonagall had owled him about condensed courses, but Harry and everyone at the Battle of Hogwarts had already been offered spots in the Auror trainee program.
Malfoy suddenly broke down into a round of hacking coughs and his head jolted to shove against the lip of the toilet.  Harry grimaced at the scrape of nails across ceramic when Malfoy let out one last dreadful wretch.
“We all paid a price to keep living, Malfoy.” Harry wished he could show Malfoy how much of himself he’d given.  Malfoy’s face dropped and he rubbed at his eyes with his knuckles.  He’d clearly had a bit too much to drink.
He wasn’t disappointed.  It was the man from before, wearing jeans torn at the knees, kneeling and showing off a substantial amount of that same salivating ivory skin.
“You’re— you’re a fucking prick.” Malfoy coughed out in what was more of a laugh than a reprimand, sprawling back on his ass onto the dirty floor.
Malfoy had a firestorm trapped in his lungs and each whispered question threatened to set Harry ablaze.  He kissed a soft mark into Harry’s chin, scratchy with stubble.  Harry’s breath caught at the heat that radiated from Malfoy tenfold.
Harry hadn’t gone back to the dance-floor that night.  He’d tumbled out of the window and stumbled far enough away from the privacy wards to apparate home.
“Harry.  Mate.  C’mon, snap out of it.” Ron snapped his fingers between Harry’s eyes.  Harry refused to let this be the thing that broke his carefully crafted patience, even though Ron had just broken his coffee mug,
Before Harry had a chance to work out the answers, a hedonistic moan echoed through the empty lavatory.  Another followed soon after, but Harry barely even noticed.  The echo bouncing off the stone walls was haunting.
“Do you know what happens when you breathe in ash from an eternal flame?  My lungs are covered in that filth.  My voice box was ripped apart by the smoke, whatever the healers managed to salvage is far from flawless.” Harry could hear it now.  Malfoy’s voice crackled on certain syllables as if his vocal chords grated against themselves to produce the sound.
“M-my my Auror Potter!  Using brute force against an innocent civilian.  Whatever happened to upholding the law?” For his part, Malfoy barely stumbled before laughing and leaning back against the table.  His hands were still handcuffed behind his back but he’d changed his height and presence into something absurdly confident.
It was a habit he’d picked up after the war, something that never managed to be any less embarrassing.  It was uncharacteristic; there’d been no time for panic during the war.  That’s what got you killed.
How similar his deep tone sounded to the grainy desperate scratch his voice had after he’d sucked cock.
The cinnamon in Neville’s cologne and the sriracha soaking into his chips mixed to create a pungent spiciness that almost rivalled the sharpness of fiendfyre.  No matter how ridiculous the combination, it still dredged up memories of ashen blood coating hands and cheeks.
The coughing was more akin to rasping and the man’s groan rumbled in Harry’s chest.  Low and long, impossibly deep and just husky enough to send a jolt up Harry’s spine.
Even with Malfoy’s slight height, he seemed frailer and weaker.  Harry dropped his hands to Malfoy’s waist and held him with light fingers like he was something dangerous.
He knew he should’ve slammed open his stall door and walked out as fast as his legs could carry him the moment he saw a second pair of shoes.  But the sliver of the man’s smooth thighs on display along with his increasingly desperate moans had Harry damn near charmed to the toilet seat.
“Well... you wouldn’t let me go.” Malfoy’s eyes were dark and fierce.  Harry went a bit crazy for a second.
“I want to hear you.” Harry’s voice came out strained and pleading, but Malfoy didn’t think twice before letting out a long chain of wet, harsh gurgles.
Harry shrugged. He closed his mouth with a soft smirk. His green eyes flashed behind the lenses of his glasses. Snitching a scrap of parchment from Granger's notebook, Harry scribbled something on the paper before tossing it at Draco. The blond caught the paper between two fingers. A manicured eyebrow rose, but he unfolded the scrap and squinted to decipher Potter's horrible scrawl.
"What happened to you?" Draco asked. Harry didn't respond, beyond a soft whimper that slipped out of his lips. Crouching down to the other boy's level, Draco carded hair away from Harry's face, "Potter?" The boy stiffened beneath his touch, curling tighter around his injured hand.
“Now, this is something I never expected to see.” Snape drawled. Harry shivered through the thin material of his dress shirt, “Good morning, Draco, Lord Potter.” Harry swallowed. He nodded at the old potion’s professor. A swift cuff knocked into the back of Harry’s head. Cringing, Harry nursed the spot that Draco smacked. He grimaced and turned back to Draco. The blond crossed his arms across his chest.
"My apologies, I'm not trying to mock you, really." He leaned over to the flip-up part of the counter and opened it for Harry, "Come to the back room and we'll chat over some tea." Harry shuffled after Draco, his hands stuffed in his pockets. They walked through a doorway with a hanging curtain of beads. The beads swung back and forth, clacking in Harry's ears. He snatched his glasses off his nose to wipe off the fog building up into the lenses from the warmth in the room. Shoving them back on his nose, he peered around the cozy little tearoom.
"It's okay Malfoy, it was just the elves. They brought us a snack." Harry snatched one of the tins, prying the lid open to reveal its brimming contents. He passed Draco a mug and offered him the tin, “Luna and I made them earlier.”
“Stop it. Look down at your robes if you need reminding, but this is your house for the time being. Hogwarts’s magic wants you here, so you’re not going anywhere.” Harry snapped his wrist out of Draco’s grasp, but his hands fell to his sides. One of his hands fiddled with the green material poking out of his sleeve. His toes curled against the icy stone floor. Draco brushed a piece of blond hair out of his face, “You had a rough night, you should go back to sleep for at least a little while.” Harry shook his head, “Suit yourself, I’m going back to bed.”
