“Yeah,” says Draco. “Minister Granger it is.”
Potter looks at him, too.
Harry had taken his shirt off as soon as they arrived back at the room—it was ruined, anyway, ripped and stained with blood—and the air is thick, humid with steam from the hot water Malfoy filled the bathtub with. He winces as Malfoy pulls a long, thin piece from a deep laceration in his forehead, and Malfoy rinses the tweezers with more alcohol. Harry feels very calm.
“Draco, don’t be boring. I am never off base.”
On the north side of the property he runs into a familiar face leaning against a post, smoking. Charlie Weasley waves him over.
Two fingers, then three, and they are both trembling and breathing hard. Draco’s cock drags along Harry’s lower back as he moves. “Potter,” he says. “
Potter smiles, and for a moment Draco forgets to inhale. He is filled in with all the things he wants with Potter, he is messy and distinctly entangled.
Greg comes close, squinting, and writes down the listing number. He smells like Doritos and sticky lemon-lime fizz.
Harry touches his fingers to Draco’s wrist. Draco can feel the warmth of him, all up his body where they are nearly pressed together, sitting side by side on the low stone wall of the patio.
“Of course it is,” Hermione says finally.
Malfoy steps off the old flagstones and bends down, running the tips of his fingers through the newly-turned soil. “Do you have a plan for these open areas?”
“I recommended him. I told you he could be trusted,” Regulus insists.
Guido shoots him a
“No.” Blaise drops the slight sense of constant deflection he usually has about him. It was only after knowing Blaise for a long time that he had come to understand how seldom anyone sees him completely serious. “Not then, and not now. I don’t begrudge any bit of happiness between my friends.”
There’s a catch in Draco’s throat, but he swallows around it and whispers, again, “Remember what?”
“Well, goodnight then.” Potter nods, and Draco turns to go, then pauses. “Maybe I should mention,” he says, glancing at the window. “There’s a ghost that comes around sometimes. There.” He gestures at the back garden.
“No, no, I know. It’s fine. I’d like to avoid that, if you please. Don’t tell her I’m here until Greengrass is gone, alright?”
He only kills dark wizards, of course. He is a fully licensed Hit Wizard with a mandate from the Wizengamot, and he’s on the
The ghost is a man; a boy, really, probably a teenager when he died. He’s wearing clothing from a much older time period— breeches and a rough homespun coat. He doesn’t look like anyone. Not Lucius, or the woman who died in the fire. Not Draco himself, or any of the ghosts he carries along with him, the ones of his own making.
Tom Evers is locking up the door at the base of the lighthouse when Draco arrives. His thick, dark hair is curling against the collar of his shirt, like he’s gone too long without a haircut.
“Wait,” Harry says. “Not yet. I’m not going anywhere. I’m staying right here, as usual.”
“But why would they target Harry?” Weasley asks. “He’s definitely not one of them. Everyone knows that. And why bomb it before Harry arrived, anyway?”
“A no-fly net,” says Weasley. “We’ve lowered it so he doesn’t try to come up off the ground at all and make his wing injuries worse. Ah, here he comes,” he says, pointing at the building.
“He’s not here tonight?”
This is the closest thing he’s ever seen to magic made visible, the way the bees ride the flow of that mysterious force within him. Like schools of fish deep in the ocean, making hidden currents visible to the eye. His bees rode the waves and eddies of his magic, soaked it in, delighted in it. There could be nothing bad about it, nothing truly wrong with Harry himself, if these delicate, astonishing creatures loved it so much.
“Correct?” Malfoy’s voice was high and loud, his face growing red. “It was foolish and—“
“Well done.” Harry beams, slightly out of breath. Draco can feel Harry’s chest rising and falling against his own. He can feel Harry’s body, all of him, beneath his own body and it’s too much and not enough all at once. Draco pulls back.
“How did you do it?” Draco pressed on. “How did you make a life and— and make relationships with people that matter?”
“Yeah. She’s fairly terrifying, your mum.”
“Auror Potter.” The voice, memorized down to its lowest chord, remembered precisely up to the highest, and all the notes in between. Harry’s voice.
“Draco, please—“ Pansy makes a sudden movement at his side, then stops. “It would be best to just let this go, wouldn’t it?”
kill Albus Dumbledore. No,” she says sharply when he opens his mouth. “You’re done talking now. Finish your bourbon and then go sleep it off, and when you wake up tomorrow I suggest you start being very honest with yourself.”
"Who is next?"
"Stimulating," Malfoy answers for him. Harry blinks, and then Luna shifts around until her face is grinning down at him.
“To touch
“Draco,” Pansy finally breaks in, “you are in denial.”
“Dragons,” says Granger, wiping her forehead. “Draig Sanctuary, to be precise.”
"Dolohov."
“Quite,” Draco says. “I didn’t know Potter had a cousin so close in age to us.”
The next morning, Draco prepares himself to visit his parents. When he comes out of his bedroom, Potter stares from the newly-perfect sofa.
He waits on the dune until the top of the lighthouse flares into life, the long reach of the mirrored fire blinking and circling its way across the bay, out to where the ocean hides its face.
“I told my mother I’d see her for dinner,” he says, suddenly desperate to be away.
“Of course,” Potter says, and he leans up to kiss her cheek, a little awkwardly. “Told you I would.”
“I want to assign Harry as your personal guard,” Regulus says when he finds out.
“Twr Mawr,” says Granger behind him. “Run by the same wizarding family since it was built in 1873.”
“You should see her soon,” Draco presses. “How long has it been, since you’ve been out of—”
talk to you about this plan. I just don’t think—“
Potter’s back curls, his shoulders rising and his knees pulling up further underneath him. He rocks back onto Draco’s fingers.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He tried to imagine who he might be if Hermione Granger hadn’t fixed herself into his life like a North Star, but no version of himself in that scenario appealed.
Attempting the crossword.
“I’m glad someone is having a good week,” Draco says.
His breath came fast, and he tried to slow it down. There was a shiver along his spine.
"How lovely," she says. "I see the Nargles are gone, too. Here, Draco—have a croissant."
Malfoy whirled around suddenly. “Don’t you? You’re an idiot for taking imbecilic
Tom Evers looks nearly unhinged now, still frozen in place but blinking rapidly, fingers clenching and unclenching on nothing. Draco takes another step forward.
“I did some research.” Hermione sounded quite cheerful under the circumstances.
Draco smiles, and then he laughs around the light, full feeling in his chest. “No, he’s right. But don’t worry— this would never, not in a million years, have been allowed to grace the table at Malfoy Manor growing up.”
“You’re two moves away from losing your king,” the ghost of Draco Malfoy sneered. “Attacking that rook with your bishop was a terrible idea.”
“You are monumentally close to screwing this up, Draco.” Pansy is tapping her pale pink-lacquered nails against the tabletop— tap-tap-tap. “And as you are one of the few people I do not actually hate, I don’t want to see you throw away the best thing that’s happened to you since you
“Dulcinea is a witch, actually. I stumbled across this place—”
“The big news,” his father begins, “the news I wanted to tell you privately first, is that Salazar is desperate for an heir before this war with Gryffindor ignites.”
He almost wishes he’d never noticed it, and had spent the rest of his Sunday night in a daze of warmth and pleasure. But Harry Potter hasn’t run from anything that frightened him, for a long time. As he looks at the photos tucked inside, of he and Draco outside the Muggle restaurant Friday night, he hopes that Draco feels the same. He hopes that this is worth it to Draco, too.
“I can’t even imagine the horror that must be your liver.”
Potter’s mouth is all over Draco’s throat, and then he lifts up to nip at Draco’s jawline, and all the while he keeps rocking Draco into this huge hunger, this enormous need that will only always want more.
Just as Draco is about to move away, Harry lifts his own hands and pulls Draco down toward him by the upper arms and shoulders. He cradles Draco’s jaw and brings their faces close together.
to the point of panting excitement, too. He grabbed at Potter’s hips, then slid his hands back to his arse, holding and pulling him deeper, and Potter’s cock jumped and pulsed and spilled into Draco’s mouth, and it felt like winning. It felt like catching the snitch during a match, only they’d caught it together, playing for the same team. It felt like his chest was going to burst open, jagged and frantic like the beat of his heart, like the dark, wicked,
“That I’m— well, me. She said ‘your partner,’ like she knows we’re working together.”
“Sometimes people only remember things later. When they’ve had some space to really think about it, in their own time.”
“Goyle?” Harry asked. He’d just given a rundown of Hermione and Ron and Neville’s doings post-Hogwarts.
Sometimes Harry read through the file notes of cases Malfoy had worked on. He was curious about how Malfoy worked, how he fit into this new world: the Aurors, yes, but also just this world that was
“What are you proposing?” Draco’s voice doesn’t sound like his at all. It sounds cold and cracked. “What are your terms?”
“Time to go, boys,” cries Charlie, and he gives the dragon’s rump a sharp slap. Phoenix slides forward, then jumps into the air, his healed wings snapping out around him with a loud beating noise. They flap, and the dragon rises, little by little. He seems surprised, like maybe he’d doubted that he would ever feel the air bending to his will again.
No one trusted Malfoy here, and no one wanted to work with him, but he showed up every day, and Harry
“Thank you,” she says, out of breath. He turns to look behind them. The sea is crashing in foam-crested waves onto the beach below, and down the curving coastline, about a mile away, on top of a rocky outcropping, is a white stone lighthouse.
He also hums little pieces of songs— just long enough for Draco to almost recognize the melody, but not for him to identify the composition.
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Subjects were able to relate everything that happened away from their confined bodies.”
“Was it worth it?” Draco asks, and he’s walking a careful line now. “The woman who died? The dragon you maimed?” Draco moves a little closer, on an angle, the glass of the walls all around them getting closer. “Was it worth betraying the woman you loved, and both of your dead families, just to get at Iwan?”
“Drink?” Blaise asks, as Draco trails him down the hall. Guido is down on the ground floor, looking up at them from the inner courtyard, the centre of the entire Hall. A high, sweet voice is still singing down among the portraits.
Harry looks thoughtful. “Your father prefers court, and you prefer here. Can you not stay?”
Potter’s arm comes up to rest beside Draco’s, his hand joining his braced against the wood. His chest leans into Draco’s back and Draco moves slowly, pressing his arse into Potter, rubbing circles into this dangerous heat building.
It's a standard-sized, heavy-quilted tea cosy, trimmed top and bottom in royal blue, but the fabric is a loud, lurid orange checked with a red so bright and vivid it borders on neon pink. There are stripes of fake embroidery—crowns and tiny, repeating British flags. And in the middle, a large circular likeness of a young Queen Elizabeth, the image stretched strangely so that she appears to possess enormous jowls, like a peculiarly upsetting cross between the monarch and Cornelius Fudge.
?” Draco asks urgently.
“I wouldn’t know,” says Potter.
watching him back, the way they’ve always done. Anyone can be pushed too far, Draco knows. Even Potter, with his crooked smiles and easy affection.
Drills and practices.
December 20th — Tuesday
"Dolohov?" asks Snape.
“As you say. You never go for the obvious, though, I’ll give you that.” Blaise gets to his feet, pulling the knot around his waist tighter. “Just bid on it— people sell things because they want money for them. He might give you an exorbitant price, but you’ve got the galleons.”
—she already has a publisher, because Harry has paid for the first printing.
The company rides into view at midday. Draco climbs to the top of the battlements to watch them emerge from the forest. There are a surprisingly small number of soldiers considering their two kingdoms are about to go to war. As they ride closer Draco can make out a figure near the front wearing the red crest of Gryffindor and the traditional golden lion’s mane on his helmet. When the group slows to a stop near the river moat, Draco goes down to meet them.
“CDs and discmans. They’re flying off the shelves now.”
Something is crawling up Draco’s spine, something with claws and teeth and it wants to come out through his mouth. There’s a burning pressure behind his eyes and Potter doesn’t
their last night together, until Malfoy had gone still on top of him. Harry was face down on his bed, and Malfoy was sitting across his thighs.
Potter finally speaks. “Why would they plan a rally, and invite the press, if they had no intention of carrying through with it?”
“Hello?” he calls, and the man painting in the far corner looks up.
“It’s weird, isn’t?” Potter says as they watch people get on and off the train, crowding in to where they’re sitting. “That a tea cosy is why we’re doing this. Why we’re hanging out, all these years after— well, you know.”
Malfoy’s mouth went all tight, and he dropped his eyes to the desk in front of him. Harry waited, but the usual sharp comeback never came.
Malfoy turns sharply from the window he'd been been glaring through. "Doesn't it ever get to you, Potter? Aren't you tired of waiting and watching and then waiting some more while that absolute piece of shit is still out there, just walking around, just
They were in the last stretch. The finish line was in sight, and they still lingered. Harry licked the dip of Malfoy’s clavicle, and the chest against him stopped moving. Malfoy stopped breathing, for just a few seconds, and then made a sound Harry didn’t even have a name for, his cock jerking in Harry’s fist and his come going all over Harry’s fingers and the skin where his shirt was rucked up.
"You think we should just let the rest of them go? That they deserve to go free after—"
“We know, Pansy,” he says. “You realize we’re going to have to bring him in?”
“I’m afraid that might be a problem, Auror Potter,” says Moretti, a little uncomfortably. “I don’t have clearance to release the body right now, and my department will want to investigate his identity and how he came to be in Naples.”
The room is empty again, and the sun is sinking down toward the sea. “Shit,” Draco says, his voice rough. “Dinner soon. We shouldn’t be missed at that. Too risky.”
Draco draws in a quick breath, but goes back to eating his own meal.
And then he’s gone. Draco hears the door close quietly behind him, and he slides to the floor, strangely out of breath and with tears spilling down onto his cheeks. When he finally looks down, the word is gone, and his arm is the same as it always was.
Its wings, once a lovely, shimmering ruby-color, are stained in darker red gore now, shredded messily and brutally from the shoulder cartilage to the tips.
“No.” Regulus pauses. Overhead, a hawk cries out. “But the countryside is full of hungry people leaving their plots of land, and when lords cannot pay their knights, men go wandering.”
“Not like this,” Draco repeated. And he looked Harry in the eyes. He held them. “I have six more months on my sentence. I want to come to you as a free man, in the flesh, with all my faults and flaws and every true mark on my skin. Do you understand? I want to knock, and I want you to choose to let me in.” He sighed. “I want to feel all of it, for real, and not as an escape for either of us. Tell me you understand.”
“Yeah. I was thinking the other night about how they’d all come running out after their baths when they were tiny, naked and wet and shrieking.”
“Are you ill?” she demanded when he was kneeling down to talk.
Harry forced his hands to unclench and rolled his shoulders until they loosened. “Alright,” he said. “Alright, I see your point. But I also see and have a conversation with the ghost of Draco Malfoy every night.”
The haunting began in the ordinary way. One night—and it was, if not a stormy night, at least very
“Do you have a problem with dragons, Mr. Evers? With the sanctuary?”
Potter smirked, and Draco said, smiling a little, “Dexterous, Potter? That’s a ten-sickle word. Didn’t know you had it in you.”
“Cottage is that way,” Weasley points back toward the beach, but further south. “Only other building on that side’s the lighthouse.” Weasley puts his cigarette out against his boot.
Lucius shrugs. “People die in war. That’s the way of it.”
Draco finally turns. “Potter,” he breathes out, his beautiful, beloved face cracking under the weight of the both of them, here, now. Like two boys breaking all the porcelain in a fancy tea shop. He brings his hand up and wraps it around the back of Harry’s neck, his face leaning down until their foreheads are touching. His hand makes Harry real, makes this moment between them something weighted.
“Tell them?” Harry had asked. “Tell them what?”
“I want you on the bed,” he tells him. “I want to see you. All of you.”
"Time's up, Dolohov. You might as well make it easier on yourself."
“Portrait,” he explains to Draco. “Your aunt, actually, I think. Great aunt. Anyway, go through to the kitchen and she’ll calm down.”
And he did. He followed the jolting wake of Draco’s almost-there touch all over his own body, and he whispered things into the gap between them. Secret things. Wild things. All the things he wanted to do to Draco, everything he’d imagined. Draco’s pale face turned darker, flushed all over, as Harry went down his list of all the places on Draco’s body that he wanted to touch.
“Missed what?” Draco asks. He’d been distracted watching Potter, who is seated across the table from him and has been accosted by the elderly Madam Bulstrode. She seems to find him quite charming.
When the sun is lost behind the buildings to the west of him, Draco pulls a kitchen chair out the back door and sets it on the little concrete slab in his back garden. He sits down, and he waits. The air turns colder and bites at his bare hands and his face, but he stays. The street lamps down the alley flicker on, and he can hear the noise of people going in and out, rattling dishes and talking to their families or friends. It’s a distant but familiar swell of sound, like the ocean.
Hermione was watching his face, and she knew him so well, sometimes it was damned annoying.
Rowle’s body hits the pavement hard, almost silently. He’s gaunt, strangely weightless. Too many years on the run.
It’s made from a warm cream yarn, with bright, cheery swirls of red and burnt orange running in circles up to the slightly misshapen top, where a teal pompom is perched like a fat, startled bird.
Harry stood on one side of a line he was already leaning over; it was up to him, he knew, to cross it. “What do you want, Draco?”
you, Draco.”
“It’s ok,” Harry said. “I don’t mind. I guess—well, I guess I like it, now.”
Hermione nodded. “It makes sense. And that’s not all. Interviews with the subjects afterward indicate that they can’t just go wherever they want. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be place-based at all.”
“It’s very rare, as you say. That makes it very valuable to collectors. But—” He slides the money a little closer, and she picks it up and holds it in her hand. It’s a large stack of bills. “Well, you keep the cosy.”
“Carys,” says Weasley. “She’s known for her food, draughts and spells. The Kitchen Witch, they call her on the island.”
Draco thinks it’s a very bad idea, but there’s not enough time to complain about it. They squeeze into the cramped space and close the door, Potter muttering a spell to lock it. Hopefully Warrington doesn’t want to relive his glory days at Hogwarts right now.
a tomorrow. But he just nods, and picks his way slowly over to the makeshift staging point they’d created earlier. There’s a witch handing out return Portkeys to people too tired to Apparate back; it’s the same witch that made the emergency batch earlier. She manages a brief, tired smile and drops something into his palm. It’s a small piece of metal shaped like a witch’s hat. As the tug grabs him in the belly, and the world begins to swirl, he glances one more time back toward the carnage, and catches sight of Potter standing on the pockmarked sidewalk in front of the destroyed building. His head is tilted back, and from this distance he looks quite small. Draco could almost imagine he was the boy of the last War again, young and doomed and stupidly noble. He stops that line of thought, though, as Potter spins out of sight and Draco cracks through the ether, back to the Ministry. He doesn’t want to think about the boy
The ghost of Draco Malfoy floated lightly around the room, peering into picture frames and wiping at some crumbs of toast with his pale, silvery hand. None of the crumbs moved from their place on the wooden table. “Why are any of us anywhere?”
“The one and only,” said Harry grimly.
, and it didn’t feel like a surprise. Not really. Wasn’t it inevitable? Wasn’t it the natural progression down a spectrum of which he and Malfoy were the poles?
“Yes,” Malfoy murmured. He was sucking a spot on Harry’s neck. It made Harry want to melt, to ooze out all over the kitchen floor. “Yes, Potter.”
“All I know is that I was in my cell, and then I wasn’t anymore.” There is a strangely weighted silence, as if more words waited on the tip of Malfoy’s tongue, but were swallowed down instead.
“Yes, I know what you mean.” Draco clears his throat. “My father died recently, too. Just over two years ago. It’s been very hard on my mother.”
Potter ’s breath is shallow, uneven. He swallows, then pulls his wand out from his back pocket. “Finite,” he says, and he’s Harry again. Finally.
“No. That’s true enough, but I was going to say that my hair finally suits me.”
“Alright, mate?” Ron’s face appeared behind Hermione’s, half obscured by her hair.
They’d been partners for more than two years now, and Harry had thought he knew how to deal with Malfoy’s moods. Underneath his adult shell, he could still be as mercurial as the boy from Hogwarts, but all his tells were so subtle now that no one noticed.
“All of the subjects’ projections were tied to another person. So it turns out, although this is not actually the ghost of Draco Malfoy, he is haunting
“Did you enjoy that, Potter? Seeing me there?” Potter just looks at him. Potter used to look at Draco a lot when they were at Hogwarts, but he hasn’t looked at Draco much at all since then. “Did you like having all your worst suspicions confirmed?”
“There’s more,” says Granger, before he can reply. “The Ministry did receive a request for a security detail, and the roster had Harry down to do it.”
He steps back again, quietly. He doesn’t want to wake the Lucius in the portrait. Doesn’t want to shatter the memory. Back in the entrance, he eases the door shut again, and then leans against it for awhile, remembering. Trying to give the good more weight, that it might begin to equal all that had come after.
Harry stood up. “Because insulting me is the most fun you get up to anymore. Kind of like the old days.”
Harry snorted and accepted the wine. "Yeah, I can imagine that."
"How's it going to impress me that you can change your eye colour?" Harry muttered.
The dark haired man grimaced and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been fond of those parties at all, because people had kept trying to clamp onto him, making him uncomfortable with their praises and their gratitude. Yes, he had saved the Wizarding World, but he didn't like being reminded of that every five minutes. He'd never been so happy to hear that Kingsley had put a stop to those parties as soon as he'd become Prime Minister.
“That’s okay. You can stay.” Harry lifted his head and looked at the blonde.
Harry couldn’t move, tied to the headstone he couldn’t move, could only stare at Cedric’s body lying not twenty yards from him, both of their wands and the Triwizard cup beside him. Then Wormtail dragged a cauldron in front of him, a snake – Nagini – circling the tombstone. The rest was hazy – the grave beneath Harry’s feet cracked open, and Wormtail cut off his own hand at the wrist. The sound of his flesh tearing, cutting into the bone – and the soft thud of his dismembered hand falling into the cauldron. Harry squeezed his eyes shut; he didn’t want to see this. He couldn’t see this. He shouldn’t. And then Wormtail slid the sharp end of the knife against Harry’s arm, and his skin felt like it was burning, and he could hear Wormtail muttering,
"It's not even midnight," Harry grumbled, but shot a guilty look at the clock. It was a quarter to midnight to be precise, but he had been feeling too restless to catch some sleep and he hadn't wanted to wait until the next morning to visit his friends.
Her eyes briefly glided over the vase with the flowers as she followed him to his living room. If she was bemused by the fact that it wasn't a full bouquet, she didn't show it.
The strange question had Harry frowning. "Yeah, not for long, but I saw them. Where did they come from? Why do they disappear after just a couple of seconds? Are you using some kind of spell?"
Ron frowned, only showing the barest of flinches still at the name. "I hope you know what you're doing, Harry," he muttered darkly.
"The date takes place in the forest?" he asked bemused, eyeing the towering trees.
The first thing he noticed upon entering the Great Hall was how far removed Malfoy sat at the professors' table. He sat all the way to the left, near the Slytherin table, while the others sat more to the right, with McGonagall and Flitwick more to the middle. He saw the wary looks some of the other professors snuck at Malfoy, as if they were expecting him to rise up any moment now and declare his undying loyalty to Voldemort.
She surprised Harry by turning towards him and offering him a gentle smile. "It was a pleasure talking with you, Mister Potter. I'll be seeing you at our manor next week for dinner."
Would he and Malfoy be able to make it work? They should be able to, right, because why else would his Veela side have chosen Harry? The Veela wouldn't choose someone completely incompatible, because there would be no point in that.
something we can do when we know each other well. And you know, the Veela
"Nothing. He demanded I call him by his first name before he would tell me why and how he got me that stone."
He scowled at her. "I'll remind you of what you said when father is informed."
"Ones that can be better discussed in the privacy of one's room instead of a corridor," she smiled affably, folding her hands in front of her. The dark blue robes she'd chosen to wear made her look almost ethereal; especially with the way her long blonde hair was braided loosely, resting across her right shoulder.
"Right, I guess that makes sense," he muttered, nodding to himself.
It wasn't that he didn't trust Malfoy – Draco – not to lie about this when it was something that could be easily researched, but he knew Hermione would scold him if he didn't verify it. Talking about Hermione, should he try Floo calling her and Ron still?
"The Bloody Baron. Think he's looking for you," Harry said cheerfully, his grin widening when Peeves cursed loudly and instantly disappeared.
Damn, if he didn't know any better he would have thought she was part of the Aurors; her deduction ability was somewhat scary actually, with how accurate it most likely was. He himself couldn't think of any other reason either why Draco had kept quiet about his identity so far.
"All right, lay it on me. What do you need help with?" she asked, her eyes bright and curious.
"I don't think he will," Hermione mused pensively, shrugging when Ron stared at her in disbelief. "What? Harry is still his son's mate; Lucius would be incredibly stupid if he thinks he can get away with trying something."
She smiled. "I know where his quarters are as I used the Floo to arrive," she said amused. "Currently, however, my son is dealing with another Floo call, so I decided my time was better spent finding answers to my questions than remaining there."
"Perhaps you have made the connection already, but just in case you haven't: I'm a Veela," Malfoy said simply, his hands resting on each side. He looked completely relaxed, even though those large wings must be quite heavy on their own.
"Hey, mate, that means you're still good looking," Ron teased him.
of you for dinner. Let us say, Saturday at six o'clock, does that work for you, Mister Potter?"
Malfoy stopped a few feet away from him and smirked. His broom was a Nimbus 3000, the latest one on the market. Opinions were divided over which broom was the fastest now: the Nimbus 3000 or the Firebolt still. Harry supposed they were going to find out soon.
"Need I remind you that I did figure out early on that you were planning something in our sixth year?" Harry smiled thinly and grey eyes narrowed slightly, but oddly the blond remained quiet, ignoring the slight.
"And they never give you any trouble whatsoever?" Draco asked sceptically, putting his empty glass back on the plate.
"Given that we're going to try dating now, I think that it's high time you start calling me by my first name, don't you think?" And again the eyebrow rose up. "Or did you call all your former partners by their last name?"
The blond wizard raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms; his cool gaze flitting to the broom. "Well, well, what do we have here?" he drawled, something flickering in his eyes. "Didn't expect to see you here at this late hour. With a broom nonetheless. Lost your way to the Quidditch Pitch, Potter?"
"Granted, it's not like we know many male Veela," Harry said, shrugging. "And even then, why should we have immediately known that he's a Veela?"
"I have been patient for more than a month," she riposted finely. "I know why you kept quiet about this, Draco, and frankly the reason is idiotic to say the least."
"Plinky is following Master Draco Malfoy's orders, Master Harry Potter," Plinky answered, blinking his large blue eyes rather owlishly. "Master Draco Malfoy be sending a letter as well."
Harry smiled softly. "That's nice. I didn't know she's such a good cook." Honestly he had a bit of trouble merging the image of the stern, blank faced woman he'd met at the Quidditch World Cup with that of a mother teaching her son how to cook.
Harry couldn't say who moved first. Maybe he did, perhaps Draco was the one moving first. It didn't matter. They gravitated towards each other like they had done time and time again, even back when they hadn't wanted to do that.
"I've got a question to ask you," Harry said, not beating around the bush and decidedly ignoring Malfoy's use of the word
In the meantime … He glanced at the clock and sighed, standing up with a groan. Perhaps he should go to the Great Hall again before any of his colleagues would start asking questions again.
She narrowed her eyes slightly and leant forwards a tad. "I'm not in the mood for any sort of games, so I'm going to be blunt about it: I suspect that you are Draco's mate."
"The fact that you sent me two daffodils." Harry shrugged and tilted his head to the left. "I thought that was strange, especially considering their meaning. I figured that if you really were going for the colour meaning, you would have sent me two carnations or two chrysanthemums instead. You went for two daffodils and that's what made me look further. The birth months of my parents, Sirius and Remus – how did you know?"
Malfoy stared at him bemused.
"You think I'm bad?" Grey eyes glistened when Draco tilted his head to the side. "Wait until my mother unleashes her full force. You'll regret opening that portrait to her very soon."
"I'll take your word for it," Harry chuckled. He nibbled on his lip. "Thanks for the flowers. I didn't think you would go for a meaning like that."
Thank you so much for your comments and your kudos! I'm so happy to see that this story has already nearly a 100 kudos :O
"Considering he already gave me a gift, he would be going pretty far with his lie then," Harry replied idly, thinking about the stone. "I doubt he would waste money and the effort to get it through my wards if he's just playing a joke or lying to me."
Harry had lost count of how many cauldrons Neville had accidentally damaged during their Potions classes and Snape had never thrown such a fit and resigned. Obviously there had been a clear difference between Snape and Treeling, but still, as a teacher she should have expected that things might go wrong. No matter which year a student was in, mistakes could always occur.
"That's the odd thing: he asked me if I could really see them and then demanded I describe them to him," he answered, running a hand through his hair. "When I asked him what those wings meant, he refused to answer and just said that it was interesting. We went our separate way and when I woke up this morning, I found this on my pillow." He showed her the stone.
Thank you for all the comments and the kudos! I really appreciate them!
"Oh, she does," Malfoy said confidently. "Every Veela does unless they somehow suffered an accident through which they lost them. It takes a lot to damage them, though, let alone break them to the point where they're no longer usable."
"I'd say that's a lot of assumptions you're making without any sort of proof," he retorted. "Him not mentioning me anymore doesn't mean anything else but that we're colleagues who don't start fight after fight anymore."
Not even half a minute later footsteps could be heard approaching the door and Harry straightened his back when it swung open, revealing Malfoy dressed in a simple sweater and black trousers.
Dropping down heavily on the kitchen chair, Hermione sighed heavily and wrapped her robe tighter around herself. "Did you seriously call me out of bed for this?"
There was a part of him that was sceptic and expected to be stood up when he left his quarters at eight thirty to make his way to his own classroom. He didn't have particularly good experiences with meeting Malfoy at night and given how odd the blond man was acting, Harry didn't have much faith in him actually showing up.
Guess who's back?
"Good afternoon, Fleur," he smiled and settled comfortably down on the floor. "Thanks for wanting to talk to me about this."
"But I've never seen her with wings before," Harry said confused and frowned.
He saw the note only when he picked up the daffodil. It was folded neatly in two, too short to be an actual letter and he opened it curiously.
"Okay, fine," she gave in begrudgingly. "But that doesn't mean McGonagall doesn't know how to read people better."
She ignored him. "Why would that bother you so much?" she asked, frowning. "If he cast a spell, then obviously it didn't help him in the match seeing as you caught the Snitch."
Warnings: Hm, nothing special, I suppose, except for Harry getting annoyed
"What the hell did you do with your eyes just now?" Harry snapped, whipping his wand out of his pocket and aiming it straight at Malfoy.
Thank you for all the kudos and the comments!
"Not much my father can do about the fact that you're my mate," Draco answered dryly. "He probably won't be happy about it for a while, but he's not going to try to curse you either, if that's what you're worried about. That wouldn't really end well if my mother got involved and he knows that."
"All right," Harry said slowly, hyper aware of the way Malfoy kept staring at him. "Is there a reason why you called me here specifically? I assume you'll be announcing this news to the others tonight."
"Yeah, that's what he told me as well," he muttered and looked away for a moment. While he could admit that he still thought the idea of him being Draco's mate was odd, he wasn't entering this dating part out of pity either. That would be an insult to the both of them.
When the room – large as it was – became a bit too stuffy and warm, they wormed their way through the mass of bodies, slipping outside to the patio where floating candles offered them enough light to see.
He unlocked the door of his classroom, because he wasn't going to stand outside like an idiot. Some candles automatically lit up when he entered the room and with the moonlight pouring through some of the windows, it meant the room was bright enough not to accidentally walk into something.
"See, told you, you wouldn't mind dancing if you did it with me," Draco pointed out smugly as they came to a stop at the furthest end of the patio where a stone bench had been placed.
Harry had only ever seen a unicorn once, back in his first year, and the poor thing had been dead then; his blood being sucked out by Voldemort, who had possessed Quirrell. Since then he hadn't had the chance to see even one of them, let alone the entire herd, though he knew that Hagrid kept track of them whenever they came close to the school's borders.
"And that he managed to send me a gift through my heavy wards – that's normal too?" Not that he was particularly worried that Draco would try to tear down his wards or try to get something malicious through – if he did, that would be the last thing he would ever do – but it still seemed strange that even the strongest wards weren't capable of keeping out gifts from a Veela.
"If you think this is me being perverted already then you're really leading a sheltered life," Draco teased, his eyes dancing with mirth, letting Harry slap him once more.
"Okay, so what's the difference then? Why can he see her wings, but I can't?" Harry asked impatiently.
Don't let Malfoy bother him, huh?
He honestly had no idea why he was here: standing in the middle of the Quidditch Pitch, holding his Firebolt in his right hand, watching Malfoy stride over to him. The Gryffindor Quidditch team was gathered on the spectator stands, dressed in uniform, and every single one of them giddy to see their professors flying against each other.
"What else could it have been?"
A fourth flower greeted him as he entered his quarters, feeling a bit drained after having had to break up a fight between some Ravenclaws and Slytherins. He still didn't know what had caused the fight, but the end result had been ugly with eight out of the ten students involved having to be escorted to the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey hadn't been happy at all and he had managed to duck out of the wing just in time to avoid hearing her berating the group.
He should have known coming here would do nothing. When had Malfoy ever been helpful anyway?
Harry was left hovering in the air, his breath escaping in tiny little clouds, as he wondered just what the fuck had just happened.
"Yeah?" Draco's smile was faint. "You like them?"
Normally it wouldn't be a problem but Teddy was slated to visit him this weekend. His godson had been looking forward to this visit for weeks now, so Harry had promised he wouldn't do any work at all in order to devote all his time to the young boy.
"Yeah well, I wasn't about to make things awkward between you and your mum," Harry retorted and crossed his arms. "How was I supposed to know that you were ready to tell her? She said you kept evading the question in your letters to her."
He busied himself making some tea, using that time to fully wake up. He could call for a house elf, he supposed, but making tea didn't take that long and this way he could catch his bearings again after her arrival had brought him off balance.
(See the end of the chapter for
He scowled at her. "You'd want to avoid them as well if they kept asking you out."
His eyes widened and he caught himself before he would slam the book down and call Madam Pince's ire upon him. There it was: the actual meaning behind the flowers, one he had overlooked several times when reading the passages, because it hadn't rung any bell immediately.
"She doesn't know anything at all?" Harry asked sceptically. Somehow he had a feeling that was untrue.
"It's pretty, look, like the wing of a bird!" Teddy chirped, pointing at the ridges of the wing.
The unspoken "Or else" hung heavily in the air.
Grey eyes glinted when Draco glanced at him. "Why are you assuming that they mean something?"
That had Draco throwing his head back, laughing. "Oh my, the great Harry Potter casually threatening his students? Whatever would the Headmistress say about that?" he grinned.
"Why?"
It was only when he was making his way to his quarters that he realised Malfoy had never said why he had shown up.
Now it was his turn to be unimpressed. "Oh, just like I was imagining things in our sixth year? You know, when he tried to kill Dumbledore? I distinctly remember you telling me I was imagining things as well back then and look how that turned out."
"Ah yes, I suppose my odd luck is good for something at least," Harry snorted. "Would be embarrassing if I could defeat Voldemort, but wouldn't be able to teach longer than a year."
"Whichever it is, I'm still here, and McGonagall doesn't have to search for a new professor every year. She's pretty grateful for that," the dark haired man grinned.
as the newspapers loved to refer to him would never know such dark spells, right?
"Partly," she confirmed. "But in other ways too, you'll
"Maybe," she allowed. "But aside from somehow getting through you wards and trying to use his eyes, had he actually attempted to really attack you so far?"
It was a bit presumptuous of Draco to send a flower with that kind of meaning already when they had only just started the courtship, but he assumed he shouldn't have expected anything less from the Veela. It was clear that Draco was serious about this and mates tended to stay together their whole life, so would it really be that strange if he already sent flowers with that kind of deep meaning attached to it? To other people: most likely yes. But Draco was a Veela and they couldn't be compared to non Veela people.
flying was.
"Right." He flushed a bit and cleared his throat, stepping aside to wave her through, because what else could he do? Clearly she wasn't about to take no for an answer and he'd rather not get into an argument with Draco because he'd been rude to his mother.
"Oh, they'll be sweet, all right."
Leaving Harry to wonder what exactly he had briefly witnessed during their match.
; his wings rising higher and spreading out behind him, catching the moonlight.
"Well, there's no real point in lying to me about it when I can easily go ask Fleur," Harry snorted and crossed his arms. "I'm sure Hermione would be able to figure it out as well if I went to her with this information. You'd be incredibly stupid to lie to me about this and while some of your past decisions haven't been the smartest ones exactly, you've never struck me as particularly stupid either."
A quarter to nine; Malfoy should be in his quarters by now.
Perhaps he should go for something else? But he already had changed his outfit four times before and he was starting to feel really stupid now. It was just a date, for Merlin's sake. Okay, so it was a date with Draco, something he never had envisioned he would end up doing, and yes, it had been a while since he last had gone on a date, but …
Furrowing his eyebrows, Harry questioned, "Would you, I don't know, be in pain or die if I rejected you or so?"
The mischievous smirk Draco gifted him sent blood rushing to his cheeks. "Because I'm taking you out on our first date."
"I should have realised it sooner that he's a Veela," Hermione said chagrined and leant back in her chair with a huff, crossing her arms. "All the signs are so obvious in hindsight, I can't believe it took me this long!"
"So you believe me when I say you're my mate?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
As a matter of fact,
"I can't believe you actually pulled off the Wronski Feint perfectly!" Eliot Thompson said amazed, leaning so far over the railing he was at risk of falling down. "It's even better than Krum's!"
Obviously Malfoy knew the patrolling schedule as well, so him wanting to meet here made sense if he wanted some privacy. Did Harry want privacy, though? He doubted the meeting would go that sideways, but that would all depend on what exactly Malfoy wanted to talk about.
"Huh. Well, give me a bit to change and then I'll make some tea for the both of us." She disappeared upstairs then; her heels tapping on the staircase.
"No, you won't," Draco was quick to refuse, but it was no use.
If by being close meant Parkinson hanging around Draco's arm and Draco seemingly tolerating her existence at least. Harry was pretty sure they were friends, though, even if Draco hadn't mentioned her since he'd started working here.
Cuddles
So he had to be missing something, something that was more than just the meaning behind the flowers or the colours. If not the meaning behind the colour or the flower itself, though, what else could it be? What else could flowers possibly represent?
"Yes, look, are you going to answer my - "
He halted abruptly when he noticed the second presence in the office. Malfoy was sitting stiffly in one of the chairs in front of the desk, his hands folded on his lap. He turned his head to look at Harry, but surprisingly didn't sneer. His gaze did become hooded with apprehension, but the rest of his face was a blank mask, reminding Harry uncomfortably of Lucius.
Before she could say anything in response to that, a second series of rapid knocks on his portrait had him standing up with a concealed sigh.
Who knew a proper Pureblood like Malfoy would know such an uncouth gesture? What would his parents say about that?
"You mind me sitting here?" Harry inquired, just in case he had completely misread the room and Malfoy was the type to prefer sitting alone while eating.
"I have no idea what you're talking about, Mrs. Malfoy," he said apologetically. Shouldn't Draco be done by now with his Floo call? He had to be wondering whether his mother was, surely?
When he looked back, his breathing hitched at the way Draco's eyes positively
"You think he was trying to put you under a spell?" She rubbed her index finger across her lips, looking worriedly.
The daffodil joined the carnation and he made his way to the Great Hall, nodding in greeting at some sleepy students and stepping aside to avoid being splattered by a mud ball, courtesy of Peeves, who hissed angrily and turned upside down in the air, glaring at him balefully.
"That's because I wanted to have you to myself for as long as possible." Draco rolled his eyes and crossed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Harry. "I knew that as soon as she knew that you're my mate that I could say goodbye to peace for a while. Case in point, she's already invited us to dinner at the manor."
"What? It means you're still good looking, no?" Harry shot back.
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
They parted at the end of dinner without saying another word to each other, but Harry caught McGonagall's approving gaze right before he left the Great Hall. He offered her a quick smile in return, though he hadn't been civil to Malfoy for her sake. He and Malfoy were colleagues now, and he would prove – if only to himself – that they could be civil towards each other now that there was no longer a war or Voldemort dividing them.
Warnings: Nothing in particular, I think; except for a minor reference to a past character death
"How about you tell me what your game is with this stone and I might consider not retaliating for breaking through my wards," Harry smiled thinly. "Which, by the way, also needs an explanation. I'm waiting, Malfoy."
"What the hell, no! I asked you a question first, you don't get to demand anything from me until you've answered it!" Harry retorted, clenching his fingers around the stone. Had Malfoy been hit with a Confucius spell? Or had he just walked straight into a door? That would explain his odd order.
his eyes change, if he can reach you through your wards – you're his mate, no doubt about that."
While Dumbledore had been fond of making the other person feel guilty by being disappointed in them, McGonagall had the ability to sound both pissed off and disappointed at the same time, which was much worse in Harry's opinion. She might not be one of the youngest anymore, but she was still a force to be reckoned with and she wouldn't allow any discord between the professors.
AN2: Somehow Hermione keeps popping up LOL
Thank you for the comments and the kudos!
"Now, now, Severus, they're no longer children," Dumbledore chided gently; his blue eyes gleaming amused. "I'm certain they'll get along better now."
more like – like we're really attuned, that you don't need words to know how the other one feels," she said slowly and a hint of frustration shone through when she said, "I'm sorry, it
He was pretty sure he hadn't been this bad as student nor had anyone else been from his year – and he had been in the same year as Neville who held the dubious record of melting down the most cauldrons in the history of Hogwarts.
"I don't know," she admitted chagrined. "I can't immediately think of anything that connects all those dots, but my speciality has never been any type of creature. I'll go take a look in the library at the Ministry tomorrow and in the Records Room. I might be able to find something."
"If you want fun, why not go to the third floor?" Harry suggested innocently, putting his wand away.
"I didn't say that." Suddenly Draco was right in front of him, his eyes glittering as he stroked Harry's cheek with the aster. "But when I give you one, it'll be meaningful and not gaudy."
"At twenty-four years old, you remain just as annoying as when you were a student, Potter," Snape groused, glowering at him.
Draco was already eating breakfast when Harry arrived and he nodded at him in greeting. "Good morning, did you encounter Peeves?"
"Yeah, I guess we'll find that out soon," he smiled, feeling cautiously optimistic.
His blunt inquiry had Malfoy wincing slightly, but his voice was even and calm when he answered, "No, nothing of the sort. Well, it would hurt and especially my Veela side would feel miserable for a while, but it's not like I'll die if you reject me. It just won't be pleasant."
"Ronald Bilius Weasley, you've got some explaining to do," Hermione said coldly. "And Harry, do go eat in the Great Hall; you don't want those girls to think they've got the power to scare you off."
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
Harry frowned and pursed his lips. "You're a real git, you know that?"
"Mother is here, right?" Draco demanded in a clipped voice and strode past him without even awaiting the invitation.
instinctive to me. It
He should have refused; he still had a lot of assignments to grade, it was already quite late, and there was no reason for him to indulge Malfoy's weird request. Yet at the same time it also felt impossible to refuse, like him not showing up meant that Malfoy would win their argument by default.
He smiled thinly at her. "Well, you were looking for explanations, no? These just aren't the kind you're wanting to find."
Teddy's eyes, meanwhile, were already fixated on the chocolate cake; his drawing completely abandoned for now.
"Well, it
"Not to mention that your photo version literally ducked in the bathroom the couple of times you had to have dinner at a restaurant," Draco continued and sat down as well. "Doesn't take a genius then to figure out that high class restaurants aren't your thing."
Harry snorted quietly before deciding to change the subject. "Got the flowers by the way."
"Yeah, best not, or otherwise this date is going to take one hell of an interesting turn," Harry snickered. "You've got your wand with you, though? You never know."
from the others. Your beginning will not be
That had her frowning more severely, realising what it meant. She had been there when Harry had raised those wards and knew just how strong those were. There was no easy way to just break through them and definitely not without an alarm being sounded. "You think he gave you the stone?" she guessed correctly.
"What do they look like?" Malfoy deflected his questions with another one of his own; his grey eyes growing with a weird sort of intensity. He flew closer to Harry, making the other man lean back warily.
She raised an eyebrow, but the rest of her face remained blank, making it unclear whether she was truly offended or perhaps bemused. "No, we're not," she agreed after a loaded pause. "But there are very few people of whom can be said that we share a bad history with them. That does narrow it down quite significantly, I'd say."
Draco shrugged. "You deserve a break on this day," he said nonsensically, but Harry understood it.
"I know they're staring at me, that's no longer a surprise," Harry replied calmly. "And I've never given a damn about my reputation, Malfoy, as you should well know by now. Can we at least pretend to be civilized people who can exchange some small talk with each other? It's been six years since the war, Malfoy; I'd like to think we can get past our rivalry of then. So, what's it going to be? Your settling in at the school or the delightful tale of my godson driving his grandmother mad? Your choice."
"You're such a dick, Harry," Ron complained.
From carnation to chrysanthemum to daffodil and back. From the dry information about their ideal growth places and origins to the meaning behind their colours and …
For all the strange things that had occurred, however, he could confidently say that never in all the years before had he woken up to find a stone of all things on his pillow. The thing that disturbed him even more than the appearance of the stone did, was the fact that nothing should be able to get through his wards. His were one of the strongest put in place in Hogwarts – as strong as the castle would allow – and he had entered very few exceptions into them. The only ones who could send him something were Hermione, Ron, Andromeda, Teddy and McGonagall.
." His smirk deepened when Harry frowned.
The crushing weight of his own fatigue came down on him. He swallowed as a tight, hot pain worked its way up his throat. His eyes burned with unshed tears, rousing now as if drawn from his anger. He couldn’t be here anymore in this castle, watched by all those horribly grateful people. In the same castle where he’d decided to die to save them. Where he had killed Voldemort.
He was so lost in his own thoughts that he nearly missed the book this note had been wedged in. Another French title, faint enough where it was etched into the black leather that he had to squint to see, and a simple name engraved into the bottom of the front cover.
of your mind?” she snapped, not waiting for him to reach her before she let him have it. “What were you
Carried on by Hermione’s soft footsteps, the wave of whispers seemed to turn toward him, as if the attention of the Wizengamot was a sentient, massive thing.
Before he’d killed Voldemort, that life was one of the only things which kept him going. Now it just seemed like one of the many things built on top of shifting sands, washing away with the sea.
“You’re going to go to a muggle school?” He blinked. “Is that…allowed?”
you, Harry?”
“Returning to Draco Malfoy,” Robards said, his voice flat, “you say he was tasked to kill Albus Dumbledore. Do you know why?”
“I just—don’t like the way the Ministry seems to be handling this,” Harry waved his hand, unable to adequately convey what he meant, “this whole situation. It just seems harsh, that’s all.”
Silence.
“I didn’t know there was a meteor shower tonight. Not that I’d be able to see it in London.”
A fist had formed in Harry’s chest, hot and hard and brittle. This couldn’t be right. He understood monitoring pureblood families who’d shown sympathies to Voldemort. He understood fining them and charging them and doing whatever was needed to start to fix the chaos which had happened last year. He even understood taking in kids who proved to be dangerous, like Geraldine White and Bradford Belmont, not to put in
Harry arched a brow at him. “Seriously?”
“All right,” Andromeda murmured, “try to relax, Harry. This will work easier if you aren’t fighting it.”
And Malfoy was nothing if not a dramatic bastard.
Harry got up and moved before he could think better, brushing Hermione off with a whispered, “I’m fine, it’s nothing.” He walked amongst the groups of people clustered together, silently pleading with everyone to stop looking at him for five minutes. He lost hope of that right away. On his own amidst a sea of people who kept thanking him, watching him with hope and relief, piling all their grief on top of him, he wanted to shove it off and disappear. He regretted leaving his invisibility cloak back with the Weasleys and looked around for Luna, desperate for her to cause another distraction for him. But he had started this. He wasn’t going to stop now, not when he didn’t know if he would be able to do it again.
The lift jerked into motion. Harry looked down, breaking the moment of relief. A little pebble dropped into the hollow cave of his chest, ripples disturbing all the foul things below. The swarm of noise reached a crescendo with his blood beating in his ears, and he let the boiling anger drag him under.
Harry felt arguments swelling thick and hard in his throat. Bill was wrong. It mattered what he did, because he was no different than the kids they’d locked up for defending themselves, than the kids who wore reminders of their parents’ prejudices on their ankles. And they hadn’t even
Edlefina’s eyes shined with moisture. “I’m… I’m sorry for—”
Goyle yanked his wand away.
As if sensing Harry’s attention, he looked up, a surprising softness to his eyes. “Nymphadora asked you to be his godfather, didn’t she?”
up, Malfoy,
So Harry stared, because it was easier to stare at Malfoy than anyone else in the room.
Ron, who wasn’t a broken shell of a thing who was only alive because his soul had been mangled so much it no longer obeyed the rules of normal magic.
Kamau took her time, giving Harry a long, considering look. “I hope one of these days we meet under happier circumstances, sweetie.” Her large dark eyes seemed to bore through him. “I’m sorry to say that you’ve more than lived up to your reputation.”
Bill came back in, holding out the black case and the vials. “What else can I do?”
“Did Ravenna Lamar deserve to be killed, Minister?”
Harry froze at the end of the front hall. It was Ron. Ron was at the door.
“Thank Merlin,” Bill said in relief, “Harry, look, I—”
Four days after Kingsley’s visit, Harry left Shell Cottage, kipping on Ron’s couch in his newly bought and very independent,
He didn’t know why he did what he did next. Maybe he just hated bullies, even if they bullied someone who had once been determined to treat him like dirt every time they saw each other and who had on more than one occasion actually threatened his life.
Guilt reached into him and grabbed. His chest grew tight as he tried to breathe. Now that he didn’t feel like he was slowly exploding from the inside out, Harry realized the gravity of the situation. How much he’d put both Andromeda and Bill through. “I’m sorry. Bill, I’m—”
Harry frowned at her before returning to his methodical tracing of one water droplet down the handle of the glass. “No, Robards did. Bill too. Malfoy got kind of pissy when I mentioned it, actually. Like he didn’t want to talk about it. Bill said he was being really cooperative. I even saw him offer to help, like he’s done it before.”
One benefit he hadn’t even realized of having his own place now was that he owned a fireplace and could floo whenever he liked. Setting it up was a bit of a hassle and he nearly burnt all his hair off the first two times he tried to use it but he hadn’t needed to bother Ron so he thought he’d done well. And it’s not like his hair couldn’t handle a bit of a singe anyway. So he spent the week leading up to the trials wandering around Muggle London, halving his time between aimlessly trying to fill the hours and visiting Andromeda Tonks and Teddy Lupin.
Harry gave a weak laugh. “No, it’s—sorry. Long day.”
“The ankle cuffs have a Baleful Body-Bind Curse in them, Ron. You don’t think that’s extreme?”
sat us all down and told us to leave you alone because
But he’d interrupted. For no justifiable reason.
Fine. If they were satisfied, he wasn’t about to throw himself into Azkaban in protest. He hated himself for it, but he didn’t want to be punished that much. He couldn’t
“Did anything else happen, Harry?” Hermione pressed. “You just seem a little—”
The auror looked back and forth between him and Malfoy. “It’s not. But he’s—he’s not supposed to be here.”
Their fight in the ruins of the Entrance Hall came back to him. Malfoy’s desperate anger, the look on his face when Harry finally broke down and screamed at him. He’d thought about that face more than he’d like to admit over the summer—knowing now as he looked back that Malfoy had just been scared the whole time. Harry hated how it muddied things, knowing. Understanding. Understanding
Hermione blinked, concern making her brows shoot up at once. “No. I haven’t gotten a chance yet, I’ve only been back a few days.” She went quiet and leaned toward him. “What’s wrong? Did something—”
“Are you
“Remus and Tonks—” He started again, eyes burning. “Remus and Nymphadora trusted me enough to ask that I look out for him, if they couldn’t. That means a lot to me. I know I won’t be around all the time, and I don’t need to be, because frankly I’m the least qualified person to do anything so important as raise a child and I’d probably mess it up if I was here too often, but I want him to know I
For a moment something caged and haunted flashed over Bill’s face, but then he dropped to his knees, panic slotted efficiently away as he started murmuring healing spells under his breath. The hot brand around his throat released and Harry coughed. “Stabbed,” he managed. He tried to gesture to his side, but moving sent another wave of dizzying pain through him. His vision blacked out and for a moment he went under.
“Like what?” he asked, voice strangled. “Like I know how it feels to be treated like shit because of who my parents were? Like I spent eleven years thinking I was a piece of trash because my aunt and uncle wanted nothing to do with me and I was this stain on their carpet, this bug they couldn’t squash? Like I should be grateful I wasn’t turned out onto the street?”
he also owned. He signed the papers, took the keys, accepted control of the wards, and she was gone.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed and his voice lowered. “Ah, well, I bet that was fun for you. Work out all your childhood grievances?”
Harry turned as sharp footsteps clipped toward him in a determined nonchalance.
“If I remember correctly, it was Royse Avery who built the house in the Cotswolds, sometime around 1460. It was near the start of the War of the Roses, anyway. So you’re probably looking at a Binding of Hunger, a consecrated apple tree bound by the knucklebones of a Welsh Trallod Du. It’s pretty straight forward—the spellcraft, anyway—but you can’t remove the tree without destroying the bones or you’ll have a whole family of wights hunting you down for the rest of your life.”
The man to her left apparently did not agree, because he didn’t even rise to shake Harry’s hand. “Jean Chastel Proulx, Mr. Potter, from the French Ministry.”
Harry stared, his heartbeat loud against the rush of blood in his ears.
snaked into Voldemort’s mouth and Harry felt it because it was his curse as much as it was Voldemort’s. He had been holding it inside him since he was a baby, and now he was giving it back. He was closing the circle.
He began dropping in by floo nearly every day once he realized Andromeda spent most of her time in the house unable to leave because she had no one to look after Teddy. He offered to sit with him any time she needed to pop out. It led to a few close calls—Teddy nearly got stuck in the toilet their first afternoon alone. After that he shredded a few shirts and proceeded to wail like a banshee when Harry took the eviscerated remnants away. By the third day, Harry came to accept that he had no idea what to do with children and he probably never would, so he should just stop freaking out every time the kid hiccuped.
At this, Harry had a long walk around the attic, wandering aimlessly through the stacks as he thought of Frank and Alice Longbottom, their distant stares and broken minds.
“There’s more than one?”
Before he could so much as throw a Shield Charm up around her, though, a figure came barreling toward Hermione. Neville, shouting, roaring at her to run, and when she ignored him, pivoting with his wand to be ready. Hermione, face slicked with sweat and wrenched up in fear, withdrew her hand—and from the depths of the Sorting Hat came a glint of silver and red.
Harry blinked. “There’s a greenhouse?”
Harry closed the greenwood book and sat back. The tree on the front was the one he’d seen in his head. He didn’t know what it had to do with the magic inside, but it was like they were connected, like the magic originated from the tree, or existed because of it?
“He’ll be fine.” She gave Bill a relieved smile, patting Harry gently on his uninjured leg. Her voice was shaking a bit, like her iron control was breaking now Harry wasn’t in danger of dying. “You did a fine job stabilizing him, Bill. I’m not sure he would have made it a few more minutes without it. Now I just need to heal everything else. But first, I think a cup of tea.”
had finished her off.
fast.
Harry to die for his plan to work. He wouldn’t care what would happen to Harry’s soul after he’d killed Voldemort. Because Harry would be dead. It wouldn’t matter.
The water struck his skin, scalding and steaming and wiping his mind of all thoughts for one blissful second. He ducked his head and stood under the faucet and scrubbed his face, letting the water score down his neck and chest, over his stomach and legs. Merlin, this was nice. The heat did something to his back, letting him unwind and relax, as if all the knots there were working themselves out under the violent ministrations of his shower head. He wondered absently if this was the house’s doing as well, if there was some drug in the water that made him calm down. It certainly seemed willing to let him stand under the water as long as he wanted. Even the other shower gave him problems sometimes, turning cold in sharp bursts to let him know his time was up.
He had come back.
I didn’t have to think about any of them. I
Andromeda cupped his cheek again, just like she had a few weeks ago, and brushed her thumb over the falling tears. Her hand shook slightly against his face. “Let’s get you cleaned up, all right? Do you think you can walk?”
“Was the questioning that bad?” Hermione asked, leaning forward to prop her elbows on the table. “You really do look awful.”
The courtyard rocked and erupted into a storm of shouting and dust. Harry lost sight of Malfoy in the center of the explosion when he was jerked to the side so hard he nearly lost his glasses. He rolled out of Hagrid’s hands in the chaos and pulled on his invisibility cloak. Without hesitation, he plunged forward into the crowd. He searched the center of the explosion, where Malfoy had— He must have known— Harry didn’t think it was enough to kill Voldemort but it would have killed anyone else.
“Fine,” she snapped, throwing her hands up. “
over the whole place.
“You don’t mean that,” Hermione said, voice breaking as she took a careful step toward him. “Harry, you don’t—”
“I…well I realize this is a bit odd, but I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help you…with the house.” He gestured with both hands, as if Kreacher might be in danger of not knowing which house he was talking about. “I’m not much use, I know, but I’m… I can help. If you like.”
He didn’t want this to be true. Most of the time he could convince himself his feelings had had nothing to do with expediency or necessity or obligation. It was too fucked up, too cruel, to imagine the only reason he had ever liked Ginny is because he thought he
Bill cursed under his breath. Through the window Harry could see him run a hand through his hair, shorter now than it used to be but still long enough to make Molly’s eye twitch every time she looked at him. “Fifteen. Bloody hell.”
“Kreacher is never being taught.”
A silver-blue specter of a stag appeared out of his wand. It seemed to look back at him for a moment, and Harry felt a snap of horrible, clawing shame at the knowing, unyielding look of those depthless eyes, before it fled into the night.
“You don’t have to thank me,” he said, still quiet. “I meant it.”
You think you know but you
“I’ll take a tonic and lime,” Hermione said, giving Ron a disapproving look. “And you should too. I’m not carrying you back to your flat.”
“Right,” Madam Yeats called out, breaking the tension in the air only to summon a different kind in its wake. “I believe the Wizengamot is satisfied.”
But he couldn’t now, could he? With every drop of blood and gush of steam, every shouted word as the black, shapeless thing tried to claw him, to rend him, he felt the house like a network of lights, each one humming and gentle like fireflies. All that magic was still there, the first foundations bringing to him images of rolling green fields beside an ancient, sprawling town, a river snaking through little hills and glens. He was dwarfed by the age, the hundreds of years of ghosts and spirits and ambient energy all forming into a strangely innocent collection of rooms and doors, stairs and windows, creaks in the wood and the slightly pealing wallpaper.
And then Harry had a chair. Now he was
Harry snorted. “Of course you dreamed about university.”
Goyle lay only a few feet away from him, face down. His right arm was spread out at an odd angle, hand balled into a fist around Harry’s wand.
It wasn’t an either or. It wasn’t either Harry died and Voldemort lived. It was both.
“Yeah. Permanent sticking charm,” Harry said, focusing on Teddy while his heart panged.
“No, not Malfoy. All of them. The Slytherins. Kids of death eaters or sympathizers.” He could practically hear them both thinking he’d gone mad. “He turned over his house, you know,” he said quietly.
—to just sit here where anyone could walk up and decide to pull him into a conversation.
“Hey, Teds,” he murmured, walking over before he hesitated, not sure if Andromeda wanted him near her grandson after he’d—
He stopped himself from punching the ground, but only barely. An odd sensation of crackling energy surrounded him—his magic flickering to life just like it had in the courtroom. It startled him enough to kill his shout, breath coming fast as he fell back on his arse to the ground. He lifted his hands—the palms of them had angry red half-moons carved into his skin, they were pulsing with blood. And as he watched a small flicker of white danced over his palms.
“Ugh, no,” Harry said with a groan. “That stuff—”
Had he imagined the white light? The same light he’d seen right before he’d killed Goyle?
She hesitated for a moment, her eyes flicking to Harry, but then she nodded and handed Teddy over. “Anybody take milk?”
“Of the few who were of age, there are even fewer who have been put under surveillance and house arrest though we’re keeping tabs on them all. I’m going to ask you about the ones who are under direct suspicion of criminal acts. I’ll remind you that no matter what your relationships with your peers, this is part of a criminal investigation. Anything you withhold to protect one of them will only muddy the process, and we would like for this to move as swiftly as possible. Do you understand?”
“I know, Bill. I’m trying. It’s…” Kingsley sighed, closing his eyes. “Geraldine White and Bradford Belmont initiated an unprovoked attack on aurors. They put Vinnick in St. Mungo’s. I don’t have a lot of ledge to walk on, here, especially not right now.” He hesitated, something in his expression tightening. “I can only go so far before the Wizengamot replaces me.”
Kreacher wasn’t listening to him, however. He was staring with wide, glossy eyes at the plant. As Harry watched, that gloss formed into tears which streaked down his face.
Had the Great Hall always been this long?
We had to figure out how to survive, to
The house didn’t respond, though he did feel something like warmth in an ambient breeze.
Craning his neck, he fumbled around for his wand only to have it light up on the other side of the room. He was still in the cellar, then. Which made sense, as this was where he collapsed when the ritual had been completed.
Harry beat back the voice telling him to abandon this insane idea at once, facing off against the plant like it was a rival player and they were high above a Quidditch pitch. He shook out his hands, bounced a bit on the balls of his feet, and began.
“If I said I was sorry, would you accept it?”
“Worse than putting bombs on the ankles of thirteen-year-old kids?”
Trembling all over, Harry rose to his hands and feet, biting off a cry as pain flared up across his ribs and his right hand crunched sickeningly. He barely caught himself. It felt like all the bones under his skin were shifting where they shouldn’t have shifted, like sand and shards of glass moving between his fingers.
When he woke in the morning, it was to the realization that he no longer wanted to become an auror.
It was the only thing that made sense. Harry must have truly died in the Forbidden Forest as well. He’d come back due to a weird and inexplicable quirk of magic no one understood, but for a tiny, infinitesimal moment, his soul had no longer been connected to his body. It explained the lapse in time between Voldemort cursing him and waking on the forest floor. He’d been dead.
was being subtle, near the end. They’re worried. Why do you think we’ve got outside officials coming in to babysit and make sure we’re being properly punitive? I’m sure Shacklebolt wants to reassure the rest of the Wizarding World that they’re taking the problem seriously.”
Well. There it was. Ron had known. And he’d done nothing.
Chapter 2 Songs:
He nodded, accepting an answer he was definitely not sure he’d been given.
aren’t they?” Malfoy’s lips twisted. “Never mind that from what I hear, there were a fair few Ravenclaws who also found the new establishment not altogether repulsive, whose pureblood parents were just as passive, just as willing to roll over and let someone else take the blame. The cuffs aren’t hurting anyone, right? So is it such a big deal, in the end?”
Malfoy continued to frown at him, saying nothing but looking at Harry as if he were trying to read his mind. Harry felt his neck warm and his cheeks flare hot and then he was wondering why the hell Malfoy staring at him now was any different than all the other times he’d stared at Harry. Maybe it was the lack of malice, or the genuine confusion which made his eyes brighter and harder to look at.
Harry straightened up. “Yes.”
The image of a woman suspended over a long, dark table, hooded figures surrounding her, laughing at her as a snake coiled near Voldemort at the end—whispering, pleading, with Snape as he sat impassively beneath her—a pale sliver of a boy unable to stop looking up at her in horror…
Tears fell down Hermione’s face as she listened, frozen in horror, and he hated it. He hated this. He felt like he was being ripped apart. All the frustration and listlessness of the last three months were torn to shreds and the only thing left was this white-hot kernel of pain where his heart was supposed to be. He didn’t know what he was saying, but he couldn’t stop.
PART ONE
He kept returning to the attic even though he couldn’t look back through Regulus’s notes. He wanted to, the part of him which could still want things, but he was too tired. He wanted to sleep. But when he laid down and closed his eyes all he saw was Goyle’s broken neck, Millicent’s missing arm, on and on until the row of Harry’s dead made his chest hurt so badly he couldn’t think for crying. Not even the dead. Malfoy cropped up again and again—bleeding out on the floor of the bathroom, hand shaking as he faced Dumbledore, staring, terrified, at Harry over the corpse of his aunt.
he had. All the months and years leading up to this moment rushed through him, every small detail and tiny victory, all the loss and anger and fear, the pain of living his whole life as series of battles. He had made it his mission to
It became more evident as the week went on that he couldn’t work for the Ministry. Not as it was, anyway. After the long days of questioning as they walked out of the Ministry together, he listened to Hermione talk about reforming it from the inside, about working within the system to change it for the better. That was all well and good. Harry sincerely wished her the best of luck, because if anyone could do it, it’d be her.
“I didn’t think so,” Robards said quietly. “And even if I weren’t inclined to believe you, there’s something else going on here, something which complicates your situation.”
Harry should have known it would be different for him this time but he was still surprised to see that his beam of light was sliver and blue, steady and pulsing and bright—not red, not anymore. His line of light thrummed and pulsed—
“Mr. Potter,” he said in warning, his deep voice resonant and overwhelming.
“Look, it’s that or the Prophet, and I can’t bring myself to pay for that shite.”
Another silence leaked out of the window toward Harry, flowing into his nose and down his throat as he struggled to remain silent. Heart beating in his ears. Hands clenched at his sides.
Three days later he finally got the all clear from Bill.
“Please.”
“Malfoy hasn’t murdered anyone,” Harry muttered.
“Be quiet.” Her eyes flicked to his and held, a small, horrible flash of fear reaching out to him before she regained her steely composure. “Most of the bones in your right hand are shattered. You have two fractures in your ribs and a puncture wound to your stomach, which nearly caught your lung, and another cut to the back of your knee that grazed a ligament.”
She didn’t move.
Harry’s head turned, not far enough to banish the figure, but he had to see something. He had to know…
Harry struggled for a moment, not sure, exactly, how to explain what he was feeling. Could he tell them about the kids in Azkaban, about Ravenna Lamar?
Harry ran his thumb over a slight groove at the head of the hawthorn wand, the edges smoothed down like someone had a habit of performing the same worried gesture over and over again. It wasn’t quite right, though, because Malfoy was left handed.
He had just defended Draco Malfoy. Well, not
A shaky exhale beside him. “You should be more careful with these,” the figure said, voice low and rough, the cultured tone of it shaking.
She blinked. “Bill Weasley’s wife?”
Voldemort flinched as if Harry had struck him.
It took Harry the length of the lift ride down to shove up a wall and disconnect from his emotions. When he stepped out, he might still look a mess, but he was nothing on the inside. The anger was there, waiting, but he wasn’t touching it.
Drenched in sweat and heaving for breath, he choked down a scream. Fear thrummed through him, violent and wild, kicking his heart into a gallop as every fiber of his being wanted desperately to
“I sat there with you in that pub a week ago, and you and Ron and Bill all said it was
Whatever she saw in his eyes, Daphne seemed more suspicious rather than reassured. “Well. We’ve got a sentencing hearing to go to, and unfortunately for us we’re not even in the main room. Going to be dreadfully boring, and I’m sure you both have better things to do than exchange awkward pleasantries for the next five minutes.”
Harry noted the stumble, like Malfoy was unused to using his true name.
Well, at least Harry wasn’t too far from the mark. Yeats and the others probably just wanted him in to say they asked for his opinion. He wouldn’t be surprised if he was asked to pose for a photo with them when this was all over. They’d slap his face on the front of the Daily Prophet to lay it on thick, let all of Wizarding Britain know Harry Potter approved of their methods.
People could change, sure, but Harry couldn’t shake his own disbelief. He couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy alone in that dark house, deciding to open his doors and pull back the the curtain on all the wealth and history his family had amassed over however many hundreds of years. Malfoy deciding to give information on people he knew were dangerous and would most likely kill him for it if they found out.
Tom’s smile was a drug, a lovely, wonderful drug and Harry wanted to drown in it. It was darkness and desire and every ounce of furious longing Harry had been holding inside himself for years. An offer to let go. To just…stop fighting. To give it all up and let someone else look after him. He was so tired of being angry, of being alone, he was so
Proulx narrowed his eyes, about to say something smart, no doubt, but Harry cut him off.
Harry had the distant thought that Hermione would have been thrilled to watch the process. The thought snagged as he remembered her tear-stained face, her shaking voice.
“Draco.”
It took him a solid five minutes to walk about thirty feet, but he got out without incident, managing to keep his mouth shut as the reporters hurled increasingly wild speculations at him. As soon as he stepped out of the throng and down the steps to the atrium, he spotted Hermione—waiting for him with her arms crossed, a badly crumpled copy of the Quibbler in her hand, and the kind of anger in her eyes Harry had long ago learned to fear.
PART TWO
The entity roared, blowing back Harry’s hair and forcing him to close his eyes or else be blinded by dust. He felt, rather than saw, the third barrier slam into place. The fourth sent shockwaves through the house as steam curled up through the cracks of the floors and windows, bringing small motes of gold to brush over the walls and the furniture. The fifth dropped his stomach—leaving Harry with the immediate knowledge that there would be no turning back after this. Either he saw this through, or he and the house would forever be at odds.
Swarmed in on all sides by the fighters, Harry almost missed the ragged cry.
“And do you know the nature of what he was working on?”
Harry opened his eyes as Andromeda pressed a vial of smoking black liquid to his lips.
And if Millicent had wanted to kill him, she could have simply trailed him one day after he left the Ministry. She wouldn’t need to cast the Dissintegration of Morgan Le Fey, to put herself and so many other people in danger—and it’s not like they were trying to make a statement. As horrible as it would have been, it would have made more sense if Millicent was carrying out some terror attack. If she’d given a
He made it to the apparition point in the alley out back, grateful there wasn’t queue. The wards on his new flat gave him a bit of trouble—one of the
him. All the time, in fact. If Malfoy wasn’t laughing at him he was probably doing something else to piss Harry off.
Face pressed against a soft blanket smelling of lavender, Harry heard someone saying his name.
Harry—knew Harry had always chosen to disarm, not destroy, to incapacitate, not kill—he would wait and outlast him, out-duel him. He would make sure Harry
Her eyes widened comically and she looked like she was about to say more, only to flush under Robards’s hard glare when he cleared his throat.
“Hiya, Luna.” Harry grimaced. “Sorry about the late call.”
He didn’t speak the incantation out loud, managing the nonverbal countercharm with more force than he’d intended. The door flashed white then yellow as the spell broke. It blew open with a bang, tearing one of the hinges loose, but it stayed up.
Malfoy stood there, staring at him, wand loosely clutched in his upraised left hand like he was about to offer it back to Harry. His expression flickered—anger and frustration giving way to that same distant, reaching emptiness he had seen in the Great Hall. Sympathy ripped through Harry as he realized just how thin Malfoy’s veneer of anger was. Harry knew, in the tight crease of his forehead, the slight tremble in his chin—Malfoy didn’t know what he was doing either.
“You get any sleep?”
The words on the grave of his ancestor Ignotus seemed to laugh at him.
“You were attacked, Harry. You acted in self-defense. There’s nothing for you to confess. Not right now. When you’re healed up, we’ll go from there. Right now you just need to stay here and stay safe. You’re no use to anyone—” Bill swallowed tightly. “You can’t confess if you insist on hurting yourself, all right?”
His fingers clenched around the gnarled back. There was something sweet smelling about the tree. He imagined he could hear the sap being made, sugar dripping down the insides of the tree.
Kingsley studied him closely. “Usually, when a Fidelius Charm has broken, it’s impossible to recast on the same place.”
After inhaling the food, though, and downing three cups of coffee—the cup kept refilling on its own, the cheeky thing—he still wasn’t sure he was in full control of his mental faculties.
Bill tensed as he met Harry’s gaze, alarm in his eyes before his expression closed off entirely.
He’d killed Goyle.
But if he’d been walking around as a reanimated corpse his whole life, that must count for the same thing. Easy to see how dying might destroy one’s body, metaphorically.
“They brought me in to talk to Gerry and Bradford. They were a bit reluctant to cooperate, having watched these same people kill their friend only a few weeks prior.” Malfoy paused. “They tried Ravenna’s sister, but Eldefina was understandably too distraught to be of much help.”
Harry broke through his fog and wrenched back in horror.
Harry finished off his ale, pleased to see Charlie’s waiting gaze. “Hermione, Ron, and me stole one of their dragons.”
One of the other two, a beautiful black woman with sleek hair and a warm smile, offered her hand, her eyes a lovely dark brown. “Faye Lorelai Kamau, Mr. Potter.” Her deep, slow accent was unmistakably American and her robes were colorful without being ostentatious, the cut of them rather more sharp and masculine than those worn by British witches in the Ministry. “I’m an auror here on behalf of MACUSA, to help you all get back on your feet.” Her smile sweetened. Harry had the unhelpful thought that she reminded him of Fleur. She had that effortlessly beautiful charm that made you want to help with whatever she needed. Did America have veelas too, or was he just freaking out for no reason? He was definitely
“You left for London two weeks after we got back from Hogwarts. You and Hermione
Harry stared. “Is that bad?”
tell you that?”
“And you want me to look through them?”
reason. The Blacks were flush in that old blood money way and it wasn’t like Sirius had spent much after getting out of Azkaban. As far as Harry knew, the only big purchase he’d made had been Harry’s Firebolt. So there was an indeterminate amount of money currently sitting in Gringotts and all he knew was that when he made withdrawals none of the goblins tried to kick him out. Which, frankly, was surprising, because he was pretty sure they knew exactly who had broken into the Lestrange vault. So either they had decided to forgive him in a rare change of character, or he had so much money they didn’t want him to take his business elsewhere.
Harry Potter seemed especially tired that Monday. He was tired every Monday, as most students were, but that Monday in September he looked like he was about to fall over where he stood. It was far too early in the school year for Potter to be dealing with death-defying situations yet, thought Draco, so why was he so dead tired? Ron stood beside Hermione, looking rather bored while Hermione looked like she was listening intently to Hagrid. Draco was used to tuning out his Care of Magical Creatures lessons by now, after all what had the class offered him before but a broken arm last year? No, Draco usually spent the class period running on autopilot, doing his best to make his classmates do any dirty work with the animals rather than himself. But today Draco was thinking about Harry Potter.
The disturbing one with the grotesque diagrams and cursework, clearly written hundreds of years ago. Hadn’t Felicity Burbage been surprised to see an old curse in action, one that hadn’t been used in hundreds of years? Were they connected?
“You’re right,” Harry said when he finally found his voice. “I’m being selfish. For once in my fucking life, I’m being selfish. I don’t want to see you. I don’t want to talk to you or Hermione, or anyone else. I don’t give a bloody fuck what you think about my feelings or my life. It’s my life. I don’t owe you anything. I don’t
And don’t you dare try to shove off what you did to my mother. She’s frantic because you had a mental breakdown in front of hundreds of people and you’ve shut yourself up in this fucking tomb and they can’t come check on you. The only reason she and my dad haven’t come over here yet is because
“It belonged to my great grandmother. She had a penchant for Mongolian horsehair and seemed to put it in everything she made.”
Back then, he’d been facing down Voldemort. Now it was the whole world, an unfixed, horrible kind of specter he couldn’t see and had no idea how to fight. He almost longed for the simplicity Voldemort had embodied. Harry had had goals, concrete plans he could put into motion while knowing where it all led.
“So you’d rather bury yourself in this mausoleum than be with the people who love you?”
Malfoy had always taken up as much space as he could, entering a room like it belonged to him, looking at other people with a benevolent smugness, like they should be happy he let them exist within his presence.
Harry wondered what his boggart would look like now. Would it still be a dementor? Was he afraid of despair anymore? He had a feeling it’d be something a lot less simple now.
was that?
“By terrifying children?” he practically shouted. A few people gave him startled looks as his voice rang through the atrium.
Right. Of course he would.
Somewhere behind him he heard Bill curse.
Cedric had looked the same. His large frame spread out over the ground with an unnatural stillness. Eyes dark and wide. All the tiny signs of life severed. Dumbledore, Fred, Colin, Remus, Tonks—they all had the same unreality. Like time had frozen around them as the rest of the world kept turning.
The strange thing, though, was that while it’d made its presence known the moment Harry had started going round the house testing for where the foci of the house’s magical energy was located, it hadn’t
The thought of having Tom Riddle stand next to him and smile at him with a companionable twist to his mouth and a knowing look in his eye should have made Harry want to flee. He should have been backing away, running, trying to put as much distance between them as possible.
Harry under him, one hand on Goyle’s wrist, choking, broken.
should have made him feel
The bags under his eyes gave him a manic, tired look, and his hair seemed even more wild than usual. With the leather coat he’d taken from Sirius’s closet and the only pair of semi-intact jeans he’d been able to find in the mess of clothes he’d dumped and promptly ignored the minute he arrived—there was a rip in the right knee but he truly could not give less of a fuck—he looked a bit like the teenagers he’d seen walking around London at night before he’d been forced into hiding. Cigarettes in their mouths and chains on their trousers, their boots thick and black and intimidating. Overlarge t-shirts and faded plaid flannels and worn out jeans. It wasn’t a bad look. It was different, definitely, but not bad.
Couldn’t she just be dim for a second and let him off? “This is just my face,” he muttered.
Teddy grabbed his fingers after a cursory stretch. Harry let him gnaw on them for a while as he just watched.
Malfoy stood apart from the others, distinguishable because of the white shine of his hair, the pale cast to his face strangely luminous in the smoke and fog of the encroaching dawn.
Harry swallowed the spike of pain. He didn’t blame Kreacher anymore. Not entirely. It was more Harry’s fault that Sirius had left that night for the Ministry, not Kreacher’s. But it was hard.
do. And apparently I’m the only one willing to say it out loud.”
A tiny vibration went through his palm, a little bead of warmth, like a dog pressing its nose into his hand.
The impression he got, however, was one of fevered, thorough research. More than a few times it looked as if the quill had broken where Regulus had pressed too hard, large splotches of ink in the middle of a paragraph, tiny rips in the parchment. As he flipped through more of the pages he saw slight discolorations in places—water marks, he realized with a lurch.
Chapter 4 Songs:
“It’s too quiet. I loathe the quiet.” The figure shifted, the space between them getting ever so slightly smaller. “Of all the places you could be, you choose this sad, lonely beach. I don’t understand it.”
But none of it specifically applied to girls, did it? Maybe… Maybe it didn’t need to.
Old magic like this, in his limited foreknowledge, was rooted in innate understanding and specificity of thought. To fix or clean or renew something, you needed to understand it. That’s what he thought he could make out, anyway, as the script he could now comprehend wasn’t exactly
He nearly missed it as he walked through the main hall, but an odd prickle at the back of his neck made him stop and turn. For a second he didn’t see anything amiss, but then his eyes stuck on the place where Walburga Black’s portrait hung.
And Kingsley couldn’t show favoritism now, because if he did, people would link him to Harry. Harry, who had decided right away that people needed to know how heinous this was. Harry, who had a penchant for telling the truth even when it fucked him over.
“Tell me how using children to punish their parents is a good thing, Bill,” Harry said, low and rough. “Tell me how threatening the lives of children is a fucking
justification. “I…had a suspicion Malfoy—ah, Draco, had been accepted by Voldemort between our fifth and sixth year and made a fully fledged death eater, due to—my own observations.”
deem to be worthy of the court’s appreciation.”
“I’ve loved having you here, Harry, so don’t take this as me warning you off,” she started gently, “but I wonder… Why are you spending so much time with an old woman and a toddler? You’re eighteen. Don’t you have something more exciting to do? You’ve got your own flat, don’t you? You should be spending time with friends, surely.”
Ravenna Lamar. Fourteen. She had been killed by aurors. He didn’t know what an Anilex Orb was but no matter how dark or powerful—she was
He wished he was the same person who could ask his friends for that kind of sacrifice.
He ran the pads of his thumb and middle finger together, managing a simple healing charm to stop the blood welling up. Something about his blood must have opened the box. Just like the passageway to the cave had opened for Dumbledore when he bled on it.
The first reference to horcruxes by name didn’t come until the fifth page of notes, and even here it seemed as if Regulus were performing a thought experiment. Harry caught passages which reminded him of
“This isn’t a topic for a pub,” Bill said quietly. “Let’s just—get out of here and we can talk about it, okay?”
“Protect you, yeah,” Bill muttered, shoulders sagging. “I remember.”
A few days into the unofficial project he stumbled on a new section of the attic, or he thought it’d been a few days—he’d taken to sleeping on a cot he’d conjured rather than make the trip downstairs every night and back up every morning, and Kreacher was delivering his meals up here now rather than down in the kitchen. Really, this house was far bigger than he remembered it being. Even the ceilings seemed to be taller, the halls wider. Maybe he was just getting used to it, but the claustrophobia he always used to feel in Grimmauld Place was ebbing ever so slightly.
, darling.”
Just like Harry.
because it meant she had done this with some other bloke. He had a history of being wildly jealous of other blokes being within five feet of Ginny—but he just felt guilty. He felt bad that this was probably disappointing for her, because while he enjoyed the act itself after he figured out what the fuck he was doing, it wasn’t special. Even he could tell that it was pretty underwhelming. It was just…nice. He liked Ginny. He was attracted to Ginny. He liked sex, which was actually quite a relief to know for sure now, but there was nothing else there. It was just sex, when it should have been the first night of the rest of his life.
His circle of light, reinforced with
He hoped he still would.
With everything he’d been through, especially the past few months, it was nice to be reminded that it was a gift. Sometimes he forgot what it’d been like, before. He never forgot the loneliness and the anger, the caged, helpless feeling of knowing no one wanted him and no one cared. But this—he had the power to change the world he lived in. And even if everything else felt like it was unraveling, like everything he did was taking him further off the path and deeper into the forest, this was still good.
“Wizards are known to produce inexplicable magic when they’re pressed,” Kamau said softly. “It’s not ridiculous to say you performed wandless magic in a state of panic, when your life was on the line. It’s instinctual.”
“I know that I’m the last person you want to hear this from, right now,” Kingsley continued, voice solemn and soft, “but there’s nothing else to be done here. We’ve followed the trail, and it led us nowhere. Sometimes, that happens. There’s no evidence that this was part of some larger conspiracy, or lingering sentiment from Voldemort’s supporters. We’re not looking at a Neo-Death Eater retaliation against you.” It was almost like they were the only people in the room, Bill, Andromeda, Teddy, and Robards just impressions at the edges of his vision. “It was a crime of passion done in self defense, and in this case, Gawain is more than within his rights to close the investigation without filing any criminal charges.”
He’d heard Hermione talk about spell interference and residual magic traces sometimes making charms or enchantments act strangely, but he’d never really seen it work in practice. This was very advanced stuff, not something he would have learned in the classes he took at Hogwarts. The closest thing he could think of was Potions and the possible adverse reactions some concoctions and ingredients had to others. You shouldn’t take a Pepper-Up Potion right after a Calming Draught, for instance.
He wondered how long he could keep telling himself that before he gave up the ghost and accepted that
Draco Malfoy was looking at him, looking
It didn’t make him feel better. It made him angrier, honestly, pulling in all the horrible detritus of the last few months and forming it into this compressed ball of fury. But he held back. He made himself be patient, something he’d never gotten the hang of and hated almost as much as the anger, and so he waited.
“Hi,” he said, working through the violent knot in his chest. “It’s—Edlefina, right?”
Harry did feel something at that, a little dart of pain to his heart. Right. Of course. She wasn’t stupid. She must have realized a relationship with him would never be normal or easy. Because
Malfoy didn’t say anything to comfort her. He was still, his body rigid and his eyes fixed firmly on a point ten feet to Harry’s right. He just held his hand over hers, a steady pressure to stop her fidgeting.
Ginny had never been overly affectionate when they were dating, and while Hermione’d started fussing over him during their year on the run, it still wasn’t something he was used to and the discomfort remained even when he was grateful for it. And neither Hermione or Ginny had ever given the impression of mothering him. It was different with Andromeda. She probably didn’t realize, but it meant something he couldn’t quite express. It was the same feeling he used to get when Molly included Harry as an unofficial family member.
He began to look at this attic as something closer to the Room of Requirement than a disorganized library, wandering through and letting his subconscious pick out books or scrolls or errant parchment from the whole jumbled mess. Most of them were written in another language or focused on a topic in which he had no interest. Copies of old grimoires by wizards and witches he’d never heard of, detailed family lineages for what seemed like every pureblood British, French, and German family going back a thousand years, books filled with diagrams of intricate and completely incomprehensible magical artifacts. He set aside the ones which looked mostly intact, placing the rest in a pile to go through later to see if there was anything worth salvaging amidst the mold and dust, the books whose ink had faded so long ago all that was left was a faint indentation of words. He didn’t have a chance in the world of understanding the last, but he wanted to keep them, just in case. They seemed too valuable to just discard off hand.
Robards looks around at them. “Thirty two people were taken to St. Mungo’s. Most of them women and young children. They were in the flats beside the building that was bombed, and a few were workers who had just arrived at the flower shop on the other side. Most were released by nightfall after receiving treatment for minor injuries, but nine are still there receiving intensive Healing. There was one death at the scene— a young mother who couldn’t find her daughter. The child made her own way down a stairwell right after the blast and is fine.”
December 23rd — Friday
Potter is waiting for him when he Floos in this time, with his jacket on.
Pansy glances over her shoulder from where she’s sorting through the stacks of vinyl behind him.  “Ha!”
He runs his fingers down his hardening cock, imagining Malfoy’s hands. Trying to remember exactly how they’d felt when they were moving on his body, so many years ago. He lets his hand linger along the top, pushes the head harder into his palm. The callouses there feel a little different, the skin less sensitive and more rough, and he shivers.
“Did he say what those plans were? If there was more coming before the vote?”
“But—” Harry struggled around a hard knot in his throat. “But we could—we have all this time to—”
“Oh, McLaggen— stick to your script. Leave the thinking to me. You’ve nothing to worry about. Now
“No one expects you to run,” says Kingsley calmly.
Malfoy clears his throat. “It’s Mother, really. She knows everything about everything that grows out of dirt, it seems. But she doesn’t leave the Manor anymore, and she’s taught me quite a lot over the years.”
“Why?” he says, finally.
“Are you alright?” asks Potter. She looks at him, but her face is blank. Empty.
“I meant about my retirement. Your mother seemed to think I resigned because of the story about us.”
“But smaller,” says Blaise. “And portable. You just carry it around with you and listen with the headphones. They’re dead cheap to get, and the discs even cheaper, because Muggles barely use them anymore.”
He sat, and breathed for another moment. “This was always going to hurt somehow, Potter. You and me.” Potter turned his head to look at him, so he turned, too, and their eyes met.  “Wasn’t it already?”
"Is there a time limit on justice, sir? Can we justify giving up, allowing the remaining fugitives their unearned peace from the law, because our search requires patience and time? What does that tell their victims about how much we care for their pain, and their loss?"
it?” Potter looks confused, and then suspicious.
I wrote this chapter in a hurry after taking a shower. I just watched The Lighthouse and have been feeling very weird. Sorry that this chapter is so violent. Don't worry though, this story won't be angsty forever. I'm thankful for every one of you that has continued reading this far. Your support keeps me going! Comments mean the world <3
A boy had kissed him, and he felt like a criminal, worse than he already had felt before in his own house. The memory of soft lips on his cheek burned, as bad as the cut on his forearm, as awful as when Petunia had burned his hand. His body was on fire, raging, and it was freezing, it was cold as ice and he woke up shivering every time.
“Well you’re not going to learn if you stay above the water like that!” Draco said, taking hold of Harry’s arm. Harry looked down – it was the arm Vernon had broken ten years before, the one they’d never gotten properly fixed. It was slightly crooked. Malfoy was holding right where the bone had fractured. He didn’t seem to notice. “Come with me.” Malfoy said, pulling Harry deeper into the water.
Draco hadn’t seen where Harry had gone, but he definitely didn’t want to be caught by Filch, definitely didn’t want to scrape tables. And then he felt a warm hand grip his wrist and spin him around to the wall, and Draco was staring straight into the eyes of Harry Potter.
In his dream that night, his cousin Dudley and his cronies had pinned Harry down at the end of the neighborhood street, off to the side where no one would spy them through the trees. Dudley had a knee on Harry’s chest and spat in his face as his friends held Harry’s arms and legs – not that he was bothering too much to struggle – it wasn’t the first time they’d done this to him. When they finally let him up, Harry was covered in spit and dirt and when he walked into the house his aunt slapped him for getting dirt on the rug. At least, he had thought, he could take a bath, and change into a different pair of clothes before making dinner.
(See the end of the chapter for
Okay! So it might be awhile before the next update - I'm trying to make these chapters longer and I also have quite a bit of schoolwork lol. I'm sorry for skimming over the first task, but it wasn't really relevant to this fic's plot (as I'm mostly focusing on Harry's relationship with his trauma as well as his relationships with other people) and to be honest, I don't really enjoy writing action scenes lol. I'm kind of using this fic to work through my own relationship with childhood trauma so that's going to be this fic's main focus, honestly.
Harry blinked, smiling softly. “Me too.”
“You’re going to have to go into the Lake then, I’m guessing. They’ve got mermaids living in there.”
“I –”
Draco laughed, “That’s ridiculous. Firstly, because even if there were magical jellyfish, they’d be in the ocean, they’re saltwater creatures, Potter, goodness. And secondly, the only thing you’ve got to worry about killing you are the mermaids, and they probably know about the task already, so I don’t think they’ll
“You’re my best friend, Harry, I really don’t mind. We have Divination, so we don’t have to rush,” Ron looked over at the door, “but Hermione will have our heads if she finds out we skipped, so come on, then.” Ron kept his hold on Harry’s arm and dragged him out of bed and out of the dorm. They made their way (albeit, somewhat slowly) up to the Divination Tower, where Professor Trelawney greeted them with a wide grin and mumbled something about how lovely it was to see them both as she had sensed their impending doom, and was happy to see that they hadn’t died mysteriously yet.
There was Dudley and his friends. Harry had managed to leave the house. Had managed to get outside for a moment and breathe again and there was his cousin, grabbing him, kicking him into the dirt, calling him a worthless fairy, of all things. If he was a poof, he’d be called one. If he wasn’t, he’d be kicked anyway. It didn’t seem to matter in the end though, however much Dudley would hit him, because Harry still saved him from that damned dementor.
“I want to.” Harry said softly. “But not yet. Not tonight.” Green met silver. Harry took a sharp breath. “Let’s just pretend everything is normal.”
He saw Malfoy and rounded the corner, throwing his invisibility cloak on. Why was that git still following him? Hadn’t he scared him off? Harry heard Draco’s footsteps as he too, came around the corner, when Harry realized Draco looked like he was going back to the dungeons. He wasn’t following him, then. Probably.
“Get him some spell to hold his breath or something, obviously.”
“About the snow? You’ll have to find somewhere else, unless you’re perfectly comfortable with sitting in wet snow for hours at night.”
but he couldn’t do a thing, with Skeeter’s long nails pressing into the thin skin of his upper arm and sitting him down opposite of her so that she could drill him about everything he’d ever said or done, everything about his parents, about students and teachers. Her quill wrote down on parchment at rapid speed beside her. Harry just kept talking, feeling increasingly sick to his stomach. He hoped that once he said enough, she’d let him go. He hadn’t been in that cupboard since he’d come back the summer after first year, when the Dursley’s had finally let him have Dudley’s second bedroom. He had hated going near the stupid cupboard every day as he made his way to the kitchen to make breakfast. And here he was, hardly able to stand up straight even with his short stature, in a broom closet with a venomous woman who had a tight grip. When he was finally able to get out of the closet, Harry leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath.
One night instead of going to the Lake, Harry had gone out to see Hagrid. He knew the first task now: dragons. He supposed he’d stop by the Lake on his way back, he still had his cloak with him. And of course, Draco was there, looking lost as he stared at the lake water.
Harry sighed, and leaned back on his elbows, listening. The tree branches above them rustled in the night breeze. “Yeah, I do know what you mean.”
He left an hour before dawn, slipping the snake back into the grass and hissing a “goodbye” before making his way back into the castle.
Harry got up without complaint, “Y’know you didn’t have to come get me. Don’t bother getting in trouble because I couldn’t sleep last night.”
“Try not to die, I suppose. The usual.”
This story is dedicated to Gillian, one of my dearest friends who not only encouraged me to keep writing this story, but was also my first beta reader.
Harry was at the Lake, he hadn’t even waited for his dorm-mates to go to sleep, he hadn’t said anything at all about where he was going, and none of them had asked. He threw a rock into the water and watched the ripples spread out. He’d taken off his shoes and considered just diving into the lake for the giant squid to get him. Nothing could ever go right; he could never have a school year of peace. His feet were covered in sand. He wanted to pull out his hair, wanted to scream, wanted to yell, wanted to drown in the fucking lake because every time he tried to just be as normal as The Boy Who Fucking Lived could, every single time it fucked up, and someone was angry with him, and he was under pressure or in danger and –
“Oh, certainly.”
“What are you reading?” Harry asked him, turning around to actually look at Draco for the first time since they’d started sitting together at the Lake. “It doesn’t look like a textbook.”
“Sure,” Harry grinned as they made it into a small clearing. The space in the clearing seemed to be at a standstill. The grass was green and soft, no fallen leaves crunched beneath their feet. They couldn’t see any unicorns, but whatever Pansy had told Draco about a clearing seemed to be true. “Think you’ll be able to find your way here yourself, Malfoy?”
Draco felt like he was intruding. He felt horribly out of place with his back against a tree, spying on Harry Potter stargazing somberly in the middle of the night. He went to leave, and managed to trip over a tree root. Potter was up so quickly that Draco knew he’d been seen, though he ran back to the castle and hoped Potter would never, ever bring it up.
“It’s Shakespeare.”
Draco clutched Harry’s shirt like he was holding on for dear life. “Okay.” He whispered, closing his eyes. “Thank you.”
Draco’s lip trembled. “Yes.” He admitted. He rubbed his hands together.
“What’s it like?” Draco asked.
Sometimes Harry wondered what it would be like to be drunk. He was always filling his aunt and uncle’s wine glasses at dinner, or he would see Vernon drinking a beer after work. He thought about the times that Vernon smelled so much like alcohol when he breathed in Harry’s face that his nose would burn. He knew what it was like to see his aunt and uncle drunk (though Petunia only really drank hard on weekends), and he’d seen Dudley sneak a rare sip of wine – Harry himself had once taken a sip out of a nearly-empty beer bottle Vernon had fallen asleep on the couch with once. He hadn’t liked the taste.
“Ron!” Hermione gave the redhead a dirty look, “You don’t have to say it like that.”
the dragon, I just strategically avoided it –”
Sorry this chapter is short! Most chapters after this should be longer, this is just getting some more exposition out of the way :) I hope you're all enjoying this story so far, please let me know what you think! Comments mean more than you know <3
Of all the places for Rita Skeeter to pull him aside and interview him, she’d chosen a broom closet. Which was already uncomfortable of course, with Harry having to sit in such close proximity to the reporter, forced to breathe in the smell of her terrible flowery perfume mixed with the dust in the closet. Harry sneezed a few times. There’s also the fact of how much a broom closet is like a cupboard, and Harry’s immediate reaction of being grabbed and shoved into a small space is to
By the end of the week, Harry was home, and the Dursleys were the same as they always were, brash, awful, and demanding. Harry swept the floors and wondered how soon it would be until Voldemort tried to kill him again.
Draco couldn’t breathe. Harry looked about ready to punch him as soon as Filch left the corridor, and Draco was…well he was not a fighter, if the shiner Granger had given him last year said anything. “I,” he started to say, and Potter’s green eyes had never looked so dark, “I was coming back from the Owlery. I wasn’t – I wasn’t following you.”
“I didn’t put my name in that fucking cup, Malfoy.” Harry said, spinning on his heel to look at the taller boy standing behind him, “So if you’ve come here to take the piss, I’d
“Fine. Worried.” Draco looked at Harry. “Don’t die tomorrow.”
He was at the Lake, still in his suit from the dance. It was a cold night, but he’d warmed himself with a charm. It should be snowing someday soon. Harry sat with his head in his hands and took deep breaths, in and out. He knew Draco was there before the blond even said a word. “Stalking me now, are you?”
Harry’s body, possessed, jerking and broken and painful, his eyes rolled back into his skull and he was sure he would be dead. But he could hear their laughter. And then Harry was holding his wand again, and Voldemort was telling Harry to bow, and there was nothing but the feeling of his flesh being pulled apart pore by pore as they fought. Harry saw Cedric, and his parents, and the light surrounding them was golden and Harry felt as though he would go deaf from the sound of the Death Eaters, laughing and screeching like banshees at the sight. And then it was over, and Harry was running for the Cup – the Portkey – holding tight to Cedric’s body as the air around him screamed.
I hope you'll like it despite the short length ^^;
"Fine," Malfoy sighed. "Considering your affinity for bluntness, I'm going to take a page out of your book here."
"You like the colour of it," she echoed and this time she did sound amused. "You have an explanation for everything, don't you, Mister Potter?"
"So you've basically been dating for what, a month? And you're already having the meet the parents dinner?" Ron looked torn between laughing his arse off and being horrified; his grip on his Butterbeer tightening.
Mrs. Malfoy took a careful sip from her tea before she returned the cup to the table and crossed her ankles. "On the contrary, I think you'll be able to help me very well," she said lightly. "You see, Mister Potter, my son and I are quite close even at his age still. With our closeness I don't think it will surprise you to hear that we regularly exchange letters. A little while ago he told my me and my husband that he had found his mate and had started the courtship."
"That's most likely putting it lightly," Harry snorted and shook his head. "But your mother probably expected someone else to be your mate."
All he received in answer was a raised hand.
Melissa
"Of course I can cook," Draco said offended, scowling at him. "I'm perfect at Potions, why on earth wouldn't I be able to cook?"
Warnings: Hm, nothing special
. Finding our mate can be really difficult, so that
Of course some would say that dating Draco of all people might lead to trouble too, but well … Harry had never been good at staying out of trouble after all.
The bottom nearly brushed over the floor while the tips were at least a head taller than Malfoy himself and Harry caught himself wondering whether it was possible for the blond to actually fly with them. Could they bear his weight or were they just there to look pretty and impressive?
"I wasn't obsessed!" he protested immediately.
"They really are," Harry agreed softly. "How did you come across them?"
"Are you really going to behave this difficult about using my first name?" Instead of offended, Malfoy looked almost intrigued and amused at the same time.
"So far there doesn't seem to be any complaints, but he's also only been teaching for a week," Harry commented.
"Thank you," he said, glancing up at Draco, who looked back at him, "for showing me this."
They all watched it fly out of sight before Harry's eyes met Malfoy's and the man smirked. "Best out of five?"
Saturday evening saw Harry standing in front of his mirror, wondering whether he should change his outfit after all – a question he never thought he would ask himself.
"Well, I can fly with them," Draco said impatiently and his wings flapped a couple of times, stirring up some dead leaves behind his back. "So do you trust me enough to fly with me?"
"So impatient," Malfoy clucked his tongue, resting a hand on his hip.
"And that's enough, both of you," McGonagall said warningly. "Unless there are any further questions, you're both dismissed. Draco, the house elves should be finished bringing all your suitcases to your private rooms."
"Not so bad? Filius, just last week one of the Slytherins thought it would be funny to rip off the earmuffs of a Gryffindor whilst I was showing them how to repot Mandrake!" Sprout shot back annoyed. "I do not call that being easy!"
"Good guess, I suppose, but that wouldn't really narrow it down, right?" At once he realised just how rude that sounded and he hastily backtracked, flushing badly. "Wait, sorry, I didn't mean it like that! I just meant that the Malfoy family doesn't tend to be that close with a lot of others, right?"
Malfoy raised a finger to his lips and Harry opened his mouth, thoroughly incensed now, when he caught it too: the approaching footsteps of students on their way to their Potions class.
"So the whole noticing the eyes changing – that's also something only a mate can do," he commented, though he still didn't see any point in that. Why would it impress him that Draco was capable of changing his eye colour?
The failure to spot them again made him start doubting himself, questioning whether he hadn't imagined them in the end anyways, just like Hermione had suggested. He'd been so certain of it, though, and he heavily disliked the notion that he might be losing his mind. He hadn't survived so many years of being hunted down by Voldemort only to end up losing his mind over some possible imaginary wings now!
He bit down on his lip, hesitating to ask his next question. "Is it true that I can reject being his mate without something really bad happening to him? Like say, he won't die or so?" He winced when he saw her face momentarily twitching with pain, a grimace distorting her face.
There was probably some sort of meaning behind it; if Draco had just wanted to send flowers, he would have gone for the traditional roses most likely. That it was a carnation instead told Harry that this had to mean something but for now he was content to just appreciate the flower.
"Please don't start being obsessed over him again," she groaned and rubbed her temples.
As they ate, they talked about their classes and some of the more stubborn students who could benefit from a detention or two.
It made him laugh and he leant forwards to hug her, getting a face full of her curls. "Thanks, 'Mione, I really appreciate it."
Harry turned around, resting his hands behind him on the desk. Eyeing the light pink aster and the Lily of the Valley he'd persuaded Sprout to let him take from the greenhouses, he commented, "I see you've got my flowers."
"Wait, wait," Harry said baffled and waved his right hand as if that would make everything start making sense again. "What are you talking about, only a mate can see the wings? Are you saying I'm your mate?" His voice went a pitch higher at the end and any other time he'd be embarrassed about that, but all he could think about now was that nothing made sense.
"Where's Ron?" Harry asked, brushing off the soot and narrowly avoiding tripping and falling on his face when he stepped out of the fireplace.
"The same reason why you can see my wings and nobody else can," Malfoy answered lightly, but apprehension flitted across his face for a moment and his voice was almost flat when he continued, "Only a Veela's mate can see the wings. Only a Veela's mate notices our eyes change and only the mate can break out of the enchantment a Veela can put on someone. It's a bit ironic, all things considered. Everything meant to attract and lure people in is exactly what won't work on our own mate. The universe has a strange sense of humour, I suppose."
," she said; her voice carrying a vague apologising note. "I don't know whether you two will work out or not with the kind of '
was still attempting to wrap his mind around it. It was an odd concept to contemplate, him being Draco's Veela mate. He didn't know that much about Veela to start with, even though Bill was married to one, and he definitely hadn't expected to be a mate of one. But he was and it was going to take a bit of time to get used to that.
"I didn't expect you to get one representing my father as well," the blond remarked then, almost casually but his eyes were sharp.
"Not likely, bastard," Harry scoffed and pocketed his wand. "You send anything through my wards again and I can assure you, Malfoy, that's the last thing you'll ever do."
For all intents and purposes, it didn't appear as if Malfoy was planning something malicious and thus, Harry tried to forget the incident, because honestly, what would Malfoy even be able to do with wings?
That kind of defeated the point in having wards set up in the first place.
I hope you'll like it (despite the short length ...)
"Because it's you who sent them and there's no way you're just going to randomly sent a carnation and a daffodil," Harry replied deadpanned. "If you just wanted to give me flowers, you would have gone for roses."
"You're having way too much fun with this, you git," he muttered, but couldn't really stamp down the excitement brewing in the pit of his stomach.
"Malfoy."
"I don't think so, I know so," she said and she probably would have snorted if she'd been anyone else. "Contrarily to some of the more distasteful rumours, I know you're not naïve nor that stupid, Mister Potter. I thank you to give me the same respect."
"Or you could have just been patient and waited for me to be ready to inform you and father," Draco said irritated.
Now knowing that Draco could send presents through his wards Harry wasn't that freaked out by the presence of the carnation. Surprised, yes, but not freaked out anymore and he couldn't supress a smile when he picked up the flower and carefully touched its red petals.
"Don't hurt yourself, Potter," Malfoy muttered.
"Professor McGonagall wouldn't have hired him if she wasn't sure about his intentions, Ron," Hermione said, frowning.
"I'm afraid we're going to have to continue this conversation another time, Harry," Malfoy said lightly.
want this to work?"
"Prat," she said, but there was no heat in it and there was a faint smile playing around the corners of her mouth. "Be serious, what happened?"
Draco had chosen to wear a dark blue cloak and his shirt was a deep shade of red, contrasting against his black trousers.
Cuddles
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling owns it.
"I can't believe you're his mate," Ron said faintly, looking so pale Harry was becoming quite concerned that his friend was about to pass out soon. "You're sure he's not just messing with you? That'd be typical of him, trying to screw with your mind like that."
"Woo me," Harry echoed. "You do realise I'm not a girl, right?"
The Veela on the other hand was already present and grey eyes glittered faintly when they landed on Harry. "You look nice," Draco told him with a small smile.
"Beauty deserves to see beauty," Draco said simply and there was not even a hint of teasing in his voice.
They fell silent after that, but it wasn't an awkward or an uncomfortable silence as Harry had expected. It was quite amicable even, especially when taking into account the fact that he and Malfoy hadn't spoken in years to each other and before that, they had found themselves on opposite sides of the war.
"I can tell you several things that are wrong with Malfoy," Ron snorted.
Well, he couldn't really argue with that. At one point Draco would have to introduce him officially to his parents; they couldn't really go a whole life without meeting each other in that capacity after all.
He had no idea how late it was, only that it was definitely evening now, and his stomach was pleasantly filled with delicious food and even more delicious sweet wine. He hadn't exactly expected a picnic as their first date, but he had enjoyed it immensely nonetheless.
"Of course, who doesn't like flowers? What's their meaning, though?"
Only years five to seven had been really a problem at the start. They remembered the war all too well, most of them having fought in it, and they had been wary of having him as their professor. Some of the more problematic students had tried to catch him off guard during the practical lessons by attacking him with advanced dark spells, but he'd quickly put a stop to that by countering those with some darkish spells of his own. That had shocked them, he knew, because they had expected him not to know those kinds of spells, having considered him too
Harry waited until he heard the portrait click shut before he said, "I tried to distract her, but it didn't really work."
each other, competing just like in the old days.
"I'm being serious, Draco," Harry insisted and frowned. "Is he going to be really difficult about this? I don't want to come between you and your father."
other questions, ones you think you cannot ask '
"So I won't ever get a green gem from you?" Harry teased.
"Now who is the one remembering something from thirteen years ago, hm?" Harry raised an eyebrow and only now was he aware of the cheering and whooping happening at the stands.
Selene hooted softly, spreading out his wings as she ruffled her feathers.
"I thought she had stopped doing that?" Hermione said icily; her brown eyes turning frosty even through the flames.

After placing it in a vase, he took a quick shower, wanting to be in the Great Hall before too many students would try to clamp onto him and ask questions about their classes. He liked teaching, but some of the students really didn't understand that professors liked to be left alone when eating unless it was literally a life or death situation. With Voldemort no longer amongst the living, there was no life or death situations anymore and so Harry preferred to eat his breakfast in peace instead of trying to explain once again to one of his fifth years students why trying to blow up a Boggart wouldn't work.
It took a couple of seconds before Harry understood the innuendo and he blushed, smacking Draco's shoulder. "Are all Veela perverted or is it just you?"
"What else was I supposed to do?" Harry shrugged, leaning against the counter. "Clearly you hadn't told her yet and I wasn't about to out you."
"You sounded pretty pissed off last time we spoke," Malfoy said lightly. "I wasn't sure whether you would want to meet up after that."
He had expected the Veela to lead them to the gates from which they would Apparate to wherever their date took place, but to his surprise Draco instead started walking in the direction of the forest.
The nasty smile Harry gave him had him drawing up warily. "Oh, I'm sure she'll make an exception if she hears you go around, breaking through heavy wards. Especially given the implications attached to that. Have a nice day,
"You look to be in a fine mood this morning, Harry," McGonagall said good-naturedly, pulling him out of his reverie.
Having his feet trapped within the floor the first time he'd forgotten to warn her had been more than enough to never forget the warning again.
"Just for that for our next date I'll show up dressed in red and golden," Harry informed him and narrowed his eyes when Draco started to smirk. "What's that look for?"
"You sound sceptic that this will work, but mark my words, Harry," Draco leant closer and brushed his fingers against Harry's, "I will woo you so thoroughly you won't want anyone else ever again."
The mystery bit was ten times more interesting than his classes, though, he wouldn't deny that.
"With the eyes' part then, I guess," he mumbled, his eyebrows drawn together.
"If she did, she would have been here before you would have found the first flower even," Draco scoffed.
"Right, so you think you know who it is?" he questioned, forcing himself to sound light.
"Giant spiders?" Draco muttered but shook his head. "You'll see soon. It's actually not that far into the forest. I didn't want to disturb anything dangerous."
Hermione tilted her head to the left. "Still with George. There were some problems with a couple of the deliveries apparently and they're trying to sort it out. Not that I mind having you over, but what are you doing here? Tomorrow is still a school day, no?" she questioned bemused.
"I don't like the attention that me being there brings," Harry corrected him. "But if you want to go to such a restaurant, I wouldn't mind. Your company would be a hell of a lot better than some of the politicians I had to sit with after the war."
"Come, come, Pomona, they're not so bad anymore!" Flitwick admonished her humming. "Why, I daresay they haven't been this easy in years!"
Especially if that involved kissing Draco.
Some of the female students actually seemed to really appreciate that Malfoy had taken over the Potions position. Harry supposed he couldn't really fault them for that. For all that Malfoy could be a real arrogant bastard at times, he'd always been rather good looking and he definitely had grown into his pointy face. Now he had a jaw and cheekbones that could cut glass and more than once already Harry had heard girls sighing about how wonderfully intense Malfoy's grey eyes looked.
"Sounds like someone else I know," Harry said teasingly, relaxing when Draco clucked his tongue and gently smacked his hip.
"Because there's a difference between creating potions and making edible food," Harry said lightly. "I can cook for example, but I can't make potions to save my life."
They had already proven that they could work together as colleagues – how much more difficult could it be to make dating work out?
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
Harry told himself the stinging heat in his cheeks was because of the wind and definitely not because of the compliment. Definitely the wind, yeah.
"We're going to have a picnic?" Harry asked amazed, halting in front of the blanket.
All of a sudden Draco took a turn to the left and right as Harry was about to ask whether they were going somewhere in particular, the Veela slowed down to a stop and nodded to the ground.
"That's funny," Harry smiled thinly. "I could say the same about you. Thought you might pull your stunt from first year again, remember?"
He glanced at the clock and hummed thoughtfully. It wasn't even ten o'clock yet, but if he Floo called them now, there was no way they would stop talking soon, especially not once they heard that Draco was about to court him. That news might actually sent them in a fit and he smiled wryly, folding the letter. Yes, probably best to wait until tomorrow before he would inform them of his news.
The dark haired man spread out his hands. "Well, you said you would finally start explaining things, so I'm here and I'm ready to listen. What's up with your wings, your eyes and your odd behaviour in general?"
"Of course they will," she said confidently, pushing her bushy hair over her shoulders again. "I've been there before and really, why would they suspect that I'm planning to look up information about a certain family instead of looking up records for my cases?" Her voice was overflowing with innocence, but her brown eyes were positively gleaming and there was a faint smirk curling up her lips.
"Well, do you? You've been mainly speaking from your Veela side, but do you as a whole want this to work between us?" Harry waved between the two of them. "Because just as much as you don't want me to choose you out of pity, I don't want you to choose me if you don't like me at all. Mate or no mate, that would just lead to us both being miserable."
"I suppose not, though I don't know what he was aiming for with his eyes either," he replied, rubbing his left arm. "He looked like he was expecting me to break whatever he was doing, but if so, why try it in the first place, whatever he did?"
Author's note: Apologies for the delay! I had to do some research for this story and that was difficult to combine with my exams. This weekend was kind of exhausting as well, but I pushed through to finally update this story again! Once again, my apologies for the delay!
"I had a lot of fun tonight," Harry smiled as they halted near the dungeons. It was already nearing eleven p.m. and the only ones still awake were some ghosts wandering about, not deigning them worthy of a glance.
Ignoring the jab, Harry started filling his plate with mashed potatoes. "I've never done anything out of pity and I'm certainly not about to start with you now," he retorted. "Not that popular with the other professors, huh?"
"Look," he murmured; his voice barely audible above the noises of the wind.
She tilted her head to the left. "I suppose," she replied contemplatively. "The sensing does not work with timestamps, '
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
The other man hummed thoughtfully. "How much do you know about Veela?"
She sighed softly. "I know a bit about your '
He selected three books which looked the most promising in the herbology section and made his way to one of the more private nooks of the library. It was in a rather dark corner, hidden away behind an aisle of stuffy old history books and barely any student sought out this place, which made it the perfect spot for Harry. He liked his students, but some of them were incredibly nosy and he knew all too well how fast rumours could spread in this school. The last thing he needed was to be badgered about why he would need to know the meaning of flowers. Especially the girls could be a tad too insistent with their questions.
“And yet here you are.” Harry said.
“This doesn’t make any sense, Malfoy.” Harry flapped his arms uselessly in the water, keeping his feet planted firmly in the mud. The water wasn’t even up to his shoulders. “Can’t I just like…doggy paddle or something?”
“You could always take Granger. Though I’m sure any girl would love to have you.”
“Are you worried?”
“Felt weird, I don’t know. I don’t usually…talk about myself.” Draco rubbed his hands together. “I mean, I talk about myself, yes, but not really if that makes sense. I don’t know I just – it felt weird to talk about it, especially with – well, especially with you.” Draco turned his gaze away from Harry, to look at the trees.
“Are you volunteering?” Harry asked. “To talk to me? Because I don’t know if I want it. After all, I wouldn’t want to be hanging around with
It was nightfall. Hedwig sat in her cage, beak between her feathers when her eyes opened wide. There was another owl at the window. A brown horned owl, carrying a letter attached by a green ribbon to its leg. Harry opened his window, quickly, snatched the letter. He knew who it was from before he even opened the thing.
