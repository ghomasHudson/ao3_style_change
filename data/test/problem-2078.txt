"No," Haley said, finally looking up. She didn't know where her sudden confidence had come from. And as soon as she looked into her godfather's grey, curious eyes she felt like a scared little girl again. It was a bit unsettling how much the colour reminded her of Malfoy's eyes. She had never really noticed that before. But what was she thinking? He would never understand the truth. If she said one more word, she would lose him. The realisation brought tears to her eyes, her fingers were clasped together tightly in her lap, and her chin began to tremble. She had to stop this. Here and now.
, right?" The Slytherin asked again, as if he had to make sure she wasn't tricking him. What a funny thought. She wasn't the one who went around tricking people.
He didn't even have to think about that. "No," he replied too quickly, snatching the mitten from her hand and clutching it to his chest. Mittens or not, they were
The boy only grunted, which could have meant anything. But Haley was sure he'd be more responsive once they weren't in the vicinity of the quidditch field any more.
The boy stepped right in front of Hermione and looked her straight in the eyes. "Of course, they do. We even pay them and inform them about the whole process, possible risks and side effects beforehand."
"What happened? Are you okay? Did someone hurt you? Was it that bastard?" Sirius shot question after question at her, not even giving her time to answer.
“If it’s nothing important why did you run away, then?” He countered. Why couldn’t he just let it go?
He places down the amber one and picks up one of the green stones. Then he grabs the amber one again, frowning.
"Ron, I told you not to-" Hermione started, then stopped herself. Both of them were looking at her strangely. Luna let go of her glasses and smiled at the newcomers cheerfully. "We're all done. I'm sorry for keeping you. You have to go all the way down to Professor Hagrid's, right?"
With three spoons of sugar in Malfoy's case. Haley grinned softly, as she absently took a bite from her treacle tart. Treacle tarts were usually really sweet but she imagined Malfoy's tea was even sweeter. By now he was at his fifth spoon of sugar! Did he have a sweet tooth? The thought was strangely endearing. Either that or he didn't realise how much sugar he was spooning into his cup. Haley felt herself grin as the boy lifted his cup to his mouth and took a sip. It didn't seem like he was surprised at the taste.
"Yes?" He urged, his fingers coming up to trace the outline of her lips, as if the words were written there.
She shook her head. Malfoy sighed, running his hand across his face. He was probably relieved as well.
"If your singing skills are anything close to the way you kiss, I won't need much convincing." She whispered in between kissing him, tangling her fingers thoroughly in his short hair. She felt him smile against her lips. It filled her with warmth and something fluttery. It was a strange feeling. But she wanted to keep feeling it. And maybe that was even stranger.
. Instead she took another sip of that delicious pumpkin juice. As soon as she had allowed the thought it had unlocked all kinds of feelings inside her.
"I'm sure it was just a dream," she mumbled frantically, trying to convince herself. "Neville would never… He'd never do something like this. Not even to Malfoy." The gentle way in which he handled plants and other people simply told an entirely different story. But then… she suddenly remembered another dream. Weeks ago… where he'd had a fight with Draco. Where he'd taunted and ridiculed him. Draco had tried to fire spell after spell at Neville but his wand hadn't worked. But perhaps it meant nothing. Perhaps it was just that he felt insecure compared to the Gryffindor…
When she turned back to Draco he watched her brother in a strange disapproving way. He couldn't be jealous of him, could he?
Haley nodded. "Yeah, of course. After that Ron treated him much better. He even used him to confirm Pig wasn't another fraud…"
During breakfast on Saturday Haley's eyes kept flicking toward Neville who was sitting a few seats away. What if he knew something? Should she just ask him? But what if she was completely wrong about all of this and she was worrying for nothing? Or what if she was right and he knew nothing? Did she have the right to expose Draco like that?
He wanted to run back to her. Wanted to wrap her up in his arms and forget everything they'd fought over. But it wasn't that easy. Not this time.
"Fine. How about… um… how about…" He trailed off, never finishing his sentence. A faint blush was littering his pale face, making Haley wonder what he had been thinking about.
It wasn't a date! Haley wasn't nervous at all. She was mostly curious because she had no idea what she was supposed to expect. All he had told her was that he would come get her once she had got rid of her friends. Whatever that was supposed to mean. Was he hiding somewhere near the Hog's Head?
I have found out enough for now. It doesn't take long to reach my door. As I reach for the door handle I try not to wonder what it means that Malfoy's dream door is this close to mine.
The next morning, Haley was almost overwhelmed by all the people enthusiastically greeting her. Besides Hermione, Ron and Ginny, it was quite the surprise to be met with the dreamlike appearance of Fleur Delacour. It seemed like the last time they'd seen each other was a lifetime ago.
Hello everyone! I'm sorry this took so long... Blame my muse. I literally had to start writing this chapter three times because I wasn't satisfied with the first two drafts... But I think it turned out okay, the way it is now :) Leave me your thoughts and stay safe! Also, feel free to bribe my muse, so maybe the next chapter will come easier ;)
"I mean – at first I kinda was spying on you but later I came back because I liked spending time with you. So – it wasn't really spying at all."
"When were you planning to tell me about your spying?" He asked, for the first time there was a spark of emotion visible on his face.
"You know," Haley replied after a moment. "You really don't always have to be that brutally honest. Sometimes, it's perfectly fine to sugar-coat things."
"Of course he did," Haley mumbled, shaking her head at the boy lying in her bed. At least he looked peaceful. At least he didn't seem like he was in pain any more. She brought up her free hand to catch a stray eyelash from the tip of his nose.
"What. Did. You. See?" He burst out angrily. Then he grabbed her chin and made her finally meet his gaze. He looked at her for no longer than a few seconds. Then he let go of her face. Something he'd seen on her face seemed to confirm his worst fears.
"if you're sure," Lily replied. "I guess, then it's time for…" She nodded at Snape who had already spooned some of the Resurgence Draught into two cups and was now handing one to each of the boys.
seeing made him almost livid. The prat was touching her. He was touching his favourite Gryffindor! How dare he?
"What's wrong?" Michael asked. But when she didn't answer he turned around to see what it was that had her frozen in place.
Later, when Haley woke up, she wondered why the window was open. A soft breeze was washing into the room, blowing up the curtains around her bed. And on her chest, she found a single, white feather.
"Um… do you mind if I head back without you? I really don't want to miss lunch," Ron explained with a look on his watch.
The man walked over to the cauldron, from which the steam was wafting over and stirred it slowly with the ladle inside it. "It is done." He replied calmly, before turning to Draco. "It has taken almost a year to work out the details. But now it is done. Are you willing to try it?"
"Talk to me." He urged, stroking his thumb across her cheek gently. "I need you… I need you to come back to me."
He pushes his cone into my free hand, leans forward and cups my face in his hands. His eyes sweep across my face in a way that seems almost appraising. Like he's found a new promising broom or something. "I really,
Otherwise I'd wake up before I even found Malfoy's door. I turn around and try to trace my steps back. I only took right turns, so it shouldn't be too hard to find my way back.
and she forgot everything around her and would probably even sell out her own grandmother. For the greater good.
"Keep it as a good luck charm," Haley offered. Hopefully, her dad wouldn't miss it. Much. It was one of his favourites. He had caught it during one legendary game after only seven seconds. Hence, the name.
Somehow these words made her shudder. Still, she replied, "So? It can't be that scary. I'm not afraid of some vow. I've faced a dragon. And worse." The past months had certainly been like hell. "How does it work? What happens when it's broken?"
Legilimency. No matter how Snape described it, to Haley this sounded like mind-reading. So, did that mean he was going to teach her how to mind-read? Or hadn't he said something about protecting her mind from outside intruders? Like Voldemort? She really didn't like what he was telling her about her special connection to Voldemort's mind. And even worse, the dark magician was aware of their connection? And was likely trying to use it and make her his little marionette? She shuddered.
"But we haven't heard the rest of the story yet!" Haley protested, raising her arm and almost upsetting her plate. "Or have we?"
I'm in the dungeons at Hogwarts. In front of me I can see a crowd of students who are standing around something. As I get closer I notice that they are standing around
Simon shakes his head, but there is still a sad tinge to his wide blue eyes. "I just wish it could have been my own decision… telling her, you know?"
"You heard that, too, right?" She whispered worriedly. Before he could answer she pushed him off her, firmly but not ungently, and got to her feet.
Haley squinted her eyes at the boy in disbelief. "Do you expect me to believe that?" She asked sceptically. What did he take her for?
"Do you… hate the idea of going to Hogsmeade with me?" Malfoy questioned, resting his hands on the table on each side of her and leaning far into her personal space. The git was playing dirty. How was she supposed to think straight when his glinting eyes were the only thing she saw? Haley swallowed thickly.
I tiptoe over to my door and slowly push down the handle. I open the door and find… nothing but an empty corridor! Yes! That means I have all the time in the world to explore the-
"Mother? Is that you? Am I allowed to go out again?" Asks a child's voice from behind the curtains that go all around the bed. Wait, is that Malfoy's voice? But I haven't heard it sound like this in at least four years.
For a second, there was confusion crossing over the boy's features. But before long it was replaced with a mocking grin. "You need to try harder if you're trying to make me laugh."
"Were you planning… on getting me something for Christmas?" She asked, straight to the point. She didn't have the patience tonight for beating around the bush.
As Haley almost ran around the corner she didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. If there had been a student leaning against the wall, she would have run past without taking notice of them. She would have run past if that person hadn't been clearing their throat importantly. Even then, she wouldn't have looked back.
. No more threatening than a little kitten. He seemed like a whole different person. Where was the infuriating git that had played stupid pranks on her on a daily basis? Not that she missed him but it was strange all the same.
"Haley, you can't!" Hermione protested. "You agree, don't you, Ron?" She turned to the boy who had more or less silently watched the conversation. He looked away, escaping her intense gaze and studied the logs in the fire. Basically, this was him disagreeing with Hermione. It was great to know that he was on her side again.
She sends me a smug grin. "Or he'll cower in fear. Either way, be sure to tell me whether it worked."
"You should go," he muttered, turning away from her, ready to shut the world out once more. To shut himself off.
"Or Simon's coach at the last game-" Haley stopped herself, hearing an almost inaudible sigh from her side.
He was rubbing his face against her neck. Why was he rubbing his face against her neck? It hadn't even been a conscious decision. Was that still the cat left inside him? And wasn't he mad at the girl? Abruptly he rolled off her and sat up. He scowled, crossing his arms and looking away.
"I like this table. Nobody ever comes here, so I can do my homework in peace, without having people steal my notes or hiding the books I need." The way in which she stated these facts sounded strangely neutral. She wasn't looking for pity or help. It was just the way things were.
"Well… considering we're trying to revive his magic with this potion, a reaction like that really isn't surprising," Lily mused. "Strong magic like that takes its toll on the body."
! Just imagine, what if the spell hadn't worn off? I would have walked around on those stupid paws forever!" He said angrily.
"Lunch?" The curtain around Draco's bed was drawn open with a forceful swoosh, revealing a cheerful Madam Pomfrey. "Don't tell me you're planning to leave before having breakfast? It does get boring around here, eating by myself all the time."
Haley sighed, wondering how on earth she'd get him to believe her. Then she reached into her hair and pulled off her hair tie. "Here." She said, rolling it over his wrist. "You can walk into my dreams with it. Figure out if I'm lying or not." It was like giving him permission into her mind. Into her subconscious. To sift through her deepest secrets. Now, she was the one feeling vulnerable.
Haley chuckled. "No," she said. "Not really. I'm not even sure I believed half the things he said that night." There was a faraway look on her face. Far away in memory land.
… And some things never changed, Haley thought to herself, while she watched Ron and Hermione seemingly fight just for the sake of fighting.
"I'm just – I'm so– I – shit!" He sighed, stumbling over his words. "I just wanted… to say…" He ran a hand through his hair. Was he nervous? "You can come to me… next time you can't sleep. I know what it's like to have nightmares – I mean when you can't sleep. I could… I could sing you a lullaby."
"Let me go!" Haley hissed. Her arms were pressed to the wall and she was furiously trying to free her wrists from Malfoy's too tight grip.
"I don't know. For what possible reason might I have asked such a question?" He asked in return. He wasn't looking at her, but she could practically hear him roll his eyes.
"After S-Sirius… I… I…" Her voice shook terribly. "I didn't know what to do – I – It was all too much – I couldn't think straight – I didn't know what to do – and then those dreams… it felt like I was going mad…"
her problem? She had an idea. But it seemed impossible. There had to be something else. She had to remember to ask her after class. Or perhaps after dinner. But then she remembered that something else was awaiting her after dinner. Her dreaded extra lessons with Snape. How did the saying with the fire and the frying pan go again?
"Oh, the usual," Haley answered. "Lots of sweets, books, a brand new Weasley jumper," she laughed, holding up a bottle green jumper with a golden
"Only if you're not mad?" The other girl said it like a question. For a moment, she watched her friend, taking in her whole form. She was still her best friend. Even though she'd hid all of this for such a long time. Had she been dealing with all of this on her own?
They had barely started on their assignments, when Hermione had declared she couldn't answer one of the questions without looking up a date Binns had mentioned in their fourth year. And being Hermione, she had of course kept her notes from all of their previous years and brought them with her to Hogwarts. It hadn't been more than five minutes since she had left to fetch her notes from their dorms. Naturally that resulted in Ron, dozing off on the table and Haley absently doodling on the margin of the parchment.
She couldn't let him ask her these questions. Sirius had told her, hadn't he? That he might be using her to gather information about the Order? And that she was supposed to ditch him the moment she doubted his intentions only slightly? That's why she had panicked. Because she didn't
He beamed. Then he reached under the table and placed a bowl of ice cream in front of her. "The one that never melts," he explained. "Hermione said you looked like you need a pick me up, so I thought… well, here. It's pumpkin and cinnamon. With huge chocolate chunks. I already tried it. It's amazing!"
"There's a letter for you." Mrs Weasley announced the following morning. For a frightened second, Haley wondered if it was for her. If it was from
According to the map, the boy was now walking down the staircase that lead into the dungeons. He would be here in a few moments. And seeing as it was almost curfew, the hall was unsurprisingly deserted. Why on earth had she thought this was a good idea? As if Malfoy would suddenly leave her alone in exchange for a cupcake.
Haley shook her head, continuing into the hallway. They passed a couple of occupied class rooms until there was finally one to the left that seemed empty.
"I don't want power from it." The golem sounded a bit like a dementor. Why did all these creatures always want everyone's souls? At least this one offered something in return.
Haley could have kissed him. Again. Or maybe hugged him. That was a lot less inappropriate. Or awkward.
Hermione stared at her. Speechless for the second time in less than five minutes. "What are you even saying?" She breathed.
She blinked at him, as if she'd just woken from a dream. "He's dead." She chuckled darkly. "Yes… and whose fault is that?"
"Then what do we do?" Haley whispered. "We can't just let him suffer like this! Can't we make him return the magic?"
"It was him who told Dobby about it," Haley insisted. "He also slipped me a note, telling me to meet him by the kitchens, which is where Dobby found me and gave me the gillyweed."
The light. Haley saw it vanishing from his eyes. The sight scared her. She squeezed his hand, trying to provide some sort of comfort.
"But who…?" Hermione frowned, shooting her a sceptical glance. She looked around, as if trying to search for a person who might match her rumpled appearance. "You don't mean to say," she mumbled finally, her voice sinking to a whisper. "You didn't… you know… with
His thumb was drawing half-circles onto the back of her hand, making her skin tingle. This wasn't the first time she was holding his hand but it was the first time it made her feel closer to him somehow. She didn't imagine there were a lot of people he would actually allow to touch him. Let alone, hold his hand. It made her want to hold onto it and never let go.
"So, long story short, I spied on the boy while he was dreaming and found out about his secret. After I told him, he never bothered me again. Well… mostly. Hair tie?"
"I hate him," Haley said to herself, refusing to watch him go. Why was she always losing to him? Why couldn't she have the upper hand for once? As she picked up her journal that was now wet and muddied and most probably ruined – her journal where she wrote down quotes and song lyrics and sketched ideas for paintings that reflected her innermost thoughts and beliefs – a sudden anger stirred inside her. She had let Malfoy push her around for so long. How much longer was she going to let him get away with it? The page was opened to a selection of song lyrics.
"I told you things about me as well, you know?" She said quietly. "Don't you remember?" His hand was right there, lying on the couch between them. Haley's fingers were itching to reach over and touch him. But she didn't know if she was allowed to. Was Draco still mad? Would he pull his hand away?
The simplicity of her words and the genuine compassion behind them completely disarmed her. After all… Luna knew what it was like to lose someone who was close to her. It was too hard to keep up the fight. So Haley finally gave up and let the wave of pain crush over her. She cried for what seemed like hours. Cried for Sirius. Who had been screwed over by fate so many times. For Cedric Diggory. Who had been much too young to die. And for Draco. Who deserved so much better.
"Great!" Ron said and continued to eat. It was Hermione who reminded them that there was something else inside the package.
"That's what I wanna know." I pick up a small paint brush and stare at the blue wall in front of me. The brush pulls my hand toward the wall like its magnetic. I'm not sure if I'm the one starting to paint or if its the brush's doing. But after a moment there is a portrait of a blond Slytherin on the wall. He doesn't look happy. Instinctively, I reach out a hand to touch the image but that seems to make paint-Draco only grumpier.
He was right, though. She wouldn't be here if she didn't want to be. She was here and she would keep coming back because this boy had planted something in her heart. Strange foreign seeds that were slowly starting to bloom.
," he continued, wiggling his eyebrows and making her blush. "I decided to do my own research. You know, following the guy around, reading his letters and watching him, whenever he thought no one was looking."
. There's nothing else between us. Nothing!" She was starting to get an idea why her friend was so invested in this.
Before Haley could blink, she was harshly grabbed by the wrist and pulled into an empty class room behind her.
Lovegood tapped a biscuit to her chin. "I think…in these times, we need all the protection we can get. It's why I gave one to Haley as well."
What? Haley shook her head, refusing to accept this explanation. All that time… All her worries… All of the time spent doubting herself…
"Exactly," Haley said, as she placed a slice of blueberry pie onto her plate. She picked up a piece with her fork and brought it up to her mouth. It tasted delicious.
The rest of her words rushed out of her mouth like a tumbling river that had been contained for too long, "who makes my life a living hell! He's always there, tripping me up, calling me names, taunting me, messing up my potions and – and –" There was more, but before she could continue, she had to calm down somewhat or else she was going to bite her tongue off.
went." She shot her a pointed look, implying that he was actually asking about her Occlumency lesson.
"I'll look after him for you, sis," Simon piped up, appearing by her side, as if he had read her thoughts. He really was the sweetest. Although there were still butter clumps stuck to his nose.
"Seriously, have you heard of chewing!" Hermione admonished, rolling her eyes at the boy. Ron gaped at her, causing the girl to grab his chin and shut his mouth. The boy blinked at her, his cheeks turning a soft pink. Hermione went back to her coffee.
, Haley thought, after she had finally completed the last evening of detention on Friday night. Would the wound on her right hand ever completely heal again? Her skin was burning like crazy. And as if that wasn't enough, she was practically asleep on her feet. Her nights with Umbridge had forced her to try and finish all of her homework until late into the night. She didn't remember the last night she'd slept more than four hours.
He was locked. In this infernal bathroom. He didn't know for how long he had been sitting here. Worrying. It might have been hours. The waiting was the worst. Making his imagination run wild, painting scenarios of Haley being tortured or dying in all kinds of brutal ways.
Had it been too much to ask? He would have forgiven her. For openly defaming his father. For dragging his name through the mud. He would have tried at least. He would have – but had it really been too much to ask? For her to be on his side for once. For her to try and understand
How stupid of her. It was best she got on her way or the night would be over before she even reached the Entrance Hall.
"Didn't mess with her quidditch skills. She was amazing today!" Ron commented. Haley didn't remember. The quidditch training had gone by in a hazy blur.
to him… He licked lips that seemed awfully dry. Suddenly, he wished they were not up in the air but somewhere he could properly
Waiting was one of the most tedious activities ever invented. At least he didn't have to wait outside somewhere. Actually, it was quite nice in Madam Puddifoot's VIP lounge. But still. He had wanted to spend the whole day with Haley and now it was already past three. Where was she? What was she doing? She wasn't out with another guy, was she? No. She'd said her friend needed her. But on Valentine's Day? Perhaps she was seeing another guy after all. Or maybe something had happened? Should he go out and look for her?
Haley almost choked on her butterbeer. Hermione Granger? Stumbling over words? This had to be a once in a life time occurrence! Her face that was filled with worry and guilt made Haley feel terrible for sulking a good part of the evening.
in every single subject! I can’t wait to tell father!” He looks as if he’s about to burst with joy. Then I find myself in a bone-crushing embrace, feeling the joy spread over to me, as if he had slapped it onto my skin with his touch.
She turned around in his arms, so she could look at his face. "You should have cheered louder. Maybe we would have won then." Her arms came up to his shoulder, where her fingers started to play with the soft strands of his hair.
The girl's eyes widened and she tilted her head to the side curiously. Then she chuckled softly. "Veelas are magical creatures," she said like that explained anything. Before he could ask her what that was supposed to mean, she sent him a mysterious little smile and continued walking toward the castle. To be frank, Ron didn't know what any of this meant. But he had the feeling that some of the disappointments that had been weighing him down were slowly beginning to disappear.
"Do you think… do you think it's okay to reveal someone's secrets if the person has been a real jerk to you?"
"So…" the boy said again, shuffling his feet on the ground. "Is there perhaps… something in your bag… for me?" He asked, his gaze dropping to where her bag was lying on the ground.
"If you want to be really sure, I think you should simply ask her." The girl repeated patiently without batting an eyelash.
Harry took a bite of his toast and watched as they both stared at him, waiting for some sort of response. His chewing grew slower and his eyebrow raised higher until finally he sighed in frustration
Draco shrugged "I'm just keeping up appearances. People will think it's weird if we suddenly start being nice to each other"
"Come here" Harry growled, sharply pulling out and tugging Draco by his hair across to the bathroom sink. Draco steadied himself placing his hands on the sink edge while Harry backed up behind him.
Draco climbed off the bed, wiping his sleeve across his eyes in the the process. He stormed across the room filled with anger, biting back the pain. Draco grabbed his jacket and shoes and Harry clambered off the bed after him
Draco nodded and prepared himself. He was uncertain on how far he could take it, but aching to feel it all. He placed his arms out in front of him and shifted his weight onto them, lifting himself from the bedding until he was on all fours, looking down at his hands
Harry slipped his fingers underneath the tie around Draco's mouth and pulled it down, leaning forward to catch Draco's lips with his own. He kissed him gently, their eyes closing in a moment of quiet reflection before smiling together as Harry stroked Draco's cheek
He turned to finally face Malfoy who was busy washing himself under the water. Harry looked across the room to him, ready to argue back but his words fell short. He froze, catching sight of a naked Malfoy from behind, his perfectly toned arse and slender legs, shoulder blades poking out from his back as he scrubbed up his arms and the water ran down him gracefully. Fuck he looked good.
Harry held his gaze for a moment, ensuring he wasn't just being played for an idiot, but Draco's reaction to him was real, and he loved it. He brought his hands down to his waist and held him against the door, Harry stood with one leg between Draco's, their groins pressed together, he could feel Draco's aching cock
Draco bit his lip as Harry spoke, feeling pleasure pulsating to his groin, desperate for release. Harry didn't realise that he was describing Draco's dirtiest little fantasy
Draco slumped against the door, exhausted and confused about how he was feeling. He was already craving more from Harry. He'd never once mentioned anything about his submission kink. Spending countless nights touching himself, fantasizing about being somebody's bitch, being helpless and humiliated and fucked generously. If Harry was willing to give him everything he'd dreamed of and more, how could he say no?
"Our naughty little secret" Harry whispered, brushing his fingers over Draco's lips as he stepped backward away from him. He grabbed his school bag and slung it over his shoulder, adjusting the erection still in his trousers before heading out the door, winking at Draco with a mischievous smile on his way out
Draco took a steady breath to control his emotions and though he was practically forcing his eyes to the floor, he couldn't resist glancing across to the Gryffindor table. It was like getting his next fix. He was elated seeing Harry for a split second before the hurt and heartache resurfaced and took over
Harry hesitated, turning to Hermione to gauge her opinion. She broke into a smile and shrugged "It could happen"
"Draco, why are you doing this? What we just did was incredible, please don't ruin it now" Harry pulled his hand away, bringing his arms to his chest. Draco looked at him with longing but his throat felt tight, tears stung the back of his eyes
Draco took a second swig behind her back then replaced the cork and left it on the side. He so desperately wanted to down the entire bottle if it meant not caring about bumping into Potter all night. He swallowed the nerves that were rising in his stomach and let the drink do it's work, hoping that by the end of the night, he would have forgotten about him completely.
Harry began kissing down Draco's neck, licking across the love bites he'd already given him earlier in the day. He could hear as Draco was breathing heavy beneath him, stifling moans of pleasure. Draco was aching for more as he tangled his fingers through Harry's hair feeling his cock pushing against him
Harry closed his eyes and took a long breath, attempting to piece together the conflict "What we have here is amazing, Draco. I never planned to be here with you but it's happened now. Why can't we just enjoy it in the moment and leave it at that?"
Green-tinted oil lamps hung sporadically across the walls, floating candles flickered in the air above and the usual features stood scattered across the room; a chess table with chairs, study desks, book shelves, a trophy cabinet surrounded by swords and armour.
As he reached the top of the steps away from the main crowd, Harry caught sight of Draco and stopped dead, seeing him perched on the side of the leather armchair, one leg kicked up by his chest, the other swinging loosely at the ground as he sipped his drink with ease and met Harry's eyes
They finally pulled apart breathlessly, Harry pushed himself up so he was sitting against the headboard, Draco in front of him cross-legged. Harry ran a hand through his hair and reached for his glasses.
"That's right" Harry smirked, stroking Draco's cock with one hand and gracing the entrance to his hole with the other "What are you?"
"You've been such a naughty Slut, haven't you?" Harry stood over him, unbuckling his belt and sliding it from his trousers
Pansy hastily joined them on the bed, sitting cross-legged and placing a comforting hand on Draco's leg, leaning in and looking deeply into him as though trying to read his mind, waiting for his response
Draco quietly slipped from the common room, making his way to the room of requirement for his usual meet up with a certain Gryffindor. Harry had been occupying his mind every single day; during classes, over mealtimes, particularly through the nights alone where he would use a silencing charm on his bedroom and proceed to scream out Harry's name as he stroked himself to orgasm
"Impedimenta!" Haley didn't hesitate a second. He wouldn't have hesitated either. For a moment she wondered if she was supposed to feel bad about it… Then the man reappeared in her sight, pointing his wand at them, face an ugly mask of anger.
She smiled at him fondly, taking in the hard wall he was leaning against and the cold stone floor they were sitting on. How could he just fall asleep in a place like this?
"Uh." Right that's what I told him last time. Why does he remember that? "M-my little brother. He's ten."
"Haley, wait-" Ginny's voice called after her but it was too late. She was already rushing through the Oak Doors.
Her fingers curled around the letter protectively. Would it be okay to open it here? After all, it had been sent to George… She decided to read it. George wouldn't have given it to her during breakfast if it wasn't safe, right?
Then he finally broke the silence without cursing him. "You seriously need to learn when to speak and when to be quiet. You do realize that you cannot prove a single thing you just claimed?" He didn't wait for Draco to answer. "I will do what I can. You however will remain here and refrain from doing anything remotely stupid."
"Malfoy," she gasped under her breath. He was lying on his side with his eyes closed. Was he breathing? Cold dread filled her. "Malfoy?" She repeated, her voice sounding like delicate glass. He didn't respond. Or open his eyes. Nothing. Haley panicked. What was she supposed to do? Was she supposed to turn him or something like that? She carefully turned him over onto his back. But still there was nothing. He was just lying there as if he was sleeping. It looked almost peaceful except for the trickling of blood next to his temple. She hadn't seen that before. She was only making it worse!
It's just me… and Malfoy. Who's fixing me with a weary look. I didn't think this through. What in Merlin's name am I supposed to do now?
"And the time is up. Please, put down your quills, students." With a swish of her wand, Professor Marchbanks collected all of the parchments at once.
"It's a boring story. You wouldn't be interested." She deflected. Which was a lie. Too personal. That's what it was. Too revealing.
"Your hands, they're..." she started to say but somehow it felt stupid to just ask in such a straight forward way.
Draco grimaced. Had that really been Potter? But Potter usually didn't talk in such a way! She screamed, cursed, declared, hissed. Sometimes her voice sounded sarcastic or mocking and recently he'd heard her whisper and even
"Well…It's kind of the opposite." She admitted. "I don't want to pretend to be someone else. I wish we didn't have to. It would be nice… if we could just go on a date without worrying about other people seeing us together."
His ears were turning a fiery red. "I said we should go there, right? I mean, people go there when they're on a date, don't they? But then Hermione said… she said '
There. She finally found his name on her map. He was just entering the common room. She threw the map back onto her bed, slipped the chocolate frog card she had found while looking for the map into her pocket, and left the dormitory. She caught sight of his red hair, just when he was about to enter his own dorm. The girl swiftly followed him, slipping into the room before the door closed.
Hermione's eyes widened as if she had heard her thoughts. "I didn't mean – I wasn't implying that you…" She chewed on her lips unhappily.
Noticing the wonder on Haley's face, Draco smirked. "Perks of the VIP lounge." He winked at her. "Also… they won't tell anyone they've seen us here together."
She nodded. "Sorry, I can't tell you more about it." She placed her pointer finger in front of her mouth and glanced at him apologetically. "Maybe, if you–" She stopped herself, her brows scrunching up slightly.
"Your hair is perfect for that," he whispers, his breath is ghosting against my neck, making me shiver.
Draco didn't get a chance to calm down from the shock, because he had to quickly and inconspicuously follow the girl that was hastily disappearing to a different – probably more quiet – corner where no one would eavesdrop on her conversation with the boring Ravenclaw.
There was a knock at the door. Both of their faces turned toward the noise in surprise. The door opened, revealing a shock of blond hair.
For the hundredth time Haley checked whether her cloak was covering her properly. It was just past dinner, so there was plenty time before curfew but she still didn't want anyone to notice her. Would people see her from the castle? Well, they couldn't because of her Invisibility Cloak. But if she weren't hiding beneath it?
"I was merely trying to keep up appearances." Draco smirked in a way that told Haley he had at least enjoyed stealing points from her house a little bit. She gave him a shove with her shoulder.
She shook it off impatiently. She had made a decision, after all. She wasn’t going to let anyone hurt her again. Especially not Draco Malfoy.
The words that were glaring up at him like a twisted ironic joke hit him just as hard as a curse would have.
," she protested, momentarily taken aback. This was not what she had wanted to talk about. "Anyway, he's done nothing wrong. So you should leave him alone."
For a long moment he stared at the yellow hair tie thoughtfully. Then he sighed tiredly and slung his arms around her, pulling her into his lap. "Just don't lie to me." He whispered into her hair like he was telling her a secret. "I've already lost so much… I don't want to lose you, too."
"What are you doing?" He asked, trying to keep the uncertainty out of his voice. Did she want to leave already?
Neville glanced away. “Were you studying on your own?” He asked, noticing that nobody was following her out of the library.
Could there be more to it? Was there a way to save him? And what was he trying to tell her? To stay away from Malfoy. Because he was evil? Did he mean Draco? Or his father? It didn't make sense. It was probably best to forget about the dream and stop worrying about it.
"That doesn't make you a bad person, though. In a way, it's understandable." Hermione continued, not letting Haley interrupt her. "But in any case, you're still my best friend. And I don't like you even a bit less."
His eyes softened somewhat. "Okay. But then… Malfoy… you – you weren't serious, earlier, right?" He shook his head, a pleading look on his face. "You don't – him and you… you're not seriously…"
Draco snorts, leaning away from me and dropping his hand. "That's a pity. Maybe you should dye it then."
I'm floored. She's completely right, of course. But I never mentioned a name in my letter. So… how does she know?
"Didn't sleep well," Haley replied slightly annoyed. It wasn't even a lie. Not really. And she was still kind of mad that her so-called
The Slytherin pulled up his other leg as well and knelt down next to her, leaning into her personal space. "I actually lured you here to suck all the blood from you and cast your dead body off the astronomy tower."
Haley stopped. She'd walked past a room that seemed as inconspicuous as any other room on the floor. Maybe it was that fact that made it all the more suspicious. There was no light shining through the door gap. It wasn't even closed properly. Usually, closed and barricaded doors were the most enticing. Doors screaming "
"That there was more to you. More than what you let everyone else see. I kept hoping…what I saw that night… That it was true. That you were more than just a heartless bully."
His words were dripping with sarcasm. Potter was shaking her head almost absently. Perhaps that was enough to make her drop the topic now.
It was something that she had always found impossibly hard. Even with Neville. Even with her closest friends.
"Here," he said, holding the mirror up right in front of her face. Haley reached for it reflexively and took a look at her reflection. She looked exactly the way she always did. Which was weird because she had done her hair up in a bun this morning. But now it was all over her face like she'd walked out of a hurricane.
"It was – I mean… well – it wouldn't have happened if Malfoy had not been present. And he didn't exactly lift a finger to help me."
"Yeah." Haley said finally. Michael looked up at her then. And what Haley saw there in his face made her realize a few things. He had known Cedric, too. Well, him and Cedric had been rivals but still... Haley imagined he felt even worse because of that. Overall he seemed somewhat lost. A little lost, a little sad.. and also... scared. They were all in the same boat now. Suddenly Haley felt bad for the way she had almost enjoyed his discomfort earlier.
And now he was sleeping again. In Simon's bedroom. Simon was watching over him. It was slightly strange to think that she had been sleeping there with Draco only hours before.
He didn't reply for a while. If not for the recurring movement of his eyes blinking, she would have thought he had fallen asleep.
Draco stiffened. He mechanically shook his head once. What was she talking about? His… magic? He took a deep breath as if to calm himself down. Haley grabbed his hand reflexively, trying to provide some sort of comfort.
"You should try it, Haley. It's so much fun!" Hermione agreed. Haley looked at the needles that were soaring in mid-air and slowly creating a hat or a sock or –
"That's so embarrassing, right? I had already forgotten about it." She hid her face in her hands, covering her reddening cheeks. Draco had to stop himself from patting her head. What was wrong with him? When had he turned this soft?
Draco paid no attention to people staring at him. He knew what he was doing and felt no shame. Everybody figured that Draco would leave the party with someone, after all, it was Draco Malfoy, half the teenagers at school had a crush on him. However, Harry Potter was definitely the last person anyone would have expected to be snogging him. Draco smirked to himself, he always was one for going against what everyone else thought
"You want it so badly, don't you" Harry moaned. Draco nodded, looking back up at him. "This is what you deserve Slut. You belong on your knees, touching me. Nobody else"
"I know" Harry kissed his cheek "But you have to let me look after you. I won't do anything physical if you don't let me take care of you"
Draco's smile slowly faded while the others laughed between them, the pain still washing over him like waves "Everything about him..."
"I'm not angry, I'm hurt!" Draco spat "I'm hurt and humiliated and no, not the good kind of humiliated, the shit kind. The kind where I can't even look at you because I know you'll see me and forever be reminded of all the filthy things I let you do to me, and that's all you'll ever see when you look at me and I'm so filled with shame it hurts to even think about it!" he gasped, unleashing everything he'd been holding in for so long
Draco took a breath and turned his head to the side, looking behind him. Anything for Harry not to see the pain rising in him but he still caught on. "Are you crying?" Harry asked. Draco looked down at his feet and took another steady breath. Placing his food to one side he rubbed his face in his hands and sniffed. Tears began welling in his eyes
"Ohh!" Draco cried out. His cock ached it was so stiff with arousal, just a passing touch would surely make him explode
"I thought he was sexy in school robes and a baggy jumper but now..." Harry pinched his brow in frustration and tried to hide the growing erection in his trousers
Harry leant in beside him and noticed his face was streaked with tears, his eyes red and glassy "Draco?"
"I can't explain it" Draco uttered, feeling more tears stripe his cheeks. "He knows what makes me happy. How to make me feel things I've only ever dreamed of. I know he would try and deny it... but I see the way he looks at me when we're together, he adores making me feel good, making me feel cared for. It's as though he's the perfect other half to me... and I used to..." his voice began to break "I used to f-feel so safe with him... a-and now..."
Draco scowled "God you're annoying sometimes" he was frustrated and anxious, though he loved his little meet ups with Harry, he was never quite sure what to expect
But he left. Walking out without even a second glance back, hiding the hurt and anger that consumed him. Harry watched painfully as Draco passed through the doors, which slammed shut with a bang leaving him standing alone in the silent room, his own heart aching.
"I just thought..." Draco hesitated with a pained smile "that the only time I would ever let anyone see that side of me would be when I found someone that loved me"
"You feel so good!" Harry moaned, throwing his head back "Gorgeous Slut! Fuck! M-m s-so close d-draco... mmmm yes!!"
"Draco!" Blaise called from behind him "There you are, mate! been looking for- what's wrong?" his expression dropped as Draco turned to look at him, the realisation hitting him instantly that his best friend was hurt
Harry dropped his head into his hands and rubbed his face in despair "I can't stop thinking about him! That's not normal is it? I mean, we weren't even dating"
"You guys really are terrible dancers!" Ginny teased from beside them, dancing freely with Hermione amongst the crowd, the girls having far more rhythm then any of the boys put together.
Harry entered the room of requirement to see Draco was already there, naked on the bed on his hands and knees, his arse gorgeously on display ready to be touched and used.
Draco nodded, stifling cries of pleasure as Harry stroked his cock and balls from behind. He so desperately needed to beg and moan and cum right into Harry's hand, his touch electrified him, like every hair stood on end, ever nerve on fire. His cock was already leaking, pre-cum falling from the top of his erection
Draco stepped away, lowering his wand. Tears flooded his angry eyes, the scowl upon his face masking the unbearable pain that crushed him. He turned and walked away, holding himself together until Harry was out of sight
Draco turned slightly and noticed Harry moving towards him. His smile dropped as he instantly froze, forgetting the boy beside him and feeling his chest drop to the floor
"Well stop! I don't want anyone, ok?" he snapped. They closed their mouths and nodded, settling into an uncomfortable silence
There was a long silence, Ron and Hermione's confused expressions remained the same until finally Ron spoke "Well we already sort of figured that out, mate" he moaned, rolling his eyes at still having no real answer behind his friends foul mood
Harry smiled. He stood up from the bed and dropped his sweatpants to the floor, stepping out. Draco walked over to the door to check that it was locked with his wand then undid his own trousers, pulling them off
Harry thought that as they grew older, him and Malfoy had come to an unspoken agreement to be more civil at school. He noticed that Malfoy teased him less, stopped pestering him and his friends and assumed that the Slytherin had outgrown his boyish bullying days, until moments like today reminded him that he was still an arse.
No one else existed in that moment, they didn't care about the risks of being seen or the repercussions that would surely come after this. The only thing that mattered was each other, realising what they had lost and how much it hurt to be apart
Draco kissed him again, holding onto his t-shirt with his fist as their heads tilted side to side and soft moans escaped their lips. They were locked together for a while before they finally broke apart. Draco kicked his legs out, resting back on his palms while Harry remained cross-legged beside him
Harry was slamming into him from behind, so hard Draco's cries of pleasure were echoing off the walls of the bathroom. They were so lost in each other they didn't care who could hear them. Harry let his hands explore all over Draco's body, his chest, his arms, his arse as he pushed his cock deep inside him. Harry was stifling his own cries of pleasure
Draco's wide eyes met Harry's, nodding desperately and panting, still totally in shock but coming undone at Harry's touch. His eyes were transfixed on him, lips parted almost drunk from the kiss, the shock rendering him useless. Harry was there, right in front of him holding him, kissing him, wanting him, it was finally real. Pure happiness radiated from every pore on his body that he felt like he was floating, completely weightless
Draco lost himself as he climaxed hard in Harry's mouth, his warmth and wetness teasing every nerve that sent pleasure pulsating through him. He panted Harry's name over and over as hot cum shot from his cock which Harry swallowed with ease
Harry helped him to his feet as he winced feeling his stiff joints stretch out. Draco put his clothing back on and climbed onto the bed curling up, exhausted both emotionally and physically, he rested his head on the pillow
They rested in silence for a moment before Draco let out a long sigh "Ugh, we should really get to class now, we're gonna be late"
"It's not that easy, Hermione" Harry bit "Especially living in the same place as him. When I go to breakfast; he's there, when I'm in my classes; he's there, when I visit the library; he's th-"
Draco was holding everything together in that moment "No. I trusted you when you said that I was safe. When you said you weren't going to hurt me"
Draco was panting and moaning and cursing every possible sound from under his breath, having Harry behind him somehow intensified the whole thing, as he couldn't see what would come next. He begged for more and sang his name over and over, furrowing his brow and gasping out through parted lips, still feeling the tug against his wrist ties every time Harry fucked him deeper
Malfoy froze at the sight of Harry coming over. Both of them completely naked and wet. Harry had been riled up and had stopped caring. He was tired of Malfoy running his mouth, he needed to be daring to show he was serious
His skin was blotched and red, Harry knew that would bruise soon. He swung his arm once more in a strike and Draco groaned desperately into the sheets
Harry grabbed hold of Draco's legs and pushed them back, trusting into him deeper. Draco's soft cries filled the room as he panted and begged, writhing beneath Harry
"You're late" Draco moaned, as Harry finally appeared around the room of requirement door half an hour later than agreed. He was sitting cross legged on the bed in a jumper and sweatpants
"I hate crying" Draco bit angrily through the tears "I hate having fucking feelings. Fuck this" he dropped his head into his hands sobbing. Pansy shared a worried look with Blaise as they tried their best to comfort but with little luck
"Hi boys, I was jus-Draco? Darling, what's the matter?" Her tone instantly changed upon seeing Draco's tear-stained cheeks and pink eyes. He was still crying quietly, gulping back ragged breaths and crunching his eyes shut, dropping his head down in front of him
Harry thought back to the jealousy he'd felt before, when Draco simply spoke to another person and was reminded of the fire that riled up inside of him. Harry was fuming that day, he punished Draco so severely for something so harmless and now he was letting him get away with this. No way.
"You did amazing, Draco" Harry spooned him from behind, sliding one arm around him, their legs interlinked. "That was more than enough for today"
Draco barely had a second to think, let alone speak, before Harry came crashing into him in a kiss so fierce he almost knocked Draco backwards in the process
Draco stopped for a moment and searched Harry's expression with his eyes, as though trying to read his face while Harry looked back at him still breathing heavy from the intense kiss. The music, the darkness, the heat made everything feel like a blur. Unsure on whether Draco was going to pull him back in or push him away, the second apart felt like a lifetime as Harry waited for Draco's next move
"Crawl for me" Harry demanded, and Draco reluctantly did. Feeling humiliated as he crawled on his hands and knees below him, Harry still tugging on his leash with one hand and stroking his own cock with the other
Draco bit his lip, stifling a moan of sudden arousal. He'd never considered food play in the bedroom before but now he was interested. Especially how degrading it would be getting messy for Harry. His cock stiffened, and he imagined how it would feel to lick whipped cream and cum from Harry's hard cock
"I never thought I'd say this but... giving you what you want... making you happy.. makes me happy too"
Harry wrapped his hands around Draco's waist and spun him over, Draco steadied himself with his palms against the bed and slowly spread his legs, his groin was pressed against the edge of the bed as he leant over it, arching his back and exposing his naked hot body for Harry to admire
Pansy smiled "And the way you bicker with him lately... it's as though your heart isn't in it anymore"
Harry broke the kiss with a wicked smile, seeing the surprise on Draco's face, satisfied that he had found a way to shut him up. Draco stood there totally aroused, his cock was aching and he had no idea why
The Hufflepuff boy was still beside him, grinding slowly against Draco's body and Harry felt sick with jealousy
The voice from behind him made Harry stop in his tracks. Draco had picked the perfect moment where they were alone in the long stone corridor beside the courtyard. Harry had just left the library and was making his way back to the common room for another night of wallowing in self pity
He couldn't bring himself to answer that question, but regardless, he knew it was the Slytherin parties that were always eventful
"I guess you've still got a bit more exploring to do then" Harry joked but Draco didn't laugh. He realised that what had happened with him and Harry occurred so naturally. The frustration and biting at one another lead to kissing which lead to sex. It felt easy, and right. The thought of actually seeking out someone new was daunting
One by one the people around them began to catch on, turning to see Harry and Draco lost in a desperate heated kiss. Suddenly all eyes were on them, people pointing and whispering, others gasping in shock. Some students began wolf-whistling as the room filled with excited cheering and cries of surprise over the loud music
"Oh! I almost forgot!" Pansy burst out, striding over to her dresser and opening up the last draw on the bottom right. She pulled out a small glass bottle filled halfway with a pearlescent green liquid that shimmered with stardust and swirled by itself
"Don't you understand how mortified I am right now?! I exposed my deepest darkest desires to the one person who could've easily used it against me and now you'll always have that over me! It's humiliating knowing you've seen me like that... on my knees in front of you... being degraded by you... I can't look at you the same anymore!"
Harry slid the paddle against Draco's arse, allowing him to feel the soft leather against his burning skin. He held it firmly in his hand, hovering it just above him before letting it connect with Draco with a harsh smack
Draco bit down onto Harry's neck and sucked hard causing Harry to yelp at the sudden sting from his lovers teeth. He let another moan escape feeling Draco licking up his jawline before teasing his earlobe, his hot breathing sending tingles through every nerve on Harry's body
Draco faced him with an unamused glare and Harry thought he was about to spit his usual bitterness but instead he broke into laughter and relaxed "We're really bad at this communication thing aren't we?"
"Mm-wait-" Draco paused "if we're just a casual hookup... why are we kissing? I mean... most flings just meet up, fuck and leave"
"She's never going to talk to me again. Probably won't even invite me to her birthday party," he whines.
"I'm going to blackmail him." He grinned smugly. "If Umbridge found out he was in possession of something this dark, she would surely fire him, don't you think?"
She snaked her arms around the boy, melting further into the embrace. No. Her godfather was wrong. He wasn't using her.
"I..." I begin to say but I don't really know what to tell her. "Should we really talk about this here?" I question instead, gesturing toward the whole corridor. Hedwig looks at me briefly before grabbing my arm again and pulling me down the hall.
"The gillyweed!" That's what the boy had been talking about! Now she knew where this was going. Except… no she still didn't have an idea.
What enfolded then, answered the question of why Snape was trying to protect this memory so badly. She could do nothing but stand there and watch as her dad taunted a fellow student, hexed him, humiliated him in front of all these other students… and all of that without a reason. And then it got even abstruser. Her mum marched over to them and tried to stop James from pestering Snape even further. And the strange thing about it was… they didn't get along. They were going to become her parents in the future and her mum couldn't seem to stand James at all. Haley just wanted it to be over. This was pure horror. And Snape calling her mum a mudblood wasn't even the worst…
? "You who were always so close… I wanted you… but I couldn't have you. It nearly drove me mad. But it was a different kind of madness." He chuckled. "More manageable."
Haley didn't want to say good bye to her godfather. The thought of leaving him behind at the one place he loathed the most (well... aside from Azkaban) simply didn't seem right.
"If you tell anyone," he whispered defiantly, a hint of shyness and uncertainty flashing in his grey eyes. "I'll tell them that you kissed me first."
"What's taking them so long?" She wondered, looking around for their parents. Where had they gone now? She couldn't see them anymore.
"You're done," I tell him and before I can say more than that, he sprints toward the mirror and admires himself.
know that." She said defiantly, reaching for the bowl with her left hand and holding it up to her face for inspection.
. The word echoed inside her head, wrapped itself around her heart and squeezed. It seemed as if she was dying after all. But at least she was dying in Draco Malfoy's arms. She wanted to slap herself for thinking something that cheesy. What was wrong with her? She raised her head off Draco's chest and tried to glare at him.
I concentrate on the task of making myself look like the Transfigurations professor. It helps that she is standing right in front of me. A glance toward my clothes tells me that I successfully copied her robes. I have always wanted to wear that fancy hat of hers once. Hopefully I got the face right as well. With a wave of my hand I make the real McGonnagall (Well, she is real in the dream) vanish and quickly go to stand where she stood only a second ago. I take another step to the left until I'm right in front of Malfoy's desk. From up close he looks even more nervous than before. A grin steals onto my face.
"I'll just take… that," Lily plucked Haley's favourite owl bracelet from her bedside table and slipped it around her wrist.
know that," Draco answered haughtily, snatching back the magazine and shoving it carelessly into his bag. He did know he shouldn't believe any of it. In theory… But some parts of the 'interview' just wouldn't leave his mind. Like the parts about Potter's preferred hair style. It couldn't be completely made up, right?
"We should invite Neville," I propose casually. This could either be a big mistake or my chance to finally get some answers.
you. Many times…" He whispered, "I was such a prat to you, I ignored you I – I insulted you, embarrassed you – I – I – I…" He swallowed thickly.
"You really don't know how absurdly amazing you are." He mused, cupping her cheek with his left hand and caressing it with his thumb.
Her direct question and her boring eyes seemed to startle him. "Uh, well…" He scratched his neck and his features turned into a boyish grin.
Those words somehow got to him. Their genuine simplicity and the obvious intent behind them. The almost naive hope that was also mirrored in those impossibly emerald green eyes. It was her innocently pure and stubborn belief that there was a choice. That you didn't always have to do what was expected of you. That maybe there was something good in him, too. Potter did care about him. It hadn't seemed that way before but now… Why else would she be that invested in the matter? The realisation awakened a dangerous hope inside him and caused him to say something he wasn't sure he wouldn't regret later on.
Haley rushed over to Draco. He had even cut his left hand on the shards of whatever had crashed to the floor.
Upon closer look, the different colours seem to originate from countless, different sized balloons that are slowly floating around. The way they are floating they resemble fish, weightlessly drifting through water. Inside the balloons there seems to be some sort of light that's giving off soft glows of blue.
"Haley," he said quietly, softly, like a caress. Like he was carefully trying out her name on his tongue. This one word was all it took to make her heart stop.
"All right, all right," he conceded. He knew she was going to make him regret it if he took it too far. Also, he simply couldn't refuse her anything when she was pouting like this. Actually, it was an interesting combination of pouting and trying not to grin.
"Actually, guys, I don't think I can make it. I have this huge group project coming up. And there's so much I need to revise for the OWLs. The two of you should go alone. We can go together next time," She said, trying not to sound too obvious.
"I can't just sit here and do nothing!" He kicked his bag angrily. It was a bit more dignified than stomping his foot. "If it was someone important to you, you wouldn't sit around either!"
Haley chuckled. "Sorry to disappoint you. I've just escaped from Hermione's revision obsession. If I didn't know any better I'd say, she enjoys torturing her friends."
"Well, I didn't tell you to eat that!" The girl burst out. What a lame excuse. Draco wanted to jump her. And not in a good way.
She snorted, placing her hand over his heart, feeling the fast and steady thrum of it. "I don't think hearts are meant to beat this fast normally. At this rate, it's going to jump out of your ribcage."
. He was trying to send her a message. Through that book. And now Hermione had noticed, too! Why hadn't she noticed the book sooner?
"That's completely unnecessary," Haley hissed, although she felt already much warmer. "Besides, stop trying to distract me. You still owe me an answer."
It was probably for the best that Potter chose that moment to free herself from his grasp and left the class room. The playful tone of her voice had been a direct attack on his heart. And Draco didn't know how much more of it he would actually be able to survive.
"Yes you were. But you're wrong! I do understand you can't make such a decision over night but that's… those are two completely different matters!"
"If you ever dare dream of me again, I'll make sure you regret it." I growl, narrowing my eyes at him. "That's a promise."
"Don't you know how dangerous golems are?" She sounded earnestly worried now. "My uncle tried to get control of a golem to become more powerful. Do you know what happened to him? He was the most powerful magician… for a few hours. But then he fell into a coma. They say it swallowed up his soul. In any case… it was only his body that was left when he woke up. His soul… never returned."
"I've had enough of this! You've been tailing me all week! And it's enough already! I don't need a crazy stalker on top of everything!" Haley thundered at the person that was crouching behind the suit of armour.
"Yeah, well, sadly he seemed much better, when we passed him on the stairs," George added regretfully. One of his brows was lifted pointedly.
She rested her chin in her hand and began to wind one of her blond locks around her finger. "The interview was in the
. And a whole box of them, too. A strange feeling filled him up. But he couldn't put a name to it. He could only stare at her, like he had lost the ability to talk.
"Well, everyone knows him, I guess," Haley offered with a shrug, "but only a few people know he's my godfather. Or that he's innocent."
It was only then that Haley spotted the two bulky figures, without whom Malfoy never went anywhere, waiting outside the compartment.
Haley shook her head, relieved that he didn't suspect anything. "It's just… been a long day." She mumbled, glancing down at her lap. It wasn't even a lie. The quidditch training and the interview had been exhausting. Not counting in the feeling of guilt.
It was all there plain on his face, rendering her speechless, making the tears shoot into her eyes. Disbelief. Disappointment. Betrayal. But he didn't resent her, did he?
"It would not be easy," the man continued. "And you would have to be ready to… turn your back on your family and everything you believe in."
"But – when I asked you if there was an antidote last year, you said there wasn't! You said you couldn't help me!" Draco said angrily.
The night air was cold. But the quiet surrounding the astronomy tower was peaceful. Haley pulled her warm cloak tighter around her. She was glad she had thought of bringing it.
"Forgive you?" Ron asked. "Why? Shouldn't that git ask you to forgive him? You're not the one who's done anything wrong."
Mum furrows her eyebrows like she's in deep thought. "Come with me. I think I have an idea." She grabs my hand and pulls me up a staircase that I don't remember being there before. We stop in front of a door that has the name
"Oh. Wasn't that already here, when we arrived?" Haley asked innocently, as she grabbed the book and put it on top of her pile.
I grin. I've always liked people praising and admiring me. I think I got that from dad. So… perhaps I'm a little bit of a Gryffindor after all?
Haley nodded. He was right. There were lots of things happening at the moment that didn't make any sense.
"Sure." He grinned. "Tell them." If that was what she wanted. She could have asked him to dance on top of the Gryffindor table wearing a lion's head and he probably would have agreed. He was so hopelessly gone for her. He only hoped she never found out just how tightly he was wrapped around her little finger.
"Potter?" He turned around again, sure that he felt someone's presence. But there was no one. Just a voice whispering in the dark. "
"But," George continued, raising his pointer finger. "Before we go on to realize our talents elsewhere, we're planning to give Hogwarts one last present."
"Stop smirking you-" Haley clapped her hand in front of her mouth. Was that her voice? Why did it sound like she was trying to imitate a chipmunk?
"I thought I told you to return to your tower at once." Although the man's voice was quiet, it was as cutting as a cold winter breeze. It was clear that he was not in the mood to argue.
“Try not to miss breakfast next time,” the boy said teasingly, handing her a glass of pumpkin juice. She rolled her eyes but accepted the glass nonetheless.
She crossed out the last sentence and started again. It seemed like before she could think of asking anything, she had to apologize a thousand times.
Was it possible that her mum had already found a solution to the problem? Impossible. But clearly, she wanted to talk to her in person about it. So, before going to sleep that night, Haley armed herself with her mum's hair clasp and a portion of optimism.
"Turn around," I instruct with a huff, getting more comfortable on the bed. Once he faces away from me, I reach for his hair and enclose the top half of it in my hand. I need a hair tie. His fingers are playing around with several black ties.
"What are you-?" She started to ask but the boy whose head was currently lying on her stomach interrupted her.
Haley grinned even wider. Malfoy shook his head in disbelief. But she could see the tiny smile in the corner of his mouth he was obviously trying to suppress.
"You mean that human who always walks around looking like he only ever catches rats instead of delicious little mice?"
"Don't ever start dating," I tell my brother with a groan, as I let myself fall onto his bed backwards. "Honestly, it's not worth the trouble."
There was a suspicious glint of gold near the ground, which he only noticed because it was next to Potter's head. She hadn't noticed it yet since it was fluttering behind her. Slowly, as not to alert the girl to the snitch's presence he descended to the ground until he was about ten metres above it in the middle of the quidditch pitch. Potter was opposite him now on the other side of the pitch in front of the goal posts, floating only inches above the ground. She followed his gaze and turned around… but the golden ball was already gone again. That was a close cut. But then he saw it again, glittering gold against the stands to his right. This time he would catch it. He raced toward the little ball, one arm outstretched, almost in reach – when the snitch suddenly zoomed upwards. Draco growled. He wouldn't let it slip away this time. Abruptly, he pulled the broomstick upwards, making it shoot up to the sky so fast that it practically turned upside down. His fingers slipped from the wood and the abrupt movement caused his limbs to detach from the broom as well. He desperately reached for the broomstick but his fingers touched nothing but air. Then he felt himself falling.
She nodded. "People and… you know… well... vampires." She didn't know why she had said it. Of course, she didn't actually think Malfoy was a vampire. She had just wanted to lighten up the mood or… something. But she certainly hadn't expected him to react like this. Apart from the crease between his eyebrows the expression on his face seemed frozen. What was he thinking? Haley was just about to ask him exactly that when the boy seemed to come back to life. He chuckled once. Then he smirked at her in a way that could only be described as roguish. "So, you've finally discovered my dark secret, haven't you?"
She doesn't answer right away. And when she does, her tone is hesitant… thoughtful. "I think… you should… confirm your assumption first."
"Hi," she greeted him with a wide smile. "How is your leg? I heard you went to see Madame Pomfrey after all."
He picks up one of the magazines and shows me a picture. The hair of the man in the image is up in a half bun with the sides leading up to it braided fishtail style. Interesting.
There was a tiny smile on his face as well and for a few seconds they just sat there softly smiling at one another. In that moment it was hard to imagine how cold his eyes had been, how they had reminded her of a harsh winter storm. Now the iciness had made way for a more… a more…
"I don't know… Maybe it's just the lack of sleep or… perhaps I'm slowly going insane," she concluded dramatically. Ron laughed.
"It's fine, I guess. At least I know what it means now." I want to pat her arm or something. But she is simply too small for that. I opt for a smile instead.
Haley froze. She hadn't even heard the door opening. Without wanting to, she turned her head, taking as much time as she could before she would have to face him.
fine again. Her heart felt a tiny bit lighter now, though. It was like she didn't have to carry the burden all by herself anymore.
Malfoy grinned happily and squeezed her shoulders once. Then he let go of her and leant back on the table until he was lying on his back on top of it.
Of course that was the first thing she was curious about. He rolled his eyes at the reminder of his embarrassing 'stunt' yesterday.
"I'm sure the next game will go better." Luna commented. "You both did your best." It was clear, she was trying to cheer them up but unfortunately, Ron was beyond the point where that worked.
painted across it in vibrant colours. It looks like a bedroom door. Mum pulls me into the room behind it, which has painted walls, a small bed, a desk and a huge wardrobe on the wall to the right.
"I don't know what to do," he finally admitted, letting his head sink against the cool window glass behind him.
In the end Haley didn't receive a present from Malfoy after all. She didn't even see him again before the start of the holidays. It wasn't too bad because she hadn't come up with an idea for a present in time. But of course the circumstances surrounding her early return to Grimmauld Place didn't provide much reason for cheerfulness. Mr Weasley had been attacked by a snake and was now resting at St. Mungo's. She had visited him along with the other Weasleys and now it looked as though he was going to be discharged in a few more days.
Luna's blue eyes didn't look eager at all. "I'm sorry," she said. Haley's heart plummeted like a bird falling out of the sky. She didn't want to hear what was going to come next.
. "Why do you ask?" He questioned lightly. But something about his voice sounded strange. And he wasn't even looking at her.
Hey everyone! Here's a new chapter for you. I had so much fun writing pre-teen!Draco. Wasn't he cute? I'm super curious what your guesses are for The Secret ... Anyway, thank you for reading and leave me your thoughts!
"Well, with the way he acted…" Luna mused, handing back the letter. "He'll have a hard time convincing anyone he's innocent."
Those deep green eyes that always looked like they were ready to kill, whenever they were directed at him. Lately she'd more often than not looked at him differently. Like she was trying to figure him out and uncover all the secrets that he kept hidden so carefully.
Okay, this it. 11k words. I don't even know what to say. No, actually I have a lot to say. First of all, I want to thank everyone who went on this journey with me and encouraged me to keep writing. I honestly didn't think this would get so long. But here we are, 180 k words later.
There was a grin on Hagrid's face. "I think ye might be the first team ter find one of 'em. Let's go over ter check."
Draco felt as though someone had pulled the rug out from under his feet. That wasn't true. It couldn't be.
Shaking my head in disbelief, I set down the guitar and reach for the door handle. What kind of dream will I stumble into this time?
funny. Under normal circumstances she probably would have just laughed it off but the interview with Rita had left her overly sensitive and on edge.
Huh? Was that an answer to her question earlier? Did he even understand what she had meant by it? In any case, the words distracted her so much that she forgot to keep fighting him. He pulled her hand out of her pocket and slipped his fingers through hers. She let him. It felt too good to keep fighting it.
She pulled the covers back up around herself and tried to calm her heart. She didn't dare close her eyes, fearing the remnants of the dream would come back to haunt her. After a while, she felt calmer and tried to fall asleep again.
"Because," She had trouble concentrating, let alone form proper sentences. "Because it's an opportunity to find out… find out where to… to improve."
The kid shook her head with wide innocent eyes. "Sorry," she mumbled shyly, as she picked up her bag so that no one could fall over it again.
, isn't it?" She spat angrily, taking another step toward him. Draco's heart stopped. Did she… know? Was that possible? "Because she went off with Potter and her friends?"
. Draco raised an eyebrow at her in challenge. What was she going to make of that? Did it make her jealous to hear him talk about Pansy that way?
It was hard not to look at her in the Great Hall. Or in the classes they shared. Or in the halls. It was even harder not to notice the shadows under her eyes. Obviously she hadn't slept well the previous night. (Just like him.) Did that mean there was still hope? Did she regret-
Mum is waiting for me inside our Potions classroom. Or the dream version of it, which doesn't look quite as gloomy as the room looks nowadays. There are even windows, bathing the room in a warm light.
"I wasn't – I just said – I didn't–" Now she had him flustered, his face turning all red. It was too adorable. This was her mission now. She had to keep distracting him, so all the sad and depressing thoughts didn't even get the chance to enter his head.
Then, using the sweetest tone of voice I can imagine McGonnagall speaking in, I say, "I don't think I will do that."
"More for us then," Simon chimes happily, stuffing his rosy face with popcorn. He smiles at me and in that moment the sun rises an inch, giving his face an iridescent glow. It catches on the bracelet he's wearing. Isn't that one of mum's? It's got a tiny red dragon charm on it. But that's not important now. I need to focus. I feel like we were talking about something very important just now.
On a different note, did any of you read the "School for Good and Evil" series? I think this might be the best series of books I read this year. I could talk about it all day :D
"How'd it go?" Hermione asked sympathetically. She was sitting at their usual corner, Ron next to her and in front of them a heap of parchment. Had they been waiting for her? She would have smiled if she didn't feel like that would finally tip her over the edge. She shook her head and fell into the seat between her two friends. She was
, Draco's head fell onto the table. He groaned. What had he done to deserve such an unreliable ally?
"Ah, it's you. Teenagers. You should be long asleep, you know. I should make you sleep out here in the hall." The Fat Lady said disapprovingly.
The girl nodded. "It says here that golems belong to an ancient branch of magic that many wizards are afraid of exploring because it's said to be both powerful and dangerous. "The golem bestows immeasurable power and protection on its master. Many wizards, however, have struggled with keeping control of the creature. Some have reported that the usage of the golem had made them lose their selves and that the creature was slowly devouring their souls…"" Luna stopped, looking up at him. "I had no idea golems were that dangerous." She admitted. "You should probably be careful with yours."
There was a flash of lightning, a chuckle and then the snow vanished, leaving coloured leaves and September air in its wake.
and she was leafing through a book absently. And her glasses were sitting low, almost on the tip of her nose. And she was wearing her hair in a ponytail, making her whole face visible. It was like a silent invitation for people to take a look at her. But what was that? A lock had gotten loose from her ponytail and now… now it was just
"Ah, so you want to keep it a secret." He nodded as if this was a serious business matter. "We need him to sign a form then. Stating that he's neither planning to exploit you for reasons of fame or money, nor intending to damage your image and on top of that qualifies as a trustworthy partner." He looked at her earnestly.
"You're sorry, you didn't tell me?" He gaped at her, seeming a little lost. "What would that have changed?"
Btw, a few notes on the continuation: So, I've been thinking a lot about how to continue this or if I want to continue this into 6th year at all. And I've come up with two possible plotlines. One is going to be extremely dark and angsty and the other still angsty but overall a lot lighter and not that tragic. I'm leaning towards the lighter version actually because I feel like I should give the characters a break xD
"Have you never had greengages? They're so delicious. You'll have to try them when you come visit us during the holidays." Distraction always worked. In any case, he didn't seem as nervous any more.
His eyes opened wide, he seemingly tried to convince her with nothing but his grey orbs. But that wasn't even necessary. In a second a few things that hadn't hadn't quite added up before were making much more sense. It had seemed suspicious that she had met Dobby in the one night where she'd purposefully made her way down to the kitchens. And coincidentally he had also got her the gillyweed on top of that. If Haley remembered correctly, Dobby had seemed as if he was hiding something from her. And also…
Haley was at a loss. How was she supposed to comfort her upset friend? She placed her hand on the girl's arm, making her stop and face her.
"Would I have told you about this in the first place if I didn't trust you to be responsible enough?"
Luna shook her head. "Sadly, we didn't find the Snorkak. But we still had a great time. We even saw the Tomten. It was really cute."
"I had to do it! For Cedric. People deserve to know how he really died! And that Voldemort is back!"
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "I'm late for Binns," he said, ignoring her request and stepping away from the wall. She was losing again. He wasn't taking her seriously at all. It made her feel powerless and mad at the same time.
He felt himself smiling for whatever reason. Luna chuckled quietly. Normally, he would have told her to shut up or something like that. But he was in such a good mood that he didn't want to dampen it in any way.
"Oh. You noticed?" She was honestly surprised that her friend had noticed anything besides his baked beans.
"Dance with me," he repeats simply, hopefully. I don't answer. But I don't protest either when he interlaces our fingers and slips his left arm around my waist.
Instead he watched the calm surface of the lake that had been painted pitch black by the night. A thousand stars were glistening there, reflecting the sky above.
"Here, let me." Potter picked up her own wand and summoned all of the fallen objects into the hand that was not supporting half his weight. She slipped his wand back into his pocket, her eyes lingering on something else she had picked up. A crumpled up piece of parchment…
"Ah, it wouldn't be nice if I told you that… I might tell you one day. But for now I'm going to tell you a different secret."
"Don't worry Sirius, we'll bring her back unharmed. You'll see." Tonks spoke up for the first time, patting her cousin's shoulder cheerfully.
In my mind I go through the solo part and place my fingers on the strings. It's a really tricky solo but I've been practising it nearly a hundred times with Sirius. Just for fun. And also because it's a cool solo. In the middle of the solo my fingers land on the wrong string and it's ruined. The singer looks at me like I've just insulted him.
Myron Wagtail, the lead singer of the Weird Sisters, looks at me suspiciously. Well, the poster version of him anyway.
"If he ever hurts you, though, make sure to tell me and not James. The boy might not survive a meeting with your dad."
I walk almost head-first into the person that has apparently been waiting in front of my dream door.
Then the Slytherin chuckled softly. "Obviously. That girl is almost as annoying as you," he sneered.
"Look, the way I see it, it's quite easy." He started to explain. "All this time, did you only pretend you liked me? Was it all a lie?"
. Until he'd finally settled on this rather neutral approach. Already anticipating the possibility of someone else finding the note and tracing it back to him. The memory was fresh in his mind and yet it seemed like it had happened in a different lifetime.
In a way it was strange. Countless times, she had been with him while he dreamed. But she'd always been sleeping as well. Never before had she watched him while she was awake. It could have been boring. But there was something calming about the sound of his deep breaths. Somehow it felt like she was watching over him. Like a guardian angel or something. The thought made her snort. How cheesy. In the end that was only a prettier word for stalker.
"It's because the ones who lose… they never get to write the stories. Nobody ever hears their side of the story," he muttered almost to himself, while he looked at something to the side. It had started to rain. Just like it had back in Hogsmeade.
The ghost scoffed. "Promises. Should've gone along then. You wouldn't need to rely on promises that way."
"Fine, I forgot it," Haley admitted. She imagined it was easier that way, "Can you give it back now?"
"Here, I made lemonade for everyone. It's a secret recipe," Luna said with a smile, pouring some lemonade into all of the glasses. "Are you one of Ginny's brothers?" She asked glancing at Bill curiously.
"Well, then." The girl offered. Her face was windswept and flushed and way too attractive. "Let's see who's the best." She raised her eyebrows in challenge and let the snitch loose.
The question seemed to hang in the air between them, unspoken. But Haley wouldn't know… Because her parents were dead. The sudden reminder made her feel even worse.
! I don't know if you remember but I am in fifth year now! Do you know how much homework we get every day? I barely made it to Christmas break without going insane!"
Simon nods like it's something that should have been obvious. Which it kind of was now that I think about it. Wow, my little brother's first crush… I have to record that somewhere.
Right. In case the plan went wrong… it would be better not to have any unnecessary witnesses, who might potentially find out about the reason for their endeavour.
"I do," Haley replied shyly, looking at her fingers. "It just happened. Over time." She shrugged. As if she was still surprised about it herself.
"The notes were actually from Dra – Malfoy," She corrected herself, figuring it would only annoy him further if she called the boy by his first name. "Luna helped us communicate with each other."
"Well, it's a shame they don't offer it here regularly. I was lucky one of the house elves actually knew the recipe." She smiled, Bandy was such an amazing cook. "Actually, the first time I ate it was together with my brother. We went to that Asian place by accident. The noodle soup there was so good that I totally forgot how–" Haley broke off in surprise. Why was she telling him this? She hadn't planned to share this particular memory. It was personal.
I pick up my brush from the ground and in less than a second I'm in front of my own picture again, drawing little devil's horns on cartoon Malfoy's head. Somehow, this escalates into a contest of 'Whose painting is the ugliest?' It's insane.
"And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way. Lead on." And with that Umbridge left her office, keeping Haley and Granger at wand point.
He glared at her angrily. "You know what I'm talking about! That… Hufflepuff who – who asked you – well, are you going to Hogsmeade with him or not?"
Hey there! This is terribly late. I apologize. I was kinda in a slump lately. You know, it's really hard to get motivated during this quarantine... Anyhow. Hope you enjoy this fluffiness :) Stay safe and positive and leave me your thoughts!
What? I frown. Is he talking about real memories now or dream conversations? It probably doesn’t matter, though. I’ve come here to relax. Not to wonder why Draco Malfoy is dreaming of beautiful women.
I shake my head, tapping at each name. “One,” I say touching the first name. “And two.” I prod the second one.
he had seen it? She had to calm herself. She had to focus. "Clear your mind." Snape said in a distant voice. "Let go of all emotion."
"Good," Sirius breathed. A heavy sigh, emphasized his relief. "Oh right, before I forget," he said, taking a small box from the pocket of his sweater. "Here."
Trying to make as little noise as possible, Haley followed the figure, getting closer and closer until there were only about 10 metres separating her from the boy. Once she was absolutely sure that it really was the Slytherin – without either Crabbe or Goyle for once – she drew her wand from her pocket and pointed it at him. If Moody knew she was attacking someone from behind he would certainly be disappointed but Haley really didn't have a choice. And she wasn't going to let him sneak away from her
But if it really was a dream, it was a pretty shabby one because what the heck was he wearing? A long sleeved shirt? In summer? And why was his hair dyed? In real life Draco would never be caught dead wearing something like this.
He'd been so close. But now it seemed the secret had slipped right through his fingers like nothing but mere smoke.
"I'm not stupid! I've seen the two of you pointing fingers and making fun of me during Magical Creatures! Did you have a good laugh?"
"Good luck on the exams," she said quietly. It was unlikely that she would get to see him again like this before the start of the OWLs.
Draco stopped his pacing and whirled to her, meeting his own eyes in the mirror next to her. They seemed wild. Frenzied. "She is! If anything happens to her I don't know what I-" He breathed heavily. "I don't know what I'd do."
She also refused to believe that she had misjudged a person so badly. The glimpses she had seen of the Slytherin the last year… She wanted to see more of them. She wanted to make sure that… they weren't wrong about his character. That he wasn't the bad guy because they always made him out as such. She… well… she had trust in people. And she wouldn't forgive herself if she didn't give him that tiny benefit of the doubt. So she sought him out. But he avoided her like a snake no matter how hard she tried. And finally after one week she'd had enough. She was just about to ask Fred and George for help when an opportunity presented itself by coincidence.
"Do I seem like someone who needs protection?" He asked incredulously, feeling offended. He wasn't a little child who needed protection.
The boy shrugged. “You’ll see.” He said with a cheeky little grin that reminded her of last night’s dream when he had lead her toward
Hello people :) I know you were probably expecting the date but... this chapter simply went on and on so... instead it's like a prologue or something. Which means the Hogsmeade trip will come up in the next chapter!
"Luna, hey," asked a voice that Draco easily recognised as Potter's. He couldn't even see her because there was not a single gap between the books. At least he was still able to hear her voice.
, Simon had said in his dream. And she knew he was right. She sighed, focusing on the boy in front of her again. She wouldn't sink to his level. But that didn't mean she couldn't ruffle his feathers a bit.
And so while most of the people were still gathered in the Great Hall for supper, he made his way out of the castle and across the school grounds toward an inconspicuous willow tree. Half-way there, he noticed something strange. Two shadows, sneaking across the grounds, every now and then stopping and hiding between thick hedges and wide trees. They seemed to be chasing something. Or someone…
"All for you, Master" Draco managed to look up through the strands of platinum hair that fell over his eyes, the vulnerability in his expression meeting Harry's.
"I'm kidding!" Ron blurted, throwing his hands up defensively with a pressed grin "I'm sorry... I just needed to see how you really felt"
Both boys slowly turned to meet each others gaze, Ron as usual was biting back laughter, Harry meanwhile was flushing red
Draco remained tearful, hearing what they were saying but having nothing to give back. He knew deep down they would never judge him, but breaking the icy exterior that he put out there was difficult, especially after mastering the art of hiding emotions for so long
"You did so well, Draco" Harry kissed his cheek tasting the salty tears "Please don't be upset" Harry produced an ointment with his wand "Let me look after you"
Harry pulled back, adoring Draco's shallow breathing through moans of pleasure. Draco opened his eyes and the two looked at each other intensely "I want it" Draco whispered regaining his breath
"Please..." he lulled his head against the sheet below "Please.. I need it... I need you... fuck! Please... "
"Either of you want to do it for me?" he pointed. They shook their heads fiercely. "Didn't think so"
"I swear to Merlin, Potter... if you breathe a word about this I will hex your arse so bloody hard-"
He continued to thrust into him hard, Draco's muffled moans repeating as the tip of Harry's cock graced his prostate. "I know you can't exactly use your safe word right now, just tap your hand three times on the bed if you want to stop, ok?"
Harry began fisting his cock, standing over Draco with his pants half down. Draco sat beneath him, naked and desperate, begging to be touched, aching to touch himself, kneeling below Harry where he belonged
"That's it, Slut. Good boy" Harry caressed the back of his neck with his lips. He had one finger inside Draco, the other hand grabbing his hip to keep him in place. Harry's own cock was aching feeling Draco's warmth wrapped around his finger
"Because you came onto me!" Draco cried, feeling pain surfacing so heavy it was suffocating him "You started this! I never asked for this but I guess that doesn't matter to you, does it? You play with peoples feelings and never feel the consequences because you're 'perfect saint Potter' who can do no wrong!" he spat, stepping back from Harry. He wiped the kiss from his lips with his sleeve and stood before him, overwhelmed and hurt
"Morning" Draco whispered. Harry just smiled drunkenly "You slept well?" Harry nodded, stretching his neck to one side "I dreamt about you last night"
"I know you don't" Pansy soothed. Draco slumped his head against her shoulder and felt as her arm wrapped around his back, stroking him gently. He looked down at the sheets while Blaise handed over a chocolate for them each, before tossing another in his mouth and smiling sympathetically. Pansy crooked her head down slightly, though all she could see was the top of Draco's head against her shoulder "Don't let him waste anymore of your time, darling. Either get him back for good, or let him go, and whatever happens, we'll be here to help you heal"
But Draco said nothing. Still frozen in shock and aching with arousal. Standing totally naked and wet in front of Harry, he wanted to hate it, yet he loved it. He yearned for it. Feeling vulnerable and embarrassed and ashamed, he needed more
This takes place in the final year of Hogwarts. Most characters are canon, with maybe a few slight tweaks to their personalities, the rest of the story doesn't quite follow the books. Voldemort isn't back from the dead in this story so there's not really a divide between "good" and "bad". Draco is not a death eater or on the opposite side to Harry and his friends, though his father is still a nasty piece of work.
He would've been able to take more in if the common room wasn't flooded with partying students, screaming and singing to the music that was blaring from a set of speakers on the table to the side. He could barely take a step forward without bumping into a body somewhere, the room was so dark with only the deepest teal glow shimmering over the students and the faint flicker from the firelight. He imagined this was similar to those muggle nightclubs his cousin mentioned once
Draco closed his eyes feeling his own cock pulsating beneath him. He tugged against his wrist cuffs and moaned unable to satisfy the ache to touch his own erection
Hermione raised her brow and shot him a look "You've been going there more often because a certain Slytherin is there, haven't you?"
Draco grinned, pulling Harry back under the covers by his neck and kissing him tenderly. Their lips were sucking and biting, tilting heads side to side and moaning between kisses, caressing every inch of one another. Harry pulled the covers back up to their necks and felt as Draco's legs slid in between his own, his growing erection pressed again him "Round two it is, then"
"Yes-s.. master.." Draco groaned, he could barely make eye contact with himself in the mirror he was seeping with shame. Feeling the degradation was one thing but seeing it was another
Draco pushed into the kiss and brought his hands up to Harry's face, holding him close until suddenly he stopped
Harry was lost in a total high. Draco's hands on his body was electric on his skin, his warmth enveloping him like a poison spreading through his body. His heart ached for him, his already throbbing erection desperate for his touch. Draco moaned deeper into the kiss, sliding his fingers through Harry’s messy hair, both of them panting softly as their lips came together over and over again, claiming one another
"You have no idea what I'm going to make you do" he kissed Draco's lips hard savouring every moment of Draco writhing in pleasure "But trust me when I say, you will be so humiliated-"
"Wow you really don't like them dancing together, do you?" Ron probed, standing at Harry's side and expecting to see a red mist descend over Harry's eyes
Harry was bad at playing it cool. Really bad. He was practically gawping at Draco with a mixture of arousal and longing. This Draco sitting before him, with the half exposed chest, the jewellery, the style, surely this wasn't the same Draco that dropped to his knees and submitted to Harry's every demand. The fact that this really was the same Draco made his cock stiffen instantly and the heat shoot straight to his groin
Harry leant in closer and kissed Draco passionately on the lips, Draco was barely kissing him back, he was lost in moans and cries of pleasure as Harry caressed him. He slid over to his ear and whispered softly, their hot sticky skin pressed together "Cum for me"
Harry kept his gaze low but still fixed on Draco. A million thoughts rushing through his mind; the kiss, the passion, the exposure, and where was Draco leading him now? Like walking into one of his dreams he followed Draco close behind as they made their way across the common room floor and gradually up the steps toward the dormitories
Harry was sat in the great hall at his usual table. Ron was opposite him piling heaped spoonfuls of scrambled egg onto his plate while Hermione sat next to Ron, unfolding her copy of the Daily Prophet and stirring her tea
Blaise leant forward with a sympathetic look "Mate... you're good at hiding your emotions from everyone else..."
Harry pulled Draco up slowly allowing him to readjust to the sensation of being on his legs again "I want you bent over the bed, show me your pretty arse" he whispered, removing the cuffs and grabbing Draco by the collar, shoving him backwards whilst closing in on him. Draco looked up at Harry who towered over him, his own eyes were wide with lust and desperate to please him
Their eyes met again, and this time Harry could see the wanting in Draco's. "Please don't feel ashamed Draco" he brought his hands to Draco's arms and pushed his body against him
Harry moaned as he thrust further in and out, gradually speeding up and gaining a rhythm. Draco looked down at his cock that was leaking pre-cum onto his stomach already and Harry began stroking it
"You've said that every day" Hermione moaned "and every day its the same. It's not fair to take it out on us"
Harry slid his cock back into him slowly and Draco cursed under his breath at the sensation of being filled. He then leant in closer, his sweaty chest pressed against Draco's back. He slid his fingers through Draco's hair, forcefully tugging his head up to face the mirror that hung in front of them
"Wait!" Pansy called, striding over and nudging beside him, their backs to the rest of the room. Draco looked her curiously as she pulled a tiny paper bag out from somewhere in her dress "Let's make this party more exciting shall we?"
Harry scanned the crowd for Draco but with no luck. "I see Dean and Neville over by the window!" Ron waved, taking Harry's arm and guiding him through the crowd
"You said: 'I belong to you'... did you not mean it?" Draco's bit, his voice faltered a little but the nastiness remained, and for the first time Harry could see the pain behind his mask
"That proves nothing" Draco spat, yanking his arm away. They stood staring at one another, riled up from the heated conversation but no words came. Harry felt horrible for the way he'd behaved and Draco felt sick knowing how badly he missed him. He wanted to grab him and kiss him and scream at him for letting this whole thing happen but he never wanted to lose it either.
The others, who up until now we're totally oblivious to Harry and Draco's secret fling, were stunned seeing the two boys making out with such passion as a mixture of drunken, overexcited cries filled the room
Harry brought his lips up to Draco's ear "You've really earned yourself a punishment tonight, Slut" he whispered, feeling Draco tense underneath him
Harry leant in and pulled Draco closer until their lips met in a passionate kiss. His hands graced the sides of Draco's face, feeling the soft skin and damp tears beneath his fingers as he then brushed his blonde hair back and slid one hand around the back of his neck. He broke the kiss but remained close, their noses touching. Quiet breaths and closed eyes
"I never thought.. I would t-tell anyone... a-about my fantasies.. let alone y-you" Draco spoke through tears
"What's new with you guys anyway?" George asked, looking between Harry and Ron "Anything juicy happening at Hogwarts this year?"
"Yes.. master" Draco gasped softly against the bed, his arse still firmly on display and reddening rapidly
Draco was breathless, moaning senselessly with his back against the wall as Harry kneeled inches away from him
Harry stared at the door. Overwhelmed by how many different emotions he had just felt in the last five minutes. He kicked his legs off the bed, and brought his hands to his face, rubbing away the confusion. He ran one hand through his hair and collapsed back onto the bed, his erection still aching for Draco's touch
Blaise moved up the bed until he was sitting next to him, placing an arm around Draco's back. "Can I ask something?". Draco nodded. "When it started, were you two just having casual sex?"
Harry and Draco were standing before Professor McGonagall at the side of the Quidditch pitch. The game had just ended and all the spectating students were leaving the stands with a buzz of excitement while the two boys had been kept behind for their questionable gameplay
"How do you know?" Draco exclaimed. He chuckled sadly at the ridiculousness of it all "You're so set on how you think you should be feeling about me outside of these four walls that you're ignoring what's really there-"
Draco looked at Harry, feeling the closeness already turning him on. He craved him so badly and hated how easy it was for Harry to make him fall apart
"Well, either way, Luna and I have been painting a huge banner to hold up at the game, you won't miss us!"
He stroked his hand across the brickwork and stepped back as the wall began to transform into a large door. As it settled, Harry clicked open the handle and walked inside. Draco watched Harry from behind, taking a steady breath and encouraging himself to follow, unsure on where on earth this would lead him
HOWEVER, if this is too over-stimulating for you, and you prefer reading peacefully without music then PLEASE ignore the music suggestions that I've added
"Didn't he tell you he was falling for you?" she asked "People don't change their feelings that quickly"
"Harry, what's the matter? You've been moody and irritable all weekend" Hermione huffed, growing annoyed at his negative state
He scanned the room as his eyes came into focus, darkness filled every corner aside from the slight glimmer of moonlight that shone through the curtains. He was alone, it was a dream.
"You're still fucking annoying though" Harry moaned "I swear, if you make fun of me one more time I will not hesitate to put you in your place, right there in front of everyone"
"Enjoy the rest of your day with that" Harry teased, pointing down at Draco's throbbing erection. Draco stood awkwardly against the sink, his cock still out and shirt hanging off his arms as Harry backed away from him, heading for the exit "and good luck explaining the ripped shirt" Harry  winked, blowing a kiss and heading through the door
Harry slid his fingers through the back of Draco's hair and tugged his head backward, bringing him closer. He thrusted deep in and out, moaning under his breath feeling Draco's heat wrapping around his cock gorgeously
Draco laid for a moment in the silence, letting his orgasm wash over him, trying to regain his breath. He was filled with total shame and humiliation. Nobody had ever seen him weak before, or vulnerable, or submissive.
"I know you have feelings for me, Harry" Draco uttered under his breath "They way you look at me when we're together, the way you hold me. You can't deny that"
"And you know you can use that certain word whenever you need to.." Harry's voice softened as his fingers stroked him delicately. Draco remained quiet, caught up in the intensity of their bonding but Harry was sure he saw a smile grace Draco's lips as he bit down on them in arousal
"Would I be breathing down your neck like this?" Harry leant forward and whispered into his ear, sending shivers throughout Draco's body
Draco swallowed his food, clearing his throat "I um... I'm still rather foggy on those details to be honest. You're the first guy I've been with and.. I really like it"
Draco frowned watching her fill the glass and take a sip so casually, as though nothing had happened. She blew a kiss and waved at Blaise, heading back over to join him. Draco looked down at the glass and the silver sparkles that were fizzing in his drink. It felt wrong. The Slytherin parties were always a blast, but he'd never experienced so much usage of illicit potions, not that he knew of anyway
Draco made more noises. He was desperate. Biting down so hard he was close to drawing blood, his mind racing with pleasure, his body writhing for touch while filled with shame and humiliation
"But you made it pretty fucking obvious" Draco snarled, stepping closer and pointing an accusatory finger at Harry's chest "You made your mind up from the start that you would never date me. You couldn't taint your perfect reputation by being seen with me. Just use me for sex, fuck my feelings! It doesn't affect you!"
Yes, it was shit. And Harry hated it. Yet somehow he knew that Draco was troubled and conflicted and deep down never really meant any of the things he'd said before. The more he thought about it, the more he realised that Draco was remorseful now, he'd stopped making nasty remarks. He no longer bothered Hermione or ridiculed Ron. Draco had softened in the last three months
"Well, I didn't expect that" Harry joked, but Draco kept his eyes to the floor. He didn't have it in him to be snarky or blunt. He had totally exposed himself, he was vulnerable and felt weak at Harry seeing him in this state
Draco made his way back over to the others but Pansy stopped him with the back of her hand. "Look who's here" she said, nodding toward the other side of the room where Harry was standing casually in the corner by the window, lost in conversation with his friends. The light from the lake outside was reflecting off his golden skin casting a blue-ish glow over him, the darkness carving at his sharp features
"Bloody hell" Ron breathed "I've never seen Malfoy speechless before, what did you say to him Harry?"
"Sort of... not intentionally... I just... I don't know what to do, I shouldn't be feeling this way" Draco snapped, angry with himself for letting Harry see him at his weakest
"Wow" Harry mouthed to himself as he closed the door behind him "I see you're ready to apologise for the way you spoke to me earlier?"
Their sex was hungry and desperate, as though they were animals starved of any speck of intimacy. Their minds and bodies filled with a mixture of pure adrenaline, ecstasy, passion. Every touch made Draco crumble with pleasure, every stroke made Harry moan for more.
"This is bloody brilliant!" Ron bellowed through the music, a drink had somehow appeared in his hand and as Harry turned around a glass was slipped into his hand too. He stood perplexed for a moment, and cautiously took a sniff - firewhiskey.
Harry began buttering his toast angrily, scratching the knife against it so hard he was sending crumbs everywhere until a large chunk of butter fell onto his lap and he slammed his knife down on the table
They danced slowly, their bodies almost pressed together. Draco's mind was a total blur, the darkness and the flashing lights made everything blend together in one smooth movement. The alcohol was seriously kicking in, and whatever Pansy spiked the punch with was making him feel all the right things
"Mm!" Draco groaned as Harry's hot breath sent shivers through him. He felt his entire body electrify with ecstasy as his orgasm came crashing over him. His arms were shaking with weakness and his entire body sent spasms of exhilarations through him
"It.. stings" Draco whimpered, pressing his backside up offering himself more and Harry brought it back down with a swish, watching as it connected sharply with Draco's backside
"Apparently.. just.. apple and soda!" Seamus answered, all of them still having to raise their voices to be heard above the noise
Harry shook his head with laughter "For the record I much prefer this kinder Draco. Who knew you were so easy to get along with?"
In that moment, time completely stopped when their lips met. Draco's heart wanted to burst from his chest and his knees fell weak, his mind blacked out into nothing but pure bliss. Every touch from Harry was like pure ecstasy, he was addictive and Draco hadn't realised until now how badly he craved every single part of him. He felt starved as his hands ravished Harry's body desperately wanting to rip every piece of clothing from him right then and there.
He stifled a desperate moan as Harry nuzzled into the side of his neck, muttering through the hot kisses, his hands exploring every part of his gorgeous body "You belong with me, Draco"
Harry thought it was rather fitting how the glow from the lake above the dungeon gave a green-ish tint to almost everything in the room which perfectly reflected the Slytherin colours against the black furniture and silver treasures.
Draco slowly parted from him. Both panting breathlessly caught up in the heat of the moment. Harry stroked the hair from Draco's eyes, his fingers gracing his cheek softly
"You need to understand, Harry.. what we do.. you're in a position of power. You're dominant and it makes you look sexy and strong" Draco swallowed "But me... I'm weak and small and... degraded" he blushed saying those words, he couldn't meet Harry's eyes anymore "It's not who I am, you know that"
Harry crawled forward and dragged his tongue across Draco's cheek, gliding it up to his earlobe and licking slowly. Shivers radiated through Draco feeling Harry's hot breath and wet tongue over his weak spots. He leant into Draco's ear to whisper "I'd love to smother you in cream and lick it off every.. single.. part of you.." he pulled back with a smirk, eyeing down to Draco's cock
Draco took a steady breath and met Harry's eyes. He moved closer, wrapping his hand around the back of Harry's neck and pulled him in to a desperate kiss. Their lips came together, hot and wet and deprived of one another as Draco pushed Harry backwards against the stone wall and reminded him of what they had
Harry stroked his fingers over Draco's cock, remembering how gorgeous it looked the day before in the showers, all wet and hard, sticky with pre come
Draco smiled softly, feeling the warmth in his chest from Harry's words. He settled deeper into the pillow and let himself rest, safely knowing Harry was there
He pushed himself off the bed slowly as to not wake the sleeping boy. Sliding on his shoes he headed toward the door. He wasn't even sure of the time. Hopefully he could sneak back to his room avoiding all questions
Hope you enjoy this chapter! this was a tricky one to write but so happy I finally got to include the others! You'll be seeing much more of them. I've had the idea for the next chapter since I started writing this story and I'm really excited to post it soon! Enjoy & happy reading you lovely lot x
Everyone watching them was on edge, expecting a fight to break out, nobody wanted to step in and break it up. Draco made a mental note to thank his friends for being absolutely no help whatsoever
"Draco, I have my desires just as much as you have yours, you can trust me" Harry looked at the floor, kicking the dust. Despite his confidence even he wasn't used to this newfound kindness between them "Making you feel amazing is the best thing I've ever felt"
"I just did over thirty minutes of cardio with you" Harry winked, biting into a chunk of pancake "I get why you wouldn't be hungry though... seeing as I just filled you up myself" he grinned smugly
Draco cried out, louder this time. His body jerked and he buried his head in the sheets to stifle the moans
Draco opened his mouth to respond but faltered, his gaze dropping once more to his fingers, twirling the loose thread on his jumper sleeve
"You're a coward, Harry"  he whispered, dropping his head back against the wall as the tears arrived. Little did he know, that it was far from over...
Draco remained on his knees as Harry stood back up, he tugged against the cuffs behind his back and felt as the shame and lust fill his chest.
More soft cries escaped Draco's mouth as Harry sped up, pounding him into the sheets. Harry gripped down on Draco's thighs and dropped his head, his body was weakening as he came close to orgasm
I really struggled writing this chapter so I hope it's at least half decent, definitely not my favourite but I'm sure there's more to come
"Am I going to have to gag you, Slut?" Harry growled, leaning down over him to meet Draco's face. Draco was red and flushed with humiliation, he couldn't bring himself to meet Harry's eyes "Am I?"
"Cheers!" Ron grinned, clanking his glass against Harry's and necking the whole thing. Hermione rolled her eyes with a smile
Draco let a moan escape feeling his cock stiffen instantly. He closed his eyes and bit his lip as Harry devoured his neck, their bodies pressed together getting hot and sweaty. Harry's tongue graced the sensitive skin on the side of his neck, it was wet and sloppy but Draco melted, feeling every nerve on his body intensify at Harry's hot touch
"Have you been.. keeping yourself.. stretched for me, Draco?" Harry asked between thrusts with a seductive smile. He adored the image in his mind of Draco locking himself in his dorm room at night and fucking himself to orgasm with toys
Blaise supressed a laugh and Draco faked a blunt smile looking back down at his hands and taking a deep breath "I'm think.. I'm falling for someone"
"I don't really know" Draco chuckled, reminded of how utterly bizarre the whole thing was when Harry cornered him in the showers that day "He just... showed an interest in me and I guess I liked it... more than I realised"
He ran his hands up Draco's arms and graced his cheek slowly and began speaking quietly "What I'm into... is quite intense"
Harry reached around to Draco's arse, tugging the trousers down which exposed the aching erection in his tight black boxers. Pre-cum was already staining the fabric. Harry peeled back the underwear allowing Draco's cock to spring out, gorgeously hard and wet
She turned to Blaise, who simply shrugged at her with a worried smile, indicating he was clueless too
Harry's smirk twisted into laughter as he ridiculed him for his current submissive state "Look at yourself"
Harry sighed, running his hand through his hair to push back the strands that kept falling over his glasses, resigning himself the fact that his whole heart was hurting and it felt as though nothing out there could make him feel truly happy again. He considered the idea of easing himself in with some forbidden drink, regaining his recently diminished confidence and chatting up another gorgeous guy in the darkness of the party.
Blaise fixed Pansy's hair from behind then headed over to the door ready to leave "Do you think you'll come out to other people soon, Draco?"
"and I'm guessing by "Christmas break" you mean, sneak into the Slytherin winter party, wreck havoc and leave again?" Ron cut in
"Jealous are we, Harry? Draco smirked, but his smile dropped upon seeing Harry's icy stare. Harry wouldn't admit that he actually was jealous. He couldn't give Draco that satisfaction. "I-I wasn't flirting! She's just a girl from my house.. we were talking.."
Harry continued planting hot kisses all across Draco's neck, jaw and collarbones, he could feel the blonde squirming underneath him. He grabbed Draco's wrists in each hand and pinned them into the sheets above his head, rendering Draco helpless.
Draco launched forward wrapping his hand around Harry's neck and bringing him crashing onto his lips. Harry pushed into the kiss, sliding his own fingers across Draco's cheek
They had fallen asleep in the room of requirement. He hadn't planned to, realising he must have been so drained from their session the night before that he drifted off while he was recovering. Harry was still fully clothed lying on top of the covers, lost in a dream of his own.
Draco's breath caught in his throat. He saw Harry almost every day anyway and couldn't understand why this felt so much more terrifying. He couldn't peel his eyes away, seeing the boy that had taken his heart so easily
"I deserve.. to be.. punished" Draco's breath grew ragged as Harry stroked him harder, his arms were growing weak as he tried to hold himself up.
"Come on, Harry" her voice softened "It's been a week now, you must find other ways to distract yourself from thoughts of... Draco" she whispered that last part
"Draco! Draco..!" he hurried closer. Draco stopped in his tracks, Pansy was at his side wearing a detestable sneer as she looked over her shoulder at him. Blaise stood waiting further up ahead of them.
Harry kissed his lips softly then traced two fingers under his chin, pulling him back "Maybe.. one day.." he winked and Draco exhaled, exhausted from another twitching erection. "So... charms class or are we going for round two?" Harry asked eagerly
Draco nodded in agreement, sipping his coffee slowly. His eyes were fixed on Harry's, pushing him for more
"I'm going to get some punch!" Hermione called, pushing past through a crowd of screeching girls and wincing at the noise
Draco groaned at this order but adored obeying Harry's demands like a little pet. "Ahhh i-it feels.. s-so good.." he moaned
"I can tell.." Harry lifted the covers and looked down at Draco's erection already standing proud. Draco leant forward and caught Harry on the lips in a soft kiss, their tongues met and soft moans escaped as they held each other, sucking and licking in a passionate embrace
Draco said nothing, he halted on the spot, his eyes scanning the floor for something to say but the pain began to overflow, crashing over him causing tears to well in his eyes, his lower lip trembling
Harry hesitated, feeling that maybe now wasn't the time to admit he'd touched himself four times last night to thoughts of Draco Malfoy
He entered the room quietly, pleased to see that Harry was already shirtless on the bed, looking across at him intently. Closing the door behind him, he kicked off his shoes and felt himself smiling timidly the minute he met Harry's gorgeous green eyes
"Why did I come here? This is his territory, of course he's going to be confident in his own space" Harry groaned, embarrassed at how awkward he was in front of him, Draco was probably laughing at how uncool he'd been
"You're a filthy fucking, whore, Draco" Harry dragged his finger through the mess between Draco's thighs and sucked it off slowly "I think I might just leave you there to sit in your mess"
As far as Haley remembered, Agatha was the girl Simon liked. She groaned. "Please don't tell me you're part of a love triangle. You're far too young for that."
Draco sighed but reached into his shoulder bag and pulled out the enchanted umbrella. After a whispered "
"My face?" Haley echoed, scrambling for her bag and frantically looking for the tiny mirror she always kept in her bag. Where was it? Where
There was a big black dragon in front of her… her mum and dad were waving at her from the other side of a magical mirror… Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground, all the light gone from his eyes…
The beginning of the end. The final exam had finally come. History of Magic. This whole torture was finally coming to an end. There were so many things he planned to do afterwards. Like looking more into the connection between Snape and Lily Evans. And coaxing that secret out of Haley. After the exams. That was what she had promised. And one good thing about Gryffindors was that they always kept their promises.
"Mmm and I love yours" Harry smirked, sliding his grip up and down Draco's leaking cock. Draco moaned out, dropping his head back into the pillow and desperately stifling his cries of pleasure
"There's some cute guys that would definitely date you Draco, what about him?" she pointed at a Hufflepuff boy who was dancing in the centre of the room and making regular eye contact with Draco
"Is it.. Potter?" she asked timidly. Draco shot her a look of both confusion and panic, realising he'd masked himself terribly
Draco buried his face in his hands, his tears turning to anger "Ugh it's so stupid!" he growled, growing increasingly more annoyed at himself "I just.... I think I want more... and he doesn't"
Draco perched on his elbows looking down at him, admiring his first time seeing Harry without his glasses. He looked peaceful.
"I love it when you beg" Harry smirked, biting down "But you're so fucking loud, Slut. I make the demands" Harry grabbed his Gryffindor school tie from the floor below him and slicked it through his hands, holding it tight. He reached over Draco from behind and slid it down in front of his face
"Right" Harry began positioning his own cock against Draco's arse "You're just a filthy fucking plaything... and you belong.. to me" and with that Harry instantly slammed into Draco hard, holding onto his hips and pushing deep
"Dealing with the shame, and the embarrassment.. that's something that I'm sure you'll figure out the more comfortable you get with me" Harry kissed his other hand "But I can reassure you that you're safe with me. I promise" He kissed his nose "and I'll be here whenever you need it"
Harry slowly slipped from the side-lines into the crowd, snaking through the bodies one by one seeing Draco gradually growing closer in his vision. It was so hot amongst all those people, so dark he could barely see where he was walking, only the flashing lights guiding his path through the dance floor
Draco closed his eyes and moaned into Harry's shoulder. Harry sucked hard on his pale skin and he whimpered out at the sting of his lover making his mark.
Draco pouted at Harry pointing out the crying part again, then he settled, reluctantly opening up  "It felt incredible.. what you did. I suppose I need to learn how to handle the feeling.. tell you what does and doesn't feel good for me"
They stopped outside of the door that Harry was sure lead into Draco's bedroom. His heart was pounding in his chest because everything he'd been dreaming of since the day Draco left was to be right back here in this very moment, knowing that Draco wanted him again was like a wave of pure adrenaline
Draco responded with a groan of appreciation and Harry brought his hand down with a couple more smacks, watching as Draco jerked underneath him. Between every three to four strikes Harry would pause, soothing the hot skin with his hands
Harry pushed in slowly, feeling Draco's warmth envelop around his cock. He thrusted deeper, their bodies together holding one another. Harry wanted to feel every part of him, his arms were caressing his torso, shoulders, neck, arms, everywhere
"I wanted you to not be ashamed of me! To not be embarrassed to be seen with me. God forbid the famous Harry Potter dates someone like Draco Malfoy, son of a Death Eater, a Slytherin. It's ridiculous, even you said so yourself. You clearly care too much about what others think of you that I just wasn't important enough"
