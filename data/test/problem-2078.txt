are,” Ron said in an undertone, reminding him. “I haven’t been to a Hogwarts game since Ginny’s eighth year.” Then, louder, “How’s the shop, Nev?”
She shook her head.
He itched to write a response, but what the hell could he say?
Harry let it go, staring at the where the book bulged under the fabric. Something about it...
Ginny gasped and covered her mouth in faux-shame. “Old nickname. I’m horribly petty, in case you forgot.”
Draco looked meaningfully at the book. Harry frowned. “It was rhetorical. You’re the last person I would let near this potion.”
Draco leaned back against the wall, spinning his wand with one hand. “No more than I’m used to.” He looked at Harry’s muggle coat and boots. “Why are you here?”
“To go for your ankles, not your jugular.”
Hopefully.
“It would have made the papers. I hope you gave the tickets to someone who’d enjoy them.”
Underneath the two of them, in the same thin banner script as all the other names, was Draco’s name. That made him Sirius’…first cousin removed?
“I understood it,” Élise pointed out. Ron didn't look surprised.
Ron was looking through the old Christmas photos with a half-smile. “Well, the Black family – historically – hates muggles and anything to do with them. And so does the house.”
anything to me!”
“Alright.” Ron smiled at the waiter as he picked up the money. “Blimey, I could use a cigarette. Hey! If you’re on the wagon, now, we could at
George wrote something down. “What does that mean?”
“Draco?”
“Good choice. I heard Ballycastle’s Keeper lost eight teeth. Played the whole second half spitting blood, and
He stared down at her. This wasn’t just about the snake. There was something else that had her so riled up, but how was he supposed to know? He wasn’t a mind reader.
“He was looking directly at the house.”
“Luna.” Ron rolled his eyes. “She had her face half-covered with a scarf. Even if I hadn’t known who it was, the papers are
“Can you help me? I – I can’t seem to remember…who I am.”
Draco glared at the candle, for lack of eye contact, and swiveled on his heel. Harry followed him around a few tight bends. He had grown up in this place, with access to this library. He knew exactly where this children’s book was without invoking the naming spell. Had he read it before?
Which proved Harry’s point. The disquiet he'd been wrestling with all week (had it really been less than a week?) was getting harder to ignore.
“Moon set is at 10 a.m.. Draco’s in it now.” She held up her hands. “But I brought DVDs and popcorn, so maybe we can wait it out together.”
Things swam into focus, through…glasses? He hadn’t been wearing them before, he was sure. The room was small, sparse.
“If you had your memories back, you wouldn’t be so confused.”
“Oh!” Ron quit fiddling with the ink. “Yeah. That’s a thing now. They’re just Elves, technically.”
Harry scooped up three of the red pieces, reluctantly popping them in his mouth. Lee had a certain glint in his eye that reminded him of George. “What does that mean?”
saying how much you loved the gravy.” She placed the container into a cotton bag with the rest.
“We need to set some ground rules,” he decided, watching it sniff out the warmth suspiciously. “Are you venomous?”
He stepped into the grate and vanished. Harry took another pinch and tossed it in. As the colors turned, he briefly considered just putting it out and going to bed.
It was like a small explosion had gone off – the cacophony ascended to something almost inhuman, and now the
Harry should have known his luck wouldn’t hold out.
Everything hurt. The pain was so intense he had trouble making sense of it
What Hermione wanted from him was less simple than brewing a five-step potion. He kept putting it off, finding other distractions. For example: there was a Weasley dinner to prepare for over the weekend. Bolstered by his success with potion-making, Harry had attempted a casserole. When Molly saw this she promptly burst into tears and spent the rest of the night forcing everyone to at least two helpings. Ron was the only one who seemed to genuinely enjoy it. Hermione and Ginny picked at it with their forks and gave him strange looks. George pretended to vomit it up when his mum wasn’t looking.
“I insist,” Lou said, sidling by George to exit the office. He kept his back to the wall as though Harry were a leper. “I – really – I didn’t expect to – ah.”
bar inside, buzzing with people while the low-lit booths were left empty. Rain pattered the window, an undeniable chill creeping in.
How could that be? What sort of magic – “
“No. But I know it was him.”
Harry wasn’t at all eager for that. He put the box in his pocket and stood, regretful he hadn’t gotten to spend any money. “You haven’t told him?”
“Literary expert,” Harry snorted. “That an official Ministry position?”
“That’s…
The walls and desktops in the Auror office had been Concealed again in anticipation. Draco turned his back firmly to the door, Duplicating the packet of paper until there was one for everyone.
“Yeah. Or you can use the service at Leaky.”
Harry couldn’t explain it. Confidence, that’s what it was. He was confident – bone-deep – that he could defend himself just fine. “I bet I’ll win.”
He nodded, letting her duck past him into the bedroom.
of the fireplace.”
“Harry wouldn’t have asked for a dragon,” Ron reasoned. “Maybe you wanted another owl now that – “
Harry nodded fervently.
Draco snorted, and then hid his face in his hands. It wasn’t until his shoulders started shaking and he snorted again that Harry realized he had well and truly made Draco
He cast two
The ornate iron knocker – some winged, fanged beast – glinted at them. Hermione tapped her wand to its nose and the chipped black door swung inward. “After the Fidelus fell apart, we had to get a fair bit of Ministry sign-off to put up new protections. Just your signature, really, and
“I know – ze customer service needs much work.”
Hermione stared into her own fireplace, then sighed. “I’m going over there Monday. I’ll look at it then.”
Harry gripped his shoulder and pushed him back up. Teddy was worried about him. It felt like he’d failed, somehow. “I was going to say I have Hermione and Ron to keep me in line.

Greenbaum frowned. “Yeah, but they also knew how to muck up these wards.
It was a disturbing thought. “What’s a Kreacher?”

The sofa didn’t even creak as he sat up. “Have you ever made antivenom?”
“I’m going to the
Harry, startled, patted her back. The walls of the room caught his eye first. Every blank space had a framed photo stuck to it, creating the rather dizzying effect of a whole lot of ginger heads smiling at him. He didn’t have time to take it all in before the woman was holding him at arm’s length with a frown.
Parseltongue had been mentioned a few times, in passing. No one ever said what it
“A window,” Mahmoud said. “In the staff library.”
“Who is it?”
“Potions Master Zabini.”
Clearly, Hermione didn’t put much stock in that sort of thing. They talked about Hogwarts while they ate, and she was much quieter than normal.
Draco nodded to the window, his reflection faint and wispy. “I always thought you were a prat. You got away with everything, and I hated it. I hated you.” His head bowed down. “Is that what you wanted to hear?”
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets. “I don’t even know where to start.”
“Harry, I’m
“ – is it the fifth?” George’s voice answered. Bored. “I rather thought it was the third.”
The woman looked between the two of them with increasing concern. Ron’s face was nearing purple, and Harry was really getting tired of this.
Élise gave Debra a reproachful look, but Harry decided he liked her deadpan. It didn’t necessitate a response.
He read over it quickly, huffing through his nose and grinning widely. “Man, I miss it sometimes.”
It stuck its nose up, green scales glittering against the firelight. “
“This, the
, he thought. Ah.
It was unpleasant, which he expected. Everything spun, but it was a closed network so he didn’t see any other fireplaces. There was nowhere to get lost, and it was simple enough to step out of his own. The halt of momentum sent him stumbling, and he fell forward as his foot caught on something.
That made George smile. “I’ll write it down.”
The design went all the way up to the inner crease of his elbow; a snake twisting out of the mouth of a skull, in lines of heavy black ink. Aged, but not necessarily faded.
He sighed. “Happy memories. I don’t exactly have an abundance of those right now.”
“Any word on Dolohov?”
It was early. And cloudy. Something about the weather meant Draco was able to leave the potion unattended, so this trip had been instigated by Draco appearing in his living room, tapping his stopwatch. At least Harry had been wearing a shirt that time.
“It’s nothing the Ministry would approve of you using, I can say that much. And maybe if you didn’t avoid your brother, he’d have mentioned it to you – “
When Harry looked up at the painting again, the god’s eye had closed.

century brought about a mass rebuilding of the Egyptian wizarding societies. The glyphs, when used properly, are incredibly effective. For example…” He leaned forward, and Ron flattened the parchment to the table.
“Maybe I traded for it.”
The other Harry. The one who routinely, it sounded, lied to Ron about his own wife’s whereabouts and allowed his friend to run herself ragged.
Harry thought, wondering if it was all magical theory with those two. Did Draco make jokes with her? He waited, but she didn’t say any more. She just looked at him.
“Ginevra Weasley!”
Ron had taken more time to finish getting dressed. He stood at the parlor window, glaring out at the street like Dolohov would be back any second. “I can’t believe he’s in London. Especially now.”
“You’re keeping it?” Hermione badgered. “You don’t even know if it’s venomous or not. Boomslangs are strong. It could attack you in your – “
“You’ve been awake
“I know.”
“Oh. I, erm, don’t mind.” Was he always such a slob? With a kid living here?
“Wow,” he said. Wizarding cameras were much, much bulkier than this. And louder.
Before she could answer, both sets of curtains flung themselves open with a metal screech. Harry jumped a foot in the air, but Hermione just walked over, peering out at the street.
“You think he knows we’re making a move?” Ron asked, and it only kind of sounded like an accusation.
“I mean it,” Harry sat back on the sofa, putting his feet up. “I’ll stay up.”
Even me. I’ve been going about my week, thinking of you, but I’m thinking of
“I’m not going in there.”
“Hello,” he said. She harrumphed and turned back to the paper. Probably still cross from the Howler situation.
“Harry,” Ron breathed, rubbing a hand over his neck. “That’s not…I mean, I s’pose I appreciate the gesture, but that’s not what want.”
“Oh, yes...It happened around midnight last night,” he said, leading them further down the corridor. The walls were carefully blocked so everything was a straight line, but Harry felt they were walking in a large circle. “If the wards are dismantled, all the clocks come to a stop.” He waved for emphasis as they passed one hung above a doorway, stopped at 12:05 (Harry assumed – the numbers had been replaced by glyphs). “Night security was here within minutes, but the intruder was gone.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry left him to it. It was French dip tonight, or at least an attempt. One of Molly’s recipe cards was propped against the loaf of bread. It was a bit wonky, trying to figure out the right spells for mincing thyme. Severing spells were too wide and aimless. The same Trimming charm he used on his beard worked much better.
“We are. This has gone on long enough.”
“Well, I’m not really in legislation.” He gave her a squinty, knowing look, and her cheeks went a bit dark. “Officially.”
“Yes, well.” Draco stopped smiling, and stopped waving his wand. He picked up the children’s book, only it remained on the table. There were two copies now, seemingly identical in every way. “This should last her five days,” he said, dragging his thumb along the rough edge of the cover.
The neon lights outside shut off suddenly. “I – Probably not,” Harry said. “Crowds. I don’t exactly blend in, do I?”
“That’d be great.”
“To find them, yes. And? All we’ll need is once more. That’s every Death Eater, off the streets.” Ron almost said something else, but bit it back, the
“He said he talked to you.”

“Hannah,” Hermione said quickly, shaking her head.
“I didn’t expect so.” She tapped her wand to her nose absentmindedly. “I’ve thought about it, and it’s strange. I can’t tell you a single thing, even what you already knew.”
“Hermione said to tell you she’d be late tonight.” Harry had only seen her long enough for her to snatch the book out of his hands and give him a hug. Whatever those two pages contained, she was sure to know by the end of the week. There was a determined look to her eye that Harry was starting to understand.
He remembered the name from Teddy’s letter. “You know her?”
“Hmmm…no comment. But he didn’t mention any of your mess.”
“Surely not,” Harry agreed.
she said. “Welcome. We have been expecting you. Allow me.”
“If it eases your mind, Potter, I can assure you I haven’t been scrubbing floors and mending walls.” He pulled his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around. It made him look even more painfully thin. “It’s the house.”
line of Daydream Charm. But Britain’s pornography laws are farcicle as it is, so arguing that was a walk in the park.”
He got pointedly louder at the end, met with an equally pointed silence from the other room. “Anyway, it’ll be a blast. Werewolf for the Weekend are playing the halftime, and Ilkley Stadium was approved for the first ever firework-replay. At the very least, that’ll be a laugh if it goes bad.”
“Why?” Harry asked, leaning in. “Why is it me and her against you?”
Ron loped off to find it. Harry walked their dishes to the sink and sat them down, looking at the sudsy water and masala and thinking hard about living in the moment.
“Ron just stormed in all upset about something, and a few minutes later Hermione came in, and now they’re having a row in Harry’s office.”
“What are you getting for ‘im?”
But she was quiet.
He didn't notice Harry's dark look. The gate creaked shut behind them. Harry swore he saw one of the gargoyles swiftly twist a key in the lock.
She pursed her lips and stuck out a gloved hand. He took it warily. “You may call me Minerva.”
“Only half,” Ron chuckled, leaning forward to snag it closer, handing over one Styrofoam box. Harry whipped it open, inhaling the steaming grease and fish smell.
Harry’s stomach twisted in knots. “Oh, no.”
The words came slowly, long pauses in between. Hermione was no longer teary-eyed, but clearly still out of it.
“Who do we report to?”
, because, y’know, getting you back to normal is the thing that has her so worked up.
“Right. You
Hermione seemed to subconsciously realize he was looming over her like a ghoul, and snapped awake with a startled
“Hey,” Ron said, probably surprised to see him. No one had asked him to come in, after all. “What’s going on?”
It was just past noon, and Hermione didn’t usually leave work so early. Unless this
His stomach gave a weak cry. “I actually needed to talk to you. It’s about the fireplace.”
“Alright, Ted?” Dean asked on his way out, patting his shoulder. Teddy grinned at him and shook hands with Seamus.
Harry winced. “Wouldn’t that be cruel?”
“I know.” He nodded his head at the door. “We’re gonna give you a…crash course. On the war.”
“Password?” She asked imperiously.
That last part was accusatory. Harry weighed his options before speaking.
“Nothing I feel comfortable putting to words,” she said.
“He’s
“More than almost anything.” He nodded to himself and raised the bottle in a silent toast before finishing it. “To Quidditch.”
“Let’s duel, then.”
“Hi.”
“You’re growing pumpkins.”
boring, then Draco and Hermione should get along very well.
Ginny snorted. “Well, yes.” She nudged him with her shoulder. “Will you come see me play? The fourteenth, at Allen Bog.”
Harry Vanished the wrappers, standing and pulling Teddy to his feet. “Library sounds boring.”
She picked through his fridge. “A mad bunch of hissing. Did you know I used to buy all your groceries?”
Harry’s quill scratched as he re-wrote Ron’s words into his own.
get stains out the old fashioned way.”
Ginny patted her head, giving Harry a sly look. “She has Fleur’s grace with words.”
“So you prepared. While cursebreaking in the meantime. I don’t know, Draco. I don’t think it’s too late for you at all.” He considered reaching out, but refrained. Draco looked jumpy. “We’re in this together. And I’ll help you see it through to the end.”
“Yes,” he said, reproachful. Harry smiled. “Of course I will. You said you’d be here for the first Gryffindor game – we’re against Slytherin.”
“No.” Her eyes darted back to the door. “I don’t think it belonged to you.”
“Yes, perhaps,” Draco said, after a pause. “I much prefer you as you were.”
He stopped talking when Harry looked up, eyes dancing away. Another feint, another conversation Harry was only half-involved in.
capable of reading between the lines. He knows I generally...don’t cause trouble.”
“You must have a lot of questions.”
“I’ll give you an answer to that when I’ve got one.” She leaned up on her toes to peck him on the cheek. “Don’t worry about it, okay?”
“If you don’t mind, I’d like to ask
” Teddy whispered to her. She glanced from him to Harry, fanning herself a bit faster and leering.
The next landing had three doors. Hermione stopped at the first and opened it without going in.
“Mum’s flipped, though,” he muttered, gazing into the distance. “She’s owled me five times today, wanting to come see you. She doesn’t know…well, if you get a Howler about it, I’m sorry.”
Potter. Was that his name? It didn’t sound familiar. “I w-woke up in the forest. Someone must’ve attacked me.”
Its was suddenly very hard to swallow. This would have been a lot easier before he’d read that letter. “How much do you know about my work?”
Ron breathed, as the Seekers both twisted at the last second. They still fell onto the grass, but it was more of a controlled roll than a wreck.
“Not Macnair or Dolohov. That’s two.” He held up two fingers to match, ticking off as he went. “Malfoy’s dad is in Azkaban, as are Rookwood, Rowle, and Crouch Jr.” He put down his index finger, leaving only five. “Who doesn’t count. So, the way I see it, we need to ease off the search.”
“I thought…but Hermione was right. I can’t do this to him.” Harry scrubbed at his face. “I don’t want to.”
After lunch, he was too busy to chat and Harry certainly wasn’t going to seek out Hermione. He went home, did laundry, watered the pumpkins (easing off the MagiGro for now, as it was over a month until Teddy was due back and they were already straining out of their pots).
“Don’t have to tell me.”
His back was against the wall in seconds, sending something clattering to the floor. “What – um – “ He pointed his wand, and Hagrid hurriedly pushed his wrist down.
“Stop!” Harry said as the snake slithered closer to him. Only adding to the shock of the scene, the snake actually did stop, it’s beady black eyes turning to Harry.
“Whatever the curse was, there’s no visible reason it should have affected you this much. No head trauma, no degeneration.”
Oh, Christ. “Guess not,” he mumbled, earning another smile. Chagrin must have been what she expected.
Ron nodded. Harry shifted his weight, aware that it sounded like he’d been giving him false hope. “She’s trying.”
the Pensieve.”
“That often?” Harry asked.
more interesting than you losing your memories! Why did nobody
Draco’s hand convulsed around his wand, then released it, leaving it on the floor. “We’ve not spoken for eleven years. I don’t know you.”
The first light of dawn forced his eyes open and brought to attention his aching neck. He and Hermione had slumped toward Ron like dominoes. He sat up and rubbed his forehead. They had been talking, trying to stay awake. Hermione regaled him with stories from their Third Year  - time-turners and hippogriffs.
“Some of the blokes in Transportation thought it might be Madame Rashida,” Debra said, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Any comment?”
There was utter silence for a long second, then something shifted behind the shelves. He walked toward the sound, and as he passed the armchair one of the candles floated up from the stand and zoomed over to him. He was so startled he almost didn’t realize it was trying to lead him somewhere.
“But. In the meantime…” She chewed her lip. “In the meantime, you need to show up. Be seen. People will start to talk if you just disappear. The amnesia story is contained.” She ticked off with her fingers. “The Healers know. They won’t talk. The other Unspeakables obviously won’t.”
Light opened up, and then they were on top. It was quite a lot to take in, all at once. The stands were packed, easily fitting the entire school in narrow rows. One half of the stadium was decked out in red, maroon, or gold blankets (and hats, and scarves, and any article of clothing Harry could name). A long line of students to the center top each held a wooden pike that supported a huge, sprawling tapestry that showed an animated lion chasing around a snake. The other half was green, silver, and black. Instead of a banner, they passed around an enormous, papier mache serpent, like a Chinese dragon, nearly.

Her eyes narrowed. “Are

, and then I heard you scream, and you were gone. We couldn’t find either one of you.
Hermione frowned dubiously and turned to Neville and Luna. “We’ll meet you at the Broomsticks.”

sake,” he said. He must never speak to Hermione like that, because she gasped and Ron’s eyebrows met his hairline. Harry gentled his tone. “I didn’t do it, alright?
Harry. Did you know?”
“You’ve been reading up,” Hermione said quietly.
Ron looked out the window again, face suddenly impassive. “Did she explain it to you?”
when there’s an eight-ton Ironbelly chasing you through a Ukranian cave system.
Draco shook his head, mouth tight. “I believe the sight of you would put my mother into cardiac arrest.”
Greenbaum nodded them towards an opening in a big gate separating the main body of the building from the street. The temperature couldn’t be above ten degrees, so the courtyard was mostly empty, save a few bodies hurrying from one destination to another. The path was lined in fading green shrubbery and bright orange treetops, converging on four suspiciously empty benches surrounding a statue.
Again, he heard what went unsaid. Possible…but unlikely. If he could be fixed with magic, the Healers would have done it already.
A name Harry hadn’t heard yet. Maybe Sirius’ brother? There was a family tapestry in the drawing room he had yet to look at.
“I know. I couldn’t remember…”
Harry had stopped listening, ice cold terror shooting down his back. “What do you mean, not permanent?”
Gray eyes fell on him, ice cold and distant. He stood so abruptly that Harry briefly entertained the idea he was being attacked. Ron would love that.
“We can’t use magic on those bloody books. Not even the ones with teeth.”
.” He blinked. “
Once that danger had passed, Harry jogged up the staircase. His footfalls seemed very loud in the huge room. Thankfully the second floor had carpet. He went left, looking at all the ornate, closed doors. The air up here smelled even staler, like dry hay or something. Unused.
“Why?” Ron asked, indignant.
He hoped Teddy wasn’t waiting on a response.
He levitated some of Victoire’s toys. She would laugh and reach up for them, toppling over and rolling around until he or Fleur set her back up.
Harry leaned against the mantle, alarmed. “We had lunch.”
Quaffle!”
The bored twenty-something behind the check-out gave a thumbs up. George beckoned Harry up the steps, giving him a few seconds to take in the tea-and-biscuit flavored soap display as he pulled a keyring from his pocket and opened up a door.
Then, very small in the corner, like he’d scribbled it so no one else could see:
“Gay,” Harry finished, with a bit of relief. “I figured.”
“Oh.” Harry’s chest suddenly hurt. “Ron, I - “
“Leave it, ‘Mione,” Ron said, unexpectedly harsh. “This is why he doesn’t tell you stuff.”
“I don’t know why Draco’s so afraid of you,” Harry muttered. “I wish he wasn’t. It would do him some good to get out of that house.”
George turned to stare at the man, then a very suspicious look of shock crossed his face.
She paused long enough to take a breath. “You’ve seen one, you just don’t remember. The Hogwarts Pensieve is unique in that the Founders used four shared memories as their seed. A complex bit of magic, and lasting. Anyone can add to it – student or staff. It’s a piece of living history.”
There was hope in her voice, maybe even some sort of apology. Harry looked at Ron.
Harry nodded. “Alright. I’ll…try. But I think he’ll see right through me.”
LOOKS LIKE MARKS LANDED A GOOD ONE THERE – “ The Slytherin player stumbled backward from a nasty punch to the stomach. “HERE COMES THE REFEREE, WILL HE
“Obviously, I’m not doing anyone any good here,” Harry said quickly. Ron came to a stop in front of him, apology written all over his face. “I’ll just go home, yeah? Let you all do your jobs.”
The look Draco gave him was highly annoyed. “And you’ll tend to the potion? It has to be stirred every other hour.”
A group of costumed children passed by on the street, shepherded by shivering adults. Harry trailed behind them, unnoticed. It was quite busy, tonight, every porchlight on and awaiting more trick or treaters.
“Candy. Out next month.” Lee showed him how to fold along the perforations, and how the finished product shaped into a block-bottom container with a film window. “Sort of like muggle wine gums?”
______________________
The doors slid open, onto a well-lit, normal looking reception area. Hermione didn’t follow him.
Ginny and George shared a wide-eyed look.
“I will fix it, Harry. I always do.”
The deep pink ones looked like pansies, but he didn’t recognize the others; tiny red flowers all clustered together in a single stalk.
After a long pause, Draco set the quill down and curled his fingers around his wand. “You thought you’d ask me…what?”
“Blood purity,” Ron said, watching him. At Harry’s lack of a response, he went on. “I’m a pure-blood. That means I don’t have any muggles in my ancestry. Hermione’s parents are both muggles. That makes her a muggleborn. Anyone in-between is a half-blood. Got it?”
“Thanks,” he said uncertainly, brushing a loose curl behind his ear. Hermione beamed and turned back for work. Harry stepped into the lift and closed his eyes for a moment, rummaging around in his own head in case anything had changed. Didn’t seem that way, but then it never did. What kind of biscuits? He poked his tongue around his teeth. Raisin? And shortbread, perhaps.
“Oh.” Harry filed that away to ask Hermione about later. “I think I have a solution for that.”
“Do I…”
Ron and Hermione’s was already very clean. He had just noticed the odd speck of dust or wayward sock under the couch. The dust was always places too high for Hermione to see and the socks were always Ron’s. He also did their dishes, and vacuumed the carpets. Hermione was extremely disturbed by this.
“Only twenty minutes.” George sounded disappointed. “I’ll up the dosage a bit on the next batch.”
To hear the Weasleys tell it, Fred had been the mastermind of the two. The one who came up with all the chaos, or at least took the blame. Harry would have assumed that was George.
Harry said quickly. Castor murmured his assent, but didn’t back down.
“Yes!” Ron said, perking back up. “You haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, either! I’ll take you!”
She looked almost as shocked as Ron had, her brown eyes wide and affronted. “Care for a round?”
Draco put his attention back to the books, pulling out a narrow thing, more cover than pages. It looked ancient, too old to be touched by gloveless hands. He set it down and started waving his wand over it in even, straight lines. A Duplication charm.
There was some more muttered, hungover conversation. Harry looked around, charmed. The town was settled into the bottom of a hill. Pine, birch and alder trees spanned every direction in a wide spectrum of oranges and yellows, bleeding out into foggy mountains and hills.
“I have to talk to whoever’s in charge of – “
“With muggle money?” Ginny asked doubtfully, crossing her arms.
“What are you reading?”
“Current, former Ministry employees who attended,” Ron tacked on, waving at a pair of plain-clothes people walked past them on the steps. The Shield wizards. “
“Dolohov?”

Harry nodded. “Sure. Tomorrow?” His eyes fell on the plastic bag as Ron nodded. “S’that for me?”

“What’s he talking about, Harry?” The brother next to George asked, frowning. “What happened?”
“I didn’t – “

his family. He positively fawned over Victoire and wrote to Teddy more often than Harry got to. And he had Lee!
Ron’s face lit up. “You remember!”
No one is taking you away from me.”
“You mean a possible motive,” Harry said, trying to sound Auror-like.
“I have to do that
“Would you kill Dolohov or Macnair if it came down to it?”
“Is Hermione coming?”
Ron rolled his eyes. “Sorry, ‘Mione. I’ve been trying to get a word in.”
He came an abrupt stop at the edge of the trees, where thick underbrush turned to untamed bushes. This could have been a garden, once, but it wasn’t what had caught his attention. It must have been his imagination, but something appeared to have moved in one of the windows. A flash of white.
adding enough light for Harry to stop squinting
“It’s the squid,” he whispered, leaning up on his toes. “He’s friendly, I think.”
“Mr. Potter.”
,” Draco breathed. The book snapped shut and he pushed it off his knee, standing without tripping by doing something complicated with his wrists that moved the fabric of his robes just so. “So that’s what this is about. You want to know why you did it.” He turned and walked to the window, crossing his arms. “Everyone’s told you I should be locked up, am I correct?”
“I don’t mind,” Harry said. “I want to know.”
“I understand that. But what I’m asking, really, is if there’s anything off.” At his confused look, she continued. “Like, mentally? Or…physically, even. Not something the Healers would have noticed. More like…little flickers.”
, because, y’know, I just figured I’m a depressed drunk. Y’know?”
“Mum, hold up – “
Harry said again. George stopped at the door that led to his flat. “I was really scared. I would have sent a Patronus to the Aurors if I could – “
“Karkaroff came by quite frequently to make use of the…older texts,” he said meaningfully. Hermione looked a little less outraged, but whatever the context was went right over Harry’s head. “He brought a student, once or twice, when I was young. Their curriculum is much stronger on history than Hogwarts', though. Especially the Persecution.”
“That’s my son,” Harry said, standing in the entry way. Draco set the frame down very quickly, on the edge of the table where he’d found it.
“Don’t be rude,” Hermione admonished.
Friday was spent at the Archives. Half the team was away collecting on an ignored fine subpoena from the Wizengamot, leaving Harry, Ron and Dean to trudge into the Camden Catacombs.
“Oh, spare us,” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “The safehouses have stores of potions. He got Polyjuice from one I haven’t cleaned out yet."
It would just be a lie to say any of those things were keeping him awake.
“Hiya, Miss Luna,” Teddy said.
George crossed his arms. His face was empty of any emotion, which was strange. “So it was you.”
“I suppose.”
“Which part?”
not a school.
“What?” She looked over, then seemed to realize who she was talking to. “Oh. Yes. She was our head of Gryffindor house. Fought in the war, of course. She’s known you since you were a baby. And she’s bloody terrifying, I might add.”
And much colder. He pulled his cloak tighter, shivering at the punishing wind. The sky was dark, committing to neither rain or snow.
“As I see fit,” she said. “I’m not trying to intrude, I’m trying to
“Fuck,” the man said. “What are you doing
Harry focused his eyes on the fabric draped over the back of her seat. It would look like a blanket to anyone else. Ron had dropped it off a few days after the Dolohov sighting. Apparently Harry had lent it to him. The fabled Cloak of Invisibility, mentioned frequently in both Teddy’s letters and Ron’s recounting of epic Hogwarts malfeasances.
Draco’s bedroom door still sat open, but Harry knocked anyway, rapping against the door frame with his knuckles. The bed rustled as Draco sat up sharply. He was shadowed, his hair lit brilliant white in profile.
A hand slid down his arm, depositing glasses into the palm of his hand. He put them on gratefully, locating his wand stuck against the couch leg. Draco resumed his position on the floor.
of my memories away is a good move?”
Harry pulled the door shut behind him. The entire room reeked of tension. “Seamus was scared. What’s going on?”
She was teasing, he knew, but it was still a bit on-the-nose. “You know my secret.”
“Hm,” he said, sitting. “And
He felt George looking at him. “This store is what kept Diagon Alley alive after the war. I’m literally the

“No,” he said firmly. “She needs you. Clearly, whatever it is she can’t manage on her own… she doesn’t think I can manage, either. As frustrating as that is, I know she’s right. It’s always been you.”
“I was just about to go gather some lunch. Thought you could use a look around in here. Maybe it’ll jog something, eh?”
She nodded, holding the mug out. Harry took it. “Well, it’s nothing we were taught. Divination as we know it is Celtic in origin, more based in astrology and…other rubbish. The goal is to discern the future. This – the Greeks called it
“Did you like the game?” Teddy asked, diverting his attention back.
“Wright Way, Victoria.”
you. Have you got
They were chatting over the shower stall divide when the changing room door banged open.
Shedding their outerwear and boots, they sat in a private room and waited for a mousy blonde wizard to bring them the documents they’d been working on all week. An ancient Auror manuscript had them particularly stumped – the cursive was so spindly and rushed it looked more like artwork than actual English. Their time on it was wasted - the gist seemed to concern Horcruxes, but it wasn’t as detailed as any of them would have liked.
you give them back? You mean you – ”
“Lead the way. I’m starving.”
, Harry thought with dismay.
“Details, details,” George dismissed, sipping his tea while he wrote. Harry continued parsing out anything explosive – intestinal or otherwise – until only the relatively inane candies and games remained.
“Jesus,” he said. “I don’t guess I had a party here?”
“Because of the moon?”
“How – how did he seem to you?” Harry asked, turning. Ron’s eyebrows were pulled low as he wrestled with Minerva’s parting statement.
“I’m right here.”
He met Ron and Hermione at half-past nine Saturday morning. The cold was blistering in Hogsmeade. Wind whipped leaves and spare droplets of rain into their faces as they Apparated near the trailhead. Harry had done his best to layer up in winter robes and two pairs of socks, but still felt underdressed. Ron and Hermione had matching lopsided hats and scarves, a little too amateur to be from Molly.
“Sorry, mum. Harry can wait.” She winked at him as she took another great bite of potato. Harry smiled weakly, glancing up at the one who must be George. He slouched low in his chair, feet up on the table, whittling something with a short blade as he argued with the shorter one. Long, shaggy hair almost covered up the jagged pink curse scars that marred the skin where his ear should have been.
“I haven’t left the house in two weeks. I only went to collect some things from Pansy. That was the end of it.”
a moon-faced skrewt.”
“One more,” Draco said, nodding to the last mark. Harry turned forward and held his wand light lower.
“I want to see him,” he said. He had to make sure…of what, he had no clue. When these people looked at him, it was like they expected something. It was bloody terrifying, frankly. He’d feel better if he could just see that Draco was okay. It was the least he could do.
“Is that – ?” He stopped himself, about to ask if that was safe. Clearly, it wasn’t. He saw a group of students in matching green scarves come to a quick halt at the top of it, turning for another as it rotated over to the landing. Fuck – surely there was at least one blind student?
“Hm.” Harry observed his white-knuckled grip on his pint. “Is that any good.”
“Hermione!”
“I don’t expect that,” Harry murmured. “Not with something like this. Has he written you?”
Harry waved it away, feeling stupid, and handed Hermione her wand. Seeing Ron reminded him of what he’d forgotten.
“What about Ginny?”
“This room is spotless,” he said, with a touch of incredulity, walking behind a couch. The fabric was ancient and colorless before. Now it sparkled in powder-blue jacquard. The rug no longer frayed at the edges. “I bet all the others are, as well.”
Harry cringed internally. It wasn’t how he wanted it to go when he… well, it wasn’t like the forest. There was no blood or desperation. Draco was all drawn and impenetrable, obviously tired but still on his guard.
He smiled at that. “She’d take my side over Hermione’s on a chilly day in Hell.”
She gestured to the chair in front of her desk; an ancient, spindly thing that matched the rest of the set. A large painting behind her depicted Gringotts from street level, a night sky above complete with shooting stars at repetitive intervals. It was much nicer than the unicorn.
“…Hereby release all possession of any memories and experiences gained while visiting the Department of Mysteries. Such memories and experiences are limited to questioning, consumption of food and non-food materials, relinquishing of personal fluids and epithelial cell samples.
“The Burrow,” he sighed, putting one foot into the warm fire. “What the hell is a Burrow?”
“Yes?”
The scar was thin, but long. It traveled from almost his hip up to his ribs, a light beige that stood out against the deeper brown of his skin. He exhaled a shaky, relieved breath. There had been so much blood before.
“What’s that for?” He asked.
“Hermione…” he sat on the edge, curling his hands together in his lap. “Seems to be the only person completely put off by my lack of memory. The others…I dunno, it’s like I’ve come back from a long trip.”
“No, you weren’t. Aren’t. I mean - yeah.” He cleared his throat again. “Sorry. It’s weird to have you staring at me like that.”
“Sorry about that.”
Ron and Hermione shared a look that Harry just caught. He rolled his eyes and bought the next two rounds as a bribe to stay out of the spotlight. It worked – they passed the next few hours talking about other things, leaving Harry to sit and take in as much as he could. At some point, it was just too much. Names, places, events. The sounds of their voices became more comforting than their words.
“It’s magic?” Teddy asked. “That did this to you?”
Ron had a hard look to his face, but not an angry one. Hermione was trying to examine Harry from the corner of her eye, which he was of course growing used to.
.” Debra limped past them. Teddy stepped far out of her way. “See you lot there.”
Charlie blinked, and smiled wider, taking Harry by the arm. “Cider, then. And mum’s breaking out the photo albums.”
He was vaguely aware of the feathers flocking to Ron’s face, forming a beard and moustache. Ron was madly trying to fight them off, Hermione was desperately trying to get back inside, and Hagrid yelled for them to keep Butcher outside. But the

“When was the last time you saw a game? In person?” Harry interrupted.
“Good.” Her eyes were wide.
“We’re on duty, Rosmerta,” Debra sighed. Harry thought that was only half the reason – they all still showed the signs of their late night.
never heard of a wizard Mason, but you could look that up, as well.”
do you plan to be of any use to us?”
“It kills,” he said uncertainly. It was more a guess than a fact. But Hermione nodded, and she didn’t tell him what it was.
Draco had basically told him to be scarce until the antivenom was ready for its next step on Wednesday. Two days from now.
Slowly, Draco nodded his head, turning to the wall of shelves. “No, I suppose not.”
Neville, finally, helped him with the mystery of the snake’s name. Harry owled him at Hermione’s suggestion, making the snake describe it as best he could. Neville said it sounded like Castor bean. A leafy plant with red bark and prickly burrs.
“Any word?” Ginny asked him over Sunday dinner. They’d taken their plates out to the Burrow’s garden, sitting on the steps just the two of them. It was chaotic enough that no one noticed their absence inside. Ron and Hermione were focused on each other (inasmuch as Hermione could focus on anything these days – she still looked sickly tired most of the time), in silence or quiet conversation or just strange looks. Harry hoped they had talked things out. Neither of them had brough up the time turner or the fight to him again.
run away from you in the last five seconds.”
Hermione had climbed up to stand next to Luna. Instead of participating in the storm of applause, she stared at Harry with something akin to fear. There was no amusement anywhere on her face – and he didn’t understand. Everyone else had seemed chuffed.
He rode the next two days on a bit of a high. Childish, but fun. Getting Draco drunk had been a happy accident, but it had revealed something interesting: their conversation had flowed too naturally and easily – the wine hadn’t made it easier for Draco to talk to him, it had made it

gotta make sure she doesn’t sleep an entire day.”
“What the…” he only glanced over the article. They were speculating on a secret office romance for whom he was…
Yet another tear streaked down his pale cheek. If Harry bottled it, would it be a memory, too? Was Draco weeping dreams?
“Should be,” Debra muttered.
They both looked shocked. He almost laughed.
“Probably.” Definitely not. “Y’know, everyone keeps telling me how great this place is? I’m not so impressed.”

Harry didn’t understand at all. “And it’s not like I…make a
“Yet,” Debra added flatly. Draco only glanced at her, his eyes sweeping back to Ron as he spoke.
Harry nodded. “If I was cursed – ?”
“I – “ Draco touched the skin under his eye, then sniffed. “I have a natural predisposition to looking ill. Nothing for it.”
“Fun,” he repeated. “How? Does she do tricks?”
“That will keep it warm,” she said, then crossed her arms. “I assume from the color it’s at least half.”
“You think I’ll be attacked in the street?!”
“It’s
“Just pick out the stuff that
Two boys sprinted down the long hall, robes billowing. One of them had bright purple hair, and Harry felt a grin steal over his face. He opened his arms just as Teddy barreled into him. His head came to Harry’s shoulder, which surprised him. He’d expected shorter.
The front door burst open, and Hermione marched in, shaking Ron’s hand away as he tried to stop her. “What is going on in here?”
He wasn’t even sure Ron would bring up the Hermione stuff with George. Harry just wanted him to be able to have a meaningful conversation with someone who knew him better than Harry did at the moment. He was trying to be a good friend and George was making it awfully difficult.
His bad shoulder throbbed from where he’d landed on a book. It smelled like something was burning. That got him to his feet, looking all around. The Floo flames died out, and there didn’t seem to be another source of the smell but for the cauldron.
She stood paralyzed, staring at him like she’d never seen him before. Harry didn’t blame her. He felt quite deranged. But he was also furious. And scared.
Harry had wondered over that a lot - how it would be when Teddy wasn’t at school. When Harry got to wake up and see him every morning and feed him and put him to bed at night. Even if eleven year olds were too old to be put to bed, they could still stay up late together, or fall asleep on the couch the way he and Ron did. Or was that too chummy? Should he be firm and disciplinarian about it?
The week marched on, and Harry did not recover his memories. There was no miraculous, enlightening zap of brainpower that snapped him out of it. Just a gradual settling into this life.
“No, really. Go after it, I s’pose? It’s not like dating was ever gonna be

Someone. Harry understood now what Hermione meant by “
“Quiet Moon?”
“He really seemed okay, Harry. I’m sure McGonagall’s going to talk to him about it.”
Ron unscrolled a long, crowded document with about a hundred small drawings arranged in two columns. Some were clearly Egyptian in origin, but the others were more minimalistic. “Can you think of anyone who would want access to this information?”
As if on cue, his stomach grumbled. Hermione smiled.
“Nothing,” he said. “Just…long day.”
,” Ron said, slapping a finger down one a photo from Grimmauld Place. “Is Kreacher. He was the House Elf.”
She bounced on her toes, warming herself. “It was just a spat. We’re fine.”
In a wordless jilt, Harry lifted the tip of his wand, peeling the layers apart and sussing out the differences. “There’s someone else, isn’t there?”
he thought to the hundreds of voices,
Harry hoped he would never need it. It sort of scared him, honestly.
“You liked Molly Weasley’s cooking well enough. I suppose I’ll have to keep bringing it by,” Harry challenged, raising an eyebrow. Draco’s lips parted, smiling wide enough to show his teeth. The inner parts of his mouth were stained red.
Harry scratched his beard, scowling. “I just said I

“I’m married to a fucking Unspeakable, that’s what,” he snapped. Harry froze. “One who thinks it’s okay to just – “
. Ron yelled again.
“Four days,” she chastised, fussing with his hair just like Ron had and clapping her hands lightly to his cheeks. Her voice was a much warmer, quieter version of the Howler’s. Though perhaps just as shrill. “
“Oh, it is,” Draco pulled his hands behind his back, taking slow steps as he browsed the dusty bookshelves set into the wall. The look he shot over his shoulder was overly-innocent. “To Durmstrang students.”
it said, finally. “
talk to him.
Draco didn’t look so sure, but it seemed Ron’s question had a calming effect. “No. He can’t stop it.”
“And we have wanted posters all over,” Ron said. “Everyone knows what Dolohov and Macnair look like.”
Her bun wobbled as she shook her head. “Doesn’t matter.”
me all that before.”
"Hermione," he said. She met his gaze reluctantly. "I'm not holding my breath." Her mouth tightened into a line, so he hurried on. "What's done is done - I told Teddy, so...so now he knows."
“Er, is this because she’s muggleborn?” He blurted.
He was eleven, Harry reminded himself. Too old and secretive to be opening up to anyone but his closest friends. Teddy would talk about it – if there was anything to talk about – when he was ready, and not before. His most recent letter to Harry had been a brief summary of the rest of his weekend, giving the impression of being too busy to really elaborate. It was happy, though.
He glanced back at the sleepy little town as they went up. The rooftops had a thin layer of frost that was quickly melting away, leaving a sparking dew on the chimneys and gutters. The houses all looked warm and cozy, making Harry ache for his morning tea and a fire.
The last bit came out more forcefully than hospitably. Draco looked shell-shocked. “I have.”
“I don’t – It’s difficult to explain.”

“I’ll referee,” it said in George’s voice, climbing up Ginny’s shoulder. “But I
Draco met him a few minutes later, again in muggle clothes and not robes. The bulk of yet another jumper hid his thinness. He pulled the Cloak from Harry and put it on, only speaking when he was no longer visible.
On instinct alone, Harry walked over and pulled her into his arms. She clutched his shirt and pressed her forehead to his shoulder. It was a bit awkward, holding this stranger. But she clearly needed it, and this was the most he could give her right now.
“It’s been a rough day, alright?” George dropped his head back to the wood, heaving a sigh. “Harry doesn’t remember that I’m his lover.”
“Not really. Like it or not, you
Harry didn’t think that conversation had been particularly productive, but so long as they weren’t fighting anymore. “He did.”
Ron, long desensitized to this news, only nodded.
It wasn’t until he left that he realized she’d locked the doors after he came in, putting up the closed sign. About forty people were standing at the windows, watching him shop.
Clearly, they all were waiting for him to have some sort of reaction. He just didn’t know what to
Mud had filled his shoes, so his feet squicked and squished when he started walking. Every few meters, he would run into a tree trunk. The wet, rough bark cut at his hands when he reached out, leaning heavily against it. He had to get help. Losing blood was bad. He should…he should do something…
He only got out of pub night by making up a complete lie about George needing him. It was a spur of the moment thing, but Ron and Dean had accepted it without even a blink.
“Are you going to whisper about me? Or are you going to come get this Quaffle?”
“Remind me to actually go up there next time.”
“It’ll go on like that until someone sings all of
Nothing in that particularly surprised him, but it was ominous. “Do you think Teddy’s safe?”
Ron frowned at Debra, who leaned around Dean to address Harry.
She dug in her pocket before handing over a cell phone. He almost didn’t recognize it as such, because the one he already owned was so much different. His flipped open. This one was one long, smooth piece of glass. It looked a lot more breakable.
“Potter,” Minerva said, hand tight on his shoulder. He blinked away the sudden burning in his eyes. “Let me know if you need anything at all.”
“I thought you might have shaved.”
"Maybe a bit."
Harry looked up as they approached a high wall. Teddy was in there, somewhere. Harry hadn’t told him an exact time. Was he waiting?
wards. That puts every Ministry-guarded estate at possible risk.”
“I didn’t ask you to – “
“The team knows,” Ron said. “That’ll be fine. And Shacklebolt. We have to tell mum, though. He’ll never get it past her. Or Ginny.”
“My point, I guess, is that yeah, it took a long time for any of us to recover. But you never have. Not really, I don’t think. It took three years for you to even start laughing again. It was so scary to look at you sometimes, Harry. It’s like there was
Hermione looked immensely relieved. “I believe in you. And here.”
“Gryffindor colors, mate,” Ron said from inside quickly. He was doing great at
“I really would like to help,” Harry said truthfully, stirring masala with his wand. “It’s still my name on the door.”
It was incredible. He almost moaned as flavor exploded across his tongue, and Ron gave him a knowing look, tucking into his own plate and yelling across the table at Charlie about dragons. It wasn’t that Harry was being left out, exactly. It was that he wasn’t being pressured to join.
Draco nodded. “According to the paper, I’ve been stirring up trouble in the government. But Dolohov

The formless, undefined roar focused into one word. His stomach turned. “
“You started trying, for Teddy.” Ron sat up, not meeting his eyes. “You’re a great dad. Really. You give him everything.
“How far along were you?”
“What’s she like?”
. After our second meeting.”
“Floo,” he finished, grimacing. “I know.”
Teddy said in a strange tone, eyes wide. The floor seemed to crumble out from under him as he realized the entire stadium had their faces turned to the Staff box.
“You need someone,” Harry said softly. “And I’m all you’ve got. Which room is yours?”
“He said he doesn’t need it, but I can’t risk him leaving for food.”
,” Ginny stood and passed a gurgling Victoire across the table. Ron held a protective hand over his food.
The shop matron looked absolutely shocked to see him, but helped him well enough in picking out some sweaters, linen trousers, and even a few gauzy, blazer-cum-cardigan things he could wear around the house. The price made him cringe, but he had twice that in his pockets alone.
Harry hesitated, glancing around. “You all…I mean, it’s not a secret – ?“
“He seems alright.”
“Payment?”
“It’s a lot,” he said, and sighed when Harry only shrugged. “’Mione started an organization that sends House Elves –
“They’re family,” Ron confirmed. The slightly chagrined two words that didn’t need the ‘our’ in between. They were Harry’s family, too.
He bubble fit comfortably inside his robe pocket. Between the snakes compliments and Hermione’s nagging, Hagrid seemed to have forgot there was something wrong with Harry. They were well out of hearing range of the little cabin before Hermione started in.
“Just take a picture of each page past the seventh chapter. If you can’t get it all, do your best. It’s not too enormous of a book.”
“It’s not working,” Draco grunted, ramming his shoulder into Harry’s as he yanked on the curtain. “What –
“You didn’t ask! I’ve been trying to tell – “
Harry only had a moment to take it in before he was being…mauled? No – hugged. Or at least what this person understood as a hug. He jerked Harry up by the shoulder and crushed him between two strong arms.
Harry swallowed, suddenly feeling a little guilty for eating curry without Teddy. He was always going on about missing it. Even so, all he talked about was the restaurant. Had Harry never cooked for him before? “I s’pose I must have been. This place was probably a lot more lively with him in it.”
“September the fourth. 1998,” he read loudly. “I woke up this morning, and I didn’t know where I was. Ron was there. I almost attacked him, because I only saw Voldemort’s face. When will it stop? When will I stop being afraid? When will I be able to sleep through the night?”
“Well…” Fleur nodded her understanding. “Perhaps Molly would like a day off next week. It would be good for Victoire to see her only
The rest of them quieted down, listening. Molly’s gaze burned into the side of his head.

“Gee, thanks,
“What’s this?”
He watched her putter about for a few minutes, clearly set on doing anything except sitting across from him. The avoidance was extremely obvious, and he told her so. With an embarrassed smile, she took a spot across from him. The late afternoon light made her brown eyes gleam amber.
“The war…” Harry touched his fingers to the scar. “Is that where I got this?”
“Reversal of name, reversal of fortune,” she said, glancing at him. “
Harry bit his tongue, thinking that every week of Hermione’s must be long. “Stay there. I’ll put on some tea.”
“Well, that’s a bit insulting,” George said flatly. “You remember the bloody owl’s name and not
Harry shrugged. “That makes sense, doesn’t it? To a certain degree.”
“Animagus?”
“Well, you didn’t look like this yesterday.”

“I – “ She put out a hand. “Enough. I didn’t come here to argue about it. It – it would be best if you went with me to the Department of – “
. And it wasn’t particularly funny, but Harry laughed anyway. Like everyone else, Draco seemed shocked by that. Much more than shocked - astonished.
But Teddy’s hair was purple again and he made a sound of joy at the boy hurrying across the room to meet them. He had a blue and gray striped scarf around his neck, clearly just in from outdoors. Short blonde curls bounced around chubby cheeks and blue eyes.
“You think about me?”
Ron almost choked on his drink. “Talk to
Draco smiled at him. “How wonderfully honest of you.” He tilted the bottle back. Harry watched his pale throat work in a swallow. “I’m afraid it’s not going to get any better.”
“I am trying.” Hermione looked at Harry when he said that. “I just need time.”
“What are you on about?” Ron asked, sounding much the same.
Dr. Mahmoud was a man of few words and much anxiety. When Ron knocked at his office door he jumped to his feet, knocking a thick journal to the floor and nearly spilling his ink on a white patterned outfit that appeared to be the male version of what the receptionist wore. He had a short gray moustache that twitched as he shook their hands, and almost no hair save that which lined the lower circle of his head.
It was rather harsh, Harry thought. But Ron nodded and stepped back, giving him a shrug as he followed the others. And then he was alone with her.
“Oh.” Ginny leaned back, bracing her elbows on the top step. “Sorry to hear that.”
Draco was done stirring when Harry eased back into the parlor, instead fiddling with a wristwatch. “What do you want, Potter?”
“Lost? What’dya mean,
“Alright. Great. Do you have a name?”
He was surprised to hear Draco’s voice, and for a disorienting second did not know if he was awake or not. Then his shoulder throbbed again, and the dregs of the dream slipped away on a tide of reality. Something important had already been forgotten.
– or had trick steps that vanished underfoot. Teddy did his best to tell him about these things just before they happened, but it was rarely quick enough.
So that was why. Or maybe Molly had just hit upon a pressure point that night.
Ginny looked back at him for a moment, on the verge of saying something. He knew she didn’t have an answer – at least not one she would ever say aloud. It was in her eyes the same way it was in Hermione’s.
“Not bloody likely,” Lee said, following him. “What about those sugarplum doxies from a few weeks ago? Think they’ve calmed down yet?”
“Then enjoy your ignorance!” She wrenched her arm away. “I really do mean that, Harry. I fucking
Without a word, he held out his left arm and pulled up his sleeve. Harry tensed, unsure of what was happening until the edges of a tattoo appeared. So
“It’s a pain in the arse. Pick up the wrong book and have your eyebrows singed off. Gallahey almost got us kicked out for throwing one against the wall. It called her mum a cu – uh. A rude word.”
She turned on the top step, laughing at his expression. “I’m joking, Harry. You know…” the laughter fell away, remaining only in her eyes. “We broke up a
“Thank you, Hermione,” Harry said. His shoulder was really starting to throb. “Without you, I would never know to take any precaution at all. I might just invite Dolohov for tea and let him use my wand to stir the sugar.”
He frowned at it, taking a drink of water instead. “I’m an alcoholic, aren’t I?”
“Don’t make any sound in the front hall,” Harry warned.
Teddy was giving him the sort of look Hermione often did – that he was acting completely out of character but it was sort of all right. Reena left her book behind and walked over.
“I’ve no clue.” He looked at the cat. It blinked at him and abruptly ran out of the room, disappearing through a cracked door.
“That doesn’t work!” He shouted over his shoulder, gripping the curtains.
He fished it out and opened it, glancing over the first page to get a feel for if it was important or not.
“Thought I’d come hang out for a bit before we Floo to Mum’s for dinner. You look spiffy.”
Well, that was that. Harry didn't know what he expected. He sighed and changed the subject. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you."
She smiled weakly, the television reflecting in her eyes. “Why
Then it was gone. Draco flicked his wrist and flung it into the cauldron. Despite the thick viscosity of the pure black potion, it sank right under. Draco clicked the watch off and spun it.
” he answered without hesitation. Harry blinked, and then laughed, which made him blush. “And a Bordeaux, if they have it.”
“Not quite, at least, not that I can discern. Accounts from the time mention increased physical strength and the ability to heal quickly. There was one transcript from a witch burning in Flanders, eleventh century - the wizard appeared dead, but woke within a fortnight and escaped.”
“You mean you’re putting these in those care packages?” Harry leaned to see what he was writing. George smacked his notebook shut. “What other ‘specialties’ have you cooked up?”
“Draco’s a good listener, as well.”
He turned to let his bare feet sit on the cold floor, not quite ready to stand. Falling over seemed like quite the possibility. “How long have I been here?”
master
Halfway through it, he heard the tell-tale rustle of Floo flames, and then there was a hoarse cry. He suspended the magic and rushed to the front room. “Ron?”
“Sure.”
…boomslang ancestry.”
“A curse scar,” Ron said sympathetically. “Sorry, mate.”
“Luna around?”
“Okay.”
“Yes,” Draco said automatically. Ron made an angry sound, and he held up a hand. “Wait – it’s the potion – I didn’t
“I asked you a question.”
“I’M. RIGHT. HERE.” He bellowed. “And I’m
“Right.” He pulled the new sweater on, feeling naked without his robes. “Let’s go.”

“Yes. They were. In second year he called me a mudblood right to my face. Neither of us had any idea what it meant, but Ron went beserk.”
“So what’s bothering you? It’s not the papers, is it? The last article on you was, what, a week ago?”
“Did you see the moon tonight?” Draco asked.
Victoire. Good! Yeah, she talked with him after I left Saturday.”
Ron looked all around, distracted. “Hm? Oh, yeah. She’ll meet us there. Where’s your Floo powder gone?”
It was cold. Too cold. Bit at his face, his feet. Gnawed at his stomach. “Inside…house…”
“A week,” he answered, with a different intonation. Like he thought Harry should already have known that. He raised the mug to his mouth. “Wasted time.”
There were more candles lit throughout the twisting labyrinth, as well as chairs and short tables. The candle stopped over one about four turns from the start, in front of a shelf lined with thick, sad-looking books.
“Because I’m shite at it.”
She turned to the fireplace, pulling her hair back and setting her shoulders. “I was thinking of connecting this to the Floo.”
a person. Not a fairy apparition.
Harry wasn’t sure if that choice of words was meant to be an insult. Was he poking fun at Harry for passing off his responsibilities to Ron? “Safety in numbers.”
“Oh.”
“So.” Ginny set Victoire on her lap, spooning some potato into her mouth. “I can’t think of a thing to say to you, honestly. Catch any good telly recently?”
“How far?” Harry pulled it on, smelling the remains of expensive cologne. The fabric was impossibly light, draping like gossamer and not trapping his heat.
Castor pointed out, flicking a tongue against Harry’s cheek.
“I appreciate it, though. It’s sweet.” Her head touched on his shoulder for a moment. “You always went at each other in school. It was plenty deserved, don’t get me wrong, but I think he was just now rather shocked at what you suggested.”
Harry shrugged. “There are other ways to change your appearance. Without magic, even.”
, Gee. Sprout would have your head.”
“Hmm?”
Harry leaned forward on his elbows, watching him. “This is really difficult for you.”
“She’s also your emergency contact,” Hannah supplied. “We’ll be releasing you into her care. Are you alright with that, Harry?”
Then she leaned in and kissed his forehead. It drew him up short, both the words and the…
“Care-
“You’re forgetting one
“Why?” Harry asked patiently. Draco swallowed, the tendons in his neck standing out with effort.
. Because I’m so incredibly empathetic.”
“Well, Mr. Finnigan.”
He nodded, hiding his uncertainty as he stepped off. She still had a smile plastered over her face, but just before the doors shut it dropped away. For a brief second, she looked distraught.
He ran his hand over the scruff on his chin. “I took a trimming spell to it. Does it…is it – ?”
The tea was good, at least. Finally, he had proper bagged tea that didn’t flood between his lips like grass. He’d gone for groceries late Thursday after a visit to Gringotts to sort out muggle-money conversions with Fleur. She’d tried explaining how it worked, but he found pretty quickly he already knew.
When it was clear he wasn’t about to be reprimanded for running off, his smile returned. Harry let him step away, still blushing. “Sorry – this is Reena!”
What stood out even more than his eyes was the strange, jagged scar across his forehead. It started at his hair line and zagged down to his eyebrow. A scar, not a disfigurement. Was
“Teddy’s grandfather,” Harry murmured, shocked again. He reached out, feeling along the blasted, torn wallpaper. The house was fixing itself, yet these remained. “I didn’t know you were related. I didn’t know he had any family left.”
“Do something!” Ron said. Harry balked.
George did seem to be focusing more on Ginny, much to her annoyance.
Ron looked away, blowing out a breath.
Dread almost overpowered the pain as he drew closer to the building. The moon was out again, enough for him to see the glint of it off dark, empty windows. Thick brush grew along and up the sides of what looked to be a manor. The brick, even in night, was discolored. Aged. Filthy.
“You always said the ones from Honeydukes were the best.”
“I understand.” Harry chewed the inside of his cheek, hesitating. It was silly to feel like he was overstepping, right? He was their boss until recently. “Only I woke up totally alone, maybe a half a mile from the house. It’s only chance I found it at all.”
“Yes, yes, he did mention this to me.” She waved her wand, saying something in smooth French that had a file detaching itself from a cabinet and floating into Harry’s hands. “Zis is your information.”
Draco sighed again, fixing his eyes on the middle distance. “The International Statute of Secrecy,” he began. “Ratified in 1689, three hundred years after the Persecution began. I won’t bore you with basic History of Magic tripe – you all know it was long before even the trials that magic users were being sought out by the Church. If they weren’t paid to prophesize or heal, they were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered.”
“Hey,” Teddy said. She looked up and grinned. But a few other kids looked up, too. Harry was promptly surrounded and bombarded with questions.
“Smashing.” Neville tightened the collar of his robes, pulling his large silver earmuffs into place. “The Swedish Bubotubers just came into season. The students’ll go mad for ‘em… And the Starthistles are just starting to hibernate for the winter, so I can start to extract the nectar for shipment to St. Mungo’s.”
” Ginny leaned forward, rocked back, then hopped to her feet. “Show me.”
“We all have one. She shoves her camera in our faces every time she visits.”
turned against me, the very first time we met. Me! When
Ron observed him for a short minute. He was different, here, in action. The long, oftentimes gangly lines of his body were more composed and intimidating. He cleaned up the loose ends of his accent and made slow, deliberate movements.
“The brunt of it?”
There was no handle.
Ron nodded absently, already on the last page. It looked like an expense report. “This is quite a lot.”
The ingredients had been re-organized since Harry was last there, stacked and gathered in piles that formed a circle. All in easy reach for someone who spent all their time crouched over the cauldron on the hard floor.
“And my hair needs to be down?” He asked pointedly. Ron blinked and stepped back.
“Just a bit of Spatial Switching,” she comforted. “You hung onto each other, didn’t you? That always makes it worse.”
“You’ll let Hermione take over the potion,” he said. Mindless words, really, to fill the silence and keep Draco from passing out again.
Hermione smiled weakly, pushing her hair back. “Well, we’re Flooing out. So. See you tomorrow?”
“You think he’ll resent you for it?”
“What do
He turned the page, to a different entry. “Every day is the longest day of my life. Don’t know how to make it through anymore.” He looked up scathingly. “Well, I was no poet.”
“Wonderful. Did you see the gardenias? Not easy keeping those healthy with all this rain.”
“Where is it we’re going?”
“Er, I suppose? Like I said, I don’t know if you’ve been there or not. Maybe you used it for storage or something.”
“You managed to repair it with the Elder Wand.”
“We called you here today because… Because you might be able to help.”
Carefully, he picked it up and watched the memory undulate slowly inside. What was it? What kind of magic brought memories out through tears?
“I know what Shacklebolt said.” That sounded like Ron. “So we can’t veritaserum. We
That brought him to a halt. Draco dropped the bone and pushed the container away, eyes wide. “Did
“Who was that?” Harry asked quietly, knowing the answer.
Draco. And if Ron was Harry’s friend, did that mean he was meant to hate him, too?
“But – “ Seamus started. Draco was already speaking over him.
Harry looked at Hermione, dead grass and leaves crunching under their feet. “He’s the gamekeeper.”
Something in his eyes – though it was very subtle – tipped Harry off. Draco was
“This is disgusting,” he pointed out, just in case Draco needed to hear it. “No wonder she wanted me to bring it.”
“Why do you think she wants it?”
“The pain is dulled,” he said, ignoring Harry’s nervous silence. He raised his finger, showing off a faint red circle with a clear sting mark.
“That’s fantastic, Harry! You’ll have an amazing time. Box seats, as well. No press allowed.”
editions when they were convinced you had a fling going with Fleur.”
“Dear Great Aunt Walburga,” Draco continued, rather forcefully. “Would have surely burned my mother’s name off by now. Things as they are, this house considers me the true heir to the property.”
That stopped him short. Then he shrugged. “Honestly? A bit.”
Ron laughed. “No.”
Teddy’s gasp was loud in the quiet room. “
“They’re magnificent.” Draco snapped his fingers, and the doors shut. He glanced around in a nervous way. Harry should have already made for the stairs, probably, but this odd exchange had captured his attention. “Where’s my mother?”
He frowned, thinking it over. “Anxious, I suppose. Worried I’ll… mess up, somehow.”
No sooner had the words left his mouth than the snake dropped to the floor with a heavy
“Ron.”
“I hate the Floo.” He looked down at George’s purple-flannel sweatpants. “Besides, I wanted some fresh air.”

“I don’t…” Harry felt his face heat up, even though Hermione looked highly amused. “Ron’s rather rude, but Hermione’s only trying to help. I don’t see why you dislike her so much unless it’s something to do with – “

“I promise.” He read the little page of instructions. It was round and ridged all over for a snake to curl up on it. When he tapped his wand and muttered the incantation, it grew to the right size and emitted a faint heat. He put it between the fireplace and a chair.
Harry glanced over his shoulder. Ron was feeling at his now bare chin with relief, trying to find his actual wand.
“You wouldn’t say,” he shrugged. “Got really cagey about it, actually. Maybe you ended things already?”
“Doesn’t look like Hagrid’s home,” Reena sighed, pointing to the little hut near the trees. They walked to the pitch instead. Teddy told him the figures darting around were the Hufflepuff team practicing, and spent a while lamenting on the first-year Quidditch ban.
She blinked at Ron’s voice, giving Harry a very unhappy look.
It wasn’t for work. It wasn’t a clipping from the
“Language!” And the second time he’d been called brain-damaged that week. Perhaps he should worry.
“It isn’t?”
Ron shrugged, handing the memo back over. “He got off easy if you ask me. You could’ve done a lot worse.”
“Me too,” he said brightly. “When will you be back?”
“I can’t feel my face,” he noticed aloud. “The Warming Charm wore off already.”
“How are you, Carys?” Draco asked, shockingly warm all of a sudden. Carys smiled at him, bouncing on their heels.
“Yeah? What do you know? You don’t even remember your own mum’s name – “
Harry hummed, shrugging his coat on before they braved the night.
,” he slapped the memo down onto Draco’s project outline. “Tells us that if any Death Eater dies before he’s finished, it throws everything off and the potion won’t work.”
“Safety. For whom?”
George gestured with his quill for them to continue.
The room had gone quiet, save for Debra’s quill scratches – though even those were getting slower. Ron had an openly bored expression, but he was listening as intently as the rest of them. The posh accent was quite good for storytelling, Harry had to admit.
“Okay. Good.”
“It’s very important,” Hermione pressed, unnecessarily. “I would do it myself – “
It hopped a few steps inside, holding out its leg imperiously. Harry gently unwound the string attached to the note, flinching out of the way as the owl took rightly off, flying straight through his open bedroom door and further into the house.
“Why?” He challenged. “It’s a
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco set the bottle aside, rubbing his eyes. “You’re serious.”
He cracked his knuckles, feeling a bit more like himself. Whoever that was. “Something tells me I’ve done it before.”
Draco wouldn’t just show up. Hermione had fixed the Floo, so now Harry could safely use it to go places. But the only exit from Grimmauld was still here, and Draco knew that. It must be some kind of emergency.
, mate. Your parents…they died in the first war.”
“Funny.”
“…No. I dunno.” Ron sighed and rolled his eyes. “I’m not stupid enough to ask him up front. Best let Hermione work it out.”
“Fine,” Ron said tersely. “We’ll expect you back here on Monday, flat or no. Prepare your…
Harry snorted. “So you’re freezing and you can’t feel pain.
Stunned, Harry looked down at his tea. The swills had risen to the surface, spelling out very clearly exactly what George had just said.
When he returned, she had the blanket wrapped around her, almost comically heavy-lidded. “I didn’t mean to doze off. Ron should have woken me on his way out.”
out of this, whatever Ron thinks. In fact you usually cover for me.”
“Ron.” Harry looked away from the wedding photo. “Am I a total dick?”
Ron raised a hand. “Hullo, Madame Rosmerta.”
“I asked you to get me a snake?”
“Oh, Harry!” She cried, throwing herself around his middle. Her head came up to his shoulder. “How dare you keep an old woman in suspense like this!”
“I need to answer this. If you’re busy preparing for Malfoy – “
Harry shut the shower off. “Ron?”

Ron turned to stare at her. “Yeah. Fine," he relented. "It is a good idea. He didn’t seem too keen on it, though.”
“If you’d had a normal life,” Bill smiled. “You’d be like this all the time. Life of the party.”
Hermione had been to Grimmauld Place twice. He didn’t know what they did over there, but the curiosity was killing him. Draco wanted nothing to do with him, though, so he tried to forget it.
“No.” She stared at the floor, then back up, setting her shoulders. “I need to talk to
The person he’d been staying with. Harry wondered if he had a more permanent residence somewhere, or if he just hopped from safehouse to safehouse. There was always the family’s estate Harry had heard about.
out of character, like Ron made it seem.
“Oh.” Harry faltered. He was an Auror. It felt strange to think it. “Why are you keeping him, then?”
Harry almost wasn’t prepared for such a long answer, even though it really wasn’t that much. Draco had been talkative these past twenty-four hours. “Cursebreaking must be a lonely job.”
Harry looked at Draco, at the long lines of his arms and the turn of his nose and the circles beneath his eyes. He looked at this borderline stranger and could suddenly put it to words. The sleepless nights. The curiosity. He wanted Draco. Quite badly. It was such a strong certainty Harry could only assume it had always been there, regardless of their animosity.
Debra snorted into her beer. Élise gave her a disapproving look. “What? It was funny!”
“What are you telling it?” Draco asked suspiciously, creeping out of the kitchen.
Ron looked very put off by this. “I think I prefer you. Even like this. My brothers have other things to worry about.”
Harry looked around, which was fruitless. He could only see in firelit streaks and hazy blurs. The sound was centered somewhere to his left, but all he felt was pillows.
“Can you start by then?”
“Lifts. Now.”
“Ministry officials trained to investigate and apprehend Dark wizards.” The words sprang forth without too much thought. He just
“Nothing,” he said. “Just – I think they must be having a party in the common room right now. They were decorating this morning.”
“Really?” They were in the shop proper, now. Squeals of delight emanated from the floor below, followed by mechanical laughter and pinball dings. “Are you sure?”
“And what?”
“If you could all keep your voices down, I’m sure Harry would appreciate it.”
“…No?” Just a vague disorientation.
“Ready?” He threw a pinch into the flames. “Just say
“I’ve connected it to your house. I hope that’s okay.” Her hair tufted around her ears as she sat up, one streak of soot across her nose.
He settled into his bed with a sigh of contentment. The duvet was soft and warm over his bare skin, but the urge to sleep had completely gone. They were going to Hogwarts in the morning – not too early, judging by Ron’s state. Harry was excited. And apprehensive. And bloody terrified.
“Wait up!” Came a faint voice. Ron jogged over from the house and grabbed a broom for himself.
“Of course,” Hermione murmured.
“Did she?”
“Harry, dear, sit. You must be hungry.” With incongruous strength, she pushed him down into a chair.
“How long will that take?”
“Teddy,” he repeated. “He said I wasn’t that different.”
school. It was always the Weasley’s house, and it was always the holidays. Until the papers were dated 1996, and the pictures were at another house, instead.
Harry opened his mouth to ask about that, but the memo that had just fluttered past them had turned in its path, instead stopping over Ron’s head and gently falling. He caught it, eyes going wide.
George made a funny face. “What.”
Harry moved closer, drawn in by the softness of Draco’s voice and captivated by his expression. Somber and contemplative. Torchlit, he looked quite Byronic.

Best Auror. Not best boss. Not even
“Yeah!” Lee said, when Harry asked. “I’ll be on the wand with Jackie Phillipson. Think you’ll come? Ginny probably got you box seats.”
Ron looked shocked, like even he couldn’t believe what he’d said.
The nostrils flared again. “I have to read the

“I’ll get us a booth,” Neville said. As they walked off he tried giving Luna his outer robe again. She refused.
The sink was lined with hair product, toothpaste, face wash, and other miscellanea. He picked up a stray elastic and used it to tie his hair back.
requests compensation from one Harry Potter to the order of fifteen galleons, regarding the destruction of a magical press camera on the first of September, year two-thousand-and-nine. Signed Wermley Wilson... Huh.”
“How?”
“Great, actually.”
“This way,” Minerva said. He started walking automatically, hurrying to keep up.
They and Teddy all leaned over the wood beam, only to fall back as seven figures shot up past the box and into the air in a line formation.
She appeared to think carefully. “You’ve befriended him.”
George leaned forward on an elbow. “Well, don’t
“No.”
Ron sighed. “It’s so
Ron tripped coming back out, catching himself on the doorway with a muttered curse. “D’you mean it? That might actually be…easier. If you’re not there, I’ll take the brunt.”
George gasped. “Divorce?”
“Ginny.” She squeezed his arm.
, because he wasn’t entirely sure what he would be going back to.
what the Mark was. He didn’t know what he expected, but it wasn’t all that evil-looking.
A lot of blood. Too much to waste any more time. Harry pulled the Cloak over his head and dragged Draco’s limp body off the ground, Apparating them both away.
She leaned in closer, setting a hand on his cheek. The soft gesture didn’t match the way her eyes moved over him, like she was the scientist and he the specimen.
“Not terribly long ago, you made it seem like…like you were seeing someone.”
“SORRY, HEADMISTRESS. IT WAS A LOW BLOW, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT – “ The referee touched down next to the fight, gesturing with his wand. Everything up top was still in full force. Slytherin scored while the Keeper was distracted, and the red side of the stands was screaming for a time-out. “IT IS UNCLEAR, I REPEAT UNCLEAR WHETHER THE REFEREE WILL CALL A FOUL – “
“It’s not.” Draco spoke quickly, almost defensively. “It’s the opposite of a Horcrux. You don’t have to – “ his eyes flicked around the room once. “You don’t have to kill anything, for a start. It’s the same branch of magic, but much older.”
Élise perched her chin on her hand, squinting at the board. “I think I’ll go see about Quidditch security. Does that say…missing
“Yeah…I dunno. I think George is starting to rely on me to be his guinea pig while – “ He bit his tongue. He’d been about to say
“What does Teddy need with love potions?”
Harry nodded, starting in on an abridged version of his day.
“What’s that got to do with…” Harry cast it aside. Hermione probably did have a hand in the Accounting work. Why not. “What are they rowing about?”
. Care package. Right.
He finished the first page, and then the second.
“It’s so freaky to hear you do that.”

“Explain,” Ron demanded.

“Why not? You were
She didn’t ask for an explanation, glancing around the floor to make certain before taking a seat in the armchair and crossing her legs. “I need you to take that bag to Draco.”

him. The word ‘kill’ was rarely attributed to what he’d done.
Harry said his name twice more before Draco’s eyes cracked open. A fresh volley of tears followed the action, falling hot against Harry’s hand.
“What if there was something you really didn’t know about me? Something I could never seem to tell you for some reason? Because I was too sad and alone and scared.”
Harry swiveled on his heels. Draco stood in the doorway, and Harry was further unsettled because he, too, looked different. Instead of the dark draping robes, he wore plain trousers and a large mocha jumper, shoddy yet obviously expensive. His white-blonde hair was only sort-of pushed back, some of it falling over his forehead.

He left his letter on a corner of the table, plenty of blank space at the bottom to directly answer whatever Teddy said in his next correspondence. An owl flew into his window almost the moment he thought it, making him jump. It wasn’t Todrick.

“Broomstick,” Harry finished. He’d seen something similar last week at the Burrow, on the semi-freshly painted garden fence. Arthur told him Teddy had skidded into it his first time on a broom that spring.
“Don’t look so offended, babe,” George scolded, winking. “May as well keep it in the family, eh?”
“Yes,” his voice whispered out of thin air. “I have
Ron made a frustrated noise, turning back to the window. “There’s no way he could know. You and Harry are always going at each other. What’s different?”
something to it.
“It’s your house, now. Sirius left it to you. I don’t remember the last time you actually went over there – after Kreacher passed away, you and Hermione warded it to bollocks and that’s pretty much been that.”
When they’d all had their fill, Réne and Reena broke away and let the three of them start their long walk back across the castle.
She giggled. “Yes. Goodbye, ‘arry.”
“And thinking.” Another slow sip, her eyes far off. Sixty hours shuffling through the presumably dark, dank halls of the Department of Mysteries, with that heavy
Victoire cried happily.
Draco’s mouth tightened. “What can I do?”
“You were having a nightmare.”
“I’m fine,” he said. “Well, erm – I think I am.”
“No,” Hermione said firmly. “No. They’re just trying to get the story straight.”
“Tell me how it goes, won’t you?”
“I don’t like it,” he finally answered. Ron looked away from him. “I suppose that’s not the first time I’ve said that to you.”

Harry shrugged it off, even though he had a point. “Fuck the papers.

George checked his watch. “I’ve gotta go open the store. Just.” He closed his eyes for a second. “
“Yeah. Judging your expression, they haven’t come calling.”

The concrete wound in an arc, swooping left and ending with a wide turnabout that housed a massive stone fountain just in front of the doors.
Once they were past a small pile of stacked rocks, he saw the cabin. It was small against the looming forest, built out of brick and wood and a good deal of luck – the angles weren’t at all sturdy but it was clearly old. Smoke rolled out of the chimney, promising warmth.
“Yes.” Harry looked at the empty tubs. “You have.”
He stopped talking, going very still. Headrush, probably. Or nausea. Then, “
“Don’t forget the Seeker,” Hermione said with a wink to Harry.
“Nothing like that. I
“Leftover from where?”
His eyebrows rose. “You owe me?”
Ginny explained in the attached letter.
“He won’t bite,” Harry promised. “I’ve told him not to.”
The next time she shifted the papers, she glanced over. Her eyes went wide when she saw he was awake. The papers slid off her lap and into the floor with a great rustling.
Ron found him on the floor, surrounded by photo albums. As there were only three, this probably wasn’t the deep dive Harry had felt it was. But he’d spend the better part of an hour on the rug, flipping through his past.
“Seriously. What sort of magic is it? New, I expect. You know, I was toying with the idea of Temporary Tattoo Marks – “
“The Pensieve
“Hagrid,” Harry guessed. George said he was a half giant. It was still difficult to understand the full scale of his size. Air flooded into his lungs as he was released, stumbling back so Ron could fall victim to the next hug.
“We’ll carry on tomorrow, yeah?” He said quietly. She nodded.
Harry raised a questioning eyebrow. Madame Rashida gave disapproving looks to their disheveled, slightly sweaty appearances.
As Harry walked back down Diagon Alley, he almost thought he’d get back home without incident. Toward the brick wall that would take him back to the Leaky Cauldron, a bright flash of light forced his attention to an older woman in chartreuse robes. The second his eyes landed on her, she ducked through a door.
“Harry could get an owl in Diagon Alley,” Hermione started to argue. A high-pitched yapping interrupted her. From the depths of the trees, a white and brown ball of hair bounded toward them, hopping easily over a pile of timber near the little garden in the shadow of the cabin.
Harry could barely even smell the tar anymore. His nostrils did burn a bit. And his fingertips were still numb, even as he huffed his breath on to them. “What about you.”
“Yes, but not through theft. I offer all of my work to any student affiliated with a university – even a Hogwarts student, several years back. The man I worked on this with has his own copies, which he also distributes.”
The man moved like he was going to push Potter’s grip away, but he didn’t.
“What would they want with some old construction magic?” Harry asked.
“Hermione’s not
That made her smile, for some reason.
“Oh, look. This page is only a list of names. Do you know any of them? Lupin, Tonks, Fred, Sirius, Colin, Lavender – “
“What I’m saying is…he
“Hey,” Ron hacked, kicking his shoes off. “Luna just owled me.”
“Charlie,” the short one said. The bespectacled one was Percy, Ron’s father was Arthur, the tall one and woman were Bill and Fleur. Harry did his best to commit each name to memory.

“Is that a Weasley I see?”
Leaves rustled beside and above them. Some blew right off their branches in the sudden gust, swirling wildly in the crisp air. They were in Scotland, but he hadn’t expected it to be
“Night!” He called. Ron called back the same, and Harry took off down the lane, until even the orange pumpkin lights were gone.
“I won’t,” Teddy groaned, exasperated. He knocked his knee against Harry’s. “What is it?”
George hadn’t made it to dinner this week, possibly busy with damage control with Minerva. Bill and Fleur were also absent, him away on business and her visiting family in France.
“Yes,” Draco said, leaning forward with one fist on the table. “I regret it.”
Cloak, he kept calling it. Harry only understood it very little, but he was sympathetic to the fact that it could really be considered something like a holy grail to people raised on those wizarding stories. Ron and Hermione talked about it like a useful tool.
“And then...then I’ll have to get Smets and Gallahey to follow up with Catastrophes.” Ron sat at Harry’s kitchen table, head in his hands, while Harry made curry. “Then...Dean’ll still be on the hunt for that cauldron smuggler...so any new assignments will fall to Seamus and me…”
“Not now, no, but before?” Draco moved his arms again, holding an elbow in one hand and splaying the other out in the air as he talked. “I’ll agree it’s unlikely. The Dark Lord wouldn’t have taken kindly to us prying about the Mark and its magic. But just because they never spoke about it around me doesn’t mean they didn’t have an idea. Dolohov was there at the beginning.”

“I wouldn’t worry too much.” He fisted his hands, then shoved the door open. “C’mon.”
Her red lips parted in a teasing smile. “From Twilfit’s?”

Can you understand that? You don’t know what you want, and…and neither do I. Not anymore. So you need to come back.”
“Harry,” Hermione said gently. “Harry, it’s not all bad. We’ll try to recover your memories. It’s…entirely possible your amnesia will wear off on its own.”
“I…” she blinked a few more times, closing the book. “Of course I should be up. The time?”

Her head shot up from where she’d already looked down at her stack of papers. “Pardon?”
Ron said, loudly enough for the room to go quiet. “Actually, he’s not all right.”

“She’s the Seeker for the
She took a startled step back when he drew his wand, which he felt distantly guilty about. Maybe his tone wasn’t as controlled as he thought it was.

He gave Harry a weird look, then shook his head. “Dolohov is the one who did this to you…we think. He escaped, after the war. Another Death Eater. We’ve been tracking him for months, and we finally found him in one of their old safehouses. I lost you for a second, a

The two doors were equal in every way except for a tattered, tarnished copper sign on the left one:
the one who saved you. Let’s make that clear.”
Her tears drew no sympathy from him. “No, I can’t.”
“I can see Hermione’s upset about it. And Ron.”
rising and falling in pitch.
“Got it,” Harry sighed. It was hard to stop himself asking questions that he already should know the answers to.
in here.”
“Yeah,” Harry said.
“Sounds about right.” Harry smiled to himself. George was clever for that one – it was a lie reckless enough for Hermione to believe and probably agonize over.
“Yes!” Harry called back, unable to believe it. This was the most fun he’d had – well, it was impossible to know, but this might be the most fun he’d had in his
Élise rolled her eyes. “I went to Beauxbatons, but you lot talk about Hogwarts constantly.”
“She’s rather nice. Without being nice, that is.”
All eyes turned to Harry. Ginny stopped eating. He did his best not to sink straight into the floor.
“Page
“Now, what in the blazes is goin’ on, here?” Hagrid asked, eyes narrowed. “You forgot you were a Parselmouth?”
Groggily, he found his glasses and went to the window, looking blearily out at late morning spreading without haste through the neighborhood. A small brown owl looked back, pecking pointedly on the glass.
“But you’re right. I no longer have the capacity or the inclination to hate the undeserving,” Draco said somewhat lightly. “It’s been quite the life change. And if we are being honest right now…I never hated you. Not truly. I spent most of my life in the same position you are now – I only knew the idea of Harry Potter. What others told me, and what I saw when we were in school together.”
The scaly muscle around his neck tightened slightly as a knock sounded on the front door. Harry sat up, the end of the snake’s tail curling around his bicep for balance. “Who is it?”
He’d dated Ron’s sister Ginny in school, he found out. Ron found a photo of her on the mantle, and Harry was shocked to recognize the woman from Teddy’s poster.
"And the item? What could that be?"
Harry was sure Ron had pulled the curtains open during their visit, but they were shut now, fluttering ominously without a breeze.
“I know. I
“I do know,” she beseeched, hands still raised as though to defend, glancing back and forth between him and the staircase, where his wand was still pointed. “I know better than anyone, Harry. And I know – “
Which was where he was crouched when he saw something wedged beneath. Not a scrap at all. It was a journal of sorts. Brown dragon leather.
about old Moldy himself.
“Well, you’ll have to come back this way, no?” She let herself in with a dismissive wave. “I’ve just got a barrel of Beetle Berry – aged forty years!”
over and over, watching the shadows burst against the faint white light.
from the other room, then the flapping of wings. The owl landed right on top of the box, clutching his claws over the string. It was just over half his size, but he looked confident enough. Harry tied the letter to his leg and leaned to push up the window.
,” Ron said, heavily sarcastic. Harry raised his eyebrows.
After the second pint, their already stilted conversation turned flat.
“She laughed in my face when I offered to babysit.” George strode off to the kitchen, tearing his orange robes off and tossing them onto the couch. “But the brain-damaged, not-even-blood-relative bugger is her first choice. Fantastic. I need your tea.”
“We aren’t married,” she said quickly, then strode out.
“I have a lot of responsibility. You understand that.” The way she said that clearly referred to the
“Hey?” Ron said, catching onto his silence.
“Here and there.” Harry told him about the antivenom. And the breakfast.
Before, the air had smelled like dust and mildew. The potion was a bit rancid but Harry now could also smell something like citrus and freshly-cut grass. Every surface seemed too bright, and after a moment of looking at the piano he realized that the dust had gone completely. The wallpaper was less patchy, the curtains no longer had holes and stains… It was less an artifact room and more of a living space. Some of the chill seemed banished from the shadow.
Harry glanced over his shoulder. Draco stood against the far wall, arms crossed, chin askew like all of this was far beneath him. He hadn’t had any trouble Flooing to Harry’s, though certainly his house had wards up that would notice a Dark Mark.
