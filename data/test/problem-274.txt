He walked out without another word hoping his mother would have something to distract him when he got home so he wouldn't lash out. When he got home she did have something so he avoided it till he went to bed.
“Lovely Idea Harry’ James brightened. Regulus raised an unimpressed eyebrow ‘Reggie… please… you’ll get to see Narcissa.”
I hoped that someday the war would end and The Dark Lord would lose. I thought I could just wait it out. Then I found out about the locket. Voldemort meant for his war to last more than one lifetime. I figured I might as well die trying to make him mortal once more.”
Harry slowly kissed Draco and waited till Draco started to kiss back then kissed him again. His slightly chapped lips against Draco smooth ones. Draco held him by the hips then started to lightly push Harry back to the bed till Harry hit his knees and fell back in to the bed never breaking the kiss and bringing Draco with him, who pulled his knees up to straddle Harry's things moving his hands up to Harry's shoulders while Harry moved his hands to run them across Dracos thighs.
Kreacher brings the 1st people back with Sirius and Regulus.
Draco lands in front of Voldemort and then Regulus lands next to him.
There was an old Death eaters Headquarters near there, Dark magic is probably still lingering
“No. The ministry unfroze our vaults. Father’s is the only one they took as restitution.”
“Hello there” He said softly but the boy still jumped and looked up with wild eyes. “Are you okay?”
“Please, you went to Draco’s via fire call. And if it happens to help you to then it does. Sirius won't even be there.”
“Alright Draco you may call me just Nydia. Draco, why do you think the ministry sent you to me as a condition of your release?”
It's pretty known that Harry is not exactly patient. It had been a week since Valentine's day. A week since that stupid prophet article. He was losing his mind. Draco still did everything they normally did with each other but he was blocked off. Half the time he was bluntly wearing his Pureblood mask. He said all the right things without any of the feeling. He didn't want to go to his parents. He would have to explain every other time the prophet got involved in his love life and he just wanted people who already knew and understood. So he went to Ron and Hermione. His best friends.
“Merlin. You're so smart.’ Harry leaned up to kiss him smiling. ‘How’s your box going?”
“The Battle of Hogwarts was the end of two wars. The First and Second Wizarding Wars. Everyone that sacrificed their lives for these wars still died. Some of them were returned to us but not all.” She started.
---------
“Yes”
“That seems fair. It won't hurt to remove one vault. Anything else?”
When they got to Azkaban they were swarmed by guards asking for their wands and brooms and any other magical items. After they did they walked to a small office with a ministry worker behind the desk.
“Yeah. yeah I'm alright. Thanks Harry.”
You could help them, then when you're not helping them you could be home with Narcissa and Draco. I can get them to approve it. Hermiones already been telling them to find someone in here to help them.”
“Sit down.” Draco and Hermione said at the same time.
Harry’s still nice three years later. Ron’s alright. His other roommates pretty much leave him alone. The whole school does. He’s alright with that. He may not have any friends but he has his elves at home. They’re his family, they’re enough. He understands now why he can’t bring Dobby to hogwarts. Why most people would think him weird, if they knew of his family of elves. He thinks Harry wouldn't mind, albeit a bit shocked.
Most voice their plans to go fight those not in the order leave the classroom quickly to join the others.
Neville came by with his parents to dinner one night. Alice took Hermione away for a bit, she heard from Neville that the young girl was another one of Bellatrix’s victims. Percy was the one to ask the weird question, quietly to neville.
"It's just the polite thing to do when meeting new people."
"Okay, is this all of you? Yes good. Considering what you all have been through during your time at Hogwarts we have decided that it would be most  beneficial for you all to be in your own house. You are now all a part of the 5th house of hogwarts and will be staying on the right side of the third floor. "
Shock showed on Voldemort's face for a moment before it was gone. Voldemort said “I can attend to Draco Malfoy.”
“Oh lovely. Bet Sirius likes me even better now.”
“Um...Yes sir...so youre not sending me to azkaban?”
Lily kneels down next to them and gently turns Draco’s face to her. “Why do you think people would hurt them?” She asks gently.
“Potter. Thank you for helping my mother” Draco was barely looking at him. His eyes scattering around.
---------
All around them battle breaks out. Everyone eventually makes it back into the great Hall, the light side is being pushed back by the death eaters while they all fight.
“I know my cousin Draco.’ Regulus tells him gently. ‘What is happening? Where is she?”
“Thanks Professor.” Harry smiled.
He stalled slightly going back to the dorms after dinner. He was scared that Harry didn't mean it, that he regretted it, that He himself would screw it up. He didn't exactly have healthy relationship role models. When he did come in Harry was sitting on his trunk at the end of the bed. His head shot up when Draco let the door shut.
“I said. What kind of pancakes, you morning monsters?”
“Not as dark as it was, but there are a few spots better to avoid. I don't think you’ll have to go near those.”
Frank and Alice Longbottom had been enjoying life since they returned. They both had to see a mind-healer frequently. Being insane for 18 years by way of tutore would do that to you. But it wasn't all bad they got to watch their son. He already grew up but he wasn't done growing, and he was just as excited to have them as they were to have him. The last thing they expected was restitution.
Regulus smiled, “I’ll be close Harry. Good luck. Thank you Ellie.”
Malfoy looks highly annoyed and rolls his eyes. “They were exceptionally cruel people. They had twins. One daughter and one son. They had a house elf named Keplion. They once starved the daughter so bad she passed out. Her twin thought she was dead so he buried her alive. Keplion was a slave to the rest of the family but he was her friend.
---------
He comes out of the floo and Teddy, James, Albus, and Lily are playing games in the living room. Ginny comes out of the dining room at the sound of the Floo.
“These friends of yours?” He asked, looking at Draco, Pansy, and Blaise.
He ran. He couldn't talk about the fact that Harry just kissed him. He had a panic attack after he returned to his dorm. He didn't even realize Harry never came in till a house elf popped in the next morning and started to gather Harry’s stuff.
“It’s not that hard to jump to. I went thinking you were there without really checking. Then you had to come and save me. If I just looked you never would have died.”
“Mr. Potter.” She greeted.
Harry showed him the quiz in the magazine he was reading.
Harry said “It wasn't an accident when my mother died protecting me, It wasn't an accident I defeated you in the graveyard, that I didn't defend myself in the forest tonight, that I survived and I'm fighting again.”
“Hey.” Draco greeted him when he walked into their dorm.
Everyone in the great Hall begins to wake as the spell works.
He didn't touch the list again for 2 days. He didn't know what to do with it, he already had opinions on these things didn't he, that's why he had the dark mark. That's why he called Granger Mudblood and Weasley Blood traitor. He knew his opinions and he told her she may not like them so he wrote them in the journal she provided and didn't touch the book for another 2 days.
“Tonks, Congratulations you are officially an Heir of the Black Vaults.”
“Fine we’re going we’re going” Narcissa left downstairs while Harry and Draco threw pajama pants on. Harry ended up giving Draco a piggy back ride downstairs where Harry dropped him on the couch and ate breakfast.
6 years after Hogwarts they had their first child named Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy with Dracos friend Astoria being a surrogate.
“Not in the mood for questioning. Goodbye Potter.”
"Sure Harry, Have fun at the Weasleys."
“Draco, please stay behind.’ Regulus said while the class got ready to leave.
“I want to reinherit Andromeda, and Sirius. I also want to give Nymphadora her share of the Inheritance from the Black Vaults. And start a Standard Personal Inheritance Vault for Theodore. They were all disinherited because they were good people, who believe in the right things.”
The great hall broke out into cheers while Sirius and Remus kissed for the first time in 18 years.
The kids sit silently for a few minutes before Scorpius goes to ask a question. He opens his mouth as there’s a bang on the door. Ginny checks the wards again and they’re lit up red. There’s more banging as she organizes the kids. “To Harrys office NOW! James you first. Wand out.’ James nods and takes his wand out. ‘Lily, you next. Scorpius. Albus. Teddy.’ She sees the look on Teddy's face and assures him ‘I'm not fighting, I'm running right after you bud.”
“Mr. Potter I'm sorry I have to insist on having guards in here for you protection, I will have to stay as-”
“I cant promise you ever will get that boy back mother, but i will try to be as happy as I can be.”
“Yes. He did. I didn't tell him and I didn't hex him. I was very tempted so thanks for that.” He said sarcastically.
Regulus sat down at the table across from Harry. “For 17 years he was told he would Marry a Pureblood woman and produce an heir. Even though Lucius and Narcissa have told him he doesn't have to, knowing you can go against those expectations and doing it are two very different things. Kissing you makes it real, a reality that he might never live up to his parents' previous expectations.”
His mother kisses his head. His father squeezes his shoulder. They both try to smile at him. He watches as they go to the Aurors and disapparate.
Draco sees the crowd fall around Harry, His parents spot him from the other side of the room and rush to him.
“I...Um suppose you may Mr. Potter”
Sirius winked at all of them then he and James started to take them to the dorms.
“Because I wanted to. I like you.” Harry bit his lip.
The adults were settled in Mcgonagall’s large private dining room. Most of the order gathered there to celebrate the day. Teddy came too. He was a nice reminder of the light left in the world.
“Yes no matter what you've been told I always want you to be honest in here even if that means not giving me an answer.”
“Well...
“Yeah. She said her and Father didn't care and just want me to be happy but…”
“Draco?” Greg asked.
Shields expanded and everyone looked around for its caster. Harry pulled off the invisible cloak. Cheers of Harry's alive were stifled at once.
“Potter.’ He nodded ‘And it's just Aberforth.”
“Shhh, Shhhh. I know. I know Draco. I know you've changed. It's okay.” Harry said quickly while soothing Draco's hair to calm the scared boy. “Look Draco , we found who did this. I think they thought it would be fun and they would somehow prove themselves. But the only thing they've proved is that they are worse human beings then you have ever been okay?”
“I could feel him building up to the curse, but that's it.”
“Yeah, of course I do. You met my family. I wanna meet your’s. I also kinda want my family to meet your family but we don't have to do that now if you don't want.”
“Gentleman, Welcome to Azkaban. Mr. Potter I weren't aware that you were to see anyone or that you would bring Mr. Malfoy here, I heard he and his mother we’re reformed.” Said the worker with a slight smile.
Harry was sure that he and Draco wouldn't be able to write for a week. Ginny sure had her strength for a Quidditch player recovering from a Major Injury. Even with wizarding medicine having a leg crushed that badly took some rehab. Luckily for Harry and Draco she was willing to be pregnant for half of that rehab.
Harry quickly lost his appetite. Hermione knowing he wouldn't want the attention on him struck up a random conversation. Dinner moved on while Harry sat quietly. Dinner became a light thing with a dark spot. Instead of a dark thing with a light spot.
“Next time you should put shields around you guys so you don't get hurt. But I'm glad it's going well. You’ll get it done someday.”
“I destroyed the Diary in the Chamber.
Draco tentatively curled his hand around the wand closing his eyes at the rush it gave him. He learned some wandless magic. Mostly healing spells after Potter took his. He didn't want his mother completely defenseless. Since then he's learned some more everyday ones. Regulus thankfully didn't comment and Draco trusted he wasn't the reason Potter was giving it back now.
“If the potion would be available and there would be multiple precautions to ensure another incident didn't happen, I would like to teach again.” Remus relented.
Once again the minister put his charms up. Harry didn't know where the need to keep Draco safe came from, where his anger that Draco was so ready and willing to give up and provide no defense came from. He didn't miss the way Draco looked like he wanted to be punished, like he wanted to get worse then his mother did, like that was what he deserved. He also didn't miss the way he flinched anytime Hermione's name was said, the way it looked like he stopped breathing altogether when Harry said Cursio, they way he looked at Harry like he was some type of alien when he revealed that he knew Draco let go of his wand on purpose. Draco also tensed up when Harry mentioned Lucius, but he had been doing that since first year so that was nothing new. Harry started to pull himself out of his head when he saw the charms going down.
Muggle-Born: Smart, Caring, Loyal
Remus supports me. He trusts people to make their own decisions.
Harry felt dread spread through him as he realized Draco has the mark and she would not be able to talk to him or see him. Their relationship kept him alive and he could not let it be taken away now.
Draco met with Nydia the day before break ended and he had to return to school. He met with her weekly now instead of multiple times a week so she knew about Harry and sectumsempra and everything else. At first they talked about Harry, and Christmas presents. Draco telling her about the wand and what it meant to both of them. Everything was going fine till she asked a question as far out as the Snitch could go.
“No, I would love to have you all close by.”
May 30th 1998
"Yeah. Im done. So what do you think?
Harry comes back an hour later with Ron in tow. He looks tired, Has blood smeared on part of his robes and A split lip. “He called some friends. They will all go away. The association with Lucius will earn most of them a very long time if not a life sentence and some were already wanted.”
They all wrap each other up in a tight hug.
“That is an Improvement. Cant you count the number of interactions that didn't end in hexes on two hands?” His mother commented.
“If we add a few drops of an anti-wart potion that the store sells for acne then it should get rid of that side effects without causing more problems.” Draco suggested to Hermione before Harry dropped a book in between them and started begging for help.
Harry and Draco walked around Hand in Hand in Hogsmeade. They were waiting until they were sure Remus and Sirius were done with their date before going to the new shop. Most of the students were already gossiping about them before they even walked in the restaurant. They just sat down when the first flash went off. And this is also another reason they went shopping first. Luckily the owner took care of the press guy quickly.
“As Potter pointed out Crouch Jr. was a Professor as well as Severus, and 50% of the staff last year were death eaters, you would hardly be the first. And most remember you fought on our side at the Battle of Hogwarts and died for it before that.”
“Did they find you James?” Regulus asked him.
“How's Hogwarts?” he asked.
“Well one the bright side you shouldn’t encounter that much resistance. People still trust you, they hope you can make the world a better place. They should believe that's why you want to change the schools.”
Everything that's happened in our family was because of my choice, that is not your fault. When I got sent here the first time, I know that you took my place to do what Voldemort wanted and I know that wasn't easy on you and that you failed multiple times, and Severus told me about Sectumsempra. I didnt tell your mother because you were already healed and it would stress her out more. I didn't figure out why the elder wand didn't work for him until after it was all over, Severus did not disarm Dumbledore that night did he?”
He heads inside and goes straight to Kingsley. “If I can not go to the manor, I would like to go to the Black Property in France. I will be available for easy contact.”
“Welcome to Vincent’s. What can I get for you guys?” The waitress smiled at them.
“I thought you said he would never…”
“Why is there a baby in our room?”
“We will be sure to contact him if either situation arises.” Regulus answered amicably.
“Actually Minnie, me and Reg talked. The kids will call me Sirius or Professor Sirius so we don't get confused.”
“Hey Harry, where’s Draco? Pansy sent me to get you guys for a…” Hermione trailed off.
“I already did, I took it the last week before break and had them regulate it, but told them it wouldn't be yours till Christmas.” Harry told him which got him a smile and a kiss. He stayed at the Malfoys for another hour before kissing Draco goodbye and hugging Narcissa and heading to Diagon to pick up a new wand then Godric's Hollow to visit his parents. He stayed with them for an hour then left for Grimmauld place. He spent the rest of the holiday with the weasleys and grangers with minimal yelling and lots of explaining till the kids still in school packed for Hogwarts again when break ended.
On the bright side, with Hermione and Draco busy, Harry and Ron had time to think a lot about their future.
“Sir may I pose a question?”
“Malfoy… how could you betray us?’ He asks ‘and Regulus how are you alive. I felt you die even though I do not know how.”
“Sure no problem.”
Voldemort asked if his latest mistake was Dumbledore's favourite solution,
Remus seemed to be struggling with Tonks. They didn’t have a relationship before the war. Sometimes Sirius’ name was thrown about in their fights. But they were both doing great with Teddy. Well as well as new parents do.
7 and a ½ year after they had their second child James Sirius Potter with Ginny being a surrogate.
"Harry, why do you open presents so slow?" James asked.
He’s nervous. He’s never been around this many people. Not since the time he was Three, that’s the only time he’s left the grounds. Grobb tells him his parents would have preferred him to be in slytherin. Grobb also tells him they will await him at home for the holidays no matter his house. He takes Grobb’s word over his parents.
Also there are 3 restricted places due to not being completely repaired or having an excess of dark magic. These areas are clearly blocked off please refrain from messing with them.
Harry sighs heavily. “No James. Not that its your business but we never did have sex.”
Harry and Narcissa ,which included Jimmy who Draco did end up liking, stayed at the hospital the entire time, till 3 days later when they took Draco home and they both started fussing over him so much he had to threaten to destroy their favorite things till they both apologized and started treating him normal again. Harry stayed for the next day till he got an owl from McGonagall saying he had to return to finish the last week and a half and begrudgingly left the Malfoy after getting another hug from Narcissa and a shy but 100 percent real smile from Draco. Harry ended up gathering all of Dracos assignments that he had to finish over break then walking them down to Hogsmeade at the end of that week. He ended up staying for dinner at the Malfoy house that friday.
Lestrange was killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, therefore no restitution was ordered by the ministry. But it seems as though someone with Access to her Vault’s has taken matters into their own hands.
He toddels down diagon alley for the first time ever with his mother. They are going to the bank, that's what mother said. People keep glaring and staring. He notices all the other kids in the alley are being pulled away from him and his mother. He thinks it's normal, this is the first time he's left the Manor grounds.
“Her hair is lighter, shorter.
“They are, and I don't like what you're insinuating. We are here to visit Lucius Malfoy, I trust there will be no problems with this.” Harry answered with a harsh tone.
“Draco. Pansy. Blaise.” Greg smiled at them as he sat down.
“I-I don't know. Who are you?”
They wished Mcgonagall for a lot of patience for when the next generation hit Hogwarts.
“It was lovely to see you all. Behave Sirius.”
“We got her two days ago. She was a very special surprise. We figured it would just be easier to tell you all here.”
Harry watched as Draco got up wondering if Draco actually thought they would send him to Azkaban Harry would never let that happen. He really needed to find out where this protective streak for Malfoy came from before it became a problem. He nodded to the Minister and started to follow the Malfoys out of the courtroom.
Very Little Dialogue in this Chapter. =)
The adults smiled at the hypothesi. “Hypothetically?” Harry asked.
Teddy turns around to babble with them. His emerald green eyes contrasting with his still platinum blonde hair.
Draco walked over to Regulus and Handed him the stack of parchment. Regulus looked at it and started to flip through.
“My dragon, please calm down, we must talk about it, not talking about anything may have been the reason it got so bad. That day in the forest I did ask Harry Potter if you were alive or not, I had not seen you at all and I had no clue. I lied to The Dark Lord because I knew if you were alive there was a chance Harry could beat him and you would be safe, If he would have said no I wouldn't have lied. You are the only thing left in this world that I care about. I love your father and I will always love your father but I can not care about the man he has become. I don't expect you to love your father or forgive him for what he has done.”
“Wait, are these real-time? Whoa they are. Draco, where did you get these? These are awesome.”
“I wanted to ask you some questions. You know I love Hogwarts and I love what I’ve learned here. But I also think you know the system is far from perfect. I think you and Hagrid might be the only adults that have never really let the students down. I want to know how the system works.
Lockheart who was a fraud and prepared to Obliviate me and Ron and let Ginny die for more fame.
“He will since he can't get to me or Scorpius. She’s the next person he’ll blame for letting it happen.”
Later the night Malfoy broke the routine, he didn't put up his privacy charms or draw the drapes. Harry did the same thinking he did it for a reason.
“The task Voldemort gave you was why he failed my boy,’ Lucius said while gently pushing Draco's hair back behind his ear, ‘Because you couldn't kill Dumbledore, Voldemort killed Snape and didn't get the wand.”
“I love you too father.” Draco said hugging his father good-bye. Draco and Harry went back to the Malfoys and told her everything except about the ministry.
“What if I'm just using you to rebuild my family name and I don't even realize it. It’s not hard to see how they got to that conclusion.”
“...Are you mental? Of course I don't. Who would after the things I've done.”
“Did you mean it?”
“Well after dueling, even in practice once the wand is given back to the original owner, it works fine. Maybe the wand will work for both of you. Maybe the elder wand will belong to both of you. There's no rule that a wand has only one owner. Mr. Olivander told you the wand changed its allegiance, but was also reasonably pliant, maybe it works for both of you.” She told him.
“About anything”
“I guess he is kinda cute. However I'm still questioning the safety of a baby with a wand.”
He then left his mother to go and look at the list of subjects he was given. He hadn't lied to his mother; he just didn't say as happy as he can be when he doesn't deserve even the littlest bit of happiness after all he's done. He opened up the piece of parchment and read the list, he could tell that this wasn't meant to be easy by a few points on the list.
“Dad?”
‘He wanted to fix the Room of Requirement. Room of hidden things. We started by putting out the fire. Then because of extraneous circumstances we had to cleanse the room. We eventually fixed it. We got it open.” He finished looking at Greg.
“Yes, and his name is Voldemort. Please use it. Fear of a name only increases fear itself.”
“Draco.” Grobb greets. Draco decided he didn't like them using Master after his first year.
Harry complied and left Draco room to sit next to him.
Him and his mother have been going through the family possessions since his first appointment, he didn't think of the journal again till he saw his mother with a stack of letters.
Two weeks later Narcissa’s House arrest ended. Draco and Regulus took her to her favorite restaurant in France for a nice night out.
“Thanks Ron. You're a great friend.”
Hermione and Regulus were close to solving her parents' memory problem.
“Oh yeah, um, they weren't.’ Most of the table looked toward him for an explanation. ‘I actually went to see Malfoy soon after to ask about it. He had a house elf kill them, that way he could bring them back healthy.”
"Mother, are you alright?"
"Okay, are you sure you have everything? -Yes- and you have only the pair's of robes that that ministry officer put protection spells on right?And-"
“It depends on one's definition of willingly. But I suppose Yes. But not for the reasons it stands for. It wasn't loyalty to The Dark Lord, more loyalty to my parents. I would say my family but that includes Sirius. I also think you should ask this question to who you really want to. His parents were in a much lower standing than mine. His reasons might be different.”
“Oh you would be an expert on that wouldn't you.” Harry replied bitterly.
Harry rolled his eyes. He opened the box to find a bracelet inside with a note.
Ron snorted. “Fair point. So no more fighting for Harry Potter, what are you going to do?”
Harry sighs heavily. “No. You’re not and We both know it. You’ve been distant this week. Putting up walls pushing me away on purpose. Did you not enjoy our date as much as I did? Do you regret it? Do you Regret coming out? Did I do something to upset you? Is it the prophet article?”
He asks Headmistress Mcgonagall if he can floo home. He claims to have a family emergency. She lets him. He doesn't like the portrait of late Headmaster Dumbledore; it creeps him out.
“No Draco that was good. I want you to keep adding to those opinions as we move forward. Now I want to ask you some questions they're very invasive and personal, but it's the only way I can help you. Are you ready for this?”
“So what do I do now?” Harry asked them.
“End of summer probably.” She answered slightly sheepishly.
“Thank you, you may leave now we will come out when we are done.” Harry dismissed the worker.
“I agree” Lily said
“You know I’m not claiming Muggles are perfect, but sometimes Purebloods really suck.” Lily told him.
“And you want to move mass amounts, don't you?”
Ron X2
Percy was next, then Ron, then Tonks one by one everyone agreed.
“Mr. Potter would teach Defense. Amycus Carrow taught last year.
“The Ladies are to the right, and The gentlemen are to the left. We’ll let you get settled in. As Professor McGonagall said you can not switch. Sorry I don't make the rules.” James said.
Outside Voldemort is speaking.
“He might have felt he was going to say something he would regret so he left quickly.” Sirius said.
“Hello, darling. You weren't meant to be home for another week. Something wrong?”
Mr. Lupin would teach History of Magic. It seems the battle enlightened Professor Binns to the fact he was dead.
“-James Sirius Potter.” The burnette baby. Draco finished.
Grobb is the first to show as always. Dobby shows up half a second later and automatically goes to hug Draco. He and Draco both frown when Grobb stops him. Jeal pops and pulls Dobby back behind her. Hoffey, Blort, and Evedy pop in then quickly line up behind Grobb heads down.
“The only way the things you're afraid of are going to change is how strong I know and think you are, and I'm only going to think you are stronger Harry.” Draco said while lying down on Harry and wrapping him in his arms. Harry said okay and the both closed their eyes to try to sleep.
“Do-’ Draco starts timidly. ‘Do you all want to come meet my family? Hoffey, Blort, and Evedy leave soon to do the second cleaning of the properties.”
“Um…’ Neville pauses not exactly sure how to explain he has but not in the conventional way. ‘Yes and No. Grandmother often said that your family should just change your last name to Gagnon and it would be more fitting.”
“How long do I have before you force me to do it anyway?” Harry asked not unkindly.
"MMm, both. Alright I better go so I'm not late. I love you Mother.
“Please sit.” Lily tells him. He sits next to Harry but Harry doesn't look at him.
Percy and some of the Weasleys still fought. Even though he came back during the battle and apologized, there was still hurt lingering.
That's what happened with your mother as well. She realized I wouldn't give up and she eventually accepted my feelings. That's when we got closer. I got closer to both of them after they accepted it. Acceptance is where everything starts.
“W-w-what do you mean?” His voice shakes.
“Alright everyone shut it!’ Ginny said from on top of a table. ‘We would like to congratulate and Thank Mr. Draco Malfoy for repairing the last restricted section of the castle allowing us to have this party.”
“Well, no, But you do and that's what's important.”
“The Auror department already has a warrant to search the manor.” Sirius tells him sympathetically.
“Yeah’ Draco agreed putting his head back in Harry's neck ‘we are still teenagers huh...Harry I need to know that this isn't a one time thing, that we’re going to go on dates and that you'll kiss me at school and we’ll be an actual couple.”
The students cheered and Mcgonagall sat back down. Ginny and Luna come over to the eighth year table and dragged Hermione down to Pansy Parkinson to start planning a party for the reopening of The Room Of Requirement.
“I also got some of Bellatrix Vault.’ Hermione commented. ‘The Vault for her Lestrange Vault was on the fifth level. I also got Bellatrix's personal Black Vault on the seventh level. He didn't even move the gold, just transferred the whole Vault into my name, said to use it for future campaigns about social change and rights.”
“Eh. You did well for your first mass cleansing.” Sirius told her.
“And Bellatrix’s victims?”
“Grobb! Jeal! Dobby!” He calls them. Hoffey, Blort, and Evedy are all at their other properties. They clean them out 3 times a year.
Out of habit Draco immediately went on the defensive “Why the bloody hell would I understand what some ministry puppet does.” He could almost feel the look his mother would be giving him right now after he promised to try. “Sorry, habit. I don't know why they sent me to you.”
“Alright then case dismissed, next case Draco Malfoy vs. the ministry, You are also a witness in this case Mr. Potter?” “Yes Sir” “Then you will stay where you are, also Mrs. Malfoy you are welcome to stay considering the defendant is your son, would you like to?” “Yes Sir” “We will now start the trial. Mr. Malfoy you have been accused of being a known death eater, allowing and aiding the trespass of death eaters onto and off of Hogwarts grounds, associating with many counts of the capture and tourture of Garrick Ollivander, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Griphook the goblin, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger. Now that you are aware of the charges you may defend yourself.”
Weasley made a tortured face that Draco realized was an attempt at sympathy. Maybe he should go on that walk and be murdered just to never experience this level of humiliation ever again. Draco turned to head back inside.
She brightened, and the familiar sound of her non-stop chatter lifted his spirits. This was familiar territory-- work, local, kebab, bed. He let himself settle into her stories and his cider.
“Do you hate me?” Draco asked quietly. He wasn’t brave enough to look at her.
to say yes.”
“Enjoy your evening, Potter, and try not to look like someone killed your owl.”
“How come I didn’t hear about this on the tel? You’re telling me that no newspaper, no tv station-- this is some cult shit, murdered fuckers eve--”
Miriam was doubled over in laughter, clutching her sides, and Draco wasn’t sure who to kill first-- her, Potter, or himself.
Almost.
Draco waited until her breathing evened out, and then waited some more while he figured out what to say. He shut his mouth after a moment. She had called him here anyway.
He watched them strike her as if in slow motion, and his stomach turned.
“Hermione said it was the worst moment of her life. Worse than the torture, worse than her parents forgetting her, worse than fighting any one of your former lot, because she trusted me more than anyone else, and I left when she needed me the most. I wake up every day next to the woman I love more than anything in the whole world
Miriam eyed the pastries with concern.
“Draco? Draco, love, you well?”
“Not to worry, they’re just old… acquaintances, from school. Brings back unpleasant memories, you know how it is, I’m sure.”
“I’m not expecting you to forgive me!”
“They’ve asked Iida to cater the Reopening ceremony.” He used all his years of breeding to keep his voice flat as possible. She would already know about it-- A Black is a Black, after all. Her eyes went dark.
“Yes, sir.”
In another world, Draco would have let his jaw drop to the floor hearing the word
, Draco.
She didn’t know, she doesn’t know, she can’t know.
He found himself awake there the next morning, the sun in his eyes. His bones cracked as he unfolded himself from the sofa.
“She’s been really improving since she’s moved out on her own. So much easier to breathe when the house is clean. Don’t you agree?” Draco put as much icy death in his eyes as he could, and Liam’s smile grew feral.
“I… my apologies that you had to hear that.”
The house was a flurry of activity after that, with people constantly moving in and out.
After so many years of tight lipped pain, the ability to bring smiles was a precious treasure Draco held close: like the talks with his mother, and the way it felt to chase a snitch, god he missed that, arms outstretched for a satisfying--
“Has it? It’s barely seemed long enough.” He’d never been so grateful for his mother’s years of tight-lipped training. Countdown from ten, Draco, countdown from from ten.
It was the simple things, wasn’t it really, the domestic bits of existence that --
“Stop!” Draco was surprised by his own vehemence. “That kind of talk is what got us into this mess, and what got my father Kissed. Forgive me or don’t, fair or not fair, I don’t feel the need to go back, no matter what you and your do-gooder friends might think. Now piss. Off.”
“Just Liam, but we keep it pretty quiet, last night was the first time I’d been to his new place anyway, just a short…” the blood drains from her face.
Draco panicked.
, it read,
“Let me show you the backroom entrance, yeah? There’s always something in the crate by the door.” Her voice was genial and placid, but her grip on his forearm was piercing as she dragged him out into the cold and through the back alley. She dropped his arm, and opened her mouth to speak before shutting it again abruptly. She sighed.
“You’re blocking the entrance, mate,” said a man in a peacoat, glaring peevishly. “Some of us have things to do.”
“You think you’re the only one? You and I both know what we’re actually not talking about, and it certainly isn’t my scrotty little fucking friend, as you so aptly put it.”
“--staying a bit later to finish the samples? I know Papa will want to, but his backs dead fucked, and he can’t be doing such delicate work for that long. I’ll pay you time and a haaaaallllllf.” She sang in his ear, and he rolled his eyes swatting at her and feeling giddy with relief.
“You yell in your sleep. Defending yourself, some Latin nonsense-- what kind of poncy fucking school is that by the way, still learning Latin.”
“Oh excellent, I knew I could count on you!” She beamed at him, and he smiled, feeling a pang in his heart at her open face. Why he’d picked her up in the first place.
,” she said exasperatedly, and he raised an eyebrow.
The phone was at his ear before he realized how pathetic he was being.
“The Ministry of Magic, War Crime Division, in accordance with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, would like to make a formal proposition to the heir of the Malfoy estate to restore and re-open Malfoy Manor as a place for those orphaned by the Second Wizarding War to practice their arts and a home base during school breaks.”
“Don’t look like that, you goose. I don’t need you faffing about in my business,” she said, waving away the apology bubbling in his throat. He choked down a sigh.
“I’m not blaming you. Fuckhead,” she said angrily, and before Draco could retort there was a quick rap on the door.
Draco blinked and they stared at each other. She collapsed onto a stool.
She blinked at him. Harry held his breath, but it was unnecessary. She threw her head back and let out a laugh, a full bellied guffaw that nearly threw him back with its force; Harry liked her better for it instantly.
“Really though love, I don’t think you realize how many people ask after you. I would be insulted that they’re always looking for the ‘fit blond with the perfect arse’ but I look at your arse more than they do.” She grinned, and he shook his head fondly.
A tentative dark hand adjusted familiar black frames around familiar green eyes.
“I am not a china doll, my dragon. I endured years of Him, encroaching on my marriage, on my child, living in
It felt so odd to Draco, after so many years of silent darkness. Something about it felt eerie, a ghostly echo of happier times now tainted with haunting screams.
“The bridge.” He said quietly, and she leapt up.
He arrived back at Iida in much the same condition he left it, bag still in the front where he’d dropped it.
Draco was thrilled.
“Take a Quiche Lorraine with you, you haven’t eaten all day!” Mr. Iida shouted through the swinging doors. Draco dutifully took one, stuffing it in his mouth and fastening his coat.
“Draco, we have a massive order. I mean really big. And important, by the looks of it. Must be very important, because I’ve never heard of them. Something about a prison renovation?”
“If they ask… about me… or how you knew about the pasties,” he croaked, “if that
It was a good little life, now; left alone, work held to a challenging standard, a hellion poking her nose in just often enough to entertain. It was good to nourish peoples’ bodies, to watch the lines smooth away just a little as they put treats in little hands, or picked up a cake in anticipation. He’d never been smiled at so much in his life.
“The brown one, you unpolitic hag.”
Granger’s voice sounded far away as she pushed the doors open softly.
?” Miriam said, and Weasley cracked a grin.
“I do hope everything is going smoothly with this big order, Draco.” The man looked at him calmly. “There is--”
And when she begged for his help last Christmas, he’d jumped at the chance to do
Draco shot up out of his seat in a panic, searching for a way out of the conversation, but Harry’s voice was steady and easy after a moment’s hesitation.
” she pointed her hand at the cookie. “--is stealing.”
. Butter.
He stood till he had calmed down, and as if on cue, he heard a rustling of skirts. She looked up at him evenly.
“Sit.” She pointed at the chaise, and he sat down warily. She glared.
“That’s wonderful. Can’t have my boys fighting each other, or you’ll have no energy to fight with me,” she said liltingly. Draco clenched his teeth.
“Iida eyebrow down, please. Nothing to see here.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You must have the wrong person. My name is Mallory. Am I correct in assuming you’re the one making the absurd demand to create an entirely new pastry in the next two days?” He said coolly, hoping his eyes wouldn’t betray his desperation. She winced, turning to Miriam.
“Sorry, sir, I’m not at my best today.”
“Your days are numbered, pest,” He hissed threateningly, and Draco laughed his best tinkling, deadly, Narcissan laugh.
“What?” Draco looked into her face, but it was hard and terrifying.
“He thought…. He thought… fucking
“They want over a thousand of every seasonal item, but in miniature, if you can bloody believe it, plus miniatures of the savory items from the end of summer, though heaven can only surmise where we’ll get cherries from in fucking April and not have them be absolute rubbish. Plus a cake shaped like some dead bonkers castle, though that’ll be me, obviously.”
.” He wiped tears from his eyes, sitting up a little straighter. “You can’t tell me that isn’t the most objectively hilarious thing since my father was chased around the manor grounds by peacocks for twenty minutes in his best clothes.
“When they arrive, I’m guessing you’d like to stay in the back? You’re welcome to put on a mask if you’re worried. You take care of the morning baking, and and they shouldn’t be too long,” she said softly, and he nodded.
“That,” he said, “must be the most intelligent thing you’ve said since we were eleven.” Potter’s eyes were alight with mirth, and Draco was surprised to find himself smiling back. He sighed. No point in fighting it any longer.
“Do you know you have
“This is too rich. Too
It was clear that the Chosen One was only now realizing what a very stupid decision it had been to come here, and Draco found himself deflated.
“Harry, darling, I think you should leave me alone with my son.”
“It was meant, but also correct,” said Harry. “Your mother approached us more than a year ago with the idea. We thought it was brilliant, and Ron and Hermione’s research confirmed it. We knew we wouldn’t have time until Azkaban was finished, and she wouldn’t give us the go ahead until you said yes. She also wouldn’t tell us where to find you, so you can imagine our predicament.”
He was suddenly too revolted with himself to continue.
He felt Miriam’s eyes on him, but he kept his eyes forward studiously.
“Are… are you...lost?”
,he’s on his day off. He doesn’t need to know you’re here unless I decide to tell him, and papa won’t blow it, because he just thinks you’re a hungry, harmless, village idiot. Just tell me if you’re here to spy on our progress or to ruin his life.”
He looked at the clock. Merlin. It was nearly midnight, and he’d have to be back in the wee hours to do the regular work of morning prep besides.
His mother’s eyes stopped twinkling.
Sure enough, he arrived to Miriam sparkling like fresh snow, eyes growing even brighter as she took in his appearance.
He debated going in, and was about to turn and walk away when the door opened again. In the doorway stood a gruff-looking man with angled black eyebrows, round cheeks belying the wrinkles framing quick, severe eyes.
“It’s fine.” Draco found his voice after a moment. “Miriam’s always taking in strays.”
“He told me,” Draco said with some difficulty, “that he knew what it was to regret. To want to go back and change the future. But what if it’s impossible?”
“Get out, you bastard!” Miriam's voice sounded miles away as grey eyes met green, storm clouds unleashing torrents on the moors.
“I’m here because we can’t afford to lose you, Malfoy, to lose anyone. Why do you think we’re doing this? Why we changed Azkaban from the ground up? The great enemies are dead. Grindelwald, Voldemort, they succeeded because we divided ourselves before they ever began. It’s time to bring back our own. You are the last of your line, and one of the only left with roots going back to the Sacred 28.”
“No!” Weasley’s hand shot out. “No, no, everything’s fine. Sorry, I’m a bit shit at this. Everyone is fine. I just-- look, mate, d’you have a few minutes? Mind spending it on a bit of a walk?”
Her eyes twinkled at his droll tone.
Somehow, this had become his life. Sighs upon sighs, step after step. Of course it would be those three fiends here ruining his perfect little oasis.
“When’s it done? Next month?”
by themselves? No offense meant, Harry dear,” she said over her shoulder. Potter held up his hands.
“Oh no, I’m--” he tried to protest, but it was too late. The man disappeared inside, and Harry followed him in.
“Finally had the guts to actually come in instead of stalking about out there, then, did you?” Her smile was just dangerous enough, and Harry blanched.
“Finally!” Mr Iida’s pleased voice boomed out, “About time, young man. Always good to see a reformed youth back in our doors. Come to finally buy something, have you?”
“Don’t, yeah? I know, I know what you’re about to say but-- he’s got clean, he’s made himself better-- who am I to deny him a chance? He did it for me, getting clean and sober and I can’t...I just can’t let it be for nothing.” Her voice cracked with emotion, but the accompanying conviction dropped a stone deep into Draco’s stomach. “What can I do? I love him,” she said, continuing before he could stop her. “I love him, and he’s a cunt, but-- we went through so much together. I can’t abandon him now, Draco, yeah? You understand. He needs me,” she said quietly, and he knew all hope was lost. His eyes stung as he blinked rapidly, dread settling deep in his bones.
“Mr. Iida, I-- oh, it’s just you,” he said, equally relieved and annoyed as his eyes met the brown laughing eyes of his head baker.
It made him sick.
“Do you really think they came up with it
“Maybe he deserves you. Fucking hell.” She thrust a slightly misshapen croissant in his hands.
“To be fair, I extended the hand of friendship first.” Draco said mildly, but Harry shook his head.
“What’s happened?” she said quickly.
“Of course, my dove. You’ve just come upon Draco and I getting reacquainted. We’ll be seeing so much of each other from now on that I thought we might bury the hatchet.” Liam kissed her, and Draco felt ill.
“Cheers then. What have I got to lose anyway, eh?”
Draco knew who it was before he even turned around.
“Sit.” The old man said, pulling out a chair at the side and sniffing in clear disapproval. Harry sniffed his clothes surreptitiously. Nothing too strange. James obediently took a seat, and the old man nodded.
“You’d drop dead before you even touched me, you feculent leech. And if I see even a single blemish, I swear on my father’s--”
“Listen, cunt. Whatever thing he’s done, and if you tell me I
“Cor, I wish Hermione was here, she’s so much more diplomatic about it. Just suppose I better crack at it and be done, yeah?”
Miriam found them doing just that a few hours later, tears pouring out of Draco’s eyes as he doubled over in laughter.
“See you on the week-end!” she said cheerily, sauntering back into the shop, leaving fragrant aromas of pastry and cream in her wake.
“I thought I could escape, that it would keep you safe. It was selfish, and I’m sorry. If I had known, I-- please, believe me, I would have never…”
“It’s just…
“You fucki--”
Draco’s back shot straight up.
Draco blanched. Iida hadn’t closed a single day. Ever. It was a point very well-hammered into Draco’s psyche from the interview on. Keeping tradition was important. Draco understood.
“No eating at the prep counter, you know the rules,” Miriam Iida said sternly, popping the slice into her mouth with a lazy smirk. He pointed dramatically as she chewed. She shrugged.
“Draco, love, can you show them where to sit, please.”
He nodded forlornly, eyes downcast, and was suddenly encompassed in warm softness. Arms encircled his shoulders, and he melted into the felten cloud of old cigarette smoke and cheap ALDI fabric softener.
“Not a word,” he hissed.
Draco was nothing if not a dutiful friend, and he and his triple shot were waiting for her on the bench, staring pensively at the expanse of grass.
“Oh, this is so rich,” she said, still cackling. “Take your break now, love. I’ll bring him round the back,” she said, wiping her teary hands on her apron as she kicked the door open.
“Nothing wrong with the rest of it from where I’m sitting. I just don’t think it’s healthy for you and my father to have the same pastimes. Doesn’t have to be anything too serious, you know. Get off and fuck off, eh?”
“Then just be out with it and have fucking done, will you?” Draco stood a little taller, crossing his arms. The man fidgeted under his steel gaze.
“Playing nice boys?” Miriam popped up, eyes dark and anxious above a falsely bright smile.
“It’s still the morning, so we haven’t much, but-- oh, it’s
“What did she say?” His mother’s voice sounded even flatter than his, and something in him snapped.
“It’s a reopening? Of sorts. Some sort of prison reform. I’m out of my depth, but you’re welcome to take a look,” she handed him a sheet, and it was all he could do not to toss them in the oven. He set it above his workstation, heart beating wildly.
“I’ve told you once, I’ve told you again, use the back entrance--”
“What? Like Bullies? I’ll bash their fucking heads in, never mind the money Draco--”
Harry stood up, taking a bite of the rich flaky cookie and groaning in appreciation. Something was coming. Change was in the air.
“I came in early to finish the tea cakes, so after lunch you’ll have the oven for the pasty test bakes. Bloody pumpkin biscuit pasty business. He wouldn’t even touch the kabocha egg custard tarts. Rubbish, that is.”
He looked mournfully at the half-prepped apples, but went back with renewed determination. He could always just eat the middling slice, he realized, and it was halfway to his mouth before a strong manicured hand snatched it from his grip. He startled.
“Did I ask for your opinion? Is it your name above the shop? No. Go away and come back tomorrow if you’ve decided to be competent.” Mr. Iida continues shaping loaves without a second glance, and Draco knew he had lost.
“Fair is fair, I suppose. The difference is, mate, your dad decided to off anyone who disagreed with him.” Draco snorted, and Weasley gave an easy smile.
“You’re done. You can stop by the shop and apologize when you’re sober.”
that your love life is an actual wreck, love. Unless you’re hiding something?” her eyebrow arched in a perfect impression of her father, and he rolled his eyes.
He let himself get lost in the easy companionship of the work for the rest of the day. As predicted, Mr. Iida was disgruntled at his daughter’s perky demeanor, but had elected to remain silent rather than thundering at her and letting her thunder back.
“Erm, yes, sorry, probably does. You seem fine by our scan, with no lasting damage internally or externally. Are you sore? Where were you hit? Was there ground impact?” he asked, and she shook her head.
“Yes.” The words flicked out as quick as fire.
He hung his apron on the hook as he walked outside to see his archenemy and best friend glaring at each other across the alley.
“I’d go back and kill my father my own fucking self, if I thought I would change anything.”
you and you don’t like it… promise me you’ll let me keep you safe,” he said, voice thick with how many times he wished he’d said it before now, and her soft brown eyes echoed the concern in his.
He never expected the father of brilliant, smiling Miriam would be an exacting, hawk-eyed Master that took him right back to being eleven. He never expected to adore the work-- the elegant symmetry of simple and complex that entwined each creation that entered the storefront.
“Bollocks,” Miriam said, but it was without heat as she nodded goodbye to Potter and headed back in.
His father’s ashen face as they wheeled him in, his mother’s worried face still strong and beautiful, head high and cheeks just rosy enough for Draco to know it was flush.
“You’re to keep her safe, you know.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, you can always tell me.” His eyes narrowed. “How long though? Why didn’t you tell me before?"
Draco knew in a second. Of course he knew. How could he not? He’d had them every year, wrapped in hopes and love and new challenges, fresh with magic, when everything was as simple and heartbreaking as it ever would be.
“This is quite good,” he said, blinking. She snorted, throwing up her hands.
“NO!” Weasley jumped. “No no no, shite, I am fucking rubbish at this.” Weasley put his hands over his eyes.
“Just as well,” he said simply, and turned to the refrigerator.
“That fucking tosser, Draco, I’m so sorry, this is
“You well?” She asked quickly. He pulled himself together to say yes, but somehow only managed a despicably small, “no.”
“We’re the last of our kind, you and I,” said Weasley. Draco stopped in his tracks, blood curdling. “Our people are dying out faster than they can be replaced.” Draco turned, incredulous, sure that the vengeful ghost of Bellatrix Lestrange had suddenly inhabited his second-to-least-favorite redhead.
“Yeah, that’s what he said too.” Harry’s eyes widened as her words sank into his bones. He knew Malfoy felt remorse, but still-- hearing it from the mouth of a Muggle, in Malfoy’s confidence-- the cognitive dissonance made his brain hurt.
“I’m…I’m sorry, Malfoy. I just had to see.”
“Miriam, what happened...when I was younger… more… oh, how do I even start--” How could he explain what he’d done? How could he convince her not to hate him when he hated himself so intensely. “Miriam, I don’t know if I can tell you. I did some awful things. Some really, really terrible things. People go to prison for life for what I did.” He took a deep breath.
, Draco,
“Did they torture you?”
“Fraid, not mate.” Panic shot through Draco.
“Wazzat?” Harry gave him a mock offended look, and Draco shook his head.
Granger raised an eyebrow.
“Close your eyes please, I’m going to use this scanner and the light could hurt your eyes. Just standard procedure, nice deep breaths please” he said, whipping his wand out as soon as her eyes closed and drawing clear, steady lines.
Still salveagable. He sighed with relief, stomach still roiling, images flashing.
“I’m not on the clock, am I?”
Looking only slightly mollified, Miriam nodded, and they both went back to their work, allowing the day to pass in companionable silence.
Miriam slammed back in, fury in her eyes. She stopped short, eyes darting across his face.
“If something… if you were… you would tell me, yeah? If you were in trouble? Or if there… I saw how you were yesterday, and I’ll call the whole thing off...you know, if… oh, bollocks!” She swore under her breath, and he felt a rush of affection.
“Can’t we bake them into more curved shapes? Or somehow refine them a bit? They’ll look so out of place with the others.” She picked up one half, inhaling the fragrant, softly spiced steam.
“Er, the 30th. Of this month.” The way she winced told Draco she’d yet to tell her father. He’d lose his mind if he found out.
“Didn’t take it well then?” He said, the cold water and soap on his skin a welcome jolt, and she scoffed, eyes hard.
“I… Miriam, what’s wrong? I don’t--”
“Look, I’m having a little party this weekend, just me and my band. Why don’t you come along and ask him yourself, eh? It’s my house, so he can’t throw you out.” She flapped her hand at the bag, and he opened it to reveal a mouthwatering palmier as big as his face. She grinned.
be happening.
“Come in!” he said automatically, and Weasley strode in in smart pastel green scrubs (his mother had such an eye for clothing transfiguration).
Trust his life to go tits up at the exact moment she needed him the most.
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but she popped a pilfered grape into his mouth instead. He gave up.
“Well,” Granger said, looking around wildly. “It’s been a while, Malfoy.”
“Yes! I--no, of course not, but if it kept you safe I’d kill him and let you hate me in a second.” They were both on their feet now, air crackling.
Weasley chuckled. “Not at all, Malfoy. What we need from you requires no biological equipment at all,” he said. “And really, not much from you. Just your mum.”
“In the forest, after we escaped from the Ministry. I left them to die, and they almost did. I was weak and petty and selfish, and in my defense a little bit cursed by that fucking demon locket.” He shook his head.
Too late now, he thought to himself--but breathed a sigh of relief all the same when she answered the phone.
Weasley looked haunted.
He froze. No mistaking that voice. In pain, in joy, in fear. Unmistakeable.
The door banged open, and the air heated in his lungs.
Fuck. When had life become so complicated? He’d left his old life behind to live peacefully, without all the baggage that upset him. All he’d been this entire week was upset.
Draco felt wrung out, and Weasley looked the same. They sat in silence for what felt like an eternity.
“Miriam, I-- are you hurt? Are you all right?” He said, pulling back and looking at her face. Chin a bit scraped up (he thought he’d caught her before she hit the ground), face red, eyes a little hurt and lost but mostly angry. Angry was good. Angry was alive.
“Coffee or Tea?” she asked. He blinked.
Draco’s eyes sliced over to her innocent brown ones in accusation. She shrugged and took a sip of her latte. It hovered next to her lips, and Draco pushed it down with a slim, pointed finger. She rolled her eyes.
“Pay attention, Draco!” Mr. Iida’s voice cut through his haze, and he snapped his head up.
“Milk, sugar?”
“You’re horrid. Besides,” he said morosely, “we both know the problem lies less with the blond part and more with the rest of it.”
Draco felt his own blood pumping through his head as he plunked down on the plastic crates, speechless.
“I’d rather not be murdered in broad daylight, thanks.”
How did he end up here? What had occurred to lead Malfoy to this point? How did a pureblood darling, bastion of magic, become a Muggle baker in the middle of London?
The green ink glittered in a distinctly magical way-- Draco wondered if Miriam had been able to see it.
“Well done though Draco love, really. I’m proud of you, Mister ‘I can’t bake’. Maybe we can make this a seasonal.” She paused for a moment.
” she said, lowering the bag with a smirk.
“That is just lovely, isn’t it. Much better than I expected. The look's still shit though. No braiding allowed? Maybe a leaf? A touch of mirror glaze?”
“Do you have any other family? People who might be in danger?” Narcissa continued, and Miriam shook her head.
Potter!”
“Fit ginger’s my
“Yes. Her injuries seemed congruent with Stunning, so I believe she’ll be alright. It will--” she stopped him with a finger. “It will, of course, still require a Healer in the interest of prudence, and I’ve already sent for one,” she sniffed. “Even if it is just Mr. Weasley.”
The bell tinkled.
Miriam met drunkenly accusatory green eyes with brown eyes full of enough pity and disgust that Harry immediately put his head in his hands.
Sure enough, he felt the fog lift as soon as he heard three voices chorus in the dining room. It was inevitable now, and so it would be. The sooner this started (and ended), the sooner he could go back to his mundane life, and his mundane problems, and
“Why are you here?” Draco felt the words burst out of him, and felt green at the desperation he heard in his own tone. “I’m not bothering you, not underfoot or in the way. I paid for my crimes, though we both know it wasn’t enough and won’t ever be enough. Can’t you leave me in peace?” To his own abject horror, he started to feel tears welling up in his eyes.
“Er...hi.”
“What?”
“Mother, I--” he was cut off by a second set of footsteps, and a too-fucking familiar set of spectacles and untameable hair popped up behind her. He looked at her eyes, twinkling below delicate eyebrows, and realized he’d been had.
He sighed as he changed his shirt, and again when he went out the door; he sighed in the barely awake line for posh coffee, and again when he binned the empty cup.
“No!” Oh, what the Trio would say if they heard this. “No. Being truthful, if anyone was bullying, it was probably me. But it’s all over now. Water under the bridge.”
“Mother, what if…” Draco said, gaining strength, and she shook her head.
“Full disclosure, mate, your mother’s a big part of it.” He sat a little straighter, and Draco rose up to meet him. “She’s the perfect fundraiser, well-liked, respected. People we both know should be behind bars will follow her as a way to regain status they thought would never come. Others will follow because of the cause-- and others because we all know your mother throws a damn good party.” They both grinned. “Even when I hated you, I still crossed off the days before the Samhain Ball.”
He stuffed the sheaf of paper in his bag hastily; a single page fell out.
“Come in boy, and stop staring. We’re not a charity, but we’ll not have you go hungry either.”
“My dragon, do you not think you are worthy of goodwill and sympathy?” She asked, eyes filled with emotion. He sputtered.
“They’ll be back in two days. And offered enough for the trouble to give you a very nice Halloween bonus besides.” She folded onto the stool, head falling onto floured muslin. A cloud billowed around her dark hair.
“I couldn’t, when it came down to it. I raised… I tried, but it was… for once my cowardice was useful.”
“Which was you,” Miriam said with a laugh, clearly oblivious to Draco’s chest constricting tighter and tighter with each breath.
“Acceptable?” He asked through gritted teeth, and she nodded, opening her mouth to speak. He held up a hand imperiously.
Draco was frozen the whole time she was out, unable to do anything for fear of being seen. It seemed an age before she strode back in. He jumped.
“My wife will be chuffed you said that,” he said, sitting down easily and turning her wrist over, checking her pulse.
arse,” she said, kissing her fingers lightly, and he snorted into his beer.
Even so, her laughter was tinged with sadness, and it gave him the courage to tell her.
“UPSET!!!” Her yelp shot three pigeons up into the air. She sat back down with a grumble. “Alright, fair enough, bloody birds, I’m upset.”She stared at him intensely.
“We’ll do it. Get out,” he said tersely. Granger nodded, and as quickly as they came, they were gone. Draco sighed.
“I concur. I meant to do some research last night--” meaning ask Tilly, his mother’s last remaining house elf, for the recipe, “-- but I got a bit distracted talking to my mother.” He turned to the list airily, and was stopped.
“I’m sorry, what?”
That night, for the first time in over a month, he firecalled his mother, her eyed crinkling like Christmas wrapping as she described her garden.
“Right, er, sorry,” he said, stepping to the side hastily. He didn’t remember walking across the street, but here he was, face practically pressed against the glass as he stared at the glass case full of delicate pastries. The fragrance wafted over him as the man swept out, and his stomach growled loudly enough to be embarrassing.
“I… It;s gonna be all right. Fuck, it is, yeah? But honestly, you don’t get to say anything about Liam anymore. You have to--”
“Don’t move, Green Eyes,” she shot back behind him, and Harry lamented his strange circumstances and damnable curiosity until she came back, steam blooming from the paper cup.
Draco sighed, and Weasley produced a roll of parchment out of nowhere.
“You’d already settled it, hadn’t you. You were just waiting for
“S’nice and warm,” she mumbled, clearly getting drowsy, and Weasley jerked his head to the seat beside her. Draco slid in, holding her steady as the clear golden rings faded. She opened her eyes.
“You are the only Malfoy left,” she said. “It’s up to you what we do and do not do.” She reached out and touched his face.
“Still enjoying a nice sulk, love?”
“Er, I’m not here for a handout, sir.” Draco’s blood ran cold, and he didn’t dare look at Miriam, whom he could feel shaking with mirth from across the table.
“Draco, I-- is that your
The next two minutes happened both in slow motion and all at once.
! I’ve half a mind to tell them all to piss off right this minute!”
“Enough about my arse. What about yours? Liam still sniffing around?” he said with a sneer, and her posture shifted. He groaned inwardly. Liam was a pissant, an alcoholic footie fanatic who’d somehow convinced his incandescent best friend that he was worth her time-- he watched her slowly dim, month after month until her light was barely there. Draco had never quite managed to prove it, but he’d seen too many bruises back then to excuse.
He ignored her. His heart was beating too quickly. Why had he said that?
“I meant to tell you soon, but never found the time. Papa needs surgery, but he’ll need someone for a few months. We were thinking of keeping you on only part time and just closing all but bread service and special orders… or… well, closing entirely.”
He almost dropped the paper. So much history. All down to those three names. He knew he should feel something-- bitterness, gratitude, something-- but he just felt tired. He stuffed it in his bag, walking home barely conscious, eyes closed for what seemed only a brief moment before his alarm blared.
you’re on about,” she said, her aggressive tone a stark contrast to the gentle passing of the cup. “Or who you are to my best friend, but if you continue skulking around here I’ll not hesitate to find you and murder you in your sleep.” Her voice was tight and deadly, and he opened his mouth to reassure her, but the words caught in his throat. He sipped his coffee in lieu of a reply, and was pleasantly surprised.
“Anyway, I--  my mother and I, on separate occasions, happened to save his life. Out of absolute cowardice on my part, mind you, but it was enough  to exonerate us with just a slap on the wrist and a chunk of g-gold.”
He walked into the already lit storefront-- Miriam jumped as he entered.
“Absolutely. Take care, Draco,” he said with infuriating kindness. Draco thought idly about slamming the roof down on his head. He waited until the ash settled in the fireplace before opening his mouth. He closed it again, not sure of what to say suddenly, and tea appeared on the side table. His mother sighed.
“Do I look like a stray to you?” he said, inwardly thanking every God that he’d taken care with his clothes today. Something vicious sparked in him, the Malfoy blood rising.
“No, sir.”
“An absolute wizard at everything he wanted to do,” Harry said. “And an absolute cock to anyone he didn’t like.”
Draco got ready for work with little joy-- Sundays were his least favorite anyway, and he had no desire to face either a post-shag Miriam or a terrifying Mr. Iida, no doubt also annoyed by his daughter.
His breath stopped.
, he said to himself as he laid out the croissant dough. Butter. Fold.
The end of it saw them covered in flour, pumpkin smeared on noses and collected in his glasses.
“Well-- I mean--I don’t need it. Or them. And their quiet condescension. They can take it back the whole lot of them. Malfoy’s don’t take charity, especially the emotional sort.”
“There, now, my dragon.” His mouth was full of hair. “It’s all right now, darling, she’s safe.”
She pulled out a sheaf of paper from her handbag.
“Yes, I’ve noticed. Get out. Miriam is coming in later today to start on the cake layers, so she can do the rest. Good for her to have a bit of extra work for once in her life.”
“Life’s not fair. And even if we
She pulled out the picture for reference, and his blood froze. It must have shown, because Miriam put down her papers, face alarmed.
“Oh my GOD!” Miriam leapt up, and fire raced through Draco’s brain.
“You know I love you no matter what, right?”
“Hello? May we come in?”
“Fair is fair, can’t say I wouldn’t do the same in your place.”
“I know, I know,” she said, as if reading his mind, “but we’ve got no special orders this month, and the compensation is enough to run the shop for months and give you a bonus besides. Anyway, someone will come by tomorrow to talk. Has to be early morning though apparently, so would you mind--?”
Weasley let out a barking laugh.
“As always, your ability to distill modern romance astounds and inspires.”
But just-- well, Harry had so many
“Yes. If. You. Don’t. Mind.” Draco said through his teeth, counting backwards wildly as he resisted the urge to strangle him. Weasley sighed, straightening up.
“Look, I know it sounds the same, but it couldn’t be more different. No murdering, no registries, no halfbreed blood traitor Muggleborn bullshit, yeah? We’re trying to cultivate what we already have, that’s all it is. Keep what we have and grow our own even more. Show the world that pureblood wizards and witches are more progressive than ever, and ready to earn our good names back. ” Weasley looked so earnest, Draco had a powerful urge to slap him. He calmed himself.
“Malfoy, it’s the perfect place. Massive grounds, totally secluded, with enough room to house the children and an extra wing besides. Excellent security, private floo network. A small muggle town close enough to allow muggle visitors to access the grounds. Believe me, Hermione has pored over every book, run every number and statistic you can think of, and some besides. There is nowhere better in Britain than the Manor.” Weasley’s face was solemn, and Draco felt nauseous.
“Not. A. Word. Just leave.”
“Fuck, no, Malfoy, I--”
could be in control.
“Trust me, I know exactly what they want,” he said confidently. She nodded, still tense, and went out. Her brows were still furrowed when she came back in, but the anger in her eyes was gone.
They misconstrued, as innocents often do.
“I know what it is to regret, Draco. To hate yourself enough that death sounds better than another day you know you don’t deserve.” Weasley wiped his eyes.
If Granger hadn’t told them already, there would be no mistaking his identity after that. At this point, he felt like a zombie, barely holding his head above water. Once they knew, they knew, and that was that. At least this way,
“Shove off,” he said without any real venom, and Miriam relaxed a fraction.
” She wiped tears from her eyes, digging around in her apron pockets. She handed him a card and a bag.
She grinned sheepishly.
“I was

about this. How to talk around Muggles and keep their ears safe.
a story,” Potter said, mirth sparkling in his own eyes, and Draco felt something he was very worried was not just grain alcohol.
“You cannot fathom how long I have waited for something to do, my dragon. I waited until you were ready for the challenge too. And it will be a challenge, my love. I will not be able to do it alone.”
“No room for error, Mr. Iida, absolutely.” The old man blinked, looking steadily at Draco.
“Of course, you hag. Just leave the list.”
He felt his mother before he saw her, the smell of orchids and silk so familiar he rubbed his face against her skirt, too exhausted to move.
“Miriam, there are a total of four tables, if they’re stupid enough to get lost they don’t deserve to be here,” he said snappishly. She frowned, narrowing her eyes.
“But… my mother,” Draco finally said, weakly, and Weasley gave a small, wry grin.
“Oi! Draco! Unbelievable. You haven’t heard a word, have you.” Draco shook an unapologetic head. She worried her lip.
“Excellent. Then you can pick out and hull these strawberries.” He set a massive bowl of glistening red jewels and a minuscule pick on the table. Draco stifled a groan. “When you’re finished, perhaps you’ll be ready to focus,” he said, and Draco picked up the pick obediently, pulling his apron tighter as he grabbed a plump, wild, berry. He hunched over the strawberry, squeezing it lightly.
They all thought playing Muggle doctor was very funny, judging by how frozen Narcissa’s face was.
“How many times?”
hasn’t told them already-- just say it’s a partial payment of a life debt.”
“You bullied him.” Her eyes hardened.
“I won’t, mate. Please. I didn’t come here to argue with you. Miriam let me have it for what I said last night, and she wasn’t wrong. There’s no way to go forward if we don’t leave the past behind us,” Potter said, and his voice was so earnest and hopeful Draco was dangerously close to believing it.
“If I’m fit ginger, what’s he?” Weasley gestured to Harry, all but forgotten in the corner of the room. She gave another smirk.
“I do not repeat myself, boy. You know this.” Draco nodded slowly.
“A little over a week, really, as far as it being, well, official-- I was always going to tell you, I meant to tell you sooner, but you were--” she made a series of flailing motions, and he groaned for the umpteenth time.
This uses events from movies rather than books for better continuity. Keep safe in these strange times.
“Don’t think this is over, Mallory,” she said, shoulders squared as she carried out serving platters, kicking the doors open with a bang.
kill you myself, by the way. Whatever he’s done, it’s bad enough that he’s never felt he could turn to any of you, and never tried. Whatever weird little cult world you two are in, he has left behind for this. He screams in his sleep every night to be taken away, to not see whatever horrors you have seen. Is that not fucking apology
“The Millennium Bridge. You blew up the fucking Millennium Bridge.”
“Never bake when you’re upset, Draco. It’ll never turn out quite right,” he said sternly, hanging up his daughter’s apron as he went back out into the storefront.
Signed--
“That guy,” said a voice from behind him. “Looks like an absolute twat. And next to you, that’s saying something.”
“Just promise me-- if he gets… if he hurts you, ever, if he
“Oh, shut.” Miriam’s voice had an edge to it, and Draco furrowed his brow.
His mother was on her feet in a flash, grabbing his arms firmly before he even realized the ground had tilted.
“All right cheers, see you in two days, this way then,” Miriam said briskly, cutting in not a moment to soon and practically dragging that earnest monstrosity out of the room. All the air went with her, and he collapsed onto the table.
“Take me to her?” He asked, and she nodded, procuring a delicate vial of her homemade Pepper-Up from her skirts. The taste was so familiar, indulgent with love on his tongue. He burst into tears.
Well? WELL? How could anyone look at Azkaban and feel well?
The apple slices would be uneven-- nothing detectable by the average eye, but Mr. Iida would be sure to notice. He swore under his breath, but gave it up as lost as he went to pull the loaves out of the open, enjoying the satisfying click of the trays on the resting racks.
“Bit shit of a doctor, not reading the file,” she said, smirking. “But yeah still a bit sore in the lower back. Draco caught me mostly before I hit the ground, I think. Is that,” she turned to Draco, and he nodded.
“Many times,” she said definitively. Draco blanched.
A thought suddenly occurred to him.
“Cheers for the clarification, guv, proceed.”
“No, Mother! Just regular--” if he thought any more about what it might mean to have to close Iida tomorrow, to face Miriam’s father-- ”just regular.”
“It’s fine,” Draco said, voice sounding strange to himself. “It’s over. If the pasties were acceptable, take the order. He glanced up at the door to see Granger’s face, worried eyes wide, and felt a rush of anger.
“Yes, yes, alright, I’ll leave you alone. Score those and pop them in, would you?”
.” He spat the words out. His mother was quiet for a long time.
“Sometimes, my love,” she said, holding his face in her hands, “the impossible is the only thing worth doing.”
. Turn.
?” She let go of his face.
“No, I don’t hate you, fuck’s sake. Not my favorite discovery, I must say, but-- I’m a bit in shock, yeah? Not every day this shit comes at you.”
“That is good, my dragon. They will keep him safe, I am sure of it. Shall we walk?” She propped him, sailing through the hallways and making it look like he was the leader.
“Fuck. And I thought my dad was bad,” she said awkwardly. He snorted.
, mistaken for … a
“I didn’t catch who it was either. She was definitely hit from the back, but I just picked her up and--”
“Sure,” Draco sat down heavily, closing his eyes as he leaned against the cool concrete. “Why the fuck not.”
“Yes, well.” Narcissa’s smile was still wide. “The tea is ready.”
Ding!
“The shop--”
“Petits in the oven, ta love.” She barely looked at him, and when she did, he saw his tiredness reflected.
He just wished he knew if it was good or bad.
He couldn’t help the pang of satisfaction watching veritable steam rise from Potter’s ears.
The sound rang in his ears as he stepped daintily into the foyer, heart beating wildly. He’d sent the scrolls ahead to his mother before closing up shop, unable to handle them staring at him from his bag. He knew she’d have already read them-- “it’s in terrible bad taste, my dragon,” she used to say, “to leave correspondence unread.”
“She’s in the infirmary with Tilly. Harry tried to bring you as well but I told them I’d take care of you,” she said with a gentle urgency, and Draco forced his eyes to look at her, to notice everything. Her wand on the floor. No blood anywhere, so no splinching. The way her eyes held concern but not despair. Not fear. Miriam was all right.
He felt a terrible bad taste in his mouth, he thought, staring at his feet.
“I’m trying to stop him, don’t you see? I want you-- I couldn’t protect her, and I’ll fucking die before--”
“Sorry, Mr. Iida, I’ll keep it down!” he shouted back, voice as unaffected as possible as the scalding water reddened his hands.
“Potter,” Draco said, letting out a breath, and the hope was gone. “You live in a lovely dream world, you and Granger and the- Weasley, but the rest of the world disagrees. As they bloody well should. Now please, and I am actually dangerously close to begging you, do us all a favor and forget my existence entirely. Send a man to pick the order up when it’s done, Potter.” Draco stormed back in, slamming the door. Miriam looked up darkly as Mr. Iida shouted reprimands in from the storefront.
“Cock. Well thanks for the heads up, love, I’ll go in a bit early.” Draco heard a deep voice cough on the other end, and his stomach dropped. Miriam must have sensed his feelings over the phone, going silent for a moment.
“You can pay me for that at the party. Now you have to come, yeah? Otherwise
Draco woke up the next morning wishing he’d drank enough to black out the night before, Potter’s words ash in his already chalky mouth. They’d run through his dreams, mocking him on the wings of blackened snitches.
I led him to my bed and cuddled him. When he finally calmed down I examined the large hand-shaped bruise on his face.
"Nowhere," he mumbled while looking at the floor.
"That is impossible," James shouted in rage, "No Alpha is stronger than my boys. It is simply impossible."
"I'm 39 Alpha," Harry said clearly he was trying to say more but I didn't get it.
I was about to say something but couldn't get words out when I felt lips against mine. They were rough and gentle at the same time and it took me a minute to realize that I was having my first kiss. I then slowly started to participate as he continued to kiss me slowly. He pulled away for a second to take a breath before kissing me again with a little more force.
"Why?" my mother asked getting out of her seat.
"Its just from the constant sex he has. Really Harry is disgusting," my mother said sneering and clearly pissed off.
"I love you," I whispered from where my head was laid against his chest.
Feeling enraged I stormed to my parents room. I saw only my fake mother there and felt more anger than I could ever imagine. I stepped forward feeling and smashed a vase startling him. A look of fear filled his eyes as I attacked him with the large broken peices of glass. Not feeling my anger satisfied I went to find my father.
"Oh this disgrace is Hadrian," Lily said with a sneer, "He needs to lose some weight before we can find him a proper Alpha." The way she spoke of him was sickening. They acted like he was an object, not a beautiful being.
Omega always cleans and cooks and tolerates the brats. Lately the idea of a baby with Omega doesn't seem as bad. At least Omega unlike Astoria wont beg mr to take time off and will do all the gross stuff. I'll just have to do the fun stuff. My only current concern is that he will let himself go after a baby. Omega is very pretty and has a beautifully curvaceous body although he's gained a bit of weight.
My last pregnancy ended in a nasty infection which is why Draco had the surgery done. Ever since my immune system has been very weak. I keep getting sick and sometimes I wonder if maybe I'll die from a disease instead of Draco, although I'm not sure which I would prefer.
You may or may not know what the one topic is, but I'll tell you either way. Ever since I was just a little Omega I have wanted have a baby, but Draco always says no. I'm 39 years old now and having a baby could now both be dangerous to me and my baby. I gave up on ever having a baby of my own years ago. The last time I asked Draco about having a baby he got extremely upset with me and ranted about how I didn't love the twins, but I do.
The day was finally at its end and I was getting changed. I grabbed one of Draco's hoodies and slipped it on. Draco was already laying in bed with just his boxers on with a book in hand. I climbed into bed and snuggled into his side and closed my eyes as he read.
I crawled into bed and got as comfortable as possible I was barely allowed to eat anything and my stomach feels like it's gonna shrivel up and die. It felt like a million kittens sinking their claws into your bare skin except inside my body. I should really find the kitchen in this place before I die. With determination, I crawled out of bed and slipped on some slippers. As quietly as possible I snuck out of the rooms and into the hall. From there I had no clue where I was going. Our rooms were on the fifth floor and I assumed that the kitchens would be closer to the great hall.
"Whatever go wake up the Omega," my father said and I scrambled back into bed. I pretended to sleep scared of what she will do If I am out of bed already. When she came in I heard her shrilling voice telling me to wake up before she pulled me out of bed with my hair.
My father apparated us outside the gates of Hogwarts and led us in. It was morning so everyone was in the halls as we walked by. I felt uncomfortable with the number of stares my neck and ass received. Eventually, we made it to the headmaster's office and entered. Inside was also three blonds two male Alphas a female Omega. One Alpha looked about my age and was extremely attractive. He was 6'6 and extremely well-muscled. I could feel his gray eyes on me as me and my parents seated but looked forward the entire time.
The next morning Draco stormed into the room startling me from my sleep. He didn't even let me get dressed he just wrapped a thin sheet around me. My body was in extreme pain as he threw me over his shoulder and carried me to the court room. Unlucky for me the entire court was assembled as he threw me on the floor causing the sheet to fall off my body.
Harry's POV
"He'll have to come with us," he said after a moment of thought.
Draco came home to see his perfect house not looking perfect. Upon further inspection he found his wife sleeping. Feeling a rage take over he grabbed a through pillow and began suffocating his Omega. Once done Draco brought the body outside and began dissecting the small body of his Harry.
Draco's POV
"Get me some whiskey," Draco commanded and I went to the cabinet of alchohol. I grabbed a bottle of his favorite whiskey and a crystal cup. I poured hima glass before giving it to him and waiting to see if he wanted me to do anything else.
Draco and I have been married for seven years now after dating for a year and a half. Draco is a tall attractive Alpha that any Omega would be lucky to have. Being owned and pleasing Draco are the reasons I exist and any Omega would die to be in my place. Draco and I have only ever fought over one thing. The one thing I have always wanted, however Draco is the boss and he said no and that means no.
"You can eat," my mother said sharply, "but none of that. You are getting fat so you will have salad and that is all. When you lose all that extra weight then you can eat other things again." When she finished talking she set a bowl of salad in front of me and I had to fight the tears threatening to fall.
------------♠♣♥♦
"Draco," I said softly to get his attention as I walked towards him after closing the door behind me.
When dinner was over I went to my dorm. It was clear that I needed a plan to talk to the Omega. If he is being forced to act and dress a certain way and he makes a statement under a truth serum then he will be emancipated. The only problem is that he was most likely never informed of this. My mission is now not only to make him mine but to also make sure he is being treated rightfully.
Draco's POV
Draco pulled me off the floor and wrapped his large hands around my neck. I tried to pry his hands off me but he wouldn't loosen his grip. My vision became blurry and I couldn't breathe. If he hadn't dropped me I probably would have died on the day that was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, although maybe that would have been better. I tried to catch my breath, but he didn't give me a chance before he picked me up by the waist. He threw me on the bed and brutally assaulted me.
"Father is it true?" Jamie said. "Was I the one supposed to marry Lord Malfoy?"
"Maybe you should see a healer?" he suggested to which I agreed by nodding my head weakly. "Alright let's get you in bed and I'll call the healer."
Thank you," he said with his beautiful smile. "I love you Alpha."
"Well, where were you then?" I asked again this time a little louder.
"Where's my baby?" I asked again as tears threatened to fall.
"Well is there anything we can help you with?" my mother asked.
He made a deal with my father for Draco to marry Jamie, but he didn't tell. Us my father told us he wanted to marry me the older but less pretty twin. I was so happy that an Alpha wanted me, because Jamie always caught the attention of all the Alphas.
Once fully awake I made sure to fix my makeup and clothes. I then put together a lasagna that could be put in the over as soon as I hear Draco's garage door opening.
"If Lord Malfoy is willing I demand to become his second wife," Jamie said standing up.
"I was to marry Jamie why was this hideous creature under the veil," Draco yelled as I tried to cover myself from the eyes of my father, the court, and Jamie the one who was supposed to get married.
At 3:02 I heard Ida and Adaline's garage door open informing me that they are home from school. Both girls came in as well as an Alpha boy, two Omega boys, three Omega girls, and one male Beta.
"Yes," I heard the healer say before she was in my sight. She had her wand and cast a spell over me, "Tu Virginem!"
"I um was just uh looking for the kitchen," I stuttered unsurely.
"Welcome home Alpha," I said going over to help take off his jacket.
"Why can't I eat anything?" I asked slightly frustrated.
"In Gryffindor it is illegal to marry off your youngest before the older," my father said casually as I sobbed. My mother got up from where she sat and ran over to me.
It's been two weeks and I finally have everything planned for the case against Harry's parents. I have left Harry out of most of it because he doesn't need all the stress. He is too precious to deal with political issues. All he needs to do is tell the court what his parents did then he will go home with my parents. He has met my parents before and my mother fell in love with him immediately. And after the trial, we can finally be public with our relationship.
"Why?" I asked confused as to why we need to take the slut to Poppy.
"Nowhere you need to be looking," I said confusing him more. He just stared at me for a minute before it clicked.
I climbed out of bed and snuck to the room of requirements where we agreed to meet. The door was already in sight meaning Draco already prepared a room. With a big smile, I walked into the room to see Draco reading a book on a couch in front of a fire. The room was just a big comfortable living room which is perfect.
"Yes, I have one month to gain his trust and I hope during this time he will fall for me," I explained.
"I just needed to go for a walk," he sobbed. He slid down the wall and hugged his knees like a pathetic little baby.
Around 4:45 I heard Draco's garage door open so I quickly put the lasagna in the over knowing it would be ready in 45 minutes which was the amount of time draco took to shower and change. Soon Draco was walking into the house with all his grace kicking off his shoes.
"Are you happy?" it was simple but I knew that the answer would help greatly.
"You look beautiful Harry," my mother said and pulled him into a hug.
"No, no, no," I said repeatedly as I began crying harder and harder.
The next morning I was awoken by the yelling of my parents. It was odd since they never fight. I snuck up to my door and leaned against it so I could easily eavesdrop.
"Are you insane!" my mother screamed. "He clearly beat your brother, and you want to marry this man. Who knows what else he has done to my baby!"
"Bye dad bye mum," Abraxas yelled as he ran to the train instead of even looking at us.
Draco's POV
"He got the letter about the trial and blew up. He then hit me and I ran to you," he explained still very upset.
Third Person Pov🌻
We arrived and saw my parents who we rushed over to.
"And why'd you do that?" James yelled now awake and raging.
This year Abraxas will be a third-year and Scorpius will be the first year. We were currently getting ready to go to the station but Flora was throwing a tantrum. Delilah who is six was fighting with Bree who was seven none stop. And both Abraxas and Scorpius couldn't find all their stuff. The day was just getting worse and Harry was feeling awful since he started his period yesterday.
At the time I thought having a baby would be a good thing. At least I would have something to distract me from the pain and someone would love me. It was also plus that although Draco still came into my room he wasn't as brutal in fear of hurting the baby. Everything was okay until Jamie became jealous and decided he want to have a baby as well. Jamie however was proven to be infertile. When I found out I didn't care much although at the time I didn't know his inability to have children would affect me so much.
Looking in I saw a small, naked figure covered in blood. He was laying on his side and was coughing up blood.
Draco's Pov🍂
"Yes well we need to do better," my mother shrieked, "We'll need to put more makeup on him. He will also need some more black dresses to hide all the fat he has."
From that night i ended up pregnant once again. I tried so hard not to bond with my baby, but it didn't work and my second sweet baby was taken from me before I could even touch her. It seemed my life went on a constant repeat from there. I've given birth to eight children and all of them thin Jamie is there mother. I'd probably be pregnant now if it weren't for the fact Draco had surgery done on me so I could no longer have kids.
The night of the wedding came and I thought maybe I would be left alone, but I wasn't. Draco spent the night with Jamie and sent some of the men in his army to assault me as he does.
"What is it?" I question sitting up slightly.
I was given a five-minute break before she was bringing a dress in and forcing me in it. The dress was nude with silver. It was a long sleeve and off the shoulders and according to her it was conservative but still showed off my neck where a mating bit will one day be. She struggled to zip it which isn't surprising since she most likely had it made a size too small. When she deemed me ready I was being pulled out of my room downstairs to where my father was waiting.
I looked around and saw a tiny leather bound book hidden. While no one was looking I picked it up than snuck out of the room. Once in the safety of my room I read it and was horrified and sick. It seemed impossible that my dad was a rapist and my mother just a shitty person. My siblings and I aren't even my mothers children we're just products of our biological mothers rape.
When I looked at Harry his eyes were glossy. He submissively kept his head down not saying a word. His response made it clear that this wasn't the first time he was publicly shamed because of his weight. He wasn't fat or anything just not a stick like most. He had curves and meat on his bones making him even more beautiful than an average stick.
You see I'm Draco's second wife, not first. He was married to Astoria Greengrass, however she committed su6a year before Draco and I got together. At the time he already had the twins Adaline Narcissa and Ida Grace Malfoy. Both are beautiful Alpha girls who look just like there father, and although I love them like my own they aren't a fan of me. Sadly Draco is blinded by his love for them and ignores when they aren't very nice.
Harry's POV
People seem to ignore my existence and the horrible things he's done to me. Everything has been taken from me and no one cares. They act like I'm not human, like I don't have feelings, and I don't feel pain but I do. I feel everything he does to me and it hurts so bad. I know that someday he will get too angry and go to far and kill me. I'm just hoping that maybe if I write my side of the story someone will find it when I'm gone and miss me.
"Happy to see you," I responded as I snuggled into his side.
"He is not he has chub all over him," Lily said defensively as if defending her own body and not her sons.
"Where's my baby?" I mumbled sleepily while reaching out for my baby. I repeated the question over and over as the minutes passed and the baby I could here screaming wasn't in my arms. I began looking around as much as I could from where I lay. I looked to the side to see Jamie sitting beautifully in the hospital bed, holding my baby.
"Shush bitch," Ida said as they headed towards the door. "You just close your pretty little mouth until Daddy comes home and wants you to sick him off." Already used to there treatment I just kept my mouth shut while they went upstairs. It took me almost a half hour before the mess was fully picked up again.
"What do you mean the Omega is beautiful?" my Mother questioned looking the beauty up and down.
I know my death is approaching, and maybe with this I'll be remembered or even humanized.
My parents started talking about their own thing when a barn owl came flying through our owl door (don't question it). A letter with the Hogwarts seal dropped in front of my dad and he opened it. He was quickly out of his seat and scribbling a reply to whatever had come.
"We are going to Hogwarts tomorrow," he said in a voice close to his Alpha voice making me flinch.
"I feel all Omega should leave the room before continuing," Dumbledore stated rudely while sending the little beauty a look of dislike.
"I promise, I just went for a walk," he tried to argue when James came to drag him to the hospital wing.
"Yeah," I said with a shaky breath, "Just be gentle please."
Rain poured down as I walked through the halls of our manor. Whenever it rains I have a problem with sleeping. Anytime I brought it up my mother would smile and say it was raining when I was born. As I walked down the hall I heard talking from my father's office. The door was cracked so I snuck up and looked in to see my mother and father.
"M-my dad h-h-i-i-i-t me," he answered and began crying again.
He was shocked to find a barely developed baby now dead in his lover's womb. This realization snapped him out of the rage and caused him to break down in tears. Feeling the guilt of killing his baby hurt him so bad that he slit his own throat and collapsed onto his brainwashed creature. The person he changed from an exciting adventuresome Omega to a submissive bitch. It seems Draco and Harry didn't get a happily ever after.
"Why do you need a candle?" he asked once I had my candy. The candle was on the coffee table and he was lighting it when he asked.
"He got an infection after giving birth to Annalise. Although, maybe he should just die. He's given us eight children, and is honestly a little loose. Sex isn't as good anymore," my dad complained causing me to fall more into confusion. If my hearing was correct than my mother didn't birth my youngest sibling.
It has been a week since we arrived at Hogwarts, and I think my death is soon approaching. Half the time I have a headache because most Alphas don't seem to know how to suppress their sent.  Also, my mother keeps trying to show me off to high-class Alphas which is super uncomfortable. I have also been feeling nauseous. because all I am allowed to eat is leaves. When I say I might die I'm not over exaggerating.
"You look adorable," he said with a smile as I approached him. When I reached him he leaned down and kissed my cheek making me blush.
"Poppy is there s spell to make sure he wasn't being slutty?" I heard my father ask making my heartbreak knowing that all I am is an object. All I am since I was born is a way to earn them money. I have tried to do as I was told and not be bad, but it can be hard sometimes. All the rules all the lies get heavy and you feel yourself breaking like glass.
Draco's POV
I reached for some steak that my mother had made but she smacked my hand away hard enough to leave a red mark. I next reached for some mashed potatoes but my mother smacked my hand away. In one last attempt to get anything to eat I reached for a roll and this time my father smacked my hand away.
"I can show you where they are if you'd like," he said looking down at me.
(Make sure to read the warnings in the description before reading)
I tried fighting unconsciousness as I began crying as I heard Draco say Jamie did a good job. He was treating Jamie like I should have been and acting like he gave birth not me. Eventually I lost the fight and fell asleep with tears running down my face.
My thoughts were distracted by Omega stepping out of the bathroom and going around to his side of the bed. He crawled into bed and curled up on his side of the bed knowing I wouldn't want to cuddle, he is so well trained. I mentally sighed before going over to him and wrapping my arms around his tiny body.
Harry's POV
I woke up at midnight from James' loud snoring and crawled out of bed. I went to go check on the Omega bitch only to see he wasn't in bed. I screamed in anger before composing myself. Normally when I wake up in the middle of the night I go find someone who knows how to fuck, unlike James, but today I will wait and punish the little whore.
"Please kill me," he begged breaking my heart. I tried to deny him, but he begged and cried.
Draco's Pov
It's been a month since Draco proposed and we are now getting married. Thanks to Draco's parents we were able to get a wedding planner quickly. I was in my and Draco's room as Narcissa helped me get dressed in my wedding dress. Only Draco's family and a few friends were invited keeping the wedding small. We didn't want anything big and wanted to get married as soon as possible.
"Why is that?" I asked not showing any specific emotion.
I told Draco what happened and he just held me while I cried. It's been a week since then and he has made me happier than ever. We have been more careful when sneaking out and I haven't been caught again. Draco has already proved himself in so many ways and has made me fall for him. He is so respectful and treats me like a person. He makes sure I get something to eat every day and makes me smile. I can't remember a time I have ever been happier than I am now.
"Thank you," he said with a smile, "Would you like to take a walk with me?"
As soon as I made sure my little Omega was back in his room safely I wrote to my parents.
"I will contact my parents and have it set up as soon as possible," he whispered and kissed my forehead and pulling me closer to him.
This time of the year is always the loneliest. My oldest brothers Jamie and Derek are moved out and my other two brothers, who are twins, Kaden and Jaden are in their seventh year at Hogwarts. I wasn't allowed to go to Hogwarts since I'm an Omega which isn't fair since all the other Omegas still get to go. Most of my time is spent alone since my dad works and my mum is either teaching me or subtly telling me all I'll ever be good at is being an Alpha's sex toy and carrying some rich man's heir.
"Of course," I answered and flung myself at him. He smiled and took the ring out of the box and slipped it on my finger. I looked at it and smiled. He really does spoil me that is for sure.
LINE BREAK
It has been three months since Draco has become dedicated to getting me pregnant and I don't think I've ever been so tired. I was currently laying on the couch even though I have so much to do. I just need a bit of sleep.
I walked through the halls when I walked by a room and heard intense coughing. I knocked on the door and when I didnt get an answer I opened the door.
Harry's Pov🍁
tHIS STORY HAS COME TO AN END.
"Shhh baby breath," he said and began kissing my neck. "It'll be okay just tell me when I can move."
I then moved onto the upstairs and began cleaning bedrooms, bathrooms, the library, and closets. While I was cleaning Adaline's bedroom I found some very inappropriate pictures of naked Omegas. Feeling a little disgusted I just left then where they were. I would talk to Draco about it later and he would decide what to do.
"Watch your mouth you snake," Lily snapped at my Father her face matching her ugly hair. It seemed impossible that such a beautiful Omega could come from such ugly people.
"You alright baby?" he asked as he got closer to me and pulled back my hair.
I started wandering around trying to find the kitchen. I felt weak from my lack of food lately and had to take a break a couple of times. While walking through the entrance hall I ran into a large body mass. I almost fell on impact put whoever I ran into steadied me. I looked up and saw it was the Alpha from the headmaster's office. Seeing him up close made me aware of how attractive he was. He had stormy grey eyes and neat blonde hair. It was clear that he was well-muscled. His complete hotness made me blush.
"Of course I will," Harry answered and kissed him on the cheek before he also went to the train. As soon as it pulled out of the station tears began to form in my beautiful Omega's green eyes. Flora seeing this wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and gave him a wet kiss on his cheek making him giggle.
When he looked up I smiled at him before continuing my journey. When I got to town I went to the Three Broomsticks and went to my family's private room. Once inside I took out my two-way mirror so I could contact my parents and tell them to come and meet me. I tapped the screen and soon my mother's face appeared.
While his lips were on mine I ended up laying on my back with him over me. He was holding up his much bigger body with his forearms and continued to kiss me pulling away every once in a while to take a breath. I felt one of his hands run down my side and rest on my hip making me panic. I panicked more when I felt something hard poking my leg.  He sensed it quickly and pulled away and rested his forehead against mine.
"The little Bitch snuck out," I explained and looked over to Hadrian. He was shaking and hugging himself and clearly crying. Honestly, he is so weak. He can't take the truth.
After breakfast, I locked myself in my room and changed into a fluffy onesie. I crawled into bed and cried. I cried because I felt like an object. I cried because I felt used. I cried because I felt sick from not eating. I cried because of the insults. I cried because of the stares. I cried and cried until I finally fell into a dreamless sleep because of emotion and because of how weak my body is
"Get dressed quickly so we have time to make you look decent" she snarled before dropping me on the floor and leaving the room. I sighed and did as I was told just hoping I would see Draco again soon.
Harry's POV
The pain was excruciating as I pushed my baby boy out of my body. At the time I thought it was odd that Jamie was laying in the hospital bed beside me. I had ignored it in favor of focusing on delivering my pride and joy.  By the time he was born I could barely stay awake, but I wanted to hold my baby before I fell asleep.
🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
"Will you write me?"  Scorpius asked.
"Yeah," I whispered as he walked away. I rushed into my room and flopped on my bed. I had a smile glued to my face. An Alpha actually wanted to get to know me. Other than my brothers I have never been so close to an Alpha and it was nerve-wracking and exciting all in one.
“Harry sent a message. There are Ministry officials on their way now, undercover. They have no magic, yes? They aren’t even Squibs?”
“I don’t know what the
“Look, it doesn’t matter. I can promise you on my mother’s grave I’m not here to ruin his life, or sabotage anything, or-- I just needed-- fuck, you know what, I don’t know why I’m here, actually. I just wanted to see. There’s been absolutely no news of him, not a single peep since we left school. Not a sighting, or a chat-- and we,” Harry struggled to find the words that would make sense. “We experienced tragedy together. We were a small school. It matters where we end up. Seeing him here was an utter surprise.”
“I said, coffee or tea. Preference?” She crossed her arms. Harry felt lost.
“My father was sentenced to death for our crimes, in a prison that stinks like putrid meat where he got his soul sucked out. The only reason my mother and I weren’t was because we were cowards at just the right moment. Well, I was, anyway. My mother saved us all.”
“Miriam, my dear girl, I’ve heard so much about you. I’m so sorry we had to meet like this,” Narcissa said smoothly, sweeping past her son to embrace his friend. Miriam hugged his mother out of reflex, and found herself seated on the settee-- hang on, was that there--and Narcissa looked at Harry meaningfully.
“You wouldn’t fancy a pint, would you?” She smiled, and suddenly Draco noticed it didn’t reach her eyes.
“Miriam, if the salt and moisture ruins that chocolate, the replacement is coming out of your own paycheque. Get lunch and temper it after you’ve come back with yourself under control.”
Ron Weasley shook his head.
Miriam was in anything but an oasis when he arrived, banging things around in the kitchen. Her eyes softened a little when she saw him, but merely rolled her eyes and pointed to the worksheet on the desk.
Draco raised an eyebrow. Plenty of important people-- movie stars, government officials, professional athletes-- all of them had to eat, and everyone knew that the tiny bright haven of Iida was the best place to source it.
“That was just the beginning, honestly. My--uncle, really, he killed the headmaster so I wouldn’t have to. I stayed to infiltrate the school, came home on breaks to watch more torture and plan more killings, and listen to my professor scream for help and watch her get eaten alive by a giant snake."
“Oh, for fuck’s sake Miriam, just eat the bloody thing.” Draco snapped without bite. She rolled her eyes.
“You do realize I’m being very magnanimous by not asking you questions about this whole bollocking business, yeah? Just so we’re clear.”
“You’re only hurting yourself, you know,” she said, cleaning up his drink despite his feeble protests.
It wasn’t until Saturday that he realized it had all been a ruse, laughing his way into Miriam’s kitchen listening to her cousin’s elaborate story.
“While I quite understand your desire to discuss at this time, my dear, I think it’s prudent to wait for any more meaningful discussions until after your Healer arrives, which should be any minute now. Before he arrives, I would like to alert the authorities. I have already heard Draco, but I would like to know if you noticed anything extraordinary? Or strange? Have you been followed by anyone? I know it’s quite hard to collect oneself in these situations, but the more you remember now the better action we can take. If you don’t mind, I’d like to hear what happened right before...” Narcissa said, and Miriam nodded.
The rest of the week passed by in relative quiet compared to the excitement of the past few days. Even his day off (which he wouldn’t have bothered taking except for Miriam’s insistence) was dull, ignoring his coworker’s suggestive eyebrow wag for the comfort of his house and a cuppa. All was boring, mundane, repetitious.
. Turn. Butter. Fold. Screams. Turn. Next. Butter. Fold.
The air was gone.
“Trust me, Miriam, that’s how they’re
“With the money from this contract, we can keep the shop open full time with the two of us and give you the pay rise you deserve as head baker. So we’re doing it. Fuck. They just want this stupid, ridiculous, Pasty. Who would want a pasty.”
