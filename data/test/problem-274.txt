"Maybe you're right." Harry considered, "Maybe I should break up with her..." He wondered why he'd never had this thought before. Did it really make sense to be with someone he didn't like?
"It's not just now. I never really got over my parents' rejection, babe." Draco sighed. "I've been hurting about it, mostly when I was alone."
"Accio lube." he panted. When the bottle flew straight in his hands, he opened the lid and poured the lubricant onto a finger and began to thrust it into Draco's entrance.
When the Slytherin girl bent down to pick up something she'd apparently dropped, Hermione wondered if that had been her wand.
When the two girlfriends saw Ron and Hermione again, they screamed of joy and almost tackled them to the ground.
Although he was always under Ron or Hermione's watch, when they were in class, though, they couldn't exactly know what he was doing.
And Draco knew that he was serious. This was the moment in which he had to choose between his family and his boyfriend. He took a long breath, then he spoke, "Do it, if you dare. You always wanted me to turn into you, but I will tell you... I am NOT willing to do that. I am gay and in love with Harry." As Draco finished talking, he took Harry's hand in his own.
He had never thought, in the past, that he would ever be able to help someone in the process of being themselves. Yet, he had just participated in a couple's coming out. A new feeling invaded him, it was the idea of being a good person. And it was all because of the boy sitting next to him, his fiancé.
"I hope the new one is a beautiful snowflake who hates Nargles." Luna said , crossing her fingers. She still had her lion hat on.
"Don't have to tell me twice!" Harry said as he walked away. He managed to wink at Draco and mouth him a 'see you later' .
The two of them were dancing almost as badly as Ron and Hermione, but at least they had a sense of rhythm. Draco had a hand on Harry's waist , the other one was entwined with the other boy's. Harry gripped his shoulder firmly, even though, often times, it would slide down his arm, due to the sweat.
"I-" she tried to say, but the Headmistress intervened. "Miss Weasley," she said sternly. "and Miss Parkinson, the price you will pay for your misconduct consists in the removal of 50 points each. Nevertheless, sending unauthorized material to the Daily Prophet is considered a felony, therefore you should both be expelled, but we will have the time to discuss the matter with your parents."
When they reached the Stadium, a witch muttered something in French, showing them the way to their VIP seats.
"Who is that man? What is he doing here, Hermione? Does he know that this is home invasion?" Hermione's dad said, angry, as he got and from his chair and walked to the intruder.
She also helped her with her hair situation. Luckily, Molly had brought her straightening potion, so it wasn't too much of a nightmare.
And Draco didn't really feel like getting his boyfriend into trouble, so his idea consisted in avoiding the subject.
The carpet, this time, was red and there were no balloons; the whole of the tent was adorned with flowers, some vases were attached to its ceiling and descended in a cascade of white.
"No, Lucius." Harry intervened. "You should be ashamed... I shouldn't have spoken in your favor at your trial, I should have let you rot in Azkaban!"
Lucius slowly took his son away from his mother's grasp and smiled through his tears upon carrying him in his arms. "Hello, Draco." He whispered. Rocking him slightly, Lucius managed to soothe the baby. He stopped crying, he only moved his head around slightly, fluttering his tiny eyes open and closed.
A few days later, back in Hogwarts, Luna and Hermione threw Harry and Draco an engagement party, which they hosted in the Room of Requirement, inviting students from all houses.
By the looks of it, it must have been an office. There was a desk filled with quills, books and semi-opened ink bottles.
"I am sure that I am going to cry." said Luna. "I always cry at weddings. But in this one I will cry more because I will imagine my girlfriend as the bride and me as the groom but as another bride." she smiled as she shrugged her shoulders.
"Oh Merlin, what if I am pregnant, too? I haven't had my period in a while." The Ravenclaw voiced her concerns.
She felt a bit weird while digging her fork in her ration, as everyone was looking at her with held breaths.
How could he be so damn pestering? It was too late for him to be awake, anyway, since he had to wake up at 5 or so, as he had been doing those past days.
Harry wasn't exactly convinced with her behaviour. Narcissa Malfoy going to a semi-muggle wedding? Making this effort for Draco?
"Thank you! Today is my birthday, you've just made it unforgettable!" Ginny squealed, trying to keep her tears from falling, but to no avail.
"Good evening everyone!" He started, adjusting his glasses on his nose. "I've known these two for almost eight years and I can tell you that they were marvelous Quidditch players!"
"Oh, wow!"said Harry, happy as ever. It was about time George could have something so beautiful and positive happen in his life since his twin brother's death.
"That garçon is worse than Draco was years ago!" Hermione grumbled. "Sorry, Draco, but you were an insufferable git."
"Oh, come on, honey bee, it was still a great match- my favourite part was when the seeker flew in that way you taught me!" Luna chirped.
The six friends spent the rest of their afternoon laughing and chattering happily, excited about the new couple, momentarily forgetting about the insufferable Jean Jaques Germain.
Draco stood there, awkwardly. He watched as the woman planted a kiss on Harry's head, they looked so cute it made him a little sad. He wonder if he would ever be this adorable with his mother again.
When Luna finished speaking, both girls were in tears. "I love you too!" Ginny said, then she took her girlfriend's face and pressed their lips together.
His father's face suggested shock. He couldn't believe what his son had just said to him. He never thought that he could ever speak to him in such manner, it seemed.
"Harry? Are you ok, mate?" he asked. "Are you afraid you will make a fool of yourself? I mean, look at my sister!" He then pointed to where Luna and Ginny were, spinning around like fools.
"Wow, Draco, Harry consumed my ears with his wailing! 'I miss Draco this, I miss Draco that'" Ron said teasingly, sipping his drink.
"I'm so, so nervous." Draco muttered to his boyfriend as they were walking towards the Great Hall for Breakfast.
He watched as a tall guy walked in awkwardly, he was holding a black trunk in one hand, while he had a small flask in the other. Its label said "magical maladies remedy", it looked like it came straight from Saint Mungo's.
In the meantime, a determined Ginny Weasley was running to the dungeons, aimed at the Slytherin common room. She looked around for a bit until she found her person of interest. "Parkinson, wait up!"
It was a honeymoon suite, but Ginny didn't reveal which couple would have slept there on their first night as spouses.
It brought the newly engaged back to their first date, since the place was decorated with Gryffindor and Slytherin flags, although it was also peppered with banners saying 'Congratulations Harry and Draco'.
Things were going great for the new couple lately, though there was one particular they couldn't ignore: They couldn't be public about their relationship.
"Hey," said his boyfriend, squeezing his shoulder lightly. " I know it hurts but, with time, you will realise that 'family' isn't always blood-related.For I am your family now. We all are."
There had been a misunderstanding, freaking Jean Jacques had formed a friendship with him just to forcefully kiss him in front of Harry when he had the chance.
Ron and the rest of Harry's roommates, together with Hermione, had spent the night in the Common Room, too drunk to reach their beds.
"Well, as we both know, on Saturday, my friends George and Angelina are getting married- I mean, of course you know, since you're officiating it- and I'm planning something special for that day" He said, all in one breath.
"Oh, you don't know how honoured I consider myself for that, girl." Gwenog said, sighing contentedly.
Her husband was holding her hand, as he had been during the whole delivery process, while her newborn was in the hands of the midwife, who was washing him.
"Oh, no, he's not here now - he's gone into the kitchen to inform the elves that he can only eat some foods, as he has a weird magical sickness. In fact, he's always carrying around a vial of medicine." Draco explained.
"Harry, Draco!" said a puffing Hermione, she had just arrived there after an extenuating race up the moving stairs. Ron was there with her, too.
Hermione slapped him across the face so hard that her hand print exceeded the redness of the blushing.
"So, you two are a thing?" Neville asked when Harry and Draco sat in front of him. He wasn't afraid of the latter anymore, it seemed.
Well, she was never wrong, after all, but she wondered, had she been right, if that would be the right thing to do.
"What is going on here?" said Headmistress McGonagall, as she had heard the 'expelliarmus' from minutes before. "Are you dueling in the Great Hall?" She was quite angry, but she stopped her scolding as soon as she saw what had just happened.
“Oh alright,” Harry said and scooped the baby up into his arms, wrapping a blanket around the both of them as he stepped out the door.
Over time, he told her about the war, and the events leading up to it. They filled in the gaps in each other’s memories and knowledge. Harry talked about things he didn’t discuss even with his friends, and Narcissa revealed things about her family that she normally held close to the vest. It was an odd relationship, but it worked. For some reason, they were exactly what the other needed.
“There’s nothing to indicate that anyone has ever actually been in possession of all three,” Hermione said, “so there’s nothing for us to go on with this. No one knows what it means to be-” She stopped herself short, seemingly unwilling to actually say it out loud.
His mind immediately wandered straight back to Malfoy. After he’d cast his spell, it was like Harry could feel him, like he could see inside Malfoy and Malfoy could see him too. He’d wanted more, and had enveloped Malfoy even further, reacting on instinct when Malfoy swayed, unsteady. Once they were that close, it was like something else took over, and he wanted to feel and to show Malfoy what it meant. The kiss had been good - more than good really, and Malfoy had responded enthusiastically, but there was no way it could be that simple. He’d kissed his childhood rival, his (former?) enemy, the one person in the world that might be able to understand Harry, and then he’d practically run away. So much for Gryffindor bravery.
“No, you’re not,” she said gently. “It’s okay to not be okay.” She pulled back, her hands still gripping his arms. “And you can always talk to me about it.”
“I’d best be going,” he said. “I’m sure they’re wondering where you’ve gone.” He gestured at the house while starting to turn away. “Owl me if there’s a problem with the potion.”
“Yeah, er, hold on.” He had to shift Teddy around in order to get to the pocket where he kept his money pouch, and the baby looked up curiously at the stranger before him. Malfoy looked back.
If he was being honest, Harry really wasn’t sure that it was, but he didn’t want to steal hope away from the Malfoys. “I don’t know,” he finally said, “but I’m hopeful. I have friends who don’t treat me any differently. Perhaps other people can see it too.”
“If you don’t use it, and it’s hidden somewhere safe, then you may be successful.” She was leaning towards him, and she hesitated. “If you are the final possessor of all three objects -” she trailed off, and Harry met her gaze.
They both paused and looked at each other. When he looked at her, he didn’t feel the same as he used to. He looked at her and knew he’d always love her, that she would always be important to him, but it wasn’t what it used to be. She finally stepped forward and pulled him into a hug. “How are you?” she asked.
Harry, Teddy, and Andromeda spent the morning together while Teddy tried out all his new toys, including the broom that Harry explained was full of protective charms, like Cushioning charms for falls and run-ins and Stabilizing charms to keep him in the air. Unfortunately, the Cushioning charms protected the child but not Andromeda’s cabinet of fine china. Harry sheepishly Reparo’d the dishes while Andromeda assured him that they were Black heirlooms and hardly her most prized possessions.
“Because of your last letter. Because you want the world to see you as just another person, and because you want the same for my son. Do you really think it’s possible?”
That was easier said than done, Harry realized when he awoke the next morning, after having moved to his bed, with a hard on and a head full of Malfoy. It was still early, judging by the soft blue light slowly stealing through the curtains, so he reached under the band of his sweats and pants and loosely stroked himself, dream-pleasure already taking him halfway there. Against his (crumbling) will, images of blond hair and well-tailored trousers and the feel of Malfoy’s lips beneath his filled his mind until he was coming, back arching as he spilled over his hand. He came back down slowly, eventually coming to his senses enough to think, I am so fucked.
“Pansy and her parents have left England. As for Blaise Zabini, he’s done his best to distance himself from anyone with ties to Death Eaters.”
Harry watched Malfoy start to walk down the path towards the apparition point. “Happy Christmas, Malfoy,” he called. Malfoy paused, his head turning just slightly. He didn’t say anything, though, and kept walking. Teddy tucked himself back into Harry, hair black and nose cold against Harry’s neck. “Alright, kiddo, let’s get inside.”
He wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, and he felt silly being invisible in his otherwise empty home, but he hoped that by using one of the Hallows he might be able to trigger the dreams. The Stone was lost to the forest and the wand was equally inaccessible, so this family heirloom was all that remained to him. After a few minutes, the absurdity of standing invisible in the middle of his bedroom was too much, so he pulled the cloak off, carefully folded it back up, and tucked it back into the trunk. The potion was starting to take effect now too, so he waved his hand to turn out the lights and slipped into bed.
“You never Owled about the cost. And you said it would take time - have you been working on it all day? It’s Christmas.”
“I’ll come watch a game soon, yeah? Promise.” He felt guilty that he hadn’t, but he hadn’t gone back to Hogwarts at all yet, not even to see Hagrid. He just wasn’t ready yet.
“His mother was my cousin,” Malfoy said, and Harry stared - that wasn’t the reaction he’d been expecting. Still, he nodded in response. “You’re not raising him?” Harry shook his head.
Well, it's been a minute. I don't have a lot of writing motivation but here's some more. I actually have more of this written, and I'm getting to the part that I'm excited about so I'll probably be posting again soon.
Harry and Narcissa fell into a routine of meeting every week at the same Muggle shop. In addition to seeing Teddy, it was one of the few things he actually had to look forward to in his life. Ron spent more time at Grimmauld Place with Hermione gone, though they kept up a steady correspondence. Harry had a feeling that some of that correspondence was about him, but he didn’t mind so much. It was difficult to keep his weekly visits from Ron, but he wasn’t ready to explain something he didn’t fully understand himself.
Just after noon, they gathered up all their remaining presents and wrangled Teddy into his clothes and Andromeda wrapped up a dish of treacle tart and together they managed to transport the whole affair over to the Burrow. Harry offered to bring the dessert into the kitchen, as he could already hear the bangs and clangs of Mrs. Weasley cooking enough food to feed an army (they had all been soldiers in the not-so-distant past so it was fitting, really). He surprised her with a kiss on the cheek and she half-heartedly yelled at him to get out of her kitchen while he put the dessert down and pretended to swipe a biscuit from the counter, at which she hit his hand away and gave him a scowl. It would’ve been quite ferocious except she looked so pleased to see her extra child that it didn’t have quite the same effect.
At first, he worried that he was trying to find a mother figure in Narcissa, but the more they talked, the more comfortable he felt, like he was talking to a friend. The only difference between the way he spoke to Narcissa and his friends was that Narcissa told him stories about the past rather than plan for the future.
“Who cares if it isn’t ‘right’ according to someone else’s ethical standpoint? It’s right for us. Isn’t that what truly matters?” Malfoy asks, and Harry is surprised to find he agrees.
“Nothing,” Harry whispers. “Sorry I woke you.” He moves to get up, but Malfoy doesn’t let him get far.
go back, now that the creature who tried to kill me during my last visit is finally dead.” Malfoy rolls his eyes, but Harry is filled with genuine gratitude all over again. He lifts his juice goblet and toasts it in Neville’s direction. “Thanks again, mate!”
Malfoy’s glare melts away in an instant. He blinks at Harry, mouth opening and closing for a moment. “Sure,” he finally squeaks out.
“I am, as I have ever been, an obscenely wealthy, spoilt, entitled brat. Perhaps, aside from your egregious eavesdropping, what has you confused is the gentle, polite offering that I’ve couched my demands in.” Harry opens his mouth, but is again denied the opportunity to talk. “In which case, allow me to rephrase: I want you.” He stares hard into Harry’s eyes. “I want you in my bed, quivering, wanting me. I want to glare at you over my coffee in the mornings, and complain loudly when you want me so badly you need to wake me in the middle of the night. I want to read to you by the fire in the evenings. I want…" here, he falters. "I can be your family, Harry. If you want, That is. I know I'm just one man, and not even a great man, but when she's not off gallivanting round the world digging up ancient pots and such, I imagine Hermione will be there, too." He takes a deep breath. "And, in 5 or 10 years, perhaps we'll have an entitled, spoilt little brat of our own. If you want!"
Blaise laughs brightly and wraps and arm around Pansy’s shoulders. “Come, darling, it seems Potter has finally figured out the right thing to do with that Cloak. Who would’ve guessed it existed after all!”
Harry rubs his morning erection against Malfoy’s hip, nipping at what appears to be a very sensitive patch of skin. Malfoy jerks, yanks Harry all the way on top of him, wraps his long limbs around him. Harry licks, sucks, worries the hot flesh with his mouth while Malfoy moans beneath him. Their cocks bump together and it’s slightly painful and fucking wonderful in turns.
Harry hums skeptically. It’s unlike Malfoy to give Harry the benefit of the doubt, but Harry can admit that he doesn’t really deserve it in this instance. “I got bamboozled by a giant snake hiding in a reeking corpse.
, he thinks, taking himself in hand with an air of resignation. Then he hears the shower come on, and notices that Malfoy has left the door open.
"Admittedly, I have quite a bit to learn. I like to think I’m a quick study, though?” He’s shamelessly fishing for a compliment here, but a bit of reassurance would not go amiss.
“No, not about that. I mean, yes, but.” She pauses, searches for the right words. “Hard to believe there won’t be any threats to Harry’s life this school year.”
, he thinks, so turned on he can barely think. He wriggles under their hands and bodies, and he doesn’t know why, only that it feels so toe-curlingly good to be trapped like this.
He shifts, turns, and tries to trick his body into falling back asleep. It’s no use though. He sighs quietly and turns over again. Maybe slipping off to the en suite really is his best option, and he’s trying to talk himself into leaving the cozy warmth of Malfoy’s bed when Malfoy huffs and stills his fidgeting with firm hands.
As Harry ties his tie and fumbles his school robes on, it occurs to him that Malfoy is not, in fact, busy getting ready. He does a passable job of seeming to, but it's becoming increasingly clear that Malfoy is actually just waiting for him. Oh, Godric, is Malfoy going to want to
Harry admires the comfortable way that Malfoy asks for him. He watches as Malfoy slowly and seductively removes each item of clothing, hand on his growing erection. It’s rather reminiscent of their first night together, actually. All that’s missing is-
, Harry thinks, glaring at his back. It’s not until Ron coughs awkwardly, looking a bit green in the gills, that Harry realizes he’s been staring at Malfoy’s arse.
They don’t seem to mind it, though. If anything, Malfoy’s mouth and hands become more forceful; Hermione’s kiss more passionate. Harry clutches at Malfoy’s hip, at Hermione’s hand, and just holds on. Hermione pulls out of their kiss, smiles at Harry, and tells Malfoy in no uncertain terms to hurry up and get his kit off. Malfoy huffs, climbs over Hermione, and begins to strip next to the bed.
He straddles Draco’s chest, points his ruddy cock down at Draco’s gorgeous lips, and pushes inside Draco’s brilliant mouth. At first he only pushes in a little, conscious of the way he’d choked on Malfoy’s cock this morning, but Draco hums and sucks and bobs as much as he can in this position. It wears at Harry’s resolve, and before he knows it, he’s fucking into Draco’s mouth, listening to the lewd slurping noises, and thinking about how
As much as Harry might like to watch Malfoy crawl around on hand and knee performing menial labour, he feels it only right to help. There are dozens of the little buggers, but he works meticulously to put them all neatly back into the jar they’d spilled from. He’s very nearly done when he hears Hermione hum happily.
Harry elbows Malfoy for being such a snob, and accepts the next photo. It depicts a kitchen, spacious and warm and sunny. “It’s lovely,” Harry says, feeling something tighten in his chest. He can smell bread being baked in that large, modern looking oven. “Are these Muggle appliances?”
Harry never should have done it, but even as he lay in his bed admonishing himself for getting into this situation, he remembers. He can very clearly recall how it had felt to have Hermione's impossibly slick and hot pussy spasm around his dick. Honestly, he's not sure how he should feel about the events of last night, but his cock doesn't seem the least bit confused. His first time, beyond a few handies behind a greenhouse or shed, and it was a threesome with his gorgeous best friend and - he might as well admit it - the hottest guy he's ever met.
that?” Harry knows his face is bright red, and it seems improbable that Malfoy would be able to hold the parchment out of Harry’s reach when Harry has him halfway pinned. He reaches for it again, but Malfoy smacks his hand away.
Aaaand that’s it! Unless y’all are hungry for an epilogue, that is. Thank you for joining me on this ride. You all have been so very kind to me. fandom has given me so much over the past 17 years, and I mostly just wanted to give a little something back. Much love. <3
Malfoy withdraws his fingers, eyes burning with satisfaction and desire. Slowly, he drags them through the streak of come where it's spattered across Harry's belly and brings them to his mouth for a taste.
Ginny's expression is more thunderous than Harry's ever seen it, and she hisses at her brother through clenched teeth. "What kind of person takes a girl's virginity, breaks up with her when she doesn't sleep with you as much as you'd like, and then has the bloody nerve to call her a slag in front of everyone she knows? You'd better
Ron's eyes widened at the realization. "Oh no, Harry, I'm the one who told her that you were there together, but I didn't think...Oh Merlin!" He put his hands in his hair in guilt and frustration.
As Hermione was about to pronounce the words to a binding spell, a hand was placed on her mouth to prevent her from speaking.
The woman nodded. "I noticed a while ago, actually. New Year's eve, to be exact." She confirmed, her lips curled into a smile.
"Come on, Potter and Malfoy! Don't be childish!" Professor Sivan scolded them. "At least you agree on your mark... "
"Listen, come Monday, you go see the Headmistress and tell her what happened. Then, I will challenge him to a duel." Harry suggested.
Everyone moved to the living room, where Fleur was meticulously setting an ornament on the Christmas tree. It was a snow ball containing a small replica of the Beauxbatons castle.
"Draco, we're in the middle of Hogsmeade!" Harry observed, accentuating the fact that they were outside in the open air. But he didn't remove the possessive hand from his buttock. He didn't hate it there.
"Miss Parkinson, I heard and saw everything. Your wrong doing, which marks second on your criminal record, is punishable with immediate expulsion, no possibility of a trial. You fooled everyone here; Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter and the whole school. Plus, you forged a signature and made up a person, that is identity theft. " The teacher said in a bitter tone.
When he purchased it, he told the man behind the counter that he was looking for an emerald engagement ring - obviously, it didn't take the man long to put two and two together.
"Oh, right, I never make efforts." Harry scoffed. "Because I didn't go out of my way to invite you to spend Christmas with a family who most definitely hated you, so that you wouldn't spend it here, alone!"
"I'm just not hungry. I'll go to bed. If you'll excuse me." That said, she rose to her feet and left without saying no more.
Draco's words got through his father like a knife through butter. His eyes were widened, as he was incredulous. He looked at his hand without the wand, then he glared at his son.
In that moment, Luna's girlfriend rushed into the bathroom. "Mione? Are you alright?" she asked, out of breath.
"And I happen to love you, like only a nincompoop can love." the black haired boy said after his laughing had died down.
"Well, this is unexpected." Harry said, feeling surprised. He thought that the silence in the Great Hall meant trouble was to come. But, he was happy to be wrong. He turned his head to see Draco's reaction, he was just as surprised as he was.
"Why should I believe you, uh? You've done nothing but lie your way through things for eight years!" Ron spat.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Ginny said and pointed her wand at the camera. She opened her mouth to pronounce the spell, but Harry disarmed her with an "Expelliarmus!". He, Ron and Hermione were now taking a hold of her in order to stop her from getting to her wand.
"Ok, night, babe, love you too! Tell me how it works out, ok?" Harry said, then he disappeared from the fire.
Draco sighed. He'd been hoping that his boyfriend would magically appear at his dorm -he had told him the password, after all- and whisk him away, begging him for forgiveness.
"Oh, Ronald, you're so headstrong, sometimes you irritate my nerves!" Hermione dug into her promises. "But I love you, you're the love of my life and I will love until until I take my last breath."
"Oh," said Draco, looking at his fiancé lovingly. "Because we want to be together for the rest of our lives... Wait, how do you know about this?" He asked, even though the Hogwarts sneak theory made sense to him.
His attention fixed on the other players, he saw that the chasers, Leon Dechamps, Axel Segal and Basile Trevors, were very good and, also, they had a lot of presence in the show.
"So, for the power invested in me by the French Ministry of Magic, I now pronounce the people on my left as Husband and Husband and the people on my right as husband and wife."
The three of them hurried out of the office and rushed to the Gryffindor common room. It was on the tower, though, and they were in the dungeons. There was no time to lose.
Her blouse fluttered as she did so. That earned her a glare from Luna, as she had risked exposing her body.
Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him close to his chest, rocking him back and forth as he broke into a sob.
The Gryffindor common room was much warmer, not only for its location and its fire, which was always on, but also for the presence of his boyfriend.
Narcissa Malfoy had not left Hogwarts grounds yet. She had fled from Hogsmeade, but only to access the castle.
"You think you're so noble, but you're mentally poor. You only care about appearances, but the truth is you're simply a coward." Draco spat.
"Am I mute or something? Now, all of you, go back to eating dinner or I will expel you!" McGonagall yelled.
"Dreaming of Malfoy, eh?" Ron's voice almost startled him. He looked at his best friend, who was sitting on his bed, giving Harry a blank stare. Oh shit, he had talked in his sleep. He didn't know what to say now, but he was certain that Ron would have killed him.
Draco tried to imagine Adrian as someone else, but it didn't work too well. He felt hatred for him, even if the team's fate largely depended on him.
"Oh, babe, you're Ok!" said a stuttering Ginny. She flung her arms around her girlfriend, wrapping her into a firm embrace. "I was so scared that something had happened to you!"
Everyone noticed it, even Ron, who had been fangirling over the Harpies Beater signing a piece of parchment.
Draco watched as his parents were forced out of the room, thinking that it would probably be the last time he'd see them. He felt as if they had just died, right in front of him.
"If I'm fine with it, of course, my sweet!" Said Molly, putting a motherly hand on her daughter's. "Don't tell your dad, but before I had him... I had my fair share of experiences with girls."
"Morning, dears! Merry Christmas!" said a singing Molly as Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Ginny and Luna descended the stairs, looking very sleepy. "The journey to London killed you, eh? But no worry, the lunch Fleur and I prepared is enough to wake you up." Then she trotted to the kitchen.
Luna and Ginny's studying sessions weren't that easy, as they'd spend most of their time together kissing and being cute.
"So that you can keep it as a memento of our study sessions which turned into a lot of fun under the tree in Hogwarts." Hermione added, beaming.
The little boy seemed to enjoy being moved around from his parents to his uncles and aunts, his cute baby laughter confirming the theory.
"Yes, I know, I was there during her meeting with them." The voice in the fire said. "I do think that Potter has begun to suspect something is fishy with you, Mrs Malfoy."
The European Cup had contributed to making Draco's late birthday celebration almost as good as Ginny's, despite Adrian Martin.
"Ok now I'd say that before we cut the cake," Hermione began, giving Luna a look. "I think we should all say something about the Birthday girl here."
"Yeah, that'd be me. And I don't go over to the Slytherin table because they all hate me. And now they hate my boyfriend, too." Harry snapped, feeling confident.
Ginny should have had a worse time than her, since Ron was her own brother, but that wasn't the case.
"Just cuddle a teddy bear or something. I don't know if in France 'snuggling' consists in touching people's privates wearing only underpants," said Draco, moving further away from the other boy. "But here, it is downright creepy. And if you don't go back to your bed I will call the Headmistress."
He felt sick to his stomach as he imagined Draco sitting down with Jean Jacques to discuss said plan.
They risked losing everything because of a jealous, untrustworthy, girl who had disguised herself as an obnoxious foreigner.
"Look, my dear, I'm sorry that I didn't get in touch with you. As you know, your father won't smile at you if you contradict him." she voiced her apologies.
"Ah, give him to me now! I want to hold him and smell his head. Babies always smell good." Luna tittered.
Hermione cleared her throat. "Zabini was so incredibly obnoxious, don't you think?" She said, shifting the attention to herself.
He took a breath. It was now or never, he had to man up and apologise to the person he loved. They'd had a terrible fight, but it wasn't so serious - not to break them up. This was only a matter of pride.
"Draco, what's up with you? Being late for potions? And also, where were you all morning?" Pansy asked the blonde boy. "Nowhere you should care about." He responded. She gave him a look that expressed that maybe she knew more than he thought. He froze in his tracks as she said: "I know what you did. And soon everyone else will know."
"Yeah, so, how can I fix this, babe?" asked a struggling Luna, who was struggling with keeping the broom still.
Ron flew his sister in the air for how happy he had been to see her. They had become closer over the last year and they had developed a very sweet friendship.
This year, Harry was going to celebrate it in an unusual way- first thing being with his boyfriend, secondly, he was going to spend it in Hermione's house.
"Wow, it's really cool! I guess I will make some irritating potion for you when you get under my skin, Potter." Draco said teasingly. "Now, yours."
Just like he had done that time, the Gryffindor tried to whisper calming words into the Slytherin's hair, as he cried so hard that his whole body shook.
Harry and Draco cheered, anyway, even though they felt that Ron had been inspired by their engagement.
So, nargles actually existed and the Lovegoods bred them? She wondered if the nargles Luna hated so much were the ones who had escaped from her backyard.
"Stop seeing evil schemes everywhere, babe! That is my mother, she has her own sense of humour." he whined.
Harry rolled his eyes. His husband was always so obsessed with being on time, so much that they would always be early for events.
He knew his aching heart and itch to be close to the blonde went far beyond the bond. He’d had an inkling for a while now, he just hadn’t wanted to face it, he had been putting it off all summer and he was facing the consequences of that choice now. The fact that the only thing he’d really been able to focus on was the fact that Draco had admitted to him that he, Draco Malfoy stone faced, posh, proper, Malfoy, was in fact in love with him, only smacked him in the face more harshly with what he’d been avoiding all summer.
Harry pulled back and took in Draco’s pink cheeks and full lips. He took Draco’s hand in his and without thinking started walking them through the house and stealthily (hopefully) pulled them out into the back yard.
Harry reached a hand out to brush a loose strand of fringe from Draco’s eyes, and Draco could feel a blush begin to heat his cheeks. Though all he could do was lean into the touch and smile fondly at the other boy.
Draco was drawn away from his thoughts by Harry, he could feel his gaze. He lifted his eyes, searching for green and was pulled to him almost instantly. Their eyes met, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat, the deep longing he felt enveloped around him like a snug blanket making him feel warm but also trapped. But fuck if he didn’t want to be trapped there for the rest of eternity.
Harry could sense that Draco was uneasy, and obviously couldn’t blame him. After getting to know the blonde that summer he knew that sometimes he needed to just let the other boy be alone with himself, with his thoughts.
As they pulled apart after a brief moment, Remus held Harry at arm’s length casting him a knowing look. Harry felt himself begin to flush, what exactly did he know? Did he have it written across his forehead? Remus chose not to voice it, content with keeping Harry guessing.
Harry wasn’t willing to fully admit it to himself yet, but he knew deep down that he was addicted to being near Malfoy. He was finding more and more excuses to be around him even if he couldn’t always justify them to himself, Malfoy, or Hermione and Ron.  For the past few weeks Harry had spent his evenings in the common room curled up in the overstuffed arm chair across from Malfoy reading one of the various books he had selected for him. Harry realized that while he did love getting lost in the storyline and leaving his own world behind him for a little while, it was really the conversations with Malfoy that he craved. After Harry finished one of the books Malfoy would always ask what he thought and they would share their views and ideas, and Malfoy really listened to him. Not only that, but he found that he really enjoyed listening to Malfoy, he always had really good insight and made Harry think about the characters or the storyline in new and interesting ways. So now not only was Harry addicted to exploring new worlds that he could lose himself in, but he was also addicted to listening to Malfoy’s feelings and notions, inquisitive to know if they aligned with his own.
At the moment Harry was pretending to be immersed in a very heated quidditch debate involving the twins, Mr. Weasley, and of course Ron. All while avoiding knowing looks from Hermione who was chatting with Remus, or at least pretending to chat with Remus while sending him reproachful looks.
It overwhelmed him, how much it tugged at his heart to know that Harry had spent his previous fifteen birthday’s in this hell-hole. Harry deserved to spend every birthday knowing how special and important he was…especially to Draco.
Definitely, a lot going on in this chapter! Dying to know what you all think! I feel like it's been ages since I've updated though its only been a few days! <3
This, however, was like dinner in the great hall of Hogwarts times ten, times a thousand really. All of the chaos, the chatter, and the excitement of finishing up a school day seated around your best mates as everyone passed food around and talked over one another had nothing on the utter pandemonium that was the Weasley clan.
After a few moments Draco pulled away, smile still in place because Harry just had that effect on him. He was absolutely certain no one at Hogwarts would even recognize him with the dopey smile on his face all the time, his ‘street cred’ would be completely null and void.
Harry found himself clinging to Draco more deeply, pulling his head back so he could lose himself in the skin on Draco’s neck and collarbone thoroughly enjoying the noises it elicited from the boy rocking himself above him. He knew they were both close, he could feel it in the way they both had become more frantic, more desperate against each other. Draco brought his hands back up to Harry’s face, fingers digging into Harry’s cheeks and neck, “I’m gonna come Harry.”
There was a moment of silence, and Draco began to panic a little afraid that his trepidations would come to fruition.
He wasn’t used to sleeping so far away from Harry, not that he was entirely far, it weren’t as if this room was much bigger than the one, they’d shared in Surrey, but they weren’t pressed together. Their limbs were untwined, their skin untouched, their breaths unmingled.
He moved his hand from Draco’s balls to the base of his cock, jerking up to meet his mouth as he continued to suck fervidly.
“Draco,” Harry’s moans were more reckless, and he was begging Draco’s name from his lips which drove the blonde absolutely wild, and also concerned that the Dursley’s might burst into the room at any moment fully aware of their activities. Although, if they were fully aware perhaps that was what was keeping them at bay.
Harry wasn’t sure how long they stood like that, Draco’s arms latched around him, and Harry’s palms cradling the blonde’s face, but it didn’t matter because a moment later they were both pulled from the revelry by a very strategic cough.
The two boys walked in silence for a few beats before Potter turned to him, putting his arm out to grasp Draco by the shoulder, heat pulsating where he touched him, and turn him to face him head on.
Harry contemplated actually sitting on his side of the sofa so as not to disturb the other boy, reasoning that from that spot he could still peer over at Malfoy from his own book. However, the pull of his desire to feel the other boy’s warmth, and the chance at feeling his skin against his own was too strong to ignore. So, without a second thought he flopped himself down into the spot directly next to Malfoy, pulling some of his blanket into his own lap as always. Harry in a moment of audaciousness pulled Malfoy by the ankles and rested the other boy’s feet in his lap, then pulled his book open and pretended he didn’t feel the heat in his cheeks, or the heat of Malfoy’s eyes on him.
Harry rolled his eyes at the sentiment, and cringed a little as the bond kicked in. He knew Draco knew the limits of the bond, but to Harry it didn’t matter. He didn’t relish even the slightest bit of discomfort especially since the more uncomfortable it became the further Draco was away from him.
Harry looks around, then back at Malfoy who is peering up at him from his armchair looking a little timid? Draco Malfoy looking timid? This is uncharted territory for both of them Harry thinks, and it makes him feel a little more settled.
Draco smiled, “I always knew I was brilliant; I just didn’t know you thought so too,” he replied cheekily. Harry let out a laugh at that, “I didn’t either, at least not until this summer.”
All Harry could do was laugh, as he looked from Draco to Remus, who’s amused look seemed plastered to his face as he looked between the two of them before leading the way back out into the entryway of the house.
He could feel the bond thrumming under his skin, he couldn’t see Potter, he could only hear Dudley’s laughter growing distinctly louder, then suddenly he heard Potter let out scream of agony, and his panic began to intensify. His brain shut off, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was moving solely based on the bond’s instinct, or his heart’s instinct, but he reasoned that in that moment it didn’t matter; Potter needed him, and that was the only thing that mattered.
Draco smiled at them both and allowed himself to be pulled into one final hug from Mrs. Weasley before turning back to meet up with Harry at one of the entrances to the train. He noted internally that he could still feel the pulsating ache of the bond and let himself feel a small sense of relief.
The blonde wrapped his arms around him securely gripping the back of his jumper and breathing him in. Harry relished in it, wrapped himself around the moment and instantly felt the ache lift. He pulled back for a moment and looked up at Draco hands cupping the boy’s soft cheeks.
He reached a hand up to lightly fondle Draco’s balls earning himself a hiss and quick intake of breath from the blonde.
Draco had yet to find time that evening to speak with Ron, who was still actively avoiding him which definitely made it more difficult. He had however, found time after dinner to corner Hermione and enlist her help.
How wrong Harry was. The story was so intense that he found he needed to take several breaks in between sections of reading, making him realize why it had been four long nights before Draco padded down the stairs to leave the story with him. Reading that particular novel was less an escape and more of a hard look at what had quickly developed between himself and Draco. It was intoxicating and addicting to read inside the mind of someone who was suffering from the same beguiling relationship that he was. Never before had he found himself so engulfed and dependent on a book in his life, and when he was finally finished, he felt that he was almost gasping for air at the intensity of it all. He found that he didn’t want the same ending as Oliver and Elio from the story, he wanted Draco to stay and he wanted to stay. He wanted to face the world and whatever lay before them because he was definitely without a doubt irrevocably in love with Draco Malfoy.
“You’re different, you seem less, less… less, you? I guess.” Harry finished almost with a wince, like he couldn’t form the words to accurately convey his thoughts on the matter. Draco outwardly rolled his eyes but retained his half-smile. “The eye rolling is a tad more Malfoy,” Potter added with his own teasing eye roll.
At that, they were all summoned to the dining room for dinner by the shrill, but pleasant voice of Molly Weasley. Harry jumped up, anxious to check on Draco and all Hermione could do was laugh as she followed him.
Harry glances over to the sofa in front of the fire where he normally sits with Ron and Hermione. Ron is giving him a look that reads, ‘what the hell are you on about mate?’ and he can already picture Hermione’s knowing look, so he avoids her gaze altogether. He looks back towards Ron, gives him a shoulder shrug, chances one more look over at Malfoy who seems to be engrossed in his own book before opening the one in front of him and beginning to read.
Draco watched Harry’s eyes drift from his gaze down to his lips, and finally settle on the box Draco had extended out towards him in offering.
“I’ve heard back from Hermione.” He watched Draco perk up a little a look of trepidation gracing his soft sleepy face. Of course, after their very intimate and fucking amazing time spent reassuring each other that they had in fact made-up and they did very much love each other,
Draco looked up at the sky, only briefly distracted by the first drops of rain musing only for a moment that he had predicted this earlier, the rain that is, before turning back to Dudley. From the corner of his eye he could spot that Potter was trying to use his cousin’s brief distraction to his advantage, so without thinking he put his wand away, and watched as Dudley’s face turned smug as if he had won. “I don’t need anything other than my fist to put you in your place, just ask your pathetic father, I’m sure he remembers,” Draco spat with a side glance towards Potter, trying to distract Dudley for long enough.
Although, that morning Draco couldn’t be bothered to care about the frenzy that was probably taking place downstairs. He was adrift in the warmth of Harry, curled up into his side, face buried into the crook of his neck. For a brief moment Draco had the idle thought that he shouldn’t move, shouldn’t touch for fear of waking the sleeping brunette. However, when faced with the daunting day ahead the thought instantly vanished and he arched into Harry’s warmth pulling him into his arms more snugly, basking in the feel of their skin touching, the prickle of the bond humming through his veins.
With harry he felt light, he felt funny, and free; he felt like himself. He couldn’t go back, and he didn’t want to. It felt more important to be true to himself than to make his family happy, and deep down he knew this is what his mother would want for him, his father be damned.
He knew that he was supposed to hate Potter on paper, but realistically his ‘hatred’ was mostly jealousy, which he had begrudgingly admitted to himself heartbreakingly about half-way through first term. When he first arrived at Hogwarts, Draco had just been so relieved to get away from home. He couldn’t even think about the manor without conjuring up horrifying images of torture and rage as Voldemort had made his childhood home a base for his rise back to power. Draco shuddered at the memories and began to break out into a cold sweat as he tried to shake the illustrations of fear and panic depicted in the eyes of those unlucky enough to meet the Dark Lord in the flesh. He wrapped his arms around himself, as he tried to calm down, a tactic he found himself using more frequently as the year wore on.
Draco’s gaze never left Harry; the other boy was like a magnet pulling Draco’s attention towards him always. The second their eyes met Draco melted, he couldn’t believe he’d managed to go this long with his heart as heavy as it was. It didn’t even matter to him in that moment that he’d confessed his love without a confession in return. He knew his face was giving him away, he had grown terrible at lifting his mask in the presence of Potter, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to anyways. Harry made him feel safe to be himself, like it was okay to feel things.
“Draco, I…” Draco watched as Harry ran a hand through his own hair before meeting his eyes again and yanking him to meet his lips in a desperate kiss. Harry began kissing down Draco’s neck and snaking his hands down his sides.
He felt himself begin to flush, and his heart sped up. He’d let himself hope that maybe things would be alright. Maybe he’d really be able to start over, choose for himself. Before he could really let himself loose into the frenzy of his mind and how he’d ruined this for himself, Granger interrupted his thoughts.
“Honestly Potter, how you ever find anything clean in that wardrobe of yours is beyond me. Believe it or not, the floor is not a trash bin or a laundry basket.”
“Honestly? No. They’re all bound to find out soon enough anyways, and Ron already knows so what’s the real point?”
The blonde boy laid there, taking up the old hobby of losing himself in the ceiling tiles as he dreaded the conversation, he was due to have with the headmaster that was surely drawing nearer. He knew his father would be furious with him, as if somehow, he had gotten himself stuck to Potter on purpose just to aggravate him. Draco internally rolled his eyes at his father; he knew there would be consequences for this whether it was his fault or not, but Draco wasn’t stupid. He knew he wasn’t the only one who was going to feel his father’s wrath, and he also knew that his father’s anger grew from his own internal fear of accepting his own punishment from the Dark Lord, a punishment Draco knew he, himself, was only safe from for two more months.
He squeezed his eyes closed in an effort to clear his mind, but promptly snapped them open as he heard a loud, “HEY!” yelled out from a short distance away, he audibly groaned and heard Potter do the same from beside him, they both knew who that cutting voice belonged to.
Both boys let out a soft laugh and pulled back to look at each other. Draco felt overcome in the moment, neither of them had dared to speak in great length about what being back at Hogwarts would like for them. He felt a certain reassurance that Harry’s best mates did in fact know about the two of them, and not just that they’d been fooling around all summer, but that…that Harry loved him. That sentiment alone must have had some weight to it. Surely, they couldn’t deign to pretend for an entire year, not when they weren’t even sure what their lives would look like a year from now.
Draco watched as Harry let out a laugh and squeezed his thigh more firmly. “How could I have missed how funny you are? Save all your whit and charm for Grabbe, and Goyle then? What was it that made you deem me worthy enough?”
Potter had also dragged him to a muggle movie theatre as the brunette didn’t read and reasoned to Draco that it was only fair that he get to choose something to aid in their quest of avoiding their own inner monologues for the day. Draco found himself fascinated by the theatre, never having been before, as of course all things muggle related were banned in the Malfoy household. As they ate something called ‘popcorn’ and sat side by side staring up at the big screen Draco found that he was almost as interested in the movie as he was in how their knees kept bumping against one another’s.
Severus found himself pacing his office yet again in anxious contemplation. There had already been so many shifts within the last year alone, and yet, he knew this shift would ultimately come he just didn’t know how to face it. Severus Snape was not a man who often allowed himself to wallow in his own emotion, it was easier to store it away and take it out when it was most convenient for himself than to face it head on. However, every now and again he found himself faced with moments where storing his sentiments away for a more appropriate time unviable; such as now.
It was true that the conversation he’d had with Harry the previous evening had gone much better than he could have hoped for, but the reality that tomorrow morning they’d all be getting back on the Hogwarts express was hitting him full force like a bludger to the chest.
He knew at once that he was failing miserably at hiding his diminutive break down when his eyes locked with Harry’s. He took a deep breath to steady himself and reign himself in and then graced Harry with a soft half smile, their signature, before vacating any remaining emotion from his face. He could tell that Harry was worried, the brunette had never been even a little practiced at hiding his own emotions and Draco was sure that it was difficult to look at Draco like this after so long of being fully let in. Shit, it was hard for Draco to go back to this place after allowing himself this summer of reprieve. But Harry knew, he knew that Draco had to do what was necessary to survive this year in the Slytherin dorms, they both did.
He felt his lips quirk up into a half-smile as Draco pulled him forward, hand gripped tightly on his jumper for an intense moment of lips and teeth and tongues and groans.
Draco watched as Hermione let out a deep laugh at that, “Of course he did. He is such a prat sometimes.”
“So, let’s not think,” Draco huskily whispered, wet against his ear. The admission went straight to his cock.
He’d mused before that being at the Weasley’s was a lot like being at Hogwarts, there were always people huddled in various rooms playing games, chatting, snacking, arguing…there was truly never a dull moment. The comparison made it a little bit easier for Draco to lean on his snarky sarcasm; there was no need for anyone here to know just how soft Harry’d made him, was there?
The next chapter is BIG..at least in my opinion, so I hope this knowledge will you keep excited for what's to come!
Harry was besotted, he couldn’t think of one sharp whited response. He was at Draco’s mercy he knew, though it was clear the blonde still hadn’t the slightest clue what he did to Harry’s resolve and that just wouldn’t do.
Draco was lulled awake by the faint whisper of voices. Before he could be tempted to open his eyes in search of the source he remembered where he was and dared to feign sleep a little longer as the voices became a bit more clear.
Harry let out a groan, as he met Draco’s gaze, “I’ve been thinking the same thing since you rolled on top of me,” Harry half laughed half groaned out through gritted teeth, and a soft half smile.
“Look, I promise I have the fullest intention of speaking with Ron. It’s just, well, I mean look around. There isn’t exactly an opportunity to pull him away right now, not when we’ve only just got here. I’m hoping for some time after dinner, maybe?” Hermione gave him a formidable look, grave, and unsmiling.
“Well, it’s technically the end of summer. I figured our agreement has expired, and so naturally you’d return to your normal broody self, yeah?”
I am off the next few days! Yay! So I'll definitely be editing and therefore posting much more often!
Harry lifted up still bracketing Draco’s thighs, “Let me make you come, please” and he swears that for all intensive purposes that he intended it to come out unwavering. Instead his voice cracks on the please and he could feel his own cheeks heat and felt completely and utterly at Draco’s clemency.
Draco gave a small laugh in response to Harry's comment about his aunt's cooking, before turning back to look out the window. Draco began to ruminate on the fact that it would soon, once again, be time to crawl in to Potter’s poor excuse of a bed, and not talk about it in the morning. The past week spent commiserating together, had been suffered in silence between the two of them. Draco spent a lot of time thinking about his parents, and the last conversation he had with Severus before leaving Hogwarts, but sometimes, sometimes his mind drifted over to the things Draco had shoved deep, deep down into the caverns of his soul, willing himself to be able to leave them there especially due to the circumstances.
Harry held the long chain up and stared at the tiny green and silver dragon, a charm no larger than a Knut hanging from the end.
“Let’s just test out the bond at dinner, if it’s too painful we’ll figure out who to go to then yeah?”
“Shhh…” he said with a grin he knew was wicked and pushed Draco back against the wall furthest from the staircase.
True to his word, Draco had yanked Harry out of bed the following morning and dragged him into town in celebration of his birthday. Although, to be fair, he hadn’t yanked him out of bed until he had been well and properly snogged ‘good morning.’
Draco knew Hermione wasn’t just anyone to Harry, it was his best friend. Of course, there was Weasley, but that wasn’t the same as what he had with Granger and Draco knew it. If he could win over Granger, he could inevitably win over Weasley and so he had begun devising his own plan for their final week at “The Burrow,” or so it was titled.
After their discussion Halloween night, Draco mused that the two boys had become inseparable, not that he was complaining. Draco knew that his feelings towards Potter were unraveling at a pace quicker than he knew how to handle, let alone decipher, but he liked the way he felt too much to care. Draco noticed that Potter was finding new and more creative ways to touch him inconspicuously; a graze on the shoulder here, a brush of the arm there, and plopping down next to him much closer than necessary more often than not. Again, not that Draco was complaining. In fact, Potter’s boldness only seemed to embolden Draco who was only too keen to return Potter’s soft grazes, and brushes.
She smiled between the two boys, patted Draco’s cheek again softly for good measure, and then began making her rounds ensuring that everyone had everything they needed and then ushering everyone towards the train.
Harry let out a long sigh, he needed to face it. The time for hiding away was dwindling fast, with one last long look at the loops of her neat script he began to slowly unfold her letter and read.
Draco didn’t know how to feel now that everyone knew about, he and Harry. For starters, what did they even know? Neither boy had ventured further in the realms of discussing what life at Hogwarts would look like for them. Were they telling anyone beyond the Weasley’s, and if so, what were the qualifications for letting someone in on the secret? Draco felt keen to lose himself in all the ‘what-ifs’ swirling around in a mumbled mess in his mind. It seemed silly after their summer to be caught up on the technicalities of their relationship. They were in love and they’d confessed as much to one another, and Draco felt like it was enough. However, the feeling of what they shared being enough wasn’t quite
Instead Harry had taken to stealing glances of Malfoy here and there. He’d begun to notice that sometimes when he thought he was inconspicuously stealing a glance at Malfoy that the blonde was looking right back at him. Most of these moments usually ended abruptly with both parties quickly averting their gaze, nervous at being caught out. However, more recently Malfoy had become keen to continue staring back at him until Harry’s cheeks began to heat and his heart began to race. A magnetic force pulling his gaze away and furrowing his brow in confusion. Usually, these moments also ended with Malfoy standing from his armchair in the corner of the common room and heading up the stairs towards the dormitories. Harry knew this because, that magnetic force that pulled his eyes away from Malfoy was the same one that drew him back to watch him walk away.
**Smut warning** If it's not your thing that's totally fine, but it comes right at the beginning of this chapter! Feel free to skip to Draco's POV to avoid! :)
He’d felt uneasy himself, not rummaging the various rooms and hallways encompassing the Burrow in search of Draco all day, he could tell that Draco needed time, no matter how little they still had left to just be themselves.
Dumbledore looked at him with his signature knowing gaze, “I think it’s best that Severus give us a recount of events, as he was there when it happened, Severus…” the headmaster turned his traditional gaze on the potions master who seemed at a loss for words, a look that seemed foreign on the stern and self-assured professor Harry had grown accustomed to. At the growing silence Harry cleared his throat and looked to his two best friends for some much-needed answers. Hermione began to chew her bottom lip with growing anxiety, and it seemed Ron were interested in looking anywhere but at Harry seeming more keen to pretend he hadn’t been invited into the conversation. Harry sighed in exasperation, “Can someone just tell me what’s going on!” Hermione gave a slight flinch, no doubt more used to Harry’s outbursts over the last year, “Harry,” she sighed as if unsure how to carry on. After a moment more of hesitation she continued, “something’s happened” she paused again. “Well obviously, I’m not that dense Hermione, just tell me what it is! It can’t be worse than anything else that’s happened this year” Harry said with a final huff.
Harry watched as Remus took his place, interjecting his own thoughts on the Quidditch lineups this year, before turning back to face his curly haired friend with a small smile. He knew he was in for it.
I'm so sorry it has taken me so long to update! Life takes over, and my job is so...it just makes it impossible to get much writing in some times!! Either way, I hope you liked it!
Not taking his eyes off of Harry’s, Malfoy continued, “he took up residence at the manor, and made himself at home. Each meal was concluded not with dessert, but with the torturing of some helpless muggle, or muggle-born. Sometimes the torturing took place because he needed something from them, some sort of information or token, but sometimes…sometimes, it was just because he could, because he took some sick pleasure in it.”
year. Many of his former classmates chose to forgo the traditional Hogwarts education as they were still busy mending aching hearts and broken families. Pansy had taken her exams earlier that summer, Blaise was interning in Switzerland, and Greg couldn’t bring himself to even consider coming back without Vincent. Therefore, no one really spared a glance towards him; Draco Malfoy reformed death eater.
Hermione let out another sigh, it seemed the two of them were much more alike than he’d originally thought.
Before either boy could even open the door of the car, Potter’s uncle whipped his head around the seat to peer back at them with beady black eyes, “straight up to your room, the lot of you, I want silence. This whole ordeal has really taken a toll on your Aunt and she needs her rest before Dudley returns from Smelting’s tomorrow, you hear me boy?” Draco felt his eyes widen in response, but continued to stay silent, he’d never imagined that in a million years the beloved by all Harry Potter was not as equally adored at home. “Yes, Uncle Vernon,” was Potter’s curt response before opening his own door and going to the back for his school trunk. Draco followed Potter closely and silently as they dragged their trunks up the stairs to the other boy’s room. Draco was unused to doing things this way, he usually had a house elf to greet himself as well as his parents as they all arrived home from the station, who would apparate his trunk up to his room for him.
There was a moment of silence where they shared a smile, but it didn’t stretch on long before Granger spoke.
The last couple of weeks at Hogwarts seemed to go by in blur and in the blink of an eye. Harry felt that most days his heart was heavy, making it hard to get up and face each day. Going to classes those last few weeks had felt mundane and tiring, taking up what little energy he seemed to have. His stomach clenched each time he remembered Sirius, not wanting to believe he was truly gone. His godfather’s eyes plagued his dreams at night, at least they did when Voldemort wasn’t invading his mind with visions of death and decay.
“No, Potter, I don’t think it was,” Draco retorted meeting Potter’s eyes with a grin, daring to admonish his true feelings for the brunette.
Draco felt himself begin to blush and heat up but being so near Potter made it impossible to push the onslaught of imagery back where it belonged; in the deep down far away caverns of his soul. He also tried not to dwell too much on the fact that the other boy had spoken his actual name, had let it fall from his plump red gorgeous lips. He knew for Potter, that everything he was feeling, it was the bond, and not years of pent up feelings of fondness projected out as hatred because he was too afraid to admit to himself what the fondness truly meant. Therefore, Draco felt torn in many different directions; on one hand he wanted to give in to the bond and just let himself enjoy how good it felt to touch and be near the person he was bonded to, and on the other hand he didn’t want to set himself up for even more torment than he was already due when he eventually returned home. For all he knew, Potter could take this entire summer back to Gryffindor tower when they returned back to Hogwarts and everyone would know he was fucking gay as hell, and to top it all off, gay as hell for the supposed savior.
As quietly and as unnoticeably as he could, he crossed the room and followed Draco up the stairs, careful to make sure he hadn’t been followed. As he turned the corner, headed towards Ron’s room where he knew they would all be sleeping the next week, he was met by Draco who was exiting the room, and headed for the bathroom.
Harry turned to look back at their room one last time, just in time to watch as Draco stood at the open door, gazing in at the small shared space. It was almost as if he could hear the blonde’s thoughts, ‘it hadn’t been much, but it had felt like so much more.’ It felt true for both of them, and Harry couldn’t help but smile as Draco turned to face him with sad eyes, turned soft, once they locked with Harry’s.
Draco managed a snigger of laughter, but his heart was clenched tight he knew Potter’s tone and the fact that he was still touching him all boded well, but for all he knew it could be the bond thrumming through them that urged Potter to touch him, and it all seemed too good to be true.
Harry’s expression was completely blank. Draco slowly began to panic, and instead of waiting just pushed forward into an explanation.
“Of course, it is, who would want to spend their sixteenth birthday with such charming muggles,” Malfoy nudged Harry’s elbow with his own, a grin gracing his face full force. Harry couldn’t help but let out a laugh and grin back at him. Feeling unsure if he would ever get used to the way Malfoy’s face looked lit up with a smile, and how it seemed to make his stomach twist in a way that made him want to elicit that same smile over and over again.
“I really appreciated the conversation we had, I can see why Harry is so fond…and thank you. You know, for the other thing. It feels nice that it’s out in the open even if I wasn’t the one to say it. Sort of like a burden has been lifted, thank you.”
Harry hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Malfoy since…well if he was keeping himself in check, he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Draco since the start of term when their eyes first met. But this felt different, Harry hadn’t been able to stop thinking about him in ways that made his cheeks hot, and his skin prickle. Of course, he still hadn’t really faced himself in terms of what it meant, only that he knew he relished in getting lost in how Malfoy made him feel.
“Well, tell me, what has you tossing and turning at night? The idea that with a war going on there may not be enough people to sit around and rave on about how brilliant you are, or worse, the fact that your father won’t be able to buy your way out?” Harry returned channeling his own sneer, as he peered over at Malfoy wariness back full fledge.
Draco let out a laugh at that as well and looked up to meet Harry’s gaze; green met silver and Harry was compelled to say it again.
Harry watched as Malfoy ran his hands over his face, and through his sleep-rumpled hair before he spoke again, softer this time, “that’s what I dream about, sometimes I’m forced to relive the things I’ve done, sometimes I’m forced to relive being tortured by my father, and sometimes my mind creates new and even more terrible things,” Harry watched as Malfoy trailed off, and looked at him eyes filled with anguish, unsure of how to continue.
He leaned his head down, tongue giving a tentative lick to the head of Harry’s cock, tasting the pre-come before once again daring to let his eyes dart up for the other boy’s reaction. Harry’s eyes were squeezed shut lips parted and head tossed back against his pillow, and Draco marveled that Harry had never looked more beautiful or hot or sexy or delicious than in that moment. This version of Harry obliviated all of Draco’s best fantasy versions of the brunette in all the best ways, the biggest one being that this was the real living, breathing, flesh and blood Harry Potter, and Draco was about to suck him off.
“Yes,” Harry replied letting out a shaky laugh in the process, “merlin, yes. Draco, I thought I was going to come before you even got my pants off just looking at you, fuck.”
“Oh, right.” Harry watched as Hedwig once again, eagerly exited out the window, without once looking back.
“You’re brilliant, you know that don’t you,” Harry spoke into Draco’s hair, running lazy circles along the ridges of his spine.
“I’m sorry, it’s really my fault Hermione was helping me with something, and I lost track of time. I knew you were just around the corner and I thought it’d be fine, but I forgot that time can make it worse…I was too long…”
Draco surged on before he could lose his nerve, needing to get out how he felt, “Harry I would have never dreamed you could ever harbor any sort of pleasant feelings for me in my wildest dreams. I know I’ve been a right shit to you since we started school, and this past year I’ve only begun to process that I treated you that way because I was unwilling to face how I really felt about you, because of what that might mean about me.”
Draco let himself flop back down onto the bed, eyes squeezed shut, fingers gripping the sheets. In the deep recesses of his soul he knew there wasn’t really an option. His mind was allowing him to believe that he truly had a choice between the dark and light, but he knew intuitively that the choice had already been made by his heart.
“Of course not, if this, if I can be some of the reason you don’t have to become a death eater then I’m glad this happened. It doesn’t matter how shitty you’ve been in the past, and it sounds like you’ve been more than punished for how awful you’ve been. We’re children if you think about it, these are supposed to be our prime years spent figuring out who we are, who we want to be. We aren’t meant to spend them fighting a war against a dictator, yet, here we are.”
Harry let out a laugh, “Honestly, I’d rather have you wear nothing around the house more often,” and it was Draco’s turn to laugh.
Who knew where they would be this time next year, and every moment counted. With that thought, he pulled Harry back to his lips for a scorching kiss that ended with Draco yanking Harry by the front of his pants back into bed. Packing long, long forgotten.
“As precious as this is, you two better get a move on, we’re leaving in twenty minutes and Mrs. Weasley is even twice as frantic as normal. I suspect it won’t be me who finds the two of you like this next time, I was only just able to volunteer myself the first time.”
“Merlin, I’m concerned. Draco really has done a number on you hasn’t he?” Although, when Harry glanced up, he could tell her smile was fond. Harry could do nothing but smile back at her sheepishly, knowing damn well there was no way he could deny it; Draco really had done a number on him.
Harry let out a sigh as carefully as he could, careful not to wake Draco. He knew he needed to write to Hermione, and he definitely needed a quiet place where he could take his time undistracted, and without injuring the bond too harshly; he peered over at the head of blonde hair next to him.
Harry answered with a kiss to Draco’s cheek, then his eye lids, and nose, and chin, and finally a long and sweet kiss to his lips.
Before he could really let himself derail and go full on panic attack, the brunette in his arms shifted, nuzzling deeper into Draco’s neck, Potter took a very deep breath before eliciting a content sigh and twining his leg up with Draco’s. Draco let himself close his eyes and just take in the moment, he ran his hand up and down Potter’s shoulder softly relishing in listening to the other boy’s inhales and exhales, eventually falling asleep to the soft gusts of breath grazing his neck.
Harry was pulled back to reality as Draco steered the two of them towards the theatre a small grin plastered across his face. It was the kind of smile that filled Draco’s face even though Harry knew he was trying his hardest to conceal it from him. Harry didn’t mind, he’d let Draco pretend but they both knew they couldn’t hide from each other; not anymore.
Though, within seconds Potter had twisted himself somewhat free, and Draco jumped into action Dudley forgotten as he watched Potter try and twist his arm free, yanking Dudley’s cohort by the front of his shirt, he put his right-hook to good use for the second time that summer and decked him square in the face. Before he had time to process the course of events, Potter had him by the wrist and was dragging him away from the three boys as it began to rain is torrents.
Alright here we go, were definitely on the precipice of a big change....and sadly we're definitely getting nearer to the end!
Harry was silent for a while, before he faced Dumbledore, finally looking up at the headmaster, “What does Ron mean I’m stuck with him all summer, how is that even possible?” Harry stated pretty calmly for someone who had recently been prone to immediate anger.
“Mate we’ve all known. I mean honestly Harry the way you look at Malfoy, like he’s the last slice of Treacle Tart in the entirety of the wizarding world. It was kind of hard not to notice,” George said grin still in place as he high-fived Fred yet again.
Suddenly he felt off, like Draco was too far. The ache in his core was becoming more pronounced by the moment, and he let himself lean back against the shelves to try and catch his breath.
Draco knew he was getting in way too deep in regard to his forlorn unrequited feelings towards Potter. He knew he had let his heart hope too much, and once given an inch, his heart dove for a mile. He was letting his gaze, his hands, and his thoughts linger much too long on green eyes, soft skin, and unreciprocated feelings. He wasn’t sure if the bond was making it harder on him, after all, he had lived with these feelings for quite some time now, albeit, unhealthily but he had still lived with them and never felt this out of control. There were so many moments he had to control his hands to keep from reaching out, touching, grazing that bronze skin, and it was so taxing to talk himself out of it that he had reasoned aggressively that it had to be the bond, if only for his own sanity.
He took a deep breath looking back up in Malfoy’s eyes before continuing, “It doesn’t matter to me who you were before this moment, and even then, who you were before this is what got us to where we are now in the first place. What matters is now, we can’t ever go back only forward, and I like this forward…with you.” Harry quirks up his lips in an earnest half smile squeezing Malfoy’s hand before reluctantly letting go and returning his hands back to his own lap.
After what seemed like hours of silence Weasley filled the void with another loud huff, “I feel like I don’t even know you anymore mate.”
“Let’s say goodbye to your aunt and uncle Harry, and then I’ll apparate us all to The Burrow safely,” Remus said with a small smile guiding both boys down the stairs.
The group had formed an obstruction to the entrance of the alley, shielding both boys from sight which in hindsight Harry was incredibly grateful for.
“I just want you to know that, I know it won’t be easy for you, for either of you…but you have my full support.” Draco felt his eyes widen without his permission, and silently scolding himself once again for letting himself get this out of practice in concealing his emotions away.
Draco didn’t know how to respond to Potter, so he stayed silent. He knew the other boy was right, they couldn’t be far from one another, and just the short distance from Madam Pomfrey’s office and Harry’s bed had been painful, he couldn’t imagine what sleeping down stairs for an entire night would accomplish. However, sleeping next to Potter in that miniscule bed was going to be a shit show. They would definitely touch, they would have to there was no way to not touch someone sharing that bed, and Draco was definitely afraid of how that could affect him long term.
Harry barely acknowledged the movement, moving only slightly to better entwine their legs and burrow even further into the crook of Draco’s neck. In turn, Draco rested his cheek on top of the brunette’s unruly head; breathing him in while running his hand through the strands of hair at the nape of Harry’s neck.
Harry’s mind was reeling, never had he imagined that Voldemort would take up residence at the Malfoy’s, of course, it did make sense, it was probably full of old and dark magic, enough to keep him concealed while he continued to develop his plans to ruin humanity as they all knew it. Harry’s heart ached and he felt the ache reverberate throughout his entire body, he wasn’t sure if the bond was allowing him to feel the pain that Malfoy felt, or if he just genuinely empathize with the other boy, he also endured nightmares of Voldemort as well, after all. Maybe it was both, he knew his feelings about the blonde had begun to alter as of late, and he knew that Malfoy was different, as insane as it was to wrap his head around.
“We all need to be allowed that happiness Hermione,” he said with a nudge towards the makeshift quidditch pitch.
Both boys were yanked from their revelry of snogging, doing their damndest to keep all their clothes on, lest be caught in a very compromising situation by someone from the Order. An idea even Harry didn’t relish the thought of, no matter how much he loved a certain blonde’s naked arse.
Both boys sat up to peer out into the direction the voice had come from and were met with the sight of three burly boys striding towards them sneers gracing their faces.
“I swear, you and this bloody Quidditch pitch Potter,” Draco said with a huff but harry could hear the fondness nestled into his tone.
“I do not have a lovesick face.” Harry let out what was meant to be an outraged sigh, but he knew deep down that Hermione was probably right, he could only imagine what his face looked like whilst he was off in a dreamland filled with pale skin, red lips, blonde hair, skin…
Draco appeared to be snapped back to the present at Harry’s suggestion, and promptly let out a noise of bewilderment. “If you stop now Potter, I think it might kill me.”
Since getting caught up in their tunnel, fleeing blinded hatred and inundations of rain Draco mused that he and Harry hadn’t really spoken about the change in their relationship. He could feel the other boy’s warmth blanketing his skin pressed up against him lost in sleep, body twisted around him like a vine, not that Draco minded one bit. He found himself lost in these thoughts early in the morning, when Harry was still lost to the world and not taking up all the space in his mind yet, at least the awake Harry wasn’t.
“You okay,” Draco spoke softly into the space of their kitchen, fingers kneading into his shoulders.
“We don’t have much time before someone comes to find one or both of us,” Harry whispered out. “And I desperately want to see you come.”
I hope you enjoy, I love all your comments, and kudos and I'll miss them when this story comes to a close!
“What are you two up to?” Harry asked a genuine mirth in his tone, and eyes bright as he eyed the pair of them.
Harry awoke the next morning with a dull ache that seemed to take root in his gut and reverberate through the rest of his body. It wasn’t at all like the pain he had experienced in the dungeons during class, but it was definitely unpleasant. Harry slowly sat up and ran his hands over his face and through his hair before reaching around for his glasses, finding them on the small table beside his bed. After placing them back in the normal space on his face he noticed that Malfoy’s bed was empty; ‘that explains the pain’ he thought to himself.
“I want you to know that I’m not apologizing to you just for Harry, although I think without him it would have taken me much longer. I would have still been too afraid to face who I’ve let myself become over the years. Regardless, I’m doing this now for both of us. You and I, I mean. You have never deserved the things I’ve said and of course we both know they aren’t true in the slightest. I’m sorry for the hurt I may have caused you, just know most of it was due in large part of my own jealousy. You are incredibly smart, so smart I’ve often wondered how you ever got stuck with Potter and Weasley as your friends, surely you should have been in Ravenclaw.”
And even if he wasn’t forced to face them during the day, he was forced to face them in the night when his mind took over. His subconscious found it fit to either force him to relive his worst nightmares at the manor or coerce him to live out his deepest fantasies, and there did not seem to be a middle ground. While sleeping next to Harry should have made this even more mortifying than it already was, it seemed the other boy had his own demons to contend with. Often Harry would cry out in the night plagued with nightmares that covered him in a sheen of sweat and jolted Draco from sleep. However, more often than not the two would wake each other, pulling them from their nightmares and huddling them together. On the first night they were keen to convince themselves as much as each other that it was the bond that pulled them together after the nightmares but had vowed to keep it just between them. The rapture of touch the bond elicited lulling them both back to sleep as their sides pressed together and fingers grazed each other. This made Draco both dread and long for night to come, he mused that while it seemed as if he and Potter were touchy feely already; again something they had concluded a side effect of the bond, the night paved way for accidental touches that each boy could brush off as being due to the lack of space their sleeping quarters provided, but made it hard to face one another in the morning without turning red in the face.
Draco nodded at Harry and let himself be pulled into Potter’s side, knowing that their time was dwindling fast and hoping to just let himself enjoy the small amount of time they had left. The only thing he knew for sure, was that he knew nothing. He had not an ounce of an idea as to what he was going to be walking into this school year, but it didn’t seem to matter so long as he had Harry. He’d made it this far already and knew that even if he could he’d never go back.
Harry glanced up and was graced with the image of a completely debauched Malfoy, and he was moaning around his cock without his own permission. Fuck, Draco was the hottest thing he’d ever laid his eyes on and he knew he was going to fucking loose it, his own eyes rolling back in his head and he hadn’t even touched his own prick.
Well, we made it! Thank you so much to everyone who stuck with me during the lulls in writing and updating frequently. I appreciate everyone's love and feedback!
Harry sighed, it wasn’t as if he wasn’t aware how bad the dreams could be, he had woken himself up in the night before with his own screams or been shaken violently awake by Uncle Vernon with threats of real murder if he didn’t shut up. Which reminded him that he was probably in for a vehement lecture when they went downstairs if Malfoy was right about the screaming last night. As Harry’s mind began to turn inwardly on a downward spiral on the evening’s spectacle, Harry was hit with the recollection that Malfoy had nightmares too.
“Come, old man, the idea that Harry Potter has an Invisibility Cloak is absurd enough on its own. Your assertion that rather than use it to sneak off for clandestine liaisons with his many hangers-on, he instead chooses to follow
Draco moves slowly, almost liquid, and sits his bare arse in Harry’s lap. He grinds against the bulge of Harry’s dick, lays his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry wraps his arms around the squirming blond, greedy hands roaming freely. “Harry,” he moans when Harry wraps a hand round his gorgeous prick.
Draco Malfoy is standing above him, and he's not quite managing to sneer - the loveliest blush is spilling across his nose and cheeks - but Harry's prick appreciates the effort. His hand speeds up and a moan slips out, drawing Malfoy's gaze to meet his own. He looks surprised, turned on. Needy. Nonetheless, he tries to imitate his usual self and snaps, "Hurry it up, Potter." His voice is notably huskier than usual.
Hermione sets her quill down with an air of finality sometime later. Harry’s attention is immediately caught, and when she looks at him with eyes alight, his own quill more or less drops to the table.
“That’s not very nice,” Hermione comments, avidly watching the movements of Malfoy’s hand. “That’s quite enough teasing, don’t you think, Harry?”
They don’t bother to respond. Harry is staring at the canopy over Malfoy’s bed and attempting to gather his wits about him.
Blaise wears a calculating look as he glances back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. Slowly, he begins smirk, and it grows and grows until he is veritably grinning at Malfoy.
Hermione and Malfoy share a very long look, but before Harry can break the silence with some inane rambling about homework, Malfoy abandons his shower things on the floor and gets back in bed. There is more awkward repositioning, and when Harry tries to resist, he nearly gets a knee to the groin. He lets them push and pull him this way and that, ending up sandwiched between them. Malfoy lies against the wall, half draped atop Hary. Hermione looks mournfully at her book, seeming rather torn between this impromptu cuddle session and what is clearly a riveting evening read.
Harry dips his fingers lower, slides them through her folds, gets them delightfully wet, and then returns to rub gentle circles against her clit. Malfoy tugs down his pants, thick prick spilling out at the same moment, and Hermione jerks in his arms, stuttering out a surprised-sounding moan. Malfoy clambers onto the bed and there is quite a bit of shuffling; these beds weren’t exactly intended to facilitate threesomes, more’s the pity. In the end, Malfoy is pressed tightly to Hermione’s front, face buried in her tits. Hermione’s right leg is draped over Malfoy’s hip, arms wrapped around his shoulders. Harry’s left arm is trapped and basically useless, but he’s still got his right arm between their bodies, hand in Hermione’s knickers, feeling her get ever wetter as she writhes, hot and sweat-slick, between them.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Say what you will about Ron Weasley, but even he would eventually notice that I'd finally lost my-” he breaks off, clears his throat. "Virginity,” he finishes, embarrassed.
Harry kisses Draco’s neck and face, everything he can reach until Draco is present enough to turn and kiss him back. They trade kisses back and forth for a while, heavy and wet with tongue, and then Draco pulls back to give Harry this
“Well, what is she looking for? One hopes she doesn’t exclusively deal in gingers,” Zabini intones with a delicate shudder.
That afternoon, Harry finds himself in the library finally delving into that book Hermione had handed him a few days back. It does more than give him an idea for his Charms project; it whets Harry’s curiosity about Charms that have long gone out of favor. It is far more engrossing than he could have imagined, and by the time he looks up, he realizes Ancient Runes must be coming to a close shortly.
Harry clears his throat, trying hard not to think about making an arse of himself, and clumsily opens his belt and trousers. Malfoy, apparently at the end of his patience, yanks them down and out of his way. Harry’s boxers quickly follow, and he feels a hot flush spread across his face when his dick bounces out, hard and ruddy.
This is about as much as they get out of Ron about her, though they wheedle him for information for a solid 20 minutes. Finally, he runs off, using Care of Magical Creatures as his excuse. He’s walking tall, smiling when he leaves, and Harry is genuinely happy for his best mate.
Harry groans involuntarily at the sight, and then again when Malfoy opens wide and sucks the tip into his mouth. He lavishes his tongue across the blushing head of Harry’s prick, licking up the dripping precome with a satisfied little hum. Harry would dearly like to make a pithy little comment about that quicksilver tongue finally being put to good use, but Malfoy dips his head low, takes nearly half of Harry’s cock into his mouth, and Harry finds he can’t say much of anything at all. He pants, watches Malfoy pull back with a long suck, and is only vaguely embarrassed at the lewd sounds that keep escaping his throat. Malfoy’s hot mouth descends again, taking even more of Harry’s cock this time, and Harry has to tear his eyes away in search of a distraction.
,” Malfoy gripes, diving in for a biting kiss. He sweeps in, all lips and teeth and invading tongue, and Harry just. Lets him. Malfoy’s kiss is angry, consuming, and really doing it for Harry just now. He feels Malfoy fist a hand in his hair and tug firmly, and then Malfoy pulls back to glare straight into Harry’s eyes. “You are
Ginny gasps the way she always does when she hears salacious gossip. “Harry James Potter! You’re unbelievable.” Now she’s really laughing. “Hogging all the attractive Eighth Years for yourself, I see! Suppose you think you’ve earned it, what with all that ‘saving the world’ business, eh?” She gives him a wink, and he gives her a gentle shove.
, she rolls and rises up on her hands and knees above Harry. She’s close enough to kiss, and he’s trying to remember why he shouldn’t, but then she’s leaning down and taking his mouth in a filthy kiss. She moans loudly, back arching when Malfoy starts fucking into her from behind. They keep kissing for a while, more tongue than anything else, until the force of Malfoy’s thrusts pushes her further up the bed. Suddenly, her tits are dancing in Harry’s face and he’s pulling on his cock again, sucking and kissing at them. Between Harry’s mouth and Malfoy’s prick, Hermione is moaning and growling and sounding very much like she’s headed towards another orgasm. Harry can’t think, is so turned on, fucking into the circle of his fist as he sees Malfoy’s hips speed up.
“It’s not that,” Harry says. He’s not particularly looking forward to the inevitable mockery, but it’s probably for the best he get this off his chest now. “Just a bit… nervous.”
Hermione looks up at her perfectly positioned book, perplexed and perhaps the slightest bit offended. “I don’t recall that spell being in the assigned reading for Charms.”
Ginny cuffs the back of his head. She ignores his sound of outrage. “Harry, you’re not the best at picking up on the subtleties of other people’s feelings. I know you’re dealing with a Slytherin, and a prickish one at that, but the best thing- the
Ron scratches his head distractedly. "Yeah, but. I'm starting to think that maybe I don't want her back?" It sounds like a question.
Harry should resent Malfoy’s deviousness, but ever since term started, all Malfoy’s little schemes have turned out to be very personally profitable for Harry. He’s starting to see what the Sorting Hat had meant about him doing well in Slytherin…
Inside the classroom, Harry takes his usual seat beside Hermione. For a moment, he's terrified that he won't be welcome - either because he'd carelessly come inside her last night with neither warning nor permission, or because he'd sat with Ron at breakfast not 12 hours thereafter - but then she looks up at him with her usual smile.
Draco hums, leans back in to pleasure her with his mouth, and pushes a slim, long finger past the tight ring of muscle. Hermione sighs, pushes against the intruding finger, but he doesn’t appear to be moving it much. He just keeps at licking her sweet cunt until she’s properly grinding against his mouth. Only then does he start to really finger her, twisting and pushing deep, and by then she’s already requesting a second digit. “Are you going to rush us every step of the way?” he grumbles, pushing a second finger inside her.
“Had enough yet, Malfoy?” Hermione asks, twisting her hand in a way that makes Draco’s whole body jerk.
It feels newly shocking, newly filthy to realize that Hermione is entirely bare beneath her uniform skirt. Harry reaches into the pocket of his trousers, touches the soft damp cotton, and feels his face flush a bit. Malfoy shoots him a questioning look, but Harry’s only response is a secretive smile.
After a blissfully uneventful dinner wherein Ron is particularly boisterous and debating Quidditch with anyone who will engage him, they head back up to the Eighth Year Common Room.
to be used by them like this. He groans and twists, fucking himself on Harry’s prick, Harry does the only thing he can: he gives Draco everything he’s got, fucking him with long, deep strokes, tells him what a greedy little slut he is. He reaches round, finds Draco hard and leaking, and makes him come again with only a few deft strokes. The spasming of Draco’s hole round his prick sends Harry over the edge, and he’s just aware enough to hear Hermione’s moans get ever louder as she comes in Draco’s delightful mouth.
“Okay,” she capitulates, pushing up toward Harry’s mouth. He gets the sense all she’d wanted was a bit of reassurance.
“Ugh!” Pansy replies with a shudder, either in response to the nickname, or Harry’s choosing to address her by her given name. Either way, she doesn’t speak again until she’s had two cups of milky Earl Grey and precisely one and a half scones.
“To be fair, it was a very good once,” Hermione answers. Draco lazily twirls his hand in response. “But I suppose I wouldn’t mind another,” she adds, taking off her jumper and treating them to the sight of her exquisite brown tits. She slips out of her skirt, now magnificently nude, and wriggles her way to lie between them. There’s so much bare skin sliding together, except: “Harry, those trousers, honestly!”
Weird, Harry thinks. He doubts his words could add to this situation, so he just strokes Hermione’s side, caresses her breast, looks at her.
Whatever Zabini sees in Hermione’s expression seems to shock him, and the words she mutters seem to bowl him right over. He stumbles back a step and nods, handsome face utterly dumbfounded. Suddenly, Hermione is flinging herself at him, pushing his shoulders into the stone wall behind him and snogging him soundly.
“Yes, yeah, lots. But it’s not like- ah!! Ah! Not like-” He means to elaborate: to tell Malfoy that he’s about to burst, that he’s so hard it fucking hurts, but he can’t. Mostly he’s moaning, and sighing, and thrusting his hips to match Malfoy’s rhythm.
Harry lay back, letting her lie on him and petting her hair as she comes down. Malfoy watches, eyes molten silver as he slowly fists his cock. “Roll over,” he tells Hermione, and before Harry can tell him to
Malfoy goes on: “You then had our customs hammered into your mind, given only the education deemed worthwhile by a council of ancient wizards, and will now graduate with a degree that is entirely useless where you come from. You can never go back.”
Mill whistles. “Impressive, Granger, congrats.” It’s the longest sentence Mill’s uttered so far, and Harry doesn’t quite get it until Hermione sits down next to Harry with a muffin in hand.
“As much as I hate to interrupt,” Hermione says, and she really does sound regretful, “we should probably get out of here.” When Harry looks, he finds her fully dressed again, but her hair is still gratifyingly disheveled.
He’s too worked up to go slow; he pulls out and shoves back in, hard, and Draco doesn’t object in the least. Harry tries to watch Hermione, stroking her clit with two wet fingers and rolling her hips sanguinely, but he keeps looking down at where his cock is disappearing inside Draco’s arse. His hips pump hard and fast, and suddenly Draco’s moans are muffled and Hermione’s seem so much louder.
Hermione sweeps in out of nowhere, though, yanking Malfoy’s head back by the hair and laying a filthy kiss on his swollen, pink mouth. From his position, Harry can see flashes of tongue, dripping spit and come.
Parkinson approaches just then. She looks perfectly put together, but she doesn’t seem to notice Harry and Malfoy’s presence until well after she’s taken her seat. “Mill,” she says, voice devoid of any tone at all.
Harry watches greedily as more and more of Hermione’s supple brown skin is revealed. When Malfoy is done, they both stop to drink her in, in all of her naked glory. She doesn’t shy from their gazes, instead nearly basks in them. She draws her arms above her head, crosses them at the wrists, and cocks and eyebrow at them.
“No,” Harry croaks now, still devastatingly aroused. He’s wondering if it’d ruin their friendship if he took out his cock and wanked with her lying right there. The idea alone should weird him out, but his prick twitches excitedly at the thought.
Harry rears back in surprise. He hasn’t used his bed at all, since that first night he’d slept in Draco’s bed. He’d not even thought about it, really. He looks to Draco nervously, but he’s already settling into bed, leaving a distinctly Harry-sized space open.
“Yes, quite,” Malfoy agrees, scratching Harry’s scalp gently and making him groan. “This is a perfectly adequate list, Potter. I’d be happy to lend a hand.”
He’s not had an incident of wild magic in several years, but he can’t find it in himself to be embarrassed. Can anyone really blame him?
, where the hell had it come from – and asks, “He? Surely you aren’t referring to Ronald.” She sits against the headboard, holding a weathered old tome and seeming only partially interested in the conversation. Because, scorching hot threesomes or not, she’s still Hermione Granger: ever in pursuit of more knowledge. Harry can’t help but smile at her, and she smiles back reflexively.
He’s not just saying that to console Hermione. He really is glad to have a life that isn’t just about Voldemort. He’s grateful to be exactly where he is, at this particular moment. He tells them this, and Malfoy makes a wounded sort of noise, and Hermione sniffs and for a while, they’re just a pile of hands and tangled limbs, needing to touch each other, needing to be near.
She and Ron are apparently done with their conversation. Both are eyeing him with concern. He feels a rush of warmth just looking at them.
And the truth is spilling out before he can think to stop it. “F-fingers! Your magnificent fucking fingers.” Here, in the dark, Harry can admit just how much time he’s spent admiring Malfoy’s long, elegant fingers. Wondering about how they might feel inside him.
Malfoy blinks. He’d got himself a bit worked up during his rant and seems to have a bit of trouble switching gears. “If she wants one, yes. The life of a Magico-archeologist is rather lonely, I’m told. I thought, perhaps between projects, she might like a place to come home to. This room is certainly an option. Or any of the others. Ours included.” He shoots Harry a questioning look.
, and she’s wearing nothing but her uniform skirt, and Harry can’t imagine what he’s done to deserve this.
At first, they’re taken aback. And then Blaise’s confusion turns into laughter. “Oh, don’t tell us: it’s
“Yes,” Ron blurts without quite meaning to, eyes skittering towards Malfoy and then quickly away. He frowns down at his plate, and Harry just knows he is unwillingly picturing exactly what Hermione has ‘moved on’ to doing.
Suddenly, none of this is nerve-wracking; they’re just two infatuated boys, eager to fulfill the fantasies of a brilliant, beautiful girl. Harry gives in to his desire and holds a perfect tit in his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze, swiping a thumb across her nipple. He leans in and gives the other a fervent kiss, eager to somehow show Hermione what he’s feeling right now.
She looks up at him, rather self-satisfied, and lifts her hand away from her cunt. “We were just talking about you,” she says, reaching up and unbuttoning her blouse the rest of the way.
Malfoy huffs against Harry’s collarbone, clearly amused by the idea that Harry knows a spell that Hermione does not. Harry shivers involuntarily.
It’s not so much that he feels he should apologize for the way he feels about a brilliant girl like Hermione. He just can’t shake the feeling that whatever exists between the two of them has played a part in the demise of Ron and Hermione’s relationship. Had Harry subconsciously sabotaged his friends?
“Me too,” he says. It’s obvious, in hindsight, that maybe he shouldn’t have shared the full story of his death and how close he’d come to not coming back. Might have been kinder to keep that bit from his best friends, but he’d had his fill of keeping secrets by then.
And then, beautifully, she undoes the rest of the buttons. Shows Harry her lacy navy blue bra, asks, “Are these distracting you?”
When they subside a few minutes later, Ron punches Harry’s shoulder, none-too-gently. “Didn’t mean to,” he mocks, but that just sets them off again.
“An orphan raised by an aunt and uncle who despised him. I’m not going to get into to the rest of what he’s been through; you know plenty. All I’m going to say is this: either figure out how to give Harry the love he deserves, or step aside for someone who can.”
, no,” he says, and has to bite his own lip to stop from saying ‘never.’ Once he’s sufficiently swallowed the urge, he speaks again, slurring a bit. “Feels so good.”
“What, Harry?” she asks, but Harry buries his face in her neck and fucks his hips in and out of her. He can’t speak.
The day seems to drag on. Harry spends most of it in an aroused haze, but as the designated time finally nears, he finds himself unaccountably nervous. He chalks it up to his own inexperience, tries to hide it, but Hermione isn’t just the brightest witch of their age; she’s Harry best friend.
Malfoy seems surprised to hear this, but only hesitates for a moment before shifting off of Harry. He misses the weight, the press of him immediately, but then Malfoy’s wand taps the waistband of his boxer briefs. The next second, they’re gone, and Harry shivers delightfully at the feeling. He leaves his wrists exactly where Malfoy had pressed them, imagining he can still feel Malfoy’s iron grip holding him in place. He spreads his legs wide, feeling a blush rise on his face, grateful all over again for the darkness in the room. Malfoy lies on his side, curled around Harry. He lifts Harry’s right leg, already bent with knee pointed to the ceiling, and drapes it over Malfoy’s waist, spreading Harry out even wider.
Hermione is still saying things about Malfoy – how sexy he is, how fat his cock is, how she wants him to fill her up with it, how he’s probably in the shower right now doing exactly what they’re doing out here – and Harry topples right over the edge. He probably being quite loud about it, it’s just that he’s coming so bloody hard, milking his cock, and he can’t really hear much of anything.
A low whistle sounds from nearby, and though he knows he’ll regret it, Harry turns to look at Malfoy. “Who knew Granger had it in her?”
“Close the door, will you, Granger?” Malfoy asks, sounding for all the world as though he’s fully dressed and completely composed.
“Fuck,” Harry breathes shakily when he feels safe to do so. He’s rock hard and has a wet spot on his trousers. He looks to Hermione, but she’s reaching into her bag and slipping a book into his hands.
When Malfoy finally joins him, Harry is enjoying his delightfully hearty meal with gusto. Malfoy quirks an eyebrow at the nearby conversation that neither of them can hear, but Harry declines to explain. They sit side by side, quietly enjoying their meal.
Malfoy stares after her admiringly. "Potter, why on Earth did you break up with that delightful young woman?"
Harry’s got very little room to move but is hardly complaining. Between the feeling of Draco’s cock nudging against his, and the feeling of Hermione’s sultry body writhing between them, he’s well on his way to climaxing. Mostly he just looks up at Hermione and thinks about how breath-taking she is, how incomprehensibly enthralling.
between Ron and Hermione, so he’s hardly surprised when, in mid-October, they begin to row in the Eighth Year common room. From what Harry can gather from Ron’s yelling, he’d taken issue with the fact that Hermione had been studying with Anthony Goldstein and Blaise Zabini in the library quite a lot lately.
And it’s probably just Harry’s imagination, but it sounds like Draco’s soothing, almost fond voice is saying something else entirely.
They've left the Common Room and are walking down the stone hallway toward the Great Hall before Ron looks around and says, “I think I’ve really cocked things up with Hermione, mate.”
Harry disagrees, vehemently. He unlaces and removes Draco’s shoes, takes off his trousers, and tugs him down to the ground.
When Harry emerges from the bathroom, freshly washed and mostly dressed, Malfoy is adjusting his hair in his (entirely too ornate) mirror. Harry hasn't said - and has no intention of doing so - but he quite likes the way Malfoy has cut back on the hair products of late. He's given up the severe slicked back look for a side part, and just enough potions to keep it neatly in place. His pale hair looks so fine and soft, and Harry can hardly wait until he gets an opportunity to actually touch it.
Her moans get this scratchy quality, like she’s on the verge of losing her voice, and Harry takes this as his cue to rub her to orgasm with a slick thumb. The move is perfectly well-timed, as it turns out, because Malfoy pushes deep inside just then and starts to come. Harry imagines he can feel it, hot and spurting inside Hermione’s arse, and just the thought of it sends him over the edge.
And Harry had been right; she had tried to feed him the second he entered the kitchen. Always asking him to taste something, try a bite, take a nibble and who was he to deny her. She interrogated him on whether or not he and Harry had been well fed and taken care of at the Dursley’s, and he was left with the feeling that she did not take to kindly to them either. That made two of them at least.
Harry couldn’t help but let out a laugh at that, “I mean you aren’t wrong; you are an absolute wanker but you’re my wanker you daft git.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile softly at him, he yearned to reach out and push his wild locks from his eyes, but he restrained himself.
Harry’s mind was reeling as he paced back and forth in the tiny space of the room he now shared with Malfoy, he wasn’t sure he could even really think about it as just his room anymore. The familiar ache of the bond had started to take form twisting his insides, creating a dull ache. Malfoy had only been in the shower for maybe ten minutes and he was already beginning to feel weak from the blooming pain. Though to be fair, Harry had taken the first shower, and had been hoping to keep the pain mildly at bay with at least a small touch from the other boy, anything to avoid what he was feeling now but Draco had hurried into the shower without a second glance or spoken word to harry.
“You go in first, distract Mrs. Weasley for a moment and I’ll slip in and sneak upstairs. Then once I’ve gone, tell her you’d love nothing more than to help her with dinner after you’ve taken a shower.”
When their eyes met again, Draco was taken aback with the desire he saw embedded in the other boy’s eyes, it made his breath hitch. “Harry,” he whispered, not a question, but a statement, one that conveyed a similar sentiment.
Then potter does something that completely catches Draco off guard. He full on grins at Draco. The toothy, eyes bright, cheeks flushed kind of grin that leaves Draco with that overwhelmed feeling that typically ignites the desire to retreat.
“Yes,” Draco grinned out, and followed Harry as they stealthily stole across the hallway and into the bathroom.
And it was Harry’s turn to blush madly. He backed away, holding Draco out at arm’s length looking sheepish.
They eyed each other for a few precious moments before Harry had him pressed to the closed door; hands pushed up the front of his jumper. He groaned as Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck hands clenched onto the back of his shirt; as if Harry was going anywhere.
So, Draco spoke, and he spoke without thinking, “I’m jealous of you, always have been.” Draco looked up at Potter and surged on, afraid that if the other boy spoke, he might lose his nerve. “Yeah, I know I’m fucking amazing and all, how could I, Draco Malfoy ever be jealous of the great and arrogant Harry Potter?” Harry interrupted, “Oh, and I’m the arrogant one, listen to you,” he stated with a hint of biting sarcasm in his tone. Draco lifted the corner of his lips, and sheepishly looked down to his lap before continuing more softly, “look Potter, you are a lot of things I’m not. I know I sound daft as hell, but I’ve lived this sheltered and controlled life. I look at you, and you are just so freely yourself, and people love you for it.” Draco wanted to finish with, ‘and I love you for it,’ but quickly surged on. “I just, I guess, I guess things are different now. This year has been shit, and I’ve just been trying to sort through it all without losing my damn head, and it’s made me different, I don’t know.” Draco trailed off a little, unsure if he should continue, but reasoning that he had already said far more than he should have on night one of their forced sleep over he surged on, “I just, I’ve seen and done so many awful things none of it seems worth it anymore,” he gestured between the two of them to insinuate their ongoing feud.
I am so thankful for the feedback I've gotten so far! I'm definitely inspired to write and to post more chapters for your viewing pleasure! <3
“Of course, I’m a bit bothered that you didn’t tell me about Snape, or the expiration date, but I understand why you were nervous. I couldn’t have been easy to do what you just did.”
The thin and flimsy material of Draco’s pajama bottoms left very little to the imagination, or in his own case left quite a lot to the imagination as Harry’s cock seemed to brush against his own with every stroke of Draco’s hand. Whether unconscious or conscious on Draco’s part he reasoned it didn’t matter, it felt fucking good and he couldn’t help but wonder what it would feel like for their pricks to graze unencumbered.
Harry let out a laugh at that, “I just mean can’t we just not be Potter and Malfoy and just see how that goes? Just be Harry and Draco, yeah?”
He felt a lot like Elio, from his alternate reality, he could relate to the way this character had quickly and without warning become completely beguiled by someone who he thought didn’t even like him. The feelings of confusion, that Elio has in regard to the intoxicating exhilaration he feels when near Oliver are one’s that Draco could narrate without having to think too deeply about. It also doesn’t help that Potter has stopped rubbing circles on Draco’s ankle, and instead opted to just rest his hand there in a soft grip as if not touching him at all isn’t an option. Which is making it impossible to give his brain the clearance it needs to fully absorb the story in his lap, so instead he gives in to Potter. He closes his book, settles himself into the sofa more comfortably, closes his eyes and gives into the feeling of just letting himself be there in that moment with a boy that makes his chest hurt in the most addicting way.
“Couldn’t have been worse than any of the others yeah?” Harry spoke as he rolled over onto his stomach, chin in his hands to hide what was left of his morning problem from the now very awake Malfoy.
Deep down Draco knew he was doing this more for himself than for Potter, but he didn’t feel ready to admit that to himself yet. Draco knew he hadn’t ever had an opportunity to be this up close to Potter on purpose, and for good reason, again, reason’s he was unwilling to fully look in the eyes at this moment. He was, however, willing to act on the impulses of those reasons without asking any questions, and with that last thought he sat up, threw his legs over the side of the bed and quietly crossed the few feet over to Potter’s bed.
Draco mused that Potter’s admission had earned another Weasley eyeroll, and Idly wondered how many they’d manage to conjure before the train arrived at Hogwarts.
Harry’s hands came up to frame Draco’s head for leverage, looking down into Draco’s eyes brazenly. Draco’s hands slid down the brunette’s back to grip his arse fully, pushing them both into a rhythm that left their breaths coming in pants, and had Harry’s forehead resting on his shoulder moaning into his neck as their cocks rutted together deliciously.
Harry was yanked from the inner dialogue he’d been having with himself when the pain nestled in his gut became sharper. He knew Draco must have been feeling it too, so why wasn’t he here? For the first time since his musings had started, he began to second guess how the other boy might feel about him, what if for Draco it was just the bond? What if the bond drove his actions, and Harry was overthinking the small touches, the midnight confessions, the startling action to stand up for Harry to his entire family? He couldn’t be overthinking it, could he? Harry thumped himself down on the edge of the bed he shared with Draco, resting his elbows on his knees he slumped his head in his hands.
Or maybe, it wasn’t so much that he couldn’t face his parents, but that he was just scared. Draco squeezed his eyes shut at that thought. Fucking hell, he was scared, of course he was, weren’t they all at this point? Isn’t that why Severus went to all this trouble, because he was afraid, afraid for him at least. Draco felt sure that it took a great deal to scare Severus, which was obviously very telling.
“For as long as I’ve known Harry, he has been one of the most fiercely kind and accepting people I’ve met probably in my entire life. I’ve spent most of my life thinking that he must have such a wonderfully loving family, a family that really supported him to help him grow into this amazing person. Then I came here,” he voiced with disgust.
He began to idly wonder if Fred was in on whatever Draco and Hermione’d been whispering about last night after dinner. He definitely wouldn’t put it past him, or George for that matter.
A few members of the Order would be joining them on their outing, and so it had both boys just a bit on edge. With that being said, Draco was completely and utterly unwilling to let that prevent him from purchasing Harry a birthday gift. Therefore, he and Hermione had spent a good portion of the evening with their heads pressed together formulating a plan to separate Draco from
Draco peered at Potter with his usual arched brow inviting Potter to explain his unexpected presence.
Draco broke away first, out of breath, he rested his forehead against Harry’s, eyes closed, hands cradling his face. He mused that the pain had fully dissipated, but the prickle of pleasure the bond also elicited had lit his skin on fire.
Draco felt slightly more comforted by Harry’s sentiment. He trusted Harry and knew that he would have his back when they got to the Weasley’s. However, it didn’t stop the churning and twisting he felt in his gut at the reality that he was going into the home of several people who really did not like him at all. Of course, he couldn’t blame them. He knew he had been a bloody wanker to the entire Weasley clan, and that his father spent more time than was truly necessary making trouble for Mr. Weasley at work. He knew his week spent there would include a lot of effort to make amends, and selfishly he wished he could have spent just a little more time holed up on Privet Drive with Harry all to himself.
Harry stood there, in the doorway of the kitchen for what felt like forever before he heard Remus clear his throat loudly, “Well, we best be off. Just thought everyone might want to say goodbye before we headed out.”
Harry grasped Draco’s face in his hands and drank in his expression. The blonde’s eyes were wide, cheeks tinted red, lips full, and his expression was soft as he reached up and wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrists where he cradled the boy’s face.
When they had both disappeared out into the hall, he turned back to him. “Malfoy,” he gave Draco a curt nod as if to acknowledge his presence there before proceeding. “I wanted to ask you about those books you’re always reading up in the common room.”
Harry watched as Draco’s face lit up with a grin, making it clear that he felt the same way. “Should I be worried that Weasley is going to try and murder me in my sleep?”
Draco let out another laugh and addressed Fred, “you’re not joking they’re insane, but very entertaining.”
Draco quirks his eyebrow a little more before tilting his head to the side and responding, “Why would you deprive Granger of such a task Potter, I’m sure she would be more than willing to list about 100 books that might intrigue the savior.”
From the moment they stepped through the barrier to 9 ¾ time slowed to a hazy sluggish blur that seemed to go on around him without any care in regard to whether he was a willing participant in its passing or not.
As Harry began to move and twist his hand up and around his hard length Draco found the will to move his hand from gripping the brunette’s shoulder to trail down his warm chest, to the button of his jeans. He wanted to make Harry feel the same way he was feeling right now, he wanted to make him feel just as reckless, and mad, and brilliant.
Draco felt his face heat even more as he watched her let out a curt laugh and pat him on the shoulder. “Please, call me Molly, dear.” And without another word she led him into the house with her hand tucked up under his arm. He knew despite her acknowledgment he would always refer to her as Mrs. Weasley until the end of time, as she was truly someone to be revered in all the kindest ways.
And just when Harry thought he truly could handle no more, Draco rolled them both so that gray eyes were looking down at him from under silver fringe and his body was wedged between Harry’s thighs in a way that allowed Harry to feel just how hot Draco Malfoy was for him. It was his turn to groan and pull Draco’s mouth to his hungrily one hand sliding behind Draco’s head and winding through his hair, and the other hair sliding down his back, and up underneath his shirt skimming over all Draco’s soft and ultra-sensitive skin before clasping onto his shoulder to anchor him.
Draco descended on the other boy’s nipple then, sucking and lapping at it with his tongue, nipping and pulling on it with his teeth. He got lost in the gasps, and groans, and heavy breathing coming from Harry letting them wrap around him and push his inhibitions, and his fears aside.
If possible, her smile grew in size, “How many times must I tell you, it’s Molly, and no – everything is quite finished. You just take this out to the table and settle in dear.” With that she handed him a large salad bowl and ushered him through the door and into the dining room.
But Draco wanted more, he wanted anything Harry would give him, he was high on the boy beneath him, who had precipitously started thrusting up against him, and suddenly Draco could feel just how badly Harry wanted him. It made him so hot and shaky he let out what felt like an involuntary groan and without thinking thrust back against Harry’s own equally hard cock. With that, both boys were done, any attempt at holding back was lost and they were kissing and touching with abandon. Draco let out another shaky moan as both boys rutted against each other and buried his face in Harry’s neck breathing heavily in the other boy’s ear.
They were set to leave tomorrow, to neither of their complete excitement. They’d spent the last two days since receiving Hermione’s letter, skin to skin, breathing each other in as deeply as they could. Draco caught himself constantly replaying a chant of Tuesdays in his mind.
Harry was lost in the depths of his mind, reeling over the fact that he’d never found himself so enthralled by someone, and wild with the fact that it was
As much as he would have loved to draw it out, drive Draco mad, he knew they didn’t have the time and if he wanted this it would have to be quick.
Draco watched Harry get pulled into a conversation with Ginny, the youngest Weasley, and his eyes lured away. Draco looked around the table and felt incredibly taken with how easy everyone seemed. They all seemed so content and at ease in the company of one another, and that was something he hadn’t experienced anywhere other than Hogwarts. Dinners at the manor were nothing like this and were much quieter indeed.
“Happy Birthday Harry,” he said with a whisper trailing his fingers down the brunette’s bronze cheek, causing the other boy to shiver, and his lips to part.
“I don’t want to hide,” Draco announced suddenly and almost without his own permission. He let out another deep breath, “I mean…I don’t want to pretend at least.”
He absentmindedly reasoned with himself that the fact that he was only experiencing a dull ache meant that Harry hadn’t really gone that far, which was comforting. He knew he was in deep, too deep maybe. He was frustrated with himself; he could tell Harry James Potter that he was in love with him, and waltz around Surrey hand in hand like nothing else mattered but he couldn’t face his parents.
Malfoy paused a second before continuing, and Harry didn’t dare speak, he knew Malfoy was on the brink of something, a realization, a confession, Harry didn’t know but he wasn’t going to stand in his way.
Harry watched as Draco’s gray eyes scanned the letter, his facial expressions giving nothing away other than the fact that he was deeply interested in what it had to say. After a few moments it was Harry’s turn to don the look of trepidation as he awaited Draco’s thoughts.
“Of course, that’s not the only reason though Ron. I need you to understand that. Draco’s different, and he’s different because he wants to be not just because of me. This all just sort of happened, it’s not like he or I asked to be in this position. But I won’t lie and say I’m unhappy with the result…This summer has been the best one of my life, you know what summers are like for me.”
“Hey, queers!” Dudley yelled, laughing and nudging the other two boys as they laughed along beside him. Draco and Harry remained silent, but Draco could feel the anger and hatred Potter felt for his cousin coming off him in waves from beside him.
. Whispering promises in the dark wrapped in the sheets, tangled in each other, bodies pressed close.
After a couple of weeks, Harry resolved it his mission to befriend Malfoy; a task that had Hermione rolling her eyes and Ron suggesting the hospital wing. Either way, it didn’t matter to Harry, it never had. There was something about the blonde haired, gray eyed boy that always kept him intrigued.
. Yes, he was gorgeous any day; coming home from a long day at work clothes rumpled and eyes tired, lounging on their sofa with a book eyes focused and lip nestled between his teeth in thought, and sleep rumpled as he was now. Only now, his cheeks were flushed, his lips a deep red, and his eyes wide fixated on him.
It wasn’t as if he were unhappy about his new realization of fond feelings for Draco, it’s just, he didn’t know what that meant about himself. Was he gay?
If he was being honest, he didn’t even want to consider the thought. He wanted to believe that Hermione would never ask him to do something like that, especially since she definitely knew how he felt about Draco now. He also knew that he needed to be honest with himself and admit that there was the other possibility that she would tell him he was fucking mad and should probably consider checking himself into St. Mungos.
He didn’t let himself dwell on it, he had something much more important to focus his attention on at the moment. He licked his lips and looked at Draco expectantly still waiting for his response. Harry began to worry his bottom lip as the silence stretched on, “I’m sorry, this is a lot. Should we stop?” Harry asked softly, trying to search Draco’s face for answers.
He couldn’t take it anymore, he knew he needed to confide in someone, the only rational person on the planet he could think of was Hermione. He knew she would never judge him, she only wanted what was best for him and he knew deep down he could trust her with this. Sure, Ron was his best mate, but he felt certain his brain would implode if he confessed even a small portion of how he’d passed the time with Draco that summer.
“Well Potter, again, you’re in luck. Fancy spending your birthday with me back at the shops, maybe we could go to the theatre again, yeah?” Malfoy asked him with a face so soft and bright that all Harry could do was smile in response, and he realized that he was finding it incredibly difficult to keep himself from reaching a hand out to trail his fingertips down the softness of the other boys cheek, and then promptly felt his face begin to heat as his eyes were filled up with stormy gray.
The brunette groaned and nuzzled further into the blonde which had really not been a part of his plan. Either way, he trailed his hand through Harry’s very messy sleep ridden hair and across his soft cheek. He’d never get over how incredibly gorgeous the git was it made him smile a little to himself.
Her gaze unknowingly, or perhaps knowingly on her part revealed that she could see right through him, as he’d already guessed she would. She tilted her head at him, as if to analyze him before choosing her response carefully.
Draco felt as if he were holding his breath, breathing felt too loud in the silence that stretched across the room. He wondered if maybe they were having another non-verbal conversation, or if Harry’d just shocked Weasley speechless, which could be proven a real talent as he never seemed to shut up in Draco’s opinion.
Draco was feeling a sort of relaxed restlessness that he couldn’t really define. All Draco had wanted to accomplish that day was to make Harry feel special, and after the theatre, and the walk, and dinner, he couldn’t help but feel like the occasion was lacking something. He knew part of his trepidation was due to the fact that he had be unable to give Harry an actual birthday present.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry met Malfoy’s gray gaze and returned his statement like question with a soft smile before speaking, “Why not, Malfoy?”
Harry was hesitant to rupture the balance the two had seemed to contrive within the first couple of months at school, but he was even more eager for more. Harry knew he had to do something when he found himself spending much more time than he’d like to admit thinking about what Malfoy might be reading, or what he might think about in his spare time, or why he vanished off to his room every time their game became too much. His craving and his curiosity in the new relaxed Malfoy was stronger than his fear of tipping the balance on what they currently had, which Harry didn’t even truly know how to define.
Please note that I have agonized over this chapter for what feels like forever. This letter to Hermione kept me up at night sometimes. I know I've said before that I sometimes struggle to write Harry, and this was definitely one of those moments. I just want to give his character the substance he deserves and write him in an authentic way...either way, it doesn't matter now! I've posted the chapter, it's done, no take-backs! :)
In that moment neither of them needed words. They knew, Draco knew deep down that even if Harry hadn’t said it explicitly, he loved Draco. The thought alone had his heart beating madly inside his chest, and his breathing coming out in pants. It all felt like so much, the bond was prickling underneath his skin, deep inside his veins and the fact that he was already so irrevocably in love with the boy tucked away in his arms had him feeling as if on the edge of a cliff, but damn he wanted to fucking jump.
Harry didn’t speak he merely coiled around Draco like a snake, wrapping all of his warm limbs and slivers of skin along his. Draco was helpless against Harry’s touch and could do nothing more than bury his face in the crook of his neck and breath the other boy in.
They had grown so apt at non-verbal communication, and Draco knew that Harry was missing him as well. He clasped their fingers together, and let his eyes fall closed to the quiet sounds of Harry’s soft breathing.
This was something he’d discovered over the last few days that he really liked about Draco; he always kept him on his toes. And while Harry was pretty sure he knew the other boy in ways no one else did, he also knew he had so much more to learn and he was so tightly coiled around the blonde’s finger all he wanted to do was learn; in every single way.
Why would Snape go to all this trouble for him just for one measly summer; although the summer had been anything but measly, it had been incredible, but that was a thought better stored away at the given moment. Wasn’t the point of this summer to get him to see the light? Of course, breathless nights, hands down Potter’s jeans, eyes squeezed shut trying not to come in his own pants as the brunette panted breathy moans into his neck probably wasn’t how Severus had intended to sway him over to the resistance, Draco thought with almost an audible laugh.
Harry moved his hands down along the other boy’s bare thighs, he could feel Draco’s arousal aptly straining against the thin material of his pants. Draco moaned openly, forehead pressing against Harry’s. When he dared to open his eyes, he was engulfed in gray, could almost feel the waves of Draco’s eyes crashing over him. It was almost too much, almost.
Draco’s heart leapt. He couldn’t even stop the dopey grin that crept onto his face at Harry’s admission.
“Harry, dear, do take care of our Draco – and be sure to bring him home with you for the holidays, I won’t hear any disagreement on that.”
In the spirt of full disclosure, he hadn’t been entirely sure where they’d been headed Harry had only known that he’d wanted to get the blonde alone. The closer they got to the pitch; Harry began searching around for anywhere that was at least semi-private. Knowing full well that there was a chance someone was seeing them from one of the Burrow’s various windows at that very moment. Harry’s eyes hit the storage shed where the Weasley’s kept their brooms and Quidditch gear, and quickly glanced back towards the house hoping that the shed would be enough of an obstruction from prying eyes.
“You tell me,” Harry spoke with only a hint of crossness in his voice but daring to reallocate his gaze back over to Malfoy. Harry didn’t really talk to anyone about his dreams, not even Ron or Hermione. It wasn’t that he was ashamed of them, it was more that he didn’t know how to process them. He also knew that his friends would only worry, and they wouldn’t really be able to understand what it was like to relive his Godfather’s death every night, or Cedric’s death, or see inside Voldemort’s twisted mind. Harry didn’t have the energy to try and explain it to them, so he tended to avoid it, and he wondered if he was going to have to derive some way to change the course of this conversation with Malfoy because it seemed to be dangerously veering in that direction.
“I’ll have to wear your sweaters around the house more often yeah,” Draco whispered into their shared space.
Harry smiled at Draco, patting his thigh gently as he leaned back, “lift up darling” he spoke softly. Draco complied and Harry pulled the saturated piece of fabric off and admired the blonde’s leaking cock. The head was an angry red, probably angry with Harry for all the teasing, but it didn’t matter he was about to rectify that.
Harry knew that both boys had a lot to face, that their relationship would never be easy, but he also knew that it would never be boring and that he had never wanted something to last so fiercely. Tomorrow they would have to face Ron and Hermione, then possibly Draco’s mum, then the rest of the wizarding world. However, he knew they had time, they didn’t have to rush, and that honestly none of it really mattered as much as holding the boy in his arms. They belonged to one another now, and Harry knew that he was more than okay with that, and the thought would always leave him aching and desperate for the silver haired boy who had once been his enemy.
While, it wasn’t so difficult to fall in with the other Weasley boys who seemed to possess a similar sense of humor, it didn’t shake the bundle of anxiety that had been steadily forming in his stomach all day. He didn’t want to say the wrong thing or make an arse of himself as he had been so apt at doing in the past. For the first time in his entire life he wanted to work at letting people in instead of immediately freezing them out with his cold callousness.
Harry wonders what’s come over him as he exits the charms room and hurries to catch up with Ron and Hermione after class. He knows he’ll find them in the dining hall for lunch as Ron is nothing if not dedicated to meal times. Harry spends his walk wondering if breaching their reticent relationship with words was a mistake. It’s only that he finds a soothing comfort in knowing he can look up in the common room over to Malfoy’s nook and see him at ease absorbed into an alternate reality, or even look up into that corner only to find silver eyes gazing back at him and be reminded that some things never change.
Before Harry could fully process what was happening, he was being pulled by Fred into Quality Quidditch Supplies as he watched Hermione pull Draco further into Diagon Alley away from him.
As he pulled away, he let a smile creep to his face as he stopped to appreciate Draco’s dopey grin, before taking his arm and pulling him from the kitchen without looking back.
Harry had his arm up Draco’s shirt and he was grasping onto his shoulder as though his life depended on it, and the room was filled with little gasps, and keening sounds, and Draco never knew if the sounds belonged to him or Harry, he only knew that they were both guilty, not that he was complaining about it.
He pulled the button of Harry’s jeans free, eyes never leaving his face as he pushed the fabric down just enough to free his cock and wrap his fingers snugly around the warmth. He watched as Harry let his head fall between his shoulders and let out a guttural moan, dark fringe tickling the skin along Draco’s collarbone.
“I’m coming,” and before he could finish his thought on friction Draco was coming down his throat and fuck if he was doing his very best to swallow it. He quickly palmed his cock through his jeans and glanced up at Draco who was lost in orgasmic bliss.
“Me too Potter,” Draco spoke his face full of sincerity without his consent. As the two boys locked eyes for a moment, Potter dared grace him with a full-on grin before continuing, “so let’s not be angry, let’s just have these two months of nothing before we both have to go back to being barmy all the time, yeah?”
“I feel better after visiting them,” he admitted. “Ron and Hermione came with me and I told them all about our friendship. They seemed to understand.”
