“Please. Please listen to me, Draco. I’m trying to explain something here. I saw what he did to you. The way you were treated. It was horrific to watch, I can’t even imagine what it was like for you… And Crowson,” he laughed incredulously, “that
– solid. Malfoy was squirming about too. Harry looked down at him, expecting to be met by a look of discomfort, or revulsion or… well, anything
, that kind of thing. I ignored it, but it got stronger and stronger, and it made me… curious. Then it was the same thing inside:
Draco smiles hesitantly, moves to lace their fingers together. “It’s fine. Look, I – I hope I’m not overstepping the mark here, and this is possibly the worst idea I’ve ever had, but I can’t leave without asking. I’d like to see you again, Harry. Do you think, could we –?”
Squashed on a hard bench in the cold, unsettling atmosphere of the courtroom, Hermione’s introductory speech – which Draco had heard at least five times already – seemed to drag on endlessly, as Lee grew ever more tense beside him. It was fairly excruciating for Draco too, as he tried with all his might to avoid sneaking glances over at the benches opposite where Harry was sat. Well, no more than every couple of minutes, anyway.
rather full at the moment…” Draco teased, patting Neville on the shoulder. “Visit whenever you’d like. Anyway, you’ll want to bring the book back at some point. Just Owl me.”
“Not bad,” said Harry, still recumbent, chin resting on his broom-handle. “I’d give you a… six out of ten.”
“Morning, Potter,” said Malfoy, blearily, wheeling around slowly to face Harry. In the woods below, an obnoxiously noisy dawn chorus had begun, and behind them the sun was just peeking over the horizon, reflecting gold off the sleep-tousled mess of Malfoy’s hair. The scene evoked images of lazy mornings spent in bed – of waking up to Malfoy’s sheepish, fond expression, of cups of tea, and long kisses, and teasing out tangles with his fingertips. It was toe-curlingly suggestive, and Harry could only take a deep breath, and pray that Malfoy’s
Potter set the chopping board down, looking thoroughly unconvinced. Draco swallowed. “How’s… er,  Will, wasn’t it? How’s he coping?”
As if reading Draco’s mind, Harry’s face suddenly darkened with suspicion. The match programme curled in his hand as he tightened his grip. “How did you find me?”
Draco hadn’t been wrong about Gryffindors running in packs. Word must have gotten out that he was on good terms with Neville and Potter, because it felt like every time he turned around there was another Gryffindor in his shop. The
ing bowls and cups, sending them flying over towards the cupboards as Hannah frantically pointed left and right.
“So,” said Harry as they arrived, leaning back against Draco’s front window, not quite meeting his eye.  “Has anything changed?”
“Why not, though?” Lee’s voice was muffled through several layers of wool, as they hurried carefully down the freezing cobblestones of Diagon Alley. Draco was wearing his thickest winter cloak and Lee was bundled up in an endless blue knit scarf, her golden curls pinned high on the top of her head. He had cast a warming charm over the both of them, but it was struggling to hold in the sub-zero temperatures. Lee was clinging onto his arm like her life depended on it as she tottered precariously along the ice in strappy heels.
“You’re no good to anyone in this state. Look, I’ll at least get you a Calming Draught, I’m pretty sure I’ve got one here somewhere…” He let go of Draco’s shoulder, aiming his hand in the direction of his office. Panicked, Draco grabbed at his arm.
“Draco. He was really into you, for years. I mean, he spent six months working on reforming the laws about interrogation and fair use of Veritaserum – on top of his Auror training – because he was so upset by the way you’d been treated. That’s not something you do for just anyone.”
“Draco!” Harry’s voice was deliberately loud as he stepped deftly between the two men, grinning at Draco. “Glad you could make it!” He turned to Collins. “I’m so sorry, Mr…?”
Ron found it irritating. Hermione found it fascinating. Harry, to his embarrassment, found it completely charming.
“Half our suppliers have dropped us, the other half want more money, there have been complaints about the quality of our ingredients – one person even wrote in to the
mass of people surrounding him – this was too much. Too overwhelming. The bassline resonated through his body the way his own pounding heart regularly dragged him, screaming, out of sleep.
It went on for some minutes, Draco and Lee attempting to talk him down from his panicked state. As that memory finally faded, Draco felt emotionally drained, completely wrung out, already. But Lee pressed on, encouraging him, and each recollection began to come forth easier and clearer, like tugging and tugging at a thread until it began to unspool. The memories tumbled down towards Draco, slotting neatly back into place, until Lee just had to say something like:
Harry’s bedroom was modern – and clean – surprisingly so, thought Draco, given what he’d seen of the rest of the place. It was light and airy, all neutrals, with a framed Quidditch jersey hanging above a surprisingly uncluttered desk. Admittedly, Draco didn’t have a lot of time to inspect the décor, since Harry began dragging him directly over to the bed the second they stepped through the door, Draco’s neglected erection springing to attention as they pulled their remaining clothes off and clambered on top of the covers. Their kisses quickly heated up once more, and before Draco knew it Harry was straddling him, leaning down and mouthing across his chest. Harry took a nipple gently between his teeth, tugging at it lightly, making Draco squirm. In fact, he was so caught up, so lost in sensation, that it took a good few seconds for him to realise that Harry had stopped moving, and was staring down at Draco’s torso, his lips pressed tightly together. Draco winced – of course he’d forgotten the scars.
“No, Draco.” Harry smiled softly, slightly ruefully, faint creases appearing beside his eyes. “Merlin, don’t you see where I’m going with this? Worrying what people think about you, being a little… quick to anger, from time to time… I don’t think it’s all because of what happened, Draco, I think some of it is
“Is all this really necessary?” Draco murmured, his breath hot against Harry’s neck, delighting in the way Harry shivered in response.
. He must have looked horrified, because she sought to reassure him, before continuing apace. “Oh no, it’s not like
“Alright,” said Harry carefully. Ten minutes earlier they’d been on their way back from a raid in Bristol, both gladly eschewing the convenience of Floo travel in favour of the glorious early autumn weather. Harry had been flying lazily, drifting in and out of the clouds, shamelessly admiring the way Draco’s lean form shifted gracefully with every change in the air currents. They’d been halfway over Wiltshire, the sky turning pink around them as the sun started to inch towards the horizon, when Draco had spun around abruptly, calling over to Harry that there was something he wanted to show him. Naturally, Harry had assumed he’d meant the Manor – recently renovated, he’d heard – but Draco had carried on flying straight overhead, barely glancing at the sprawling estate below, instead leading them gently down to the hillside.
!” Harry grips the trousers tightly, clutches them to his chest as though he’s holding onto Draco too.
She ignored the compliment, taking a shaky breath. “Listen, Draco, you’ll remember I’m not good at all this sentimental rubbish, but there’s something I’ve been wanting to say.” She stared down at her hands, twisting an enormous diamond ring back and forth on her finger awkwardly.
and – and –” he turned, snatching a paper bag straight out of the hands of a man in a parka jacket and waving its contents in Harry’s face “– and
“Draco. Draco Malfoy? Seriously?” He could see the speaker now – a slight boy, younger than Draco, not long out of Hogwarts, by the look of it. Had Draco seen him before? He couldn’t be certain. But this boy definitely knew
on the weekends’ rule meant spending his Saturdays mooching around his flat, trying to process everything that had happened the previous week whilst trying to stave off the ever-encroaching anxiety. Most Sundays, he’d visit his mother for lunch, where they’d sit together for hours, and it never mattered that he didn’t much feel like talking. Other than the visits to the Manor, Draco never socialised outside of work, and he felt it was safest to keep it that way. Besides, he had no particular desire to see Hogwarts again, especially after the frosty response from McGonagall. Fortunately, Neville never seemed too put out by Draco repeatedly declining his invitations, apparently readily accepting his excuses that he was too busy with work.
Draco stepped closer still, boldly moving his hand upwards so that his palm rested against Harry’s chest. He followed it with his gaze, pale fingers skimming over soft black fabric, gratified at the way the rapid rise and fall underneath his hand belied Harry’s calm exterior. He tapped his fingernails lightly against the Order of Merlin. In the absolute silence between them, the clinking sound seemed amplified a thousand-fold.
The match restarted, and Malfoy quickly resumed his position lounging around high above the pitch. Ron was right: the comfort break had been anything but, and Harry’s body now felt like one enormous bruise – annoyingly, much worse than before he’d gotten off the broom. So it couldn’t hurt to allow himself a proper break, could it? And if Malfoy was having a rest too – why not have a rest together? Harry was very curious about Malfoy; he’d long since stopped pretending otherwise. And besides, on a more practical note, perhaps he could convince Malfoy to do another numbing charm. Ron had had a go in the break, but his poor attempt had left Harry’s arse feeling a little bit singed.
“I’ll do whatever you want. I’ll tell people – we’ll tell everyone, if that’s what you want. We can do it right now, I don’t care!”
, and if he felt unbearably lonely at times, and even if the highlight of each week was Potter’s short visits to his shop
Draco summoned the mental strength Aunt Bella had beaten into him during his Occlumency training, forcing himself to stop, step back, and lean casually against the front of his counter.
“Right. Well, Collins, I hope you’ll understand, I really must catch up with my old friend Draco here.” He took another step towards Draco, forcing Collins to shuffle back, scowling. “It’s been – oh, a while, hasn’t it?” He winked at Draco. “What would you say? About three months?”
Grateful for the excuse, Draco nodded, sombrely. “Oh yes, of course. That’s why I popped in. To see if I could be of any assistance.”
on a day Collins was coming, the man would check neither the lab nor the attic, swerving away from both at the last minute without comment, as though they didn’t exist at all. It was sweet relief for Draco not to have to hold his breath while Collins snooped around near the Disillusioned brewing
” through gritted teeth, before turning back to her paramour with a charming grin. Draco headed back to the door, sparing a quick wave for Seamus and Dean who had finally ensconced themselves at the Harpies’ table, and were both staring dreamily at Gina.
confrontations like this. He could taste the Firewhisky once more on the back of his tongue, the sharp tang making him queasy. He felt as though he were watching the conversation from a distance.
But, in the next instant, Potter sat down in the chair, expression neutral. Draco looked at him carefully, but couldn’t see even the barest flicker of suspicion in his eyes. He breathed a sigh of relief as he moved to stand between Potter and the Disillusioned
“Hermione!” Lee grabbed her as well, pulling her joyfully forwards into the hug. A bushy brown cloud filled Draco’s vision, and he patted Hermione’s back awkwardly. After a few moments, she managed to extricate herself from Lee’s grasp, regarding Draco with a half-smile.
even comprised anymore. He would need to make an inventory, and soon. Once his house arrest was finally over, he was damned if he was going to spend one more second in this cursed pile of bricks.
Lee had frequently come up in conversation over the years, and Draco had often wondered about introducing them – both women so important to him – but the two had never met. Since his mother wouldn’t venture into wizarding London and Draco would never invite Lee to the scene of her own mother’s murder, he’d been at an impasse.
reporter from yesterday. It seemed to go on for hours, and her smile was a little too bright for Harry’s liking, so before long, worn out, fed up and getting desperate, he marched over, grabbing Malfoy by the mud-smeared arm and steering him away from the protesting young woman once more.
Hannah brought him a big bowl of chicken soup. Driven by hunger pains stronger than any he’d felt in his life, Draco ignored her warnings to take it slowly, and regretted it very shortly afterwards. Hannah helped him to the bathroom; Draco was initially alarmed when she disconnected a tube from a very Muggle-looking plastic device sticking out of his arm, but quickly forgot as once again he found himself kneeling over his toilet. The lilting cadence of Hannah’s voice washed pleasantly over him as she stroked the back of his head.
had been a productive one. The future felt bright, and buoyed by his initial success he’d used his second Occamy egg and begun brewing another batch.
“Brilliant.” Draco thanked Merlin wholeheartedly for rebellious teenage girls. “I’m sure we can work something out, then. A trial, at least.”
Lee ignored him, eyes wide and amused as she looked at Pansy. “Oh, I know. That’s why he’s made me his business partner now – to compensate me for everything I’ve had to put up with. Or possibly to keep me quiet, I’m not sure.” Draco averted his eyes, awkwardly. Embarrassed about how much she’d done for him, yet unable to increase her pay, the decision to offer her a stake in the business had been easy. He’d insisted on drawing up paperwork naming her as co-owner, and she’d been surprisingly emotional about the whole thing.
“Mmm… something like that,” said Draco, levitating the scattered clothes back up onto the chair. Willing himself to stay calm, he raised a careful eyebrow. “How can I help you, Harry?”
-ing the plaster and dragging a bookshelf in front. He collected the necessary ingredients, all helpfully preserved by ancestor unknown, and carefully carried them down to his lab. Only when he’d laid everything else out did he fetch the first delicate Occamy egg. He set it down with shaking hands in the middle of his bench before stepping back, heart pounding, to check the ingredients for a final time. This was it. He’d read and re-read the brewing instructions until he was confident that he could recite them in his sleep.
. I hope you had a good laugh.” He rose abruptly, chair wobbling precariously, and turned his back on Harry, all at once desperate for some fresh air.
“Believe me, don’t believe me. Doesn’t matter. If nothing else, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t have accepted you if they thought you were underqualified. Imagine if you’d defeated the Dark Lord only to get yourself killed on a training exercise. Some PR
“Great. If you could let him know that the gnomes actually much prefer Mrs Farley’s garden, and would really rather he didn’t keep Stunning them and dumping them here, that would be fantastic.”
) whirled around Draco, making him lightheaded. He inhaled deeply to steady himself, stuffed his hands into his pockets, and sidled past a stone fireplace into the kitchen area.
“Oh, lighten up, Harry, you know what I mean. They’ll get bored soon and move on. May as well have some fun with it in the meantime.” As Potter scowled, Neville turned his attention to Draco, expression thoughtful. “Anyway, Draco, before I forget – did you have any luck with Brenton in the end?”
Crowson never finished his sentence. Instead, several loud bangs sounded; Crowson’s wand flying straight out of his hand as he stumbled backwards, out of Draco’s line of sight. Draco could hear more noise now; different voices yelling from all around. The Body Bind ended, and Draco rolled over onto his side, coughing, instinctively protecting his mangled arm.
is just about right, Potter. Look, c’mere,” he said with a sigh, whipping out his wand and jabbing it – unnecessarily firmly, Harry felt – against Harry’s arse. He whispered something, and Harry jumped as a cool tingling spread disconcertingly – but not entirely unpleasantly – across his buttocks.
Draco automatically recoiled, the words knocking the air out of him like a hex to his chest. But – he thought carefully – it didn’t make sense. There had been what, six people in the room at his interrogation, including him? He’d studied all of their faces for long enough. He’d have known.
– have. So, ignoring his inexperience, he braced himself against the wall, focussed on breathing through his nose, relaxing his throat, and pushing back against Harry’s gentle thrusts.
But as he stood at the top of the stairs, Draco could hardly reconcile those memories with what remained today. This attic, too, had been ransacked, that much was clear: the place was chaos. Parchment scrolls were strewn all over the place, along with hundreds of old books – spines broken and pages loose. Ink pots had been upended over the lot, rendering everything barely legible. A set of antique dining chairs appeared to have been swung against the wall, fragments of their broken legs mixing with large shards of what was once a Chinese vase. The oak wardrobe still stood in the centre, spilling its contents – torn silk and lace, mostly – haphazardly onto the floor before it. Was there anything of value left up here? Draco seriously doubted it.
Theo, on the other hand, would have to be dissuaded at all costs. The very last thing Draco needed was a romantic entanglement.
He doesn’t know who moves first, only that they’re both tentative – shy, almost – letting their hips roll together languidly, hands still exploring each other’s bodies, neither one attempting to set a pace. They last a good while like that, much longer than usual, but eventually, inevitably, they can hold off no longer; Harry leans forward to gasp his release against Draco’s swollen lips, reaches down to finish him off too with long, firm strokes.
, was quite another. He wasn’t yet able to concentrate for long enough to read more than a couple of pages at a time. He could barely hold onto the thread of conversations, or articulate his thoughts properly. Case in point: he had no idea how to explain all this to Harry, so he settled for weighing out a single measure of tea leaves into the waiting teapot and asking the question which had been on his mind all week.
Thomas cut in again. “Look, you don’t have to give me an answer now. Just think about it. You can let me know later in the week.”
“Sticking charm,” said Malfoy, with a relieved chuckle. Harry studied Malfoy’s face curiously, watching him send Ron a fairly awkward wave and a thumbs-up. He thought of the boy Malfoy used to be; of the man he’d become.
The mirror protested loudly, shrieking in horror as a swish of Draco’s wand sent it sailing through the air. Another flick of Harry’s wrist, and the clinical white tiles became a cool blue, followed by the towels, which also seemed to fluff themselves up under Harry’s expert hand. Finally, Harry turned back to the bath. With a commanding little click of his fingers the edges of the tub rolled themselves down neatly, and the vicious-looking talons softened and retracted, ever so slightly. The bath was once again plain white inside, its outside slowly darkening to a deep navy.
He didn’t even have to worry about making his excuses to Neville: no sooner had he wished him gone than Neville clapped him on the shoulder apologetically, explaining that he had to visit his grandmother for an early dinner. Distracted, Draco waved him off. His mind was already on more pressing matters.
“―that I’d let Finnigan finger me behind the statue of Cuthbert the Cowardly after the Halloween party?” She laughed. “I’d almost forgotten about that. Still don’t know what came over me, the lucky bastard. Irish eyes were smiling that night, that’s for sure.” She set her glass down on the table, leaning back to look at Draco. “Well, seems like my only chance at getting the good gossip is under threat of painful death.” She rolled her sleeve up. “I suppose it is the Slytherin way, after all. Do your worst.”
The tree arrived, as agreed, the very day of the party. It was beautiful, at first, with an artfully twisted trunk and tightly closed white buds which sprouted from its trembling branches as Draco levitated it slowly upstairs. But his pride at locating such a perfect present didn’t last long once he’d realised his short-sightedness: you couldn’t shrink living things, of course, and there was no way to fit it through the Floo. In the end, Draco ended up Apparating with the silly thing directly into Neville and Hannah’s living room.
“No! I’ll tell the truth. I swear I’ll tell the truth, and if you don’t think I am, then…” he took a deep breath in, “then I’ll take it. But I promise you, I’ll tell the truth. Think about it – what do I have to lose?” He rubbed a hand across his aching eyes, before looking up at Harry, desperation surely written all over his face.
“Er, obviously you’re an Unspeakable. But – uh―” Harry looked at Malfoy, who’d stopped perfectly still, and mentally cursed himself for opening his mouth before he’d engaged his brain. Why did this have to happen around Malfoy
“I think he’s telling the truth, Han. You know he’s a trained Occlumens? I reckon that helped him to control the effects somehow. Also, how many addicts have you seen who can brew their own potions? No chance of a bad batch, no impurities, no need to go down Knockturn and end up being recognised, or worse―”
There was even – and Draco had to laugh at this – a column speculating whether Potter had enjoyed same-sex relationships at Hogwarts, complete with photographs of him with essentially every male classmate he’d ever spoken to. In one, Potter had his arm slung around Ron Weasley’s shoulders (Draco shuddered). In another, he was nudging Neville in a good-natured way. There he was, talking to Cedric Diggory at the Triwizard Tournament, squeezed between the Weasley twins in Hogsmeade (another shudder), standing soberly next to Justin Finch-Fletchley at what appeared to be a funeral, and smiling at Dean Thomas by the Great Lake.
“Should you?! I don’t know. I suppose it might be too much to expect you to recognise every kid you and your cronies tortured at school. Let’s see. You stuffed me into a suit of armour in the Entrance Hall and sealed up the visor? Forced me to eat so many Puking Pastilles that I spent two days in the Infirmary?”
by everyone. He recalled dancing for half the night, and even his most innocuous comment provoking raucous gales of laughter. Last year, he remembered, he could hardly turn around without a witch or wizard trying to slip him their Floo co-ordinates. It might as well have happened to a different person for all that it resembled his experience this time round.
They finish the wine, and the fish, and this time when Harry leans over and kisses Draco he meets no resistance, only desperation and pure, unadulterated need. It’s almost, thinks Harry wryly, as though it had been
him to flirt! It had wormed its way into his brain; it knew exactly how much Draco wanted Potter – how often he’d thought about that stupid, stupid photograph, how strange and exciting it had been to see him in the flesh after so long – and it had tried to… help.
Potter shook his head. “Never mind that. What I want to know is how you can be sure it’s not going to – I don’t know – dissolve my leg or something?”
After hours of dancing, drinking, and making polite conversation with all and sundry, Draco finally grabbed the opportunity to slip outside for some breathing space. He didn’t feel tired in the slightest, running on a heady combination of
“Alright,” said Harry, fed up with balancing awkwardly on the uneven ground, and keen to get whatever this was over and done with. “Let’s go over there, then.” And before Draco could protest, he was tugging him forward by his jacket, the last few rays of sunset vanishing as they moved into the shadow of the hill.
A foot hooks carefully around his ankle. “Hey, don’t worry, I erased it. The guy there too; he didn’t seem to recognise your picture, but I Obliviated him anyway: safe side, y’know? And I’ve thrown up a few wards outside; nothing too crazy, but you should be able to cast Warming Charms to your heart’s content.”
“If you’re crudely referring to my sexual preferences, then I suppose you’re right. I have no interest in Ms Allegri,” replied Draco absently. The witch standing next to Hermione had moved, finally, and – Draco squinted – yes, it
“Very weird,” Draco agreed. “But it’s going well, so let’s not think too hard about it.” He offered Neville the plate of sandwiches.
“All right,” said Draco, uneasily. He finished pouring the tea, placing the mug in front of Harry and sitting down at the table beside him. Harry took a few careful sips, relaxing into his seat, while Draco sat straight as a rod, heart beating in his throat, insides shrivelling under the weight of his anxiety. Just as he began to feel like he couldn’t take another second, Harry’s voice rang out in the darkness.
Unimpressed, Draco rolled his eyes. She nudged him with her shoulder, the corner of her mouth turned up in a wry grin. “Okay, fine. Too soon to joke about it. Noted.”
Draco felt a keen sting of humiliation at the thought of Lee discovering the myriad ways in which he’d let her down. But, he reminded himself, they had told her everything, and she’d chosen to stick around regardless. Draco didn’t know whether that surprised him or not.
But the agent has paused on the first-floor landing. “Huh,” he says loudly, looking down at a clipboard. And then “huh,” again.
His Friday night trips to Old Compton Street, for example, were no longer confined to Friday nights. He made no effort to hide what he was wearing or where he was going either; strolling through the Leaky Cauldron in tight black jeans and not much else, without a single patron so much as raising an eyebrow. He never bothered with G-A-Y or any of the big bars where he’d have to queue nowadays;
“So what happened, darling? Was it awful? Only Potter doesn’t seem the type for a quick smash and dash. Not very Gryffindor, you know.”
Despite sleeping all afternoon, Draco still felt exhausted. How he’d get safely back upstairs was another matter. If worst came to worst, he supposed, he could transfigure something into a mattress and sleep down here.
“You’ll think me a fool, Draco,” she continued, “but I’d never really spoken to a Muggleborn. Our mother used to tell us all kinds of things: that they didn’t wash, that cooking Muggle food without house-elves made their skin smell. The Dark Lord always said that their bodies were weaker than ours, their brains smaller. I was ignorant, and afraid, and I’m ashamed that I never thought to question it. Worse still, of course, we passed our fears onto you. We raised you with so much hate in your heart, Draco. We let that man – that
back here, as are most of the potions.” He waved his hand above the counter, the air shimmering and bending around his fingers. “I’ve taken the precaution of putting up a permanent shield charm here, as well as updating the general wards so they prohibit the use of destructive magic―”
“Well, you won’t believe it, but he’s actually…” she paused, inhaling deeply. She looked up at Draco from beneath long, silver lashes. “Well, he’s a Muggleborn. He came to the Manor a few months ago… I don’t know if you remember, the wards had started playing up? Well, David owns the company who fixed them, and we began talking and… well, it was just a surprise, really, how well we got on. I told him I couldn’t… that I’d have to wait until I’d spoken to you, of course, but we’ve been Owling and – well. It’s made me realise, more than anything, just how… regressive some of your father’s… and my family’s… and, I suppose,
was working. It was quite disconcerting, chatting with Neville Longbottom as though they’d always been mates. As though Draco hadn’t once hexed his hands to his feet and left him curled up in Snape’s size six brass cauldron for an entire afternoon.
Potter sighed, accepting Draco’s hand and hauling himself to his feet. “I must be mental. Go on then.”
Malfoy stared at Harry, confused, for a second. Then, as Hermione watched, his mouth curled slowly into a watery smile.
Draco’s smile widens; spreads slowly across his face. The faint crinkles around his eyes deepen, and from this close, Harry can see more lines appear at the edges of his mouth. He aches to touch them; to trace over them with his fingers. With his lips.
Harry. Draco bit his lip, unsure whether to look away and lose sight of Harry again or risk being caught staring.
, Draco wanted to reply, but he knew where that conversation would end up, so he didn’t. “Uh, thanks? I really can’t. It looks good though,” he choked out instead.
had been either friendly to him or the kind of overly polite which seemed to stem from a deep dislike tempered by the potion. No one had ever made fun of him.
’s prying forced him out against his wishes. Make them the bad guys, take back control of the story. He can say what he likes, explain that the guy’s not his boyfriend if he likes – that should take some of the heat off him. Submit it to the
about you, ok? Are you happy now? You know I’m rubbish at this stuff, but I hate seeing you like…” Her words trailed off. And then, alarmed: “Oh God, you don’t have a guy up there now, do you?”
Narcissa was still putting in many long hours tending the Manor gardens, single-handedly cutting and preparing the magical plants and herbs for Draco’s use, and to his relief he was finally able to start paying her a salary for her hard work. When he’d first brought up the question of payment, she’d told him not to be ridiculous, that knowing she was helping him was quite enough reward. But the thought of her venturing outside every day through the harshest winter frosts, carefully checking climate charms and pruning the plants by hand made up his mind, and he ignored her protests. Besides, he knew, she would soon need money for new robes – for, to his mother’s great satisfaction, her social life was flourishing once more. Her rose garden had attracted so much attention that the prestigious Wizarding Horticultural Society had invited her to re-join, and she’d even resumed attending small benefits and luncheons with some of her old pureblood friends. Draco was pleased for her – hosting parties had once been her raison d’être – but knew very well what the other society witches were like: one tiny whiff that she might be in financial difficulties and she’d be ignored, ridiculed, or banished back to her lonely existence at the Manor. So Draco made sure that there was a steady flow of Galleons arriving each week, that Itti sent him the bills for any repair work on the house, and, as far as he could, that she wasn’t working too hard.
“They do?” You already knew that; of course you did. More than one student has asked you to autograph their textbook, after all.
, it would all be over soon anyway. He reached around, wiping the gathering sweat from the back of his neck.
It begins immediately, even as Lucius’ final breath hisses through his teeth, out past grotesquely parted lips. A soft judder runs through the bones of the place, the wards shifting and reshaping themselves around Draco. He tastes ash on his tongue. The lights flicker.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Sprout, proudly. “He’s excellent. ‘Course, it doesn’t matter if you’re a wizard or not, green fingers run in the Sprout family.”
All night long, he lay there, feverish, his mind drifting through memories and nightmares, indistinguishable at times, all filled with terror. Now he was in the place of Leonie’s mother, suspended above the dining table by Voldemort’s wand, Nagini slithering menacingly below. Now he was back up on the Astronomy tower, watching the lifeless body of his headmaster fly backwards up into the air before falling, as if in slow motion, out of view, as Greyback’s elated howls rang out into the night. Now, now he was trapped in the Manor, covering his ears as an endless stream of Howlers screamed accusations at him, piling higher and higher until he was drowning, suffocating underneath a sea of red.
“Come on, Draco. I don’t think it works like that. And even if it does, you know Neville will sort it somehow. He loves a project.”
If anything, Malfoy’s smile widened. He ran his tongue across those pearly white teeth. Harry’s eyes followed the movement automatically. “It’s a twenty-four-hour Quidditch match,
Well, if you say so, Draco. If you say so,” she said, waggling her eyebrows at him. Pansy’s apparent jesting had always been disconcertingly accurate – everything she said designed to provoke maximum reaction. The best thing Draco could do would be to play it down – hard when there was an Erumpent thundering around in his head. Draco schooled his features and tried to keep calm. Pansy wasn’t fooled.
is to live in the wizarding world. So here I am, I’ve been laughed out of a dozen shops already, and if you’ve not got anything for me either I’ll be going. I’ve only got an off-peak train ticket and I have to leave by 3.30.”
Crowson was on the grass, bent double with coughing and belching, slugs crawling over the ground next to him. He lifted his head, looked at Draco with loathing and spat a slug towards him. With a sneer of disgust, he shouted over his shoulder. “Seriously, Potter? What, are we fifteen?”
– of course it all seemed straightforward to her. She was also – for all her hard exterior – a romantic at heart, and right in the midst of wedding planning to boot.
It did, just about. Draco remembered using almost those exact phrases in a grousing letter to Pansy early in his house arrest. He was hardly going to admit to it, though. He laughed, lifting his hands. “Was that supposed to be me?”
Hermione stayed for a bit, smiling indulgently while Lila asked Draco about his sources for various ingredients, but was quickly called elsewhere. As she stood, Draco glanced up fleetingly after her, and his eyes were immediately drawn to Leonie’s glittering form. She was in an alcove, body turned away from Draco but clearly talking animatedly and gesturing wildly over her shoulder towards him. Directly in front of her, nodding along seriously, was Harry. As Draco watched, Harry followed one of her gestures and met his eye. His expression remained stern, and Draco inhaled, sharply. What the hell was Lee up to?

He blinked, forcing himself to look back down at the table, heart beating so loudly in his ears that he felt certain that it would be audible in a quieter setting. He could hardly think straight, and – not for the first time that evening – he longed for a glass of something to steady his nerves. Was Lee telling Harry what they’d discussed on the way? Was she warning Harry off Draco? He doubted it, but you never could quite be sure – not with Lee.
reporter, torn Quidditch leggings clinging to his toned thighs. Harry’s heart was racing, adrenaline and excitement barely keeping his exhaustion at bay, and he was still smiling at Malfoy’s retreating form when a hand clamped down on his shoulder.

Something had gone wrong. Very, very wrong. He definitely needed help. He needed to call Lee upstairs. But if she saw him like this – shit. He couldn’t even imagine what he looked like. And how would he explain things, if he couldn’t talk? She’d take him to St Mungo’s, and then everyone would

I just had too much going on, everything was a blur back then. What she gave me was comfort and support, but I mistook that for – for love. In the end that caused us both a lot of pain.” He inhaled deeply. “Draco, seeing you so unwell… finally having you and then suddenly
Silence fell in the room. Harry took another long swallow of tea. Under the table, Draco watched Harry’s toes curl and uncurl again in their socks. He scratched absently at his forearm, trying to slow his breathing, wishing that Harry would just come out with it, whatever
what you told me. But I spoke to Pansy and Lee, and – look, I’ve been getting a lot of mixed messages. And when you mentioned the party…”
“This was… surprising. Honestly, I was almost ready to come here and hex your balls off. Ron’s going to be gutted that I didn’t, but―” he shrugged, “you
Draco put Pansy off for as long as he could, but eventually he had to give in to her requests to visit. He hoped they could have a quick catch-up over a pot of tea, and so invited her over one Saturday afternoon, knowing that by then the worst of his
“Right? But all that ordering people around stuff, it’s not really me, you know? I don’t care about targets and conviction rates and all that rubbish; I’m good with things as they are. And besides… I mean, I like my job, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not my whole life. I work the hours I want, chase a few bad guys here and there, train up the new recruits – and I still have time to get to the gym, play Quidditch, even help out up at Hogwarts now and then. And then there’s all the charity stuff, of course.”
The room was set up similarly to last year: orchestra, and dance floor, and foliage all around. Only instead of beautiful lightly-perfumed cherry trees, this time there was lilac – only lilac, everywhere he looked – hundreds of trees and bushes giving off a sticky-sweet scent so potent that he could taste it. The charming pairs of bullfinches were gone too, replaced with great swarms of butterflies which fluttered about irritatingly close to Draco’s head. Their tiny wings flapping made him itch and the cloying smell turned his stomach as he surveyed his surroundings.
“Went straight down the toilet,” said Harry, ignoring Draco’s bitten-off squeak of rage. “I can’t say I’m exactly sorry about disposing of it, although I expect I’ve lost you some money.” A strong hand landed on his shoulder, guiding him to the rim of the bath. He sat, and Harry squatted down in front of him. “Are you going to be sick again, do you think?”
Draco landed in his flat, miraculously un-Splinched, and fell down hard onto his knees. Lightheaded from hyperventilating, he rested his head on the floor, swallowing down the bile in his throat. He focussed on taking a few deep breaths, berating himself for his stupidity as his heart rate slowly returned to normal. What an
And further up – much further, and perfectly alone – two figures hovered close together under the vast, moonlit sky. There, by wordless agreement, surrounded by Malfoy’s
It didn’t take long for Harry to spy the Snitch, flaring gold in the sunlight just above a cluster of beech trees. Harry drifted steadily closer, body tense, keeping a wary eye out for the flash of silver-white which would surely follow as Malfoy cottoned on to his change in direction. But no – Malfoy didn’t move from his own position hovering above the Unspeakables’ hoops, apparently nattering away to their Keeper. Harry allowed his speed to increase as he neared the Snitch. He approached it from above, his preferred technique. The air was still today, so still that Harry could almost hear those tiny wings beating. A burst of adrenaline flooded his body, and with a huge grin he dropped easily into a rolling dive, the gasps of the spectators echoing in his ears as he pulled up with the little golden ball clutched tightly in his grasp. As the score down below changed to reflect his catch, he flew a celebratory lap, fist held high, right over the roaring crowd.
As he watched, unable to look away, he noticed something else… odd. He’d had that lamp for years, always right next to his bed. He must have lit and extinguished it a thousand times, but… hadn’t there always been
Ten minutes later, Draco stood in the Ministry Atrium, waiting impatiently as a set of enormous ornate doors swung slowly open. Draco had, of course, attended many balls and parties during his childhood. He’d spent time with foreign royals, and with witches and wizards who positively radiated wealth and status. But as the Ministry receiving room was revealed that evening, he still found himself taken aback, unable to recall ever witnessing such grandeur.
and take in turn. He slid his free hand down and began palming his erection steadily through his boxers, concentrating on the sounds Harry made – the small, incredulous grunts of pleasure encouraging Draco to bob his head faster, to take Harry deeper. After a few minutes, Harry’s hips began to stutter upwards in time with Draco’s movements, until he was unconsciously thrusting into Draco’s mouth. Harry’s fingers scrabbled at the back of Draco’s hair as he tried to get better purchase on the short strands.
’d a bottle of Skele-Gro from the shop, wincing as it bumped and thudded its way up the stairs, then – still apparently intact – scraped slowly over the floor towards him. He grabbed it and stumbled to the bathroom, head resolutely turned away from his mess of an arm.

, but they wouldn’t fetch half their original worth. With the Malfoy vaults emptied by the Ministry – Draco and his mother were surviving on a measly weekly stipend – and the cursed house unlikely to find a buyer so soon after the war, the stark truth seemed to be that the fabled Malfoy fortune was all but gone. As Draco moved around his lab, ignoring the growing knot in the pit of his stomach, he stole occasional glances at the
He couldn’t help peeking up at the high benches as he murmured his reply. “Trust me, you won’t need it.”
They stayed like that for a few minutes, until the weight of Harry’s hands on his shoulders and the soothing cadence of his voice began to calm Draco. His blurred vision cleared.
Draco didn’t miss a beat, moving in towards Potter and raising his eyebrows. “Oh? And who says I’m planning to go home with anyone?”
Yes, this was the right one. This was definitely where he should start. Draco sat down, dipped his quill in the ink pot, and began scribbling. The words flowed like they never had before.
running smoothly through his veins, Draco pulled his coat collar up to conceal his face and exited the Leaky Cauldron.
, right? Harry had often wondered – after all, Malfoy did spend plenty of time hanging around Harry’s office, and he
They fall asleep like that, or at least Draco does: clothes and suitcases and too many memories scattered all around the room, their bodies curled together for the very last time. Shocked and heartsick, Harry lies awake until the first rays of morning light begin to creep through the still-open curtains.
“Your date?” Ginny’s eyes were shining and her voice almost manic as she shook with suppressed mirth. Beside her, Harry was still staring, transfixed, at his latest squeeze. His expression had morphed to one of dawning horror. “Oh yes. He’s over there, at the bar. Talking to – well, to you, apparently.”
“The last time I saw you, you were half dead.” Harry’s voice was loud over the running water. Draco didn’t turn around. What was he supposed to say to that, anyway?
You saw Scorpius off this morning: sixteen and almost your height already, a tangle of long limbs and smiling blue eyes. He has your colouring, of course, your bone structure; but as he scrambled onto the train, face shining bright with joy, it’s clearer than ever where the similarities end. Six times now you’ve watched Scorpius pull the carriage door open, slump down in the seat next to Albus Potter. Six times you’ve stood just metres away from his father. Just six occasions of forced proximity over twenty long years, and it never gets easier. Today was worse than usual.
Hannah was indeed in the kitchen, clad in a dressing gown and fluffy slippers, fussing at the stove. Detritus from the party had been pushed aside on the island to make room for two steaming platefuls of scrambled eggs. She glanced over briefly at Draco as she raised her wand, levitating a great mound of crispy bacon over discarded bowls of crisps and cocktail pitchers, setting it down atop the waiting eggs. The smell was divine; Draco’s mouth began to water.
When the knock comes through the wall, they’re so caught up in each other that they barely notice it, until it happens again, and again, aggressive and insistent. They realise at the same time, stumbling backwards half-naked, part horrified, part hysterical. Draco pulls Harry close again, pressing a finger to his lips, other hand still running over the firm muscles of Harry’s upper back.
“No, I have, it’s just―” Draco swallowed, suddenly shy “―what you said last time. I want to. Please?”
Half an hour later, Draco found himself pressed against the back wall of the club, head buzzing from the alcohol and the steady beat of the music, his legs like jelly as the Muggle’s hand worked over his cock with a relentless efficiency that told of countless similar encounters. Sex on
Malfoy’s eyes flicked downwards, and all further rational thought left Harry’s mind. He leaned in, nudging Malfoy’s dirt-smudged nose with his own and closing his eyes as their wind-chapped lips finally met. The kiss was gentle, hesitant at first, just a soft brush of their mouths together once, then again, and again; a culmination of the long night’s events – unreal, a little hazy, but somehow perfectly right. Then Malfoy’s hand came up to cup Harry’s jaw, and his lips parted, hot and needy, making Harry groan with want. He swiped his tongue over Malfoy’s lower lip, the earth shifting beneath his hands and knees as he tried to line their bodies up, to press even closer. There were little mulchy leaf fragments everywhere; the damp plastering Malfoy’s hair to his forehead and wicking up into Harry’s clothes wherever his limbs touched the ground. It should have been disgusting, Harry supposed, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Lost in the lazy slide of Malfoy’s tongue against his own, and entranced by the soothing stroke of Malfoy’s thumb behind his ear, he had absolutely no intention of stopping.
this place. I can’t go in the bathroom – there are probably potions in there, and I bet there’s booze in the kitchen, and drinks cabinets, and… I just… I can’t. Not while I’m feeling like this.”
like that, Neville, it’s – it’s more. There’s something unresolved between us – I’m driving myself mad over it. Harry feels it too, I know he does, no matter what he said last night. It’s why he mentioned the party; why he sought me out when he arrived.”
Still shaky with adrenaline, Draco fumbled for his wand, and locked the door. He Apparated upstairs, and fell onto his bed with a loud groan, yanking his trousers and pants down without a second thought.
Harry winced. He was beginning to think that perhaps he really shouldn’t have bothered Ron with the whole Malfoy thing.
“You know, darling, I almost wrote to you all those months ago when that article about Potter was in the papers. I laughed so hard – I would have written, I swear it, but I was never sure if your post at the Manor was being read. I didn’t much fancy the thought of some stuffy old Ministry official finding out how badly you mooned after Potter at school.”
Only Malfoy still looked quite calm – and annoyingly comfortable – mounting his broom with barely a wince. Everything hurt. Harry’s shoulders throbbed, his neck ached, his arms trembled. His buttocks… well, he dreaded to think. They were probably black and blue at this point. It was torture, plain and simple – not merely the lack of sleep, but also the need to constantly shift left or right to stay upright, despite Harry’s best attempts at stabilising charms. He cursed Kingsley, and Robards, and most of all himself for lacking the sense to ask a few basic questions before agreeing blindly to this ridiculous plan.
this fic from day one. I’ve been absolutely blown away by your talent, enthusiasm and professionalism; it’s been an absolute honour to work with both of you, and I’m so pleased you chose my fic!
had found him sex, and the kisses that prefaced it – sloppy, hot-mouthed statements of intention – had barely even registered at the time.
It takes a while, but eventually he gathers the courage to ask. “So, how long have I got this time?”
Oblivious to the chaos their arrival had created, over a dozen Ministry officials had now gathered on the pitch, smartly dressed, and looking – as far as Harry could tell – irritatingly well-rested. Harry and Malfoy reluctantly separated, straightening and trying to appear business-like. More cracks heralded the return of reporters and photographers, and Malfoy smoothed his hair down, self-consciously. He caught sight of Harry watching and huffed a small, embarrassed laugh.
Harry hummed cheerfully as he tugged his old Hogwarts robes over his head. He tied the familiar scarlet and gold fabric around his neck, and snatched up the Spellotaped glasses from his bedside drawer. He combed a little gel through his hair with his fingers – less authentic, perhaps, but it drove Draco mad – and grinned as he looked in the mirror. Perfect. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder before pausing, one foot in the flames.
A third voice: “Harry, think about what you’re asking Hannah to do. She could lose her licence to practice. All those years of training down the drain, and all for, well―” A long pause. “Don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re thinking, but you can’t deny he did this to himself. It isn’t fair on Hannah! What if we – I don’t know, got all the Healers to take Unbreakable Vows or something? Could we stop it from getting out that way instead?”
“Luna was just explaining,” said Lee, pointedly, “how Wizarding-Adjacent people still suffer from Wrackspurt infestation, even though they’re drawn to magic and they never infect Muggles.”
The Golden Trio were, of course, sat at the enormous head table at the far end of the room, along with what looked like the entire St Mungo’s Board of Directors, the Minister for Magic, and several other Ministry officials in formal robes. As Draco arrived, Potter, who was engaged in discussion with Shacklebolt, looked up, and their eyes locked for a second. Even at a distance, Draco could see the way Potter’s hungry gaze slid down his body appreciatively. Draco was fairly certain that Potter only looked away in the end when Ron hit him in the side of the head with a neatly-aimed bread roll.
it, Draco.” He licks a stripe up Draco’s jaw, fiddles with the ties on his pyjama bottoms. “Let’s go to bed, come on. You look so good, all serious and sexy like that. I’m really
Harry doesn’t really feel like asking, not right now. He looks over at the door to the building: he’s almost there, just has to sidle past a bicycle and a pile of unopened post. The air is thin here, his throat is tight, and all he wants is to get back outside, to walk far, far away and never return.
“Oh.” To Draco’s immense frustration, Harry’s tone was carefully neutral. Draco gently pressed for more. “What else did she say?”
Harry feels scooped out, laid bare; caught by surprise when at his most vulnerable. Viewing the flat had been a mistake; had forced him to revisit memories he’d long repressed, called into question every truth he’d told himself over the years. He knows he needs to rein in his emotions now, to hold some of himself back, at least until he knows what Draco wants.  But Harry wears his heart on his sleeve, always has, and he fears that Draco will have read his reaction plain as day in their brief meeting on the doorstep.
and Harry’s heating charms, they rested in comfortable silence. Harry let his head droop forwards against the broom handle, watching as a tiny dark shadow below – a pipistrel – swooped in neat, tight circles in and out of the trees. His exhaustion was bone-deep, their surroundings too dreamlike, and he allowed himself to grow dazed and stuporous as he drifted through this endless, shining, magical night with Malfoy beside him. Malfoy, who’d been sneaking into Harry’s office and sharing snacks with him for nearly a year now. Malfoy, who never seemed to answer Harry’s questions seriously, who had an endless supply of funny anecdotes, but who – until tonight – had clearly and deliberately held something of himself back. Malfoy, who Harry could never stop thinking about – hadn’t been able to since the very first day he’d walked through the door. Was Harry a fool, reading so much into all Malfoy’s behaviour today? Always, he’d joked earlier –
. His brown eyes were narrowed, his face flushed and contorted with loathing. He clenched his fists reflexively as he took a step forward.
was bound to throw up some logistical complications. Shortly after she started, Draco had popped out to Gringotts at the end of the day, leaving Lee cleaning the lab. When he got back, long past closing time, he found her stuck in a loop; she’d head towards the bench where Draco kept the
Draco relaxed slightly as she settled into the tirade. Stroppy, demanding Lee felt like familiar territory and – from what Draco could remember – was usually easily soothed. That other Lee, the scared, wounded child, was a different matter entirely. He sincerely hoped he never saw that Lee again.
Harry looked back up at Malfoy. What could he say? He could ask how Malfoy had slept, of course, or maybe point out Ron – that should raise a laugh, for sure. Or perhaps he could try for romantic, make some trite comment about the sunrise?
Draco furrowed his brow. Why was the house-elf getting all worked up? Someone should let her know that Nagini was gone now. Everything was going to be just fine.
, his hair fanned out across Draco’s pillow. The air felt charged, suddenly heavy with expectation, and before Draco could talk himself out of it, he reached over to cup Harry’s face lightly with both hands. Eyes closed, he pressed a delicate kiss to Harry’s forehead, the edge of that famous scar rough beneath his lips, breathing the scent of him in for possibly the last time. But as Draco moved to pull away, he felt a cool hand move to the nape of his neck, guiding him close once more, until their mouths met. Harry kissed him deeply and intensely, as Draco let his mind go blank, shifting closer to return the kiss. Neither one of them tried to take things further, and Draco was strangely grateful for the duvet in between them, content just to feel Harry’s warm body pressed against his.
Their cackling and wheezing continued for several minutes, while Draco glowered quietly, considering the merits of throwing them both out on their ears. Finally, Lee looked up grumpily from her cauldron, which was spitting turquoise foam all over the workbench. “Look, I’m really trying to learn here. In case you didn’t realise, I missed out on your years of lessons in this stuff. If you’re just in here to gossip, could you go out to the shop please?”
“Well, no, not really, I don’t. But I still shouldn’t have been such a snob about it. I know it was none of my business. And I’m sorry for ragging on you about Potter, too.”
“If I was you,” said Hannah, “I’d leave off for a bit. Don’t rush into anything. Have a chat with your Mind Healer, put in some real work to try and recover those memories. See how you feel after that. It’s all very well you saying he makes you feel safe, but I think Harry deserves something a little more specific.”
She rolled her eyes so hard that her goggles slid up into her hairline. “What d’you think? As if I’d pass up
To Draco’s horror, there was even a blurry photograph of Potter with Draco himself – the two of them shouting in each other’s faces after a Quidditch match, while their respective teammates tried to drag them apart. The caption read: ‘Harry and his schoolboy ‘rival’, Death Eater Draco Malfoy. Sources tell us their relationship was always heated, but was there more to it than met the eye?’
“Nowhere, now. Used to go to Aviemore Grammar, then after I moved in with my uncle I did my GCSEs at Southgate, and then I dropped out.”
“Go on then,” said Malfoy, interrupting his thoughts and leaning in close – somehow, one or both of them seemed to have inched a little further forwards than before. “What was the worst one?”
“I’ll see you soon, Draco,” said Harry, with a wink. A gust of freezing wind rattled the shelves as he pulled the door open, stuffed his hands into his pockets, and strolled out into the night.
Harry looked suddenly troubled. “Lee… Yes. Lee knows everything. We had to tell her. She―” he paused, choosing his words carefully. “She didn’t take it that well at first, unsurprisingly. But you know Lee, she’s a good sort, and she’s carried on working anyway. Neville’s been helping her with the ingredients and they’ve done what they can to keep everything ticking over.” He looked over at Draco, expression solemn. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it, Draco, things have been a bit of a mess downstairs over the past few weeks. Which is another reason I think it’s best that, if you’re able, you get back to helping her out. As soon as you can.”
The lab itself was in complete chaos, with outstanding Owl Order requests strewn over all the benches, cauldrons haphazardly dotted about – some far too close together to be safe – and a huge pile of letters shoved under a pestle and mortar at the back. Lee’s voice rose to a high-pitched, frantic thing as she’d explained how St Mungo’s had made an enormous emergency order of their salve, which she’d stayed up all night last week to fill. To top things off, Lee handed Draco an official Ministry letter – her hands trembling – which gave notice that they would soon be carrying out a long-overdue audit on laboratory conditions.
“Heard about it?” Draco scoffs. “Come on! Wasn’t the Lightning Model Five the fastest selling broom of all time? The US team are using it, you must know that! I’ve even got one myself –”
Harry, meanwhile, was considering Draco’s request. “All right. I’ll explain that, and then you’ll answer my questions.”
He wiggled careful fingers up into Harry’s curls and twisted them gently, enjoying the way Harry writhed against his hand. “All right there?”
nor Transfiguration, it turned out, can restore melted laminate. The smell of smoke had seeped into the curtains and carpet; had lingered for weeks despite a plethora of different cleaning spells. As Harry inhales, he could almost swear he catches a whiff of burning. His eyes flick nervously up to the little box on the ceiling, but it remains mercifully silent, blinking away reassuringly.
You’ve allowed yourself this – this single, tiny indulgence – for many years now. Always the first day of September, always straight after dinner, you excuse yourself. Astoria’s early curiosity has long given way to callous indifference, and her sneered
“Harry. Mate. You’re going to have to deal with it yourself, alright? I’m not interested in that quasi-American floppy-haired prick right now. D’you want to know what
“Suit yourself.” Harry pulled Draco’s plate towards him, settling in for round two. Draco delicately averted his eyes.
He buried his face against Harry once more, inhaling deeply, relieved to feel Harry’s body begin to grow slack against him, the tension melting away down the curve of his spine as he tilted his head back against Draco’s shoulder. Emboldened by this, taking it as tacit agreement, Draco kept going, forcing out the words he’d been building up to all along.
“I’m afraid so. I’m not used to all this – well, you know.” Draco looked down, embarrassed. “Anyway, I need to get back.”
fine!” Draco protested, voice still several notes higher than usual. “I didn’t realise that our breakfast room would now be a bloody gift shop, is all!”
all those years ago. They were perfectly pleasant to him and interested enough to stick to potions and other related topics which were firmly in his wheelhouse.
“Fair enough,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He looked around absently for his clothes, bending lazily to collect a sock from under the bed before giving up and Summoning the rest. Draco watched him, trying desperately to ignore the growing feeling that he was letting something precious slip away. As though the weekend had been some kind of wonderful illusion; as though Harry might go back to his normal life – surrounded by people who loved him, and doted on him, and didn’t hurt him like Draco had – and come to see this whole thing as one big mistake.
Harry’s words were soft, and Draco could tell he was smiling. He relaxed slightly, loosening his grip on the railing, working up the courage to turn around.
To Draco’s irritation, while he was inching down the stairs and trying very hard not to fall to the floor in a drunken mess, Potter – not a patient man at the best of times – had clearly decided he was being ignored, and resumed his daft shouting.
“Oh, believe me, I know. The heart-shaped box of chocolates over your dick made that quite clear.” He grinned. “Oh, Potter, don’t look so horrified. It was a talking point, alright?

convinced me to do,” Malfoy finished, his ridiculous accent getting more pronounced with every single over-emphasised word.
“Really, it’s no trouble. It’s no good for my head right now though, bending down like this.” He stepped back, waving Draco through. “Apologies for the state of the place,” he said cheerily.
, I let myself think that you were different. But I see it now, don’t worry – you’re just the same as the rest of them. Worse, maybe! You think you’ll make some big speech and I’ll fall at your feet? Selfish to the fucking
“No.” He picked up the pace, and she redoubled her steps to stay in sync with him. It was only another minute before they turned off the main corridor, and he started at the sound of a crowd milling around. Before long, they were in front of the courtroom entrance, amongst a throng of excited spectators.
“It wasn’t entirely that. I was getting tired of proving myself over and over, of having to work twice as hard as everyone else to earn the same respect. And the job was perfect.” He shrugs. “But I needed to get away. You weren’t exactly easy to forget, either.”
Draco took pity on her. “Pans, I… I’m really sorry about what I said before. I was hurting back then, and angry, and far too sensitive. I should never have reacted the way I did. I― ”
“Come here, arsehole!” she said, holding her arms out and pulling him into a tight hug. What little air still entered his lungs must have comprised at least fifty percent
Draco eased himself up, taking another long, burning mouthful from the half-empty bottle next to him. The pain had settled down now – was more of a deep aching sensation, and he chanced a look at his forearm. It no longer curved to the left as it had done when he’d accidentally glimpsed it earlier, but it still looked awful, matted with dried blood and bruises so dark they almost completely covered his Mark.
As he entered the room, lit only by the fire, Draco could only make out a silhouette hunched over the worktop. He stepped closer.
lead the way, until he could feel a steady rumbling beat, vibrating through the pavement, overlaid by excited voices laughing and shouting. As he rounded the corner onto Old Compton Street and found himself amidst a merry throng of revellers, Draco’s heart began to thud in his chest, jangled nerves only partially soothed by
To the Manor, next, where Voldemort – obviously unhinged – had made his home, and with him a den of bloodthirsty werewolves:
“As you can see, the living room’s a good size, with plenty of space for entertaining…” the agent drones on. Harry can’t help but wince slightly at his choice of words; after all, there had been no entertaining, not when they’d lived there. Harry had been so thrilled to finally be free of the press, he hadn’t wanted to take any chances of his location getting out. Draco, to his relief, had understood and hadn’t pushed him, not after the first couple of times he’d mentioned inviting over coursemates, when Harry’s discomfort had been apparent.
nasty, about ten centimetres long and jagged where it curved down the outside of Potter’s thigh. The healing skin was a dark purple with bruising around, and Draco focussed intently on it as he knelt down next to the chair. He tried valiantly not to let his eyes stray to the right, where the seam of Potter’s pants ran along the crease of his thigh, down towards – no,
That seemed to make things worse – Harry bent forward again, laughter redoubling. “Oh God. No, no, that was… sweet of you…”
“If you want us to be friends, Harry, I don’t see any issue. Unless―” He took a long, deep breath in. Harry had frozen, face still half turned-away. “Unless, of course, the problem is that Lee isn’t all you miss.”
“So come see her.” The effect was immediate – Harry’s eyes darkened, his face hardening. But emboldened by the setting, by the soft crackling of the fire-bush and the lush, tropical greenery around them – not to mention Harry’s sudden, unexpected proximity – Draco pressed on, ignoring the warning signs. “No, listen, I don’t understand why you can’t stop by the shop once in a while. I know Lee would love to see you, and I―”
“Ta very much for that little show, Potter. Honestly, for a man who says he hates publicity, you don’t do yourself many favours. Now get in here, would you?”
at that handwriting. How can you still find someone attractive when they write like a drunk toddler?” She held the parchment right up to her nose, squinting at the words. “
“Anyway,” Potter continued, “are you going to get on with it, or did you just bring me back here to strip me off and insult me?”
Draco hums. “I never told anyone. It just didn’t seem –” He falters, searching for words. Harry stays silent, focusing on the weight of Draco’s hand, the way his fingers have curled, just slightly, around Harry’s own. “Well. I’m – I’m sorry about the divorce.”
Just when did he get so close? Draco wasn’t sure. The crowd noise faded to silence as they regarded each other – Harry’s cheeks flushed from the whiskey and the artificial warmth, his emerald eyes shining, his chin still hidden underneath that scratchy-looking scarf. Draco’s breath was coming fast now, and he willed himself still, desperate to avoid even disturbing the air around them.
Eventually he emerged, blinking as his eyes adjusted to the harsh winter sunlight, before looking around in surprise. These were the cheap seats – the cheap
“Your room’s exactly the same, Draco. It’s hard for me to relax here when – well―” He looked over towards the bed, gesturing – whether intentionally or not, Draco couldn’t tell – at the exact spot where Draco had stood, shivering, that fateful night, a year ago. “I know you don’t feel comfortable at mine right now, and I understand that too. I want to keep doing this – I want to keep seeing you, Draco. I’m just not – I’m not certain exactly where we go from here.”
Hermione couldn’t help but shiver at the sight, the cold seeming to seep through the thick stone walls straight into her bones, and she chastised herself for being deceived by an illusion. Three large windows were set into the far wall, the murky depths of the lake visible beyond. Two of them were empty, excepting the occasional fish, but the left-hand one… there was something…
Potter cut in quickly. “Oh, please, I don’t need to hear all that rubbish again. I mean, not that your letter was rubbish, I just―” he broke off with a sigh. “Just don’t, all right.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco caught a flash of movement. And then another. And then, to his utter horror, the tall shadow which he’d assumed to be his standing lamp started… undulating. The heavy bronze stem was warping, fattening out,
“Well, I’m glad I got to speak with you, Mr Malfoy. It was far more… agreeable than I expected.” Draco raised his eyebrows, unsure whether he’d been complimented or insulted.
“Fuck, I’m going to kill Robards,” continued Ron. “All these harebrained schemes. When I’m Head Auror, that’s all going to change, let me―”
“No, I know what you said before, but―” Harry shrugged, attempting to hide his horror as even more words spilled forth unbidden from his treacherous mouth, “―look, it just seemed like there was something you weren’t saying, is all.”
“God, Draco, anyone would think you were the one giving the speech! You look worse than I feel. What’s going on?”
are both depressants, so it’s been trial and error really, working out what we should give you, seeing how you react…”
When he thought about it, the first thing he realised was that it would have to be a Muggle. Strangely, the idea intrigued him. He had almost no experience of interacting with Muggles. As a teenager who’d been subjected to many years of pureblood dogma, the idea of half-bloods had revolted and fascinated him in equal measure. Muggleborns were one thing, but just
Do you see what I’m saying now? Look at him, thrashing about, trying to jump off the bed. He’s almost pulled out his bloody
A tense silence fell over the group as he finished. The Aurors looked at one another. Malfoy slid to the floor, and the Unspeakables’ Keeper lowered their tiny trophy, lips pressed together tightly. Ron bit back a squeak of outrage as angry mutterings erupted from all the players, while Hermione beamed proudly, pretending not to notice. Kingsley, however, looked around nervously, bowed deeply and took his leave.
. He’d sit for ages, these days, telling Draco about problems he was having at work, or about his friends, or asking Lee silly questions about Muggles. Although he made occasional flirty comments to Draco, he never went so far as to ask him out again outright, but now that Draco knew Potter wanted him too, the constant pull of desire was impossible to ignore. It was magnified a hundred-fold by
Draco heard Harry’s sharp inhale then, felt his body tremble for a second against Draco’s chest, and he wrapped his arms back around Harry, holding him close. Harry trailed his hand in the water, mumbling a warming charm under his breath.
It sounded like a foreign language to Draco. He considered the girl’s Muggle appearance and apparent lack of wand (where would you even
Draco laughed. “Thank you, although I should probably tell you that I was planning on growing it out again.”
ball of light within? He looked again. No, he must have been mistaken. There were definitely two. Two lights, next to each other.
“I’ll suck you,” Draco mumbled against Harry’s lips, already reaching between them. He was eager, so very eager, not only to feel the weight of Harry on his tongue once more, but also to prove himself, that Harry might forget Draco’s earlier embarrassing confession. But before he had the chance, Harry’s hand flew down to meet his, encircling Draco’s wrist.
“I mean,” he said to Neville and Potter the next day, as they watched her adding salamander blood to the Wiggenweld Potion she was stirring, “I did get Vince and Greg through their Potions O.W.L.s, and Greg thought an Adder’s Fork was something you’d use for eating steak. Who says I can’t have a Squib assistant?”
It was sitting on the counter when Harry padded downstairs, still wiping sleep from his eyes. Beside a steaming cup of Earl Grey, the accompanying note read:
The Ministry witch on reception raised an eyebrow at Leonie’s attire, ushering them haughtily through the golden gates and into one of the lifts. Fortunately for her, Lee’s mind was clearly occupied; she spent so long peering at two loudly-arguing goblins that Draco had to pull her back quickly to avoid decapitation as the doors snapped shut. The Ministry witch sniffed and picked at her nails. A heavy, ominous sort of fog drifted past the false windows on either side as the lift rushed downwards – a shame, thought Draco, for Lee’s breathing was shallow and nervy, and she was in desperate need of a distraction.
Draco was unconvinced. He let Neville drag him over to the book, only half-listening to his rapid-fire questions about the Manor’s aquatic plants. He was completely unable to banish thoughts of Potter – or that searching expression on his face – from his mind.
Harry rolled his eyes fondly as he weighed the little green disc in his hand. He pressed the centre of it, laughing incredulously as the words shimmered into focus:
His robes were a royal blue, different shades woven through to produce a slight iridescence, the effect heightened with a clever charm. They were traditional robes with no fastenings, but cut tight to his chest in a modern style. The high collar featured a delicate gold design, with two thin lines of gold trim running downward to Draco’s waist, where the blue fabric opened up into a split, revealing golden silk underneath. More golden embroidery shimmered from his wrists, snakelike patterns winding their way around his arms up to the back of his shoulder blades. Although the original fabric was heavy and crisp, the robes had been imbued with a lightening charm, and moved smoothly with Draco’s body, emitting barely a rustle. Over the last couple of weeks – always finding himself too busy to eat – Draco had lost some weight, and he’d briefly wondered if he might look awkward, or scrawny, underneath the expensive fabric. But no – he moved gracefully, tall and slender, filling out the flattering cut nicely. The whole effect was dazzling, and Draco couldn’t even pretend to regret the many Galleons he’d spent.
Draco didn’t know. He frowned. “I don’t mean to be insensitive, Neville, but it doesn’t sound like you should beat yourself up about it. As annoying as it presumably is, Potter must be used to the press by now. It seems like practically any time he blows his nose, the
, as he watched Vince fall into the inferno, eyes wide and mouth open in one final, agonising scream.
“And thank fuck for that,” Harry says with a grimace. “Dingy old pile. Christ, I don’t think I saw the sun for the six weeks I was stuck sorting that place.” He wasn’t exaggerating; the longer Harry had spent uncovering mouldy furniture and throwing out rotten food, the darker and lonelier the house had become. It had all been most unpleasant, with ceilings lowering day by day and corridors stretching out before his very eyes. He’d woken frequently at night to the sound of disembodied footsteps, or the stench of burning meat that he couldn’t source and that Kreacher – sour-faced and obstructive as always – denied being able to smell.
They were almost at the living room door when the enormous crash came from within. It was quickly followed by a dreadful high-pitched whine – an animal in pain, Hermione thought wildly. Instinct forced her to stop in her tracks, and she stumbled as Pansy pushed past her, forcing her way into the room.
ran an ‘expose’ on Draco’s friendships, accusing him of using potions to dupe Neville, Ron and company into associating with him. Of course, that hit very close to home, and Draco wallowed in misery for days before Neville himself told Draco that if he didn’t pull his head out of his arse, the
rather strange just how often Potter mumbled. But it was rude to point things like that out, wasn’t it? No, thought Draco, smiling indulgently at Potter, he would just have to find out Potter’s favourites some other way – maybe Weasley would tell him, or Granger?
After a few seconds, Neville and Hannah’s now-familiar living room swam into focus. Glasses and plates littered every surface, a sparkling golden
“Well, it’s a damn sight better than that fishing hut in Greenland, anyway.” He turns back, traces the curve of Harry’s smile with a gentle finger.
Draco smirked. “So you like what you see, then?” Potter’s mouth twitched, the beginnings of a smile playing about his lips, even as he rolled his eyes to the heavens. Draco inched closer, his hand moving up to lightly finger the sleeve of Potter’s robes.
“I’ll what?” Hearing his name, Neville looked up from Draco’s book. He’d been so engrossed in his reading, it seemed he’d missed their entire conversation.
But Neville wasn’t finished. “I’m not sure you do, though. If you did, you wouldn’t have said what you did last night. Honestly―”
Dean Thomas came to the shop to see Draco several times in the weeks following the Quidditch incident. He was terribly apologetic, bringing genuine-sounding messages of sympathy from most of their teammates. London was just on the cusp of summer, and with Draco’s arm and ribs fully healed, he found himself all the more desperate to get out on the broom. So when, inevitably, Thomas begged him to come back and play – even bringing Draco a list of the Magical Transportation team-members to reassure him that none of them were waiting to hex him in the back – Draco quickly agreed to return as their Seeker. After all, what was the point in living at all if he was forced to forgo everything that he wanted? Why should he stop doing something that gave him so much joy?
He’s so slight – almost fragile – like this, hunched over before Harry, swamped by lime-green scrubs. “You know what’s going on, Harry.” His words come out small and flat.
little revelation. “Darling,” he could hear her saying, “I don’t care if the Chosen One sucks cock now. The fact of the matter is that he’s no more likely to be sucking yours today than he was yesterday, when you thought he was straight. You’ve got far more important things to worry about right now than inventing romantic fantasies about Potter.”
“What?” Draco almost shouts, brow wrinkled in concentration as he twists around from his spot at the base of the armchair. Harry gestures to him to end the silencing charm, which he does with a frown. “Sorry, what were you saying?”
Draco’s shove is light but firm against Harry’s own chest. “Seriously, Harry, I’ve got my anatomy viva in –” he checks the clock, “– ugh, five hours. I need to sleep, now.”
,” she hissed at him, eyebrows raised. Draco suspected her words weren’t intended for his ears. He didn’t quite understand – sure, there were bits and pieces he still couldn’t recall, but how important could those be?
Draco began to feel a little overwhelmed again, his legs trembling, and he sank down onto a nearby stool. Harry wandered over, then, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. “Can we go back upstairs?” he asked, innocuously. “It’s just that I
give him nervous smiles of recognition, and either don’t notice or are too polite to ask why one of his hands has disappeared.
Draco slowly pulled himself up on the sink, turning his head so he wouldn’t have to see himself in the mirror. He groped along the edge of the cabinet, ignoring the steady pounding in his chest, until finally he reached the handle.
“So…?” Draco prompted. At Potter’s blank look, he sighed. “What is it? What was so important that you had to drag me down here, piss off my neighbours and drip rainwater all over my shop floor like some bloody Crup?”
The wireless crackles as the announcer begins calling the teams for the Kestrals vs Harpies match, and Harry’s attention is immediately diverted. When Ginny’s name is called – she’s on the bench – he sighs, jealousy rearing its ugly head as he pictures her looping high above the stands, cheers and whoops ringing in her ears. But why did he even care? He didn’t
The food is terrible. He pokes miserably at his beetroot burger, charred pink on a bed of green stalks. “Not one word,” mutters Harry. Draco huffs past the reluctant forkful of kale hovering before his lips.
Everyone loved Lee, but Potter, in particular, rapidly developed a fondness for her – both war orphans, abandoned to the care of distant relatives, Draco supposed – and consequently his visits increased until he was stopping by two or three times a week. Of course, watching Potter with Lee – whether he was transfiguring Draco’s quills into beautiful golden hummingbirds for her amusement, or laughing as he helped her recapture an escaped family of bouncing spiders, or bent over with her in the lab, having a hushed, serious discussion – only served to magnify Draco’s burgeoning crush on the man, which he feared was becoming laughably obvious.
happening – almost every day, in fact. As soon as Lofts popped out of their shared office for any reason, Malfoy would appear. He spoke a little too loudly, and smiled a lot, and skilfully managed to maintain a stream of inane chatter without pause whilst hunting high and low through the office for any goodies on offer. But the strangest thing of all – the thing that Harry could never in a million years have anticipated – was just how
“…my apologies, Mr Black, I didn’t ask whether you were planning on living here yourself, or whether you’d be renting the place out…?”
Draco took a sharp breath in at the mention of Potter’s name. Did she know, somehow, how much he’d been in Draco’s thoughts lately? “Potter’s – what do you mean?”
Efficient as ever, Pansy wasted no time putting her plan into action, and within a week, Draco found himself following a handful of stragglers through the Cannons' tired old stadium. A woolly hat covered his too-distinctive hair, and he ducked his head as he passed the stands full of orange merchandise, ticket clutched in his clammy palm. Chasing the roar of the crowd, he climbed up the rickety steps, winding higher and higher and higher still, until the air began to feel thin. Draco was already shaky with nerves, and he had to stop – back pressed against the canvas wall – and take great gulping breaths before he could continue.
Harry folded his arms, still avoiding Draco’s gaze. “I’m afraid I was. Kingsley signed the three of us – me, Ron and Hermione – off for total access to any of the war trials. The other two weren’t bothered, but I – well. At first, it was just curiosity, really. I wanted to see real Aurors in action, and I also had this vague idea that it might help me to move on, put the war behind me, you know. I used a Glamour – a good one, Kingsley helped me, no one knew who I was – and I went to Dolohov’s trial. He killed Remus, Professor Lupin, you know,” Harry added, as though Draco didn’t know. “And it
Although Draco’s fears stalled him for a minute, he knew he was going to enter regardless. Potter aside – and let’s face it, Potter had always been the exception to every rule – he hardly ever disobeyed
“Oh, it’s Draco again now, is it?” he muttered, perching gingerly on the edge of his armchair, his whole body feeling prickly, irritated. “Tell me,
He disappeared in a roar of green. Draco waited, impatiently, for the flames to die down, before, not thirty seconds later, he followed.
But Draco wasn’t worried. He had a good feeling about things. He didn’t need to dwell on it, and so he handed the letter to Itti and put it out of his mind, as easy as that. He got to his feet. That was enough writing for one day. It was a beautiful spring afternoon, and the Manor gardens were always beautiful at this time of year – why was he wasting time indoors?
Draco could only stare, shellshocked, as the Deputy Head Auror – his erstwhile lover – stood at the entrance of his bathroom, tiny Quidditch players still zooming irreverently around his crotch, clearly weighing up the merits of arresting Draco on the spot. Distantly, Draco realised, he should probably
“No, I mean it! Neville’s right, Hannah. This isn’t fair on you, risking your Healer’s licence. If anything happens, I can’t have people knowing you were involved. You’re both right. It’s my decision, I’ll deal with the consequences.”
Charmed by the way his given name sounded coming from Potter’s mouth, Draco hastened to reassure him. “It’s not.” He deftly caught Potter’s sleeve before it could slip out of his grasp. “But I need to know, what about you, Potter – Harry? Did you come here alone? What about what’s-his-face, that American guy?”
Draco said nothing, but raised his right hand, the shiny globule of ointment still sitting in the middle of his palm. He shifted a little closer to Potter, which brought his left arm to rest against Potter’s clothed lower leg. Potter inhaled, sharply. Compelled by
“What?” asked Potter, who, from the sounds of it, had himself stood up. Draco turned back to see, and yes – Potter was facing the opposite wall, pulling his jeans up.
The night was eerily quiet by the time they landed for the next comfort break, with no spectators left and only the grunts and groans of the players – mostly sprawled out face down on the grass – and the rustling of foliage, to be heard. The creaky old Ministry receptionist had transfigured his stool into a deckchair and his hat into a nightcap, and was ignoring everyone else completely, taking small sips of what appeared to be a tiny snifter of sherry.
Draco stretches, tipping his head back into Harry’s lap, groaning when Harry tugs at his hair. “It’s – it’s just a lot of effort, Harry. But if it means that much to you, I’ll come.”
The Chief Warlock rose from his seat, adjusting his papers on the lectern, and the steady murmur of the crowd increased in volume. All the remaining onlookers hastened to find their places, and the young girl’s mother finally managed to pull her away from the railing and down onto a bench.
“Thank you,” he got out, winded, pulling back slightly and turning his head to watch the Bludger whirl off into the trees.
“Sure. I’ve got the dry ingredients on the shelves to the left, wet ones, as you can see, are in the different containers to the right. Volatile stuff is under a
The Ministry witch leant forward imperiously as they got out. “Level 2. Three rights, then a left, straight on past the Improper Use of Magic Office, another right through the archway, two more lefts, and the courtroom should be in front of you. Got it?” Without waiting for a reply, she stepped backwards and was gone, a waft of air and the screech of brakes the only indication she’d ever been there.
It was Hermione who finally came to their rescue, throwing Draco a wink as she interrupted Luna mid-sentence to ask whether she could borrow Draco (“
Dropping his useless wand, Draco pulled himself to the edge of his bed. With a hoarse moan, he lowered his legs and let himself fall, as gently as he could manage, onto the floor. He lay there for a few seconds, naked except for yesterday’s underwear, prickly carpet fibres pressed against his cheek, willing himself not to pass out again. Then, summoning every ounce of energy left in his body, he crawled slowly towards the en suite.
After several more long, excruciating minutes, the photographer gave them all a thumbs-up and was replaced by Kingsley, who surveyed them all sternly, bald head glistening under the hazy, buttermilk sun.
Draco withdraws his hand, flicking his wand to Summon the next pair of trousers. Frantic, Harry grabs at them as they sail past his head.
Draco tipped his head back to look at Harry, almost losing his rhythm as he found green eyes staring down at him, expression awestruck, pupils blown wide with arousal. Maintaining eye contact, Draco carefully reached around, linking his fingers with Harry’s over the back of his head, their joined hands guiding him forward. He moved his fist so that he could swallow Harry down to the root, pressing Harry’s hand down against Draco’s head in short bursts until Harry understood, letting out a laugh of disbelief which quickly became a moan as he began rutting his hips forward in earnest, his cock driving in and out of Draco’s mouth.
-induced disaster might have passed its nadir. Before he knew it, they were decorating the shop front for Halloween, the business losses were finally slowing, and he hadn’t received a Howler in weeks. He was able to breathe easier again. Harry’s words about getting
“Would you like a drink? I can – oh no, I didn’t… I mean, I’ve got tea. If you like. Or… or we could talk some more, or―”
“How could I forget?” She laughed, lightly. “I remember asking you whether you thought the war had sent him a bit – you know…” She twirled her finger next to her head, crossing her eyes with a grin. Draco tried not to feel offended.
was keeping him level-headed, Draco thought distantly, because his sober self might have slipped and poked Potter right in his healing wound.
he did indeed feel reasonably well, with only a mild headache and a vague, unsettled feeling in the pit of his stomach. He couldn’t put a finger on the cause of his unease – after all, it was only
He’d enjoy Owling Neville about that one. Draco scanned it over breakfast and was delighted to note several mentions of his apothecary, with only a single reference to ‘ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy’.
“Fortunate co―?!” Potter spat incredulously, leaning forward. “Explain that, would you, Malfoy? And quickly, before someone else sustains a life-threatening injury.”
’s reassuring touch. This was the biggest crowd he’d seen for a very long time, and he’d certainly never walked amongst so many Muggles. His family’s loudly professed prejudice, he knew, sprang mostly from a deeply rooted fear of the unknown. What if these Muggles saw straight through his disguise, knew him instantly to be an imposter? What would they do to him then?
he makes when his back hits the floor, straddling him and interlacing their fingers. It still feels a little bit forbidden, and Harry can’t help the wicked grin which spreads across his face as he leans in to fit their lips together. The kiss is open-mouthed and hungry, sweet from the Frappuccino they shared on the way over, and he lets his hips roll lazily against Draco’s as static crackles in the carpet below. Draco allows it for a moment, sucking eagerly at his lower lip, moaning softly when Harry moves to bite down the side of his jaw. But when Harry snakes a hand down between them, fingers toying with the button on his trousers, Draco makes a soft noise of protest and pushes him away.
He moved to deepen the kiss, tongue slipping inside to claim Harry’s mouth, breath hitching as Harry’s hand came to rest just below the small of his back. Harry’s little finger dipped down further, hesitantly, making Draco growl and press forward, until his whole weight was pinning Harry to the pillar. He thrilled at Harry’s sharp intake of breath as their bodies slid together, Harry’s hard length insistent against his hip. Draco ignored it, slanting his head and continuing his assault on Harry’s mouth.
just watching you. We’ve been going for―” his eyes flicked downwards “―five hours now. D’you reckon you can keep this up for another nineteen?”
“He is!” Ginny slides the paper across. “Shagging Theodore Nott, apparently.” Her pretty nose wrinkles. “Why, did you know?”
When Draco finally emerged – now washed, dressed and smelling a lot less like a brewery – they sat down for dinner at the small table in his kitchen. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. Harry’s pasta was some carbonara-type affair, and its rich, creamy smell had wafted throughout the entire flat, invading Draco’s nostrils as soon as he had opened the bathroom door, leaving him pressing a hand to his mouth in an attempt not to gag. The sight of it, thick heavy white sauce slopped out onto his plate, was almost too much to bear, but he’d been raised to be polite, and so he said nothing, poking it around ineffectually with his fork, trying to calm his stomach by taking deep breaths through pursed lips. He tried not to watch Harry, apparently oblivious to his distress, cramming forkfuls of pasta into his own mouth as though he was a man starved.
He was going to die, here, alone in his bed, and be consumed by this awful, disgusting monster. He was getting dizzy, the lack of oxygen to his brain making his thoughts fuzzy. At least it would be over soon. Would his mother know what had happened? Would she miss him? Would Harry?
Hardly anything phased Hermione, these days: pragmatism came with the territory. Last week, a man had been brought into her department, splinched from left nipple to navel. Her clever hands had slipped through the blood pouring from his ruptured spleen as she tried desperately to stem the flow; small bowel forcing its way out of the gaping wound as he retched and moaned. She’d watched his knackered heart beat its last then, and felt next to nothing – but this? Bile rose, unbidden, in her throat at the image of her former schoolmate looking up, teeth black with mud, that absurd, vacant smile still plastered across his face.
Draco knew he was being a brat, but it had been a shitty day, and he had drunk far too much Firewhisky to care. It was liberating, in a way, being off the
Neville chuckled, looking a little brighter for the first time that day. “Nope. Sorry to disappoint.”
what he actually saw: a pair of grey eyes staring straight up at him, the pupils shot through with – Harry thought, he
“Uh, thank you?” said Harry, instinctively tugging at the hem of his jersey, hoping to hide the ink below. He could feel himself blushing and hoped against hope that the light was dim enough to hide it. “But, uh, how is it that you’re so… intimately… familiar with my tattoo?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Hermione,” Harry said, sharply. “Let me do my job, alright?” He pulled the door open, striding into the room. Nervously, Hermione followed in his wake.
. My dad was killed too – our bloody neighbour shopped him to the Death Eaters while I was at school – and I got sent to live with my uncle and aunt down here in London.”
at all in the week that followed, which Draco found completely maddening and a welcome relief in roughly equal measure. His encounter at the club, although unsettling when he’d thought about it afterwards, had helped reduce the frequency – if not the intensity – of his fantasies about Potter. It was enough that by the time that Potter sauntered in the following week, Draco (with a little help from
“I’m glad someone’s laughing.” Potter smiled grimly as the knife finally embedded itself in the centre of the board.
There was no anger behind it – in fact, Harry seemed almost reluctantly amused. Draco turned, impatient to get a proper look at him. Greedy, he let his gaze wander over the face he’d seen only in the paper and in his dreams for half a year now – those familiar eyes squinting into the wind, stubble catching on the fibres of his scarf, jet-black hair curling gently out from under the garish cap.
“All right, of course. I’ll go,” said Draco, wounded. He got to his feet and started shuffling down the row when a strong hand wound around his bicep, holding him back.
not here to hex you, right?” Potter asked from the corner, where he was digging his finger into a dish of crushed dung beetles.
, Draco lent closer, on the pretext of inspecting the wound. Potter would have to be blind not to notice the tableau they made – Draco kneeling before him, his every breath disturbing the fine hairs on Potter’s thigh.
Hermione automatically began sifting through the first few memories to drift her way. They were all war-related, unsurprisingly: unprocessed trauma always lingered at the surface. She was good at Legilimency – great, even – in that practiced, determined way she excelled at anything she set her mind to. But after merely a few seconds of predictable scenes – Voldemort’s hollow eyes, Bellatrix’s cackles, a bathroom full of blood – Pansy’s snooty voice sing-songed through her mind.

“Her story is compelling. I think the Wizengamot will listen to it. It’s a good thing you’re doing, taking her on.”
You slide your hand over that last inch then, let your finger press casually against his. He glances down for a long moment, pinches his lips together tightly, then turns to face the storm once more.
“Anyway, I’d best be off. Got to get to Gringotts, then back to work by three. You coming or staying Neville?”
A bolt of orange light emerges violently from his wand with a cracking noise loud enough to wake the entire street; the wand clatters to the floor. Driven by hunger and frustration, he realises – satisfied smile faltering – that he’s probably cast just a
“Ow!” He raised a hand in apology to the reporter, but his expression was amused as he turned back to Harry. “Potter, what d’you
“Duh! Well, to be honest, Pansy did. Got it shipped over to New York the Muggle way and everything. I thought it’d be a bit unfair, making some poor owl haul your naked arse across the entire Atlantic.”
Harry shrugged as best he could while his organs were slowly being crushed against a wooden armrest. “Just something I’ve been wanting to do for a while.” He tried to look casual, nodding over at the Muggles who were still necking frantically, trying to ignore the unpleasant squelching sounds and heavy breathing. “Or, you know, when in Rome…”
Potter let go of his wrist but didn’t step away. His eyes seemed to bore into Draco, and it made him nervous.
this, Harry wonders. Always pushing him away, always nagging him about this or that, when all Harry wants is to be close to him! “This time?” he pouts. “What’s that supposed to mean? And who are you – McGonagall, come to check up on me after curfew? I just had a couple, Draco, for God’s sake. Just a few shots with Seamus and the boys. Lighten
A gentle evening breeze was blowing; it ruffled Malfoy’s floppy hair and, backlit by one of the strange floating
Draco wasn’t a fan of her delivery, but he could hardly argue with the accuracy. “Well – that’s about the measure of it, yes.”
As Draco cupped the bulge of Harry’s cock through the cotton of his pants, Harry made a guttural sound and threw his head backwards, exposing the tantalising curve of his throat. Drawn to it, Draco let his tongue dip into the hollow between Harry’s collarbones, trailed it up over his Adam’s apple and all the way to his jaw, the rasp of Harry’s stubble under his lips.
They both froze, their breathing fast and loud in the silence as, slowly, Harry lifted his head. Malfoy was staring at him, completely alert, eyes bright like an animal caught in the headlights. The corner of his lip curled into a sly smile, and it was decided. They moved at the exact same second, hands darting down towards the little golden ball, which was trapped and struggling between their legs. Harry got there first, batting Malfoy’s hand away, his fingers grazing the fluttering wings, preparing to claim their prize. Malfoy huffed in frustration, but when Harry looked up his eyes were soft, crinkling at the edges, and he gave a small shrug. Suddenly, Harry’s decision was made.
To Draco’s dismay, Leonie hadn’t been exaggerating about the state of affairs in the shop. Somehow, over a few weeks, Draco’s thriving business had suffered a decline in fortune so dramatic that it was hard to even imagine a recovery.
, Uncle Vernon had said proudly), and Harry rolled his eyes, standing up and dusting himself off as it raced past. It revved loudly, skidding to a stop just around the corner.
Draco sighed and rubbed his eyes. His head was spinning. He was no fool; he was well aware that long-term
above filtered around Harry as he moved, gilding his skin, Draco’s world condensing into wonderful glittering fragments of pleasure, beauty, and warmth. Overcome with the bliss of long-held desire finally realised, Draco shivered, his eyes rolling back in his head, unable to stop himself from thrusting up with each slow roll of Harry’s body.
He thought of Harry. Harry: always his weakness, now his total undoing. He tried to remember Harry’s face at the end of the night, but it remained a blur. He could well imagine it though: disappointed. Disgusted. Once again, he heard those parting words echo through his brain:
