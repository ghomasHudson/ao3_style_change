They were partners for this potion they were making, draught of dying pigs? Living pigs? Who knows, I dont care.
It all started when Harry overheard his best friends arguing. Normally he would have ignored it had he not heard his name thrown around. They were arguing on how to spend some money so Harry was confused as to what he had to do with it. All was revealed when Ron said, "Mione, we're getting ahead of ourselves for a second. We need to kill him first before we can use his money." Harry gasped; they were planning to kill him? How dare they?! He trusted them! Well, not anymore.
He was under the tree for hours before a wet nose prodded his face, breaking him out of his trance. He turned to the dog and gave it a small smile before turning back to the lake. He had only just realised he was shaking, freezing cold when a warm body engulfed his. It was like a furnace and obviously human.
Anyways, I hope you like this chapter. Tell me your thoughts!! I look forward to reading your feedback and your comments. I love reading peoples comments. Makes me feel accomplished and proud.
Chapter 4
Draco had never felt so safe. Who would've thought that warmth, hot chocolate, blankets and another person would bring him that sense of safety? He loved it. When he finished his drink, he placed the empty mug on a nearby table before settling back into the hot body engulfing him and snuggling deep into it before drifting off to sleep with a small smile on his face.
"HARRY POTTER!!!"
My dearest Harry,
I glance at Ginny from the corner of my eye. She is soaking this BS up like a dry sponge.
It was dinnertime in the Great Hall, my 5th year and I was sitting at Gryffindor table with Hermione, Ron, Neville and Ginny. I had literally just came into my “second puberty” – where I find out my other “gender”. There are three types – Alpha, Beta and Omega. Most people are Betas but there are quite a few Alphas too. No one, absolutely no one, becomes an Omega. They are extinct. Also, very, very, very powerful. You can get some very powerful Alphas, but they cannot match an Omega’s power. These types of Alpha are incredibly rare and it is thought that they were meant to be potential mates to the now non – existent Omegas.
Seeing Draco it bounced up and started to bark and jump in circles around Draco, wagging its tail enthusiastically. Draco chuckled a little making the dog get louder. "Stop! Sh!!! Someone will hear!!!"
Ron stepped back from the two boys and watched as Draco gently picked Harry up bridal style. “Or maybe, it is personal?” he smirks before continuing. “Do you want his body then? A little fuck toy perhaps? But then why would you care about him? Aren’t Slytherins not supposed to show weakness?”
I smiled at her and she grinned. "Thank god!"
“You then need to do something to get his attention, something you usually wouldn’t do – for example… hmm, let me think… like… go and try tame an vicious chicken or even jump off a tree. “
I counted to five before Harry seized up and stopped speaking. "Shit." He whispered. "Shit indeed Potter." Malfoy snarled.
Just.
He noticed Draco was still shivering so he made himself comfy before pulling Draco onto his lap again, trying to get the Slytherin to warm up. He pointedly ignored everyone gaping behind him, smirking into Draco's hair and waited for the house elf to reappear. When it did, he covered them in blankets and dished out their hot chocolates.
Maybe this courtier of mine is going to be good for me. Maybe they will help me get over Draco?
Draco bit his lip thoughtfully. "I said, why is Potter writing to you?" He let Potters owl in, taking the letter and feeding her a treat.
Harry thought it over playfully. “Alright then!” He said whilst giggling.
Harry just smiled sheepishly at him and the weirdest thing happened. Malfoy shook his head fondly and
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Oh merlin. Please don't tell me you're engaged to Malfoy!" Ron complained.
As one hand was gripping my arse the other came to the base of my neck; as if to hold me in place as he ravished my lips. I moaned as his tongue swept through my lips into my hot, wet mouth. His nose was squished on my cheek and his glasses were poking me in the face but I didn't care. As our tongues danced, I kept imagining scenes where we were snogging and more and the thought made me excited. I wanted more. More of him. More of this. More of
"Oh my god you're my new best friend!!" Harry literally screamed at Draco.
She blushed and I noticed the tip of her nose was rosy. Gosh, she is adorable.
A beautiful hair accessory sat inside, glinting in the morning sunlight. "Oh Harry." Hermione breathed. "Its beautiful." I nodded mutely. I couldn't say anything I was too shocked.
It was November when someone else joined him on his walk. It was a black dog, one that resembled Sirius Black. He didn't know who it was, it was obviously an animagus though.

"I read Terry Pratchett's Discworld series – the WHOLE lot!" Harry reasoned.
"I remember, very specifically, saying that you were to leave Harry Potter alone. Even if he comes to you for help. Which was unlikely." Tom's voice was as cold as his glare. "Explain yourself."
"We can go there after you have peed. I need to change my clothes and as you don't have any, you can borrow some of mine." He smiled at Harry before returning to his instructions of how to get to the bathroom. "Anyways, before you interrupted me," a weak glare was thrown Harry's way and Harry smiled sheepishly. "You turn left, go down the hall and it is the first door on the right. My bedroom is right opposite it so if you need me, I'm there." He smiled at Harry again as they reached the bathroom. "Here you go, I'll be in my room just there alright?"
"Hermione look at her hair. Is it soft? I bet its soft."
Ron lets go of Harry to attack Draco and watched as Harry slid to the floor. He swung his arm around to punch Draco but Draco dodged and so he missed and the momentum pulled him forward almost falling over. He growled and fixed Draco with a death glare. “What does a Malfoy want with a Potter, hm? Can’t be money. You have enough of that already, so what could it be? The connections? The fame?”
Hello Harry,
"Draco! You're freezing! Get off!!"
Harry had a guest? And didn't clean up? Did him and this girl fuck...?
I can't look at him.
"Well..." Oh look, she is fingering the necklace. Nervous. "Before this whole courting thing, I had a crush on you. Like, so much I thought I was in love with you. And then I started to get these gifts and small notes and I slowly started to fall for the person behind them - even though I didn't know who it was. It scared me. You were my first crush and then someone else comes and sends me beautiful gifts that mean so much to me and I didn't know what to do. It was Thursday when I decided I should try get over you. I was hoping that whoever this person was may help me get over you. But I don't need to anymore!! Cos it's you!" she finished with wide eyes, sparkling from the reflections off the snow.
"What do you want?"
Harry whispered to Draco in awe but everyone still heard. "Your mum is badass." Draco whispered back, "I know."
"MUM!!!!"
Another package was by my bed. This time, it was a lighter red than yesterdays but was still a beautiful colour. After I had smashed my glasses onto my face, I picked up the box and unwrapped it. The note was lying on top of the tissue paper.
Harry never felt like he was loved.
"Was it you?" Always straight to business Harry is.
"No." Draco's face fell at the tone of finality.
Harry was having a bad morning. It all started when he had to get out of his lovers embrace to go to school. It got worse from then on. When he went to the owlery to send a letter off to Padfoot and Moony, the owl he tried to use bit him and another used him as a toilet. With Ron being an arse, he wasn’t going to deal with his shit. “I didn’t ask you to wait up for me, did I?” Harry responds sassily.
As you would expect, Harry was quite upset with this news and he didnt know what to do. He hasn't asked anyone for help, determined to sort this out himself. He didnt want the press involved - they would blow it all out of proportion. Harry was stuck on how to deal with the situation he was in. Break up? Confront her and then break up? Sleep around himself? He didnt like the last idea. There were many songs about the last one showing you what could go wrong.
Maybe, maybe this love was returned and Harry's chest filled with hope at the possibility of finally, being loved.
"What?" Shit shit shit.
“Potter…” He growls.
Harry nodded and strode off towards him before stopping and grabbing a dozen flowers of 2 different plants. "Do you want them to live a little longer? Look fresher for longer too?" Harry asked conversationally as Draco dried himself off with a charm. "Yes to both please." Draco replied, looking drier than he came in but more fuzzled than usual.
Oh look! My Love is sitting and eating their dinner. I wonder if I can sneak up on them...
“Ginny I think he needs to breathe…” I say as I see her drape herself across him. Bleugh, what a slut.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Huh. Good point." Draco said, voice cracking.
I hope you enjoy this week. I love your laugh, I could listen to it forever.
Harry woke up disoriented. Where was he? Why wasn't in pain? It took him a minute to remember what happened. He gasped when he did. He killed Vernon. The Malfoy's and Snape rescued him and Tom too! And, what was that bright golden light around him and Draco? It was pretty but very painful at the same time.

"You git! Why did you slap me on the arse?? Was that really necessary??" Draco demanded.
“I don’t like it Dray. He just flings my name around like a boomerang; it cuts anyone down who doesn’t listen to him. I hate it.” One voice complained.
This is my last week at online school and I spend my sports lessons writing this story as they are free periods. I write this on my laptop, and my laptop is strictly school only so I am doing this under my parents noses... This means that I will not be able to update weekly as I have attempted to. I will be writing on my phone from now on and that means I will get frustrated with my fat thumbs so updates will be much slower andddddddddddd the chapters may be shorter.... Sorry.
10:30 this morning, at the lake?
“Holy shit potter! Why didn’t you say anything!?!?! I have liked you since second year. I realised the moment I put that snake on you in the duelling club. It was also the um… first time I discovered a kink of mine… parseltongue….” He blushes furiously.
He never spoke, this was an animagus. Whoever it is could probably spill his secrets if he told so he kept his mouth tightly shut.
Pansy pouted. "Potter is a disappointment." Draco bristled. "Don't call him that!" he said hotly.
: BLIND AS A BAT, BIRDS NEST ON TOP OF HIS HEAD, BI WHO LIVED, THEIF, GRYFFINDOR SEEKER, AMAZING BUILD (don't tell him), FUNNY AND CUTE
in the mood for this. Well, life too I guess.
When I finally managed to breathe, Hermione was looking smugly at me, Ron was too busy gorging himself on food, Neville was giving me knowing looks and Draco- Draco was smirking at me! She noticed me!! Well, I was kinda staring at her arse...
"Please do." was all Harry said before walking over to the bathroom swinging his hips flirtatiously.
"So you cheat on me with a filthy Death Eater. Just because you want a shag? Dont think I didnt see its surprise when you decided you were dating." She spat venomously. In a flash Harry was out of the bed, naked, with his wand in his hand pointing at the bitches throat.
A cough pulled them from their once-sweet-but-now-makeout-to-sex-session and the boys saw a smug Sirius and an amused Remus.
I should probably start at the beginning. The very beginning.
He flung open the door...
He looked under the table and scowled at the dog sitting by his legs. It whined. "Food?" Draco whispered. It whined again.
Looking back over the years, at our animosity towards each other, I feel like it was meant to be. Just hear me out a second. Draco and I always had our attention on one another. We were always seeking each other out and we had to see for ourselves where the other was. Looks across the great hall, small taunts that could be as concerned questions and the never-ending eye contact. Oh, and do not forget, that moment in third year when he LITERALLY CHECKED ME OUT! I guess you could say the signs were all there.
“Having girl problems potty?” he asks me, amusedly. Git.
?!" Pansy stared at me incredulously. "No! You idiot! I'm not replacing you! I could never replace you. You're too clingy anyways. But no, you are both equals to me. I will favour one over the other but then I will pay the same amount of attention and time to the other one I neglected for whatever reason later. You're not being cut out of my life Dray. You're too important to me."
"Har, have you met her? She loves chocolate and snow and shopping and the colour red (even though she is in slytherin) and she loves-" "okay mione that's enough. You sound as if you have a crush on her." Hermione scoffed. "Me? I have a crush on her?? No, it's YOU! It is YOU who has a crush on her. That's why i know all this stuff about her! You wont shut up about her. Perfect Draco with her perfect skin. Perfect Draco with her perfect hair that shines so perfectly in the sunlight." She teased me making me blush.
Lucius left the room giggling whilst the two boys tackled each other and started tickling the other. He loitered around for a bit, enjoying the sound of happiness but left pretty quickly when he heard moans. Lucius loves his son and future son in law (?) but he does not want to hear that.
Narcissa blushed a little. "Oh alright, I'll let you off. My bad, I misunderstood. Now, Draco let Harry have a shower, and I want you to let Harry borrow some clothes. If you do get up to any sexual activities, make sure there is no penetration, just oral and hands okay?"
“Sh-shut up P-Potter!!” He stutters still blushing.
Pansy nodded.
Harry merely hummed in response and looked around the room again, seeing if anything caught his eye. He sighed and sat down gracefully on the chair in front of the Headmasters desk. Albus' left eye twitched as he watched Harry sit. Since when did he get so graceful? He is supposed to be clumsy. Oh well, more important matters to discuss.
Once his parents had left, Draco groaned. "I hate my parents, they're so embarrassing."
I was looking at it through the window on the Hogsmeade weekend previous. My admirer must have seen me looking at it. God, I don't know who this is but I feel like I could fall in love with them. I hope it's D-. No I can't hope. I have to get over her at some point. She is never going to notice me. Not in the way I want her to.
Just past the eighth year door, was the War memorial, and it had everyone's names on it who died. He would pick a name each day, and mourn for them on his walk. Students and children he would mourn for during the weekdays but on weekends he mourned for teachers and adults. He never mourned the same name more than once.
I will fall asleep in a second in the middle of the corridor. He had removed his hand from my neck at one point and was rubbing the small of my back comfortingly. I relaxed into him gradually and his arms shuffled me around so he was comfortably holding me.
"Right, I pulled out a black skirt, black tights, your favourite DM's - the rose ones and your favourite tshirt and jumper which are both covered on roses. What is it with you and roses? Especially red ones?" She asked.
"No." whispered Lucius shaken and angry. Draco looked between the adults. "Have I missed something?"
It is times like these when I love my job.
made and make up for your unproffessionalism
"That's so sad." Draco whispered. "Yes it is." Severus agreed. "Harry, do you feel in pain anymore?" Harry startled. "Ummm, no actually... did - did Draco heal me?" Tom nodded, "Yes, when you two bonded, the red light inside the golden sphere represented your pain Harry. The bit that came from Draco was due to his nose but the rest was from your beatings." He glowered darkly. "I can't believe those filthy muggles abused a magical child." Tom muttered quietly, but not quiet enough for Harry to not hear. Harry chuckled into Dracos chest. "They paid Tom, but if I could, I would make them scream more. Suffer more. Oh well." Everyone else nodded in agreement.
I hate my job.
"Like, just 10 seconds ago." Harry replied calmly.
"Sirius! Remus! I missed you so much!" Draco watched as Harry untangled himself from him and flung himself at the two men with a flame of jealousy flickering inside his tummy. Sirius laughed heartily at his godson and beamed brightly.
~ Harry J Potter.
I am so in love it is unreal. I wonder who she likes. Maybe it's me... I hope.
“Now love,” my heart swelled at the endearment. “You need to get your magic under control. As much as I love holding you and I’m glad you’re here, we must talk to adults about this.” “But won’t someone try taking advantage of me?” I asked timidly. Draco huffed a laugh.
I slump into my arms, once again reminiscing how much I missed him. How much I missed his strong arms, firm chest, warmth, smell, his laugh. Merlin, I even missed his atrocious hair!
Harry nodded, turning nervously back to Snape.
“Great! Well, Ron and I are of course going to go back, and I've already called some of our other friends, who also said that they were returning. I'm so excited to get back into the routine of things!”
Blaise raised an eyebrow at him. “You really don't like your fame, do you?”
Harry pressed his lips together as he thought for another moment. This man had said that he wouldn't be angry...truth it is. "My aunt and uncle burned them because I am a very bad boy and I don't deserve things like those.” He looked down at his feet as he said this, voice faint and barely audible, before looking up so he could see what the professor said next.
As if he’d heard his thoughts, he quickly composed himself and his expression took on a more mildly amused appearance, before it turned dark again. “Why would you want to be civil with a Death Eater?” he asked, self hatred evident in his voice.
Harry lifted the kitten from his arms and into Draco’s waiting ones. The look of awe and wonder on his face as he pet the little kitten made him smile. After a few moments of him petting her, to Draco's surprise she climbed up him and curled around his shoulders.
Blaise, who had been quiet up until now, laughed. "You know, if anyone else would’ve said that to him, he would have exploded. He seems to like you.” With relief, Harry noted that he could understand him perfectly, and he smiled. He looked over at Draco and saw that his cheeks had tinted slightly.
Poppy sighed, and thought for a moment. Her brows furrowed. After a few moments, she finally spoke. “Are you sure that’s a good idea? Do you know that he knows verbal words well enough from when he could hear to actually understand you and not be freaked out?”
Harry smiled a small smile, though of course there was still underlying panic. He didn't really believe Draco, but took the slight reassurance it gave him. “Thank you.” He said quietly, sheepishly.
The Weasleys sadly had to leave after lunch, but invited them to go to Diagon Alley with them the next day, which after Harry begging his uncles a lot, they agreed to.
“Malfoy, Potter, stay after class.” Snape said, giving his godson a pointed look, one that clearly told him to tell Harry what he had said because he wasn't looking.
He nodded and so she began doing intricate motions with her wand and muttering various spells.
“Are you okay Harry?” Remus asked him, placing his hand on his shoulder and crouching down so he was eye level.
Snape had creases on his face from his nose around his mouth, and his eyebrows were ever so slightly furrowed as he tried to hide his worry. He was actually sitting in his chair, the elbow that was attached to the hand that was holding up his head resting on his black cloaked knee. He was trying his best best to give Harry a kind smile.
A third time he had managed to shock Malfoy in a short amount of time, he had to have achieved some sort of record.
Harry looked at him, clearly not quite following his lips that time.
The door made a little more noise than he’d meant it too when it opened, and he cringed when Malfoy jumped. In a moment, he made the decision to, if he couldn’t be friends with him (which was probably very unlikely), he could at the very least offer him a truce.
The bell signaling the end of the class sounded, and Draco and Harry started to gather their things so they could head out of the room.
Even though Harry nodded, Madam Pomphrey and Severus Snape knew that the boy would need some prompting. So, they both tried their best to look as kind, welcoming, and as enticing as they possibly could to get Harry to speak.
Harry walked through the entrance of Platform 9 ¾, feeling slightly odd not having to push a cart through it with him. Since he could do magic outside of school now, he decided that he would just shrink his luggage this year so he wouldn't have to haul the large cart. But, he wasn't entirely empty handed.
“Right on time Hagrid, you did well.” Dumbledore praised, eyes twinkling even in the dark.
”Looks like we have all the same classes.” Draco said with a smile to his three friends.
Harry continued to grin at him, and didn’t realize he was holding onto his hand a second too long until Malfoy let go. He blushed slightly and diverted his attention to his cat. She was still curled around his shoulders and he pulled her down so he could look at her. She batted his face with her little paw and he giggled.
Draco looked surprised for a moment, before nodding.
--Wayne Dyer
It was almost impossible for Snape to fight back his anger. How
The boy with the blond hair smiled slightly in turn, and began to introduce himself. “I’m Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, and this is Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson.” Harry’s eyes watched his lips the whole time, and was happy to note that he talked slow enough that he could read his lips and understand him.
The entire class (including even most of the Gryffindors that they had the class with) were staring at him in rapt attention, sitting on the edge of their seats in anticipation for what the professor was going to do next. After a moment of silence and him just surveying the room, his eyes landed on him. “Potter! Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
“I- want- to- go!” Harry shrieked in between fits of giggles.
“Yes ma’am.” Harry agreed timidly, his voice going even softer than normal.
Harry couldn't help but frown slightly. “But don't you think that…” He trailed off for a moment, “I'm afraid that…”
He decided to ignore Malfoy’s initial sneer at his entrance into there, and offered him a small smile. “Sorry about that. Um, do you mind if I sit here? I didn’t really feel like watching Ron and Hermione go at each other and everywhere else was full.”
Sirius smiled a sad smile at the child in his arms before nodding at McGonagall and then directing his attention to Hagrid, who smiled at him. “Would you mind if I took my bike back now? It’d be better to travel with him in.”
godson?” he asked in a very eerily quiet voice.
Draco sagged into his chair slightly in relief, glad that he wasn't mad at him. He didn't know what he would have done if Harry hated him for telling Severus. He already cared so much for him so quickly and wanted to stop all bad things from happening to him or around him. “I'm so glad you're not angry with me.” He said with a relieved smile.
They made it to the carriages and sat down in one that already had Luna in it. Harry made conversation with Draco and caught up with Luna throughout the ride up to the castle, and the three of them ended up deciding to walk to the Great Hall together before going to their respective tables.
Somehow, Draco just
He laughed a little to, deciding that he definitely liked Blaise. “Seems like it, I think quite frankly that where I’m sorted is none of their business. But you know, famous and all.” Harry knew the last bit of what was supposed to have a joking tone, held a little bit of resentment, he could feel it.
Okaay, so, I am so sorry that it took me this long to update! I had a whole bunch of homework and then finals when school was in, and the summer came and I kept getting distracted by a million different things. I also suffered from writers block with this story for a bit and I'm learning how to drive and it's just been a lot. I hope you can forgive me...
Harry laughed. “No, not even them. It's kind of funny actually, she doesn't like them much. Especially Ron, it's like she can sense his dislike of cats.”
Harry honestly didn't believe what he was reading from her lips. They weren't going to throw him out immediately? He couldn't believe it. But, rare hope krept inside of him, hope that he hardly ever saw. So, he decided to throw caution to the wind and and answer the nice ladies questions unfiltered.
This is kinda just a filler chapter. I planned on having them go to their classes for the first time, but that didn't end up happening. I wanted to include where Severus stood so far and include a gesture from him to show that he's a good person.
At the sound of his voice, they both stopped what they were doing and ran towards him as well, both of them scooping him up in their arms, so that half of him was being held by each of them. “Oh my god pup we were worried sick.” Remus had relief clear in his voice.
When Harry was put down for his nap when he returned home that evening, it was with the sure thought that it had been the best birthday he had ever had.
Definitely not reassured, Harry became even more nervous, and closer to panic, but put on a mask he had learned to master to hide his emotions.
Harry’s smile grew slightly as he went to sit down across from him, and pet the small kitty that had moved down from his shoulder and to his arms when he sat down. A few silent moments passed and it wasn’t until Rena moved from his arms and back up to his shoulder again that he decided to speak. “Malfoy?” he started, trying to get his attention (he had started reading a book.)
Draco smiled a large smile back, before motioning back to the professor. “He wants to talk to you again really quick. He told me to get your attention.”
Harry frowned. If his uncle was wrong about this, then what else was he wrong about? Instead of questioning Draco further, he mentally reminded himself of the gift he received, and decided show it to him.
“That Hogwarts won't feel like home anymore. I don't think that I'd be able to cope with it if it didn't…” Harry finished, the familiar subdued expression back on his face.
Having made his decision, he slowly nodded.
They went to lunch and then transfiguration, which they all thought was going to be interesting. They were proven correct when they were given a briefing over all of the amazing things they were going to learn that year and few things they were going to learn in the next years. Things like changing a mouse into a goblet, a beetle into a button, and a lot more complicated charms. The most interesting however, was the animagus charm that they were told was very difficult. It entailed a person turning themselves into their inner animal via a very complicated process.
The castle was huge and enchanting. All the first years were enraptured by its beauty, and Harry was no exception. But while he found the castle beautiful, he also found it extremely intimidating. It was just so 'huge' and loud. Nothing like he was used too. He wondered if he would ever find his way around, or if he would be able to get to his classes on time. Harry looked over at Draco, Pansy, and Blaise when they were close to the castle, and saw they were staring at it with wide eyes. Draco looked over at him after a moment, feeling his gaze, and smiled. "Beautiful, isn't it?"
And, though Harry was having a hard time keeping up with reading all of their lips and figuring out who was speaking, thought it was one-hundred percent worth it to be able to ‘hear' what his friends were saying. “Thank you.” He told them with a million different emotions in his velvet voice that only he couldn't hear.
Hagrid began to talk to the surrounding students, but Harry couldn’t understand him from a distance, nonetheless through his beard, so he had no idea what he was saying. A few minutes into Hagrid talking to the students, Harry decided he would just ask Draco what he said later. When the crowd started moving, Harry kept close to Draco and the others and followed them hastily, determined not to be left behind them in the caos. He didn’t know what he’d do if he lost them, they were the only people in the school so far that knew he was deaf, and he was determined to make that number of people as small as possible. He could only imagine what people would do to him when they realized he was a freak, they would probably treat him like the Dursleys did and they’d be forced to kick him out of Hogwarts for his freakishness. Harry’s breath started to become slightly labored with panic and he pushed those thoughts out of his mind like he was so used to doing by now, he had other things to be worrying about right now.
They sat down in the two armchairs in front of his desk, while Snape sat in the desk, looking at him in anticipation.
They both visibly preened at the complement. “Thanks. I’m Ron and this is my twin sister, Ginny.” The boy, Ron, introduced.
and after the obvious joy she had, he had thought it was perfect.
Snape thought for a moment. “I think...it’s worth a try.”
Hagrid automatically started nodding. “Of course, ger ahead. I wouldn’ want ya ter do anything else.”
Putting that thought aside (for now at least), he wanted to anonymously give him something as an apology for judging him too soon, even though he didn't know he had. Severus had had a particular item for a while, and thought that the boy would have a good use for it.
He wrapped it up, deciding to include a small anonymous note. He then gave it to a house elf, telling it to set it at the foot of the young Potter’s bed.
Draco pressed his lips into a thin line, but nodded. He looked over at Harry as they followed Snape and wished he could touch him to comfort him, but from the few times he'd tried he learned that it would have to opposite effect.
Harry now stood just outside Platform 9 ¾ after having hid behind a post and watched a large, red haired family pass through one brick post in particular. He had none of the items that he had bought with Hagrid with him, other than his wand. The Dursleys had burned the rest as soon as he had brought it back with him to stick out the rest of the summer. Even Hedwig. He had silently cried in his cupboard for hours when it had happened, hating the Dursleys more than he'd ever hated them before.
Draco gave a tight smile, and had a certain worry beneath his eyes that Harry could only recognize because he had seen it directed at other people, but never at him. “I want too, you’re my friend.”
Hermione was more subdued now, frowning at him in worry. “What Harry?” She asked softly.
When Harry read those words on his lips, he gradually unwound himself, before speaking again. “I'm okay. And you didn't do anything wrong, it was my fault. I overreacted.”
Draco frowned, slightly suspicious now. “Can I see the notes?”
“It has been a while, hasn’t it Siri. We should meet under better circumstances next time and certainly not three years later. But of course, you are absolutely welcome for returning your Godson. He kinda already reminds me a bit of my son.” Narcissa’s smile was much larger than most people were used to seeing her wear.
Blaise looked at him sympathetically. “Out of all the houses, your in the one that people in it can relate to you most. We've all got a bit of history, as I'm sure Draco here has told you.” He finished the last bit giving Draco a slight nod.
My beta, Cheshiyre, hasn't had a chance to look over this yet, so please excuse any errors!
The boy’s-Draco’s mom spoke up before he could continue. “What’s your name sweetheart? And what does your family look like?”
Harry gave her a soft, shy smile. “You think so?”
A few moments later, the bike landed in front of the two of them and a big, bulky man with a huge beard stepped off of it. “I hope I’am nert late, I was trying ter be gen’tle. ‘Ittle tike fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol.”

“The same really, haven't had much else to do now that we don't have any more dark lords to battle.” Ron joked, though it didn't really touch his eyes. “Mione here though,” He began, nudging her slightly, “has been studying non stop for the school year. I've been
Draco gave him a small smile. “Does it say who it's from?”
Draco’s smile turned slightly crooked. "From what I’ve heard from my parents and godfather, Hogwarts is nothing if not grand."
Inside of the box, was a quill and a piece of parchment. He picked them both up and found another note underneath, with the words
Harry shook his head vigorously. “No, not at all. As you know, I didn't even know I was a wizard until about a month ago, and I hate when a ton of attention is focused on me when I can't even hear the people."
Hi everyone, sorry its been two months since I've updated. I think it's been established that I will never be able to have a concrete update schedule at this point lol.
I am so sorry it took me so long to update! I was suffering from writers block and lack of time. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter!
“Of course.” The werewolf ruffled the adorable boys hair, giving him a look of love.
Harry watched with bated breath as the teacher walked into the room, black road billowing dramatically behind him. “There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. I will teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, ensnare the senses, and even put a stopper in death--if you aren't as big of dunderheads that I usually have to teach. There are many things that one can do with ingredients and the beauty of a simmering cauldron.” the bespectacled boy was very glad that the man had given him the self-writing quill for the millionth time that day, as the teacher was at too awkward of an angle for him to read his lips.
Predictably, the floo almost immediately dinged, and he walked over to the fire to answer it.
Snape turned to Harry. “I’m going to try something.” He said slowly. “Do you think you could trust me?”
“Okay, follow me over to one of the beds and I'll start do my examination.” Madame Pomfrey said with a smile, before turning around and heading over to a bed in the very far corner of the wing. It was right up against a wall.
In turn, Draco tentatively asked him why he didn't have any school things, other than his wand. Harry had turned him down politely at his question, and told him that he didn't want to talk about it yet. Draco reluctantly accepted this, and let the subject drop for now. He would get him to tell him eventually, when he trusted him more. He wanted to do what he could to help him.
Draco looked at him worriedly. “Um, yeah. When else would you eat?”
They shared a look. “I don’t know, pup.” Moony lied (he was too young to hear the truth), “They are just very rude.” he said the last part a little louder so then their audience would hopefully look away. It mostly worked, as most people looked away in embarrassment (the death glare Padfoot gave them may have been a contributing factor.)
Hagrid gently picked Harry up from the the little sidecar of the bike and looked at him with sad, teary eyes. “I guess this is g'bye ten.”
When they let go, Hermione was giving him a bright (if a tad bit worried) smile. “Anytime. I'm just glad you talked to me about it, I - we’ve been worried about you.”
“SLYTHERIN!” the sorting hat yelled triumphantly, making sure to say it mentally in Harry’s head as well.
“You don't have to give us anything Har, we want to be nice to you because we want you to be our friend.” Pansy reassured with a smile.
“What if the other children don’t like me? The other ones I’ve met haven’t.” Harry paused, glancing up at his family and seeing the looks on their faces. “You can’t tell me they did, I’m not stupid.”
Thank you so much for your continued support! :)
This was the first time Professor Snape had spoken in a while, and Harry was very slightly surprised by it. He was also grateful that he had asked a seemingly innocent and simple question. “Dudley gets lots of attention and affection because he's not a freak like me.” his voice was even softer than usual.
exactly what he was going to say. “He needs a pair of pajamas, a toothbrush, and at least one casual outfit for the weekends.”
Harry watched in awe as Padfoot tapped at a brick wall carefully with his wand after arriving at it, causing the bricks to roll back, creating an opening in the once solid looking wall. Even after being around magic for all of his 4 years of life it still never ceased to amaze him. “Wow!” he gasped, eyes wide in delight. If he had thought the brick wall was amazing, than the whole of Diagon Alley was breathtaking.
Blaise’s usually constant smile turned into a frown as they followed Draco there (because he had the map) and he voiced his concerns. “Every single adult I've spoken too about Hogwarts has said that this is the dullest class. I mean, Binns is a ghost and he's bound to be tired of his job.”
Harry watched as the battered old pointed sorting hat was placed on his friend's head (he knew what it was called because Draco had told him on the train). It was on there for only a second before some of its folds moved, and it was quickly removed from his head and Draco walked over to a table that was obviously clapping.
”Morning Draco.” He greeted shyly.
Poppy smiled kindly at him. She was leaning on the back of the chair she had sitting in front of her facing the child’s bed, greying hair askew and worry lines etched firmly on her face from years of work tending to the wounds of unruly students. She had sweat on her brow from running around the infirmary that afternoon.
Snape’s normally steely eyes softened. “You’re welcome.” He figured saying that he didn't need to thank him wouldn't go over well just yet. “Also Harry, I was wondering if you would mind coming to Madam Pomfrey's with me for a quick check up.”
Remus was the one who spoke. “We don’t think you’re stupid pup, you are far, far from it. And, if any of those children think anything less of you or don’t like you because of who you are, than it’s their loss. Because, you are an amazing little boy, Harry and we both love you so much.”
He realized then that he had been standing outside of the compartment a few seconds too long when Rena batted hat his face from his shoulder. He smiled and pet her before quickly opening the door.
McGonagall stood there silently for a few more minutes with her arms crossed sternly and the first years watched her in anticipation.  Finally, she motioned for them to follow, and turned around and began to walk away briskly. The students followed hastily, not wanting to be left behind.  Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise looked at each other and grinned, practically bouncing up and down in excitement as they walked.
“Severus, come here for a moment, would you?” Harry read from Pomfrey’s lips, genuine fear seeping into him at the look on her face. She looked a mixture of disgust, fear, and fury. He was certain she was going to send him back to the Dursleys’.
At this, Dumbledore paled slightly and sighed. “Very well.” he said simply and handed him the sleeping child in a such a put upon fashion that in any other situation, Sirius would have snorted.
They looked aver at the school again, jumping slightly and their eyes widened  in surprise when the boat gave a slight jolt when they came to a stop. Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise all saw the other students being ushered out of their boats by Hagrid, and climbed out as well and joined them.
“Hey guys. What’ve you been up to?” Harry asked, sitting down on the bench across from them and idly petting the little kitten still curled up in his arms. Noticing that he was now seated, Rena climbed up into his shoulder and buzzed his cheek, before looking at the other two people in the room with her head tilted slightly to the side.
Remus fondly shook his head at his little boys antics from where he was sliding on his shoes a few feet away from him, leaning up against a wall. “Just a moment, Harry. Padfoot is trying to get a few things settled for our picnic.”
Snape was the first one brave enough to speak. “Harry...what was your room like...at the Dursleys?”
Snape’s normally cold, hard eyes softened at the shy boy’s soft and polite tone, further proving to him that this boy was very unlike his father. “No, nothing of the sort. I actually, wanted to-” he cleared his throat, “apologize for being very rude during class today, it was wrong of me.”
“Hey Har.”
“Okay.” He said softly, putting on a calm face. But, inside, he was panicking. He already knew Madam Pomfrey was the nurse at Hogwarts and had already figured that he would just have to avoid going there. But now he couldn't and was afraid that they were going to find out what a freak he was. His aunt and uncle would kill him if someone else knew.
Harry flashed him a huge, breathtaking grin and held out his hand for him to shake. “Hi, I’m Harry Potter. I’m kind’ve fucked up with a lot of problems but do you think that maybe you might want to be friends?”
Draco quickly gave the room a once over, before looking back at him. “They all expected you to be in Gryffindor. Your mother and father were in Gryffindor, and from what I understand, so were every one of your ancestors.”
Harry gave him a look that said ‘Uh, duh’ and it was so Remus like that they both burst into laughter. Sometimes it seemed unbelievable that the green eyed boy was only just barely 4 years old, with him acting so much older most of the time.
Harry sighed, and looked close to tears. “I um, I don’t have any robes.”
They all left the class with a smile on their faces, and headed to potions, which was their final class for the day. Harry, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco were all looking forward to it the most and so eagerly divided up into the same pairs they had in History Of Magic.
Draco took them, and quickly skimmed through them. He raised his eyebrows as he recognized the handwriting. He would recognize the flowing handwriting anywhere from the many letters his godfather had sent him over the years.
The Professor stopped the interrogation and instead decided to explain what the answers were. “For your information, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so potent it is known as The Draught Of The Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and will save you from most poisons.”
Harry blinked at him with wide eyes. “You mean I can eat
All three of them jerked around to see who the new person was and tensed when they saw a very angry looking Sirius Black. Sirius, who was typically a very easy going and un-well-serious guy, was not at all a good person to deal with when pissed off. And, right now, he was way past pissed. “Just
Harry put his book back in his bag and left it for the house elves to put in his room before collecting Rena back from Draco and allowing her to settle back in her usual spot on his shoulders. He smiled at the Slytherin and the two of them exited the compartment side by side. Harry wondered amusedly as they walked what people’s reactions are going to be when they see them being civil-
He just glanced up at him, an eyebrow raised in acknowledgement.
do you think you are doing with
Severus had to work harder to shove his anger back as he looked at Harry, who didn’t have any idea what Draco said and was fidgeting nervously.
Harry’s heart broke a little for him, as it did every time he saw the true effects and damage from the war. “You are not a Death Eater, at least not by choice. You only ever tried to do what you could to save your family. I don’t blame you for all of the things that you did. Hell, I would do the exact same thing if I were in your position. If I ever truly thought you were a Death Eater, I wouldn’t have spoken up at you and your mother’s trials.” At some point during his little speech, his voice had picked up a certain urgency that surprised even himself.
Instead of replying to Remus, Sirius ran into the room with a picnic basket in hand and a huge grin on his face. He kissed Remus on the cheek and handed him the basket before walking over to the very excited little boy. He scooped him up in his arms and tickled him, made happy by the sound of his joyous laughter. “Hey little Prongslet. Are you sure you don't want to just stay here?”
Harry of course couldn't read his lips to understand what he was saying from the distance he was away from him, and deduced that he wouldn't be able to anyway because of the long white beard the Headmaster was sporting. So, he instead took to letting his eyes roam across the teachers table. When they landed on a strange looking teacher wearing a purple turban, Harry suddenly felt a sharp pain in the lightning bolt scar that rested on his forehead. He gently but subtly rubbed it, smashing down the suspicious feeling he had for now, before his eyes landed on a teacher two seats down from the purple turban wearing teacher. It just so happened, that this particular teacher had his eyes on him. The teacher had dark, almost greasy hair, a crooked nose, and had on black robes. The teacher surprisingly didn't look at him with the malice that adults and the majority of the Great Hall were showing him. He was only looking at him in extreme curiosity. Harry frowned in confusion.
Harry turned his expression into one of unfeeling, which was much more familiar to him than it should have been. “I don't know sir.”
Just Like Breathing by Sandra
Poppy knew that he wasn't telling the whole truth, and she didn't want to not did she have the strength to push him further at the moment. The way he said the last sentence he said-- like it was ingrained into him… It hurt her to her soul.
Harry wrung his hands together in nervousness as they walked through the doors of the hospital wing. All he could think about the entire way there was about what they were going to find. His aunt and uncle were going to murder him when they sent him back for his freakishness.
“And if any of them give you a hard time, they’ll have me to answer to.” Sirius added, tickling a clearly cheered Harry.
He looked up when Draco tapped him on his shoulder. “You seem deep in thought, what’s on your mind?”
Harry ended up having so much fun with his two new friends that didn't even notice when his godfathers walked away to introduce themselves to a watching Molly Weasley. He was just so over the moon about the fact that he actually found other children who liked him, who seemed to understand him, that he focused everything he had on interacting with them.
I know, I know. It’s been so long. I haven’t updated in almost 2 years. I just kinda...got in a funk. Life took over. When I was writing this story originally, I didn’t really know what it was like to socialize a lot and be outside of my comfort zone. I just kind lived forever in my own introverted bubble. And then, I started dating Emily, and life just kinda started to make sense. I got my license, fell in love, and learned what it felt like to really and truly live. To love someone and to be loved. It’s been amazing and a journey. I’m going to do my best to keep updating the story, and I had time to at least update once during this because of self-quarantine during the Covid-19 pandemic.
He thought back to a week ago, when he, Ron, and Hermione had gone to Diagon Alley. He smiled slightly. It had been a fun time, he had laughed and joked with his friends, and picked up the things on his list of stuff that he needed for Hogwarts. But the main part of his trip that made it so great, was a purchase that he made that wasn't on his list. They had been passing the pet shop, and he had glanced over, and a tiny black kitten with white spots on one of its eyes and two of its feet, ran out of the doors when someone had left. He paused from his walking in shock, ready to quickly stop the runaway kitty, but it had just ran right towards him and climbed up his leg before coming to rest in a sitting position on his shoulder. He remembered, chuckling quietly to himself, that the cat had looked at home on his shoulder, as if it had belonged there. His friends we're looking on at the scenario in both mild shock and amusement, and Harry shook his head and motioned for them to follow him into the store. He had decided then and there that if the little runaway kitten didn't have and owner, than she would by the time he left the store. As it turned out after talking to the store clerk, she was the runt of her litter, but with her adventures tendencies and joyful attitude, you wouldn't have been able to tell. The clerk had joked that if she didn't know any better, she would think that the kitten was muggle puppy. Harry then expressed his interest in adopting her, and the clerk smiled and told him the price and that the kitten was female. Harry smiled and quickly grabbed the essentials for his new pet before thanking and paying the woman. His friends had told him to meet them outside of the quidditch supply shop during the whole ordeal, so he had met them there, officially introducing the kitten the them and smiling the widest that he had in a long time. “Guys, this is Rena.” His friends had smiled at his lit up expression, glad to see him happy. Hermione of course had asked why he had chosen the name that he did, and he had told her that it was because the name meant
What Harry had failed to notice at first after his sorting however, was the fact that everyone except for his friends (whom had clapped wildly at his sorting) had all stilled the moment he was sorted, and were staring at him in shock. Even all of the professors were giving him the same surprised expression, and he felt extremely uncomfortable.
When they entered the room, they were automatically bombarded with the sent of old books, standing out to Harry the most with his heightened sense of smell. As they looked around, the sent made since as there were books apon book lining every available wall in the room (save the one that has the door and a small area where the chalkboard was). Weird as it was, Harry kinda felt a bit at home in the classroom, reminded of the many times he had snuck away to read in the Library that was a couple blocks away from the Dursleys’.
Hermione fixed him with a half hearted glare. “This school year is very important. This is our last year, and we have to study to get our NEWTs.”
Moony was watching this exchange in amusement. He rolled his eyes at his boyfriend's antics as he followed him out the door. He sometimes felt as if he were raising two children instead of one. “Come on Padfoot.” he said, rolling his eyes at the guy who was now running around in circles in the yard.
He was relieved that he hadn’t just shot down his question all together, like he was so used to happening at the Dursleys’, and nodded.
Harry looked over to Draco at his nod and gave him a small smile, before looking back at the rest of the Great Hall. People weren’t blatantly staring at him anymore and were more pointing and clearly whispering to each other at him. Harry was shocked when the majority of them suddenly started down at their table like it was the most interesting thing in the world, and looked over at Draco and Blaise. He smiled slightly when he saw that the two of them, as well as Pansy and a few other nearby Slytherins (whom had apparently, to his bewilderment) taken a liking to him, giving them terrible death glares.
Harry shifted nervously under Poppy’s asessive gaze. “Hello Ma’am.” He greeted respectively, hoping that it would stop her prying eyes.
“Yeah, you can help us do the squiggle squabbles.” Ginny told Harry with a bright smile and even though said boy had no idea what she was talking about, he automatically jumped out from behind the leg that was concealing him and joined them.
The boy’s pale blue eyes were soft, and much like Harry’s, looked wise beyond their years. “Of course. I’m Draco Malfoy, and this is Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.” he said, motioning to each person respectively. “And these are my parents.” He motioned to a blond haired man and woman that were watching them curiously.
A/N - This may be my fave chapter yet. Is this going too fast? I really need to remember all the things that I have mentioned otherwise I will forget the plot. Lord, no one told me writing stories this big was such hard work!
"Are you a Death Eater?"
The adults frowned slightly at Harry's reaction before finally taking a seat opposite the boys. "What's wrong child?" Lucius asked hesitantly. Harry released a choked sob, looking down into his hands. Alarm flooded across everyone's faces, looking at each other in bewilderment and nervousness. "Child, we can't help if you don't tell us what's wrong." Narcissa said softly, kneeling next to the crying teen. "Me!!! I'm what's wrong! I-I'm a freak, I sh-shouldn't want what Draco said but I did and it's wrong-I'm wrong." He sobbed harder as Narcissa pulled him into her lap.
"DRACO!"
"I'm sorry my boy, what was that last bit?" Professor Flitwick encouraged.
at my best mate! Smiled!!! Malfoy sighed, "well it was going to come out sooner or later." He said.
His parents died when he was young, and he doesn't remember them anyway. His childhood was filled with hateful comments and beatings 24/7 – no love there either. When he joined Hogwarts, he felt like he was finally, finally going to be loved.
Harry's punishments at the end of the holiday:
"Okay, spill." Pansy demanded.
I lunged at him and wrapped my arms around his neck. He barely caught me and just supported my arse before claiming my lips in an explosive kiss.
YESSSSSS I WIN THE BET!!, he thought.
what I found.
Harry stepped closer than he thought he ever could and brought his hands from his sides to rest upon the back of Draco's neck, and tilted his head deepening the kiss. One if the blonds hands fell from where it was cupping the back if Harry's head and fell to his waist pulling him closer to get the angle just right.
Harry deemed his letter informative enough yet kept it quite simple, just to peak Snape's interest so that he helps him. Harry snickers to himself, how very slytherin of you. He sent it off with Hedwig, telling her to be as inconspicuous as possible then got ready for bed.
"I'll get it Sev," Draco said, already up and walking to the window. When he got to the window, he gasped. "Hey, Sev?" Severus hummed in response. Draco hesitated, looking back with confusion all over his face. "Why is Potter writing to you?"
"Hey guys! Guess what?" Harry's cheerful voice came back as he stepped into the room.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Really?" He asked in a disbelieving tone.
Unknown_Persons ~ thanks for the request! I hope you like it. :) - THIS WAS A REQUEST ON WATTPAD. You can request if you wish, just find me on wattpad? *shrugs*
But no. His friends don't love him. They just want him for the connections, the fame, the money. The person he wanted love from the most hated his guts. This person hated him for rejecting him. But the truth was, Harry didn't want to reject him. He was too busy staring at him with awe and he panicked. It was like someone else said the words but they came out of his mouth. He wanted to fix it, but the damage was done.
Draco scoffed. "Pans, it would be Malfoy-Potter, I'm hotter than Potter so I go first."
hair. However, that
So..... what do you think? I feel like my writing has progressed slightly over the course of this. The chapters are slowly getting longer lol. I have already gone through the earlier chapters and tried to make them longer but it didn't make much of a difference not gonna lie.
When he did finally see Draco, his heart shattered. It was when they stepped off the train, Draco stood there bags under his eyes, wide eyes alert, flinching when someone so much as looks at him. He was so skinny, underfed almost and was covered in scars. He no longer held his head up, it was down, chin into his chest almost, hair in his eyes yet he didn't move it away. It was almost like he was hiding behind it.

Harry and Draco stepped inside the room giggling. They were holding hands and as there were no more empty seats, they sat on the floor by the roaring fire, cuddling as a sign of affection. "This fire is a bit hot Har," Draco said to Harry. Harry snorted and moved his body so he shielded his boyfriend from most of the heat. Draco practically melted and Severus cooed in delight. A sudden flash made everyone blink in astonishment and the small house elf squeaked in mortification. "Clopsy forgot to turn the flash off... Clopsy is very sorry... It won't happen again! But everyone was just so happy and-and I couldn't help myself because everyone was so cute and-and I-I am sorry but I wanted the gift to be-be a surprise but it won't be any-"
"Of course Lady Malfoy. Help yourselves." The man looked like he was about to cry. Narcissa Malfoy had that effect on people.
"Suspicious..." he murmured but still loud enough for Harry to hear.
"No way!! That's the same as me!! Carrot and Angua are sooooo cute!" he squealed clasping his hand together and grinning at Harry.
Remus and Sirius sat down on the empty sofa cuddling up close. Narcissa and Lucius were leaning on each other and Tom had Severus in between his legs dozing slightly.
Draco hated his 8th year. The only thing he loved about it was the fact he had a flag. It was like a massive blanket and you could use it as one too. On it, you can decide the colours, the writing and the designs. He had his as Draco Malfoy – Gay as fuck – Anti Social as fuck. It was an emerald green with silver writing. The pattern was much like the British flag but just green. It was on his bed as a throw for now.
*Outside*
I cant believe Harry was looking at me! She is so cute. I think I may try find her a present today. It'll be for when I ask her out.
Smiling once more, Narcissa reminded the boys to get dressed as soon as possible and come down for some waffles.
Eighth year, they got so much shit for being 'on the wrong side'. What everyone doesn't know, was that my Love helped save us all. If it wasn't for them or their mother, I would be dead and the world we live in now would be very different.
"Call him that and misuse his pronouns again and I will hex you into next week." He said in a dangerously low voice, glaring at her heatedly. "Draco is a better person than you ever will be. He made mistakes and i think you will find he paid for them. He doesn't need to pay anymore. Don't call him a Death Eater. Now, get the hell out of my house. I will not have you spitting on people I love. Get out." He roared and lunged at her.
what I meant to say. I AM TOO TIRED FOR THIS SHIT!
He always tried to work out who it is, but only in his free time, never on a walk. It was fully grown, so must be an adult, or seventh year up. That narrowed it down a bit. It had multiple scars across its back and one on its face, but many were on its legs hidden by its long shaggy hair. Draco knew someone with shaggy hair like the dogs. It couldn't be him, could it?
Draco sighed. Pansy, Pansy, Pansy. If she is meddling with him again, he will burn and destroy all her hair products and makeup.
"Come along beautiful boy of mine. We must get you gorgeous clothes to go with your breathtaking body." Harry laughed before waving goodbye to his godfather and his werewolf.
Harry had a sinking feeling that Dumbledore was a part of this scheme too. He should watch his back. If only he had agreed with the hat in First Year then he would be with the Slytherins. Maybe he should toy with the Gryffindor's for a bit, act cunning like a Slytherin. Harry hummed, yes, he should play with the Gryffindor's. This will be fun!
The Slytherins scowled at him and the Gryffindors looked affronted. They started to perform the charm with determination.
October 31st, my parents were killed. I was orphaned and Dumbledore ensured I was placed with my muggle relatives – Petunia and Vernon Dursley. He left a letter with a large amount of money in to ensure my 'wellbeing'. My 'wellbeing' isn't what you would have expected from the 'Chosen one'. You would've thought it was meant to pamper me, give me the best luxuries money could buy. I didn't get that. I was treated worse than a house elf. I still am."
Fuck. She is going to say no now, isn't she?
As he apparated away, he remembered Harry. He had obviously done this, the abuse and anger must have finally gotten to him, he thought with a grim smile. Shame he ran away, not it will take him a while to find him and keep him on a tight leash.
Ron glared at Harry and advanced towards him. He grabbed the smaller boy by the front of his robes and pulled him towards him with their faces right up close. “What was that Potter? Laughing at me were you?” he snarled.
"Knowing you, Professor, you are probably confused as to why I called my 'best friend' by his surname. I discovered something very interesting before the holidays. I am not sure if you are aware of where the Weasels and the Muggleborn's loyalties lie, but know for sure that they aren't with me. They never were. They lie with fame, money and Dumbledore. I know you are a spy, and I'm pretty sure it is for Riddle not Dumbledore. How on earth did you manage to convince the old coot you were on his side? I congratulate you; it must have been challenging." Severus grumbled, "That boy is way too observant" Lucius snickered.
"Excuse you! There is so much sexual tension you get bloody nosebleeds!"
It wasn't hard to find or lose the Weasley's. You couldn't miss their bright red hair and they were making so much noise. People would glare at them as they passed and many were shoved to the side so the noisy bunch could pass.
No one moved. "I don't bite. Unless, you're scared of finding your soulmate...?" That did it. Two boys stepped out looking down at the ground. Professor Flitwick gasped. "Oh my, I should have seen this coming. Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter." Two heads snapped upwards so fast looking at each other with wide eyes. Hermione and Pansy giggled. They both turned and glared at their best friend before looking back down at the floor.
Ten minutes later, both boys were dressed in simple but beautiful robes that oozed authority and money. Harry's were slightly too big as they were Draco's but he didn't mind. Draco thought it was adorable and sexy as fuck that his soulmate is borrowing his clothes.
Oh well, I hope I can talk to her later at Hogsmeade.
A/N PLEASE READ LOVELIES!!
‘When you rejected me in first year, I felt angry. Angry that you dared refuse a Malfoy what he wants. I felt sad, knowing that you didn’t want to know me. I grew with hearing stories about you. My mum would read me the same story every night, the one where you, a baby, stood up to the most evil man in the world, and destroyed him. I also felt like crying. It was a horrible feeling. Nobody except my family have ever made me cry. And there you were. An 11-year-old boy, with baggy clothes, adorable glasses, messy raven hair and the most enchanting eyes I have ever seen and I realised in that moment, I wanted you to be mine. In any way possible. So, when you rejected me, I couldn’t be your best friend. Or even a friend. I wanted something unique to me and you. So I fought you. I became your ‘rival’. It was the only way I could stay in your attention and not hide in the background.’ Draco pulled harry closer and nuzzled into his hair.
"Perfect! Now let's practice the whole charm. Avis!" Professor Flitwick's wand produced a couple of swans making the whole class gasp in awe. "Now you try!"
After stuffing themselves full of waffles, everyone thanked the house elves before rushing to the floo. They each called out 'Diagon Alley', threw a pinch of floo powder and disappeared through the green flames, reappearing out the other side in the Leaky Cauldron.
The goblin took his time fetching the required paperwork and by the time he came back to the redheads, Molly was shaking with rage. Her face was turning a colour just as red as her hair. When the Goblin asked for identification, she almost lost it,
Draco cleared his throat and a faint blush washed across his cheeks before responding to the boy who he thought was really an angel in disguise. "Yes, I'm fine Harry," he smiled briefly, eyes darting around the table before lighting up when they saw a certain dish. "Would you like some treacle tart Harry?" He asked sweetly, making Lucius snort at Draco's attempt at regaining Harry's attention. He quickly glared at his father before looking at Harry finding adoration shining through his eyes towards Draco. Draco felt the jealousy in his chest subside for now. He grabbed a plate and then proceeded to plop 4 treacle tarts on the ceramic before passing it to Harry with a fork.
He gazed into Draco's molten silver eyes and  silently closed the gap between their lips. Draco closed his eyes as he felt Harry timidly move his lips against Draco's.
‘Please stop. No please! Don’t touch me! No please! No-’
McGonagall gasped. "No! No way! When?!?!"
Another pointed cough made My Draco giggle into my mouth so I sighed against his lips and pulled away to glare at the person who dares to disturb my make out session.
Harry giggled, "You would know all about being indecorous wouldn't you Draco. Don't think I didn't see you staring at my ass when I left to go to the bathroom!" Lucius practically howled before his wife who was biting back her own peals of laughter smacked him lightly. Draco buried his head in his hands. "Merlin I hate you all. Except Tom, Tom is nice to me."
"Potter?"
Once the floo had spat everyone out, they split up into three groups. Narcissa, Harry and Draco left to get clothes for Harry whilst Lucius fetched Harry's school books for the year. Tom and Severus pondered off towards an apothecary to get potion ingredients for a special potion.
It looked something like this:
I took the box from her and read it's little note.
Making his presence known when visitors are here ~ 50 lashes and 4 days no food {total: 0 times}
“I love you so much Haz.”
"Draco?" I pushed a box to her. She carefully opened it and then gasped. "Draco it is beautiful! I love it!"
"To be honest, Hermione, I thought you were Umbridge for a moment." I smirked at her as she flushed red before glaring at me. Draco giggled into my chest, his tall, lanky body shaking as he laughed.
A small silver wisp.
Draco fucking Malfoy.
Harry smiled a little, "What about Malfoy-Potter?" he whispered.
Called.
Ginny gasps and her eyes lit up. “Ohhhh thanks Malfoy!” She leaps at him and squeals loudly in his ear making him wince. I snigger and he shoots a glare at me.
Ron splutters, face blossoming a light pink.
expecting Harry bloody Potters Holy Hand in my
Meanwhile, Ginny was injured in her last game. A bludger hit her arm, shattering the bone. She was sent home to rest. As the her bones were settling, she couldn't apparate or use a portkey, and flying was it of the question. Instead she had to walk 7 miles to the nearest overseas floo and floo home. It took her a day to get home and she was exhausted. When she got home, it was unnaturally quiet for a Sunday morning.
"You're mum is
Do please let me know where I can improve.
"Oh yeah? What if I ask you to do something? What then?"
"Guests?" Draco asked. Lucius smirked at the two soulmates who were intertwined under a blanket on the sofa. "Yes, guests. They wanted more information and I suspect one of them is going to try and give you a sex talk..."
I huffed out a breath and watched the a cloud of the hot air form in front of my face before evaporating off. Snowflakes kept falling onto my hair and shoulders. Why did I come out here thirty minutes early??!! I am an idiot.
: DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY
He grins and kisses me in front of everyone, ignoring all the looks.
Neville, to my right gave me a sniff. “Yeah, Harry! You smell bloody gorgeous!!” He then reached out to me but was stopped when a hand came in between us. Immediately I felt safe but all the Gryffindor’s growled at my saviour. I frowned and turned to my saviour.
Suddenly, Hermione pointed at me and then looked to Harry who gasped and giggled. She was smiling at me! Harry was looking at me! But, why was she giggling?
I have something to show you. Meet me at the Astronomy Tower after dinner.
“Harry mate? What’s up? Are you okay?” Ron asks me with concern flickering through his eyes. “Um no, I’m feeling a little unwell guys. I think imma head to bed early tonight. Goodnight guys.” I replied pushing back my chair and hopping to my feet. Hermione gasped, “Harry!” I panicked. “What? What is wrong Mione??” My eyes must have shown fear and panic as she immediately stood up to calm me down. “No, no, Harry I’m fine. It’s just, you look beautiful, angelic.” She sighed. “I wish I could keep you.” She was staring at me longingly now swaying slightly where she sat as if she was entranced.
They were standing in the middle of the eighth year common room with the rest of the eighth years talking (well, arguing) about favourite books. Hermione had just accused Harry of not having read anything fictional, or not read anything at all!
We have hidden for 19 years.
." He winked cheekily at the two teenagers. Draco chuckled before replying. "Not yet dear cousin, but I hope soon." Harry looked up face flaming at his mate and opened his mouth to speak when Remus interrupted. "You two have the same scent. What is going on?"
My unwelcome companion huffs.
Punishment to be handed out:
P.S Recently, I have been infatuated with flying saucers.
As I craned my neck to look up at him, I felt something in my hair. Something heavy. Soft yet gentle. I frowned and patted my head. I was
Harry finished in the bathroom, chuckling at the expensive soap on the sink as he washed his hands. Once he had finished he stood there, staring into the mirror. His hair was greasy from not being able to shower and he felt so unclean. He couldn't wait for a lovely hot shower. He observed that he didn't hurt anymore, the scars were faded instead of being an angry red, pushing up on his skin and there were no bruises. Was this from the golden light thingy?
Break anything ~ 2 days no food and 10 lashes of the belt {total: 9 times}
It was Fenrir Greyback.
"Didn't think." Draco replied, teeth chattering as he burrowed into Harry's warmth. "Of course you didn't." Harry scoffed quietly. "Come on, let's get you somewhere warm, eh?"
"Well fuck me." was all Vernon said before punching Draco.
Draco smiles evilly. “Oh, nothing. I have a potions essay to write, I’ll see you later, eh Weasel?”
Draco sighed. "No Pansy, he does not have a gay name but there is one he wants but he says it is too embarrassing. In other words, he didn't tell me."
"Shower sex? Didn't know you were into that."
why you were being nice to the Slytherins and cruel to the Gryffindors!" Harry grinned. "Yup! I wanted to show I was in control now. Not them.
"It has been 4 months. 4
It is so unfair how he will never want me as I want him – a boyfriend. I love his walk, the way he swaggers and keeps his head high and those gorgeous silver eyes…
I missed his eyes. They're gorgeous.
Pansy saw where I was looking and smirked. "She totally likes you Dray."
Harry whimpered. "Will you let me? Let me claim you all?" "YES PLEASE DRACO CLAIM ME!" "Pretty boy begging aren't you. And you're so polite. Alright then." And with that Draco threw a locking charm at the door, raised a muffliato and got to work.
My love helped me discover the basilisk that year we started dating.
"Nonsense!" Tom exclaimed. "Potter has written a letter to my husband, and I want to know what is in it. Mainly because I want a drink..." Severus sighed. "If you wanted a drink, you could just get a drink love." Tom just smiled sheepishly.
Harry resolved to kiss, no
"HARRY JAMES POTTER WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!?" She screamed, waking the two men up from their peaceful slumber. Harry tightened his arms around the blond and pulled him close to his chest.
I am NOT drooling.
"Hello to you to, Potter."
"What. Is. That." I pointed at her necklace, glaring at it mutinously as I fingered my own necklace with the Malfoy ring on around my neck. My fingers are really chubby and I get scared that I won't be able to take it off even though I could use magic. Pansy looked amused and played along. "Oh. This?" She picked it up with a nail and asked innocently.
"I'm a horcrux!" Harry practically shouted before sobbing. Hermione and Ron were immediately at his side as the Slytherins just gaped at him. No way? Not possible!
Harry wore the necklace today. Just the necklace. It really suits her.
Why was that the first time Tom had seen Sevvie grin like that in years??
"Harry James Malfoy-Potter, will you please just kiss me already!? I haven't seen you for 4 months! I missed you!" I don't care that I'm whining.
Harry giggled, "Well yeah, and anyways Malfoy I thought we were using first names. Or did our kiss mess with your memory?"
Tom sprung up immediately and banished the papers into a neat pile on the desk before turning to Mrs Weasley and pointing his wand at her. Gringotts was silent. Everyone had turned to face the scene and many were not breathing.
Harry's life is pretty good. Ginny plays beater for the Hollyhead Harpies and is often away for months at a time. Harry owns a flower shop, named Lily's after his mother. He keeps himself busy when his girlfriend is gone. But a few months ago, Harry got some news from one of the girls on Ginny's team that shook his world.
Harry and Draco meet about 4 times a week. Turns out, they got along very well. They both like the same quidditch teams, have the same views on the new Minister - Hermione Granger (both think she is brilliant) and they both are stuck on what to do about Ginny.
A/N - This made me laugh and smile whilst I wrote it. Its just a quick one. Hope you enjoyed!!
"That was very impressive how you dealt with Clopsy, Harry." Tom looked at Harry questionably. "How do you know how to calm an elf down?" Harry looked furious before spitting out – "The Weasley's. They own a poor, ancient house elf named Pokka but they called him Bastard. I was the only one to call him Pokka, and the Weasley's all tried to stop me but I did not. I was always furious with how they treated poor Pokka. I tricked Ron into freeing him, and the elf wanted to bond with me. I said I couldn't, and I'm sorry but he could go work at the Lovegood's. The needed another house elf. Pokka popped away and I see him every now and again when I talk to Luna."
Draco gaped, finally deriving a conclusion. "Potter is abused??"
“Oh harry darling, I doubt they even could if they tried. You’re so powerful baby.” He whispered the last bit in my ear with a smirk covering his beautiful face.
SUMMARY/REQUESTED PLOT: Can I have female Drarry? Please?
What a load of bullshit.
I need to write notes for her. And I need to ask Hermione if I can have the password for the Gryffindor dorms or if she can help me set this up...
He has told Albus time and time again that they treat him like scum. He told him that they hit him, smack him, burn him, cut him, scratch him, starve him, bruise him and scar him. And does Albus care? Not one fucking bit. He said to Harry - "Harry, my boy, please stop telling lies. I'm sure you making things out to be worse than they actually are." Harry was furious when he heard those works come out of Albus' mouth.
Harry looked up at him, "Really?" he asked slightly breathless. Draco glowered at Lucius, wanting Harry's expression of delight and happiness aimed at him. Lucius saw his sons jealousy and smirked, making Draco glower harder. Harry noticed Draco's expression and snickered quietly. "Something wrong Draco?" Harry asked, innocently.
Draco scoffed. "Psht, don't say such hurtful things Harry, or I shall be forced to kiss you again." He grinned even though Harry couldn't see it.
Harry gasps and flings himself at Draco. Draco, not expecting this action falls backwards onto the floor with harry on top of him. He grabs the smaller boy and made sure he was ok. ‘Harry? Are you hurt? Are you okay? What’s wrong?’
Fortunately, Severus was already there shoving potions down Harry's throat. Tom had entered the kitchen to find the other two muggles. Once Severus was satisfied that he had choked Harry with enough potions he moved onto Draco. Harry originally hadn't seen Draco as Severus was in the way but when he did, he howled in anger and threw himself onto Vernon who was laying on the floor in pain.
"MALFOY I SWEAR TO MERLIN IF YOU DON'T PUT ME DOWN I'LL-"
A way to remember whom you love, to remember them in the worst of times, to know your love is absolute.
"And-and I thought I had it bad! I was held down and tortured and then branded with this ugly mark as a punishment for my father's failings and- and my mother was force to watch me scream in pain and I have to get the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore and this is a suicide mission 'cos it is impossible but that was the point I'm just useless and I can be used as a pawn, die when I'm told to die and I'm so scared. I'm so scared..." Draco trailed off as he collapsed to the floor sobbing his heart out. Harry ripped himself away from his friend's arms to go comfort his soulmate.
Severus sighed dreamily, imagining Minerva's face as she handed the money over. He slammed the door shut with a "Have fun boys!" as he pranced off, giggling as he went to tell Lucius.
Laughter followed the watchers as they were pulled back to the present.
A/n Not gonna lie, this is kinda a filler chapter. Sorry lovelies x
In the end, I walked out in a pair of blue jeans, a type of soft leather boots which were lined in fur, a thick jumper with a soft and warm coat over the top. I wore simple grey coloured glove, hat and scarf. My hair was done half up half down with the second hair accessory i got. I felt like it was more wintery themed than the other. I wore my rings and the necklace too. I can't wait to see who my courtier is!
Harry laughed, "I don't care, I love them!"
"What did you expect?! He is so cute!!"
Ginny scowls at Draco before turning to Harry with a flirtatious look on her face. "But Harry, you're not gay!"
"What are you doing?! You can't just have sex, Harry needs rest and Draco you need to finish your homework! And anyway, we need to speak to you about what happened at the muggles house!" Narcissa was standing their, furious as her husband stood behind her eyes glinting in amusement.
'That as well, but it also means we'll have to throw a Christmas party to have any hope of getting out of the house and get to the Burrow Christmas Dinner.'
I say that's already sorted, don't you think?' Harry replied.
A brand-new home just in time for Christmas was just the thing, the very best present either could have gifted the other.
, one that was just theirs, with no old memories attached to it, no ghosts lurking in the corners, or proverbial or literal (because who really knew, these post-war days) skeletons in the cupboards, what luxury it would be. All the memories that they made here would be theirs and theirs alone, new and bright, future beckoning to them in this house with promise both hadn’t dared dream of. And the past wouldn't be present here like it would have been anywhere else, in all those places that they had once called
A house,
He sighed, realizing that Harry had missed the point.
'Yes.'
His husband's smile was blinding. 'That we will. Shall we repair to our bedchamber now, husband mine?'
a nice house, even providing them with a bedside drawer full of… materials. The slide of their bodies against one another had never been quite so slick and they had properly taken ownership of their bedroom and no mistake.
'Mine,' Draco said.
That single word stirred deep desires within Harry and he knew that he would do anything for this man beside him and could never let him go, even if he asked. He hoped Draco d never ask, because he was hopelessly lost on him.
Severus came out of the cupboard under the stairs furious. Who would dare do this to a child?! This was worse than his own abuse. There were chains where he suspected Harry was chained to the wall and there was so much blood. So, so much blood. He grimaced, "Right time to g-woah." He breathed. A beautiful golden light in the middle of the hallway surrounded Draco and Harry.
Harry bolted up and turned around to face the voice. He recognised it, but wasnt sure why. Low, very deep and, it was quite similar to a growl. He took in the big, thick coat hanging off broad shoulders packed full of muscle, the tshirt stretched so thin over a muscular chest that the man should have not even bothered to put one on. Dark jeans wrapped around thick thighs and unlaced boots finished the outfit. Shaggy hair was pulled up into a bun on the back if the mans head which was covered in scars.
I make a pained expression and try to give Draco puppy dog eyes. I don’t know if it will work, I mean he hates me but I hope he does something.
Did this give anyone the wintery feel I was trying (and failing) to portray? My writing is shit sorry.
Hermione sighed, "Oh come on Ron! Would it really be that bad if they did come back engaged? Their practically married already with the amount of arguing they do!"
"Oh my!" Narcissa gasped. Tom continued.
. Doing. Here."
Harry turned around and looked at me. Malfoy looked scared. Strange. "Oh we are just arguing about who gets who's surname when we get married." Harry said and turned back towards Malfoy. "Anyways, we keep
"3..."
When Severus finally stopped twirling around madly, he grinned at the blushing boys making Draco hold Harry possessively close to him, as if to protect him from their mad teacher. Severus giggled.
He stood there shaking like a leaf until Draco slowly walked over to him, making sure Harry could track his movements. He reached out a little too fast and Harry flinched. Narcissa gasped behind them. Draco decided to try again; he reached out once more, slower this time, and placed his hand gently, ever so gently on Harry's cheek. Harry closed his eyes silently and unconsciously nuzzled into Draco's hand. Draco couldn't stop the smile creeping up onto his face, just as Harry couldn't help the sigh that escaped his lips.
No one answered and Harry was starting to get impatient. "IS THAT CLEAR?" he repeated, his anger showing. They all gulped and a chorus of 'yes Harry' emanated from them. He nodded his head, satisfied and walked off to his class.
"What Pansy?!" I snapped. I am
There was half a bottle left of Ogdens finest and two glasses lay next to it on the coffee table. Weird.
Harry took a breath. "Could- could you call me Harry?" He looked up at Draco. "Please? Was added as an after thought. "A-and could I call you Draco?..."
Draco pushed himself up onto his forearms. "Really?" he whispered in reply.
And squealed in joy!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry gulped before turning to Draco's door. He waved his wand to check for any charms and found nothing so he quietly and carefully opened the door. He slipped in silently closing the door behind him. It was pitch-black meaning Draco must been asleep. He tiptoed over to a bed, it was against a wall under a bookshelf but there was no body inside. He looked around, confused. Then he saw him.
The two boys stood there, sweating and panting, faces flushed red as they watched their normally stoic and serious potions professor jump around squealing like a schoolgirl who was just asked out by her crush.
Draco snickered as he heard the boy yell after him. “MALFOY!!!”
A/N Cute right?
Both boys flushed the deepest red they could and didn't dare look around. They were too busy biting their lips and trying not to giggle to notice the adults that were basically right next to them.
Forever.
This is like, the longest fic ever. 😂 Jokes.
"Now," Narcissa smiled sickly sweet at Me Coalfield. "I want a whole wardrobe in Harry's size. Draco here, will help Harry with colours, sizes and designs. You, Mr Coalfield, will run around like the chubby hamster you are and follow
I pull Draco closer to me. He slots perfectly, just like he always has.
As the Gryffindors sat in Harry and Neville's dorm, the conversation started to turn into games such as never have I ever and Truth or Dare. They played late into the night, never leaving the room until one dare...
As Harry slipped into unconscious, his last thoughts were about Snape and if he was going to save him.
Draco smiled and placed his head in Harry's neck, "I love you too Harry." He replied, lips moving against Harry's neck making the taller boy shudder. Draco smirked. "You like that Harry? I wonder what else you like," He purred seductively into Harry's ear.
I scowl at him before kicking him under the table.
"Mm, I can definitely find some ways to shut you up..." he purred.
They entered the shop and were immediately pounced upon by Mr Coalfield himself. He looked a bit pissed and was eyeing Harry suggestively.
Harry had just sighed in content when a rude cough startled them, causing to jump apart red faced and panting.
I saw it, and thought of you.
This problem stuck with Harry for weeks. Ginny was away for 4 months this time and so he was very lonely. Ginny forbade him to get a pet. He didnt understand why; it was for him when she wasn't there!
“That the ginger whore just accepted that BS like she was starving and that you like me back.”
