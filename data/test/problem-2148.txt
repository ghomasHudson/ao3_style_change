"Of course," Harry stumbled, "I'm not accustomed to this. I'll be happy to get used to it, though, I think." He turned to the guard that had just returned from taking away the last reject. "Remove the
“I don’t mean we should actually have sex!” Harry clarified. “Not the first time we go out, anyway.” He winked at Neville and Neville laughed.
Draco grasped Harry’s right hand with his left, then took hold of Harry’s left hand with his right. Then he crowded in close and kissed Harry delicately on the lips.
It wasn't long at all before Malfoy left the room. At first he seemed content to sneer at Harry and swoosh past, robes almost afloat. Rather like Snape. But then he was suddenly pressing Harry into the wall, arms around Harry's torso, face in Harry's face. Harry was too shocked to do anything more threatening than attempt what he was sure was a half-hearted sneer. He put his hands on Malfoy's chest but didn't shove back - he wanted only a bit of distance between their faces. But it wasn't distance he created, as Malfoy felt thin and warm through his robes. Harry felt his eyes open even wider. He couldn't think of a single thing to say.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Hard, you say? Fast?” His hand was millimetres from Draco’s prick, and Draco was straining to stay still. “Dirty?”
“You don’t have to trick me into staying, Draco. And I appreciate the little things you do for me. All of them.” Harry kissed Draco on the lips. “And, perhaps even better, I think I can finally set aside the five days I expect it’ll take to install that Fusion Doorway.”
"Accio ring," Draco said, catching on, and the one that was merely held, the replacement that Harry had charmed to return easily, nearly flew from the fingers of the King's pretty young wife. Frustrated, Harry darted forward into the mess of furious merpeople and snatched the ring they needed from the finger of the mermaid. "I'm sorry," he whispered, and she looked into his eyes in terror, but he did not dare release her.
Harry looked up from a book about warding homes in densely Muggled areas and the resultant side effects of all that nearby electricity. “You had it before dinner, right? The one you were using to shop for birthday presents?”
Draco found himself rather secretly impressed along with being confused. He’d worried a bit about how his father would react (before he’d been sentenced to life in prison and it became a moot point), but only because Lucius had dropped enough hints over the years that Draco knew Lucius thought he’d be able to control Draco’s wife much the way he controlled Draco’s mother. Lucius would have expected a son-in-law to be harder to manipulate or bully. Once Draco’s father had been sentenced and taken away, Draco faced stigma for that, but for liking men? Except perhaps his mum, who else would care? Apparently, that wasn’t the way it worked for a lot of Muggles.
Draco waited as discreetly as possible, considering he was at least six inches taller than most wizards who were not his father, and he was a convicted Death Eater in the handsome anteroom of the Minister for Magic’s office.
He looked at Afelgate, who nodded enthusiastically, and the door opened to admit two nearly naked slaves, both scowling at the floor, as they often did.
Draco watched Harry come, as requested. He ejaculated enthusiastically inside Harry. He cleaned Harry gently while they finished showering, then he asked Harry to wear a particular jumper under his school robes. “Looks good on you,” he said, without a shred of insecurity or self-consciousness.
Robards sighed again, but this time it sounded a bit faked. "So yes, Potter. I will give you this assignment."
Luckily, he spoke French. He’d taken to traveling to Francophone wizarding populations and visiting their gay bars. His favourite weekend portkey was to Senegal’s Dakar. The wizards there spoke beautiful, clear French, ate well and danced dirty. Most recognized his Dark Mark, so romance was out, but a weekend of fun had so far always been of interest for at least one handsome gentleman.
Though they’d fucked nearly a dozen times, tonight felt different. It wasn’t that Draco felt shy. More that Harry seemed to be treating him
? They hadn’t been spotted in Draco’s hall, or the lift, or even the lobby. Was that an accident, or had Harry somehow made that happen?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Soon they’d sent Narcissa a short note and were back in the kitchen, drinking tea and waiting for the water to boil so they could have noodles for dinner.
"You think you're so bold, Malfoy. You think you're so in control. But I can see the fear in your eyes."
“As a matter of fact,” Harry said, “why don’t we start the rumour mill going right now? We have a couple days to wait until we can go to Hogsmeade. Might as well give folks something to talk about before. That way, renting a room won’t seem sudden.”
half this tent and all the crap in it?" Malfoy asked mildly. He was steering again, but they'd come to an easy truce on this after hearing the wraith insult them both behind their backs; taking turns every day and even spending half the previous night driving. Harry had declined to go to bed and had covered a lot of ground while Malfoy had slept, and then when Malfoy awoke he'd taken over and Harry had taken a long nap. Despite the potential of this new schedule, however, the sheer mind-numbing boredom and length of this trip were making Harry feel desperate. They needed a solution.
"A few days?" he pushed again, dropping his volume and squaring his shoulders. "I'm a healthy eighteen-year-old man. I have a voracious sexual appetite. I want them both."

Seamus turns around and Draco clasps him tightly around the hip, pressing his annoyingly clothed erection into the cleft of his Guard’s lovely arse. With his other hand, Draco reaches down and caresses Seamus’s erection, and then searches underneath to stroke the soft, hairy skin of his balls. “You may wank now,” he says quietly, into Seamus’ ear, and Seamus comes on the floor in seventeen strokes.
"You used Gillyweed!" Malfoy yelled back. "We all saw you grow gills and webbed hands! That gave you Mermish!" Malfoy shook his head, clearly amazed at Harry's stupidity. He took a deep breath and put his hands palm-down on his knees. "Obviously you didn't know that. I hadn't realized." Now he sounded conciliatory. He needed to stop doing that, or Harry's head was going to explode.

Jerking hard at his own erection, Draco reflected on how much more realistic Potter’s cock and balls were in his mind, now that he had enjoyed them in reality. Which was lucky, since he had no intention of ever enjoying them in reality again. “Clearly,” he thought, his smugness enhancing every twist and jerk of his hand, “I no longer need the real thing.”
"Mr Malfoy, Auror Potter," McGonagall began in her most clipped, no-nonsense tone. "Thank you both for arriving promptly. As you now both know, we have a situation here at the school that we have come to understand is being caused by the wraith of the late Professor Snape. I hope the wraith itself will be able to find and contribute to this meeting, but it seems to have little self-control. This, of course, is a large part of where our concern arises."
Draco felt his mouth water. He nodded at Harry and stripped off his robes. Underneath he wore the most old-fashioned type of wizarding undergarments. He felt momentarily shy about them, but then he looked into Harry's eyes and saw the frank, raw appreciation there. That was a look no one, especially not an open book like Harry, could possibly fake.
Draco grabbed the King’s cock again to find this stuff did not dry, did not drip, and did not bother his mouth when it got on his lips. Father’s “two most trustworthy guards” had never thought of anything half so clever. Nor had either of their dicks been nearly as handsome.
Harry came a third time while he rode Draco hard. Harry’s old friend of a wedge pillow was back under Draco’s arse; adding energy and thrust to their every bounce.
By the time Draco woke up, Harry had showered, dressed, and nearly finished an essay McGonagall had given him in lieu of a detention. He couldn’t leave Malfoy alone in his bedroom, but he’d been quite unable to wake someone so exhausted.

The next day, when he incessantly pondered how and why he could just automatically know to rub his own cock against Malfoy's erection, he would not quite be able to admit an answer to the question. Except he could, of course. Instinct. What could it be other than a deeply rooted, unexplored, long denied instinct? Because holy fucking Merlin, that felt
Malfoy sucked the end of Harry's dick hard, his now quite wet hand moving fast over Harry's cock. He let go with his mouth, making up for it by jerking off the whole thing with his hand. "Do you want me to?"
She sighed once and walked to her window. Looking out over the frosted landscape seemed to calm her, and she continued. "As a currently matriculated student, Mr Malfoy understands that since we have returned after the New Year, what had been a challenging situation, has become untenable. The wraith of Snape became… agitated. The wraith itself cannot explain the change, but the reasons why are of course not as important as the existence of this wraith at all."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
He rested his face against the cool window. The newspaper fell to the floor but he ignored it. He was pretending to be asleep, right?
“I kept loneliness at bay with brewing. When I could wait no longer, I’d schedule a portkey for some city with great nightlife. Usually Dakar.”
might have to,” Draco said, frowning. “I distinctly recall spending hours up on my roof last time, freezing my arse off.”
"Heh," Harry said, smiling. "I love the way you talk about them. And hell, I don't know. What if I want both of them? I don't have any good ideas about how to fuck two slaves at once." He frowned.
"The first night I tried to allow you to sleep here, I am sure you recall that I got ill and you left as I vomited repeatedly into my toilet while yelling at you to 'please just leave' in between bouts of getting sick. That was no virus, Harry. That was my father's ghost, coming back to haunt me."
"That's so fucking hot," Malfoy whispered, into Harry's neck, both their faces burning with desire, embarrassment and need.
“I think our new Defense teacher could use your assistance with the practical parts of the curriculum. Would you be willing to lead a club again, to practice some of the spells?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Bloody hell, Malfoy. You haven't come yet. You were going to wank and come… I want to watch you come… Fuck me?"
Now that Draco no longer had to worry about keeping his hand lubricated, he concentrated on what he could do with his mouth that would get praise.
Draco advanced on him, beautiful, predatory and lithe. So Harry took him into his arms and smiled, goofy, into Draco’s face.
“If there’s anything I hate more than Rita Skeeter,” Harry told the table, no longer even able to look Draco in the nose, “it’s feeling like some cute bloke’s trophy. Can’t imagine you’d ever make me feel like that.”
Draco was still in the doorway minutes later when Harry looked up: green eyes unfocused, hair a wild black mess, body crackling with magic, cock discernibly erect. Draco was mesmerized. He wanted that man in his bed. He wanted that man in his
“So, you know, no starry eyes.” Harry blushed. “None of that ‘cooing over the war hero’ bullshit. No asking stupid questions about the war. No tearful ‘Thank you’s.’ I can’t stand that from random strangers, and if a guy I was seeing tried that, I think I’d throw myself into the Black Lake!”
“Whatever you want,” Draco attempted, trying to sound confident. But the way he melted inside when Harry caressed his cheek made him wonder if he’d ever had a chance at denying this man.
Malfoy distractedly accepted the small candy from the Headmaster. He looked stunned and didn't actually put the candy into his mouth.
"Why were you angry?" Harry finally asked as the fifth stone was banished from existence with a terse flick of the healer's wand.
First, Harry looked surprised. Then he looked, honestly, pretty thrilled. Then he was immediately confused. He took a step toward them, then stopped, and that’s when his face began to show anger.
“It’s fabulous,” Harry effused, waving his hands even more than he usually did when excited. Draco bit back a fond smile.
“It’s a stroke of luck Bippy knew to call me,” Healer Reath said earnestly. “Does she read The Prophet?”
“No,” Parvati was yelling, “I’m sure Kalyan is more Harry’s physical type. You saw that tall, dark-haired Aamin guy. Pure sex!”
Harry was inches from coming so hard he thought his dick was likely to explode with it, and he didn't think he cared if it did. It would be worth it.
The rest of the trip was boring and uneventful. They scrupulously avoided alcohol that night, and went to sleep alone in separate, tiny bunk beds in an efficiently designed sleeper car. They changed trains and rode on, arriving in London in the evening, just as planned.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Eventually, Draco sauntered out of the tent fully dressed, but stretching so prettily as to bring the word “preening” to mind. “You let me sleep a long time,” he said, approaching Harry.
Hermione reached over and grabbed Draco’s hand, just long enough to squeeze it. “I’m glad,” Hermione said. Then she waved her hands wildly, getting Ron and Harry’s attention so they could find the two of them once again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“So,” Harry said, putting down his half-drunk beer and watching Draco chew his sandwich. “We talked about why you and your mum visit with Andromeda and Teddy, we talked about how I’m gay, and I saw how incredibly uncomfortable that made you. What else should we talk about?”
He looked down at the papers, shuffled through them quickly, then grinned. “This looks great, Malfoy! I knew you were the right man for the job. He tapped the edge of Draco’s desk, then turned. “Told Bergum to hire you, knew you wouldn’t let us down,” he muttered to himself as he walked away.
“Of course, Auror Potter, Sir,” Draco said, hoping the blush he could feel burning his chest would not creep up his neck and onto his face. "I have it right here." It was hard not to blush and stammer when Potter spoke to him. He reached into the correct file inside his desk drawer and withdrew the thick sheaf of parchment he had prepared for the teaching meeting Auror Potter was about to lead.
Harry startled. He’d forgotten something important. He shot off a Patronus to DMLE: “Draco’s spells worked.”
"I'd like you to go get him, right now, and bring him here. Do you agree that he should see that memory?"
“Nonetheless,’ Harry said, looking very pleased. “You must allow me to make this up to you! Are you free… er,” he checked his watch. “Now?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco felt his ears go hot, but he fell into step beside Harry and started walking back the way they had come.
Malfoy started to remove his pyjama top, and Harry unbuttoned his own shirt as slowly as he could force himself to go. Malfoy had far fewer buttons and was done sooner. He put his hands up high, on the back of his neck, and, despite the blush that crept into his cheeks, began to swing his hips slightly back and forth in time to the music from the wireless.
“So,” Draco said, feeling warm and relaxed. “Now we know how I would like to do this, what about you?”
Draco tried not to get sentimental about sharing Harry’s kitchen, but they worked well together. Soon they were seated at Harry’s little kitchen nook.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Curious about this rimming thing, Harry lay down on Hole and let Mouth spread his arse cheeks apart. "I've never done this before," she confessed. "Could you, er…." She didn't seem to want to finish her thought, but - as usual - Harry was enjoying the humiliation aspect of this, so he wanted her to say it. He was pretty sure what she wanted, after all, and saying
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It was apparently Draco’s turn to panic. “What?” he said, and backed away from the table without intending to. “No, I couldn’t ask you to do that. The muffins were a gift!” He waved his hands about before he noticed what he was doing and shoved them in his pockets.
“At present,” Draco said, “I would like to know the time, how long I slept, and how I make this up to you. And then, yes, I think I would like dinner.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Teddy and I are healthy,” Andromeda said. “But I have a notice from the Ministry. I owe two years back taxes, because they neglected to collect during the War!” She breathed deep, trying not to break down.
He forced a smile while she stared, either stunned or furious. He thought to kiss her cheek, but at the last moment decided to ask permission.
Once he made his way into the intended hole, he began his slide. It was only five or six inches of his anatomy, but she was more than moist, and it felt like his entire body was immersed in the silkiest, warmest honey. He managed to hold off his orgasm until he was fully inside her, then he came harder than he'd ever come in his life.
Harry's technique appeared to be slightly different than Draco's. He preferred long, even strokes, where Draco really concentrated on the head and the foreskin. Harry seemed perfectly happy to ignore his balls and arsehole, where Draco put a lot of effort into touching himself in those places.
"His was more recent, but it's still woefully out of date, having been accomplished when he was merely fourteen. If you wished me to check them thoroughly, I would take a bit of blood, bile, urine and feces from each of them for testing, do a breast exam and a pelvic exam on her, do a testicular exam on him, er…."
Sighing, Draco got in the small, loud lift, relieved to see it was empty. He pushed the button for the 4th floor and, leaning against the wall, closed his eyes as the lift doors rattled slowly closed. He was so tired. It would be good to heat up some macaroni and cheese from a box and go to bed. Maybe he would splurge tonight; add in a can of tuna fish, or some frozen peas. It was Friday, he realized. He should add both. His ensuing smile was wry.
"No! No, of course not, Draco. Nothing you don't want. I didn't say sadism and masochism, or domination for that matter. Not even discomfort! Just… restraints. I think that if you tied me up, or were restrained yourself - we should discuss it and see which makes more sense for you - it might help. Just this first time."
“Enough,” she said. How was she simultaneously annoyed and forgiving? “You want my help? My sympathy? Then I need honesty. Someone has filled you with Slytherin nonsense. Who thought they could manipulate me through you? Narcissa?”
Harry missed Draco’s attentiveness, his touch in the hallways, the flattery of his attraction and the snarky little jokes he told in bed. Harry missed having someone next to him at night and having someone who felt “his.”
Malfoy cringed. "He's… he's the one who's finally going to get rid of that bastard…" Malfoy turned to Harry with a look that mingled distrust, despair, and hope. "Right? We're all counting on you. Are you going to let us down? Do you know what he's forcing me to do?"
Then the elder's voice caught his attention and he managed to look back at her. He was grateful to feel that his face was cooling slightly. Whatever that… weirdness of a moment ago was, obviously he was being offered immediate entry to the Auror program. Or -- he looked at the guards again -- possibly something secret and even more exciting.
“Little things like that, I think, make for a successful relationship,” Mother said, sounding both wistful and unsure.
“You countenance me when I’m snappish. When I’m silent. When I am drowning in work, and conversely, when I’ve none and am positive bankruptcy is imminent. I suspect if there were… an epidemic, and I had to brew cures for weeks on end, you’d even accept that.”
Draco looked up and was astonished to see that Harry’s cheeks had pinked up, along with the tops of his ears. Why would
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Since I don’t know what that is, I’m reasonably sure I don’t,” Draco answered as he put down the spoons. He very much hoped he didn’t sound snide.
Shifting to face Harry directly, Draco cracked open one eye. He offered Harry a private smile. He did not yet know his mother was watching.
“Very well,” Harry said, deciding to test him. “You can stay. Strip. Lay on my bed. Stroke yourself hard, then I’ll climb on and take a ride.”
“Why does everyone insist that I’ve fucked half of London?” Potter wailed, looking at the ceiling. “Draco,” he paused and took a large, visible breath. Then he looked Draco right in the eyes, no tease or snark anywhere on his face. “I was a virgin until last night. In the bath. With you.”
Harry watched Draco’s belief that Harry had neither the temerity nor the intelligence to lie, war with Draco’s self-perception as free of unpleasant quirks like sleep-talking.
"--and just think how much manpower that would take away from the effort to fix everything! And we also desperately need people to be getting married and making babies as well, now don't we?"
“Which means the stop-bleed potion is ready to send off to St Mungos for testing,” Draco said, picking his fork back up with a bite of the tuna steak Vissy had served him and Mother for lunch. “Their standards are, of course, extremely high, but I feel confident this potion will meet, or even exceed them.”
. "Do you know a spell for dividing things exactly in half?" he asked Malfoy stiffly as he picked his way back to his chair.
"A year or two?" Harry said, uncertain. "Twice that? Long enough for us, I'm sure. But nowhere near long enough for the village."
“She clearly finds your needs ‘weird’ as well,” Harry said, less fervent now. “But she’s trying hard to be mature about them anyway.”
“And since it’s Sunday everyone will be hanging around eating for a long while. Nowhere better to be and the food is nicer than usual….” Potter said, and Draco heard his stomach growl once. “And I’m sure we looked pretty flustered….”
“I simply had the good fortune to meet someone I was willing to risk everything for,” Andromeda said, smiling as she wiped away one tear.
First they had to steer the tent back into the Black Lake. Then they had to head for the far end, closer to the Forbidden Forest but as far from Hogsmeade as the Black Lake got. There the terrain of the land turned more mountainous, and the Lake turned into more of a Loch, inching between two enormous hills that helped barricade the Forest and Hogwarts and made them as geographically isolated as they were. They slept one night at the bottom of this trench, then a second, though they were moving as fast as the tent would go. Finally, on the third day, they hit the North Sea. It was then that Harry began to understand what a huge undertaking this was.
“I’m glad,” Draco said, deliberately infusing his words with warmth. “Because I want to try a relationship with you as well. Very much.”
Harry hadn’t been certain what he wanted until Draco had challenged him, but now, facing the possibility their liaison was abruptly done, he knew. He wanted more. Quite a lot more.
“Harry,” he tried. Harry looked up from the papers and brochures for all the little seaside escapes and delights.

"I thought it would still be under my mattress, or up on one of my highest shelves and I wouldn't know anything about it. But I have held that thing, I've touched it, I've… my father put that thing in my bed and it corrupted me. My whole life I have taken my father's love for granted. Even after seeing that memory I took his love for granted.
“Would you like to hold him?” Draco’s aunt asked, and, slowly, uncertainly, Draco approached the child. Little Teddy looked up at Draco, smiling wetly around a bright blue dummy. Draco felt his heart melt, soften, and open. He pulled the child up into his arms and felt his heartrate slow.
ring, as a gift. I asked that she accept it as a token of her friendship with me, and a sign that she thereby renounced that little
“It is closest,” Harry said, clearly as a concession. “But I was thinking somewhere they speak English?”
It was a pity he'd gotten quite used to going out drinking with the boys after work, because only a few months ago an entire bottle of wine would have put him well into black-out territory, but this morning he remembered every damn minute of the -- call it sex, it was basically sex -- he'd had with Malfoy the night before.
“I spent Boxing Day considering the past few years. I needed another perspective. I started with Grandfather Abraxas’s portrait, but he suggested I check his opinions and suggestions against those of your sister, as she has a unique position among Blacks and Slytherins in this post war world.”
Draco stopped panicking. What a bizarre fantasy that had been! Harry hadn’t so much as touched him. Normally, when Draco fantasized about Harry, there was a great deal more sex and a great deal less awkward miscommunication. Still, Draco mused, stepping in to look more closely at his spotless kitchen table, it had obviously been a fantasy. No matter how real or how awkward it had felt, surely there was no way that Harry freaking Potter had shown up at Draco’s door with muffins, tea and coffee, lunacy and insecurities. Right?
He’ll play it coy. He’ll decide how he feels while they enjoy each other’s bodies and have few distractions. Maybe when this job is over he’ll feel like taking Draco out for dinner. Maybe Draco will want that, too. But for now, Harry only knows for sure that the sex is glorious.
Trying not to visibly shake himself free from his numbness, Draco managed, finally, to turn and reach into the cabinet and take out two small plates. “Which muffin did you want?” he asked before he turned back. He was too close to revealing his honest feelings to speak while facing Harry. Not even to ask about the muffins.
McGonagall flicked her wand at a curtained portrait in the far corner of the room. Behind it was a portrait of Snape so handsome that Harry could have asked to take issue with the painter. The man's nose wasn't enormous, it was Roman and regal. His hair wasn't greasy, it was shiny. His eyes held wisdom, not venom.
Hair still dripping, Draco entered his bedroom and watched Mother turn slowly toward him, catch his eye, give one nod.
After his verdict came down Rosscot attempted to plead his case directly to Narcissa himself as he was led away in chains, but Harry deftly threw a wall of smoke up between them. All Rosscot could manage in response was a confused wail.
"I still don't see anyone behind us," Draco said as Harry steered around a school of fish. "Good," Harry said, slowing the craft. "Because that engine noise sounds terrible."
Harry's nipples were brown and seemed to be sensitive to touch. Touching them made Harry flinch almost imperceptibly and choke back the sounds Draco had asked him to suppress for now.
“Monday, as you know, I visited with my sister for tea. We spoke of her late husband. Her late Ted was… everything your father was not.” Mother looked at her lap, then out the window.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“As you wish,” Draco said, tone as unruffled as his hair. He allowed, however, a predatory tone into his voice.
“Sorry,” Harry said, although he wasn’t all that sorry. He frankly thought it was kind of shitty of his friends to talk about him behind his back, and that gossips deserved to feel bad, at least for a few moments. Even if it was Neville.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
He’d just been eliminating potential magic-boosting ingredients, and now this? It was a lot to take in.
Harry followed his wand. The breach had been accessed at precisely widdershins, and only one room had been damaged. He was surprised to pass Draco’s bedroom, but his magic knew.
"I don't think you can know," he tried to sound calm, but he didn't think Harry was fooled, "how much this means to me."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
. With him. With Harry Potter. On a date. Probably. Even though that was clearly madness. He wasn’t even hungry!
By some miracle, Harry didn't come immediately, even though no one else had ever had their mouth on his cock before.
Harry's collarbone was less prominent than Draco's, as Harry was more muscular and also shorter. But the contrast between the skin over the bone and the skin over the muscle was still apparent. Draco traced it repeatedly; eyes open, now closed, until he could tell the difference no matter how light his touch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry showed him. "This is where we started, see? That was Tuesday. Now it's Friday and this is where we are."
Draco hummed his agreement. Harry already was. Weasley had been the fastest, rushing through his blowjob with his eyes closed and his mouth shut as though he felt guilty. Bergum had been fast, too, sighing gustily as though no one else ever sucked his cock. Singh had got slower as he came to feel more comfortable with the arrangement, but he was still twice as fast as Harry. Harry usually slowly fucked Draco’s face for as long as eight or ten minutes before he couldn’t stand the buildup any longer. Then he would sigh his frustration and start to bang away at Draco’s mouth, leaving Draco covered with his own drool and as hard as a block of musclewood inside his robes.
They each sat, situated themselves, stirred their drinks and tried a bite of muffin. Draco couldn’t help notice that Harry picked up a blueberry half first, as well.

Draco forced out a cool response. “It was not as though it were urgent,” he teased back in an airy, buoyant tone.
Then Harry Potter reached his hand up, away from Draco’s mouth and around to the back of Draco’s head.
Malfoy gave Harry a sneer that could crack stone. "How quaint. You really think I'm going to fall for that trick? Go to hell, Potty."
He felt Teddy reach for Harry. He recalled the shabby brown room in which they stood, set aside for family to be comfortable. So this baby could relax in his own home: not constantly scolded about taking care with expensive things.
"Harry, there is something we need to discuss. I know your worries about Draco Malfoy. I know you've been trying to find out what he is up to and I know you have been trying to warn your friends, and me, that he's dangerous."
Draco waited, but Potter stayed quiet. He wondered how Potter might have intended to finish the sentence, but didn’t ask. Instead he pulled his creamer and sugar bowl from the cupboard. Happily his spells had held. The cream was chilled and smelled perfect. He turned to take two teaspoons from his silverware drawer.
“I do not believe so,” Narcissa said. She shrugged. “I’d no expectation that the relationship would last. When I told Draco he was much too young to marry, I meant it. You and Ted were an exception, darling. Hardly anyone can well choose their whole future at such an age.”

Harry and Draco had plenty to do, so it was an easy request to grant. Draco was busy tweaking his new stop-bleed potion (the one for which he’d sought a ceramic cauldron) and Harry had enough jobs backed up to keep him occupied for nearly a fortnight.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Aurors collected their evidence, cleansing Narcissa’s bed thoroughly as a pleasant side effect. Harry suspected she would still prefer to burn these sheets.
“I understand,” Harry smiled as disarmingly as he knew how. “Aunt Andromeda is busy with her orphaned grandson, or she’d have come herself.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Aamin was as dull and sweet as Harry had assumed from Hermione’s descriptions. But he was nonetheless tall, dark, and handsome. He met Harry at the Hogwarts gates with students streaming past, seemingly everyone noticing him. His Pakistani accent was sexy and his neatly trimmed black beard made him look every bit of 20 years old. Better, though he had dressed conservatively, anyone could see he had a great body.
“Sit, Draco, Harry,” Andromeda said. She had Teddy seated already. “I’ll serve. Draco, won’t you tell us all about your exciting day?”
“While they’re busy,” Hermione said, leaning in just a little, “I have to ask. Are you happy with Harry? I mean, I know Harry is happy. I’ve never seen him so happy.”
"That's funny," Malfoy said, sounding uncertain. "You have a good sense of humour." Then he smiled a large smile and said it again. "No, death wouldn't much improve Snape's personality, would it?" he laughed.
But, to his surprise, she actually wanted to speak of Dizon, not his daughters. Landers had been a perfect gentleman, Mother said, looking into her glass of white wine. But she thought, if she encouraged him at all, he would be interested in far more.
Nonetheless, they weren’t all that far from one another. Draco had made a small sofa. Accidentally, obviously. Of course.
"Mouth's mouth first," Harry decided, going with the obvious, and quickly slid his cock deep into Hole's constantly magically prepared hole. "Kreacher has such good ideas," Harry sighed into Hole's neck, remembering where that idea had come from. He was already thrusting shallowly into Hole's body, but Mouth was determined, apparently, to earn her rewards too, and her hands were on his skin almost immediately.
“But you’re also… amazing,” Draco finished. “If you were trying to get me to fall for you, Harry. Well. You’ve succeeded.”
“Objection, your honors! Attempt to lead and distort! As a sophisticated woman, as opposed to some wide-eyed innocent, Mrs Malfoy should be particularly capable of riding out these proceedings—”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Draco,” Harry said, and now he looked so sad. He reached across the table and took Draco’s frozen, curled up hand into his own. Draco stared at the hand holding his. “Did you think I wanted to hide you? Hide this?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, face still in Harry’s neck. “I just… new magic. I’ve never seen it before. It didn’t exist before and now it’s here….”
for Granger, then?” Draco asked, clearly struggling with a new word. He was copying Harry, but by putting slices of turkey on mustard-covered sourdough, instead.
Sighing, Harry sent his slaves to their pallets in the basement, and once they were shackled into place, he called both of his house elves into the parlour.
“Merlin’s sake, Malfoy,” Potter said, smiling widely now. “How many times do I have to ask you to just call me just plain Potter? Or even Harry? I'd like that, you know? We were at Hogwarts together, man.”
“How could you not want real sex?” he finally tried, not feeling quite… on target. This conversation was miles away from anywhere he had ever thought they would be.

Potter and Draco come simultaneously, but Potter’s release spills down Draco’s white thighs, while Draco’s is discreetly contained in the pocket of robes he’s been covertly fucking as a byproduct of Potter’s pleasured movement.
"She's a sex slave, Afelgate. She's not a normal patient. She doesn't have privacy rights anymore. I want to know that my fuck toys measure up to what my friends would find in fine whorehouses and such. Eventually she's going to have a new cock in her fanny every time she turns around." Harry tried to give Afelgate a significant look. It didn't seem to work, so he tipped his face down, and looked at Afelgate over the tops of his glasses. Afelgate turned bright pink and swallowed.
But Harry seemed to figure that out, so he started caressing Draco’s inner thigh, and soon Draco wasn’t bored at all. “Can we Apparate out of a taxi?” he whispered into Harry’s ear, but Harry said no, laughing kindly, and then it wasn’t all that long before they were in front of Harry’s invisible house.
“Draco,” Harry was looking at his own damn feet again. “I’m not interested in that kind of sex. Penetrative sex. I’ve looked into it and it doesn’t really… appeal to me.”
Deciding he wanted a longer cock first, Harry came inside Hole at least six times that night. That morning he carefully measured his cock. Then he made Mouth measure it. Then he had the elves do it. When everyone agreed that he'd gone from just over five inches long to seven, Harry awarded Hole fifteen gems, allowed Dudders to heal the slave's arsehole, and then sent him to bed, where - exhausted from his ordeal - Hole did not awaken for well over four hours.
“I still feel like a boy sometimes,” Harry said in a confessional tone. He’d snuggled down further into the covers and it was strange to see him look so sweet and young.
“Face me again.” Weasley turns, looking – as always – respectfully just below Draco’s eyes. “It is just as I wished,” Draco says in satisfaction. “All the men are attired as such?” Weasley nods. “The enemy shall run in terror when they see you,” Draco says, and he smiles. “As everyone knows, the larger the penis, the stronger the magic. And clearly, my men have the very largest cocks.”
"I love this," he whispered when they broke apart for a moment. It hurt Harry's neck to make the kissing work in this position, but it was so clearly worth it that Harry didn't care. "I really fucking love sex," he smiled. "I love kissing you, too. Merlin, this is seriously brill, this sex stuff. I can hardly believe I've waited all this time to try it."
“Oh right, magic,” Harry said, and his ears turned – as if that was possible – an even brighter red. He took out his wand to help, though, and soon the wet mess was gone.
Malfoy lifted his head now to look at Harry. "You… really? I've known I was gay for…. Let's just say a few years now. Haven't you been dating lots of girls?"
, who was chattering on about something at work; the paperwork? or the class he had been asked to lead? Draco was smiling and nodding and hmming his responses while most of his brain struggled with this sudden, monumental problem. Namely, did he invite Harry in, and if so, did that mean he was agreeing to sex? And if they
“Still, our relationship hasn’t just been between us two. We also have history to contend with. And society. And my mother, though she’s gotten a lot better about my being gay. Thank you for helping with that.”
Harry wanted to tell Neville it hadn’t been a deception, but – nervous – he decided that could wait until after their first kiss. “Good cider?” Harry asked instead, and Neville nodded, but he looked shy. Harry stepped next to him and put his hand on Neville’s arm. “I had a really good time today, Neville,” Harry tried, and he looked up into Neville’s eyes. Neville looked a little nervous, but he was smiling.
Deep into his thoughts, Draco startled at the sound of a firm rap on his front door. “O’Sullivan,” he thought with a sinking gut. Then he jumped up from his chair. It couldn’t be… Harry? The very idea was ridiculous, but he smoothed his hair and shirt nonetheless.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Yes,” Draco said briefly. His eyes were all over Harry’s skin. “To get a head start on babymaking. My parents only had one. I’m to fix that. Been told a thousand times. I’m to knock up my blonde witch every couple years until she can’t pump any more out.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“It’s unusual for you get worked up like this,” Harry said, his manner more measured than Draco was accustomed to.
Instead of telling Potter the truth, which would take too long and just make him sad, Draco looked into Potter’s eyes and thought about the situation he’d managed to find himself in. Harry Potter wanted to waltz in to Sunday breakfast at Hogwarts with him. Presumably
“It was by then, yes. Nonetheless, though the time of greatest danger had passed for the day, Potter insisted I sleep at his home, as it is in the midst of an enormous square of heavily warded property.”
. He was almost ludicrously attractive. He kissed like a dream. He was smart, and funny. He liked a lot of the same things Harry liked.
"Yes, we have all night, and we're both sixteen years old. How many erections can you get in a night?"
. I tried to make amends. I apologized to several people. I might have a stain on my soul! But,” Draco inhaled deeply. “But I am working on that. So. What do you think of all this?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Scrivener pulled parchment from his briefcase. "It's all outlined here, Mr Potter, but the three most likely options in your circumstance are desire and pleasure control. I can change the tattoo to allow you to bring your slaves to orgasm, prevent their orgasm, or cause them to desire you. Other options less useful to you would be obedience, because of course you are free to Imperius slaves; and causing discomfort, but with a slave one has so many simpler options. It is also possible under some circumstances to add two or even three elements to the tattoo, but that's not always possible."
“It’s frightening, I agree,” Harry said, deep into his professional mien, “but we have methods to prevent further entry and keep both you and your treasured mother safe at the Manor.”
Draco looks up, past Potter’s softening erection. They are alone in the room. The Wizengamot has allowed Potter privacy, and they did not watch as Potter enjoyed Draco’s virgin arse.
Draco had eaten dinner with Millicent Bulstrode and her new boyfriend last week. He wrote a few sentences about how Millicent had managed to secure a decent job in the broom industry, and there had met the South African born Bhek. He was a little older than they, but he clearly thought the world of Millicent, and he was a solid, honest fellow with a good job in a stable industry. He was even almost handsome.
They managed to work though a good section of the relevant boxes and almost to lunch before Harry started to flirt. Soon Harry had Draco pressed against the door again.
“It’s just for the tomato, I swear,” Harry said, and pulled everything he needed as far from Draco as he could get it without leaving the kitchen.

Harry tried to wipe the gloating off his face with a deep breath. He’d probably done a lousy job, though, so he decided to hide his face in the pantry cupboard until everyone else sat down. When Malfoy said something crappy about lunch, or the little square plates, Harry could chuck him out into the street. Hell, Andromeda would help him do it!
Severus had first appeared pleased, even honored when Draco (so uncharacteristically nervous in his mentor's home), went to him, asking for an unprecedented kind of personal advice.
Harry released the dildo and Scrivener obligingly pressed the base up toward Malfoy's body so it wouldn't slide onto the floor. Harry framed the art with both hands and took a good look at it.
“That had to have been extremely difficult for you,” she said. “But your presence was immeasurably valuable to this case.” She took Narcissa’s hands into her own, and Draco watched, surprised, as his mother allowed it. Took visible comfort in it.
Draco began to ask Harry what he’d said. Harry’s lie morphed from “I couldn’t make out words,” towards “I think it might’ve been about me.”
Unluckily she knew almost nothing about the doorway she had used to get between her house, and that of her paternal grandparents.
The next figure turned out to be Pansy Parkinson, and Harry stumbled out of his chair. Getting an encouraging nod from the elder, he stepped next to Pansy, watching her fight the silencing charm that kept her from giving all of them her opinion. Goyle had been nearly naked, which Harry had done his best to ignore, but it was a good look for Parkinson. Harry circled her, his erection forming quickly and the blush again threatening to self-combust, but he did his best to ignore that as he appreciated the view of a young woman stripped to a loincloth and chains purely for his own amusement.
Although incredibly tall as well, Greynrushes and his coterie looked almost nothing like the merpeople of the Black Lake. Harry was shocked at how familiar one of the mermaids looked. He stared at her, unabashed, finally realizing she could have been the model for the mermaid whose painting hung in the prefect's bathroom back home.
Then he opened his mouth and let Malfoy in. His hands went to Malfoy's arse and they squirmed and moved until they were cock to cock and kissing in earnest.
"I am genuinely sorry," Malfoy said, sounding completely sincere, "to have to be the one to inform you of his passing."
what I was taught. That you are both weak, inadequate, not to be encouraged. Not with social invitations, or employment, or any of the little comforts of society.
“If you planned to ask me to be your boyfriend, the answer is yes. If you wanted to ask me to be patient with your mother, the answer is yes. If you were going to ask me to understand the challenges presented by your past, or the demands of your potions business, or the tightrope you walk in public, the answer is yes. And if you were merely going to ask if I’d top next time…”
"Okay," Malfoy said with a weary smile. He looked like he could fall asleep right there on the floor. Harry climbed into the top bunk of the tiny sleeper car and -- drunk and post-orgasmic -- fell asleep in seconds.
Harry watched the way Malfoy's face went shocked, indignant, revolted. He decided he'd been given the truth and stroked down both of Malfoy's sides as best he could. Like Parkinson, Malfoy's hands were chained tightly behind his back and Harry couldn't easily touch everything. He watched as Malfoy's tension eased, very slightly, but he could still see it. When the small relaxation was complete, he pinched both of Malfoy's nipples at once, just enough to make Malfoy tense again. He smiled at the tiny jump, watching. Malfoy grimaced. He'd seen Harry's smile. How very lovely.
“Of course,” Draco responded, surprised. He pulled his wet face from Harry’s chest. “She’s pretty blatant about it.”
But he wasn’t able to say it, for some reason. He apparently wasn’t able to say… anything right now.
“All those boys should compete for Harry’s attention,” Lavender murmured to Parvati in the common room.
"Harry, you have no idea how badly I want you out of your robes. But… slow? Go slow for me? Surely you can value this gift of privacy as much as I can? You live in a dormitory too, after all…."
"It wasn't what I expected from him, either. But he told me things about my father, Harry… I don't think I can repeat everything he said. It disturbs me too deeply to think about it. I can't speak the words. But he told me that my father was… my father was himself… Lucius was…."
“I fancy you,” Harry repeated, to Draco’s astonishment. “I’m confident I can craft the best Living Wards nonetheless. But you should know.” Taking a deep breath, Harry visibly calmed himself.

There was an angry murmur from McGonagall and then the wraith began screeching again, but Harry motioned to Malfoy and they both snuck down the stairs silently. Harry motioned again, and together they began to walk toward the great hall. Lunch had ended recently enough that they were able to scare up a house elf who happily brought them a few heaping platters of leftovers, and they ate together in an excruciating silence for a few minutes.
"Yeah," Harry said quietly, looking at the controls again. "I think it should be safe to go at three quarters speed, but swimming, not driving on the seabed. Is that what you meant?"
“Which means,” Potter continued, a satisfied and sly look on his face, “that there is no point in hiding this.”

his reputation, but that’s why he’d been willing to fuck that particular boy. If any other boy had offered, Draco would have spat in his face.
“I think this relationship,” Draco continued, forging past old habits of uncertainty and the longstanding assumption that he wasn’t wanted, “has tremendous potential for success. And so, I was wondering, if…”

The next time Draco fell asleep in Harry’s bed, Harry had a plan fully formed. He was nervous, but also pretty confident. By now, he knew Draco’s arrogance well, and he was willing to use it against Draco to get what he wanted.
"Yeah?" Harry demanded, pushing himself up by the arms of his captain's chair, "Well, that attitude of mine worked out pretty well for you in the Room of Requirement that day, didn't it!" He was breathing hard and his heart was pounding. He was furiously angry over Malfoy's cheek, but, he was vaguely aware, he also felt fantastic.
Harry broke in. "I'm going to kill him, Malfoy. I'm the Chosen One." Malfoy cringed slightly. "He chose me himself, when he…" Harry lifted his fringe. Malfoy stared at the famous scar. He looked like he was alone on a sheer, precipitous edge.
done first. The first time I have you in my bed, Potter, I’d like to be behind the best wards on earth, and have hours for my exploration.”
Draco looked up from his cauldron. Harry had come at a good time. Either that or he had waited until Draco stopped stirring. Draco thought Harry might do that frequently, except he never remembered to ask.
“Worst of all, I wonder, if Riddle had not had Lucius behind him: Lucius’ wealth, social capital, political power… would Riddle have accomplished what he did? Gone as far? Killed nearly so many? It causes me profound discomfort, but I nonetheless must wonder: How much of this was my fault? Obviously Riddle and Lucius were responsible for their own actions. But I, just as much, am responsible for my own. And my lacks. Everything I could have done, but did not do.”
Harry needed a cheap, easy fix to his Draco problem. One that wouldn’t involve giving up the fucking. He was really not interested in giving up all the lovely fucking.

Draco had run into Queenie and Daphne on his way out of the Ministry the week before, and they’d exchanged some polite small talk, so Draco wrote down a bit about that, and about how well both girls had been turned out in the latest fashions.
“You are correct, grandson. This is not the generation for Malfoy conquest. Far from it. Instead, sadly, you must be the Malfoy who gives Britain a reason to forget your father.”
“Well,” Draco began, still a bit surprised by the question, “I guess I’d like to see you, mostly here at yours, a few nights a week. I’d like to sleep over. I’d like to take you out for meals, maybe bring you into London for a play, or the ballet.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco was surprised to realize he’d closed his eyes. He looked up from his shoes, nervous at what he might see on Weasley’s freckled face.
Not bothering to apply his own cockring charm, Harry spun Draco around while sinking to his knees. Harry’s erection bobbed, wet and a little cold, ignored in favor of Draco’s perfect, surging cock.
“I certainly try,” Draco said, wondering where Mother was going but glad she was finally trying to put his relationship in a positive light.
Draco orgasmed spectacularly all over their clothes and was vaguely aware that Potter seemed to have had an orgasm as well.
“Very well, thank you,” Draco answered. He sounded… sincere. Harry was surprised, and turned around. Draco was lounging, nude, hard and smug. “I need to come,” he said. “Is your arse available?”
. This service is, indeed, primarily intended as sexual service, as befits a hero and liberator of Mr Potter's grand status.
Harry blushed bright red at this, but he agreed. "Sounds good," he said, wondering if Draco was going to suggest something lascivious and half hoping he would.
her with bullshit!" He laughed again, and this time Malfoy joined in, and they laughed together for a few moments. Until Malfoy said "now, now, this is what got us into trouble last night!" Malfoy's laughter sounded forced and uncomfortable, and Harry couldn't help but correct him.
“For both of us,” Harry continued gently, briefly putting his hand on Draco’s cheek. It was all Draco could do not to shake him off in shame and embarrassment.
It was only when Voldemort moved into his home that Draco was grateful to be an only child, if this was how his parents treated their
"Yeah," Harry said, sensing he might have put a foot right for once. He looked at Malfoy again. "That crap is awful, Malfoy. This stuff I bought is really bad, too, now that I think about it. Couldn't a train this fancy have decent a English lager?"
“And lucky me, it’s my turn this week.” Potter pulled his cock through his opened placket. He was already thick and hard, but not yet dripping. He stepped closer and slid the head of his dick into Draco’s open mouth. “Of course,” Potter said, sighing happily, “as I’m the one who insisted Bergum hire you, it’s my turn
It took little time for the two of them to remove the rest of Harry's clothes, then Harry allowed Draco to lead him over to the bed.
"I don't think Snape's wraith would have disappeared if I hadn't truly meant it," Harry said, feeling confident. "Yeah, I think it sounds brill, Draco." he paused, and then reached over to brush Draco's fringe out of his eyes. "Besides, think of the… fringe benefits." He grinned widely, and Draco looked at him for a short, stunned moment, before he laughed abruptly, once.
Harry awakened first. Relieved, he crept silently from bed toward his home’s nerve center. He opened the spells and cameras and began to carefully examine all his perimeters. He was as thorough as he knew to be, but – surprised – he found nothing amiss. Both his Muggle and magical methods all reported in clean and clear. For HillSide.
Trying (and utterly failing) to feel triumphant, Harry ushered Malfoy into his messy room. “Have a seat,” he suggested. Malfoy obeyed quickly, choosing the edge of the bed, instead of the chair or windowsill.
“Really?” Harry asked, unable to help himself. He wanted back in Malfoy’s bed, of course, but some of these guys sounded pretty brill.
"No, Harry, I don't." Draco pushed himself to speak. He closed his eyes and shoved at the words. Harry thought he was brave.
"You said you've never been fucked in the arse?" It was fun to say. This power over Malfoy was getting intoxicating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco kneels gracefully at Potter’s feet, pushes the other man’s outer robes aside, and then – with Potter’s forming erection still under cloth – he leans forward and breathes heavy, hot air directly at Potter’s cock.
"Snape's such an arse." Finding himself wanting to compliment Malfoy, Harry wandered into an assumption. "Bet he doesn't know French or anything posh like that. You know, like you."
Harry was so relaxed from the massage that he couldn't seem to push himself back onto Draco's cock, but it still felt fantastic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco came hard over his own chest, passing out and then falling deeply asleep. Luckily he’d thought ahead and set his wand to wake him before Charms, so he wasn’t even late to class.
“Look,” Draco interjected. “Do you want to fuck, or not? Because I have books to read and letters to write.”
“I need to contribute more to this relationship than my body and my conversational skills,” Draco said. “I’m not a paid dinner companion.”

Malfoy didn't disappoint. "You stupid fucking… hero!" He turned the wheel abruptly to the right and allowed the machine to idle. It settled slowly into a small depression at the bottom of the lake, silt rising visibly through the water outside the windows and screens in front of them.
Malfoy's hair was pretty long, actually. Harry had completely ignored it the night before, in favour of

Robards smiled, but it was sad. "Yes, Harry," he agreed slowly. "But what about the Rellujier case?"
"You'll need preparation, but I don't. All I need is lube. There are spells for that, but I like to use a potion I buy instead." Malfoy squirmed away and fetched the potion from his bedside table. Then, silently, he put lube on Harry's cock. Harry tried not to cry out loud with pleasure. It wasn't easy. Soon Harry was lubed and Malfoy carelessly put a bit of the remainder on himself. Then he grabbed Harry's cock and pulled Harry into place over his own body.

“I suspect you think I’m blasé about you. About this. Bet you think I get all the arse I want, I’m so experienced; and you can’t stack up next to all the, I dunno, models and Quidditch stars and famous musicians I fuck on a weekly basis.
“I suppose,” Draco flirted. He felt uncharacteristically relaxed tonight: loose, free and high. “Or I could get down on my knees right here in your kitchen and suck your heavy cock until you come down my throat hard, like a steam train rolling down a hill.”
“Lucius thought me almost… dim. He forgot about that little contest, because I never once reminded him. When he was unable to accomplish something, whether via magic or social maneuvering, I would usually complete it behind his back and tell him I had set all three house-elves on it, or claim my parents had said a few words, or dropped a few coins.
They headed into the Great Hall together, Draco’s hand warm in the small of Harry’s back, and Draco settled Harry at the Gryffindor bench with a proprietary, possessive kiss on the mouth.
"What!" Harry shot out of his seat and almost leapt across the Headmaster's desk before he stopped himself. "No! Sir! You, no! You can't be!"
Thinking about nothing but those straining rose nipples, Harry leaned closer. He caught a glimpse of the elder and stood up fast. She winked at him and he backed away one step. He might be ready to do all manner of things to Pansy, but not in front of a Wizengamot elder! He closed his eyes and breathed in once, then out. Seeing the older woman's amusement again, he flushed. "Maybe," he offered, and the elder's smile could have lit up the room.
"Of course you do, Draco. What you really mean, I would wager, is that you don't know how to immediately shift into the most spine-tingling shag I've ever had. Isn't that right?"
“Draco,” Grandfather said, fond. There was appraisal in his eyes, but the approval was clear in his voice.
Draco tipped his head and looked at Harry for a long, indecipherable moment. Harry stayed silent and waited. He might not know Draco well, but he was nonetheless becoming accustomed to his eccentricities. He might bottom, but he still preferred to make the decisions whenever possible.
Draco stared at him, horrified. “That was a good apology,” he said. If Weasley wasn’t willing to accept his apology, he was stuck.
“Not hungry?” Harry said, clearing the table with his wand and appearing as though he were trying not to frown.
“Or she didn’t want to allow me the satisfaction of yelling, before you had a chance to soften me up,” Draco grumbled.
“Whispering-gallery waves,” Draco reminded. “We are positioned at the opposite focal point of the parabola.”
Harry caught Teddy’s ball, then stood up and smiled at Andromeda, wanting her to stand, too. “Let’s play catch!”
Harry couldn’t say no. Not honestly. At best, Malfoy would look like a renegade Renaissance Faire staffer, or like someone who’d misplaced the scific convention. He’d attract a ton of Muggle attention and neither of them would handle that well. “Got anything Muggle on underneath? Trousers, a jumper?”
“Recently,” he began, aware that he could put Mother off no longer, “I was wandering the house, trying to determine the solution to a vexing potions difficulty, you know how that soothes my mind.”
“Of course you did, love,” Draco said. He reached over to squeeze Harry about the waist. “Shall we… can I… How does this work?”
, I will have you know, to make sure she knows I’m fine with whatever she decides. England, South Africa, back and forth, whatever she wants. The manor wards will welcome her.”
It served him right, he decided after Malfoy actually fell asleep while Harry was ignoring him. He laid the paper down in his lap and looked out the window, seeing nothing. What sort of Gryffindor -- or auror for that matter -- would behave so dishonestly? Harry closed his eyes, folded his hands over the paper in his lap, and contemplated the nightmare he'd created.
"Because abandoning the Dark Lord was nothing compared to dating a man. I am the last Malfoy. Allowing the line to end is the most unforgivable thing I could possibly do. Even toying with a man is dangerous, because it opens the possibility that I could be… homosexual, and therefore unable to father children, unwilling to marry a witch. What if the scandal broke? What wealthy pureblood witch would have me? Whenever you touched me, Harry, I was filled with memories and an indoctrinated loathing that went so deep most of it had no words, only visceral response." Draco clenched his fists in anger - whether at himself or Lucius he did not wish to ascertain - then he forced himself to relax his hands.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry wasn’t sure about Narcissa. She’d saved his life by lying to Voldemort. That was… big. Otherwise, the only wrongs Harry could remember from her were tricking Kreacher, looking like a stuck-up bitch, and being married to
“I’m going to miss the sex, too,” Draco said, looking down at their feet. “But we both have to get over this. Being at school together is making everything worse, not better.”
“Er, thanks,” Draco said, blushing past his lickable neck. He wrote something down on his script for their porny presentation. Harry read over his shoulder.
“First of all, you are incredibly intelligent. You just ‘get’ potions. The theory, the practice, all of it. Nothing withheld, and better than anyone else I’ve ever met. That’s including Snape, and he was a fucking potions genius, even if he was an arse and a bad teacher for anyone he didn’t like.
He cracked open another beer and took a swig, then grabbed the open bag of Doritos and sighed. “Well?”
"All right, Harry, I do want to come… are you sure? It… well, this will hurt a little before it feels good. But it will feel good, I promise."
“That was fantastic,” Harry purred. “I’ll sleep great. Please wake me in four, or if the spells indicate anything unusual.”
Harry entered the room, saw Draco holding Teddy, and Draco watched — fascinated, horrified and amazed — as a cascade of emotions played over Harry’s handsome face.
Overcome with broken thoughts and tangled emotions, Draco had struggled out of his chair, then stood in the middle of the room and tried to think of something intelligent to say. Finally, he walked over to the window where Severus stood silently. He put a hand on Severus' shoulder and said, very quietly, "Thank you, Sir."
Of course, Harry hadn’t been an ideal boyfriend, either. He’d begun this mess by hideously, repeatedly, violating Draco’s privacy. He’d spun that elaborate sleep-talk lie. He’d written Draco’s Mum when he should’ve had a hard talk with Draco about uncomfortable things.
Neville barked out one nervous laugh. “Look,” Neville tried again. “I’m sorry if you didn’t realize people were still going to talk about you, and I’m sorry because I obviously shouldn’t be talking about you.” He looked down at the floor and swallowed, then looked at Harry again. “But here’s the thing. I’m a virgin, and you aren’t, and it’s embarrassing for me, and I hoped you could help me figure out what to do.”
So Harry found himself not quite a week later - on the first evening of the Hogwarts winter vacation - wrapped in his invisibility cloak and Flooing from Dumbledore's office to Malfoy's bedroom in Malfoy Manor. The Slytherin had taken the train, and should be home and already hidden away in his room, hopefully having given some ironclad reason for his mother to leave him alone all night long.

"Mr Snape!" Harry heard bitten out in McGonagall's shocked brogue, but the other voice just steamrolled over her again.
“Of course you are. Could anyone be comfortable with this?” Yes, that was the tone of voice Draco had been aiming to hear. Potter sounded a bit hopeful now, along with the tinge of disgust and despair.

McGonagall frowned as though she wanted to remind Draco that Lily Evans Potter was long dead, but she said only "Yes?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Maybe we could," Harry said, feeling glad that Draco had suggested it, and made it about both of them. "We've been a good team through this whole mess. I think so, anyway. Er, do you?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

"How does this work?" Harry said to the healer. The healer, however, was staring wide-eyed at Harry's sex slaves, who wore little more than the pretty golden chains and tiny loincloth style outfits Harry had originally brought them home in.
"Really, Draco, didn't it ever occur to you to think it odd that a man like your father was willing to take orders from anyone other than his own father? Lucius Malfoy hid his heart so deeply within himself that he became a slave to his cock."
“This way, please?” Her accent was heavy, but her English seemed good. She led him to a conference room with a large picture window. Harry stared out the window. Winterthur was charming.
Really though, he’d been preparing for Harry for the last several hours. He’d bathed assiduously, shaved away every tiny stub of pubic hair, moisturized liberally and perfumed sparingly. He had carefully pumiced off the beginning of a callus on one foot, obsessively removed split ends from his lengthening hair, and trimmed his nearly invisible blond beard down until it was a fine, masculine sandpaper on his cheeks and neck.
He looked at the now-cold drinks in their paper sleeves and the abandoned blueberry muffins — still hidden in their folded white paper box. He sat at his kitchen table and absolutely refused to let himself cry.
“None of that,” Harry said. “We cast excellent silencing charms. I’ve never done this before, Sport. You have to react so I know what’s working for you.”
Scrivener removed a remarkably thin, short wand from his bag and touched it to Malfoy's lower back. Distractedly, Harry attempted to remember that was supposed to be slowly fucking his slave with the dildo instead of concentrating all his attention on the artwork.
“Interesting,” Harry said, amused and becoming more and more randy with every kiss. He secured his hands under Draco’s muscular arse and stood, Draco in his arms, legs now wrapped around Harry’s waist.
Malfoy was annoyingly silent after that first groan, but his arse gave no resistance to the dildo anymore.
“Though, I suppose, if you wanted to fuck a lot of Muggles and Ginny wasn’t cool with that, maybe that would be an okay reason to break up with her? I don’t think I really understand how all of this works.”
“Merlin fuck,” Draco howled. “I love this! I told you! Fuck me!” He straightened both legs and jerked at his erection until Harry pulled his hand off and replaced it with his own mouth. “Ahhhh!” Draco cried, and fucked into Harry’s hot mouth with small jerks of his hips while Harry fucked him with his dildo, his strokes long, smooth, and very, very deep. Harry's erection was a bar of heat against Draco's thigh.

Putting that mad thought to the side, Draco processed mounds of arrest-related paperwork, communicated with prickly goblins, and even managed to get appropriate rooms reserved for the training classes Bergum needed him to move now that four Aurors suddenly and unexpectedly had the rest of the week off. He even ordered the lunch for Wednesday and Thursday’s planning meetings, which was only notable because Bergum was suddenly tired of Ministry cafeteria food and wanted him to order from a Mexican restaurant which turned out to have fairly spotty Floo access.
"Your father was the biggest ponce who ever lived. For years he kissed your beautiful mother good night on the cheek and then left the Manor to take it up the arse in shame and in secret like a good little whore. Mostly from Voldemort himself, actually, until your would-be lover relieved the monster of his body that long-ago Halloween night. I don't know where Lucius found men while you were a little boy, but I do know that he propositioned me repeatedly after Voldemort regained his body and we returned to active service as Death Eaters. The Voldemort that returned was, apparently, a completely non-sexual being. I suppose that comes from being so far away from human."
Harry stroked the shaft of his cock now and considered his obsession. Had it only ever been about Malfoy's evil plan? Or could it have some connection to that immediate, sexual reaction he'd had tonight in the anteroom outside Dumbledore's office? Dumbledore. Malfoy's evil secret plan was to …. No. he refused to think about that. It had not happened and it would not happen. Harry would not allow it.
Draco straightened up, a look of pleasure in his eyes and soft triumph on his face. "Drinks from the break room, Harry. Do keep up." He stalked away, leaving Harry to wonder what Draco might have in his hands when he returned.
“Let’s eat,” Neville responded modestly. “I’m starved.” They headed down to the Great Hall together.
Watching Harry return chocolate biscuits to the kitchen, Draco re-applied a silent spell that calmed his erection, and despaired at Harry’s sudden disinterest.
at Mouth. "Seduce the Healer," he said, and slightly blank-eyed for a moment, Mouth rose. Her face began to take on a sultry cast.
"Well, that explains all these kidney stones," the healer said grimly. "Young woman, this is going to hurt like hell." He waved his wand again, one finger still deep in Mouth's body, moving strangely.
It wasn’t O’Sullivan. Instead, for some unknowable reason, Harry Potter was standing in Draco’s doorway. A little bakery box dangled from his wrist by a string. He held a steaming cardboard Costa Coffee cup in each hand. “I know I’m unannounced,” Potter said, looking… sheepish? “But I brought nibbles?”
Draco did see Harry a few times on Tuesday, but only from across the room — Harry never spoke to him. This was a little unusual, but the truly odd thing was the way Harry blushed and looked away both times Draco accidentally caught his eye.
It was a long, potion-heavy regimen, but as Draco performed it for his owner’s pleasure every day the Auror left him home alone, he’d learned to do the entire list without cerebration.
“Not at all,” Draco said, looking into his glass. “But I’ve been climbing the walls trying to get her to face reality.” He stared into the middle distance.
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes. “I mean No, Potter. No! ‘No,’ that’s not true, ‘no,’ I don’t believe you, ‘no,’ that’s not possible. Just… no!”
"That makes it clear that it worked," Afelgate said toward Harry. "Normally those spells are done under heavy sedation, but then the patient has to come back for multiple checkups over a three week period to make sure that the spells took, and about fifteen percent of the time, they don't. This way, when I hear the pain, I know it's nearly guaranteed." He frowned. "If your earlier offer has been withdrawn, Mr Potter, I completely understand."
Draco was guiding Harry off into a hallway, but still inside the main bank. Laughing nervously. Saying something about this meeting being a happy accident. Suggesting the world didn’t need to hear them catch up.

“So, I guess the first thing is, I’m so surprised to hear you say you’re a virgin? Because I thought we’d been having sex for over a week now. So I guess you think you’ll be a virgin until someone sticks his dick in your arse? Or, you know, vice versa. But, er, first, I don’t think that way about virginity, like, at all, and second, that won’t be me. You said I’m a top, but I know

Saturday morning, Harry woke hard, nude, and with his lover draped around him. Draco’s erection was pressing between Harry’s still messy, still lubricated arsecheeks. Cuddling backwards into Draco’s careless, sleepy embrace, Harry tried to maneuver Draco’s cock back into his hole.
“You know I am completely comfortable about your preferences, Harry. This isn’t about Draco being male. But last I saw you two together, you seemed to think Draco was your enemy. Do you honestly care about him? I don’t want either of you hurt.”
Could Harry think Draco owed him — his life, his freedom, his job — and thought Draco should feel obligated to pay him back with sexual favours?
“It just feels like walking through any normal doorway,” Harry continued. “I’m deeply impressed with this magic. I see now why it takes days to properly install.” He looked at Draco sideways and gave an awkward half-smile. “Frankly, if we break up, I’m not sure how I’d remove it.”
Harry found himself unable to concentrate on kissing, and he dropped his head to Malfoy's shoulder and pulled Malfoy's hips toward his own. He was hard. Hell, they were both hard, and it was erotic and dirty and nothing like he'd ever thought he would want. But he did. Oh, how he did. He couldn't understand how someone he'd always hated could become someone he desperately wanted. But he could figure that out later. Right now, he wanted, and Malfoy wanted, and they would have it - whatever it was.
Mr Potter agrees to the general nature of his servant's confinement as intended: a punishment for crimes against the wizarding world.

Harry reached toward Draco’s clean-shaven jaw, but caressed only his collar. Then he put that hand on his cocked hip.
"Please Malfoy, please lie down with me? I want to touch you so bad, I'm so hard it hurts." Harry tugged gently at Malfoy's hand and Malfoy stepped forward. The two boys tumbled onto Malfoy's bed and spent a few glorious minutes just kissing and frotting, reveling in their mutual nakedness and lust. Malfoy seemed enthusiastically content, but soon Harry wanted more.
Draco caressed Harry’s hair. Then, taking a risk, he coaxed Harry into his arms. With Harry’s sweaty head on his chest, one of Harry’s legs entwined with his own, Harry’s hand at his ear, he smiled and breathed in Harry’s scent.
Andromeda sighed. “My sister meant that… torrent of opinion as a sign of respect. I’ll have to reflect before I know whether I agree with everything she said, but I know she meant it. She was telling us the truth, as she understands it.”
"Malfoy, you stand behind me, stroke my shoulders, and kiss my neck and ears. Neither of you may talk." He paused and considered this for a moment. He wasn't in the mood for disobedience or a battle of wits. Hell, he usually lost those contests where people insulted one another. He certainly wasn't in the mood to spend the afternoon, or the next ten years, arguing with these two about the relative worth of anybody's mother, bloodline or bank account.
"Harry," Draco said, speaking in a loud, clear voice. He drew even closer to Harry and took Harry's right hand into both of his own. "Will you be my business partner? Complete equals? Solving problems, our own men, no paperwork, wizards for hire?"
“Shall we talk about… wards?” Harry husked into Draco’s ear as he gently set Draco down on the enormous bed.
The Hat paused again, and the Headmistress turned to Harry and Malfoy. "The professor is correct. These are the things we have learned and inferred from the research I have been able to do. I have collected supplies for your quest, and will entertain any reasonable request for supplies not yet already gathered." She tapped the edge of her desk and gestured for them to stand, which they both did quickly, as though in competition. "Any questions?"
He particularly liked to ‘pick Harry up’ as dinner ended on nights when they had their standing fuck date.
By the time Draco finally made his way to Harry's thighs, well over an hour had been spent on gentle exploration, and Draco realized Harry's balls had to be rather blue by now. Draco's certainly were.

“As lovely as this is,” he began, and Harry looked crushed. “No, not that,” he soothed. “I was just going to say that we are both really hungry, and that I’d rather do this for real, and naked, and after we eat. All right?”
Then, after days of relaxation and distraction, Thursday arrived. They dressed carefully and made their way to the courtroom for Rosscot’s trial.
He looked from one to the other. He: the pureblood prince, the childhood rival, the stamping foot, the bloody bathroom.
Nonetheless, it was time. Past time. They’d fooled around multiple times now, and not only had Draco never once let Harry properly come inside his arse, they’d not had anything remotely resembling a talk about what this meant, or defining their “relationship.” (Was this a
“No academic talk?” Harry murmured between nips to Draco’s jaw. “Who are you and what’ve you done with my sexy, pedantic boyfriend?”

“I am, to be frank, uncomfortable. But it arises, now, from tension. I am pulled in multiple directions. Earlier my discomfort arose exclusively from my certainty that Draco was wrong.
“I could watch, Malfoy,” he improvised. “But you’re right. We have Auror-approved methods of achieving orgasm, especially on stakeouts.”
Dumbledore was calm, but his voice held all the authority Harry was accustomed to. "The object your father hid in your cot, Mr. Malfoy. Do you think you might know what it is? Could you bring it to me to destroy? It is a part of the key to Voldemort's power."
“But why are you even here?” Draco said, needing to know even though it was the rudest thing he’d said in years. “I mean,” he wondered how to backtrack, “should I expect you again? I could have been prepared….”
Draco felt the blood start to pound in his ears to go along with the churning in his stomach. They turned a corner and he saw his building, just a few dozen yards away, and he swallowed.
! Now I shall get my revenge for all the time you took with… the… uh....” Harry paused, confusion passing briefly over his face.
"Suck my dick, Hole," Harry said, unable to wait any longer, and Hole obeyed him slowly enough that Harry smacked him one across the ear.
Harry bristled. “Nonsense. My wards are exquisite. Ask any customer for a referral. Get the facts before you impugn my work.” He took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
Malfoy’s mouth lost its pretty pout. It softened, opened a millimetre. “Yes?” he said, when Harry didn’t continue.

“That was thoughtful,” Draco suggested. “I should give you a backrub in thanks before you go sleep.”
"There. Good idea Kreacher. I like it plenty so far. Mouth, Hole, those are for you. The first one to get all your gems into the bottom of the hourglass gets to request a boon. You'll earn gems by pleasing me. I'll also set it up so every time I come in you, you'll earn, say, five gems." He glared at both of them, and Hole was suddenly doing a far better job of stroking Harry's cock. "Nice move, Hole, I see this is working already. The rewards will be damn nice. I assure you. Like, I dunno, a whole day off, or maybe a chance to have tea with your mother." Their eyes lit up immediately, and Hole's hand began to stroke Harry's balls as well. "I'll let you suggest anything you want. That way I'll know what sorts of things will really motivate you."
“Yes, the way you’re attempting to enter it right now gives you away,” Draco said, aiming for a stern tone and failing.
"Almost a sponge of deliciousness that teases, hiding from your tongue, fleeing your teeth, pretending that they don't long to be devoured?"
“After Mum and I were acquitted, Aunt Andromeda invited us over. I was scared to accept, but Mum insisted. She kept talking about blood, family, legacy….”
Draco’s face paled, but he picked up the knife. Then he smacked at the tomato with it, as though he’d seen nothing Harry’d demonstrated.
Draco wanted to make each fuck last, and soon they were covered with sweat. Eventually though, Harry was allowed to come, and Draco came soon after.
They eventually bought a huge patch of land positioned vaguely between Luna’s Dad and the Burrow, fighting constantly with the architect and arriving, finally, in a large house for the women, a two bedroom cottage next door for Harry.
