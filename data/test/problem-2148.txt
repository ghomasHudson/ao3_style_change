‘You don’t yet, and that is fine Harry. The more your experience, the more sense these rules will make, and hopefully in time they won’t seem so much like a hindrance.’
He stroked a hand down his green scales as he sank a shiv under the skin where his markings converged on his back for safekeeping. ‘Yes, come pick berries with me.’ Harry asked politely, because you always had to be polite to snakes – else they might nibble on you.
The creature gasped as it tried to dodge the vines sharpened tips. And Harry watched it closely as it ran. He noticed it twisting its own wrist, sending out flashes of light and colour. Its power was bright and full of energy, it almost tasted
James’ face paled as he recounted.
At the movement he saw to his left, Draco dropped onto his stomach and carefully peered over the crest of the hill he lay on.
It landed straight into the strange, stinking cloth on the beast’s head.
Albus set it back to the original with a smile, one with Harry returned with a grin.
Harry had tried to follow the scent the afternoon before Albus and the other professors had found him. It had led back to the castle and with it, he’s footsteps similar in size and gait as his own.
For the first time in Harry’s life, he was awed.
rhyme were the same melody. In another flash, the awful squeak of chalk on slate as Albus figured out
Then a sudden as a crack of lightning; Harry pushed everything into one command - the will to banish the thing from his home. And with a roiling howl of wind the creature was plucked, torn off of the forest floor and hurled away as it shrieked.
‘Come to watch me stew Albus?’ Severus slurred from an armchair. It was nearly pitch in the room, except for the dwindling light of the hearth.
‘Harry.’ He smiled.
He slowly walked back into the nursery, his wand in hand, the tip always glowing green. Each step felt like a thousand, he feet were leaden and numb.
Draco didn’t sleep that night, his mind frightening him with thought of the boy alone in the woods, lost and alone, and unable to face the forest’s horrors.
That was little consolation when Stickes had seen how small the coffin was.
The Potions Master pinched his bridge as if Draco had annoyed him. How odd.

When the evenings began to cool, Harry found the massive creature cooing over some Unicorns, most of which had been seriously injured. Harry had hissed when he saw the welts, scratches and gouges, knowing it was the hooded creature which had cause them. Their white coats were marred with silvery wounds, some of which were dull slate grey at the edges.
Harry’ mind glanced on a time before his hut, Colther, and the wolves and shuddered slightly with the pain of it. Screams and blood were all he could piece together in the cracks of that pain, and it revolted him – the part of him that remembered
one?”
“Hello? Harry are you here?” A pale hand waved in front of his face as his eyes refocused to the two people in front of him rather than back to the memory of a certain redhead.
. I know I want maroon. I don’t know where that colour would go best, but it’s one that reminds me of a memorable time in my life and so I’d love to have it be an important colour of my home.”
Harry went into this weekend looking for a job and instead, found a strange form of a relationship.
Harry took a few minutes to settle in while his mind refused to do the same. All the questions he had pushed away the second he met Draco bubbled up within the first minute he had to himself in forty-eight hours. How would he explain his life, his true history to Draco? The Wizarding world wasn’t kind to Muggles or really anyone
Sadly, the appreciation of Draco’s hair only lasted a few seconds before he woke up and smirked at the swift removal of Harry’s hand from his head, practically alarmed at the sudden movement of Draco.
Harry was excited about his new project. He’d never designed a space before - everything had always been decided for him, and with this new project he had a proper place to focus his energy on.
“Been awake the whole time you know. The Edward Cullen staring is very effective.”
Draco wrapped the towel around his waist and stood in front of the mirror, wondering how time passed so quickly with Harry that he couldn’t even process all the anxiety that had built up inside him. Just then, Harry started knocking.
, clearly.” Draco’s sharp tone didn’t seem to faze Harry in the slightest.
“Harry, I can tell that this situation makes you nervous. The best thing I would recommend you do at this time is to take this relationship and your feelings about it one day at a time. If you feel that things are clicking right now, great. But don’t let that steer you away from what’s truly important right now. Which is focusing on yourself, and your goals. Let’s put this aside for the time being, until you have a little more clarity. Now, where did we leave off last week?”
Of all the many trips he did have in the past month, this was Harry’s all time favourite.
“I keep going over the pros and cons and I think I like the gold lamp stand more? I’ve already thought of a few places I could keep it.”
“Pansy! What was that?” Draco loudly whispered.
Harry grins, grabbing the back of his shirt and tugging it over his head. He opened his arms, muscles flexing under skin, inviting Draco in.
Harry wasn’t going to admit that she was
Harry woke up with a start and mechanically reached for the worn-out journal under his pillow, leaving Voldemort to go back to his reality and plot his plans for the poor unsuspecting boys (especially Draco).
Each word was accentuated with a nip to Draco's ear. Draco shuddered as Harry's breath ghosted over his ear and he nodded minutely.
“Well, I was in the midst of finding new job opportunities since I’ve been in a proper rut these past couple of months and we decided that I would try to find something I liked doing and see if there were any job opportunities relating to it.”
A smile touched his lips as he remembered the events the night had presented them with. Harry couldn’t remember the last time someone left such an impression in his mind; getting rid of the memory would do more harm than good.
Harry took the last few steps up to the four-poster bed, keeping his breath soft and quiet, but Draco still stirred in his sleep. He groaned, sitting up a little and propping himself up with his elbow.
He admired Draco's features up close- soft pink lips that were currently pursed at him- Draco didn't like being pulled. He admired the high cheekbones and sharp jawline in front of him, fingers tracing the regal figure who simply rolled his eyes...
The absence of a reply dropped Draco’s heart to the ground and his anxiety seemed to be knocking with a new rhythm. Harry'd had a change of heart, he didn't want to be around Draco anymore - maybe he had gotten tired of being around him. Soon, Draco began spiralling, every type of worst case scenario filling his head as he paced around his bedroom, not only unable to decide what he was going to wear but do for the day as if subconsciously, he let his day rely on what Harry wanted to do. It had only been two days, for goodness’ sake!
"Potter? Is that you?"
no less, Draco frowned. “Harry, I don’t remember there being any ice cream. I’m positive I finished it last week over dinner with a friend of mine.” Just as Draco made that observation, the faint light from the bathroom window showed that Harry had stopped all movement.
Harry snuggled under the covers with Draco, arms wrapping around his small waist. Draco suppressed a soft smile, turning to look at Harry.
Only on a third round of his chaotically organised room did he notice the tiny white piece of paper that laid flat under a paper weight. Draco grabbed the note and read it as fast he could. As he reached the end, a heavy sigh of relief released from his chest. Every word made him feel better and before he knew it, Draco had read it five times. The note was placed in the empty space of his wallet, a newfound attachment was created for a piece of paper that Draco wouldn’t give away for the world. In an effort to keep his spirits high, Draco went to his wardrobe and picked out his most comfortable set of clothes: blue jeans, a black turtleneck, a belt and his best pair of clunky boots. An afternoon alone is exactly what he needed, or so Draco tried to convince himself.
“No, you’re all good. It was nice seeing you after a while. Next time you’re around, bring about your beau too, why don’t you?”
He eyes Draco's dick, a smile tugging at his features.
Voldemort knew Draco had some imperative connection to the Boy-Who-Lived and he would do anything to find some weakness of Harry's; with the boy on the loose and his Trace gone, it was crucial that he find information, time was running out. One of the reasons Voldemort was torturing Draco was because, he already knew how Harry felt about him, he just needed to know if Draco felt the same, this way he could have a common weakness between the two.
After a year of continuous dreams from Harry's perspective, Voldemort had gotten used to it. Not what the dreams were
“Draco! You alright there?” Julianna exclaimed as Draco furiously rubbed his head.
“Um… He-hi Nicolas, Di-didn’t know
Ahhh we're almost at the end!
"Do you want this?"
“Yeah and some are horrible.” Pansy quietly but audibly, added in. Draco jabbed her in the stomach.
“I’m sorry to hear that.” Harry paused. He wanted to know more but understood how Draco felt. He did have another question, or really a proposition. One that might have an answer he didn’t like, but he sure hoped Draco would comply with.
Draco could only smile. “Harry you look ridiculous, what are you even
Harry twined his fingers in soft blonde hair, eyes fluttering closed as he melted into Draco's kiss. His fingers traced Draco's sharp jaw, thumbing at his chin and gently tugging him away.
. Even if they weren’t going to have sex, Harry still stayed. This was all too new to handle and in some ways, it felt too quick.
The group walked back towards the lights section as Pansy continued conversing with Harry, leaving Draco to intently listen.
Draco scoffed out a breathy laugh, throwing his head back (Harry was definitely
Harry placed a finger over Draco's kiss-swollen lips, smiling in an unhurried, genuine sort of way. It made Draco's insides feel tingly, though he was much more focused on getting what he wanted...right now.
“And? What is it? Spit it out.”
“I understand you may be busy but, would you like to take a quick nap with me?”
Harry laughed, “A red-haired daughter if you truly wanted to know. And quit it! I’m supposed to be making you feel better, not the other way around!”
Lace curtains did very little to block the sunlight streaming onto the bed, making Harry squint. Dark blue sheets splayed out and over the edges of the four-poster, a clear indication of some - or perhaps a lot of -
Draco cut himself short as he entered the living room where the dining table was. A newspaper flower stood proud in a glass Harry had found in one of Draco’s cabinets. Two plates were arranged opposite each other, complete with two pairs of forks and knives, resting on the left side of the plate, just how Draco liked. The two of them sat and began filling their plates.
. Everyone in relationships has big doubts, little doubts, mild doubts, but what makes them
“Well, I needed to get some new cups since I broke mine last week and the last time I came here, a boy seduced me and we went to my house so there hadn’t been time to buy more,” Draco replied casually. Harry could feel some underlying irritation at him in that statement and since passive-aggressive responses weren’t his favourite responses in the world, Harry chose to follow his intuition. Pulling Draco’s arm, taking him to the side where his friend was out of earshot and for good measure, quietly put a silencing spell over their conversation.
“It’s a special talent, I think.” Pansy replied, snark flowing through her voice, “Anyways, I’m leaving now and will probably reach Paul’s fifteen minutes or so? Don’t be late.”
“I just, really like him Pansy. I really like this guy.” Draco softly squeaked, the thought of Harry excited him too much.
Harry smirked as he evaluated his progress. Plenty of love bites, red marks from kisses, perfect.
Harry gently tortured Draco with his tongue, pulling off his cock and licking it like candy. A thin sheen of sweat covered the both of them- they didn't care though- they adored this time the two of them had together.
“All at once is perfect, thank you.”
"Sorry, Harry. Now, what are you doing here disrupting a good night's sleep?" Draco's eyes narrowed and he turned his head to glare at his boyfriend.
“That’s good news! Did the exercises help?”
“What fun, can’t wait.” Draco replied to her reminder of his debt.
Within a few hours, Pansy had been able to convince Harry to make three important decisions: pillow type, carpet colour and the most important, growing his assorted plant collection. To cheer Draco up, Harry picked up an emerald green single sofa-chair which worked so well, Harry was convinced he could have even cheered Draco up with a cheaper item but love didn’t come cheap, unfortunately.
'OKAY FINE I WILL TELL YOU, JUST PLEASE STOP!' Draco yelled out before he collapsed on the auburn, wooden floor. Lord Voldemort slowly walked over to the fireplace while Narcissa tried to help her boy over to the ebony futon. His pale skin and hair contrasted with the futon although; his dark three-piece suit blended into it to the point where you could
Draco hissed, and then he was suddenly pinned to the wall. Harry's dark eyes were boring into Draco's. "Do you want this?" A smile graced the dark-skinned boy's face. "Do you want...Me?"
“A home planner? I don’t know if that makes sense but I’m pretty okay with helping people design their homes but my own feels so difficult, I need all the help I can get. Organising homes for functionality and purpose is something I seem to do well, at least according to my friends when I helped them with their new house a few months ago.” Harry liked how Pansy asked him questions, it made him feel like she wanted to get to know him outside of his relationship with her best friend.
“That you are,” Harry chuckled as he returned Draco’s kiss with even more assurance than he had given Draco this morning.
“He has been the only person who has ever let me feel like I was given the key to his home. Not just I feel like I am Pans, we weren’t intimate with each other and yet I still felt like I knew him better than anyone else in his life. Like we’ve known each other for years. Taking a pause, Draco continued, “So, yeah. I think I am ready. If not now, then when? If not him, then whom?”
To apply for a job at Ikea, Harry would have to go there first and since he didn’t have any plans for the day, he decided to get on with finding furniture for his apartment too. It was going to be an extremely long day.
Harry and Draco sat silently next to each other eating the delicious food before them. But Draco was not able to appreciate the taste. He hadn’t eaten in two days his hunger was almost painful but right know he was terrified. Almost as terrified as he used to be when he was around the dark lord back in the times where he used to be a death eater. After they had finished eating Harry stood up an looked at Draco. “You look pathetic. Take that off and take a shower and don’t you dare put these disgusting and filthy clothes back on. You can sleep on the sofa. Tomorrow I will get you appropriate clothes. I will get a document ready for you I want you to sign it after you showered. I am going to bed know. I will see you tomorrow then.” Draco just nodded. When Harry turned around to walk over to the bedroom Draco dropped his panties and took of the bra. He went to bathroom to take a long warm shower. Was this really happening to him? When he came back out of the room Harry was nowhere to be seen. Wrapped in a towel Draco sat down on the sofa. He noticed a paper lying on the table where moments ago tasty dishes had been. Draco did not read what the contract said it didn’t matter. Like always he had no choice. He took the feather that was next to the paper on the table and signed the contract with his blood. After he had signed the contract pure pain shot true his arm. He took a look at his dark mark. Right under it a scar had formed: HP and a little lightning. Once again he body was marked.
Harrys tear-filled eyes found Draco’s. It was like looking into a strange mirror as bright green stared in to piercing grey. The dark haired wizard looked at the blonde one putting all his sadness and pain into the intense gaze like he wanted to apologize and the blonde haired wizard looked back at the dark haired one returning the intense gaze like he wanted to apologize as well reflecting the same sadness, the same pain. It seemed like hours or even days passed while the two rivals stared at each other. Harry was not sure who broke the gaze and when but now they were sitting next to each other backs leaning to the cold stone wall of the dungeon below Grimold place. With shaking hands Harry opened the iron shackle at Draco’s ankle. For a moment it seemed like he was going to say something and break the silence before he stood up shaking and walked away slowly. He made his way to the kitchen not turning around one where he started to make tea like it was the most normal thing to do right now. He didn’t turn around when he heard footsteps behind him – he didn’t care. Harry didn’t care if Draco walked upstairs to leave and tell everyone what he just did or if Draco walked upstairs to murder Harry from behind or… Shaking arms wrapped around him from behind. Harry could feel the delicate body press himself against his back – he could feel the low unsteady breath tease his neck – he could feel the drying tears pressed to his skin. The dark haired man turned around the tea pot filled with tea still in his hands. He almost let it fall to the ground in surprise as he looked at the pale naked man in front of him. When Harry reached next to Draco to put down the tea he noticed the blonde flinching in expectation of pain and it broke his heart. Harry put down the tea and pressed the body so close to him to the wall. He saw the fear and the hurt in those grey eyes preparing for the pain the come when Harry almost tenderly cupped Draco’s chin in his hand while he pulled him close, pressing the fragile body against his own trapped with the back at the wall. Tender lips found cracked ones as Harry Potter kissed Draco Malfoy.
Harry smiles at him. “An idiot you all love,” he says.
Malfoy writes that’s still stupid. Then they go over a couple of more words. Harry teaches Malfoy the signs for understand, don’t understand and goodbye. Malfoy makes notes of the movements and they practice all the signs one more time before they pack away the parchment and go down to dinner. Malfoy goes to sit at the Slytherin table, while Harry joins his friends at the Gryffindor table. He watches how Malfoy eats his meal in solitude. None of the other Slytherins pay him any attention.
Ron nods his head and lets it be. Dinner has just appeared in front of him and he’s busy pushing as many potatoes as possible in his mouth.
“I love you too,” Hermione answers.
“Draco, dear,” his mother says. Draco looks up and spots his mother. She doesn’t smile. She doesn’t seem proud. Does she know the truth? Has she figured out that Draco doesn’t want this? That he wanted none of this. He’d made a choice, only to lose that option hours later. And now he’s here, having to choose between dead or a life in the service of a man he hates. Dead sounds better, if it was only his own death. The Dark Lord has a temper. If Draco defies him now, his mother and father will also die. And Draco knows it won’t be painless. The Dark Lord likes to torture his victims if he gets the chance. Draco has no choice. He raises his arm and lays it in the Dark Lord’s waiting hand. He will do this to save his mother. Harry will understand. He would have done the same if it had been his mother’s life on the line.
Because of all that had been going on, the task and the aftermath, I had forgotten Draco’s birthday this year. Draco says it’s okay, that he doesn’t care. That he already got the best present in the world. He means that I made it out of that graveyard alive. I still feel bad about it, and I already told Sirius I want to get Draco the newest broom when it comes for sale in a couple of weeks. Sirius said that would be a perfect gift.
“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW, WEASEL!” Draco shouts in the other room. Harry and Pansy both jump up. Harry doesn’t waste any time to get back to Draco. The sight in front of him frightens him. Draco has his wand out, pointed at Ron. His arm shakes, and his face is red. Ron has his hands up and says he’s sorry. Blaise got his wand pointed at Draco, just like Hermione, both ready to act if Draco loses it completely. Harry moves into Draco's sight with care. He needs him to calm down before anyone gets hurt.
The last trial we saw was for four people. When they were brought in Draco told me the woman was his aunt, his mother’s sister. And that one of the men was her husband. They were sentenced for torturing Frank Longbottom and his wife. Draco and I looked at each other and mentioned Neville at the same time. He was raised by his grandmother because of what Draco’s aunt did to his parents. Draco feels bad about this, I know. He says it’s fine, but he started to be kinder to Neville ever since we saw the memory of his aunt’s trail.
Harry waves his hand, and some tape magically appears over George’s mouth. Rose and Victoire giggle as George looks at Harry, horrified.
“So, what is it that you did?” Draco asks. “Do we need to smuggle you over the border to keep you safe?”
Pansy looks up from cutting her fruit. “You want me to come with you?” she asks.
That evening during dinner Draco and I got into a fight. Blaise was coming up with all kinds of ways to get passed the age restrictions for the TriWizard tournament and I’m not even sure anymore what happened but it ended with me and Draco shouting at each other. I think I said something nasty about Draco’s parents and he got really upset saying he didn’t want to see me anymore. I yelled back that he didn’t need to and turned around to leave. Blaise later said that Draco was crying by the time I had turned my back and reached out his arm to grab me, to stop me. But before he could reach me there was a loud bang and someone roaring: ‘Oh no you don’t laddie!’. I turned around to see Professor Moody walking towards us, his wand pointing right at a pure white ferret that was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, right where Draco had been standing. Draco was nowhere to be seen. I took me two seconds to realise what had happened. Professor Moody had turned Draco in a ferret.
“Well, they still look delicious, don’t they?” Andromeda reaches for the plate and holds it in front of Teddy.
Draco nods his head. “And your awful black hair, already untenable since birth,” Draco says.
‘Okay, you’re getting by. But you could do even better,’ Harry writes.
“He’s more understanding than you give him credit for. And I hate lying to him. He thinks you’re hung up on Cedric,” Hermione says.
“It’s kind of hot, watching you do magic without uttering a word,” Harry says.
“Not long. He said he would be back around six with dinner,” Draco says.
“Good to see you again, Malfoy,” Neville says as he stands up and slides down next to Lavender who swoons all over him. Harry will have to thank him later for this sacrifice.
“Can I watch stupid Christmas movies too?” Teddy asks.
It’s then that Professor Lockhart spoke up, saying that it seemed that he wasn’t needed. I had completely forgotten about him. Ron turned towards him and pointed his wand at him, saying Lockhart could go first. He protested, but we had both our wands pointed at him, so he hadn’t a real choice.
“The Boy Who Lived is down,” a familiar voice jokes. “Bested by the mute, who would have thought that.”
“Sure, go ahead,” Harry tells him without looking up from his homework.
“Is she moving?” Harry asks.
Hermione has been reading a lot the last two weeks. She feels stupid that she didn’t bring her copy of Hogwarts, A History, because all the copies of the library had been taken out by other students. She wants to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets. She even asked about it in our History of Magic class last Wednesday. It was a nice distraction during the boring class. Professor Binns just talks in his flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class is in a deep stupor. It was my favourite class at the end of last year because it was the one where Draco would play with my hand all class. And now the only thing I can do is daydream about how amazing that felt and how much I want it back. But he’s sitting with Pansy now. I think they are dating. That’s what everyone has been saying at least.
Harry James Potter.
Harry can’t believe he said all of that. He’s been hiding his feelings from Neville, from everyone. The ground looks very interesting right now. The dirt piles up on the spot he shuffles with his foot. Neville’s feet step up in front of Harry. He places his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“I can’t, Hermione,” he says.
Draco raises his eyebrows and turns to Harry and signs: “He knows I’m deaf, right?”
But this will be all he will plead guilty for.
“I’m sorry,” Draco signs.
The potion is grey and looks like it's off. Draco picks up the bottle with shaking hands. He knows he has to take it, that it’s for the best. But that doesn’t mean it makes it any easier. Once he takes this, it’s all over. There will be no way back.
‘No, you should hang out with him.’ Harry writes.
“And I’m not saying that Draco has feelings for you,” Remus continues. “But if he has, he might be frightened of them. You told me his father is already angry because it came out he’s deaf. I’m sure his father won’t take it lightly if being gay piles up on that.”
The door opens and the Dark Lord steps into the room. His red eyes glitter as he looks at Draco and Narcissa. How much of their conversation has he heard?
Draco was more than just confused. He was sad. He was angry. He was relieved. Somehow seeing all of this made him feel like he wasn’t alone – like someone would understand. But it also made him feel sick. Harry was broken just like him, or maybe more. The blonde haired wizard trembled slightly as the realization hit him. Harrys life has been hell – just like his own. He never had a loving family. By Merlin he kind of didn’t have a family at all. At least Draco had his mother all his life – who had been kind and caring and even his father had sometimes showed him affection when he was behaving the way he was supposed to. But Potter had been alone for 11 years without knowing what love or friendship meant. And still even after he went to Hogwarts he had been forced to go back to this horrible place. Nobody saved the savior.  Everyone was always taking from the dark haired man but never giving. It had to come to this. Harry had been broken over and over again – of course he would crack at some point. Everyone expecting him to be perfect, to be the savior, to be a hero while all Harry needed was to be saved himself, to be loved and cared for. Potter was fighting for life while everyone tried to take even more from him. Harry had tortured Draco in the exact same way that he was being treated all his life. He had made Malfoy feel the same pain. It was the only way he was able to cope with all the trauma he had been through and somehow Malfoy understood. He did the same when he was a child. He treated everyone around him like shit at school in order to feel sane and normal like what happened to himself was not so bad. Tears streamed down his blood stained cheek without Draco realizing it. He just saw his worst memories knowing that Harry saw them too. Somehow he was relieved to finally share the horrors of his life with someone but he was also shocked at the same time. Shocked from the realization of how his life has not been so different from the boy that he had been jealous of for so long. The blonde haired wizard could not stop his body from trembling while more tears streamed down his face, mouth slightly opened but unable to form words. Nothing he could say could help or make this situation bearable.
James lightly shakes his head and smiles. “No, I didn’t,” he says. “She was the woman I wanted to marry. The fact that she didn’t know that yet, didn’t stop me. I wanted her, more than I ever wanted anything in my entire life.”
“I’m sorry,” he says as the sun starts to burn his skin and takes his life away.
Draco was scared of what was going to happen when he goes home. Is still scared I should say. His father is really angry with him and he’s afraid his mother won’t be able to convince his father to let him stay at Hogwarts instead of transferring to Durmstrang. And that is not even starting with that his father had placed the diary in his room, putting his own son in danger like that, or the fact that his father had said that he is no son of him. Draco doesn’t like talking about it and I understand that, but I just hate seeing him sad because his father can’t see how amazing his own son is.
I had been so excited to go here. I don’t know why I thought everything would be better when I would be around other wizards, that I would be able to make some friends. Well, I think I made one friend at least, even though I haven’t seen him since the sorting ceremony. I met him after Uncle Vernon had left me at the train station. I didn’t know how to get onto platform nine and three-quarters and I was afraid to be stranded there. And then I saw some people that looked like they were also going to Hogwarts, with trunks and an owl. They helped me get onto the platform. I had to run at the barrier and I really thought I was going to crash into it. But the crash never came and when I opened my eyes I was at a platform next to a scarlet steam engine. Two of the boys from that family, Fred and George helped me get my trunk on the train. And when the train was on his way, Ron, their younger brother came to sit with me in my compartment. He has a lot of brothers and he’s afraid he won’t do as good as his brothers. I’m sure he will. One of his brothers works with dragons in Romania and his other brother is in Africa. Oh, and he has a rat, named Scabbers. That reminds me, I’ve named my owl Hedwig. I hope you like the name. I think it suits her.
Draco, Hermione and I went to visit Hagrid the Wednesday after that, he was really upset. Draco told him not to worry, that he was fine. Only that wasn’t the problem. The governors of the school had been told and Hagrid was afraid he would lose his job. We told him that we would back him up, tell everyone that needed to hear it the truth, that Crabbe had come up to Buckbeak without bowing, that he had ignored all Hagrid’s instructions. He hugged me and Draco, told us we were good boys. Hagrid was kind of drunk and Hermione told him so. He then went and stuck his head in the water barrel outside. When he came back he suddenly started shouting at us for wandering around after dark, that it was too dangerous. He escorted us back to the castle and promised him that we won’t go out after dark again.
“Thanks,” Harry says. He looks back at the fire and fidgets with his sleeve. “Don’t tell Ron and Neville,” he says.
Draco shakes his head.
I felt like things were going back to normal. Well at least as normal as life can be with being a champion in the TriWizard tournament. But of course, I was wrong. It all started in divination. Professor Trelawney had her perfumed fire burning, even though it was a hot day. I cracked a window open to get some fresh air and set down next to Draco. Professor Trelawney dimmed the lights to show us her impressive solar system in a jar and explain something about the position of Mars. I didn’t catch much of it, as the heat and the nice breeze from the window made me doze off. Before I knew it I was flying on an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky towards an old house set high on a hillside.
Hermione signs. “Ron, stop it. He’s right. We had to agree with this. If I’d told them I didn’t want to do it, they would have found another person to take my place. Nobody forced us.”
“No, I won’t let it be,” Hermione says. “You boys want to get yourself killed, and I won’t stand for it. I don’t want to be stuck alone with the girlish squad for the rest of the year. You can’t do that to me.”
Hermione lifts her shoulders. “It’s just, you normally are worse than those two.” Hermione nods her head towards Neville and Ron who are both at the table with books and parchment around them.
“Even if that means never having children of our own?” Draco asks. He doesn’t want to ask it. He already knows the answer. This will make Harry leave. He will see that he’s better off without Draco, that he doesn’t need Draco to breathe.
Neville shakes his head. He regrets saying it now. Harry doesn’t need to look at him to know this. Neville never wants to talk about what happened. How a dear friend of his parents, one of James’ best friends betrayed them all. Harry is still grateful that Sirius was the secret keeper of his parents’ hiding place. The world could have been so different if they had switched secret keepers. Then Harry would be the orphan. And Neville would still have his parents. Would they have taken Harry in? Raised him as their own? Probably, but still. It’s different, knowing your real parents are dead and gone because of the betrayal of a friend.
Harry doesn’t stop. He knows this. He just needs to get out and away. He needs to be alone in a place that won’t remind him of Draco. So he can cry in peace without having the entire school talk about him again tomorrow.
Harry laughs and nods his head.
I told them I would use the invisibility cloak. Draco just nodded and then turned his eyes away from me and Hermione, probably trying to hide that he was close to tears. Hermione surprised me by saying she would come with me and that she would start going over her notes so we would be prepared for all the protection charms.  We agreed on a time to meet at the trapdoor and then Hermione was off.
No, he shouldn’t think like that. Just because he lost too many loved ones, that doesn’t mean that he’s doomed, that everyone around him will die. He’s not alone. He’s got Draco, the blond git that has stolen Harry’s heart and makes every day better. He’s got Teddy, his godson, that loves him and is growing up so fast. He’s got Ron and Hermione, his best friends. And all the other Weasleys. He’s got friends that are still alive and well, Neville, Luna, Ginny and Blaise, Seamus and Dean, Greg, and even Pansy. Who would have ever thought he would call her his friend one day? Not that Pansy feels the same, it’s clear she hates Harry. The price to pay for stealing the man she loves apparently.

‘That explains why you are so lousy at every subject that is more difficult than Divination,’ Malfoy writes
“He’s doing it again,” Iris says.
“But he got her in the end, remember that,” Remus says.
Draco turns so he can look at Teddy. The boy is in his dragon pyjamas and holds Teddy-bear in his small hand. Draco kneels in front of him, and Teddy falls into his arms. “I love you, Draco. Don’t be sad.”
Draco doesn’t have to be told twice. He takes hold of Harry’s shirt and pulls him into a kiss. Others pass them by, some hooting, others gagging or shouting insults. Harry doesn’t hear any of it. He can only feel Draco’s body close to his, Draco’s tongue in his mouth, their shared breath as they kiss. Harry’s heartbeat goes mental and a massive smile crafts itself on his face. Because Harry just knows. This year is going to be amazing. And no Dark Mark, Dark Lord, or evil parent will be able to stop Harry from experiencing it all with Draco.
Well, it is better than the things Harry has fantasied about all night. All the horrible things he wants to yell at Draco. Draco should be proud of him for not making a scene.
Harry touches Draco’s arm to get him to look at him. “Why are you scared?” Harry asks him.
“She sure is,” Harry agrees.
Draco got back when I was still looking at the picture. He brought some food with him from the great hall, tried to get me to eat something. But I wasn’t hungry. Draco didn’t even pretend to go sleep in his own bed that evening until Nott and Crabbe were asleep. He lay down next to me straight away, hold me close and let me fall asleep in his arms.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. Neville has a point. Harry is hardly ever alone. He’s always been a people person who likes to have others around. But lately, it has been different. Harry is never alone because Draco is always there. In class, after class, during dinner. They spend all their time together. This time it’s Harry who blushes. He can’t help it. He likes being around Draco.
Two days later when I walked towards Myrtle’s bathroom just after dinner, I could hear Filch shout hysterically. For a moment I was afraid another person would have been attacked, but then I heard his words and he was complaining he would be mopping all night. Then his footsteps receded and after I heard a distant door slam I walked into the corridor. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor. It was coming from Myrtle’s bathroom and I could hear Myrtle wail from inside. She was crying louder and harder than ever before. I found her in her usual toilet and asked her what was wrong. She asked if I also came to throw something at her, and I responded confused, why would I throw anything at her? Myrtle is my friend, I would never do anything to hurt her. She answered as followed: ‘Don’t ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me.’ And then I said something wrong because it only made Myrtle shriek even louder. It was just that I wanted to comfort her, by reminding her that it couldn’t hurt her because it just flies right through her.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry James Potter
I didn’t know you could miss someone as much as I miss Draco. Like this being in love is horrible. Please promise me it will get better once I see him again when we go back to school. I do really hope so. I still want him to be my boyfriend, even though I haven’t heard from him all summer. Is that stupid of me? He just makes me feel all fussy and warm inside when I think of him.
Harry rounds a corner, coming up to the other park of tables. The chairs here are still on the floor. And one of them is occupied by Draco. His back is turned to Harry, as he leans over a big book. Harry can’t stop the loving smile that forms on his face. Draco is completely in his element, unaware of the time and his surroundings. Harry has stared at him often enough when they were still friends. Draco never noticed then, or pretended he didn’t. It was the best part of studying with Draco. The time's Harry could just look at him and feel complete.
I didn’t say, but I had kind of hope not to wake up again when I was stuck on that tree. Every day that Hermione is not here, every night without Draco close by, with all the teasing and bullying, with everyone treating me like I’m a horrible person for attacking Colin, Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, I think I would be better off dead. I want to die, momma. I want to die and be with you and dad.
My heart did some somersaults when I saw who had stepped into the shop. My dreams had done his sharp pointed features no justice. His hair was even lighter than I could remember and was styled sleekly to the back. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a person that beautiful and couldn’t help but smile. I wanted to step out of the cabinet to greet him when I saw that he was not alone. A man with the same pale, pointed face and identical grey eyes followed Draco into the shop. I think it was his father. He snapped at Draco to touch nothing and Draco turned away from him. I don’t think Draco’s father would be kind to me if I would show myself so I stayed hidden.
“No, I wasn’t
“Wow, this is a first, you’re actually early! How have you been darling?” With all of her snark, Pansy was still the first person Draco would go to for anything and everything.
Harry grinned against Draco's heated skin, tongue soothing over a love bite he'd just inflicted. He presses open-mouthed kisses on the pale stretch of canvas spread in front of him, getting moans and whimpers in return for his efforts.
Draco's cheeks warmed to light pink and he rolled his eyes, flopping back down on the cushy mattress. He stared at the canopy above him.
“And… breakfast is ready!” Draco declared as the last sprig of rosemary was added to the mushrooms he had stir-fried. Most would say this was fairly extravagant of him but Draco believed the best thing you could do for yourself was to find time and cook yourself the best meal your resources allowed for.
Draco shakes his head.
I’ll write to you soon.
Harry shakes his head. “Don’t know. If he doesn’t, that will make it easier for him to hide.”
“It’s just a stuffed animal,” Draco tells her. “Harry couldn’t help himself when he saw this one. Said it was perfect for his newest godchild.”
Harry James Potter.
Draco stands up and bends his head. “I’m grateful,” he says.
“He’s a better wizard than you’ll ever be,” Neville says, trying to get the attention back on him. “At least he won’t betray his friends just because he’s scared.”
“Did they say why?” Harry asks.
“Oh, come on. I’ve known you since you were five. And there is only one reason why you show up uninvited and can’t wait till you can get me alone.”
And then this Friday Hermione was crying during breakfast. She was sitting far away from Ron and he kept giving her dirty looks. As soon as she left the Great Hall I followed her. I asked her what was wrong. She just shook her head, grabbed my arm and pulled me up the stairs. We walked a little until we reached the wall with the writing about the chamber on it. Filch still hasn’t found a way to get it off. Hermione pushed open the door to the girl's bathroom and pulled me inside. It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom I’ve ever set foot in. Hermione walked into one of the stalls and set down on the toilet seat. Before I could even ask her again what was going on, Moaning Myrtle floated towards me and told me that this was a girls bathroom and that I was not a girl. I told her that I was just there to help my friend. Myrtle took one look at Hermione and asked if she wanted to kill herself. And then she went on that she wanted to kill herself last Halloween after Peeves had been mean to her, but that she remembered that she was already dead. She let out a tragic sob and then dived into the toilet, splashing water all over the place. I could still hear her sobbing from the u-bend.
“Nothing, Harry,” Neville says. “But Hermione does have a point. We don’t know Malfoy. And Remus promised he would help. We can let him deal with it. We’ve got enough on our plate as it is.”
“We’ve received your request to plea separately for the crimes you are on trial for, is that correct?” Shacklebolt asks.
“Yes,” Harry says.
Dear mom and dad,
“It’s fine,” Neville says in a light tone. “It’s kind of stupid, anyway. So you’re gay, why would that mean you have to tell people. It’s not like I have to make a statement that I’m straight.”
“I hate both of you, just so you know,” Harry says as he sits back down. “We can’t just let him be. Not now that we know he’s deaf.”
I couldn’t sleep, so I took the Daily Prophet that Stan offered me. On the front page was a large photo of Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner. I had also seen him on the Muggle news. It turns out he murdered thirteen people with a single curse twelve years ago. He looked just like a vampire in the picture. Stan saw me looking and told me that Black had been a big supporter of Voldemort. And once Voldemort was gone and he was cornered In the middle of a street he blasted half the street apart, killing one wizard and a dozen Muggles. And after that, he just stood there and laughed, like it was one big joke. It seems that this Black is off his head. And he’s the first one ever to break out of Azkaban.
Your Harry James Potter.
“What are you doing all alone here in the kitchen?” Harry asks her.
I’m going off to bed now. Love you both,
“Nobody gets it,” Neville says. “But it’s starting to take its toll. She yells at Ron more and more. This way they are never getting together.”
“No,” Draco answers.
Hermione puts the paper down. “I might not have grown up with it,” she says. “But I do know what that man did to your family.”
Draco slides his chair back and stands. “I’m going for a walk,” he says.
From that day forward, Draco would sneak down to the dungeon from time to time to watch his father create the most amazing potions. He found a passage mend for the house elves, probably to clean out the cells from his father's victims. Draco was still small enough to go through it, giving him a good view of the test subjects in the small cell. Some of them died quickly, some of them went slowly, screaming in pain for days on end before they would take their final breath.
I also showed Hermione the get well card I had received from Professor Lockhart. She thought it was amazing. I still think it’s too much. He was wishing me a speedy recovery as a concerned teacher. And the way he signed off is just ridiculous, as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award. Who cared that he won the most-charming-smile award. That doesn’t say anything about his abilities as a wizard, or as a teacher. So I gave the card to Hermione. It made her happy and I enjoyed that at least one of us was still finding the strength to smile.
“Yeah, sure. Draco, honey, do you want to go and put your trousers back on?” Harry asks. Draco doesn’t want to, but he nods anyway. A tear slides over his cheek, and he bites his lip. Slowly he sits up. He doesn’t want to let go of Harry’s hand to move to the dressing room. Only a couple of hours ago they relaxed on their sofa, joking about how in a couple of months Harry would have a little baby on his chest and won’t be able to get up all the time to get coffee for Draco. The image is stuck in Draco’s head. Harry holding their baby. A baby that will never be.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” Hermione says. “Your mother won't kill you.”
“Those girls are insane,” Draco signs.
Ron laughs as he pats Harry on his back. Neville shakes his head and grins. Only Hermione looks behind her to see what Harry was staring at.
I said that Snape wanted to steal it for Voldemort. Draco told me to stop saying that name, that you don’t talk about the Dark Lord like that. He didn’t say anything about that I think that Snape is working for Voldemort. It was like that didn’t surprise him at all. He was more afraid of what Voldemort would do to me if he would get his powers back. If he would try to kill me like he had done when I was a baby. And he was afraid of what it would mean for his family if the Dark Lord came back. He told me his father used to be one of his followers. We talked about it the rest of the night and light was already starting to light up the water of the lake when we went to bed.
They both laugh and the tension is gone. “It would have been nice, to have a girlfriend,” Neville says. “Maybe then Lavender and Parvati will leave us alone.”
Saturday 5 September 1992
But I will get to that because after Hagrid had come in he made a knot in uncle Vernon’s rifle and then he gave me a birthday cake. It was the first cake I ever had; at least that I can remember. I’m sure you would have made me a birthday cake for my first birthday. Hagrid turned on the fire and made tea and sausages. I didn’t really know who he was and why he was there so I asked. He got very angry at uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. I was very confused. Hagrid said you were famous, that I was famous and he talked about our world until he realized I really didn’t know. He screamed at uncle Vernon some more and uncle Vernon forbade him to tell me. But he didn’t listen and told me I’m a wizard and gave me my letter. It was a letter to inform me that I have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then Hagrid sends out an owl to a Professor Dumbledore before uncle Vernon told him I wasn’t going. That’s when I found out they had known all along that I was a wizard. Aunt Petunia started screaming about you, mom, and that you ran off with dad and then got yourselves blown up. I got angry then; they always told me that you had died in a car crash. Hagrid also got very angry, saying that it was an outrage. So I asked him what had happened. He became very nervous but told me about the wizard who went bad, named Voldemort. And that this wizard was becoming very powerful. And Hagrid told me that when Voldemort came after you ten years ago on Halloween, he killed you both and tried to kill me. But that I lived and that is why I have the lighting scar on my forehead. It made me very sad. Hagrid said that Voldemort is probably still out there somewhere, without his powers. I hope he’s wrong and that the evil man is dead.
Six years have passed since that day. Six beautiful and loving years. Until two months ago. Until the worst day in Harry’s life.
“You told him?” Harry asks.
A soft knock on the bathroom door brings Draco and Harry back to the rest of the world. The bathroom door opens a little. “I’ve been by the cafeteria and got you guys some fish and chips. Hermione says greasy food always helps, so we decided to deliver some. I’ve left it on the kitchen counter under a stasis spell,” Ron tells them.
The sex thing seemed to be important. The man from the Ministry said something about sealing the bond. That when we became one in flesh our shared soul was healed, linking us together for the rest of our lives.
“Don’t you start too,” Hermione complains. She places the Daily Prophet on the table. “I don’t want you all to get killed,” she says. She finishes her juice and then gets up. “I need to get to class early. Don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone.” She turns and walks away.
The steps come anyway, and Harry takes them and ends up in the Entrance Hall. Draco is still beside him. He slowed down together with Harry. Harry avoids his eyes. Instead, he looks at the stairs to his left, which will lead Harry to Gryffindor tower. Then he glances at the stairs on the right, which go down to the Slytherin dungeon. They will both have to go their separate ways.
“Why did you?” Harry signs.
“Both of you are doing nothing,” James says. Neville and Harry both sit up quickly and see James standing in the doorway. His hand trembles on the doorknob and his face is pale. “No matter how much you two want to take revenge, you are not allowed to go looking for Wormtail.”
‘How did he lose his hearing?’ Draco writes. He keeps his eyes on the parchment as Harry writes his response.
I took out my invisibility cloak and started to look in all the usual spots. I searched the library, in the hope Draco would be there still trying to find a way for me to breath underwater. I searched our favourite spots around the castle, I even tried the Prefect’s bathroom and Myrtle’s bathroom. Only Draco was nowhere to be found. It reminded me of the dreams I used to have in second year. You remember, the ones in which Draco kept disappearing as he’d never excited. It scared me. In the end, I sat down in an alcove and cried myself to sleep.
“Fuck,” Neville says as he spots them. Ron and Hermione turn and take a look too.
I love you both,
“Well, let's go then. You can sit in the back, and we’ll get you back before he even notices that you were gone.”
“I get why you want to hide away,” Remus continues. “And I won’t force you to go to any of your classes today. But hiding away won’t stop others from talking about you. You will have to face the music. And better sooner than later. You don’t want to give the haters the idea that you’re ashamed of who you are. Because it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
They reach the classroom. The door is still closed. There is only one other student this early. Malfoy sits on the floor next to the door, his hair falls into his face. He doesn’t look up from his book when Harry, Neville and Hermione stop on the other side of the hallway. Harry wonders what it would feel like to push that hair out of Malfoy’s face. Would Malfoy let him?
“Let him,” Lily says. “It’s Draco.”
Harry shakes his head. “You don’t know him, Hermione. He’s got his ways,” he says.
When we got to the entrance hall it was packed with students. Blaise went to look for his date Luna. And then Professor McGonagall’s voice called over the crowd for the champions to join her. I don’t think she was pleased to see that I followed her with Draco as my partner. Fleur had managed to find a date in the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain Roger Davies and Cedric had brought Cho. We joked we could talk about Quidditch all night since six of us were Quidditch players. Fleur didn’t seem happy with this news and Draco reassured her in French (he’s sexy when he speaks French) that we would not talk about Quidditch all night (at least that’s what he told me he said, but we’ll never know because none of the others speak French).
Only it hadn’t been Draco that had returned. It had been Ron that had come in through the floo to pull Harry to St. Munges. To have him sit in a chair hoping the healers would be able to save Draco.
When we came to Hagrid’s hut, he also looks suspicious of Draco being there but didn’t say anything. The egg was already full of deep cracks and a funny clicking noise was coming from it. We watched closely and with a scraping noise, the egg split open. A baby dragon looks ugly, like a crumpled, black umbrella. And it had huge wings compared to its skinny body. Its eyes are orange and it had stubs of horns and a long snout with wide nostrils. Hagrid thought it was beautiful, Draco said it looks disgusting and wanted to leave. He froze on his way to the door, saying someone had looked through the window. I jumped to my feet and threw the door open and saw Nott running away in the distance.
Teddy looks at his bag and shakes his head. “No toothbrush,” he states. “My teeth don’t need brushing.”
“Maybe that should tell you, that you aren’t the one that is supposed to find him,” Hermione says.
Harry looks at his food. Fresh tears start to well up.
“Harry James Potter, you are brought before the Wizengamot to be trailed for the crimes you committed. I understand that you have waived the right to have an attorney present. Is that correct?” Shacklebolt says.
“Don’t. You didn’t do this. I did. I almost destroyed us, like I destroy everything. Harry, I destroy everything.” Draco sobs.
“I’m fine,” Draco tells Harry. “It’s nice to be here for something good.”
“Do you like your tea, uncle Draco?” Teddy asks.
Hermione shakes her head. “Your father is involved with everything at the Ministry, Ron,” she says. “He’s too curious for his own good. You’ve heard Shacklebolt at Harry’s and Neville’s birthday party. Your father always stops by at the Auror office to find out the latest news.”
“I think I’m ready to stop with the birth control potions,” Draco says.
There were people ahead of us. Hermione and I forgot for a moment that we were already invisible and shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other. Draco was one of the people, together with Professor McGonagall. She shouted: ‘Detention, and twenty points from Slytherin!’ Draco tried to convince her that Nott was coming; that he was planning on hurting Harry again, but the professor wouldn’t believe him. And I think the statement was more mend for me than for the professor. Draco had wandered out at night to try to warn me. And now he’s in trouble because of it. I feel really bad about that.
Harry felt his face soften into admiration, but Draco was too absorbed in his tasks to notice. He didn't know what would come after this breakfast but he wanted to make sure this wasn’t the last time he saw Draco. Too much felt too right to walk away from this and just
Shortly after the two had finished their lunch, determining what to do after was a difficult decision to make. Mostly because Pansy wanted to shop for shoes and Draco wanted to shop for mugs.
“It’s wonderful that you want to help yourself Harry but I also hope you go into this with the right intentions and I don’t just mean the job, you know. You got out of a significantly long and exhaustive, not to forget an important relationship only six months ago. If you genuinely see yourself working at Ikea, wonderful! Go for it and send in your application by the end of tomorrow. You know what you will need to do if things get difficult. However, a real relationship doesn’t work with that kind ease- that if you find a problem you can break up, you more than anyone knows this Harry. So be sure you know what you’re getting yourself into and remember to take it one step at a time.”
Harry takes care in writing his notes. He thinks about the words more than he would ever think about something he would write for one of his essays or tests. These words seem more important than paying attention in class. They are more important than anything else.
Draco whimpers as he helplessly looks at his mother. She is stronger than him. But she shouldn’t be the one that gets hurt. Draco is the one that betrayed the Dark Lord. He should stop the man and make sure his mother is safe. Only he can’t save her. Draco is useless. A coward. A boy beyond hope. Lost on the wrong side of a war that will cost him all he holds dear.
“Leftover from Teddy’s fall,” Draco answers. His voice sounds so hollow, as if it doesn’t matter. It sounds like the Draco from sixth year when he was high all the time and didn’t care what happened next. Harry lifts his head and looks at the man in front of him. His eyes stare past Harry, into the distance.
A tear falls from Harry’s eye as he slumps against the bookcase behind him. His grip on his wand loosens and it almost rolls from his fingers again. His brother is dead. And it’s all Harry’s fault. He convinced him that they could take Pettigrew. He was the one who said they didn’t need any help. And he was the one who raced to the library as soon as he saw that Draco was here.
The door to the bedroom opens. Excited footsteps make it to the bed, and Draco isn’t surprised when a soft Teddy-bear gets put down on his chest. The bed dips a little when Teddy crawls onto it and lays down next to Draco.
“You still want to pretend that you don’t fancy him?” Hermione asks when Harry sits down next to her. She already has a book on her lap, as if she never left for the holidays.
Dinners are hard. The Dark Lord acts as if nothing has changed. None of the others know that Draco is ashamed of the mark on his arm. That he’s a traitor to their cause. And that frightens Draco the most. What is the reasoning behind all this? Why does the Dark Lord not make an example of him?
It was a beautiful sunny day when we got on the train back to London. Draco and I sat alone in a compartment by ourselves. Blaise, Luna, Greg and Daphne said we should rest and that they would be just across the hall. Draco took me in his arms and I soon fell asleep against his chest. It wasn’t until after lunch, when Hermione and Ron came looking for us that I woke up again. Draco had some sandwiches for me, not that I was hungry. But he forced me to eat something, said it was no good to stop eating.
