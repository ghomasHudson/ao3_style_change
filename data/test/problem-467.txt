That was the big question, he had zero memory and that was not good. He needed to know what happened to know how to react to Potter. Merlin, help him if Potter knew what happened last night. Then he would have one over him.
So the lesson had gone well, for both boys it seems, Harry only seemed to be in a sour mood solely due to the fact that Malfoy had overpowered him, though it surprised her that Ron was not complaining about Blaise though, she had to ask Pansy for her side of the pair-up.
“ I’ll make sure Harry gets to the end of his chase by that time then...Should we plan something then? To make sure they have to be together after they retrieve their memories and not run due to embarrassment?”
But luck was yet again not on his side, he was an inch shorter than Draco, which meant he needed at least two more inches to have a notable height difference than Draco. Because that was the ultimate goal, to be taller than his boyfriend such that he could do the same things Draco had been doing to him, tease him in the same way he had teased.  And with Harry being stuck with an inch shorter than Draco, the dream was so close but yet so far, he had to do something about it. Damn.
“You are aware that we are doing wandless casting right, there is literally no weapon to be expelled from my hands? Didn't think that through, did you?”
“ Don't be rude Potter… but no I don't remember until like ten..twenty minutes ago, I brewed a potion to regain my memories.”
However, their two best friends, Hermione and Pansy knew better than that, the attraction between the pair was undeniable, and everyone could see it, well, to everyone but the two boys.
Walking back to Hermione and Ron, he relayed back what he had found out from the fairies, of course leaving out the whole them-acting-so-much-like-a-couple-that-the-fairies-mistook-them-as-a-couple part, because that was ridiculous.
He was right, as always, as he watched Potter and himself dive down in pursuit of what they thought was the snitch, they were wrong, as he could see now, the snitch was nowhere near them.
“Hush. We’ll leave you two alone for now and leave the questioning for tomorrow, that is if you two love-struck idiots end up leaving each other 's side tonight.” and with a very well executed wink, the two girls left the dumbstruck boys alone.
The day after the Yule ball was a Saturday, which means Harry had all the time in the world to nurse his hangover and get over what happened yesterday. The hangover was substantial, it would be gone in a few hours( bless the beauty that is magic), however that much bigger problem in front of him now is what was he going to do about Malfoy.
With that, the both very oblivious teens stormed off in preparation to the events that just went down, each looking to outdo the other, humiliate each other. Leaving in the charms corridor, a very confused Ron, a gawking Pansy and one Hermione, who desperately needed a pensieve, preserve this memory forever and ever.
“Jobberknoll feathers, stewed mandrake, powdered sage, four drops of Mnemosyne river water and other things on your list that we’ve gathered for you” Blaise declared to the spare potion’s room Draco was brewing in, dumping the bag of ingredients next to where the blond was brewing.
While both boys stayed in their dorms to nurse their hangovers, all of Hogwarts are betting on whether the two boys were dating, based on the way they acted last night.
“Potter! Looks like puberty has yet to hit you at age 17?” Harry turned around to look at Malfoy, look up at Malfoy. God, how he hated that he was shorter than his boyfriend. “Still as short as you were when you were a mere firstie, aren’t you?”
“ But Blaise has a point in asking this time, it's a bit past midnight, which means the potion should be done.” Gregory pointed out, after casting a quick glance to the clock in the classroom.
“ Harry! Relax! Finish your breakfast then we’ll go retracing your footsteps around the school okay?” Yes retracing footsteps, that sounded good to Harry, he might remember something on the way, it's always good to have a Hermione in your life.
Draco smirked at Potter’s smirk, he knew his protegos were first class, far superior to Potter’s, they were important to survival in the war after all. And Potter was so predictable, casting an expelliarmus as his first spell, smirking as he watched his shield hold strong against the saviour’s favourite spell.
“Harry! Wait!” Stopping in his steps towards the library, he saw Ginny coming out of the Gryffindor dorms. “ You’ve stopped growing.”
“That seems like an easier plan than retracing their footsteps,” Hermione admitted begrudgingly, upset that she didn't think of it first, “ but it probably would suit Harry’s style more to retrace, might trigger something in him. How long would his potion take?”
Most of Hogwarts were quite definitely sold on the idea that they were together, I mean they’ve seen known couples act less in love than the display last night. Bets were being passed around on whether the two boys were going to be the star-crossed couple of Hogwarts.
“ You don't remember too? I thought you were being a smug idiot, holding the fact that you knew something that I didn't over my head!”
Casting a tempus charm to check the time, ten past twelve, not too bad. Harry let out a long sigh as he released the struggling snitch in his hand letting it roam around the confines of his four poster bed.
Flipping through his potions book that he acquired over the weekend during his first class of the morning, History of Magic with the Hufflepuffs, Draco finally found the potion he had needed, recuperare memoriae, to retrieve one's memory. Yes this would be dead useful for his predicament now, the ingredients were pretty basic, jobberknoll feathers, stewed mandrake, powdered sage. Granted the steps were a bit complicated, but he was no novice brewer. All he had to do was avoid any possible interaction or questioning for the next forty eight hours. He could do this.
As charms class came to an end, Pansy and Hermione already had a plan formulated in their minds (and a back-up plan, courtesy of Hermione’s ), both girls walking over to their respective charges, ready to carry out what they had crowned phase two of their master plan.
His meals now contained a healthy portion of proteins, whole grains and vegetables. Ron had taken one look at his meals and fled, afraid that he would too be put into the same routine if he stayed near too long.
Draco and Harry try (seperately) to regain their loss memories of Yule. Pansy and Hermione begin their meddling
“ This is a growth potion, it’ll help you gain like two, three inches instantly. That’s what you need right? A few more inches to be taller than Malfoy?”
But there was nothing stopping him from not stopping his interaction with Malfoy. For the first time in his life, there was no one to tell him what to do, or that his life was hanging on the line for that matter.
Spotting a hint of gold at the corner of his eyes, the seeker in him immediately flanked left to catch the snitch. The snitch seemed to be as caught off guard as he was, seeing that his attempt to catch it was an immediate success.
The students were great, especially the firsties, they were the least affected by the war, and still possessed the air of innocence he wished so badly to have. Another good thing about them was that they were not allowed to attend the Yule ball, and therefore had no knowledge of himself attending the event with Potter.
“Harry, you were the only ones here since Hooch and Hagrid cleaned the pitch on friday, ever considered that this pile of vomit could be your pile of vomit?”
“ Correct me if I’m wrong, but I have a feeling that I’m not the only one who had a wicked hangover and forgot nearly everything that happened in Yule for like the past few days?”
One could pretend the ball never happened if they wished. Draco, in particular, almost wished for the ball to have never happened, or for Mondays to never exist. He had spent the past two days cooped up in the Slytherin dorms, using the excuse of tutoring the younger years as to avoid any human contact.
To his memory, the room looked largely untouched from when they last visited it, which was a good thing, it meant that no one had seen the bright orange words spelled onto the wall.
Together they headed of to their first class in the morning, which was transfiguration, and despite Harry’s head protesting that he should continue on his pursuit of his memories of Friday, he knew better than to invoke Mcgonagall’s anger by missing a class, so the trip to the quidditch pitch had to wait.
“Just to recap here, you have no memory of last night beyond your sixth drink of fire whiskey?” Nodding in confirmation, Harry followed his friends towards the castle grounds, which apparently they were rumored to be spotted arriving at by some students.
However, the debate had brought out the competitiveness in both of them, which brought him to the next snippet, taking place at the quidditch pitch , where they had released a snitch and proceeded to have a seeker’s game to settle the score one and for all, as they had agreed
He quickly filled two glasses of the mixture and started his way back to their table. What was Hermione and Parkinson thinking, ruining their perfectly non-awkward talking.
it did say. Draco had a feeling that Harry did not remember the entirety of the night, Draco had been the same rambling mess when confessing to Harry of his little obsession over him. Harry, sober, likes him, smiling at that thought, Draco took a step closer to Harry.
The three headed off to the Quidditch pitch in search of the next part of the Malfoy-Potter Yule Night Rendezvous, as Ron had so nicely christened, or as Harry had so vehemently argued that it should be Potter-Malfoy, which Hermione had promptly objected to due to alphabetical preference.
Harry nodded his consent to the arrangement, not trusting his voice for much longer now that he processed the situation properly, in his memory served him right, the tenseness in the situation was more than warranted considering the last time they were alone in this room with each other, there had been a lot of
Harry and Draco continue in their endeavor to search for their loss memories, slowly coming closer to the truth.
It was Gregory Goyle who had opened the door to meet the brunette. To say he was shocked with what he was seeing would have been an understatement. No, if he hadn't had the Slytherin reputation to uphold. His jaw would have fallen straight to hell.
“ If you're bored, you are more than welcomed to leave, had I not made that clear the last few hundred times you asked?” Draco drawled back to him.
Hermione launched into a detailed explanation of how Harry, the idiot, had apparently lost all his memory of the night and how they were now retracing their footsteps.
“ You really thought that you could be taller than me Potter?” Draco’s smirk seemed to grow larger as Harry had to look up him again, “ I had a back-up plan all along, I overheard Ginerva’s plan to give you the potion and decided that it would be smart to have one myself.”
“I’m going to kiss you now.” Draco whispered the statement, causing Harry’s eyes to widen momentarily before shutting close again when their lips connected.
“Why thank you for that very welcoming greeting Draco. Hermione and I were just noticing how the both of you seem to be waltzing your nights away without even saying a simple hello to your best friends.” Pansy remarked idly while sipping on her tea, careful not to smudge any of her lipstick. “Did you forget to tell me something, Draco dear?”
Reaching the top, he took a second to take in the breathtaking view that was Hogwarts at night before bursting into the little veranda-like room on the left. Taking in the view in front of him, Harry did not know whether to cringe or to sigh in relief.
“ It isn’t exactly the option to go for, the Ministry banned it a long time ago. In fact, only really old pureblood families have the formula anymore, to make sure their heirs are at a respectable height. There’s an ingredient inside that might cause hallucination or death if you have too much of it. That’s why it was banned and banished out of existence and all. People wanted to grow taller too desperately and over-consumed, But you won’t do it, yeah?”
But the sight of the familiar platinum blonde hair, stopped the incantation form coming out of his mouth, “ Malfoy? What are you doing here?” the words stumbled out of his mouth before he could process them, he never could control himself around the Slytherin.
And stare Draco did, Draco stared up at him, with a slight tilt to his head. A memory that Harry needed to possess forever. But annoyingly he didn't seem too bothered by the fact that Harry was taller than him, in fact Draco maintained that same old infuriating smirk on his face and continued to  saunter over to him and planted a firm kiss on his lips, a kiss where he had to tilt up for mind you.
It was Flitwick’s lucky day then, for the last class of the day was a Slytherin-Gryffindor Charms and the cheery half-goblin already had plans for his students to pair up to practice casting shield charms. Humming a merry tune to himself, Flitwick put the last of his work away and prepared for the sure to be interesting lesson to begin.
“Because I am feeling very thirsty right now, like VERY thirsty, in fact I see the butterbeer table right there, do you want one? You probably do, I’ll go get some for us, toodles!” And with that elegant greeting, our savior practically ran to the drinks table, before his counterpart could get a word in.
Harry grumbled under his breath, although taking the extended hand of his boyfriend and allowing him to escort him to their little picnic date. Draco would never admit it but he loved doing the sappy things in a relationship. Harry would never admit that he loved doing the sappy things with him either. It was secretly great to have someone put in that much effort to spend time with him, something they both lacked growing up, he mused.
It was nice having something to call himself, bisexual, he had no problem identifying with that label. But the problem was the realization that he was indeed what people called a bisexual disaster. But he couldn't help it that boys and girls were so pretty, especially the ones playing quidditch, Cedric, Cho, Ginny, Malfoy.
Shedding his robe and folding his sleeves up, Draco prepared himself for a long night of brewing and annoying from his friends.
“So you're telling me that you have completely no memory of what happened that night,” Draco nodded, “and that you are completely convinced that Potter knows what happened that night and now you need our help to brew a potion to get your memories back?”
Harry suddenly thought the great hall’s floors looked very beautiful. Really ,Harry was awestruck on how well the marbling was done and Draco never thought the artificial night sky looked as beautiful as it did tonight.
Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table and started piling food on his plate, feeling his best friends’ stares on him, he admitted, “guys I messed up.”
Hermione credited his desperateness to recover the lost memories to another one of his obsessions with Draco Malfoy, which was admittedly correct, but this time rather than having the feeling that Malfoy was up to something, Harry felt that they had been up to something
On Monday, students filled in to the great hall as usual, all of the decorations for the ball was gone, leaving the great hall looking the way everyone was used to.
“Sorry man, didn't think I would have knocked you off your broom, but that was kind of entirely your fault, you could have caught that!” Harry heard Ron say as his friend came to a smooth landing next to where he fell. “What’s that smell?”
“Let the record show that there is never an uninteresting year when you are friends with Harry Potter.”
“Greg?” Draco asked, a fiery look in his eyes “Where were those treacle tarts that I bought the other day?”
For a while, both boys stared at the graffiti on the wall in silence, almost like they were acknowledging the idea that once this was erased, the little skit they had in between them would be gone too.
The astronomy tower! Jolting up that thought, more memories immediately started flowing through Harry's mind, as if it had been a gateway lever, letting loose all of the lost memories from that night.
Rolling her eyes at him, Ginny thrust a bottle of greenish-silver liquid towards him, a suspicious potion, his mind supplied, “ Cut the sass, Harry. You’ve been trying to out grow Malfoy in height right? I’ve kept an eye out for your progress, you’ve had a nice growth spurt going on for you but you haven’t grown at all in the last week, contrary to your record the last few months”
I originally thought this would be the last chapter but turns out I have much more in mind, so I stopped here and planned for another chapter! Hope you like this chapter, feel free to leave a kudos or a comment- it really makes my day! Again, un-beta'd so do point out any mistakes or suggestions so i can improve!! Thank you for reading and the next chapter should be coming out on Saturday. (hopefully) Visit me at my tumblr drarryismysoul too!
“Yes Harry, I worked so hard to make sure your every strand of hair is in place for tonight and you ignore me for the whole night?” Hermione added on.
Quickly getting dressed, he rushed down to the common room to see the little ones waiting for him already. Turning back he saw his friends chasing him down the stairs, sending them a smirk, he strode to the table and began their tutoring, knowing how clueless these kids were, they could last as a distraction for two days.
Malfoy was the biggest problem of them all. Pretty blonde git. The thing was that Malfoy was his enemy, and before, Harry would have never seen him as more, and if not because of his trip down the rabbit hole on the internet, discovering the idea of an enemy-to-lovers trope, he never would. But alas, he did and now was stuck in this little crisis, so afraid that something could have happened during that lost night and the little fantasy he had been entertaining for so long would be … lost.
Draco was really starting to question his decision to drink, apparently when he was drunk, he had no self-preservation or common sense . Watching in despair as the scene continued to play out, he wanted desperately to smack himself in the face as he heard the suggestion that they should head up to the astronomy tower because, vomiting from a height was cooler than vomiting from the ground.
Draco could see Potter’s attention shift from his idiotic comment to the sole purpose of defeating him, Potter could never resists a challenge, and Draco could never resist putting Potter down.
Harry found himself being put on a vigorous routine by Hermione to facilitate his growth. Sleeping at ten sharp and waking up at six, a full eight hours of sleep. Then, laps around Hogwarts ground, jump-roping, followed by a session of yoga. Not to mention the hours they put in in the room of requirement, now featuring its left half as a fully equipped gym and its right half as a library for Hermione.
Closing his eyes for a moment, Draco was brought to the astronomy tower, already dreading what new horrors the new location would bring, he walked closer to where the two boys were, where he witnessed easily the most disastrous scene of the night. He had to remedy this, right now.
Harry, in fact, was dressed in a pair of Slytherin green dress robes that Blaise swore he saw Draco place an owl order for two weeks back. To say Harry had cleaned up nice would have been an understatement, with dress robes of that standard and his seeker shaped body typed, he would have every boy and girl in this room pining for him before this night ends.
Both boy’s eyes quickly widened at that comment and the implication that came behind it. Harry watched as the panic in Malfoy’s eyes rose comically and quickly cast a protego maxima to shield himself from the quick succession of spells that came spilling from Malfoy’s lips next.
Three hours, three whole hours. That was how long Harry had spent voluntarily in the library searching for spells, potions or whatever method that could help him gain some height. But for some reason that was beyond him, not even the extensive library of Hogwarts had one single book on height growth, how is that even possible?
That was something new too, something he discovered through Luna, then learnt more through the wonderful muggle invention of the internet. That he was bisexual, not that he had told anyone yet, but in his eyes it didn't matter, because he never inherently said he was straight and so people shouldn’t assume, and if someone had a problem with it they can have a nice taste of his very-powerful-voldemort-defeating expelliarmus.
Putting his contempt of being a great seeker aside, more questions flooded his mind, why was there a snitch? Ron mentioned that Malfoy and him were the only ones who accessed the pit since then, did they have a seeker’s match and failed to catch the snitch?
Harry was pacing in the abandoned classroom he had asked Draco to meet him at. After ingesting the potion Ginny had given him and marvelling at the effects it brought, he had immediately asked Draco to meet him here to gloat.
And if Malfoy was taken aback by his answer, he didn't let it show, after all his pureblood raising did him well. The gears in the blondes head turned as he thought of the best answer to Harry bloody Potter, the ball was now in his court and obviously he’s not going to pass up on the chance to humiliate the scarhead and so he takes the most logical route of humiliation, for Potter of course, and calls out his bluff.
He felt as if someone had swung a metal hammer at him, as the memories of the night swarmed him all at once, bringing him to a potion-caused black-out, to relive his memories of the night.
While memory-them were busy emptying their guts, Draco turned away and sorted his thoughts on the new information presented to him, seemingly in their drunken state, they had started calling each other by their first names. It was odd, to say the least, hearing the words
Slightly reeling from the spectacular kiss he was given, Harry watched doe-eyed as Draco pulled a potion out from his pockets?
Widening his eyes as he caught himself on the wild train of thoughts, where did that come from? Shaking his head to clear it of its impure thoughts, He cast a scourgify for the sake of avoiding anyone else coming across it.
After a few moments of silence, the audience grew increasingly frustrated at the odd silence of the pair, until Ron broke the silence first, “The hell are you doing mate?”
Hoping the memories he got back would be worth the trouble he's going through to get them, Draco read the steps for the potion again, committing them to memory.
Nearing the drinks table, he spotted the bowl Seamus had told him about. Before he had left the lion’s den to meet Malfoy, Seamus had happily announced to the upper years that next to the “boring pumpkin juice” was a firewhiskey laced punch bowl.
Sliding closer to Hermione amidst the questions benign directed at the boys, Pansy raised a suggestive eyebrow at her girlfriend, “Since they now are dating, oddly without our help, and we are dating, would you be interested in setting up the remaining member of the Golden Trio with Blaise?”
The quidditch pitch was normally fairly quiet this time of the year, with the next big house match not due till two months from now. The Golden trio had the pitch all to themselves, much to their relief.
Scoffing at the fairies wild imagination, he blushed furiously as he thought of what could have happened next if this was only his first location of the night, why did drunk him had to be an adventurous him?
But the dive explained the mysterious bruise on his thigh, past-Draco took a nasty hit when crashing down next to Harry, the edge of the broom roughly slamming into his thigh. That was one mystery explained.
With that, Draco grabbed the box of very precious tarts to give to his arch rival. And if he subconsciously remembered that treacle tarts were Harry’s absolute favorite, well all we can say is coincidence, I think not.
The first time Draco and Harry meet after Yule, and due to a sneaky half-goblins neddling, they end up partners for wandless casting practice.
Harry had given Draco the reason of wanting to fill out into his frame, no longer wanting to be small and scrawny as the reason for his sudden passion for exercise, omitting the wanting-to-grow-taller part. Draco seemed to buy it, or is simply much too appreciative of his new physique to comment anything.
Pansy nodded at what she said, her mind tinkering up a new plan to push the boys together, “That makes sense, Draco wouldn't confirm anything but I believe he doesn't remember anything that happens that night. Knowing him, he’ll probably brew a potion to retrieve his memories back.”
He lied, he wasn’t thirsty at all. No Harry just needed a quick out to that increasingly awkward situation between himself and Malfoy. But toodles?, Merlin, he had to bury himself in a hole.
Malfoy seemed to be in some intense conversation with Parkinson and Zabini when he awkwardly padded over to begin the exercise. Damn Flitwick, why did he choose to do wandless casting today instead of silent casting? He'd do anything to avoid this confrontation with Malfoy.
“Guys this is getting too confusing for anyone to follow and I’m not going to be late for charms. Harry, just get ready for the impromptu of your life, if it comes to it, I’ll send a stray hex to you and you won’t have to talk to Malfoy okay?”
“ The reason there are no wizarding books on magical height growth is because it.. Well it never goes well. It's widely discouraged worldwide to use magic to fundamentally change your appearance, which is why you would not find any books on such things here.”
Pushing Draco’s hand away from his hair, he resolved to find a way to grow taller than Draco, or at least lessen their height difference, they had magic for a reason right? There has to be some type of spell of rapid height growth.
Stuffing his books into his bag, he set off towards the library, hoping to catch Hermione on one of her many visits there to ask for any more pointers that could help him gain the last few inches he needed. He was desperate, muggle, magic, hell tie him to a chair and stretch him from both ends.
Even more the two girls had started a betting system on when their friends would stop “being so fucking oblivious”. Actually almost half of the Gryffindors and Slytherins had placed a bet down and were actively waiting for the results.
“I resent that nickname, but very well I accept,” handing over the list of ingredients he needed, “ I need these by nine at night or the deals off.”
The morning after the ball, he was brutally awoken by his friends, who sat themselves in an interrogation semi-circle around his bed. Looking at the scene in front of him, Draco groaned internally, he wasn't ready for this.
Putting that aside, he himself was beyond confused, they had gone outside? His memory of last night didn't go beyond their sixth drink of firewhiskey, his friends seemed to be more informed of his actions than he were.
Checking the map to make sure that the corridor leading up to the astronomy tower was indeed empty, Harry rushed up the stairs to the tower, head spinning even more as he leaped up two steps at a time on the spiralling staircases.
Monday’s lessons were a quiet affair, luckily for the teachers, because for most of the lessons on that day, the Ravenclaws were paired with the Gryffindors and the Hufflepuffs with the Slytherins. But today was different, the faculty of Hogwarts wanted to have a Slytherin-Gryffindor class, all to see if Potter and Malfoy relationship would take a change after yule, after all there was an on-going pool on when they would finally stop their pining, and the pool was slowly increasing by galleons.
He didn't know what to say to his friends, so he deflected the question away, with his favourite weapon, sarcasm.
“Oh Harry, you can be so oblivious sometimes! Hush go on to Malfoy, I’ll keep an eye out if i need to hex you.” Hermione admonished, lightly pushing Harry towards his partner for the lesson.
Okay, so a mysterious bruise on his thigh and zero memory of the night, maybe he really couldn't hold his firewhiskey.
Would this be the last time they talked to each other? The Yule ball was over and now that they were taking care of the aftermaths, they had no reason to continue to speak to each other. Casting
Then there was the other half, led by the drarry ship co-captains, Hogwarts’ very own rainbow flag waver- Hermione and Pansy. I mean- Have you seen how those two act? yes they're bloody oblivious, but they’re so in love. And are we not going to take in account their engorgio’ed egos? They were sure that the both of them would take an avada kedavra before they back down to a challenge.
Draco didn't think much when the spells came out from his mouth, like he didn't think over the comment much as well, and what a stupid decision the latter had been. The former however, was a great decision. The spells, filled with the power from his embarrassment, passed through Potter’s excuse of a protego maxima and knocked him off his feet and onto his arse.
Maybe it was something that the war had implanted in him, missing knowledge was not good. The last few times he had been kept in the dark, it had been all life-altering information, that he had been a wizard, that he was a horcrux, that apparently liking girls
“Potter? No Draco told us to come here, I didn't know you’d be here? Speaking of them, they're both conveniently missing, you don't think they’ve figured it out, right?”
Professor Filius Flitwick was an old man who loved to watch young love blossom, which is why he always paired all his students with who he wanted them to end up with or a young couple together, shipping, the young people called it. Sometimes, these ships were meant to sink, but he had fun during the journey, but the one couple that would not fail would be Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.
“Nothing just that my father is unconscious on the bedroom floor, disguised as my mother, so you decide what’s up.” Draco shouted, and Tonks jumped up of the couch and ran for the bedroom that the boys were sharing. They heard shouting and some spells being cast, and after a while, Tonks came out of the room pulling Lucius Malfoy by a set of handcuffs behind her.
“To see Ron and Hermione finally see that they love each other and to stop dancing around each other.” Harry said as he pushed memories of Ron and Hermione together laughing and the tree of them having fun together; them fighting side by side in all of the messes that they have gotten themselves into. Every moment that mattered to Harry about his friends.
“We’re good, Professor. I just wish we were actually here for classes. We’re looking for something, and we need to find it before something bad happens. I won’t talk about it here.”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, you are both up, you may leave I have done my test on Mr. Potter and have cleared him healthy. Though, I do want to warn you about any snacks you may want for the next 36 hours to be cautioned, or non-existent would be preferred. Understood?”
“The horror.” Harkin laughed as she wrapped her arms around Draco’s neck, and she kissed his lips briefly. “But I do believe you were rude and interrupted your mother’s dining lesson.” Harkin stated as she brushed her fingers through his hair.
Okay, so i have a clear winner, and though it wasn't my favorite name, I'm going with it. I don't know when I'll incorporate it into the story because I'm currently writing a couple chapters ahead right now, but it'll be within the next couple of chapters. So the results come to Harley as the clear victor with five vote ahead of the other names.
Harry woke from sleep with the dream at the forefront of her mind. The Dark Lord tortured Nott for raping her. How did he even know that he did that? She sat upright at the sound of someone knocking on her door. “Come in.” Harry whispered, and in her doorway stood Voldemort. “How did you find out?” Harry asked and for the first time Harry saw a look of confusion on Voldemort’s face.
“I don’t like this position.” Draco stated and Harry pulled out his fingers and rolled them so Draco was back on the bottom. Harry’s hand slid back down and his finger slid into place.
“Well, that was a very productive conversation.” Draco heard his mother say from behind him, and he chuckled as he turned back towards the table and sat down. Draco and Harry started eating again, and Harry’s foot was sitting on Draco’s lap stroking his inner thigh. The room started to feel as if it was warming up.
“Great job, Weasley. Now you’ve upset my elf.” Draco turned back to Tally and pulled the elf into his lap, and the elf curled into the embrace. “I haven’t used another elf, Tally. You’ve done nothing wrong. Weasley was just trying to get me in trouble and he isn’t doing a very good job at it.” Draco could feel Ron’s and everyone’s eyes on his back as he tried to comfort his elf, but Draco didn’t care what people thought of him.
“Hey, babe,” Draco said as he stroked Harry’s hair out of his face. “Are you afraid of my mother?” Draco teased as he thread his fingers into Harry’s hair, and he pulled Harry’s hair backwards. He sat up and he kissed Harry’s neck, pulling Harry closer to him. Draco rolled slightly so he was half on top of Harry but also half off of him. Draco continued kissing and sucking on Harry’s neck, and Harry moaned as Draco slipped his leg between his and applied a little pressure to his erection. Draco pulled away from Harry and looked him in the eyes as he applied more pressure to Harry’s erection. “Because if you are, you really shouldn’t be. My mother couldn’t hurt a fly, and the only way she could hurt someone is not by having sex with her son. Plus my mother knew that we would do this even if she told us that we should be careful in someone else’s home. She knew, Babe, so don’t worry. Relax.”
“Yes, thank you.” Narcissa said as she wrapped her arm around Draco’s waist and guided him towards Healer Johnson’s office. Narcissa opened the office door for Draco, who shuffled past and placed Harry on the couch as Lucius and Severus walked in the room with Healer Johnson following them in.
“Oh, okay. Just wondering.” That’s when Rodolphus raised his wand and cast the first spell, and of course, it was the Cruciatus curse. Harry jerked and clamped his jaw shut as the spell zapped through him, and Harry did his best not to scream because that was what he wanted. Harry just had to hold out until the Aurors arrived, not knowing how long that was going to be though, was what was killing Harry.
“No, my father cares so much more about blood purity, than he does about his only son’s happiness. My father would rather end the Malfoy line than have our blood purity be tainted.”
“Of course, Minerva. If the young lady could step up for me.” Harry stepped up onto the stool and scolded at McGonagall as he turned.
“Well, I think Hermione’s figured it out. You wanted to eat.” Harry beamed as he turned and walked over to his bed and sat down, pulling one of the plates over to him in the process. Draco walked over and sat down behind Harry, wrapping himself around Harry’s back side, and Harry moaned as the heat melted into his skin, leaning into the heat as he ate. Draco pulled one of the plates over and started eating himself.
The next morning Harry woke up in Draco’s arms, and he was wide awake watching her sleep. “Morning,” she whispered, and he kissed the top of her head. “Did you sleep at all last night?”
“Sorry, Draco. This is new to me; this potion is incredibly old, and no one has used it in centuries. It was originally used as an abortion potion until they realized how dangerous it was for the women who drank it. So, they banned the use of it for medical purposes, and then later for any form of use, because people were forcing women to drink it in cases of cheating spouses accidentally getting their mistresses pregnant. Your father must be extremely desperate to get rid of the twins if he has stooped this low.” Melody explained, and Draco turned his head with and angry glare.
They then walked down to the dining room where everyone was waiting for them, and Harry stopped dead in her tracks as she spotted the Minister sitting in one of the chairs at the table. Draco turned and looked at her, and she started shaking her head. “Severus said he wouldn’t tell.” She whispered.
“They said that as far as they can tell, it is permanent. There is nothing they can do to reverse it or change you back. The only way that they figured they might be able to do anything is for you to go to their facilities for them to do test and other things.”
“Well, my guess is that the potion I had you and Harry drink worked, but there is only one way to find out.” Severus said as he stood up and walked over to the pair and pointed his wand at Harry, and Draco was about to say something when Harry grabbed his wrist to stop him, and he didn’t move. Severus cast the spell, and it hit Harry and then expanded and then contracted. “Harry is no longer a Horcrux, and now for the other test.” Severus cast another spell, and an invisible cloud formed around Harry and started to expand and when the cloud touched Draco another cloud formed around Draco and they mingled and kept expanding around them until the clouds filled the room and then they sprung back towards Harry and Draco.
“Yes, I thought you knew.” Draco said as he finally looked up from Harkin to look at the other people in the room.
“Oh, I wasn’t aware. Yes, I can test paternity. Just hold still for a moment.” She said as he lifted her wand and cast a spell at Draco, and then at Harry, and she looked back up at Draco. “You’re the father, Draco.”
“You heard me. Your magic and body didn’t know what to do with the extra DNA, and since your body separated the DNA, one child is your and Draco’s and the other is your and Thaddeus Nott’s.” Melody explained further.
“I’m hoping none. But only time will tell.” Draco stood up and walked away, Granger would like to be there, and possibly the Weasels. Draco wanted to just walk out, but Madam Pomfrey grabbed his wrist.
Draco captured Harry’s lips again, and Draco leaned down and gripped behind Harry’s knees and pulling him up. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, and Draco managed to push his way back inside Harry while still kissing him. Harry had both his arms wrapped around Draco’s neck, while Draco had one arm wrapped around Harry’s lower back and his other hand was massaging Harry’s erection. Harry had to pull back from the kiss to breathe while resting his back against the shower wall.
“Yes, you may, and I will give you a straight forward answer. I have been observing Harry’s actions for the past four and a half years of my life from right next to the glass, where as you and the Minister have been observing him from the little cameras observing the exhibits for half a year. I probably know more about Harry Potter than the entirety of the Ministry, but less than his friends. So I’m a pretty good source on whether Harry would plan this on herself or not.” Draco stated, and he turned towards Professor Dumbledore. “Professor, would you mind if I take up a few minutes of your time later today after my last class?”
“Me! Why didn’t I say anything? I was a little distracted, and you wouldn’t let me get a word in edge wise. Draco when you touch me, I lose all train of thought. How do you expect me to stop you when all I can think of is how great it feels for you to touch me?” Harkin shouted.
Harry was panting as Draco drew him closer to cumming. “Dray, almost there.” Harry panted. Draco quickened his pace, and Harry’s back arched at Draco’s hand against his back. “Dray, I’m going to…I’m going…” Harry came all over his and Draco’s chests, and afterwards Draco quickened his pace even more. Harry tried to use what leverage he had to meet Draco’s thrusts.
“Yeah, but we should probably go shower and change quickly. I’ll go grab your trunk while you take a shower.” Draco climbed off the bed and went to grab Harry’s trunk and he brought it back to his room. Draco just set it on the floor when an owl flew in his room and dropped the Prophet on his bed. Draco walked over and picked it up. The headline was
“Cali, I wish for you to move Mistress Harry’s clothes from her trunk and into Master Draco’s closet, and organize them accordingly. Her dresses may stay in her wardrobe, and anything that the Dark Lord may have bought her can stay in that dresser. Anything that Miss Potter had before may go in the closet. Her undergarments may stay in the dresser as well.”
“Malfoy?” Harry questioned as he picked his glasses off the floor and put them on, bringing Malfoy into view. “What are you doing here?” Harry asked as he sagged against the stall wall.
They stayed like that for a while until they heard pounding on the door, and Draco untangled himself from Harry and stepped out of the tub, grabbing a towel to wrap around his waist as he went. He opened the door a crack to peek out and see his mother. “Mother, can I help you with something?”
“Yes, but that is not why I am here. I would like for you to send for Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, while I go and fetch Draco. We have to have a nice little chat about the future of Harry Potter.” Severus walked out of the room and down to the dungeons where he found Draco asleep on the couch in front of the fireplace. Severus shook the boy awake and as his eyes fluttered open and landed on Severus, he sat upright.
“Yes, he hates your father and there is no way that he would ever take orders from him. He is the safest option to go with because I trust him with my life, it wouldn’t be the first time either. He saved me from your father technically twice. The first time was weird because his idea of saving me was trying to hurt me to get me to leave Hogwarts, but the second time was after I tricked your father to free him, and he blasted your father down a flight of stairs after he tried to cast some form of spell at me for losing him a house elf.” Harkin explained.
“Harry, did the healer inform you what you can and can’t do, until he gives you the go.” Andromeda asked.
“I guess I’m just going to have to get used to people actually caring that something happens to me.” Harkin whispered, and Draco smiled at her before he pulled her towards Lucius’ study again. They got there, and Draco knocked on the door. Lucius whispered enter, and Draco opened the door and pulled Harkin in behind him.
“One second.” Harry said as he wrapped his fingers into Draco’s hair and pulled Draco in for a kiss locking his lips with Draco’s and then the second that Draco allowed him, Harry forced his tongue into Draco’s mouth. As abruptly as the kiss started, the kiss ended and Harry pulled away and walked out of the room, leaving Draco just standing there in shock. Harry was down the hall and almost to the dining room, when Draco finally realized that Harry was no longer standing in his room. Draco quickly left his room and hurried to the dining room so it didn’t look to weird that Harry was already there.
“A blood replenishing potion. I figured he would need it considering my condition.” He stated without looking up from Harry. Madam Pomeroy though snatched the potion out of Harry’s hands and examined it.
“That is the poison leaving his system.” Severus explained, and then continued, “Draco is trying to siphon the poison out of Harkin’s system through himself. His magic feels that Harkin and or the twins might not make it if she goes through that.” Severus stated as he pointed to Draco’s retching.
Harry couldn’t hear anything that was going on, he just sat on the floor and leaned against the door. He wondered if Draco would have done that for him or if he would have just left him to cry. Does Draco actually care about him like he cares about his mother? Yes, Draco and Harry have been through thick and thin together, but does that mean that their relationship could last through a bad break-up if it came down to it. Harry doubted it. Harry stood up and walked over to the bathroom that was off their bedroom, and he walked in, shutting and locking the door behind him. Harry leaned against the door and put his face in his hands, not sure what to do. Harry decided that he should just jump in the shower and try and not think about what was going on. Straighten his head, and he would be fine. Harry pulled out his wand and put a silencing charm and a locking charm on the room, he didn’t want to be disturbed because then his thinking would be disturbed and he would never be able to figure this out for himself.
“Since before I came out, it’s why I broke up with Ginny. Thanks for being nosy and making me say that before I even told Draco. Thanks.” Harry stood up and stormed over to the bathroom. Draco was about to follow Harry when he slammed the door, and he heard it lock.
Draco then quickly made work of his trousers, and he slipped inside her. She released a gasp as he seated completely inside her, and she sucked her bottom lip between her teeth as her eyes fluttered closed. “Mmm…Dray…” she moaned, and Draco pulled out and thrust back in, and he set a moderate pace. Harkin dug her nails into Draco’s shoulders, and her legs wrapped around his waist and legs.
“Not long, just long enough for mother to get through the place setting and seating arrangements. Aren’t I usually on Father’s left, mother?” Draco asked as he pushed off the wall and walked over to where Harkin was sitting, and he pulled her up, sat in the chair and pulled her into his lap.
Harry walked right up to Arthur and leaned up against the wall with Nagini hidden behind her and waited for Arthur to notice her. When he did his reaction was priceless. He fired a spell at her and it was absorbed into the spell Voldemort put around her to protect her.
“Good, I’m adopting him since his father is in Azkaban as well.” Narcissa said as she walked towards the door. “Sleep well, both of you.” she finished before walking out the door.
“Granger, I have invited you into my home, is that anyway to thank me for that. I could have left you outside the wards wondering if my father was torturing Harry in the dungeons or not.” Draco said as he casually looked at his nails.
“Everything will be alright. I can help you with that, darling.” Narcissa stated. “But first I think we should finish our lesson about diner etiquette, and then we can discuss your pregnancy symptoms. Alright?” Narcissa said.
“Yes, I took half an hour power naps every two hours. I couldn’t sleep knowing you were right here and something could happened to you.” Draco whispered, and she looked up at him. He started laughing, and pulled her back against him. “Yes, love. I fell asleep a little while after you. I just wake up earlier than you.”
“It is fitting I must say. What do you want to do until dinner? Draco and I normally play wizard’s chess to pass the time.” Narcissa said.
“I don’t know he just said he did. He was talking to Remus about taking the Defense position back up.”
Harry and Draco have been friends since Harry decided to accept Draco’s friendship before the sorting at Hogwarts, and Harry ended up being sorted into Slytherin during the sorting in their first year. Harry ended up not being friends with Ron because of the sorting and Ron and Hermione never became friends, though now that they are now in their sixth year everything might change for everyone.
“Okay. Let’s hurry up otherwise visiting hours will end.” The pair quickly finished their shower and changed. Harry wore just skinny jeans and a nice blouse, and Draco wore his typical black trousers with a dress shirt and tie. They walked out of Draco’s room holding hands and back to the library where he hoped his parents still were. They walked into the library, and saw them sitting at the table in front of the door. Draco and Harry walked up to them, and Draco sat down next to Narcissa and Harry sat on his lap. “Mum, can Harry and I go visit Arthur at St. Mungos? Harry wants to know how he’s doing.”
“I was going to send her on her way tomorrow for school when I sent you back to Hogwarts. I released the others for I wasn’t sure if Mr. Thomas wanted to head back to Hogwarts or not seeing as he is a muggleborn and still being hunted by the Ministry. Miss Lovegood is in a guest room in the North Wing of the house. Your room being in the South Wing I felt she was safe.” Narcissa said. “I will retrieve her.” Narcissa said as she rushed out of the room.
Harry pulled out his wand, pointed it at Narcissa and yelled, “Stupefy!” Harry then quickly pulled Draco back into the bathroom, and he locked the door and put a locking spell on the room.
“I don’t want to think about it.” Draco whispered. “I don’t want to think about you like…that.” Draco stuttered.
“You were never a problem, dragon. I enjoyed watching you grow into the man you are now, and I’m going to enjoy watching you become a great father and husband. Now go see to your fiancée, she needs you more than me.”
Harry walked back to the Gryffindor common room, and when she stepped through the portrait hole, Ron and Hermione were standing there waiting for her. “Your room now.” Hermione said. Harry did as she asked without question and she walked into her room with Ron and Hermione on her tail.
“Which one of my friends did you harm to get in here?” Harry said as he fingered his wand in his pocket.
Soon he was cumming and then he pulled out. “Mipsy!” he shouted and the house elf from before showed up. “I want you the clean her up and make her presentable for the Dark Lord. She’s going to be doing a very special task. If she tries to escape again use any means to make sure she is captured and alive.” Nott then walked out of the room, and Harry was left beaten, bruised, and bloody in the room with the small house elf. The house elf went about making a bath, and she pulled Harry over to the bath and went about cleaning her thoroughly and properly.
“Yeah, I have to go talk to Professor McGonagall.” Harry tried to get out of the bed, but Draco was quicker than she was and as she stepped out of the bed, she fell and Draco caught her.
“You see why your mother scares me now, Draco,” Harry said as he untangled his arms from around Draco, and he started walking away, when Draco caught his wrist.
“I agree. What is being done about their living situation at Hogwarts? With this bond would it really be a good idea for them to live separately.”
“I figured that might be the answer.” Harry sat down on the bed in the private room Madam Pomfrey brought him to, and she started casting spells. Harry felt like he was there for hours when he heard the door open, and Madam Pomfrey turned slightly. “I’ll see what they need dear. I’ll be right back.” She hurried from the room, and Harry could hear her talking to someone, but he couldn’t make out the words.
“Draco, it’s nothing to be ashamed of it’s a nice sized penis.” Narcissa as Draco buried his face in his hands.
“Before we go to the Ministry, can I fill out that form I wanted? The one about changing my name.” Harry asked as Severus stepped through the green flames. Lucius looked over to Harry and nodded his head.
“Someone tried to rape her, didn’t they?” Draco heard the flat sound in his voice as he couldn’t look up from the bruises all across her pale body.
“Draco, how do you know that’s what she will want? She is strong and independent, dragon. Now, just because you are bonded to her, she will always be able to think for herself.”
“I only correct the speech that matters, and that’s calling me dad and Andromeda mom. Other than that we can correct his speech when he gets older to understand the difference.”
“Fine with me.” The man walked over and picked up Andromeda, and he marched Harry out of the room. Harry obliged, and then asked, “Can I know your name? I’m curious on which Death Eater I’m going to give credit to for this when they find me dead, because that is what you plan to do, right?”
Andromeda walked back into the room, and she was about to say something, when she saw Draco and Harry. She stopped in her tracks and stared at the two of them, and she turned to Narcissa. “Cissy, are Draco and Harry… together?” She asked as she glanced back at Draco and Harry.
“She was going to figure it out eventually. I was just hoping we would be able to revile in the secrecy for a little while longer.” Draco smirked and looked at Pansy. “So, you figured it out. Took you a while longer than usual. Harry’s been out of the hospital wing since this morning, Pans.” Draco stated.
“I just don’t think I can get through it without breaking down. It’s a long story that stems from my childhood, before Hogwarts, before I found out I was a wizard.”
“I don’t know. Probably some story about me either taking advantage of you or me putting you under a sleeping spell to snuggle with your naked body, or some other nonsense most likely painting me in a bad light.” Harry started to laugh as he buried his face in Draco’s shoulder.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know why that’s so funny.” Harry said throw bouts of laughter, and everyone continued to stare. “I’m okay I swear, just give me a second.” Harry stood up and walked out of the hall and into one of the alcoves outside the Great Hall and continued to laugh, and a few minutes later, Harry felt a pair of arms around her and she spun around with her wand at their throat. She only pulled back slightly when she saw that it was Draco. “Damn it, Draco. I could have hurt you. What were you thinking?” Harry stated as she relaxed into Draco’s arms but kept her wand gripped tightly in her hand.
When Draco was finally done, Harry released him and Draco plopped down on his bed next to Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry. The pair just laid there until there was a sudden pounding on the door. The two bolted upright, and they looked from each other to the door. “Draco, what are you doing in there? Unlock this door, right now. I will blow it open if I have to,” the voice of Lucius Malfoy echoed throughout the room as the two scrambled off the bed and started pulling their clothes back on. Draco was fully clothed and Harry just had his shirt left to pull on when the door blew off its hinges, and Harry quickly pulled his shirt back on before the dust cleared.
“No, I’m hoping that’s just going to be temporary until you’re back at peak performance, but it might be permanent. It’ll be fine though body heat is easy to conduct under the right circumstances, though you’re going to have to sleep with a ton of blankets on from now on.” Draco said as he tossed the towel to the side and started drying himself off.
“I’m your second half now, Harry. You trust me naturally because no matter what happens I will always be there for you. And I am going to make sure that you are never treated like that again. You are everything to me. I will protect you with my life, you are mine, now and forever, Harry James Potter.”
“I would assume that no one told but I don’t know that for sure I just know that I didn’t and Draco and Harry most likely wouldn’t. I’m assuming that I can trust that none of you told my husband where I was.”
“Great, now that that is over I have something else to worry about. Will you tell the Ministry that Draco and I have somehow absorbed his powers?”
“What did you want to talk about, Severus?” Draco asked as he placed his hand on the table next to Harry’s unconsciously, and the three adults looked at them. “What?” he looked down to see he was aimlessly stroking Harry’s hand with his fingers.
“I couldn’t let you get punched, Dray. He is mad at me, just let him get it out of his system and he should cool off.  He has been my best friend for 5 years, I do understand him, most of the time anyway.” Harkin stated as she glanced over her shoulder for Ron to see the bruise starting to form on her face.
“Really, so one night I could totally just crawl in bed with you and fuck you, and you probably wouldn’t even notice?” Draco asked sarcastically, and Harry’s eyes widened and his fingers entangled in his hair, which Draco loved. Harry’s mouth gapped open a little, and Draco took advantage of that and leaned in capturing Harry’s lips, sliding his tongue in place. Harry sighed a little and then kissed Draco back, and he slowly slide closer to Draco. Eventually, Draco pulled Harry’s body flush with his own, their newly formed erection grinding together, causing both men to pull away from their kiss slightly with a groan. “I was kidding before. I would rather fuck you to get your reactions than to fuck you for my own person reasons.” Draco panted.
“Thank you, Remy.” Harkin stated, and she pulled away and pulled them over to the dining table. Harkin sat down next to Draco as Remus and Sirius sat down across from them.
“I believe you, dragon. Why don’t we go and get some fresh air.” Narcissa said as she slipped her arm through Draco’s, and they headed down the hall to the lobby, where they walked out the front doors onto the street. “Dragon, I know this is difficult for you. Your father was a nervous wreck the first few months after we found out I was pregnant with you. He was constantly by my side making sure I was alright. The Dark Lord was furious with your father, but your father fought his case with the Dark Lord. I honestly think those months I was pregnant with you were the only times he argued and went against the Dark Lord. He loved me, and he wanted to make sure I was alright.”
“I did it because that was not the orders he was given. He was supposed to bring you to me unharmed, and he did not. I found out because I read his mind. He was thinking about it the entire ball as he stared at the way I danced with you. Now what do you mean you dreamed it?”
“I can explain but I need one thing first and that is what you are going to go and get for me. I didn’t get all the information when I went after you, and I want to find out what I missed and there is a way that we can find that out by finding this object.”
“I don’t know, Malfoy, but I know it was you. Your bloody elf took Harry’s cloak right out of my bag. I saw her.”
“Of course not, though now I’m not sure what to talk to you about, but you are still my best friend’s baby, and I would not abandon you ever. Especially when you need me most.”
“That would be nice.” She whispered, and Draco sat up straighter and started moving his fingers numbly through her hair to start braiding her hair. They sat there like that for a while. Harkin sitting in Draco’s lap, and Draco just braiding her hair. When they were done, they laid down next to each other, and they slowly fell asleep.
“I’ll let him know. Now, get out and close the door behind you.” Draco said, and Weasley turned without thinking and walked out of the room, shutting the door behind him. Draco smiled as he watched Weasley do exactly as he said.
“Draco, if I am pregnant I am not ‘taking care of the problem.’ I’m going to keep it. With or without you or your parents.” Harry stated, and Draco just stared at her.
“It’s fine, Draco. I can’t change that. Hermione, Draco and I are…” Harry started, but then soon realized that she didn’t know how to describe her and Draco, and she stuttered. “Draco and I are…”
“How are you doing, love?” Draco asked as his fingers brushed through her hair to sooth her, and she leaned into Draco’s embrace until she felt the second wave of nausea. She covered her mouth and leaned forwards to throw up again, and Draco just kept her hair back so she didn’t get anything more in her hair. When she was finished dry heaving, she leaned back against Draco’s chest, and he wrapped his arms around her waist and held her against his chest. “Better now?” Draco asked as he stroked his fingers through her hair.
“This is not good, Mr. Potter. I don’t know if I can reverse this, but I will try.” Madam Pomfrey took Harry’s hand and pulled him down to the end of the room. “Mr. Longbottom, you may go, and please let Potter’s teachers know he won’t be returning to class or showing up today.” Neville bowed his head and walked out of the hospital wing.
“It’s a type of homing beacon, Miss Granger. Draco is the only one in the room who can find Miss Potter.” Severus said as he whisked into the room.
“Mmm… you feel so good, love.” Draco moaned, and he pulled out to push back in with a gasp. Harry reached her hands up and brushed her fingers against his chest, and Draco moaned at the touch. He took her hands, and he leaned forwards, pinning her hands above her head as he continued to thrust in and out of her heat.
“It’s alright, dragon. Mel will stay with Harry, and you’re going to stay with me in the other room, dragon. You’ll both be fine.”
“No, there is not, Mr. Malfoy. You may go, I believe Mr. Potter is to be expected awake soon, and visiting hours should be good for the next hour and a half.” He said and Draco headed towards the door.
“Well, we have to get to class. I’m sorry, Harry.” Hermione said as she walked around the bed and pulled Ron out of the hospital with her.
“Yes, we also have to do something about Mr. Potter until we take care of this problem. Take Mr. Potter to Professor McGonagall’s office. Human Transfiguration is our best option.”
“No, he saved me from his father who was literally cutting my skin from my body. Draco killed him before he could kill me.” Harry turned towards Draco and whispered, “Draco, I don’t feel so good.” Draco pulled a chair from across the room and transfigured it into a settee, and he sat down on it, pulling Harry with him. Harry relaxed into the cushions and he slowly drifted off to sleep.
Harry looked really pale, his eyes were blood shot, and he could see the bags under his eyes. Harry knew that something was wrong, but he didn’t know what. Harry was starting to feel light headed again as he walked back through the door, leaning heavily on the doorframe as someone walked in the room. Draco Malfoy? Harry asked himself.
“I tried to tell you earlier, Miss Weasley. Draco is protecting Mr. Potter. I don’t know how long it has been since he last fed, which maybe what caused this reaction.”
Harry just chuckled at that. “What you were starved and beaten because your aunt and uncle, the only family you had left, knew you were a wizard but didn’t inform you because they wanted to make sure that you didn’t become a…
“You are still being serious, Cissy. Right?” Andromeda asked and she had a confused look on her face. She tried to make sure that Narcissa was being serious or not.
“I understand. Can you fix the warming charm though, it’s kind of unbearable.” Draco picked up his wand and he flicked his wrist and the blankets stopped radiating heat, but the room was still pretty warm. “You think it’s only restricted to our room now?”
“What is going on here?” Narcissa’s voice echoed through the ballroom, and Draco looked up at his mother’s voice.
“The goblet had dreamless sleep potion in it.” Remus said as he picked up the goblet and turned towards everyone else. “He’ll wake up and feel better. Waking up from a stasis charm is hard on vampires whether or not they feed regularly or not. How are we helping Harry? I’m only assuming the stasis charm didn’t work seeing as both Harry and Draco are here.”
birthday. You are a beautiful young woman, who is bonded to an…interesting young gentleman, who you are going to be marrying in a few months and have a beautiful baby a few months later. You are going to have everything, almost everything, you ever wanted in a few months, fawn. You are perfect, no matter what you look like or what you may be doing. You are going to be a beautiful wife, and an amazing mother, no matter if that was what you originally planned with your life or not.” Sirius said as he held Harkin’s face between his hands, and he leaned forwards and kissed her forehead. “I love you, fawn, no matter what you go through, and I will be there for you. No matter what.” Sirius whispered.
“Harry…” Draco whispered, not knowing how to tell her about the spells he forgot about and her possible pregnancy.
Draco headed up to breakfast and he sat down by himself at the Slytherin table for no one was up yet, and he started loading his plate and started eating. Soon people started filing in and Draco saw the mess of red hair he didn’t want to, and it was coming right towards him. Draco was done eating anyway and he stood up and he tried to hurry out of the hall to avoid the fight that was about to ensue. Ron caught up with him as Draco was almost to the door, and he grabbed his arm and swung his arm. Draco was on the ground holding his jaw.
“Thank you, Neville.” Draco said as he patted Neville on the shoulder and rushed out of the room. He quickly ran up the staircase to the hospital wing and walked in the doors. He found Harry lying on the bed still asleep, but she looked better and less pale than the last time he saw her. Madam Pomfrey, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Dumbledore walked out of Madam Pomfrey’s office and spotted Draco standing there.
Harry looked up into Draco’s silver eyes that only seemed to have grown darker since he had last seen Draco, and he said, “I relived most of my worst nightmares and memories from as far back as I can remember to the day Sirius died. That’s where I finally cornered him and forced him out of my mind. I showed him my love for everyone that I care about and memories to show that love. Dumbledore always said love was my biggest defense against Voldemort. I guess he was right.” Harry said as he lifted himself up the best he could and kissing Draco, and Draco pushed him back against the bed and deepened the kiss.
“Well, I’m not sure how I feel about this dinner invitation, if I have to watch my goddaughter make out with her boyfriend.” Sirius joked, and Harkin pulled away from the kiss to smile at the two men as she climbed off Draco’s lap and ran to embrace the two men.
“Thank you, Remi. You’re my family, too, and I know he’s coming back, I just wish he didn’t have to leave right before Christmas.” Harkin whispered into Remus’ ear. “I should probably go home. I think Draco has been brooding for long enough.” Harkin said as she pulled away from him, and she smiled up at him.
“Wouldn’t you like to know; now leave before I step out of the shower and hex you.” Draco shouted back. They heard as she stomped out of the room, the door slamming as she left the room. Harry leaned against the shower wall, and Draco slipped his arms between Harry and the wall, one arm wrapped around Harry’s waist and the other around Harry’s hips, pulling Harry back against him. Draco delicately kissed the side of Harry’s neck, and he slowly thrust his hips forwards. Eventually, Harry leaned back in to Draco, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder and tilting his head to the side allowing Draco better access to his neck.
“Draco will handle it. I’m sure it’s just morning sickness or something. The little Malfoy will take care of her.”
” Harry said and started walking away from the man, and Harry walked until she found row 97. She knew the prophecy was in this area, but that was it. She started checking shelves until she heard a noise a few rows back the way she came, so she pulled the hood of her cloak up and tried to hide in the shadows.
“You don’t, really? I don’t really care what you think, Minister. I am surprised you are still in office really. Harry was right about you, and she has the right to be pissed at you. Now, what do you want before I lose my patients?”
“I’ve just gathered the ingredients. Snape doesn’t let me actually start putting the potion together unless someone is helping me.”
“I wasn’t sure before, but I am now. He’s ready, because he thinks he isn’t. You didn’t become a real father until you realized we, your family, needs to come first. You’d just been playing the part until then.”
Draco wanted to marry her after everything she had been through, and he wanted her safe and close by. Draco practically just proposed to her, and he wanted to live with her, and he hadn’t even seen any of her tiny quirks of the domestic kind. Harry wouldn’t have to cook or tend the gardens or clean anything again unless she wanted to, and she wouldn’t have to see the Dursley’s ever again if she so desired not too. That is when she realized she was perfectly fine with that, she loved Draco, she could spend the rest of her life with Draco. Wait, she loved Draco. Had she ever admitted that to anyone?
Harry walked down the stairs and to the kitchen and dining room to find Andromeda lying on the table. “Annie?” Harry panicked as he felt for a pulse, and found one. He sighed with relief as he looked at Teddy. “Grandma’s going to be alright.”
“And we won’t have to worry about our children not inheriting anything from us because they were born out of wedlock.” Harkin whispered.
“Oh, nothing. Just the fact that people that I have practically lived with for more than four years don’t believe I’m telling the truth, but Malfoy, who has despised me since first year, comes to tell me that he believes me and wants to help me. I just find it amazing that people that I have called an enemy for four years believes me over people I have called a friend for four years.” Harry practically shouted. Hermione and Ron took a step back, and they gave Harry a worried look. “I’m sorry, it’s just everything that’s going on and to top it off this stupid potion. Can you guys just leave and give me some time alone, please.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, dear. I guess we should have thought about you being trapped in this room by yourself. Do you want me to tear Draco away from what he’s doing for you?” Narcissa asked.
“Worst case, yes, but we can’t be certain. I don’t want to freak you out, I just want you to know all of the possibilities. You are perfectly healthy, and free to go. If you need anything I’ll be here whenever you need me, just ask for me.”
“Thank you, Healer Johnson. Everything is alright then? I’m not going to like implode or something?”
“I do as well. Thank you.” Narcissa said as the floo sounded notifying Remus of the Aurors departure. “How much did you hear?”
“I did not. She isn’t eating and taking care of our children. We both need to be at full power to help maintain each other. I had three plates when she has barely had half. I am looking out for her health, my health, and that of our children’s.” Draco argued.
“Merlin, why is it so hot in here?” Lucius stated, and that answered Draco’s question, but from the look on Severus’ face he knew the answer and he was staring at Draco and Harry.
“No, Harry, you listen. I am not going anywhere. I love you, and I’m going to have you in my life for as long as I can possible manage. You cannot change that, and you are not going to try and change that. Understand, Harry? Because every time that you start to doubt or think about leaving me, and I’m hoping that this is the last time, I will do something like this to convince you that you can’t run from your problems all the time Harry. You need to learn to face your problems head on and talk them out sometimes. This isn’t like all your other problems Harry. Defeat the bad guy and just walk away. Everything will be peachy. Not this time. You need to actually talk to me about what you are thinking, Harry, that is the only way that this is going to work. I can’t be trying to figure out what is going through your mind and deal with what is going through mine at the same time, love.” Draco spun Harry around, so he could face him. “Do you understand what I am telling you, Harry?”
Harry slowly closed his eyes as he let all of the energy drain from him, and he felt as his heart rate started to slow, but it was also getting more difficult to breath as the blood leaked into his lungs. Harry heard a fate noise as he started drifting off, there was a bang, and Harry heard voices but couldn’t make out what they were saying.
Melody sighed in relief that she didn’t know that she was holding in, and Severus looked up at her in confusion. “Harkin has a strong magical cocoon wrapped around the babies; this means that nothing can harm them unless something extremely bad happens to Harkin. Even unconscious she is pushing most of her magical energy towards the babies. It explains why she is so drained all the time. She doesn’t want anything to happen to them, so her body is making sure that nothing can happen to them. Whether she is doing this consciously or not I am not sure, but it was probably triggered by Bellatrix and the building incident. But the interesting thing about this is that the babies seem to be developing slightly faster than normal, so she might also be unintentionally helping the growth of the twins because of the amount of magical energy that she is pushing towards them.” Melody stated quite fascinated, and Severus stared at her in shock.
“Because one Draco would kill me; two she isn’t the spitting image of her father anymore and three Lily will haunt me from the grave if I hurt her pregnant daughter.” Severus stated as he stormed out of the compartment.
If you want to see the Dress when you get to the Tag with the description Red and Black Ball Gown right click and click the open in new tab for the picture to open. Sorry for some reason i cant get it to show up in the actual story chapter for some reason like i used to.
“Yes, he helped with the pain and swelling last night, but we came in to get some bruise-healing paste.” Harkin stated as she turned a little more towards Madam Pomfrey than Ginny.
“I think Lucius just wants to keep you safe until all of the Death Eaters are caught.” Remus stated, and he tried to smile to reassure her.
“Yes, I do. Do you really think that my father would do that?” Draco questioned as he glanced towards the door. “Why are we hiding in the bathroom?”
“Of course, Theo. I am honored to be your little sister.” Harkin stated and then pulled away to give Theo a kiss on the cheek. “I appreciate everything that you have done for me and Draco and especially the twins. You are going to be a fantastic uncle, Theo; I feel that would be easier on the twins to call you Uncle Theo if that is alright?” Harkin questioned, and Theo smiled with a slight chuckle.
“We don’t blame you, it wasn’t your fault.” Hermione said as she grabbed Harry’s free hand and pulled her into the room and therefore Draco since he was holding Harry’s other hand.
“I was kind of preoccupied with your fingers in places your fingers shouldn’t be, and then your cock was there and it kind of slipped my mind because I was kind of enjoying it.” Draco paused. “Is it wrong to be excited about everyone possibly hearing us have sex up here.” Draco said as he glanced up at Harry and then down at the bed.
“Maybe he did. Snape said that when Voldemort had Harry trapped in his mind he was trying to break Harry down putting him through his worst experiences and fears. If I were him, having my parents murdered in front of me would have been one of those moments even if I don’t completely remember it because I was so young. When Harry is attack by Dementors, he relives the moment his mum was murdered in front of him, and what do babies do, Professor, especially when they are unhappy.”
“I never said it wasn’t. It is just like how if Harry was still a boy she wouldn’t be able to marry Draco, but would be acceptable if Draco married a woman and saw Harry on the side.” Remus explained farther.
“Interesting, I don’t remember seeing your name on the schedule for tonight’s rounds, Mr. Weasley.” Severus stated.
“Next Saturday?” Hermione questioned, and Draco nodded. “That’s when the grand opening is.” Hermione stated.
Draco was then standing next to the potions cabinet and opened the door, and he looked through the potions until he found the one he was looking for, the blood replenishing potion. Then he was back by Harry and handing him the potion. “This is a blood replenishing potion. You will learn this potion and be able to identify this potion under any circumstance for this to work.” Draco said as he handed the potion to Harry, and he heard the doors crack open a little and Madam Pomfrey was practically running to Harry’s bed.
“Well, I guess I am to lead you to your room.” Snape said as he turned and Draco started following him with Harry in tow.
When Draco lifted his head, he turned towards Narcissa, and he asked, “When will dinner be served?” Narcissa turned towards him and glared at him.
Draco chuckled and chucked it back on the bed; he’d read it later. Draco walked to his bathroom and stripped down to nothing and stepped into the shower behind Harry.
“Now, you don’t have to worry. Just kiss me please, so I can forget about everything that happened in my head.” Harry begged, and Draco leaned down and was inches from Harry’s lips.
Remus spun Harkin around the dance floor in a few circles, making Harkin giggle until they were off the dance floor, and Remus took her hand. “Can I talk to you in private, please? Siri wanted you to have something before you got married.”
“Because I said so, Mr. Weasley. Maybe with one of his detentions you won’t go around punching people because you are angry and feel they deserve it.” McGonagall stated and then completely walked out of the room.
“Yes, I didn’t have anywhere else to put it. I’ll go and get your clothes and be right back.” Harry pulled the cloak around her and stepped from the alcove, and she walked over to the table her and Draco were at before, and she picked up Draco’s trousers, pants, and vest, and her panties. She walked back to the alcove and pulled her cloak off and gave Draco his clothes.
“Magic, dear. Everything in this room has an accelerated blooming. Each plant has their own cycle, unique in and of themselves anything that can be harvested and sold. The profits going into the Malfoy vaults.”
“The day I got back from break, or well the day after I guess. When she woke up, it was a heat of the moment thing. I didn’t plan it. I wanted to court her, like dad did with you.” Draco stated, and Narcissa chuckled.
“Yes, please.” Harkin stated with a small sigh, and Draco grabbed their bags before they started walking out of the room. They walked back down to the hospital wing, and when they walked inside Madam Pomfrey was attending to a redhead at the end of the room, which made Harkin stop dead in her tracks. Ron had glanced up at the sound of the door opening, and he immediately glanced away at seeing Harkin and Draco. Draco had a confused look on his face, which Harkin saw, and she realized that Draco didn’t do this to him, but if Draco didn’t who did. The answer was given as they got closer and heard Ginny screaming at him from across the room, which made Harkin blush with laughter. The sound that escaped Harkin’s lips made Ginny shut up as she glanced up and saw the group coming towards them.
“Alright, well, I should be leaving with all I have to do. Harry will you inform Narcissa I may be late to dinner tonight. I will try and be back, but I am not sure.”
“No, I think we will talk about what you and your mother can give us if we were to help you out. I mean if you want my protection you have to give me some information that I can use.” Harry brushed her finger along the outline of Malfoy’s erection.
“Where’s Harry, Mum? Is she alright?” Draco asked as he tried to get back up again, but Narcissa placed her hands on his shoulders and pushed him back against the bed.
“Try telling that to my sister, who thinks no one will love her.” Daphne said before standing up and storming out of the Great Hall.
“What did you say to him? I don’t think I have ever seen anyone talk Draco down from the verge of tantrum.” Severus said as he walked into the room.
“Nothing, just this book I was looking for in the library, and Harkin wanted to know about this old family tree book, and see if we could find some Potters.” Draco stated smoothly, and Harkin had to admit was a pretty smooth answer, had he been holding a book.
Harry turned his head to the side and looked at Madam Pomfrey, and said, “Can he at least finish what he was doing?” he moaned, and he glanced at Draco and their eyes met. They stared at each other while Harry wanked under the sheets, and Draco’s finger dug into the wall behind him as he smelled Harry come closer and closer to finishing himself. He heard a moan escape from somewhere and realized it was from himself, and the pair just kept eye contact the whole time.
Harry pulled his fingers out of Draco rather harshly and he pulled Draco’s legs up around his shoulders and lodged his erection inside of Draco, causing Draco to scream out. “Harry! My god, keep going.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and pulled them forwards, and Harry screamed as Draco thrusted Harry’s erection into himself. Harry took that notion and started thrusting himself into Draco; Draco letting out a small groan as each thrust went into him.
“I want to thank you for inviting us over for dinner. I understand that you didn’t have to, and that you didn’t have to want to get to know Harry’s messed up little family. I know Siri and I aren’t technically Harry’s real family, but we are what she has and are considered her family even if we aren’t.” Remus rambled, and Harkin giggled.
“Let’s get some food in you and then take you to your healer appointment.” Narcissa said as she helped them up. They started walking out of the garden when a house elf appeared in front of them.
Both Theo and Hermione, being two of the top students in their year, helped Harkin catch up on the homework and lessons that she missed while in Voldemort’s custody. Harkin missed Hermione while she was gone, and it was still a little weird not having Ron around, but he was being weird ever since the potion incident and even more so after the Malfoy’s Christmas Party. He found out she was pregnant, and he’s been avoiding her a little bit ever since. Fred and George though picked up his slack and visit at least every other day; they love watching the twins’ sonograms. Harkin feels like they are going to be the biggest spoilers of her twins except Narcissa. The Twins came over so often that Melody had to teach Hermione the spell for the sonogram.
“They what? When and how did that happen? And why wouldn’t mother tell me at least? I could have been more careful, more observant.” Draco tried, but he seemed to break down.
“Safe for now. He’s part of the something I can’t talk about. Well, Ron and I need to get started on figuring out where the thing we need to find is. If you want to see Harry try talking to Professor Snape. He knows where he is. We’ll talk to you later, Professor.” Hermione said as she took Ron’s hand and pulled him towards the Gryffindor table. McGonagall reached for Hermione’s hand.
“Andromeda said that she had a discussion with him on this a couple weeks ago, about how he shouldn’t necessarily do it for himself to start out with, but that he should do it for Teddy, so when Teddy goes to school and if he decides he wants to drop out for some reason that he can’t use it against Harry. Saying that why should he finish if Harry didn’t technically finish, but I think that Harry really does want to finish and is going to love the fact that he decided to come back this year.”
“Yes, that is how it would work, but how would Draco react when he wakes up and Harry isn’t there?” Snape asked.
“You have never seen the effects of the Imperius curse up close, Ron. I have, and too many times for my liking. Their eyes have a sort of glazy haze to them, Ron. What is the point of this? You didn’t need to do this to your sister to get me to talk to you. So, obviously that isn’t what your plan is, so please just talk to me. What I said yesterday and this morning, I meant it. I would still like to have my best friend back. Things would have to be slightly different, but what is going on?” Harkin tried as she did her best to coax her best friend back out.
“Well, there was the first problem with the Unbreakable Vow I had with Narcissa to do so when Draco could not, and that matter that he asked me to kill him. He was going to be gone within a few months of his death anyway. I contained the spell that was killing him, but it wasn’t going to last forever.”
“Alright.” Harry turned to Hermione, and she looked like she wanted to say something. “Hermione, what is it?”
“Ronald. This is your best friend. How can you say that to her?” Hermione said as she turned towards Ron.
“I’m going to fix you, love. You just need to hold on just a little longer, love, so I can make the potion you need to get better. I love you, just hold on.” Draco said as he kissed her flaming skin, and he stood up and walked out of the room and down to the drawing room Voldemort has taken to settling in after the incident. Draco slammed the door open, breaking all the wards that Voldemort placed around the room so no one could enter, and he marched up to the snake and said, “I need your snake, and I need it now. If you don’t give it to me, I’ll kill it right now to get what I need.” Draco stated with no stutter or flinch when Voldemort stood up and stepped towards him. Draco didn’t even stop staring the man down as he stared into his eyes. “Try Legilimens on me and you’ll regret it old man. I’ll deal with you later.”
“How many plants are in here?” Harry asked as they walked past some plants she recognized from Herbology.
“No, I told no one. It was a sudden thing and the only people that knew are in this room. My husband didn’t even know that I would come here. No one in my family besides myself even knew where Andromeda lived let alone that I would come here.”
“Are you saying you’ve always felt this way about me, Draco?” Harry said, and she emphasized Draco as she said it. Draco moaned, and he rested his forehead against Harry’s shoulder. “Draco?” Harry questioned, and Draco moaned again.
“He’s been better, but now that Voldemort is gone he can stay with me and not have to worry about working. I’m just glad you got your mother’s hair. Your father’s was always unruly and untamable.”
“I would very much appreciate it if you didn’t probe my mind with Legilimens. I would possibly be able to trust you better if you trust me, because I don’t see it going any other way. Now, I will tell you this up front, I don’t agree with your mission one bit, but if I’m one of your Horcruxes as you call them, and I’m not exactly sure what that means, but if it means that I have to die for you to die, which I’m not too fond of, I don’t like it. You can treat me like a princess all you want but that won’t make me like you or what you are doing. My mother was muggleborn, and I don’t appreciate your viewpoint on them or half-bloods considering I’m a half-blood obviously. That being said you can say what you want.” Harry said with a smile.
Harry woke up in St. Mungos with a lot of pain in his chest and just all over, causing him to groan. He felt presser on his hand, which made him open his eyes. All he saw was a blurry blob, and he blinked trying to regain focus, when he realized he didn’t have his glasses on. “Glasses?” Harry tried but his voice didn’t work. He started to freak out a little when his glasses were pushed on his face and the person came into view.
Harry stepped out of the nook and said, “What do you have a tracking charm on me, Malfoy?” kind of joking and being serious at the same time.
“Mum is winning.” Draco said as he brushed some of Harry’s hair behind her ear, and he kissed her temple. “How did it go with the Minister?” Draco asked without looking up from the game.
“Because he’s your legal guardian now, and when you just disappeared, Father called him.” Draco stated.
“I can’t guarantee that, but if it is possible I will do my best to try and keep that promise. I can’t guarantee it because I don’t know who is going to be around and obstacles that may be there.”
“I’m not sure. They are planning something, I don’t know what it is or when it will happen, but I know it involves Harry and the Department of Mysteries, but in know that after that happens I want her out, if not before. I just don’t know what is happening to get an exact date. I only assume you have inner intel since you claim you know all the information I have, maybe you can talk to them about when might be the best time, I just wish to know when you plan on acting.”
“Harry?” Draco forgot about Lupin and he was gone, he was standing in the doorway to his room staring at Harry. “Harry?” he questioned again.
Draco slowly peeled Harry’s fingers off from around his wrist and watched as his fingers tried to grip something in comfort before Draco entwined his fingers with Harry’s and they relaxed. Draco held that hand to his chest as he wrapped his other arm around Harry. He watched Harry sleep until his eyes finally drooped closed.
“Which brings me back to the reason why I don’t like you. Funny how this conversation is going around in circles, isn’t it?”
“Malfoy.” Ron mutters, and then Ron froze, Harkin assumed as Severus finished climbing up the steps.
“Upstairs getting ready for bed. She’s not coming back down. She wanted to apologize for not saying good night or good bye, but she’s not feeling well. So we are just going to bed. Good night, and don’t drink too much.” Draco said as he turned to leave, but Remus grabbed his wrist.
“I don’t need any information from you, Draco to help you, and I don’t need you to put your mother’s and your own life in danger if you do so. I will help you and your mother but I don’t need the information you want to give, because I already have more information than you could give me.” Draco’s mind was spinning, and he didn’t know how he could have any of the information that Draco could have to offer.
“So, it doesn’t mean that I knew that you knew, Zabini.” Harry stated as he glared back at Blaise. Blaise looked at Harry and raised his eyebrow.
Lucius just stood there though as Nott reach over and brushed his finger against Harry’s cheek, and Harry tried to get away, but she was stuck where she was at.
“Draco, what about your parents?” Draco knew exactly what Harry meant so he pulled out his wand and pointed it at the door locking it and then silencing it. He then did the same with the other door in the room. Draco looked down at Harry and was about to say something, but before the words could escape his mouth Harry pulled him back down and was kissing him again, which definitely answered Draco’s question.
“I think I’m sick of waiting for Ron to come around, Hermione. Something happens and his faith in our friendship is shaken and he runs. I’m sick of waiting for him to come around and realize I was in danger and right all along.”
“Are you sure, because you aren’t going to get anything until lunch if you don’t. You boys should eat something, and you shouldn’t wait until lunch,” Narcissa shouted back through the door. “Can I come in and talk to you boys, because I really don’t like yelling through the door?”
“You’re acting really strange.” Harry said as she pulled her wand and started thinking of a happy memory to send to Ron, Hermione and Draco. If this man was Draco it would appear here.
Harry’s eyes grew very wide at the sight of Tonks holding her wand to his face. “What the hell is going on?” Harry screamed as he struggled to get away, but Tonks held him tight. “Let go of me. Dray, Narcissa, what’s going on?” Harry directed in their general direction.
“Please, tell me this isn’t your first time with a man, Potter.” Draco asked as Harry’s hand slipped inside the back of Draco’s trousers, his finger teasing at Draco’s entrance.
“Well, I think this turned out better than I thought it did,” Harry said as he admired the room from the doorway.
“Yes, Minerva. He is tied to Draco’s life force and vice versa. If Draco dies Mr. Potter dies. If Mr. Potter dies Draco dies. If Draco lives Mr. Potter lives. If Mr. Potter lives Draco lives. Anything that happens to Mr. Potter happens to Draco, and lastly if anything happens to Draco it happens to Mr. Potter.” Severus stated. “Though there bond is rare because Draco can live without just having to drink from Mr. Potter to survive if he wishes.”
“I’m an excellent potions student.” Draco stated. “I actually made some of the stash in the cabinet. Plus I can read my own handwriting.” Draco finished.
Draco stared at her, and didn’t know what to say. She was beautiful. “What? Is it bad?” Harry asked as she stepped closer to Draco. “Because I can change into another one if you don’t like it.”
“I didn’t just do it for Teddy. I did it for me. Ginny and I had our relationship while the war was going on, and I don’t know what to do now that it’s over. I’m not the same person that I was before. I don’t know who I am anymore. I needed to find myself again and I couldn’t do that with Ginny because I’ll keep trying to be the person that I was before the war, and I’m not that person. I couldn’t tell her that though, because Ginny wouldn’t take that, and she would keep trying. I told her that I wanted to raise Teddy right, and I couldn’t do that while I was still in a relationship with her while she was in school. In reality it was because I couldn’t live in the past anymore and opened my eyes to new possibilities. Like you.” Harry said not looking at Draco but still playing with his hair.
“Really, that is hard to believe. I kind of feel bad about taking advantage of you. You’ve never experienced anything sex related until today.”
I'm going to apologize for the late post. I'm posting three different stories at once, and continuing those three at the same time so I'm going to apologize in advance for all the late postings. I hope you enjoy this last chapter I know I did. Please let me know your thoughts, it's very much appreciated.
“I will tell you what you are going to do. You are going to tell him you will go with him and leave the rest up to me. My mother is a genius when it comes to wardrobes, your bridesmaid fitting is next Saturday by the way.” Draco stated, and Hermione gave him a look. “Mother knows about most things, but she can size up a woman with one glance, she just likes to make sure.” Draco stated.
“Well, I have a theory. Because Draco’s and my cores are intertwined you are feeling the familiarity of Draco’s magic core. Mothers are more intoned to their child’s magical core because they lived with it inside them for nine months or so. It is also why children are closer to their mother’s more often than their fathers.” Harkin stated, and Narcissa just stared at her.
“Harry, do you and Draco want any breakfast? Since you two didn’t have time to eat before we left. So did you want to eat something or not?”
“Dray…” he heard her mutter into the side of his neck. Draco turned his attention back to Harry, but heard as his mother stood and walked out of the room and shut the door.
“Harry, we’ll talk to McGonagall, she could send a letter to them and I’m sure if Sirius and Remus care about you they’ll understand, they’re from magic, right?” Harry just stared laughing at that and she couldn’t stop. “What’s so funny?” Draco asked with a chuckle.
“So, it is still possible for him to lose all memory of Hogwarts, and me and the war and the truth?” Granger asked
“Yeah, what are they calling you now. Harmony?” Harry looked up to see Pansy Parkinson standing with her arms crossed leaning up against the wall.
Harry screams as he twists his legs just right snapping Rodolphus’ neck. Harry released him, and he sagged to the floor. Harry dangled from the chains as the pain in his chest coursed through him, and Harry glanced down to see the sword piercing out of his chest, and Harry could start to taste blood in his mouth. Harry tried to break the chains, but all of his energy was draining from him, so he stopped struggling and just decided to hang there and wait for the Aurors to find him, hoping it didn’t take them forever.
i want to apologize to anyone who may have read this chapter already but i had a chapter mix up. so i'll be posting four and five together incase anyone has already read the chapter. again sorry i thought i was farther than i actually was. i hope you enjoy this chapter.
“I would very much not like you to bring your mother up just as we’re about to have sex it kind of kills the mood we were setting.” Harry whispered, and she watched Draco’s eyes widen and then blow out with lust. “That’s my boy.” Harry pulled him back down to kiss him, and he slipped his tongue inside her mouth, and Harry moaned around the organ causing Draco to stutter. Harry could tell Draco was losing his mind as she moaned underneath him, and she slipped her hands down his back and pulled his dress shirt from yesterday that they never changed out of and pulled it from his trousers slowly unbuttoning the buttons on the shirt as Draco attached his lips to her neck and started sucking and nipping at the skin right below her ear.
“I am uncertain, Mr. Potter. We will just have to see. Those ingredients are hard to figure on if they will cooperate especially in the concentrations that they were in. If I do not figure it out today, I will owl some colleagues of mine that may be able to help. But I don’t want to give you any hope that this will be reversed, it might very well not be.”
“Ah, Thaddeus, thank you for escorting Miss Potter here. I have a room set up all for you, and I feel you are going to enjoy the wardrobe I have for you. It’s a bit old fashioned, but I feel it’ll suit your new appearance.” Voldemort said with a chuckle, and Harry rolled her eyes as she was shoved into the house. Voldemort took her arm, and she flinched. “I am hosting a ball with all my Death Eaters in celebration of your change of sides.”
“I’ll love you until you don’t want me anymore and then probably even after that.” Harry chuckled, and Draco pulled him closer. They both glanced over at the door when they heard the door slam closed, and Harry looked back at Draco and whispered, “Ginny.”
“Draco, what are you do…Merlin, Draco, you could have just told me to leave? Who’s the lucky bloke?” Pansy shouted through the door.
“Not that I cared about that.” Draco chuckled. “But it will be nice to not have the twins jealous of their younger siblings.” Draco smiled as his hand rested on her belly rubbing circles with his thumb.
“Wait, I do have some questions about this incident first. You didn’t tell anyone that you were coming here did you, or that you were leaving your husband at all. Correct?”
“Yes, Potter, Granger and Weasley won’t be bunking with each other. Good day, Potter. I’ll see you on the first day of school.”
“I understand, Mr. Malfoy. The healer should be here in a few minute, Professor McGonagall has to clear them and give them access to only the path from her office to this ward and back.” Draco walked back over to Harry and sat on the bed, where Harry had fallen back asleep. Madam Pomfrey followed him, and she stopped once her eyes landed on Harry. “Mr. Malfoy, you might have under exaggerated his condition.”
“Yeah, Ron. I’m a girl, and if you try and get in my knickers I will punch you in the face, because you are my best mate. Understand, Ron?”
“Go ahead, and not throw the party. What will that say about you, Minister? That you are still stuck in your old ways and that you fear you’ll lose your job to a 15 year old girl. She is more of a leader than you ever will, and she’s been through a hell of a lot worse, Minister. I don’t think she would mind one bit if you throw the party or not, but think about all of the people in the Ministry that will think something is wrong if you don’t. How many supporters will you lose then, Minister? Then how long will it be before they replace you?” Draco stated, and he turned and walked out of the room to go and find Harry.
“Girl. Harry’s permanently a girl now. Pomfrey even said so.” Draco stated as Severus said, “You know why, Albus, but that isn’t why we are here. Tell everyone or I will.”
“Yes, sir.” Draco whispered and walked over to Neville. He sat down and pulled out his book turning to the page written on the board. “Here are you at, Neville.”
“Yes, I think I’ll survive; I’m not so sure about Draco, though.” Harry joked, and Narcissa started laughing this musical laugh.
“Are you going to fight me?” Ron questioned. “You don’ have it in you. I have known you for years, Harry, and you never want to purposely hurt someone even if they are your enemy.” Ron stated as he took a shy step backwards.
Draco turned and hugged Harry and whispered in her ear, “Just go with it.” Harry hugged him back and as he pulled away he swung her bag over his shoulder and placed it on her shoulders. Draco stepped back and said, “I’ll talk to you later.” His smirk spread across his face making Harry blush, and they both turned on their heels and walked in opposite directions to their own tables.
“In other words, I would be their science experiment. I’d rather not be a science experiment, Madam Pomfrey.” Harry stated and then turned to look at Draco and asked, “Did you bring me a change of clothes?” Draco rolled his eyes, and he reached into his bag and pulled out a neatly folded stack of clothes, and he handed it to her. Harry smiled, and she climbed off Draco’s lap and the bed and stepped over to the bed next to hers and she closed the curtains while she changed into her school uniform.
Draco led Harry into their room and to his bed, pushing Harry down onto it. Draco crawled onto the bed and straddled Harry’s hips, and he placed his hands on either side of Harry’s head leaning down and kissed Harry. Harry’s one hand reached up cupping the side of Draco’s face, and his other hand ran down Draco’s back and found his wand pulling it out and casting a locking and silencing charm on the door. Draco pulled away a little bit and looked into Harry’s eyes.
“Yes. It seems that when we got caught up in sex we were having, I forgot about some protection spells. Spells to prevent pregnancy, and my mother is worried about you being pregnant. So she’s making an appointment to see if you are and to take care of the problem if you are and if you aren’t she wants to see if our doctor can see if you can get pregnant.”
“That is where the misconception is wrong Septima, he is indeed still here, and in fact he is in this room as we speak. Mr. Potter has since been trapped inside his own mind. I just hope that he can find his way out. Now, this does bring me to the reason I have brought us here. The Dark Lord has been able to preserve his soul in the absence of his body in the use of Horcruxes.” Everyone gasped at the notion. “Yes, as a matter of fact he had seven, but thanks to Mr. Potter, his friends, and Albus, there is only one left, and I believe Miss Lovegood can help us in the recovery of the object in question. Miss Lovegood if you please.”
“Was using. Harkin broke them.” Draco said as Harkin’s screams rebounded through his skull, causing him to scream.
“Well, I’m sorry to cut this reunion short, but Miss Lovegood needs to get back to Ravenclaw common room as do you, Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley. Your usual rooms are waiting for you.”
“What? N-no, that…that isn’t what it is. I-it’s just…” Harkin whispered as she burst into light sobs, and the entire room was staring at her. No one moved until Narcissa huffed and moved around the table, and she pulled her soon to be daughter-in-law into her arms.
Draco woke up in his bed with his sheets pulled up around him, and he looked around the room to find it empty. He tried to sit up, but he felt a pain in his entire body. He grunted out in pain as he tried to get out of bed so he could go and find Harry. He stopped as the door burst open and his mother was at his side trying to get him back in bed. “My dragon, calm down. You are fine, you just have to heal. Everything is fine, my dragon.” Narcissa said.
Harry felt his lips against her neck, and she moaned at the touch as his fingers wound into her hair, pulling her head back to access her neck better. Harry moaned again, and Draco rolled them to the side so he was on top of her. “Mmm…Dray.” Harry moaned as she fed her fingers into his hair, and Draco continued ravishing her neck as he had one hand pinned under Harry’s lower back and the other was entangled in her hair at the back of her head. Draco rolled his hips accidently pressing his budge to Harry’s thigh causing him to moan and her to gasp. “Ah…Dray.” Harry moaned as Draco slid his hand on her lower back into her pajama bottoms grasping her ass. Harry gasped again and her hands briefly tightened in his hair.
“Because knowing you are famous and actually witnessing it are two different things, raven.” Draco explained. “Ronald is the last son of 6 before the coveted daughter, and he finally had a friend that was his, someone he didn’t have to be jealous of because you were his, and the adventures that you went on the first two years were fun and something you did together, and third year happened and you had your godfather after you, so he wanted to protect you. Then fourth year happened, and your name came out of the goblet of fire. Your enemies coming to get you, though everyone saw it as Harry Potter getting away with breaking the rules again, only this time Ronald wasn’t involved, you did this without him. Now he is jealous of your fame and the capability that he can now see of you moving away from him. Then Voldemort came back, but you were the only surviving witness to the horror of his return, and how does ones friend cope with the growing attention your best friend is now getting, attention that you aren’t receiving as well. He pushed you away, because now you are better than him.” Draco stated, and Harkin gave him a questioning look.
“Siri, I’m so glad you decided to come back. Remy, it is so good to see you. I missed you so much.” She whispered, and the two men hugged her back.
“Yeah, we’ll see.” Harry pulled back and he saw Hermione roll her eyes at them they watched the sorting ceremony come to an end, and Professor McGonagall stand.
“No, I am, but since we weren’t having sex three weeks ago that shouldn’t be possible. Time for answers, Uncle Sev.”
“Aren’t you coming with? Or are you waiting for everyone to leave so the two of you can have a make out session before bed?” Pansy teased.
“My guess is Harry is reliving his mother’s murder, and probably over and over again because Voldemort is a sick bastard.” Hermione said, and then turned around. “Let’s find this thing so we can help Harry.” Hermione walked away and McGonagall started looking through everything around her and slowly made her way through the stacks of junk that people have discarded in this room over the years. She reached the Vanishing Cabinet the Draco used last year to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and she saw Hermione standing under this cabinet down the way and she saw the Diadem sitting on top of this ugly manikin wearing a wig.
“Alright, what do you need me to do?” He pulled her over to the couch, and he started explaining the plan. Soon it was almost sunset, and Voldemort looked out the window and saw what time it was.
“I don’t know how far I drained him but he probably would have been dead in a minute or two if my mother hadn’t walked in when she did. I heard her voice, the fear, and I looked up at her, and then down at Harry and I couldn’t believe I’d done it. My mother was going to try and help me as long as I didn’t feed I would have been fine. I shattered her dream of having her son alright in the time she left and came back to find me draped over him. I could have killed him, I never wanted him dead, but I was so thirsty.” Draco wrapped his arms around himself as he spoke trying to comfort himself, but it didn’t work, until he felt his mother’s arms around him.
“It’s not, but we both know, or should know, that Draco would have taken care of that child whether Draco was the biological father or not.”
“Draco? If you don’t want to be friends with me anymore that’s fine I completely understand. It happens all the time once people meet my family and that I’m practically a slave in my own house.” The disappointment dribbled out of Harry’s mouth like he had made this statement on several occasions, but Draco just looked at him dumbstruck.
“I know, and I hope that we can straighten this out for you so you do remember, Harry. Just give it time, alright?”
“But will the baby. It’s mine, no matter how I became the father, it’s still mine, mum.” Draco muttered.
“I can’t be certain, because this bond between you two isn’t a normal bond; it I something new something no one knows about. This could be the outcome or it could be better, but it could also be worse. Best case, your magic unravels after one dies and you live the rest of your life without any problems. Worst case, you die instantly upon the other’s death.”
“I have an appointment at one with her. I don’t think she’ll mind if we’re here early because it is an emergency. My girlfriend passed out.” Draco stated, and Narcissa walked up and placed her hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco just started up the staircase when he heard her moan his name, just his name. He smirked and whispered, “I’m right here, love.” He quickened his pace and finally reached the hospital wing doors, and he gently pushed them open. “Madam Pomfrey, I need your assistance, please.” Draco said down the hall.
Draco walked through the front door and stood in front of a stair case and a hallway that ran parallel to each other. “Draco, you can take Harry up to the room on the second landing first door on the left.” Draco followed Sirius’ instructions, and opened the door to find their trunks already in the room for them. Draco set Harry down on the only bed in the room, and Draco wondered if Sirius knew about him and Harry, or not. Draco pulled the covers over Harry and then he laid down on the bed next to Harry, and he must have fallen asleep.
“Ow. What the hell, Snape?” Harry snapped and the white dress started blowing around her along with her hair, and everyone was staring at her. “Seriously, I want answers. What the hell did you do to Draco and me? Why did you do it? What did you think was going to happen? And anything else that might come to that greasy head of yours.” Harry shouted with her magic just bellowing off of her in waves. Draco stood up and wrapped his arms around Harry, and she calmed down a tad. Draco could tell she was still seething.
“I already ordered a custom made engagement ring for Harry, Mum. It’ll be here for Christmas.” Draco stated.
“I don’t care. I’m not going to hide away while someone is after me. I didn’t do it with Voldemort after I watched him kill Cedric I’m not going to do it now either. I’ve faced worse at this school than a little beat down. I’ve actually had more of those with Draco than I have faced Voldemort here. I can handle students.” Harry said.
Harry laughed a little before she reached out and shut his mouth with her hand, saying, “Ronald, you are staring, with your mouth open while you have food in your mouth, it’s rather unattractive.” She let her hand rest there for a little while before pulling her hand back as he nodded his head and turned back to his food. Harry turned to her plate and started eating, and Harry thought about the class she missed that morning and turned to Hermione. “What did Binns teach in History of Magic today?” she asked, and Hermione finally turned her attention away from and looked at Harry.
“Well, we’re heading back to the Manor, Sirius, if you wish to join us for dinner. Both you and Remus, or anyone else is invited, if you wish to join.” Narcissa offered, and Sirius looked over to see her, Lucius, and Severus standing by the door.
“Can you allow them access? They won’t stop until they know I’m alright.” Harry said as he turned slightly in Draco’s arms to look at him.
“I appreciate that but I should get back to headquarters to take care of Sirius’ things, and take care of the remainder of order business.” Remus stated, and Harkin turned to stare at him with her tear stained face.
“You saw my aunt post balloon?” Harry smiled. “Did she shrink any from before she was a balloon, or was she still rather big?” Harry asked.
She caught Dumbledore’s eye, and she smirked before she started running. She ran through the door and the first room she was in started spinning as the door closed behind her. She turned about as the room slid to a halt. “Out… Exit… Leave… Door…” Harry started panicking as she didn’t know how to find the door that left this room and went back into the rest of the Ministry. Harry jumped when a door flew open and revealed Lucius. “Thank, Merlin. I was starting to freak out. I didn’t know how to get out and Dumbledore is right behind me.”
“When Draco was a baby, I used to bring him in here when I tended to the flowers. When I was done I’d b ring him in here and sit down in this window seat and read to him. Most of the time he would fall asleep on my chest, but I’d continue reading. Did you know that babies can absorb information in their sleep? I didn’t not then anyway, so I read him anything and everything from romance novels to research books in the library.
“Well, Neville said that not many people notice what he is doing but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t notice them. He said that he has noticed a similar look upon my face at times, which I do not deny, I probably have. But I know Blaise, and I don’t think I would put it passed him to try something on Harry, especially now that he’s a woman. I’m also not saying that he had something to do with this attack but he might try something else. I can’t be completely sure until he either confesses or is caught.”
“Wait, so you’re carrying Draco’s baby and Nott’s younger sibling? Two separate babies.” Hermione questioned.
“That is a good question, Mel, one I do not have at this moment. Poppy, can you stabilize Mr. Malfoy, please. We are going to need him in as good of condition as possible to even think about saving Harkin and the twins.” Severus stated, and Madam Pomfrey immediately hurried over to Draco and started casting spells on him to stabilize and heal him, while Melody and Severus did everything, they could to help Harkin and the twins. Severus started casting healing charms on Harkin while Melody started checking on the twins and trying to stabilize the magic Harkin had webbed around the twins. Melody was actually surprised at the amount a magic she had webbed around them to protect them at all cost; she had such strong magic around them that nothing could probably get at these two babies until they were ready to come out.
“And I think you’re missing mine.” Draco stated after a long moment of panting and silence. Harry pulled back completely, and looked Draco in the eyes.
“I don’t know.” Harry said as her brows furrowed together. “I’m not very good at chess. Ron tried to teach me when I first came into the wizarding world, but he gave up after our second year.” Harry explained.
“I never thought you did, my dear. I just want you to know that I support you no matter what the results of your exam are this afternoon.” Narcissa said, and Harry rested her head on Narcissa’s shoulder.
“Wrong, Draco. But he’s in here. Potter has some fire that I might be able to use to get what I want,” Voldemort tilted his head to the side in a manner that was really not something that Harry would do, and he smirked. “Thank you for exploiting your relationship with him to me though, Draco. Now I can use you and Potter to get to what I want and under rocks that I couldn’t before. Especially seeing as neither of you informed anyone the danger that Potter was in, and that I am now using him as a puppet for my own bidding. Vampirism suits you, Draco. A beautiful specimen.” Voldemort said as he lifted his hand and stroked Draco’s jaw with his finger. Draco’s eyes fluttered as Harry’s skin touched his own. “I feel like him don’t I, Draco? I could probably get you to kill Severus for me right now and you wouldn’t be able to see the wrong in it until afterwards.”
“I don’t know, why don’t you ask Draco? I just came up here because the whole dorm is really warm, and I tracked the magic in here. I’m going to let Draco explain. I love you, Harry. Feel better.” Hermione stood up and walked out of the room, and Harry turned so he was facing Draco.
“No, it is fine. I understand that was something you had to do, so you didn’t have to worry about it later. You have to fix what your father messed up. Unfortunately.”
“I’m dead I have to find joy somewhere.” Draco murmured as he took the potion out of her hands and placed it back in Harry’s. “Drink.” Draco instructed, and Harry uncorked the bottle and downed it, and then he handed the bottle back to Draco.
“Go away. Why do you care now? No one has before.” Snape closed the distance and kneeled in front of her and placed his hands on either side of her face and he dived into her mind. He saw every injury Harry had been caused all the way back to the first broken arm Dudley gave him at age 4. He pulled away and stared at Harry.
Narcissa planned their holiday that they were going to take, and she spent the next two weeks trying to plan a new holiday that Lucius wouldn’t be able to find them. They were going to take this holiday for the rest of the boys’ summer holiday. She was planning it to get the boys out of the country until their next term started, because she wanted them to forget the events that happened at the Manor, and she wanted it to be impossible for Lucius to find them until the boys were safe at school. Narcissa wanted her boys to be safe and that was all that she cared about at that point.
Harry had a feeling she knew what was going to happen, and she let the tears fall. “Oh, don’t do that, you’ll mess up your beautiful face.” Nott said as he whipped the tears away. “I’m just going to have a little fun, before the Dark Lord takes my toy away. What Theo doesn’t know won’t kill him, and you won’t tell him or you’ll face worse.” Harry closed her eyes and hoped that someone was going to come and save her, but she doesn’t even know if her Patronus was sent and if anyone even noticed she was missing. She was suddenly cold, and she heard a small sob escape her throat and turned her head away. Nott though didn’t like that, and he grabbed her chin and turned her face back towards him as he straddled her waist. She could feel his clothed budge pushing against the inside of her thigh.
“No, need Severus, we are here. What is going on? And why is Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy unconscious on the floor of my office?”
“Hey, Kiddo. Do you want something for breakfast?” the little boy wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. “What’s the matter, kiddo?” Harry asked as he picked up his wand and slipped it into his pajama pocket. He walked out of the room and across the hall to Andromeda’s room. “Hey, Annie. I’m going to make breakfast, are you up yet?” Harry asked as he knocked on the door, but there was no answer. “Annie?” Harry tried again, but there was still no answer. She was never up before Teddy and Harry, so Harry opened the door to find the room empty.
“Yes. We couldn’t do anything for her except make her comfortable, and then Draco created a miracle.” Narcissa stated as she stared proudly at her son.
“Yeah, because that is so easy. How do you expect me to do that when you can’t even do that?” Harry asked as she turned around to face the door again.
“Oh, my sweet boy. If you think your father and I didn’t have sex before we were married. You’re more precious than ever.” She said as she caressed his cheek. “We are taking her to our healer, and having her checked out, and then I want her on conception potions. Understood?”
“Trust me, Remy. He’s got her. She’s in good hands here.” Sirius said as he stood and pulled the other man against his chest.
“No, I do it’s just I’m not packed or ready to go yet, because I wasn’t expecting you for another two weeks, Draco. I also don’t want you to meet them,” Harry stated as someone yelled from the other room.
bedroom. Anytime Harry did accidental magic he was called a freak and locked in his cupboard with no food or water. Then he found out that he was a wizard, and everything got worse, and then this accident.” Draco said as he brushed Harkin’s hair behind her ear. “And she just thinks that she’s a freak, and with everything, she’s unsure of herself and everyone around her.” Draco stated, and everyone in the room turned towards her. The first one to move was Sirius, and he was around the table in a moment and had her pulled into his arms before Narcissa could even move.
“Harry, calm down. Everything is going to be alright. Okay? We’ll just keep it a secret for now, and when we think it will be alright to start telling people we will alright?” Harry didn’t say anything at first he just tried to process what Draco had said, but was pulled out of his thought process when Draco said, “Okay, Harry?”
“We couldn’t wait. Something is wrong with Harry.” Narcissa said as she tossed the floo powder in, and Draco picked Harry up and walked through the floo. Narcissa, Lucius, and Severus followed right after, and they ended up in the lobby at St. Mungos. Draco was talking to the receptionist with Harry in his arms.
“What did you do to him?” Draco shouted as he pulled Harry into his arms, cradling him in his lap. Tonks rolled her eyes and glared at Draco.
Harry’s tongue and teeth attacked Draco’s collarbone, and Draco moaned as Harry’s teeth dug into his collarbone. Harry could feel as Draco started to vibrate underneath him and Harry had Draco’s erection poking him in the abdomen through Draco’s pants. Harry’s hands slipped down to Draco’s waistband and started working on Draco’s pants, slipping them off and then ripped Draco’s shirt off. Draco’s hands found the hem of Harry’s shirt and pulled it off, and then Draco started working on Harry’s pants. Harry’s lips continued to nip at Draco’s collarbone, but his hands moved down and captured Draco’s hands in his own, and he trapped Draco’s hands to his hips.
“I don’t know, but I have my invisibility cloak.” Harry said as she pulled it out from between her breasts and handed it to Draco.
“I know, thank you.” Hermione said as the Weasley’s left, Ron pausing before leaving with them. “Do you know where Draco’s room is?” Hermione asked as she turned to Remus.
“Well, Father. Just for your information Harry and I can have kids if we want to, and that is if we want to and also if we want to. We are still in school, Father, so it doesn’t matter until we are out of school, if we are still together then, and I really hope that we are. So stop what you are doing and stop trying to dictate who I see. Now out of my room, please.” Draco stated as he walked over to his father and started pushing his father out of his room and into the hallway. Draco shut the door and turned back towards Harry. “I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t know that he was going to do that, I thought I would have had more time before he figured it out.” Draco walked over to the bed and curled up next to Harry, who was still sprawled across Draco’s bed.
“No, I just miss them, fawn. I will be alright once I go home to Remus. I will think about dinner.” Sirius said as he turned to leave.
They walked down to the Great Hall like that running into none of their classmates for everyone was already at lunch. When they walked into the Great Hall everyone turned to look at them as Draco walked Harry over to the Gryffindor table and only let go of her after she sat down between Ron and Hermione, and then he walked over to the Slytherin table and sat down between Pansy and Blaise. Hermione’s eyes followed Draco all the way over there and then stared as Ron did the opposite and stared with his mouth hanging open at Harry.
“Well, then I am sorry to inform you, Mr. Weasley, but you have detention starting the day back from break with Professor Snape. He can see to the punishment he seems fit.” McGonagall said as she turned to walk out of the room.
He opened the door to find himself standing on the playground at school, and Dudley and his friends were after him. He was about eight. Dudley and his friends finally got him, and they broke his arm. Dudley threatened that if he told his other arm would be broken as well. Harry’s sitting in the principal’s office with the Dursley’s, and the principal is asking him who did it, but he just cowers curled in the chair in fear that his other arm is going to be broken tomorrow if he tells.
“Yes, you definitely have her fiery temper, Miss Potter, but you are more like your mother than you realize, more so your mother than your father in most ways actually.” Severus stated.
“Well, in this position I have quite an advantage over you.” She smirked and leaned down gently brushing her lips against Draco’s as her hands came up to caress Draco’s jaw and maneuver it into a better position for the kiss. Then they pulled away as someone cleared their throat, and they both looked up to find Madam Pomfrey standing next to the bed. Harry blushed as she hid her face into the side of Draco’s neck, and Draco chuckled, pushing them up into a sitting position.
“No, I don’t think I can. I’m just drained right now, and I feel as if I’m drunk.” Harry said as he tried to step forward, but stumbled into Malfoy. Malfoy grabbed Harry’s shoulders to steady him, and Harry leaned into Malfoy’s shoulder. Harry could feel himself drifting off, and he closed his eyes. “You’re kind of warm, Malfoy.” Harry muttered into Malfoy’s shoulder.
Ever since that day, Draco has tried to get Harry’s eyes to do the same exact thing again but have been unsuccessful, until today. Draco smiled at the light that twinkled through Harry’s eyes, and the two boys looked over at Narcissa. She just nodded her head, and Draco pulled Harry off towards his bedroom. The two boys had a joining rooms, and they found Harry’s trunk and owl in his room. Draco pulled Harry over to his bed and the two plopped down on the bed next to each other.
“When you just walked away, part of me was missing.” He whispered. “You walked out, and took part of me with you when you did, and now that your back I feel whole again.” Draco whispered.
“He doesn’t know, but I don’t think he’ll notice much.” Hermione said as the doors to the Great Hall burst open, and Draco Malfoy was standing there and he looked furious. “Shit.” Hermione said as she spun in Ron’s arms and looked at him and then up at the staff table where Snape was standing up with slight fear in his eyes.
“I guess.” Draco focused on the wards and said, “If you seize fire and promise not to harm any of the residence, I will allow you admittance inside the wards.” The spells stopped, and Draco could see them shaking their heads in agreement. Draco allowed the wards down, and he said, “You may enter.” The group stepped across the wards and the second that everyone was through the wards were back up.
“I will be helping. No matter how much I think he should be there for some of the things he did in school; I understand that 13 years of unnecessary imprisonment should be suitable for his punishment for school. So, I will be helping to make sure he is cleared along with Albus, though I’m not sure how much help he will be.”
“Dray, what are you talking about?” Harry pulled back and looked Draco in the eyes. “Of course, I’m for this. Why wouldn’t I be for this, Dray? I was the one who initiated the first kiss. Are you alright with this, Dray? That’s the real question.” Harry pulled away from Draco and stood up off the bed.
Draco pulled Harry from the shower as he still had his arms around Harry to keep him warm. “Why am I so cold?” Harry asked with his teeth chattering making barely audible.
is a feminine noun but for the sake of this fic, let’s ignore it and just think of it as a cute French pet name.
I don’t know where to start. I don’t even know if I should start, or if it will make everything worse and harder to bear. But somehow, I feel we owe it to you, and to ourselves. To try, even if I don't know what we are trying yet.
Your grandparents are visiting us at the moment, which is unusual. Normally, they prefer to remain on their own domain and have us come to them, but this time Mother insisted she needed a proper Afternoon Tea and a bit of shopping in London. After all, there’s only one Harrods and it is not located in Italy. Father just rolls his eyes and prefers to stay inside and look after Oden and Idunn, which is perfectly fine since it allows us to honour your birthday by going flying tonight when it’s dark and your stars can be seen in the sky. I hope you come to see us, too. Andromeda will come by to visit her sister as well, now that they’ve reconciled and found each other again. About time, I think. Nothing is more important than family. Even my father is a firm believer of that, regardless of his actions sometimes.
Did pensieves even work with memories he himself did not even remember? Or did he have to do this the long way and investigate? Moving his hand from its position of holding his head up to rub a spot on his thighs that's been hurting all morning now, he quickly retracted it upon contact.
The unlikely duo looked exactly like what a couple looked liked, dancing, laughing, holding hands. And let’s not forget the loving stares into each other's eyes. They were swaying away to another one of The Weird Sisters hits, with Harry constantly stepping on Draco's toes and Draco gracefully guiding him.
As if Pansy’s words triggered something in the room, the lights instantly went out for a split second, before focusing on the teaching stage, where Harry and Draco stood, silently.
Even as the night died down, the stares at the duo had never wavered. Draco and Harry have finally left the dance floor and migrated next to the food bar, drinking butterbeer and feasting on the massive supply of treacle tarts.
Draco winced as he anticipated what would happen next, alcohol and high-speed broomstick chases were not a good combination. With the added fact that Harry also brought out the most competitive part of him, this would not end well.
A loud crashing sound pulled Harry out of his musings, turning towards the door, he readied his wand to stun whoever that would come through the door next, nobody could see the room before he had cleaned it up.
The potion was green-ish silver and looked exactly like the one Ginny had gifted him. No, no, no. He watched horrified as Draco gulped down the potion and grew exactly three inches taller. Three inches he had just grown, making Draco once again taller than him.
“Harry, I don't know how much longer I can hear you talk about Malfoy? Has it occurred to you yet that maybe Malfoy forgot what happened during Yule too?”
“ Remember how I went to Yule with Malfoy because of him being an insufferable prick? And remember how you were pestering me all weekend to tell you what happened?” He swallowed nervously at their unimpressed glares. “Well, I don't know what happened too...Surprise?”
“That's not important Blaise, all you need to know is that Potter knows what happened that night, and it’s only a matter of time before he figures out I don't know and comes to gloat. So it is crucial that I remember before that happens, which is what this is for, you help me gather ingredients, then I can get the potion done by three in the morning and then Potter and I will be even! So will you help or not?”
“There goes your plan of purposely avoiding him all lesson, Harry!” Ron gave him a wicked grin as he patted him on the back heading towards Zabini.
By dinner, the news of Potter’s and Malfoy’s arrangement for Yule had spread like wildfire among the school. It was what everyone was talking about, besides the fact that Dumbledore seemed to have dyed his hair an odd blue.
True to Pansy’s words, Draco and Harry showed up together, with Harry holding on to Draco’s arms. Even with literally everyone’s eyes on them, even Filch’s, they didn’t seem to realize. No, they were far too engrossed in their conversation to care about the world surrounding them.
Saturday and Sunday pass relatively quickly for both boys, both staying in the respective dorms. But when Monday rolled around and both boys were still clueless as to what happened last Friday night, the pain from the hangover was long gone but the panic of their loss of memory started to set in.
No, he couldn't make this decision and he didn't want to, he’d let Malfoy drive the broom, and he’d follow his moves. Yes this was a good plan, a fool-proof one at that.
Sitting next to the broom shed to catch a breather from their search, the boys of the group started a mini chaser’s game, with Ron’s inability to play a seeker’s match. Throwing the quaffle from one end of the pitch to the other, laughing as the wind zooms pass their faces, all the while Hermione observed them languidly while reading her book. Harry wondered briefly if this was what they missed in the past seven years in Hogwarts, that if without the constant threat of Voldemort looming over their heads, they would be able to be this carefree.
Smirking to himself as Potter once again fell to his arse, he walked over to lend Potter a hand and to slide in a few more insults.
But yet, only a few days later after the incident in the hallway occurred. Harry was seen, holding a bunch of specially ordered roses in front of the Slytherin dorms.
“I cannot believe the amount of shit you’ve been through over the years Potter and here I was thinking my life was tough under my father’s scrutinizing gaze.”
“Hold up Potter, you've got a bit of tart on your face. Honestly I thought you were the one with better manners out of your little golden trio.” Draco said all the while looking down to carefully wipe the smudge on the corner of Harry’s lips.
Apparently getting lost in his thoughts while playing quidditch was not his best idea again, he was caught off guard as Ron threw the quaffle at the post behind him, hoping to score, but instead of scoring, the quaffle strayed towards him and landed smack on his face, knocking him off his broom.
Leaning down into the kiss, Harry marvelled at the need to lean down to kiss Draco, but he was confused, why wasn't Draco more concerned with the new difference in height? No there had to be some catch, there was no way Draco wasn’t even slightly peeved about his new predicament.
“That is immaterial now that we are both here to fix the mess that we left, you take the left side while I fix up the right?”
Casting an unsure glance to his friends, the interest in their eyes was so not encouraging, but he had come this far, and could not stand the thought of another meeting with Potter with him knowing more than he did. With that in mind, Draco tipped back the glass and downed the potion all at once.
“Salazar’s right arm! Parkinson What do you think you’re doing!” the boy twisted his head in anger to look at his best friend, furious that she had interrupted his time with his Potter. Just as he was going to open his mouth to tell off the Slytherin, he realized what he had just thought and reminded himself that no they were not together and that this was all a ruse.
Pausing, Draco was at a loss on how to reply, resigning to the truth, he answered, “The war.” and walked away to gather his belongings and leave with the slytherins. He did not need anyone’s pity.
“ Exercising, meal plans, workout out. You know the whole muggle health idea?” Hermione replied and at Harry’s puzzled look, continued on, “ Go ask Seamus about it, heard his dad’s a big fanatic about these things.”
Draco gawked in horror as he watched the scene unfold in front of him, the Draco before him had lost all decorum and grace, in front of Harry Potter, no less! No wonder Potter was so cocky in their last few meetings, if this was how he acted the entire night.
What did he want to do, what good was coming out of this friendship with Malfoy? The war was over, yes, and in the end Malfoy did come through for him and saved his life. But at the end of the day, they both had obligations to the world, and two paths leading away from each other. They had carefully steered clear of anything war-related during Yule, but they couldn't live in this fantasy forever.
Casting the spell to understand the conversation between the fairies, his cheeks immediately turned a bright red upon hearing the topic of their conversation.
Lazily reaching out a hand to catch the snitch again, Harry entertained his stupid little fantasy again, seeing that he couldn't sleep, he imagined taking Malfoy’s hand and pulling him to the west towers and up the stairs to the …. Astronomy tower.
Harry watched as Malfoy slowly raised his wand to point at the words, he felt the cold horror wash through him as he realized that he didn't want this to end and he had to take this chance and maybe his little fantasy could be an un-fantasy?
The chapters are slowly getting longer!!! A fact that I'm really proud of. Also note that this is not beta'd of anything so please excuse any mistakes made, I'm trying really hard
Though she looked more disappointed than he had, the trio headed up back to the castle, ushered by Ron’s wails of hunger. Maybe he didn't remember but he still had them, besides this problem is life-threatening, it could wait.
“ So what happened, blondie, you look very shocked.” Pansy spoke, seeing that her friend had recovered from his black-out.
Harry fought the blush coming up on his cheeks, he hated it when Draco teased him about his height. But it was inevitable, with it being one of Draco’s favourite taunts ever since they were eleven year-olds. It only got worse after they started dating. Every single one of the pet names he had gotten from Draco had involved some type of short joke. My little saviour. My pint-sized love. Draco was a half a head taller than him and he loved reminding him of it everyday.
“What are you so happy about you got Zabini too! And you Hermione! What got you all grinning about being paired with Parkinson!”
“Don't be stupid Ron, Malfoy definitely remembers… he’s Malfoy. But you make a point...I know that he doesn’t know that I don’t know”
And luck seemed to be on Hogwarts' side rather than the boys, as every head turned to the entrance when both boys happened to rush in at the same time. Eyes narrowed to scrutinize the situation at hand, it was not planned no, both boys seemed to be as startled as each other for this to be planned. In fact they both seem to be giving the other a once over, examining who has the upper hand, and after an agonizing minute. The blonde gave a jerky nod from his head.
“ Harry, you’re like a brother to me and now that you're dating Malfoy, I can't directly assault him. So this is me, assaulting his ego through making you taller than him, it’s like a side ‘fuck you’!”
Now that Ron mentioned it, Harry remembered a few flashes from last friday night, of him here in the pitch with Malfoy, but there weren't any clear images, just snippets and flashes of the night, laughter, smiles and Malfoy’s pink luscious lips.
“Lucius Malfoy is certainly a piece of work ...did i tell you about the story about your house elf-well ex house elf once-”
Hearing the name Harry, Draco’s attention immediately snapped towards his friend,“He specifically said Harry?” Draco frowned at how foreign that name sounded on his lips. Harry, Harry, Harry, he repeated in his mind.
And with that Harry locked Draco’s eyes in a fierce stare, in a futile attempt to stare him down, “Reckon we are.”
“Yes those” The blonde replied while rummaging through his trunk, hoping to find those damned tarts.
I UPDATED im sorry im trying but now i have an idea, albeit vague, of where this story is going so, yay!
Draco did not know how to respond to that, for the first time in his life, he did not have a response to Harry Potter, but in his defense, was he supposed to admit to not knowing something now that he finally knew it?
Casting a spell to measure his height again, he sighed, looking at the same number that had been staring at him for the past week or so. Hermione had told him that the growth spurt would stop at some point of another, and he was fine with it, that is if the height he stopped at was taller than Draco’s.
“ No, I need you guys to help me gather the ingredients for brewing, like I need your help for brewing Pansy, I originally planned for myself to gather all the ingredients but after Charms, I need my memories back, Potter cannot one-up me.”
Walking around the castle grounds, hoping to spot something that will trigger his stupid brain to remember what happened last night, he distinctly picked up some giggling near the forest trees, slowly approaching the tree, spotting a gaggle of fairies circling each other.
Now he was getting ridiculous, him not catching the snitch? Impossible. Stuffing the snitch into the pockets of his robe, he landed the broom alongside Ron and caught Hermione up with what had happened.
And the lesson continued like that Potter firing spells at him, not succeeding, to his contempt and Potter’s frustration. Sensing the lesson coming to an end, Draco focused all his power to the shield, absorbing Potter’s last few spells and pushing it back towards him.
“Dray?” Gregory questioned as he pushed open the door to their dorms, catching the blonde’s attention.
stood out without the comparison of the pair of striking green eyes. Maybe he should make good on the promise of yule night,
“Yes, Harry. You must have heard the part where she explained how old families have the recipe right? Very sorry that your efforts have been in vain, love. But I must say I am appreciating your new physique.” Draco ended the sentence by gripping his biceps, shameless groping them.
It was a beautiful kiss, in Harry’s opinion, with the moonlight shining softly on their skins, with the snitch escaping from Harry’s pocket where it had been roughly stuffed earlier, roaming around their heads, creating a halo like image around them.
Grabbing his invisibility cloak and map from the bedside table, Harry rushed out to the dorms, his mind flashing one scene over and over again, realizing that he had to get to the astronomy tower before anyone else ever saw the evidence of what happened that night.
And breakfast proceeded on like a usual affair, snarky comments from their group and Pansy and Vince catching them up with the latest gossip. Vince was quite the avid gossiper, despite popular belief. He was grateful for the attention being turned away from the “piping hot tea” of his own affair with Potter, even with the obvious looming threat of his loss of memories over his head.
It was a Saturday wasn't it? Saturday meant tutor day with the younger years! Yes, this was perfect, he had time to escape his friends and time to order his memories.
“If you're commenting on my smell after a quidditch game again, I suggest you take a sniff at yourself Ron.”
Luckily, falling off things seemed to be a pattern for him, for he had finally learned what to actually do when he fell. Rolling a few times upon contact with the ground, Harry stood up with some form of grace and no broken bones, a fact that he was remarkably proud of.
Opening his eyes to experience the first snippet of the night, he saw himself and Potter drunkenly swaying out of the doors to the castle ground, they had one arm around each other, the other holding a goblet of firewhiskey, Potter was loudly singing the Weird Sisters hit that had been playing when they left the Great Hall and he had been cheering him on.
Pissed off that he would be stuck shorter than Draco forever, he pouted petulantly at his boyfriend, who was still groping his arms. Well, he tried to pout at his boyfriend, before his lips were captured in a kiss by said boyfriend, before he had to tilt his head up to kiss said boyfriend again.
He couldn't decide on the one-liner to use to show-off his new height, which was why he was pacing, there were just so many options. There were the classics, Hey there shortie ones or the infuriating pet names Draco used, Hey there little Slytherin. Okay that one didn’t sound right.
“Yes, it is what you think it is. Custom made just for my beautiful raven.” He whispered and then kissed her temple. The ring had two intertwining bands one slightly thicker than the other that came and wrapped around this diamond with an emerald in the middle of it.
“I know.” Draco responded, and he took a deep breath, and as he released it the concealment charm dissipated. “Let’s get this over with. Do you want to sit at the Gryffindor table or the Slytherin table?” Draco asked.
“Dray, why do I pick abusive people to be my friends?” Harkin whispered almost so quiet that Draco couldn’t hear it over the running water. Draco quickly pulled his clothes off so he could pull her into a hug and climbed into the tub with her.
“Draco, I’m alright with this, you and Harry. I won’t tell your father until you want him to know, but I just want you to know that I am alright with this.” Narcissa kissed Draco’s cheek and then Harry’s. “I will leave you two to yourselves, and I will try and convince your father not to let you do this.” Narcissa said and she turned and walked out of the room.
“It’s fine, Remi. I understand. Most people still see me as Harry Potter. They don’t see me as the girl who I am now, and I’m kind of scared to go back to Hogwarts, Remi. I don’t know how they are going to react to me being engaged to Draco, and on top of it carrying his baby inside me. Which is why I know why Lucius wants to keep it a secret for now, but I don’t know how I’m going to keep a secret when I start to show.” Harkin stated.
“Have you thought of names yet? I mean, when are you due anyway?” Pansy questioned, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Well, that was interesting.” Healer Johnson said as she walked into the room. “Sirius, good to see you again. Draco, want to come back with me?” she asked as she gestured towards the back room, and Draco just nodded and followed her through the door.
“Yeah, I have no idea, how Granger got with Victor Krum, but I also don’t care since she isn’t my best friend. Though I’m curious on how Weasley got a date at all. He doesn’t seem like the type that would be good with girls, if you know what I mean.” This made Draco laugh.
“You don’t think I know that. I know that. I am the one who wakes up with morning sickness every day. I can barely keep most of my food down. I know I’m pregnant, and I wasn’t in any danger where I was. I was probably in the safest place besides here and Hogwarts. Not many people even know where the place is anymore, because as I said it’s under a Fidelius Charm. I was perfectly safe, and you have nothing to worry about. I’ve been taking care of myself for 13 years, I can handle this, like everything else that I have handled in the last 14 years of my life. Now if you are done with the rite act I’m going to go and throw up.” Harkin said as she covered her mouth and ran from the room.
“I never said that I thought that this was Harry’s fault, Draco. I’m just informing you that if this happens often I will be having more than just this conversation with you. Understood?” Narcissa stared Harry and Draco down and Harry just nodded, but Draco muttered yes, ma’am under his breath. Narcissa walked away and Harry looked at Draco.
“I am not talking to you as a professor right now. I am talking to you as a concerned godfather, Draco.” Severus stated, and Harkin glanced from Severus back to Draco. She had noticed the strain in his eyes, but he keeps insisting that he is fine, and she can’t force him to tell her things. “I know you are pushing yourself too far, Draco, and that most definitely isn’t healthy. For you. For your soon to be wife. And definitely not for your children growing inside her. You are pushing yourself, and if you push yourself too far, both of you,” Severus added as he glanced towards Harkin, “You can send Harkin into early labor, and with twins that most likely will happen early anyway, but you don’t want to push that timeline too much for she will most likely lose the twins before they are actually could be born. Now I know you two don’t really want to be parents at this age, but you decided to have these babies, and accidental forced abortion could possibly ruin both of you at an early age. You both are pushing yourselves to far, and I want to help in the small amounts that I can. Draco, though I understand why you are doing it, the concealment charm needs to drop; it is sucking all of your power to hold it, power that should be going to Harkin and the twins to stabilize them. She is strained because you are strained. Communication is the biggest thing when it comes to relationships. It can make or break a relationship. So, talk to each other. Make sure that you are talking, and everything is alright with both of you. If I have noticed I am sure some of your classmates have as well, they just don’t want to say anything.” Severus stated.
“Why are you here?” Harkin asked as she looked back and forth between Sirius and Remus and Narcissa and Lucius.
“That is not funny, fawn. I can think of several times. One time includes the night we met. Going up against a werewolf who has not taken their potion can get you killed.” Sirius stated.
“A prophecy. I was told what it says, but it turns out that there was more than what my spy overheard, and I want to know what it is. Are you curious yet, Harry Potter?”
“Mr. Potter isn’t in trouble, Mr. Malfoy, and neither are you, Mr. Malfoy.” They both looked up at Snape and stared at him.
“Putting me under a sleeping spell to snuggle with my naked body. You know, I sleep like a rock right? You would probably be able to crawl in my bed while I was sleeping and I wouldn’t notice. You make a noise though and I’ll be awake in a heat beat.” Harry stated as he leaned in closer to Draco.
“Yes, Master Draco. Tally will get started.” The house elf went to work and started folding the clothes and packing them away, and when she was finished with that she moved about the room collecting all of Harry’s miscellaneous items. Within a half an hour of Tally showing up Harry’s truck was packed. “Tally has packed all of Master Harry’s thing, but Tally cannot find Master Harry’s cloak. The invisible one.”
“Grab her, I’ve got your bags. Hurry to the Hospital Wing.” Hermione ordered, and Draco did as he was told. He carried her to the Hospital Wing, and he laid her down on one of the beds, while Hermione ran to grab Madam Pomfrey.
“ Me?” Harry felt personally offended at that accusation, he didn't know that they were at that the astronomy tower at all until fifteen minutes earlier, and here is Draco, talking as if he didn't know anything about it, “ You could have fixed it all along why are you here accusing me of not fixing it if you didn't too?”
As he thought, alcohol and broomsticks brought on lots of vomiting, looking away from where the two boys were actively puking their guts out and giggling at the same time, a feat Draco did not understand how he managed to perform.
“ I mean I’m totally onboard with the idea of you continuing to insult Malfoy and see where it goes?” ...and there was the Weasley touch he needed. So maybe this breakfast wasn't as much of a disaster as he imagined.
Entering the room, Hermione raised an eyebrow at the odd collection of people gathered there, Pansy’s gaggle of Slytherins, without Draco, most of their Gryffindor friends and Luna. Walking towards Pansy, she directed her concerns towards her girlfriend, hoping to get an answer in return.
Both boys came to face a horrid pile of gunk in front of them, casting a charm to rid them of the smell, Harry gave another unimpressed look to Ron, “Congratulations, you found someone’s vomit, do you want a prize?”
Vincent smirked as he opened his mouth, “they went into the castle grounds, but what happened after I didn't catch, care to fill in the gaps, Draco?”
And apparently, they were acting very close, giggling and leaning on each other's shoulders, so close that these fairies misunderstood that they were a couple.
The entirety of the school arrived at the great hall bright and early, anticipating some type of drama from Malfoy and Potter, after all they had not been seen together since their epic entrance and performance at the yule ball.
And that concludes my first fic! This has taken way longer than I expected but I hope you enjoy reading this as much I enjoyed reading it! Leave a kudos or a comment, if you like (i greatly appreciate it). Check out my tumblr drarryismysoul too!
