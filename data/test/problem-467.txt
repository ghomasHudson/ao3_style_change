Everyone supported Ron because he came from a poor family and had no claim to fame. They wanted him to rise up and shine. Even the Slytherins were warming up to him as champion.
“Shut up.” Draco peered from behind his arms. His anger finally overcoming his fear. “Shut your mouth. You don’t know a thing about him.” He sat up and put his arms down. “You wine about his father but you can’t accept the fact that he’s his own person. And who are you to judge anyone for who they love? I can’t help that any more than you can help loving anyone else.”
They left all left the tent except for Rita Skeeter who leaned out and dragged her photographer in. She sauntered over to Harry and began harassing him. The photographer leered at Fleur like he had during the weighing of the wands.
“Yours, the ghosts below, the owls on the roof. I read them all at the same time.” She was still recovering from it. “It was so sudden. I didn’t think I could do it. Much less that it would be that easy.” She had to take a shaky breath. “You were thinking of lunch.”
She was massive and angry. Her whole body was shivering with rage at the idea of her eggs being threatened. She roared and Ron fell back against the doorway into the stadium with hands over his ears.
Her expression never changed as she went on petting the doe. “I’ll never change my mind. I know you’ll never understand but I chose James. Trust me, it’s for the best of the world.” Her eyes shifted down as if she were sad. “Or it may not matter.”
Mr. Bagman went on, “with some creatures along the way.” He lifted a bag and pulled from it a golden scepter. It was about two feet long with an orb at the top of it. “There are six of these at the end of the obstacle course. All you have to do to move on to the next stage is to grab one of these.” He put the scepter away and added, “good luck, we will be back once the course is ready.”
Joan responded, “I don’t know how many dragons you’ve fought but I want all the support I can get.” She held up a hand and finished, “support I know I can count on.” She leaned in and whispered, “she thinks you’re useless because you’re a man.”
He sat in his bed and cried for the last time in a long time. Knowing that it was time for changes. At some point he put a log in the fire to keep him warm the rest of the night.
Harry looked up to the sky. “Professor Barnes brought the ministry’s workers into their home. It was obvious in an instant how I was being treated. The ministry workers declared my aunt and uncle unfit to care for me. My uncle tried to punch Professor Barnes. It was embarrassing, the professor broke his arm and laughed him off. Then I lived with Professor Winters for a summer. Now that my real godfather, Sirius, is cleared of all charges I’m living with him now.”
Joan couldn’t describe why but that put a warm feeling in her heart. She had never wanted a family or to get married. She had accepted Adrian’s job offer because of the money and then decided she liked the kids. She didn’t say anything but they both got dressed and went back out into the wilds of Hogwarts on a Saturday.
Jordan was talking about them, “I’m being told that the dragon is exhibiting behaviors seen when a dragon is surrendering. This has never been seen in nesting mothers. Ever. We are witnessing history people.”
Ginny returned, “I don’t want people to bully you for being who you are.”
She clarified, “large enough to tempt a dragon. I need it in a week and a half.”
Two days later Adrian Barnes sat in the staff room of Hogwarts along with all the other professors. This was the pre-school year talk. Where they would discuss schedules, new rules, major events, and anything else that needed to be figured out before the students arrived.
He wrote down seven potions:
He told her, “yeah, all the students are after Potter. The only ones who seem to be intent on keeping the peace are the two of us, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Moody. We’re fighting a losing battle with limited resources. Outnumbered and underpowered.” He rubbed her shoulder.
She stepped out of the shadows and asked in a deadly low voice, “you want to tell me what you were doing in that graveyard?”
She tried to protest but the twins were stronger than they looked. “Hey! I’m trying to get to the library!”
The tent flap popped open, making everyone jump. Ludo Bagman followed by Rita Skeeter, Madame Maxine, Professor Karkaroff, and Professor Dumbledore.
Arlene asked, “how do I get to the kitchens?”
In search of a more relevant topic he focused his thoughts on his treatment of Draco. He had used magic to peer into his mind. Maybe that had been a mistake. The issue wasn’t that Draco was gay. Lucius would go insane if he found out. Severus certainly wasn't going to tell him. The thing that bothered Severus was that it was with Potter.
Joan wrapped her up in a hug and said, “Arlene, I would love to be your mom.” She hugged her back. They shared that sweet moment. It had taken them a year and half but they had become family.
It had been a long time since Adrian had felt true fear. He did now. All he could say was, “no, please no. Please no.” He was powerless. Arlene would face the dragon in two days.
“Yes.”
“no, wait, my classes. Everyone will have figured out that one by now. Everyone will know that I don’t take wand classes,” Arlene was the one to realize that the plan they had been formulating would not work. All three of them went silent for a while. Arlene stood up and said, “no, I’m going to keep using it in the tournament and keep everyone guessing. I’m not going to hide in this bathroom anymore either.” She walked out before either of them could stop her.
Remus said, “that sounds like a good idea. We’ll go with that.”
Adrian looked out at the cage. A naked Voldemort pulled his wand from the robes he had been wrapped up in as a baby. There hadn’t been a wand in them before. Adrian checked three times. He was fully adult now and human looking. He donned the robe and tied it to cover himself up.
"Say it again." he managed to whisper and Potter let out a deep sigh, as if he had waited for this just as long as Draco had. It did terrible things to body.
"I'm not going to let you sleep on the sofa." Potter smiled slightly and Draco took a shuddering breath.
"Nothing." Draco said quickly and wiped over his cheeks with his sleeves. Then he crossed his arms before him.
' Eric clenched his fist and-"
Potter made a plate ready and handed it to Draco before giving him a spoon. The meal smelled intensely like curry but it was an intriguing scent. The brown sauce had little pieces of beef swimming in them and there was a side of rice. He hesitantly took a little bit of both on his spoon and put it in his mouth. Potter was right. It did taste amazing. Only after a few bites he felt his throat starting to burn a little from the spice, but it wasn't that bad. Potter sat down next to him. His sauce was brown as well, but with a red colouring to it.
"Nothing." Draco shook his head. "Nothing... I just... do you want to sleep on the sofa? Or... or in the bed?"
When the cold crept up his legs and he felt a shiver again, he decided to get on the sofa. He longed for his bed but Potter had been right. Draco wouldn't do anything he told him to do. As soon as he was on the sofa, he put the vial down and grabbed the remote. He had been reluctant to get a telly at the beginning but it really had paid off. It was a good way to waste time, of which he had plenty. He heard a few sounds from the kitchen, but tried to ignore them when another sneeze shook through him and Potter yelled blessings again. Draco groaned and took the vial again, downing it in one go. Draco felt his headache lifting slightly and his airways opening a little bit. The Pepper up did its job.
"Good morning." Draco said quietly and stroked over Potter's arm with his fingers.
"Besides..." he smiled at Draco. "You can't tell me you don't want to get your feet massaged."
"I..." Draco paused and took a deep breath. "What are you saying?"
"Oh." Draco answered and looked at the bag.
"Two lovers." Draco said quietly into his cup and swallowed. "It plays in New York during the war against Grindelwald. It's based on a true story."
When Potter came back, he placed the plates on the table as well and started unpacking the carton bowls with plastic tops.
Potter gave him a sheepish smile.
"Mhm." Draco hummed in agreement and closed his eyes for a second. Potter squeezed his legs lightly under the blanket.
"Merlin..." he whispered again. "You have no idea, Harry."
"You like me." he said quietly and Draco swallowed.
"I cooked for you. I read to you." he said and chuckled a little. "I massaged your feet, for Merlin's sake."
"Oh, no." he said, a hand raising to his chest in faked pain and shook his head, his voice mocking. "But I am so turned on by all the snot and bacteria. All these layers are especially sexy."
"Come on, Malfoy." he said. "I couldn't be more obvious."
"Yes." Draco said quietly and Potter's smile widened.
"Because I know how it is to have nobody take care of you." Potter answered, his eyes plastered on the telly again, but his thumbs still stroked along Draco's ankles. "And I didn't want you to feel like that."
"That's good to hear." Potter said quietly and Draco held his breath again. He was overwhelmed. None of this made sense.
"How are you doing?" he asked. "Feeling better?"
"I... always thought you were just being polite." Draco replied quietly. "Or hoping for another round."
Draco's heart jumped and he gave Potter a small smile too. And then it was silent. Draco didn't know what to do next. Should he just... go into his bedroom and go to bed? Was he supposed to offer Potter the other side of his bed? He wanted to but it... seemed inappropriate. But expecting him to sleep on the sofa again felt inappropriate too. Before he could come to a conclusion, Potter pulled out one hand from under the blanket and reached for Draco's hand. He held his breath as Potter slowly intertwined their fingers and squeezed his hand.
"Watching that movie is my plan." Potter answered. "So why not watch it together. I'm here now anyway. I think you may like it."
"Eric just told Samadriel to leave." Draco said and took a sip from the tea in his hands. Potter nodded, scanned the page and smiled.
"Ah." Potter shook his head again, his eyes falling to the floor as he started to turn around again. "Good bye, Malfoy."
." he sighed quietly and Harry's grip on him tightened. "Harry and Draco."
"You don't... have to." Draco said quietly and Potter smiled again. This absolute knee weakening smile that had never been addressed to Draco before tonight.
"Yeah?" he asked quietly and Draco nodded hesitantly. "I'd love to."
"Just eat." he said then and took the remote, dialling up the volume. A clear indication that he wouldn't answer this question. Draco felt butterflies in his stomach and he didn't know what to do. So, he slowly took the spoon and started eating the broth. It tasted incredible and he felt his stomach fill, his body warm up. Potter threw him a few glances here and there, but kept quiet, until Draco was done. Then he reached for the bowl. "Do you want more?"
"It doesn't matter." Draco said. "I've already read it several times."
"You're a mystery, Draco Malfoy." he said softly. "Two days ago, you didn't even want to see my face and now you cried because you thought I left?"
"Uh... yeah." Draco answered. "What's that?"
Potter sighed, glanced at the telly and then looked back at Draco. His face showed frustration but nothing else.
The coffee smell in the air, the morning sun washing through the window and Harry. Warm Harry, soft Harry.
"Three portions." he answered. "There's a little left."
Draco was cut off by Potter's lips pressing against his own. He couldn't help himself from falling into it, as Potter's arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him protectively closer. Draco whimpered as Potter's tongue entered his mouth, exploring every inch. His arms came up and folded around his neck, holding on as if he would fall down a cliff if he ever let go. When Potter finally leaned back again, Draco looked at him with big eyes and heavy breaths. Potter smiled sheepishly.
"Because it's warm and easy to stomach." Potter answered and took a seat next to Draco on the sofa. "There's a whole pot in the kitchen if you want more."
"But... you are....
"Well, this one is fine." Draco replied absentmindedly as he watched Potter take the first bite of his plate. He continued eating as well.
"I should… uhm... take a shower I think." he murmured and he heard Potter chuckle behind him.
"I don't need to be taken care of." Draco said, his eyes still plastered on the bag.
"I know." Potter answered, before his eyes dropped down again and he kept reading the words out loud.
"What's that?" Draco asked as Potter came closer.
"What do you think I'm doing?" Harry asked and shook his head with a smile. "I'm reading to you."
"Well, now you know why I didn't answer. You may leave again." was all Draco answered and started closing the door but Potter raised one hand and held it open. Draco groaned again. He was in a bad mood and he didn't want anyone to see him like this. Snotty nosed, unshowered and even paler than usual. Especially not Potter.
"I wondered why you didn't answer my owl and I overheard Parkinson saying you were sick today at lunch." Potter explained, when Draco’s cough died down.
Draco stared at Potter for a few moments, which felt like an eternity. He had many objections, most of which he would never say out loud. He didn't understand this. Potter didn't care about him. He never had. Draco knew that. He wasn't so delusional to think that only because they were fucking from time to time, that Potter could ever want more. So, what was the reason behind this? Why had Potter come here? He said the first thing that came to mind, already regretting the words as they left his mouth.
"And the fruit?" Potter smiled.
Draco hesitantly took it, a spoon already in the bowl and looked at the light brown liquid. There were carrots and other vegetables cut up inside it, a few pieces of chicken and star noodles. He stared at it with big eyes and his mouth slightly open.
"Right." Draco nodded. "I saw the previews. Let's hope it's better than it seems to be."
"At least something." Potter smiled at him. "Tired?"
"Malfoy." Potter whispered and Draco's eyes shot to his. "What's wrong?"
Harry leaned back again a little and Draco opened his eyes to be caught by green ones immediately. He smiled contently at Draco and stroked his neck up to his face. Harry caressed Draco's cheek and he couldn't stop himself from sighing deeply and let his eyes flutter shut again as he leaned into the touch. Then he felt lips pressed to his again.
Draco didn't answer, his eyes still plastered on the paper bag and Potter raised one of his hands to Draco's chin, forcing him to look up.
"Indian." Potter grinned. "It's my favourite cuisine and its spicy. Spicy foods are supposed to clear mucus and help with coughing."
Draco felt a blush spreading on his face. Potter had stayed the night, for whatever reason and Draco could feel his heart beating through his chest. But he was gone now and Draco wasn't sure what was going to happen next. Potter wouldn't come back today, would he? It was unbelievable enough that he had showed up last night. He wouldn't come back to take care of Draco again... read to him. Draco downed the vial of pepper up, took his cup and walked into the living room. He turned on the telly and spent the rest of the day on the sofa. He only got up a few times to get tea, soup or the rest of the fruit salad.
"What?"
Hey y'all thanks for reading! This just so happens to be my first ever published fan fic so i would love some CONSTRUCTIVE criticism in the comments, just on how things are written, the names i gave the characters cause i wasn't too sure on what to call Draco so some feedback on that would be nice, the word choice and just anything you think could use some work.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dracia chuckled, Pansy always knew how to cheer her up. "Don't let Davis hear you saying that, you won't hear the end of it for weeks."
With that, the two six years and the head of Gryffindor house began the trek through winding hallways and up staircases Hailey had never seen before. After a few minutes they came to a large portrait of a witch in flowing purple and black robes that were speckled with stars and constellations.
"Are you quite finished looking around? It's been 5 minutes already." Dracie informed her, raising one of her perfectly shaped eyebrows.
After cleaning up the feathers and putting them in a special enchanted box given to her by her mother, Dracia walked over to the window seat and pushed the window open as she settled down against the plush green pillow resting there. She pulled a small compact mirror form the bag that still hung around her shoulders and flicked it open with a long elegant finger.
"That tramp can squawk all she wants, see if I give a rat's arse! Seriously though, are you doing, ok? I know you were basically obsessed with Potter for years but it can't be easy being bond to your rival." Pansy said finally letting her concern show as her eyebrows scrunched together slightly and the side of her lip turned down a touch.
"Now as I was saying, because of Ms. Malfoy's veela nature it will not be possible for the two of you to be separated for terribly long. This would prove difficult given your current dorms, so I have gone ahead and prepared the living quarters of a past astronomy professor to serve as your dorms for the duration of your time at Hogwarts." The headmaster said as he gestured to Professor McGonagall, who was standing to his left. " Professor McGonagall will show you to your rooms."
Blushing slightly Hailey just nodded quickly walking out of the room and up the stairs, Dracie close behind her.
"Persephone Parkinson." She said clearly as the surface of the mirror began to fog up and shift slowly revealing a smirking brunette on the other end.
Pansy made a face at the thought of the dark lord using a Veela bond to get a leg up in a war, the very notion was disgusting really.
Heyy y'all I can't believe some of you actually liked this and thanks so much to the people who commented I'm really thankful for your advice it has helped me come up with a few new ideas for where I plan to take the fic in the future and a bunch of new additions I had never considered before!
Huge snow-white wings erupted from her back in a flurry of silky soft feathers and long elegant horns, that curved backwards and up, sprouted from her head. Stretching out her wings they reached an impressive wing span of 12 ft. (4 meters) and trailed on the floor when she let them down. Her horns, the same snow white as her wings, had a beautiful golden pattern that started form the base and twirled up in a series of swirls so thin and delicate that they were hard to see form afar. the same golden pattern ran up the spine of her wings and curled around the horns that grew from the end of the wing’s spine.
Hailey stopped abruptly in the middle of taking off her sock and stared blankly at the floorboards in front of her. Quickly shaking her head to clear her thoughts she fished taking off most of her cloths, opting to just sleep in her shirt since the house elves hadn't come with her things just yet.
"You got yourself a good one there Cia, its not every day someone gets bound to the one and only chosen one who comes with a side order of universe altering powers she may or may not have any actual control over. Plus I already know you think she’s cute, I've been subjected to far to many of you famous potter rants to ever forget about how her Beautiful emerald eyes sparkle when the sun hits them just right, or her, Stupid glasses that block out most of her face and make her adorable button nose nearly impossible to properly appreciate!"
Dracia hummed to show she had heard, walked into the room, and shut the door without another word.
"Oh, shut it Malfoy, and by the way professor McGonagall told me that the house elves were bringing our luggage up to our rooms soon." Hailey said, rolling her eyes at her new Slytherin roommate.
Hailey turned to face the portrait, her surprise clear on her face.
Huffing in annoyance she flopped back into her chair turning her glare to the blonde girl sitting in the chair next to hers. Dracia Narcissa Malfoy, her sworn enemy and rival since their first day of school just over 6 years ago now, was looking remarkably unfazed at the situation they had found themselves in.

"Ah, yes I've heard quite a bit about you miss Hailey Potter, normal standers never quite applied to you did they," Lyra said, her eyes sparkling in a slimier way to her robes. " But I can assure you that in the vast history of Veelas and their mates there have been many cases where they did not get along at first and in everyone without fail, they were happy together."
The girls climbed the stairs in silence until they reached a deep brown door which was a similar colour to the coffee table. Dracia pushed the door open to reveal a circular room the same size as the common room except this room had hard wood floors so dark, they were almost black, cream-coloured walls and a large bed with deep blue hangings right across form the door. stepping into the room Hailey could see 2 doors to her left, a window seat to her right and a writing desk to the right of the door and 2 black leather chairs near the window seat with a coffee table separating them. Overall, the room gave off a very comfortable and warm vibe, Hailey liked this room very much.
Dracia Malfoy was a veela and, for reasons unfathomable to Hailey, the universe or whatever has jurisdiction over veelas and their mates had decided they were the ideal match.
With a soft fond smile Dracia crouched down to pick up the closest of the feathers that were now scattered around her room. The feather, like all the others that grew form her wings, was an unnaturally perfect snow white with thin golden veins.
could ever be in a relationship." Hailey said meeting the eyes of the painting.
"Dearie, Minerva is completely right; this is quite the change for you I'm sure but I'm confident that all will turn out well. I've done quite a bit of research on Veelas when I was alive and there has not been a single instance of a paring being incorrect." Hailey jumped at the sudden voice to her left until she realized it was the painting speaking.
"Hmm well it wasn't really up to the council, was it? Magic, and veela magic especially, works in mysterious strange ways and not even the dark lord can do much to sever the bond, if he’s even dumb enough to try that is, you remember what happened in 1678." Pansy said as she reached to grab a hair brush form out of frame and began to brush out her medium length hair.
"It's fine dearie, this can't be an easy time for you," the kindly older which said, and Hailey let out a breath of relief. " Now you should be getting to bed soon you must be tired from the train ride."
"I- I understand professor, thank you. I'll try and do that" Hailey stuttered out, taken aback by the concern McGonagall was displaying for her.
"Took you long enough Potter." the insufferable blonde said in a flat tone as she closed her book and stood up.
''Potter? Out of every possible being alive it just had to be her!' Dracia Malfoy thought as she paced around her new room, biting at her nail. 'Ok ok no this is fine I’ll figure this out I’m a Malfoy and a Veela for Salazar’s sake. I can and will make this work!'
(See the end of the chapter for
"Little shit." She muttered fondly as she jammed the mirror back into her bag and pushed herself up form her seated position. She absentmindedly made her way around her new room putting her clothes in her closet, her toiletries in the bathroom and placed her mirror and enchanted feather box on the bedside table before finally changing into her silk pyjamas and climbing bed.
I will make this work, she thought as she shifted into a better position, I'm sure there must be more to that girl then what I've seen there’s no way the magic set me up with someone incompatible.
Dracia Malfoy was perched on the leather chair facing the portrait hole, an open book in hand.
"Yeah, they said that about the killing curse too and yet here I am perfectly alive!" The young Gryffindor snapped throwing her arms above her head to emphasizes her point then wincing slightly at her tone. "I- I'm sorry you didn't deserve that."
"The password is Scutum." Lyra said as the portrait swung open to reveal a large circular room. As the three of them stepped into the room all Hailey could think was, wow. the floor of the room was mostly covered by a deep purple and black rug that was made to resemble the night sky, it had all the consolations outlined and labeled, the lunar cycle depicted on the rim and beautiful gold inlays decorating the edges. looking up Hailey saw the staircase that went around the edge of the room to her left, across the room she saw a huge floor to ceiling window, many bookcases lining the walls and a fireplace to the left of the window that was surrounded with a couch, 2 chairs, a love seat, and a deep brown wooden coffee table.
Rolling her eyes Dracia began to explain to her friend how it had gone. She talked about the awkward meeting and explanation in the headmaster’s office, about Potter’s reluctant agreeance and the new dorm set up they had.
Hailey dropped her bag somewhere on the floor, kicked off her shoes and flopped onto her new bed as soon as she got back to her room.
The other room was functionally identical accept it was done in shades of green and black."You can have this one, the dark colours are way too depressing for me." Hailey said wrinkling her nose slightly.
With that final coherent thought Dracia fell into unconsciousness.
As it stands, I plan to keep Dracia's name as it is because I've come up with a really cool way to tie it into the story that I hope y'all will enjoy when I get to it.
"Why hello Minerva, Albus didn't inform me that you would be showing the children to their rooms!" the lady said warmly as she clasped her hands together, the stars on the dress seeming to shift as she did so.
"What is it Professor?" Hailey asked as the portrait shut behind them.
"Hailey," she said with pursed lips, " I'm aware that this is all very sudden, and you can't be happy with these arrangements, however; a veela's love for their intended is like no other, it is unconditional and pure. You have faced many hardships so far and at such a young age as well, I believe this could be exactly what you need, someone who will care for you when no one else can and support you when no one else will. Your history with Ms. Malfoy is, to put it lightly, rough and troubled but I ask you to try and see past that." McGonagall was now looking at her warmly and a with mild worry that a mother might show for a child.
Arlene made no comment on that but told her, “I’m going to Egypt today to check out that library.” She opened her suitcase and started putting clothes in. Then a thought crossed her mind. “If I’m only going for the library then why did he want me to pack?”
In the two hours that had passed the decorations had been expanded upon greatly. The tree no longer sat in the Great Hall. Garland had been draped all over the walls. Snowflakes had been enchanted to fall from the ceiling but disappeared a few feet above their heads. The tables had been pushed aside to make room for wooden arches that led from the entrance hall to the ballroom. These had also been decorated with Garland. The doors to the ballroom were wide open now but Arlene couldn’t see past them well enough to tell what was on the other side.
A red haired dragon worker called to her, “hey there. You were in the tournament right?” He was sitting upright in his bed with a cast on his arm and bandages wrapped around his chest.
This was one of the harder ones. Arlene’s mind went blank. She had no idea what the answer to this could be. Even thinking about it non-literally was too hard. There were too many options when thinking from one perspective that didn’t match up with the others. No answer came to her. The knocker even giggled at her and teased, “am I off my game now?”
Her hand fell. Arlene had to swallow before saying, “I wanted a space just for the two of us. Where we could do couple stuff…”
Professor Flitwick nodded in agreement then said, “so on a lighter subject, how are your classes going?” He leaned back in his chair to relax.
Arlene felt her eyes on her but she just kept looking at her food. After lunch she had two free periods so she went to the hospital wing. She didn’t know why. For some reason she felt like it was important for her to go see what had happened. It might have something to do with her being in the tournament that led to so much pain. It might’ve been guilt at coming out unscathed when others had been gravely injured.
Joan smiled at them but flicked her wand at their own wood pile. It caught fire instantly. A full two minutes later, Author got the lighter to ignite but was so excited he dropped it. He picked it back and started over. Ginny gave Arlene a pleading look but she couldn’t do anything to help her. A minute later the man got the lighter working again and this time managed to light the fire. He raised his hands and cheered, “Completely muggle-like!”
Arlene pulled aside the neckline of her robes far enough to reveal the chain going along the side of her neck. Luna nodded in approval.
She walked out into the sunlight with her boar. The massive black dragon looked at her. She expected a roar but it did not come. Instead the beast cocked it’s head at her and sniffed the air.
She ate the cookie only to be approached by Draco. He said, “Arlene, I found something that you might be interested in.” He looked around and leaned in to whisper, “there’s a room that only appears for those in need. It might help you and Luna have some time away from judging eyes. Seventh floor, walk past a tapestry of someone trying to teach trolls to dance three times while thinking hard about what you want.”
Adrian Pov.
Hogwarts blood drive!
Drowsiness draught.
Harry nodded and went on with his explanation, “we read it and found that the moving on champions don’t have to be from a certain school. We can flood the last trial with the three of us.” He held up his hand. “Then the two of us throw in the towel and let Ron win the ten thousand and help his family.”
Ginny reeled back slightly. She didn’t know what to say. Then all the pieces came together and it actually made sense. “I can see that. I guess you two want to go to the ball together but don’t want to piss off all the assholes here?”
Arlene cocked her head and asked, “what is spew?”
“Exactly!” Ginny had never resented Luna for the things that happened with the Chamber of Secrets. It had been a shock when she first found out for sure but that didn’t make it her fault. No one could’ve stopped the events of her first year except for whoever put the book in her cauldron.
Ginny was the one to knock but Hagrid didn’t respond. She knocked again. No sounds came from the inside of the hut. Not even the booming barks of Fang. Luna peeked into the window and informed them, “just as I suspected, he isn’t here.” She pulled away from the window and suggested, “maybe the Quidditch field?”
Her hands glowed of their own accord. She flung them forward and a gust of wind picked up the monsters and flung them over the hedgerow.
Professor McGonagall came in and shouted, “that was the worst display of behavior I have seen in my entire career here.” She turned to the adults, “you are grown men and women fighting like toddlers in front of students who look up to you for guidance. Yet you ignore the desires of the only person who handled things well in my opinion.” She turned to Arlene and told her, “for someone who got thrown into this without consent you handled yourself well. Some of the adults in this room could learn from your example.”
Arlene got Hebridean Black. One of the dragons native to Great Britain.
Just then Sirius yelled out, “ambush!”
The dragon handlers moved the last dragon into position. A minute later the last champion walked into the arena. Jules Bastion held his head and wand high. He walked to the middle of the arena. He pointed the wand at himself and mouthed a spell he couldn’t hear.
The three of them left two hours before the ball was supposed to start to get ready. She put on her blue dress. Luna helped her put her hair in a thick braid down her back. Luna put on a frilly, yellow dress and had her hair done in a half up half down style. She had a bun on the back of her head but with half her hair still coming down her back. Luna also put two small sunflowers in her hair.
He flicked his wand at the quidditch field and said, “accio broom.” Then he answered her, “a mix of apparation and flying. I’ll apparate us to Giza then we will fly to Alexandria.” He pointed his wand at her suitcase and asked, “mind if I shrink it so it’s easier to carry?” She nodded and he tapped her suitcase with his wand. It shrank to pocket size and she put it away.
Luna laughed full heartedly and gave her a kiss. She pulled away and told her, “I’m not upset either. It’s been an odd day. Let’s go to bed.”
He made his way along and noticed a unique one. It was tall with a statue of the reaper next to it. As he approached he saw the words:
Ginny was telling them, “a dragon’s eyes are the weakest spot on it. The underbelly is also quite weak.” She turned a page. “Unless the species they get has a chest plate of scales for protection.” She ran a hand through her hair.
He left the hospital wing while reciting a mantra in his head. Don’t murder. Don’t murder. Don’t murder.
“Hey,” Charlie started happily then winced. He clutched at his ribs. After a second he said, “I’m glad my sister is making friends here. How is she? I rarely get to see her because of work.”
She didn’t want to bring up the person that pushed Luna so she just shrugged and said, “not all that interesting. Saw some Bicorns during Care of magical creatures. Hagrid is a good teacher.” She sat next to Professor Winters on the tiers.
That was why he was glaring at the goblet. He knew something possibly evil and definitely selfish was lurking in that thing.
She had no idea if they were trying to be funny or not. She simply did what most people would do and stared at them with wide eyes in surprise.
So all that worrying didn’t matter? Great. Next time she was going to put on whatever she wanted. Professor McGonagall got everyone’s attention by saying, “attention students. After we go over the rules then you can go down to the village.” She went over the rules. All of them. At the end she told them, “go out and have fun but be safe. Now, nice and orderly, go on.”
He saw her run ahead of him and pick up the jar. He tried to reach for his wand but couldn’t find his pocket or think of a spell humane enough to use on her. Unable to think of anything else to say he yelled, “two hundred points from Gryffindor!”
It twitched a hand in a gesture to come closer. He kept his wand raised but stepped towards it. He asked it, “are you Voldemort?” The thing nodded then weakly waved it’s arms in a pleading gesture of mercy. “I have no plans to kill you yet. I want answers. I want to know if those I care for are in danger.”
It sort of worked. He summoned something but it wasn’t Death. It called itself Abaddon, and claimed to be a spirit demon. Adrian made a deal with it. In exchange for his animal spirit the demon would give him the power to kill Michael. So he returned to the camp and demanded a rematch. This time he won and that was how he freed himself and the others from the camp.
Adrian sat at the table with them and explained, “we do the ritual in a cage. When big bad comes out of the cauldron he’ll be in the cage. The cage will be enchanted to prevent disapparition. We force him to drink truth potion before answering any questions. Then we get the answers we need.” He pulled a glossy brown block from his pocket and explained, “no risks, I’ll be placing this bomb under the cauldron. Buried in the dirt. If he tries to get out then we blow him back to Hell. I’m not letting the worst magical terrorist ever back out unless we prove his innocence.”
Joan smirked, “There, you’ve been injured for the year. Now it won’t happen again.” She giggled at him while he glared at her.
With her magic she was learning how to temporarily boost her physical abilities. Her strength and speed she could almost double. She was getting better at improving her eyesight and hearing. She could even improve her sense of smell.  Joan was ecstatic with her progress.
She focused her will as she mimed a crushing motion with her hands. A crack formed along the spider’s shell lengthwise. Her breath came in gasps. She could feel her mind and muscles struggling to complete the task. With one final effort she pulled her hands away from each other. The spider’s body began to rip and tear. The body split down the middle and the two halves flew away from each other. They crashed through the hedges to land on the opposite sides.
She was amazed by it and commented, “that’s so cool.” She followed Adrian and the uniformed man in. They checked in at the main desk and he talked with the staff for a few minutes. They went to the third floor and entered a room. As soon as they entered the room he began waving his wand everywhere.
She held up a copy of the Quibbler. “I want your dad’s magazine to feature an article on the oppression of House Elves.” She made a face at it. “I don’t quite agree with most of the articles he does.” Her gaze focused back to Luna. “You’re my last resort though. No other newspaper or magazine will take me seriously.”
Arlene felt most of her frustration dissipate with those words. It was good to know that someone was looking out for her. That someone had her back. Her adoptive parents and Professors McGonagall and Flitwick were on her side. She felt good about this. If any team of people could find a loophole in the rules then it was them.
He answered her, “three nights. One for the journey and two for research. Then I’ll bring us back here.”
The hall shook with cheers as students rejoiced in the rule change. Students from all tables stood up and screamed with happiness. Arlene and Luna laughed and shook their heads at them. It seemed such a silly thing to be cheering about. After nearly two minutes the students finally calmed down.
She looked at the boy and answered, “fight with Potter? I’ll see to it then.” Joan didn’t miss the tired look in her eyes. Regardless, she took the student from her and let her leave the office.
Luna cheerfully tried to lighten his mood with, “we are Neville. You don’t have to be sad anymore.” They sat down and she added, “why are you sad?”
Before she could ask what was going on Hermione blurted out, “I just want to say that I don’t like this but I think it’s for a good cause.” She crossed her arms and didn’t say anything else.
Rusu, the girl who had sat behind her last night sneered at her and said, “not much to compete against there.”
Bastion and Arlene sat down. Time passed as the usual sounds came from the stadium. Fleur was gone longer than the others had been but she came back unharmed with her egg. She told them, “I made it sleep. I got by just fine.”
Dumbledore shook his head. “I’m losing trust in Mr. Barnes. I might have to kill him. He did do what I wanted and resurrected Voldemort but I wanted them to fight. The fact that they didn’t makes me distrust him.” He stood up. Lucius swallowed in fear. “Voldemort is no longer under my control. This is not good. If he gets word out of what I did to him then all my plans will be destroyed. I cannot allow that. I must find him and put him back under the imperius curse as soon as possible.”
Arlene Pov.
They moved on and reached their seats. The stadium was massive. Thousands of wizards cheered and screamed from the seats. They were high enough to be on top of a skyscraper. Ginny and Arlene had been here last year but this year it seemed to be even bigger. The Irish did some fireworks that formed into a dancing leprechaun. Then the Bulgarians did their intro. It was hard to see from this distance. Several figures walked out onto the field. She couldn’t see them very well but Adrian and Author said, “uh oh,” at the same time.
She put away her magazine and responded, “that would be great. Let’s go down to the Great Hall to talk it over.”
They were soft and gentle. Luna smelled great. The light scent of butterbeer and hazelnut. Luna didn’t push too hard. Her hands were gentle on hers. Her skin was soft. It was over after a few seconds. As Luna pulled away she felt her knees wobble. Her hand shot out to catch herself on the fence.
“I’m going to assassinate Dumbledore.”
“Is it really a good idea to go resurrecting the guy who started a war long ago?”
They both said in unison, “you’re welcome.”
He smiled and raised his hands in an innocent gesture. He said in a carefree tone, “fine headmaster. Have it your way. Play your little game.” He turned away and said aloud, “don’t you all have better things to do than stare at me?” He walked out of the great hall. Once he was out of sight and hearing of everyone he kicked a suit of armor down and screamed, “MOTHER FUCKERS! GODDAMN SONS OF BITCHES! FUCKING FUCK!” He sat down and muttered, “I can’t watch another daughter die.”
Ginny only had to read a few lines to see what it was about. Somehow that bitch from the Daily Prophet had found out that Arlene couldn’t use her wand. She didn’t say anything about her unique magic though. Ginny’s vision went red for a second before she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder. He told her, “I know you’re angry. I am too. We need to find Arlene and tell her before she finds out this way. Right now she needs the support of her friends more than revenge.”
Sirius looked at him and asked, “you believe me?”
BEFORE YOU READ!!!!!!!!!
It was obvious right away that the book wasn’t written by someone who was fully sane.
Arlene Pov.
The alchemist lowered his wand with a sigh. “Full marks, Miss Connery.” He sat down and added, “class dismissed.” He gave a subtle thumbs up to her from behind the desk.
Joan began putting him on it as he did the more gruesome of the tasks: retrieving the leg. He walked up to the stunned dragon’s mouth. The jaws hung half open so he pushed them open and reached in. The breath was foul but he had to push past it. He conjured a sheet and wrapped up the limb in that before pulling it all the way out. He set it on the stretcher next to him.
“I still expect her to scold us for something we did.” The twins were trying to make light of the situation. It worked partially.
Hagrid turned to the boy who had pushed her in and said, “that was very rude of you. Let’s go have a chat with Professor Flitwick.”
You were thinking about it before you pushed her away.
Luna told her, “Arlene, please don’t do anything rash. I don’t want to see you get in trouble.” She took Arlene’s hand and gave her a sweet smile. “It’s not worth getting in trouble over.”
Mr. Crouch explained, “Krum blinded his dragon. It worked until it started flailing wildly. He got swiped by one of the flails. Luckily it was just a glancing blow.” That made her more afraid. That was glancing? She was afraid to see what a real hit would do. Mr. Crouch went on anyway, “They attempted to stun it but we less than successful. The dragon was conscious enough to blow fire at one of the handlers. He will survive. Both of them will survive.” He gave them an attempt at what was supposed to be a smile and said, “the worst is passed. You will both be fine.” He left them alone in the tent.
“NO!” Professor Karkaroff yelled. “Only one Durmstrang student moves on while all three of the ones from Hogwarts move on? I smell a scam, Dumbledore.” He was glaring at the headmaster.
Arlene felt herself tense up. Adrian didn’t hesitate, “I held off the jerks long enough for everyone to escape.” She knew what he likely did to hold them off but he didn’t want to make it public knowledge. She understood why he did it. He had no choice in a battle of life or death against people who loved to kill. She knew he hated it but was one of the best at it.
Cheers rained on him as stunning spells rained on the dragon. He felt bad about stealing one of the dragons eggs. Even if it was fake. The whole trial was cruel to the poor animals. He left the stadium. He didn’t want to see any more of it. He just wanted to win and make his family richer.
Arlene felt her whole body relax as she held them. The last she had seen of them they had running into a burning field filled with magic terrorists. She hadn’t realized how much seeing them alive and well would make her feel better.
As the last rays of light disappeared behind the mountains they returned to the castle. Under the cover of darkness they kept holding hands. When they entered the torchlight they were reluctantly forced to separate. The social repercussions of being openly gay in this time would not be pleasant. They would have to hide it for now.
As they approached the home a shrill, shriek rent the night’s silence. Mrs. Weasley ran over to them and did the best she could to hug them all at once multiple times. The whole time going on about what she had heard. “I’m so glad to see you all alive. It’s just terrible what I heard.” She even hugged Arlene and Luna. “You all need to get inside. I’ve made tea for everyone.”
Her heart beat picked up again. She had a strong feeling about what was going to happen. She closed her eyes and waited. A second later two soft hands took hers. Then two lips pressed against hers.
“Uh, yes. Yes!” A huge smile shone on his face. “Thank you, thank you so much.” A look of worry crossed his face and he said, “I have to go prep my dress robes.” He stood up while telling them, “I’m sorry. I’ll see you at the ball Ginny. Thank you.” He ran towards the castle. They saw him jump for joy at one point.
Joan told them, “Thank you. This is a relief to both of us.” Everyone in the family knew about Adrian’s past and didn’t want to put him through the stress of watching another child being in danger.
He rolled his shoulders and let out a deep sigh. Barty Crouch knew nothing of spirit demons so he couldn’t understand that Dumbledore had just consumed the one that had been residing in the Goblet of Fire. A rather weak one but it still held power enough to help Dumbledore.
Fred gave him a half smile and responded, “you’d think she’d be happy to see her sons either way.”
She watched Adrian walk out of the hall. Feeling defeated she walked forward and took the slip of paper from Dumbledore. Her name was on there. She pointed out, “this isn’t my handwriting.”
They were lined up at the closer end of the field. There was a fence with nine gates currently closed. Each contestant got a gate and Mr. Bagman said, “wait here. We’ll begin shortly.” Then he hurried off. Arlene’s only relief was that her ability to increase her strength and speed with magic would be perfect for this course. That was the only relief she had.
Adrian was pleased with her abilities in Alchemy. Luna was just behind her. Third year was getting into new and exciting things. Mixing more complex items and performing multiple transmutations at a time. Even changing one element into another.
He and Joan sat next to each other. Dumbledore walked in and announced, “welcome everyone to the start of an exciting new year. Does anyone have anything to say before we get started?”
They reached greenhouse three for Herbology a few minutes before it began. None of the other students made eye contact with them. Professor Sprout entered and announced, “good morning students. Welcome back for an exciting year. Who’s ready to get started?” There was mixed response. She carried on unhampered, “let’s get started with today’s lesson.”
Yes, he called her mudblood.
The next day at breakfast they got their first schedules for the semester. First was care of magical creatures. Their second class was herbology. The rest of the day was wand based lessons. Arlene of course had her own magic lessons during that time.
Adrian nodded and explained, “I’m just here for the graveyard. There’s someone I need to visit.”
A thought entered his mind. Do you ever care about Lily’s happiness? He shook it off. She would’ve been much happier with him over Potter.
She squeezed Luna’s shoulder. “I will be. I’ll walk out, don’t worry.” Outside the window the sun was setting. The time was near. They kissed and left dormitories. They went to the Quidditch field where the hedges had finished growing. They now towered at nearly seven meters tall. Or twenty feet.
Every nerve in her body had been on edge and now joy spread to every corner of her being. A smile of joy and shock grew on her face uncontrollably. In an instant everything about the world seemed so much more beautiful. She responded, joy on every word, “Luna, I love you too! You don’t know how happy you just made me!”
Luna told Arlene, “This seems quite silly don’t you think?”
A monstrous spider was crawling along the top of the hedges. All eight of its eyes were locked on her. It began moving down the wall at her. Her hands flew up and gold fire shot from them. She focused it enough so it didn’t set the hedges ablaze. The fire struck the spider but it dissipated away. The exterior shell was too strong to be lit on fire. The monster hit the ground and loomed over her.
She went to that one and burst through the door. Right in the middle of the room was Arlene with Luna trying to comfort her. She walked forward and asked, “have you seen it?”
Harry had neat yet modest dress robes. Krum was wearing dress robes that resembled a uniform. It fit him well and every detail had been paid attention to. Ron’s robes were…old fashioned. Hermione had undergone a massive change. She wore well applied make up, a beautiful dress, and had even put in fancy earrings.
Before they left the jerk Ravenclaw boy, who I refuse to name, came by and coughed, “losers,” into his hand.
He stopped finger brushing his beard with wide eyes. That was not what he had been expecting. “Aren’t there some steps in between starting dating and sex? I’ve been out for a while but I don’t remember it that way.”
Arlene rubbed at her chin. She hadn’t had a chance to look at the books from the Library of Alexandria yet. She had been so occupied with how to defeat a dragon. When the second trial was over she would look in those first.
Arlene raised a hand and asked, “this is great and all but where is this going?”
They reached Professor Sprout’s office, the boy was in Hufflepuff, and she told him, “I don’t know and I honestly don’t care. You’re smart enough to know you can’t throw curses down the hallway.” They found Professor Sprout trimming a plant on her desk. Joan explained, “he got into a fight with Potter. I’ve already got my plate full of detention. Can you talk to him or something, please?”
Arlene left the hospital wing unaware of her surroundings. It hadn’t been until now that she thought about the others’ motivations for the tournament. Everyone who had entered had a reason to do so.
Arlene Pov.
He looked to Arlene and told her, “two of the books are just fifty Galleons to copy each. The third is a restricted book but we can keep it at the beach house without trouble. It costs five thousand to copy though. He didn’t know why it was so expensive.”
Krum got a Norwegian Ridgeback. Harry had seen a baby of this breed back in his first year when Hagrid tried to keep one as a pet.
Fred warned her, “might want to clear out.”
Ginny turned to look at Luna who said, “congratulations on getting a date. What inspired you to ask him?”
The magical community had no need for blood donations due to potions that could magically help injured people regrow blood faster. Muggles weren’t so lucky. Of all the things she had expected to see at this school this was the last.
He nodded. “Not my best idea by far.” He slowly approached Arlene and sat next to her on a chair. “Arlene, I want you to understand why I got so upset about you being in this tournament.” He swallowed as he searched for words.
He looked Draco in the eyes. Those beautiful, green eyes. “I’ve seen you as a rival or a bully for so long. You came around though.” Harry looked around. Then seeing no one took his hand. Draco sucked in a breath. “I can’t say I love you yet but I want to go out with you. I want to try to have a relationship with you.” For the first time during his talk Harry blushed. “You have really great hair after all. You’re actually a very well-mannered and nice person now that we’re friends.”
Adrian reached the door and found it open. He illuminated his wand as he moved inside. The house was dusty with sheets covering the furniture. The light he had seen was on the second floor. He moved room to room keeping his wand raised and the shield spell on his lips. He wanted to be able to defend himself fist and attack second.
Luna smirked at her and pointed out, “I know you love butterbeer.”
Another roar sounded from outside followed by cheering from the crowd. Arlene tried to swallow her fear but only got saliva. Then Mr. Bagman returned and said, “the contest is about to begin. Please follow me to your spots.”
As usual, no offense is meant but if I did then I do apologize.
She stopped to help her up. The masked figures began advancing on the two of them. Luna got to her feet but the tent next to them exploded in flames. Arlene readied her magic to fight. Then a figure leaped from the burning fight and began to fight all five of the men in front of her. Adrian Barnes held off the attackers long enough for her and Luna to escape.
The biggest issue was that none of them knew what the goal of the trial was. Did they have to get past a dragon? Was is a straight up duel with a dragon? Was it a team effort or were they alone? Did they just have to tickle a sleeping dragon and live? None of them knew.
He pushed gently, “He’s dead now if that helps. I just need the father’s name. The blood father. If I can get that then I’ll be satisfied.” He smiled at her.
Luna smiled and explained, “I think I’m different.” Arlene’s heart cracked until she went on. “I don’t have a preference either way. I do know there is someone I want to be romantically involved with.”
She looked up to see more owls descending towards her and Luna. Looking at the Gryffindor table she saw some owls charging at Hermione. Luna began grabbing letters and burning them with her wand. No more howlers burst at their table.
This thought intruded upon an otherwise boring history of magic lesson. History of magic was supposed to be one of the most interesting subjects. Learning the history of the thing that pulled her from poverty and abuse should’ve been super interesting. Especially to her since her family was doused in mysterious history. The thing was that history of magic was taught by the only thing in the entire universe that could possibly make it boring. The entire history of all things magical and beautiful was taught by someone who had quite literally bored himself to death. Who was so plain and boring that he died and didn’t even realize it. He seemed determined to do the same to literally every other creature in the universe.
Luna giggled. Arlene opened her eyes slowly to look on her love. The girl she loved. The girl who loved her back.
This pattern continued with the next Durmstrang champion being Marius Stan.
They walked up to the desk while Arlene gawked at everything. Adrian spoke in Arabic to the librarian. She heard her surname in the conversation so he was likely asking about information for her. Which is why they went there.
Arlene nodded. She already knew what it was. She joined them on the floor. It was very clean since it was cleaned daily but never used. Ginny did note that Arlene hadn’t been crying. She wasn’t sure if that was from inner strength or bottling up her emotions. Maybe the article hadn’t affected her that much. She asked, “what are you thinking?”
The knocker audible growled at him but the door swung open. She went in and told Adrian, “thanks.”
His wrinkles faded down to mere crow’s feet at his eyes. His hair and beard shrunk down to a manageable size as they both turned brown. Muscle returned to his hands. His bony hands regained their youth.
Madam Rosmerta came by then. Before she started taking their orders she asked Arlene, “how are you doing? Staying out of trouble?”
Luna returned the smile and said, “hey, I like your clothes.” She shrugged and admitted, “then again, I like anything you wear.”
For the whole month of January Arlene and her friends spent every moment not in class, on homework, sleeping or eating on finding ways for Arlene to defeat a dragon. Yet despite all their efforts nothing was coming up. Arlene’s inability to use a wand was hindering her greatly as most methods involved using a wand.
Arlene was still happy with this. Just the fact that her answers could exist was more information than she had before. Finding someone who had been there before wouldn’t be too hard. Between her adoptive parents it was likely one of them had been. They hadn’t let her down yet. “This is great. Thank you professor.”
The tentacles reached out and wrapped around him. A voice sounded in his head and the water and his body and his soul. “You must see, Severus Snape. You must see the reality. Hell is here and you’re all knee deep in it” Then his subconscious remembered he was underwater and he started to drown.
He answered, “be better if I hadn’t spent the last few days wrangling wild dragons. Especially nesting mothers.” He drew his wand and stood in front of them.
They walked down to Hagrid’s hut. Grubbly-Plank was waiting outside the hut. When she saw them walking up she commented, “I only wanted you, Winters. We shouldn’t need Barnes.”
Both of the Beauxbatons champions looked to Arlene and Luna and immediately gasped in surprise. They both left their partners to rush forward. Jules Bastion told them, “how wonderful, I didn’t know that the school was allowing for same-sex partners. That’s cool.”
All her quirks were great too. The creatures she referenced all the time. How no matter what happened she always had a positive attitude. Her foresight was very helpful even if it was out of her control and inconsistent. Luna was the friendliest person she had ever known in her entire life. There was nothing she did that wasn’t graceful or adorable.
At the end of that week she braved her parents. She stayed back after an Alchemy class to talk to Adrian. She walked up to his desk. There was no way he would handle this well. There was no way to put it gently. She asked, “dad, how do I fight a dragon?”
The entire room froze at the mention of the name Connery. Every house elf turned to look at her with big eyes. Then they swarmed towards her. She backed up as they rushed at her. Despite their short legs they surrounded her. Then they began cheering.
She went down towards the Great Hall but found the two people she was looking for before she got there. Fred and George were hiding something behind a suit of armor when she found them.
“I get that.” He pulled a lighter from his pocket. “This is much more efficient though.” He flipped it open and lit it. “Completely muggle and an improvement over matches.”
There had to be a bigger resource of information out there. There had to be a larger library somewhere. Somewhere that hadn’t been tampered with. She went to the only Professor who didn’t have a class right now or in the case of Joan, sleeping in preparation for her night class.
They thanked him and left. The trio made their way up to the top of the astronomy tower to knock on her office door. Joan opened the door with a Santa hat on her head. “I had a feeling you would show up here soon.” She handed Arlene a box and gave Luna and Ginny a bar of chocolate each. Arlene gave her another amulet in a box.
Arlene pushed her cart through the barrier to platform nine and three quarters. She emerged onto the platform to see the beautiful, shining, red steam engine warming up for departure. She loved the sight of it. She rolled her cart towards the crowd as Remus Lupin and the other kids from the beach house entered the platform.
A crash jolted Arlene from her reverie. A weak hoot came from the window as an old owl flapped in and landed on the table. A cluster of letters that resembled a novel were tied to its leg.
Arlene shook her head. “No, she really wanted to talk to Harry. I’m hoping she ignores me.” Arlene seemed bored. As if she would be almost anywhere but here. “Joan, I really need to talk to you after this.”
Arlene glanced at her and said, “Luna, I don’t think you could judge someone negatively if you wanted to.” She leaned against the fence and trusted Luna with her secret. “I think I would prefer a girlfriend. I’ve just never been attracted to boys. Some girls or women I like.” It felt good to say. She hadn’t been entirely sure until recently. Letting it out for the person she loved was good to say. Luna still didn’t know who Arlene loved but at least she knew that Arlene wasn’t straight.
Harry Pov.
Arlene didn’t want to brag but five thousand wasn’t a lot to her. Especially to learn more about her family’s history. She told him, “I can pay.” She pulled out her check book and wrote one for five thousand and one hundred Galleons to copy the three books.
Draco just stood by him and shuffled his feet. He didn’t seem to want to be with Lucius. Then his father looked to him and said, “Draco?” His expression shifted. It went from arrogance to one of concern. He glanced down at the Weasleys and Arlene’s family. Lucius then did something curious. He walked away and led Draco with him.
It spanned his whole desk. It showed the color of the land and the ocean. The whole image showed incredible realism. Even the clouds were shown in real time. At least if appeared so. The clouds over the northern half of the United Kingdom were smaller versions of what she was seeing out the window.
Once the shock wore off he raised his wand and yelled, “Accio Firebolt!”
Ten minutes later Mr. Bagman clapped his shoulder and told him, “you’re up Mr. Weasley.”
The elevator ride down took about ten minutes. The doors opened to a magical sight.
Snape’s mouth worked but no words came out. Draco held his ground but was still afraid of him lunging at him. The seconds passed as his heart beat loudly in his ears. Blood rushed through his body afraid of the pain that might come next.
The dragon reached out while trying to catch the fake eggs. Some of the copies grabbed the fake eggs and ran away with them. The dragon picked one and chased after it.
Bastion used the distraction to grab the real golden egg. He wasted no time in running away from the chaos. Then something flashed and hit the dragon. It screamed in pain as the copies faded. Only Bastion was left as the dragon raged. Something from the outside had enraged it.
Arlene was trying to think of elements that she could use that would hurt a dragon but not the audience. Not much sprang to mind. Not much that she could use easily. Most of it was the fact that she could only carry a pocket full of it. Not even that much phosphorus would blind a dragon for long. Especially if she was alone.
He spat back, “are you suggesting something Mad Eye?”
“Nah,” George agreed with his brother. “She’ll find out soon enough.”
In the sixties the ministry and the Connery family began a new age of rivalry. The ministry is still pushing for restrictions against magical beasts and some even desire more slaves like the house elves. The Connery family stands against this of course. The two continue to argue back and forth with each other even to this year of 1979. The Connery family continues to hold their ground but the sinister aspects of the ministry continues to press their selfish agenda against them.
She started with the smallest one, which was a gathering of information on beasts’ rights in the past few centuries. After a few chapters she didn’t find anything that she didn’t already know. Her family helped beasts’ have more rights. Right now she wasn’t in a prime position to do that. She set that one aside and moved to the next book.
Luna’s eyes opened wide. “you used fire in the first trial. How can a squib use fire if the rest of the world doesn’t know she has a special magic?” She gained a mischievous smirk that was un-Luna-like.
“Good.” Dumbledore sat down. “I did so much here to make sure the right people were at the graveyard tonight. I had to put the imperius curse on Victor Krum and have him attack Miss Delacour. I tried to get the last of the Connery line out of the way but she managed to survive somehow.” He stroked his beard. “You are excused. Good work. Without you getting someone to spy on Mr. Barnes I would’ve never been able to crash his party. I did lose Mr. Weasley in the process. It will fuel Harry more so I can use it to my advantage.” Lucius nodded and left the room. Dumbledore motioned to him and said, “you can come out now.”
Grubbly-Plank pointed to Hagrid and Adrian to tell them, “you two stay back.” She lowered her hands and said, “Winters, we’ll talk strategy.”
The knocker responded, “a woman shoots her husband, then holds him underwater for five minutes. Next, she hangs him. At the end of all that, they enjoy a lovely dinner. How could they do this?”
Arlene told him, “I can’t leave you here to fight all by yourself!”
“Uh,” she was at a loss for words. Their more memorable meeting had been awkward at best. They had met when a crazed madman had kidnapped her. Adrian had caught up to him and broke his broom midair. By the combination of their magics they survived the fall and landed right in front of the Three Broomsticks. She had come out just in time for the madman to show back up. Adrian and him fought. It was close but Adrian won with the help of Arlene. She didn’t want to relive the whole experience right now so she decided to tell the abridged version.
He began telling them how to approach them. They could charge if easily startled. The fence was strong enough to hold them back so there was no danger to the students. A slow, quiet approach while in full visual view was enough to keep them calm. Hagrid got them some hay to feed to them and showed them how to change the water in their troughs.
Cheers and roars followed. It sounded like the others. Until something changed dramatically. The cheers turned into screams of horror. The roar turned louder and shook the tent.
Ten minutes later Mr. Crouch told Fleur that it was her turn.
They combed through books looking for anything pertaining to her specific family. It was a long search. True to Arlene’s prediction, Ireland had many families with the last name of Connery. It took some sorting to find the books that pertained to her specifically. They spent hours pouring over the books. Almost all of them were in English.
On the other hand there were plenty of madmen and women in politics. Assassinations had been done before for trivial things. Politicians had been killing each other over small problems for centuries. The corrupt and inept found it favorable to actually doing their jobs.
They had to go then. Several students came by them and congratulated them on their bravery. Students from all houses. Some of the staff too: Flitwick, McGonagall, Hagrid and others. Even Filch came by and congratulated them. Almost all of the ghosts did as well, a few told them it was a sign of the times progressing to a brighter future.
They walked to the Ravenclaw common room and faced the knocker that was proof that Rowena Ravenclaw hated the idea of students getting to bed on time. It spotted Arlene and spat, “oh, the smart one. How about this riddle? I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body but come alive with the wind. What am I?”
The next day Draco Malfoy was making his way towards the Great Hall for dinner. He spotted Harry and the others at Gryffindor table. He made his way over to them. His heart beat rapidly in his chest. He rubbed the sweat from his palms as he walked between tables. Remembering the words he had practiced was becoming harder as he got closer. Then he was there.
It was a flower. A simple blue flower that to the naked eye had nothing odd or abnormal about it. It grew from a brown pot. The only use it had would be as a gift. Even then it would die soon. Unless someone subjected it to alchemy.
Barty left the room faster than he normally would have. He went over to the fireplace and used it to Floo his way back home.
Arlene Pov.
Professor McGonagall was yelling across the hall, “get in line, be orderly!” The assembly was already moving outside. They stood outside and got lined up. Then the waiting began. The weather outside was nice at least. They had to stand outside for a while.
She pulled her hand away and started walking towards the backroom. She felt every eye in the room on her. Part of her wished Adrian had fought harder against this. At the same time she knew he shouldn’t make outbursts like that. She passed by Professor Karkaroff who didn’t even acknowledge her.
Only he didn’t go about planning his next lessons. He went down to the edge of the grounds and apparated to where Remus and Sirius were living with Harry Potter.
Arlene felt a tug at her sleeve. She looked over to see Luna pointing out the door of the Great Hall. “Can we talk for a second?”
It would be another hour before Arlene’s eyes opened. When they did, she was confused on her surroundings for a bit. Then she remembered where they were. It was near the end of summer and they were at the four hundred and twenty second Quidditch world cup final.
Dumbledore entered the room and pulled Harry Potter from the clutches of Skeeter. Then began the weighing of the wands ceremony. She felt a thrill of panic but it vanished when she saw Arlene had her wand. That might be what she wanted to talk about later. Arlene couldn’t use her wand. She would have to find a way to hide her magic or solve the trials without using magic. Then again if she wanted to flop out of the tournament anyway failing the first trial would be a good way to do it.
His back still felt like it was one fire but his robes had gone out when he was rolling. Ministry workers pulled him back into the tent as stunning spells rained on the angry dragon. The whole first row of the stadium was filled with Dragon handlers.
So it made sense that her mind drifted during this class. The realization came to her during one of her doze offs. She was in love with Luna Lovegood. Not the kind of love that you get between friends. The romantic variety was the one she felt for Luna. “Oh crap,” she muttered under her breath. Not in a bad way. She was just surprised.
Any other Death Eater would’ve slaughtered her while laughing. Why did he join them?
“Mr. Creevey, just call her my d… wait,” his words sank in. Especially the name he said. “Rita Skeeter?! Where?” She turned on the poor boy as he answered her question. She ran off without another word.
She looked at her with a raised eyebrow and said, “this was your idea.” Luna didn’t respond to that so she said, “We should see the sights first. I don’t want to carry stuff around all day.” After a moment she added, “maybe grab a butter beer at the Three Broomsticks.”
She told him, “she’s doing great. Her confidence is making a comeback. She’s very protective of me and Luna.” She put a finger on her chin and added, “she loves the bat bogey hex.”
Adrian Pov.
Then another one was dropped in her eggs. This one rose up on its own. A bang made her jump as it exploded leaving one screaming word ringing out, “bitch!”
His lips went tight and he walked away while levitating his metal rods. That almost confirmed that it was about the dragons. Arlene said, “they must be getting the holding areas ready for them early.” A flutter of fear floated through her as she thought of all the steps necessary to hold such powerful beasts. She knew she was going to have to face those monsters.
“You could get expelled!” He couldn’t believe that someone he had just admired the intelligence of thought it was a good idea to keep a person in a jar. He held it up over his head as she reached for it again. “What are you doing? I’m not letting you keep a human around.” He turned to walk away. Then he felt a spell hit him in the back.
His mind worked quickly. There was no way he could let Snape know his true nature. Maybe he could still play this to his advantage. He smirked. “You got me Professor. I’ll tell you this then. I’m playing Harry Potter to gain his trust and then lure him into a shameful situation which will forever put me above him. A quite ambitious feat but I believe I just might be able to pull it off.” He held his head high and adopted a cocky expression. It was a blatant lie but Professor Snape might like the idea so much that he would fall for it.
Luna supported her, “she has a point. Why do you even want to do the trial now?”
He walked up with a smile and said, “hey, I got a question.”
Any response was interrupted by a pop and a blue light appearing from behind some graves to their left. Adrian lifted his wand and barked, “kill anything that gets close to the cage.” He moved towards the light with the killing curse ready on his lips. This could not go wrong. They were playing with fire and already gas was being spilled around it.
That made Arlene feel better but she was still ready to go. They went back behind the stone building and he turned them invisible. They got on his broom. Adrian had the common sense to charm a seat for both of them so they would be comfortable. He took off and rose high in the air.
Arlene couldn’t respond at first. After a few seconds she was able to say, “it worked. It really worked.”
His sleep was not peaceful.
“I don’t want to worry you two.”
Luna laughed as they approached the tapestry, “what are you doing? We’re going to miss dinner.”
“Deal,” McGonagall said.
A new light shone in Harry’s eyes. Before they had been filled with despair and misery. Now hope and wonder shone as he gazed over the beautiful landscape. “I’m living the best life I could’ve hoped for with them. I’m treated like an actual person instead of a burden. My new parents love me. They knew I was gay from the start and accepted me for it.”
Heat and wind rushed by her. Even through her closed eyelids the light still hurt her eyes. The sound was nearly unbearable. It left her ears ringing and only barely able to hear. That didn’t stop them from running from the danger.
She left her compartment of the tent and zipped it back up behind her. The common area had a small kitchen and dining area. Most of it was rustic as her guardians didn’t bring too many modern amenities when camping. The most modern thing was a cooler that had been enchanted to keep cool without ice in it. There was a table set up as a countertop and a basin for washing food next to it. All the food was to be cooked on a fire outside.
Arlene gave Luna a box and Luna handed one to her. The box given to Arlene was wrapped in light blue paper. She pulled off the paper and opened the box. Inside she found a necklace. From first sight she could tell it had been homemade. Arlene didn’t know anything about jewelry but it was almost impossible for this to have come from a store.
Fred asked, “so, how did you use the fire in the first round then?”
“Yes.” Luna, cheerful as ever, said, “I didn’t see that one coming.”
Professor McGonagall insisted, “this is all well and sweet but she must get her rest. This has been a trying day for her.”
She nodded but wanted to look at the pyramids more. They were just so massive and majestic. Muggles had built these without any magic. Arlene didn’t believe in aliens either. It was all hard work and sweat. Hard work from a people that never got any credit for it. She then remembered that these were built by slave labor.
She told him, “I’m enjoying them. I chose Gobblygook, Care of magical creatures, and Alchemy as my elective classes this year. I’m passing them all.”
A door opened on the massive carriage and a thin boy in blue robes jumped out. He reached under the carriage and pulled out a set of golden stairs. Then stepped down a massive woman. Not massive in an insulting manner. She was tall. Taller than any human could be. She was at least as tall as Hagrid if not taller.
“The second troll has been blinded!” Lee was in love with giving the announcements.
Thirteen long years of grief.
For a second his eyes remained on the paper. He sat up and pulled one of his desk drawers open. He pulled out the things she was least expecting. He pulled a muggle handheld radio from it and told it, “Joan, I need you in my classroom. Family emergency.”
Adrian wasn’t so sure about that. “Maybe but there are ways to get rid of him without him ever seeing me.” He explained, “he can be eliminated with a muggle sniper rifle from a quarter a mile away and die before he even hears the shot fired. Wouldn’t trust poison. I think I would prefer sniping him. One shot for my last assassination.”
Then Lily chose Potter over him. Then they went and had that kid. That damn kid. The spitting image of his tormentor.
She got up and put the potion into a bottle. She had six bottles in all. Four of them were filled with the standard sleeping potion. She took the bottles to the Ravenclaw common room. She put two of the bottles in her trunk.
The old man responded, “Daniel. The last family that lived in that house got murdered. No one knows how it was done. Most don’t even think of it as a murder but I know one when I hear it.”
Fred rubbed his chin and said, “hmm, I don’t think so. Georgie?”
He answered, “the dirt on Dumbledore. He set up that dragon freak out right? I’ll tell you how he did it. I’ll tell you the why too.” His face betrayed nothing.
Arlene wasted no time and made the next two jumps. Then she made her last jump and reached for the wall. She poured extra strength into her fingers and latched on with a solid grip. Her feet skidded but found purchase in under a second. “Connery is the second to reach the wall! Followed by Krum and Weasley!”
It was still early but in her state of mind sleep would not return to her. She quietly left the room and went downstairs. There she found a tired and disheveled Author Weasley sitting at the dining room table. A cup of coffee sat in front of him. He looked at her over the bags under his eyes. “Hey, get any rest?”
Professor Flitwick patted her shoulder and told her, “you’re brave too.” After she was done the charms professor put a cookie in her hand and told her, “take it easy. You might be lightheaded for a few minutes.”
There was a knock at the door. She looked up to see Luna standing there. Arlene asked, “you live here, why did you knock?”
The Connery family might be the sole reason that life still exists on this little rock near this little star in this unimpressive galaxy. Others are afraid to write on the events of the war but not I! Thousands of years ago, before the written word, before wands. A lone wizard with a heart of evil and mind of intent came upon a dark being. An ancient evil that not even I, after decades of research, know the origins of. He opened himself to this darkness and allowed it to permeate him. He became god-like and an icon of evil.
Adrian left the school grounds as soon as possible. As soon as he could he apparated to the house Sirius and Remus lived at. In this part of the world it was still twilight. The sun was just disappearing under the horizon.
She put her wand away and finished her apple. Joan and Adrian came walking up then. They were complaining loudly, “I can’t believe some people take up all the space between tents. They all have charms to make the insides bigger but they still have to put things all over the public spaces.”
His enemy’s grip relaxed and he fell off of him. Adrian took the chance to catch his breath. He was behind a mausoleum so he was covered. He looked over to see Ron sending spells at the death eaters. He opened his mouth to say something until a flash of green stopped the words.
After the meeting they left the conference room and met up in the room at the top of the astronomy tower. The two of them sat on the tiers leading up to the window. He was considering all the horrible things that might happen to him this year. He had even been confident enough to leave his muggle firearms at home. Now he had learned that there was going to be a potentially deadly tournament happening involving the students. He wondered if any learning would ever happen at Hogwarts.
Adrian nodded. He turned to another page and read more, “as we hunted and dueled with the evil one his face became more evil. His bones and his skin betrayed the dark magics he used to become stronger.” Adrian skipped some pages. “Over the months he suffered three major changes: greenish skin, red irises, and flattening of the nose. We suspect that these are the result of soul splitting.”
“Thank you,” she put them on and informed him, “these fit perfect. The amulet I gave you will protect you from small dangers.”
He was forcefully jerked to the side and Joan hissed at him, “calm the fuck down. Put your wand away.” He looked down to see his wand was in his hand. He put it back in his pocket. “There are better ways to handle this than you looking like a psycho in front of the whole school.” He looked around and saw the horrified looks on everyone’s faces. Some of the faces from other schools looked insulted.
He explained, “she cast a curse at the dragon. She made it lose control. Probably for a story.”
Not sure of what to say she waved back to them and left the room in the most awkward way possible. She started walking backwards then to turn and walk out the right way. She then went to the library as she had planned.
The professors walked in. The headmaster seemed ecstatic about it and opened up with, “congratulations champions. I’m sure you’re all excited about the tournament.
She reached out with her mind like the time in the astronomy tower. She touched on the dragon’s mind instantly. She was calling out to her, “human friend? Human friend? Are you friendly human?”
She turned and grabbed the scepter she had been after. Other champions smart enough to capitalize on the situation began to grab their scepters. Harry and Ron got one each. Fleur and Krum each grabbed one. Jules Bastion of Beauxbatons was the last to grab a scepter.
Arlene sent her a message, “Yes, I just want the golden egg. It is a fake. No children are in it.” She was talking to a dragon. Then she realized that this was how it was done.
The dishes cleared and the headmaster stood up to give some words. “Welcome everyone back to an exciting year at Hogwarts. Our caretaker has asked me to remind you all that new items have been added to the prohibited list. You can see the whole list outside his office.”
Joan responded, not timidly, “what is Rita Skeeter the champion of? Lies and being queen bitch?” She eyed him without interest. “Bagman, you’re not a champion in a school contest.” She narrowed her eyes at him. “Move.” He got out of her way and cleared the way to Arlene.
“This leads into my next point that the ownership of slaves and widespread use of them is an economic choice. The ministry would rather use slave labor than admit the rights of beings they see as lesser than them are important. This means the ministry places financial gain over living beings.”
He sat back down. He wouldn’t have had to join them if she had just loved him.
They walked along the shore and she occasionally kicked rocks into the water. They didn’t speak many words until Luna asked, “who are you planning on going with?”
Adrian pointed down the row and said, “the signs up top say those pertain to the Irish families. Or at least the ones from the United Kingdom area.”
The rest of the hall had. Everyone’s attention had been diverted to Madam Pomfrey. After she told Dumbledore off the clatter of dropping silverware could be heard. Not a sound pervaded the room as she screamed her frustration on the headmaster. For the first time in Hogwarts’ history someone besides the headmaster had silenced the Great Hall.
Harry screamed, “YOU LIAR! Expelliarmis!” Voldemort turned to block the spell but didn’t launch any hostile spells at him. Adrian moved to intercept them but the death eaters had arrived.
In Dumbledore’s office he stood in the shadows watching the proceedings. Dumbledore sat at his chair. The Goblet of Fire sat on his desk. Lucius Malfoy stood in front of the desk. He was relaying the events of the night of the Dark Lord’s return.
He was grading some papers when there was a knock on his office door. He said, “enter.” Joan opened the door. He smiled at her and said, “let me finish these papers and I’ll do whatever you want me to do to you.”
She got under her covers and closed her eyes. Sleep came fast. Even in this new city and under a strange roof she felt safe just a few feet from her father figure.
A look of surprise appeared on his face. “She’s my younger sister. How do you know her?”
Ginny understood and said, “I’ll check the bathrooms.” She ran off to the nearest one. She mostly went off of memory and didn’t find her in any of them. Others called out to her as she ran but she didn’t stop for any of them. Only to ask if they had seen Arlene. None of them had.
George suggested, “tickling a sleeping dragon?”
So many years before that of pain and suffering.
She had just finished catching her breath from the last dance. She answered, “yes. I want to go see the decorations.”
She put away the books. The last one was thick and held no title. The outside was old, worn leather that was all black. She picked it up to consider it. This was the one that had been more expensive to copy. She rolled her shoulders and opened it.
Luna looked up and put a finger to her chin. She looked cute when she was thinking like that. “Maybe but I’d like to think not. He’ll be nervous but I don’t think that will slow him down for long. The first few lessons might be slow. Soon he will get his confidence back.” She smiled at Arlene.
