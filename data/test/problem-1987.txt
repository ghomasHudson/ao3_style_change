But the notion had speared itself into his mind and never quite left him alone ever since Harry had, in that magical grove under the warm midday sun, given them glimpses into his earlier adventures, told with a carelessness only made possible because they had miraculously not ended in death and disaster and their terror had been surpassed by far by the hardships he had gone through during the last years and especially the war.
Then she moved towards the front door of what looked as if it once had been a barn, trying to keep her outrageously expensive boots out of the various puddles in the courtyard.
"Blaise." Draco admonished with an amused chuckle and laid one hand on his fiancé's upper arm to pull him back against the back rest of his chair, before turning to their unwilling guest. "I grant you that it was naïve of us to believe that the Gryffindor role-model would follow without back talk, rule-breaker that you are. But Harry, you should have known better, especially after what we told you…"
expected him to have some hidden power; it wouldn't do to have a normal wizard with no unusual talents defeat his evilness, the lord Voldemort in person. But that was just what had happened, nothing more and nothing less. Well, of course one could argue that he hadn't killed Riddle, since he had pretty much killed himself when he had tried to murder the owner of the Elder Wand with the Elder Wand itself and died from the backlash.
His heart missed a beat for a moment. Was it possible to reject your inheritance? Could Potter simply ignore the changes he had gone through? What if he just never transformed again, never allowed himself to use more of his powerful magic or even had a specialist put a block on it?
When even after four hours, the diagnosis could not be verified and Mr Potter's condition worsened dramatically, the Healers had no other choice but to contact Mr Malfoy. According to our source, Mr Malfoy's son Draco, and his fiancé Blaise Zabini were lead towards Mr Potter's room shortly after that conversation and entered alone, refusing to be accompanied by the Healer in charge, Andrew Cowen. "Half an hour later, they ordered the hospital staff to send Mr Potter's friends away so that they could leave undisturbed, with an unconscious Harry Potter."
Soft lips brushed over the hollow of his throat enticingly, barely touching him at all, and he could feel warm breath caressing his sensitive skin, teasingly blowing over the wet trail that his lover's tongue must have left behind moments earlier, when his brain had still been too clouded by sleep to take notice. He could feel the little hairs on his skin rising in response with the pleasure of it and he arched upwards, seeking more contact, stretching his shoulders that itched with the need to release his wings.
Even then Taide hadn’t said anything at all, watching the drama unfold passively, choked with regret over how badly he had handled his attempt at rescue, with grief for the submissive’s pain, the two friends he had lost… and for the family that was dear to him, that he loved despite and with their errors.
Minutes later the two Slytherins led the way down a wide, elegantly curved staircase, along a short sand-coloured corridor and into the garden. Harry trailed behind them thoughtfully as he considered the tall figures before him.
And so he nodded once in acknowledgement and respect. It was a nice bit of magic and a very neat effect even if he couldn't imagine having much use for it, especially during a flying lesson
And that's what they made him feel: vulnerable. He didn't like it. And yet, their caresses, probably imbued with magic, soothed the last echoes of his headache and made him feel … well, it was just such an intimate gesture that seemed almost affectionate?
Hermione and his mother both looked up from where they sat close together at the table that was still covered with various documents and books. But in front of them, right above the copies of Hermione's precious texts of law, laid a copy of the Daily Prophet that must have arrived while Ron had been outside.
It wasn’t as if fleeing was an option anymore. Even if Taide had known where his wand was, the wards prevented apparition and the wrath of a submissive was said to be faster than lightning and deadlier than dragon fire.
Indeed. Where Potter was concerned, it should have only ever been Severus' duty to do what must be done and nothing more; to keep him alive and free. Of course the boy had done nothing to merit the treatment he had endured in his life, didn't deserved the kind of prison the Malfoys and Zabinis wanted to enclose him in. That still didn't mean that Severus should care about his happiness as well.
They were alone in the pleasantly tempered water, Harry having retreated into his rooms, tired from the accidental magic he had cast earlier and probably to escape their presence for a while. It was understandable and, to be honest, quite welcome as Blaise had found it increasingly difficult to stay calm around the Gryffindor.
Emotions mirrored within Harry himself. But it was a combination of feelings under which he had learned to still function, his body and mind operating at full stretch and so he used the moment of general stupor to his advantage as he whipped his fake wand into the direction of the other team’s players, managing to slow down first their opponent's Pihassan and then their shielder Abele before Piero could even react and attack again. But Harry had already managed to make them slow and defenceless, leaving them open for another ring-theft.
Eyes dry and hard and skin crawling with the surreal surety of what he was physically and emotionally able to do once again and at a moment's notice, Harry raised his gaze to his target, his magic lashing out inside of him against invisible shields, hissing, growling and trembling with the desire to attack like a lion clawing at the bars of its cage, like a mass of cobras and mambas threatening and striking at thin air, like tendrils of power whipping and darting around violently and unpredictably just as accrued electricity suddenly discharging in storm clouds.
Draco and Blaise looked up sharply at that, encountering the deep blue eyes that were darker than Draco's own and, despite the soft smile on the man's lips, couldn't be any graver. But before they had a chance to probe deeper, Amalyne interrupted them.
Besides, it might even unsettle Narcissa and Amalyne once they arrived, and any advantage in the upcoming confrontation was a welcome one.
The blonde lowered his gaze with a tiny, absent-minded smile. "No, I guess you are not. But since nothing here will be to your detriment, why don't you try to enjoy it?"
"That's it!" Draco said with evident eagerness. "Now you are properly equipped. And so we finally get to the fun part: the flying." Draco harrumphed slightly and automatically Blaise and Harry raised an equally exasperated look.
"You must understand that those laws are very old and one always must interpret those things with the respective societal background. Most traditions and believes of pureblood families and the wizarding community in Britain evolved in a time when the ministry itself had little influence on the everyday life of wizards and it was preferred that the heads of families resolved most issues within the privacy of the family. The same was done with most institutions. We actually still see those dynamics in today's society," Mrs Palmer said before elaborating that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry itself has been completely self-governed until Fudge's last year as a minister. "Even crimes happening there were handled by the school itself as long as they seemed competent enough to do so. Vykélari enjoy the same autonomy when dealing with matters of courtship, family law, marriage law and inheritance law as well as deliberate interferences of wizards therein. It is inherently nothing unusual."
"But understand, Harry: your mate or mates will share in that power and that is why many Vykélari outside of the wards of this manor will try everything to force you to mate with them."
"Amalyne is right, you know, Lucius," she breathed against his ear softly. "Blaise and Draco are Slytherins: too ambitious to ignore the power right in front of them. It will seduce them and make them want to possess and control it. And they will take it in due time. But your son is
So when Blaise's mother visited them later that night, mentioning how impressive she found what Draco and his Kith had done, the pale haired Malfoy heir shook his head, his eyes burning intensely. "No, these are not my Kith, there are stronger bonds than oaths between us. I want us to become Kin, related by blood."
And so, when her two stubborn friends had gotten back together, colliding like two magnets that pulled each other close and continued just where they had left off without a thought to Pansy, only her pride had been hurt. But only momentarily (she had not held any delusions about Draco's or Blaise's love for each other), so really, that wasn't her problem right now.
That was true; Draco actually had to think some moments before he could remember the name: Rhisiart Malfoy. He had died early, if his memory served right, leaving his only child and heir to become head of the family at the tender age of 17. Adler had not even been guided through his transformation by his father, as was tradition for dominant Vykélari.
"Weasley was merely making sure we'd keep the promise we gave him earlier." Blaise answered, before Ron could and Harry raised his eyebrows critically. "Do I want to know?"
"No," the other submissive answered, "not a submissive one at least. It was not what I had wished for my life."
Almost he managed it, his right hand closing around one of the horns, sliding over the surprisingly smooth and icy cold surface before coming to an abrupt stop pressed against the next forking. But with a quick jerk of its head the animal evaded his other hand, driving the sharp tips of its antlers into Draco’s side. Sharp pain exploded around each of the wounds, a firework of agony culminating in a furious crescendo as it hurled him around with brutal force, driving all air from Draco’s lungs and ripping him off the ground.
It was already past midnight and the circle of friends and family members had long since withdrawn to one of the manor’s larger and more festive parlours, a large, brightly illuminated room that reached out into the gardens behind the manor, visible through the impressive window front.
"Think, Pansy," Blaise interrupted her thoughts with his low, silky murmur. "That he is the Boy Who Lived indeed changes everything. He cannot be kept away from the public's eye and in his case, no one would ignore a forced bonding. If he told his friends later that he was so much as unduly pressured into a mating with us and they went to the press or the ministry, the wizarding public would rip us and our families to pieces."
Severus swallowed drily, his eyes swerving to the empty bottles of Hesperide's Nectar. He needed more of that stuff. And then he needed to find out what the hell had happened.
Draco had to shake his head dazedly. The raven-black, silky texture of his tousled hair was further upset by deep green feathers that stuck out almost in random directions but generally backwards. Even in this form, the prat managed to have an untameable head of hair. It was unbelievable. But oddly enough it looked quite … just somehow in that very … not really weird but still incomprehensible … way … well, cute.
A lazy grin broke out on Draco's face and he licked his lips, his eyes burning as he stared at his fiancé, his lover. "Do you want to know why?" he murmured huskily as he leaned forward.
It was too deliberate, too unemotional. The touches were firm, not at all teasing or exploring… and the realization washed over him with the stunning shock of a bucket of ice-cold water. Harry froze, not quite sure what to think, what to believe, only knowing that the man he hated so much, who wanted to force him to mate him, was trying to secretly pass him a message…
Harry blinked at the little creature in front of him that was wrapped up in layers of a pale cloth with dark edging that had once probably been part of a discarded curtain. "Uh… do you speak English?"
"That doesn't mean anything to me…" Harry admitted absent-mindedly with a slight frown, watching as Malfoy poured him a glass of that golden liquid.
"Leave master Blaise alone!" Alfar screeched from where he stood directly next to Blaise's head, who was left without any other option but to listen while the endless, starlit sky filled almost his entire field of vision. Fervently he tried to push against the hold of the body-bind, to sense out the magical strings that bound him and break them apart, but the worded curse was too focused in its aim, too stiff for him to counter; not like Harry's own comfortably familiar magic earlier that had been driven by a vague wish for his safety.
"He is fine." Blaise answered for him, but his piercing gaze hovered over Draco, the dark eyes so void of the emotions Draco knew to be there: the concern, the unasked questions, the promise of a discussion yet to come…
In any case, after they had left the manor, the two Britishers had at one point used warming charms, and applied them to a wizard's body – often enough that it could hint to a third person having been there, though a sceptic would point out that they might just have used it multiple times to increase the effect.
Did the other not escape? Not survive? Was it Blaise (please, oh please let it be Blaise) they would find in the entrance room of Damask Tower?
Dear Merlin, they were gorgeous and the way that each feather shifted with each movement, completely in tune with their owner's body was nothing less than amazing. Harry had never even seen his own wings fully, only a part of them the one time in his room - no, the room that Zabini and Malfoy had given him - and then only while they had surrounded him like the cocoon of a silkworm…
My unofficial beta, RighteousHate, mentioned it recently, and she is totally right: I do have the most patient readership of all: no flames, no pressure, you guys just wait patiently for months, I feel so coddled… you are really great and it’s a pleasure writing for you!
Narcissa had been next to her husband, screaming, splattered with his blood and more solid, organic things. Draco still remembered the expression on her face and the shrill cries of horror exploding out of her, just like her husband's innards had more or less exploded out of him; it had haunted Draco for a long, long time each and every night, and sometimes even under the deceptively warm sun light in the manor's gardens. At least she hadn't screamed for long before a green light had hit her. The sudden silence in Draco's ears had been both horrifying and a relief at the same time, while he had still been running towards the two most important persons in his life as if there was still the chance to do something. She had fallen like a dying swan, so tragically beautiful, graceful even in death and splattered with blood.
Suddenly the fire was back in the leaf green eyes, in his posture and the way he carried himself and Harry looked up and crossed his arms, stubbornly and defiantly staring at them. "I won't witness for your father or…"
Harry kept silent and bit his lips, hoping that his cheeks weren't as red as they felt like. He would certainly not go to them and ask for help
With that Narcissa leaned forward and kissed the pale lips harshly, hungrily, her fingers moving from Lucius' jaw to cup his cheek before she forced him away again. "Power, Lucius, is what makes all Malfoys weak-kneed."
Harry flinched within his grasp, evidently not having heard him approach, and his skin was clammy as he looked up at Draco with a painfully frozen expression, a study of blank distress that reminded the pureblood somewhat of a work of that French artist, Delapensé – a photographer who mixed muggle and wizard techniques to create only partly moving pictures, often studies of feelings where everything aside from the very face of his current motif was in constant, fluid motion, brought to life by the gently blowing wind: leaves wafting across the picture, rustling branches, flying hair; everything was in stark contrast to those frozen, still faces as a homage to the expressiveness of the human face: love, hate, anger, surprise, joy… all depicted perfectly through a single moment in time.
"Take all the House Elves and see to it that Harry doesn't leave the grounds and that no one gets in!" Blaise ordered, his tone mirroring the severity of the situation.
Malfoy immediately snatched his hand away and Harry could hear him cast a healing charm, which was unfortunate as Harry had been sure he had gotten Malfoy’s wand-arm and that his captor might at least be somewhat incapacitated by that injury. Obviously not.
Not giving the two Slytherins the chance to reply, Harry continued right away, speaking fast so as if he wanted to finish before he could back down.
The confusion that was his own was soon joined by wonderment and excitement and apprehension, feelings that bubbled up inside of him and were so intense that they burst from his lips in a gasp and a choked chuckle or a sob that was more a result of Harry's and Blaise's overpowering feelings than his own.
Carefully Draco moved forward as quickly as he could, as slowly as he must. The stag could attack him at any moment,
Harry nodded again, his breathing a little bit fast but still he felt much better. He would be able to transform back. Everything was only a terminable change.
Draco was rather good in all three of those, as things turned out not even half an hour later. He strode into Blaise's conference room as if he owned it, his steps sure, measured and graceful and he even managed not to glare at his lover's smirk.
Draco could have blissfully contented himself with such a sweet surrender, but not after having seen his lover flaunt his most recent activities so brazenly. Draco didn't want to even think about what it might have cost them, what abyss Blaise's actions might have opened between them and Harry, the bridges over which Draco would have to build with much patience and care, especially after what Adler had just told him. It made him so fucking
Zabini, on the other hand, was the image of darkness, seductive taboo, with his dark tan, and the black, tight-fitting dress shirt and charcoal jeans that hugged his muscular form in such a way they just had to have been tailored. He had left the first buttons of his shirt open and, all in all, he looked striking with the simplicity and elegance of his outfit. And from the look on his face, he knew it, too.
"Come on, Harry, let's join him now, or he will swim out so far, we won't ever manage to catch up with him until he comes back." Again an almost gentle smile tugged at Malfoy's lips as he turned to walk towards the sea, his lower legs pushing waves of water. "He does that, too."
They had swam rounds in the ridiculously large pool for almost an hour, an hour during which Blaise's head only emerged from the water long enough to draw a deep breath and keep on diving. That had always been one of his habits and Draco privately thought it suited his silent character. Blaise needed to think things through and he revelled in the deep, all-encompassing silence the water provided him with. Blaise loved water, which was a little bit strange seeing as Vykélari were meant to fly and not to swim. But then, there were aquatic birds also.
"You told me nothing but that I had to stay! You have no right to keep me here! No right to lord it over me!"
In hindsight it was so obvious! They should have known something weird was going on, should have protested more fiercely when they were sent home, threatened with the hospital's security shouldn't they comply.
Of course Blaise assured Harry that their own defeat had nothing to do with Blaise's skill as a charioteer, it was just that the other two teams were at an advantage since their Pihassan horses were actually bonded to their charioteers and therefore more inclined to give their best (which somehow morphed into the allegation that their horse had been influenced by its bonded rider, Velia). And Draco proclaimed with a haughtily raised chin that the winning team must have cheated. He had smirked widely though, while he spoke those mock accusations, his eyes sparkling as the younger generation of Battellis laughed and teased them, blaring their victory into the blue sky.
"You have to imagine how it will feel like: your magic will join, the barriers of your awareness and perception will blur." They advised when Harry simply didn't know what to do.
"My husband did suppress his inheritance, quite successfully." He pointed out, still not even a hint of annoyance in his quiet voice.
Seemingly relieved, Adler relaxed back against the backrest of his chair - as much as that was possible. "Well, at least you haven't bonded, then."
All these little snippings of information culminated in one baffling conclusion: The three young Vykélari had been on a date. It was grotesque and unbelievable and so very unorthodox. They had taken an unmated submissive out into the public for a date. But that wasn't the most surprising thing: aside from being dangerous in case someone spotted them and recognized what Potter was, the submissive himself would have had enough chances to contact someone, at the restaurant if nowhere else. So why hadn't he? Why – if a few days earlier he had secretly asked his most trusted friends to come and free him – why had he not tried to escape when the chance presented itself? Why that change of heart?
that any wand could curse, not only a leader's. He couldn't afford to let this man draw all of his attention, couldn't allow himself to concentrate only on him. And that was as deeply ingrained into his unconsciousness as the movements of flying were into his muscle memory.
"And Harry does, too. Now come, Dragon, we lingered long enough. I'll have breakfast sent up to you, Harry."
If only he had some possibility of verifying his sincerity… but with his magic caged within his own body, Harry could not even initiate a temporal connection, even if his magic hadn't hissed and boiled in his veins, guarding his body and his magical core with vicious determination, fuelled by the disgust and anger of its owner.
"Harry, how are you, really?" The bushy haired brunette asked, the tightness in her voice betraying her anxiousness.
"Feel free to elaborate whenever you are ready." Adler said with an elegant hand-wave and the hint of a smile when Draco had fallen silent for some moments, pondering over how to address the morning's happenings.
Blaise merely grinned, completely unabashed "Your fault for not remembering it before asking me to do you harder."
"Yeah," Harry started somewhat gruffly, harrumphing slightly, obviously uncomfortable again, "just don't screw it up."
Back in England, Severus looked at his friend of old as if he saw him for the first time. Had he ever witnessed Lucius lose himself in rage and fear like this? The Slytherin prefect and king cobra of their illustrious house in Hogwarts who had introduced him to the finer circles in society, the aristocrat, heir of Abraxas Malfoy, the Death Eater, the Father and Husband who had made him godfather to his only son.
. Warm and secure and safe he had felt with the emotions of his companions openly visible in front of him. There had been no secrets, no withholding, only the honesty that had been so often denied to him in his life even by the people closest to him. Even after Blaise and Draco had hidden their feelings away behind the thickest Occlumency shields they could muster, he had still been able to read from their body language the thoughts that usually were indecipherable to him. The ease in their posture, a small twitch of the corner of a mouth, a fluttering in the stomach; it had told him all he needed to know – as well as telling him what to focus on in the future.
Meanwhile Eleuterio was cajoled into the waiting, thorny arms of a now naked rose bush, his wand falling from his bleeding fingers as he was punched and pushed and forcefully entangled within the spikey boughs.
The hand caressing his cheek wandered down over Harry's shoulder, along his side so softly it made Harry shiver from the contrast to the insistent lips moving so passionately against his own, and then they sneaked around his hip to grab his … wait a minute!
He had always thought that flying on a broom was the closest there was to freedom and it was exhilarating to sense the magic-imbued polished wood beneath his body and feeling so close to it that it was as if he were a part of that magical flying tool for the duration of some precious seconds. But seeing Zabini now, completely in harmony with his wings, he knew that this would never even compare to flying on a broom and he might be damned, but he yearned to be able to fly like that even while he yearned to be just a human once more and the battle between those desires tore at him mercilessly.
There, leaning against a splinted tree stump, lay the unconscious form of Blaises’s cousin Taide, a small gash on his head bleeding profusely and his dark, torn shirt glistening wetly from hidden wounds. But – as incredible as that was – the man was still breathing; Draco’s sharp eyes clearly detected the shallow raising and lowering of his chest. It was inconceivable: everywhere birds were tearing already dead and mutilated bodies apart and here lay Taide, hurt but alive and ignored by the Gryffindor’s magic.
Irritation dripped from the Slytherin Ice Prince's being at that like poison from the fang of a king cobra, less from the aggravation of the unpleasant matter with their parents than from having the muggleborn guess the truth so quickly, so unerringly and not even with a hint of accusation.
Moments passed with neither of them moving, just basking in the afterglow and breathing, or panting rather. Then, equally as gently as he had been forceful and violent earlier, Blaise pulled out, grimacing sympathetically at the small wince that got him.
"And this is my wife, Ricarda," with an elegant but curt wave he indicated the woman in the arm chair who didn't give as much as a nod to greet Harry with, only regarding him coolly and Harry found himself despising her almost as much as her husband.
A pain-filled moan answered him, followed by a tense “fuck!”, and Blaise felt something in his chest unclench marginally. Cursing was good. Really good. If his lover had the strength to curse, then he couldn’t be hurt too badly. And indeed a few moments later he could make out a distinctly human shadow amongst several small figures, arduously regaining their footing.
Though he had refrained from punishing her (more because of Harry's wishes than anything else) or maybe because of his leniency, the little Elf had thrown herself into the task of watching over Harry with an almost obsessive fervour, and had planned to continue even after Blaise had officially told his servants that there was no need for any more observations and that, for as long as Harry wasn't in danger, he wasn't to be denied anything. Only if his safety was at risk, his staff had the permission to force Harry away from the threat.
Now he swiftly dressed into the light brown pants and the black, short-sleeved shirt waiting for him on the foot bench, wondering not for the first time how the hell the two Slytherins had managed to get all those clothes that fast. They fit him perfectly; maybe he would have to ask them.
Still, there could be more damage hidden beneath the scraped and bruised skin, damage that might even be fatal if not healed in time… therefore, without waiting for the potions to take effect, Severus let his wand fly over the boy's body, intricate gestures weaving a net of light that hovered for a moment above Potter, adapting to his outstretched form. Upon touching skin, the diagnostic spell would reflect the hurts and injuries the boy had suffered.
"Signori," Blaise nodded towards the armed guardia with a carefully measured, polite smile, once he came to stand before them.
"Lie still!" Harry hissed half ordering, half begging, hoping for the older man to somehow forgive him his roughness and play along. He knew that it was all too likely that his one and only ally thought he would kill them all, what with the shattered remains of the garden surrounding them, Taide's family injured and scattered, especially his grandfather who might very well be dead; and if the older Vykélari decided to resist him…
They were both elegantly dressed and Harry would have thought that they had been out or were about to depart to some fancy restaurant or something, but the two snobbish Slytherins probably thought their attire to be 'casual'.
“When the full moon rose this evening, your magic drew back from your control, so you wouldn’t exhaust it, and shattered all those senses that would need to be rebuilt. Now it is basically learning how your new sensory organs should look like, it feels them out so you will be able to transform subconsciously without even thinking about what exactly your magic should do. It has already started to do that, didn’t it? You probably can taste and smell again, though not really much better than before and you should have a very good sense of balance right now and your tactile sense should be rather sensitive.”
Blaise heard his lover sigh at the obvious mistrust that they still encountered and he could only agree: he had hoped for more after their last conversation.
you are insane! He is a reckless, stubborn, utterly dim-witted rule breaker whose fame got to his head! Damn it, Lucius, all of his achievements originated in sheer luck and the willingness of others to sacrifice themselves for him! I don't want that sacrifice to be Draco one day!"
A short, quiet laugh fell from Adler's lips, as polite and insignificant as all his comments so far seemed to be. "Not at all, Mr Potter. I am not so naive as to expect to find a truly heroic being with otherworldly powers and inhuman beauty anywhere in this world. But many here in Britain seem to think that you came close and I found myself rather anticipating our meeting, though of course it will be sadly shortened now since my descendant and his fiancé are intent on showing you the beauty of Italy."
Lowering Potter’s body temperature so drastically and quickly had been necessary to protect his  brain and give Severus the time he had needed to come up with a solution, but it had ultimately given the boy hypothermia – how bad of a case Severus didn’t know yet, and neither if it had been successful at all in preventing brain damage. Only time would tell.
Something shifted just below his shoulder blade, his magic maybe, coiling and moving endlessly like a nest of serpents, drawing together to get to work and he could feel Draco retracting his fingers, so that Harry's growing wings would not face any pressure at all, not encounter any resistance. He wondered if Draco had felt the jolt of magic just waiting under his tan skin.
It was all very well for them, Harry thought, after all they were not the ones being kidnapped and expected to obey and… he should really ask what it entailed to be a submissive Vykélari.
"Really. Spell damage? Who in the hell put a fledgeling on the Spell Damage floor? This is so degrading."
"Yes." Draco nodded, once again falling into his teacher-role, eager to give his charge more of an understanding of what it entailed to be a Vykélari. "You opted now for wings that are well suited for a high speed flight. But flying with these will cost you much energy, either magical or physical. Different shapes are suitable for different aspects of flight, you know. Long, narrow wings are well-suited for a slow, gliding flight and soaring. Short, curved wings that are broad and have a roughly elliptical shape make for an agile flight. And now, if you'd lengthen the outer feathers and spread them to get slots in between them, you'd be able to glide for hours – if the wind is favourable and your magic strong enough, which of course won't be a problem for you. Well, and they will support an easier take-off, so I'd advise you to lengthen the primary feathers… that are the ones on the outer side, at the wing tip." he added when Harry blinked at him uncomprehendingly.
There was the rustling of leaves to his left as the small servant tried to disentangle himself from the gnarled remains of the aged vine grape that he had crashed into. Almost immediately, the area around them was flooded with light and the Elf starting to count the other servants off.
Once he had finished the letter and rolled up the papers, closing them with red sealing wax he had found in one of the drawers, he stood and clapped his hands.
But why then – if it felt so good, if it was what the two dominants wanted from him – why then had Draco broken away? Why was he so disconcerted now? And he was, the Gryffindor knew him well enough to know when something unsettled him. Their long history as bitter enemies had taught Harry much about the blond and even though he had changed somewhat, had undeniably grown and matured since those days, he was still Draco Malfoy and his eyes still narrowed and flashed when he was confronted with something that displeased him greatly.
Huffing out a sigh, Draco leaned closer to the surface of the swirling liquid, careful to stay far enough away to not be sucked right into the memories. It was so much darker than a regular Pensieve, Draco thought, frowning in deep concentration as he brought his fingertips to meet the silver: his thumb for will and logic, his index finger for ambition and his ring finger for his subconscious that might guide his magic if only he let it.
Like the last time they had been in this long stretched galleria, the morning sun falling through the line of tall, wide windows swathed the room in a faintly white-golden, almost surreal glow and threw long shadows onto the pale walls, marbleized with tones of beige and sandstone. And over it all was, resplendent, the assembly of Roman gods, gazing down at them from their aloft position in the breathtaking fresco adorning the arched ceiling.
The unease he felt at those words must have shown on his face, because Adler once more evaded a direct answer to probe deeper instead.
Whether Draco shared his thoughts or read the scepticism from his expression, Blaise wasn't sure, but his fiancé looked at him intently, tight lines around his pursed lips, eyes steely and flashing with the brightness of a sharp mind that never stilled.
But in contrast to Draco, Harry was sure that the bond couldn't do that, it could make them understand each other better, could bring them closer, but it would never bare everything, every human being was just too complex to be ever understood completely and become totally predictable.
What was maybe even worse was that Harry was taking notice of the fallen Slytherin prince's frosty mood and started to become fidgety next to them while they led him towards the roof garden. He kept biting his lips to a swollen cherry red and massaged the knuckles of his right hand, rubbing over them firmly, absentmindedly. Blaise would have found it adorable, had it not been the proof of the Gryffindor's unrest. Another thing he had no idea how to alleviate.
Whatever the reason, the connection had been too intense for comfort even though the Occlumency shield had helped some; and now they had to deal with the implications. Whatever they were.
He could only watch the rough gravel rush towards him, unable to even close his eyes and he expected his nose to crush on the stones painfully when he was magically flipped at the last moment and sank into the cottony softness of a cushioning charm.
"I want Hermione or Ron to tell me that." He said with a coldly calculative expression on his delicate face. "I will believe them."
If he was wrong, if they’d attack him, then the only way of getting past these beasts alive was going to be the fast one.
And once he was at the top, he wanted Harry Potter to be there with him. He was Draco's, even if the boy didn't know it yet.
to another; like an epidemic. The list of their allies was short enough as it was, they couldn't afford gaining more powerful enemies, especially not the local executive authority.
Harry frowned and nodded like someone who was in the process of accepting facts while discovering inconsistencies in every nook and corner.  Had he always been like that, Blaise wondered, stumbling over concealed truths and lies quite accidentally while others like Draco kept over-analyzing and scrutinising some matters and accept others if only they came from the right lips. Like following a sadistic, bloodthirsty and power-hungry madman would be a good idea.
With that he closed his eyes, feeling out the currents of Potter's magic, pulling them closer to gather right beneath his hands. It was a heady feeling, downright addictive, all that power pulsing beneath his fingertips, waiting to be controlled.
In the silence and tranquillity of the scenery it had been easy for Harry to momentarily forget about his dispute with the two Slytherins, especially when he saw how happy and serene and comfortable Blaise looked while he waved for Harry or Draco to look at something he found particularly beautiful or interesting. Draco would then always smile so affectionately and indulgently before swimming over to join his fiancé that it made something in Harry's stomach contract painfully and he would probably have felt as if he was intruding on them, had they not always turned to him with an expression as if asking him why he was taking so long to join them as well.
Harry shook his head sharply. They could tell him what they wanted, he had no reason to believe anything they said! But apparently, at least their leader didn't want to give him that choice.
Besides, Blaise could admit that it had been more than just insensible to imply that his lover might readily commit a sin of this magnitude when he had never done anything of the like before. That would rouse many much more quiet tempers, especially when the accuser was throwing stones from inside the literal glass house. And Draco Malfoy, if anything, was a very prideful man. Still, Blaise had never actually apologized for his cowardice, never acknowledged it within or outside of the silence of his mind and his fiancé deserved to hear the words at least once more.
than Harry had expected, even if it was nowhere near as pompous and palatial as many of the manors in Britain, more inviting and homely. Warm.
"It will stay invisible for as long as you wear it. I don't want you to ever take it off until this whole matter is resolved and you may keep it afterwards if you wish to. If anything happens, it will take you to a secret safe house in England. As soon as you get there, my mother, I and Draco will know and one of us will come. Promise me, you'll use it if something happens!"
That didn't stop him from reaching out, though, his pale fingers hovering over the golden skin of Harry's cheek that he couldn't touch, reddened now from his shouting, from the strain and agitation. And, even as silence once more settled around him after the cruciatus curse was broken and Granger's and Weasley's terrified whimpers were once more hidden behind a privacy spell, he knew that Harry was thinking about killing this man, not with the delusive righteousness of an executioner, but with the despairing hopelessness of someone who didn't have a real choice. Someone forced to commit an unspeakable atrocity for the greater good.
Minister Nascimbeni interrupted with another quick glance at his clock. "In any case, Mancini, see to it that he is interrogated as soon as possible. Now gentlemen," he said with the voice of an actor, trained to carry, "We have seen what happens when institutions are self-governed and without any independent control. In this, we are now the most progressive country in Europe, the only one where Mr. Potter's rights are guaranteed. So let us find him and return him to that safety. And we will make sure that no institution in this country will ever be able to misuse their privileges like this!"
Without saying another word, Harry snatched the thin garment out of the wrinkled hand and slipped into it, covering his bare torso with the soft texture. It wasn't much and the caress of the silken fabric on his bare skin almost made him feel even more naked than before, but it was at least some kind of barrier, even if it was a frail one. When he finally raised his gaze again, it was to the sight of the fragile vial being held out to him.
Narcissa promises to try to send them some of the submissive's possessions along with the portraits and some of Severus' spying potion to be used on Harry.
"No." She hadn't checked who they would find, even though she had desperately wanted to, just so that no one would be there to see her shatter in case it wasn't Blaise.
One by one he pulled the yellowed documents from their respective places in the tall, dark bookshelves and spread them out on one of the brightly illuminated tables to brood over his lecture, trying to find out as much as he could about Vykélari mating habits and submissives in general.
Seeing the genuine smiles that lit Draco's pale and Blaise's dark skinned face told him he had done the right thing and somehow that made a totally unnecessary warmth spread in his stomach and probably his cheeks as Blaise steered him towards the chariots and the six Italians – the Battelis – waiting there.
say that. You know, I never saw it like this. Still, now with Shacklebold as the minister the situation is quite different than with Fudge or Scrimgeour. He is fair and just and will undoubtedly push through many reforms during his term that will be more than beneficial for the Wizarding World. Honestly, I think we could do worse than giving him the power to really restructure the ministry..."
Maybe it was time to seize the opportunity of being alone with his ancestor and address the matter that for him was becoming a problem.
"And I don't want another to rule that power." Blaise said, watching as Draco lowered his eyes to hide the wicked elation that flared in them. It didn't work, Blaise had already seen it. So Draco wanted the younger teen also? Interesting.
And as if that dismissal was meant for him, Harry turned with a furious snarl and stormed towards the manor to flee the Slytherins' company and retreat into 'his' rooms. He would find a way to escape if it was the last thing he would do!
"My past enemies have rarely had the opportunity to torture my friends and those who did are all dead now. Don't underestimate me, Valerio!"
But the Aurors hadn't helped them either: the head of the Auror department himself, a bulky man with the name Henderson, had told them that they had already been contacted by the Hospital and by the one who was currently caring for Harry Potter. With many words he assured them that the Chosen One was well and safe but he made it clear that his location was to remain secret.
They were antlers, Taide realised, just as an enormous shadow stag reared its massive head, breaking through the darkly swirling surface. With a powerful leap it jumped onto the terrace, the tiles bursting beneath its hooves with a sound like thunder, magical discharges dancing over the muscular legs like little lightning bolts.
Draco in the meantime was oblivious to his fiancé's irritation as he sat down on his own chair with crossed legs, leaning on one arm rest only, the index finger of his propped up arm idly wandering over his lower lip. Gods, he had felt so elated the moment he had seen through the wide windows how the red light filled the study, hitting Potter and knocking him out. No, not elated …
Harry thought, really not wanting to extract them ever again; it was a choice he could have been content with, if there hadn't been the promise to Ives to accept his being a Vykélari to gain his freedom.
The sound drew Eleuterio's attention and with narrowed eyes the man regarded him closely, subjecting him to a precise and intense scrutiny that Harry just had no patience for at the moment. He just wanted… just wanted this night to end without any corpses.
Well, maybe that wasn't exactly true: he couldn't rid himself of the image of Blaise that had burned itself into his mid. Blaise with his copper and bronze wings, looking so … indescribably in tune with every slight movement of the wind, so free, so agile, so beautiful in those few seconds that Harry had seen him fly… it had been more natural than flying on a broom could ever be.
"No, Harry, every dominant Vykélari between 17 and 50 will not allow you to. And while most maybe wouldn't try to force your hand, there are enough who would. If you married a woman, be assured she wouldn't survive the first week of your marriage."
Neatly severed limbs, decapitated or gutted bodies… wherever Draco looked there were more corpses, more body parts, more carnage. Most of the dead were not even recognizable any more. Draco felt his heart beat ever faster, the breath refusing to leave his lungs again, making each new intake a struggle as he realised the new and unexpected severity of the situation:
Gradually his lung started to burn from the lack of air, a sign that his little retreat into the silence of the water was about to end. A pity that, he could have used some more time alone with his thoughts.
Thank you, drkbella, GrimalkinInTheSewers and Faery66, for te nice comments and the support, it was greatly appreciated.
The spacious courtyard that once had been the heart of the palace and a place of assembly where speeches were held and justice dispensed, had now additionally become its gateway. All entries had been relocated to the colonnades framing it, blending cleverly into the arched decor of the inner walls: apparition points, portkey halls and three separate elevators leading to the surface far above.
But he had not hesitated to fight for his own life, and for his parents'. He'd fight for Harry and Blaise at a moment's notice.
Now, the young Vykélari was using his inheritance to his advantage once again and Draco couldn't keep pace. He
"I won't let myself be subjected to your fanatic redecoration!" A man hissed, lowly but clearly audible. Harry frowned in confusion: it was obvious that this was not Blaise talking: the voice was not as deep and silky as the Italian's baritone. And what was that about a redecoration?
Determined, Draco closed his eyes and brought his fingers up, pulling with him a wisp of dark, shadowed silver and pressing it against his forehead, to absorb the essence of a thought, of a memory not his own.
Blaise chuckled lowly against his flesh and started to pinch Draco's other nipple, toying with it while still sucking, licking and kissing the one beneath his lips. Jolts of searing pleasure burned their way down through Draco's body directly to his groin, which was quickly becoming the centre of his circulation and gods, the feeling was wonderful and maddening and oh, so not enough!
Harry raised his chin defiantly but did not lower his guard any; in his humble opinion, he had every right to any bout of undue paranoia he felt like having, especially after their shared enmity during their schooldays and the war combined with their molestation of his person during the past night.
"So I was powerful enough to transform and therefore I did? Brilliant. Where does the gene come from in my family, do you know that?"
"Harry," Hermione began in a tone of voice that clearly said she meant business, "do you know how that sounds? It sounds like a case of Stockholm Syndrome – that's a muggle term." She added when Ron looked at her questioningly.
In any case the fact remained that if they didn't find a way for such a conversation to occur, the submissive would turn away from them for sure. Because this was also a test for Draco and Blaise and if they didn't pass it, their chances with the young Vykélari were forfeited.
What if they were too late? What if these birds were nothing more than the requiem for a broken existence, ghosts of a nightmare holding silent vigil at Harry’s tomb?
Harry, thinking the Slytherins' unease over the connection is a sign that they changed their minds and don't want to mate him anymore, hints that he'd be fine with returning to England. Blaise loses control over his instincts and cages Harry within his wings, displaying his magic which puts Harry into some kind of trance. Noticing what he is doing Blaise retracts his magic and convinces Harry with some difficulty that he didn't do it deliberately. Still under some magical influence, Harry admits to having sent a letter to his friends. To protect him in case someone learns of Harry's whereabouts from the letter, Blaise gives him one of a pair of emergency portkeys he had made for himself and Draco during the war and then proceeds to kiss him. Harry, upset because both of them are still somewhat influenced by their magic, retreats to his rooms. Later Draco and Blaise come by to apologize and ask him on an official date.
Harry couldn't finish the thought, and that made him pause in his steps and frown for a moment. He really didn't know their intentions. He hadn't even stayed long enough to listen to what they wanted from him, what they wanted to do with him, the only thing Harry remembered was that Zabini had said something about not forcing him… more along the lines of teaching and protecting him.
and he took his time to worship and seek out every sensitive point he knew of, licking, nibbling and kissing along his lover's neck until it wasn't enough anymore, neither for him nor for Blaise.
Decidedly, Harry shook his head, venturing to take another glance at his fellow Gryffindors' still cringing forms but they didn't react to his or the man's words and Harry wondered if they had been deafened. A new wave of righteous anger flooded him as he gazed back at that much too neutral face.
"Yes," Draco said from where he stood close to Blaise's left shoulder, his voice deceptively soft and gentle, the weight of his hand coming to rest heavily on the Italian's forearm, in a subtle restrictive gesture. "And maybe, when this all is over, they will see that they were wrong."
“Even in the case that, after getting to know Draco and Blaise a bit during these last few days, he would prefer a life with them to a death by his own magic from an unfulfilled life debt, your son and his fiancé would hate you for it and they would refuse to use him for your or Lucius’ sake.”
How he wanted to let their eye balls dry up and wither away like snails on hot stones in the summer sun… but revenge would come later, once Harry was safe.
It was disconcerting, not being able to predict her at all, knowing that any spell making it past him might hit his vulnerable charge. It was a good thing that the table stood straight behind him, the still form on it almost entirely hidden from the witch's view.
Of course Blaise had openly admitted how much he wanted to repeat the experience, even though he knew that Draco had found it more than a little bit disconcerting; which was understandable, too, since Harry and he had been enemies for far longer than the duration of their relational limbo after the war; or the few days as kidnapper/host/courter and victim/guest/courted. Unsurprisingly, Draco had refused, saying also that Harry would never want to do it at this time.
"Don't, Zabini!" Daphne snapped, her hands clawing into the wood like the talons of an eagle about to leap off a ledge towards its prey or an enemy, grim and outraged as if his words were a personal affront against her intelligence. "Save your charm and lies for someone more gullible!"
Slowly, Blaise wound his hand out of Draco's tight grasp and laid it around his shoulders instead, pulling him close. How he wished he had known earlier of Harry's history. It was not that he regretted his actions per se, but he would have been more understanding, would have been gentler when placing those restrictions upon the young submissive.
“Lucius will go to prison,” Severus continued more gently, pity rising in his chest, ”whether Potter will mate with your boy or not. I could have spared him that. If only after finding out what Potter was you would have made it public, left him at the hospital with Blaise and Draco to care for him under the supervision of the healers… everyone would have believed you to be the epitome of reformed Death Eaters, grateful for Potter’s support during the trials and for his killing of the Dark Lord who, may I remind you, supposedly blackmailed you into following him.”
That was enough. Harry might have the right to be angry with them, but he had no right to insult him like that. "I am not lying! Do you want me to take veritaserum?" He asked challengingly. "I would if that was what it took for you to believe us."
It was true that Blaise felt no desire to share his lover in such a way and have other's look at that delectable body with the same desire he felt for him or pure lust... and he had never had the urge to prove to others that Draco was undeniably his, it was enough that they themselves knew it.
His hands twitched into fists for a second, the ghost of a complicated, pinched expression flashing over his face, gone before it could ripen into something more defined.
It wasn't shock, though, nor fright. No, it was simple shameful guilt in its purest form; because they had lost him, had allowed Harry to gull them and give himself over without so much as one measly spell to try and keep him safe as they had promised.
They all nodded, only nodded. Hermione didn't think the others really felt like talking, God knew, she didn't.
Nothing they did or threatened him with had changed his mind on that decision and in the end they had had no choice but to leave and apparate to Malfoy Manor in the vague hope of finding Harry there.
And when Draco panted out Harry's name, Blaise almost felt sick to that level as well. Something horrible had happened, and a sudden fear gripped him. This was a reaction far more severe than Harry being forcefully mated would warrant… Was he dead? By Merlin, had he refused and been deemed a liability? A witness and enemy who couldn't be swayed and couldn't be turned loose, what with the danger of him mating someone else and coming back for revenge?
It was too close for his comfort and yet not close enough for his liking, making his heart beat fast and his skin tingle in anticipation but no matter what, they neither moved away nor allowed him to be closer than he already was. He couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t look into Draco’s eyes that he knew would devour him, couldn’t look down at his feet like he so desperately wished to, because not looking into Draco’s eyes wasn’t an option either.
"By voice. It's 3-0-5, my birthday: the 30th of May. It will only work if the bearer says the numbers separately and without any word in between. But if you are ever attacked, it will activate automatically the moment you are in a live-threatening condition and then put you under a stasis spell until help arrives."
"We are Harry's family!" One of the twins seethed "We would never do anything to endanger him! Stop playing around and tell us where he is!"
Immediately he wished he hadn't when he got face to wrist with a young brunette, a beringed wrist she had obviously raised just then to knock again and that he only barely evaded.
Harry shrugged. "I think someone cut the fabrics." He couldn't be sure though, at that point he had not been able to see or hear anymore.
Harry’s magic whipped forth with sharp anger, just a tiny, invisible tendril of pure power extending from all that flowing blackness, but Taide could feel it nonetheless as its force rippled the very air and natural magical currents around it, and it made his skin crawl. With precision and furious determination it attacked, flashing brightly for a short moment right above Valerio’s far too slowly moving form, a thin curve of light like the gleaming of a knife, like lightning in the nocturnal air. Then it vanished from sight again and Taide felt as if the short moment of sudden silence and the absence of any clue to its whereabouts or doings was more frightful than anything it could have done.
"Hesperides' Nectar. It is made of a variety of apples that my father's family cultivates. A rather expensive treat since the trees themselves need magic to grow, which the farmers have to infuse them with - there are just so few places nowadays with natural magic and the ones that exist are protected and can't be used for farming." Zabini explained, watching Harry intently.
As for Lucius, predictably his pride hadn't let him react kindly to his friend's reproach, especially since Severus was the younger of the two of them, had always been the one to follow quietly instead of lead.
One after the other, Taide wrote the letters on his thigh and even through his wariness and suspicion Harry couldn't entirely smother the sparkle of hope that kindled in his chest at the words he read.
And Amalyne knew for sure that its wards and protection spells were still unbroken. As Damask Tower's lady and secret keeper of the Fidelius Charm keeping it hidden, she was able to feel the powerful magic still pulsing through the earth and air, humming through her veins invigoratingly, and she knew that there had not been a forced entry, the wards were still fully intact.
Additionally, on Adler's wish, Blaise granted both Vykélari portraits a House Elf as a servant to do their bidding so that in an emergency their long deceased advisors could take action on their own.
But he wanted to. It was evident in the way the muscles in his jaw tightened, while those expressive iridescent eyes of his flickered away in annoyance at being brushed off. And Blaise couldn't stand it. Not when his own mother desired him to be nothing more than a lovesick, whipped, hand tame gosling blinking adoringly up at them from the ground at Blaise's and Draco's feet, not when she, Narcissa and Lucius wanted him mindlessly and helplessly bound to their families, a vessel of light and power blinding everyone else to conceal their deficiencies and allow them to strive for even more power unnoticed. And Blaise and Draco would be nothing more than the leashes to bind the submissive with, their parents' tools.
That would not have bothered him as such, what concern was it of his if Potter hated them? - even though something in his throat constricted painfully at that thought - but it would be easier for all of them if Potter would stay willingly.
Of course, the clues he had weren't much to go by, but if he used the apparitions to synchronize the spell progress of Malfoy's and Zabini's wands, and considered the exact shapes of the magical phantoms produced by the Prior Incantato, Ettore could roughly reconstruct the main cornerstones of the past day with relative certainty.
Though it seemed that it had affected him and Draco more than Harry, probably because the submissive had been the aggressor during this connection. Or the Gryffindor was simply better equipped to deal with a situation like this.
Severus shook his head. "And this is where you underestimate Potter. He won't allow himself to be used thusly. Damn Gryffindor attitude."
Valerio raised a critical eyebrow but Harry didn't care whether his captors thought it improper, it was a threat and it made him feel taller, bolder, more powerful. And using his magic so visibly as a form of intimidation helped to settle its raging fury at least somewhat, enough to focus.
But what should keep him from doing just that, he wondered in a moment of sober clarity – or insanity, the daring idea entering his mind so suddenly that he almost faltered in his steps.
That in itself might not be as bad, though he was starting to get along with them just fine right now, but if they had no real esteem for him as a person, if they just saw him as a submissive to be played with and exploited, they might retract their protection, send him away to his friends, whom Harry would endanger with his presence. Or was that a lie? God, he didn't know, he just didn't know and he didn't want to even chance to endanger them again after all they had been through in the past. If anyone deserved safety and peace right now, surely it was them…
Quickly, Draco left the rooftop garden, one hand clenched at his side so hard that his knuckles were white and almost hurting from the strain.
Narcissa blinked rapidly, still trying to bring what she had just heard into some context that made sense. Of course she had expected another dark family to learn of their secret and try and take Potter from them, that was why they hadn't told anyone about where to find the boy after all.
"Hush, Potter." He murmured, not caring that Potter would never know. "You want to hear again, don't you?"
Which was alright. The deal with Ives' only stated that Harry needed to give them an honest chance, and that was exactly what he was doing. He was not being hostile anymore or tried to flee, he went along with their plans even if they made him uncomfortable. They could not expect more of him when he was still trying to get used to the idea of being the object of someone else's desire, let alone of a boy, much less two boys. Two boys, who had additionally graced him only with sneers and insults in the past, had slandered his best friends in the worst ways possible, tried to get them all expelled and generally spared no effort to make him miserable. And now those same teenagers regarded him with glances and gazes he didn't even want to contemplate and kept bestowing fleeting touches on him, which, to crown it all, had the brass neck of actually feeling good.
In a firm, unrelenting reminder of his damnable presence, Taide's large hand pressed against his back, pushing him forward. Stumbling, Harry was made to follow the course of one of the paths that divided the grass covered ground of the courtyard into a jigsaw of symmetric flower beds and patches of grass and bushes and exotic plants. Everything soon vanished into the night, merging into a colossal body of darkness from which the centre of the cloister garden blazoned forth like a beacon, illuminated by dozens of floating candles. They hovered above a round, cobbled terrace, empty aside from an enlarged two-way-mirror that Harry guessed was the counterpart of the one he had seen in the plane next to his friends. It had to be.
It was such a profound and powerful experience that Harry didn’t even think about reaching out with his magic, of sharing this precious, immeasurable amount of time. Harry didn’t think he could stomach the additional sensations of merging into one being… he might have lost himself in it.
"Giallina is not sure, master Potter. Giallina thinks she should wait for master Blaise. She will take the letter and send it after seeing master Blaise." Hopefully the little thing looked up at him.
And therefore – just like two months ago during the Battle of Hogwarts – Draco might have to confront one Harry Potter in a magical trial of strength, a wizard much more powerful than him, subdue him and take him away. But this time the young man that had always been more powerful than him, was a fully-fledged submissive; even more than that: this wasn’t the eternal do-gooder that would use ridiculous stunning and disarming spells against even the most powerful of his enemies, refusing to cause any undue harm.
But the only thing the blonde got clearly was 'no' and the only thing he realised a moment later with brutally shocking clarity, was that somehow the blackmailers must be listening in on them at this very moment, probably had the whole time they had been out here, following the escaping submissive.
"Fine, then. I'll ask her but maybe she won't agree, Harry. You have to understand that she obviously put herself in danger in order to get this article printed. The only thing standing between her and a charge from Malfoy is your image as the tragic hero in need of saving."
But he could feel their eyes wandering over his body appreciatively and rather self-consciously he put his arms around his naked chest. They might be handsome, very handsome even, but he was rather uncomfortable with all the attention. In the past it had always been him who had had to do the pursuing, not that he had been very good at the whole seduction thing, but still …
Blaise, Draco and Potter alone in Italy? The three young men would probably kill each other! Then he stumbled in his thoughts. Submissive?
He only forced himself to pay attention when Blaise began to speak, in an urgent, hurried manner. "This, Harry, is an emergency portkey." He said and took one of Harry's hands.
"Draco and I will distract him while you surround him and when I call your name, Alfar, you are to stun him. Only you!" He repeated emphatically. The last he wanted right now was injuring Harry with the force of too many stunners. The accumulated effect of these kinds of spells could be rather nasty, after all.
The silence that spread between them now was more sour than tense, but not less oppressive than before.
For some moments only the sound of Adler's fingertips tapping softly onto the wooden end of his armrest could be heard, and Draco looked up again, poised and with a mostly neutral expression firmly fixed on his handsome face.
Like the pale lettering on his hand, reading ‘I must not tell lies’. Or the ugly oval of darker, rougher skin over his heart where he had been burned by a Horcrux.
That was until it just wasn’t gone any longer. Until it was there at Valerio’s wrist like a sharp knife, like burning iron, cauterizing the ugly stump left behind where the wizard’s wand hand had been. With a dull thud the severed limp hit the ground, the thin wand still clutched tightly in the grasp of its dying fingers.
By Morgaine's perfidy! For a moment, Draco found himself speechless, something that he could honestly claim didn't happen very often. But he couldn't even decide whether his thoughts raced or were pushed into momentary rigidity; too busy trying to find his way through the too many too conflicting notions and thoughts fighting for dominance within the too cramped confines of his head: outrage, mortification,
Almost leisurely the enormous stag stretched its long neck forward and began to shake itself, working the graceful, lean muscles of its neck and shoulders and the long torso, slowly at first, then with ever more force until larger dollops and small drops of the black, viscous mass were flung everywhere.
"I believe you!" Harry called out and strained against Taide's hold, unable to let this go on much further. Somehow he knew this would become epically bad. "I don't need a proof!"
Valerio tilted his head, regarding Harry thoughtfully. "Don't concern yourself with trying to memorize any names for now, however. We do have a tight schedule to follow, since my ill-begotten nephew will hardly remain idle and you seem to have some very passionate, well-connected followers yourself." The odd smile froze a bit at the mentioning of such nuisances, but Valerio continued almost casually, as if not wanting Harry's attention to linger on any potential obstacles to his becoming a Lanai. It didn't work entirely, though, and Harry's rebellious streak bloomed like a twig touched by the first mild breaths of spring, even though he couldn't help the anxious, ominous feeling from settling like barbed wire around his intestines as the man spoke again.
Without any hesitation they all headed to Harry’s rooms together, Blaise and Harry in silence while Draco kept on talking like he was sometimes wont to do, or at least like he used to, Harry remembered, before everything had gone to hell in their sixth year.
"We told them that we wouldn't." Draco asserted forcefully, eyes ablaze, and the anger over the need to even voice that reassurance made his voice tight.
Once Blaise had ascertained that there was no help to be found within the boundaries of Italy, at least not from people he could contact without immediately being arrested by the guardia for breaching the terms of their house arrest, it was a depressingly easy decision who to go to for help. There were not exactly many powerful families in Britain that could be trusted to believe Draco and him over the word of the guardia or the Aurors (who might have been informed of the situation by now) and that at the same time possessed enough influence to get a hold of a portkey to Italy in the middle of the night, since most allies of the Malfoys and Zabinis had had ties to the Dark Lord and therefore had recently fallen into disgrace. Even less would willingly go against these authorities, and of those who might, only a vanishingly small fraction would not turn their back and betray them to their parents the moment Harry was safe.
Only the miniscule narrowing of the deep, blue eyes hinted at the astonishment the elder Malfoy undoubtedly felt at those news. Strangely enough, that lifted Draco's spirits somewhat again and he managed to edge the dark shadow of his father aside for now.
"But that doesn't give you the right to treat me like you have." He said finally, calmer now but irritated and insistent nonetheless. "You could have simply explained; we are no longer 15, for God's sake! And I'm not sorry for writing the letter, though I regret if it'll put you or Draco in jeopardy."
He was a Gryffindor with Slytherin tendencies, suppressed but there, and ready to apply himself like a Hufflepuff and intelligent enough to be a Ravenclaw, even though he often seemed to refuse learning when he didn't see a practical utility, which probably related to a gryffindorish/hufflepuffish Ravenclaw. He was the heir of a pureblood family who was a halfblood and a muggleborn by upbringing. He knew nothing about what it really meant to be what he was and yet, he instinctively understood certain concepts that were the foundation of old wizarding families and the world Harry would now live in, willingly or not. Even the age old principle of vengeance and family honour and loyalty. He didn't like them, but in the end he would understand and learn to accept what he couldn't change while changing whatever he could…
"Vykélari have been an integral part of the wizarding society for many centuries now, Potter. Especially here in Britain. Many purebloods once had the genes before the blood thinned or the genes were lost during one generation of only female descendants. You see, what distinguishes us from normal wizards are a set of additional genes located on the Y chromosome, that is why only males can become Vykélari.
But when the Comissario Mancini called his name once again, he followed, his dragon leather boots scrunching as he walked over the white gravel.
"Yes, of course." Blaise smiled indulgently and laid his arm around Draco's shoulder, squeezing shortly to reassure the blonde that he knew what he was doing. "I will arrange for a meeting. Let us say the day after tomorrow?"
"I don’t think I will do that quite yet." He said finally, turning to his rooms with a small smile. Not only would Draco probably hate him if he delivered his threat, but Harry had a feeling that he himself might come to really regret such an action as well.
"Are you alright?" He asked hesitantly, wondering if the blond would mind the question – sometimes Slytherins seemed awfully intent on pretending they had no feelings at all aside from pride in themselves, their families and their way of life.
Determinedly, Harry leaned forward and up, reaching out to wind his hands into the soft blond strands at that sinewy neck, and they were so smooth and silky in their texture, fine and thin, caressing the skin of his fingers like cool satin that he couldn’t help but tug softly at the white golden mass, pulling the blonde down to meet him halfway. For a moment those silver eyes widened in surprise but immediately they started to burn with bluish hot flames, cleared from some nebulous veil that usually hid everything going on in those endless depths.
"Damn it, let me go already, Blaise! Leave me the hell alone!" He growled and snarled and spat, trying to turn towards his captor, but he couldn't: the devil had wormed his arms around Harry's chest and held onto him like a screw clamp.
"We won't father." Draco didn't tell his father that he had no wish to control the Gryffindor either. He didn't think the Malfoy patriarch would condone that "But if we can't keep him in the manor without shackling him - which he would hate us for - then what do we do?"
Blaise groaned as he buried his hands in the blond silky hair, still marvelling at the sensations of pleasure mixing with magic. His eyes fluttered close. By Morgaine, he would have to buy more of that stuff…
Nonetheless establishing the connection once again would mean another mingling of magic, another close contact with those tempting streams of pure energy that had the power to control him like no wizard had managed to do before. All of Harry's usually less than reliable instincts of self-preservation were for once vetoing in determined unity. Only his thrice damned sense of justice insisted on throwing caution to the wind. Again.
With his eyes closed like this, Harry looked so much like his thrice be damned father that Severus could almost imagine it being him. Try as he might, he could not entirely suppress the sparkle of cruel anticipation, the fleeting wistful thoughts and germinating seeds of dark fantasies filled with humiliation and sometimes pain. 0
Quite a few hours later, the three of them set out for their last destination that day. In one of the compartments of the trunk that Blaise had brought – which turned out to be more of a dressing room than anything else – they had changed into their dress robes before the Slytherins proceeded to alter their appearance slightly and Harry had ended up with nut-brown hair and chocolate coloured eyes.
"Petty excuses do not suit you, Severus. I thought you wanted to try out your idea on that spying potion?"
"A-huh." Harry swallowed. He hadn't concerned himself with physics since entering the wizarding world at the age of eleven and to be honest, he had somewhat stopped following Blaise's explanations when the Italian had started to talk about different pressure levels.
Startled out of his thoughts, surprised that they had already arrived at their destination, Harry looked to the door leading to his rooms a bit accusingly as if it was the reason this day was about to end. And by Merlin, that was the truth wasn’t it? He really didn’t want this day to end, really wanted to have more, more wonderful, breath-taking experiences full of surprises and extremes, of testing their boundaries together. Blaise and Draco and he himself.
She paused for a moment, her lips curled in amusement as she remembered the one or the other incident when such a thing had happened. "Mordred, Lucius, I never understood your friendship!"
Thus resolved, Blaise clapped into his hands sharply, calling all his staff together once more. Even in the middle of the night, when most of them had to have been resting, they came immediately, popping into existence in the large bedroom, over twenty pairs of glowing, huge eyes trained on his form and waiting for instructions.
him throughout the procedure! Stroked his limbs and … had one of them really run his fingers through his hair? Malfoy? And Malfoy had tried to get into his pants!
“We will have a hell of a job trying to keep him there, you realise that?” Blaise said as he bowed down to pick up Potter’s unconscious form.
Like a rare delicacy he was that Blaise found himself indulging in and growing addicted to, a longed-for distraction from the sometimes all too stifling company of his usual peers, the usual tokens on a worn chessboard that Blaise had amused himself with on occasion and secretly grown tired of. And once the desire was awoken, it couldn't be left unsatisfied.
"They never spoke of you." Harry said, more to himself then to Ives, but the other man laughed nonetheless. "Why would they, Mr Potter? I died almost 300 years ago."
And all the while, Blaise was unaware of Harry's inner struggle. He only saw the submissive's palpably dazed and stunned amazement, an amazement that he shared, even if not as strongly.
In fact, they had never been interested in the Vykélari in the first place, focusing the brunt of their brutal attack on Alfar with single-minded determination. Driving their claws and beaks into the Elf’s flesh viciously, they had no more than scratched or superficially burned Blaise, always steering away from him as soon as they touched him. Even now they almost ignored his very existence, except for a few that fluttered around him, brushing him with their hurtful, fiery wings only to veer away immediately.
There were, of course, not many such benefactors, since those with the wealth to back them were most often either unwilling or not influential enough: unwilling, because they were most often purebloods with an attitude to match their bloodline and had no wish to step in for those of a lesser status or - heaven forbid - those of creature blood; and not influential enough because most of those that were rich and willing to bribe or even threaten or kill ministry officials had most often been involved with the 'dark side' in the wizarding war themselves and their reputation wouldn't allow them to effectively manoeuvre around the ministry, besides, most of them were busy enough keeping themselves and their families out of prison.
She didn't move, a frozen, blood-splattered statue in front of ravaged and torn bushes and so Harry strained to look over his shoulder again, letting the feathers in his hair sharpen and lengthen to form an emerald crown on top of coal black strands, his vibrant green markings bleeding out of his skin, making his eyes glow in the darkness.
Out of the corner of his eye Harry could see Draco turn his head to share a quick glance with his fiancé. "I realise you were most likely completely dressed that night but it really does not hurt in any way if done correctly."
It was very unlikely. With the wards still unbroken the only ones who could have entered were Severus and the bearers of the emergency portkeys. As the former had retreated to Spinner's End and Narcissa knew that her son and son-in-law never took off the invisible bracelets, she didn't allow herself to entertain the hope that it might all be some cosmic misunderstanding.
The possibility left him reeling, the spark of hope almost too painful to bear, a flare that consumed his breath for the endless span of a moment.
The moment they entered the conference room, Draco knew something was fundamentally, tremendously wrong.
And in Blaise's opinion, that was a fact. Seeing the newly awakened glinting in his lover's eyes, he was almost sure that Harry could make Draco happy, maybe even happier than Blaise alone could have managed. That he himself felt rather at ease with the Gryffindor even though he was normally much more reserved and generally needed far longer to warm up to someone (in the rare cases he did it at all) rather lead him to believe that he, too, could find pleasure in the company of the young submissive. He certainly was refreshing.
“He almost died, Narcissa.” He continued with a softer, more serious voice, their gazes meeting for a few moments over the still body between them. ”He must have been unconscious for a while before the portkey was put on him. Just in time, I'd say.”
He wasn't sure how much longer they would have stayed like that; it already felt like half an eternity as it was, when he heard Blaise coming up behind him, the water splashing around him as he walked towards them and already he felt more secure as he leaned towards the shoulder he knew would be there.
Intently, with a quite pleasant thrill of anticipation in his silver eyes, he scanned the room for another head of hair as pale as his own. There.
It is revealed that he has a part in keeping Lucius out of prison by using a spying potion on the Aurors responsible for the Malfoy case (basically like a Pensieve that instead of memories shows what a person is seeing. For it to work, a drop of the liquid needs to be applied to the victim's eye).
The sense of foreboding drove them onwards, faster and ever faster towards the burning ruins that illuminated the night so brightly that the outlines were seared into Draco’s and Blaise’s eyes. Now a mere two hundred metres separated them from their goal, perhaps less, and the gagging, biting stench of smoke, of fire and burned flesh and a thousand nightmares began to fill the air, even the strong crosswind unable to get rid of the poisonous fumes entirely.
If he hadn't been prepared for it to happen, Harry knew he would have cringed or frozen for a possibly fatal second when with a sudden flick of his wand, Valerio let the heavy, white curtain flutter to the ground, burying the old wizard's fallen body in a heap of cloth and folds and opening the plane's inner abdomen to the night, the place that had become his friends' torture chamber.
Still, without the use of his usual diagnostic and healing charms and his trusted potions, Severus simply had no way of assessing the boy's condition, let alone heal him further. It left him feeling uncomfortably helpless, an emotion he was not particularly accustomed to. What was more, without those tools it was absolutely impossible to find out exactly why the Vykélari’s magic was so defensive and aggressive and kept him from using them in the first place.
He himself and Blaise didn't have a mask like this one, but he found it beautiful and he instinctively knew that anyone with such bright markings would be a strong, desirable mate. Closing his eyes for a moment, Draco tried to fight down his sudden arousal, breathing deeply. God, that was so not the time for that...
"You have done enough already for people that wronged you so grievously, still want to. I don't think you quite understand just how much: Lucius wants us to subdue you and parade you around like a marionette – not even a trophy husband but a puppet without will. And Narcissa, she claims to have something to hold over your head, something that will give them absolute power over you, and she will use it without second thought… I will not even speak of what my mother would be prepared to do to entrap you hopelessly."
Not even a minute later, Draco ripped the door to his ancestor's room open, striding in with sure steps.
But neither did he want the brunet mindless, a slave to his magic, so instead he hastily pulled it back into his body with a conscious effort, letting it seep away into his wings like water into sand, but the feathery appendages he left where they were folded around Harry's body.
Maybe he should ask the other submissive in the morning what their shrewd behaviour had been about. He wasn't sure if the redhead would answer, but surely at least he wouldn't outright lie.
Severus stood entirely still, an ever so slight narrowing of his eyes and a miniscule tightening around his thin lips all that he allowed himself as he assessed the younger wizard's state from a safe distance, so as not to disturb the delicate stasis spell. Once undone, he suspected, there wouldn't be much time to act before the boy would breathe his last. The pallor of his skin, the bluish tint of his lips, and the darkly glistening patches on the back and front of the odd robe he wore, told him as much and had Severus forehandedly uncorking a healing and a blood replenishing potion. Those should stabilize him enough to allow for some deeper diagnostics.
Harry held his breath, trying not to move and after a moment that cruel sharp something was taken away, replaced with soft fingertips that rewarded his obedience with the now almost familiar magical touch that had soothed him multiple times during the last minutes. And really, Harry didn’t want to react to it, but it made the skin on his neck tingle pleasantly and something inside of him stirred and purred, welcoming that unknown power and merging with it eagerly.
“Why don’t you bring him here and I organize a portkey to our mansion in Italy?” Amalyne spoke up, her voice deep and calm and almost purring. ”You know the uncle of Blaise’s father is a healer with some experience on Vykélari.”
His very annoyed outcry was answered with a deep chuckle that seemed to reverberate through his body and gods, Blaise seemed to be in one of his cruel mindsets because he closed lithe fingers around the base of Draco's cock in an imitation of a cock ring to keep him from cumming. Then he bent down to press a light kiss on the tip of his lover's raging erection. His tongue dove out to tease over the slit, pressing in for but a moment and making Draco cry out in abandon and flex his hip in a futile attempt of getting
Grim and wary, they stood at wandpoint in a tense standoff, looks of carefully cultivated calm and fiery anger clashing between them, neither entirely willing to be the first to give in, neither trusting the other not to attack if they were to lower their weapon.
"I know." Blaise conceded. "But today made me realise that there are only three possibilities: either we mate with him, another does, or he dies. I don't want him to die, the first submissive in two centuries! If he dies without a male descendant there might never be another. I am too fascinated with magic to allow it to vanish,
"Of course." Blaise nodded and pressed on, rushing through his words now that Daphne was listening while the relief of finally telling someone who could actually actively help swallowed him whole, siphoning off the tension and adrenaline that was keeping him working even through his tiredness. "You need to send an owl to Severus and tell him to go to my safe house and wait there for Harry. He'll complain viciously, but protect him nonetheless."
The arms around him tightened, a movement curiously mirrored by the presence of Blaise in his mind and body. "I was trying to keep you from leaving, colibrí, my magic was, and your magic reacted by telling you to stay close to me as a potential mate."
But then he saw it: clouds of moisture condensing on the glass as their breath fogged up the mirror between them, mingling and meeting in the middle, just as their gazes did as they were forced to witness the fate, the struggling and torture of the other, the love of their life. And wasn't that a whole new level of sick?
"You might want to dress, but if you don't like what we laid out for you earlier," and without taking his eyes off Harry, he gestured towards the end of the large king-size bed with the now rumpled summer coat. Right at its foot stood an elegantly curved foot bench made of a dark wood, with a velvety, sand-coloured upholstering; and on it was a neat pile of black and blue clothing.
For a moment, he let his hands stroke through that silky thatch of dark emerald feathers and black hair, fascinated at how soft it was. He chuckled lowly in amusement, though, as Potter immediately tried to dislodge his hands skittishly and he cupped his ears instead to keep his head in position.
Thoughtfully, Severus leaned back, his eyes fixed on the bloody, torn robe hiding the boy's wounds from his view. If this was his only injury, and if it was as low as he suspected it to be, why then was Potter in such a dire state? The Vykélari submissive's magic alone should have been enough to heal him before he fell unconscious… hell, the accidental magic of far lesser wizards was often enough to stabilize their condition even after receiving grievous, non-magical wounds. And if his state wasn't critical, he wouldn't have been portkeyed to safety and put in a temporal stasis.
"To make it short: we assimilated both physically and mentally: heartbeat, breathing, feeling..." with an indefinite hand-wave he concluded "we shared each sensation."
"Careful, Potter!" Blaise warned, his voice dangerously low, and his dark eyes flashed as he leaned forward to hover over Potter's lying form.
Harry would never be able to describe the overwhelming sensation that swamped him as the thin barrier that had covered him like a second skin, encapsulating his body like a plastic bag under vacuum, was soaked right back into the band of metal around his throat, drawing back inch by inch. It was as if his skin was suddenly able to breathe again after being covered by sticky tar for hours, as if a terrible weight that had smothered him, pressing down on every square centimetre of his body, had been torn off of him, as if he had been drowning and had been rescued, picked out of the water to find himself surrounded by light, fresh air, soaring, floating…
"They don't know what happened?" Harry exclaimed and the thought made him shiver. Not only would his surrogate family worry endlessly over him, frantically - they were a little bit overprotective lately what with the end of the war and Voldemort's vengeful supporters still scattered over Britain and bloodthirsty reporters on his heels - but more importantly no one
All the while it was only the subtle influence of Harry's magic answering to Blaise's closeness that held the submissive still, even though some parts of Harry's consciousness started to strain against that, the instincts he had developed during the war too strong to be completely overruled by his wayward magic.
In front of him Draco sighed, a sound so tired and frustrated that it tore at Blaise like a squall and suddenly he was afraid of losing him – not to war and death this time but to a mistake that he hadn't acknowledged, hadn't rectified in time.
And that, Blaise felt, was acceptable, even desirable, because while he wished for the submissive to yield to them, he could understand that this would, right now, be the sign of a level of naivety and stupidity that no mate of his should or could possess.
"So we can change the shape of our wings." He said pointlessly, only to show he was still listening, still following.
On they went, Malfoy keeping Ettore in his sight the entire time until they vanished behind a corner, his head easily turning almost 180 degrees to follow his every movement. Or lack thereof.
But at that crucial moment something had paralyzed his vocal cords, even though Taide had known that he was the only one who could still save them.
Perhaps, Severus thought darkly as he reflected on how blissful his ignorance had truly been, Dumbledore had had a point preaching about the use of scars. Sometimes they were important mementos, and not always for the ones bearing them. Perhaps…
With an annoyed click of his tongue, the old man continued. "I know that the Lanai family is in possession of several leech daggers. I know that aside from one single exception, every case of Ceadda's darkness was the direct result of a leech dagger. Usually, such a weapon draws magic from the blood of a submissive, too quickly for them to do anything against it. It will incapacitate and ultimately kill the victim, if the dagger is not removed from their body in time. But if a submissive is desperate enough, and significantly stronger than the one who created the dagger, they sometimes manage to overcome it's pull. They do that by hurling their magic away from the dagger, and ultimately out of their body."
They reached his precious sister first and her husband, who hadn’t been able to flee with Alessa’s back a single open abrasion and Taide could no longer stay silent.
"Then by all means, send them to the manor." Blaise said a little bit impatiently. "Now Draco and I should take our leave; we don't want to keep Harry waiting after all."
At that moment, ruthlessly exploiting Harry's distraction, a beam of red light shot towards his bent back and if he hadn't partly expected such a guileful move, it might have successfully hit and incapacitated him. But Harry's antsy and restless magic felt the fast approaching spell like a shark's ampullae of Lorenzini would sense the electrical fields around a prey's body, or a bird of passage sensed magnetic currents. His skin crawled ominously and his hackles rose; without wasting a single thought, Harry whipped up a bright blue protection shield that effortlessly absorbed the stunner.
"You were not at the engagement party." He said conversationally as he sat down in one of the heavily upholstered arm chairs, intent on drawing out his fun as much as possible.
Then Malfoy shook his head slightly and continued. "Not an animal. I also dislike the term creature. We are human magical beings and therefore allowed to use wands just like wizards and have the same laws, well except those for mating, there are some additional rules and some liberties we may presume because of Vykélari mating habits. Not that they were enacted during the last 200 years…"
"Sorry." Blaise sighed and reached out for the other teen's hands, only to have his arm viciously slapped away.
Valerio turned half-way to face him, determination written into every, grim line of his expression. "I will." And a third tongue of reddish flames licked over their wrists, along their arms, the three threads entwining tightly and sinking into their skin as they both pulled back their hands.
Well, the Slytherins at least seemed to have decided on the very popular tactic of suppression, sauntering over to the three of them with a truly commendable nonchalance and confidence as if Draco hadn't spent the better part of their acquaintance hexing them on corridors or trying to get them expelled and as if Blaise hadn't advocated the superiority of purebloods just like any of their peers. Maybe not as loud as others, but not with any less conviction. Well, as long as Mione and Ron would play along and also ignore their past, the strategy might even work.
He knew what he should do, knew there was no time to lose, but the very thought was harrowing in more than one way; and the silence filled his lungs, making him feel completely isolated, alone with a distasteful task, a necessary evil.
The heavy silence was answer enough. Pansy blinked in surprise, torn between dismay at her friends' stupidity and amusement. What in Merlin's name were they thinking? "Don't tell me you let Potter of all people walk around with that much magic at his disposal after having kidnapped him?! Oh, this is rich!"
"I don't know." He said, picking at the rest of his meal: fillet of beef (since he had been declared well-rested enough from his magical exhaustion that his stomach wouldn't protest) with a nearly black coloured gravy made of boiled down and spiced balsamic vinegar and an ensemble of fried vegetables.
More than likely however she was just waiting for him to lower his own wand and give her the opening she needed to sink her deadly fangs into him.
Severus lowered it gently, care and precision in each movement, until it settled like a blanket on his charge, and then…
He knew that muggles had ways of reviving people, of keeping them alive even without magic; he knew that he had to press down on the ribcage above the heart to more or less pump it manually and then breathe for him. He knew that, having lived with and around muggles during his childhood and the holidays as a teenager, but he didn't know how it worked, didn't know how forceful he had to be to make the heart pump but keep the ribs from breaking – didn't know that it would all but require the ribs to break for it to be really effective.
Harry thought, and before he knew it, words were falling from his lips, coaxed out by the closeness and intimacy of the connection, his general exhaustion and the sluggish warmth bathing his mind and body. Here was someone who felt honest and sincere and willing to listen; Harry didn't need to go through this mess alone. And it was a strong dominant whose guidance he should accept anyway... "It's just so damn much, you know? You are legally allowed to kidnap me and force me to mate…"
seeing and that was the white, unadorned ceiling in his room at his aunt's and uncle's, or the dark dreariness at the Black Manor or even the piles of packages in Fred and George's room at the Burrow he had slept in lately…
Harry, who was now stepping past him, so close that Blaise saw his face, barely and much too blurred to make out any details, in the periphery of his field of vision, a pale oval in that see of darkness. There he paused, looking down at him but Blaise couldn't see his expression from this angle, unable to change his eyes' focus away from these damned stars consuming themselves in the endless distance.
In the next moment, pain exploded behind his eyes and his vision filled up quickly with small dots of nothingness that grew and melted together. Horrified he kept on watching as his sight fled, holding onto the last spots of colour until they, too, vanished into darkness.
"Did you know, Harry, that some birds court by dancing with their prospective partners?" He asked with such an utterly straight face that Harry wondered for a moment if he had heard correctly. Was he being asked to dance?
Open-mouthed Harry stared at the other submissive, not quite able to believe his ears. Was this offer a hoax? His eyes hushed from one point at the wall to another only to immediately abandon it again as if he was searching for something, maybe an anchor of some kind.
‘Who would have thought that the boy would win the war in the end?’ Lucius thought somewhat wistfully; had he suspected that highly unlikely possibility he might have reconsidered his allegiances.
Rolling his shoulders once to ease the tense knots another sleepless night had brought with it, Ron strode out of the room to the front door and pulled it open.
Careful to not touch the reflective surface and dirty it with his fingerprints, Blaise took the mirror and held it, shoulder-high, against the wall. As the levitation charm that covered the wall hummed against his fingertips, he let go and watched for a moment as the silver thing floated in the air, mere centimetres away from the wallpaper.
It was undeniable that Harry had been in the literal centre of most events throughout the entire time of the war and even though it had been comparably short and though he was not really traumatized it certainly hadn't left him unaffected. His battle instincts and reflexes were well-marked nowadays and almost ever present when he was in the company of someone he didn't know very well or trust completely; and his prolonged existence as a fugitive had instilled in him a deep appreciation of the simpler luxuries that a regular daily routine could offer: he consciously enjoyed being able to sleep in on a soft mattress in a solid house more than he ever had, he appreciated a good, sometimes even a fancy meal whenever he wished it and which he didn't have to gulp down quickly and he loved taking long, hot baths or a relaxing shower instead of having to resort to cleaning charms.
"Shut up!" Harry growled, feeling uncomfortably naked all of a sudden. Self-consciously he drew his arms around his chest and glared fiercely at the other two men. Trust Slytherins to find something to ridicule when there were much more pressing matters at hand. And there were so many …
From the way Harry emphasized it, Malfoy couldn't misinterpret the meaning of those words. But the blonde only tilted his head back for a moment, eyes directed into the sky. One again Harry marvelled how pale those eyes were in such an angle, seemingly completely without an iris. It was rather fitting for demon, he guessed. "And I told you time and time again that we don't expect you to. If you just can't accept it as a gift, if you really need to, you may see it as an offer of amends for your not quite voluntary stay."
Sure enough a moment later the boy started to convulse, his chest heaving with wet, violent coughing, his body shaking with tremors. Severus surged forward, cutting the bindings and grabbing Potters shoulders to turn him onto his side and not a moment too soon: he had just managed to turn the boy's head safely away when the potions Severus had fed him seconds earlier made an entirely disgusting reappearance, splattering all over the pristine bed sheets.
change your life and it will be easier for you, if you accept that. But it doesn't mean that the changes will have to be for the worse."
And if there was one thing his Slytherin hosts didn't suffer from, then it was inferiority complexes.
Blaise chuckled as he reached for his wand and flicked it at the ties to release them. "Mmm. But you were glorious." Mischievously he cocked his head and smirked. "Nonetheless we should hurry and clean up if we want to speak to your father before getting Harry for breakfast."
– were desperately trying to reach them, only Taide remained to witness Harry’s magic taking form. He and his father, who lay on the ground as if paralyzed, cradling the stump of his wand-arm, staring with wide but empty eyes at that puddle of poisoned blackness.
And damn, if that day hadn't felt as if his dates had secretly drunk some Felix Felicis... it wasn't as if Harry didn't think them capable of doing something like that, or that he would mind, honestly, the golden liquid was after all no love potion that inspired feelings that weren't there. But he knew there was no way the two Slytherins would have been able to acquire the expensive rarity on such short notice, and they probably would have won the game of aerial warfare, if the potion had played any part. Which meant... that maybe he could stop reminding himself to give the two Slytherins a chance and just do it instead.
A shame, really, that it had not happened with people he actually trusted. Oh, he hadn't lied to Draco, not in the true sense of the word, he was ready to forgive him for what he had done during their school days and in the war, but he would not forget, not that easily. He did not blame him or accuse the blond Slytherin, but their joined past had taught him to maintain a healthy wariness, more so than he would have if it had been a total stranger instead: Draco now needed to prove his trustworthiness instead of his untrustworthiness, and that was always harder to do.
Harry was silent for a moment, contemplating the blonde's words. They were sincere enough, and yet… "And if not? If I don't want to … with you, when can I go home?"
"Just trust me for a moment. Please." Blaise said, keeping his face as neutral as any Slytherin during a negotiation, though internally his stomach clenched in anticipation, waiting while Harry regarded him thoughtfully for some moments. "No spells?"
"You!" He hissed at Blaise, noticing with satisfaction that clearly discernible, firmly spoken words darted from his lips "Stop smirking. And you!" he continued, this time glaring at the pale blond. "Stop laughing, and keep your hands to yourself!"
"To begin with, Harry, it is your fault that you were not given more information. If I remember correctly, you were the one to run away before we had the chance to tell you more" Draco drawled, his voice like ice, cold and hard and relentless. "So don't you dare accuse us now!"
"How unusual." Tassi murmured. "If he was spared by Ceadda's darkness he might have been a friend or an ally of the submissive. Perhaps even the reason why he went berserk in the first place."
Straightening up, tall and proud and beautiful, with enough confidence to make her seem like a solid rock in the turbulent surf, Severus could truly believe that in another time she might have commanded the masses with ease and grace.
Severus had needed the time, Potter had needed the time and sadly enough he couldn’t trust the mother of a dominant Vykélari where a submissive was concerned; not until she had been convinced of how utterly foolish, not to mention dangerous, their plan of exploiting an everywhere popular war hero truly was.
"Besides," Blaise murmured reassuringly with a small smile, "both Draco and I will assist you in directing your magic."
His father had been hit with an expulso. Quick, probably painless and endlessly bloody. Such a mass of innards and shreds of tissue. At least Draco was sure he hadn't felt a thing but he wondered if Lucius' brain had had the chance of registering his death before he had bled out. After all, even bleeding to death from a hole in one's stomach as large as a fucking bludger took some seconds. Enough time surely for the brain to realise the futility of a fight, the hopelessness of a dire situation, the fact that a fatal wound was causing it to shut down for good. Though perhaps the shock would prevent such last thoughts, drowning them in an ocean of nothingness. In any case the question remained: what would that fatal shock feel like?
It made him want to scream and weep and rave and deny it all. His magic was seething, wriggling within his stomach like a ball of hissing, agitated snakes that wanted to strike!
"I … you know, it's alright, really …" Harry started hesitantly, if a little bit strained, "just, if maybe I could stay here until the school term starts, that'd be great…"
She couldn't help the tiny, surprised flinch as clammy fingers closed around her own, squeezing gently.
A memory of chaos that welcomed him with a cacophony of screams and howling wind and Harry's shouting as he landed on the floor of Harry's rooms, the Gryffindor himself kneeling next to him, his magic racing around him like a tornado, completely out of control and the threads of the curtains that once had been draped over the two-way mirror flew around him in a whirlwind, partly obscuring his cowering form. His face was a grotesque grimace of desperation and horror as he tried to get that madman to stop torturing Weasley.
With a long-suffering sigh, Harry did, rolling his eyes as the blonde behind him insisted on pulling out the chair for him. At least they had already seen how bad of a dancer he was back in their fourth year and Harry couldn’t imagine performing any worse than that. Every scale needed to have a lower end and that, Harry had already exhausted.
So, this most likely was about that letter... but for as long as he wasn't sure, he would be damned before he admitted to their knowledge of Harry's rash act. Maybe it was something else altogether that had his father in such a state and in that case it was better their parents were unaware of Harry contacting his friends in any way for as long as possible.
However, due to the staircase the circular room revealed itself only bit by bit to their eyes, more so as Amalyne seemed intent on being cautious, proceeding slowly with her wand at the ready.
The feeling was so much more dizzying due to the magic swirling through the Nectar, its presence not diminishing even after Blaise had swallowed. Draco's taste was there, too, somewhere, inextricably entwined with the golden juice. He moaned into the kiss and brought his own hands up to cup his lover's cheek and pull him closer as pleasure pooled in his groin and his trousers tightened.
Draco smiled as he remembered his father giving him that same lecture. Since then he had tried to do just that: he and Blaise had sent out stunner at everything around them in the two months since receiving their inheritance, mostly to take their minds off the upcoming trials, trying to change the spells into explosion charms; never with much success. Maybe now, together with Harry all three of them could explore and push those boundaries. Wasn't that worth the loss of security and privacy that the bond would cause? Wasn't this what dark - wild - magic was about? Accepting the dangers of the unknown just to reach for something greater? He was a Slytherin after all, he held the ambition and the intelligence to become an outstanding wizard. Blaise did so, too. And Harry? Harry. The Gryffindor role model…
For those he decided not to openly support he at least used his influence to somewhat mitigate the sentence and they were assured that their families would be taken care of and that, once the upheaval Britain's wizarding world found itself in after the war had settled, Draco and his Cynn would do everything in their power to achieve a mitigation of punishment. If, Draco mused, he'd find himself bankrupt until then, he'd have no power to help anyone and thus the deal would be null and void. No problem.
And with that he looked down at his husband, eyes softening like melting steel, stroking a knuckle over his cheek in a soft caress before turning to Harry again, all polite, neutral interest once more.
With those words and a quick wave of his wand, he closed the mirror connection before he could say something unfortunate towards Lucius or his mother, that might get either himself or Draco disinherited.
Thank you once again, adafrog, for the nice comment! And thanks everyone else for reading, bookmarking and for the kudos!
powerful." Draco said at last, cocking his head at his fiancé with fallacious calmness. No one could deny that; even now Potter's magic started to recover and he couldn't wait until it would dance around the oblivious Gryffindor and play tricks on a spectator's eyes.
"What are you allowed to do?" Harry whispered into the early morning air, worrying his lower lips. What had Zabini said? God, remembering the moment was more difficult than he would have thought with his memory clouded by anger. But Zabini had been infuriating when he had given all those orders…
Maybe it was better this way, though; Harry wouldn't have had an inkling as to what to say to them anyway. Any apology that might measure up to what he had done to them, to all the trouble he had caused them, would need more than a few pathetic seconds filled with stammered half-finished sentences.
Strong arms wound around his torso and Harry grasped at them tightly as he imagined that it were his forest- and spring-green wings doing that instead of Blaise’s. The longing to just spread his wings and fly himself was so tangible, so painfully real and solid in his chest, that the temptation was difficult to resist. But it might be dangerous to unbalance Blaise that way.
The rage he felt over that injustice filled his very being, ripping through his chest like a knife, squelching every voice of caution and thusly loosening his tongue until words spilled forth that never would have left his mouth if not for the combined agitation at this whole fraught situation and the Italian's harsh words.
"What? No … no, no. I'm fine!" Harry turned towards them and then he blinked in rapid succession as if he had noticed only now that they were even here.
For now, he'd be good, he'd mate that man like they wanted him to. And in the end he would kill him. Fervently Harry begged whatever deity would care to listen that their feelings and sensations wouldn't blend the moment he'd crush Taide Lanai's body, that he wouldn't have to feel his heart stop beating, his lungs take their last breath… he wasn't entirely sure whether he could stay sane through such an experience.
No, in the end he needed to be honest with himself and admit that there was no one he wanted to get involved in this mess that was his life right now. Therefore he would be alone with this problems if Draco and Blaise decided not to help him any longer and so in consequence the uncomfortable truth was that he depended on them, on his former enemy who he had made peace with only a short time ago, and a Slytherin he still didn't really know. He hadn't wanted to accept it before, but with the conversation of Ives so fresh in his memory and the fear of being turned away, he had to acknowledge it nonetheless.
His Cynn. Draco always had to smirk inwardly at that word. Like the Wizengamot, it had germanic roots, in some way it was a kind of sarcastic wink to his adversaries of the ministry he guessed. But for Draco and the few Slytherin friends that had joined him in his venture, it was more than that. It was a homage to their traditions, to the past of the magical community in Britain itself and to the age-old values and rites that the Dark Lord should have honoured but hadn't.
"But you can feel my emotions just fine, yes?" Blaise leaned forward, his eyes intense and piercing, holding Harry's own. Slowly, Harry nodded.
When they had rushed to the spell damage floor in St. Mungo's after Harry had fallen unconscious, the healers had taken Harry's still form and carried him away and they hadn't been allowed to follow.
His heart beating madly in his chest, Harry snuck towards the light, careful to not make a sound as he glimpsed into the room.
Harry had to admit that it was a breath taking view that unfurled before him: beneath the window a large, beautiful garden spread in five terraces over a shallow acclivity towards the deep blue sea, the smallest of them being a dozen meters wide at least, the largest was the nethermost one that seemed to be a park in and of itself. It vaguely reminded Harry of a castle's pleasure ground, just with more exotic plants and not as strictly geometric in the shape of the beds and greens.
Slowly Harry laid his head against the solid wood of the door and closed his eyes, thinking back to that floating restaurant, the ruins, the teatro del pensiero, the falling and before that the ride in those floating chariots... Blaise and Draco had put much more effort into planning this date than Harry ever had with Cho or Ginny both. And more money. There was no denying that.
Yet Draco was very loyal to his family still, not least because he was realistic enough to know that every stain on their reputation would mar his also. Privately, Blaise knew that his lover dreamed of following in Adler Malfoy's footsteps and recreate the meaning of
Almost, Draco cursed out loud, anger and frustration and bitter disappointment warring in him. Had it been too much to hope for? That Harry Potter might really give his nemesis of seven years another chance? That he might come to forgive him, even like him? Trust him?
"Merlin, Severus." Narcissa gasped, a delicate hand covering her lips. "How could Dumbledore leave him with such a family!"
Steeling himself, Harry willed his vision to change to that overwhelming richness of detail and colour and just like that it did. Gazing up, he watched as the blurry image of the fresco became sharper, until he could make out the outlines clearly and then he could see every unevenness of the ceiling it had been drawn upon, every line of each brushstroke. The colours themselves didn't change much; it seemed that additional colour had not been part of the paint used for this fresco, and for that, Harry was glad.
But … Hadn't Draco left him first – why hadn't he declared himself neutral when Blaise had asked him to?
Malfoy clicked his tongue once again, making Harry wonder how many times he could make the git do that during a certain time span. "It's been over 200 years since the last Potter fledged. Your ancestors were not powerful enough."
But how was he to leave the Manor without help and return to his friends? He had no wand to apparate away, and several House Elves had the order to keep him within the wards. And dammit, He knew just how powerful they could be. It hadn't been so long ago that Harry had seen them in battle after all.
Perhaps he was even more than his parents combined: forgiving, where they hadn't been, accepting and understanding of how people could be swept along by the wrong ideals and beliefs, when even his righteous mother had never quite forgiven Severus for calling her a mudblood, for befriending the conservative purebloods of Slytherin House,
"Now fuck me!" Draco whispered fiercely, even though he knew that he would feel it for many hours if the other moved now without him having a chance to adapt to the considerable size invading his body. Grey eyes flashed in a silent challenge and for a moment Blaise wondered how such a cold colour like that ice-grey could burn so hot.
"You could have been seriously hurt, Harry. And I was just so angry that you seemed so nonchalant about it, that you had done it without even thinking of the consequences … I won't allow you to endanger yourself like that!" He pressed out with all the determination of someone used to getting his will.
Soon, the valley nestled between two spurs of the Apennine Range above which their race had ended, faded into oddly wrinkly looking foothills that were gradually taking on the appearance of a model landscape: the treetops covered the ground like coloured cotton balls and the fields to the west extended to the ocean without any interruption, a patchwork quilt of yellows, browns and greens.
"He needs someone to talk to, someone he can trust to answer his questions without some egoistical motive." Ives answered defiantly, a faint trace of red staining his cheeks.
"Thank you, Pansy." Blaise said, sounding so damn sincere that Pansy had to purse her lips and try to forcibly hang on to her anger. In vain.
Only one of the guardia hesitated for a few moments, his muddy brown eyes resting thoughtfully on the two Slytherins they left behind, without a wand and without the possibility to follow Mr Potter unnoticed. He was still young, of course, still less experienced than most of his unit and he knew he shouldn't let the untenable accusations of criminals get to him, but the little spark of insecurity that these two men had planted within him threatened to catch fire in a moment's notice.
The stag leaped forward and Draco tried to roll with the movement, tried to grab the enormous antlers to keep them from stabbing him and let his own magic
And Severus gave her that tiny, insignificant courtesy and remained silent. He was still contemplating what words might calm her in any case.
Suppressing a growl, Draco waited for the right moment, when Blaise had released his collar and was sufficiently distracted, then he quickly grabbed his lover's wrist and twirled him around to press him face first against the wall, twisting his arm behind the Italian's strong back to the music of a sharp outcry of surprise and discomfort.
do it now: who knew how long Harry's cooperation would last, who knew if he would give them the chance for a taste of this bond ever again?
was in his rooms, having learnt years ago to trust his instincts, that itching feeling of being observed or overheard.
And here went Harry's conscience again, his mind clearing somewhat, throwing itself into ifs and buts with vigour. They couldn't be sure about no one knowing of him being at Zabini Manor, now could they? And all because of Harry. The owl might have been intercepted and someone besides Ron and Hermione might have learnt of his whereabouts. And the worst was: he might not only have endangered himself, but Blaise and Draco as well. Would they be able to really defend the manor when someone tried to get in by all means necessary?
"You looked good together…" He murmured absentmindedly, his head cocked to the side, dark eyes following the line of Harry's jaw and mouth unblinkingly. Blaise licked his lips.
and some part of him (the one that was not stunned into complete, heavy silence) was still searching for the catch. Was this yet another way to influence him and make him choose them as his mates? Or were they sincere?
He wanted more, more contact, more pleasure, he wanted to bury his cock in Blaise's tight heat or watch his lips wrapped around his length, deep-throating him skilfully. Or goddammit, he wanted for his lover to take him, possess him. Anything, just anything, something…
"Harry, sweet, you are so painfully ignorant of how you affect others in every regard, always have been … but don't worry, in time we'll show you. And though our time might have been more pleasant, it would also have been less interesting. And I like to think that it was my teaching that kept you alive in later years."
Hey guys, I know it’s been practically forever. But I’ve finished university now!!! My master thesis took a lot of time, so I hope you can forgive me. I hope it’s going to become better from now on but it is difficult. I’m a computer scientist and somehow my friends and family take offence if I sit in front of my Laptop during my free time.
It reflected the sunlight, throwing it back and illuminating Harry and Draco and Blaise, who stood quietly behind them; but the reflection was not blinding them, as if the brightest light was somehow filtered out. While Draco turned towards him, Harry wondered if that had been part of the complicated magic that the blond had performed; it hadn't been a normal spell for conjuring a mirror, that was all Harry could tell.
With that dismissal, Nascimbeni watched as his lawyer, Generale Carraci and Comissario Mancini hurried out to do his bidding. His secretary followed more slowly, ensuring that signore Tassi accompanied him.
Harry kept his gaze lowered, not wishing to encounter the heated glare that he would surely see on Ives' face, nor wishing to talk about the other's problems, when he had enough of his own to deal with.
Blaise shook his head, letting the way his hair moved with the water distract him for a moment. He loved that feeling. Maybe he should let his hair grow just to experience it more strongly.
'...abducted, forced into a relationship with two other men and then oppressed for the rest of his life…' and just a sentence later '…rape and deprivation of liberty…'
Or in the unlikely case that someone managed to prove the murder of one of her husbands and she had to spend some years in her safe house…
In comparison to all the other rooms, the study was rather plain: warm peach-coloured, marbled walls and a white ceiling, the exact same colour of the living area, and high but relatively narrow windows (only in comparison to the wide ones in the other rooms) that were partly veiled by pale curtains. Some kind of plant stood in front of each window, but Harry had no idea what they were. Maybe Neville would have known; no,
, Blaise and that of my family! I tried to keep us all alive and I really won't apologize for not caring how I did that or at what price or who'd fall by the wayside, but nothing I did was on the expense of my friends! I never turned on any of you. Never."
Quietly the pair stepped past the preening House Elf and came to a halt in front of the dark haired young Vykélari, gazing down at his face that looked so deceptively innocent in the relaxed state of his magic-enforced sleep. He was not; it would indeed be foolish to think him innocent after the war he had been forced to fight.
A Vykélari's magic was almost sentient in and on itself. It could act on its own to benefit its owner and it could refuse its service when it perceived a certain action as a danger. Obviously, the latter was the case now.
They were framed on Granger's side by the Weasel and on the other side by those nasty, prank-loving twins, all of which had been gazing into empty space with an expression Draco couldn't quite pinpoint but they looked up as the two newcomers entered, and that weird look faded into a mixture of disgust and hate – Draco had never been really sure which of the two emotions might outweigh the other in regards to him, but he guessed it didn't really matter anyway, even less so right now. How ironic that he and Blaise were here to safe Britain's savior, the one and only this group of emotional children were always fussing over so much and all the read-heads did was…
And really, that would have been reason enough; that no one else seemed to be willing to help them, was just another.
If not handled correctly, this situation could dwindle into a public uprising against the purebloods in their society, and that would not end well for them at all. Not after their position had already been weakened by the last Wizarding War.
He was not really sure if that realisation was his own or another’s, planted into his mind, but it didn’t seem to matter as Harry was lulled by that comforting, protective power that seemed to have thrown a veil of sorts over him, weighting down on his limbs and fogging his mind. Suddenly his body seemed aware of the long hours he had been awake now, of how exhausted he was both physically and emotionally and in need of help; and he felt tired and calm and so very sleepy and strangely enough: safe.
“That should be more comfortable. I remember that I found it difficult at the beginning to keep my balance if I kept my wings unfolded.” Oh Merlin, Harry thought, blanching, it was true: he had wings! And that third man spoke as if it was just natural and furthermore as if it was
While everyone was still staring in shocked silence the thing had gradually calmed down and then it had just
to take, if one of them would ever get close enough to the younger submissive so that Harry would consent to something as innocent as a kiss. Had he not told his Italian lover that very first afternoon here how he wanted to kiss him? Taste his magic and feel his lips, the lithe body trembling in his embrace...
Harry whipped around at hearing that lilting, teasing drawl and he snarled, knowing that whatever he said now would be unintelligible anyway. There right in front of the curtain veiled archway opposite of the king size bed stood Malfoy and Zabini, as poised and arrogant as ever but somehow stronger and more truly self-assured than ever before, too. Confident enough to answer Harry's defensive stance with barely concealed amusement as they stepped into the room.
Whatever the cost, he wouldn't let Hermione or Ron remain at the mercy of these vile bastards for a second longer than necessary. He would bring them home, see that they'd recover. He would.
No, Harry really couldn't tell and that was like the splinter of an ice crystal in his bowels. Always, always Harry had been able to trust his instincts and now they seemed to betray him, not keeping him alert when he should have been.
It reared its massive head, stretched it forward and roared at Draco in a voice so deep and all-pervasive that it vibrated through even the marrow of his bones. Draco froze, all too aware just how powerful this beast was. But he didn’t retreat, couldn’t have moved in this moment even if he wished it, and the shadow stag jumped forward in irritation, stamping its long legs threateningly. A shower of bluish sparks sprayed into the night where its hooves smashed onto the stones and magic danced around its legs like electric currents.
"No, Harry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry not only that I would have allowed her to do that to you, but that I wasn't even sorry then. I had never seen it used on a human being before, never felt it myself. I… I'm not above ruining my enemies in a purely materialistic sense, but that, things like that… I wouldn't do that. Not anymore, not since I know…"
For long moments, nothing happened. Then, the large door slid open, revealing a small House Elf with huge, glowing eyes that seemed to bulge from their sockets. She wore a white, clean pillowcase that looked to be of a much finer cloth than House Elves usually wore and a curtain cord that was bound around her waist gave the thing actually something like a decent shape.
Feeling more than a little bit flustered and queasy, Harry averted his gaze and laid down his fork ostensibly carefully. "Uhm. The inheritance. Vykeli?"
An echo of movement and a sense of nagging curiosity and then Harry touched the feathers, their softness and velvety texture tingling over sensitive fingertips of three hands, barely felt at all; a touch of nothingness. Draco smiled, felt Blaise smile with him and Harry's not really annoyed huff and at that very moment of content, delight and warmth it dawned on Draco how very comfortable he was despite or maybe because of the closeness and intimacy of the bond.
Next to him, Draco squeezed his forearm soothingly and answered a little bit guiltily for both of them. "I'm afraid, we could have handled it better."
Draco had always ever wanted recognition for being who he was and what he wanted to accomplish and not for being Lucius Malfoy's son. In Adler's and his parent's eyes, in the eyes of their circles and peers and strangely enough: in Harry's. But with his family ordering his every move, guiding his every thought, how could he have done it?
Still, the Mediwitch had been able to use magic then which didn't seem to be possible now… relentlessly Severus' eyes flitted over the room and its magical artefacts in search of something, anything that might help… stopping only when they encountered a speck of gold.
Soon Draco's legs were giving out, but before he could lower them from their place around the other man's chest, Blaise grabbed them at his ankles once more, bending them towards Draco's chest, the new position allowing him a deeper penetration, a fact he took advantage of immediately.
Coming to think of it, vomiting seemed to be not that bad an idea. But then again, he would have to move to get rid of his stomach's content and that was definitely not a good idea…
"You have no idea what awaits you. There are about 180 Vykélari in Britain alone who are of the right age to seek someone to mate. You are the first submissive in over 200 years, Harry and by now they will know of your existence." He stepped closer to Harry, his shoulders squared and his face set in an expression of so inflexible determination and stubbornness that Harry involuntarily took a step back before he could stop himself. Never had he felt the few inches that separated them more than at that very moment.
And still, Draco was right, Blaise was no exhibitionist and while he might indulge in dreams of devouring Harry's lips in front of his pretentious friends and imagining how they might react to seeing Harry forget himself and the world around him, quivering under Blaise's hands and lips, he wouldn't do it.
In any case, it was during that night that Draco finally realized that he couldn't keep on chasing death, and it was during that night, that he decided with whom and with what he wanted to spend his future with. He would honour his parents, his ancestors; he would raise the Malfoy name once again out of the pits of shame, he would see them at the very top of their society and he wouldn't rest before that. And that path was a path he wanted to walk with the very people that now celebrated with him.
That only left to prove that it was mutual, Blaise thought as he considered Harry, who was growing serious again in front of his eyes as he locked his intense green eyes on Draco.
But they should have known that Harry would ask for that at one point or the other, after all there was probably no one Harry trusted more; Draco doubted that even Harry's now former girlfriend Ginevra Weasley shared such a deep bond with the Saviour of the Wizarding World as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
Would that she could reach for her friend's hand, or at least share a few comforting words… but they were both alone in this nightmare. And in truth Narcissa would not have known how to approach the other. Weakness was not something that was acceptable in their world.
"Be careful to not transform too fast, Harry, or the growing wing bones might pierce the skin." Draco said softly, remembering the blood that had clung to those emerald wings in the hospital "Your magic will of course heal it immediately, but it smarts quite a bit. It often happens during the first transformation and whenever you are too distracted or impatient. But normally taking one or two seconds for the change will suffice to evade a rupture of the skin."
"Need some help?" the blonde smirked as he sliced away at last the bindings on Potter's wrist and took them in his slender hands, careful to avoid the sore regions, to help the younger man into a sitting position. The former Gryffindor clutched at Draco's hands, clinging to him as if he was his lifeline.
Then suddenly power flooded him again, dancing along his skin for a moment before penetrating it, invading him, rushing along his bone structure upwards, along his spine, into the back of his skull and he gasped, or rather chirped again at the strange, tingling sensation. It flew along his cheekbones, vanishing into the eyeballs. Harry squeezed his eyes shut.
Still, as if his uttered words had provided him with the necessary incitement, Draco recovered his bearings and his expression evened out into a polite mask, still friendly, but closed. Harry almost sighed: obviously he had once again breached some etiquette rule no one had bothered to tell him about. His unrest took shape further, when Draco kept silent and his eyes averted.
family! How stupid could you be, Blaise? How moronic? Kidnapping the Boy-Who-Lived is one thing, but giving him access to letter paper with
A mere moment later the gargoyle rose from its crouched position and Amalyne fell back and retreated a few steps. Intently the two women watched as the claws of its paw tore themselves away from the hidden door and its long dragon-tail uncurled from the socle, slithering back into the darkness. Clefts appeared in the previously seamless rock and a narrow but tall door slid open with the sound of stone grating upon stone, revealing a narrow staircase spiralling ever downward, illuminated by a flickering orange glow as if from dozen of candles.
He bowed over the bend form of his lover, looming over him and watching him writhe with every push, his fiancé, the pale beauty beneath him who was all tied up for him and completely and utterly at his mercy, trusting him to never use it against him.
With a sigh Harry laid down his fork. "But there is so much wrong with our society, and I'm sick of fighting for a sick world."
"It was not… I never…" Blaise licked his lips, at a loss of what to say, how to portray what he meant.
The increasing possibility of failure pierced Blaise's stomach then, like an electric shock, the firming notion that he might not be able to sway her, that he might be wasting even more precious time that he didn't have in the first place. Blaise's intent gaze hushed from one of Daphne's hazel eyes to the other, as if he could find the answers to vague, misty questions in her delicate features – what had made her so bitter and hostile in so short a time? Could he change her mind quickly enough for Harry? Should he rather give up, apologize for the inconvenience and go crawl back to Severus and, by implication, his mother and Draco's parents?
But the two Slytherin's would be dearly sorry if they actually went so far as to accuse him openly. Ron had been careful to word his promise in such a way that it had nothing to do with courting or marriage, just with the betrayal of trust - whatever they were to Harry when committing it.
Harry couldn’t but wet his lips and for some reason that made Draco’s smirk turn wider, his gaze more penetrating and invading and – by Merlin, that mad snake really wanted to jump down there. Harry glanced back down to the ground over three kilometres away, then back to Draco. They were utterly insane.
Harry shook his head once, twice, and tiredly rubbed over his face as he tried to clear his thoughts. He really needed to focus on the problem at hand and such an attitude wouldn't help him confront the two Slytherins.
"That is good to hear." Draco said calmly, inwardly relieved and pleased beyond measure, almost as if someone had cast a cheering charm on him. Of course, he knew that this was only one of many, yet unsolved problems he was facing and also that he could not always keep the connection closed - he even suspected that for the bond to function properly they would have to actively keep it open from time to time; but there was the
Before he could say anything, the young man in the alcove shifted where he stood and his voice – a nuance higher and smoother than Harry had expected from such an imposing figure – broke the heavy silence.
Harry laid his head back against Blaise’s shoulder, nudging his neck in a silent thank you because he didn’t think words would make it past the grin literally splitting his face in two, didn’t think that he would ever be able to explain the tsunami of emotions surging within him, flooding him. This had been worth everything, maybe even becoming a bird.
Only metres away her daughter skidded over the rough pathway, pushed further and further viciously while the abrasion first ate at her clothing and then her skin. Desperately her husband tried to reach the screaming woman as she passed him, having managed to hold onto one of the thicker trees, but at the critical moment, when their hands were about to touch, Harry's magic sharpened into invisible knives around them with vindictive glee, cleaving open the skin on the back of their hands and she was pulled into the darkness kicking and crying and screaming.
In any case, Blaise had to admit that the Mediwizard's statement was cleverly and beautifully incorporated into the article. He would have positioned it more closely to the end so that any reader would have those sentences fresh in their mind once finishing their lecture, but otherwise...
and Blaise rolled his eyes, only glad that the brunette had not been affronted by Draco's complacent manner, even though he had suspected she wouldn't. The last thing they needed right now was an angry Harry blaming them for deliberately annoying his friends.
"Well, to be truthful it is because the mating bond stabilizes the magic of those involved, making it accessible." Blaise answered, keeping his voice neutral and clinical; it would be inappropriate to show compassion when he was one of those seeking the benefits of such a mating.
Even though it peeved her endlessly while the two love-birds had been on their romantic little trip during which Blaise had proposed to Draco, and doubtlessly shagged him silly multiple times a day. Or the other way round. Really, her peers were usually just so
"And all you others: whatever happens, don't let him leave the grounds. But you may only use stunners yourself when Alfar has failed."
Entering his impressive office now, Minister Onorato Nascimbeni had never felt less superior. The entire situation was sliding out of control, and he needed, he
It was framed by dark, richly carved wood, looking like an oval window that opened to the sky outside, showing a sea of blue, streaked with white, drifting cotton-wool clouds and partly veiled by the large leaves of vine grapes that were twined around a wooden trellis framing the view of the painted window. Ripe, black grapes hung heavily from the vines, begging to be plucked and songbirds sat amidst the leaves and flew over the sky.
After another apparition they had made use of a certain magical signal normally used when trying to draw the attention of mobile wizarding facilities or vehicles and since apparently transportation was not the problem (they had apparated after all), Ettore guessed they had had dinner at the floating restaurant above Rome or Venice – it was the only other application for this kind of signal that he could think of. Afterwards they had apparated home and hadn't performed any more magic beyond the spells Ettore and his colleagues had witnessed when the two dominants had tried to keep Mr Potter within the wards of Lanai Manor.
Draco and Blaise take some precautious measures to keep Harry safe (alert Adler and Ives and give them House Elves so that they themselves can become active in an emergency, revoking Harry's ban to leave, tell the House Elves to prevent owl-post from reaching Harry, to protect him and to not let anyone enter the Manor's grounds,).
"Of course," Narcissa said. "I will contact them. They have been made aware of what Mr Potter is and with whom he is at the moment. They will not interfere or hinder you." Draco nodded his thanks. This was at least something to calm Harry with: his precious weasels knew about the situation and didn't have to fear for him needlessly.
One especially large lump flew right at Taide and he cringed, raising one arm in reflex to protect himself. But it wasn’t necessary: before it could splash against his skin, wings sprouted from its magical core, delicate and raven black. Within the blink of an eye the shapeless thing grew and elongated and formed a broad tail of fanned out black feathers, long legs with vicious claws, and a hawk-like head that ended in a curved, deadly gleaming beak.
Regardless, it had been a long time since he had been able to enjoy such carefreeness, such simple and meaningless fooling around and it had been nice, more than nice: liberating and exhilarating; and somehow he felt more like himself now – more like any normal teenager – than he had since the day Dumbledore had told him that he would have to become a killer to save everything and everyone he held dear.
But it also worked the other way round: with one mirror-connection between the bastard and Hermione and Ron, and another one to Harry himself, he couldn't attack either.
Still, after the amused laughter of his students had died away Lagorio had solemnly reminded them that a break in into a room stocked with some of the world's most dangerous potions and poisons could have had much more dire consequences for his family and he advised them to always treat their potions and wands with the care and caution they deserved.
Draco locked gazes with the brunet, engaging him in a staring contest and he felt oddly reminded of the times they had faced each other in the corridors of Hogwarts. He found he didn't like the analogy. "I would. Just say the word!"
. He was an endurance athlete, trained by Quidditch and war and his body bore testimony to that. Draco and Blaise were both taller and broader and he just knew it would make him even more self-conscious.
“No one really knows what the other does. Information gets scrambled, or lost. We have too few capable people available to validate and keep track of everything, never mind finding the connections between all those hints we get. And that is why people like Malfoy, who have the money and the right friends to get rid of compromising evidence and maybe even place false clues are going to go free!”
"Please forgive this charade." He said, in a voice smoother and slicker than it had been before. "But I had to stay on the save side in case you bailed on our agreement. You may call me Valerio." The man inclined his head, his dark eyes never leaving Harry's.
If Blaise was entirely truthful, he had to admit that Draco had never abandoned a friend, never in his life; of course he had never had to face such a decision, all his friends having been on his side of the war or at least neutral, carefully chosen individuals that mostly followed his rule without question or doubt until they had all abandoned him during his fall from grace.
"Don't ask." Harry said. "She is one of the smartest people I ever met, but she has no idea how the minds of normal people work. Truly."
"Master Blaise!" She cried shrilly, reminding him uncomfortably of the keening of a gull. "Master Blaise! Master Harry Potter is being forced to leave the manor!"
It made Harry's blood boil and rise into his cheeks and he made a jerky, abrupt step forward, before the realisation of his helplessness set in again. How he hated those mirror connections right now, hated that he couldn't raise his magic around him as coldly gleaming swords, long, sharp spears and heavy, spiked maces and show him how very much not submissive Harry was, how deadly an error it was to lay hands on those that Harry cared for so very much, whose presence in his life he valued and needed as a crucial part to his sanity. But his hands were hopelessly, tightly tied and in the cold, hard-edged knowledge of it, Harry's steps froze, having nothing to encounter the Italian's self-satisfaction with.
But just as he saw and heard the other House Elves appear in a line along the eastern wards a scream ripped through the air, chilling him to the core.
Of course he didn't accept all cases he was offered. For one, it would arouse suspicion if a not inconsiderable part of the defendants in the Death Eater trials would suddenly be released without any real punishment. And for another: even the Malfoy vaults were not infinite and Draco knew that one day the means he had to play this game would end. But for now, he was determined to push his luck.
It suited him better than the broad ones he had had when they had been swimming in the sea, Harry thought, as much as he seemed to love water.
"We only tried to keep him here because someone blackmailed him into leaving!" It was a desperate attempt, a useless attempt, and yet Draco still had to make it, to try one last time even though he knew that the guardia wouldn't listen, not when they had already revealed their partiality.
Ending the article by describing what would have happened to their Harry 300 years ago and then passing the ball to the ministry by appealing to its duty as the law enforcer and protector of its citizens as well as reminding them of the debt to Harry for fighting their war just gave proof to her goal.
It was partly a precaution against Narcissa, who, if she had truly found a way to gain as much power over Harry as she professed to have, must not be allowed to contact the young submissive at all; but it was also a measure targeting other dominant Vykélari and possibly some of the more fanatic followers of the light. There were many who would risk quite a lot to not see Harry bound to such powerful, dark families after all.
