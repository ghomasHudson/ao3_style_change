"Make it quick." He requested.
Harry waited for twenty minutes after Draco said he’d be there, before sending a message
“Not to you, no,” Harry said, eyeing her quill with distance. Hermione glared, but kept her distance.
“Promise me you’ll be ok,” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips.
“Sir, please, you’re causing a scene.” The manager said, looking around nervously. They had the attention of the whole dining room, so Draco’s voice became louder.
Harry snorted, bending in half as he put his head in his hands. He gave out some sort of wailing screech of pain and frustration. The concerned looks he received intensified.
"I can’t wait for summer to be over. You know, maybe we can meet up at Diagon again, or get a private hotel room somewhere.”
“What?” Draco questioned angrily. “You’re making him choose?” His eyes found Harry’s, then went back to Ron. He pushed Harry aside lightly so he could speak to Ron directly.
While Harry was pondering his existence, Draco placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I’ll see you around, Harry.” Then he was leaving. When he turned the corner, Harry touched the spot on his face where Draco had kissed him. He had known before now that he had a crush on Draco, but now he was thinking it might come to fruition. Draco had to like him back if he was kissing him! He wasn’t sure how to go about starting something with him, however.
Harry led Draco to a small corner café that specialized in soup and sandwiches. Harry insisted on paying since Draco brought breakfast, but Draco held his protest firmly for the entirety meal. He seemed a little flushed when Harry put down the money but was said he was fine when asked.
“Right,” Draco confirmed. “He even forbade the elves from going near her, I guess he thought we might try something anyway, but we don’t even know what type of poison he used, so it would’ve been too late.”
“I’m just wondering if there’s nothing to say. That Harry has really told us everything.” They thought he was a liar?
“Look,” Harry said, holding up his hands, “I will admit, he was bad that year. He had his reasons, and you’re welcome to ask him why he acted that way, but I won’t say. He was upset, and wrongfully took out his frustrations on us. It was wrong, but it was six years ago. Get over it.”
He debated what he needed to do about the party, whether it should come from a letter or if he should go over there in person. In the end, he decided to go over there. Mrs. Weasley deserved to hear it from him.
“That man! I just can’t believe that man! Never have I ever met someone so selfish—” She was talking more to herself, barely under her breath, but Harry could still hear plenty.
“Er…ok.” Harry decided to just go with it and let Draco take his clothes off. He would clue him in eventually. After stepping out of his trousers, Harry placed his hands on either of Draco’s hips, stroking lightly and wondering what was coming next.
Harry paused in his pacing to look at his husband, only momentarily pausing to thrill at the title. “I don’t know, Harry.” Draco stood and joined him, cupping his cheek lovingly. “I admit, I might be wrong about this Soul Bond thing, as it doesn’t explain everything, but maybe we have something different, something more, or maybe the descriptions weren’t completely accurate from back them. Or something else is going on in addition to the Soul Bond. I don’t know. But I’m happy enough with the explanation to move on. I’m sure we’ll figure it out eventually, and if there are any other components, we’ll figure that out, too.”
Harry wasn’t convinced of the significance of the memory, but it was definitely important to Dumbledore. He paced around the room and thought aloud to Harry. They decided that Voldemort had six horcruxes, splitting his soul seven times. Two had already been destroyed. That left four, which was suddenly a huge number. Harry went back to his dormitory stunned and dismayed.
Draco shook his head slightly. His grip tightened on Harry’s hand. “It’s a cursed injury.” He said gently. “There’s nothing more a healer could do than what we’ve already done. Whoever did heal me did a good job of it. There’s nothing left but to let time heal, as it should.” Harry looked down.
He should really mourn him, but that would come later. For now, he told Draco everything he had missed the last couple days, with long periods of silence in between missives. He left out the part about the Horcruxes, wanting to work up to that. Draco let him take his time talking, and Harry appreciated that more than he was able to say.
“You’re lucky I’m not the Aurors. We received no less than 53 reports that you were in the Alley. You couldn’t have waited for the evening prophet, at least? It’s been less than an hour since you were declared innocent. Interesting, how quickly you found out,” she said, her eyes going to Remus and Harry, who both shifted guiltily. Mary smiled.
“No, it’s a truthful assessment of your tastes.”
I really hope people get notified that there's a new chapter. I edited it so the outtake you got last week is in its own story, you can find it under my author page or next in the series if you missed it.
Moody’s wooden leg echoed around the room as he came closer to the group. “’They’ are whoever actually did put Potter’s name in the Goblet. ‘They’ are the person or people who performed complex magical enchantment on the Goblet, tricking it into thinking that it had to pick four names, not three; well beyond what Potter here, or any student, is capable of. ‘They’ is whoever has a plan that will likely result in Potter either losing his life or his magic.”
Harry grunted as he stretched out on his bed at the Lupercal. He had just awoken after a particularly pleasant dream and after he put his arms back down, he lay there thinking. Sirius had let him sleep in, usually he got Harry up to make breakfast. Sirius tried, but something always went wrong, and the results were only sometimes even edible. He sniffed the air, yes, there was the scent of burnt food in the air. He chuckled but didn’t get up. He had a right to laze around today, after all, it was his birthday.
Sirius hugged him for much longer than he ever had, Harry even began feeling awkward. Still, he remembered that there had been a time when no one wanted to hug him, so he wasn’t about to take any hug for granted.
Sirius was already gone for the day, so Harry made a quick breakfast. “You’re welcome to come with me, I don’t want you to think I’m purposefully leaving you out.” Harry told him as they dug in. “I just don’t want you to be bored as I drag you all over Diagon Alley.”
Just like that, Harry thought the year couldn’t get any worse. Then, his History of Magic final happened. He fell asleep halfway through and had a vision from Voldemort. He had had several over the year, but this was easily the most traumatic. He fell out of his chair, screaming, seeing Sirius behind his eyelids. Hundreds of eyes turned to stare at him, but he didn’t care, all he cared about was getting to Sirius.
“Well…” Draco sighed. “It’s not like I don’t want you to know, it’s just uncomfortable for me, is all. I’ll tell you someday, alright?”
“There’s more. She was already so close to me, and she gave me this look, and I realized she wanted to kiss me, right before she went for it. I tried to back up, but she followed me. I ducked out as soon as I could, and it was just for a second, I swear.” He said this all very fast. Draco’s smile had slowly melted from his face.
“Er…we don’t know.” Sirius moaned this time.
“What if Voldemort tries to get at what you want to tell me?”
“See you after the Feast? Think you can get away?” Harry nodded, and Draco disappeared out the door. Harry waited a minute and exited as well. The train was empty, but Harry realized he had to double check and make sure someone had gotten his trunk. They had, but the train started moving as he left the compartment.
“Like how some people don’t like homosexuals?” Draco asked, his eyes were changed, hardened but far more understanding.
“Forget it. I don’t need to know.”
Ginny turned and ran and ran and ran. It was the only way she could hope to escape. She pushed people out of the way, some were laughing at her, and that only served to make her sob. She hadn’t cried since Harry had asked someone else to the Yule Ball. It was a point of pride with her that she never cried, but this was a very special occasion, considering her heart had just been broken into millions of pieces.
He wandered around for a bit, thinking about his priorities and found himself at the entrance to his and Draco’s secret room. He took a deep breath and went in.
It was entirely possible that Draco wouldn’t eat something that had been sent to him anonymously, and he was right. He had a school owl deliver the package with the morning mail, and watched the delight brighten Draco’s face. He frowned at the note, reading it several times before his eyes roved around him. Most people were either eating or reading their own mail, their eyes lowered to their plates, so it was easy for their eyes to connect.
Oh, no. Harry wasn’t sure. “I don’t know,” he admitted softly, looking at his shoes. Madam Malkin was bent near them, completely engrossed in whatever it was she was doing with his robes.
Harry looked up, glare fierce, and she recoiled back.
Draco picked out their comfortable but stylish outfits for the day, as usual, and Harry convinced him to wear trainers instead of the dragon hide dress-shoes he normally went with.
Draco also insisted on going on more dates. They would go to a movie every week, sometimes twice a week, they saw Hercules more than once. Draco calmed his reactions down the longer they spent in the theater. They also found another cinema that played classic movies that they tried to go to. They found museums, art galleries, and other muggle educational attractions that Draco liked. He mostly dragged Harry around while Harry shifted from foot to foot and looked around in boredom, before Draco came up with games to hold Harry’s interest. At the art galleries, they had a contest at every panting to see who could come up with the better story for what was going on in the painting. Sometimes that including noticing the details and coming up with a realistic story, other times, it was the most entertaining. The silly arguments over who won would last through several paintings, sometimes hours or days when something else would come up, only to be returned to later.
Year 2 Part 1/2
He settled the hand on his shoulder as Draco tilted his head, his face looking about as open as Harry felt. “I don’t mind so much when it’s you.” He confessed quietly.
“Harry?” Sirius called from inside his pocket.
Sirius shrugged. “It’s your day; just remember, the longer you ride for, the shorter time we have at the park.” Harry groaned, he wanted to do both.
Draco was amazed at all the muggle attractions, and all that there was to learn. Harry went out to the London tourist information center and got pamphlets for everything he thought Draco would want to see. They went through them and Draco put them in order of what he would most like to visit. Harry didn’t really care what they saw first, the excitement Draco showed was enough to him. Sometimes Sirius would join them on his days off, but he would also go visit Remus, which he seemed to be doing more and more frequently.
“Get a hit in Harry,” George yelled, and when he moved Harry tackled him. They landed in a heap on the ground right next to Draco. “What the hell?” George yelled. “Harry, get off me!” He threw a punch that hit Harry on the cheek. He was winded and lost his footing, falling half on George, and moved around trying to get off him.
There was a pause, and Harry took the moment to summon paper to write out what Draco was saying. The drawback of the bracelet was it was incredibly small and not much could be saved on it. As he did that, he took a moment to appreciate what Draco was telling him, and what it must be costing him.
“Merlin, no. Did our mishap with Slughorn teach you nothing? Nobody would dose me with amortentia just for me. They want the Chosen One. The bloody Saviour.” Harry spat the word like it was the poison. “That’s all any of them want me for.”
Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and mussed it up even more than it had been. Draco groaned into the kiss and pushed up into him. He unbalanced Harry and rolled on top him, straddling his hips. Harry wound his fingers through blond hair and bucked his hips up. They moaned together at the contact and Draco threaded his fingers in Harry’s hair. He pulled him up and into his arms and Harry gasped at the change in position. Draco pulled on his hair and dragged his teeth against his bottom lip.
“I suppose not wanting to be in the same house as the person who killed your family makes sense.”
“How long have I been asleep?”
“The what?”
“What is it?” Draco leaned closer to him.
“Can I help you with something, Malfoy?”
“Look at you.” Draco huffed into the air between them. He pulled on Harry’s hair and shivered at the groan it pulled from Harry’s lips. Draco started kissing his neck and collarbone, occasionally stopping to nibble and suck. “I love how responsive you are for me.”
“You’re right. It is a bit odd.” Malfoy shook his head but a smile tugged at his lips.
“Oi! You offer Harry a job but not your own brother?” Ron glared down the table at George.
“I don’t know about all that.” Draco laid a hand on his arm. “But just because I’ll be on the continent doesn’t mean I can’t be here for you. And Hermione is here for you.”
“Potter?” Malfoy sounded far away now. Maybe he had decided to find his own abandoned classroom. Harry had been here first after all. “Really, now, come off it. You’re acting ridiculous.” Was he laughing? Or crying? He couldn’t tell and he didn’t really care. “What in the bloody hell is so funny, Potter?”
Harry watched his hand on Draco’s cock. He watched the ripple of muscles in his thighs and abdomen as he jerked his hips. Draco was biting his bottom lip, making it even more red than it had been earlier. Harry reached up with his other hand and tweaked one of Draco’s nipples. He groaned and tossed his head back. Encouraged by the response, Harry leaned down and sucked on the hard nub. Draco tangled his fingers in his hair and pulled, jerking Harry’s head up to kiss him messily. Harry’s own cock twitched in interest at the move but Draco was coming with a low moan. Harry pulled away and rolled to his side.
“You’re not making any sense, Ron.” Harry rubbed his eyes tiredly under his glasses. “Draco wouldn’t go through all of the work and trouble slipping me amortentia would be just to have me.” Harry and Ron stared at each other in silence and Ron laughed once.
“But I really don’t like you hanging around Malfoy so much.”
“He loves me. In his own way. I think.” Draco moved to sit on the bed across from him. “What is this about, Harry?”
“It said I had a thirst to prove myself. And that I was capable of greatness and Slytherin would help me to achieve greatness.”
“Merlin, you are so fucking beautiful.” Draco leaned down and kissed him. That wasn’t quite the response Harry had been expecting but who was he to argue. Harry was thoroughly distracted by Draco’s mouth that he didn’t notice what his hand was doing until he felt cool fingers wrap around his straining cock.
“I promise.” A pause. “Harry?”
“Honestly, I wasn’t sure you even knew that.” Harry was surprised when Malfoy laughed once.
Distantly, he could hear someone talking. It was Malfoy. What the hell did he even want? Why was he still here? Harry would have asked except when he opened his mouth to speak, all he could do was take a gasping breath. It was hard to tell in the dim light of the room but he could see spots threatening to take over his vision. He wasn’t getting enough oxygen. Because he couldn’t breathe.
“Not really. Truth be told, I think I was a bit shite. If it hadn't been for your mother, I never would have made it out.”
“Yeah. This is different though. Then he just didn’t believe me. This is...part of me.”
“I’m glad you get it but it isn’t fine. None of this is fine, darling.” Draco pushed his hair back from his forehead again and tightened his grip. “But you are right about one thing. What’s done is done. And it cannot be undone.”
“Well, I suppose I set myself up for that.”
“Like I said, it‘s over.”
“I like that sneer a lot more when it isn’t directed at me.” Harry reached up to brush his knuckles against his cheek. Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t pull away from the gentle touch.
“I do apologize. But it was too easy. You walked right into it.”
“But that’s wonderful news!” Molly looked around at them all bewildered. “Isn’t that what you wanted to do after school, Harry?”
“Now that we’re on a first name basis and I know that you’re actually rather amusing when you aren’t being a total prat? I don’t know, Draco. I think we have years of me obsessing over you yet.”
“He really will come around, Harry.” Hermione gave him a smile. “As it is, he, Ginny, and Charlie are having quite the shouting match in the Common Room.”
“Yeah. I mean, what’s not to like?” She shrugged. “So, does that mean you fancy a bloke?”
“Honestly, Draco, it’s over. What’s done is done. There’s no point--”
“Yes, of course. Why wouldn’t we be?”
“Yes, but what do we want?” Draco almost sounded frightened. Like a lost boy. And really, weren’t they both? Harry reached out and took his hand. Their fingers intertwined and Harry squeezed.
Harry didn’t know why, but something about what Draco said hit him like a physical blow. He started shaking and the tears were becoming more difficult to hold back. Draco stroked his cheeks with his thumbs. It wasn’t until he smeared a tear across his cheek that Harry realized he was crying.
“Yes, I do.” Harry sat up and pulled his knees up to his chest. “I heard your parents talking after the battle. They were talking about leaving England.”
“Are you two friends now?” Harry looked at her and raised an eyebrow.
“You aren’t...angry with me?”
“Good. I would hate for you to stay closed in your little Gryffindor world.” He hesitated before he leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry’s. Okay. Well. Not just joking then. Draco pulled back but he didn’t get far before Harry leaned up to kiss him again. Everything about this should be awkward and awful and wrong. Why didn’t he feel any of that? He should be thinking of Ginny.
“I don’t know.” Draco sighed. “A few years at least. I am going to try and get into the Healer program over there.”
“Mum is going to kill Kingsley next time we see him.” George sounded like he couldn’t wait to see his mum shouting at an Auror.
“If that’s all right with you, Mrs. Weasley.” He accepted the plate from her with a nod. Of course, Draco would know just how to behave.
“He has offered Harry a position training to be an Auror.” Percy adjusted his glasses and set the letter back down.
“Well, it turns out that I’m attracted to blokes too.” Harry sighed.
“As tempting as that is, it really isn’t healthy for either of us to stay cooped up in here. And if we miss breakfast, Molly may come looking for us. Or worse, my mother.” Harry heaved a sigh and fell back on the bed.
“Concerns? What concerns?”
“Something you want to say, Ron?” Harry tried to keep his voice even and calm. He didn’t want a full-blown row with his best friend this morning. It had started out so well.
“How’s Mary? I haven’t seen her since Christmas.” Harry asked as he took a seat on the couch next to Draco.
Harry nodded. “You didn’t have to do that, it’s your night, you should get what you want.”
was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Draco fucking himself was an incredible sight. He wished for a brief moment it was his own flesh-colored cock inside Draco, not this purple one. He snorted at himself, jealous of a plastic, purple dildo. Their time would come, just as Draco had said. He was getting tired of his own mood swings, however.
“We probably won’t eat it, Dobby, you don’t need to do that.”
He really was a baby. He was in tears, and he held the letter close to his chest. He sniffed it carefully and inhaled Harry’s faint scent. He missed Harry so much. This was just what he needed for today.
Draco’s dessert was treacle tart he had painstakingly nicked from dinner and put under a preservation charm he had spent weeks practicing. Harry thanked him thoroughly. It was quite late and they were tired by the time they decided to call it a night. Harry almost wished they could sleep in the same bed again, but it would be much different to do it as boyfriends than friends, and it gave Harry a slightly sick feeling to think about. It would be much too risky to sneak either of them into the other’s Common Rooms, anyway.
“Well I do.” Then he rattled off something in French and Harry felt heat flood his face and stomach. Hearing the silky words coming from Draco’s talented mouth, he felt himself getting excited. He suddenly understood why French was known as the romance language. “Anything to say?” Draco asked, amused. Harry shook his head, and he realized his mouth was slightly open.
Harry started plating the food, “It was thanks to you actually. The day after you broke into Gryffindor the first time in my third year, Draco realized how much I meant to him and kissed me. So, thanks for that!” He put Sirius’s plate in front of him and sat down opposite him. Sirius raised his goblet in a silent toast to Harry.
, the you you are when it’s just you and me. The you that treats me with such gentleness and kindness. That person yesterday was so mean, and I know that you aren’t really like that. I’m just so tired, with having to pretend we hate each other, all the fighting, all the lying. It’s really hard, babe.”
“What’s the problem, Potter? Afraid you’re going to lose?” Harry glared.
“So, you will sleep in the next bed over then?”
“I’m fine,” Draco said tensely. He extracted himself from Harry’s grasp and went to go sit in his armchair. Harry followed hesitatingly.
“My Father did not approve of it, however, so I was forced to call it off. Instead, we became enemies, and I will admit, that was mostly due to me being so angry at the unfairness of it all. I became a bully, and I know I have bullied a lot of you here, and for that, I apologize. I will not ever be able to describe how much pain I was in that year, and I took it out on my peers, for that, I’m sorry.” Draco took a moment to make eye contact with several people in their year, including Neville, Ron and Hermione. “I’ll admit I was jealous that you all were allowed to be friends with Harry while I was not, but that certainly doesn’t excuse my actions.” Harry put a hand on Draco’s shoulder to show their solidarity.
“We’ve already made arrangements,” said Hermione.
“Oh, dear Merlin,” Fred said, falling over on Ron’s lap, who had gone rather pale. He was very purposefully not looking at Harry, focusing on his meal, but Fred forced him to engage. He pushed Fred upward, mumbling something, and glanced up at Harry.
Harry finally smiled, and they disapparated, landing in the living room. “I actually have something to give you before you do that. Go to the bedroom, I’ll meet you there, and don’t take your clothes off.” Draco laughed before he walked off.
Harry considered it and regretted it later when he decided not to go with it. Who would it have hurt to have the game postponed? After the match, he had other reasons to be regretful. One, they lost the match to Hufflepuff, and two, Harry’s beloved broomstick, the Nimbus 2000, was destroyed.
“And how do I look?” Draco raised an eyebrow. Harry stared down at him.
“Potter, what are you on about?” Malfoy jumped up to sit on one of the desks in the room. His tone wasn’t mocking, like Harry had expected. He sounded genuinely confused. And maybe a tad concerned.
“My mother?”
“Nah, I saw them just before. It’s a long story. Only person I saw after I died was Dumbledore.”
“That was where the Sorting Hat wanted to put me, you know?” Harry pulled his knees up to his chest. “I should have let it. Maybe if I’d been a Slytherin, Snape wouldn’t have hated me so much. Maybe he would have trusted me. Told me the truth ages ago.” Harry choked out a mirthless laugh. “Maybe I would have figured it out all on my own.”
“Draco, I’m a big boy. I promise. Just tell me.”
“No, Hermione. I wouldn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.” He pulled away from her. “I’m not hungry anyway.” Harry stalked out of the hall and through the front doors. He needed some fresh air. He walked to the tree where the Marauders had sat after their OWLs all those years ago. Christ but he missed them all. Well, maybe not all of them.
“I dunno. Maybe it wouldn’t have mattered.” Harry shook his head. “Certainly it wouldn’t have changed much. I still would have had to die.”
“Harry, please stay.”
“Come off it.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “We all know you didn’t actually die. You must have given a spectacular performance, Potter. To convince the Dark Lord you were dead.” Harry huffed out a laugh.
“Just what are you suggesting, Mr. Malfoy?” Harry lifted his head and grinned at Draco.
“So the only people who are allowed to give a shite about me is your family? Everyone else has ulterior motives?”
“Fine. ‘M fine.” Ron stared down at his plate. Charlie rolled his eyes and turned back to his discussion with Percy. It sounded like they were talking about politics and if there was anything Harry could not understand, it was that.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice came through the door. It creaked open and then closed again. “Are you all right?”
“Draco?”
“To breathe, Harry.” Draco pulled back and jerked his head to get his hair out of his eyes. “I always knew that you would be the death of me.” Harry opened his mouth to respond but Draco cut him off. He reached up and ran his fingers through blond hair. Draco huffed into the kiss and Harry knew he hated to have his hair mussed. But he would risk it. It seemed that one thing had not changed. Harry had always been willing to risk life and limb for Draco. For one reason or another. And Draco could always drive Harry insane.
Up in the Great Hall, surrounded by friends and family, he would have to be the strong and brave hero. For some, they would expect the Chosen One. An almost mythological hero. For others, they would expect strength and comfort. They would expect leadership. Upstairs, in the Great Hall, in the real world, things were expected of him.
“Yeah, you were. I owe you two now.”
“I can try. Your mum never took the Dark Mark and you were underage at the time. And only took the Mark under threat of death to yourself and your family. That’s gotta count for something.”
“That's what mothers do, isn't it? My mum died to protect me. Your mum lied to protect you. Think she would have dueled Voldemort herself if she had to.” He rubbed his arms to bring some warmth back into them. He could still see his own mother giving him a reassuring smile.
“Wha’…no. Well yes, he put a couple under the cruciatus, but he said he forgave them.”
Draco stared at him, “what do you mean?”
“Nothing. I just opened it, too. It’s not like I needed to be told to leave. But it is strange. Who could it be from?”
They repositioned slightly until they were lying face to face, inches apart on Harry’s pillow. They laid in silence for a while and then Draco was whispering, “why did you do it?”
He had found a fairly simple spell for keeping the Dursleys away from his belongings and after a few attempts succeeded. At least he figured it worked, since they didn’t attempt to come near the magical belongings.
“Your trust vault? That’s different from the family vault?”
“I figured this would be a good way for us to sneak around.” Harry said. “May I escort you to your common room, my liege?” He accompanied this with a small bow.
“Oh.” For the first time that day, Draco’s face fell. Harry regretted asking immediately.
Harry didn’t send any more gifts, but sometimes he saw something in Draco’s eyes when they threw insults at each other in passing. The confrontations increased, leaving Harry to wonder if Draco was seeking him out. Harry found himself enjoying them, as unhealthy as he was sure that was. Draco had a way of crafting words into art, and he liked being able to use his sass and wit to someone who appreciated it.
“You’ve got some nerve, Malfoy! Detention! Minister, I didn’t know…”
“Be careful, Weasley. It would be in your best interest to respect your superiors.”
On the next Friday, Draco insisted on taking Harry and Sirius to the restaurant they got take-out from and it ended up being a weekly tradition to go out to a new place. They would usually get an extra meal and eat that the next day in the living room.
It was white on top of white, and it surprised Harry. He would have thought it would be modeled like the Slytherin common room, all silver, black and green. His comforter was green, but everything else was a pristine white. It was almost too bright, and it rather hurt to look at for too long, especially in such a huge room.
“Complaints? For what? You have a problem with me holding my fiancé’s hand? What about that couple in the corner, who have been swapping saliva since before we came in? I wonder if you’re going to go over there and ask them to ‘tone it down.’” Draco glared, and while Harry was upset about what was happening, he took a moment to be thankful he had Draco, and that Draco was who he was, not taking shit from anybody.
He was so angry. “All year, all fucking year, I have been trying to tell every one of you something was going to happen. Maybe if even one of you had listened to me, even thought it was possible, just for a minute… But no. Harry’s gone crazy. Nobody listen to Harry, he has no idea.”
After all that, trying hard for someone else, not seeing the results, I guess I forgot how to try for myself. I was so burnt out when I got to Hogwarts, but this place is really incredible. I know you’re probably rolling your eyes at me, but we’re studying magic! “Yeah, Potter that’s the point,” you’re probably saying. But I wasted a whole year and a half not learning everything I possibly could. So, I think I’m going to start trying again.
Harry came to awareness slowly. There was an annoying beeping noise, and he silenced it with his wand. It was his wand, so that worked out. Draco was so beautiful in his sleep. His mouth was open, and he was snoring. Harry kissed his nose and Draco hummed. “Five more minutes.” He muttered/demanded. Harry was powerless to deny him.
Harry hummed in agreement. “That’s true. I guess I’ve just never been this happy before.” Draco positively beamed at that pronouncement and gave him yet another kiss.
"I'm bisexual." He said quietly, though firmly. Draco pulled away only slightly so he could meet Harry's eyes, though Harry felt the smile there. "You don't mind?" He asked.
“Great. Do you know when they’re releasing you, Hermione?”
“Good luck,” Hermione whispered, briefly placing her hand on his shoulder.
He ignored Hermione, who was giving him speculative looks. He had forgotten that she was trying to find out his secret, maybe she thought Sally-Anne was the person he was seeing.
“We didn’t quite break up then, but things were so tense, and it was like something had broken between us. I figured we would have any day, but before anything could happen, I was being carted off to Azkaban.” There was silence as Sirius’ story came to an apparent close. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say. There were no words of comfort he could think of. Then, Sirius continued.
“Why would Voldemort come for me? I’m nobody to him. And with Father in prison all the responsibilities of the head of the house of Malfoy fall to me. I need to be in the manor, taking care of things. Harry, this is important. I was afraid of my Father, but my Father is out of the picture. Hopefully until I graduate. This summer, I’ll get everything into place for me to run away when he gets out. This is the break I’ve been praying for, everything will work out now, just wait, you’ll see.”
“I see.” McGonagall said, and she looked stunned. She glanced between the two of them. “Is this true, Mr. Potter?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The conversation he listened in on was certainly interesting. Draco said he may not come back next year, and Harry wondered what he was talking about. Was that a plan to avoid his Father’s influence? If so, why was he talking about it in front of his Slytherin friends? And why was he implying that he was a Death Eater? That was the second time he had heard Draco imply that. He felt cold fear grip his heart. He still couldn’t believe it was true, maybe it was a power play Draco was working, or something he had to play along with. Whatever was going on, he had made a mistake coming in here. He should just trust Draco and not try to spy on him, what he was doing was despicable.
George chuckled. “To answer your question: alright. We’re going to have to close the store soon, I think. Go back to owl order until after the war. Death Eaters attacked the store last week. The wards held up,” he added quickly to Harry’s horrified look. “And we got everyone out, no one got hurt. I think it’s the You-Know-Poo they have a problem with.”
Harry leaned forward to kiss Draco’s forehead, as Draco had done to him several times. “I’m sorry, Baby.” Harry whispered.
Harry frowned, feeling his heart twist over Draco’s plight. “I’m so sorry, Baby. I wish there was something I could do.”
Draco snorted. “I’m perfectly fine, Harry. No worse for wear. And I certainly have reason to have Moody dismissed over this.”
Harry’s anger, which had receded during the meal, began rising, as it did pretty frequently lately. Maybe if it hadn’t, he wouldn’t have said, “It’s the first rule for a quiet life at the Dursley’s.” He felt vindictive pleasure at the concerned looks he received. Let them be worried for him, he had a deficit of it this summer.
Draco gulped. “Father?”
Sally sighed. “I don’t know. McGonagall said we couldn’t go together, but I think she meant we couldn’t dance together either. I looked it up, and apparently same sex couples are in and of itself more accepted than in the muggle world, but with most upscale events, it’s frowned upon. Pureblood society rules are fascinating to me. So, it’s totally fine to have a lover the same sex as you, but only before a marriage contract is written and after an heir is produced. Sometimes it’s even allowed during the marriage if it’s written into the contract or the spouse is ok with it. Which is apparently pretty common. I just don’t understand why, if it’s so widely accepted, it’s not ok to just get married and adopt and skip that whole false marriage business. It seems more wrong to me. Of course, I’m one of those people who would benefit. In the muggle world, I think one of the main arguments against gay people is it would ruin the sanctity of marriage, in my opinion, marrying someone just to produce an heir is more devastating to the sanctity of marriage than two people who love each other who happen to have the same parts. Harry?”
Instead of talking about anything, they just smiled at each other, avoiding eye contact and giggling breathlessly before they turned into full blown laughs. “What is so funny?” Harry asked, still laughing.
“And he’d better.”
“But, Mother—”
The one thing he knew he absolutely could not afford, but wanted more than anything else, was the brand-new broomstick, the Firebolt. He was practically drooling as he imagined flying on it.
“You couldn’t find her?” Hermione asked as Harry took a seat in front of the fireplace. Ron glared at him, and Harry shifted uncomfortably.
He was looking at Harry like he was the most precious gem he had ever seen, like he couldn’t believe he had been honored enough to actually see him. He kissed Harry gently, reverently, his hands on either side of Harry’s face. When he pulled back, he looked at Harry’s eyes and shook his head slightly.
“Not happening. I can’t believe I didn’t get you anything. I’m going to—”
loved Draco.
“Do you want kids?” Draco asked, as if he couldn’t wait any longer. Harry looked up at him.
“He doesn’t! If he did, he would have already done it. I rescued him from the Manor. Don’t you think if he wanted to set up a trap, that would have been the best time?”
“Sirius, you can transform. Draco already knows about you.” Sirius gave him a stunned look, before standing and indeed transforming. He sat on the bed slowly, now in human form. He stared at Draco.
Harry examined Draco’s foot carefully, making sure there were no obvious injuries, and Draco had a moment of thankfulness that he had Harry. His long, dark lashes brushed against the lens of his glasses when he blinked, and Draco felt himself fall even more in love with him.
Hermione bit her lip. “I wouldn’t have done anything if Malfoy hadn’t cursed him.” She defended herself weakly.
“I feel so…good.”
With the waves crashing to one side, their temporary home to the other, the sand beneath their toes, the sun above them, and isolation to their backs, the setting was absolutely perfect, although Harry would never have guessed it.
“Ha ha,” Harry said sarcastically. “You know Sally-Anne, from the Ball last year? Her girlfriend? She didn’t show up this year. She’s pretty upset.”
“Who is ‘they’?”
The next day, bad news came in threes. Umbridge was made ‘High Inquisitor’ by the Ministry of Magic, Hermione said it wasn’t good. Percy sent Ron a letter basically telling him to stay away from Harry. Sirius got back to Harry through the mirrors to exchange some news. He had tried to talk to him the day before, but Sirius had been busy and asked if he could contact him later. Harry had nodded, hoping his scar hurting with Umbridge touched him wasn’t that important.
Harry wasn’t even sure if he believed him. The Dursleys certainly didn’t love him, and they were supposed to. How could Draco, who by all accounts had every reason not to even like him, love him? Did he even need it? He had convinced himself at a young age that he didn’t to survive.
“Is that a crime now? Lay off the man, Hermione.” Ginny glared at her then turned to Harry. “I enjoy seeing you so cheerful, Harry. Your smile looks good on you.”
“Are you going to allow that bitch to speak to us like that?” He demanded of the manager.
He tried to keep the accusation out of his words, but he might not have succeeded. “No, he said that it would be best if I didn’t act as if I hated you. I guess that you missed the part where I asked. He said that I was not to make friends with you, but I shouldn’t make a point of saying how much I hate you in public. I don’t, by the way, hate you. He said that I should continue as I have been for now, but not let my feelings cloud what must be done. I don’t know what he means by that,” he added at Harry’s confused look.
“Yes.” Draco cocked his head, looking at him in slight confusion.
“…And it’s me or him. I have to kill him or die trying. I can’t…I don’t know what to do, Draco.” Draco was crying with him, and they hugged tightly. They were both openly sobbing, and Harry felt just a tiny bit better. He couldn’t lose Draco, no matter what else happened in his life, however long it lasted, he was so lucky to have Draco. He did remember the part where Voldemort had possessed him, how thoughts of his love for Draco had saved him. He hadn’t told Dumbledore that it had been Draco he was thinking about, he had assumed Harry was thinking of Sirius and Harry didn’t correct him. Draco couldn’t be lost to the world, no matter what.
Harry kissed his knuckles. “My fiancé needs a ring.” Draco gasped and pulled him inside.
Harry squeezed back, happy feeling nearly exploding. He looked down at the map to gather himself for a moment. “Let’s go to the left and circle around that way,” he decided. “Most people are going to the right.” Sirius and Draco both nodded, not checking to see if Harry was correct.
“Ron and Hermione are here!” Sirius repeated from the living room downstairs. Harry hastily hid his presents and ran out to meet them.
The weeks passed by very quickly, and soon it was almost time for term break. The final meeting of the D.A. had let out, and Harry was the third to last person in the room. The two others were Cedric and Cho.
Harry jumped as Moody slapped him across the face. He touched his cheek in bewilderment. “You were panicking, Potter. Now pay attention, how did the Dark Lord treat his followers?”
Professor McGonagall sighed, half in relief half in exasperation. In what Harry figured was rather out of character, she sat on the bed next to Harry. “Mr. Potter, earlier this evening, Sirius Black made an attempt to enter the Gryffindor Common Room. No one saw anything except Violet, the portrait guardian,” she added at Harry’s confused look. “And she couldn’t say if he had actually entered or not. When it became apparent that you were in the Common Room at the time, there was concern as to your wellbeing. It appears, however, that Black was unable to enter, and you are no worse for wear.”
He ducked, and it flew over his head, hitting a Death Eater in the distance. Voldemort was still screaming, still throwing curses, they were heading straight to Harry, and he didn’t have his wand. He dodged all of them, but that last one, whatever it was, headed at him, and there was no escape. He was going to die.
“I know how badly Black wants me, Hermione, despite you treating me like I have no clue, and I noticed you two haven’t once even attempted to warn me, about how he was my parents’ best friend, our secret keeper, my godfather?!”
“I will always love you, no matter what happens next.” Umbridge was in front of them, leading the way. It was a risk, but one Harry really, really wanted to take. His eyes met Draco’s, who flitted to Umbridge, then he was kissing Harry, quickly and silently, still moving forward. “Promise me you’ll be ok?”
“It’s a long story. I’m not sure, either. Hermione just told me to meet her and it was super important.”
“But—” Draco silenced him with a kiss.
Draco winked at him, gave him a kiss that Harry tried desperately to extend, and pulled away. “Nuh-uh. Don’t try and distract me, I have some work to do. Just read your book for a while, alright?”
“How dare you! Using my own spells against me!” Horror claimed Harry. “That’s right Potter! I know you stole my old potions book. Mine, the Half-Blood Prince’s!”
Draco seemed to realize after the next shop that Harry was reaching the end of his tether. “We can continue some other time.” He said, when Harry asked if he was sure he wanted to leave. He wasn’t sure whether he was relieved or scared.
“Husband.” He agreed before leaning in for another kiss.
The Slytherins told Dumbledore how they had seen Harry in Hogsmeade, but in a surprising twist, a number of Gryffindors swore up and down that they had seen Harry that day walking around various areas of the castle and grounds. Before he knew it, Dumbledore’s office was filled with students all claiming to have seen him. Harry did notice that they were mostly his new friends and friends of friends he had made while not speaking to Ron and Hermione and found another reason to keep up with those relationships.
“Damn. I really thought I was going to win that one.”
“But—”
Harry came forward through the crowd of scarlet Gryffindors, pushing people aside to get to her. “Here!” He yelled over the noise and thrusted the cup towards her. “Our best chaser deserves a minute!”
“Well?” He demanded. “No one will tell me.” He looked frantic as he stared at all of them. Remus pushed him forward.
“It’s going to scar if you don’t get treatment.”
“OH NO YOUU DON’T, LADDIE!” Moody bellowed, and the white ferret zoomed back to the center of the large ring the crowd formed. “Did he get you?”
“Yes. There’s residual magic all over it. See for yourself.”
Ron and Hermione weren’t going to argue forever. He pushed Draco to the back wall, wanting to feel every inch of him. His hands moved further down his body, hesitated, then firmly gripped his arse with both hands. Draco moaned a little louder and thrust his hips forward. “Look, Sweetheart. We look good.”
“I need to tell Ginny I have someone. Not you, but someone. Someone I love more than anyone else in the world.”
“What’s the problem?” He asked, rounding the bed and sitting on the edge near Sirius. Sirius sighed again, noticing that Harry was covered, taking a seat in the desk chair.
At Sirius’s smile, Harry launched himself at Sirius who hugged him for a long time. Remus reached over and rubbed his back. The resulting silence was nice, but Harry still had questions.
“Come on, Harry, you’re my girlfriend, and girlfriends talk about this stuff.”
“As wonderful an idea as that is, we’re disarming right now, we’ll have dance lessons later.”
Harry used the opportunity to sigh happily, he had missed this. “I missed you, Baby. I want you, too. What do you want to do?”
Draco would occasionally glare at him or those around him, and Harry wasn’t entirely sure why, except that perhaps it was to mask wanting to look at him, like he did to Draco. It was occasionally Ginny that was with him when he did, but sometimes it was one of the older boys. They seemed to like touching him on the arm or shoulder, pushing him as Harry told a joke. Harry figured the over affection was a quality to being gay.
It was moments later he got a response.
Draco shook his head. “You know me, I love surprises, and I love what you always come up with. Do you mind planning something for us?”
He moved out from under Draco’s arm to run forward a couple paces, getting to the door to the fancy French restaurant first and holding it open for Draco, bowing him in. Draco inclined his head in thanks as he passed Harry and made it for the hostess stand first.
Pettigrew looked around one more time before taking a deep breath. “Not guilty.”
Draco sighed at Harry's petulance, but stepped closer to him and ran his hand lightly up and down the small of Harry's back, mindful of the eyes on them. Harry relaxed instantly.
He found out during the announcements. Hogwarts was to participate in a Tri-wizard tournament. Harry glanced at Draco during the explanation of what exactly that was, and Draco inclined his head while raising his eyebrows, looking suitably impressed.
“We’ll see. I’m pretty sure this little cottage will be too small by the end of the summer.” Harry shook his head, but Sirius went on, “Oh yeah? Want to bet?” Harry hesitated, and Sirius laughed. “It’s alright. You’re a kid. Growing up is what you’re supposed to do.”
“The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no sign of violence there. Well, good afternoon to you all,” she simpered, and departed.
“Harry, stop being such a child. It’s only right for us to share information.”
There were a couple beats, then Sirius laughed. “I’m kidding! Why do you think I’ve been teaching you how to ride for the last year? I know you’re fine. Here.” He presented Harry with a plastic card that was obviously his driver’s license.
“Where are you going?” She said, reaching over the table to grab his wrist.
“Don’t worry, we’ll stay with you.” Ron said, scooting closer to her on the couch.
“Harry…”
“Do you want to take a walk?” Harry asked. Maybe some exercise would help stabilize his mood.
“Kreature!” Sirius exclaimed. “What are you doing? Skulking around, spying, are you?”
“Well, let’s watch something else then.” Harry said, unphased as he stood to review what they had. “What about this one, you liked it, right?”
Draco sighed. “I’m staying at Hogwarts over the break.”
Sirius sighed as Harry groaned. “It’s ok, I’m up. What’s going on?” He turned on his side to see Sirius better, trying to clear the fog from his head.
As he landed, Harry looked around in confusion. He was sure he had been there before…could remember swinging from a tire hung on a tree in the orchard, chasing chickens, throwing gnomes over the garden fence. He just couldn’t remember where he was.
“What shall we toast to?” Draco asked as they settled back against the pillows. Harry hummed in thought.
Draco scrambled to get under him, stroking his cock in what Harry thought might be a nervous fashion. Suddenly, the ball of anxiety exploded inside him, and he started shaking. He couldn’t do this, Draco was about to put himself
Harry covered his mouth with his hand to prevent his laughter from escaping too loudly. After several years, he finally understood Draco’s humor. He constantly made nicknames, made derogatory remarks, generally poking fun at anyone and everyone. But it all was done in good fun, if it had been a friend saying what Draco said, it would be counted as general teasing. Draco was simply snarky and sarcastic, and Harry found it charming rather than hostile as he had his first year.
“Yeah.” Harry said quietly.
More than an hour went by as Harry tried to entertain himself. He was distracted by wondering what Draco did in the bathroom, then for so long in the bedroom. Draco had become less vain in recent years. He had told Harry several years ago that it took him several hours to get ready every day, but he hadn’t seen any evidence of that since they had started living together.
“Yes,” Harry said in relief. “Are you?”
Draco raised his eyebrow. “That was weird.”
“Father, didn’t you invest heavily in the Visiomagic company?” Came Draco’s drawling voice from further down the row.
“You haven’t seemed interested in treasurer duties, though, so I took over. Don’t worry about it.” Ron’s glare intensified.
“Yeah.” They stayed silent for a while then Draco suddenly burst out, “I just don’t get it. Its not fair how they treat me. Weasley’s a pureblood too, but he doesn’t have to go through any of the stuff I have to go through. We’re not so different, why does he always have it so good?”
Mary MacDonald was a student in the '70's, so I didn't think it was too far of a stretch to say she went to school with Harry's parents. I just wanted someone different for her role, and I've never come across her in a fic before.
“What?” Draco questioned angrily. “You’re making him choose?” His eyes found Harry’s, then went back to Ron. He pushed Harry aside lightly so he could speak to Ron directly.
“Well, it didn’t feel different to me.”
Draco shrugged, “nothing.”
“My father put me under the cruciatus curse.” Harry gasped, trying to look down at him. “This summer. He was disappointed in me one time too many. He said I needed to learn all I could, and quickly. He finally told me he was a Death Eater, and that the Dark Lord was back. He said that I would need to get used to it. He said it was for my own good.” A couple more sobs escaped him, and Harry resumed his rocking. He had stopped during Draco’s story.
His mouth made a slurping sound as he took it out of his mouth, still stroking it with his hand. He instead went to Draco’s balls, licking long stripes for several long minutes. Draco begged another “please” before he took each one, then both, in his mouth, swirling his tongue over both. He pulled them out and gave Draco a look asking if he was ready for this. Draco raised his eyebrows, wondering what was coming, and Harry lifted his balls, and revealed the hole he was after.
It was a couple minutes past when tea was served that Kreacher finally popped back into the kitchen. “Is he alright?” Harry asked, stopping.
“Oh, don’t cry,” she whispered softly, and started patting her pockets. “I’m sorry, I don’t have—”
It never happened. At least not the anger. Instead, he exploded in laughter. Harry looked up with trepidation. Draco was leaning over, holding his stomach he was laughing so hard.
“Really?” Harry asked, starting to feel better. They both nodded, and Harry leaned forward to hug him. They both patted him on the back.
“Malfoy was the Dark Lord’s right-hand man. But he doesn’t deserve it. Especially when he has a son that’s consorting with the enemy.”
The next minutes were long and confusing. McGonagall was suddenly there, escorting him and Ron to Dumbledore. Dumbledore did things with gadgets around his office and sent portraits to check on Mr. Weasley. Then, just as a portkey was about to set off with Ginny, George, and Fred with them, Harry felt a stream of rage travel up his spine. He wanted to attack Dumbledore, just as he had attacked Mr. Weasley.
“Did you finish the transfiguration homework, Hermione?” She had been working on it in the Common Room prior to breakfast.
“It’s not the same thing! We’re also angry that it’s Malfoy! If your friend had turned out to be Cedric Diggory, or Terry Boot, or Charlie, we wouldn’t care!” Hermione said rather hysterically.
“You should apologize! Just let them eat, you’re ruining our dinner too,” a lady in a deep blue dress and up-do said to the manager. She glared at the two offenders, and the man she was with nodded, sending sympathetic looks to Harry and Draco.
Harry choked. If he had been drinking something, he would have spit it out. He laughed uproariously, “Hagrid!” As if he would want other people looking at Draco. “Don’t you think that’s a bit extreme?”
Harry had bruises on his arms from his latest bouts with Dudley and the Dursleys, and if his shirt rode up, they would see even more. As he stammered, Draco rolled his eyes. “Just go to the dressing room, go on.”
Draco shrugged. "Sirius popped his head in, said he was going down the street to some diner for breakfast? Apparently, he’s not very talented in the kitchen. Said he wanted your first day back to be as stress free as possible. Should be back any minute.”
Ron shook his head. “You’ve never been gay though! You like
“Dumbledore!” Voldemort screeched, and there was mass chaos. Spells were flying everywhere, figures in scarlet robes were fighting the ones in black, one figure in bright blue robes was fighting Voldemort. It was Dumbledore! He was saved!
“Hmm. It’s been a while. No one has even tried to spill the Bertie bot’s every flavor beans. Maybe it’s not such a bad thing if they were to find out. I’m getting really, really tired of not being able to kiss you whenever I damn well want.”
“We’re almost done with these I think,” Draco said, gesturing to the row they had in the rather sparse telly stand. “You’ll have to buy me some new ones.”
“She was worried about you. And wanted to know you were safe.”
“Ginny and I broke up after sixth year. You know that. We haven’t really had a chance to talk about things. But that’s between me and Ginny.” Ron scoffed. “What bothers you more, mate, that it’s Malfoy or...or that it’s a bloke?”
“So where does that leave us?” Harry moved in to be closer to Draco. He rested his head against his shoulder.
“So, like Ron?” They both burst out laughing.
“Off.” Draco pushed Harry’s shirt up and he lifted his back off the mattress to aid in its removal. It wasn’t until Draco was staring down at Harry that it occurred to him. He hadn’t seen the new scar. Draco hesitantly reached out and traced a finger over the still pink flesh. “Does it hurt?”
“I’m rather attracted to women too.”
“Yeah, George, didn’t you know? Malfoy’s nickname is the Giant Squid.” Charlie winked at Harry and George choked on his potatoes.
“All right, Ronald?”
“You know...” Draco broke the silence and Harry opened his eyes. “I rather liked being the center of your attention last year.”
“Merlin, I hate to say it, but Molly is right.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “You are too skinny.” He rolled his eyes.
“Well he’s not! You’re not ready, Harry, dear.” Molly reached across the table and took his hand. “You need time to recover from the war. We all do. To suggest that you should throw yourself back into danger like this is unconscionable.”
“Are you telling me that Dumbledore was more concerned about Harry getting himself killed than my pathetic attempts to murder him?”
And then he felt Draco grip his hips with his knees and he was so close Harry thought he had burst into flame. They were touching from their lips to their hips and it was the most erotic and intimate thing that Harry had experienced in seventeen years. They both kissed with abandon and with no concept of propriety. Nothing at all like he had kissed Cho. Or Ginny. With them he had been hesitant and shy and unsure. And he had been so aware of the memory of Cedric and the eyes of Ginny’s brothers.
The rest of dinner went without further incident. Harry shoved the letter in his pocket and did his best to forget about it for the moment. He managed to eat some roast beef and potatoes and finished off with some treacle tart. He suspected that Kreacher had something to do with that last part. Molly, Arthur, and Percy had huddled together and were talking in hushed voices. Draco had surreptitiously taken his hand under the table at some point and would squeeze it occasionally.
“Oi, I would watch it if I were you. I was just very kind to you.”
It was the first time anyone had uttered the word “abuse” in regards to the Dursleys. Harry had always known. He had never thought it or acknowledged it but he had known. But just as he had feared, hearing it made it so much more real. And nobody had bothered to tell him that there was nothing wrong with him. Draco’s words at once tore him to pieces while bringing him back together.
“Of course, you can! I just said it! We’re identical, you dense prat!” George was laughing and soon Harry was too. Their laughter faded and George sighed. “After Sirius, when did it stop hurting?” Harry grimaced.
“When you were wanking me off, I was thinking of doing this. Marking up your neck and knowing I was the one who did it.” Draco moaned.
“Blimey, Harry, you get attacked by the Giant Squid or something?” George gave him a knowing grin and he felt his face heat up. Luckily for all involved, Ginny was sitting over at the Ravenclaw table with Neville and Luna.
“A Death Eater who is just trying to shag his way out of prison with me! Yes, you’ve said. I hear you, Ron. Thanks ever so much for your concern. It’s nice to know that my best mate thinks I’m only good for one thing!”
“For what?”
“He’ll get over it. See you around, Harry.”
“Oh.” They lapsed into silence again.
“Hermione and I were just discussing our concerns.”
“Draco!” The sound was an embarrassing combination of arousal and surprise. Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s and stroked him once. “Fuck...”
“I do.”
“Your mother? Narcissa Malfoy? Why would she start bothering me about food?”
“Are you here to shag me to keep yourself out of Azkaban?”
“Touching like this.”
“Okay. I’m sorry. I’m being stupid. Go eat with your mum. Tell her I said hi.” Harry gave him a smile and turned to the Weasleys. Hermione was the only one who seemed to see the exchange.
“Okay. It’s getting a little easier. There are even days where I can go a couple hours without thinking about him. And then, of course, that just makes me feel like shite, so.”
“That a promise?” Harry panted and bucked his hips up into Draco’s tight grip.
“Just needed an adult to talk to.” Harry shrugged. “He told me that Sirius was gay. And in a relationship with Remus. And Dumbledore was gay.”
“God, you’re so gorgeous.” Harry tried to commit the image to memory. He wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock and marveled at the sound he made. Draco jerked his hips in an aborted movement, a moan torn from his throat. Harry did his best to recreate what Draco had done to him. And of course he had taken himself in hand before. So at least he had some idea of what he was doing. It was different from this angle but still.
“You could always come work for me!” George gave him a grin and Harry smiled.
“Mostly because now your dating pool has doubled.” Ginny rolled her eyes.
“My mother lied to the Dark Lord? About you being dead? For me?”
“But we are needy, aren’t we?” Draco raised an eyebrow. He still had a smug smirk on his face and Harry would exact his revenge. As soon as Draco made him come.
“Of course, dear!” Molly gave him a bright smile. “You’re always welcome to join us.” Ron shot his mother a disbelieving look.
“So you think he’s using me?” Harry stepped back and took a deep breath. “You think that Draco is just pretending to give a shite about me so that I’ll try to keep him out of prison? Have I got that right?”
“I’m saying that I don’t feel the need to burden all of you!” Harry jumped up and walked over to the edge of the lake. A gentle summer breeze blew across the grounds and rustled the leaves in the tree. It was the only sound between them for a few moments.
“No. What on earth for?”
“I know that. I get it. Really. It’s fine.” Harry tried to move away from Draco. If he was going to lose him soon, it would be better to get used to the idea now.
“And your father?”
“Thanks.” His voice cracked and he was determined not to cry. He was done crying about the bloody Dursleys. Draco pulled back to look at him.
“Come on, Harry. You can’t stay in bed all day.” Draco sounded amused and Harry took his pillow and aimed in the direction he thought the posh git was. “You really do have terrible aim, darling.”
“You mean that, don’t you?”
“Ron just needs some time.” A second voice, off to his side somewhere. “Honestly, I think he’s just upset that Harry and Ginny didn’t get back together. He hates the idea of anyone dating her but I guess he figured he could trust Harry.”
“Did I?” Draco’s smirk grew. “That doesn’t sound like me.” He leaned down to bite Harry’s earlobe and Harry groaned. “No, that sounds a bit more like you, dear. Virtuous Gryffindor...” His mouth trailed across Harry’s jaw to his other earlobe. “And me being a cunning and rather less virtuous Slytherin would never suggest such a heinous crime as to get out of this bed.” Harry gasped and bucked his hips up.
“You all right, Harry?” Charlie sat next to him.
“Ready.” He held out his hand and Draco hesitated for a moment before he accepted it. Together they walked out the door and started down the stairs to the Great Hall. Repairs to the castle were going well. McGonagall thought that the castle would be back to normal in another week or two. Harry didn’t really want to leave Hogwarts any time soon. Mostly because this was where Draco was. And the two of them managed to sleep if they were next to each other.
“I thought that my parents were right. They are my parents so surely, they know best. But...after Year 5...I realized it wasn’t as glamourous as I had imagined. It was...dark. And heavy. And I hated every minute of it.”
“It’s fine. I was just wondering if I should consider myself special.”
“You’re right. It’s just better when you say please.” Harry tugged Draco’s bottoms down to his knees and paused to admire the image. Draco Malfoy, shirt pushed up under his armpits, pyjama bottoms around his knees, his pale chest and pink nipples on display, and his cock hard and leaking precome. Harry had been wrong before. This was the hottest thing that he had ever seen. And the first time he had properly seen another cock. Sure, he would catch glimpses in the Quidditch locker rooms or in the dorm showers but never like this.
“Yeah. ‘Spose we’ll both be busy.”
“Is today just the day that all the Weasleys have difficult and awkward conversations with me?”
And the more he sobbed, the more he couldn’t breathe. This was why he had ducked out of the Great Hall. This was why he had wanted to be alone. Harry had spent so long being the brave, stalwart Chosen One. It had only been a matter of time before he cracked. And he could feel it. He had cracked and now the pieces fell around him. Like the castle itself had only hours before.
“I’m not sure I would have been able to handle being his friend before now. The stress would have been unbelievable. Constantly worrying about him dying.”
Perhaps Dumbledore had grown to truly care about Harry as a person and not just a pawn in his chess match with Voldemort. But he certainly hadn’t started out caring about who Harry was or what he wanted or how he felt. Dumbledore had outright disregarded Harry for an entire year with no explanation. And hadn’t trusted Harry with vital information about himself. Never even mentioned the prophecy that he had heard directly from Trelawney’s mouth.
“I believe everyone with the Mark has a one-way ticket to Azkaban.”
“What did you mean, your cupboard?” Draco wasn’t looking at him, instead focusing on the Black Lake. Harry heaved a sigh.
“Thanks, George.”
“I’ll let you know.” George sighed but nodded, like he knew that would be the answer. “It does get easier. You can start to remember them without immediately being sad. The sadness is still there but it’s...less sharp. I still miss him every day but I can think about him and laugh instead of crying, you know?”
“That’s rich coming from you, Draco.” He pulled on his jeans and a fresh shirt. Kreacher had likely brought some clothes for them.
“You still want to work for the Ministry? After everything?”
“I wanted to say sorry about earlier.” Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “I was being a prat, I have been reliably informed.”
“Harry...”
“And succeeded.”
“I don’t know if I can do anything for him. He was already put in Azkaban once and broke out. Or was broken out. I could try to help.”
“There’s a reason I was never a Chaser.” Harry grumbled into the mattress and immediately wished he still had his pillow.
“You should. Paris, Venice, Athens, Tokyo. A lot more to the world than London and Hogwarts.” Harry tried to stifle another yawn. “We really should get you to bed.”
“Ah, yes. My master plan. Weasley saw right through me all along.” Draco spoke flatly and rolled his eyes. “I sincerely hope you didn’t believe a single word of that.”
“Mum loves you like the son she definitely didn’t want.”
“You should see the other guy.” Harry replied and took some sausage and toast. George laughed, Hermione smiled and shook her head, and Ron made a sort of choked noise in the back of his throat. Charlie smacked him on the back.
“Be fair, Draco. Which was more likely to happen?”
“You’re very welcome, Harry.” She and Draco exchanged a significant look. “See you!” Hermione started her walk back to the castle.
“I appreciate the offer, Draco. But I think just your support will be enough.” Hermione gave him a bright smile. “I should head back up to the castle. It wouldn’t do for Molly to have to mourn Ron as well. I’m sure Ginny and Charlie have shouted some sense into him by now. I’ll see you two at dinner?” She stood and brushed debris off of her jeans.
“And don’t worry about Ron. He’s just being a prat.” She grinned. “Just wait until he finds out that I’m bi too. He’s gonna lose it.”
“Okay.” Draco turned to head towards the old Slytherin table. “Draco?”
“Am I the last person to figure out that I’m attracted to Draco?”
“What is he declining?” Percy asked and held a hand out for the letter. Hermione gave Harry a questioning look. He just shrugged and she handed the letter to Percy. George leaned over to read it as well. He whistled quietly.
“I dunno. It’s possible.” Ron shoved his hands in his pockets and scuffed the floor.
“I always knew you would be the death of me, Draco Malfoy.” Harry closed his eyes and tilted his head back, allowing Draco better access to his neck. Draco smirked against his skin as his hands slipped under his shirt. The two of them had seemed to come to some sort of nonverbal understanding that touching and kissing was fine but they weren’t going to have sex. Well...sex in the conventional sense of the word. Harry thought that they were a bit young still. Even though Draco was coming up on his eighteenth birthday and Harry not far behind. Their age didn’t seem to be what Draco was hung up on. But as they hadn’t actually talked about it, Harry didn’t know what was.
“Fine. But only because I don’t want Narcissa Malfoy bursting in here and accusing me of stealing her only son’s virtue or something. Which I haven’t even done.”
“Well, what better way to change the system than from the inside?” Hermione grinned. “Are you still going to be an Auror?”
“Guess that means you’re gonna follow Malfoy wherever he goes off to. Unless of course he gets shipped off to Azkaban.” The group went quiet. Even Percy and Charlie stopped talking to turn and look at their brother and Harry.
Alone, on the cold stone floor of the dungeon classroom, shrouded in the darkness, the events of the day finally crashed into him. Lavender, Colin, Snape, Fred, Tonks, Lupin. Who even knew how many others. Harry buried his head in his hands and pulled at his hair as a sob escaped him. He had failed them. Failed everyone. He should have been smarter and faster and better. He should have done more. Eventually, they had prevailed. But at what cost?
“That is your name, isn’t it?” Malfoy smirked but he didn’t draw back.
“And you’re okay with me being ‘gay or whatever’ as long as it isn’t with Draco Malfoy?” Harry could feel his voice rising but he couldn’t quite figure out how to stop it. “Would you feel better if I were shagging your sister? Or maybe Charlie? He’s pretty fit after all. And definitely wouldn’t use me for my fucking saviour status, right?”
This entire day, from beginning to end, had been the longest, single most excruciating day of his life. If someone had told him this morning that his day would end in Snape’s old classroom, talking with Malfoy like this was something that they did, he would have laughed in their face. Their Gringotts break-in and subsequent escape felt like a lifetime ago. Had it really been just this morning? Harry had woken up anxious because of their mad idea to rob Gringotts. He should have been a bit more concerned. After all, he had died today.
“But see other people.” It wasn’t a question. He could hear it in what Draco wasn’t saying.
“I had only just been told that the darkest wizard in a century, the one that killed my parents, had been in Slytherin. And that every dark wizard had come out of Slytherin.” Harry sighed. “But they were wrong about that. Peter Pettigrew had been in Gryffindor.”
“The Dark Lord used a horcrux then? I suppose that makes sense.”
“Oh bollocks...” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Nobody’s looking for me, are they?” Malfoy turned back to look at him.
“Yeah.” Ron looked around the table before finally looking at Harry. And then Draco. “Can we talk in private?”
“Sit like what?”
“It really doesn’t bother me that you’re...gay or whatever.”
“Shouldn’t you be with all your adoring fans?” He shot back.
“Well, for one thing, it gets him you.”
“Promise?”
“Thank you, Draco. I appreciate the enthusiasm.”
“Sure.” Harry shrugged. This time he squeezed Draco’s hand before he let it go. He and Ron walked out of the Great Hall and Ron stopped at the stairs. He sat down on the third step up. Harry stayed standing. He crossed his arms. “What?”
“Do them.” Harry moaned. It turned out that Voldemort did have a secret weapon he could have used against Harry. Why bother with torture and threats when Tom Riddle could have brought Harry to his knees with a single kiss from Draco Malfoy. Probably for the best the thought had never occurred to him.
“It’s just a thought.” Ron tried to look like he wasn’t being a complete and utter arse.
“What now?” Harry let his head rest on Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve spent the better part of my life trying to defeat Voldemort. What am I supposed to do now?”
“You’ll have to get a life, I’m sorry to say. And stop obsessing over me.”
“And possibly Mother.”
“Well...I am the Chosen One.” Harry grinned and Malfoy rolled his eyes. “And I owe you one. And your mum one.”
“Why in Merlin’s name would you be in Azkaban?” Harry almost laughed at the idea. Draco Malfoy and Azkaban did not go together. Malfoy raised an eyebrow and pulled back the sleeve on his left arm. The Dark Mark was visible even in the low light.
“Oh please, Ron. We all know that you’re going to be coming back for your seventh year.”
“I am thin because that is how I’m supposed to look. I’ve always been slender.” Draco rolled off the bed and undressed as well. “You, on the other hand, look unhealthy.”
“I’m pretty open-minded.” Harry smirked and briefly wondered if they were still joking. He wasn’t sure.
“Gee, thanks, Ron.”
“I expect some letters from my new found friend during my stay in Azkaban.” Malfoy pulled his hand away.
“Well my father is going to Azkaban and nowhere else. My mother and I may be joining him. I am going to cross that bridge when I get to it.”
“Just can’t figure out what the hell you’re doing going around with Malfoy. What happened to Ginny?”
“Darling, I can count your ribs. That doesn’t exactly scream picture of health.”
“I thought you wanted me to get out of bed.”
“It’s from Kinglsey.” Harry passed the parchment to him without another word and stared down at his food. Draco made a strange sound in the back of his throat before the letter passed under Harry to Hermione. After a moment, she scoffed and tossed the letter on the table.
“And I’m the needy one?” Harry quirked an eyebrow. “I think you’re missing a word, gorgeous.”
“You can’t lie around in bed all day.” Draco pushed his hair back, the smirk fading into a fond smile. “Much as I would like to keep you here.”
“If we want.” Draco brought him closer. “I think expecting two eighteen-year-old boys fresh out of a war to maintain a long-distance relationship is asking a bit much.”
“Yeah? Did it stroke your ego enough?”
“Yeah, we’ll see you later.” Harry smiled at her. “Thank you, Hermione.”
“You should see yourself.” Draco sighed.
“Kind of like what you are doing right now?” Harry turned around to look at Draco. He had one eyebrow raised and he looked exhausted. “You are rather a lot of work.” Harry rolled his eyes and turned his gaze back to the lake. Warm arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him in. “Luckily for you, I’m not scared off so easily.”
“...If we manage to avoid going to prison, my mother and I intend to go to France.”
“Sure, Malfoy. I owe you one.” Harry looked across the room at Malfoy. He was still perched on top of the desk. He had pulled one foot up on the desk and was resting his chin on top of his knee. If anyone else had done it, it might have looked ridiculous. As it was, Malfoy almost looked regal. The insufferable git.
“Not so sure about that. You look like you’ve been well shagged.”
“Well, you’re my first friend in Slytherin. So I would say that you’re special.”
“I think perhaps you ought to lie down. In the hospital wing. Come on. I’ll take you.”
“No.” Harry grit his teeth. “It’s different.”
“So is the war. And yet you still have nightmares about it.” He finally looked down at Harry. “Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it isn’t still affecting you. You don’t need to deal with everything yourself.”
“I think you might be.” Ginny grinned. They fell into a companionable silence. “It’s just not the same between us anymore, is it?”
“We’re friendly. I got the sense this morning that Draco was a permanent fixture in your life now so I thought it best to make amends.”
“About you.” Harry bristled and started to sit up again. Draco gently pushed him back down. “Oh, stop. People who care about you are allowed to be concerned. In fact, it’s our jobs to be concerned for you.”
“Not to mention the way parents would react to a gay man teaching their children. Even with Muggles, that could get a teacher sacked.” Hermione got that determined look on her face. “That is at the top of my list of things to tackle in the Ministry.”
“What?!” They all winced slightly at the shout. “What is he thinking? He wants to start training Harry in a dangerous occupation without him being properly prepared?”
“You have enough to be getting on with, Draco. And so does Hermione. And Ron.”
“Oh, darling, all you had to do was ask.” Draco started stroking his cock and Harry moaned. They had definitely not done this yet. And Harry was more than happy to add it to their list of things that were okay. Somehow Draco’s hand felt infinitely better than his own. Draco’s hand was smooth and cool and slender. Harry tilted his head to watch Draco’s hand on his cock and he almost came right then. It wasn’t fair how hot it was. Draco’s pale hand moving against Harry’s darker skin.
“Maybe.” Harry sighed and then he spotted Ginny walking out of the castle. “I should have just stayed in bed.” Charlie glanced up at his sister and laughed.
“Come on.” Draco stood up and pulled Harry with him. Hermione tugged on his other hand.
“You? In Slytherin?” Malfoy laughed once but there was no real heat behind it.
“Of course, we will, Harry!” Hermione rested a hand on his shoulder. “True, maybe we’ll never be the same, but we’ll be okay.” She squeezed his shoulder. “Together. We’ll be okay again.” She gave him a small smile and he nodded. “Do you think you’ll come back for your seventh year?”
“Aren’t you? You’re going all the way to France.” Harry felt Draco tense behind him. “I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair.”
“And you, Hermione? I imagine you will return to school.”
“Are we okay?”
“It’s rather hard to forget, Draco.”
“Is this going to be a thing now?” Harry didn’t resist when Draco laced their fingers together and started walking to the castle. “Am I going to have Molly, Hermione, and you bugging me about eating?”
“Yeah, I guess that’s true.” Harry sighed. “Even you, Draco, darling?” He tried his best Pansy Parkinson impression. Draco stared down at him and Harry tried to keep a straight face but it was a lost cause. They both started laughing. And didn’t stop for several minutes. When they finally managed to get a grip, they had sprawled out together on the floor of the classroom.
“Most of the time. What do you think you’re going to do after the trials, Draco?”
“Hilarious is not the word I would use. Why on earth would they want you to die? You’re the golden boy.”
“France. For how long?”
“You know that us being friends is going to be nigh on impossible in the real world, right?”
“But really, Harry, you’re family. You can’t ever get rid of us. No matter what you do or what we do. We’re always here for you. That’s what family is supposed to do.”
“That’s fair enough. I would be surprised if you ever remembered my given name.”
“Don’t you get it?” Harry could feel tears run down his cheeks again. He teetered on the edge of hysterical laughter and sobbing. “I was the last horcrux! The one he never intended to make.” He couldn’t resist quoting Dumbledore. “And they knew! Dumbledore knew for...years. And Snape! He died so that I would know I had to die!”
“Come here, darling.” Draco pulled him tight to him and Harry let out a broken sob. “It wasn’t your fault. And you did nothing wrong. They are the wrong ones. Not you.”
“Merlin, Potter...” Draco pressed their foreheads together. “Where did this come from?”
“No. I’m sorry, no.”
“I guess all sorts of things are possible in the afterlife.” Harry shrugged and looked over at his odd companion. “Draco?”
“You know that’s not what I meant!”
“’Course. I’m always all right.” Harry sighed.
“Funny. I was gonna ask you the same thing.” They were both a bit breathless. Something about that, about being responsible for rendering Draco Malfoy breathless, made their position suddenly very uncomfortable. Or rather too uncomfortable. That depended on how one looked at the situation. “Why’d you stop?”
“In the dungeons?” Malfoy raised his eyebrow higher. Harry struggled to his feet and turned to face him.
“Draco...please...” Harry groaned, tossing his head back.
“Did you see that, Harry? He was going to attack us!” Ron snarled. Draco’s arm twitched, but he didn’t raise it again.
Draco was indeed in there, pacing, and Harry felt a rush of affection and warmth for him at the sight. The second Draco saw him, he was racing towards Harry, and threw his arms around him the moment they were close enough. Harry sighed, and let the tension that had been tormenting his muscles leave him. Draco was like taking a warm bath sometimes. He relaxed and calmed Harry, washed the stressed of the day off, and made him feel clean. Well, there was a reason it was only sometimes; he made Harry feel plenty dirty on occasion.
“Oh, come on now, Baby,” Harry murmured as he cradled Draco’s face close. He nuzzled their noses together and Draco’s eyes narrowed further.
Updated 8/1/20
was up with them.
“Well,” Sirius said, slapping his thigh and standing. “I’m going to go talk to Remus and some other members of the Order, give them an update. I’ll see you two later, and Harry, I’ll be by Grimmauld to reset the wards soon.”
“Oh, no! How badly is he hurt?” Harry felt shame and dread pool in his stomach.
A wave of shame came over him. He was ruining this, and he didn’t want that. “Yes.” He said, “Suck my cock, Draco.” Draco’s eyes widened before he did just that, moaning around Harry’s cock. Harry moaned in return, and once he had started, he couldn’t stop talking. “You’re so good at this, baby,” he told him. “I love how you suck on my cock,” came out of his mouth at some point. He was a bit lost, a stream of consciousness being ejected from his mouth. Draco was showing signs of loving it. He was moaning nonstop, and the vibrations were divine.
Draco had decided to leave it alone when he was confronted by the very torment he had been avoiding.
When it was time for the defense to question him, Mr. Morgan said he had no questions at this time. Harry thought that was rather strange. Mary called Ron, Hermione, Lupin, Kingsley and several members of the Order of the Phoenix, not that the Wizagomont knew that, who all testified that Pettigrew was guilty. Harry felt optimistic of how things were going, even if it did get a bit boring.
They were quiet for a long time. “I see.” Father finally said. “Am I going to be pleased with you, finally?” Was Draco shaking? He was so scared. He was still observing his shoes. “You will look at me when I am speaking to you!”
“I’ll kill you for saying that! We both know my boyfriend is way hotter, braver, and more of a gentleman.”
“Harry Potter.” The girls laughed full on this time.
“I would never let you do this alone. You will never be alone again.”
“Harry,” Draco said heatedly, then he closed his eyes and was silent, head tilted down. Harry went back to their shared core, trying to decipher how Draco was feeling. There was mostly more pain, then anger, sadness, desire, and a forced calm as Draco fought for control. Harry felt as Draco regained it, and he spun Harry slowly so he could look into his eyes directly instead of through the mirror. “Harry, Sweetheart. You are not fat. This,” he put his hands over Harry’s stomach, “is how you are supposed to look. Can you feel how it’s not moving much? That means its muscle, not fat. You work out, it’s normal to look how you do.”
He was brought back to the present rather violently. “What are you doing out of bed?” It was Madam Pomfrey, dressed in a nightgown and robe, holding her lit wand aloft. “Mr. Malfoy, explain yourself!”
Came the reply.
McGonagall raised her eyebrow before Harry gathered what he wanted to say. “Professor, I know that necklace came from Borgin and Burkes, in Knockturn Alley. I saw it there four years ago, and this summer, I saw Draco—Malfoy,” he added, hoping it would sound like he meant to say Draco’s full name all along. “Purchase something from there.” He paused, trying to think of how to phrase this next part.
“As for you, Mr. Weasley, you are also banned from playing quidditch and you shall have two weeks of detention. I think it would be safe if his twin is also banned.”
They continued walking in silence, holding hands, until Harry realized something. “I’m sorry about today, Baby.” He said, looking at the ground.
It took until Easter Holidays to talk to Sirius over the mirror about his father, and Remus was there too. He felt a little better, but it still weighed heavily on his heart. He wished more than anything he could talk to them himself, but that was a dream he would have to let go of.
“You really are amazing, Harry.” Draco said quietly. Harry tightened his hold.
Harry nodded thoughtfully, looking across at Draco. He hadn’t talked to him about his decision yet, and he probably should have. His look turned apologetic, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco sighed. “I still haven’t completely forgiven you, you know. But I missed you, and I figured that what you did was a faux pau, you couldn’t have known how completely offensive…what you did was. So, apologize, and I’ll try to move on.”
Cedric was the next champion to emerge from the waters with his hostage, Cho Chang. They were awarded the same treatment as Harry and Draco, given blankets and tea, and a seat next to Harry and Draco.
By the way...I fucking love all you readers who commented along the lines of "yeah stealing's wrong, but it's Umbridge." I don't think there was a single Gryffindor in the bunch saying what Draco did was undeniably wrong, and as a devout Slytherin, I love it on a personal level. I'm going to try to show how Harry's and Draco's morals battle and fit and juxtapose. In this chapter, Harry goes along with Umbridge being imperiused, which, to me, is a big step up from stealing her gold. I'm not happy with the drastic change and showing how Harry is feeling, but I decided to just go ahead and post what I had and figured I'd add that in at some point. Another point, yes, canon!Harry used the curse himself, but that was towards the end of the war, not the beginning where it's around two months after canon!Harry said (I don't remember what he actually said but it was something like) he wasn't going to use any debilitating spells on Death Eaters. The journey from one extreme to the other has always felt forced to me and that's another reason why I don't like that I'm basically doing the same thing.
He knew Harry knew about it, Hermione was not subtle. Even as he watched, Harry looked up from his own breakfast, caught Hermione, and rolled his eyes. Hermione, who had instantly stuck the book further up her face, missed him being apparent that she was caught. It was funny, almost, how arrogant she was. Actually, it was bloody annoying. There were so many things about her he found annoying, he sometimes wondered why and how he was still friends with her.
He couldn’t remember being more disappointed. It was difficult to sleep, so he sat bolt upright when he heard the hospital wing’s doors open. He was starting to panic when a headless pair of lips brushed his forehead.
Draco fixed the mugs and summoned them with a wave of his wand. He slid them over to Harry and said, “again.” A small smile broke Harry’s face, and he threw them both, one after the other.
“Well, I’ll get to that in a minute, I want to tell you about my news first.” Sirius said, and he was blushing just a little bit. “It’s a bit of a long story…Draco, has Harry told you about Remus and me?”
“You need to get dressed if we have any hope of showing our faces at breakfast.” Harry pulled back and went to try and tidy his unruly hair. As usual it was a lost cause but it gave him an excuse to put distance between him and Draco. He hated talking about the Dursleys. Hermione had tried time and again to get him to talk to them about his home life. But being away from them, all Harry wanted to do was pretend that his family didn’t exist. Harry knew perfectly well what Hermione, Ron, Draco, Molly, any of them would say. But hearing it would make it true. Hearing it would make it real. One trauma at a time.
“Must’ve.” Harry started to sit up but Draco’s fingers in his hair made him rethink that.
“Ready?” Harry turned to give Draco a smile.
“Very true. I am still surprised that it wanted to put you in Slytherin. Did it say why?”
“I guess that’s true.”
“Harry...” He felt a hand on his shoulder and it took a moment for him to realize it was Malfoy. “Come on. I’m taking you to the hospital wing. Find Granger and Weasley.”
“Well, then, please enlighten me because I don’t know what you mean.” Draco stood behind him now. “Is...Ron being a burden to you when he talks about the loss of his brother? Is George? Does Hermione burden you when she tells you about what my aunt did to her?”
“...You think we can still make breakfast?” Harry looked over at him. Draco huffed out a laugh. He rolled his head to look at Harry.
“I’ve got you, darling. You’re safe here with me. You are safe. And you are loved. And I will never let anyone hurt you like that again.” He tightened his grip on Harry. “You’ve been through too much.”
They stayed like that for a while. Harry didn’t know how long. It felt like hours. But it could have been a few minutes. His breathing evened out until he and Malfoy were breathing together without any effort on Harry’s part. In and out. In and out. He felt almost calm.
“Not necessarily.” Hermione sighed. “Harry and Dumbledore were both beloved figures but as soon as they said something against the Ministry...”
“God, he would, wouldn’t he?” He shook his head. “I can just hear him...”
“Well, I was trying to have two moments of peace and quiet.” Harry huffed and sat up. He wiped at his face and only really succeeded in getting more dirt on his face. Which was when his body decided to remind him that he had fallen face first into the hard ground of the forest. His face ached and then it seemed to seep down into the rest of his body. His arms, his legs, and bloody hell, his chest suddenly felt as though it were on fire. Ah, that was where the curse had hit him.
“It isn’t like we have classes or anything. There is nothing we need to do outside of this room.” Harry grinned. “Or even this bed.”
“Never been very good at those.” Harry yawned and Draco tugged on his arm to bring him closer. Harry obliged and tucked himself into his side. “I thought I would be an Auror but after everything...I dunno. I think I’ve had enough of dark wizards.”
Mandy gives herself a covert mission upon the end of her sixth year: breaking her ex-girlfriend and best friend out of "Camp."
“Any particular reason you’re upset?”
Now, however, things were looking up. He would go home, and restructure how the Malfoys were seen. By the time his father made it out of prison, he would be unable to change what Draco had done. He would speak to his mother, they would change the wards, make charitable donations, and possibly renounce his father’s ways.
Updated 7/31/20
She did know that he had made several new friends over the years, and at one point she dismissed the red-herring theory and thought maybe he was hanging out with someone they didn’t approve of, like a Slytherin. That was simply ridiculous, however, so she dismissed that as well. Harry was just as prejudiced against Slytherins as any other red-blooded Gryffindor. He fought with Malfoy enough to prove that he would never be friends with any of them.
He waited to see what Draco would say. “I was working on homework and got caught up. I didn’t see your message until five minutes ago.” Harry really wanted to believe that, but he had a hard time with it. “Did you have a hard time with the charms essay? I had to look in five different books to really get the concept…” Harry listened, but Draco went on and on about the stupid charms essay for what felt like forever. He was still curious about Draco’s behavior recently. Was he sick? Had something happened to his mother?
“Honestly, I don’t know.” Ron sighed.
“It looked rather like King’s Cross. But cleaner.” Malfoy burst into laughter.
“What has Kinglsey done this time?” Arthur asked. He didn’t gesture for the letter as the rest of his family had done.
“I think he aged us all about ten years. Why do you think Dumbledore looked so tired towards the end?” They both started laughing.
He slid slowly down the length of the classroom door. For the first time in what felt like years, Harry was finally, blissfully alone. He choked out a laugh at the thought. How many years had he spent huddled in his cupboard, desperately wishing that he wasn’t alone? And now, the silence and darkness felt like an old friend. It welcomed him with open arms and it didn’t expect anything from him.
“What? You think he dosed with a potion or something?” Harry raised an eyebrow incredulously.
“Draco Malfoy by any chance?”
“No, it wasn’t.” Draco turned Harry to face him. “You know what it’s going to be like for us here. Mother has no desire to go back to that house. And I can’t say that I do either. And, for once, this has nothing to do with you.”
“I’ll let this one slide.” Malfoy shrugged and then turned to sit beside Harry. They sat in silence for a few minutes. Harry missed the weight of Malfoy’s hands.
“See you later, Ginny.” She gave him one last smile before she turned and walked back to the castle. Harry heaved a sigh and laid back on the grass. It had been a long morning. Maybe he would just take the rest of the morning off from doing anything. On the one hand, it felt nice to hear that the Weasleys were his family and most of them accepted this new facet of him without question. And it felt good to finally be on the same page with Ginny. But Ron being...upset? Angry? Disgusted? He didn’t know what Ron was but he knew it bothered him.
