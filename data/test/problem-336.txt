Andromeda just sipped her tea. Harry stifled a sigh. She never made it easy - she’d never ask questions or push him to talk. It was nice, most of the time. But sometimes some things were hard to say.
Harry watched Pansy and Blaise exchange exasperated looks. “One day,” Harry said, “I’m going to introduce you to a Walkman. Or noise-cancelling headphones.”
“Well Potter seems to have forgiven you, why can’t they? It’s not as though they were never cruel to you, either,” Blaise said, after a moment’s silence.
Under her watchful eye, he stood up and walked slowly back to where Dean and Seamus were sitting. He moved slowly, but his shoulders were straight, and he didn’t look back.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked. He tried not to sound angry, not to sound threatening. He was so tired, so exhausted already – the world was greying around the edges of his vision.
“Today is a day to rejoice,” she began clearly. Any remaining speaking in the hall had stopped. “For those of us who have come back to the castle, who are still able to find refuge in this place.”
The problem was, he didn’t realize he was angry. Not until Madame Pomfrey gave him a startled look and he realized he had clenched his hands so hard in the sheets of the hospital bed that he had set them on fire.
“Why would she be mean?” Mar asked, looking confused. Harry did his best to keep his cool. He would tell Pansy about this as soon as he could. They would figure out what to do.
“Does it count as abuse of power if I don’t have any power to begin with?” Harry asked tiredly. Harry sat down at the table next to Draco, leaning into the other boy’s warmth. He was just too tired for this.
“That’s easier said than done,” McGonagall responded, taking a sip of tea before she continued. With the tension gone from the room, Harry let himself slump back in his seat a little bit. “There is much anti-Death Eater sentiment, and for good reason.”
I AM SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG TO POST!!! but i'm back, hopefully with a backlog of chapters and a plot this time. <3
“You sound like Pansy.” His observation earned him a very real glare from Hermione. “Honest!” He added. “She’s about as scary as you, too!”
“Harry,” the familiar voice sounded behind him before he even had the chance to see if she had made her way down from the table. He turned in his seat, accidentally knocking Draco’s hand off his knee as he turned.
“Just sad,” she said, giving him the kind of look out of the corner of her eye that made him feel as though she could see right through him.
Harry flinched every time the floo came to life and another one of his classmates stepped out. He couldn’t help it. In the Days Before, Harry had disliked travelling by floo, but hadn’t minded it either, not really. In the Days After, to put it simply, he was glad he and Draco had been the first to arrive, so no one but Professor McGonagall had to see him be sick in the potted plant in the corner of her office.
“Harry James Potter? Think before he acts? That’s preposterous,” she said. Hermione didn’t laugh, but he could hear the lightness in her tone.
“I’ll only do it if he starts actually taking care of it,” Pansy said with a sniff. “Hair like Potter’s will ruin my reputation.”
“When I approached the professors about this very situation, Professor Slughorn was adamant he would only put his support behind it if you were able to be the Student Guardian to the Slytherin House. The staff were almost all unanimously in favour of this. You and Mr Potter are to be in charge of the Slytherins. And – I was going to tell him this tomorrow at our meeting, but I shall instead explain to both of you now – if Mr Malfoy were to lend a hand in an unofficial capacity, it would not cause me concern, nor would it be reported ot the ministry.”
“Your trunks have been sent ahead to your rooms, as I am sure you are all aware,” she began. “Since you are all here, I will show you to the eighth year common rooms.” A mumble of surprise went up from the group, but she quelled it with a look. “Hogwarts will not be a pleasant place for most returning this year, you all are expected to be supporting the younger years in their transition back into the castle. We have made the decision to keep the eighth years from having ties to any particular houses.”
“It’s not dark,” Draco added. “The lake makes it seem sort of green. Sometimes you can see the Giant Squid through the windows. There’s always lots of fish that you can see, and your dorms have enchanted windows so it looks like you’re looking outside.”
“Not the really big ones,” Jason said. The other first years nodded their agreement. Honestly, Harry thought, they had a point.
They weren’t as early as they had thought. When they arrived in the Great Hall – which housed just a small table that the professors and students sat around together, most of their year was already there. Neville tried to smile at Harry as they walked in, but Harry tactfully ignored him and followed Blaise to seats at the opposite end to everyone else.
“I’m the Saviour of the Wizarding World,” Harry said, letting his amusement tinge his voice. “I can do what I want.”
The next time he woke it was darker in his room. His head hurt less – his whole body hurt less, really. He shifted into a sitting position, looking around for his glasses once again.
The warm July air blew patterns across Harry’s skin, although he shivered in spite of it. The starry sky felt as though it was flooding his vision with light, and for a moment he considered going back inside but shook the idea off quickly.
,” McGonagall said in a clear voice. Draco stiffened beside him at her words and Zabini shifted on his other side. Harry had no idea what they meant, but
She sat for a moment, rocking back and forth while she tapped her collarbone as if considering what Harry was saying. “Can I still get my hair cut?” she finally asked.
They stood together and parted ways at the door to the Great Hall, Pansy and Blaise heading outside and Draco and Harry turning left towards the Owlrey.
He did his best not to laugh, but really – it was hard. “Okay, do you have a nickname or a different name I can call you?”
“Right,” Harry managed, reaching for the piece of toast Draco offered him. He didn’t really feel like eating, but he also wanted everyone to stop looking so
“You don’t think she’s a Squib, do you?” she asked. She didn’t seem upset, Harry made sure to note, but she did seem confused. He shrugged in response, but tried to puzzle it out himself. There were other squibs on the staff, of course, like Filch, so it wouldn’t be surprising.
There were probably healthier ways to achieve the same thing. Meditation, maybe. Occlumency, probably. But he’d never been good at eihter. When he smoked, at least he didn’t have to put in effort.
She waited a breath. Harry could feel the air in the Great Hall tremble, on the precipice of great relief and sadness. It was a physical feeling, the air around him was literally vibrating, as if straining to hold back the emotion. Was this a product of death, being able to feel the emotions so keenly?
“It was worse,” Harry managed to say, before abruptly being sick all over the floor. Zabini vanished the mess easily, and dried Harry of the water he had poured on him with an extra flourish of his wand. He moved to sit down beside Harry on his bed.
“I don’t disagree,” Minerva said. “And I admire your tenacity. But you cannot simply force your way through politics by trying to force people to agree with your opinion,
Harry rolled his eyes, but was silently impressed. This was likely the longest he had slept without nightmares since, well – as long as he could remember, anyways.
Harry let his eyes wander around the room – belatedly realizing that Andromeda was supposed to be here with Teddy. He felt panic clutch his chest, briefly, when he didn’t seem them immediately. He had been late to the start of the Feast, albeit only slightly – what if they had decided not to come and he hadn’t even noticed. Draco must have realized his panic, because he squeezed Harry’s knee and nodded towards the staff table. Sure enough, Andy was seated near the end, beside Professor Sinstra, with baby Teddy in her arms.
Her cackles were cut off abruptly as they saw the group of Gryffindor’s walking up from the entrance to the common room, which had somehow opened without them hearing. Potter looked like he was trying to hid a smile. Granger, on his left, was looking awkward, her lips turned into a frown. He was sure she was blushing, even if, like Potter, her skin was too dark for it to be visible. Weasley, however, was bright red, intently looking aroudn the common room as if it was fascinating.
Then of course, we heard about Gringotts (well done on the dragon) and we were off to Hogwarts shortly after. Our only instructions were “do not kill Harry Potter.” It did not matter to me, really, provided that if I was alive by the end of everything there was a damn good reason for it.
All in all, it looked as though there were around twenty five eighth years returning. Harry flinched again as the floo flared and Theodore Nott stepped through, felt Draco’s’ hand brush his wrist. He missed Ron and Hermione sorely in this moment, more than he had missed them yet. Something about being at Hogwarts made their absence feel profound.
Harry gave her a shrug. It wasn’t as though there was much in particular that he could say. It was strange, really, having so many people flock to protect him after a life spent in the Days Before being treated like an adult for so long before he was even near to being one.
For Draco, McGonagall had pulled some strings, it seemed, and under the guise of being supervised for “disciplinary measures” required by the ministry, she had put him in a Potions placement with the new professor (a young woman Harry had only seen on a couple occasions at meal times), which he was enjoying imennsely.
“But Dumbledore what? Dumbledore, who grew up standing for the exact same ideals as Voldemort? Dumbledore, who probably would have kept siding with Grindlewald if he hadn’t killed his sister?”
“Before the First Years enter for their sorting, I would like everyone to observe a moment of silence in remembrance of the lives that were lost here and around Britain last year, muggle and magical alike.” The Headmistress’ voice was hard, as if daring anyone to argue. No one did, though. Everyone was silent, even the Slytherins.
“Alright?” Harry asked Draco as they started walking. Draco was flushed and looked as though he’d be sick at any minute.
“We don’t need to talk about it,” Zabini said then. “It just sounded – sounded worse than your usual.”
“Can I talk to you, mate?” Neville said. He had leaned in and dropped his voice, presumably so the other three couldn’t hear him. This, Harry thought, was honestly a bit paranoid.
Draco’s hands strayed, tracing down Harry’s sides, around the curve of his arse, back up to his hair. He stood still, hands on Draco’s waist, letting the other boy explore him, make sure he was intact. “I’m alright, love,” Harry said gently. His words struck Draco out of whatever stupor he seemed to be in because Draco’s hands were fisting in his shirt and pulling him close and his head was resting on Harry’s shoulder and Harry was clinging back to him as if he were the only steady thing in the world – which, really, he was sometimes.
I sound far too pompous when writing letters. I do hope you will allow me to apologize in person. I am likely to dither less, as well.
“I don’t disagree,” Minerva said. “And I admire your tenacity. But you cannot simply force your way through politics by trying to force people to agree with your opinion,
It didn’t matter anymore, in the Days After, who liked him, who believed him. There was no one to save anymore,
“Yeah,” Harry said. “But I grieved. And I came around. So did Ginny. Draco grieved and practically relearned how to exist in society. Why is it taking them so long?”
“No,” Draco said simply. He sighed again at Harry’s expectant look. “No, I don’t want to be tracked. But it’s not as though I’m doing anything illegal, there’s nothing they’ll find. And honestly, most of those bastards deserve to be tracked anyway.”
“How about this,” he began. “There’s no one in the Great Hall right now and there won’t be until dinner. Why don’t you take the second years with you? I’ll write you a note that gives you permission.”
Pansy let out a small, dark laugh. “He’s interesting,” she finally said. “His dad was a Death Eater, I’m sure you know. His mum left him when we were in second year, I think. Left Theo with his dad for the whole summer between second and third year, thought it was still important for them to bond, I think.”
“Turn around,” Draco growled, and how could he do anything else but listen when Draco spoke to him like that? He braced his forearms on the shower wall as Draco pushed a finger into him, and then two.
this...probably could have been two chapters but oh well. enjoy a really freakin long chapter, haha. and please excuse me projecting onto mar... we stan her as much as we stan pansy now thanks :p
Harry grinned a little bit. “I’m not taking defence,” he said. He watched her mouth form into an ‘o’ of shock.
Harry obliged, gripping harder and increasing the pace. He latched his mouth around Draco’s nipple, sucking in time with his strokes. It didn’t take long for Draco to finish with a stifled cry, nails digging into Harry’s side.
And then everything was exploding, straight from his hands, his chest, his head – he didn’t know. The world was electric, like lightning. Someone was screaming – it was him, he realized. He was screaming. And then there was nothing.
“Some of you might know about them already, you’re right,” he said with a nod, “but not all of you. You’re in a unique position Arwen, because you’ve been to non-magic school and now you’re at a magic school. But many people in your class haven’t had the chance to go to a school that isn’t magic, and even if they did you don’t always learn about the same things. And there are some people here, like you, who didn’t know they were magic until they turned eleven, but they haven’t been interested in spending their time reading up on people like Grindlewald.” He let a teasing note enter his voice, “Believe it or not, there are some things that are more pleasant to read about.”
“Thanks,” he rolled his eyes. Tucking the parchment and quill into his pocket, he allowed her to lead him into the Common Room and into the corridor, the entryway grinding closed behind them.
“If he’s talking about what I think he’s talking about, I bet it was directly before he exploded,” Blaise said. Harry shrugged ruefully, trying to ignore the concerned look Draco was giving him.
He felt like crying, suddenly. Harry took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself, trying to keep his mind in his body and his eyes present on the clean-up he was doing. “They haven’t tried, though,” he said once he had gathered himself. “It took you one day to find me. And listen. They’ve – I mean, we’ve talked a bit. But they haven’t listened. They haven’t sought me out.”
Everyone was looking expectantly at Draco and Harry. Harry put his head down on the table, which prompted Draco to sigh. “We can’t all write about the same topic,” he said. There were mutters of agreement around the table, but no one else said anything. Harry assumed they were still watching Draco expectantly by the way he sighed again.
But at Hermione’s expectant look, he caved. “Muggle studies will be mandatory for everyone from first year to seventh year, starting next year. We’ve something planned for this year, too, but I’m not allowed to say yet.”
Instead of looking gratified, Harry noticed Draco looked significantly sick. “She should hate me,” he said. “It’s my fault her – and Teddy -”
He caught a startled look from Draco as Andromeda wrapped him into a hug. She hadn’t been brought up to particularly warm, Harry knew, and Draco may have expected the traditional Black aloofness in her. But she couldn’t have raised a daughter like Tonks without learning how to be warm.
“I thought we could go to our dormitory?” Harry said quietly towards Zabini, who nodded. Draco saw Harry motion towards the two Gryffindors to follow them, Blaise and Pansy leading the way.
“Let’s go then,” Harry responded, trying to swallow his apprehension at the implication of what he had just said. Draco simply looked at him for a moment before nodding at him to lead the way into the bathroom.
“That’ll be Teddy,” she said, releasing him with a look of fond exasperation. “Why don’t you go get him and I’ll make us some tea?”
“She means me,” Draco said after a moment. He disentangled his legs from Harry’s to stretch out. “I’m not supposed to be here, twat,” Draco continued at the confused look Harry shot him.
“I couldn’t do anything,” he mumbled into Draco’s lips, hardly aware of his words, burning with lust. “They would send me away, to someone else, who would say the same thing. Until,” he broke off with a hiss as Draco slid forward, straddling his hips again, rocking them carefully, once, against Harry. “Until I ended up at the veil. Bellatrix-” He felt Draco’s hands falter on his body momentarily, before they resumed their movement. “Bellatrix was hurting you and the others, and Ron and Hermione. It was like I had to
“Had to go and upset her, didn’t you, Weasley?” Blaise drawled, breaking the silence of the moment. “Is it all Gryffindors that are so tactless, or are Weasley’s especially bad at it?”
I know what you’re thinking – surely once I was at Hogwarts I should have learned to think differently. You’re right, of course. I should have. But even here, I did not learn about muggles or muggleborns. I was surrounded by others who thought those without pure blood had no place in the school. No, it’s not an excuse. I could have listened – I was too proud, too set in my ways, too determined to please my father. It’s not an excuse, I’m not trying to make excuses.
Mar started to nod, but another girl – Jessamine, gave him a doleful look. “It’s raining,” she said glumly. Harry tried not to sigh – at least not too aggressively.
“You think we wanted to hurt people? They threatened to kill our families, make us kill each other. Maybe you’d have let your family die for the greater good or whatever noble shite you believe that makes you think you’re better than us, but you’re not any better. You left by yourselves; you stayed home, you disappeared, you didn’t take a single first year or Slytherin with you.
Harry took a drag, willing his thoughts to calm. He couldn’t think, couldn’t move like this – and all the help his brain could supply him was one word –
Ginny gave him a small smile. “They’ve been through a lot, you know. Not that we all haven’t,” she added at his look. “But when they left for Australia so quickly it made me think that they weren’t able to confront their grief. They couldn’t stay here and handle it. So we,” she gestured broadly around the classroom, “Have been confronting our demons all summer. Trying to make sense of everything. They haven’t.”
“We weren’t good people, any of us,” she finally said. “Except maybe Nott. And the Greengrasses, they were always wonderful. Tracey Davis was a cow, though. Actually, I probably was, too. Crabbe and Goyle were horrendous. I have it on good authority that Goyle decided not to return because he didn’t want to see what we would do to him after we found out he may have had a little too much fun being the Carrow’s sidekick.”
“She’s not,” Draco said suddenly. It seemed like the whole eighth year table had leaned towards him to hear what he had to say around the buzz of the dining hall. They were all avoiding looking at the four of them, though. Harry couldn’t help but smirk when Draco lowered his voice so only he, Pansy, and Blaise could hear him talking.
Deciding he’d try the kitchens first, since it was on his way to the Slytherin common room anyway, he spun on his heel and headed towards the corridor that would take him to the painting of the fruit. The castle halls were quiet although it was a Sunday - the younger students were likely outside enjoying the last of the good weather and the older students studying.
He paused, breathing heavily, keeping his hands to himself before dropping them and letting them trail along the scars on Draco’s torso.
“Welcome, and welcome back to Hogwarts,” she began. “I have a few brief announcements before I can let you go for the evening.” She smiled down at the eighth year table for a moment. “You’ll notice a new set up in the Dining Hall, the table at the front is here to house the school’s eighth year students, who have come back to complete their schooling. You will see many of them in your classes, working to assist your teachers and provide extra help.
“I’ll go with him,” Draco said, almost too quickly. “None of us should be going anywhere alone,” he added.
Blaise Zabini, on his other side, was looking at him. “Not the time, Potter,” was all he said when Harry made eye contact. Harry mumbled a quick thanks back, working to calm his racing heart.
Harry let Draco push him down on the bed, straddle him, nuzzle the crook of his neck gently. He let the feeling warm him, force his mind back into my body.
With that, she swept out of the room, emerald robes trailing after her. Moments later, Harry found himself rather uncomfortably holding a sobbing Pansy Parkinson.
in the next column. Randy was quiet, Harry was fairly certain he was a half-blood or pure-blood, although he had asked none of his students about their blood status. It was clear he had never been to school before Hogwarts – he often seemed overwhelmed by the number of people in his class and the noise around the castle.
“I know we have a class that’s probably quite mixed in terms of skill,” said Professor Stone. “So we’ll start off with a practical review. Please turn to page 17 in your books. You’ll have this class to brew Dreamless Sleep potion as a review. It won’t be for an official mark, but your grade will allow you and I to see where your skill level is at.”
. You see, despite being raised my whole life to despise muggles, I had never met a single one. Not until the war, at any rate. And even then, although you may think I am lying, I’ve never hurt one. Not because I’m particularly noble, but because I believed that muggles are so pathetic that it would be like kicking a puppy. I learned about guns this summer, and nuclear weapons.
After a quick shower they headed towards the Great Hall together. With the whole school now back, it seemed much safer to eat in the Great Hall again. It was harder for the other eighth years to follow them, and even then their interest seemed to have gone from something that felt genuinely dangerous to whispered comments and threats.
She swatted him with a towel. “Yes, and you’re stinking up the whole room. Are you packed for Hogwarts?”
“More for us to keep in line of course,” Pansy grumbled. Harry shook his head slightly at her – despite her words, she seemed gratified that they had so many students. He was…possibly a little bit excited at the prospect as well. After all, the first step to opening a proper school would be learning how to interact with children.
He stayed in the forest a long while, longer than he should have. No one said anything, though, when he missed lunch. Hermione had shot him a worried look as he passed by her, trailing after the Slytherins, but he didn’t stop to think about it, to talk. Instead, he followed the gentle pull of Draco’s hand in his, the small smile on Pansy’s face, Blaise’s encouraging arm around his shoulders.
“I wasn’t really…” Harry started, but trailed off at the look Pansy gave him. “I’m sorry, Pans,” he said with a sigh, finally.
those two could somehow speak Latin. There was a great creaking and the crest split down the middle. It continued splitting to the floor as the wall moved horizontally out until a comfortably wide doorway was formed.
When the Healer proceeded with the same examination the mediwtch had, humming and hawing and finally asking to speak to Madame Pomfrey in a separate room, though, that was when Harry lost it. It was possibly the first time he had felt angry since….well, since the Days Before, probably.
Draco pushed him up against the door impatiently as soon as they entered the room. “I was so scared,” he said between kisses. It was a small thing to say, but significant nonetheless for a man who rarely talked about his feelings.
“You wait,” said Andromeda, prompting another sigh from Harry. “You let them know you’re there from them, then you give them space and you wait.”
“No,” he said, with a rueful shake of his head. “I need help with Arithmancy, though. Maybe we could all study together after classes tomorrow?”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Blaise responded theatrically. “Don’t worry, Weasley was shafted with Smith. I’m sure you’ll hear so many stories it’ll be like you lived with him anyway.”
Harry gave Draco a look. “Some of us can’t even do magic,” he griped. Draco just rolled his eyes back at Harry.
Her tapping stopped, replaced almost immediately with bouncing on the balls of her feet. “Okay!” she said, before sprinting back to her friends.
“Still,” Smith blustered. Harry felt Zabini, Pansy, and Draco shift around him. At first he thought they were trying to extract themselves from the situation, but he realized they had closed ranks behind him to mirror the stance of the other four – had closed ranks to protect him. “You don’t have to
also i made a tumblr?? i don't know how to use it, but you can find me as CaspianJames and maybe I'll learn how to use it so I can post about the fics and things I'm working on (more drarry? yes. long haul drarry? yes. fix it fic drarry? yes. trans harry? yes. so much yes.)
“She’s not that bad,” he said, when Pansy turned her look of fury on him. “She might fold your socks, though. She likes things alarmingly clean.”
“Just going to make Teddy’s bottle,” he said, shooting a fleeting glance to Andromeda. He warmed the boy’s bottle as quickly as he could – on the stove; his magic was still prone to powerful fits that tended to set things on fire.
Harry couldn’t help it – he grinned at her, then pulled their wands out of his pocket. “They can’t use their wands, either,” he added cheekily.
“You were having a nightmare,” she explained evenly, as though that explained everything. She stepped back to sit on Blaise’s bed – which, Harry noticed, was empty, and looked at him expectantly.
Harry leaned in towards Zabini. “Reckon any arrangement is fine so long as I don’t end up sharing a room with Smith.”
He winced, knowing it was coming before he even closed his mouth. He had debated leaving Draco out of it, not saying anything, but better they find out from him now than find out he was lying to them later.
“I guess I never realized that there were children coming to Hogwarts without any sort of school before that,” Harry said. “It must be hard.”
And then Draco was pressing him against the wall and his mouth was parting Harry’s, his tongue gently prodding, his hands roaming Harry’s body as if making sure he was all in one piece. They parted slowly, Harry unable to disguise his heavy breathing. He reached out as Draco leaned back, hand going to the other boys’ hair to push it behind his ear and out of his face.
“I know what you’re thinking – that you would have done the same as Neville. I’m saying it wouldn’t matter. Nothing mattered, that year. The war might have been won, but we all lost. You’d care now; I’d care now. That’s what’s important.”
“Alright,” Hermione responded primly. Harry grabbed a jumper off his bed-post before gently closing the door behind him and following his sort-of friends into the corridor.
“You are a bit of a prat,” Hermione said, looking at him from the side of her eye. With that, Harry knew he was forgiven. But he wasn’t done speaking.
Harry reached toward Draco and hauled him up by his hand, then turned to do the same for Blaise. Pansy got to her feet on her own, giving a dignified sort of sniff as she did. Draco saw Harry roll his eyes at her good-naturedly.
In the end, I was a pawn for a madman. Forgive me for saying this, but perhaps you both will be able to relate, given how you spent every waking moment with Dumbledore’s biggest weapon (yes, I mean Harry).
“Professor Binns will be there too,” Harry responded, doing his best to dodge the question. The truth was, he
“You want to study?” Hermione asked, gasping mockingly. “Who are you and what have you done with Harry?”
“I saw people who-” he shuddered at the memory, leaned into Draco’s touch “-who died in the war. They blamed me.” He didn’t specify, didn’t need to, not for Draco to understand. Draco leaned over to kiss him again, hands cupping either side of his face.
Mar furrowed her brow. “But everyone says he’s boring. I think you’ll be a better teacher.” Her fingers were tapping on her thigh again, a fast pattern that Harry couldn’t make sense of.
Harry realized he hadn’t thought of this – whether or not the eighth years would contribute to the ranks of prefects or not. It wouldn’t have affected him, but Draco and Pansy had both been prefects.
I am sure degradation was the point, with Bellatrix. That and the pain she must have caused you – the lasting scar. Have you ever thought about covering it up with a tattoo? I have, but I won’t. My mark is part of me, part of my past. I cannot erase it and I would not want to. Rather, I can only hope it will remind me to be better.
He was broken from his reverie by a sharp elbow to his ribs, and he looked around wildly, breath coming in gasps. Draco on his other side was engrossed in a whispered conversation with Pansy and didn’t seem to notice his near-breakdown.
But I cannot say that was true for me. I was not afraid of muggles, particularly, unless you count the belief that they threatened wizarding society. Polluted blood, I was told, would diminish magic over centuries until we would be nothing but muggles ourselves. Except, when you’re a child it is hard to fathom the idea of centuries – the consequences seem immediate. Maybe that was the point.
Harry took a drag, willing his thoughts to calm. He couldn’t think, couldn’t move like this – and all the help his brain could supply him was one word –
Lost in thought as he was, he hadn’t realized that Draco had stopped walking until he was a step ahead. Harry turned around to look back and Draco was kissing him. His lips were on Harry’s, hard and almost unyielding, teeth biting at his lips, hands slipped under his shirt.
She gave Harry a soft smile. “I don’t know what happened, really. You probably don’t remember him in third year, but he was tiny, like he was starved. He was angry, at first. People were picking on him, but he was picking fights with everyone he could. I guess he spent Christmas with his mum, because when he came back he wouldn’t even talk to any of us. Draco used to say he’d get to their dormitory after lights out every night, and leave before everyone woke. We think Snape let him do whatever he wanted, so long as he slept at some point. Spent a lot of time with Ravenclaws in the year above. We were all horrid to him about it, of course.
I am not writing this to make excuses to explain away my past. I was a stupid boy who made others feel small to make myself feel better. I was a horrible teenager who hurt and tortured people, who kept prisoners in my basement and played house with a madman.
Draco squeezed his hand gently as they neared a small crowd at the Slytherin table, before letting go. Harry felt the loss immediately, but was mollified when he saw two students run up to Draco. They weren’t first years at all – second or third, from the looks of it. His heart bloomed in his chest as he saw Draco bend down to address the two students face-to-face.
“Tell me about your nightmare,” Draco said, and Harry found himself complying as Draco’s hands moved again – across his chest, through his hair, under his chin.
“You will have to be careful,” McGonagall said. “Exceptionally careful with the amount of energy you are expending over the next couple weeks.”
“Heard you exploded,” said a voice from across from him. He looked up to see a seventh year prefect, Michael, looking at him in amusement. The prefects Harry knew better – he and Pansy were often coordinating with them over patrols and the time they spent in the Slytherin common room.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say to that, except a few choice words that he was sure the Healer would not welcome. However, before he could form a response, Madame Pomfrey spoke up.
He glanced over at Ron and Hermione. They were both watching with unabashed curiosity. Ron still looked like he was fuming. With some effort, he turned a smile to her. “What, Mar?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, shifting in his seat. He could tell she wasn’t upset or disappointed, not exactly, but he hated that she worried over him.
,” he choked out finally. He heard Draco whisper spells, wondered dimly if this counted as magic outside of classes, before Draco was back on top of him.
“Gryffindor idiots,” Draco said before Harry could respond. Michael was back to looking amused at Draco’s response.
He dropped into his bed in the eighth year dorms after his last class of the day, Arithmancy, and groaned. It wasn’t long before Draco, Pansy, and Blaise trooped in from Ancient Runes. Draco dropped onto the bed beside him.
He waited a moment as the class reached into their bags to pull out the requested materials, and stayed quiet until they were all settled and focused again on  him. “For the second half of the class today,” he continued, “I think we can play some games that will help us all get to know each other. But for the first half of the class I have a writing exercise for you all.” There was a collective groan from the class that he couldn’t help but laugh at.
“No,” she said. “You’re here now, and if you’re going to stay you’re going to listen. You do not get to speak.”
Harry felt another pang of… not sadness, not really – something worse. That feeling as if his heart was breaking despite already being so broken that it couldn’t possibly break anymore. “I’ll still have weekends, yeah?” he said, leaning into Draco slightly.
Their lips met, bodies aligned, gentle but desperate, calm and wild. Then Draco was slowly, slowly sliding down, burying Harry in him in exquisite heat and tightness and
Draco smiled. Just a small smile, but it was there. “Hardly,” he said back, almost a quip. “You have a very obnoxious habit of getting out of difficult situations.”
With that, she swept out of the room, emerald robes trailing after her. Moments later, Harry found himself rather uncomfortably holding a sobbing Pansy Parkinson.
“There are solutions in a lot of other countries,” Pansy finally said. “Wizarding Britain is – I mean, very focussed on blood purity, of course, but classist too. The sacred twenty-eight has the resources and influence but they won’t use it to help half-bloods or poor pure-bloods. It’s something you’re taught not to question. Until you do question it, I suppose.”
“What is it, then?” asked Draco, looking mildly alarmed. Harry didn’t blame him; Pansy looked particularly murderous.
“Professor Binns will be there too,” Harry responded, doing his best to dodge the question. The truth was, he
The class nodded in agreement. “We’re going to learn about some muggle history, too.” He anticipated whispers, and let them have a moment of surprise before hushing them. “We’re going to learn about World War One and World War Two, mostly, and what the role of wizards were during those wars. Now, can you all take out a quill and some parchment for me?”
Blaise was right – it was a stipulation of the class. They weren’t graded, per se, but they needed at least a mark of Acceptable to pass the class and they needed to pass the class to graduate. It wasn’t designed to be particularly challenging, but it was designed to be thoughtful and require participation. Honestly, Harry sort of hated himself for creating it now that his work load was so great.
“I’ll try to make sure we learn about everything you write down,” he said once he had turned around, “As long as it’s appropriate for this class. Take all the time you need, and once we’re all done we’ll do something fun, okay?”
Harry measured his next words very carefully. He could feel Hermione, especially, watching him, sure she was picking up on his tension even if she wouldn’t say it. “What exactly did Mary say to you, Mar?” he asked gently. The girl was practically bouncing in excitement, flapping her arms and smiling widely. Her movements slowed when he spoke, though, as if sensing Harry was worried.
“That still doesn’t explain…” Hermione began, but trailed off when Harry ran an exasperated hand through his hair.
I was resistant. McGonagall told me that she would not sign off on my parole unless I took tea with her daily. At first we took tea in the Headmistress’ office – the portraits are quite distracting, so then we took tea in the kitchens. It was a small start and I felt like I was held positively captive, more than I was physically, with the threat of my parole looming above my head. If I refused to speak, answer questions, be cooperative, she would remind me of her next meeting with my parole officer.
He only partially noticed Blaise disappear from his side and shoulder his way into the crowd; then reappear almost as quickly. Harry jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder. “Looks like it’s you and me, mate,” said Zabini into his ear.
Harry felt another pang of… not sadness, not really – something worse. That feeling as if his heart was breaking despite already being so broken that it couldn’t possibly break anymore. “I’ll still have weekends, yeah?” he said, leaning into Draco slightly.
He noticed the Slytherins had stayed uncharacteristically silent, too. Harry, Draco, and Pansy had taken up space at the back of the group almost immediately, and somehow Zabini had ended up on Harry’s other side. He tried not to look worried by this turn of events, where he was surrounded by the people the rest of the school hated most.
Do not misunderstand me, I am not upset by this. It was quite cunning of her, really. She understood that I was, in part, willing to learn – I just didn’t want it to seem like my idea.
things they could have been doing. Draco gave Harry a look that told him he was thinking the same thing exactly.
“It was-” Harry wasn’t sure he could even articulate how he was feeling. The spinning feeling hadn’t left his chest, not really, although it had transformed into something that felt much more crushing. He was dimly aware that he was still gasping for breath, his vision was still grey on the edges. Zabini, strangely enough, was the only constant right now – an obvious juxtaposition from his dream of the dead and dying.
Pansy was not smug. She was, in fact, not at all impressed. Harry felt her eyes on him almost as soon as he and Draco stepped into the Great Hall. Draco must have felt it, too – or maybe it was the stares of all the students trickling in, because he dropped Harry’s hand almost immediately. When Harry cast a sharp look at him, he was staring straight ahead.
Harry tilted his head back, letting it play out. Draco’s lips had moved from his own onto his collarbone. He sucked hard, then bit suddenly before lapping at the spot. Harry brought his hands up in return, pulling on Draco’s robes until he stepped back to shrug them off and then working his way through the buttons.
Instead they were kissing. Harry wasn’t sure who started it or even how it had happened, but he was keenly aware of Draco’s lips on his; hands under his sweater and roaming. Harry instinctively curled his hands in the ends of Draco’s hair, pulling his head back. Draco let Harry maneuver him, and then his lips were on Draco’s neck and he was tasting the sweet of his skin mixed with the salt of his sweat.
“What is it?” Harry asked. He took it and swallowed, dimly aware of Madame Pomfrey saying something before fell back into sleep.
He felt the ripple of the wards as he stepped outside of them, saw the world shimmer slightly and reform. Draco appeared with a pop almost at the same moment, holding the arm of an Auror, who must have side-along apparated him here. The Auror nodded once at Harry, then spun on his heel and vanished with another pop.
Is this what it had been like in Slytherin, the past six years? Always waiting for conflict, striking before others could strike, unquestioningly doing what Draco said? Although in the past, Draco would never have asked anyone to stand down, Harry knew with certainty. Draco would have led the fight. Harry would never have stood down, either. Not in the Days Before. Nor would he have taken direction from anyone else like this.
Maybe some wizards are simply fearful of muggles. After all, we still spend much time dedicated to learning about witch burnings – as if they were even a cause for fear. Did you know most killed “witches” were actually muggles? Their fear of us caused them to attack their own, which perhaps caused us to fear them.
“It was front page,” Harry said. “I only saw the headline. The Wizengamot passed a motion to track former Death Eaters.” He winced, almost, waiting for the exclamation of horror or anger but none came.
“It’s part of his parole,” Harry said dully. “And it’s important to have a committed pure-blood on the team. He knows more than anyone what information he’s missing to integrate into muggle culture.”
“I wonder why that is,” she responded delicately. She was definitely making fun of him, in her own weird way. He fought the urge to blush.
“Before the First Years enter for their sorting, I would like everyone to observe a moment of silence in remembrance of the lives that were lost here and around Britain last year, muggle and magical alike.” The Headmistress’ voice was hard, as if daring anyone to argue. No one did, though. Everyone was silent, even the Slytherins.
I sound far too pompous when writing letters. I do hope you will allow me to apologize in person. I am likely to dither less, as well.
Dozens of hands were raised – all except for a couple of kids who were muggleborn and really, really didn’t do any extra reading. “Randy,” Harry said, pointing to a Hufflepuff boy at the back with his hand halfway up in the air.
“I can feel you watching me,” Draco drawled without looking over. Harry smirked, but didn’t move from where he was leaning.
“Alright?” Harry asked Draco as they started walking. Draco was flushed and looked as though he’d be sick at any minute.
“I haven’t-” Harry had to pause again, take a deep, shuddering breath. He focussed on his breathing for a moment; slowly in and slowly out, knotting his hands in the bedsheets on either side of him. “The last time I had a dream that bad was after Cedric – after the tournament,” he said. “They were horrible, that summer – the next year, too. Because Voldemort was in my head. And now he’s gone, but…”
“When we talk about the most recent war, we’re not going to use titles like He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named or Lord Voldemort, either.” You could tell the muggleborns, he thought, because they were the ones that didn’t flinch when he said the name Voldemort. “His name was Tom Riddle, so we can either call him Tom Riddle or Riddle. None of this fancy name business.
“Whoever the new defence professor is, I suppose,” she said with a sigh. As far as anyone knew, the post had yet to be filled. At the very least, they hadn’t been introduced to any new professors, yet. At Harry’s inquring look, she added, “I’d like to be an Auror Potter, what of it?”
By the time he came back out, Andromeda was in the sitting room with a tea for each of them. Harry set Teddy down on his mat on the floor and Andromeda charmed some bubbles to float above him and keep him occupied. Harry settled himself in the couch and accepted the tea that Andromeda sent floating over with another wave of her wand.
Ravenclaw,” Mar said, as if it were the coolest thing in the world. “I told her she was pretty, and she said she’d cut my hair for me, and I really want it shorter.”
Mar gave Harry an eager wave as the four friends scrambled out of the common room to get to the Great Hall on time. Somehow, though, Harry didn’t think this was going to be the last time they were going to discuss the issue.
They were silent as they walked, Harry mulling over Pansy’s words. She was right to be hurt, he knew, and brave to admit it. He couldn’t help but feel guilt, too. If he had been here… he doubted he would have spared thoughts for the Slytherins. Doubted he would have been any better than Neville when it came to saving the first years, those outside the DA. Would have seen graffiti and throwing insults at the Carrows as the ultimate rebellion.
“They don’t,” Draco said quietly. Then he was pulling Harry – or Harry was pulling him, maybe – by the hand in the direction of his room.
Have you heard of cognitive dissonance? I learned about it this summer. When you’re presented with knowledge that goes against your beliefs, your brain ignores it – literally, unless you can consciously confront it. It’s a muggle idea – as many ideas about the brain are. They call it psychology. I don’t know why wizards have never bothered to study the mind, it seems so important.
. And it was strange – they weren’t even inside the classroom yet, not even seated, but she was speaking as if they were.
I hope you understand me some more now, not that there is much to understand. Your ideas of me are quite likely accurate.
“Let’s get you up,” he muttered to the boy, brushing the last of his tears from his eyes before leaning into the crib and scooping Teddy up by his armpits. He moved the boy to the change table to change his nappy quickly - no matter what he said about equality and muggles, some things were just better with magic. This was one of those things.
“Stop,” it was Draco’s voice, quiet but commanding, clearly directed at Harry and Blaise. He glanced at Zabini, who dropped his wand, gaze remaining on the four in front of them. Harry followed suit, turned his eyes to Draco as the other boy wiped the spit off his face, rolled up his sleeves to display his Mark – faded, but there.
“Oi!” he called as he approached the first years. Mar stopped short when he called out, prompting another first year, Jason, to bump into her. “Don’t you have work to be doing?” he asked, in his best stern professor voice.
“But when you have bad dreams, it feels like he’s still here, yeah?” Blaise finished for him. Harry nodded, to which Blaise side.
Ron scoffed – actually scoffed. Hermione looked almost frightened, but she would back Ron up no matter what came out of his mouth, Harry knew. “You were also fucking him long before we came back to Hogwarts,” Ron said, finally. “Or did you think we’ve forgotten?”
one last lil fluffy chapter before the plot picks up and harry isnt allowed to be happy anymore (kidding,,,maybe)
Later that evening, Harry found himself curled up in Draco’s bed, relating the conversation to him. When Pansy had calmed down, they had gone to the Great Hall for dinner. She had refused to tell the other two what happened – hadn’t wanted to talk about it. Draco was clearly upset by this, so after dinner Blaise had waved him away with Draco, said he’d stay the night with Pansy and Harry should stay with Draco, if only to calm everyone’s nerves before the school was filled the next day.
“You’re expected in the Great Hall for lunch in an hour where I will provide you more instructions for your first week here and what to expect upon the arrival of the rest of the Hogwarts students. Until then, you’ll find your room assignments posted on the far wall. I will not hear any arguments or requests to switch rooms, these are final.” With a last look at all of them, she spun with a swish of her robes and departed down the corridor.
Then of course, we heard about Gringotts (well done on the dragon) and we were off to Hogwarts shortly after. Our only instructions were “do not kill Harry Potter.” It did not matter to me, really, provided that if I was alive by the end of everything there was a damn good reason for it.
Slowly, Draco removed his hands from Harry’s hair; he looked like he was quivering with the effort. He took Harry’s hands and guided him to his feet, pulling him in close for a kiss.
The plan was accepted as the best one they had, although Harry knew it wasn’t, not completely. It wasn’t, because nearby, at the foot of his four-poster bed was his trunk. And inside his trunk was his invisibility cloak.
“What are we learning then?” asked Mar. She looked a little bit confused – or maybe frustrated – and was sitting slightly apart than the rest of her classmates. He decided that he would definitely keep an eye on her during this class, especially. Instead of expressing his concern, though, he smiled at her.
“War takes a toll, Harry,” she said after a pause. “Killing takes a toll. Of course it does, or it would be impossible to create something like Horcruxes out of death. You are afraid of your magic.”
“We heard that you were planning on assigning two eighth years per house this year,” Pansy began after a pregnant pause. The Headmistress looked shocked – whatever she had been expecting from the two of them, it was not this.
“What look?” Harry asked, bemused. He turned as well, so they were both sitting, legs crossed, on the bed and Draco could reach his head easier.
Draco was flushed bright red, and Harry guessed it was more from the question he had asked than their previous activities. Suddenly, something clicked and he couldn’t help but grin at Draco.
“Why don’t we go outside?” he asked after a moment of heavy silence. They followed him through the halls of the castle, toward the Entrance Hall. They weren’t talking, but he could feel them silently communicating with each other in that way they always did.
“I will not,” he sniffed. “Everyone in this room, including Pansy and Potter, has spent all summer trying to
She nodded at him, but he frowned. He felt guilty – more than guilty. He should have known Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have taken well to being forced into a conversation with Pansy, Blaise and Draco in their first moments back. Harry had been here all summer to watch Draco learn and change, had been here all summer to learn and chagne himself. His best friends had not.
Stunned into silence, Harry could only gape at Blaise. After a moment of silence in the room, he seemed to deflate with a sigh. “Sorry,” he said finally. “It’s not good, though. Those bastards will abuse their power, people are going to get hurt.”
“It’s a little bit drafty,” Draco continued. “But we’ll teach you some warming charms. There’s always a fire on in the fireplace, too, and the older students will conjure you flames that you can carry around if you ask.”
Confused, at least a little, Harry raised an eyebrow. “I already said it’s part of his parole. The Headmistress is confident in him, the plans were put together long before we came back to Hogwarts. I don’t see how I have anything to do with it.”
Pulled from thought, Draco looked down at his arm, currently covered by the long sleeve of his white button down shirt. His shirts always covered his arms now, but they couldn't conceal the shame he felt beneath the cloth.
Harry spoke with such strong conviction. A look of pure seriousness and Draco knew that these were not the type of words spoken from thin air merely to console another person. Harry whole-heartedly believed them.
hexed an innocent person and was no doubt, working for death eaters...for Voldemort...just like his spineless father.
Harry visiting Draco in the infirmary after his brief time as a ferret, offering a flask of warmed butterbeer with good intention and a half hearted smirk.
Thoughts of Potter caring about him...even as he was now, defeated and lost...it gave him a warmth that tore through his chest yearning to fill his body. Draco relinquished in the mixed feeling it produced of hate of himself for allowing Potter to have this effect on him and of ecstasy that even in this shit hole, he mattered to Harry.
. A pure-blood death eater. There was no other explanation for this person...this fierce un-caged animal that was attacking Harry. The Draco he knew must have died when the dark mark was born to his flesh.
His wand grasped tightly in his hand, twitching once more with enraged magic that wouldn't be shaken off this time.
Draco silently noted how Harry always had a way of doing that. Speaking with such assurance that it became contagious to everyone else.
Bodies entwined together. Water sputtering from blown sinks, debris scattered across the tile. Mixing of dust and blood across splintered stalls. Moaning Myrtle was by the headmaster's side, yet even she was at a loss for words, but Albus knew better.
Harry slowly stood up, though in a clear limp from the bleeding gash on his knee. He knew calling out to Draco would reveal his location, and yet there were no spells flying his way.
He tried to shoot out another hex from behind the stall in Harry's general direction, but his hand was thwarted back from a jinx and hit the stall door, causing him to rip his arm away, tearing his sleeve on exposed wood and revealing a cut from the flying porcelain above his dark mark.
With one hand he combed his fingers through the messy mop of hair that was equally beaded with sweat, the other free hand found him turning the faucet of a sink in front of him. Draco attempted to wash his face to cool down, but stopped as he looked up at his reflection, if you could even call it that, in the blurry mirror. Eyes red, face thin due to his lack of eating these days, skin grey...
He closed his eyes. Harry's voice felt soothing against the pounding in his head. It called to him from the destruction and all he wanted was for that strong and compassionate voice to lull him to sleep. Maybe never wake up. That would be easier for everyone.
Myrtle circled the top of the bathroom flying past Harry to find where Draco had been hiding, but was only met with a blast of red from Draco's wand, clumsily searching for it's target.
They were all huddled in Blaise and Harry’s room, as usual. Harry was on his bed, lesson plans for his first years spread out around him along with their introductory essays. Pansy was at Blaise’s desk, the heavy tome open in front of her. She had some complex looking calculations on a parchment beside her that Harry didn’t have enough of an arithmancy grasp to even come close to understanding. Draco was at Harry’s desk, pretending he couldn’t hear them all in favour of his potions book. Blaise was, of course, on the floor between beds.
“Okay,” Harry responded. He felt like he was missing something – they were always up early to eat by themselves in the kitchens, but surely waking a little bit late wasn’t the end of the world. Especially now that the castle was full of students, not just eighth years.
Maybe, in deciding to open a school, become a teacher, he had made a great career choice. Or maybe this would all fall apart around him. But for the first time in the Days After, Harry was feeling hopeful.
Everyone was changed, but he knew what he thought it would be like – curtains pulled around their four-poster beds, silencing spells casted, grief dealt with quietly, screaming from nightmares hushed. When he looked at the three of them – which he didn’t often, hurt as he was by their behaviour – he imagined that his guesses weren’t far off. They often looked drawn and tired. Then again, they had more horrendous memories here than he ever had, really. Nothing he had experienced could amount to the seventh year they had spent here.
“Mr Zabini, you’ll be meeting with Professor Vector in an hour. Don’t be late.” At Blaise’s nod of understanding, she swept away from them.
Harry was transfixed on the two of them. Neville had gone ghostly white, Pansy was flushed and shaking.
“It’s alright,” she said, standing from her place on the chair. “Give him here, I’ll let you two catch up.” She took Teddy from Harry, giving him a long hug when she bent down. She gave Draco a quick kiss on the forehead, to which he blushed. “I’ll see you boys in the morning.”
She lunged forward and flung her arms around him. “Thank you,” she said into his shoulder. Then she jumped back almost as abruptly as she had leapt forward. With one last, wary look at Ron and Hermione, she ran off. Hopefully, Harry thought, to do homework and not stir up anymore trouble.
“I believe Mr Potter would like to be included in any discussion,” Madame Pomfrey said to the Healer, lazily waving her wand in an arc to douse the flame as if it were an everyday occurrence. Then again, maybe it was for her. Harry was quite sure he didn’t know the half of what went on in the Hospital Wing.
The plan was accepted as the best one they had, although Harry knew it wasn’t, not completely. It wasn’t, because nearby, at the foot of his four-poster bed was his trunk. And inside his trunk was his invisibility cloak.
“You’re just jealous you don’t have hair as nice as mine,” Draco said, reaching up to tug a strand of Harry’s hair – rather harder than necessary.
Harry shook his head. Unsure if Draco could see it in the dark, he added, “No. It was unnecessary. It all was. You can’t survive a war, can’t watch people die and not be changed by it. The rest of it was…I don’t know, Draco. Beyond horrible.”
He wasn’t sure why. It wasn’t the same as his nightmares when Voldemort was in his mind, either, although these nightmares felt just as real. And yet, if anything, the terror upon waking was worse than when he had woken fearing for Sirius, or Mr Weasley.
I promise things will resolve eventually between the Golden Trio and Slytherin Trio, but it can't happen right away. I'm very consciously aware that JKR wrote about blood purity as a shitty metaphor for racism, but I think because of that it's really important to address the learning curve of the characters as they confront their own ideas about blood purity and learn how to be inclusive. that won't happen overnight, and neither will characters accept overnight that the slytherin's have changed. confronting internal biases and growing from that is a huge, huge process, and i think it's important to properly recognize and portray that!!
It was Andromeda who sighed this time. “You can’t lose your magic, Harry. If you lose your magic you lose your life.”
Harry grinned. “Wingardium Leviosa,” he said. “My first day in Charms. And then Ron used it to defeat the mountain troll.”
“If he’s talking about what I think he’s talking about, I bet it was directly before he exploded,” Blaise said. Harry shrugged ruefully, trying to ignore the concerned look Draco was giving him.
A pang went through him at the thought of Tonks – usually thoughts like these led to Lupin, which led to Sirius. He did his best to squash the feelings before they overwhelmed him.
His hair seemed ragged, sticking up in ways Harry knew a young Draco Malfoy never would have let it. There were dark circles under his eyes – the kinds Harry had from nighttime wanderings and shrieking nightmares. He wore lazily unbuttoned black robes. His skin and hair were stark against the night, not like Harry who blended into the dark except for the whites of his eyes.
Then I was home for Easter. When I was a child we would have a big dinner. Spring vegetables, the best lamb I’ve ever tasted. We would dress nicely, host other families. Pansy often came, as did Vince and Greg. Those were the best times of my life.
Uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him, Harry slid out of his chair. Perhaps in the Days Before, Harry would have shouted or thrown a tantrum to avoid the emotions he was feeling now. But in the Days After, he just didn’t have the energy.
Harry glanced over – Draco was smiling down at the first years, looking as gentle as Harry had ever seen him, like was around Teddy, maybe, but with less of the discomfort of being around a baby. The first year students seemed enraptured by Draco’s words, they were all gazing up at him almost adoringly. Harry was fairly confident that if anyone was going to be getting any hero-worship from the Slytherins it was going to be Draco, not him.
They didn’t have to wear uniforms yet, since they were the only students in the school, so Harry pulled on a soft sweater and some jeans. He ran a quick hand through his hair before giving up on attempting to neaten it altogether. He was pulling a quill and some parchment out of his trunk just as Pansy stepped back in.
She sat for a moment, rocking back and forth while she tapped her collarbone as if considering what Harry was saying. “Can I still get my hair cut?” she finally asked.
“You’re right,” said Harry, drawing a surprised look from Blaise. Which was mildly hurtful, he thought. Surely they’d know how he’d feel about this better by now. “I’m going to go talk to her, make sure there’s a Slytherin for the Slytherins.”
He glanced behind him quickly, tugging on his hair that was long enough now to graze his ears, although still wild as ever. He locked eyes with Draco, who gave him a nod and a small smile.
“Still angry, then?” he asked, despite his better judgement telling him to be quiet and just do what she said. Handling an angry Ginny was much like handling an angry Pansy – nod, agree, and do whatever she asks of you.
“Yes,” Blaise said almost immediately, his look dark. Harry locked eyes with him for a moment – he wasn’t sure when he had begun silently communicating with Blaise, but it was clear the other boy knew exactly what he was talking about. Both Pansy and Draco shook their heads, however.
But then I lost my best friend. I still hear his screams at night, I’m sure you know what that’s like. Then Harry was dead and I was somehow still alive and I thought – this is it. This is my chance to show my spine, to stand with Hogwarts.
Harry’s breathing began to slow, his brain catching up to his surroundings. He was in Hogwarts, he was perfectly safe, and he recognized that voice.
Harry could see, now, the leader Neville had become in the past year – the leader he had needed to become. Harry had thought his heart had been broken before now; broken to never be mended, that he could not possibly feel it break any more than it had, but it did. It broke a little more for Neville and the DA and all the children that had been left to their own devices at Hogwarts under the rule of Alecto and Amycus Carrow.
“Well you were the ones who got to spend all your time shut up in the Slytherin common room while other kids were tortured. We’ve heard the stories, you know – we’re not daft.” Draco saw Weasley’s blue eyes flash with anger and looked at him, almost incredulously, though he tried to hide it. He could almost feel the anger pouring from Pansy across from him.
“Alright,” Harry said, bringing his hand up caress Draco’s arm. He reached his arm, cast a cleaning spell over both of them.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said with a sigh in Blaise’s direction. “I’m dedicating tomorrow morning for arithmancy. Just you and me until lunch.” He gave Blaise a cheeky look, but the other boy just rolled his eyes.
“Just sad,” she said, giving him the kind of look out of the corner of her eye that made him feel as though she could see right through him.
“She’s not going to keep that secret,” Blaise muttered to Harry. Harry found himself laughing, a rare occurrence.
“She’s not,” Draco said suddenly. It seemed like the whole eighth year table had leaned towards him to hear what he had to say around the buzz of the dining hall. They were all avoiding looking at the four of them, though. Harry couldn’t help but smirk when Draco lowered his voice so only he, Pansy, and Blaise could hear him talking.
The common room was warm, reminding him distinctly of the Gryffindor common room. A fire was already burning in the fireplace to their right, warming the air. There was a mishmash of chairs and couches spread around it, as though the professors had simply dug up any undamaged furniture they could find in the castle. Bookshelves lined the wall opposite, and chairs and tables were scattered around. Presumably the professors expected them to get more studying done here, rather than in the library – or perhaps it was just to mimic the Ravenclaw common room. The lack of windows, however, was already making Harry feel distinctly claustrophibic.
Harry broke the silence and Draco could have sworn a piece of him that still clung to hope had shattered as well.
There it was, the soothing care in Harry's voice. Perhaps it was exhaustion. The overwhelming physical pain, mental drain, as well as emotional fatigue Draco had been sporting for months...but damn it, he wanted the warmth Harry was selling. He
That look in the Great Hall seemed to signal that long gone was the Malfoy haughtiness that Harry had become accustomed to throughout their years together-
This was new for Draco. Harry had seen fear on him when Buckbeak took a chunk out of his arm third year. He had seen embarrassment and shame whenever Draco was in the presence of his bastard of a death eater father, but Harry could hardly recognize this broken soul quaking in front of him, a discarded vest to the floor, and an overflow of water pouring from Draco's abandoned sink.
Despite his current panic, Draco couldn't help but let the ghost of a smirk play across his face at the benevolent thought.
the mark also meant exiling himself from the one person he had been infatuated with since he entered Hogwarts. The one half blood that started to make him doubt his father's ridiculous obsession with blood purity, the boy who matched Draco in Qudditch, acted with bravery when Draco himself struggled to grasp the concept, and helped Draco refine his wit, determination, and sarcasm with each heated, albeit
And then it was nearing dinner, Pansy and Blaise had gone for a walk, and it was just him and Draco and the overwhelming cloud of sadness that had followed Harry all day.
“Can I talk to you, mate?” Neville said. He had leaned in and dropped his voice, presumably so the other three couldn’t hear him. This, Harry thought, was honestly a bit paranoid.
“And you think you’re so good, Weasley?” she huffed. “Looking down on purebloods that aren’t like you, acting like school children are really the biggest enemy you’ve faced, like we’re worse than Vold-V – than the Dark Lord himself.”
Draco felt Harry’s hand grip him, perhaps reflexively, but he didn’t look over. He opened his mouth to say – well, he wasn’t sure
Harry saw Zabini raise an eyebrow and exchange a look with Pansy, but he nodded. “Guess that leaves me and Pans. To the grounds it is.” He winked at Draco, and Harry tried to pretend he hadn’t seen.
Harry reached toward Draco and hauled him up by his hand, then turned to do the same for Blaise. Pansy got to her feet on her own, giving a dignified sort of sniff as she did. Draco saw Harry roll his eyes at her good-naturedly.
“What are you doing in here?” was the first thing that came out of his mouth. It was slightly more aggressive than he intended but, well – the sun wasn’t even up.
Harry smiled as Pansy stopped pacing immediately and started at McGonagall, mouth agape slightly. He nudged her and she closed it.
Pansy looked shocked. Harry couldn’t tell if it was because McGonagall had just confirmed that there was indeed a Defence professor hired for the fall term, or because she had just been offered a method of avoiding the rest of those in their year by the Headmisstress herself. To her credit, though, Pansy merely nodded in acknowledgement.
So I simply said no, although of course I recognized Harry. I would recognize him anywhere, even then.
“Now would you like to tell me why you’re here instead of at school? Does anyone know where you are?” Harry avoided meeting her eyes, not wanting to see the worry that was likely playing out in them.
“Welcome, and welcome back to Hogwarts,” she began. “I have a few brief announcements before I can let you go for the evening.” She smiled down at the eighth year table for a moment. “You’ll notice a new set up in the Dining Hall, the table at the front is here to house the school’s eighth year students, who have come back to complete their schooling. You will see many of them in your classes, working to assist your teachers and provide extra help.
“You’ve got that look on your face,” Draco said suddenly. He was still working his fingers through Harry’s hair, washing the shampoo out.
Harry measured his next words very carefully. He could feel Hermione, especially, watching him, sure she was picking up on his tension even if she wouldn’t say it. “What exactly did Mary say to you, Mar?” he asked gently. The girl was practically bouncing in excitement, flapping her arms and smiling widely. Her movements slowed when he spoke, though, as if sensing Harry was worried.
Madame Pomfrey ushered him out almost before the Healer had finished speaking, muttering all the way about incompetent healers being the reason she was no longer in the businesss outside of Hogwarts. Harry barely listened, even to her reassurances.
“On the first if all goes well,” Harry responded. “The memory charm is reversed, but she wants to take her parents to St Mungos to make sure everything is fine.”
“What did he get probation for, Hermione? Torture? Hurting people? Using Unforgivables? We did that too, in case you forgot. Or I did, at the very least. We’re two sides of the same coin, Draco and I.”
I owe the both of you (and many others) more apologies than I could ever think I’d owe anyone. I will not be offended if you don’t read this letter, if you’d rather throw it away and continue hating me. But I hope you will give me a chance.
And then they were in the shower and Draco was lathering soap along Harry’s body and it was so simple and so domestic but Harry thought he would very well go out of his head with desire from it all.
“So did Draco,” Harry sighed. “And I’d say Draco probably has a lot less to apologize for than Dumbledore ever did.”
“That’s why your school is such a good idea, Potter,” said Pansy, scrunching her face as if the compliment hurt her to hand out. “It provides an option for families that wouldn’t normally have one.”
“Just going to make Teddy’s bottle,” he said, shooting a fleeting glance to Andromeda. He warmed the boy’s bottle as quickly as he could – on the stove; his magic was still prone to powerful fits that tended to set things on fire.
I grew up experiencing cognitive dissonance at Hogwarts. Not an excuse, no – I say this only to be able to describe when the cognitive dissonance stopped. It was not in my seventh year of Hogwarts because the only thing I understood then was that the Carrow’s tortured for the sake of pain. It had nothing to do with ideals or beliefs, so I could separate it from my beliefs. Muggles were lesser, but the Carrow’s didn’t care about that. They just wanted to cause harm, and that was undoubtedly evil.
Despite what he said, Zacharias just smirked at him. “We’ll see what your friends will have to say about being replaced by a bunch of bloody Death Eaters when they get here, then.” He turned suddenly and the crowd dispersed along with him, presumably heading to their dormitories as though nothing had ever happened.
She engulfed him in a hug before he could protest. “I will always come, Harry,” she said, and he pretended it didn’t make him tear up just a little. Then she was off to collect Teddy from Ron and Hermione and Harry was leaving the Hospital Wing, nervous that there would be too many people waiting for him when all he really wanted to do was find Draco.
Draco Malfoy was not having a good day. He had woken late that morning, of course – so late that Blaise and Pansy had almost knocked down the door only to discover him and Harry, curled up in bed, completely naked. They woke to Pansy shrieking, dramatically as always. His friends needed to learn how to knock.
Harry nodded numbly but managed to give her a small smile before his feet took him down the hall to Teddy’s room. The boy wasn’t so little anymore and he wasn’t crying anymore either - instead, he was kicking his legs in his crib, rotating his small body towards the door where Harry had entered.
Harry sighed when every single head at the table turned toward him for advice. “I’ll handle it,” he said dully. They all seemed pleased by the answer. Wankers, the lot of them.
All of this being said, I deeply apologize for the horrid person that I was, that I sometimes still am. Hermione, I targeted you constantly. I called you slurs, implied you were less than me but for a simple accident of birth. I will not bring up every incident – indeed there are likely too many to even recount here, but I am truly sorry for my deplorable actions. I am a better man now, and I will be better in the future. I understand how I have hurt you, how I contributed to a society that was bent on seeing you fail. I will no longer contribute to this. I will actively oppose these ideals for the rest of my life in any way that I can. You are welcome to hold me accountable for this.
history, the Voldemorts and the Grindlewalds of the world, rather than the Goblin Rebellions of the tenth century, mistakes that were made in the past would not continue to occur.
“I think I can decide that for myself, thanks,” Harry said, shocked at how clear his voice was. It was instinct again, that was driving him. Consciously, he mostly wanted to be sick. “I’m happy to room with Zabini for the year.”
“I wasn’t on school grounds in the first place,” Harry said grumpily, but he felt himself lighten all the same. “Shall I take Teddy through?”
“So…how was everyone’s summer?” Granger finally asked in such a false cheerful tone it made Draco cringe.
“You’re an arse, Harry Potter,” she said, finally. It felt almost a relief to Harry, to hear her say it out loud. “You’re an arse and Ron is an arse and your new friends are horrid and you just - you never think before you do things.”
“We had planning to do, Potter,” she hissed at him. “And you had to go and disappear to shag Draco instead and leave me to do it all on my own.”
“You should do Potter’s hair, Pans,” Draco said when a moment of silence got too long to be comfortable. “He wants to grow it.”
“She said McGonagall’s choosing eight eighth year students to be assigned two to each Hogwarts house. We’re supposed to make sure the younger ones feel safe, and that the older ones don’t kill anyone, I suppose,” she sighed theatrically.
“I haven’t-” Harry had to pause again, take a deep, shuddering breath. He focussed on his breathing for a moment; slowly in and slowly out, knotting his hands in the bedsheets on either side of him. “The last time I had a dream that bad was after Cedric – after the tournament,” he said. “They were horrible, that summer – the next year, too. Because Voldemort was in my head. And now he’s gone, but…”
“That’s easier said than done,” McGonagall responded, taking a sip of tea before she continued. With the tension gone from the room, Harry let himself slump back in his seat a little bit. “There is much anti-Death Eater sentiment, and for good reason.”
“Merlin, that’s twice in one day,” Draco groused as Zabini vanished the evidence with a flick of his wand.
There aren’t any answers for this, either. Did you know that there are wizards in the Department of Mysteries studying genetics and magic? I would like to work there one day, I think. My point is – perhaps we will find out muggle blood does
They had stopped walking. Draco’s eyes were on him, serious and bright. He didn’t know, really, who Draco was trying to convince – Harry, or himself.
Finally, she spoke again. “In an effort to have everyone graduate within the usual seven years, classes will run on an accelerated basis to cover the work that was missed last year and the work that is required for the current year. For those in fifth and seventh years, your heads of house will be speaking to you about the option of a slower rate of study that would have you stay at Hogwarts over the summer and take your OWLs or NEWTs in the fall instead of at the end of this academic year. You are welcome to take the longer courses or the accelerated option, we will make any accommodations necessary. As well, the eighth years will be available as tutors to students who should need it. Your professors will speak to you more about this in your classes.
It was strange, he thought, to be speaking in the History of Magic classroom without anyone speaking over him or dozing off. In Binns classes, both were usually occurring.
“You mean he’s not, now?” Harry snorted. Pansy smirked back at him, but her expression was slightly vacant.
Ron, I deeply apologize for making you my target as well. Not only was I horrid, but classist and rude. In simple truth, you are not worth less for the quality of your clothing or the number of siblings you have (I can admit this was a sore point for me. I always wanted a sibling growing up). I had no reason to attack you except that it made me feel powerful, which is utterly wrong and inappropriate. I have no desire to do this to people anymore – not to mention no desire to act as my father did toward your father anymore. If you are amenable, I would be more than happy to see no more negativity between the Weasley and Malfoy families. Of course, this is a lot to ask if you have even read this for, but please know that I will never again treat another the way I have treated you.
“Lastly, I would like to introduce everyone to our new staff this year. Professor Slughorn has unfortunately decided to retire, so we will be welcoming a new potions professor – Professor Stone has been hired to fill his post.” A friendly looking woman in earth-green robes stood to wave to the students. She seemed fairly young, although looking across the high table it seemed as though there were quite a few young professors this year.
“Oh, it was dandy,” he responded, unable to help himself. “Spending my time with only ghosts and thrice daily tea with McGonagall.”
“I- he- you-” Weasley blustered. Granger had her head in her hands. Draco strongly suspected she was crying, but couldn’t bring himself to care.
It was Pansy, though, that answered. “There are,” she said. “And I think the library has a great big book about them with pictures and everything.”
“What if,” he said finally, meeting Andy’s eyes for the first time. “What if I wasn’t supposed to come back? What if it…threw off some sort of balance? Like in the Tale of the Three Brothers. They couldn’t escape Death forever. You can’t run from it. What if…what if this is my way of dying again? Restoring balance?”
“Come on,” Draco finally said after a moment of uncomfortable silence. “Let’s just go to the Dining Hall, we need to be there soon regardless.”
“I thought you liked my hair,” Harry said, pouting but not really. Draco flicked his nose in response.
“Ms Parkinson,” McGonagall said with a sigh, “I promise you, this has been taken into account by all the professors and we have come to what we believe is a suitable arrangement.”
“You could knock,” Draco groused. He turned his body back towards Harry, bent low and nuzzled his cheek once before rolling off him. Harry, in turn, sat up quickly in an attempt to hide his very clear erection from view. Blaise’s smirk in his direction told him he hadn’t managed to hide anything, at all.
Harry shrugged. Honestly, he only knew from Ron’s complaints about how Hermione was while they were staying with her parents in Australia, but he was not about to say so. He felt suddenly very weary.
“I’m okay,” Harry said instead, pulling back as much as he could to look Draco in the face, running his hands through the other boy’s hair again. Draco’s hand came up, tracing the lines of his cheekbones, running through his hair, which Harry was certain was even more unruly than usual.
“Sure,” she said. They both stood up, Pansy with a small smile on her lips. “But lets find the other two, first, make sure no one’s resorted to fist-fighting instead of wands.”
“I don’t even want to know how you know that,” Draco’s voice said in his ear. Harry shuddered at the proximity but shrugged in response. Honestly, he only knew from Ron’s complaints about how Hermione was while they were staying with her parents in Australia, but he was not about to say so. He felt suddenly very weary.
“Everything hurts,” Harry said, sighing again. Perhaps in the Days Before he would have said he was fine, just so he could get back to his friends and his dormitory; would have protested having to stay in the hospital wing. But in the Days After he was simply tired – too tired to protest, too tired to heal, too tired to lie.
He couldn’t help but think, though, that perhaps the prejudices that had fed the war, that had already been in place, were as much the fault of those in the Hogwarts houses that constantly demonized Slytherins. Perhaps people became what you made them.
writing this so far has been SO MUCH FUN and it's 100% because of the engagement of everyone who has read it. i love u all <3 the comments on my writings style literally make me so happy, i write/blog non fiction stuff normally (if ppl are interested i'm down to self promote LMAO) so knowing so many people enjoy my prose is WONDERFUL
“Is someone going to tell me what happened now?” Harry asked with a huff. Andromeda squeezed his hand in warning but McGonagall just looked at him with a soft face. Somehow, that made Harry feel worse.
Harry exchanged a bemused look with Draco, who pulled him closer to lean against his side. It was strange to think of the bonds that had forged, in the Days Before. In another context, perhaps, it could have been comforting – but how many nightmares did these children have? How many scars, how much fear?
Pansy scoffed loudly. “Forgive me if I don’t believe in your definition of suitable.” Harry stepped slightly closer to Pansy, a quiet show of support. He didn’t want to speak, didn’t entirely fell it was his place and was sure that Pansy would not appreciate it if he did. But he did want Professor McGonagall to know that he agreed with Pansy implicitly.
“Come on, you idiot,” came a girls’ voice from his side. He couldn’t focus, couldn’t see, even; couldn’t think, but he allowed whoever it was to lead him toward the door to the classroom. He came back to the world once they were face-to-face with Professor Stone, jarred out of his panic by Draco, who had hastily dropped his hand.
To his surprise, Justin, Ernie, and Seamus all drew their wands, as well. Ernie and Seamus had their wands trained evenly on Zabini. Justin, though, Harry realized with shock, had his wand trained directly on him. At least when they made eye contact Justin had the presence of mind to look slightly abashed.
If I hadn’t been so compelled to do this on paper I am certain I would not be dithering so much, although we would certainly be arguing more. Of course you know that Harry spoke at my trial and returned my wand. I did not see him again until the anniversary in July. I did not attend the proceedings, then – I am sure I would not have be welcome – but I heard he spoke.
also i made a tumblr?? i don't know how to use it, but you can find me as CaspianJames and maybe I'll learn how to use it so I can post about the fics and things I'm working on (more drarry? yes. long haul drarry? yes. fix it fic drarry? yes. trans harry? yes. so much yes.)
Harry rolled his eyes, his hand bumping Draco’s as he passed him the cigarette. “I could visit,” he said quietly. When Draco raised his eyebrows, Harry repeated himself.
One of the seventh year prefects, a boy named Andrew, gave them a look when they approached. “We’re just deciding if we should tell the first years to get lost or not,” he said as they approached. “It’s become impossible to get work done.”
It was strange, he thought, to be speaking in the History of Magic classroom without anyone speaking over him or dozing off. In Binns classes, both were usually occurring.
Harry smiled as Pansy stopped pacing immediately and started at McGonagall, mouth agape slightly. He nudged her and she closed it.
“Must not be bad, being here this summer,” Harry said after some silence. “Better than,” he gestured broadly.
I maaay have stolen some visuals from the movie (as opposed to the books) for part of this chapter. Please don’t hate me, it was more dramatic. Some frank discussions of war and PTSD-like symptoms although the phrase is never used, just as a trigger warning!
“You will have to be careful,” McGonagall said. “Exceptionally careful with the amount of energy you are expending over the next couple weeks.”
“Then what?” Harry asked. “I can’t see them wanting to speak to you, either way,” he said honestly. Draco reached out to tug on Harry’s arm, pulling him back down to the bed.
“It’s not important,” she said. Harry was impressed – not even he was that flippant with McGonagall. She was still the Headmisstress, after all. “What’s important is you
“Should have chosen a different subject then, shouldn’t you have?” Blaise asked with a smirk, looking up from his position on the floor where he was playing a one-person chess game.
She gave Harry a soft smile. “I don’t know what happened, really. You probably don’t remember him in third year, but he was tiny, like he was starved. He was angry, at first. People were picking on him, but he was picking fights with everyone he could. I guess he spent Christmas with his mum, because when he came back he wouldn’t even talk to any of us. Draco used to say he’d get to their dormitory after lights out every night, and leave before everyone woke. We think Snape let him do whatever he wanted, so long as he slept at some point. Spent a lot of time with Ravenclaws in the year above. We were all horrid to him about it, of course.
Harry could tell when Teddy saw him, not because of the smile on his face or the way he babbled, but because his hair turned almost instantly into an unruly jet black.
“You’re actually daft,” Blaise said. Draco could hear the false amazement in his voice, the mocking tone. His friend’s face was hardened, looked almost impassive but Draco knew that for Blaise, that meant he was angry.
“What are you waiting for? We need to go.” Pansy spoke as if he were particularly daft. Given the time of morning, he probably was.
Harry rolled his eyes, but was silently impressed. This was likely the longest he had slept without nightmares since, well – as long as he could remember, anyways.
“Does anyone know the name of another wizard who started wars before Riddle, when many of your grandparents or great-grandparents were young?”
Draco shrugged in what Harry assumed was acquiescence. “I don’t want to lock myself in a room with them anyhow,” Draco said. “That’s asking for disaster.”
Maybe it wasn’t his death, really, that had changed his life so significantly. Maybe it was many tiny things. His death, sure. Andromeda, finding him tired and sobbing over Lupin’s body that same day. Charlie, taking him under his wing when his best friends had left.
“Your magic, though,” Andromeda said, only a smile to acknowledge his words. “I do believe the healers are correct, but so are you.”
I am not writing this to make excuses to explain away my past. I was a stupid boy who made others feel small to make myself feel better. I was a horrible teenager who hurt and tortured people, who kept prisoners in my basement and played house with a madman.
Before Harry could say anything, he was engulfed in Andromeda’s arms. It felt like home, as it did every time, but the homesickness hit him this time like it hadn’t before – perhaps because of his nightmare the previous night, or because of how he had been feeling all day. He let himself cling on tightly for a moment before pulling away.
Andromeda knew that. The second part, though, was more upsetting. After all, it wasn’t as though Andy had
“Still,” Smith blustered. Harry felt Zabini, Pansy, and Draco shift around him. At first he thought they were trying to extract themselves from the situation, but he realized they had closed ranks behind him to mirror the stance of the other four – had closed ranks to protect him. “You don’t have to
Technically he couldn’t write such a note – he wasn’t fully staff, but he doubted any of the teachers would begrudge him. “If you find any first years or second years in other houses that aren’t doing work, take them too,” he said.
, Potter.” Harry jumped, accidentally jostling Draco’s head off of his shoulder. It was Blaise, who normally never rose his voice. He was glaring daggers at Harry. “She didn’t do shit for us last year, left us to save ourselves, just like the rest of your stupid little army.”
“The thing is,” Neville continued, “Things will stay this way unless you…well, show your house loyalties, if you know what I mean.”
“Mandatory even for muggleborn students?” Hermione asked immediately. Harry sighed to himself, nodded at her.
Saint Mungos was much the same as it had been the last time Harry visited it - after Mr Weasley had been attacked by Nagini. It was less frightening now, however, walking through the halls with Madame Pomfrey at his side into the outpatient area of the Spell Damage ward. At least, there was no one with teapots on their noses or legs cursed to dance forever.
Harry felt himself draw his wand and raise it. It wasn’t concisous, was completely instinct – something that remainded from the Days Before, perhaps. He saw a flash in his peripheral vision – Zabini, also drawing his wand.
“No?” Harry asked in surprise. Looking closer, of course, he noticed that some of them looked newer than the others, still pink and puckered under his hands. He leaned down to look closer, trail the paths they made with his fingers, felt Draco shudder under him.
Harry watched Pansy and Blaise exchange exasperated looks. “One day,” Harry said, “I’m going to introduce you to a Walkman. Or noise-cancelling headphones.”
He was woken, unsure of how much time had passed, to Draco shaking him. “The Welcome Feast is soon,” Draco said. “And we need to find Blaise and Pansy.”
“I should have told you,” he said, finally, from the start. “It was just…he was feeling everything I felt, you know. We were sad and afraid in the same way. And-” he broke off with a sigh, looking away from Hermione. “It’s Draco Malfoy. He’s always been..there.”
Opening his eyes, Harry reached forward and traced the newer scars on Draco’s chest, caressed the Mark on his arm. “It was war, Draco. We all have blood on our hands.”
“I’m going to pretend that made any sense,” Pansy responded. “Blaise has gone off to the kitchens. We’re supposed to meet him there in about…” she trailed off to glance at her wrist, as if she was wearing a watch. She wasn’t. “Now, but you’re bloody hard to wake up.”
Food had appeared on their plates as the sorting finished. Harry picked at it, more focussed on Teddy than anything. He let the conversation of the Slytehrins ebb around him, content to just sit and not think for a moment.
“This involves you, too, you twat,” she said sharply. “I can’t do this with just Potter, he’s useless!”
Mar started to nod, but another girl – Jessamine, gave him a doleful look. “It’s raining,” she said glumly. Harry tried not to sigh – at least not too aggressively.
Harry sighed inwardly. “We don’t have houses this year.” He was being deliberately stubborn. He knew what Neville meant, of course. Knew he didn’t mean it in bad faith, not exactly. They were all scared and scarred in their own ways.
It didn’t take long at all before Harry felt his world explode, Draco’s name on his lips. He was dimly aware of Draco finishing after, sticky heat on his stomach before it was wiped clean with a spell. He felt Draco release his arms, and then the world faded.
“Harry!” Was the first thing he heard when he stepped out of the fireplace into Andromeda’s living room. “What on earth are you doing?”
“I don’t even want to know how you know that,” Draco’s voice said in his ear. Harry shuddered at the proximity.
“I have a plan for how we should talk to the Slytherins tonight,” she said. She pursed her lips and reached around to whack Draco on the back. Harry couldn’t see what he had been doing, since he was currently leaning against the other boy, but presumably what he wasn’t doing was paying attention to Pansy.
“Of course,” Harry said warmly to Andromeda instead. She handed him over and with a small squeeze of Harry’s shoulder she was off to the High Table. The timing was good – just as she left, the sorting hat was sat upon its stool by Professor McGonagall. Harry shifted Teddy in his arms so he could lean against Draco as the hat began its song.
“Don’t tell me it’s different because you’ve sucked his dick,” she said between cackles. Draco buried his face in his hands. “I don’t think that will work with Granger, I’m not sure she has one, but you could always try with Weasley.”
You three had to continue to save me, of course. I had accepted it, with the Fiendfyre. What a stupid decision, but it was alright. If we were going to kill Harry Potter at least I would be dead, too, and the result would not matter.
“Maybe she should,” he groused. “This is different, though.” He paused for a moment, searching for the words to explain
