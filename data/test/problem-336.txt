"Yes." It was such a simple, short word. How could one word turn Harry's entire world on its head?
"What are you saying?" Harry was proud of how calm he sounded. This was only a misunderstanding, after all. Malfoy had never offered anything Harry wanted in their entire lives, except maybe this trip to the past which had turned into such a disaster. He couldn't possibly now be offering…
"...No."
Inured to the other boy's evil eye since sixth grade, Harry continued: "The question is, do we still stay here the full two weeks or is there any way to speed up the return to our own time?"
"Draco?" Harry asked softly.
"Potter?"
Harry found that the heat in his chest had drastically changed from a glorious warmth to the burning fire of embarrassment. What if he had misjudged things? What if Draco really just wanted a casual affair, a one-off, and not a relationship? Harry had behaved like a right heel, then. They were in the middle of having sex, for fuck's sake, and he dropped the L-bomb on Draco.
"Yes, that," Draco said, finally looking at Harry again. "C'mon." His legs around Harry tightened, nudging him to move,
"I don't… huh."
Draco had mentioned something like that in their earlier talk as
"I'm not worried about that."
"Ow," Harry said.
Neville blushed, himself. "I'll keep that in mind."
"Woah there," Harry said, smacking Draco's thigh in playful warning. "Don't kill the hand, I still need it."
"A camera, Longbottom. I know you wouldn't pass up the chance to keep a memento of meeting your idol. So: Did you?"
Unlike usual, Neville did not pull her into a hug, but shrank further into his chair and looked down at his hands as he continued his tale. "It was. And still the damned plant would not let me go. Nothing seemed to harm it in any way." With an obvious effort of will, he raised his eyes to meet hers as he spoke the next words. "Nothing except for the Unforgivables."
"Very eloquent, Mister Malfoy."
"Thanks," Harry said. "Want me to do your back?"
"It was actually Voldemort who found the Resurrection Stone; don't ask me where and how. Dumbledore found Voldemort's hiding place and took it, then later passed it on to me." Harry didn't go into the details. The less said about the second time he died and did a Frankenstein impression, the better.
That was what Harry had been asking for; but it wasn't what he had furtively hoped to hear. It must have shown on his features, for Draco's own face scrunched up, obviously displeased. Harry felt even more foolish, now.
"But Hufflepuff refused to see you?"
Neville nodded grimly. "Turns out that the killing curse is as deadly for plants as it is for human beings."
"I didn't think I could love you more, yet here we are."
At night, they made their beds in a small cave that they spelled shut with a large boulder before going to sleep. It was mildly claustrophobic, but, as Malfoy convinced Harry: safety first. Harry was pretty sure Malfoy had a skewed perspective, never having been made to sleep in a small, dusty cupboard beneath the stairs; but in this instance, he grudgingly conceded that Malfoy was right. So he kept his peace.
If, by some miracle, Malfoy and Harry did end up in bed together, Malfoy would probably exit five minutes later with a disgusted sneer because Harry had no idea what the fuck he was doing.
"Yeah. While you were down in the chamber, I was chanting right along with you, thanks to the nifty little spy charm Luna gave me. I was out in my own botched rune circle - again, copied from you, flaws and all - hidden among the devil's snare in my partition of greenhouse five."
Harry had a momentary lapse where the image of two flesh-eating slugs dangling off a branch with their penises wrapped around each other like a kinky sort of macramé flashed into his mind. He hastily chased the unbidden image away and focused back on the naked form of Draco Malfoy, enticingly spread out for Harry's pleasure.
Of course, 'sane' was a bit hit and miss with both of them at the best of times. Witness Malfoy possessively clutching the single bezoar they owned between them while Harry went ahead and tasted the five-foot long fish they had accioed from the nearby river, scraped out of its sturdy, scaly hide, gutted with zero expertise, then grilled over an incendio-induced fire. Thank Merlin their wands worked the same way in this time before the Great Unbalancing as they did after! Neither of them would likely have survived two days otherwise.
"Still want you to fuck me," Draco mumbled.
Oh, and also very excited.
"Yes, alright, let's not talk about this now," Draco said irritably.
"Do all of them need to be applied before the sex or are there some that work afterwards, too?"
Twenty minutes passed. Harry slowed down the more his stomach filled. He began cutting stripes off the remaining carcass to roast beside the bit they had termed dinner. He hadn't liked the beef jerkies or shrink-wrapped dried fish amongst Hermione's provisions while they were on the run, but he had been grateful for them nonetheless. Unpleasant food was far superior to none. Harry had no idea how many fish were actually in that river; best to preserve what they had any way they could.
He hated swimming in ice water.
"You look like you've seen a dementor!" Hermione drew him into a hug. "Are you alright?"
Wide-eyed, Draco looked up at Harry's face above his own. "Me either." His voice sounded raw.
Besides, according to the Hogwarts rumour mill, Malfoy was quite experienced in sexual matters. Harry, for his part, had rather lacked for opportunities, what with fighting to stay alive and out of Voldemort's clutches ever since he'd entered the wizarding world. There had been that desperate fumble in the woods with Hermione, but she was firmly back with Ron now, so the less said about that, the better.
"Oh Merlin, Neville!"
Harry looked at the large, scaly body with the immense, tree trunk-sized legs, the absurdly long neck and even longer tail. "Oh you've got to be kidding me."
Harry laughed. He raised his head to look his lover in the eye. "Draco. When have I last actually been to my flat in Camden?"
"Raiding a muggle store for more toys, I believe. Too bad, really. The look on your father's face was priceless. I'll have to rent a pensieve to show you…"
"So muggles know of dragons?" Malfoy asked, looking honestly surprised.
"Umh," Draco made. Apparently he'd also felt it.
"Wish it were that simple!" Neville ruefully shook his head. "No, I never asked. Instead, I got Luna to make me a spy charm and then I copied their ritual, rune for rune and word for word. When they travelled to the past, so did I."
"I was desperate," Neville continued his tale. "There I was, so confident of my herbology knowledge, and about to be strangled by what appeared to be a simple sub-species of devil's snare. My body was completely relaxed, and still it was trying to immobilize my arms, it was cutting off my air supply; and when an incendio did nothing whatsoever to deter it, I panicked. I ended up throwing every cutting and blasting curse at it that I'd learned in the DA or seen anybody use in the Battle of Hogwarts."
"Ehehe."
Undeterred by his emotional crisis, his prick inside Draco's body was still hard enough to drill holes. At Harry's attention returning to it, it gave an eager twitch.
"What?!"
Neville swallowed nervously. He sat down at their table and took a sip of water. Hannah sat down next to him, taking his free hand and holding on tightly.
"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!" Harry burst into the clearing screaming his head off, too disoriented and horrified to notice he had made it home until he ran smack into Malfoy and they both fell to the ground in a tumble of limbs and wands.
He hated to admit it, even to himself, but Harry realized he had a problem.
Harry looked at the smirking bastard in stunned surprise, then hastily spread his legs. He felt his prick take a marked interest and decided to shift around so he could at least partially lean against the tree trunk. Danger of falling off the tree branch in his excitement averted, for now. Let it not be said that Harry Potter didn't know how to plan ahead.
"Tell me, Longbottom: Did you bring a camera?"
Ah, yes.
"Okay," Harry said, dazed. "Sure." He'd only been dreaming of exactly that for the last five months or so. No big deal.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sure," Harry said and made as if to withdraw his hand.
When Harry had gotten up this morning, he seriously hadn't seen this coming. But he was ridiculously happy with where he was right now. Slowly, eager to please yet afraid of causing pain, Harry inched his finger into the tight opening.
amazing, I suppose. Nobody thought time-travel of that magnitude should ever be possible. ...I still think it isn't. I believe we only got there because we were meant to be. Because history needed us to be - but I am getting ahead of myself."
Harry nodded frantically and followed Draco's not so subtle prompt.
Of course, Malfoy didn't know that Harry owned three items saying he didn't really have to worry much about accidentally getting killed. Meanwhile, Harry had no idea if Malfoy would actually give him the bezoar if it poisoned Harry to the point of unbearable pain, but not death.
"Oh!"
Harry leant back and took a moment to appreciate the picture Draco made, naked against the rough bark of the tree, hanging from his invisible bonds to lean in toward Harry, his eyes burning with arousal and an edge of pleading.
"Right…" Harry supposed that was kind of an answer. And, since the dinosaurs were assumed to be extinct and hadn't been traceable in the muggle world for millions of years, potentially valid.
Hannah was a wonderful audience. She gasped, then covered her mouth with both hands, waiting with baited breath for the story of how he had escaped that predicament.
Harry chewed.
"That, yes. Still haven't ever felt this close to anyone."
"By the time our two weeks were up, I had seen several carcasses of fallen dinosaurs."
It turned out that even Malfoy didn't know of a way to speed up their return schedule, the delicate balance between the potion, charms and rune scheme involved making any alterations to their stay in the past potentially lethal. He could, however, reassure Harry that despite missing their mark by several million years, he was confident they would still return at the end of the originally planned two weeks. They may not have learned the secret of Hufflepuff's lost formula against dementia for their joint eighth year herbology project, but at least chances were that they would get through this in one piece.
Harry watched, amused, as Malfoy took down the second half of the piece termed dinner, cut off a large chunk and savagely bit into it. "For what it's worth, it didn't taste off and I'm feeling fine," Harry commented.
"Oh yeah?"
Neville snorted. "You think that would have stopped those two?"
The huge beast didn't seem to hear him. Undeterred by Harry's disapproval, it ripped another mouthful of leaves out of the crown of the tree and started peaceably chewing it.
Harry didn't let it phase him. "Takes one to know one." Harry would never get tired of harmlessly bantering with Draco. For so many years, they had sniped at each other in earnest. To trade insults now and know that they were not actually meant to hurt? That was immensely freeing. He felt light, and happy; and very ready to have exciting sex with Draco.
Neville gulped, looked away; then nodded.
"I… may or may not have an artefact that will allow me to contact the dead."
When he said it like that, it just sounded cheap. "Basically, yes."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes."
Withdrawing his hands from Hannah's body, Neville gulped, then looked up at the ceiling rather than at her. "A… a week after my arrival in the past was the first time I heard a dinosaur cough."
Malfoy's eyes were glued to Harry's lips. Looking up, Harry met his eyes briefly before the other man looked away. "Tastes okay," Harry commented, trying to break the awkward silence.
"Just that doing it, ah,
"I know that now," Neville conceded. "Just… old habits, I suppose. You know how my gran always..."
"No." Neville huffed an exasperated laugh. "Because when have you ever known things to simply work out for me? There's a reason I am known for being clumsy and accident-prone, and it's not all down to Uncle Algie, either."
Gods but he hoped Malfoy really knew what he was doing.
Harry wiped his glasses and glared hard into the distance.
Harry kissed him. "I love you. Just wanted you to know, in case we don't make it back."
"Merlin, I love you so much!" Neville stood up and wrapped his arms around Hannah. They stayed like that for long minutes before slowly separating again. Neville took a step back and focused on Hannah with a serious look. "Before we… do this. Before we announce it to the world. There's something you need to know about me."
So that happened between humans, too.
"Say, those contraception charms, uh…"
It wasn't like Malfoy was still his enemy, but they weren't exactly friends, either. With how often Malfoy made it clear that Harry was not in the pureblood heir's league, lacking breeding, education, finesse and elegance, Harry was under no illusion that the other man would ever desire him.
"It's not?" Harry looked up at Malfoy, feeling cautious hope stirring in his chest. "Then what did you mean?"
Ron honest-to-god blushed. He blushed! At that point, Harry had hurriedly left the premises, trying not to burst a gut laughing at them.
Draco's eyes widened as his hands were stuck to the tree trunk as though with magic superglue. Like Harry, he had two wands, the holsters securely strapped to both lower arms, but with the way even his separate fingers adhered to the tree they were going to do him as much good as a stuffed vulture hat in potions class. "Now you can't accidentally fall, no matter what I do to you," Harry said, bending down and caressing Draco's cheek. Harry grinned impishly. "Or get away."
Harry's heart skipped a beat.
...Anyway, when they weren't otherwise occupied, Harry did nothing but look at Malfoy. Be it that they were talking about school, trading gossip or coaching each other on their weaker subjects, be it that they were lying side by side looking up at the unfamiliar stars; no matter where and when, Harry's eyes would always stray back to Malfoy, to his fine-boned cheeks, his elegant nose, his narrow yet nicely curved lips, the eyes that were so expressive when he let go of his pureblood prince's mask. Harry's fingers itched to card through that glossy, blond hair. He wanted to know if it felt as soft as it looked.
"Mm-hm."
Draco didn't complain for long after Harry renewed the lubrication charm and bent back to his former task. The make-out session in the tree had been hot, with Draco all tied up and open for Harry like that, Harry thought. But this was nice, too. Draco was a lot more relaxed, now that he was comfortable, and the angle was easier on Harry's wrist. His finger easily slid in and out and he could soon add a second one, then a third.
Draco. He knew how Draco reacted to a challenge, to danger or to a positive surprise. He had seen the other man run the gamut of emotions during their shared school years, from happiness to anger to pain and heartache.
The fifth day of their involuntary prehistoric adventure, Harry decided he had to think. He left Malfoy in charge of grilling their second large fish and went off to scout the perimeter for dangerous predators. As he crept through the bushes and slunk along boulders, his wand always at the ready, he thought about his tragic crush on Malfoy.
"Exactly. Well, when I came upon them, they were. Uh. Done courting."
Draco mewled.
Laughing, Harry repeated the same gesture again, once, twice - and Draco came all over his own belly and Harry's left hand.
"Oh, wow…"
"You sure about this?" he asked, one hand sliding smoothly up Harry's thigh.
"That's not necessarily a bad thing," Malfoy said, and did Harry imagine that or did the blond sound
Laughing, Harry slid his finger back in. "Much better," Draco sighed. He sounded so relaxed, and content. Harry preened inwardly. He liked that he had done that to Draco. But he also thought he might like to experience that himself, sometime.
"I rolled my eyes so hard it kind of hurt," Harry explained.
"Oh no! So, did you…?"
Hodag - common Suriname toad
"Not surprisingly," Hannah immediately corrected him. "You are a strong man, Neville Longbottom, no matter what your family would have you believe."
"This okay?" Harry asked. There had been a time when Malfoy would have punished such insecurity with a sneer, and Potter would have tried to defend his honour by lashing out. But here and now, Draco stared earnestly into Harry's eyes, licked his dry lips and nodded choppily.
They'd decided on a two hour safety period before Malfoy would attempt to eat. If Harry hadn't dropped dead by then, Malfoy would go ahead and try his luck. Maybe one hour had passed by now. Harry was feeling pleasantly full, but the scent of the grilled fish on the wind was still attractive to him. He had no idea how Malfoy was holding out on his empty stomach while smelling that.
Harry was surprised he remembered and bothered to ask about it. Since the end of the war, Malfoy had never wavered from his claim that he was proud to be a pureblood, but disgusted by his father's association with the madman called Voldemort. It had bought him a ticket out of Azkaban and back into Hogwarts after the end of the war. Harry was somewhat relieved not to see his childhood nemesis in prison - not least because that brief, panicked broom flight they had shared had felt a lot better than he thought it should have. As always, Harry hastily pushed that thought aside.
Kneazel, Werewolf - cat, dog
Perfect.
Testing the waters so to speak, Harry twitched the finger still buried inside Draco a little. Draco hummed, but otherwise didn't react. Harry frowned, considering his options. He could keep this up until Draco was ready to go again, but chances were his hand would cramp long before that. Having sex up in a tree was kind of hot; yet comfortable it was not. Also, his knees were scraped raw and he didn't want to know what the skin across Draco's shoulder blades looked like.
"You could just take them off, you know," Malfoy suggested, his eyes half-lidded.
Malfoy frowned. "I suppose. Why wouldn't they?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "You are such a dimwit sometimes."
"I should have known."
Harry nodded mutely.
Draco shrugged. "I am exploring my Gryffindor side this week, don't you know. This will be fine."
"And you have not been hunted by them, either, nor been otherwise in mortal danger."
"Uh-huh."
Malfoy nodded encouragingly.
"Yes."
"You just keep telling yourself that," Harry said, and reached out to condescendingly pat Malfoy on the head. Curiously, the action didn't earn him the expected cuff around the ears, but just a pair of hunched shoulders. The other boy didn't pull away, though. How odd.
Draco's hips immediately pushed up, straining to lean into the touch; Harry evaded. Again, Harry extended a single finger, this time touching it to Draco's left nipple. Draco arched his back in response, but once again he was foiled by his bonds. Again and again, Harry reeled Draco in, and the blond arched into his caress. Harry kept torturing Draco with feather-light, swift touches until he had his partner cursing and begging him in turns.
"No," Hermione replied at once. "That may have been a bit more simple had it been the case. They're actually a sort of... hybrid. The ritual and potion seemed to have forced their DNA to blend with that of a bird."
"It's not," Ron retorted. "They were on a mission. They stayed together and the mad bint threw potion at them. Harry had no control over it. But they did protect the others on the team."
"It's a nice body," Draco shrugged with a mischievous grin.
He stopped at a Chinese restaurant and picked up an assortment of food before popping over to Harry and Draco's house. He apparated into their living room to find them on the enormous cushion that Hermione had brought them months before.
Kingsley cleared his throat. "Mr. Malfoy, three children are a massive undertaking," he said calmly.
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Yes, well... I trust your family is well?" he questioned. "Is your child a patient?"
"Just calm down," Hermione said. "Harry will alert me immediately when it's time. I'm leaving a few things here that I'll need. We'll make it as painless as possible." She lifted her wand and cast several spells, checking Draco's vitals. After several moments, she nodded, looking pleased.
"Absolutely," Ron agreed. "You've got to be in top form for this one," he added, nodding at the egg in his arms. "Tomorrow I'll bring eggrolls, lo mein... Make me a list and I'll bring whatever you like. If you want to invite or friends and make it a party, we can do that too."
"Sentimental nonsense," Lucius scoffed.
His gaze fell to his desk and he spotted a piece of parchment that hadn't been there before. His eyes scanned the writing, widening in concern just before he doubled over in pain.
“We’re ready for the gift exchange,” Hermione said, shooting Harry an amused look.
Draco sighed happily, wrapping one arm around Harry's neck while his other hand was held in Harry's loving grasp. He cooed softly when Harry kissed his fingers.
Ron lost it and erupted into a fit of childish giggles. Harry hid his face in hands. Lucius looked confused and horrified.
"He tried to kill you," Ron reminded him.
Lucius fixed Harry with a stern gaze. "Do you intend to marry my son?" he demanded.
Draco buried his face in Harry's neck, letting his tears fall unchecked. He could hardly believe this was happening. It shouldn't have been possible. But bizarre circumstances had thrust them into this unbelievable situation. Now they were faced with a choice that Draco never thought he'd have to make.
Harry nodded his agreement. He set aside the newspaper and smiled. "Maybe you'd like to fly with me for a bit," he said. He'd been forced to limit his activity after his injury, but he was fully healed now and eager to stretch his wings.
"Mr. Malfoy is pregnant," the other healer said bluntly. Hermione shot him a dirty look.
"The second one," Draco responded, grinding his erection against Harry's.
"Your three children," Draco supplied, kissing Daniel's round cheek noisily.
Lucius sighed. It had been difficult to adjust after the war. Becoming aware of his only son's infatuation with the Chosen One had been a shock. Though, Lucius probably should have guessed much sooner. Narcissa certainly had. The desire to continue their Pureblood lineage was strong. But more potent was the desire to see his son happy. Lucius had watched his son suffer for his father's mistakes and Lucius would have to live with that guilt. But here was a good opportunity to perhaps make up for a tiny bit of all that.
"Is- Is the baby alright?" he asked hesitantly.
Draco remained still, watching Harry warily.  “What is this then?” Draco demanded.  “Why would you deliberately torment me?”
"Good as new," Pansy assured him.
"I'm a little afraid they might flirt themselves to death before anything fun happens," Ginny whispered, shamelessly inserting herself into the conversation.
"Draco?" a voice called out.
"They've been very sneaky about it," Pansy agreed. "Much more so than Blaise and Ginny."
~~HPDM~~
"There's so much food," Harry muttered, staring at the food laden table in shock. "Why in Merlin's name would we need this much food?"
"Will you stay?" Harry asked, looking at Ron hopefully.
"How dare you!" Lucius growled, rising from his seat and lifting his wand.
"Draco Malfoy, I'm not your sodding house elf," Pansy said sharply. "You requested an alarming number of sweets but insisted that I refrain from using magic as much as I can. You can bloody well wait a moment."
"I mean, the back pain is wretched and I have crying at the slightest provocation," Draco explained. "But, there's something about carrying our children, protecting and nourishing them inside my body... And you make the difficult parts of it easier for me. You get so cuddly and sweet."
"Ron!"
"What do you mean?" Harry asked.
"A plug?  What do we do with it?" Draco asked.
"Frustrating," Ron said with a sigh. "I wanted to strangle Grant every time he spoke to me. But, I'm completely certain that there's no Imperius curse at work. I'm slightly less certain about whether or not he is working with those other wizards, but there's not much doubt. Kingsley said that he and Robards agree with me."
"Thank you Mister Draco!"
"Fine," Draco said waving his hand dismissively. "But this isn't a muggle hotel. You can't all stay here."
Harry sighed. "Draco, I'm terrified," he admitted, folding his arms over his chest. "Some lunatics made us half bird and we don't know why. We've changed in ways that we don't fully understand and we may never be fully human again. We haven't had much time to fully appreciate what that could mean. The life I chose for myself has been taken from me." He paused, looking away. "You make me feel better."
"Make love to me," Draco blurted out, his lips still brushing against Harry's.
"I'd love that," Harry said, his smile softening. "We'll wait a bit of course, but if you're willing..." He trailed off, stroking against Draco's abdomen lovingly.
HPDM~HPDM
"He's so good with them," Pansy said, waddling up to Harry. Her stomach was full and round with her first child. Ron was very excited about becoming a father.
Hermione gave a little shriek, not expecting to find someone standing in her office. She felt no relief when she realized it was Harry carrying Draco. She drug them across the hall to an exam room while Harry rattled off the details of the last few days.
"Kingsley won't be happy," Draco added. He gave Harry a searching look. "Maybe we need to help with this. Ron doesn't have a partner."
Harry smirked wickedly as Grant tried to disable one of the wards. After a moment, Harry's magic lashed out and Grant cried out, dropping his wand as if he'd been burned. And he had. The skin on his hand was red and already blistering. Swearing colorfully, he snatched up his wand with his other hand and apparated away. Ron and Harry exchanged a smug high five before retreating back into the house.
Draco bit his lip. "Our other friends could protect the egg," he said, his voice wavering.
Harry stirred two hours later, moaning softly in pain before his eyes fluttered open. "Ron," he whispered, wincing as he shifted in the bed. "Where's Malfoy? Is he alright?"
Ron paced in the waiting room at Saint Mungos, his eyes unfocused as he remembered the condition he'd found Harry and Draco in. Their screams of pain still echoed in his mind. Even after they had passed out from the pain, they still groaned and shuddered.
"I bet we could fly if we started from higher up," Draco said.
Harry had always been a little reckless. He supposed that his heart was too. The love that Harry had resigned himself to never find was overflowing and soothing his battered soul.
"Fat," Draco admitted, standing up. He ran one hand over his stomach, biting his lip. "Can you see it?"
"That's good," Draco said quietly, shifting closer to Ron and looking down at the egg.
"It was beautiful," Draco agreed. "Thank you."
Harry looked at Draco and his breath caught. Draco was looking the baby boy over intently, gently brushing away tears and allowing little Daniel to drool on his robes. "Hello Daniel," Draco said softly. The baby had dark brown curls and blue eyes, much like Maddie.
"Harry looks like he's just now realized that flirting is an option," Neville put in quietly.
Harry grinned, pulling Draco closer for a sweet kiss. They watched as Maddie rushed over to Lucius for a hug before allowing herself to be cuddled by Narcissa. They'd stepped into their roles as grandparents with a eagerness that stunned Draco and Harry. All three children were spoiled and doted on as often as Lucius and Narcissa could get away with it.
Draco allowed himself to be guided to the dining room, his mind still swirling with thoughts. He'd just gotten married. He was married and waiting for his baby to hatch from an egg. His wings fluttered behind him, brushing lightly against Harry's wings.
"I'll be alright," Ron insisted. "I'll pick the team myself. I may even drag Kingsley along." He smiled slightly. "You three are family and I'm here to make sure you stick around for a while. "Let me take care of you Harry," he added.
"He doesn't do it for recognition," Pansy snapped, glancing around cautiously. Luckily Honeydukes wasn't particularly busy at that moment. "He's trying to do some good. Not that it's any of your business," she added, glaring at Ron.
Lucius waved her off. "Potter cannot simply go about inserting his penis wherever he pleases," he said, ignoring his son's horrified blush, "and impregnating my son without taking responsibility."
"It's private!"
Harry's eyes widened in apprehension. This was the first he was hearing of the this. "Like who?" The sound of the doorbell made him flinch.
"There was a team of healers that didn't realize," Draco chided, relaxing against Harry with a sigh. "You can't hold yourself responsible for the actions of every lunatic." He pulled away to look Harry in the eye.
Ron sat in a chair in Kingsley's office with his face buried in his hands. Kingsley was sitting at his desk, eyeing Ron sympathetically. They hadn't spoken a single word since he'd invited Ron inside. They'd simply sat in tense silence, while Ron composed himself. After several minutes, Ron lifted his head to look at the Minister.
Once they had eaten their fill, they went into the sitting room for gifts. Draco had purchased gifts for the others, though they were stated to be from himself and Harry. Their guests had brought gifts for Draco and Harry as well. The Malfoys had given Harry a lovely cashmere jumper, a scarf and a warm cloak. Blaise had given him a wand holster with several clever enchantments embedded in it. Pansy's gift contained all of Harry's favorite sweets, and a broom repair kit.
Harry's burst of laughter warmed Ron's heart. Childish giggles filled the office and Draco squealed in delight when Ron's sneaky fingers gently prodded against his neck.
It wasn’t entirely true.  The treacle tart had been left out intentionally so that Draco could make a show of fetching it, and indicating that it had been for Harry’s benefit.  Pansy had said it was a stupid idea, but Draco was feeling quite pleased with himself.
"Of course," Draco smirked. "I happen to know for a fact that you taste even better than you look."
They ate in silence for a few minutes, each of them lost in thought. There had to be a way to get the information they needed to stop the dark rituals. They weren't willing to give up, especially since it was a threat on their lives.
"Except that I'm apparently a lunatic," Harry grumbled.
"It's alright," Ron told the toddlers. "She won't hurt you." He smiled as Harry relaxed slightly and allowed Draco to continue patting his leg. Ron reached out to Draco and tickled Draco's tummy, sending the boy into a fit of giggles. Then Ron reached for Harry, pausing when Harry covered his tummy with his hands warily. Ron moved back to Draco, chuckling when the blond laughed, squirmed and fell over. Draco sat back up excitedly. Ron looked at Harry again, delighted when the boy moved his hands, shyly offering his tummy for tickles.
"Do you know how hard it is to look that bastard in the eye?" Ron asked through clenched teeth. "Knowing that he tried to poison Harry and Draco. Knowing that he used a tracking spell to find their home. He tried to get through the wards." He swallowed hard. "I know I have to do this, but part of me just wants to use every barely legal curse I can think of."
Draco glanced at Harry again, the brunette engrossed in the love story. Draco could make that real for Harry. He wanted to. He felt like an idiot for not seeing the potential for more than friendship sooner. There was always the chance that Harry wouldn't want more, but... Best not think about that. The important thing was that Draco had feelings for Harry, and Draco wanted to give him the romance he deserved.
Harry returned a moment later, levitating a tray of tea things. Draco followed him, carrying a bundle of pale green blankets. He was also holding a bottle of milk.
"I like his hair," Draco replied with a grin and a wink at Harry.
She paused, looking distinctly uncomfortable. "There is also termination if you choose to go that route," she informed them. "I only need you to decide. I'll do everything in my power to make this easier for you. I'll give you a few moments. I need to get a few potions." She motioned for Ron to follow her, leaving the stunned couple alone.
"You know I hate crying," Draco sniffled.
Draco turned at the sound of his mother's voice and froze when he saw his father standing beside her, holding a package wrapped in silver paper. He hadn't seen his father since they'd had dinner together. The night Draco had conceived actually. Part of him was upset enough to let his father in on that bit of news, but he resisted. Instead, he held still while his father looked him over with wide eyes.
Harry's eyes widened in surprise. "Yes!" he blurted out. "Anything you want."
Harry laughed. "I do actually enjoy it, though I'm glad it's not as simplistic and ridiculous as you make it sound."
Hesitation, and then another head shake.
Harry gave Draco a pointed look and Draco sighed. "I do know, and... I appreciate your optimism," Draco said, his shoulders tense.
Draco froze at the sight of their living room. The furniture had been removed and replaced with simple white chairs. In place of the telly was a white arch covered in ivy and fairy lights. There were flowers everywhere. Their friends, the Weasleys and Draco's parents were all sitting in chairs while Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt stood under the arch.
HPDM~HPDM
Draco hesitated, biting his lower lip a bit shyly. "I sort of... enjoy being pregnant," he admitted, a light blush coloring his cheeks.
Draco chirruped softly before ducking his head and blushing. Harry smiled softly in response. Narcissa's eyebrows rose in surprise and confusion.
Harry nodded his agreement. He wasn't fond of the hospital, but he'd gone with Draco to visit the little girl several times since her step-father's arrest.
Harry froze, staring at Draco. Until that moment, Harry had been viewing the situation almost like Draco had an illness. Suddenly, Harry's world shifted and his breath caught in his throat.
"Bloody sap," Draco muttered, though he smiled slightly.
"It's poisoned," Harry blurted out unnecessarily, pulling Draco into his embrace. His green eyes darted to Ron's horrified expression. "Grant gave you that?" he demanded.
The others arrived a short time later, carrying gifts. They knew that it wouldn't be long, so they thought they'd celebrate with Harry and Draco.
"Please don't tell Hermione," Harry pleaded. "We just want to leave. I promise that I'll rest. I don't want to be mothered right now."
Hermione was weeping silently while Ron's mouth hung open in shock. Harry had been numb with shock through Draco's speech. When Draco turned to face the window again, Harry shook himself out of his stupor. His given name from Draco's lips had stirred a faint flutter in his chest. Ignoring Ron and Hermione for the moment, he approached Draco.
Pansy relented and seated herself at the table, allowing Harry to sit down as well. Narcissa was seated directly across from Harry. For the first several minutes, conversation was stilted and awkward. Lucius Malfoy said very little and only when spoke to, peering intently at Harry the entire time. This, of course, caused Draco to scowl at his father through most of breakfast.
It was a few weeks later that Pansy managed to ask what they'd all been wondering about the couple. Pansy was stunned when she realized that they'd not had sex. Pansy eyed Draco as he arranged some biscuits on a plate to go with their tea.
"Now that's impressive," Pansy said, looping her arm through Draco's and leading him back to the dining room.
"It's not an illness, Weasley," Draco said impatiently. "We're not sick. We're not completely human any more."
"I had some help," Harry said. "I contacted a magical jeweler by owl to special order the rings. Pansy and your mum planned the decorations and set up. Ginny, Ron and Molly handled the food. I had to get you upstairs at a specific time do they could set up quickly. There was a charm in our closet that alerted Hermione when I got our clothes out."
Draco frowned, hugging Harry carefully. "If that's what you need," Draco agreed. He glanced at Ron. "We appreciate your help."
"The potion did more than give us wings," Draco murmured. "One of the changes made it so that I could conceive... I produced an egg. It hatched last week."
"We wanted to," Ginny said. "This is a big deal."
"No greeting? No offer of tea?" Draco asked with raised eyebrows.
"I didn't realize I was," Harry responded sheepishly. "I was just thinking. About you," he added shyly at Draco's questioning look.
"Trying to get rid of me?" a voice whispered.
Draco carefully pulled the bottle away and handed it to Rita. He shifted James to rest upright against his shoulder before carefully removing the blanket. James had little wings that were now covered in fluffy down feathers protruding from openings in his little green shirt. They didn't look particularly useful, but Harry and Draco adored the sight of them.
"We don't usually have potions being tossed at us," Draco retorted, gratefully accepting a pain potion from Hermione. "We don't generally sustain serious injuries and we are excellent at what we do," he said, holding up his vial toward Harry, as if in a toast. Harry returned the gesture with his own pain potion.
Harry shuddered at the tight heat, loving all the desperate sounds Draco made. Harry had remained kneeling on his knees, one hand grasping Draco's hip while the other brushed gently over Draco's stomach. He rolled his hips slowly and carefully, panting softly while Draco moaned shamelessly. Harry's hand drifted to Draco's cock, stroking it languidly as his hips rolled into Draco. Draco pushed back into Harry's thrusts helpfully, his mouth trembling open on a shuddering sigh.
"We nearly died multiple times just because they're stupid?" Draco demanded in an angry hiss.
"Check the tin," Draco suggested.
"Where Daco?" Harry asked quietly, eyeing Draco uncertainly.
Pansy returned a moment later with her purchase. "All done," she said cheerfully. She looked over at Ron and Hermione. "So, what have you done with Potter?" she asked. "It's odd seeing you two without him."
This brought a bout of slightly hysterical laughter from some of his friends. Pansy moved to hug Draco. "Whatever happens, we're here for you," she murmured tearfully. "You're not alone."
"Can you stop being gay for a moment?" she blurted out, sighing when Harry and Ron burst into a fit if laughter, clearly overhearing her outburst. "I just need my best friend right now," she added, lowering her voice.
"We're going to follow Hermione's example," Harry said, looking pleased with himself.
"Mummy!" Daniel cried out, still held securely in Draco's arms. He pointed one chubby finger at Draco's face. "Daddy bad!"
Pansy giggled. "You've never told me... How good is the The Chosen One?" she asked with a smirk.
Draco's jaw went slack momentarily. It was always a bit surprising for Ron to compliment him. And Ron generally wouldn't comment on his appearance, especially since Harry was already very generous in his praise of Draco's looks.
Draco grasped the front of Harry's shirt and yanked him into a fervent kiss. Sure they were living together and loved each other. But, making plans to further expand their family... It made it all seem... bigger. More life altering. It was important and Draco had no idea how to express how much more deeply he'd fallen in love at that moment.
The prisoner blinked slowly. "At Harry Potter's house."
"Don't be stupid. Of course she'd consent," Draco snorted. "We're lucky she hasn't molested you in front of everyone. Not that she's whorish or anything," Draco added, catching Ron's expression of consternation.
Draco's breath caught in his throat and he stared at Harry in horror. "Maddie," Draco gasped, fear gripping him with icy fingers. "Is she- How-"
"Don't," Lucius snarled. "Don't make light of this. Our only son and heir is half bird and debasing himself with this..." He wiggled his fingers vaguely in Harry's direction, failing to think of something unflattering to call Harry.
Ron nodded slowly, eyeing Draco thoughtfully. "We're happy for you," he said after a moment of consideration.
"That's just to make you feel better," Ron said, relieved when Draco bit into a chip. "Dinner will be healthier."
"Indeed," Draco agreed tiredly.
Harry signed heavily, giving Draco an impatient look. He brushed his hands lightly over his nipples, his eyes widening a bit with the sensation. It was a surprisingly pleasant feeling. So very different from what he experienced with his own body. His own nipples simply weren't an erogenous zone for him. "That's bloody weird," Harry murmured.
Draco winked at him before turning his attention to Hermione and Pansy.  “What can I do for you?” he asked, as if he hadn’t been groping Harry a mere thirty seconds prior.
Draco sobbed and dropped to his knees, turning to cradle Harry's face in his hands. "Harry," he whimpered.
"Listen, I know Malfoy was having a hard time," Grant went on. "I've got this tea that my mum used to give me. Really calms the nerves and it tastes great. Would you pass it on? Tell them that I look forward to having them back?" he added, holding out a blue metal tin.
"Last week," Rita repeated thoughtfully, giving Draco a questioning look.
When they finally sat down for dinner, Draco bit his his lip and reluctantly summoned the miniature nest from the living room. Harry placed the nest on the empty chair next to Draco, smiling in encouragement. Draco hesitantly set the egg in the nest, and wrapped the warming blanket around it. He sat down in his own chair, biting his lower lip and looking like he'd like nothing better than to scoop the egg back up. "Why is this so hard?" he asked softly.
"Harry?"
Draco stilled and then pulled back to meet Harry's gaze. He opened his mouth, but no words came.
"When the time comes, I'm not leaving your side," Harry said firmly. "I'll need someone to get Hermione. And..." He shifted his weight from foot to foot. "I'm having trouble staying calm. I need to be strong for you, and having my best mate here might help."
When Ron and Hermione left, Harry suddenly felt rather nervous. He'd been alone with Draco many times, but it felt very different now.
“What are you doing all alone?” Harry asked.
Once Draco was fully sheathed he reached up to Harry's torso, urging him to sit up on his knees. "Pull your wings in so I can get closer," Draco instructed.
"Very," Draco confirmed, pulling Harry close for a kiss. He sighed as his tongue brushed Harry's, not caring in the slightest that they had an audience. He tilted his head, deepening the kiss slowly, relishing in Harry's quiet moan of pleasure.
"Listen Weasley... Take a few days off," Green urged lightly. "The rest of us will will cover your work load."
Draco began rubbing the baby down with the towel, his heart aching as the baby began to cry. He could see the little featherless wings protruding from the baby's shoulder blades. Draco made gentle cooing sounds, as he cleaned his son off. "My beautiful baby boy," Draco said softly, accepting a blanket from Hermione and deftly swaddling the infant.
Draco walked into find that Harry's bed was gone. Instead, there was a large nest. Draco could see at the base that it had been constructed out of sticks. There was sage green fabric draped over it and hugging the outer walls. Several pillows in a darker green were scattered inside the nest. Draco stepped closer and pressed against the fabric, finding that it was wonderfully soft and cushioned.
"Keep the egg warm while I get Draco closed up," Hermione said, not bothering to look up.
Warmth flooded Harry's chest at Draco's words. "Draco."
"Yes," Draco breathed. "More, Harry. Give me more!"
Female tongue-eating louse - female tongue-eating louse. This is a real thing, I kid you not. Look it up.
"Nobody really knows." Harry frowned, part of his brain dragging the knowledge from the older recesses of his memory while the larger part busily speculated on what really happened, since dragons
It was… hot. And tight. Exciting, and highly arousing. But also?
"So you are proposing we use the sacred ancient artefact of legends to call up Helga Hufflepuff from the grave in order to improve our grades?"
Embarrassing.
Hermione still seemed highly worried. He better say something to put her at ease…
"What."
It was a little gloomy in the library this late in the evening, but even so, Harry saw the colour quickly leave Neville's face. "N-nothing," he mumbled. "Nothing I would ever show to other people, anyway. No need to give away the fact I went illegally time-travelling, r-right?"
Finally, check out
"Yes," Hannah immediately confirmed. "Hard to forget, really. I have no idea how you came up with the idea that the earliest representatives of that class might have been fire resistant, but it makes so much sense if you consider -"
you?!" Harry was totally stumped. What on earth…?
While to my knowledge there is no species with poisonous armpits, there is, in fact, a type of lori that produces poison in its elbow. They apparently then take the poison in their mouths, rendering their bite deadly even for humans.
"Yeah, yeah, laugh it up," Harry griped. Then, more softly: "Come on, up you get." He helped Draco to his feet and they somewhat woozily each made their way down, like a couple of stoned terrible apes.
He thought he also could have done without Malfoy's bumbling attempts at distancing himself from his father's ideology, occasionally going so far as to try to understand muggle culture and society. What he hated most about it was that Malfoy wasn't doing it with the goal of true understanding, but more in a "we need to know how the underclass thinks" way. Malfoy didn't want to accept muggleborns into wizarding society, he just didn't want to be seen as ignorant.
"Agreed, then. We'll wait at least another couple of years."
Hannah blinked. "What do you…?"
"Look," Harry said, turning his back on the grazing diplodocus as though the fourteen ton behemoth were your average farm animal. "The history class at Hogwarts is obviously deficient, but surely your preschool -" Malfoy scoffed and Harry rolled his eyes - "right. Your
By the time he made it back to his starting point, weak, hungry, soaking wet and with a sore throat that made him virtually incapable of speaking, the better part of the day had passed. He found Harry and Malfoy in time to hear Malfoy's conclusion that the ritual would carry them back home in two weeks' time, but then was set upon by deadly insects and had to escape before he could make his presence known to his school mates.
Snorting in mild disbelief at Draco's irritating poise and his own ridiculous envy, Harry wiped his sticky left hand off on Draco's thigh.
Good, then.
All of the peculiar mating habits Draco names actually occur in nature. I mostly got them from Mara Grunbaum's hilarious book "WTF, Evolution?!" (German translation; I had to use wikipedia to get the English names for some of them. Wiki largely confirmed the weirdness about their genitals or mating habits). Here's who gets what:
When they weren't off hunting for roots and berries like the first humans or exploring another valley of their little mountain - where in the world had they ended up, anyway? This sure didn't look like the Scotland they knew. But then, Harry remembered that Eurasia had been one continent in earlier times, there was such a thing as plate tectonics and mountains grew out of the earth where plates collided; so it stood to reason that Scotland right now would look nothing like it did in their time, if it even existed.
"Ah, creationists. Right. So several rather prominent religious belief systems have ancient writings that document the creation of the earth by the One God. God created the sky, the earth, the sea, all the plants and animals and at the end of his
"Tergeo," Harry cast at Draco, then again at himself: "Tergeo."
The bushes to Harry's right rustled and the wind produced something like a relieved sigh in the leaves. Harry could relate. Silver linings and all that. In keeping with that thought, Harry reflected on the fact that while they may be stuck for two weeks in a time and place that featured two-legged predators that weighed up to a dozen tons and likely had an appetite to match, at least they still had their wands. He had the hallows, too. And they were past that awkward teenage phase where they were constantly trying to kill each other.
"Thanks for stating the obvious," Harry groused. "It's a fucking
"Well how did you think children were made?"
They both knew each other. And, odd though it might have seemed less than a year ago, Harry now knew that there was trust, and desire, and none of it was one-sided.
"Sorry." Malfoy's voice was strangely absent. "Just never thought I'd really get to see this."
Draco's breath hitched.
"...bloody brilliant," Harry finished. He delighted in seeing Draco's cheeks flush at the praise.
"Yes, sir," Harry said snappily and dropped down on top of Draco.
"You don't mean…!"
"I would happily teach you, if you like." Harry's train of thought didn't so much derail as it dissolved into a puff of sparkly dust. There was literally nothing going on behind his eyes while he gaped at Malfoy. Malfoy was staring back at him intensely. His cheeks looked flushed, but his grey eyes were clear and open.
Meanwhile, Harry would keep a look out. It wouldn't do to end up in the powerful jaws of a tyrannosaurus rex just when they figured out how to get back. He'd heard that some dinosaurs had masseters so powerful that over time, they tore a gap into the backs of their skulls. Not the t-rex, though: it could bite as hard as it wanted. The
“Fine,” he punctuated with Draco’s second freed boot flying over Ron’s shoulder and hitting the wall behind him with a thump and flop. If Harry wasn’t respecting Ron’s right to pout, he woulda laughed at the green tint that sickened Ron’s face as he had to peel off Draco’s soggy socks. With a little maneuvering, they got Draco’s trousers over his legs and his arms free of his shirt. Ron tossed the shirt near the boots and other discarded clothing and stalled out staring at Draco’s mostly nude form, “Wow, he’s got as many scars as us.” Prickly defensiveness spread over Harry’s body like a rash.
“I don’t know how to trust blindly. Why should I trust you?” He challenged with panic still tainting his defiant tone.
The edges of the window were fogged up from the temperature difference between the spring rain and the cozy indoors plus the steady stream of rain made viewing the grounds in front of him a little difficult. Not to mention that despite it being early afternoon, the outside was darker than the lit-up room. Even with all of these hindrances, Harry’s eyes locked in onto a man’s form lying sprawled out on the grass in the downpour rain. He was so thoroughly drenched that his silver-blonde hair was a dark grey. It should have made him indistinguishable from any other student, for it was his hair that made him stand out from a distance like this. However, Harry knew without a doubt that it was indeed his boyfriend laying in the rain like a bloody weirdo. What the hell was he doing?
. Harry waved Ron over to bring Draco to the tub.
Harry’s eyes shot back open. Hold up,
Harry barked out a laugh, “I don’t know how I’d feel touching naked people.”
“Cancer or have been poisoned or hexed or…”
Harry cleared his throat, “Never crossed my mind. To be honest, I was trying to figure out how to ask you
“Because I’m worried about you?” He offered, swinging his legs back and forth over the ledge.
When Malfoy was close enough to not project his voice and be heard, he growled, “I had intended to do this privately. But you returned all of my owls without reading them and every time I try to get you alone you slip away like a bloody coward. But I’m royally pissed off now and I refuse to feel guilty about you not finding out so here,” Malfoy slammed a blank white square of some sort of shiny paper onto the table next to Harry’s tray. The contents of the table rattled from the force of Malfoy’s anger. Malfoy sneered, “Bloody wanker,” and spun on his heel storming back out of the cafeteria from which he came.
Draco nodded, “Okay.” Draco’s tight grasp of Harry’s shirt relaxed as he opened his hands to flex and stretch his fingers and palm against Harry where his long arms have wrapped around him. Draco fell silent for a minute longer, but Harry didn’t stop his striations on Draco’s back just waiting for him to be ready. With a shuddering inhale, but a steady exhale, Draco began, “When I got home at the end of last year,
Harry clutched him tight and steadied them on his feet giving him a teasing grin, “Shush, sweetheart, it’s after curfew. You don’t want to alert anyone that we’re here.”
Harry shrugged his one-shoulder shrug again, “He said it was improbable which I’m assuming a good chunk of his wallowing was due to being wrong. He takes to being wrong about as well as Hermione does.” Ron dropped his hands and sighed before he kneeling beside the tub. Silently, he helped to hold Draco’s head up and block the soap and water from getting into Draco’s face while Harry scrubbed his hair with shampoo and rinsed it out. They ruminated in their own thoughts as Harry washed the grime off Draco and Ron kept him from falling over. Though most of Harry’s thoughts were on what might Ron be thinking of. He almost broke the silence twice to ask but he wanted out of the tub more so he forced himself to focus on the task at hand.  Once Draco was as clean as he was going to get, they drained the tub and Ron enlarged one of their towels to scoop Draco out of the tub in one giant bundle. Harry stood and dried himself off wrapping his towel around his waist before following Ron out of the bathroom where he dropped Draco onto his bed. “Thanks, Ron. I can take it from here.”
"Thank you, love." He pecked a kiss on her lips. "What I need to tell you now is… is why I know exactly that the ancient devil's snare did not mind fire."
"Liar," she chided him softly.
They both groaned.
Harry ducked out from underneath Malfoy's arm and lowered himself slowly to the grass. He felt he needed to be sitting right now, lest he faint in Malfoy's arms like a damsel in distress.
That was Harry's reason, anyway. And he really wanted to presume it was Malfoy's, too.
"Uh-huh," Harry made, unconvinced.
"Crea- what?" Malfoy was frowning now, too, but Harry thought it was just because he was trying to figure out if Harry was insulting him, and not because he knew that yes, yes Harry was.
"Oh, Neville…" Hannah was out of her seat and in Neville's lap in no time, hugging and kissing him and trying to comfort her love who was so obviously struggling with what he had done. "No wonder you never told me about this before, you must be all torn up about using those!"
But Harry had no intention to rush this. Taking his time, he slowly slid his hands all the way up Draco's thighs, until his fingers barely brushed against Draco's balls. A whimper rewarded the contact. But Harry did not linger there. Instead, he trailed the tips of his fingers along the crease between Draco's thighs and his pelvis, eliciting more whimpers and a heated glare.
Snuggling into Neville's chest, Hannah softly said: "Tell me."
"She's an outlier."
Horclumps - balanidae
The fire in Draco's eyes immediately burned hotter. "Yessss…," he hissed.
For all they knew, they might have ended up swimming in the middle of a freezing ocean. Harry was kind of grateful to fate and magic that that hadn't happened.
"Really?! Where was I when this happened?"
"Whom did you meet?" Hannah was now sitting tensely on the edge of her seat. Neville, however, leaned back in his chair in a tired slump.
"Nah."
Hannah ceded the point, whistling. "Neville, wow. You met Hufflepuff herself?"
Holding up his now glass-free hand, Neville grinned at Hannah's embarrassed flush. He'd known he had found the right partner the first time they nerded out over the sensuality of a mimbulus mimbletonia's crooning sounds.
"Did them."
"Harry and Malfoy created a ritual to travel back to the founders' time to ask Helga Hufflepuff herself about her formula."
There you have it, the end. Except not quite. Because Susnake wanted to know why Neville hadn't made himself known to Draco and Harry even though chances of survival would have been much higher together. If you'd also like to know, read on. The next chapter should be out tomorrow. It's a bit mean, though. ; )
Hannah's body tensed in his arms at the words. Her head rose and Neville saw a lovely blush on her cheeks. "I would have noticed."
Harry blinked, and suddenly Draco wasn't sitting beside him any more, but standing in front of Neville, the Gryffindor now half-hanging in the air by Draco's fist around his tie. "Tell me," Draco hissed. Harry could barely make it out, his voice was so low. He appreciated that; they seemed to be alone in the library, but apparently he'd been wrong about that before.
Murtlap - yellow-footed antechinus
Hannah had been by his side through most of seventh year. She knew he still had nightmares, about the war, about Uncle Algie, and - to his quiet shame - about Snape, even still. He wanted there to be no secrets between them. But there was that one thing…
Right.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry squeaked indignantly. "Malfoy!"
But gods, was it ever surreal to see him quizzing Ron about the uses of a joystick!
Harry turned around. "Neville? What makes you say that?"
That… did actually explain it.
"Soo… You want to just lie down in the grass?" Harry asked. He surveyed the plants around their retreat-tree with a critical eye. From personal experience this past week, he knew most of it was fairly soft, but he'd gotten the impression Draco didn't think so.
They had no clue if the fish was at all edible, and one might have assumed that the man trying it first should get the bezoar in case he needed to fight food poisoning in a hurry. Instead, though, Harry charged ahead with true Gryffindor abandon, while Malfoy kept their means of salvation to himself, not trusting the other to take the remedy only in dire need.
Malfoy sat down in the grass next to Harry, leaning back against the same tree trunk. Their shoulders brushed. It felt really nice. "So you've actually never had sex?" Malfoy tried to make it sound casual, but he was too obviously invested in the answer to manage.
Malfoy's blush deepened. Harry crowed in delight. "Malfoy, you're terrible!"
Neville sighed. "Yes, wow. It would have been amazing." He frowned. "It
"What about your grandmother?" Harry asked.
"I don't think I can face a whole waiting room right now," Harry admitted.
"Luna has never been wrong," Neville reminded. "She was right about Scorpius. She was right about Rose," he added, nodding to wear Molly was holding Blaise and Ginny's new baby.
Harry nearly withdrew when he heard the floo activate, but he knew it was likely Hermione. When she stepped through the floo, Draco jumped and shifted to step away from Harry. Harry stopped him with a chirp and tapped his fingers against the top of Draco's wing.
"I'd take all three of them if you'll let me," Draco replied.
Pansy arrived next, coming to an abrupt halt when she saw Harry and Draco. "You poor dears!" she cried, launching herself at Draco for a hug while carefully avoiding his wings. "I heard that your transformation was ghastly. Are you terribly uncomfortable?" She pulled back to look Draco over.
Harry eyed him with concern, but decided not to push it. Surely his father's rejection was quite painful for Draco. Not having support from some of the most important people in your life could make a difficult situation feel worse. So, Harry would be supportive. He could do that for Draco.
"It was hot," Pansy declared. When Ron glared at her she backtracked. "Completely inappropriate. I was thoroughly disgusted." As soon as Room looked away again she fanned her face with her hand. Draco covered his mouth his suppress his laughter.
"I always look out for Draco," Harry said, landing next to Pansy. "I wouldn't let him get hurt."
"Well... I'd need her consent obviously," he stammered, flustered. He shot Harry a dirty look for laughing.
Draco nodded his thanks. This was just awkward and he really wanted to leave. Of course, Pansy had other ideas.
A moment later, Draco walked in carrying a variety of shopping bags. "Pansy, what in Merlin's name is taking so long?" he asked impatiently. He blinked in surprise when he realized she was standing with Ron and Hermione.
There was a knock at the door and Harry moved to answer it. He waved Ron and Rita inside. "I was beginning to wonder if you planned to keep our bargain," Rita commented.
Autumn went by in a flurry of activity. Harry and Draco made frequent trips out, always carefully guarded by their friends or a few Aurors. Ron had become increasingly frustrated as more reports came in about dark rituals, but he could never catch up with the wizards responsible.
"You two will be great parents," Ron commented, setting two eggrolls on Draco's plate before loading his own plate with good.
Hermione cast a few spells, humming to herself. Draco remained perfectly still, glad that she was willing to check him over so thoroughly each day. After a moment she smiled. "The baby is fine," she announced. She grinned at Draco's relieved expression and then prepared some tea.
"I think it was sort of sexy," Draco murmured. "You just want me all to yourself." He leaned in and pressed little kisses along Harry's jaw.
"Maybe they were bored," Harry shrugged. "Blaise thought that the fact that the twins call me 'mummy' was indication that I preferred to be... submissive."
"Ron!" Ginny snapped impatiently, glaring at him.
"You're flying!"
Draco stumbled upon landing but kept himself upright. He was immediately pulled into his mother's arms. "You could have broken your neck," she scolded.
"I like the sound of that," Draco said quietly. He leaned close and pressed soft moist kisses down Harry's neck.
"We are," Draco assured her. "I apologize for losing my temper."
Harry glanced at Draco. "Draco's staying here for now. As long as he wants," he added firmly. "Hermione's helping us find suitable furniture. We might need a bit of help once we start going out in public again."
Draco shook his head no, rubbing his face more into the soft knit, and mumbled, “Defeats the name, if I did.” His pillow rumbled with more chuckles and kissed the top of his head. Warm arms wrapped around him and held him close. Soft trails of fingers left paths of fuzzy happiness over his back leading him back to a peaceful sleep. Just as he was about to pass back over into unconsciousness, Draco had an errant thought of responsibility. It was too bright for just waking up on a Monday. “Don’t we have class?” he inquired with a gentle murmur.
“And why would I like that, Potter?” Draco sneered.
Harry snorted, “Sure thing, Princess.” Draco would roll his eyes if he could open them, he’d just have to settle for a delayed glare after Harry was through wiping his eyes clear. “This stuff isn’t toxic right? Do we need to get you to Madam Pomfrey?” Harry continued to wipe away the rivets off Draco’s face and around his lips. Harry’s brows were furrowed in concentration, the downtick on his lips telling Draco that despite his inability to walk away from a chance to laugh at him he was genuinely concerned for his safety.
His grin was sure to match the one he imagined on Harry’s face as Harry leaned in to rumbled into Draco’s ear, “I could think of a few.” Harry placed a few kisses against Draco’s jugular under his ear and Draco nearly purred. He rubbed his hands up and down the soft-covered arms blocking him in.
“That you could.” Draco thought of all the days he spent with his parents studying his family’s genealogy and history. He could tell Harry every little detail of his lineage on both of his parent’s sides including knowing the names and marriages of all of his extended family out 6 degrees and 3 removed. And Harry didn’t even know he had an accomplished grandfather. He wondered if he could get his hands on Harry’s family tree. He wasn’t sure if he could get his mother’s info but the Potter’s were an influential pureblood family. There were bound to be records of it somewhere. He felt Harry twist his hair up and lock it against his scalp with the comb. He felt the scrub of the towel rub against the back of his neck, he had to tighten his core to prevent it from being pushed into the water as Harry scrubbed harder into his skin, trying to budge the drying grime. Draco finally kicked into scrubbing his hands, wrists, neck, and face free of the gunk, once again enjoying the deep massage of Harry’s touch. “Or you could go into massage therapy,” Draco sighed, “You have the hands of a god, Harry. Sure, at first you’d have a lineup of people just wanting to be naked and alone with the Golden Boy touching them but then the line will just as long as soon as they all realize that it’s your god-like hands that are golden.”
"Of course," Harry agreed when Pansy hesitated. "We're glad to have you."
"Oh my god..." Ron giggled weakly, sinking to the floor.
Their friends weren't surprised by their change in relationship status. They were amused by Harry's changed behavior. Before, he'd been a little confused and nervous, though accepting, of Draco's advances. Now Harry doted on Draco enthusiastically. Draco was treated to breakfast in bed, foot rubs, back massages and chocolates. Draco basked in Harry's adoration, happily returning the affection.
Harry winced. "You think I'm mental," he said dully.
After a late breakfast, they worked together to get ready for movie night. Only Ron and Hermione had seen their wings and they were feeling a little apprehensive about being with the whole group. They tidied the living room and planned what dinner would be. The original plan had been for roasted chicken, but the thought of eating any kind of bird made them queasy. So Harry decided that steaks would be a better option.
"We found another ritual site," Ron said, entering the office and dropping into a chair near Harry's desk.
"Harry?" Draco asked. His stomach was twisting with growing excitement and nerves.
"I'm fine," Draco replied, glancing over his shoulder to make sure they were still alone. "It's just... too much. You know? Too many people, too much noise, too many hands touching my wings." He huffed in frustration. "You know I've never really objected to being the center of attention, but it was so hard to stay in my seat during dinner. The impulse to escape was rather strong."
"What's wrong?" Harry asked.
"Maybe it'll be a girl," Draco said hopefully. He knew that Harry had wanted a daughter.
Harry smiled and cast a few spells to clean up the mess they'd made. Once they were no longer sticky, he turned Draco so they were laying on their sides, face to face and they drifted to sleep.
Rita stood up, her eyes wide with shock. She approached Draco slowly, trying to appear as non-threatening as possible. She spotted the dark hair first. And then the baby's eyes opened and she could see the bluish gray of his irises as he continued to drink from the bottle. "A perfectly beautiful baby," she noted, her voice hushed in her amazement.
"To make a amends," Draco replied without hesitation. He smiled slightly at Harry's startled expression. "I've spend my time since the war re-defining myself. I'm not who I was when we were in school. Not entirely anyway," he added with a smirk. He hesitated, his expression growing more somber. "I wanted to take the opportunity to apologize to you and make up for my mistakes. Christmas seems like a great time for that sort of thing."
A month after the de-aging incident, Draco and Harry found themselves in another bizarre predicament. In Harry's defense, the potion was slipped into their coffee while Harry's back was turned. But Draco still chose to blame Harry at that moment. Surely no good could come from allowing Harry to make coffee for the both of them so early in the morning.
"Are you serious?" Draco asked incredulously. "Bird puns right now?" He couldn't be too annoyed though; Ron's ridiculous joke had made Harry chuckle.
"Why?" Draco asked, his eyes on the blue tin. "Why would he try to kill us?"
"So you don't know what to expect," Harry said flatly.
"Oh good," Draco chuckled. "Then sit on your knees right here." He patted a spot next to him, shifting to lay on his side.
"I don't see why not," Hermione responded. "Just be careful."
Harry's eyelids were drooping. "S-So cold," he stuttered, his body trembling.
Harry's aggressive stance was dropped an instant later, his wings dropping and his face mortified. "I- I'm so sorry," he stammered, horrified by his reaction. He'd felt a bit off all day, but he hadn't thought that he'd behave so terribly. Something had just... come over him.
Ron and Ginny arrived next, followed by Neville, Luna and Blaise. There was a lot of fuss over the wings before Harry could convince everyone to sit at the table.
For a moment, Draco stood still, breathing through a mild wave of dizziness. Then he opened his eyes and looked at Harry.
Harry pulled him down the hall to one of the unused guest rooms. Harry pushed the door open and led Draco inside. Hermione was close behind, peering past them curiously.
"Tramatized maybe," Ron put in helpfully.
They turned and spotted Draco Malfoy kneeling on the floor of St. Mungo's pediatric ward. A little girl that appeared to be around four years old was clutching a new doll to her chest and smiling joyfully at Draco. She had long, dark brown hair that was hanging in loose curls down her back. Her clear blue eyes focused intently on Draco's face.
"Rough night," Harry said, not making eye contact.
Harry paused. "Me and you? Or the idea of two men shagging in a giant bird nest?" Harry questioned with a snort, nibbling Draco's earlobe.
Before Ron could scoop Harry up again, Draco wiggled his way closer to Harry and patted Harry's leg. "'Kay," Draco said softly. He reached up to pet Harry's hair earning a watery smile from Harry. "Habby!" Draco cheered, clapping his hands.
The only truly awkward moment came when Molly wanted to hold the egg. She'd reached toward Ron for it and Ron instantly shifted away as Draco let out a trill of sudden panic. Molly raised her hands in a show of surrender, her eyes wide.
They slammed through the door with a spell and ran into the house ready to attack. They found Harry and Draco facing off against six wizards. Their wings were spread wide and they had assumed dueling positions, carefully blocking the stairway. They looked exhausted. Harry had one arm wrapped around his own torso.
"They're potatoes," Draco mumbled around a mouthful, pulling the container out of her reach. Harry kissed his temple, chuckling.
Draco's wings fluttered in agitation. Harry's wings flared out briefly as he made a short cooing sound. Kingsley had no idea what that meant, but Draco seemed to understand. His fluttering ceased and he brought his right wing forward, carefully smoothing down his feathers. Harry chirped once in apparent approval of Draco's self-soothing method. Draco's chirped reply sounded a little sulky. Or it was all Kingsley's imagination.
It was only a few moments and hadn't been the worst pain that Harry had ever felt. But it was certainly unpleasant. Someone in the potions division had played a prank.
Harry swept Draco into his arms without a second thought, hurrying up the stairs and to their bedroom. Draco rested on his side, shivering violently as his hands rubbed at the front of his stomach gently.
On Christmas morning, Harry woke to find Draco cuddled up against him. The blond had his head pillowed on Harry's shoulder and he had slipped one hand under Harry's shirt to rest on Harry's stomach.
Draco rolled his eyes. "It's not as if we do that in public," he retorted. "Harry's yard is warded to prevent prying eyes and intruders. Not that we have reason to feel shame. It's perfectly natural." At least he thought it was. They didn't exactly have any examples to follow. Hermione hadn't found any books on human/bird hybrid etiquette, so they assumed that such a text didn't exist. So, they did what seemed appropriate to them. Lucius didn't need to know that they were making it up as they went along though.
Ron nodded sullenly. He could do this. He had to do this. It would only be a matter of time before he'd get the case closed. He had to believe that. He bid Kingsley a good night and left the Ministry in a hurry.
Pansy sighed and shook her head. "You two have wretched luck," she commented. "You could have been killed."
"Please," Draco scoffed. "I think he was, perhaps, a little intimidated. But, I don't think it's going to run him off." He gave her a questioning look. "Did you give him a blow job?"
"These aren't for him, and I'm doing him a favor," Pansy hissed with a scowl. She relaxed a little when Hermione have him a sharp poke in the side and a disapproving look. "Draco is quite a philanthropist these days. He's always donating money, visiting the hospitals..." She frowned slightly. "Of course, that's not common knowledge."
Draco snorted in disbelief. "Nevermind. She's got brilliant timing," he said, rolling his eyes.
"Do Draco first," Pansy said. "He'll be insufferable if he finds out that we left him as a toddler for longer than necessary."
Harry chuckled, kissing Draco's temple. "We'll have the most loved baby in England," he murmured.
