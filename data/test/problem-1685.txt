“Right.”
“Ha. Neither.” Harry slumped into a seat at his kitchen table, laying his head down on top of his arm. The table was sticky. As was the inside of Harry’s mouth.
“I know. Look after your sister.”
Dear Harry,
“Mr. Harry Potter is feeling calmer now?” The high, whistling voice at his elbow belonged to a House-elf. A familiar one.
“Only sometimes.”
It isn’t his wife. His Ginny.
She was also Neville’s girlfriend. Lucky Nev.
“You want to ask me about the interview,” Flora said in a low voice, coming up on Harry’s childless side.
. She’s crawling all over Gryffindor Tower, and flying all ‘round the pitch, and I—I can’t—”
And so, once in a while, Harry thought about Time Turners, about how very unavoidable the past had to be. Ginny and James went flying in dodgy weather. Harry watched from the ground, because he forgot his wand on the hall table. Lily at the Bulstrode’s restaurant. Albus at home in a strop. Snow, and wind, and wandless magic.
“If you don’t want to go, why do you keep doing it?”
Parkinson’s eyes narrowed. Harry could almost
, all right.” Harry huffed a sigh, clenched a hand in his hair. “I know. I’m sorry.”
“I think—” She cleared her throat. “The jinx is good. It will hold. It’s up to you, Harry.”
“Clearly.”
he read.
Flora and Millicent had realized something was wrong. They stepped in front of Harry, forming a line with Luna and the chattering kids. Closed ranks. Hermione returned so quickly with James that Harry wondered if she Apparated them both.
The letters kept coming. Neville Longbottom. Katie Bell. Dean Thomas. Hannah Abbott. Oliver Wood. Hagrid. Nearly six months in, the first letter arrived for a Weasley—addressed to Bill. Nobody knew what to think. Then another came, this time for Molly. For Arthur. A letter to Fleur. One came for George, but he never read it. Harry’d been there when the parchment went up in a curl of white smoke.
“Because Al doesn’t want people to know he’s worried about James,” Rose answered in an equally low voice. Al made an affronted squeak.
Harry paused in the middle of buttoning his coat. “I know. I love you, too.”
Harry shrugged. “We couldn’t keep it trimmed for years after that. Mine used to do the same thing, when I was young.”
“Not too much,” Harry blushed, gulping tea.
“What did you do?” Harry wondered, caught up in Flora’s story.
He grimaced. “You think she’s homesick?”
“You already made that joke.”
“Felicity is a perfectly capable brewer,” Malfoy went on. “I’m here for my expertise in combining Muggle and Magical remedies, as you
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was going to be a madhouse.
Thanks for writing back. I hope your week has improved, now that Ron’s back at work. Although, considering we lost the Broom-Race Finals to India
Harry glanced at McGonagall and said, “I don’t think so. What did she help you do?”
“No, really! Are you visiting Nev—erm, Professor Longbottom?”
Teddy went wide-eyed. The neon color leached from his eyebrows and hair. “Harry?”
“Merlin’s pants, it was only hair, and it looked like a dog’s breakfast all the time.”
Lily dragged Flora and Millie’s daughter out of the kitchens with the same method she’d applied to Scorpius and Al. Artie allowed this for two or three steps before pinching Lily on the palm of the hand.
Harry sat up with a growl. “I’ve got no problem with Veela!”
“Yes, well, you
at all, but a kind of serpent-specific Legilimency. Something to do with the inner ear.
“Yes, Mum.”
Harry got out a quill and a stack of personalized parchment. The parchment was silly, stamped with Harry’s full name and the phrase ‘The Dad Who Gived.’ It was a long-ago Father’s Day present from Lily, and Harry rationed it carefully for years out of sentiment. This seemed like a time which called for sentiment.
“Draco always gives back as good as he gets,” Harry replies, and he can’t help the little bit of pride that sneaks into his voice. He’s always liked that about Draco—his ability to take the hit, and come back harder. Draco fights back. It’s not the
Draco’s.”
She quirked a nervous smile. “You think so?”
“You could…” She cleared her throat, and it made a little hiccup sound. She did that when was censoring herself—she did it a lot when George started complaining about ‘unfair Ministry regulations.’ She also did it when her desire to explain
But Teddy shrugged, looking down at the letters again. “We broke up again last week.”
them!”
The shower was too hot, his head too fuzzy. He scrubbed up quickly, trying to wash himself awake. It didn’t help. With a resigned sigh, Harry toweled off and pulled a small glass vial from the top shelf of the medicine cabinet.
“Hmm. I do like leeks, but I also feel like something sweet. I suppose blackberry and apple wouldn’t be particularly filling?”
The receptionist needed to be Auror-trained to manage the lot. Something-or-other Morris (Harry
He wondered how a child like James managed, back then. If they got to come to Hogwarts at all.
He couldn’t help himself. He didn’t want to think about his friends—his family—at the Malfoy dinner table. He didn’t want to wonder if they talked about Hogwarts, about Lucius, about the war. He didn’t want to think about it because he didn’t want to
Harry snorted. “I can’t believe Hermione let you leave right before Hogwarts this year. You get to avoid the tearful send-off.”
“Can I show you my room? And Artie’s cat?”
“Powdered unicorn horn in the Grand Wiggenweld Potion,” he rasped, without looking up from his phone. “It reacts too much like sodium bicarbonate. Can’t risk it.”
part-Veela.”
Al grunted his agreement, and tried to hop onto his own stool with dignity.
“Yeah. It sounds like it’s going to be brilliant.”
Sol inclined his head. “Especially James. We had an action plan. James and Albus had scheduled counseling sessions yesterday. Did they go?”
“The Wizarding World’s most eligible bachelor,” Hermione said. She finished her toast in two crisp bites.
“Dad?” Lily said, tugging at his hand. “Artie just got here.” Harry glanced toward the platform entrance. It was easy to pick out Millicent Bulstrode carrying a large cat in a blue plastic crate.
Harry snorted. “Oh, yeah, mate. Definitely. But keep an eye out, anyway.”
“Ron’s the strategist,” she argued, but she looked pleased as she crunched her toast.
“Private, classified, whatever.” The woman waved a hand, then pinned Harry with a look. “Yes to the sandwiches. No to the bribery.
Dumbledore looked over his spectacles, eyebrows up. “The last time you looked in the Mirror of Erised, Harry, you saw a way to keep on living. Forgive me, but… I rather thought you might need the opportunity again.”
“As you wish,” she nodded and popped. “I’ll prepare the guest rooms. Do endeavor to hurry, Harry. I don’t think the anticipation is doing anyone much good.”
like Hermione, or try to crack jokes like Gin. She’s sly. She waits. She lets the tension build up under Harry’s surface until it explodes, cracking him wide open.
Harry’s side of the table went very still. Hermione’s quill hovered in midair.
“Mulpepper’s?”
“Possible.”
NOW, I’m coming through!”
“That’s fine. Just let me check in with her quickly, as soon as I’ve found Uncle George.”
Harry’s good mood vanished. “Right. James. I’m so sorry—”
Malfoy paused. “What?”
she said, hugging herself even tighter. “Not his father. Not the Dark Lord himself.”
, we took Scorpius Malfoy with us the last time. You can’t get a kid more Magical than that one. You should’ve seen him! Hoovering up meat pies like he’d never eaten before in his life! And babbling, of course, about everyone and everything. I had to Muffliato our whole group.” He sighed happily. “It was mad. Scorpius is a bit mad, though, eh?”
Sol did this sort of thing a lot: Asking Harry questions he must know the answer to already. They’d been over the particulars of Harry’s brutal childhood. They’d beaten that thestral into the ground.
“I’m sorry,” he repeated. Winky hummed an exasperated sound.
Albus and Scorpius were extremely talkative, but also extremely secretive, which meant Harry had to pretend not to listen in as they dissected every possible outcome of the next year’s Hogwarts schedule. Scorpius had special permission to visit Hogsmeade on occasion, since his family lived on the outskirts, and Albus was finally old enough to visit, too.
The invisibility cloak crafted by Death Himself was in perfect condition, but it was a pain in the arse to use. Harry only stood 168cm tall; he still had to crouch a little to keep the hem on the floor. Obviously, Iggy Peverell had passed along his short stature to his descendants.
“The longest.”
Lily—his daughter, his baby—hadn’t stopped holding Harry’s hand.
“Hello, Scorpius,” Harry sighed. “Nice to see you. What’s this about snargaluffs?”
Teddy looked vaguely horrified. “The smiling. An’ the chubby elbows.”
“I think you should go,” Dumbledore told him, but kindly.
Ron’s eyes narrowed. “You’ve already forgiven her. That’s what you said.”
Harry’s brow furrowed. “I wanted something to celebrate.”
“Then why did
“Ha. True.”
Harry scratched his head. “Ish.”
He kept picturing Angelina’s laugh. Fleur’s rolling eyes. That tiny, tucked-up smile of Hermione’s.
Harry choked a little, and scowled at her when she started to laugh. The strange, quiet ginger cadet with freckles had been renamed The Collector. Harry had never been more embarrassed than when he ordered the raid on her little flat in Diagon. The search team was endlessly amused by The Collector’s assortment of shed hair and used tea cups. He might never live that one down.
“Um, thanks?” Scorpius flushed. “Still, it’d be fun to change it up, now and again, don’t you think?”
“‘S not your fault, mate. James should know better.”
“Oh, I think so. Don’t you?”
“You’ve been working with him, yeah?” Angie asked. “Have you seen him in the last month?”
The only letter Harry actually read was to Ron. It was long-winded, eloquent, but so aggressively civil that it made for difficult reading. It contained the words
Harry grinned. “Thank god for lesbians and Slytherins. If you or Flint were susceptible to this Savior nonsense, I’d really be on the broom without a wand.”
Love you  ♥♥♥  Lily
“What?!” Hermione screeched.
, Harry thought.
Parkinson’s eyes widened. “Pimples?”
The voice drove Ginny right out of his head, and Harry wanted—abruptly—to cry.
Harry went still. He had to try very, very hard not to frown. “That sounds… practical.”
“I need new friends,” Harry muttered.
Harry opened his eyes, sitting upright. “Right. Good. About the week after, though.”
The feeling knocked Harry off-balance enough to stumble.
“How many meals have you skipped?”
Harry’s step stuttered. “He put someone in hospital?”
He bit down on his tongue. Lily was oblivious, which helped, but this just wasn’t what Harry had expected.
“I suppose.”
Harry was trying hard not to think about
“When Draco disappoints them,” she says, nearly whispering. And then Harry can see it, like a queue at Flourish and Blott’s—all the people Draco has disappointed. All the ones who walked away. Goyle and Flint and Crabbe. The Greengrass girls. Slughorn, and even Snape. Lucius, the complete tosser, and Narcissa, too, in every way that matters.
Harry pursed his lips, wrinkled his nose. “You’re consulting

(his memory Charms were legendary), and Ella Flint was indispensible in all areas of
Got the chocolate frogs. Thanks.
“Prosecutorial?” Flora said.
Harry swallowed. “Crabbe cast the Fiendfyre.”
“Do you want me to come by?” Harry offered.
That startles Harry, and he glances back. “What? No he isn’t!”
“I hate you.”
“Ron has,” Angie frowned. “George says he sees him all the time.”
my family doesn’t approve,
“Poor Scorpius,” Hermione said again, with a firm rub of her stomach. “Do you suppose Albus knows?”
Harry frowns. “What—what do you mean? What did she say to Draco?”
“A bit.”
But McGongall shook her head. “No, Potter. This calls for a potioneer.”
“You’re all mad,” Harry declared. “Why was the devil’s snare still under that corridor? Why is the Mirror even here? This is a
, Dad—”
“None of us knew Draco weren't on the side of No-Nose, 'fore that," Millie said. "Not even Pansy."
The first of September fell on a Sunday this year. Families, which might normally drive or Floo into King’s Cross Station on the first, would make a weekend of it. A little sightseeing in Muggle London, a little shopping in Diagon Alley, a chance to visit Gringotts or the Ministry or the secret Wizarding section of the London Zoo.
“That’s true enough.” Neville smiled. “You and Ron weren’t exactly well-behaved, if I remember correctly.”
The silence felt strange and echoing behind her. Harry couldn’t decide what he wanted ‘a consult’ with Draco Malfoy to mean. It took a few deep breaths before Harry regained his equilibrium enough to say, “That’s Professor Tugwood?”
“I—Yeah.”
Yours Sincerely, Al
“We found a spell in the library. The Spindle Curse.”
“Ron will kill me for watching without him…”
“Do lines work on Victoire? She doesn’t seem the type.”
“I took a
Hermione sighed, sinking back in her chair. “When Draco and Astoria got engaged, there was a—well, a—”
With the other eye, Harry watched the group surrounding Albus. Malfoy had a hand on Scorpius’s shoulder, and a frown on his pale, pointed face. Harry tried to remember the last time he’d seen Draco Malfoy actually smile. It had to be before sixth year at Hogwarts, so… 23 years? Bloody hell.
Hermione forgot about the washing in the middle again, so I've got to air everything out and run it over. You'd think I'd be used to pregnancy brain by now, but it still surprises me when she gets scattered like this.
“Have you told Ron?”
“Ah, well,” Ron smiled, “we might’ve talked about it. A bit.”
Malfoy ran a hand though his hair, and sighed. “I always thought you were rather thick, in school, but I’d convinced myself that was youthful jealousy.”
, and Harry can’t make himself say it. He didn’t before, and then he touched someone else’s naked body, and now… Saying the word is admitting to all the ways Harry isn’t worthy. Not anymore.
It was the longest conversation he and Malfoy had ever had, alone, as adults. And it wasn’t… awful. It was interesting, really. Malfoy liked to lecture, but Harry was used to that; he had Hermione Granger-Weasley for a best friend. There was far less arguing than he might've expected, and more candor.
“Why would that be bad, Harry?”
“Malfoy,” he snapped in greeting.
it. If you know what I mean.”
“James admitted to using the Spindle Curse to protect his belongings,” McGonagall informed her.
“Give some thought to expanding James’s treatment. I will think about better ways to facilitate his education here.”
“No one actually uses that term,” she griped, mouth full of bobby pins. “That’s just an internet thing.”
“Yes. Millie’s right, please ask,” Flora offered. She sounded steadier now, and her eyes were strong. “A second-year Ravenclaw died in that basement. Falling debris. She was only twelve.”
“I see,” she nodded. He thought she probably did.
“I’m tired,” he told Hermione. “I’m going home to bed.”
“Ah, yes. Sadly, Spinnet’s got the troll situation well in hand. How on earth will you meet new people without the threat of imminent demise?”
“He’ll never be able to. Not ever again. No wizard in Europe would risk your wrath.”
Cheers, Dean
“Well,” he managed, “I s’pose not.”
Neville says we’re supposed to prune the devil’s snare this year. I can’t climb the ladders so I’m going to do something with wiggentree. Whatever. It’s fine.
but it isn’t anything serious. Her joints ache, she sleeps poorly, I’m never home enough anymore. Healers say she’s comfortable, most of the time. I’m considering piercing my tongue, just to give her new material to work with.”
“Desertion! Defecation!”
Books are bigger than their authors, bigger than words on a page. Books are portals. Books are treasure maps. Books are Rorschach inkblots, and they only have meaning because YOU do. The reader is the point. Your imagination, your passion, your big, beautiful heart... that's the point. So fuck The Author. She doesn't deserve you anymore.
,” Harry shot back. “And my kids are your slave labor.”
“Ah,” Sol breathed, leaning back again.
“Tell that to your husband.”
That stopped Spinnet’s giggling. “No. Come on, Potter—”
“You don’t mean—” Harry goggled, with a twist in his gut. “Not Malfoy?”
“Can I have a Galleon for the trolley, Dad?”
Had he never thought to worry whether Montague recovered, in the end?
A bottle shattered, loud and sharp as a TV gunshot.
At the top, McGonagall led the way through her office door, into the tower-top sanctum that had once belonged to Snape, and to Dumbledore, and to generations of powerful witches and wizards. Most of the portrait frames were occupied, but all were silent.
“I truly hope you’re able to forgive one another,” Pansy says as they return to the front hall. Harry’s jaw clenches. “The pair of you—it makes sense. I still don’t really know why.”
“In that case,” Hermione said, a bit awkwardly, “I thought we could begin with fifth year at Hogwarts.”
“It’s not like you, you know,” she told him, in a tone of voice that had once made Snape call her an insufferable know-it-all. “You don’t just let things lie. You don’t ignore the things that really bother you, and you don’t speculate endlessly for years about questions with readily available answers.” Hermione was on a roll, now, clipping every consonant until her speech sounded like a snare drum. “You have always sought answers, Harry. That’s who you are! But there’s a big ‘no fly zone’ over Draco Malfoy, and we’re all used to veering around him like an active volcano. It’s not—” She cut herself off. Harry’s ears were ringing, faintly.
“Really,” Harry laughed. “Kind of a custard color.”
“You’re drunk.”
“She complains
“A bit star-struck?” Harry said. “She has been collecting my fan mail, Spinnet.”
“Harry Potter is not having his wand.” She eyed him with elvish suspicion. (He was quite familiar with that look.) “Would his wand stop the shaking?”
“We had no idea what was going on,” Hestia said. “We were cut off from news. We couldn’t even hear the battle from that far below, and the castle's defensive magic interfered with our own.”
Nobody should be shouting but, if there was shouting to be done, it should not happen in his sitting room. Harry made a sound he was very glad nobody could hear. He peeled himself free of the duvet, adjusted his slipping sock, and shuffled his way toward the kitchen fireplace.
“Good to see you, Potter.”
Millie rumbled a warning, “Pansy…”
“Best friends,” Harry agreed.
“Harry.”
“I just can’t believe Astoria would do that to Draco,” Hermione puzzled. “For four years? I know she respects him. I would’ve bet Galleons she loved him, too.” She rubbed her belly with one hand while she poured boiling water into the waiting teapot.
Harry wonders if this is what relief feels like to him now: This syrup-slow release of breath, the careful unclenching of his jaw. A nerve twinges in Harry’s neck, and it skitters and sizzles all the way through his fingertips.
Ted sent Harry a vaguely apologetic look as he followed Malfoy out the door. Harry looked around at the mess of his letters, at the bright purple stationary Teddy’d been reading from when Malfoy arrived. It smelled like lavender perfume. Harry crumpled the flowery parchment in his fist, and dropped his head to the tabletop with a groan.
"Teddy'll be home, and I think I'm going to need time by myself to think."
“No,” James said, defensive. “Neville would’ve put my potions in the hospital wing, with Pomfrey. I’d have to go there any time I needed something. All because those bloody bastards couldn’t keep their hands to themselves! How is that fair?”
Hermione followed him down the hall to the entryway Apparition point, wringing her hands. “I’m sorry! I shouldn’t have brought it up—”
James got into trouble in the Great Hall yesterday, but I didn’t see what happened. I’d ask him, but he’s being a right git and I don’t want to start a row. (Don’t tell me not to call him a git. You haven’t been here. You don’t know.)
to go, mate.”
“Right. Yes. A rumor that Draco... played for the other team, as it were.”
She frowned, “The theatre, I believe. He proposed a football match, but I can’t think that would be a safe environment for children.”
“Was I expected to forget, too?”
“Veela
“You’re right,” Harry told her, and Teddy nodded vigorously. Winky took this as permission to vanish all the remaining alcohol with a clap of her cold hands.
, all right, but you thought you owned his
Artie’s cat goes by Barb now. It’s a long story.
Luckily, Astoria was absorbed in reading the back of a package as Harry approached. He cleared his throat too loudly. She blinked. “Hello? May I help you?”
“I’d caught a couple of them trying to nick some, the first week of school.”
George waved a hand. “I’ve no idea. They just got a new one with dragons on the front. I’m sure Roxie’s looking for a newb to destroy.”
Angie shifted a little in her seat, as if she were suddenly uneasy. “Rumors. Nothing but whispers, and everyone’s always talked
“I know!” Spinnet cried, throwing up both hands. “I know she’s a damn sight better than the last few. Where do we get these nightmares? Honestly, you’d think we never gave the cadets any sensitivity training! Don’t they know better than to shit where they eat? Were they raised by
“I’m really glad,” he said. “We just—Scorpius is such a great kid. I’m sure the next will be wonderful, too.”
“Hermione! Hermione Granger-Weasley, you are not going to
“You’re a better man than this,” she said softly.
“No, I just meant—” She hesitated. “We all thought you’d be there. You and Ronald, both.”
Harry’s godson shoved him out into the rain, just as the headmistress stepped through the doors onto the imposing stone steps of Hogwarts. Her Umbrella Charm shimmered with
Starving!”
For three years, Robards drilled him in things like facial symmetry, markers of age and illness, anthropometrics. Harry struggled to separate his personal feelings from his impressions. He had to learn to identify what made a person beautiful or bland, open or obfuscating, with no foreknowledge of their personality or history. It was difficult. Even though he finally had the words for
“Hello to you, too, Angie,” Harry mumbled in return, sipping at his lukewarm Yorkshire Gold. He grimaced; it just didn’t taste good at room temp.
“Rights! I see. Circe forbid we infringe on Harry Potter’s rights!”
Artie’s cat is called Conan the Barbarian, did you know? It’s a Muggle thing. Drew Grimes, who’s in sixth year, thought the name was stupid and started calling him “Barb,” and the name sort of stuck. So now Artie has a male cat named Barb, who never stops trying to put his paw in Scorpius’s milk tea.
The gargoyle spun aside with a murmured password—“Caithness”—and they stepped onto the winding staircase, traveling upward like a very twisty Muggle escalator.
“He’s been
.” Parkinson’s voice dripped sarcastic fury. “Don’t try to tell me those twins didn’t deserve it! They left him there to
“Her son is a Snake.”
Harry buffeted Teddy’s shoulder. “She’s a wise lady.”
“Then why? Are you really that devoted to worming your way into my family?”
"What was left to inherit?" The blond supplied dryly. "Enough, Potter. Enough to make the fertility clinic worthwhile. Though I see your point; the Malfoy legacy is largely sunburns, excellent posture, and genocidal mania, these days."
, and people would love him. It made no sense. If Malfoy had that ability, surely he would’ve used it on everyone? On Hermione, or Ron? On Harry?
James shook his head. “Rose helped me—” He stopped himself, eyes widening. “She won’t get in trouble, will she?”
, I suppose?” Parkinson demanded. “His injuries are inconsequential?”
“James is waiting in my office,” McGonagall said. “He has not been forthcoming.”
It was odd, wasn’t it? It seemed odd.
Pansy never gave a single interview, not even to her own magazine. Theo was kind about Pansy in the press, Harry remembers. Very repentant. But Pansy isn’t the sort to forgive.
“No?”
“I wanted to—to tell you. To let you know—” Harry swallowed hard. “The thestrals, James. I wanted to warn you about the thestrals.”
“What’re you guys doing here?” she demanded, which made Lakshmi laugh.
Neville fidgeted, and looked up at Harry through dark lashes. That was a trick, since Neville was over 180 centimeters tall, and Harry’s glasses sat in line with Nev’s chin. “He’s a tough customer, your James. Hard to crack. Maybe I should’ve pushed harder.”
“Al!” Teddy shouted. “The Great and Terrible Albus Potter arrives at last!”
“Harry avoids Draco,” Hermione snorted. “Hasn’t taken a meeting with him in ages, even though they ask for his help on all kinds of cases.”
“The love letters.”
“…I’m sure I don’t know.”
“Hi Draco,” Teddy said, a bit nervously. He stood, but then seemed unsure whether to approach his older cousin. His smile was a touch too bright. “You’re here to help with Sam Wolpert?”
“I know, Harry,” Sol soothed. “He knew that, too, which is all that really matters. But I think you’re forgetting the most important thing.”
“Harry Potter was very angry,” Winky told him, pulling a little at one of her big, wooly ears. “The Elves is not wanting to bother Harry Potter, but Winky is coming anyway. To stop the shaking.” She gave him a very disappointed look. “Harry Potter is breaking things.”
. You’re so predictable, Potter. Have you been replaying the highlights of your fan mail inside your head, this whole time?”
he wrote,
“Potter! Pay attention.” Malfoy pointed a long finger at his own face. A gust of wind whipped his hair across his forehead. “White-gold hair. Pale eyes. Colorless skin. A natural gift for Legilimency. Bone structure which, on a woman, would probably be much more attractive.”
The blonde woman noticed the state of him immediately, and distracted the children with several pairs of strange sunglasses.
But friends, please believe me: Nothing Rowling says or does can change the part of her story that lives in YOU.
Ron left to order their food and drink at the counter, while Hermione sorted her notes into incomprehensible piles. Harry took his jacket off and chewed on the inside of his cheek. He tapped his chest with his fingers. He blinked too much.
“At least they’re keeping back,” she remarked without preamble.
The boars turned forward again, apparently unimpressed. Massive iron gates swung open soundlessly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I go find Scorpius?” Al said.
“Yes. And you are his safe place.”
Teddy rolled his eyes. “No one’s arguing against you and Ginny, and Ron and Hermione, and all those couples who rushed to the altar after Voldemort kicked the Pensieve. You all seem happy enough.”
“My kids like football well enough. Especially James.” Harry laughed, remembering: “And
“Ginny was a force of nature,” she said. “Nobody would risk her temper.”
Scorpius. Astoria’s very, erm, pleasant. It’s not like we’re still schoolboys, squabbling over Quidditch and jinxing each other in corridors.”
“Good, good. Found the reversal spell then?”
“He did,” Hestia said, bowing her head. “And we are very thankful. And very sorry.”
“I’m very hungry,” Scorpius announced thoughtfully, squinting at the menu board. “I didn’t think I was hungry at all, but then I walked in and everything smells delicious, and
. It took on a life of its own.
“Millie’s father didn’t mix much with the old crowd, after the wedding,” Pansy remarked. “I’m sure you can imagine why.”
Astoria was only a person, like any other, when you looked at her like a stranger. It was reassuring. Harry wondered, sometimes, if people thought he was checking them out while he profiled. He made sure to scowl whilst he did this sort of thing.
. Somebody fixed it, but it was belching some kind of smoke for a couple days. Smelled like petrol. James had to miss a class on Monday.”
Grimmauld Place had a very nice warded coffee maker, imported from Japan (as most magic-friendly electronics were). It also had a shiny microwave which Molly Weasley frowned at every time she visited. It did not, sadly, have a House-elf. Kreacher had been gone longer than Lily’d been alive. She never knew the grouchy old Elf. Something twisted in Harry’s chest.
letters. There must be nearly a hundred of them in there.”
“Send your children a few presents,” Sol suggested, though it sounded more like a command. “Send Lily a stuffed lion. Ask the boys if they’re happy, and tell them how much you miss them this year. Honesty, Harry. Honesty and affection.”
No, no, and hell no.
“Potter,” Pucey nodded back with blatant confusion. “Visiting the kids?”
Harry slides his glasses down, pinches the bridge of his nose. Because:
“I’ve never been sure,” Flora admitted, shaking her head. “Aunt Alecto and Uncle Amycus protected us. They loved us. They were
“Harry Potter, I am
“I’ll pass it along.”
They’re a disaster, honestly. Draco is brilliant, and, yes, prickly and a little dangerous, but also… Sexy. Warm.

Harry tucked the Marauders’ Map into his pocket before he focused on the snake-shaped sink tap. Parseltongue wasn’t the only Magical language—Mermish, Gnomish, Elvish, Hermione was collecting the set—but it was the only language you didn’t need to
“Winky?”
“I think I showed up to prove to myself that I could.”
“No problem,” Harry yelled back. The door opened and closed, and there was the distinct
Got any tricks for getting spit-up out of un-gessoed canvas?
“Did you know, Potter,” Parkinson said slowly. “Millie and Flora have always been so guarded about their friendship with you. I thought they were trying to spare my feelings. Not very Slytherin, but there’s a first time for everything. Now, though, I wonder—”
“It was what Draco told us to do,” Hestia said. Her lip shook a little.
He tries not to watch his own team as they practice maneuvers. He tries to keep his eye roaming, looking for the shine of the snitch, but he can’t seem to focus. Ron in the Keeper’s position. Angie, Spinnet, and Cho Chang: Chasing. Apparently, everyone is a Gryffindor today. Ella Flint circles the perimeter like a referee. There are too many players on the field, so there’s room for teal-haired Teddy, for Roxie, for bored Dominique. Millicent Bulstrode, whom Harry’s never seen on a broom before. Albus, improbably, stands at ground level with a clipboard and a whistle. Harry watches as he makes untidy notes with his brow furrowed. After a few minutes, Scorpius Malfoy joins him. Even in Harry’s own fantasy, Al won’t go anywhere without Scorpius.
Dumbledore smiled.
“Yes and no,” Flora said. “We were all supposed to be doing it, but some of us, like Gregory and Vincent, just weren’t any good at subterfuge. There were people like Pansy, from powerful families that He Who Must Not Be Named was still courting. And some... well, the rest of us just pretended. We did just enough to satisfy my aunt and uncle, without exposing anyone to the Death Eaters’ attention.”
He thinks Pansy knows. Ron would, if he were here, and Luna. Hell, maybe all of Harry’s oldest friends would know the word that’s caught in Harry’s chest. The regret, too.
“A credit to the family,” Percy chortled, but then added, “just like her mother.”
“Yes, trade-offs, Weasel,” Parkinson said. “That’s how this works! You get to sail into the Auror service without even a N.E.W.T. You are world-famous, and married to the most influential witch in the British Isles.”
“But Felicity is so—” Catching Pomfrey’s scowl, Lakshmi reddened. “Ah. She’s a very nice woman. And very accomplished.”
At first, Harry’d been hurt—insulted, even—when Luna told him that she wasn’t willing or able to treat him herself. Harry trusted Luna. He knew she wouldn’t take all of his thoughts and fears and
of disapparition.
Fleur? Why is she running around with your mother to begin with?”
“Weeks?” Harry moaned. “Fuck. Poor kid.”
“I didn’t know Fleur was studying birds,” Harry admitted, a bit sore about it.

It was a strange sensation—wanting to contradict Malfoy, out of routine politeness, while at the same time agreeing the man had a point. He
“People started getting ill. Bad food, or not enough water, or the stress—who knows?” Millicent shifted an arm around the back of Flora’s chair, and her wife leaned back into it. “We only had nineteen upperclassmen with us. Most of the Ravenclaws and all of Gryffindor abandoned us, soon as McGonagall’s back was turned, to go back to the fighting. Weren’t many Hufflepuffs left at Hogwarts by then, ‘cept those newly-sorted. 208 little kids under the care of 15 Slytherins, three Ravenclaws, and Zacharias Smith.”
“Fuck if I know!”
“It’s not enough, Pansy,” he sighs. Every-fucking-thing hurts like a rotten tooth. “You think I don’t know he’s got issues? That I didn’t see that?”
“How did Malfoy plan to destroy the Vanishing Cabinet?”
Astoria’s brown eyes went soft. “Truly, Mr. Potter. Thank you. We’re doing very well.”
“Yeah. Yeah, mate, I promise.”
. “Ah, damn, I’ve got to go. Meeting with the Irish Quidditch Commission, and then George needs an extra hand with shipment tonight.”
“I don’t always eat breakfast.”
“Draco isn’t Theodore,” he tells her softly. She refuses to flinch, but Harry reads it in her eyes anyway. Something’s sparking within. “I don’t know why he did this, but it wasn’t… it was only once. He doesn’t want anybody else.”
The G.R.I.M. Alliance—a network of support for magical people in gender, romantic, and/or intimate minorities—had been founded in the early 2000s. The name could use some work, Harry thought, but wizards did love an acronym.
“It’ll be adorable,” Harry grinned. “And nostalgic! The boys so enjoyed being called Jameth and Albuth.”

But Ron’s marriage was after Dumbledore’s time, as well, and so it still felt like the headmaster was
“Right. ‘Course.”
“I’m happy for Artie,” Harry realized, slowly. “Lily is really upset, though.”
It was a bit of a trick getting James onto the platform, since he’d always taken it at a run. Even Harry had trouble walking straight at a brick wall without flinching. James managed it with his eyes closed. Albus didn’t dare take the piss.
“You didn’t tell my anything,” Teddy groused. He was leaning hard against the worktop.
Lily’s driving me nuts in Gryffindor, but what else is new?
Harry wasn’t sure that was true, but arguing with Floo-Hermione was nearly as impossible as arguing with her in person. He managed to prop his head up on his fist and blink his eyes open wider. He tried on a smile.
, but not that.
The thing is: Our community needed WORDS right now. Even imperfect ones. We need messages of hope, to overwrite the hate we've had to swallow in the last few days.
a Lion?”
“Nice?” Harry suggested, amused. “Accomplished?”
“Erm… Right.” Harry drew a breath, and had to force himself to release it. “Yes, you’re right. I’m sorry.”
All our love,
Dumbledore’s long beard twitched. “Don’t you remember?”
Harry didn’t have the space inside his head for that concept. For the idea that eleven-year-old Malfoy had been able to
“Sure. But you’re an adult, with an adult perspective. Lily is a homesick child.”
“Would you be upset if your best friend ended up in a rival house?”
“All in good time, Harry. Let’s wait for James to explain himself, hmm?”
“Are we having that kind of session today?” Sol wondered, black eyebrows going up. “Are we in a sarcastic, pedantic mood?”
“We’re both sorry. Tired, and cranky, and sad. And sorry. It’ll be better in the morning.”
“I heard that was rather lackluster. Although she did get to dance with Michael Corner.”
“Harry?”
“Worried about last suppers?” Harry said.
Hermione hesitated, eyes on the television. “Why do you ask?”
“A small, but meaningful one,” McGonagall said.
“Looks like, sir,” Spinnet agreed regretfully.
Teddy started giggling. It sounded odd, coming through those fangs. “‘Drunk as a skunk?’ Really?”
“No,” she frowns, tilting her head. The light from the flickering lanterns slides across glossy black hair and illuminates her cheekbones. He remembers thinking her ugly, back at Hogwarts, and he can’t imagine it now. But then, he’d told himself Draco was ugly once, too.
* * *
Harry caught Ron’s eye. “I’m guessing we shall.”
“You were vile right back,” Ron said coldly.
“I know you think it’s a bad idea to wait for her,” Teddy said, faintly accusing.
Draco Malfoy had grown paler with age. He was the fairest person Harry knew, with skin so porcelain and pore-less that Harry used to wonder if he used a Glamour. His hair wasn’t even properly blond—it was pure, unrelieved white, each strand thicker than it seemed it should be. Every part of Malfoy was cream, ivory, and snow. He wore black and gray, occasionally green, like the man still slept in the Slytherin dormitory. He wore his hair long enough to curl around his ears, in loose waves that seemed (to Harry) shockingly disheveled. His widow’s peak had increased, making his face was even more triangular.
Teddy was a good, kind man. Harry should eat the good, kind glue-porridge.
A series of four uncomfortable Apparitions later, Harry and Teddy landed just outside the Hogwarts gates. Teddy popped open the Holyhead Harpies umbrella, and Harry ducked under it with him. A pair of pillar-perched stone boars turned their heads, just slightly, to regard them both.
“He’s a jealous man.”
“I thought you liked that,” Harry said. “Visiting? Prefect bathroom, and whatnot?”
, Harry Potter,” she said tightly. She stared over his shoulder at the disgruntled eavesdropper for a long moment before nodding once to herself, as if her mind was made up. Her mouth barely moved as she said, “Read the transcripts.”
Harry asked Mione, once, how she’d ever gotten permission to use one to take extra classes. It was so ridiculous, so dangerous! But, of course, she hadn’t... at least, not yet. Future Dumbledore needed Hermione to have the device, because he needed Sirius Black to be saved. He went back in time—a series of small, clever leaps—and made sure she’d have it.
“Today, Harry. That happens today.”
“But they always seemed... solid,” Harry remarked as he fell into a chair at the kitchen table. “Happy, even.”
“Yes, but—” Spinnet seemed conflicted, and her nose flushed, to match her ears, as she met Harry’s eye. “I happened to come out of the office before she got the drawer closed this morning. I didn’t get a long look, sir, but the drawer... it’s full of letters.
“Thank you for your consideration,” she replied with serene politeness. “He has my permission. He can meet me at Zabini Couture after he’s finished.”
Professor Tugwood’s sparkling eyes slid down the ward, taking in the curtained cubicle. Then they paused, just a moment, on Neville, before coming to rest on Harry. Her black eyebrows went up.
“Sure, mate, sure.”
, the great bigoted bitch?”
“Call us cowards, if you want,” Flora said in a wavering voice. “Perhaps we are. Perhaps we should have been brave enough to sacrifice ourselves, and our friends, and our families. He Who Must Not Be Named would’ve punished Slytherins with a good deal more cruelty than the rest of you, but perhaps... perhaps we deserved it.”
“Madam Pomfrey was notified. He has been in the hospital wing for the past four hours. Poppy exhausted all the usual remedies, and we’re moving on to Curse-specific treatment protocols. Which is why,” she arched her eyebrows, “we need to know which Curse was cast on Mr. Wolpert.”
“Malfoy just keeps
“She’s angry,” Harry challenged.
And this is it—
Five hours ago, Harry hugged Scorpius Malfoy and sent him off to bed.
Harry faked a gasp.
“It’s tough to talk about. For us,” her husband continued, meeting Millie’s firm eye. “I reckon it’s just as tough for you. So. Thank you.”
“That’d be a lie,” Harry snorted.
“New sweet shop?” Harry frowned. “Why do you need a Glamour to buy sweets?”
“She did!” Harry pushed his glasses up, rubbed at his eyes. “There’s a lot of bad history there. We all have demons. Ginny’s demons were mostly reptiles.”

Harry breathed out a sigh of relief.
sitting in here reading your fan mail?”
“Ah, right. Sorry. It’s Al’s father, but I’m using a Glamour.”
“Found him,” Lily announced. She still hadn’t released the older boys. “He’s coming.”
“Thank you,” Hermione finally said, solemnly. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you doing this. All of you. It must be—” She choked a little, and turned to Ron.
Blink. Nod.
Harry reached out, but James smacked his hand away with a snarl. “I can’t walk, and I can’t fly, and Mum is dead. She is
Teddy snorted. “Because he took one look at you, fast asleep, and decided to Curse himself in the face?”
“Get the potato-leek,” Albus said. “I’ll split a sweet with you for afters.”
“Harry. That…” Teddy stopped himself, shook himself.
Spinnet had been at school with Harry—a Gryffindor Chaser, and classmate of Fred and George—and she’d joined the Auror service straight out of Hogwarts. She was a life-long friend of Angelina. She was a member of Dumbledore’s Army. Harry knew Spinnet about as well as he knew anyone he wasn’t currently related to, but the look on her face now (“embarrassed rage,” Harry couldn’t help but call it) was entirely new.
. Right. But first, coffee.
. It’s pathetic, and more than a little self-destructive, to be using the word ‘love’ for the first time only
Harry waved. “Tonight. Okay. Bye.”
Harry shook his head. “Jameson’s an excellent Auror. He wanted fieldwork, and he deserves it. We were lucky to hold onto him for as long as we did.”
When Harry blinked his way back, Teddy was on the other side of the room. Red-eyed, red-nosed, his hair still dusty brown and limp with sweat. His wand trembled at his side.
He sat up in bed, wide awake, for far longer than he should have. There was a watery, abstract painting on the wall across from Harry’s bed. Dean painted it. Usually, the colors made Harry feel calm, restful, but tonight the rainy palette just made him antsy. He turned off the bedside lamp after an hour of staring, in a vain attempt to make himself sleepy. He kept hearing Malfoy say,
“Draco realized he had to seal up the Vanishing Cabinet,” Hestia said. “So we lost him, too.”
to run.”
Harry bit down on the inside of his cheek. This wasn’t a day for honoring the dead.
Harry stared at her, arrested. His lungs were burning, but he couldn’t draw in any air. He was aware, vaguely, that the witch at the counter was listening in with undisguised curiosity. He cast a vicious Muffliato and said, “Malfoy hated me.”
“True,” she grimaced. “But at least it isn’t your hair.”
“Are you going to look again, Harry?”
He could hear pounding. It wasn’t only his head.
Harry watched his spine stiffen, his shoulders grow sharper. He’d spent so much of his life watching Draco Malfoy, and then so much trying
Harry could see her point, but: “Victoire’s dad was 27 when he married Fleur.”
“I’m Flooing my therapist. Go back to work.”
“Right.” Harry tried not to grit his teeth, but he could tell by Ron’s expression that he wasn’t quite managing it. “Makes sense. Important, to get the
“Appealing?” Flora said. “To slugs?”
James didn't make an appearance, but that was fair enough.
Sol’s expression didn’t change. Harry felt flushed.

“Is that your heart’s desire, Harry? To see your wife again?”
“I’m thinking. Just closing my eyes to think. Thoughtfully.”
he told himself firmly.
“It was terrible,” Flora continued, in an eerily similar voice. “The little ones were so frightened. The Gryffindors and Ravenclaws knew they had family up there, fighting. The Slytherins, too, and most on the wrong side. If it weren’t for the little Hufflepuffs...” She smiled bleakly. “Well, they kept us all sane, didn’t they? They kept their heads. It held the lot of us together, down there.”
Harry and Teddy spent the evening with the children, which meant they'd spent it greeting half of Hogwarts's lower classes, as well. It was a revolving door of curious 'hellos.' Albus and Scorpius were practically conjoined, and Rose directed the boys like they were co-starring in a very boring play. With Rose came Molly, and a few of the more extroverted Ravenclaws. Lorcan and Lysander stopped by, as did Dom and Roxie, but the older students all had too much studying and too little interest to stay. Lily brought Artie, Louis, and a quick-witted Snake named Anita. Anita was blind, and it'd taken Harry more than an hour to pick up on it. Lily rolled her eyes at her father and whispered (too loudly) that
Parkinson’s face, usually sneering or smirking, went utterly blank. “You aren’t straight,” she said. It wasn’t a question.
, Harry thought, for a loose definition of ‘thinking.’
“What did he say?” Harry asks. He carries the mugs to the table, setting Pansy’s down first. She isn’t smiling anymore. Her hesitation speaks volumes, because Pansy Parkinson gossips like Harry sits a broom. Effortless. Instinctual. Joyfully.
“Well, yes, he was,” Hermione said carefully. “Not at that time, though. Not until a few years later. The letters were… I don’t think anyone even knew he was doing that, until he’d already begun.”
“Hestia and Millie were a bit busy,” Parkinson sneered, “hiding all those underage students that McGonagall didn’t want on the battlefield.”
It took her five years to make the transition, since most of her N.E.W.T.s were in the wrong subjects. She’d qualified and joined a London-based practice three years ago. Harry couldn’t help feeling it happened just in time.
“Mione is really good at the details. When she wants to understand something, she dives deep. It’s a good thing, and she’s so brilliant, but sometimes…”
While Teddy scratched out a quick note to George, Harry got coffee brewing and put the kettle on again for Ted. It had boiled nearly dry in the younger man’s haste to warn Harry about the Floo. Then he sliced and toasted several pieces of bread, reheated some sausages from yesterday’s breakfast, and moved everything to the table with a Wingardium Leviosa. (
Luna smiled beatifically. “Thanks ever so.”
“Not her fault,” Harry said, sheepish. “She was perfectly lovely.”
Artie sighed theatrically. “Probably.”
“She would know,” Harry nodded, wide-eyed.
Ron returned it, grin faded to something softer. “Technically speaking, we both did.”
Years ago, when they finally put a label on Harry’s sexuality, he and Ginny talked about what it meant for their marriage. They were public figures. There was James, and the promise of Al, and the Wizarding press breathing down both their necks. They sat and imagined the headlines together:
“The answer’s for Madam Pomfrey,” Harry said. “For Sam Wolpert. Not me.”
Don’t apologize, either, for bringing up Hannah. She was a gift, and I like to think about her. The pain is part of loving her, now.
Teddy started to laugh. “Yes! It’s me. They are all fascinated with my teal hair.”
, is it?”
I’m going to need to speak to somebody. After.”
“‘Course it is, it’s Mione,” Ron rolled his eyes. “Why she can’t just take her maternity leave to sit around rocking an infant, eating crisps, I’ll never know. But she’s hit the ground running with the whole idea—”
“Among other things. They behaving for you?”
time. I am a very busy woman.”
Malfoy’s wry expression went flat. “Of course. Shall we?”
“It might be, if your family line didn’t depend upon a male heir for direct inheritance.” Malfoy made a frustrated hand gesture. “The old Wizarding families weren’t any more progressive than their Muggle counterparts, and they had magic to ensure Their Will Be Done. Blood magic, very ancient. Very stupid. It was particularly idiotic for the Malfoys, as we have so much Veela inheritance swimming around in our gene pool.”
Ted pulled an umbrella from the still-pretty-ugly troll leg umbrella stand. His amber eyes were serious. They stepped out on the flagstone stoop, joined hands, and Disapparted with a
“Oh, no. But I’ve picked up a word, here or there.” He shrugged. “Not unlike your Mr. Granger-Weasley. I’m sure my pronunciation is pedestrian, at best.”
“Yeah, but like… she probably didn’t mean it.”
“Yes. Of course. I am sorry, Harry. It must be awful.”
Harry smiled. He rubbed a palm over the Protean medallion on his chest.
Speaking of Al, he and Rose had apparently located the Malfoys. Astoria and Draco were both here, and plenty of people stared at them, too. Harry supposed he was grateful for the divided spectacle. There was a whispering cloud of onlookers circling the Malfoys, but only Scorpius showed any sign that he’d noticed. Rose read something aloud as she walked. Al was too busy digging through his school satchel. Astoria smiled placidly, like a posed portrait, and Draco wore a habitual scowl.
He didn’t know Pansy at school—not at all—but he knows her now. He knows her smell, and the scars along her forearms, and that unbreakable love for Draco Malfoy. A love that survived the worst the war could dole out, and kept them both breathing. An immutable truth.
“Someone had to be!” she snapped back. The elegant woman closed her eyes and drew a long breath. “McGonagall told them not to fight. She thought we could just send them home. The Hog’s Head was a stupid idea—where were we meant to go, once we reached Hogsmeade? They couldn’t Apparate! Some of the seventh-years had barely qualified, but we knew we couldn't move so many out of a war zone. Not without Splinching.” She made a noise of disgust. “We couldn't get back in, to go for help. The school’s wards were in some sort of tailspin, doing their level best to protect that bloody
Parkinson’s mouth twisted. “Damage the cabinet beyond repair, and suffer the consequences.”
“Harry’s got a right to privacy,” Ron argued.
Scorpius went pale, which was a trick-and-a-half for a Malfoy. “Um. Yes. Mother and Vikram will be living in London, as his business is here. She’s moving into his townhouse. Father and I will stay in Hogsmeade.”
“Good, good,” Neville nodded, stepping completely out of the partition with his hands in his pockets. He cast a Silencing Charm on the curtains, and turned to lean against the wall. “What was it happened, after all?”
Al flipped her two fingers, and Harry mumbled “Oi!” through a mouthful of sausage roll.
James didn’t say anything for a long moment. “…Love you, too.”
“Yes. Yes. A thousand times
“Sorry, but I’ve got two older sisters who were quick to disillusion me.”
Teddy’s blue eyebrow went up, and Harry had to look away. It was true, of course—James had grown distant, snappish, with most of the family, but Teddy had always been different. Even in the months right after the accident, James opened up to his elder godbrother. Moving Ted into Grimmauld Place had been one of Harry’s better decisions that year. Recently, though, things seemed to be getting worse, not better.
“You think Parkinson will try to out me to the press?”
“Hello Pansy,” Hermione said, again with the hand-shaking. “Thank you for coming.”
“I asked you to come in because I believe James is not being entirely honest with me, nor with his Head of House,” McGonagall said. James shifted in his chair.
Harry decided that coffee was needed before he spoke to anyone else today. Tea was a lovely drink and all, but Harry preferred a stronger kick of caffeine. He liked the smell of it, the bitter aftertaste. Neville tried to turn Harry on to yerba mate, but it tasted the way grass clippings smelled.
. Malfoy made no excuses for himself, asked for no forgiveness from Ron. He listed his crimes, in detail, and then apologized for them. One by one. Insults. Hexes. Poison. Fiendfyre. Ron found the whole thing infuriating, at the time, but he admitted, years later, that he’d never gotten rid of the letter. That he pulled it out, sometimes, to remind himself. Harry never could ask what Ron needed to remember.
“Millie,” Luna was saying, “I was wondering if you’d share the recipe for your peach pralines?”
They breathe together, all out of sync, as the tea cools and the night settles in the back garden. Pansy’s flush fades, and Harry’s hands stop shaking, and it’s so odd, isn’t it? Sitting here, like this, with
…It had been the letters, probably.
“One more thing…” Harry pauses halfway out of his chair. Pansy manages a weak smile. “Why haven’t you told anyone, Potter? There’s no way Granger or the Weasleys would’ve kept this quiet.”
“Oh, I don’t know. Her husband might like the idea. Blaise has a very Parisian attitude toward sex.”
Thirteen years ago, Hermione got high on Healer-grade pain potions prescribed after Rose’s birth. She cried about her magical necklace. “The

“You’re always on the toilet these days,” Angie scoffed. “And if I don’t tell someone about this right bloody now, I am going to explode!”
be. It’d been twenty-one years since the war.
Hestia cleared her throat a little too loud, drawing Harry’s eye. Hestia was Flora’s identical twin, but there was no chance of confusing them—Flora Bulstrode wore her long, chestnut hair naturally, while Hestia had dyed it a soft shade of pink.

“Fine.”
Flora’s eyes were wider than Harry’d ever seen them. She kept shooting glances at her sister, and her wife.
“I’m—that’s
“No, sir, the Jar has to be keyed to your magical signature,” Harry explained at normal volume. “It thinks you were trying to steal candy on the sales floor. But I’m sure it was mistaken.”
“Early this morning, there was a tremendous uproar in Gryffindor Tower. Another fifth-year boy, Samuel Wolpert, was found unconscious near James’s bed.”
“Ron loves
“Zacharias?” Hermione yelped, and then blushed. “Only... I thought he left?”
Audrey blushed. Percy was never quite as awful as he seemed.
“You can work the till, can’t you, Haz?” George spun away from the register like a circus barker. “I have a new line of Flavored Farts to push. Ha! Pushing farts!”
“No, sorry,” Harry mumbled. He reached for his tea. “Forget I asked.”
“Harry?” Hermione murmured. “What’s wrong?”
“Doesn’t quite seem possible, to be that sympathetic
“And I’m under a very nasty contract,” Parkinson argued. “Bravo for that, Hermione, very sly. Since I can’t ever discuss anything Potter tells me with anyone—even my
“Oh, yes! Why don’t we all get the orders settled, and maybe use the toilet?” When Parkinson raised an eyebrow at her, Hermione flushed. “Well. Just in case.”
Harry thought about that as Millie’s cigarette filled the alley with the smell of clove. There didn’t seem to be any rush. Harry’s heart beat in a normal rhythm again, and his magic retreated. He licked his lips.
“Best policy,” Harry muttered, feeling really very sleepy.
“But you didn’t,” Millicent told her, with obvious pride.
would trust me,” Harry said, and then immediately wished he hadn’t.
“Gryffindor,” Harry managed.
“I don’t think the glowy thingamabob works on me,” Harry said. Ted sipped his butterbeer and tilted his head.
“You are not Mr. James Potter’s father,” McGonagall said. “It would be inappropriate to speak to you alone.”
“Of course she says that,” Malfoy drawled. “She’s built an entire career on championing magical beasts’ and beings’ rights. She’d never condone the harvest of unicorn horn, even ethically.”
“Everything has changed,” Ted nodded, wand still at the ready. “Everything in your whole life, Harry. Except you.”
This year, the Potters braved the Floo. It let out just around the corner, in a hidden alcove next to bicycle parking. The fireplace attendants looked ragged every September the First, hair frizzing and voices hoarse. Harry didn’t bother to Glamour for the trip to Platform 9 ¾; his kids were nearly as recognizable as he was. They all had to learn to endure the scrutiny.
“True, which is why these are only rumors. Just because a bloke turns down offers doesn’t make him bent.” Angie sipped her tea and shot Harry a sharp, knowing look. “For that matter, accepting offers wouldn’t make him straight, either.”
“Yeah. Right.”
“You could tell me,” Harry finally offered.
“It’s not personal,” Harry said. “He’s doing it to all of us.”
Once everyone had what they needed to fortify themselves (Ron had eaten two sandwiches and a bag of crisps while waiting for everyone else’s food to arrive), Hermione ushered the group back to the table. Millie and Flora took seats together, across from Hermione and Ron. Hestia sat next to her sister, on the far end. That put the last interviewee right across from Harry.
Angie’s face lit up with slightly manically glee. “Astoria Malfoy is pregnant.”
“Spinnet,” Harry cut in, biting back his smile. “What has Morris done, exactly?”
“Oh, I will,” the mother assured him. Harry smirked.
“Hello Mrs. Bulstrode,” Lily said. “Is Artie around?”
“It’s—It’s the only way. The only way he’ll know, for certain, that I might come back. If he comes to me, and then I tell him I—” Harry chokes a bit. Breathes through it. “If I tell him what I did, he’ll never

to me and my friends in the seven years I’d known him.”
Millie pulled a pack of oddly-packaged cigarettes from her coat pocket. She always offered one to Harry, and Harry always declined. He couldn’t figure out if she was being polite or the opposite.
Harry sent Prongs off again with a thank you, and a promise to contact Ron for himself. Then he dressed quickly and warmly, threw a change of clothes into a satchel, and chugged his remaining caffeine.
“Jesus,” Harry groaned. “They aren’t
Just beyond the massive, toothless skull were two objects Harry could not have predicted in a million foolhardy lifetimes:
“Harry!” Pomfrey’s assistant cried, all dimples.
Sol sat across from him, ensconced in blush velvet, one ankle resting on his knee.
“I’m very glad you know that,” she said, looking back down at her work. “But they weren’t the only people who would have
“No one deserved it,” Hermione said.
“Draco was a big part of your life during school. You devoted so much attention to him.” Catching his withering glare, she only smiled again. “Really, Harry. You always were a bit obsessed.”
“Even if she isn’t, or you aren’t, she’ll still be your friend. You know that, don’t you?”
“Yep,” Neville replied.

“Nobody told me,” Harry admitted.
“Harry?” Neville replied in whisper, sticking his head out of the white curtains. He winced. “Sorry about all this.”
Harry glanced over his shoulder, toward the corner where Artie had a wad of paper napkins, attempting to de-cream Lily’s ginger ponytail. Al and Scorpius had their black and blond heads bent together nearby, whispering furiously.

Don’t thank me for that, Harry. It is my job.
“What was the question? Was I homesick?”
He could’ve killed Peter Pettigrew, and Voldemort may never have had the means to rise.
Pansy doesn’t offer a hand, or hug him, or kiss his cheek (god forbid). Just smiles that small, secretive smile and lets him pull the door open for her. He casts a wordless, wandless Warming charm over her small form, and she nods her thanks.
“What could he say that would make it all right? More all right than it is, I mean? We were only twenty. I’ve had a long time to get over it.”
“Right.” Al scrubbed a hand through his wavy hair. It looked like he hadn’t brushed it since he left home two weeks ago. Al’s robes were on skew-whiff and his glasses were smudged. Rose had a quill tucked into her ponytail, but was otherwise dressed normally. Scorpius looked like an advert for The Finest in British Wizarding Education.
that’s starting to hurt—”
“Or, actually… I think I rem’ber it, once. At Fleur’s wedding, maybe?”
Harry was watching when Al, Scorpius, and Rose came through the main doors. He was watching when Al noticed Harry at the professors’ table, and still watching when his middle child rolled his eyes to the ceiling with a sigh. He risked a small wave.
“Does that seem like something I suffer from, Potter?”
Hermione regained command of the room: “And you Flora, Hestia? Millie? When did you meet?”
Al shot Scorpius a warning look, but it was too late.
Hermione coaxed Al and Rose back over to Harry, and his middle child permitted Harry to hug him (a little too tightly).
“Hmm?”
“It is not

has changed, Ted.” Harry’s voice was like an earthquake, a rumble of things shifting deep below.
Al’s question pulled Harry out of himself with a jerk. His middle-child, his mini-me, waited with raised eyebrows.
“The Mirror of Erised shows us our truest desires, yes. And when we have them? It shows us nothing but ourselves.”
Ron’s expression went dangerously cynical. “Trade-offs? Is that we’re calling it?”
“Bloody hell—”
“Right,” Harry sniffed, pointing an ineffectual finger at Spinnet. She just tucked her smile behind a hand. “I’ll send Morris back to the paddling pool at the end of the day. But you’re helping me screen the next one.”
“Oh, come off it—”
“Would that were true…” Harry grumbled, dropping his face into his hands. He looked up again, leaning his chin on a palm, elbow resting perilously close to a cold cup of tea. He pulled out his scuffed pocket watch, and cringed. “It’s half after ten.”
Harry stood to meet her as she came ran around the end of the staff table. He accepted her hug with an
“D’you know your cousin is a Veela?” Harry wondered. Teddy stopped laughing.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “For all the good it did. I spent the whole day on the sofa watching
“Teddy’s with me. He and James went back to Gryffindor Tower, to disable the Curse and gather up all his potions. They’ll be headed this way.”
He tried not to squeak his shoes on the slick floor as he made his way across the ward. “Neville?” he called, but quietly.
“Nah, that’s just her face.” Harry snorted, and Millie’s lips twitched into a tiny, dimpled smile. “She don’t like hypocrites, Potter. She don’t like secrets. I think she got enough of both when we were young.”
“I have to come in? For a meeting?” Harry’s heart sank. It was unusual for parents to visit Hogwarts at all; even more so for a student infraction.
“Would you like to speak about James’s physical therapy?” she wondered. “Or are you burned out on tough conversations for the weekend?”
There wasn’t much left to say. Hermione’s quill had gone still, and Ron had a tight grip on her hip, scarred arm circling her waist. Harry had a million questions he wanted to ask, a million assurances he wanted to give, but everything felt inadequate.
Hestia sniffled a little, but set her jaw firmly. “Gemma Stevens. Half-blood. She deserves to be remembered.”
Pansy sips her tea and grimaces. “What she said to you, or to Draco?”
“It just—it doesn’t make sense.” Ron shook his head. “You knew then that Voldemort was depraved. You knew he was a murderer, and a despot. Why try to appease him at all?”
Millie sent an exasperated look Pansy’s way, but Harry had been sniffing out liars for a long time. He could read the hidden fondness in her face.
It’d been one hell of a day already, and Harry just wasn’t prepared to watch Draco Malfoy use an iPhone.
“I agree,” she nodded, and then placed a manicured hand on his elbow. “Please tell Scorpius to meet me before seven o’clock. It was lovely to see you.”
“They won’t serve Malfoys?” Harry interrupted. There was a tight, familiar feeling in his chest. He shoved it all the way down to his toes.
“But… if you can guarantee a male heir…”
Pansy nods. “Gregory had reservations about the two of you. To put it mildly. He only got the chance to voice them once.”
When the sweeter pasties had been devoured, and the sun had set, and Lily had somehow managed to get clotted cream in her hair, Harry settled the bill with Flora. She passed him a bag with dinner for Ted.
Sol frowned, but only said, “Fair enough. And what happened that evening?”
“A Pureblood Hufflepuff,” Angie said, “from a long line of Slytherins. And she raised another one without any problem, didn’t she?”
Teddy interrupted this with a sigh, and pushed himself back onto the sofa. Harry saw a flash of the irritation that Teddy had been shoving down all day. Ted took another gurgling drink before saying, “Why d’you even care, mate?”
“No problem,” Harry said, taking the owner’s place at the counter. The line to check out stretched straight down the main aisle, before curving to the left along the shopfront windows. Harry sighed.
Harry couldn’t help grinning. “The grand Gryffindor plot.”
“Evil? Voldemort’s followers were killing people!” Ron sputtered.
Harry scratched his jaw, chewed on the tip of his tongue. “…Is it?”
Professor McGonagall made an odd little sound of recognition. Harry frowned.
Harry finally unstuck himself from his own grief to put a hand on Teddy’s other shoulder. “Yes, James. Whatever you want.” When James looked up, glaring into Harry’s eyes, he forced himself to stay cool, collected. “But we’ve got to get Sam patched up. You know that.”
“I have to change,” Harry told his headmaster. His mentor. His puppeteer. His face was wet with tears and sweat, and his voice echoed off the walls.
. Two Gryffindors, a Ravenclaw, and a Slytherin.
At George’s side was Harry’s godson, Teddy Lupin. George hired Teddy right out of Hogwarts, and they’d been working together for three years. He was easy to find in a crowd since his hair color was frequently electric blue. He’d pierced his nose once and his lip twice, and the hoops were stark black against his pinky-pale skin.
“The same,” Malfoy replied, clicking his tongue. “I need to consult with a colleague about the properties of jobberknoll saliva.” Harry blanched, but Malfoy didn’t seem to notice. “The feathers interact so poorly with billywig, but I’ve a hunch that saliva might be less caustic. I’m hoping for insight, because it’d take weeks to fully test that hypothesis.”
She gave him time to reply, but there was no chance of that. Ron looked ill. His freckles were stark against the translucence of his skin. Harry pictured Fred, and Colin, and Lavender, Tonks and Remus, and on and on. A long parade of lives traded for Harry’s.
Slytherin was silent.

needed to be better with names) had come straight out of Auror training highly recommended. She made sure all the mail and memos were thoroughly screened before sorting them and sending it all through to the correct member of staff. She answered and directed the main Floo-call hearth, and transcribed endless notes in Ron’s particularly illegible scrawl. And she really didn’t flirt with Harry. Much.
“Fine,” Hermione sighed. “What is it?”
“You—you speak Parseltongue?”
“If you do not answer this Floo RIGHT
Dumbledore didn’t respond, but he did not interrupt, either. Harry knew a portrait wasn’t a ghost, and that a ghost wasn’t a person. Not really. But he also knew that whatever remained of Albus Dumbledore knew Harry Potter better than he knew himself. That was what McGonagall meant, wasn’t it?
That didn’t feel… exactly right.
Hermione laughed. Harry scowled.
Harry nodded. “Sometimes she can’t pull back enough to see the whole picture.”
Malfoy let the beard grow in while he was under house arrest, 20 years ago, and had never changed it. It was well-groomed, thick and short. Harry thought, at the time, that the beard made him look old. He didn’t look much different these days, though. He’d caught up to himself. It seemed Malfoy aged two decades in the six years following the war.
It wasn’t that Malfoy seemed unhappy—on the contrary, he was always engaged in the conversation, nodding thoughtfully and responding with expansive hand gestures. His white blond brows were always moving, and he touched his beard too much. The beard had been a shock the first time Harry saw it, right after Malfoy finished house arrest. It was neatly trimmed, only an inch long, but full and white as Father Christmas. If Father Christmas had cheekbones like Benedict Cumberbatch.
“Parkinson,” Harry nodded, then flushed. “Or, er, should I call you Mrs. Zabini?”
Minerva McGonagall remained the master of the well-timed entrance.
“I wish you two would take this a bit more seriously,” Hermione said. Her parchment stack looked rumpled from so much handling.
“Hello,” Scorpius said, climbing easily onto a tall stool at the long front counter. “Is Artemis ready for school to begin again? Do you think she and Lily will be in the same house? We’d welcome them in Slytherin, to be sure! Lily seems very excited. I didn’t attend the London primary school myself, of course, but Albus said it was entirely different from Hogwarts.”
She shook it with a wry smile. “I wonder if I shall ever be free of Potters and Lupins, running amok in my school.”
“No, actually.” The bearded blighter finally put down his phone. Teddy shot Harry a long-suffering look. He couldn’t be sure which of them it was meant to shame.
“Draco would have cheated on me ages ago?” Harry grits out.
“I’m not sure why I’m here,” Harry said, breathing hard.
Red train, white steam, gray concrete platform. Platform 9 ¾ never changed. That was a good thing, Harry thought.
“Louis was born. And Lily, of course. But I don’t understand what that has to do with you.”
Compared with the many days and nights Harry spent there, twenty-five years ago, the hospital wing was barely recognizable. Always the most modernized of all Hogwarts facilities, it'd been completely gutted after the war. Madam Pomfrey installed up-to-date magical monitoring equipment, as well as adjustable beds and safety rails. The floors and furniture were scrubbed clinical white. The walls were pale blue, the ceiling darker and Charmed to display fluffy clouds during the daytime, and pin-prick stars at night.
“I don’t remember that,” Harry faltered.
Millie was a bit teary, watching her wife. She laced their fingers together, and Flora came back to herself enough to squeeze. “Millie and Hestia were in a totally different part of the castle,” Flora went on. “Professor Vector sent a message to someone outside with her Patronus; that’s when I realized how large the Death Eater forces were. I pretended to search for Hestia, and Vector got agitated. She—she hexed me, just for spite.” She curled her empty hand into a tight fist on the table, and her lips went white and thin. “That was when Professor McGonagall arrived. Vector immediately went after her. She forgot about me. I—I thought about running. I
“And I
Professor McGonagall’s ageless eyes seemed to waver. “Best make it an overnight.”
“He’s stronger than you think, Parkinson,” Harry scowls. “He can handle himself.”
“Your fan mail?”
Harry shook his head too hard. “No, Mione! It’s the finish line! Who will kiss the hands and shake the babies?” He rubbed his forehead. “Wait. What?”
“Sorry. Just—”
. I just wanted to talk to you before you got on the train.”
Harry’s mind skittered and skipped over thoughts of Malfoys, and divorce, and illegitimate children. He didn’t let himself linger.
“Contrary to
“This whole bloody thing was a mistake,” Harry murmurs.
“I’m going to go check in with McGonagall,” he announced, as everyone looked up at him. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. “Erm, just want to go over a few more things. About James.”
“You got a minute, Harry? Sorry, Spinnet, but it’s—”
“My god,” Harry sighs again, and he can sense Pansy relaxing, although without his glasses, she’s just a black-and-tan blob across the room. “We’re a tire fire, the pair of us.”
“I've always found you very hard to predict,” McGonagall said flatly. “You zigged when I thought you’d zag. It took a long time for me to realize I should assume the foolhardiest option was the one you’d choose. Inevitably.” She softened that observation with a small smile. “Dumbledore seemed to have you figured out.”
“D’you think you’ll be a Slytherin like your mums?” Al wondered.
Malfoy bit his lips, stroked his beard. “It is. The Malfoy line ensured male heirs with magic.
“Louis does have really pretty hair. Does he do the smile thing?”
Flora tried to intervene. “Pansy didn’t mean—”
“Are you in the office?”
Lily’s hand was getting sweaty, but Harry had no desire to let go. He wished James and Al hadn’t run off so quickly. How long would Lily let him do this? Hold hands at Platform 9 ¾? James grew out of it in only a year. Albus never allowed it at all.
When Hermione and Hugo had come (bearing Thai curry) and gone (bearing assurances that Harry would
Harry makes a sound not unlike a growl and spins on his heel. “I don’t want to know this, you bitch!” He stomps (or maybe staggers) his way to the kitchen, with Pansy clicking at his heels.
She said all this in a smooth, unaffected tone, but those dark eyes betrayed her. “I regret it. I was an idiot child, and I regret it, and I’ll never be able to atone. And yet.” She thinned her lips. “I am sorry, Harry Potter.”
“I don’t know how it is,” Harry admitted, frown deepening. “Do you often get turned away from stores?”
“That’s not true, anyway,” Harry argued, rather proudly. “I saw it on the BBC.”
“I don’t think James intended any harm, directly, but he wasn’t put off by the possibility.” She sighed, and adjusted her glasses on her nose. “That worries me.”
“How’s Sam?” Harry asked.
Moaning Myrtle disappeared into the nearest toilet cubicle with a morose (and moaning) gurgle. At least no one used this bathroom anymore, so the water she flooded his shoes with was clean. For a loose definition of ‘clean.’
“Curious minds want to know!” she insisted, unrepentant.
“I’m sure you will,” Neville interjected. Lakshmi made an odd, grumbly sound from her desk. Felicity grinned.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Okay. I promise not to give her a hard time about Parkinson.” Ron put on his innocent eyebrows, which made Harry roll his eyes. “That’s why you’re talking to me, isn’t it? Instead of your wife?”
Harry sent a final Patronus to Ron, “Sorry, mate. I know Mione wants to debrief tomorrow afternoon, but I have to run up to Hogwarts for the weekend. James is in some kind of trouble. I’ll Floo you when I know more. Can you send an Owl to Luna’s office for me, care of Sol Eisenberg? I’m supposed to meet with him tomorrow afternoon. Talk soon!”
“Should we watch the new
“I’m all right, Ron,” he told him.
“Perhaps,” she hedged, “but you and Ron both tend to cut him up whenever we mention the subject of our school days. Lee and George join in, though heaven knows why—they barely knew him then. It must be difficult for Al, to think you all hate his best friend’s father.”
“…Right.”
THE EMERGENCY RELEASE FUND
The words were on the tip of his tongue—the
Harry was kicking himself for that now. He could’ve used the distraction.
Al nodded against Harry’s shoulder, and then stepped away. “I’ll send Owls.”
“And that’s another thing!” Harry announced suddenly, crossing his arms. “How d’you even
“No, Harry, just wait—”
“What?” Harry said, a bit dumbly.
“My hoard?” Harry chokes out. He almost laughs. “Draco’s not a

“Potions. Tugwood’ll have to brew them.”
Albus walked through the steamy station with his hands in his pockets, shoulders up around his ears. Of all the Potter kids, it was Al who’d suffered the most from the media, growing up. Especially after he Sorted into Slytherin. Harry wondered what it felt like to Albus, having James pull the focus for terrible reasons. Harry was too chickenshit to ask.
“Oh, Harry!” Audrey smiled, though it went a bit wonky. “How are you doing, love?”
Ron and Parkinson were deep in the middle of an argument. Harry could feel the tingle of Hermione’s strong Silencing spell, a bubble of magic wrapped around the room. Hestia and Flora held hands, almost like children, and Millie refilled both their cups with a quiet Aguamenti. Mione’s parchment spilled over with neat little notes.
“I barely made it through the corridor, before they sealed up the path to Hogsmeade. I thought Augusta Longbottom might send me back to the fight.”
Sol nodded. “That’s good. It’s good that you know that. You want to come in on Sunday, the 15
“Hello, Dad,” his son muttered. Brown eyes grew wide. “Teddy! What’re you doing here?”
YOU are the story. WE are the story. Harry Potter doesn't need her anymore, and neither do we.
“He’s my closest friend,” she agreed, snapping her connection to Harry with a shrug. “We’ve known one another since we were infants.”
“One problem at a time,” Teddy advised, plunking a sausage onto Harry’s plate.
with anyone else in the room. He’d have tried to force Greg and Vincent out.”
“He mentioned that you haven’t consulted him, Harry,” she said carefully. “He is the prevailing expert in combining Muggle medical treatments with Magical healing.”
“Don’t tell him about the
“You already knew,” she says, damnably calm. “As if Draco Malfoy could have sex with a wizard who wasn’t you? The press would know before he managed to cum.”
Last year, Ginny smiled at every camera, chatted to every Quick-Quotes Quill. She did that, sometimes, especially when the Harpies were having a strong season. Ginny liked to talk, liked having her picture taken. Harry used to wonder how much of it was real, and how much she was doing to divert attention from himself. He loved her for it.
“What does that mean?” he prompted instead. Malfoy's lips twitched.
Lily thought hard for a moment, then nodded, “I guess so.”
“You’re in the right place,” Flora smirked.
“Hey, Ted,” Ron greeted him. “Where’s the old man want us working?”
“Not at all. He always goes through Ella Flint when we need a consult.”
“Malfoy and I are

It wasn’t the first time Harry’d thought about Time Turners.
raindrops.
He could have made sure Remus Lupin took his Wolfsbane Potion.
“‘Course I’m coming, Harry, don’t be daft.” Teddy stood up again and rubbed hard at his eyes. “Let me send George an Owl, and I’ll get packed. You need me to run out for anything, before we go?”
First of the Slytherins to arrive were Millicent Bulstrode—broad, busty, black hair in a messy, pageboy haircut—and Flora. Harry often thought they should’ve looked mismatched, with Flora’s willowy limbs and nervous expression, but the effect was more complementary than contradictory. Millie had a large arm wrapped around Flora’s slim waist.
Ron nodded, “Black cat crossing my path.”
she wanted to know.
“She’ll do right by you.”
“Chin up, Dogfather,” Teddy mumbled, grinning mouth full of fangs he’d grown himself half an hour ago. He had to sip his spiked butterbeer through a bendy straw.
“Have we, Potter?” Pansy wondered, with a sardonic lift of one eyebrow. “Have I?”
Malfoy glanced over at him. “Because unicorn horns are so easy to imitate?”
James pounded his cane into the concrete floor defiantly, daring anyone to mention it. The sound of it echoed off brick walls. Muggles, for the most part, ignored James’s limp in public. Wizards weren’t comfortable with problems that magic can’t fix.
“Yeah. Yes. Please.”
Malfoy stared at him for a long, tense moment. Then he said, wonderingly, “You honestly don’t. You have no idea.” He snorted his frowning approximation of a laugh. “That’s rather punctured my ego, if I’m honest.”
“I am not a child!” Harry shouted. “I don’t need a

life. But... " She sighed. "You aren’t a child. You’re a grown man, and Head Auror. A father. The foolhardiest option…” Her smile slipped. “It’s easier to risk one’s life when one feels quite entirely alone.”
And the one swinging a Beater’s bat, laughing with George? That’s James, isn’t it?
“Auror Morris.”
“Oh!” Arthur’s face lit up behind gold spectacles. “Ron! Wonderful! And…”
Harry felt his mouth flap open and shut a few times before he managed: “Sure?”
“Of course,” Hermione answered her son, with a nervous glance Harry’s way. “Let’s say hello. We’ll just be a minute.”
When the door to Harry’s office closed behind Ron, it took him a few minutes too long to pull his head from his hands.
Harry shrugs, wiping the tears and snot from his face with his sleeve. “He knows how I feel about this place.”
“Harry?”
, but they were our family, and I betrayed them. Not soon enough.” Millie pressed her forehead to Flora’s temple. Hestia swiped at tears spilling over onto red cheeks.
Harry frowned. “What the hell does that mean?”
Harry and Ron made their way through the crowd to Arthur, who was trying to make out an order form written in what looked like ancient runes. “How’s it going, Dad?” Ron shouted.
Keep yourselves safe for me. Always always always.   XOXO, Earnest
As color flooded Malfoy’s cheeks and the corner of his mouth twitched, Harry’s stomach decided to exit his body through his own throat. His heart might follow, if it pounded any harder. Only two decades of giving speeches and interviews and Wizengamot testimony prevented him from collapsing in a mortified heap. Draco Malfoy didn’t have Veela allure. He had something far scarier, far more compelling:
“I have. But I’ll make sure he hears me, this time.” Hermione sipped her tea, then wrinkled her nose. She tapped it, and a wordless charm returned the cup to steaming. Harry never remembered to do that. “Anyway, I did have a reason for invading your house first thing on a workday morning.”
“It would... Well,” Hermione spoke up carefully. “It would be good to know your reasons. To have an explanation. For the book.”
It was the voice, more than his looks, that made Harry uncomfortable. Malfoy hadn’t spoken for six months after his release from Azkaban; that was common knowledge, widely reported. When he finally managed it, his voice was… damaged. Lower, hoarser, with a rattling quality when he tried to raise the volume too high. It wasn’t an unpleasant voice, not at all, unless you knew how much it’d changed. Harry had no idea what happened to Malfoy’s vocal chords while he served his term in Azkaban, but the damage was irreparable. Two decades later, the sound still sent a shiver down Harry’s spine.
“I’m not sure of the time, yet, but I think…
“Erm, I suppose… I didn’t sleep well,” Harry admitted. “Or… at all, really.”
“Really? I can’t imagine you’ll hate Hogwarts. It’s excellent!”
Harry sighed. “Probably not. Go on,” he told the children, “out the back. I’ll speak to Scorpius’s mum, and meet you in a minute.” Albus scowled, dark brows meeting over a copy of Harry’s straight nose, but he let himself follow obediently behind his little sister as she dragged along his bemused best mate.
“In new ways, or..?”
Pansy still hasn’t responded. Harry’s question hangs in the air like fog.

Parkinson licked red lips. “Do I have time for an espresso?”
furious. But I can’t make him read it in every window of Diagon Alley!
Hermione grinned at him, a bit impishly. “Draco Malfoy, of course.”
, would Draco?
“And what do you imagine the Slytherin plot is this time, Ron? World domination by way of caramel macchiato?”
“Were you homesick when you got to Hogwarts?”
He slapped blindly at the bedside table until he located his glasses, shoving them onto his face with enough force to sting the bridge of his nose. He squinted at the clock. 9:02 AM.
“Well, he was vitriolic,” Pansy admits. “The things he said… Hmm. It was brutal.”

personal electronics, that is, which still wasn’t typical. A cellular phone wasn’t like a toaster or a washing machine or even a television. It was a very complex bit of Muggle technology, and keeping it working around magic was finicky business. And within the grounds at Hogwarts? Most people didn’t bother. Harry didn’t.
She shook her head, grinning. “You didn’t even notice.”
Parkinson cracked a helpless laugh. “There wasn’t a power on this Earth strong enough to convince Draco to kill

she argued back. “We both do.”
Harry stiffened again in his seat. “What? Why?”
“I did. Franklin.” Harry ruffled his hair and sighed. “Asked me to dinner on day three.”
. To be surprised.”
Ginny got a letter, too. Harry asked her, more than once, what Malfoy had written. She never said. There were a lot of things Ginny never said, and now she never would.
“Any time, Harry. Any time. Now quit sitting around here, and go eat something.”
,” Hermione laughed.
“For the first time in—Merlin, I don’t know, Mione! What good would it do?”
“I sincerely think my own kids believe Neville, Ginny, and Seamus are the real war heroes, and their mum and I spent a year camping in the woods.”
“Are you?” Pansy wonders with a curious head tilt. “That’s not the word I’d use. Protective, I think. Or even
“Erm, yeah.” Harry licked his lips. “Cheers.”
I lost house points, but don’t freak out! It was stupid. Just an argument that got too loud. Neville didn’t even give me detention.
She shot him a narrow look. “My plan?”
“Fuck. Never mind.”
She rolled her eyes. “I’m still proud to be a Parkinson, Potter, so don’t trouble yourself. You’re as uncouth as ever, I see.”
“You know…” She paused, looking thoughtful. “Draco might have a few suggestions for how to better manage James’s pain.”
“Scorpius? Umm… well, yeah? Bit obvious, mate. What wit’ the—” He waved a hand in the vicinity of his head, then squinted hard. The fangs receded. “Even if he isn’t, like, glowy.”
Harry held her gaze, and his notorious temper, until the atmosphere in the room seemed to thicken with malice and magic. Parkinson didn’t look away.
Hermione sniffed primly. “As I’m sure no one here intends to spill one another’s secrets, we needn’t worry about that.”
Harry was halfway to the Gryffindor Common Room when Malfoy intercepted him in the bustling corridor—because of
For all the risks Harry took, back then, those words were a leap too far.
“All right then,” Harry said agreeably. “You want some toast while you tell me about it?”
“I’ve never heard one word about Malfoy having affairs,” Harry offered. “Have you?”
thing finally cracks Harry’s ribs open at the kitchen table. He sobs. It’s messy, and noisy, and so completely unlike him that he thinks he might’ve actually lost his fucking mind.
She kept her eyes on her work. “Hmm?”
“Let’s go over the plan again on the walk over, shall we?” Her hair was finished, and she had a thick stack of parchment in both hands.
Harry turned his back to the avidly watching dining hall, closing off their conversation behind a quick Muffliato. “Had a meeting with the Headmistress about James. But nothing to worry about.”
Her flickering face went pinched. “Nothing, actually. He was not the victim.” She drew a crackling breath. “James was the aggressor, I’m afraid.”
“Yes, Harry?”
He shuddered.
“I’m sure he’s just running behind,” Harry said, and Teddy rolled his eyes.
People probably described Harry that way, too, which was a deeply unpleasant realization. “I must not tell lies,” he mumbled. His right hand flexed. Millie grunted in agreement.
“Hello Potter. And hello Teddy.” Malfoy leaned in the open doorway, arms crossed. He was dressed for the outdoors—for the rainy walk to Hogwarts, no doubt—in heavy black boots and a waxed canvas cloak. His beard had a few droplets caught in it, sparkling like diamonds.
“Okay,” Harry nodded, watching his son very closely, “but you know what did.”
“Thomas and Finnegan only adopted their daughter a year ago. How did Dean Thomas befriend
Later that night, Hermione’s house seemed very empty without Ron in the kitchen and Rose stretched out on the living room rug. Harry joined the Weasleys at the Burrow for the annual school sendoff luncheon, which ran (as usual) long into the evening. After, he followed his best friend home like a lost kneazle.
it’s not fair to Albus. And, most importantly, it’s not fair to Draco.” Her eyes opened, and they were so, so sad. “I know you don’t want to hear that.”
Harry shot her a speculative look. “What do you know?”
“Oh. Nice one.”
“Erm,” Harry pulled his hand away, confused. “My work? As an Auror?”
No one seems to be keeping score, and no one seems worried about that.
“Louis is a terror,” Ted declared grandly. “Even ‘fore he could talk, he could just
Harry wished, for Hermione’s sake, that it had calmed down after that. Harry and Millie rejoined the group, who apparently kept talking while they took their smoke-and-shake break. Parkinson flicked her eyes Millicent's way, looking uncharacteristically abashed. Hermione gave Harry a quick pat to the shoulder before diving back in with her quill.
“Ready for Hogwarts, Artemis?” Scorpius asked.
“You know, there’s a very effective antidote potion on the market now. You can take it preemptively, which is quite clever. We’ve been stocking them in the women’s shelters. Tastes like almond cake.”
He’d been more openminded, after that.
“A what?” Pansy sounds puzzled.
Harry’s throat closed. His back went rigid. He blinked. Blinked. Tried to swallow.
Harry let out a long breath and hooked his hands behind his head. “You’re right, of course.”
Definitions should be more definite, probably.
He could have told the whole country about Pettigrew’s deception.
“Of course,” Harry said faintly.
Ron snorted. “I have more O.W.L.s than you, and better hair.”
Harry hesitated, taking a swig from his coffee. “Yeah, I guess so. Is that bad?”
“My parents weren’t Death Eaters.” Millie wore a deep frown. “None of the family. I didn’t know for certain, one way or another, ‘til the Summer after fifth year.”
Harry cut himself off, but not soon enough. Not nearly.
been spoiled, after all. Agree with Malfoy, or be kind to him?
“Is that what you saw?”
“‘Course. I’d love to.”
“More than sometimes, mate.”
“Will do, Headmistress. See you for supper.”
She sent him a stink-eye. “They’ve warded the pipes.”
“For heaven’s sake, I don’t think you’re being a baby. No one thinks that!”

“They’re potions, and they’re prescribed by a Healer, and I followed the instructions on the label, so bugger off.” He grimaced. “Please, and maybe thank you.”
Trigger warning for discussion of queer identities, and debate over whether to come out publicly.
It was Luna’s third career, but it looked like she’d finally found her calling. She often said,
“But, as you said: Draco isn’t jealous. Not really.”
“Yes! Not that there was really any question,” Scorpius prattled as the color returned to his cheeks. “I’ll visit Mother every week, of course, in the Summers, and we’ll organize the holidays together. Vikram and Father have some scheme for after the baby is born, splitting their time at home to help Mother while she recovers.”
“You want me to order some of those little sandwiches for the tea trolley? The ones with the sesame seeds?”
James snarled. “I didn’t touch him!” Whatever composure he’d been holding onto with white knuckles disintegrated in front of Harry.
“I know what you all think of me. Of what I’ve done.”
“It… might.”
Harry’s heart sank. “Ted. You didn’t tell me.”
Flora nodded. “When the Death Eaters reconvened, my father declared his neutrality. He wanted to take the family out of the country, but my aunt and uncle accused him of cowardice. They called him a blood traitor. He was afraid to push things any further, so we stayed.”
Neville blushed, though he didn’t look embarrassed. “I feel a bit like I already do. Not that it’s the same, mind! I know it’s worlds different. But I get them for ten months a year, for seven years. All the little triumphs and heartbreaks.” He looked back at Harry with a shrug. “I feel guilty about that, sometimes. That I get to be here, and you parents don’t.”
“I’m very well, thank you.” She put a hand against her stomach, and Harry couldn’t help looking. He didn’t see any evidence of a baby bump yet; her dress was rather voluminous.
“There is no reason you should be,” Parkinson said, sounding sincere. Her face was still strangely unmoved. “Which makes me wonder why you need to be under an NDA to speak about your sexuality at all.”
“No!” Harry and Hermione both gasped.
The shadow glides around, out of the glare, and smirks.
The staff table was only half-full. McGonagall sat in the middle, cutting a slice of ham into neat little squares.
“We have a minor infestation of flesh-eating slugs in the garden. The combination of peaches and muscovado sugar should prove appealing enough.”
South Africa, he’s probably in a wicked mood. Try two drops of shrivelfig extract in his tea after breakfast. It works every time.
, Harry Potter! I will put you in the

“He’s an
, the Marked Boy himself? If the Dark Lord had asked for Draco’s life in exchange for the lives of every man, woman, and child at Hogwarts that day... would you have made that trade?”
“Nice to see you, too, Scorpius,” Harry cut in when the blond paused for breath. “You’re welcome for dinner, if your parents are all right with it.”
Pansy met her gaze steadily. Her cheeks were pale and her eyes shone too brightly. “The Dark Lord would know, Hermione. He always knew.”
“He knows that
“Yes.”
“Murder of crows.”
: deranged. Was that Harry, these days? And Dumbledore always? Was that their common language?
“Yes, of course. But I was referring to your spectacular feats of bravery during the war!”
Lily hurried back to the Gryffindor table, where she was immediately bombarded with whispered questions. Artemis and Louis, both decked out in gray and green, carried over their plates and slid into seats next to Lily.
McGonagall frowned, but said, “If you must.”
Harry
“Biased, yes. Not blind. If you got it up for anyone else, he must be
(That was a lot of command, as it happened.)
“You didn’t. I did.”
“Please tell me Hermione’s interviewing some from our side, too.”
“I know you’re doing the Sad Dad thing about your little girl starting Hogwarts. I get it. But think: No more Albus stomping about the place. It’ll be like banishing a boggart!”
“Cheers,” Harry nodded. “I’ll see you up there.”
Harry smiled. “All good, Ted. Thank you.”
“Bit crowded, don’t you think?” he muttered. He pushed his glasses back up his nose.
She shook it heartily. Her fingers were unexpectedly callused. “Call me Felicity, please. I’m such a fan of your work, you know.”
“You were there, too, Pansy,” Millie muttered.
Harry left the Ministry early with Ron at his side. His brother-in-law was leaving for Sweden the next day, but he insisted on a few hours wrapping purchases. The International Portkey left brutally early, and he hadn’t stopped complaining about it all day.
Millicent nodded. “My mum’s Muggleborn.”
For a wild moment, he thought it was Salazar Slytherin speaking. Well, the statue, anyway. He watched it, suspicious, until the voice sighed once more.
. I can
“Really?” Al perked up. “Which games?”
Hermione’s letter came near the end of the year. She only said, “It’s enough.”
“Well. I understand James’s unexpected interest in potions.”
“I see McLaggen,” James grunted nearly immediately. “I’ll be back.” He took off without his trunk, head down, hood still covering gingery hair. A Notice-Me-Not, like all deceptive magic, broke down when you crossed the barrier onto the platform. People made way for James with pity in their eyes. Harry wanted to hex them all
“We can’t talk about this?” Millie frowned. “To anyone?”
“It’d have been a blood bath,” Millie nodded. “Death Eaters could’ve walked through the front doors, stepped right over the carnage. If the Dark Lord weren’t determined to kill Potter hisself, it would’ve been over before it ever began.”
“Oh! Lovely! Yes, please!”
Harry knew that Sol Eisenberg wasn’t a Legilimens. He’d run a full background check on Sol before he agreed to regular therapy sessions. Still, it was strange how much the older wizard seemed to know him. To know what Harry needed to hear. It was like speaking to Dumbledore, sometimes.
“I haven’t met him,” Harry admitted.
“You mean handsome and heroic, I think.”
, this one stupid,
Harry frowned. “She’s been saving my fan mail in her desk.”
“I got the girl,” Harry smiled, a bit sadly.
“At least a year, I should think. I’ve never written a book before.”
. At the expense of any other children. Powerful magic requires powerful sacrifice—you know that better than most.” His eyes flicked to Harry’s forehead, but didn’t linger. “The Blacks managed two sons, Sirius and Regulus, though I’ve heard it made Walburga quite unhinged.” Malfoy’s frown lines deepened. “My parents put all their eggs in one spoiled basket.”
“Well, yes, but I should’ve left well enough alone for tonight.” She watched him pull on his jacket. “If Ron were here…” She sighed. “He’s so much better at this sort of thing.”
Spinnet chewed on the inside of her cheek to hide a smile. “I know what you’re doing, Potter. I cannot be bribed.”
“Of course, Albus. What’ll it be for you, Scorp? The special?”
“I’m here, never fear!” George announced, vaulting the counter to half-hearted applause. “You’re a useless employee, Hazza. You’ve barely been here the hour.”
“Yes, please,” Teddy said. Harry nodded.
“Does he ‘give back’ when Granger has a go at him?” Pansy wonders, still sneering.  “Or George Weasley?
James didn’t respond to that, but he leaned all the way back in his seat. Teddy patted him twice on the knee, rising to his feet with a wince. He sat down in the chair to Harry’s right, sipping his tea. Then he said, “How do you break that Curse? True Love's Kiss?”
Harry’s throat clenches, but he admits: “She definitely wasn’t Draco.”
Harry dug a smile out of somewhere.
“Yeah?” Artie scoffed. “
“Pansy,” Millicent said calmly.
The entrance hall had been rebuilt, with muscle and magic, into a near-perfect replica of its pre-Battle grandeur. Two decades of hard use gave it the illusion of history. Stone floors echoed against plaster walls, lined floor-to-ceiling with whispering portraits (some restored, and some repainted). Hundreds of candles filled the space with warm light and the scent of beeswax. It should’ve been comforting, Harry always thought, but it still made him melancholy. It was so close, nearly perfect, but it wasn’t the same. As they bypassed the Great Hall, continuing down the corridor toward the headmistress’s office, Harry kept his eyes forward. He had no desire to get caught up at the Memorial Wall.
And it looked, for a few moments, like Teddy was going to agree with him. To placate him, maybe. His eyes—flicking from Harry’s face to his scarred, wandless hands—were unbearably soft. Tender.
“All set for the schoolyear, Lily Luna?” Harry’s brother-in-law wanted to know, adjusting silver spectacles on his long nose. Percy wore a three-piece suit under his Ministry robes, and sweat had gathered at his hairline.
I always love when they start like we’re close, personal friends.”
“You can discuss our meeting today, and the book, and your own history, of course. But you won’t want to discuss what you learn from other participants.”
“A reason? Do you lot need one? I’m fairly sure Angelina wouldn’t have minded if I’d been away from home, actually. I think the password on my front door is
Madam Pomfrey ducked her head out of the office. “Spindle Curse, you say?” The woman had the ears of a House-elf.
Harry,
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged, although he doubted it was convincing. “It seems like a therapy thing to do.”
Professor McGonagall did not seem surprised at his return. That was lowering, because Harry had no reason whatsoever to be visiting her office again today. He was sure he’d been an unpredictable child, once upon a time.
“I already know about thestrals, Dad.”
Love you all. Stay safe and shiny!
“So, it seems to me,” Sol remarked, as if it were inconsequential, “that Lily is feeling very sad and upset. You, however, don’t agree with her reasons.”
. That’s Draco, isn’t it?
“That’s amazing! Before you were even
We're deviating from Pottermore/Cursed Child canon here. I'm as happy as I'm going to be with this--it's difficult not to pad it out with information Harry shouldn't have yet. If you get a second, reread the chapter "The Battle of Hogwarts" from Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows, to see events from Harry's point-of-view.
Harry had never met anyone who spoke with quite so many exclamations.
her,” Harry spat, baffled. “I don’t do that. Anymore.”
, as you might expect. Astoria never planned to have more children, but it wasn’t worth the risk.”
They’d know, and they’d say the word for him. They do that. If Harry had the balls to Floo any of his friends in the last two weeks, or this morning. If he weren’t an utter, utter coward.
50 Sekforde Street in Farringdon is actually the address of an Australian restaurant called Granger & Co. That was too funny not to use.
“Good thing, I guess,” Harry said. At the women’s raised eyebrows, he snorted. “Well, she married Zabini. That’d be awkward, don’t you think?”
“Even better.”
“You’re falling asleep again. On your kitchen table.”
Her husband hadn’t slept more than a few hours in days, so he patted her back listlessly and made a sympathetic sort of hum.
“I know,” Harry said. “Tough break.”
“You were there, before the final battle,” he told her. “I remember you.”
“Still what, Harry?”
Anyway, that was good. Harry was pants at foreign languages.
“Why?” Millicent asked, crossing thick arms over her large chest.
“He helped us move everyone to the Hogsmeade corridor, and then he hung back, to make sure no one attempted to use the Cabinet,” Pansy went on. Her eyes were unfocused and her expression bleak. “I still can’t believe the thing hadn’t been destroyed already. I suppose the Dark Lord forbid it."
“I’m aware,” Harry replied, bagging up a young witch’s Skiving Snackbox.
Harry eyed his best friend with amusement. “Came up with that on her own, did she?”
“I really don’t,” Harry frowned.
Harry thought there were flaws in that logic, but he couldn’t nail them down. Instead, he grumbled as they made their way back to the table, “Only Slytherins would invent proper methods for loathing people.”
“The kids, too,” Harry muttered.
“Can I bring Ted?” When McGonagall’s eyebrow went up, he explained, “Teddy’s been helping a lot with James, since the accident. I think it’d help.”
“Right, yeah. Of course, she is.”
Hermione exhaled, shutting her eyes. “To Teddy. To Luna, and Andromeda, and Neville. We all have to act like we hardly know the man! You
Harry turned. Shards of broken bottle had embedded themselves into the wall, sunk deep through the violet paper.
“Who’s Graham?” Ron said, taken aback. Harry nearly asked the question in stereo, but bit his tongue just in time.
“Yes, yes, Felicity, a Spindle Curse. You’re familiar with the common remedies, one assumes?” Madam Pomfrey said in her crisp, professional voice.
“I’m not telling that story more’n once, Golden Boy.” The smile slid away, until Millie was shrewd and stoic again. “Come inside. Loathe Pansy properly. It'll make you feel better.”
“He’s Welsh.”
“Thank you, Sol.”
Harry blinked. “Oh. Really?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t want reminders,” he snapped back. “I don’t want to think about—”
“I wonder what it was like for Albus,” Sol pressed, unflinching, “to be demonized by his mother, however briefly.”
“Malfoys shouldn’t glow like angel babies,” Harry said. He was confident about that.
“Ah.”
I'm worn to pieces, myself, but did you want to pop in for breakfast tomorrow? You should've seen the second leg of that race, mate! Brutal! Come by, I'll tell you about it.
“I still don’t understand why we have to do this in a public place,” Ron said as they crossed another side street. “Feels fishy.”
“Oh, of course. Because Graham was an
“I never get visitors anymore. I have to do the visiting.”
Hermione quirked a small smile. “Of course.”
The gravelly voice from the doorway wasn’t precisely familiar, but it was unmistakable. It sent a short, sharp thrill down Harry’s back. Harry was scowling before he’d even turned around.
In the year after Azkaban, during the first fifth of his house arrest, Draco Malfoy wrote apology letters. Dozens and dozens of them. He’d written more than a letter a week, to be sure.
“I survived the Killing Curse. Twice.”
“Rose and Hugo will be so excited,” Harry said. “Their mother’s name on a
“I don’t know, do I?” Harry groused. “Hermione says most rare ingredients do have substitutions—”
“Mmhmm.”
“I’m very exciting. Not sure how you missed it.”
Harry should offer to take her cloak, spell the mud from her shoes—all the tiny acts of wizarding hospitality that Draco has been trying, in vain, to teach him for over a year.
“We were wondering, Felicity,” McGonagall called, drawing everyone’s attention. “Can we substitute a Muggle treatment for the prescribed Wideye Potion? Poppy’s not comfortable with the potential for a billywig-jobberknoll interaction.”
Madam Pomfrey bustled out of the storeroom, arms full of blankets. “Whomever is doing the brewing, I don’t think it’s wise to stand around while there’s work to be done.”
“No,” Harry agreed. “You aren’t. I know.”
“Goyle?”
Several hours later, Harry was seated in an empty classroom near the hospital wing with Teddy. They were attempting to wrangle Harry’s unopened correspondence—Ron sent it over via the headmistress’s Floo. Teddy scanned the fan letters, while Harry dealt with anything more professional.
“Mostly. He left at noon to take Victoire out to lunch.”
He wants to delay—to watch her walk away into the inky November night. To sit in his depressing kitchen, drinking firewhiskey. To
“I don’t really care,” Harry lied. Hermione huffed, and hit pause on the remote.
“Mione!” Harry cut in. “Go back to work.”
