It is, and I’m having them spend the night here at Grimmauld. I don’t want them going back to that flat if possible. Definitely not Lucy.
Our readers may not know that changes have come to our honored publication. With the upcoming retirement of our publisher and other negotiations ongoing, more change is to come.
Okay I’ll admit we think it’s funny too. I just don’t want it to get out of hand. Jon is going to get mad. He’s only allowed to practice at school.
I bought the building. If Ron doesn’t want it we can lease it out. I’m not joking this wizard neighborhood is in demand.
I want the bats to fly between the daisies smoothly. I’ve almost got it but one of the daisies sits a little low. I think I’ll compromise and shorten the rod.
“JUST KIDDING! We’ll have all of the additional desks up and ready in the chamber when we meet in three weeks. Next up is Zebb! Is Astra here to witness?”
In future, please identify Mr. Elliot correctly. And take note that Hugo is also employed by Mr. Potter as chief foundation legal counsel and consultant.
Just bring yourselves and make sure you don’t arrive before your Dad is out of the house. I’ll give the “all clear” in the morning.
“Probably should. I need to get a copy of that to the lawyers too. I haven’t spoken to them yet. That’s going to be an ordeal.”
“The chandeliers from Harry’s vault. I’m having them cleaned today. There are seven. We’ll put the larger one right above the entrance. That will look nice from the street. They will actually be very nice cleaned up, look at this test spot. . . . .silver was always the Black signature, and the cut of the crystal is lovely and simple. I think they called these coffin prisms, or stones . . . .  probably Turkish . . . . . you can see they were hand cut . . . . . . . . The display cases should arrive tomorrow. I hope to have the interior done by then too. Once that’s in place then we can concentrate on product placement. I’m thinking we group the shampoos and conditioners along the wall to the left with the accompanying body washes in a line below. . . . .The hand and face soaps on the right?”
We’ll have to have the guys do a temporary magic plumbing job on some bathrooms for the dinner meeting. . . . .Okay so we move your office to the Centre and you to the penthouse. Start packing your bags roomie!
If the Statuario marble becomes more an issue maybe use the Calacatta, but don’t downgrade to the Carrara. If that’s the case it can wait.
STAY AWAY! Your kitchen will be ready in a few hours. Jerry’s already started building the wall. His guys are FAST. What are you and Al doing?
“So if you pull them apart like so . . . . . . see . . . . . identical. The movement of one always mirrors the other.”
Agreed. But you haven’t even talked to Ron and George about it. You should do that first. They might turn down the project and then this whole conversation is moot.
“I should tell Louis he can bring whoever he wants over there too. He definitely should show Bill and Fleur. Gareth and Danika too.”
“Then it’s already done at your place . . . . . YES! You made it! Such a big girl. Oh we are going to have fun today. . . . . . She’s VERY proud of herself!”
Okay, back to business: I have an idea that I’d like to run past you concerning a wedding gift for Al and Scorp.
“The home seems to be accommodating. . . . Over in that corner, I believe that is the cauldron from your kitchen fireplace. It’s rusted.”
“The whole team is going purple for the meet on Wednesday. We’re not the only ones who can get away with looking this fantastic.”
“You listen to me Ron Granger-Weasley. These are the rules. You take the driving lesson with Grayson. No speeding. You’ll learn to make a proper stop. . . . . got it?”
“This is quite a spread. Is that Zebb’s roast beef? Oh yes, start carving that splendid creation right now.”
And his paintings have always acquired a following among collectors in both the magical and muggle worlds but his new works have caused a buzz. Particularly in the Muggle circles.
Another thing to consider is the year of restoration. We know that Walburga Black did her alterations in 1952 but we’re not sure what was done in the interim between the time she inherited the property from her parents in 1946 and 1952. You may want to have the ritual done based on 1946. I was able to do some research.
Yes they are waiting their turn for deliveries. They must be pleased with the accommodations. They’re a very proud breed. How is that working out?
“Jay can’t just appear a bus into the middle of a Muggle street. And this thing definitely won’t fit in the carriage house. He had to get a special parking thing. . . .I had to pick it up at Gringotts and drive it here. Driving this thing through the tunnel under Gringotts was a little tight but look! . . . .Jay had it all fixed up. The steering is good even though it’s on the left and it’s a manual transmission so it’s easy.”
We think Draco would like it, but if not, please bring a guest. Wizards box opens an hour early and refreshments are included.
We’re having our conference at Grimmauld end of summer. Same time as the Snape exhibit that Harry and Louis are planning. I’d like you to join.
“Well guys, it looks to me like we’re done for the day. Should we all head to Diagon? Meet at Gringotts? Would you rather have coffee or ice cream?”
“I have one baking speciality and that’s it. Biscotti. You bake wedding cakes for Merlins sake. Give me this one!”
“Let’s set out some of the chocolate chip and ginger ones, then leave the rest boxed up for everyone to take home with them? The vanilla ones?. . . . .let’s give those to Cib for our friends upstairs? Save out a few of those for Victoire and Dominique to try, but I don’t think they’ll even care for them much.”
“No. This is a whole new program and Mungo’s isn’t equipped. So we’re building an off-site facility. Well . . . . we are if you approve.”
“I’m kind of drawn to it because it’s called out separate from the others. My Grandmothers retreat? The others sound so removed or distant. Like Potter Manor seem ominous. But that Lodge is in such a remote place. And as it turns out probably the most current after all.”
“Now we can do the same with the caboose. I love this one with the deep red . . . . . see? Fits right on . . . . . now. Just needs a drop of this smoke liquid in the smoke stack . . . . . shall we try it?”
“How about the soon to be coolest GREAT grandfather shows me how to throw up some old movies for the kids?”
All you ask can, and will be arranged by our Iceland Branch in time for your visit. You will be sent the coordinates in a separate secure post after the stasis removal ritual has been performed. You are not required to attend. When you arrive you will be met by your Iceland representative who will perform another short ritual that will allow you to access the property through the wards. He will also provide a written report that explains the property more thoroughly. The protections on this property are extensive. After that time you may then invite any guests you wish.
I get what you’re saying but you should have seen them working on the park together. It’s going to be amazing if they do it. It will be so nice to be able to go out there.
“Jay has everything catalogued. It’s pretty much just copied from that. Same with the quill and fountain pen collection.”
Let’s settle this . . . . . Everyone here knows Harry is as blind as a bat without his glasses right? Well that’s not really a good way to put it because most bats actually have very keen eyesight and extraordinary hearing capabilities. So he’s as blind as a Harry. . . . .How many of you know that if I painted Harry’s nails a lovely shade of pink and took his glasses away that he wouldn’t be able to see them unless he put his fingers directly in front of his face? I do, because it happened once. So I suggest that when we vote, Harry just takes off his glasses. All in favour raise your hand. . . . . . . .okay that was easy.
I guess I’m just freaking out because of it. But I really do like him Dad. I guess I’m just afraid of what everyone’s going to think about it.
For some reason I must formally announce that I am inviting guests to view the property and temporarily break the wards. The Fidelius remains in place. We ask that guests tour in shifts. This will also help as it will hopefully look like neighbors are having some sort of party, or wake as it were throughout the day. Muggle attire is requested.
You’ll want to take advantage of that. If you need to soften it up or it’s too bright there’s a shade charm embedded in the glass. Just point your wand to the rune on the desk here like this.”
I can’t wait to meet your boyfriend! This is good news! I’m just sorry you felt you needed to keep it from us.
He once told Molly that he liked my beef stew better than hers and I’ve never heard the end of it. Molly has been on my ass for years now. It was a one time thing. I think I just added sage or something. I told her that. She will not let it go and is now convinced that I’m holding back some secret recipe. And you know I’m a terrible cook!
Don’t mind Ted. The food is AWESOME. Campfire shrimp is cool! They made a whole table of vegan things too. Vic and Dom are in heaven. It’s just starting to get dark.
Well now we’re making food for the Wizengamot meeting and she wants Trandy over here to help and to serve drinks from the wine cellar!
We’re going to go through several necessary technical procedures to start and then break for dinner. Dinner will be provided by the staff from the Harpies Centre in the Ministry atrium.
Witch Weekly readers have been very impressed with the Scorpius Malfoy-Potter line of products. Particularly the playful combination of natural scents and the quality of the results. Witches and Wizards greatly enjoy these products which have only been available to most through owl order.
How about just us? Draco’s concentrating on some long string of numbers. Will be nice to just do just us for a change. Will Hermione be mad? Maybe they can join us later?
I was half asleep and I let Harry do it. Before I knew it I was out shopping. Did you hate it? I’m going to let him do it again. It was comfortable? I’m coming to Berlin soon and you can put me in anything you want within reason from now on? Does that help? I love you, Draco.
I’m telling you that this has turned into a big deal. I cannot explain it. Everyone is down here. I knew it would go okay, but this is something else entirely. Seeing Minnie and Poppy together shopping for hair care products is just downright bizarre.
Elfs at the centre are set. They’re pretty excited actually. I brought the head chef (Peep) and the coordinator (Inch) to the manor to check out the space and kitchens. They were a little confused at first because we’re calling this event a dinner and not tea, but they’re now on board. Chef Peep was a little put out after viewing the dining hall at the manor and wanted to prepare a 12 course meal. I’ve got that down to 5 plus Hors-d'oeuvres and Post-meal drinks. Soup, Appetizer, Salad, Main and Dessert.
“Chocolate and raspberry I’ve been told. Papa Jamie is making ice cream with Scorp. You still like vanilla the best?”
Cool! If we’re not upstairs in the master I’ve got a bassinet in my train room. I’m working on my mountain!
It’s not so much about that. . . . okay it’s a lot about that, but we all like each other. Frank and Bridget get a pass and their dive was just for extra fun and doesn’t go into the official record.”
Let me review. . . . In the conservatory. Arthur Weasley will preside over the ceremony. At the fountain. Casual. Ronald Granger-Weasley. Blaise. Dinner. Only immediate family. Is that correct?
“Yes. Best day of my life . . . . That’s Ginny’s. It was a kiss on the cheek but there was no looking back after that. You can’t make them up. That’s what I want to show. . . . .Al and Jamie gave these. . . .”
“That was my Grandfather. He should be along shortly. He doesn’t normally run this late. He has his own transportation. But the koi can’t travel using that mode.”
As long as Poppy say’s it’s okay I’m fine with everyone coming over. But if I get tired I’m taking Aspen to bed with me. Plus I’m fucking hungry. Dad and Zebb have fired up the outdoor grill and are putting together kebabs and things. . .It’s ALMOST as if they planned it! Please have Uncle Ron bring some baby fireworks.
That would be nice. And provide actual transcripts of the meetings instead of relying on rumor and hearsay to the public.
Yeah, she’s completely fine. I’ll just tell her not to leave the house and if she needs anything she can always call me or Lily.
The only sympathy I have for any of the characters in this entire film is the poor dog. I’ve seen this before. The minute I downloaded and it started I knew what it was. My Grandpa Granger loves this movie. I don’t.
“We’ll have to make sure the owls are off the roof of the boutique before they set those off . . . . . And you’d better talk to Jay or someone about getting help with traffic flow. There’s going to be a crowd.”
Do that the next morning. If she argues or refuses to resign you’ll have the Auror team if necessary. Make her and her brat sweat a little overnight. They won't have access to the offices.
It’s called tough love. I know what you’re on about, but I’ve got nothing to share concerning these extraneous issues. You’re not getting anything, My darling.
Oh that’s GOOD. Al is a little less forgiving. I have told Albus that I’ve taken a “vow of secrecy”.
If anyone's interested, I've gone back through most of the earlier chapters and fixed bad inconsistencies and character mistakes and spelling. I think the timeline even matches up now.
“We need something dramatic for the wall up the stairs from the main to the entertainment level? But what would go on that curved wall?”
I’m ready to go here. Are you comfortable with the technology or would you like to go over it again?
The boys will love to meet them! We’ll take them to the broom shop and the gallery. They can see Teddy’s mural! You should have stopped by when you were in Diagon!
“That pastry is a pain in the arse. I really don’t know how she does it . . . . . Where’s Scorp? I thought he was coming with you?”
There have been some developments on that front. I’ll let Harry fill you in on that later. Okay, well I hope you have a lovely afternoon. Since I’ve got you here is there something else you’d like to inform your Son about today?
The owl delivering this post is Mr. Jordan. She is our beloved family owl. Do NOT under any circumstances deprive her of treats. She prefers biscotti to those dried rat pellets.
This is not a “cleaning up”. This is TOTAL EVERYTHING! I mean the house itself is enough but now they’re asking our opinion on countertops and floors and brushed nickel faucets what even is that???
Andrek is efficient. Yes, just sign. The team can then begin the process today. It turns out to be quite simple since they’ve done it before. You should be able to access the vehicles as early as tomorrow noon. I've arranged for curse breaker Delacour-Weasley.
No it’s not that. I’m coming! Okay give me a sec and I’ll explain. It’s going to take a minute. It’s a little difficult for me to explain and Mum and Dad are both already disappointed with me over it. I wasn’t expecting EVERYONE to be in here but that’s okay. Better to get it over with. Just a sec.
“NO? How can I be ready for my baby to become mobile?! It’s exciting, but scary as hell at the same time.”
“It’s silver oak, lined with an aromatic cedar. I had one just like it when I was in school. It’s complete with expansion charms like your bag. You should have no trouble transporting it. The weight of the box never changes no matter what you put into it. I’ve engraved Lucy Evans on the lid, It would be customary to add a middle name or initial, but I don’t know it. It can be added easily enough.”
“The test shows that this magic didn’t manifest early. It was stifled. It also shows that there was a triggering event that forced the capability to the forefront late in your childhood for a very brief period of time. This magic just became part of your being. Absorbed if you will.”
“Okay if you say so. I like it up here. It’s really so pretty even without plants. Looking out over the city lights. What is that over in that back corner behind us? Is it hidden for a reason?”
“I believe that is your favourite pepper steak. Roasted potatoes and steamed carrots. I’m having a lamb soufflé.”
“Then we do Grimmauld. Open it up and get the tour over with first. I’ve already talked with Luna. Need to go down and talk with the Historical society about it. They’ll be fine.”
“Day before yesterday. It was an accident. Wand started rolling off the counter and I just instinctively started to run to grab it and of course I’m moving too slow. . . Accio’d it across the kitchen!"
“I’ll get the shower started. And don’t worry about your fish. Cib is taking care of it. Your outfit is all ready.”
“Just carry on with Lucy like everything is normal and this is just a fun surprise for her. Draco and I will be over to pick you up in about an hour? Does that give you enough time?”
Stand between number 10 and number 14. On the sidewalk you look down. There’s a tiny metal rune embedded in a crack in the sidewalk. I’m looking at it now.
Yes. Oh I forgot. I asked Liogell to handle the letters for Grimmauld day. He said they will do that. We will have to send out an agreement before we disclose the details.
I’m sketching out the exhibit for your items. On the main end facing the front will be your wand just by itself. The introduction to the space if you will. Then just beyond that will be one long rectangular space that you can walk around. It will be positioned in the front centre of the other exhibits. On the far end will be the school robes with your old trunk at the base.
I don’t do loopholes. . . . . . No fine print allowed. If your Uncle Harry can’t read and understand it in plain language it goes back to the drawing board.”
“Unless you’re interested in hearing about how Argen Black ignored Master Largious on the solstice in 1688 for 3 or 4 hours.”
“You’ve spent all those years alone in the closed manor and can only communicate with paintings that have no real conversation skills?”
Yes, she doesn’t know much about anything magic?. It will be their first time going to Diagon too. I want to take them through the Leaky entrance.
I think I'm going to change the rating on the fic to M. I'm spending way too much time censoring the characters as they mature. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.
Grayson is going to be busy so don’t worry about getting caught. Dean is having him help with the garage.
Yes. We’ve already taken requests and told her what we would like. And today she has help. She’s doing us a favour opening up for us. It’s not going to be fancy.
“She wasn’t. Your mother’s testimony in that divorce trial is what convinced the judge to give you custody. They actually do that shite. Judy spoke out of line in that call. Those weren’t idle threats. They have a whole underground network of crazies. Most of them are followers of Judy’s father. Do you trust me?”
Other than that ritual that Goblins were doing we don’t know much about it. Was just supposed to restore the building back to an earlier date?
“Anything you want. For as long as you need it. And any time just take it off. I did quite a lot of therapy and it’s very helpful. I go in for a tune up once in a while. . . .though not so much anymore. . . . Don’t push yourself too much. If you trust her, you can go to Andi.”
Okay we’ll do that. So what are you doing now? What are the developments on La Patrona? Is Gabriela okay?
Dad said he had to put a muffling charm on the guest level. He thought there was an argument but they were all yelling answers to some quiz show on the telly.
this one is from Scorp. . . . old time large music from the potions. . . . . this one plays a big jumble of everything ever.”
“Do that and ask him about the charm. Ask if we can have Goblin assistance crews. Do you get what Jerry was saying?”
“Well then I’ll put you in satin trousers and this high neck silk shirt with this embroidered red brocade dress coat. These little black bugle beads sparkle when the light hits them.”
Yes! I’ve got the draft letter for the tenants done too. Bring it with me then? And I went down to Gringotts. Mr. Liogell says everything is good with your plan for the park. He’ll work with Jerry to bring in the crew. He would like contact information for Jerry. The charm will be altered to look like multiple stretched out canvas things. He said grommets and ropes holding it together. And NO tornadoes. There are only 46 of the units occupied by Muggles and they are pretty evenly scattered throughout the complex.
Mr. Kreacher will perform a ritual with the Gringotts representatives that allows visitors and eventual restorations to the property. At their request I have arranged for Mr. Kreacher, and the Gringotts representatives to arrive by Portkey. As the rituals must be performed at the front entrance, we will ask for volunteers to gather around the front steps with disillusionment charms between 8:45 - 9:30 to “protect the privacy of the neighbors”.
We booked you a day at the Manu park. You have a private guide for that one and no tourists to bother you!
I have an idea. I could do something like a light blue chair, like a wingback and he would stand aside it or be seated. Also a side table with flowers or something.
“And those will bring in a pretty galleon. . . . . I think I’ll donate that to the Harry Potter foundation for the protection and safety of children.”
"We don't care if you change your socks ten time a day just pick them up and send them to the basket."
I think the timing was right? Uncle Harry just gave me access to everything. And I mean really everything. And he reached out to Narcissa and the Headmistress for me. I can’t say how glad I am that you all like it.
They’ve met a couple times before, at the hurling and at the family party I think. And then he conducted the symphony. I guess he worked with Groy to write up the score?
I’m not hiring freaking Goblins to clean the place! Merlin forbid anyone visits and they cook!? Can Goblins even cook?
“I know. . . Actually if our kids did this to us I’d be pretty livid. . . .but no, I’d expect it from Lily so I’d better shut it.”
“Alright you’re all warded, charmed and monitored. What’s the incantation to deactivate it when she’s not here?”
“Are you crying? Do you like hugs? I can give you one if you want. Why do you feel sad? Davey likes hugs all the time too but right now he has Gramma Ginny hugs. I’m going to finish my floating ice cream first though okay?”
You have to admit those paisley trousers were pretty fantastic. Ron even said he looked hot. What are you going to need?
You do not. You have apparition capabilities and the floo. Plus you’ve got a fancy portkey. If you get desperate, I’ll loan you my Clam card and you can take the tube.
Well that’s flattering. I mostly just play with the colours and techniques. Sometimes it’s successful.
“I don’t know why at this point. Other than that she’s sucking me dry with the house and Lucy’s school.”
I’m going to use Draco’s new portkey. It’s supposed to deliver me to your front steps! Haven’t tried the manor yet but there’s a setting for it.
“Tears are not acceptable today, Malfoy. You’ve got some sizing to do on these uniforms. I’ve got the Harpies Centre booked for a friendly snitch match.”
“Get Snape’s wand. I’ll test it, and if it works for day to day I’ll use it. If it doesn’t, give me yours. We both know that works just fine. . . . . ”
Tell him we have a house account at the Muggle cleaners. Which is true BTW. Anything he’s questionable about goes there. Tell him it’s my responsibility to keep him looking impressive. . . “Business Expense”!!! “Cost of doing business”!!!
“How are you enjoying the hotel? It’s one of my favourites. You must try the soaking tub. Quite relaxing and romantic.”
“I like your thinking. . . . . Okay, I’ll keep the hair until morning. Are you sure you know the spell?”
“Your Father and I can work on it. If Mr. Snape would like to view the parade I’m fairly certain it can be arranged.”
#12 can be restored to its original construction (and 1843 footprint), however, this charm and ritual is the most harsh and complicated architectural restoration. Performing the charm/ritual would significantly reduce access to a Floo, as only remote conversations through the network at that time were available. All functional systems including heating, plumbing and lighting fixtures would be reduced to the original. All decorative enhancements (furniture, furnishings, wallpapers/paint, carpets, paintings etc.) are irrevocably removed leaving only the original unfinished walls, woodwork, lighting and bath/kitchen fixtures. The charm/ritual, (constructione et restituet) can only be performed by a team of 3 licensed Gringots experts and must be overseen by a Family representative. The representative most appropriate for the restoration would probably be Mr. Kreacher of Hogwarts, as he is the last living individual bonded to the home with knowledge of its original footprint and construction. The charm/ritual does not effect the building exterior or grounds.
“Danika. You’ve never pretended to be anyone that you’re not. If you did, you would have tried to change your name or something.”
OMG it’s so fucking awesome! We all have to go over there too. You will NOT recognize the place. It’s going to be so perfect for the boys. Zebb is just BUZZING! Shay fixed up her place too. Even put the old appliances from the cottage there and she’s redone everything inside with a strawberry theme!
“I will! Did Scorp like it? . . . .please leave your hair down for me today? It’s so pretty in the sunlight.”
“I remember that clearly. My godfather called me to his office the night before. He planned that whole thing out, dismissing class. He was really invested in that yule ball for some reason. Insisted that you needed guidance that Minnie couldn’t give you on dancing. I thought I was going to die when he said I would have to do it.”
“Oh. We need music. . . . .look here. . . . .this is the new KSI. Grayson and I like the almond anyone else?”
So we start with maybe two shampoos, two conditioners, maybe 3 versions of the body wash. Then I was thinking the three perfumes. The ones you make for Luna, Ginny and your Grandmother and that cologne you make for Al with the lilac.
It comes with housing and I’ve already moved out of the Leaky. And it pays good. I’m going to be an assistant. So I’ll be running errands and helping do whatever Mr. Potter needs. I’m meeting with the house manager first part of next week.
“The cabinet? Those are the memories I put away at Andi’s instruction. You can’t see those. I told Andi that I would keep them for historical purposes, but I’d really like to have them destroyed.”
“You should do so again. I’ve spoken with Mr. Liogell when we went to the vault for the chandeliers. In this situation you could certainly use the assistance. They can use their magic to produce the items three times as fast. They only need to be instructed once. They won’t deviate from the original formulas and they will be very accurate. That is built in quality control. . . . that should be a temporary situation because I know it doesn't fit with long term plans, but it would get you through the backorder crisis. . . . . Once we’ve decided on the initial inventory we’ll review the products on a quarterly basis. I’ll hand over the day to day management to one of my assistants. Probably Ms. Farley. She’s good with retail. We should probably meet with Scorpius and discuss what products we want to launch in the upcoming quarter. Perhaps some new scents. . .Definitely another shampoo and conditioner set. I’m wondering if he would be interested in developing a body powder or a de-tangler spray. . . . ”
Normally I’d say no, because Minister. Don’t say anything about either breakdowns? I really just need a fucking hug. Please.
. . . . . nobody asking questions or for your autograph. It’s very possible that I would enjoy a kiss or three . . . . . .”
“So you have the top floor. Go ahead . . . . . These will be your rooms. If it gets chilly there’s a fireplace on this little landing room but then through that door. . . . There’s another fire in here. I like that little couch in front. Do you?”
I have to meet with the muggles to perform a spell and have them sign the agreement. Every Single ONE. I need Aurors to organize it and log the paperwork. I’ll get started today but it might not be completed until tomorrow morning. At least it’s not ME cooking for tomorrows dinner!
Jay! Sorry for the text, but we’re up at the lodge making arrangements for a party. I need to get a computer up here. Do you know where the documentation for the art is for the lodge? Would it be possible to get a copy to Edward Lupin-Potter?
That was truly a sweet dive, Al. Frank and Bridget don’t get the chance to dive together very often.”
I’m a little dumbstruck. Was just about to start looking for a flat in London. It’s a lot. But no it’s not that we don’t like it. I just think I’m still a little numb. And there were a lot of tears.
“Yes. I really think it’s my new thing. I love it. I’ve listened to the duck thing at least eight times now. All of Diagon now know’s it’s my favourite song! I can’t wait for the drive home!”
“Later, it’s nothing special. Very utilitarian but functional. Mother you will want to take a look at the china cabinets.”
On second thought I might just have to ban you both from this next round of trials. Your Mother would kill me if we couldn’t reverse the effects.
Seamus will get the cabinetry ordered right away. We’ll bring a sample of what we think it will be with us based on the photograph for approval. The light color will go nice with the rest of the existing house woodwork.
YES! I’ve been calculating the difference between Wizard and Muggle real estate prices most of the day. My brain could use a decent shift.
Oh. You sneaky Wizard. YES. And as a staff member you’re allowed to ask the Headmistress and other staff to meet for beverages in my office to meet a new parent and student. If you bring me cheesecake I’ll even introduce them to the director of medical services who could give Ms. Lucy a diagnostic evaluation, if her parent agrees.
UGH. NO. With Lucy. You and Rose? I’m sorry it’s kind of an emergency and I can’t explain right now but it’s important.
“I’ve got your movies figured out. It projects from behind the screen. We’re going to try it for the kids dance party. Danika and Phillip are setting up in front of the screen. Did you see the speakers they brought?”
At 17:30 Draco and I will head over to the venue where our meeting will take place to tie up some loose ends and make sure the venue is ready for us.
I need you to know that I trust your judgment. Hugo must be very special person if you are willing to pursue this. We both know that Franklin boy was a horrible person. He will never be forgiven for what he did to you, but you deserve happiness. Don’t let that bad thing ruin good things for you.
Yes I did. It never really was an issue before because I didn’t know I owned the whole fucking complex. They’re going to be surprised. I’m sure Ron and Hermione have never mentioned anything about #12 to them. “Hey kids, meet your landlord” UGH.
“I’m doing my best. . . . . . I really am enjoying just visiting with people, but I think I’m about to go out and get some air.”
Bring in an actual Muggle to teach it. And not just one, but several experts in different fields. On a rotation.
Plaid slacks with a wide flair and three inch cuffs. I think a turtleneck will do in a matching colour. Hair?
“Please don’t. You’re a married man. And to make it worse you’re married to my Uncle. That’s just icky. And my boyfriend would be pretty mad about it too.”
“So first thing’s first. You don’t just grab it and go. You have to command it. So lay it on the ground opposite mine. This is what they will teach you at Hogwarts.”
This morning I woke up at the leaky dreading the final interview at Gringotts, figuring it would just be another let-down, and tonight I’ve not only got the coolest job but I’m settling into my new room in a house right next door to where I’ll be working. I have a key and don’t even have to use the floo. And this isn’t just a room. There’s even shelves for my books! And a view of a park. And a kitchen downstairs. I can’t explain it all today but it really is a little bit of a shock. I’ll be sharing the house with an older couple that are working here too. They’re really nice and have great stories.
“I don’t want to mess up what probably could just be a really good friendship though. AND I’ve only ever dated women, just never connected with them you know that. This is just different I think? And I only just met him AND it’s only been three days but something just clicked I think AND I’m scared AND I just don’t know. I think he likes me back?. Why ME? Why NOW?”
I can tell you who I’ve primarily chosen for the seats. In return give me your honest opinion? I’ve already told your Mum who I want so it will be no surprise to her.
“That is true. But the top floor is more private and has a balcony with a view of the courtyard. Mr. and Mrs. Brick have everything they need. It will be an adjustment for them. One of the second level bedrooms will be much larger than what they are used to. Much less the rest of the townhouse.
“I was so excited. . . . I wanted to hold his hand and hug him. And he was so fucking beautiful. . . . but then he insulted Hagrid . . . . sounded just like Dudley being a brat.”
“Do you think that Ron and George didn’t make custom fireworks for Lucy? Or for all of her classmates for that matter? They even spell out their names. George says the finale is the castle. A nice way to finish the party don’t you think?”
“Come on in. . . . . this is Grace, Allison and Tiffany . . . . . over there is Allison’s mum Janice and Tiffany’s mum Melody.”
I need “Zebb’s cottage” at Potter cottage connected for direct access to the dining room kitchen. And she needs full access to Grimmauld. Can you take care of that too?
The only problem we have so far is the dried sage. They sent Dalmatia sage and we need the Greek country of origin. The Albanian is full of sticks and is too pungent.
“Minnie’s going to retire in five years. Uncle Nev is going to take over as headmaster. Scorp and I plan on one at least one more baby after Aspen. Maybe another when she’s a little older.”
“The size will be expanded once it’s placed in the ballroom so you can move about. I’ve included this area and writing implement for you to write down formulas if you like. . . . . . . . . the third and fourth are meant for the Grandfathers’ potions lab at Grimmauld and the other at the Penthouse lab. You can consult with Draco and Scorp there . . . . . . and finally, this is a companion to one in Dad’s study, so you can chat with him there.”
“It’s HUGE, Potter. HUGE! How is Grayson going to drive this thing? And the steering wheel is even on the wrong side. This thing is a freaking import!”
“Put her in the high chair and I’ll show you. Distract her with the celery sticks, and put this bib on her.”
“So here’s the plan. Your Mum and Cel want to visit your Aunt tomorrow over in Reading. They’re staying at the Corintha. Draco will give you directions. Take them in the Bentley.”
It won’t be that bad. Penthouse is plenty big so we won’t be falling over each other unless we want to. And the kitchen will finally get used for something other than biscotti.
Uncle Harry, I’ve already turned them off for you. Whenever someone adds something to the room they get a noise on their phone or computer.
“So the image in the painting is more of a spirit or wraith. It’s written in the documents at the Manor. There’s an entire page describing what he called the ceremony and procedure used to transfer him into the painting at the time of death.”
“That would work. There’s certainly the ceiling height for it. There’s another towards the back if you don’t like the red.”
We were, but now it’s gotten a little foolish. There is even speculation that Scorpius has made perfumes for the baby.
Well he says he doesn’t see the future really. Again if true it’s more like Luna. . . .She intuitively just knows things.
First to move a carriage from storage to the front entry at the top of the drive and to help stage it and assemble attachments (wings). We will also need to return it to storage after the event.
I’ll give you my honest opinion, I promise. But I’ll be honest in my opinion that this is really weird!
“No idea, but I’m right about this. . . . . . it’s time for me to choose your outfit for tomorrow . . . . . . these yellow jeans with this cockroach print shirt from Pansy . . . . . . this belt . . . . . these rainbow socks . . . . . and the light blue boat shoes. I’m putting you in these Slytherin snake pants . . . . . . . see? I’m the only one who will know the secret of the pants.”
I’ll bring down one of those mahogany desks from the school rooms upstairs. It will look nice there and matches the paneling. Draco will approve! I’ll get him a better chair though. Those things upstairs are pretty uncomfortable after a while. Find a better desk lamp.”
I think old Barnabas is ready to retire. If he’s not he will be! I can see our first headline now: SCANDAL AT THE PROFIT! Malfoy-Potter Enterprises Expands Into Publishing - Promises SWIFT Reorganization! TOTAL SHAKEDOWN-Skeeters OUT!
“That’s a stroller. Just for in the house. I’m not taking her out anywhere, it’s just in case I need to go down to my study or something. . . .Hey look at this.”
“The computer’s all hooked up and ready to go. It’s just like Uncle Harry’s. I can make this one talk to yours next door too.”
That was part of the adjustment we did on the ritual. We keyed you into it as Lord Black. Your possessions remained intact. The updated ritual also removed any and all remnants of dark or cursed objects from the property.
None of your grandchildren. Also strict angles and cropping of others. No blurring. Photographers are getting more creative and professional. There are a few of young kids, but we asked for the parents permission to publish and to sign a release. Most were more than happy to do so in exchange for copies of the photos and shocked that we asked before publishing. Told them it’s new wizarding policy.
Mr. Malfoy (The elder) insists that there are Keepler Elfs in America that are forced into laborious positions in the trunks of trees in hidden and magical biscuit factories. We think he’s pranking us, but have assured we’ll look into it. If such elfs exist and they moved to the magical UK they would be covered by the legislation.
“Well you weren’t expecting pixie sheets either. This is more of the Prince style I think. It’s in surprisingly good condition.”
“They’re related. Mr. Brick is Kreacher’s Great-Nephew. They’re both still shocked but it’s so cool. Grayson helped them figure it out. The name came up when he was going through the old paperwork from the Grimmauld opening. Kreacher’s nephew, Brick.”
Yes. There’s no hurry. I haven’t even settled on a location. I was thinking Portugal but now maybe just open a small shop in London? I have reservations about opening up another apothecary in Diagon though. Pippin's is already good. With everything else going on it’s probably a good idea for me to change course a bit anyhow. You’re not in this alone Gramps! Remember that. I’m looking forward to spending time with grandkids as much as you!
“They’re going to stay here at night as much as an owl want’s to stay in at night and do the orders during the day. Come here whenever they need a rest. This is the home roost or nest. .
“I would hope not, but always good to know . . . . . . Last night was fun though. We broomed it to France in record time!”
We could use that. Package them to look like traditional 1920’s french potions or something. We could come up with a really beautiful diffuser for the scents.
“I agree, but Mother is determined and she loves the craftsmanship. Simple as it is they really are a delight.”
“Severus Snape. If you brought me here to explain that you were responsible for the death of my Parents, I will take these paintings and your portrait at Hogwarts and turn them into porridge. Minerva will not stop me. . . . I will then take said porridge and flush it down the toilet in a Muggle tube station. I’m not kidding. I will do it! I’ll even climb the stairs at the Hampstead station!”
“Cherubs. We can look up some of the finer points later. Of course the binder Liogell gave us is a fucking book, so much later.”
Sweetheart, I’m going to stop you right here. None of that matters. Does Eric have extra freaky fingers or something? Hideous boils?
Our kids are all happy. We had grandkids. Lily even had a boyfriend. . . . . . . . . . You let me put you in cute clothes.”
Ted. For example there’s a massive Klimt in the main floor dining and a Miro above the fireplace. There’s a theme throughout. And they’re not prints. So you understand what he means by “don’t touch” and the reason the place is so heavily warded.
“As you can see, your Uncle Al has brought out a special cauldron for the festival. I am going to supervise the special potion and help by turning the special handle crank!”
“I think just the name above the door. Simple. The pretty logo in silver on the glass. We’re going for a high end boutique look. A nice change for Knockturn. I’ve met the owner of the Pub next door. He’s very pleased to know this building is going to be occupied. . . . .nice man, you should meet him.”
Hogsmead Real Estate Associates. Near Gladrags. You should owl them first to warn them you’re coming.
“Long story, later. Let’s look at the gallery then poke your heads in the ballroom and dining room. . . .then we'll head back down. You are both going to want to see the conservatory.”
“You’re pants at those charms but I’m not. We’ll have these done in no time at all. I’d say we’d do a replication charm on them but they’re all individual aren’t they?”
“Yes. It was quite distasteful, but needed with so many guests. There’s a hidden cabinet over here on the right for the better china but in here are guest dishes.”
“I want Draco to like it. I want it to be super simple. I was thinking about just putting some edible flowers on it.”
Hi Luna . . . . . Luna, do you accept the position as the heart of the Wizengamot? The one who can be the voice of reason in a heated argument, and call me out if my ideas get too harebrained?
Account for Miss Lucy Evans. Put in 5000 Galleons to start. I’ll bring her in sometime soon. You should have her details through my Cousin Dudley?
“ . . . . .I’ve got a snitch. . . . . . Just wait ’til he comes back. He’ll catch the thing in 20 seconds, but I’ll try to surprise him with it.”
“This is where Uncle Sev came to reflect. No distractions, Just the middle of nowhere overlooking the ocean.”
We always said we’d wait until the house was done and the conservatory was the last piece. Now we can move on to other things!
I’m not either, they’re pretty ugly LOL! Don’t believe Rose caught one they had to bring out a big net and everything. It was wild.
I think I’ll call a meeting Monday? I could do something quick in the snowflake or something. You’ll come won’t you? Help explain the process?
Rose doesn’t know yet. DON’T TELL HER PLEASE. Let me do it! If Lily get’s wind of this everyone will know before we even get back to London!
“I’d like that. I just always feel so guilty about how I treated you and what my parent’s did to you.”
Mister Lin and Mister Thom have agreed to monitor the pools and assist where needed from 16:00 until Midnight.
AP: I will do that, because it really is interesting, but I can’t explain it well enough. We can do that interview and include our mediwitch who specializes in this?
Do it! Oh crap. I’d better go. Supposed to work out today before picking up the boys. So I’ll see you later tonight and you can show me the message board thing okay? Take Teddy out for dinner! I’ll plan to have them there at 20:30 so they can settle in for 21:00?
Yes. I’ve programmed it for Malfoy Manor, Grimmauld back porch, the Harpies centre, roof of the penthouse and Gringotts front steps.
“Well, Yes, Mother. Get rid of the takeout containers and bottles, but I would like some more of the port if it’s still available?”
“You might also want to go outside and check your phone. I’m sure you have messages. Scorp left a voicemail. The kids can see the house from Rose and Hugo’s place. I haven’t called back yet. Should I?”
I think it’s a total of about fifteen? Parents and kids. No more than twenty. Iris, Lily, Eric and Rose are coming around too. Don’t bring anything it’s all covered!
I just think it’s ridiculous that women are expected give up their identity when they choose to get married. That’s why I insisted on taking your Mum’s name. Your Uncle Bill feels the same. You know this.
“Think about it Harry? At least you have a place for family to stay for your holiday gatherings. Lily comes up from Australia she has a place to stay. Close them up with a preservation charm the rest of the time. And you’ve got two NURSERIES. Grandchildren. BABIES!”
I’m sure it will be okay, I’m a little concerned about just giving this over to my Dad, and that the place is so huge. I’m afraid it’s going to be the usual.
“About the time when Louis asked about some robes? Why didn’t you tell anyone that stuff before? That’s not what they taught in history!”
I have arranged for the property to be documented one last time. I have provided a grant for the Magical Historical Society to provide the most complete documentation available that can be accessed by current researchers and our future generations. This documentation will be conducted by a team of photographers and a cartographer who will not only map and photograph the property, but also preserve it in visual form using technology not used before on a magical property. Our muggle neighbors would call this “Virtual Reality”. Within Wizarding culture we don’t have a name for it. How odd.
“You see the point over there? That’s Church Rock. Around the bend is Green Bridge. Not much beyond that.”
I am happy to report that my lovely Luna attended the event in a striking yellow sundress adorned with red poppies for the occasion. The dress was accompanied with a delicate azure blue crystal necklace and matching earrings. Her hair was put into a beautiful chignon courtesy of our sons Danika and Gareth. I will say she was STUNNING, but she always is.
He’ll be happy to. And tap into Teddy. He has his custom charms for the gallery. You can float items if you want so they don’t just have to sit on static shelves. Both Draco and Teddy are excellent with lighting too. You could show the pocket watches that way, just floating evenly spaced. He does that with small pieces. They can even be set to slowly rotate.
“It's Harry. And that’s not how it works. We help each other out to the best of our abilities. Ask for help
The work includes the installation of three new fountains as a focal point to the park (Also designed by the award winning Mr. Weasley-Linder). The new park will enjoy refurbished cobble walkways, plantings (including laceleaf maples lining a central walk), planters, benches and evening lighting.
Make the pendant an oval shape with a filigree edge and a stylized image of their patronus on the front?
“I’ll come with you to the library. I’d like to check out my coffee machine a little more today too.”
Pop-up shop. Chinese take-out in the space below the Black Diamond Billiards. Used to be a tea shop. Take up some of the overflow. It’s all just been cleaned up. Cissa will do it with Mr. Chen.
No I’m really not. The kid is quite handsome? I guess? The girls think so? Who am I to judge a goblin kid?
“They’re about to start the fireworks. The Grandchildren are getting impatient. George went back to the Wheezes and it looks like he wiped out the store. . . .Ron, George, Hugo and Grayson are all in the park acting like schoolchildren. . . . Stop fussing with the owls. They’re fine.”
JEWELS? She was matching jewelry to that chartreuse whatever fabric she had on me. It was HEAVY. I think it was dragon hide. CHARTREUSE DRAGON HIDE???
It’s not every day I get to do a freaking wedding cake. Of course I’m excited, AND I’ve got an amazing kitchen to bake it in.
“As much as I loathe to admit it. Spudmore is still making and revising the Firebolt. He’s the best. But Nimbus could do it. It’s not about the quality between the two it’s about the design and Jamie’s custom work.”
I get excited over little things that most people don’t. I love the details and love it even more when someone who really knows about them can explain it. Does that make sense? I get excited over (expletive) and sometimes it’s just the simplest of things. My best memories are things like my kids loosing a first tooth and the tooth ghost. And now I get to share how special that is with Al and Scorp. What’s dumb about that?
That sounds good. Let’s do that. The only people with automatic permission should be myself and Draco.
“Mine too. And you’ve always been a father figure anyhow, it just seems like a lot of wasted time you know?”
When we advised both the Manager and Ministry officials that Our Readers deserve to know about the event, we were told again that the event is being covered exclusively by another publication! Again, RUDE!
5. Mr. Kreacher would like the silver rosettes at the corners of each niche. I’m going to make an executive decision and upgrade those to platinum so they won’t tarnish over the years.
I think that’s good. Gives me time to run home and shower first. I’ll ask Harry if he needs anything else before I head out.
So we’re good there. And really he’ll be happy to assist. Very good with details and you’re going to need some assistance tracking down some of those older order members.
Someone to write it up with your cooperation so it's not all just speculation based on the filing. Can’t be Rose because she’s one of your Wizengamot designees.
Potter U.K. Estates - Overseen by Gringotts - claimed/no financial activity other than accrual. These properties include Potter Manor (Fidelius, Protego Maxima, Fianto Duri, Repello Inimicum/Islington), Potter Bungalow (Fidelius/Bournemouth), Prince Manor (Snape Estate, bequest, Fidelius/South Uist), Spinner’s end (Snape Estate, bequest, Fidelius/Cokeworth), Black Estates (see below for estates previously undisclosed), Potter Cottage (Initial/Original at Godric’s Hollow, Preserved Historical Site).The Prince Estates include 3 previously undisclosed properties in Wales: Cliff Cottage, Fidelius/ Pembrokeshire, Overview Point (Prince Manor), Fidelius/ Pembrokeshire and Prince Castle, Fidelius/ Ceredigion (Ceredigion property - historical ruin).
Nice to hear. No, Scorpius I’m not here about the wedding. I have something I’d like to ask Albus, although it’s quite unusual.
“Well? . . . .Did you HEAR him?. . . .You have marching orders and I’m taking him to bed. . . .Uncle Harry, there’s another pair over there.”
So here’s the thing. And Dad explained it to me better than anyone ever could. I’m none of those labels. Just Hugo.
I told you guys to think about it. Absolutely anything you want you can have. I just need to get the house cleared out.
It’s kind of hard to change but it’s got a lot of security measures built into it. Because family crap.
Love it. Making drinks, taking orders for food, Watching all the people coming through here. It’s pretty fun.
“I’ll let you shower, but these boys need undergarments that fit and breakfast. Jonathan can crack an egg just fine. He’s cut up vegetables to throw in his scramble. He’s tidier in the kitchen than either you or your brother. YOU need to get it together daddy.”
What’s good for you? I need your opinion. Louis should be here later this afternoon, but I want you to see it first.
“Miss Parks, could you show us the Master Suite please? Draco and I would like to settle in and then have all the staff meet us in the dining hall.”
Install appliances: Stovetops, 3 ovens, Cooling cabinets (Refrigerators). Muggle, purchased, will be delivered to the site. Retrofitted for magical/Muggle kitchen.
“Certainly. Put your hoop in the box and we’ll keep it safe. Take the box home with you to store the owl in. It has protections on it.”
LLL: HA! You boys both went all grabby hands whenever we tried to separate you. I remember both sets of your parents coming to me with questions. Astoria and Ginny actually became friends coordinating outings for you two outside of the school. Draco and Harry were a little skeptical but worked it out pretty fast. Look where we are now.
“All set, but I need to go over things with Sean again and bring the reunion committee over to tour the dining hall and ballroom. When’s a good time for that?”
So with that said, I’m putting together a coalition and splitting up the seats between myself and 8 others. Four of the eight have already accepted the challenge. And I hope that later this evening I’ll have the opportunity to meet BRIEFLY with all 8 that I would like to join me* (continued below).
Anyhow, I’ll contact Zebb. I’m sure she’ll be very happy to watch Aspen and I’ll tell Al and Scorp at a decent hour. You either wake up or go back to sleep.
Mint with chocolate vermicelli. The dark Belgian chocolate. Have you ever had it in a float with Muggle soda?
Next door is the mysterious “Harry’s Junk”. Mysterious because we don’t know really what to expect. But we did get a glimpse today! In the front display windows are what is described as “Phoenix Quill and onyx inkwell. Collection of Fleamont Potter, c. 1950 - 1960” and “Polished turquoise necklace set in sterling silver. Navajo. 27 stones in various sizes. Collection of Euphemia Potter, c. 1970". Of additional interest is a sculpture in the large viewing window described as “
I’d normally just copy what Draco said, but I want you to know again how much we appreciate it. We all truly enjoy seeing something in print that isn’t some dumb made up junk.
“Of course. Gift Closets. Well I guess all that matters is that she loves them. You always know the right thing. I would have sent cupcakes.”
“Yes, now you can leave it open to the elements and inclement weather cannot enter the vehicle. Try the horn.”
“There. See, you’ve got it! Now, the wand movement. You know how to concentrate the magic through the wand. . . . .just a strong point to the sky then down with the incantation. Ready to try it?”
You should have seen the look on Scorp’s face when we showed up at the office though, that was priceless. You’d think his dad was out and about wearing pajamas or something.
“It looks like a fucking craft store implosion. And all new wallpaper with big fucking golden chevrons all over the place. There are fake flowers and plants everywhere. Words in big letters all over the walls. “Live! Love! Laugh!” and all that kind of crap.”
I’ll talk with Liogell. I’ll bet there’s a mass transfiguration spell the Goblins can perform on the whole thing.
They’re going to be just perfect whatever they are I’m sure. This is not a competition. Will your boys really do fireworks?
“Louis, look at me. . . . . this is far superior to anything the historical society could do or even think about. What you’ve done here is important. . . . . it’s beautifully curated . . . the displays are sensitive and just fucking bloody dazzling. Don’t you ever underestimate your abilities.”
Can our date be after the “lunch meeting”? Did you forget about the Dorothea Tanning exhibit at the Tate? I’ll purchase tickets now.
“Alright get out your pen and start writing this down while I put away the food. Which of the cooling cabinets do you want to use?”
“Breathe through it for a minute . . . . look, it’s just an empty old store. Bill’s been here earlier and did his job. He’ll give us his report later . . . .There’s nothing left from that past. Let’s clean it up and start fresh.”
“Ms.Cibly and Ms.Keeley are outstanding. . . . . I see you’ve chosen Mr. Cookey, He will not require housing, he has a family and lives in the magical Hampstead neighborhood. You will need to provide floo access. . . . . Mr. Elliot will require housing, he is currently residing at the Leaky Cauldron Pub. His mother is quite distressed at this development. . . . . You might also consider Miss Groy. She would almost prefer the flexible position. She helps with her family at a bakery most mornings.”
“So now when we’re done with it guests can use it as more of a sitting area. Two balconies overlooking the conservatory and park. Do you like these curtains?”
They’re painting the outside of the pub next door. The Cat & Crown. It’s medium green with like a bronze (?) coloured trim. Not much of a change but all nice and clean looking. Looks like they’re washing the outside of the nightclub across the street. They’re cleaning things up all over the place.
I was very surprised. Helping with the foundation is going to be a real experience. Draco came to the house to ask me if I’d do it. THAT was something.
You are reckless and you intimidate people because, well, because you’re YOU to people who don’t know YOU.
There will be 37 proxies who will be advised to take seats in the observation gallery. Jay has confirmed that each seat is held separately, but we don’t know by whom.
“Yes. In retrospect I don’t question your actions. I would, someday like to better understand how you played both sides.”
And then the whole poppy thing. Everyone knows that poppies are used to derive the Muggle potions that give euphorias in the short, but turn really ugly in the long term.
“I can preserve them forever. I’ll put them in the entry and then keep them in my study. So pretty . . . . . angelica, mountain avens . . . . harebell, little cotton grasses. . . . I think these lupines are called nootkas. Oh, thank you so much. . . . . . . they’re beautiful. . . . . I love them.”
I just mean that he’s gotten really overprotective. You thought It was bad before. This is another new level. Full on both hands in the hair and snogging when he comes home from the lab.
The gentleman photographed with our son Hugo is Mr. Grayson Elliot. A recent Hogwarts graduate, Mr. Elliot is employed as the personal assistant to our friend Harry Potter and is dating our son Hugo.
“Probably right. You never know though. Hey did you see Wolf Alice finally has new music coming out? The single is really good.”
That would be great. Get things started on that. I should return the owl to Liogell then I’ll start stroganoff!
In this case just a “job” won’t do. Trandy has been not only a companion, but a confidant for Draco his entire life. He has been the same for Scorpius. It’s generational and I’m more than a little embarrassed with myself for overlooking it. Times have changed and I feel it’s my fault that I didn’t include Trandy to begin with.
“I did and I didn’t. But it’s still pretty good. I’ll read you the highlights. It’s mostly from the tournament. I abandoned it pretty quickly.”
YES! I was over with Zebb. The house is ready for furniture and stuff. The front fields look AMAZING. I didn’t know Jerry was putting in a sculpture fountain! It’s beautiful.
But there you go we’ve been together for I don’t know how many years now. Fifteen? More than that. You would know better. I love the man and want more than anything for him to marry me, but no. I know it will be a complete fiasco. I mean just being a couple will cause a (expletive) riot. And I love him Luna, you know this. And now just talking about it I’ve ruined your interview even MORE and if you publish this it would ruin Al and Scorps’ wedding.
“We’ll just touch base here then head to the conservatory and look around? I need to clear out of here for a while because my nephew’s coming to install a computer . . . then I need to get to my office at the Centre. . . . I know you’ve been busy. Have you had any trouble accessing the nursery accounts?”
“In here you have a dining space. Table for 8. And that looks like a breakfast counter with the stools.”
Well Louis' ring presentation will be quite heartfelt, stunning to a fault and graceful. Louis is sharp as a tack and takes no prisoners. His part will be brief, but executed to perfection.
SM: Our families have learned from past experience. The wizard press is unrelenting. We won’t let that happen again.
My staff for the most part live in a village on the grounds. It's on the far side of the lake. Beyond the lake are stables and an owl breeding facility, so it's more convenient for them as well. It's actually a nice cozy village. The old days of Elf quarters are long gone. They are all compensated with a fair salary. You've met Mindy, she's my main household coordinator and personal assistant. She has her own rooms here in the manor.
Just had a nice chat with Miss Parks. Apparently they were expecting a rowdy crowd. They are spoiling us all rotten. It’s starting to get late but everyone is staying up to see the lights. There’s even a balcony on the roof for watching.
The floors are all done except bathroom floor in master. There was a delay in material (marble). Delivery expected in two days.
“So in other words he was hot and you would let him get away with turning your manor into this over the top mess just to keep him around.”
We’re not going to play the game where we don’t do things together and enjoy ourselves because someone might take a photo. Fuck it. We’re just not doing that anymore. We’re adults.
Oh god. No. I’m not upset at all. I’m grateful. I think the biggest problem I have is that you call me Ginevra. I bristle every time I see it.
This is the rough breakdown of your schedule through next Friday. I’ll keep updating it as things change, because you know they will? I’ll send you the updates as needed:
Four generations of Grandchildren wondering what’s happening. They’re very excited actually. I filled them in briefly over dinner. They had expected me home much earlier.
“Not mind reading. Don’t tell Hugo about the cars tonight. Surprise him with a ride tomorrow okay? GO!”
“Enough time has passed. It’s not a grave robbing or desecration danger anymore. I don’t think? Do you?”
Well I suppose since I’m airing my laundry for everyone they may as well hear it. Yes. Mum was MAD with me. MERLIN. But “WAS” is the term I’m going to use because it’s better now.
You know what? I actually will ask. She’s about to retire and this would be exactly the kind of challenge she’d be up for. And you KNOW she’ll put all of her energy into it.
Quite frankly I don’t care to subject my children to this part of our history, but here we are. We need to face the reality of who we are and where we came from. THIS is an example of “where we came from” that should not be forgotten.
Okay I’ll try to do that. I’m still going to remind you to put away your socks though. Especially if you do it in front of your family. Your socks never have time to get dirty but its still bad.
I’m sending Mr. Maeda your private contact information. Let me know if you need anything else otherwise we meet in the conservatory on Thursday morning? I'm sure we'll talk before then.
Come for dinner. Ask Agruella to come with you. It’s Dud and Lucy, Lily and Rose, Jerry and Ginny. Draco and me. We’re singing karaoke after dinner with Mr. Trandy in the cellar. I know it’s short notice but tell her its CASUAL and not to worry about dressing up.
The public records filings this morning included the very interesting news that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were married this past Saturday.
“And this whole no magic at home even under the supervision of an adult is DOUBLE excrement! Did you know that this house even has a protected charms classroom? Plus, this house has so much magic emanating from it there's no way it can be detected.”
And we know the best people for that management. Or learn to trust the Goblins. They don't have it out for you and MANAGE is what they do best.
Yes and also there’s cool things like water towers and road crossing signs . . . . bridges and street lamps. I’ve got a trestle I want to work on. You can make whole miniature towns and villages. I’ve even got a mountain with a tunnel that you can run the train through and then down into the village. I’ll show you my new Santa Fe passenger cars that light up when the train is moving. You can see the little people riding in it.
He’ll come up with something tasty and harmless I’m sure. He really needs their help with it though!
What on earth would make her think I’d look good in something with purple chiffon puffy cuffs? I repeat. Purple chiffon puffy cuffs.
Cib is in charge of the courtyard and entry. Don’t forget this is a Muggle neighborhood! If for some reason you end up on the street just push the buzzer.
The idea is that the Hogwarts, Australia and Romania work together. Again, Draco’s portkeys make it possible. Lily would work directly with Hagrid for two years before taking over permanently then Hagrid would come in as an occasional consultant.
“I believe that Harry would very much like to hold a conversation about his Grandmother with you. What is your name?”
Also in attendance were Scorpius’ Godmother (myself) and my Husband, Albus’ Godfather, Professor Neville of Hogwarts who looked resplendent in a dark green sharkskin suit and deep lavender turtleneck.
“But not ONE of those kids is going anywhere near this thing until Grayson can drive it AND he has to prove it. He’s taking us out in it.”
UGH. I’ll also admit that I think Rose and Jaydne could use a night out being grilled by their parents about intentions and all that rubbish.
“So that’s all for today. I’m glad we’ve had this talk. We’ll connect again later in the week and we can catch up.”
We may have negotiated an appropriate price for the paintings he did for Decram with his artists representative. He’s been giving us an advantage that wasn’t necessary and we’ve corrected the error.
I think my favourite new thing is a sauna. This whole place is so relaxing. Just what everyone needed.
I think he’ll do good? He know’s we don’t want that. But Scorp and I are still nervous about the wedding. Crazy Grandmothers.
“Okay let’s take a look. . . . . Oh merlin. . . . . . . well these go on the jacket cuff, these would be for the shirt . . . . . . . . The larger ones for the jacket buttons. . . . . Fuck, Harry that’s beautiful.”
I need to check the progress on the junk shop anyway. I’ll head down early and drop the boys off with Jamie. Louis say’s it’s nearly ready.
You have no idea how lucky I am right now. I’d be so lost. He’s not flying off the broom-handle or ANYTHING.
SM: Honeymoon is going to be short. I’ll have to get back for my new job. It will be nice to get away for a week after the wedding though.
“Even if he were to somehow escape, his magic has been revoked permanently. That was my special request as punishment for what he did to his son’s magic. The Department of Mysteries was more than happy to accommodate. They sucked it out of him right in front of the Wizengamot and threw it into the ether. If he were to escape, which cannot happen, he wouldn’t even have the ability to perform a Muggle card trick.”
“I think he’ll like the view. . . . . Those windows open out if you want some fresh air. And now you’ll be within shouting distance from my study. Oh I almost forgot these. New business cards! You’ll use this address now. The fidelius comes off today so it’s good to use. And that’s your actual phone number and not the one down in Trandy’s kitchen.”
Saturday's opening event will close with celebratory fireworks provided by Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
“If you turn the dial on the far left that’s your music playlist courtesy of Hugo. Keep it turned down very low while we learn.”
Naw, don’t do that. Talk to Pansy! If you’re really worried about it she has a jewelry retention charm.
We’ll work out the finer details. Maybe Jamie and Herbert there can give us that list of attendees. We’ll tell them in advance that it’s an overnight party and prepare for that. Have it over two days and start it in the early afternoon with food?
Yes. And if I need something I can ask Zebb. It’s really not a problem. She's just a floo call away.
Another thing that you need to know about my inheritances: Politics. The inheritance comes with political implications and I have wrestled to come up with a solution because it’s a majority of the Wizengamot seats.
Well I guess we have the “Where”? That sounds fantastic? I’m still a little lost with this new information. I can’t wait to see it. Art collection??????
“Those rooms should only need cleaned twice a year unless you make an art mess. Don’t look at me like that. It’s going to happen. You also need to hire someone to come and look at those instruments. They are probably all very valuable. You and Draco decide what you want to do with them. But it’s a horrible waste that they don’t get used. You take that baby grand and put it up in the entry hall of the family level for Draco. And hire a piano tuner on contract for that and the one downstairs at least twice per year. And again, they need to be treated like you would art. Got it? Write this down.”
No he wouldn’t give it up completely. But it could be his offices and lab and gallery or whatever. There’s a reason he spent all of his time at the cottage with Harry. The place is beautiful but it’s never been a “home” like at the cottage. And NO I don’t hate the penthouse. My Dad and I have great memories together there. The penthouse is the exact opposite of what the country house was. The place is his way to express things he couldn’t before. Does that make any sense? He loves the place because it allowed him to depart from things. Purged baggage.
My repairo is top notch. And I’ll tell you a secret. I was really NOT looking forward to you staying at that manor. AND I’m secretly happy to have my handsome business partner stay for a while. He’s got the cutest dimples. I can’t remember the last time I spent the night at the penthouse. We can go up on the roof for cocktails in the evening, watch the sunset.
“I can’t wait. We’re really going to do up the house for it. The kids are going to love it. I promised them we wouldn’t stop doing it after we moved. Those pumpkins on the roof are going to be awesome.”
“So our next issue is the ceremony itself. The bond ceremony was meant to be in the garden and then the walk to the atrium. But Al needs to decide if he’s able. We could have you driven to the garden and supply seats for you both. There’s nothing that says you have to stand for it.”
That’s what Pansy has planned. Although now we’ll ask her to give them the impression that it’s all formal robes and uncomfortable shoes. They won’t see the actual outfits until the morning of the wedding.
“Side tour through those doors on the left. Come on, turn the flying naked baby door handles Potter.”
It’s not Gringott’s policy to divulge such matters. In this unique case I’m allowed to speak freely and in confidentiality concerning anything you choose. I am not allowed to question your decisions, but I am allowed to guide you in matters concerning your vaults or properties. Happy to do so in fact.
“Harry and Draco will not be living on these premises until the remodeling on the top level has been concluded. It’s going to be messy here for quite a while. The construction crew is very efficient but you will be expected to assist with cleanup. The construction will be mostly to the top floor, the kitchen behind me and a floor of guest suites and entertainment rooms. Otherwise expect some new paint and wallpapering here and there. . . .The portraits throughout the house are going to be removed. It’s suggested that you don’t disturb them.
Ginny and Jerome Weasley-Linder were at the venue to greet guests looking super. Ginny in a bronze brocade top and black trouser ensemble by our favorite designer Pansy Parkinson. Jerry looked super handsome in a navy blue suit with pink shirt and striking yellow necktie.
Draco and I are remodeling/cleaning up Potter Cottage for Al & Scorp’s wedding present. It was originally meant to be a surprise but things went south so they know about it now.
“Even the broccoli dishes. What is it with these kids and vegetables? And the asparagus is now gone too. Carrots, cauliflower . . . .these kids are rabbits.”
We will be removing the fidelius on the original anchor of the Grimauld complex on Monday evening. Most magical tenants will notice the difference. The anchor is the home of the owner of the complex.
“And another one for the fucking TOYS. Dad made the right choice buying us this flat at least we have the rooms and all this space. . . . Merlin’s pants look at this.”
We had dinner with Uncle Harry, Draco, Aunt Ginny and Jerry tonight after “the blast”. That was cool. In the wine cellar!
“Another thing to remember is that it’s only one way and that’s down. The pool is big. You can’t go wonky sideways and hit anything and the pool is so deep you’d have to weigh ten times your weight before you got close to touching the floor of the pool.”
“I mean, you both look really nice. And it’s very nice to see you going out just by yourselves. . . . . . dammit . . . Regent’s you said?”
Actually I’ve got one of him with Draco hair. But he’s not really a baby. Maybe two-ish? That might throw them off a little.
The art collections help break things up. I did put in these partition walls to help designate areas and make look a little less desolate.
“You asked for my assistance? I’ve been up all morning. I had breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Brick at seven freaking AM! I went to see Mr. Liogell and went over the plan with him earlier. Did you know he starts his workday at SIX? That’s insane! You told me about your dinner plans? Draco has chosen your outfit . . . . . . . . . .?”
Good. I’ll work out the logistics of service and transport from the centre. We’ll need to meet with the staff. I think it will be an easy one for them. Are we good for now? I’ve got an impatient ginger tapping his foot and pointing at his watch like we’re late for something.
“I guess if you’ve not been officially sorted at Hogwarts you’re a “Slytherpuffgryffinraven” or something? But it really is spot on with everyone.”
“What you do with this knowledge today is inconsequential. It certainly won’t change your day to day life, but it’s wonderful to know that you have that link with your Daughter.”
“If you want, there is the glassed area towards the street designated for vegetable gardening. You could plant the herbs there as well.”
Did you dump an entire bottle of cologne on the parchment? To make matters worse, it smells like Ron. I’ve cast incendio on it, but wrote down the time first, Saturday, 13:30, It’s a date. Lima 2.0 . . . Muggle business casual, got it? Never mind I'll get you sorted.
“In honor of one of our favourite students, the Lovegood-Longbottom and Delacour-Weasley families have decided on a collaboration. Do you still like flowers?”
I think that covers everything. The consequences are just like Ron’s vow, but I’ve altered it so recipients can speak freely between themselves as you requested. I’ve not altered Ron’s yet because it’s highly entertaining but will do before the event.
And now, this morning a virtual army of Goblins descended upon the Ministry. Armed with mountains of books, they reportedly marched directly to the Ministers office!
Did I tell you about the part where I’m in love with my business partner? You know the one. The tall blonde one. . . .He’s very handsome and puts up with me for merlin knows what reasons. Everyone apparently already knows about it? Well neither of us ever talked about it to the damned press or anyone that isn’t family.
“I had it done a while ago, they’ve been sitting at the penthouse for a while. I knew we’d have an occasion to gift it.”
Yeah the orange would be ugly with your hair. You could spell it to have WWW on it and drive it to work! I think Mione can be persuaded!
And now I want to see if we can get it to transfer to Grimmauld. I need to bring the test over and then you need to invite Decram into the painting. There’s a protocol. We’ll see if it works before I get started on the real painting?
Well yes, she does and for the most part she probably should. She’s a powerful person, but when it comes to family stuff, really a total softie. I wouldn’t cross her though geeeez.
“I do like how the place is arranged with the fireplace and couches on this end. Nice little seating area overlooking the park there. . . .bed in the centre.”
Dad said we can all do a Geminio on any of the photographs or books so that’s cool. We just need to do that soon cause he’s determined to get it done before the wedding.
“I can’t explain it. Magic I guess? But it is wonderful. Certainly old enough that it doesn’t need to be decanted.”
Dean and Seamus, owners of D&S Construction seemed to be taking a lot of notes in conversation with Mr. Malfoy. Ron seemed in good spirits and from the looks of it was on a comedic roll with all at the table. Could a new branch of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes be in the planning?
“I suppose you’ll need something to light them with. I don’t suppose I know someone who’s been practicing incendio lately?”
“No it’s true! I'm the Lord of the house of Black and you’re nothing but a painting. I inherited the title and this dustheap from Sirius.
And set the same up for Lucy, Iris and Grayson. Same as what I did for Gareth and Danika. Lucy doesn’t need another vault though. Just an additional account.
“All set up. We should have thought this out better. We should have some hors d'oeuvres or something.”
Sealed the windows like you asked. I’m sure it’s good, but just to be safe. I’ll tell them what to look for.
I don’t think so. You file a new suit in wizards court. Hugo can make things happen pretty fast because he can work with his Mum. Hermoine will work with the Muggle court to have the decision completed.
. . . . . . . . . . . I’m okay. . . . . . . . .No, I swear, I’m okay. . . . . . . . . Merlin, Draco.
I may have mentioned that we’re opening the SW wing for guests and that the staff is a little stressed over it. Of course that is all true. I may have just let his imagination go a little wild and think there are Malfoy relatives invited. There really aren’t any Malfoy’s to invite but I just left that hanging out there. The SW wing is quite pretty. Gets the most sun, and was sealed off by the family and hidden with an illusiont charm before the first war. It’s light and airy. I thought it would be perfect for this occasion. No bad memories in that wing. All the guests will have a suite to prepare and repose.
The broom establishment closed its doors several years prior. The retail/industrial space lies between the former Borgin and Burkes and the Cat and Crown Pub. This led us to wonder what possibly could be the use for the former broom shop. More on that later in this article.
I’m going to come back tomorrow. Get him set up with email and chat privileges. Download the programs. PRIVATE.CHAT. okay?
Don’t call it a “date” because you’ll send the boys into hysterics again . . . and we promised. It’s just a regular business/lunch.
We sat him down and asked what he’d like. He just wants to hang here in Diagon with the festival happening. It’s the night of the Summer Nights Parade.
I think I’m going to go ahead and get started on Grimmauld so we can meet and see what we’re up against.
“Ha! Well that was an easy decision then . . . . . and it’s Hogwarts . . . . This is your list of school supplies. It’s the usual stuff. Books and things.
Yes. Mr. Potter, I’ve dedicated my career to these duties. I have three assistants who are also designated exclusively to these accounts. As you can imagine they are quite complicated.
We are more than happy to fulfill your request to accept your inheritances. This can be accomplished posthaste.
I’ve got a bottle of sake in the pantry! Consider it done! I’ll send Mr. Jordan to the goblins and then get started and it should be ready when you get here. Gives me something to keep me busy while I wait. Double Win!
“On the hexagon bottom left behind you will find the green closets that also connect to the kitchens. Top left and right passageways lead to twin miniature glass arboretum with views of the ocean. The four iron staircases lead to the second level, however there is a levitation veranda to the second level with access through the dining hall.”
“I like your plan better than mine. I’ll grab some extra provisions. We’re going to need jackets for the race. I’ll tell Trandy to expect us back in the morning.”
“Draco is all speed and determination . . . . . Your Dad flies loops around him . . . . . It’s very entertaining. But Draco is FAST. Faster than me or anyone on the team that’s for sure.”
Sunday morning had them in Knockturn Alley ready to take on the property formerly known as Borgin and Burkes. The photo above shows the “before” of what can only be called the ramshackle remains of the long abandoned shop.
The party should be for your peers. You don’t want to expand it to the older people. Keep it to just people in your generation.
I need your fucking spells. I can’t contain her. She got into Jerry’s pantry and now there’s some gum powder EVERYWHERE.
I’m excited for this part. The boys are expecting a whole weekend of boredom and stuffiness. This will break the pattern. Honestly I’ve not done something like this before.
“Hugo is a smart and kind soul. You will be fortunate to have him as a friend. . . . And you look very nice. Are you happy with things so far?”
“I can’t! This place is crazy. What’s with all these fucking cupids? I’m not going to live in a fucking cupid palace. I mean Draco! Look at this mess!”
Change is afoot. We will be making changes to The Prophet beginning today. First and foremost readers should know that Draco and I have agreed to have no input to the paper other than what we are writing today, but we may pop in from time to time with an opinion. Ms. Jennifer Waters takes the mantle of editor beginning today.
No. Most certainly not on that, whatever the fuck that is! But I do want you to come home so I can show you your outfit for tonight before I go to pick up the boys.
“I still don’t get how you can like Taylor and not Arianna. . . . Something to do would be good. Sounds like Mr. Brick might be going a little barmy too.”
So let me see if I’ve got this correct. Al and Scorp are Albus and Scorpius. You’re getting married soon and Al is pregnant. Scorp is Draco’s kid and I LOVE the strawberry and mint shampoo he makes!
“Just remember, pull your legs up on the way down and we go together. I swear I won’t let you go until we hit the water.”
The new moniker above the door will read “Harry’s Junk”. The name comes from the original idea from Grayson Elliot who suggested the project as “come see Harry Potter’s junk”. The name is meant in a humorous and playful take as there will be nothing actually for sale in the “shop”.
“Want to give it all up and just stay here? I know we’d just end up killing each other, but I really do love this place.”
“I have no idea. I need it though, I need to text the prime minister or someone about that cursed vase in the palace.”
AND I’ll have it all fixed up and protected like the other cars. Magic the fuck out of it. Won’t ever have to bother plugging it in or exchange the batteries. I’ve thought this through!
Jonathan Lukas (Jon - 9 years) is introspective, insightful and very protective. His interests include reading, drawing, helping in the kitchen and pretty much anything involving dirt. He is very quick to solve the issue at hand and very straightforward about it. Jon is always ready to help.
Let’s get back to business! I hereby call to order the Wizengamot for the second half of our session. Mr. Hugo Weasley-Granger will present the next legislative endeavor!
Customers are playing a game. Guess what shampoo and/or scent belongs to whom. I was visiting the boutique this morning and a patron tried to smell me. It’s happened to Louis as well next door.
. . So I inherited more property and money I didn’t need. I can’t wait to see the new tax bill. . . We’re sitting in what you would call a park, but in reality it’s the back grounds of a manor built by one of my ancestors.
“She needs a computer. That would be good. That’s another one of the things she "wasn’t allowed" with the school. In reality she just uses mine.”
Like maybe three sets of seasonal coloured beads. Make it seasonal and put them in a pretty box. You could present it to her that way, then she’s not producing them, just designing. “The Brick Design House”.”
“That’s why you have to talk with him. You won’t do anything stupid. You know you won’t. You connect with people on more of a core level than most. If that turns romantic that’s a wonderful thing. What’s his name?”
Yeah that was pretty bad. Ginny wasn’t happy that he did that to his pretty red hair. Scorp went super light pink. That’s all that Draco would allow.
Oh yes. You got yourself into it this time. You can’t expect us to just stand back and let you make fools of yourselves.
PHOTO CAPTION (Friday): Hugo Granger-Weasley, Grayson Elliot, Harry Potter, Ronald Granger-Weasley and Minister Hermione Granger-Weasley enjoy a meal at the Cardamom Cafe in Diagon Alley.
Breathe, Potter! Merlin you haven’t had one of these in a long time. . . .Come on. . . . .look at me. . . . . .breathe. . . . . .
I DID! Dec and Snape are ready to party! Jerry even made a special mounting spot for them so they can view the parade.
“The issue that could be worrying is his use of wordless spells and charms. It’s very unusual and advanced. It could cause concern later, especially if a spell is used in anger.”
“It was supposed to be a joke? I know it doesn’t work! It was just to let you know that I didn’t want you to go? You’re the object of my affections? IT WASN’T SUPPOSED TO WORK!”
You have no idea what this has been like. He’s craving weird food and lots of ice cream. Cries at the drop of a hat. But then it’s foot rubs and neck massages and constant grabby hands and kiss demands!
I sincerely didn’t know that it was as important as the Goblins made it out to be. The lordships carry “obligations” as some would say and “The Potter Manor” is one of them. There are some other properties that I’ve yet to visit but most I believe are just ruins on unplottable land.
“Alright then. No coffee is much better. I don't care for tea. Oh Harry it’s just as I remember. It was a horrible and yet wonderful time.”
We’re still working on the exterior and it’s going to be nice and fresh. I was a little concerned about the colors at first. Once I figured out that it’s just sun damage it was good.
“It's from Pansy! It’s also possible that we’ll look like complete idiots, but I don’t care I’m taking you out anyway. Besides, you’re always cute . . . . . especially in those jeans.”
We are pleased to know that you have accepted the Lordships and Titles that accompany your Inheritances. We do understand your reservations and reassure that by accepting the inheritances you have no obligation to be formally addressed as Heraald James Potter, Lord of Potter, Peverell, Black, Prince and Stinchcoumbe as that is your preference. You will, however be addressed as such in formal proceedings as necessary in most Gringotts procedures and correspondence. It will be your sole obligation to inform the Wizengamot and Ministry of Magic of this preference for future interactions.
Just flooing “Snowflake Dining Room” tries to auto portkey you to La Cocina De Eva in Snowflake Arizona in the United States.
“As Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, I call an emergency session to order! We’re going to make this quick and easy so we can get back to the party! All agreed????”
Look at it this way, he has a scary job but he raised Louis. And Victoire & Dominique for that matter. How scary is that? You’ve known these people your entire life. Bill isn’t scary. At All.
“Perhaps we’ll have to just swear off all sex forever just in case. I don’t want you getting me magically pregnant either.”
We really would like to see your place sometime but we understand that you won’t want to do anything big for a while.
A pair of low backed chairs from another era wait for Albus and Scorpius while James and Edward stand behind and place their hands on the shoulders of brothers. Brothers in blood, spirit and family.
The second vault, I believe, is a little more complicated. I’ve decided that rather than have the remaining contents sent to charity or Evanescoed I want it put into storage for a few years so if my children have missed something they want the can still access it.
A lot. But nothing unsurmountable so far. We still have two floors and the roof to check out though.
Mysteries has them on secreting people off to foreign countries to evade authorities. They have dates and locations. MLE has them on not only fraud and conspiracy charges, but Muggle tax evasion in six countries. There’s also what Muggles call a multi-level marketing scam.
“So if you go through here you have your bathroom. Tub and shower. I like these sinks. There should be plenty of hot water. If not, let us know and we’ll have it fixed. Do you know there’s what is called a tankless water heater? Unlimited hot water! Linen closet with extra towels. Draco put these in here too. Even set you up with some basics. Oh, his son Scorp made those soaps and stuff. Those are going to smell awesome. . . . shampoo and conditioner too.”
“What if you just asked Mrs. Brick to design them and have them made by, I don’t know, other Elfs? Mrs. Brick could teach them how. . . . .
“I finished the big curse sweep earlier. Here’s my report. . . .It’s clean but there really was some nasty energy in there. I would suggest doing the ‘ol disappeario on all those old display cases and junk leftover tables. It’s all ugly as fuck anyway. Can never be too safe!”
I’m not willing to hide from this. They might speculate. Caption might say something about my new boyfriend or something. Are you okay with that? Otherwise we can meet somewhere else.
“Still needs furnishing. This hallway needs a runner. . . . we don’t need to look at the other guest rooms they’re all similar. . . .I just want you to see the one we’re going to use at the end of the hall. . . .”
“Do I have to watch them all? I think one was enough. I don’t think I want to. You’ve explained it plenty.”
I’d still like you to take a look. I’ve chosen an unadorned white china, silver service and flatware from a collection the Muggles would call “Art Deco”. Glassware is a crystal from the same era with a cut geometric design.
“He never wants anything. Won’t even take a vacation. He’s a wealthy man with his savings but rarely touches it.”
YES. Second I file your formal transfer of the Prince Lordship to Draco: Draco Lucius Malfoy, Lord of Prince. So then you’re: Heraald James Potter, Lord of Potter, Peverell, Black and Stinchcoumbe.
“I’ve left scones from my Father’s bakery in your dining room. He’s also made clotted cream, I’ve left that in Mr. Trandy’s cooling cabinet.”
“Decram. Do you want to be here instead of the manor? Would that work Teddy? We could bring his main portrait here for now? I’ll put it in the snowflake?”
“I take no responsibility for this. I’m not even technically on the job. I just shrunk some stuff and lit the candles!”
We talked about doing something with things from Decram’s. That will be fun. Around Valentines. . . .Cherub’s and that wild carriage. For the holiday thing? You know how Ginny mentioned Ron’s robes? He’ll do it. We can ask around and see what others have.
He definitely would love to do it. The boys will have an awesome outdoor space when he's done too. Then you can have a rooftop garden party for the birthday and watch the parade. DONE.  Just give him and his crew access. He'll make sure the building is stabilized too.
I think I’m going to have to make an announcement at the meeting. At this rate by the time of the wedding I’m going to be looking “EXTRA HEALTHY”.
“It’s alright, so eventually it got to the point where people just drive by and wave anymore. They think we’re certifiable I’m sure, but they don’t question anything. A full hedge showed up overnight and they just roll their eyes and keep driving.”
“Alright so we’ll meet here on Friday afternoon and try it out. I’ll pre-program the first ones for here at Grimmauld as home base, the Harpies Center and where else?”
“Not Dean and Seamus for this one. I want to do it. You can help me if you want, but I want to do it.”
“The chandelier is still looks like a spider web but now it’s all silver and white. It used to be smaller and black. Now it’s actually pretty. Oh!
I’m begging you to help me keep this quiet. I already had to tell the boys about their wedding present and that’s bumming me out to no end.
You’re just going to get Mr. Liogell to handle it aren’t you? No driving test. Just Goblin administrative work and fees.
“And I’ve invited the family to observe our friendly match. It’s time the kids saw us in action don’t you think?”
No this is good. This part I didn’t tell you about before. Uncle Harry had me take him shopping for work clothes on Saturday.
“You’ll be sharing with Mr. and Mrs. Brick of course but yes. They’re going to be on the 2nd floor. You’re up top. Down here you’ve got this main room. Draco put in the TV. . . . it’s all hooked up and with that box you can watch movies. Do you like muggle movies?”
I don’t know? I think I own them? I can’t imagine he’s going to want to transport them empty back to Japan. They’re not like glass fish tanks they’re more like Muggle plastic transport tubs.
So we have to look nice, but somehow relate it to school? I don’t know. He just contacted us this morning. Caught us off guard and we said okay.
I can’t say he is. But it’s better than imagined. Decram is totally hamming it up. His wig looks like it’s bouncing.
I miss you too, but don’t ask me to take a day off for that. Come on, fess up. What. did. you. do???
“See? I’m not so bad at it! So we’ll put his painting on this wall here and he can watch his TV with a view of the park.”
I’ll coordinate that with Zebb and let you know. Oh! I got the lyrics! You’re right, I’m going to need help pronouncing it.
ALL additional creature restrictions, Including but not limited to Lycanthropy, Veela, Vampir, and Merepeople. . .And
Hugo Granger-Weasley has been helping me out a LOT. Took me shopping for work clothes and equipment. I have a computer now. And a phone! Maybe you could get a new phone and we can talk?
“Or we can just ask my Godfather’s portrait. Again he’s got a lot of explaining to do. He’s hiding all kinds of secrets here.”
Are you sure you don’t need help, because NOW I’m getting nervous. I think Jamie and Ted’s boys were a nice distraction. Scorp and I are starting to freak out over the wedding. They won’t tell us ANYTHING.
“Let’s send a few more before we head out shall we? . . . Just for good measure? . . .Can someone disappear my bucket? . . . Go ahead! . . . EVERYONE GIVE IT A HEX! . . .Oh no, Mr. Kreacher you keep that wand. I’ve presented it to you as a gift and you have official permission to use it. Nobody said the permission expires! . . .Hey Andi, can I interest you in a hoodie?”
“Jay taught it to me. He sent me the lyrics. We practiced at Gringotts last Friday. Do you want to learn it? You sing better than me. I’ll teach it to you!”
And to make matters worse there was no follow up. The rep just left, filed that report and washed his hands of it.
“So it should be time for an update to the image on the card. That can be arranged. For now you are free to drive. You also still retain your license on the Isle of Man.”
You have basically two choices then. The Siddely or the Duesenberg. The Burgundy Rolls is still at the exhibit. The baby blue Bentley would work but it’s a little flashy.
“I apologize. There really was no warning. I’ve had no luck trying to reach you since Friday. Five owls were returned to the office and we were out Saturday afternoon and yesterday. It has to be written correspondence and not just a phone call.”
“Grayson is going to write up the transcript and Hugo is our acting clerk tonight. . . . Are you ready?”
But see, that’s why you and Draco work out. He doesn’t give a bloody sickle about the fame and balances you out with first class snark! Plus that whole gay thing. Marry Him.
“It’s the Prince ring. I want you to have it. It’s light blue sapphires for MY prince. I can’t transfer the lordship but I want you to have the ring. Please take it. It’s perfect for you and it’s from your Godfather.”
But I’ll have no talk about doing this until things are more settled. AND after the wedding. Even wait until after the baby.
“I’ve made them for all the children now. And as I’ve said there are two here but they’re identical.”
Those turnip earrings are going to look perfect with her dress for the wedding. She said so herself!
“It’s very Victorian. This is the guest level. There are 12 guest suites down there. I’ve been snooping.”
Lunch at the Cardamom. Hugo and Grayson at Daisy’s coffee. Grayson in a fantastic outfit out in front of Gringotts with his owl. Hugo and Grayson at the market feeding each other blueberries. Hugo and Grayson riding in a peach convertible. You and Draco getting out of a fucking Rolls in Muggle London. You and Draco getting into a grey car? What is that? Seems your personal assistant and my son have quite a fan base. 5 freaking pages of photo’s. And then there's Witch Weekly.
“Woah. I get what you’re saying now. When I rejected my Father and changed my name to my Mother’s maiden it was a freeing thing. Like there was no connection with him left at all.
“I love them. . . . . Grayson is probably one of the best things that’s happened to me in years. And Hugo? Those two brains together could be very dangerous.”
“I wouldn’t do that. Part of the reason we’re here is so we can see what can be done to keep you together.”
“Yes. We have successfully spent the day together doing nothing other than enjoying each other’s company.”
“Before we continue, there’s one other issue to be addressed. . . . Hugo, do you have the paperwork?”
“It’s all set to go now. Decorate it however you want. Put up some more photos? Magical mystery craft and frames can do them right from your phone! That’s how Rosie did it!”
All in favour of the legislation on the table please raise your hand?. . . . . . .Any opposed? . . . . .If the clerk would record the unanimous vote in favour of the Legislation entitled “The Repeal of Certain Restrictions related to Lycanthrope, Veela, Vampir, and Merepersons. . .And *Keeplers” It would very much please the Wizengamot.
It’s a BUSINESS TRIP!. It’s for Grayson’s driving uniforms! You’ve got my credit cards for all expenses! You have reservations for dinner at Eins44 on Saturday night!
I believe I may have given Mr. Potter the wrong impression with my inquiry. Mr. Hugo Granger-Weasley is rumored to have an intellect that rivals that of his Mother. Many establishments have been reserving offers for this young man. Waiting for him to finish his studies before offering employment.
“Just don’t know. I was thinking of putting black bamboo in those or some kind of grasses. There’s one in each corner of the hexagon.”
“So no then . . . . . . . These trousers are nice. They’d be good with this crew neck . . . . . oh wait . . . . . . those trousers with this shirt. Try this.”
“I probably should have looked at it first. Sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. I hadn’t seen it before. It was just marked Al’s first school day. I must have thought it was important or I wouldn’t have saved it.”
I need to contact Kreacher. He’s still magically bound to the property and I need him to help the goblins with the opening and restoration rituals.
I wouldn’t doubt it at this point. We should raid the closets over there. We didn’t think of that. Old Decram says it was very fashionable for the time, I’ll bet his closet is quite dapper. If not I’m sure Mother has something we can borrow. Yes, okay that can actually be fun after such a stress day at Grimmauld. The kids will at least get a kick out of it. We can greet them all at the entrance. Set up those torches. Lighten the mood before dropping the lordships on them.
I’ll admit it’s a little overwhelming. That’s for sure. But hey look on the bright side, you were wrong about Hadrian!
“WALES? You can’t do that without my consent! And if it’s a day school how is she getting to Wales? You’re lying! What’s the name of this school?”
Grayson made a list. I just made a template and copied the names into it. Printed them out of heavy paper.
We can show the Duesenberg, because you won’t want to not have access to the Burgundy Rolls, but I’d really like to show Grayson’s roadster if he'd let us. They’ve both been photographed all over. People want to see it up close. But I don’t want to ask him to do that either.
And I think I needed to just rant for a bit. I’ve been surprisingly calm since we got that out of my system and over with.
Today if you could go to my kitchen and check that there’s coffee, milk, tea and heavy cream. Earl grey and chamomile tea and dark roast whole bean coffee? I think Zebb might have used up all of the good coffee.
You should see what it’s like when she gets to the Burrow with Arthur. The woman is definitely not afraid of getting her hands dirty. Especially when it comes to all these computer and phone things. Hugo's pretty good with it too.
“Ask me something about current events! OH, never mind. Your lack of current events knowledge is legendary.”
No. If Gran went out of her way to figure out how to open a freaking chat to invite you she’s sincere. No ulterior motives.
“Alright, I’m going to move you again and lay the background flat on the table. Do you want to go back to the manor while I do it?”
If you’ve received this letter I really want your attendance at the Ministry for the proceedings as my guests in the observation gallery.
. Jacques Lipchitz, Collection of Euphemia Potter, c. 1919. Interesting indeed and if a precursor to what’s to come, a welcome breath of fresh air and culture.
No, absolutely not. I’ve been forbidden to disclose without the inheritance and Lordship acceptance tests. I’ve been begging him to do this for years. We’ve not a lot of time. Let’s go.
“I just really hate talking about it, but in the Wizarding world it’s a big deal and Lucy’s going to need to know about it before she starts Hogwarts. Maybe we can get one of the kids to help explain it better to her. At least from the kids perspective.”
So this is usually the part where we decide to meet up for drinks or dinner or something, but to be honest it’s been a lot lately and I just want to stay home and curl up by the fire with Scorp. Plus the weather is CRAP.
“I think your ritual will take care of that as well. If it’s cursed that would be all Walburga’s doing. The Grandparents weren’t like that at all. That’s a myth. The Blacks were an old and very traditional pureblood family but Walburga and to the same extent Bellatrix were an exception. Those two were extremely unstable.”
“NO. That’s not it. It’s pretty remarkable, Dad. It’s just . . . . . that one short snippet? That was the beginning of so many things. Just that one day. . . . . Did you see it?”
“Well the kids are going to want to clean up. Then we’ll do the conservatory tour. I’ll talk with Arthur and Mother.”
Foundation, Grant and Groundbreaking Ceremony - Summer (Tentatively July) to coincide with Press Release Announcement (Luna/Quibbler).
Sink Is COOL! You can definitely bathe a baby in it! (You can probably bathe a toddler in it and give it a full shower with the commercial faucet hardware/hand sprayer).
“Five days before she filed for the divorce. All she cared about was having a marriage on the paperwork for Lucy’s birth certificate. That’s her parent’s and the religion thing. You know this. One night stand turned into a nine month nightmare and then she took me to the cleaners.”
“Okay. I’m thinking to not tell them too much so it can be a cool surprise anyway. But I want to get help with the pub quiz and ask Danika if he’ll team up with Phil for spinning. We’ll have to transport his DJ gear. Maybe the Iceland part and to pack for that and also swimming gear? Teddy’s going to offer a “gallery walk” too.”
We will get that sorted as a first priority then. We can use that potions classroom for brewing coffee or whatever, but I’m taking it back when the grandkid is old enough for me to teach. Deal?
UGH Grayson is too practical. He’s checking the tags for fabrics cause he doesn’t want to have trouble doing laundry: “Pants at cleaning spells!”.
You really need to visit your Grandparent’s vault. Mr. Liogell said you haven’t been there. It’s amazing.
“A small team of Goblins and three Aurors. They’re the equivalent of your police detectives and clean up crew.”
I know. But that was before the whole baby thing and now I find myself doing things like going to talk with Zebb and not realizing I’ve put on two different shoes. I can’t see my fucking feet anymore! Then I'm thinking, well how in the hell am I going to get through a whole day in freaking dragonhide. That, and it's going to look fucking ridiculous There's going to be photographers to document the fiasco!
You’re right. I don’t approve them I just sign off to tell them they did a good job. Still, to be sure, I’m going take this to the Supreme Mugwump and have her sign off. It won’t be an issue, she’ll understand completely.
“And your personal style. . . . . The traditional chauffeur uniform in the charcoal and black brocade is just a costume for an occasional fun outing or event. You don’t want that for every time you get in a car, that would be boring and awkward. You’re not a mannequin. You already have plenty of style you look fabulous. I’m just helping you along. We’re not going overboard here, I have a budget and we’re working within it . . . . . all cleared and approved by Harry. . . . .now both of you choose some neckties over there while I finish my notes. . . . . ”
I’ll take that venture on by myself if I have to. That fucking RAG has been the bane of my existence for my entire life. This will be entertaining for me. OH Hermione this is going to be GOOD!
Lucy is welcome here at the burrow with the other kids if that’s alright with Duddley. Rumor has it, I’m good with kids.
The highlight of my week is when I get my time with the kids. Jon is working on his third caboose and Davey is helping me with my mountain. We’re all just about ready to start putting snow on the village! I will be at the school to pick up the boys. They’ll come home with me and we’ll hang out with the Grangers and the Masons before I have to leave.
“Dad. We love it so much. The view of the fountain is amazing. Especially at night. So relaxing to just watch after a long day.”
Do you know what we need to do for Grayson’s driving license? He says it’s only good on the Isle of Man.
No reason to be nervous. It’s just Mum and Pops. I can’t wait to get you in my little MG. The drive up to the cliffs is really pretty.
“Harry, just look around. The tenants definitely love it. Most of them are watching. They can’t wait to get out here.”
“I think we have a nice muscat in the cliff cottage collection. We can follow that up with the port you like. There’s plenty of that here.”
Over the long term I’d like to do some more traveling but mostly to remote areas. Peru intrigues me for instance. There are some areas in southeast India that I’d like to visit. I’ve always been very motivated primarily with work and potions. I know that doesn’t seem too interesting to most it really isn’t work for me. It holds my interests. You’ve not seen my lab have you Luna?
Please find attached a Portkey to the luncheon (either a toy caboose or unicorn with rainbow mane courtesy of Draco Malfoy). The transportation will activate within 30 seconds of your grab between 13:30 and 14:00 on the day of the event.
