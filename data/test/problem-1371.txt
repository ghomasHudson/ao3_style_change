,” Draco said. “I meant what I said, earlier.”
That was when the rain started.
When Harry got into his flat that night, he made sure to slam the door behind him.
“That sounds like very exciting news to me,” Harry teased.
“Oh, you know. The usual. I still wish they hadn’t banned smoking on aeroplanes, but so it goes.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he was surprised or not at how well Draco fit in with his friends, but he was pleased all the same. He conversed amiably with Hermione about what was going on at Downing Street and Westminster, he complimented Ron’s cooking, and he let Rose try her hand with one of his nicer pens and a miniature legal pad. When Ginny announced a game of amateur footie, he stood up to join in, despite his collared shirt and shiny oxfords.
Harry sucked in a breath. “I would love to, but I have an away game on Wednesday, so I’ll be heading to Brussels tomorrow. Is there another day that would work for you?”
The light went off.
Harry returned the handshake, trying to ignore the sweat passing from Zacharias’s palm to his own and wondering if this was normal for a first date with a bloke. His instincts whispered
They’d all crowded into a sandwich shop a few days after Scrimgeour’s Scandal, as the press had dubbed it, startling the bored-looking waitstaff, who hurriedly offered up menus and declared that dessert was on the house. As conversation turned toward the inevitable, Harry aired his confession. It had been weighing on him more and more as he’d started to properly know his teammates for the first time, and he couldn’t bear to hide it from them any longer.
“Hi!” Draco said brightly as he opened the door. The first thought Harry had was that he looked radiant when he smiled. The second thought was that, for once, Draco didn’t have a pen behind his ear.
“Still or sparkling?” Draco continued, loping toward the kitchen with an unreasonable amount of grace, given the hour.
“If you could open the wine, that would be wonderful.” Draco slid a bottle opener across the counter to Harry, then pulled two stem glasses down from a cabinet. Harry poured each of them a generous cup, then stood, waiting, as Draco bustled around the kitchen, making the meal’s final preparations.
Draco froze, visibly panicked, his eyes stretched wider than they should ever have been able to go. “It’s not that simple.”
? For the party we’ve been planning for a month? This was the only weekend that worked for everyone between when we finished unpacking and when the baby is due and—”
“Not a problem at all. This has not been an altogether unpleasant experience, even if you’ve ruined my sofa.” Seeing the stricken look on Harry’s face, Draco let out a lofty laugh. “Don’t worry about it. I’ve never liked it anyway. Looks like a pretentious piece of shite, but my father made me bring it from the manor.”
“Potter. Harry Potter,” Harry said. His neighbour’s eyes widened just enough that Harry wasn’t sure if he recognised the name or not. “And you are?”
Harry wasn’t so unbearably famous that he got harassed on the streets every time he went out or got accosted every time he boarded the Tube. It helped that he wore glasses, he privately thought. No one expected England’s star footballer to wear glasses off the pitch, but contacts made his eyes itch when he wore them for more than a couple hours at a time. Nonetheless, when people met and recognised him, they always wanted something from him. Everyone seemed to think he existed solely to satisfy their curiosity and provide mementoes. He didn’t mind signing autographs or chatting briefly about what it was like to make your career in sports, but he hated it when people decided he owed them such favours because he was famous, when they’d follow him down three blocks even after he’d given them what they said they wanted. Besides his friends from uni, those who had decided he was worth their time before he signed with the Arsenals and then the national team, no one had ever been kind to him because he was Harry. It was always because he was bloody Harry Potter.
“Oh. Did I forget to mention those?”
Draco’s head turned away as he gazed over the stands. “Isn’t the view better from over there?” His brow was furrowed as he gestured halfway across the pitch to the seats parallel to the center line, right below the press box. “That’s where I usually sit and—” He cut himself off, eyes widening.
He hummed to himself as he showered and cleaned, moving his spare cleats from the countertop to a shelf in his closet, tossing his old takeaway containers into the dustbin under the sink, and wiping down the multitude of flat surfaces he’d been ignoring for the last few weeks. He smiled as he surveyed the living area. It still didn’t look nearly as polished as Draco’s flat next door—Harry’s squat sofa was a ratty brown thing he’d purchased at a charity shop right after he’d graduated from uni, and somewhere along the way, it had become a rite of passage to sign your name onto the side in Sharpie when Harry wasn’t looking. His coffee table had a splash of white paint on a leg from when Luna had decided to give his last flat an “ethereal” look, and a chipped corner from when Ron accidentally had rammed it into the wall of the stairwell whilst Harry was moving in, and a burn mark seared onto the side from when Fred and George had set off fireworks
“Oh. Of course,” Zacharias said, frowning. “I could still give you a ride, if you’d like. Might be faster than the Tube, and that way you won’t risk making anyone else sick.”
Pansy waved the point away, then turned her attention to Harry, who knew this official introduction was important but still found himself distracted by the smudge of lipstick Pansy had left on Draco’s jaw, absently wiping it off with his thumb.
Harry nodded.
Draco sighed again. “You’re right, I did know. It just seemed personal enough that I wanted to learn about it directly from you. It didn’t seem fair for me to know without your consent. I realise that it’s a painful topic, so maybe that wasn’t the right call, but that was my thought process at the time.”
“You don’t know?” He hadn’t had to tell the story in years; it was always mentioned somewhere when the papers wrote about him, but he supposed Draco didn’t follow sports. “Right. My parents were driving home from a Halloween party when I was fifteen, and a drink driver hit us head-on. Mum and Dad died at the scene, but I got lucky. Just a few broken bones and this scar, here.” He pulled his fringe back to show the jagged scar that stretched from his hairline to the top of his cheekbone. “Sirius took me in once I was released from the hospital, and I’ve lived in London ever since.”
“That’s not nearly as exciting,” Draco said, stretching languidly against the back of the armchair, his spine arching. “I’m a journalist for the
“Kidnapping?” Zacharias gave a nervous chuckle. “You surely don’t think I—”
sweaty, did it?
Then she shook her head and declared, “No, I was right about the date.”
Harry leant a bit closer. He was conscious of Draco’s hand, only a few inches away from his own on the wooden table, and he could imagine heat sparking the space between their fingers. “So, you like cooking? How’d you learn?”
“What are you working on?” Harry finally tried.
“Sorry to bother you,” Harry stammered. “I… err… moved into the flat across from yours about six months back, and I don’t believe we’ve met.” He stuck his hand out for the other man to shake and immediately regretted it, remembering how poorly his last handshake had gone.
The downpour drenched Harry as he stood there, trying to figure out what to do. It was too late to catch a train to Ron and Hermione’s, or to Luna and Neville’s, or to the flat that Ginny shared with her teammates. He supposed he could walk somewhere, but where to? All of his friends lived several kilometres away, and he didn’t think he could find his way by foot without a map.
“I did too,” Harry mumbled, embarrassed to find tears leaking out of his eyes. Ron didn’t comment on it, reaching over and wrapping him in a hug instead. Harry shuddered at the warmth of it, and despite his best efforts, a couple of tears traced their way down his cheeks and onto Ron’s jumper. He was
“Hey, everyone,” Harry said, glancing over the table set up in the back garden. At the far end sat Luna, Neville, and Ginny, who had evidently just said something hilarious, because everyone’s heads were thrown back in laughter, whilst she looked on, smug. Rose’s eyes peeked over the top of the table between Ginny and Hermione, and Harry couldn’t help the warmth bubbling inside him at the sight of his friends, all together, like in the old days. Sure, Fred and George weren’t here—their toy shop on Oxford Street kept them too busy to join, most of the time, and they’d always had other friends anyway—but the rest of his uni family was there, at the house, and so was his beautiful, brilliant boyfriend.
“And?” She was cleaning up now, movements as swift and smooth as an insect over the water.
“What the hell is that even supposed to mean?” McLaggen narrowed his eyes. “Is this your fault? You get into a fight with your girlfriend and she ruins our entire team?”
“How do we want to divide the teams?” she asked, absently dribbling the ball between her feet. This was more a formality than anything else; the teams always got divided the same way, with her and Harry on opposite sides, as they both played professionally. Hermione always sat out and refereed, and Luna and Neville usually counted as a unit, since she was prone to wandering away from the game in favour of observing a honeybee or beetle.
So Coach Shacklebolt found himself with a team that could have been in much worse shape, all things considered, and Harry had made a new friend.
He pulled out his mobile to do so, then groaned.
“You can spend the night here, if you want,” Draco offered. “You’d have to sleep on the sofa, but it seems silly for you to pay that extra fee, when it’s only a few hours different.”
He smiled, but it was a sad smile. He missed living with his friends; over the course of the past year or two, they’d split off and all started to move away. They were all still in Greater London, but it wasn’t the same. Ron and Hermione couldn’t just pop over and chat because they’d heard his footsteps creaking in the flat above. Now they lived a thirty-minute bus ride away, and since they had a child,
“That wasn’t my question,” Harry protested.
journalist? And you never thought to tell me?”
Thankfully, Draco returned before they had to make any banal attempts at conversation, squeezing past Harry once again and placing his hand back on his knee, as if he’d never left.
They crossed Millennium Bridge, weaving between hordes of tourists until they found an open spot, looking over the water. They didn’t have to consult one another to know to stop, and Harry marvelled at how natural this was. A ship was chugging its way up the river beneath them, smog funnelling from its smokestack; and seagulls bobbed over the water; and Draco was silhouetted against the sun, its rays casting his golden hair and angular features in sharp relief. Even though they stood on a crowded bridge in the middle of the city, Harry thought this might have been the closest he had felt to home in months, maybe years.
Draco never answered the text, but there was a knock on Harry’s door at eight sharp. He’d only just come home himself a few minutes prior; Coach Shacklebolt seemed intent on working the team to death.
Draco nodded, the set of his jaw determined, even as his eyes flickered with worry.
The best coffee shop in the world was three blocks away from Harry’s flat, in the dead opposite direction of the Tesco. He usually only let himself pay for it once a week, because he knew he wouldn’t have a football salary his whole life and he had student loans to finish paying, but today, he deserved a trip to Bean Thinking of You.
Harry slipped the thank-you and a twenty-pound note into the paper bag, folded the top back down, and knocked on his neighbour’s door, holding the warm bundle in one hand. When Draco didn’t open, he set it down on his doormat and headed out. He still needed to complain to Luna and to tell Ron and Hermione about everything that had happened last night, and he didn’t want to wait a moment longer.
“I’m Ginny,” she said.
“Could I actually get two of those?” he asked the barista. She nodded, tapping in the order, but since he wasn’t sure if his neighbour liked cardamom buns, he also bought an apple cinnamon danish, a cherry tart, and a chocolate brioche, just in case.
Harry didn’t know if he wanted to hear Draco’s justification. He hardly knew how to breathe. This wasn’t fair. Draco wasn’t allowed to upend his world twice in two weeks. However, if there was an explanation…
“I put you in check.” Draco tapped the offending bishop with one finger.
“What’d I miss?” he asked, his presence evaporating the tension that had settled between Harry and Pansy.
Their faces were only a few inches from each other, and they stared at one another for a heartstopping moment. Harry had to remind himself that despite everything that had happened, this was real, and he could feel the weight of that in his hands as he gently cupped Draco’s jaw. Harry watched as his eyes fluttered closed, then leant in. Their kiss was tentative at first, a question neither of them felt confident enough to answer, but it probed deeper, grew more and more tender as they held each other close. Harry’s heart stirred in his chest, and their eyes blinked open. Draco smiled at him again, pulled him even closer, and the answer to that question was suddenly, achingly clear.
“Erm, yes. Is it all right if I bring a plus-one?”
“How charming.” She took another drag of her cigarette, eyes narrowing at Harry. “You seem all right, even if you are famous.” He opened his mouth to thank her, unsure how else to respond, but she ignored this and continued the speech she had clearly prepared. “However, you should know that nothing on this planet matters more to me than Draco’s happiness, and if I hear a single word about you hurting him, I
“But I… I think I fell in love with you too, and if you’re honest with me from now on, and I’ll be honest with you, I’d like to give this another shot.”
“I hope you don’t mind if I brought some things to garnish our breakfast,” he said by way of introduction, holding up a plump tomato and a couple sprigs of basil. “This smells quite good,” he added.
“So, tell me how you came to find yourself locked out of your flat at this time of night,” Draco said, a hint of a smile poking at the corner of his mouth.
Draco nodded, sensing Harry’s desire to change the subject, and they continued walking along the river. “I got a promotion, so they moved me from the Manchester bureau a year and a half ago,” Draco said.
“Whatever is easiest,” Harry said. He’d given up on staring at his blank mobile screen and instead focused his gaze on Draco’s back as he poured seltzer into two glasses. Harry could see his shoulder blade moving underneath his thin t-shirt, and something deep inside him began to stir. Draco carefully sliced two wedges of lemon and fixed them on the rims of the glasses, then returned to the living room. He held out one of the cups, then took a sip from his own.
“Oh,” Harry said, sounding slightly strangled. “yeah – they um, they look fine.”
“Sorry Mags, you haven’t missed much. Tristan Tanglewood has just told Francis about the curse.”
“Oh, well that’s good for him then,” Penny replied brightly. “I think only the first Pensieve Probe I ever did confirmed a suspect’s innocence. He was accused of doing away with some old witch for her galleons but on the night in question he was sat at home in his boxer shorts watching niffler suit porn.”
“Hmm? Oh yeah, he’ll actually be at the party later, he’s coming down from Scotland with Neville, Hannah and a few other members of staff – you know Nev teaches there.”
Harry jerked his gaze up to where Malfoy had spoken, realizing that the other man was still looking at the screen where Featherhorn had still forgotten to find a new shirt and was now striding up and down what looked like a hospital ward with a stethoscope round his neck. Hermione would have a fit at how Healers were being represented.
“Peasant!” he growled at her before charging out of the shop. Harry jogged to keep up with Malfoy as he stormed angrily down the street before taking a sharp left. Harry watched as the other man leant up against the back wall of Fortescue’s, hidden from the main alley.
“Actually,” Pewterfoot replied, “I decided it would be best for you two to do the honours. I understand you were at school with Draco Malfoy and knew him quite well.”
!” Luna exclaimed. “I actually only contributed to that book, it was edited in full by Enid Monkton.”
Harry sighed miserably as Magalie reached up to try and wipe something from Draco’s cheek, her finger shimmering and dissipating before it made contact with white skin. There was a momentary flicker of something longing in Draco’s grey eyes before he collected himself and turned back to the cooking.
“Yeah,” Harry replied miserably, “apparated about half an hour ago.”
“You know what, never mind,” Ron shouted, “vegan is healthy!” and he spun on his heels before making a hasty exit.
“Oh definitely,” Harry laughed, “I’ve even bribed Charlie Weasley into setting a Hungarian Horntail loose on the celebrations later so I can swoop in and save the day.”
“Yeah, that too. I never invite friends over here because they just look kind of miserable here to be honest, and I get it, it’s dark and the whole place smells a bit like fossilized troll.”
Draco rolled his eyes his agreement, although he had noticed since his return to the Ministry that Potter seemed to have acquired a new set of looser uniform. Witches must be crying their eyes out all over the place.
“No!” Hugo squealed, “The sea witch!”
“Yes,” Luna mystically replied with a contented nod before slurping her own drink which bright pink and adorned with two paper parasols. “Apples suit your hair.”
“Well,” Potter coughed and glanced around them as if to check for witnesses, “kind of, yeah.”
“No good idea ever starts with ‘
“I know a lot about curses,” Malfoy continued, he was biting his lower lip now. Harry had noticed Malfoy often did it when he was deep in thought. Harry half wanted to reach out and stop the other man before it bled again.
“I’ve got a garden,” Potter added pointedly, looking a little shifty as if he was admitting to Draco that he liked to moonlight as a cabaret dancer at weekends. “I,” Potter cleared his throat, running his fingers up and down the gathered condensation of his glass, Draco tracked the movement. “It’s quite a big one, but I never go out there, I mean I want to. I think, I think it would look nice with some roses in it.”
Hermione directed Draco to a spare bedroom upstairs with an attached ensuite. It was all decorated in a very quaint English country cottage style with a Welsh dresser up against one wall and floral wallpaper. A vase of Sweet Williams stood on a table by a small window, out of which Draco could see the party still going in full swing. Someone had set up a charmed croquet set over by the hedge and Neville Longbottom was laughing as he lined up his mallet with a bright red ball.
He held his breath a moment later as Potter leaned in, “Sorry if it felt weird to use your first name like that, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted me to yell your surname in public,” Potter blanched, “I mean – not that you should be ashamed of ‘Malfoy’ or anything –“
“Draco! Hey – over here,” Draco turned to see Bill Weasley beckoning him over. “Glad you’re here,” Bill smiled, “I was just trying to explain to Alexandre about what we’re doing for those frogs at work, only I reckon you’ll explain it better. Oh, Alexandre’s my brother in law by the way,” Bill gestured to the tall blond man stood beside them, “He works as a curse breaker for the Ministère des Affaires Magiques de la France believe it or not.” Bill pulled a sheepish expression, “I’m finding a bit tricky to explain the stratified layers theory in my rudimentary French but Fleur and Gabby have disappeared somewhere.”
Draco stared at Harry’s still sleeping face. There were small, barely there wrinkles at the sides of his eyes and his full lips were slightly dry. He was also devastatingly, horribly handsome, his dark eyelashes twitching and a faint crease appearing between his thick brows.
“Bloody hell,” Harry muttered, shifting on the chair and instinctively reaching down to rearrange the crotch of his trousers.
Over the last thirteen years he’d had little call to interact with the slender, blond ex Slytherin. He knew Malfoy worked on one of the lower levels as he occasionally had to deal with requests for more information regarding improperly filled out auror reports. Malfoy had always managed to infuse his abruptly concise messages with as much distain as possible.
by Cadmus Poenitet,
“The Department are processing the memory vials now, ready for viewing,” Pewterfoot stated, “you’ll begin tomorrow, first thing.”
“Jesus Marls, I know you said he’s creepy but this is pushing it don’t you reckon? You know if you keep harassing my girlfriend like this we’ll put a report in at the Ministry,” Winshaw huffed. Harry felt a wash of sympathy go through his body as Malfoy’s eyes snapped to Marlene’s with a hurt, questioning look. Marlene looked a little uncomfortable but refused to meet Malfoy’s eyes as she gazed across the street.
“It makes no sense!” Draco half shrieked, managing to spray himself in the eye with his apple tonic and blinking gingerly.
, yeah?”
“Bloody hell,” Ron laughed, “look – there’s dad!”
“Yeah, apparently he was a bit surprised because you were sitting with Draco Malfoy?” Terry asked, his eyes flashing curiously as he took a sip of his tea.
“It’s not,” Draco croaked, turning on his side and kissing him again. It was, it was too much, but not in the way Harry was probably worrying about. Besides, if it stopped Draco wasn’t sure he would get through it, in fact he might just dissolve into a puddle in the middle of the bed.
“What is it?” Harry asked quizzically.
“Come
curse?”
“Well,” Malfoy announced, smoothing down his waistcoat, “I suppose this calls for a cup of tea.”
you were going to take it slowly!”
“We pay our custodial staff a lot more,” Hermione replied with a raised eyebrow.
By the time Malfoy arrived home it was grey and raining, dirty puddles had formed in pavement dips and there was a muggy condensation on the apartment windows.
“I think I’ll manage,” Draco replied, “I have an excellent memory and if that fails me, I can always use the Gringotts pensieve.”
“Apart from my house elf Kreacher,” Harry explained, “Hermione and Ron were always saying I should sell it and go somewhere smaller and cosier, but…it’s a link  you know?” he glanced at Draco who was looking pensive. Harry remembered how much history and family heirlooms meant to the other man. The way he treasured the few items he had in his modern muggle flat, so far removed from where he had grown up.
“Oh, you haven’t heard!” Ron’s eyes widened delightedly, “It’s the hot gossip of the department.”
“You’re welcome to go to the Apothecary,” the witch smiled widely, revealing yellowed gums and a missing tooth. “Or you could try Lavendine’s?”
“I agree,” Hermione said, standing up and drawing over to the fire to kneel beside her husband. “But Harry, you won’t be able to keep it a secret from him that you were the one to watch his memories, even if you tried it wouldn’t be right.”
“People like you shouldn’t have power over anyone,” Harry growled, giving Picklemarsh one last withering glare before the memory dissolved into Malfoy pacing up and down back by his own desk.
Harry smiled guiltily as he steered a still wriggling Hugo towards his mother before swimming over to where Draco was sitting. “Are you coming in?” Harry asked. He had taken his glasses off and droplets of water were trailing down Harry’s brown skin, gleaming in the day’s bright sunshine. “You did bring swimmers right? If not, I’m sure Ron’s got a Canon’s orange pair you could borrow?” Harry laughed as Draco glared at him.
Harry swallowed thickly as the other man started to lever himself up from the bath, glistening trails of suds sluicing down his slender torso and pale skin. Malfoy’s nipples were small and surprisingly pink, haloed by barely there golden hairs. Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes as he heard Malfoy’s wet feet on the tiles and the sound of a towel being dabbed against soft, damp skin.
“Why? You not hungry?” Draco replied meekly. Magalie must have sensed the necessary emotional cues from the legilimency bond and immediately swept across the room with a beaming grin.
by Grigori Yefimovich Ras – wait, that’s in the wrong section,” Malfoy tutted before withdrawing the book and placing it on the shelf behind him. He turned back to the Potions sections before letting out a pleased ‘A-ha!”.
The previous week he had summoned Magalie a little too early and when the end of episode had resulted in a cliffhanger Malfoy had turned excitedly on the sofa to register nothing but empty space. Harry had felt his chest constrict uncomfortably as Malfoy’s face had changed, his smile melting into the tight, reserved expression that he wore for most of his day at the Ministry.
Both his and Ron’s robes were hanging open and dripping on the cobblestones. There was also a slightly alarming red stain across Harry’s front where he knew he had been nicked by the bull’s horns. Any minute now, if he remembered correctly…
“You were definitely decent,” Harry smiled, “gave me a run for my money alright.”
Harry made an indignant noise as Draco ignored him and continued talking. “We also still need to go to Diagon Alley to get swimming trunks.”
“H-he wanted to shoot it down for a roast,” Malfoy continued, still chuckling hysterically, “but the Captain said it would be terrible luck and instead gave father a bottle of seaweed shampoo.”
Draco noticed that both Meredith and Matthew had gone quiet and were shooting each other a look. Evidently those who had not been in the U.K. at the time were not fully aware of the history. Draco took a steadying breath before rearranging his features into a dignified expression.
“Yes but I was
“Don’t be absurd,” Draco employed his poshest intonation. “If I was seen publicly digging into a bowl full of Iceberg my entire legacy would be ruined.”
Draco had made it as far as the end of the street before scurrying home and deciding it would be far safer to stay in with Magalie and watch Lilac Close.
“Still wears glasses,” Malfoy hiccoughed, tipping a generous portion of the wine he was drinking into the stew. “But they’re wire framed now and they’re always slipping down that stupid nose of his.”
“Draco, this is brilliant,” Harry exclaimed. “I haven’t had anyone come and give me a homemade birthday cake since Hagrid when I was eleven and found out I was a wizard and this looks a damn sight more edible.”
“No, wait,” Harry shook his head, “I mean just because this is something I really should have waited until we were in private to tell you. Plus, I know Hermione will say I should have given you more time after what happened but then you turned up at my house with a homemade cake and those bloody swimming trunks.”
“Well, you know how Winshaw’s going out with that woman from Draco’s old office?” Ron began.
Draco paused before folding his used napkin up neatly, “I was under the impression that you and the youngest Weasley were no longer an item?” he appeared to be steadfastly avoiding Harry’s eyes.
Harry groaned, letting his face fall into his hands under Hermione’s chastising expression.
“He’s gone home now then?” Neville asked.
“Sod that, you’re getting tap water you cheeky mare,” Seamus snorted.
“Oi, Louis – watch where you’re going!” Harry shouted over at an apologetic looking adolescent with golden hair and freckles.
“Teddy,” Harry cleared his throat to catch the young man’s attention from bickering with his grandmother. “I’d like to introduce you to Draco Malfoy.”
“Hairy gooseberries is incidentally what we call Harry’s –“
“Yeah, thanks Ron,” Harry cleared his throat, “I got that.”
“Lucky I won’t be able to smell you later then,” Magalie laughed as Draco rolled his eyes at her.
A moment later Ron let out a loud shout announcing that the first round of burgers and hotdogs were ready and the crowd shuffled forwards.
“Ginger?” Ron asked, holding out a tin of hard boiled sweets. “Hermione got them for me, apparently they help with the nausea.” Harry knew that Ron struggled a little with pensieve trips, much like muggles would get carsick.
Harry grunted, he had noticed that Malfoy’s colleague had been particularly chatty to anyone and everyone today, clearly taking the opportunity to brag about her booked vacation.
~**~**~
“French girlfriend,” Ron muttered, “that could be a clue you know?”
“You,” Draco sighed as Harry stood in the doorway. “You really are something else Harry Potter.” He laughed wetly before tipping his forehead against his knees. “I’m going to get rid of those bloody marbles first thing tomorrow morning.”
“Keeping count are you?” Winshaw scoffed. Harry didn’t think for one moment that the other auror was genuine in his concerns about Malfoy’s designs on his girlfriend, the arsehat was probably just bored and wanted someone to mess with. “What are you even up to, sneaking about with an unmarked bag?” Winshaw gestured to Malfoy’s bookshop purchase before snatching it from the other man’s hands.
“This is daylight robbery,” Malfoy snapped. The other customers’ tittering had grown louder and Harry half wished he could hex them to shut up.
“Oh alright,” Hermione interrupted with a sigh, “you’re right, it just came as a surprise that’s all. Oh!” she gasped with a suddenly very pleased expression. “This means I’ve a legitimate reason to get rid of all those hideous gardening tools George keeps bringing over. Make sure you take them with you today – I don’t want another repeat of having to explain to Hugo why the watering can has a giant pair of perforated boobs on it.”
“I’d rather go starkers than associate myself with that gaggle of incompetents on brooms,” Draco sniffed.
“I’m sure you do,” Philippe nodded.
“Well yeah,” Harry gave a small smile, “I kept worrying I hadn’t said the right thing in each one so I’d write a new one and the cycle continued.”
After his conversation with Bill and Alexandre, which had excitedly resulted in murmurings of a French – English professional curse breaking exchange conference, Draco had found himself dragged into the middle of debate with Luna and some dubious looking wizards about the application of osseous tissue in potion curatives.
“Salted gillyweed and Cornish fudge,” Harry answered as Draco pulled a face. “Hey – don’t knock it till you’ve tried it, it doesn’t actually taste like pondweed or anything.”
Harry stared at the wall of his and Ron’s shared office, it was an odd shade of painted yellow which clashed with the darkness of the flagstone floor.
“But they were banned in America due to choking hazards and he sent them out as part of a package to Wisconsin,” Harry insisted, “I’m not saying George did it on purpose Ron, that’s my point. It doesn’t necessarily mean the shops dark just because it can be tricky to navigate the minefield that is international wizarding export law.”
“I hate being on a probe,” Penny shuddered, “the last time I went under was to watch the memories of this complete turd who was refusing to admit he had sacrificed a bunch of cats in an effort to resurrect some dark wizard.”
“So you’re here to propose are you?” Draco smirked, leaning against the doorway and folding his arms across his chest. “I can assure you Potter I won’t settle for anything less than four carats.”
“Thank you Harry, I deduced that on account of excelling at ‘smart stuff’,” Draco replied dryly. He turned back to Bill before freezing. Large white scars were ridged across the man’s cheeks, it was painfully evident what they were from and with a barely repressed shudder Draco put the pieces together, remembering how Fenrir Greyback had apparently mauled one of the Weasley brood. This was Draco’s fault, this man’s face was Draco’s fault. Draco waited for Harry and Bill to announce that they had actually poisoned the Pimms and Draco was now going to suffer a miserable metamorphosis into a flobberworm before they trod on him.
Draco sighed in a put-upon way, even as he smirked back at Harry. “Yes, I suppose that was our arrangement.”
Draco shrugged again. “I can ask, but it should be fine. I put in more than enough overtime to justify a morning off. That is, if you want me to come.” He bit his lip and glanced away, the vulnerability in his expression thickening the air between them.
“No complaints! I’ve just been repotting orchids,” he said, gesturing to the plants on the counter in front of him. “They get a bit temperamental when I don’t give them enough attention.”
“I’ll take that as a compliment.” Draco’s voice was breezy as he arranged tomato slices and basil leaves around their plates. When he was satisfied with his handiwork, he pushed one back toward Harry, then held out a hand for a fork. Wordlessly, Harry passed it to him. “By the way, I got the go-ahead from my supervisor to come with you today. Remind me when we need to leave?”
It was only seven thirty the next morning, but it was already shaping up to be a shite day. Harry had forgotten to set his alarm and didn’t wake up until seven fifteen, almost two hours late. When he’d seen ambient light entering through the cracks between his blinds as he awoke, the jolt in his gut had immediately told him something was wrong. Fifteen minutes later, he was sprinting toward Liverpool Street Station, his football bag banging against his thigh with every step. Grey clouds skulked low in the sky, threatening an imminent storm. He blew past the daily newspaper sellers and a middle-aged man holding out a marker and t-shirt for an autograph, then tumbled down the steps of the escalator, barely entering the train car before the doors hissed shut behind him. As soon as it began moving, he dropped his duffel between his feet and collapsed against a pole, taking what felt like his first breath of the morning.
The front door clicked shut, and Hermione and Ron filed back into the kitchen to join them around the chessboard.
“Thanks for tonight, Harry!” he called out. “I had fun!”
“Would you like anything to drink?” Draco asked, standing up and stretching. He moved to put the pen in his hand behind his ear, but finding the space already occupied, he hurriedly set it back on top of the folder instead.
Harry turned a final corner, head down to brace against the gloomy weather. He reflexively shivered as he stepped into The Painted Plant, the rich scents of pigment and earth drifting into his lungs. He flicked his wet hair out of his eyes, wiped his glasses off on a dry patch on his t-shirt, then made his way over to where Neville stood behind a counter. The shop was cluttered but in a cosy way, hand-painted flowerpots interspersed with Luna’s paintings. Together, they filled most of the flat surfaces in the room.
“Trust me, my imagination is not that good.” Harry laughed. “Now, if I may ask, why were you awake when I knocked?”
” Harry sprinted after the car and pounded on the back window. Zacharias turned toward the sound and lowered the passenger window.
Zacharias finally looked chagrined. “Oh. Sorry. I’ll pop the boot for you.”
He pulled out a sheet of paper and the fountain pen Draco had given him, then shook his head. This was stupid. As Draco had once said, they both had perfectly good mobile phones.
. If anyone could bring England back into the running for the World Cup, it was the team’s new attacking midfielder, Harry Potter.
He folded the blanket, leaving it and the pillow stacked on the arm of the settee. He unplugged his mobile from the wall and left the charger coiled on the coffee table, cleaned out their glasses in the sink and moved the coasters to their station on the kitchen counter. Harry appraised his handiwork and frowned. It was still obvious that someone had spent the night on the couch, but he didn’t know what else he could do to tidy up. He’d have to make it up to Draco another way.
Thunder boomed overhead; lightning split the sky. A wet finger of rain trickled down Harry’s neck; droplets clung to his curls of hair; moisture fogged his glasses.
“Bonsoir,” Draco replied. “How was the flight?”
“Are you sure? I don’t want to be a bother, or more of a bother than I already am, I guess.” Harry fought a yawn, and his head inadvertently flopped back on the couch behind him before Draco could answer. His eyelids were fluttering, and he forced them back open, then forced himself to make bleary eye contact with the man in front of him.
“This can get a bit aggressive,” Harry murmured to Draco. “You don’t have to play. I’m sure Hermione wouldn’t mind the company.”
“How about Thursday, at seven?”
“Any luck?”
“Yes, obviously, you won. I was hoping for a little more detail. The long version, if you will,” Draco said.
“But I like your name,” Harry blurted, then blushed magnificently. Moments like this reminded him why he had a job that didn’t require him to talk. Draco’s usual smirk widened into a blinding grin, and then he closed the gap between their hands, lacing their fingers together. Harry’s breath caught in his throat, and he could feel his pulse hammering all the way through him, which meant Draco could probably feel it too. They held each other’s gaze across the table, not saying a word; for the first time, Harry understood what it meant to get lost in someone’s eyes, because Draco’s were so grey and so deep that he thought he might fall into them.
“Draco said that you’re neighbours?” A smoke ring floated toward Harry, and he did his best not to cough.
By the time he arrived at Dalston Junction, it had started to rain again, and he wanted to kick himself for leaving his umbrella at work the day before. Drops of water sluiced the grit from the pavement and pushed pedestrians into the shops they passed. Their interiors hummed with a golden warmth, contrasting with the grey pattering of rain outside.
“Thanks for coming over,” Draco abruptly said, withdrawing his hand and snapping Harry out of the moment. He stood and began carting plates back over to the kitchen, and Harry had to stare down at the table, at his forlorn hand atop it, for a solid minute to register what had happened. When he did, he stood as suddenly as Draco had done and followed him into the kitchen, where he was putting the dishes and food away with the same adroit efficiency he had exhibited before the meal.
His decision made, Harry turned back around and marched up to the door. He didn’t know anything about the person who lived inside, but this night couldn’t get any worse, right? Before he could change his mind, he raised his fist and knocked.
“Yes. Are you?”
confused. You two seemed to have something really special when you brought him over here. And he put up with all of us. That isn’t nothing.”
“So I finished the article. I didn’t feel right sending it in, but I couldn’t ignore what I had found. That would destroy my journalistic integrity. I finally decided to email my boss and explain that I couldn’t continue the investigation because I’d got too close to the case. My plan was to request she send it on to a coworker, and I’d provide him with all the notes I’d collected in ways unconnected to you.”
“I have one more question,” Harry said.
Harry nearly turned around when he saw the cheery yellow flowers blossoming in Ron and Hermione’s front garden. He didn’t want to bother his friends with his problems when they had plenty of their own concerns to deal with—Hermione’s baby was due in less than a month, and Harry suddenly couldn’t even remember if Ron was working from home today or not. This had been a stupid idea, although it wasn’t quite as stupid as falling in love with his neighbour had been. He felt like he might sick up; a wave of dizziness made him stumble against the front stoop as the realisation of what had happened hit him once again, full-force.
Whilst Ron chatted with Luna and Neville at the front door, Draco slid one of his pieces across the chessboard.
“Quite right,” Zacharias said, as if he had made this geographic discovery himself. “But there’s an excellent beach just past it, and I thought you’d like it.”
“My ex is the one who leaked the news,” Harry blurted, then gulped down half a glass of water, so he could avoid seeing everyone’s reactions. When he set it down, the whole team was still staring at him.
“Maybe a little,” Harry grinned. “Sorry.”
“I honestly don’t understand why he orders those friend charms,” Harry shook his head, “I know he runs into a fair bit of prejudice still, but honestly he’s really funny and always has tons to talk about. Just the other day he was going on about this article on cutlery imbued with the Erysichthon curse and didn’t Bill co-author that?”
Harry watched as Malfoy pulled out a mid-sized hardback with a woodblock style print cover. He could see that it was the book that Malfoy had enquired about and the other man wore a faint smile as he opened to a random page containing botanical drawings and potions related arithmancy formulae. Harry was sure Hermione would have been able to understand what the book was about but all Harry could deduce was that it was some sort of potions theory.
“Perhaps you’re right though,” Malfoy sighed, glancing back to the decrepit looking houseplant, “maybe I should throw that suicidal fauna out and buy a plastic one instead.”
“Harry Potter,”
“But you said the food was good?” Harry ventured, not sure what else he could offer on this topic of conversation, having very little idea what either a Noboskian Gnome or a Callipian Cobshackle was.
The end of Draco’s sentence was cut off by howls of laughter from the rest of the table.
happened, after you came in Draco got all mortified and then refused to be alone with me for the rest of the afternoon.”
Harry Potter and his constant shadow, Ronald Weasley, were part of that ever so cool clique of aurors that strolled lazily down the Ministry’s hallways.  Their deep red robes rippling behind them, their knee high, dragon hide boots echoing around the stone walls. The office workers on various floors had been known to congregate and coo whenever the aurors were nearby.
“Don’t be ridiculous mate, this is our job,” Ron responded. “Even Malfoy will have to recognize that, especially if his memories clear him. Plus, Pensieve Probes aren’t yet acknowledged in French courts and that’s where he’d be heading.”
“I can…” Harry asked questioningly, his eyes were narrowed assessingly and he was staring at Draco in a way that made the other man want to hide back under the duvet.
“No idea,” Ron shrugged, “but obviously with Boot being the one to catch them, half the Ministry knew by Monday and apparently Marlene punched Winshaw in the middle of the main atrium!”
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco groaned, “not fit for polite society.”
“So what happened then?” Ron asked, “After I left you to it? Please tell me Mione and I don’t need to seal up that room permanently.”
“Watch it!” Ron chuckled. “That’s my missus.”
Upon further inspection, Draco could confirm that the other pots harboured similar contents. There were thirty marbles in total, a month’s supply if you used them daily. Draco opened up a small parchment with a colour coded key on it explaining the details of the charms.
“I’ve always been fascinated by the theory of rapid calcination precluding true distillation in restorative draughts,” Hermione added thoughtfully.
“You git!” Harry announced with a laugh as he stuck his head through into Ron and Hermione’s living room. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Malfoy stared at the card for a moment, the very corner of his mouth twitching up slightly before he nodded and pocketed it.
“No, but I’m going to,” Draco replied firmly. “I’m going to help Bill with this new curse they’re trying to crack. Did you know they’ve had to set up a temporary lily pad pond to house all the victims?”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, although he was still smiling. He thought about where Malfoy might be in a month’s time. Pewterfoot had heavily implied that Malfoy’s Ministry pay was suspended whilst the investigation was ongoing. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if this meant the other man wouldn’t be able to get his monthly package of Pop Up Pals.
“You say you’re fine, but you are clearly cooking shepherd’s pie,” Magalie replied, narrowing her honey amber eyes at the other man. “You always say that is ‘comfort food’.”
Potter and Weasley must have laughed themselves silly as Draco tried to levitate a host of mirrors at the right angle so as to get a good look at the back of his head.
Draco frowned as Harry burst out laughing beside him and Andromeda threw up her hands despairingly. “For the
Draco froze in shock for a moment before gathering his wits back up. “What on Earth are you blathering about Potter?” He snapped, secretly trying to recall whether he had used the geranium or the lavender potion this morning. A receding hairline was probably one of Draco’s biggest insecurities, ever since some nasty wench in Diagon Alley had laughed that Draco was going to end up resembling the psychopath he had once served.
“I took a chance on you, you know!” Picklemarsh huffed. “It’s not like you were exactly qualified for this job.”
“No, it’s nothing,” Harry split apart his custard cream as Andromeda rolled her eyes. She had always said Harry was as bad as toddler when it came to table manners. “I’ve just, I mean, I’ve run into Draco Malfoy a few times recently,” Harry winced as he tried to word it in a way that wouldn’t reveal too many confidential case details.
“Potter just walked into that job you know,” Malfoy continued, the saucepan bubbling happily away behind him. “You don’t need Newts when you’re the Saviour apparently. And oh, Lisi, you should have
“Fine, I’ll take tea,” Harry replied. The two of them edged forwards, trying to work out the flask’s contents when suddenly the door banged open with a jolt. All three of them flinched violently, Malfoy causing himself to splutter slightly and spill a thick red fluid on his sleeve.
There was a letter of appreciation for his patronage from Camille as always, although Draco guessed the letters were mass produced by now and signed with a standard charm. Then there were six small silver pots. Draco flicked open the lid of the first pot with his perfectly trimmed nail and peered inside, sure enough there were five different coloured marbles held within.
“Doubt it,” Ron replied, scrunching up his face. “I reckon if Pewterfoot had said it would be me and you rooting around in here, Malfoy would probably have refused to give them up. Bugger would probably have walked himself straight to Azkaban.”
“Quite alright,” Draco nodded primly, “I was just enjoying a lovely conversation with your brass knocker.”
“No,” Draco gasped, the last thing he needed was more suspicion that he was up to his old tricks. He wished he had never brought the bloody occamy eggs up in the first place, he had only been trying to impress Granger.
Harry wondered how offended Molly would be if he formally emancipated himself from the Weasley family?
“Oh,” Harry blinked in surprise. “I live at Grimmauld Place, my godfather Sirius left it to me.”
“Maybe it’s just Malfoy?” Ron asked as the memory morphed to take them inside a small London apartment. “He’s always rubbed people the wrong way, can’t imagine he’s changed that much?”
“You know I’m sure we could smoke it out if needs be,” Winshaw continued, smirking at his girlfriend, who rolled her eyes.
“Harry?”
“Fuck!” Malfoy swore, reaching out to bat a load of papers off its surface. He stared at them, breathing hard for a moment before his shoulders slumped dejectedly and he fell to his knees, gathering them all back up.
“Well, three and a large attic,” Harry nodded.
“Yeah,” Harry frowned at where the wand was turning slightly tacky from the warmth of his hand. “He should be getting out right about now.”
“I was thinking of planting some wailing wisteria,” Harry informed her, “it’s a great potions substitute for Bitter Root you know,” Harry realised he was just regurgitating what Malfoy had said.
“Jesus, Malfoy,” Harry croaked, shifting uncomfortably on his seat. He wanted to say something humorous to break the weird tension in the room, like ‘
~**~**~
“Course she does,” Ron snorted, “Ten years of marriage mean I’ve learned not to make rookie mistakes. Actually, she’s inviting some her friends from Mungo’s too, do you remember Silvia and Momoko? Nice couple, moved over from the States a few years back.”
Hermione thankfully relented with a pointed look at Harry before the conversation redirected itself to the latest Quidditch draft. Harry knew that Ron would have told his wife who it was they were investigating. Sure enough, an hour later, after a few of the couple had left and the pub had quietened down, Hermione lent into Harry with a questioning expression.
“It’s been an hour already? Draco cast a tempus charm in shock.
Harry thought a little guiltily of the large patch of untended wilderness that lurked out the back door of Grimmauld Place. He wasn’t sure that the forest of nettles had seen a pair of shears in the last half a century. Sirius had certainly never fussed over his begonias or potting compost.
Pansy and Harry nodded, then followed Draco down the terminal to Heathrow’s monolithic car park, Pansy’s suitcase wheeling behind them. They were chatting easily, an even flow of French and English interspersed with loud laughter reaching Harry’s ears. He didn’t precisely know what they were talking about—he hadn’t studied French since he was twelve—but he could hear their joy at being reunited in the cadence of their voices, and that was enough.
Draco raised an eyebrow and turned to him, slack-jawed.
“Why’d you move in with your godfather? If you don’t mind me asking…” Draco was still pointedly looking over the water, his shoulders bunched by his ears.
“Check.” He smirked up at Harry, who grinned back at him.
Draco came back with two coupes laden with beef bourguignon and a basket of French bread, still warm. Harry’s jaw dropped to the floor.
“Remarkable,” she finally said, stepping away. “Draco, you did not do his eyes justice in your letters.”
It took Harry too long to realise that Zacharias wasn’t actually driving him home. Maybe he really was ill—the clock had jumped a couple hours forward, and it was pitch dark outside; only the Volkswagen’s headlights and the fluorescent flashes of the motorway’s lamps lit the sky.
“Oh. All right.” Several moments passed, and Harry stared out the front window, trying to distinguish the reflection of the lights in the bus from the innards of the city.
“I do, don’t I?” Draco’s tone was thoughtful, even as his eyes danced. He pulled Harry in for another kiss. “I’ll see you later.”
“Draco, I know you’re home. I can see the light is on.” A beat passed.
“Oh. Sorry, I didn’t realise you followed football,” Harry admitted.
“You’re so dramatic.”
“She’s the one you should direct all of your complaints about Celestina Warbeck to,” Harry stage-whispered to Draco. He and Ginny rolled their eyes in unison, then smirked at each other, and something in Harry’s stomach eased, seeing his boyfriend and one of his best friends already bonding over something, even if that something was teasing him.
have pressured you to come out to your parents, and it would have been… courteous of you to tell me you covered my bloody team—”
The door opened, a chubby-cheeked toddler half-hidden in its shadow. Rose looked Harry up and down, then turned to the empty hall behind her and shouted, “Dad! Uncle Harry is here!”
“Zacharias!
of them liked her music. And he thought about how home had begun to feel like it was supposed to for the first time since the car accident that had stolen his parents. The declaration that he had been in love before, but it had never felt like this, like it was going to keep flowing into perpetuity, as comfortable as a daily stroll along the Thames, was on the tip of his tongue, before he remembered who sat before him. But Pansy seemed to understand what he wasn’t saying, and she arched one eyebrow as she nodded, satisfied, then stubbed her cigarette out on the edge of the glass ashtray in front of her.
He finally dashed into the restaurant, ten minutes late for his reservation, skin damp with some combination of sweat and shower water and the heavy air that came with London’s constant cloud cover. His glasses had fogged up, and he had to stop in the doorway to clean them off on his flannel shirt.
Draco paused, his drink halfway to his mouth, and stared at Harry. He self-consciously wiped at his chin again.
missed his stop. Until today, he hadn’t had to double back on the Tube in at least six months, but such records must always be broken. Had Harry possessed half a brain, surely he should have cancelled the date then, but still no.
“Pardon?” the man said, his newspaper rustling as he set it down, an oddly crisp sound against the chatter around them.
Ron beamed. “I like this one,” he told Harry, clapping Draco on the shoulder. “You should keep him around.”
Her eyes flashed with recognition as she saw them from across the swath of tile, and she waltzed over to the couple, leaning in to kiss Draco on both his cheeks.
“If you ever read the paper—”
Luna laughed, the sound of it tinkling and breathy. “No, I won’t ask you to do that. But I was right to set you up with him. It’s as right as purple grass. I can feel it.”
As it turned out, Draco was an excellent listener. He laughed in the right places, chin tipped upward and the corners of his eyes crinkling with mirth. He raised a single impeccable, incredulous eyebrow when Harry told him about waking up on the outskirts of Bristol.
Harry withdrew his hand. “Oh. Right. Sorry. This is a bit embarrassing, but I’ve managed to lock myself out, and my mobile is dead, so I was wondering if you had a charger I could borrow or anything? I’m so sorry to be a bother, it’s just been an awful night.”
Draco didn’t deny it.
Harry remembered the notes Draco had left on his door waxing rhapsodic about danishes, of all things, and the way he had stood silhouetted against the sun, the furtive glances and hand squeezes. His heart clawed its way up his throat.
“Mate.” It was Ron who cut in this time. “I’d be confused too. Hell, I
“It’s nice to meet you,” Draco said in a measured tone, holding a hand out for Ron to shake. “So sorry we’re late—this one here got a little carried away when we were buying your presents.”
“Twelve years? That’s a long time.”
Harry prised the door open, and there Draco stood as if Harry had dreamt him up, hands clasped in front of him and his mouth set in a thin line. He still wore his work clothes, but his hair was a mess, like he’d been fisting his hands through it, and there was that bloody pen behind his ear, as always. Harry’s stomach dropped, and he opened the door a bit wider, then stepped back to let Draco in.
Two breaths passed as they sized one another up, carefully avoiding eye contact, and suddenly, all of Harry’s rage bubbled to the surface. “You’re a
“Go ahead and take a seat,” Draco said, motioning Harry toward a sleek suede sofa in the front room. “I have an iPhone, but I might have a couple old chargers buried in a desk drawer somewhere too.”
“Harry.” Hermione’s tone was firm, and his mouth snapped shut. “This isn’t your fault. Your coach made the choice to engage in illegal activity, and Draco made the choice to expose that. Maybe your relationships with them provided that opportunity, but you can’t blame yourself for it. You couldn’t have known.”
He loved London on Sunday mornings, especially when the weather was like this: the cool side of perfect, a gentle breeze wicking the sweat from the nape of his neck. There were people on the streets, strolling with their families or taking photos in front of shops with brick backdrops, but it was nothing like the chaos of a Monday morning, when everyone was
“Harry!” Neville called out, grinning. He had a swipe of dirt across his cheek, and a larger streak of it on his smock. “How’s it going?”
“But it’s true!”
“Draco.”
“Thanks for this morning,” Harry said as they climbed up the three flights of stairs to their floor.
The envelope was made of creamy, thick paper, and his name was written across its back in perfect cursive. Harry tore it open and pulled out the note inside.
Harry glanced back down at his mobile, praying to anyone who might be listening that it would be charged enough for him to turn it on and leave the worst night of his life behind, but the battery remained stubbornly dead.
“It felt like a dream the whole way through, not because you were Harry Potter, but because you were
He scanned the front page, unable to comprehend what he saw there. He knew his teammates had to be concerned about the photo of Coach Scrimgeour in handcuffs, or perhaps the headline announcing all of his drug charges. But Harry’s eyes skipped straight past that, to the impossibility printed beneath the headline:
“That should work.”
Harry’s mobile lit up on the arm of the sofa, Apple’s logo blazing up at the ceiling, but Draco didn’t comment on it, so Harry decided to ignore it as well. He began his story, and he couldn’t help but think that this was rather a nice ending to the shittiest night in history.
“Let me know if you need anything else,” Draco said. Harry looked on with amazement.
“I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of London,” he thought aloud. He could feel Draco’s eyes on him, but when he turned toward him, Draco was staring down into the river, both hands on his coffee cup.
into Harry’s hands. “Didn’t you see the paper this morning?”
Harry plugged his mobile in, made sure it was charging, and waited for a few minutes. Draco scrawled something in the corner of one of the sheets in his file.
Harry’s flat a couple New Years ago.
Draco pursed his lips, feigning deep thought. “No, nothing comes to mind.”
“Is there anything I can do to help?” he asked.
Harry nodded, and he couldn’t prevent the smile climbing onto his cheeks.
dance to Ginny’s Celestina Warbeck CD, since
Neville, Luna, and Harry blew out the candles and traipsed into the house, and sure enough, Luna’s paintbrush was lying on the coffee table, and Ron and Draco were lounging around a chessboard in the kitchen. Ron was clearly delighted to have found someone who was willing to play him, someone who hadn’t learnt any better, yet, and Draco appeared to be enjoying himself as well. Spices and various recipes littered the counter around them, and between turns, he perused them, occasionally offering a thought to Ron, who would inevitably laugh and provide his own feedback. Harry watched them from the doorway for a few minutes, not wanting to interrupt whatever bonding was taking place, but eventually Draco caught his eye and motioned him in. He leant on the other side of the counter and stared down at the chessboard; surprisingly, Draco was holding his own against the group’s undisputed chess master.
“Really?” Draco’s grin lit up the entire room, and Harry had never loved it more.
“Hello,” the man said, standing up and reaching over to shake Harry’s hand. “I’m Zacharias Smith. So nice to meet you.”
“Draco,” Harry finally said. “Wow. That’s a lot.”
Ginny was up to something when she’d asked to borrow his mobile on Thursday.
, see, and I—well, I’ve always had a bit of an obsessive streak.” He stood up and made his way back over toward the kitchen. His back was turned to Harry, but he kept speaking as he picked up the knife and halved lemon sitting on the countertop. “At least, that’s how my mates put it. There’s an important case I’ve been working on for quite some time, and even though I’ve used up all my leads, I can feel that I’m on the edge of a breakthrough.” Harry heard the bite of the knife cutting through the fruit, and Draco returned with a new lemon wedge in hand, sitting himself back on the edge of the armchair. “So I’ve been going through all my notes for hours, trying to see if I’ve missed something along the way.”
“Your boyfriend’s got a point, you know,” Pansy added, flashing a wink back toward Harry.
Harry turned away from the sink to look at Draco, whose hands were worrying their way through his platinum hair. “I see.”
Dinner carried on in much the same way as the car ride had done. Harry could tell that Pansy still didn’t quite trust him, and he had no clue what was going on when his tablemates slipped back into coarse, rapid-fire French, but that wasn’t the point. Draco had let him meet his best friend, despite his obvious apprehension at the prospect of it, and Harry could tell they cared for one another deeply. That mattered far more than whether he and Pansy were also destined to be best mates.
, when commuters acted as if those around them were roadblocks instead of other living, breathing humans.
“Thank
“Pansy can blow a mean smoke ring,” Harry informed him, and Pansy smirked once again.
“You want to come back to mine after all?” he asked, smirking.
“Is this all right?” Harry whispered.
Draco shook his head and smiled sheepishly, disarmingly. Harry’s stomach seemed to have wedged itself between his waterlogged shoes. “I got a bit distracted.”
“We’re almost to Bristol!” Seeing the incredulity on Harry’s face, he rushed into an explanation. “You said you weren’t well, and the sea air always makes me feel better, and I wanted to spend more time with you.”
Harry smiled down at his mobile as he pulled a suit out of his locker. Today, he was finally meeting Draco’s parents. Draco was still nervous about it, even though he pretended not to be; Harry had told him repeatedly that they didn’t have to do this, but Draco insisted that it was time.
Harry said his thanks and made his way over, picking past a glass coffee table covered in canvases, a row of sunflowers nodding toward a lamp, and a cluster of snow pea plants beginning to bud. Despite the clutter, there was an airiness and a joy to the shop; it was a place that made you feel at home.
“Actually, water would be lovely. Thank you.”
. Before he could second-guess himself, he tucked the message into the soil of the potted pansy, placed it on Draco’s doormat, and retreated into his flat, mind still spinning.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to embarrass you. You can sit wherever you want. I just picked here because it’s easiest to see from the field. Do you want to meet by the entrance to grab lunch at one?”
“But then I started developing feelings for you. Alarmingly quickly, I might add. I’d never felt so conflicted. I don’t know that I ever would have asked you out if it weren’t for the case, but I… I really liked you the whole time. I think I fell in love with you, actually.” He bit his lip. Harry nearly forgot about the water glasses and the lemon sitting atop the counter as he sneaked his way back into the living room. They couldn’t have this conversation with him relegated to the kitchen.
“What’s this?” Draco said, frowning down at it. “A key? Please tell me you didn’t lose yours again. The kiosk down the street doesn’t stock your keychain anymore. What a disgrace it would be if yours had to say ‘Diggory’ instead.”
“We’re nearly forty minutes late and you didn’t wrap your present. I don’t need to tell them—it’s already rather obvious.”
“Shut up, Gin. I saw you Thursday.”
“This is my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy,” Harry said. “And Draco, this is my best friend, Ron Weasley.”
“I’m so glad you’re here,” she said in her pleasant but businesslike manner. “I really thought you weren’t going to come. Forty minutes, Harry.”
Harry sat back, the wind knocked from his lungs; his football bag fell to the ground with a thump. A tide of emotion was rising through him and he hurriedly gulped it down, reminding himself to inhale, exhale. He pressed his face into his hands, trying to make the thoughts stop coming, or at least trying to make them wait their turn and enter his mind single-file. As it stood, images and ideas ripped through him, one after another after another, whirling past his outstretched fingers when he tried to focus on just one.
Grinning to himself, Harry checked inside the envelope, and sure enough, it had a ten-pound note, a fountain pen, and a horrible keychain, shaped like a red jersey with “10” and “Potter” emblazoned onto the back. Oh, he was
“I’m a man of many talents.” His smirk grew into that same unrestrained grin from their first date, the one Harry was starting to recognise as a sign that Draco was feeling exhilarated enough to no longer care what he looked like, and Harry was absolutely weak for it.
“Really?” he finally asked.
“Oh. Wow. Do you like it here?”
Harry’s arms released him as Draco turned onto his back and Harry moved to be on top of him, deepening the kiss but slowing it down. Draco moaned under the intensity of it, surging up to chase Harry’s lips as the other man drew back with a smile.
“Well I suppose someone had to see it,” Draco said, “now was there a reason you wanted to meet Potter –“
“Blimey,” Ron laughed awkwardly, “no wonder he didn’t want to give up his memories. A bit embarrassing for him isn’t it?”
seeing him like this.
“Excuse me?” Hermione put her hands on her hips. “Harry what exactly have you been teaching my children?”
“And of course, the load is meant to be shared,” Hermione added with a half hearted glare at her husband. Ron grimaced guiltily before looking back at Harry.
Harry had only come fully back to his senses when he realised the memory had progressed to back in the bathroom and the other man was unbuttoning his fly.
“Ridiculous,” Malfoy murmured as he read another paragraph and scratched a question mark beside some unintelligible handwriting. Harry laughed again, it was almost like they were having a conversation.
Draco choked noisily before looking up to see Luna Lovegood staring serenely at him from next to Potter. Potter himself had gone a peculiar shade of red as if he was trying not to laugh, the bastard.
“Ron and Seamus always yell the answers,” she sighed sufferingly at Draco.
“Wait!” Harry cried. “Shit, Malfoy – I remember on Tuesday you put a marble in the sugar pot!” He jumped up and rushed over to the shelf, pointing at the antique Wedgwood sugar pot that stood next to Narcissa’s card. “Come on Malfoy, just remember please – it’s right here!”
“Anything for you Harry?” Ron asked, looking back as he pressed an assortment of buttons like he was cracking the Enigma machine.
“Fair enough,” Terry shrugged, “if you say he’s alright, Harry.”
“You had lunch with Harry Potter on Monday?” Meredith asked, her eyes gleaming.
“Thanks Mione,” Harry grinned, “what about you Hugbear? Don’t I get a birthday cuddle from my favourite godson?”
Harry’s large hand snaked round to grab Draco’s arse cheek, pinching into the flesh. His thumb grazed the hem of Draco’s trousers, dipping just below the fabric and stroking the skin. Draco leaned forwards to allow Harry better access, pressing the other man’s face against his chest and panting into the crown of his head.
“That…might be even stranger,” Draco concluded, although he looked a little less like he was reconsidering occupying the same space as Harry ever again. “What on Earth do you rap about?”
“You okay?” Harry spoke quietly as he wrapped his own hand around Draco’s bicep.
“Yeah,” Harry grumbled, “drinks are on me tonight.”
After the second finger brushed his prostate Draco allowed to himself to succumb to the pleasure, rotating his hips as Harry rubbed inside of him. Harry drew off Draco’s prick with a loud pop, grinning as he stretched Draco wide and added a third, thick finger, thrusting into his hole whilst Draco whined and pushed the side of his face into the pillow.
“But I’m not down?” Harry screwed up his face. “Are you telling me I’ve been a miserable git for months and no one’s thougt to say anything? Have I been bringing the mood down at pub nights or something?”
“No!” Harry burst out laughing, Draco was now looking completely revolted. “Rap as in rap music, like speaking really fast to a beat.”
“Oh?” Philippe smiled. “Tell me more.”
“Glad to hear you appreciate my own particular brand of insanity Potter,” Draco sighed, throwing the used tissue over to the waste bin before glancing at Harry. “I’m quite tired now, I think I might get into bed.”
“Didn’t really have any plans,” Harry replied, “was thinking of maybe checking out the garden.”
~**~**~
“You brought me a cinnamon swirl?” Draco asked suspiciously, his fingers already having moved of their own accord and taken the pastry before settling it on top of the desk in front of him.
He fast forwarded the rest of the day until it was the end of work and Malfoy was walking up the steps to the atrium with his briefcase in hand. Ahead of them there was a sudden flash of red and the sound of loud laughter. Harry flinched as Draco suddenly plastered himself against the wall, his briefcase up by his chest as if to shield himself.
Harry pushed himself away from where he had been leaning against the wall, stalking over to stare more closely at Magalie’s face. She seemed completely unperturbed that her boyfriend had just stuck his hand through her spine.
~**~**~
“Damn, I was thinking of setting you up with my friend Terrence but if you’ve already got the great Harry Potter after you,” Matthew grinned, like a shark with too many teeth.
Malfoy’s long fingers were wrapped tightly around his rigid prick, which had swollen purple with arousal. It was so much darker than the rest of his complexion but at the same time fitted him so well, long and slender.
“How do you even choose?” Draco drawled, gesturing at Harry’s current attire.
Harry turned in the direction Lisette was pointing to see the common wizarding houseplant in a very sad state. The leaf of each frond was meant to emit a different note and were one to brush past a healthy specimen it would emit a lovely sounding harmony. Malfoy’s plant, however, had turned an alarming shade of yellow.
“You can fuck me,” Draco stated quietly.  “I’d like you to.”
There was something dulled about the outfit though, whilst the individual garments were clearly meticulously cared for, it was obvious that they weren’t new. The trousers were very slightly faded in places and there was a barely visible, but still there, tear in the brocade material of the waistcoat. In fact, the only item of clothing that seemed to be in perfect shape were Malfoy’s polished shoes.
“Yeah,” Bill leaned back in his chair, “but for some reason you’re more well read on the subject of object curse removal than half of my subordinates. Plus, I think you’ve got some pretty nifty ideas. Look, if I’m bothering you I can leave? It’s no skin off my nose.” Bill grinned as Draco’s eyes were automatically drawn to Bill’s scarred nose where most of the skin had evidently been clawed off.
“Stupid buffoon,” Malfoy added, causing Harry to gape indignantly at him. “Always running headfirst into trouble. God forbid someone else get the glory.”
“Blimey,” Ron exclaimed, “I can imagine, don’t reckon you’ve ever taken a day off?”
“I think I might be,” Harry nodded.
would have been in the corner with a nice glass of Pimms debating politics.”
“You don’t have to go,” Draco blurted out, turning a peculiar shade of pink. “I mean, don’t get the wrong idea. I’m not suddenly in the mood for hanky panky or anything.”
“Mon dieu!” Magalie cried as she appeared on the sofa, glass of wine already in hand. Her other hand was clutching at her chest and her eyes fixed on the screen. Harry looked to see what the fuss was about. One of the main characters, Francis Featherhorn, was, for some inexplicable reason, already topless and soaking wet. Apparently in the first minute of the episode he had managed to dive off a bridge so as to rescue Madeline Mosspebble from a river that really looked far too large and ferocious to be existing in the quiet corner of Berkshire where the soap was set.
“No, I mean,” Draco huffed, realising that everyone was looking curiously at him. “It was an apology bun, for something that happened at lunch on Monday.”
“You!” Draco shouted, causing the boy to inhale his snack before coughing violently. “I’m looking for Odette Seaver,” Draco continued, unperturbed as the boy coughed and glared at him. “I need help with these damn Italian forms and she –“ Draco rooted around in his pocket before drawing out the embossed business card, “she gave me her card!” Draco wasn’t particularly sure why he needed to add that last detail, for all this miniature cretin knew, Draco and Odette could be life long friends.
“And he wonders why he’s not my favourite godson,” Harry muttered.
“Did you sleep well?” Harry asked, reaching out to draw Draco into a gentle, chaste kiss.
“Piss off,” Harry grunted as Ron burst out laughing again.
“You have another friend named Penny?” Penny frowned but looked amused.
“Wouldn’t have wanted any other way,” Harry grinned, there was something unsaid in his expression. “Besides, I wouldn’t worry, there’s a big joint party with Neville tomorrow at Ron and Hermione’s house.  I’d like you to come actually.”
“He brought a new piece today,” Ron continued as Harry chanced a glance at Penny. The other witch was blushing but was clearly struggling not to laugh as Ron described the new hose nozzle that George had designed.
“Some sort of clerk?” Harry ventured, feeling a little guilty. There were hundreds of people working in the Ministry and other than the big name roles like auror or unspeakable, he hadn’t really ever put much effort into finding out what they all got up to.
“Well that’s politicians for you,” Philippe replied from the sofa.
“Draco Malfoy you unbelievable prat!” Harry screamed, half worrying that Ron might sense his distress in the real world and pull him out of the pensieve. Harry gasped as a second later, Malfoy stopped and inclined his head towards the shelf.
Draco paused before nodding, as if he approved of that assessment. “Your flipflops are in my suitcase, I figured you’d forget them.”
“Tomato soup!” Ron grinned triumphantly as Malfoy swore under his breath before aiming various spells at the offending stain.
Before Draco could argue that a door knocker shouldn’t be so openly hostile to anyone in the first place, regardless of their lineage, the door itself swung open.
Draco glared daggers at Harry, doing little to deter the happy grin spreading across the other man’s handsome face. “I bet you organised that on purpose Potter, a birthday present to yourself – a chance to play the hero again.”
Draco rolled his eyes before slipping his sandals off and pushing his shorts down, simultaneously tearing off his own T-shirt before he could gage Harry’s reaction.
“I will,” Harry promised, his face turning serious.
“Oh,” Draco replied miserably, his face slipping back into an apathetic mask.
“Well, there you go,” Philippe laughed proudly, “I always said you were meant for more.”
“Bog off,” Harry snorted, splashing Draco again.
“How wonderful,” Draco cut across her icily. “I’m afraid Harry and I must get a wiggle on though, you see we’re running late for our portkey. We’re spending the next month vacationing in Thailand, I’m quite looking forward to the break from cooking and just lazing on the beach instead.”
“Yes,” Draco swallowed, “I’m aware. I’ve never met him though.”
“Right,” Harry nodded. It had been a rather uncomfortable moment to see Malfoy sat at his kitchen table diligently working out his budget for the month with a charmed abacus. Whilst Malfoy was able to afford enough ingredients for his cooking and a few cosmetic luxuries it was also clear that he was very aware of the risk of overspending.
“Truce?” Harry wheezed as the two of them swam over to haul themselves out onto the sun baked tiles.
“Are you laughing at me?” Harry grinned.
“What’s my brother got to do with this?” Ron was looking full on perplexed now.
“Do you have any idea why a harmonising fern might turn yellow?” Harry asked, taking a sip of his beer.
After nearly a year of using the Pop Up Pals charms, Draco had found he liked it best when he had established three specific ‘friends’ that he could interact with. Magalie took on more of a mothering, comforting role, gossiping with him about his non-existent love life and the handsome celebrities in wizarding magazines.
“Hey Neville,” Harry cleared his throat as he caught the attention of the other man. They were a few drinks in to the night now and the volume of the table had correspondingly risen.
Harry tried to remember what had been happening on that Monday before remembering it was the day that he and Ron had closed the Marshpiddle Murders case and arrested the lead suspect with enough evidence to make a defence lawyer go running for the hills.
“Ugh, what are you? Hagrid’s slobbering boarhound?” Draco squealed, wriggling to try and get away to no avail, Harry had him pinned. The other man simply laughed before continuing in his quest to taste every inch of Draco’s exposed skin.
“But by the time I’d reached the Steppe, all of the horned Noboskian Gnomes had gone,” Luna sighed, extracting the paper umbrella from her bright pink cocktail and charming it to spin in circles. “I suppose I should have expected an early migration this year, given the swarm of Callipian Cobshackles that came across the Himalaya.”
“Er, what?” Harry’s eyes snapped back up to Draco’s face.
“Um,” Harry bit the inside of his cheek. “Oh just Penny at work, she mentioned it the other day.”
Damn, Hermione had already broached the topic of weather, now what in hell’s bells was Draco meant to use for conversation?
“Bloody likely,” Ron scoffed.
“Yeah,” Harry gulped, “Thailand sounds good.”
“You plan on speaking to him again then?” Luna asked, cocking her head with interest as the crying behind them finally stopped.
~**~**~
“Hold up a moment,” Ron laughed as they caught sight of familiar red robes. “Isn’t that Ed?”
“Oh please,” Malfoy scoffed, returning back to the sofa carrying a wizarding chess set. “Picklemarsh doesn’t listen to a word I say. In fact, if people knew a suggestion had come from me they would probably go out of their way to do the exact opposite!”
“Maybe we should have refused,” Harry questioned.
The rest of the day continued in monotonous fashion with Ron fast forwarding every so often. He and Harry exchanged uncomfortable looks as a woman hissed angrily at Draco whilst he maneuvered his way through the five o clock commuter crowds into the main atrium. Then again when Draco hurried towards a half full elevator, calling out for them to hold the doors only to find them shut firmly in his face.
“Were you looking for me?” Draco blinked up at Harry innocently from where he was kneeling on the ground holding a pair of secateurs with boobs on.
“Yeah,” Potter grinned, “smart stuff.”
“He’s um,” Harry settled his drink back down, “he’s your first cousin.”
The wedding was set for the 11
“Yeah, that’s right,” Harry replied tightly.
“I think,” Draco said slowly, “this might be the greatest moment of my life.”
“Oh wow, this is weird,” Harry murmured as he followed Draco and looked around at the familiar space full of pots, pans and dried herbs.
After a particularly nasty incident with an antique letter opener, Hermione had forbidden her husband to attempt to heal cursed wounds himself and whilst the bull’s horns hadn’t exactly been cursed, he had evidently been keen to show his wife how well he had listened.
“Don’t be absurd,” Draco huffed, “but I might let you buy me a hot chocolate.”
Three hours later, Draco was ready to grab a broom and fly to the Italian liaison office to beat them over the head with the stack of completely unintelligible legalese he had been provided with. He hadn’t even started on the bloody Munich report yet. He groaned as he finally got the end of form A14, only to find out that he shouldn’t have filled it in if he had ticked yes to any question on form C26.
Harry shifted on his seat, the potion smuggling business had been established to be operating between the two cities.
Harry grunted in agreement, fans went crazy for the good looking, fair haired seeker but the truth was that he just couldn’t control his weight in the same way someone trained pure seeker could.
“Anything you want,” Harry laughed, “honestly I’ve suspected for some time now that there might be colony of doxies up there so I just keep the door shut.”
The next day Draco found the usual cinnamon swirl waiting for him on his desk, along with a note,
Occasionally, Harry would catch a glimpse of almost silver hair down the end of a corridor or across the courtyard but he had never seen Malfoy at the canteen or any of the Ministry end of year parties. With the amount of employees the Ministry had it wasn’t that surprising that Ron hadn’t noticed Malfoy.
“The others have all gone to the canteen,” Harry commented. No one had been round to check on Malfoy at all.
Draco jerked his head up in surprise, “Merlin’s balls Harry, please don’t tell me you just ushered in your thirty first year of life sitting on a sofa with me eating mediocre takeout?”
“You didn’t do the blood drop ritual first?” Draco frowned. “Without that, how did you expect to commune with the foundations?”
“What?” Harry wheeled wide-eyed on Draco. “Fuck, Draco, don’t do that – I swear I’ll stop harassing you, you’ll never have to hear from me again if you don’t want.”
It was clearly the start of the working day as hoards of wizards and witches came filing out en masse in sharp black suits and bulging briefcases.
,” Harry growled, nipping at Draco’s neck.
Harry’s mind wandered to some of the idiots he knew in the Ministry’s Curse Breaking Department that had been set up to share personnel with Gringotts. Like Jenkins, Harry had literally watched Jenkins pick up a cursed teaspoon without gloves on the other day. The other man had been vomiting mushrooms for weeks. If Malfoy had Outstanding in all his Newts and his history of being around cursed objects, he was surprised the department hadn’t even bothered with an interview.
Draco walked into the office to find Marlene sat up on her desk chatting with one of the interns. He pointedly ignored her, as he had done ever since the unfortunate run in with her oaf of a boyfriend a few weeks prior.
“The suspect works for the Ministry,” Pewterfoot replied tightly, “some low level paper pusher, but still. He was identified by name and has a criminal record and –“
“Blimey,” Harry sighed, “alright then, give me a minute to put my shoes on.”
There were about eight more questions on seemingly random topics before the quiz moved on to the sports section which Ron, Draco, Dean and Harry eagerly shouted the answers to.
Malfoy cast the sponge to one side and picked up a small silver spatula, using it to lever off scaly patches of what looked like corroded metal.
“I got Ron a blackberry turnover,” Potter continued in a manner that made Draco wholly unsure as to what response it was exactly that the other man was expecting? Did Potter want Draco to ask what he got for himself? Was this some sort of strange test?
Draco blinked in surprise, he had assumed the older Weasley had just been humouring him.
time and it is
Harry trembled as he withdrew his wand from under the bed along with a few cobwebs. He cast the fast forwarding spell just as Malfoy reached for his own wand to murmur a cleaning charm.
~**~**~
Bill Weasley let out a triumphant laugh as Draco continued to endeavour to explain the implementation of strata theory in practical curse breaking in his best French. At one point Harry drifted over, passing Draco a glass of cold lemonade before grinning at them all and slinking away again without notice.
, but he couldn’t say for sure. He hadn’t ever had a proper first date with a man, was the problem. The only boyfriend he’d ever had was Oliver Wood, his football captain on the uni team, and their relationship had started with a heated snog in the men’s showers after a particularly satisfying victory. By the time they had reached the stage of going out to eat together, any possible handshakes were far behind them.
“Mm?” Draco glanced over at him as he corked the bottle of wine.
“Please. Explain, then.” Harry leant back in his seat, raising his eyebrows.
“Seven twenty, if you can swing that,” Harry said. “Tea?”
Draco’s mother stepped out of the house, then reached over and clasped Harry in a soft hug. Lucius held out a stiff hand for him to shake.
“We won, although you might have already heard about that.”
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “I’m sorry.”
The large canvas partially blocked his field of vision, which Harry thought was an adequate excuse for him almost missing the paper bag and coffee cup on his doorstep, “Bean Thinking of You” printed on its label. Inside the bag sat a jumble of pastries and a small note. Harry instantly recognised the creamy paper and perfect handwriting. Hands trembling, he pulled it out and held it up to the lantern casting shadows across the landing.
It was approaching two am when they turned the corner and Harry saw the building that contained his flat. Only one light was still on, casting an orange glow over a third storey balcony. As soon as Zacharias pulled to the kerb, Harry sprang out of the car.
“No, I meant I could come with you to work.”
“Please, I’m almost done. I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting since then, and I understand if you don’t forgive me or want me back, but the last few months have been one of the happiest times of my life. Maybe
“Err, right.” Harry’s attention moved to a row of succulents on a shelf above the counter, right at eye-level. It was a good marketing trick, that. Most shops you went to put sweets and trashy tabloids right at the counter for your impulse purchases. Neville and Luna’s shop offered succulents and painted bookmarks instead. “Is Luna around, then?”
That sentence echoed in his mind over and over as he rode the train back to the city centre.
getting Draco back for this.
“Or you could take me with you,” Draco suggested, finally sitting up, hands rubbing his eyes as he tried to open them.
“If you insist,” Draco said, pushing back from the table. “Are you ready for the food?”
“Neville and Luna are headed out,” Harry reported. “We should probably get going soon, as well.”
“Yeah, definitely better than Manchester.”
Neville nodded toward the back of the shop as he packed peat moss around the roots of one of the flowers. “She should be finishing up a watercolour class soon. You can head over now, if you want. I’m sure she’ll be happy to see you.”
“What time is it?” Draco mumbled into his neck. “It’s still pitch dark.”
It was just Harry’s luck to lose his keys after the worst date of his life. Football practice had got out late, so he hadn’t had a chance to go home and prepare properly. He should have called it off then, but no. He had rinsed off in the locker rooms before tearing out of the pitch and onto the Tube, football gear in tow. There, he had collapsed into a seat and dozed off, only waking up when the train’s jostling alerted him to the fact that he had
“If I’m not mistaken, I believe you owe me a couple answers now,” Harry said, but he was smiling, and his foot knocked against Draco’s under the table again.
“Well, you’ll have to let me know if something does.”
They ambled up the front walk, tension still evident in the set of Draco’s shoulders. Harry couldn’t keep from gaping at the splendour of the gardens and the mansion looming over them. They passed a fountain burbling with iridescent water, rows of daffodils whose petals were suffused with gold, and another stray peacock with its plumage fanned out for the world to see. Malfoy Manor itself dripped with extravagance, all marble pillars and silver filigree and the odd gargoyle peeking out from the gutter.
“I liked them too,” Draco admitted. “You all seem really close. And I think the fact that I voluntarily joined you with no warning whatsoever speaks to my feelings concerning this. Us. You.” He glanced down at their hands, then back at the empty bus behind them.
“You just have all this stuff on hand?”
~**~**~
“The mind boggles,” Draco smiled, his grey eyes meeting Harry’s. Harry fumbled with his spoon, Draco was looking so much healthier than he had been upon his release. There was a glow to his skin and his cheeks seemed less sunken. “So,” Draco cleared his throat and put his hands together, “I believe I was promised an exclusive tell all interview with the great Harry Potter?”
“Of course you bloody are,” Harry rolled his eyes, “it’s not exactly a fun titbit I like to open conversations with, can you imagine?
Ron had been doing his best to suck up to Pewterfoot by even being him horribly expensive magisquid pellets from the petshop on Diagon.
“Not like I make the bloody decisions,” Ron muttered, taking a swig of his drink and ending up with a mint leaf stuck to his mouth. Draco tried not to laugh as took a refined sip from his own glass, confirming that the beverage was in fact rather strong Pimms.
Draco couldn’t think what to say so he opted to remain silent, observing Potter carefully as the man’s expression went from enthusiastic to frustrated to resigned and then back to hopeful again.
Harry turned round to see that Malfoy had cast the spell to summon a
Harry thought this was a little unfair, he and Ron had worked very hard on getting the bottom of the Marshpiddle case and even been hexed by an elderly wizard who thought they were trying to get his prize vegetable award revoked.
“They can’t do that!” Ron burst out. “I thought this was meant to be a joint operation?”
“He – wait, he did?” Ron asked with a look of surprise. “But you just told us the French want to check out the lead from Cockfosters again?”
“Actually Sir,” Draco stared down at the Gringotts contract in front of him, each page penned in perfectly neat Goblin script and stamped with a magical seal that glimmered from gold to silver to bronze and back again. “I’d like to see you in your office.”
“Don’t,” Draco warned but Harry laughed.
“Because,” Luna began as one of her pink umbrellas twirled across to Draco and landed in his Pimms. “I attended a selection of snallygaster dissections, humane of course, along with the Baltimore Institute of Creature Research, and we concluded that snallygaster marrow in the area that Eierkuchen was investigating, contains trace elements of black sand.”
Harry had known that some people still harboured resentments from the war, but he had honestly thought that after a decade it had mostly died down. This was just an average Monday in the Ministry and already Ron and him had witnessed at least three people be openly hostile towards Malfoy.
“I really disagree with the new memory laws,” Hermione sniffed as everyone round the table groaned.
“Promise,” Harry grinned, leaning over to give Draco a kiss and accidentally knocking into someone. “Oh shit – sorry!”
Malfoy, for all his cold pointy-ness, was not exactly unattractive. His face still bore the hallmarks of aristocracy, albeit now without the unpleasant sneer. His hair, although thin and wispy was a rather ethereal colouring that suited his pale skin. Whilst Harry had done his best to always fast forward through the changing of clothes he couldn’t help but appreciate the other man’s slender waist and long legs. Sure, Malfoy wasn’t the type of looker that would get double takes on the street, but there was still something about him that made Harry want to keep looking.
“That Francis Featherhorn, what a dreamboat am I right?” Magalie sighed happily. “I don’t know why they’re thinking of having him take that job offer in Switzerland, I mean if he goes then where’s the eye candy? Johnathon Turnbell? I don’t think so.”
“Oh!” Magalie piped up confidently, “Now I understand. So you’ve decided to go meet Harry Potter and his friends after all.”
“Ten Galleons,” the shriveled witch behind the counter announced after placing all the bags on a cumbersome set of scales.
“Merlin, you’re an almighty arse,” Harry announced to Picklemarsh.
Draco wondered if Potter had noticed how painfully, perpetually dateless Draco was? He was sure Magalie had teased Draco about his lack of romantic experience several times over the month of May. Potter’s memories, on the other hand, would probably be rated R18 whilst the most action Draco ever saw was his own…
Draco frowned, picking at loose thread on the sofa. “Look Harry, I don’t know what you think you saw in those memories but if the reason you invited me over here tonight was for an easy lay, I can promise you I’m not it.”
“Oh fuck,” Harry exclaimed, recognizing exactly what was happening. He wrenched open his robes again with enough force to send his wand spinning through the air before it clattered noisily across the floorboards. “
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “three times over actually. I became Teddy Lupin’s godfather when I was eighteen.”
“You’re something else aren’t you Potter?” Draco murmured.
Harry blinked, trying to imagine Malfoy in a large straw sunhat and gardening gloves in the middle of a flowerbed. The imagined Malfoy also had a wide smile on his face, perhaps Harry was brining him fresh lemonade or a glass of Pimms…hold on, why was Harry imagining Malfoy in
“Merlin,” Draco gasped. The Ariadne curse condemned the victim to turn into a spider if they tried to sew or weave. When combined with the Sorcha curse it would mean that finishing six nettle robes would be nigh on impossible. “That would be a conundrum.”
“Can I take it this means you like my body?” Harry asked, there was a hint of nerves in his voice which prevented Draco from replying with a characteristic tease.
“Was he?” Harry frowned, thinking back to the sneering eleven year old whose handshake he had refused on the first day, his memories jumped forwards to a polished school shoe crunching down on his nose in an empty train carriage. “Yeah, I’m not so sure about that Luna.”
“Fine,” Dean sighed, five galleons each alright?
“About as long as we have,” Harry muttered, bringing his hand up to chew distractedly at a smarting hangnail.
~**~**~
There were two pieces of mail in the letterbox. One was a thin brown package containing a visitors pass for the Comet Broom company. That cheered Draco up immeasurably, Matthew had promised to take him on a guided tour, including a sneak peak at the new Comet 360 which was rumored to have new turning technology, allowing the rider to maneuver in circles at greater speeds.
There were five other people in the lift, Malfoy had inadvertently missed most of the commuter rush by sticking around to spy on Harry. One of the other occupants was a woman with dyed blue hair in a very neat plait, she was wearing a hairclip with a mother of pearl rose on it and a smart suit. The only reason Harry had noticed her in particular was that she was edging closer to Malfoy, peering round at him.
as seeker. Can you imagine if a mal-coordinated jellyfish like Ashford had actually had to face a competent seeker like Potter?”
not funny!”
“No Sir,” Malfoy looked vaguely alarmed. “I’ll make sure the files are on time in the future.”
“What is?” Harry questioned, pausing outside Pewterfoot’s door, he could hear ominous gurgling noises coming from within and assumed their boss must be feeding his squid.
~**~**~
“Hello Ed,” Harry greeted. Winshaw was wearing a thoroughly miserable expression, weighed down by two bags. “How’s your leave going?” Harry asked brightly, leaving the word ‘enforced’ unsaid.
“I like your quill,” the woman announced as both Malfoy and Harry blinked at her in surprise. Malfoy recovered quicker, however, rearranging his features back into an unreadable mask and giving a tight nod of thanks.
“Right then,” the witch shrugged, gesturing with a gnarled old hand that was weighed down by rings. “Second floor on the right and straight on ‘til Mourning.”
“No, I don’t think it’s that,” Draco shook his head thoughtfully. His father had always tried to instil in Draco that Malfoys were meant for greatness – and where had that gotten them? “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my job at the moment, if someone enjoyed it that is, but I don’t.”
“We’ll just fast forward through anything that’s clearly not relevant,” Harry shrugged.
“So what you’re saying is Harry Potter somehow accessed your memories? I’m confused, how can someone –“
“Git,” Harry huffed, but he was smiling as he led Draco into a sitting room that was indeed painted a ghastly shade of brown. The house was huge and Draco imagined it could be magnificent, there was so much old familial magic running through the veins of the walls. The Blacks must have gone to great lengths to top up the well that was undoubtedly sealed into the bedrock of the foundations.
“Harry James Potter,” Hermione declared as Harry took a spare seat in the circle of chairs that his close friends were occupying for the evening. Most of the party guests had gone home and there were twinkling swarms of fireflies hovering around the garden. “We
“You’re an angel Mione,” Memory Harry grinned, pulling his shirt back down and giving her a quick peck on the cheek.
Harry beamed after the blue haired woman as she strode off towards a floo grate with a shorter line.
“Quite mad,” Draco replied, peering over at Harry’s pot. “What did you get?”
Draco seemed to be thinking for a few moments. “What’s your house like? You’ve spent nearly a month inside my flat but I don’t even know where you live.”
Harry glanced back up to see Terry Boot and his partner coming into the atrium and walking over to where Hermione had now lifted Memory Harry’s shirt up to reveal his wound.
“Draco!” Marlene exclaimed in shock.
“Oh God,” Draco gasped, tipping forwards and steadying himself with a hand on the pillow. His mouth slipped from Harry’s in a thin trail of saliva before the other man ducked down and sucked a pert, pink nipple into his mouth. Draco yelped, smacking his free hand against his mouth before Harry tore it away again.
Hell, if Draco’s day had involved wrestling a baby dragon from the chimney of an exotic creatures smuggling ring’s hideout, you
something to Draco.
Odette had gone to Beauxbatons, whilst her friends Theresa and Nick had attended Koldovstoretz.
“Ah fuck,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, “you’re right, I’m sorry, that was totally inappropriate of me. I bloody suck at flirting.”
Harry snorted, “Probably, you always were a bit of a ponce.”
“Quidditch and the weather, right,” Draco nodded decisively, although he somewhat remembered Weasley supporting the Canons at school and after Sunday had seen the absolute demolishing of them by the Falcons, anything Draco said now could be taken as insult. “The weather it is,” Draco muttered before turning round to Magalie and grimacing. “I’m going now so I have to end your charm, I’m sorry I know there’s still fifty minutes left.”
“I, um,” Draco took a step back but bashed his hip painfully into the window ledge, he wobbled before reaching out to steady himself. Unfortunately the nearest solid object was Harry, so this resulted in Draco’s palm being flat against a strong pectoral, his fingers threaded through the dark hair.
Draco felt horribly nauseous, probably from apparating whilst under the influence and managed to knock over a quill pot whilst reaching over to pick up an orange marble which he promptly twisted open.
Malfoy’s kitchen was also full to the brim of different pots, pans and stirring instruments, including an uncharacteristically adorable egg timer that Harry gathered Narcissa had sent over from Paris. It was in the shape of a chicken and when the time was up it would start singing the song ‘Alouette, Gentille Alouette’ and flapping its wings until you tapped it on the beak.
“Blimey,” Ron sighed, rubbing his hand down his face. “I can definitely think of a few places I’d rather be at nine am on a Wednesday morning than inside the ferret’s head.”
“Pssh,” Ron snorted, “easy street – Jamaica.”
“My garden,” Harry answered as Ron’s frown only grew more puzzled.
Draco gasped as Harry pushed his hand full inside Draco’s pajama bottoms, massaging the globes of Draco’s arse whilst his index finger ran slowly up the gap between them, not yet going any further.
“Getting off track Ron!” Harry snapped. “My point is I just wanted Draco to feel like we were on equal footing a bit more. Like I thought if he saw me accidentally dropping my glasses in the loo or spending half an hour trying to make my beard even it might help.”
“And according to Hermione, you should probably still give him more,” Ron replied.
“Regardless, it was decided that the two of you would have a better chance of recognizing any out of place behaviour. Also, having been at school together, you will be familiar with the suspect’s magical signature, so it will be easier to tell if there have been any memory alterations,” Pewterfoot nodded, making it clear the matter had already been decided.
“You know what I miss?” Malfoy began as Lisette formed in the kitchen, leaning against a counter and listening attentively. “Holidays,” Malfoy concluded. “Marlene was going on about the villa her and her auror boyfriend have booked in Tuscany this summer.”
“Sir, I am in charge of the French and Italia-“ Malfoy began again.
“Draco,” Harry’s voice sounded wrecked as he pulled back to gaze up at Draco with dark eyes, pupils blown so wide that black nearly eclipsed the green. “I want to touch you, may I?”
It was a scene, funnily enough, from a book that Harry actually recognized. Luna had bought him the Starfall science fiction trilogy for Christmas last year and it had been rather entertaining reading about wizards in space. Harry was a little surprised that Malfoy enjoyed something like that though.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy frowned at the other man, looking round as if to check that Winshaw really was addressing him.
“I,” Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, “I mean maybe, sure, we’ll probably run into each other at the Ministry some time.”
Draco stared at Harry thoughtfully for a moment before reaching over to pick up the marble, twisting the top off and murmuring the incantation.
Draco twisted the lid off the marble one handed whilst trying to get into his other shoe, hopping around his bedroom like a gazelle who had stepped on a bee.
Harry jerked his head up to see a rather irate looking Ed Winshaw stood in front of Malfoy, his arm was linked around Malfoy’s coworker Marlene.
“Neil Galespawn,” Ron informed Yasmin before pointing at Draco and a happily giggling Harry. “You’re both arseholes.”
Malfoy was perched with a rigid posture on a chair that Harry was convinced Picklemarsh had deliberately ordered in a child size so as to make everyone who sat there feel inferior. The blond man had so far not said a single word, although Harry could see that his knuckles were white where they were gripping his bony knees.
“With a herd of Gryffindors,” Draco continued, wondering at what point Potter would realise he needed to check himself into Mungo’s for a suspected brain transplant.
.” Harry grasped at the sugar pot only to find his fingers swiping straight through it.
“Y-you,” Harry panted, pushing Draco gently away and fumbling with his buttons. “Want to do the same to you
“I had some things I needed to stay and sort out,” Draco replied, “I quit my job today.”
For once in his professional life, Draco was actually glad of working in the basement as at least the temperature was gratifyingly cooler there, albeit a little tepid.
Ron shuddered, that had apparently happened to two other aurors who were no longer speaking to each other.
“I had quite a lot of practical experience with cursed objects growing up,” Malfoy continued. Harry snorted grimly as he recalled the locket that had nearly killed Ron.
“Draco!” Harry had obviously followed him. Draco caught the other man’s pleading expression as he raised his wand and apparated away.
They followed Malfoy down five flights of stairs to a level that Harry hadn’t even realised existed, and judging from Ron’s expression, neither had he.
Draco sat cross legged on his sofa in the quiet stillness of his flat. The Head auror Pewterfoot had magnanimously informed Draco that he would be given monetary compensation for his wrongful detainment that equated to almost half of what he would have earned that month at work. Despite this, Draco had not yet ordered a new delivery of Pop Up Pals after his previous one had been cancelled.
“I want a garden,” Malfoy announced whilst hunched over his aging cauldron. His sleeves were rolled up and he had worked up a flush on his face from scrubbing at a particular stubborn stain on the inside lip.
The two of them walked past the dodgy merman fountain when the door to Pewterfoot’s office slammed open and a furious looking Winshaw came storming out. He pulled a face upon noticing Harry and stalked past with a thump of their shoulders.
“Right!” Draco snapped, standing up purposefully, “That’s it.”
“Bloody hell – are you okay?” Harry asked frantically.
Draco realised that Harry was cutting them both thick wedges of cake as he sat down on one of the sturdy oak chairs at the kitchen table. “Aren’t we going to be late for your own party?” Draco enquired.
“True,” Pewterfoot replied thoughtfully, “but he was administered a very high dose.”
Apart from that, Draco didn’t mind his job too much. Sure, the hours were long and the recognition was low but the paycheck was enough for Draco to live a modest but pleasant enough life in his small London apartment. He was also able to splash out occasionally on feel good treats such as enchanted bath bombs and sealed, ready to drink glasses of Goblin wine.
“Teddy and Victoire overheard your confession,” Ron explained as Neville and Seamus continued to giggle like schoolboys rather than the mature adults they were all meant to be. “They thought it was just too good not to come and give us all a dramatic re-enactment of exactly what you said.”
“I dunno, doesn’t always have to be pastries,” Potter grinned, “I could stretch for a banana sometimes, maybe a salad pot from Pret.”
“Oh god,” Harry groaned as he glanced back up to see memory Malfoy happily chatting away with his apparently imaginary friend.
“BON ANNIVERSAIRE DRACO!” Magalie’s voice sung loudly through the kitchen as she appeared beside them.
Shortly after, Luna and Neville announced that it was time for them to go, and Harry realised with a start how late it had got. Somewhere along the way, Draco and Ron had disappeared, leaving only one of Rose’s scribbles and a fountain pen behind—Luna’s thin green paintbrush was nowhere in sight, and more importantly, neither was Draco.
Harry clapped a hand over his mouth. “Oh my—if you’ll excuse—I’m so sorry,” he stammered before rushing away. If anything would have convinced Harry the date wasn’t worth it, it was this, but
“Marvin, that purple grass is simply delightful!” Luna’s voice rang over the chatter in the crowded studio in the back. “One should never limit themselves to what they see with their eyes.” Marvin, who couldn't have been more than ten years old, beamed back at his teacher. A couple minutes later, Luna clapped her hands together, dismissed her class, then skipped over to where Harry was leaning against a shelf. His eyes caught on the red ladybugs dancing across her apron, and then on the matching red paintbrush tucked behind her ear. He couldn’t help but remember the night before, an image of Draco and his pen flashing before his mind’s eye before he turned back to the matter at hand.
Of course, despite this progress, England had fallen behind its practice regimen in the intervening week, and that meant their new coach held them over more often than not. Harry welcomed the distraction, and he liked Coach Shacklebolt; he was stern but kind, and he was still young enough to demonstrate new manoeuvres and strategies he wanted them to implement, his muscles rippling under dark brown skin.
“It’s going to be all right,” Harry repeated as they drove to Wiltshire. “You’re going to be all right.”
An hour and a half later, Harry was finally inside his flat, with a new lock installed on the door and four copies of the key sitting on his coffee table. He’d had a couple spares of the old key usefully piled in his desk drawer inside the flat already, but the thought of Zacharias Smith being able to let himself into Harry’s home made his stomach feel as topsy-turvy sweaty clammy as it had done when he had gone to a gay club for the first time, except that had been pleasant, and this was not.
“I just don’t know which fork to use,” Harry admitted, smiling sheepishly. He expected Draco to reply with some biting retort, but he just pointed to the outermost one and explained that you moved your way inward as the meal progressed. Their feet bumped one another under the table.
“Smith sounds like a maniac,” Draco observed as Harry finished, squeezing the last of his lemon wedge’s juice into his cup of seltzer and licking his thumb. “That is quite a story. I don’t know that I’d believe it if you hadn’t shown up at my doorstep looking like…” He glanced Harry up and down meaningfully.
“We?” Harry could now hear a smile creeping into her voice, and he sagged with relief.
“Is that a challenge, Potter?” Draco raised one eyebrow, and Ginny wolf-whistled.
“What do you mean, what’s going on?” the goalie asked, shoving a copy of the
“Of course!” Harry cut her off before her voice could rise any higher. She already sounded as if she were seconds away from bursting into tears, and he’d never known how to respond when someone cried. He tugged Draco’s hand, pulling him to a stop, and they pressed themselves against the side of the railing over the Thames, avoiding a crowd of tourists ambling past. “We got a late start, but we’ll be there in about twenty minutes. Feel free to start without us. We’ll catch up.”
“And it was horrible! No offence, Luna, but I think you may be losing your touch.”
Harry couldn’t remember a time that sex had ever sounded so unappealing.
“Well, you haven’t answered my question either, and I asked it first.” Draco took another sip of wine, one sardonic eyebrow daring Harry to argue back.
“Oh, Harry. I’m so sorry,” Draco breathed. His eyes were as big and grey as a stormcloud right before it released rain. He reached over to where Harry’s fingers were clenching the railing, and gave his hand a brief squeeze.
“Of course I want that,” Harry murmured, sitting down next to Draco on the bed. He found his hand amidst the heaped blankets and squeezed it before bending down to tie his shoelaces. “Just not at the cost of your job. Anyway, I can make us breakfast if you’re ready by seven.”
“Oh,” Harry said again, feeling suddenly shy. “I can talk about it, if you want. I’m just not used to doing that outside of the team. But in return, I want to hear more about the one and only Draco Malfoy.”
, had he?
He hurried back home, dug through his junk drawer for a biro, produced a sheet of paper from his desk, and scrawled:
He couldn’t believe this. This many horrible things couldn’t possibly happen to him in one night. It had to defy some law of the universe. He’d ask Hermione which one; she’d be sure to know. And while he was at it, he needed to tell Luna how badly she had blundered in this setup.
until now. It’s added a whole new dimension to my art. Neville just ordered a shipment, so we’ll be stocking it soon.”
The next morning, between Harry’s usual morning run and gym workout, he took a detour to Bean Thinking of You. He signed an extra coffee cup for the starstruck barista, then made his way back home, juggling a bag of pastries and two cups of coffee.
A slight frown hovered on her lips, her eyes large and glassy as a dragonfly’s. Luna was famously good at setting people up, particularly people who never would have found each other otherwise. After Harry and Oliver Wood had broken up, she’d thought to introduce Oliver to Charlie Weasley, and that was why Harry would now see his ex every Christmas until the end of time. She’d also set up Ginny with her last three significant others, had predicted Ron and Hermione getting together years before Harry had noticed they fancied one another, and most impressively, was responsible for the marriage of two professors from their uni.
“But… what… your boyfriend?” Ron’s eyes were now as round as two blue moons, taking up half his face.
. His keys were gone.
Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry could see the corners of his smile as he stared down at his plate. “What about you? How was your game?”
“Err, no.” Harry was suddenly profoundly aware of how long it had been since he’d stopped by the shop, how long since he had seen Luna in person. “I actually just wanted to catch up. I went on that date with Zacharias last night.”
required planning. Neville and Luna couldn’t just water Harry’s plants every morning when he was away for a football tournament or when he simply forgot, because they were always busy with their combined nursery/art studio. The only time Harry could catch up with them now was when he went under the pretence of buying a plant or a new painting. Maybe he’d stop by this afternoon, buy a succulent, and tell Luna about her horrible setup. But before he could do that, there was one more order of business to take care of: coffee.
Draco examined the label and nodded. “An acceptable substitute. Would you like to come in?” He stood aside, and Harry entered the flat, taking it in properly this time. Draco had draped a blanket across the stain Harry had left on the sofa, and next to the kitchen, he had set up a table for two, complete with cloth serviettes folded into cranes. The air carried the warm smell of bread and roasted meat across the room, and Harry’s stomach grumbled.
he typed back, then added,
“No. Sorry. You’re right,” he said, chagrined.
“I think the facts speak for themselves,” Harry retorted.
“Don’t lie to me,” Draco said as they began the drive back home. “What did you think? I know she can be a little… abrasive.”
“Harry.”
It was remarkable how seamlessly dating Draco fit into Harry’s life. After work, he’d pop over to his boyfriend’s flat, or Draco would come over to his. On Friday nights, instead of feeling sorry for himself over takeaway curry, he and Draco sought out new restaurants, and on Sundays, they worked their way down the list of museums Draco had yet to visit in London.
“I don’t know,” he said, closing his eyes for a brief moment of respite. “I’m still trying to process that Draco used me like this. I haven’t even started to make sense of Coach Scrimgeour dealing steroids. What the hell is up with that? And how is the team going to pull through this season without a bloody coach? God, this is all my fault. I single-handedly ruined England’s—”
“Sorry. I’ll see you after work. It won’t be that long.” Harry bumped around his closet in the dark, searching for his trainers.
“But you like me anyway.”
“It’s Hermione,” Harry said, an apology evident in his tone. “Sorry, I’m sure this will be quick.” He accepted the call. “Hey, ‘Mione?”
, or if this really was only occurring to him now. He had just admitted to living in a manor, after all. He probably never had even worried about money.
“Yeah.” Harry’s voice was quiet.
Draco took a deep breath, his eyes trained on his lap, and Harry turned to face him, his heart in his throat. “My best friend is flying in from Paris next week, and if you’d like to meet her, I know she’d be happy to meet you,” he finally said.
“How are you doing?” she asked in her most soothing voice, which was a relatively recent acquisition. Harry supposed he could thank Rose for that.
Draco brightened at this. “I learnt from my mother. She’s half French, and so my grandmere, who was always quite indignant about the state of food in this country, made sure to teach her how to cook properly, and Mother passed it down. It’s a family tradition, just like the ridiculous constellation names.”
Nobody answered. He knocked again, shifting his weight from foot to foot. Still no one came. Harry sighed.
The door swung open, revealing the only two people in the world who were both blonde and sharp enough to create someone like Draco Malfoy. They both had unsmiling mouths, but there was a familiar glint in Narcissa’s eyes.
Draco coughed, a watercolour blush rising onto his cheeks, which Pansy ignored as she turned back to Harry.
“Hmm, I suppose that makes him less deplorable than I’d presumed. Perhaps I owe him an apology,” Draco said, pocketing the key. “Are you ready to go?”
“Coming!” Ron called. “Harry, how’s it—“ he stopped short as he came into view, eyeing Harry’s sodden frame and the utter dejection he was doing a shite job of hiding. “What happened?”
“Good night. And—erm—thank you very much.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
They were on their way back from the Tate Modern, their hands bumping each other as they walked, and Draco was explaining the political symbolism of a sculpture they’d admired, his voice growing more and more animated as he spoke. Harry was wondering just how bad it would be if he picked up Draco’s hand here in public when his iPhone started ringing, blaring out “A Cauldron of Hot, Strong Love” for all the world to hear. He had
“Is that Celestina—“
“Perfect! A kiss for good luck?”
He decided to set out to the 24-hour Tesco a few blocks away. Maybe the night-shift employee would take pity on him and let him use their mobile. He was glancing over his shoulder at his empty flat, thinking about his warm and dry bed and how a three-centimetre piece of metal was all that stood between him and home, when he saw that light in the window again, beaming from the flat opposite his. Did that mean its resident was still awake? Maybe they could help, and Harry wouldn’t have to slog through three blocks in a torrential rainstorm.
It was truly mortifying how those five sentences wreaked havoc on his heart rate whenever he read over them again. And they kept doing so, until he stuffed the note back into his pocket and knocked on Draco’s door Thursday night, at seven on the dot.
There was a brief pause, just long enough for Harry to wonder what he was doing, and then the door opened. A man around Harry’s age stood on the other side, a man with light blond hair, sharp features, and a tall, thin frame. His collarbone peeked out from his worn t-shirt, which had slipped off one shoulder, and he had a pen tucked behind his ear.
The party dwindled as the sky faded from blue to gold to black, as boisterous laughter melted into giggles, then quiet conversation. Ginny left to chorused goodbyes, and Hermione retreated upstairs to put Rose to bed. That left Harry and Draco alone with Ron, Luna, and Neville, and he found his eyes frequently wandering to his boyfriend, to make sure he was all right. He needn’t have bothered—each time he checked, Draco was immersed in conversation with one of his friends, and Harry felt a sudden yearning desire to preserve this moment, to fold it away like a stolen snapshot in his wallet to look at over and over again. A laugh escaped Draco, and when Harry glanced over at him, his eyes were half-closed and his mouth was open with delight, his hair tousled from the football match and his skin warm in the candlelight. Harry’s heart swooped and he stared—he couldn’t stop staring—as it dawned on him that he was falling in love with Draco Malfoy.
, but she had to come to Britain for business often enough, and when she did, they tried to meet up, at least once. Picking her up at the airport was a good way to sneak in an extra hour together, despite her busy schedule.
Harry found other ways to distract himself, too. He checked a couple more museums off the list he’d made with Draco, which weren’t nearly so interesting without a certain someone’s snide commentary, but he made do. He gave Neville uninformed suggestions on new plants to stock and he listened to Luna lay out plans to set up Ginny with Cho Chang, a rugby player who had recently signed up for Luna’s introductory gouache class.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice was quiet, and Draco finally looked at him, eyes grey and glistening, before he trained his gaze back on the floor.
“Are you sure? It’s already rather late.”
“No, I think this is it,” Draco said, carrying two plates of salad to the table, a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette tucked under his arm. “Thanks for getting the wine.” He eyed the table, then nodded, satisfied, and motioned for Harry to sit.
“Does that bother you?”
“Nice to meet you too,” Harry finally said, sliding into the seat across from Zacharias, taking a moment to mourn his usual comfortable corner booth. “Sorry I’m late. Practice went over, and I had a hell of a time getting here.”
“That is my name, yes,” Draco tried to quip, but his voice hitched on the words. Harry took a half-step forward, then paused. They were staring at one another and they were breathing the same air, and Harry waited for Draco to break the moment again, but he didn’t move. Neither of them did. The tension was growing thicker with every shared inhalation until Harry thought he might burst with it. Carefully, he untangled one of his hands from Draco’s and moved it to the other man’s jaw, sliding his thumb across his cheekbone. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut at the touch.
Harry raised his eyebrows. That wasn’t at all the impression he had got from Draco’s previous descriptions of his job, and he still looked as if he were inches from falling back asleep, his pale limbs long and loose and almost limp as he stared back at Harry. But Draco’s smile was soft and open and eager, and the thought of showing him around the training grounds sent a thrill through Harry’s stomach.
The locker room was abuzz when Harry barrelled in, which would have been a surprise even if their training hadn’t already started. His teammates stood in a circle, all in various states of undress. The expressions Harry could see were frantic, wide eyes and open mouths on everyone.
Harry squeezed his hand. “I’d love that.”
“Ach. Don’t get soppy on me, Potter.”
The man in front of him ignored Harry’s proffered hand. Instead, he leant against the doorframe and coolly said, “Ah, yes, I have become well-acquainted with your abhorrent music taste. I’d ask what possessed a man such as yourself to purchase any album by Celestina Warbeck, but I think I’d rather not know. However, I will ask, if you don’t mind, why you decided to introduce yourself at half two?”
“It’s just got some sweaty jerseys and cleats and such. Nothing too exciting,” he said, but that didn’t stop the other man from pawing through it before slinging it inside the car, zip still half-open.
Harry’s mobile alarm went off at seven, blaring “Walking on Sunshine,” and he hurriedly slapped it off. Draco had already been merciless about the Celestina Warbeck playing in his flat (never mind that it was Ginny’s music. She always blasted it when they cooked together), and he didn’t need to provide any more fodder for his neighbour’s teasing. He stumbled into the washroom and splashed his face. A couple drops of water landed on the pristine mirror over the sink, and he hurriedly tried to smudge them off with his shirtsleeve.
“Draco,” Harry said again, savouring the syllables on his tongue as he moved toward him. He pulled the wine bottle out of Draco’s slack hands and intertwined them with his own. “Draco,” he whispered, one last time.
Mobile in hand and duffel over his shoulder, Harry slipped out of the flat, already dialling a locksmith’s number.
Harry stopped by his flat and grabbed the box he’d left on the sofa, then knocked on the door across from his. He wasn’t expecting Draco to open it this early on a Sunday morning, but it still seemed more courteous to him than dropping the food off without warning. He’d just set today’s bundle on the doormat and was standing back up again when the door opened to reveal a smirking Draco.
“So, your game?” Draco prompted, blowing on a spoonful of his stew.
“Please.” They chewed silently, and after they finished, Draco washed the dishes whilst Harry frantically flung his football gear back into his bag—he didn’t know how it always got scattered around his flat over the course of the weekend, but it inevitably did, necessitating this weekly ritual.
“Was that… an albino peacock?” he asked, unable to fight the incredulity in his words.
The next morning, Harry came home from his run to find another flat white and cardamom bun on his doorstep, both still warm. There wasn’t a note attached, but he knew where they had come from. His stomach did something funny as he imagined a sleepy Draco stumbling his way to Bean Thinking of You “too bloody early,” also known as six in the morning, just for him. Harry’s eyes darted around him as he picked up the parcel, as if he’d find Draco lurking in a cobwebbed corner of the shadowed stairwell. But there wasn’t a sign of him anywhere.
“Ron and Hermione’s house is very nice isn’t it?” Penny continued. “I’ve never been here before, it was great of Ron to invite the whole department.”
Other than his preconceptions of Malfoy being quashed, and the nastiness that the man in question regularly had to put up with from other people, there hadn’t really been anything
“I believe so,” Draco replied, his throat dry as his gaze flickered to the unreadable expression of Andromeda behind him.
developing that pensieve brand of Stockhom Syndrome that Hermione had mentioned.
to pass through. If Harry had suggested meeting somewhere else it might give the other man even less incentive to show up.
“Dressed as a
Right now though, Draco was running on humidity sodden frustration and he powered walked up and down the rows with grim determination, looking for Odette. The other woman perhaps not might be thrilled that the stranger she had run into weeks ago in a lift was now going to accost her lunch regarding Italian bureaucracy but Draco was mindful of the sheer amount of work he had to get through today. He just couldn’t afford give Picklemarsh any excuse to fire him and Draco was sure the fetid old fart was searching for one like niffler on a gold hunt.
“Hibiscus,” Neville answered, looking pleased.
“Cerisier and Laurent are clutching at straws,” Ron groaned during the meeting in Pewterfoot’s office. Harry nodded in agreement, he could think of a few choice French insults he had learned from Magalie that he wouldn’t mind employing right about now.
As soon as he arrived home, the first thing Harry did was check his mailbox and there, sure enough, was an ornate looking card in the shape of a broom. Where the maker’s logo would normally be engraved were the words, ‘
“Are you sure you’re ready for that?” Harry frowned.
“Probably got a lot to hide,” Ron huffed, folding his arms over his chest and sitting back in the chair.
Harry eyed Malfoy’s white shirt with silver cufflinks in the shape of leaves. He was sporting a periwinkle blue waistcoat and dark grey trousers that had evidently been ironed that very day, charms never got them that smooth. Harry couldn’t imagine how early one would have to get up to do iron your clothes for the day, he barely had time for a piece of toast after hitting the snooze button four times.
“Right!” Harry agreed. “I thought it must be something like that. I tried to repaint the living room last spring and by the next morning it had all peeled off in great swathes.”
“Harry you haven’t
“That was distinctly unpleasant,” Harry agreed, pulling a face at the memory, although it had resulted in a rather nifty conviction for illegal artifact theft.
“Regardless,” Pewterfoot sighed, holding up a hand to silence the two of them. “Laurent and Cerisier think the evidence stacks up enough to warrant a Pensieve Probe.”
“Does it?” Ron asked incredulously, leaning into their conversation. “Would have thought house elves would have taken care of all that.”
Draco sighed, feeling more on familiar ground now. Leave it to Potter to never let an injustice go by without remedy.
Obviously, Harry had helped Ron and Hermione move in and had visited a couple times since then, but this was Draco’s first time in their new house, and Harry watched him take everything in. Like in Harry’s flat, you could see evidence of all of their friends, but Ron and Hermione had made the cosy space their own. A wooden shelf by the fireplace was crammed with dozens of Hermione’s favourite books, one of Ron’s chess sets was laid out on the coffee table, and Rose’s muddy wellies were parked by the back door. It stood ajar, and Ron waved them through as he ducked back toward the kitchen.
His thumbs tapped against the bottle of Bordeaux he held as he waited, wondering if there was any etiquette he was forgetting. He shoved the note further down in his pocket, just in case.
“Is there anything else?” Harry felt awkward and fidgety without a task to occupy him, especially when Draco was flying around the kitchen in a way that would make a professional chef jealous.
“Things are heating up over here!” she called out. “The teams, then: I’ll take Neville and Luna, and you take Draco and Ron?” Everyone nodded their assent and went to stand with their teams, and then the game began, ending only when Ron accidentally kicked the ball to the roof. Harry was grinning and mud-splattered; Draco’s cheeks had flushed faintly and a slight sheen of sweat had darkened the hair at the base of his neck, and Harry couldn’t resist the urge to give him a quick kiss, which Draco returned, even as his blush deepened.
Draco emerged then, carrying an iPhone charger, an overfilled file folder, and another pen. He tossed the charger over to Harry, then settled into the chair opposite his sofa, opening the folder and uncapping the pen with his teeth.
Even though he’d never seen her before, Harry had no trouble recognising Pansy Parkinson when she stepped through customs and strode through the terminal. Her hair fell in a sharp black line to her jaw, her heeled black boots clicked across the floor, and her crimson lipstick perfectly matched her glossy nails. She looked every bit the editor of a Parisian fashion magazine. Draco had explained in the car on the way to the airport that they had met at journalism school in Paris and had bonded over being from England, then later, over being queer. He’d been sad to leave her behind when he got his offer with the
Draco scoffed. “Of course not. I have my share of issues, but hypocrisy is not one of them. I just hadn’t assumed you also dated men. Moving on: ‘He sort of kidnapped you?’ I do hope you plan to elaborate. Tell me the long version.”
Draco sighed, closing his eyes again. Harry pushed a water glass across the coffee table, but Draco didn’t move to take it. “Then my father called,” he continued, voice cracking. “I know this isn’t very admirable, but I’ve never wanted anything more than to please him. I’ve essentially let him run my whole life. He picked my couch, he picked my career, and he’s tried to pick my wife. I put my foot down on that one but never explained why. So he still doesn’t know that I… prefer men. My parents would be terribly disappointed, and I knew you wanted to meet them, but I’ve never brought anyone home, and I—I panicked. When he hung up, I sent in the article. For what it’s worth, I regretted it almost immediately, but I couldn’t take it back.”
When Harry’s alarm went off the next morning, Draco groaned and pulled him in closer. Harry grappled for his mobile on the bedside table, to turn off its incessant blaring. This was made decidedly more difficult by the arms wrapped around his torso, pulling him back into a sea of blankets and his boyfriend’s warm embrace.
“I’ll do my best,” Harry vowed, raising a hand to his heart.
When Harry got home that afternoon, a box of Luna’s tea and one of Neville’s succulents in tow, the sun’s rays were slanting across the sky, as sudden as the morning’s showers of rain. The package he’d left on Draco’s doorstep was gone, he was gratified to see. Harry hummed “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me” as he unlocked the door to his flat, relishing the smooth entry of the key into the lock and the soft click it made as he turned it. He would never take it for granted again, he vowed.
“So, my uni family liked you. And I really like you,” Harry finally said, after several minutes of silence on the bus ride home. They were alone on the top layer of their double-decker bus, heading toward the city centre. Taking advantage of the solitude, their fingers were intertwined, hands resting on Harry’s thigh.
vehicle to visit Millie at half one, when
He didn’t remember that he’d planned to grab Draco some coffee and a danish before work until he transferred Tube lines twenty minutes later. Draco still hadn’t texted him back, and whilst Harry didn’t know exactly what had happened the day before, he’d figured a small pick-me-up couldn’t hurt. But it was far too late, now. As it stood, he would already arrive at practice ten minutes after it began, minimum, and he knew Draco would have already gone to work by the time he made it back to their flats. That was, if he’d even left the office in the first place.
The rest of the afternoon passed in a languorous haze. Shortly after one, Hermione dropped by, carting in a stack of paperwork and a loaf of Irish brown bread. She and Ron exchanged a meaningful look over Harry's head when she entered the house, immediately informing him that he was the purpose of her midday visit. Sure enough, she sat close to him on the sofa, squeezing his shoulder and offering up a sad smile.
After a few more minutes of excruciating silence, Draco looked back over at him. Harry was startled by the cool greyness of his gaze—he wasn’t sure he’d ever seen eyes of such a colour, like they reflected back the early morning mist that settled over the city.
In the meantime, the team had begun to spend more time together outside of their usual training bloc, perhaps because their abbreviated practices left them with more free time, or perhaps because their world had been upended the previous week and they all understood what the others were going through better than anyone else could.
Strangely enough, that conversation cleared the air between Harry and most of his teammates, even though McLaggen still scowled whenever they made eye contact. But a few of the others smiled at Harry when he lapped them in their morning drills, and Cedric even invited him out to dinner with him and his boyfriend—he had noticed Harry’s pronoun slip and wanted to make sure he knew he wasn’t alone.
Ron sighed and shook his head to himself. “Sorry. I’m not quite sure.” He stood and faced the other three, all huddled on the couch. Rose was fiddling with the tassels of a throw pillow, seemingly oblivious to the conversation going on above her head. “We still have some pumpkin pepper soup from when Mum visited this past week, if you’d like me to heat it up.” He shuffled to the kitchen before Harry had a chance to say “yes, thank you,” even though he couldn’t muster up any hunger; it felt like a rock had taken up residence where his stomach was supposed to be. But pumpkin pepper soup was his favourite, and he understood that Ron was helping the best he knew how.
“Really, you can sleep for as long as you need to,” Draco said. “Let me just grab you a blanket and see if I have an extra toothbrush.”
He was met with the same surprise the following four mornings, until he couldn’t take it anymore. A few pastries hardly made up for what Draco had done, and Harry still wasn’t sure if he forgave him or not, but he wanted to hear what Draco had to say.
“Of course I’m sure. What else would I be doing right now, anyway?” Both men glanced down at the folder on the table between them, then back up at each other. Harry waited for Draco to take back the request, given their shared acknowledgement of his flimsy reasoning, but he said nothing. Instead, Draco shifted uncomfortably, then gave a shy smile, and even though Harry barely knew his neighbour, he somehow knew this moment was significant. Even when his flat had been invaded in the middle of the night and he was clearly not dressed for company and he had a fucking pen behind his ear, Draco had been fully in control. And now that they’d settled in, the clock inching toward three am, he was letting himself be vulnerable.
“The—”
He growled in frustration, ripped off the bottom of the note and scrawled,
Besides the facial expression and the omnipresent pen behind his ear, he couldn’t have looked more different from the man Harry had met two nights prior. This Draco’s hair was slicked back, and he wore a sage green button-up, well-fitting trousers, and shiny leather oxfords. Harry was having a hard time remembering how to swallow.
“You’ve been coming to my games?” Harry asked, unable to contain his grin. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Harry snorted. “That goes without saying.”
“I should have done,” Harry muttered. “I’m too trusting. Did I tell you I knew he was a journalist? Because he told me. He told me the night we met, and I still went and—”
“It was no problem. Thanks so much for all of this. It looks—and smells— amazing.”
One of his favourite post-game rituals was to hole up in his hotel room and watch the match, taking notes on what plays had worked and where he could improve. But his attention kept wandering to the note he had found on his door when he’d set off for St Pancras early Monday morning.
Harry snorted. “You could say that.” He paused, considering his words. “But it was all right. I can tell that you two really love one another.”
“Oh? How so?”
“Well, I finally got to tell my neighbour off about his horrible music, and I learnt about a great coffee shop.” He drained his cup, as if to emphasise the statement, then turned to Harry with a wicked grin. “Am I forgetting anything?”
“But I’ll miss you,” Draco said, yawning. Harry shook his head and smiled at the rumpled form on his bed. He could barely see Draco’s outline in the dim light, but he knew that his hair was mussed and probably sticking up on one side, and that his bleary grey eyes wouldn’t fully open for another couple hours.
“Come in!” Harry called out, and Draco poked his head into the flat before stepping in. He was freshly showered, skin pink and hair flat against his scalp. Somehow, a pen had already made its way behind his ear, even though it was barely seven in the morning.
“Are… aren’t you my date?” Harry asked, feeling more and more foolish by the second.
“I have to work out before I go to practice. You know that.”
Harry slung the bag over his shoulder and left without saying good-bye. He heard a faint “See you, Harry!” behind him as he began to ascend the never-ending stairs to his third-floor flat.
It sounded silly, especially when one considered that he practically ran for a living, but maybe that was the problem. Whilst his friends had been finding each other, he’d been chasing after a bloody football.
Harry was thoroughly exhausted by the time his lunch break rolled around, his stomach on the verge of eating itself from hunger. He dropped by his locker to grab his wallet and mobile but stopped short, seeing a text flashing on the screen from Draco.
When they reached the training grounds, Draco signed for his visitor’s badge, then followed Harry into the stands. Harry gestured to the front row of seats behind one of the goals. “You should be able to see everything all right from here,” he said, leaning in to give Draco a quick kiss.
“Something important,” his neighbour answered shortly. He didn’t look up from what he was reading. Well then.
Their introductions had gathered the table’s attention, and Rose, Luna and Neville all stood up to join their circle and meet Draco. Names and hugs and handshakes were exchanged, and when Luna approached him, she plucked a thin green paintbrush from her bun and tucked it behind his ear.
He ducked back into his flat, setting the box of tea and his pen on the coffee table, and Harry kicked at his trainers self-consciously as he waited. He didn’t know what he was doing. Well, he knew he was spontaneously buying treats for and proposing walks with his attractive neighbour who dated men, but that didn’t exactly clarify matters.
Harry spent the next few days alternating between all-consuming thoughts about the game against Belgium and all-consuming thoughts about Thursday night. He threw himself into practice, and when he emerged from the pitch after England’s victory, dripping with sweat and aching all over and smiling at his teammates, Coach Scrimgeour clapped his shoulder, exclaiming, “Potter, that may have been your best game so far! Keep it up!”
“Anyway, it’s nice to meet you,” Pansy continued, kissing Harry’s cheeks in turn. His attention was still trained on Draco, who was studiously and uncharacteristically avoiding eye contact. “I’m Pansy.”
Draco seemed almost as surprised as Harry at the offer. “I… no, I’m not busy. I’m meeting with someone for an interview this afternoon and was planning on working until then, but a walk could be nice. Just give me one second.”
The moustached man had the good grace to chuckle and shake his head. “I’m afraid not, son,” he said. “I’m not expecting anybody. And I’m married.”
“Why did you ask what had happened to my parents on our first walk? If you covered football, surely you already knew.”
. Of course it was dead. That meant he couldn’t call a locksmith either. He had no way to get into his flat and he had no way to contact someone who could help.
