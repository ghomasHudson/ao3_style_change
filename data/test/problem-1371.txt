A violet aeroplane flew in and Harry grabbed it.  Draco's delicate script appeared within the carefully folded paper.
They stayed frozen like that until Draco became uncomfortably aware of the hard wooden chair against his tail bone.
Draco grinned in a way that made Harry nervous and made him wonder if he’d just promised his soul to a dragon. “You can owe me one,” Draco replied smugly. “Come here.” Before Harry could object, Draco took hold of Harry’s arm and Apparated them away.
Draco pressed against Harry’s body as he stretched to point at the far column. He tapped a graceful finger on his own elegant script. “These are the ingredients being grown illegally.”
Despite his comment about never looking at her again, he certainly didn't want to keep his back to her, so he settled for glaring at a spot on his sofa beside her.
Harry would feel this all night, and it made the thought of naked dinner with Luna even more awkward.  Oh God.  What if he dripped?
“New group in the morning,” Charlie said tiredly as they trudged along the trail that would lead their group back to the safety of Bârlog.  After two long days in the field, they were all exhausted.  The Italian tourists they were escorting had been an easy group, except for a belligerent witch who failed to appreciate the dangers of wearing flashy jewellery around dragons.  She seemed convinced that their insistence on her leaving her jewels behind in the village was part of a plan to rob her, and even now she quickened her steps to return to the inn first.
The woman stops by a pillar of swirling marble and rests her hand against it. Under her touch, it darkens and becomes the rough bark of a gnarled tree. There are trees all around them now, and the woman moves deeper into the forest. Figures draped in black robes move in around her. They are completely covered but for snake-like slits for their eyes. They move around the woman, but they stop at the edge of a clearing, while the woman continues on towards a log on the ground.
It didn't last very long. Draco barely remembered more than Potter's permission to move faster and then his own frenzied thrusting until they both collapsed into a sweaty, sticky pile of limbs. Draco was pretty sure his performance had not been particularly impressive, but it had been enough for Potter to climax and then curl into him with a sleepy smile on his lips.
Draco looked deliciously smug. "Even better. You know those big Muggle structures that run long lines of thick wire?"
The Angove-Bronstein wedding. They still hadn’t cancelled. Apparently they were just bringing in the Aurors. “What, like security?”
Harry pushed down his annoyance. He wasn’t asking Draco because he was worried about showing up without a date. This wasn’t the Yule Ball and Harry certainly wasn’t fourteen anymore. In fact, if the Yule Ball had taught him anything, it was that no date was much better than the wrong one.
Charlie nodded.  “It’s dangerous working with dragons.  Skill matters far more than personality.” He smiled wryly. “Much like the Aurors, I expect.”
Scorpius giggled and pulled away, rubbing his jammy cheek against Draco’s robes. Draco held him tighter. He almost felt himself again as Astoria held up the morning’s paper and showed the article about their upcoming charity garden party. They had run the event together for the past six years, and it was one of his greatest sources of pride. He would continue to organize it, even after he moved back to Britain, because it was so successful at raising funds for the Parisian magical hospital.
'Life changing events, both of them,' Harry deadpanned. He handed the tray to Draco and crawled back into their bed. 'So what shall we do today? Laze around with a crossword? Go to the village for lunch? Go flying?' When Draco had first moved in, they had avoided each other out of fear of shattering their fragile truce. Now, Harry didn't even doubt that Draco would spend the day with him.
"Outside, Harry. We are going to talk." And with that, Hermione stormed to the door, flung it open, and turned back to Harry with a look that left him no choice.
Harry tried to apologise for his neglect and reach for Draco to return the favour, but Draco stepped away.
He let his eyes fall to the thin, faint scar he'd been ignoring on Draco's chest.  The brief reminder of what a moment's stupidity could have cost them was all it took to sober him and pull him back from orgasm.  He could never undo that scar or the terror that must have accompanied it, but he could create new memories of pleasure and joy.
Even as he thought it, he knew the idea didn't really have any appeal.  Shagging?  Yes.  Shagging everyone in the Ministry?  No.  He was picky—no— selective.  He needed to find someone worth his time, but Blaise was right about the advantages of doing so promptly.
The ground did not swallow Harry up.  It never did.  Stupid ground.  So Harry was forced to look up into Malfoy's face and accept the ridicule and scorn.  Except it wasn't there.  Malfoy's lips were quirked to one side, but it was simple mirth without malice.  More significant was the dark and hungry look in his eyes.  He had caught Harry looking, and he liked it.
He got up and used his wand to restore his trunk to full size.  Digging inside, he found the bag of purchases he had made during his layover in Amsterdam on his way to England.  He hadn’t had a chance to use them yet, as he’d had little privacy over the past week, and they seemed the perfect solution to his current frustration.
Perhaps he was a little kinky underneath his inexperience. He had to admit that he didn't seem to know himself very well in that department if he'd overlooked his attraction to Draco for so long.
Harry swallowed again to calm his throat as he moved in front of Draco's new position. He took Draco back into his mouth and heard, 'Oh, thank god,' muttered above him. He pressed his hands firmly into Draco's hips to keep them in place and then tried moving his head.
“Malfoy is my real name, Potter.”  The glare grew fiercer.  “Fine, fine.   Harry .”  He'd never admit it, but it actually felt rather thrilling to call him that.  He couldn't resist trying it again.
Harry smiled guiltily. He did tend to fidget when he couldn't remember an answer. And drink copious amounts of tea. It helped him think! Maybe tea would help him figure out Draco's problem.
Malfoy shrugged as if it were nothing. As if it weren’t the opposite of what he would have done at eleven years of age. “I check the places they used to gather. I spent a lot of seventh-year looking for places to be that the Carrows wouldn’t go, and I learned there were things more frightening than this forest.’
Ron scowled. "You can be all philosophical and sharing. If I find out someone's wanking to thoughts of my wife, I'm going to Hex his balls off."
"I am not!" His instinct was to be contrary, but her predatory smile made him doubt his choice of reply.
He wrinkled his nose as he thought about her given name. It was quite a mouthful. Granger was efficient and clever, just like the witch. Her-mi-o-ne was … tedious. He snickered to himself as he realised that too fit the witch. Fine then. Hermione.
The fingers were gingerly removed, leaving Harry empty and tense with anticipation.  More was coming.  Draco's huge cock was coming and it would be nothing like dildos, fingers, or average-sized penises.  When the tip of Draco's cock lined up against Harry's hole, he had to fight back a laugh.  He was probably grinning like a fool, even as the flames of terror licked at his chest.  What if it hurt too much?  What if it was bliss?  It was like his first time all over again.
“You aren’t even listening are you.” Draco sounded more teasing than annoyed, so Harry smiled at him.
He startled when he felt a presence behind him as soon as he’d crossed the street. His Auror training wanted to turn and Stun his follower, but he reminded himself where he was. Turning, he saw Malfoy running a hand over his own silky hair and looking stubbornly casual.
Thuban glanced at Harry, who gave a startled bow. The dragon huffed at him before turning and stalking back to his cave. Both wizards stood stock-still for long moments before Draco returned to Harry’s side and led him away.
Footsteps approached and he was rolled onto his back with the toe of a shoe. A very scuffed, chocolate brown Oxford.
as he paid the bird, but the paper in his hand was all in French. Poor bird must have flown across the Channel to deliver Draco’s paper. Harry shook his head. Crazy magical birds. He carried the paper back to the large bed to distract him from waiting for Draco to return.
Draco nodded at that. For all that Arthur Weasley was obsessed with Muggles, his children were wizards through and through. Over the past year, Draco had decided that the Weasley feud his father had started was not an advantageous one. While he still had too much pride to even speak to the youngest two, he'd forced himself to be civil to the others he saw around the Ministry.
He climbed onto the bed with a knee on each side of Potter's hips. Clothing would need to be removed, but Draco wanted the reassurance of kissing first. When Potter's mouth was opening under his and welcoming his tongue, Draco felt that being with Potter was as natural as breathing. Sex would simply happen and it would be perfect.
Just as Harry was getting into it, Draco pulled back with a shark-like grin. “Date’s over. Next date starts in five minutes. I’ll meet you at Fortescue’s.”
“Sole meunière,” Merryn announced as she placed the buttery fish in front of them. “Aida really outdid herself.” As she topped up their glasses of muscadet, she turned to Potter. “She is amazing with fish. My mum makes nice fish, but Aida...just smell it! The butter is just lightly browned and then the lemon just cuts through the heaviness of the butter and add a lightness that—”
As they strolled the tidy formal garden, Harry tried to focus on Malfoy’s words. He was saying something about a charitable garden party he and a friend helped organise each year, but Harry could only hear the smooth tone of his voice and the way he pronounced the Latin names of flowers with a French accent. Harry wondered if Malfoy would help him with his own garden at home. Neville had helped some, but he didn’t understand that Harry was more interested in how the flowers looked and smelled than in what they could do. In fact, Harry would rather they not do
It was much later in the evening when Oliver finally came down from his story-reading duties to join the adults again.
A quick glance to the other cottage showed a tall figure standing in the shadow of the doorway.  Even with the obscured view, Harry could tell it was a man, tall with a strong lean build.  Definitely not Luna.
Voices approached, two women. The voices seemed to settle at the next table and he could soon make out their words. One was American and the other was from the West Country—not as strong an accent as Hagrid’s, but still distinct. He could tell almost immediately that the conversation was heated.
The only complication was that Lucius had an heir. Young Draco would have to be removed as well if the Malfoy holdings were finally to pass to Claudius. A minor annoyance, but one that could easily be fixed without Claudius even lifting a finger.
“You be nice to him, Draco. It’s good to have new faces up here, and he’s a lot friendlier than you are.” Rather than taking offence at the slight, Malfoy inclined his head as if he agreed. “Think you can handle settling him in? I need to close up shop before dinner.”
As Draco packed his things, he considered sending an owl to his mother. What if she was in danger, too? He quickly dismissed the thought. If Narcissa knew, she'd insist that he join her in Argentina—or worse, she'd return to England—and that
"It is to me."  Malfoy's eyes burned and Harry wished they'd made it into whatever room held the drink Malfoy had offered.  "Growing up, I learned everyone's surname because their family was what made them important or not.  Or so I thought at the time.  It was a way of classifying people and maintaining a barrier between myself and others."
Something hit him in the face, and it took him a moment to pull his thoughts back to the Auror Department and the memo now sitting on his desk. Ron laughed at him and snatched up the paper.
Draco groaned dramatically and dropped his head to the hand not currently clasped with Potter’s. He enjoyed the dramatics, but he was secretly pleased Potter’s friends wouldn’t be openly hostile.
“Hey, is there somewhere else we can have dessert?” Potter’s cheeks were pink as he looked at him with those intense green eyes of his. “I really want to try the chocolate cake, but I was having more fun before we had an audience.”
He reached the long stretch of stone wall and placed his hand flat against it. The magic only recognised a handful of people, and it was only for them that the wall would become a passageway leading to the north stairs. Draco had done the charmwork himself, inspired both by the gates at Malfoy Manor—which had been charmed to only admit the Malfoy family but were later changed by the Dark Lord to allowed those with his Mark—and the entrance to Slytherin—a flat wall which became a passage with a password.
Draco's tongue slid into his mouth and Harry met it with his own. The taste of champagne was gone, but there was a sweetness to Draco's tongue that made Harry want to suck on it forever. Draco hands slid between them and fumbled with the buttons on Harry's shirt. Mirroring him, Harry tried to open Draco's buttons. Their kissing grew fiercer as they competed to open the other's shirt, and Draco moaned triumphantly as he pulled Harry's shirt open and pushed it off his shoulders.
He stuck out his tongue and lapped at the head of Draco's cock. Draco's bucked and moaned. A hot rush of power went through Harry as he thought,
"Exactly. Ginny's dad is so bad in the kitchen he nearly burned the whole house down. Trust me: this is win-win. You pack a bag, and I'll go Floo Ginny."
—with his broad shoulders and soul-melting smile—was trying to lead him astray. Harry should be enjoying the warm pub with his friends while
These were all rather alarming realisations for Draco, especially with them being locked up together. It was a good thing he had them after his fevered dreams or he might have said rather embarrassing things to Potter. Although the dreams might have been better. Less Snape dancing and more Potter in a towel.
Harry pulled the long sleeved t-shirt over his head, marvelling at the soft fabric that clung to his arms and chest as he adjusted it into place. A glance at the mirror showed the shirt clinging to him like a second skin, and he had to admit that it showed off his physique better than his usual clothes. He’d worked hard to put muscle on his lean frame, so why not show it off?
This was all a bit too serious for naked aperitifs.  Especially when the aperitifs were still missing.  "So you're breaking down barriers?  Is that why the lack of clothing?"
"Kreacher!" A house elf popped into sight at Potter's feet. This close, Draco recognised the old Black family elf his father had used to trick Potter in fifth-year. Draco didn’t know all the details, but he knew his father had told the elf to lie to Potter and that Potter's godfather had ended up dead.
But Harry could be very observant if he needed. Like now, Draco was twisting the paper from his straw. Coupled with his sudden seriousness moments before, Harry knew there was something troubling his friend. If he pried, Draco would clam up—he still hated to show any weakness in front of Harry—so he would have to collect clues on his own. He was an Auror for a reason after all, friendly teasing aside.
“You're nice to Clearwater.”  That pout looked more realistic, and Draco briefly wondered if Blaise was daft enough to be jealous of the silly cow who headed Substances.
“Well, well, Potter. Who knew? I mean, I expect young Aurors to be in shape, but you really are fit.” He stopped and reached out his hand as if to touch Harry’s waist before pulling back again. “Look what you’ve been hiding all these years. Not a scrawny thing at all.” He looked down Harry’s legs. “Knees are still knobbly, but grown men shouldn’t wear shorts anyway.”
Draco didn't see Potter again for the rest of the week.  No “thank you for the impressive report.”  No follow-up questions.  No details about Friday's dinner plans.  Nothing.
It was refreshing to spend so much time with his best friends without feeling like a third wheel. He knew it was time to leave them alone as a couple whenever he found himself eager to have Draco to himself, but he also enjoyed time together as two couples. It was refreshing to see his best friends without nagging or worried looks. Ron didn’t comment about him needing a holiday and Hermione didn’t ask about his eating. They all just enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the delicious food. Harry could get very used to it.
“I can narrow it down for you.” Draco smiled smugly before leaning across Harry once again to point out one of the entries in the illegally grown column. “Squib’s Friend. It’s not what kills the person; it more like insult to injury. It destroys the victim’s magic, so by the time he feels the initial dizziness of the poison, he is hindered in his attempts to save himself.”
But when Hermione mentioned the views at the latest resort with a pleading look in her eye, Harry smiled and assured her he would look into it. Maybe someday he would.
Draco was itching to hear more, but he was too loyal to Pansy to ignore how worried she looked. He went to sit next to her and scooped her hand into his. "Pansy, I won't tell. Longbottom will never know that you told me. I promise."
What way?  Like a sexual predator that might bend Harry over any surface and rip him apart by impaling him with—
Harry closed his eyes and let himself go to the sensations pulsing through him. A strong arm wrapped around him and he allowed himself to partially collapse against Draco’s chest.  God, he smelled good.
Harry supposed that Ron saw another man with his hands on Harry's boyfriend, their bodies close and moving to intimate music. But Harry just saw Draco being happy. Harry couldn't dance like that, and he had no desire to try. He could do a simple two-step, and that was the only dance he needed. It worked for a slow song, and the last song was always slow.
He picked up the round fruit and turned it in his hand to appreciate the flawless skin and bright colour. Curious if the taste matched the appearance, he took a bite. The sound was a clear crunch and then tart juice with a hint of sweetness filled his mouth. He chewed slowly enjoying the flavour.
Draco took a deep breath to compose himself. He had made a mistake—hardly the first in his life—and he would move on as he had before. He wouldn’t worry Scorpius by being sullen. With his head held high and a stiff smile on his face, he walked up the path to the large house his great-grandfather had built in the countryside outside Paris. The oak door swung open as he approached, and he stepped into warm air scented with baked sugar. His stiff smile melted into something real. Astoria must have been baking again. She knew he didn’t approve of encouraging Scorpius’ sweet tooth, but she clearly didn’t care. At the moment, he didn’t either. He just wanted to be home with the people who cared about him, who saw him as more than his past mistakes.
In the days leading up to that morning’s hearing on D.U.M.B., Draco and Hermione had fussed and fretted over every bit of expert testimony and legal precedent, at the cost of everything else. They only ate because they could do it while pouring over law books. They both fought sleep like an enemy, leaving Oliver and Harry with grumpy partners who wanted nothing to do with them if it wasn’t to help with D.U.M.B.
Despite Potter’s privacy charm, Draco still found the meal less enjoyable than it should have been. Aida’s cooking was as fine as ever, and yet Draco felt he could hardly taste it as he tried to ignore Gabby’s eyes on him. He only barely controlled his startle when Potter covered his hand with his own.
Harry propped himself up on his elbows to glare into those stormy eyes.  "Don't you dare.  Get some lube and open me up."
, but Draco was completely mistaken. Harry was starting to suspect he could definitely come to need Draco.
Harry shared his own findings from the farms he had visited. All the normal channels showed no sign of large amounts of controlled ingredients being grown or purchased. Whoever was brewing the potion was either growing it themselves or had their own illegal provider.
Aamu is dreaming. As a child she was fooled by her visions and dreams, but now she recognises the feeling of being away from her body. The tall woman she sees standing by a pillar with long pale hair and foreign clothes is not really with her, but it does not mean she isn’t real.
“Draco Malfoy has been apprenticing with us for the past three months.”  Harry’s attention snapped back to Charlie.
"Reckon they are the only ones who'll have him," came Ron's voice before he walked into the room. "They have Aurors to keep an eye on him." It was the usual talk, but there wasn't much feeling behind it and Hermione didn't even throw anything at him.
Potter smiled sheepishly. "The roast will be a while." He shrugged. "While we're waiting …" He gestured weakly to the bed he was resting on.
The next moment, Draco was falling forward, and Potter was shouting as he struggled to keep his feet. Draco's knee—the one not bound to Potter—hit the ground painfully and he imagined the grass stains that would be evidence of his clumsiness. He braced himself for Potter's inevitable mocking.  He wasn't disappointed.
“Do you need to go into work?” Draco was clearly aiming for casual, but Harry was glad he had missed his mark.
“That’s not—”  Draco snapped his mouth shut.  From his wince, he may have actually bitten his tongue.  He lifted his chin stubbornly, and Harry wondered what he was hiding.
much. But if anyone would get the information they needed, it was her. And Robards would keep her from going too far.
He scooped up his son and kissed him on the nose. "Hello, son. Have you been good to Auntie Astoria?"
Apparently, September would be no different.  Harry sat up among the sheets looking around the tidy room for any sign of Draco.  Nothing.  Sighing, Harry pulled on his discarded pants and looked around for his jeans.  He found them in the hallway and his t-shirt on the edge of the sitting room.
“These are controlled or regulated in some way. They are legal to sell, but the apothecary needs a special licence and must keep records. Weasley will need to visit the apothecaries to determine if our Potioneers are purchasing them legally. If not, they go in the next column.”
“I suspect we’ll manage,” was Malfoy’s dry reply. Jens took his leave, and Harry and Malfoy were left staring at each other for a long moment. Malfoy would have appeared bored, if not for the tension through his shoulders and jaw.
Next to Pavel, there was an Asian witch with short, spiky hair and a wide smile.  Charlie pointed to her and said her name.
Harry was elated.  He'd arrived in Bramblethorn just in time to join Ron and Neville as they tailed the assistant out of the small village's central pub.  The man had inadvertently led them straight to a  derelict house set among the trees on Loch nam Fear's eastern side.
Potter was still staring at him, which made it very hard to keep his mind clear and his hope in check.
When the hedgerow parted, he saw a smaller path lead off to two cottages.  The two buildings were twins, angled toward each other with a large flowerbed between them.
Before Harry could reply, dinner was announced, and they were shepherded into a large ballroom lit with dozens of crystal chandeliers. It was only Harry’s Auror training that had him noting the gold-trimmed vaulted ceiling and the floor to ceiling red drapes that could easily hide an assailant. But there were Aurors who were there to provide security. Harry was there to provide good company and loosen the purse-strings of wealthy benefactors.
Draco was still thrusting inside him, but his cock was no longer an intrusion.  It was part of Harry's body, moving in rhythm with his heart beat until it stuttered and stopped.  Harry coaxed Draco through his orgasm, kissing his face, rubbing his back, and whispering sweet words about how gorgeous Draco was and how amazing he felt.
The next year was Draco's first Christmas away from home. He had been proud that his father had told him about the Chamber of Secrets and tasked him with monitoring and reporting on the situation at Hogwarts. He didn't let his father see how disappointed he was not to go home to his own room, the obedient elves, and his mother's adoration. He knew what his father thought of
"Fine. We can practice," Draco said, returning to the case file. "I am free tomorrow immediately after work, and there is ample space around the Manor." He was free that night as well, but he wouldn't admit to Potter how sparse his social life had become.
Best to simply move on to an area in which Draco could easily lead: Seduction. Surely prudish Gryffindors knew nothing about sex. Potter was the best proof of that. Yes, Longbottom was getting some, but surely that was all Pansy's doing.
The second they crossed the threshold, Harry Apparated them to his bedroom. Draco could think him forward, but there was no way he was going to sit and drink a cup of tea. Propriety be damned.
"You need to go into hiding, Draco." Blaise's voice was gentle but insistent. "Claudius is determined to have you dead and the next assassin he hires will probably take the job far more seriously than I have."
Antero’s words will be enough to ease pain and discomfort, but he will not be able to heal like his mother alone.
Draco rolled his eyes behind her back.  “As if anyone else would want those gaudy baubles anyway.”  Harry snickered and received a sharp grin from Draco in return.
'Vain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than to merely keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world's view of us.' - Virginia Woolf
"Morning," Potter murmured. His hand ran down Draco's arm and around his waist, pulling their bodies together.
Harry didn't remember moving, but he found himself pressed against Draco's back with his lips near Draco's ear. 'Having fun?' He was relieved to hear his voice come out lightly despite the possessive grip he wrapped around Draco's waist. He reluctantly let go when Draco turned to face him, but his heart swelled when he saw the huge grin that made Draco's eyes sparkle. He realised that he often noticed the effect of Draco's expressions on his eyes; perhaps he had a bit of a thing for Draco's eyes.
Mielikki calls Kauko a dragon. Aamu tells her he is Kauko. Kauko says friendly things to Aamu and she is glad to see he has already shed so much pride. His heart and mind are open, and she knows he will make a new legend here.
Harry's knife wavered over the jam jar. Draco hated when he used the butter knife in the jam, but Harry was the one who'd have to wash up yet another piece of cutlery if he used a second knife. Fuck it. He dipped the buttery knife into the jam jar and breathed in the rich smell of damson plums.
The door jingled pleasantly as Malfoy opened it. “Potter. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Malfoy’s tone was dry, but not hostile, which was as much as Harry could hope for.
“Shouldn’t a witch visit her relatives?” Gwenna asked pointedly. She left it unsaid that a woman living with her dead husband’s aunt might not have grounds to criticize a woman visiting her own grandmother.
your mother, well,” Harry shrugged.  “I don’t think Andromeda could hold hard feelings against anyone who Teddy got on with.  Like I said, she wants him to have family.”
Draco looked slightly awkward at they entered the pub, but did not object to eating amongst the Muggles. He drank his cider without comment and thanked the server who brought them their sandwiches.
The duvet was now neatly spread across the bed covering Harry's side as well as Draco's. Harry smiled to himself as he stopped at the doorway to watch Draco's face as he read: a dip of his brow, a slight parting of his lips, a widening of his eyes, a hint of a smile. Watching Draco read the news was far better than anything the papers ever printed.
Robards greeted them tersely and then flicked his hand to indicate they could sit. Harry conjured a chair and sat down, grateful he had finally mastered the spell to the point that his chair had a thin layer of padding and didn’t rock or creak. His first year had included many embarrassing briefings, including one where the legs of his chair gave out and he tumbled to the floor in front of several colleagues. Robards had given him desk duty for a month after that. And confiscated his chair.
Draco, who had done little but chant and moan as Harry prepared him, pulled himself up onto his hands and knees, waving his glistening hole in Harry’s face. Harry grabbed his arse again, pulled the cheeks apart, and lined himself up.
sleep in the spare room when he moved in . . .' Harry didn't like remembering those first few months in which Draco had bitterly accepted a place to stay and had made his unhappiness more than apparent in tetchy silence. 'Once the Ministry gave him access to the Manor and its contents again, there was just too much to fit. We needed the spare room just for his Potions equipment and telescope.'
Draco heard the hiss behind him and ran for the window. He jumped out and landed on a Quidditch field, but Nagini was still behind him. He ran, screaming for help, as the hissing grew louder. Just as he thought his legs would fail him, Potter dove down from the sky on his broom and grabbed him.
He could have knocked both Aurors over with a feather.  Their eyes were wide and their jaws were dangling loose.  Okay, so he didn't apologise much, but it wasn't that shocking.
"Well, I suppose that's up to you." Draco finished his wine and wondered if he could steer Potter back to the bar by the roses. He looked back at Potter and noticed that some of the tension had eased in Potter's frame, even as he stood staring at his own half-full glass. Maybe Draco could steal a sip or two. But first, he suspected Potter was waiting for him to elaborate on his response. "All of the Death Eaters have been accounted for at this point—at least the ones I know about—so perhaps Hogwarts needs you more at this point."
Now, having delivered their three suspects to the holding cells and the contents of the lab to the evidence room, he stood in Robards' office receiving the man's rare praise.  Ron and Neville beamed beside him.
“From the case notes, you seem confident it's being brewed domestically—not smuggled in from abroad—so I'm fairly certain you're looking at the Highlands.  The shelf life of Euphora is only a couple of weeks, and you have people reporting taking it as recently as late July.  If it's being brewed in Britain in the summer, it would have to be in the Highlands.”
Rolling his eyes, Draco pushed Potter away but was secretly pleased. "Egg, Potter. And toast. Golden brown with real butter. Tea goes without saying. I suppose it's too much to hope you have something other than teabags."
The actual news—as Draco learned in the department meeting the next Monday—was that Clearwater was being transferred to work on the International Substance Counsel based in Venice.  It was a very cushy position that she had done nothing to earn.  More upsetting was that all of Draco's hard earned points for favours rendered were now worth nothing.  He eyed up his colleagues and wondered who would take over the joy of bossing him around and fondling him inappropriately whilst he did their work with no acknowledgement.
'What are you offering?' Draco's hushed voice was laced with hope, but fear shone in his eyes. Harry wanted to kiss it away. So he did.
Charlie raised a hand in a calming gesture.  “There’s no rule.  As long as you two get along and do your work, I don’t care who you date or shag.”  He looked thoughtful.  “And even if this didn’t work out, one of you could always transfer to Okello’s team.”  Harry wanted to assure him that it would definitely work out, but he realised he couldn’t be so sure before they’d even had their first date.
The Kauko with hair like snow has a second chance. He can chase pride, or he can chose to heal like his mother. To do that, he must find the bee.
“I’ve known Draco long enough to not believe a word out of his mouth.” Draco clutched at his chest dramatically with mumbles about her wounding him. “And I know who you are, Mr Potter.” He tried to say to call him Harry, but she wasn’t through. “I also know it’s past lunch time.” She gave Draco a stern look. “Don’t starve our only guest.”
Potter was bouncing on the balls of his feet like a four-year-old at the door to Honeydukes. "Robards is happy. Ron's fucking thrilled! And I don't have to give up fieldwork for paperwork." He walked up to Draco all but shaking with excitement. "And it's all your doing!" He pulled Draco to his feet and
“Well part of that might help,” Harry ventured cautiously.  He ignored Draco’s glare and pushed ahead.  “You could just say you’re sorry.  I mean, you are, aren’t you?”
Harry felt Draco turn and shove him back against the wall. “I can hear you thinking, Potter. You are radiating nerves!” He was frowning and sounded rather annoyed. Would he change his mind and leave?
"Practice?" he spat. "Do you honestly believe I plan to spend the next few weeks tying my leg to Potter's and trying to run?"
“I spend time with Rolf because he is good company, Potter.  I’m not a dragon that only seeks company to copulate.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered open as Harry called his name and squeezed his shoulder. "Wha …" And then he sat bolt upright. "Did they decide?"
“Just walking Draco to his desk,” Harry replied as he wrapped an arm around Draco's waist and gave a squeeze.
“Of course he’s named after a constellation,” Ron muttered.  “Of all the pretentious . . .”  He suddenly looked up at Harry.  “No offence to Sirius,” he said hastily.  Harry shook it off with a smile; Sirius had been the first to admit his family’s pretensions.
Draco sighed dramatically. “Yes, I suppose I did. Fraternising with Harry Potter and a Weasley; what has become of me?”
Merryn shrugged and pushed her hair from her face with her arm. Her hands were covered in soapy water as she washed up. “So? Maybe it’s time I stop hiding it.”
Kauko on his knees using all the words Antero taught him to stop the bleeding of a stranger. Kauko is a good pupil, and they are good words, but there is so much blood. Mehiläinen is there beside him, but Kauko doesn’t understand yet. He uses the words. He uses the power within him, but he does not use the power beside him.
The light began to fade and the wind picked up. It grew quite cold, especially given the state of Draco's pants, and he finally sat up enough to pull out his wand and cast a Cleansing Charm on each of them.
Draco was certain at least a couple sets of eyes fell on their joined hands as they moved through the pub. Potter was going to start rumours with his reckless actions, but Draco didn't protest. He should have thought about how the association would help his reputation, but instead his mind went to discouraging any others who might fancy a chance at Potter.
“English?” the witch asked in a heavy accent. Harry nodded. “Muggleborn?” Harry frowned, wondering if he was about to face pureblood politics. The witch must have guessed his concern because she explained her question. “The Floo is always harder for those who did not use it as children. Like swimming.” Harry gave her a weak smile and nodded. “You eaten?” Harry noted that she did not ask if he was hungry or if he
Inside was a single bed against the near wall with a small table next to it. There was a desk and a chest of drawers on the far wall with a large window in between. All of the furniture was wooden—probably pine—and the bed held a stack of pinkish-red blankets. Stepping up to the window, Harry looked out at the jagged mountains cast in purple and orange by the setting sun.
Next to the young witch’s dark skin and striking features, Draco should have looked sickly and ordinary. There was no change to his usual pallid complexion despite three years in Greece. An image of Snape came to mind, and Harry supposed Potioneers didn’t have many opportunities to tan.
Draco nodded dully. He didn’t have much hope of success, but he couldn’t argue that she didn’t have the right to demand it of him. She had forgiven him for Hogwarts and the war when he had done nothing but torment her for years. He owed her an awkward conversation with Harry, no matter how much pride he had to swallow.
Draco looked back at the woman as Merryn helped her into a chair. For a terrible moment he had wondered if it were Rita Skeeter in disguise, but he doubted she was that good at her charms. The woman saw him looking and waved. He waved back, which she must have taken as an invitation as she was suddenly beside him. His manners forced him to stand and introduce himself.
Harry couldn’t hold back the laugh that erupted from him. His mind was full of Draco interacting with children of all ages and not hexing a single one of them, even when provoked. He saw Draco’s sour look and tried to reign in his mirth. “Why
Malfoy’s head dropped back against the wall as he laughed. “I’m afraid we might have to move you into a dressing room. I have an assistant who comes in soon to help with the afternoon rush.”
Draco looked sheepish, and he and Harry allowed themselves to be led to a little table in the back of Aida’s kitchen where she set out plates and cutlery for them. Cheeses and fruits flew onto a platter from different parts of the room as Aida brought over a flaky golden baguette, sweet-smelling sliced ham, and two types of pâté.
“Sure beats being on the teams that keep the Muggles away,” Okello replied.  “Way too much Charm work to modify memories properly.”  He wrinkled his nose at the thought.
"I'm having dinner with Potter," he said to himself. The words didn't make it any more believable and the wind was picking up, so he turned heel and Apparated to The Witch's Brew.
Despite having just been dismissed to rescue kittens, Harry couldn't resist a little smile of relief.  When he'd first entered the loo and seen Zabini and Draco together, he'd felt crushed.  Not that Draco showed any interest in him, but it was still terrible to think that he was with someone else, especially a pompous git like Blaise Zabini.  Seeing the other man rudely dismissed allowed Harry to continue to hope that he might someday have a chance.
Harry fancied Draco.  He’d given up on denying that after Draco had returned from his week away with tales of “Edward this” and “Edward that”.  Harry had hated Edward almost instantly.  Then, when Draco’s stories mentioned Edward’s fiancée and the fact that Edward was a cousin, Harry had suddenly found the man much improved.  Faced with his own jealousy, Harry had been forced to accept that he saw Draco as more than surprisingly-decent company and a toned body.  He wanted Draco to be more than his fit flatmate.
Confident in Draco's pleasure, he fumbled for the lube again.  He slicked his fingers again and, his mouth still sucking Draco's cock, began circling the puckered entrance hidden between firm buttocks.  He would have loved to watch his finger tease and ultimately penetrate that tight little hole, but he sensed that Draco's needed his ministrations to stay relaxed.  He sucked hard as he let his first finger push inside.  Draco tensed again, but quickly relaxed.
Harry usually ended up at Draco's house in the evenings, and it was much clearer what his intent was then.  He ate Draco's food—despite having a house-elf, Draco found he liked cooking—drank his wine, and then fucked him into the mattress.  Harry would then be too tired to go home, so he'd sleep in Draco's bed.  After a couple of weeks of this, Harry even had clothes and some personal items stored there.
Having seen how grand the dining room was, Harry didn’t feel his jeans and T-shirt were going to cut it. The wool trousers and jumper Draco had been baking in were already far nicer than anything Harry had packed. Well, other than the morning suit for the wedding, but he wasn’t wearing that to dinner. Surely it being called a “morning” suit meant it wouldn’t be right.
Harry pulled Draco's body flush against his own so he could speak softly in his ear. 'Since we already live together, go to dinner, and know each other's secrets, I figure we really should be shagging, too.'
When Harry returned, Draco was still against the wall, but his company had changed yet again. Standing far too close,
“Welcome!” The wizard called as Harry approached. His accent sounded Scandinavian. “You must be Harry Potter.” Harry felt a flash of disappointment at being recognised so far from Britain, but he nodded. “Ah, good! Charlie said he had a friend coming in, so I figured it had to be you.” A huge grin spread over Harry’s face. He wasn’t Harry Potter; he was just some friend of Charlie’s. “You’re the only arrival today,” the wizard said as he took the broom from Harry. “Won’t get busy 'till the summer starts.”
He smelled even better up close. Harry felt transported to the Greek countryside with its sunshine and warm dirt. Draco’s lips were soft, but his kisses were hard and demanding. Harry parted his lips, hoping to deepen the kiss, but Draco pulled back with a smirk.
Harry bit back a laugh at Draco’s surprised face. Draco shot him a look that was half question, half accusation.
“Nah. They are rather pleased with you at the moment.” Potter smile turned a bit sheepish. “Although I can’t promise Ron won’t make a nursemaid comment or two.”
“Do you think he’s up to something?” Harry’s mind raced through possible scenarios, including Malfoy kidnapping dragons and training them to burn down Muggle cities.  He glanced at Hermione and cowered a bit under her withering glare.  Apparently that
It was Gwenna who had tended to Draco over the following weeks and months, soothing the wounds no one could see. She had encouraged the interest in baking he had developed during the war, hiding in the kitchens with the house-elves. She saw the way it healed him and recognised his talent.
“My hero,” Draco dead-panned.  It was lost on Potter, who turned to him with intense green eyes that spoke of outrage.
Harry was grateful his front step was included in the Fidelius Charm or his neighbours would have gotten quite the show as he pressed Draco against the front door and his thigh against Draco’s crotch.
Charlie continued his introductions, but Harry didn’t hear a word about the next several people.  He wasn't hearing Malfoy's whispered commentary either, focusing only on the heat where their shoulders touched and the way he could feel Malfoy's breath on his ear.
Harry had never been more pleased with Malfoy mocking him, because under all the snark was a genuine invitation to visit. Or at least talk. But Harry
Tuisku picks up his head and turns towards them. He barks and looks at Aamu. She knows he wants to greet his friends, and he runs off as soon as she nods at him. She stays by her door, watching Tuisku bound away. They will reach her cottage soon and she should make coffee.
Harry was getting twitchy, his knee trembling under the table. His fingers soon followed suit, tapping his quill against a piece of parchment.
to play for his House team. Not that there was any chance of Slytherin being allowed to lose. And the new dress robes his mother gave him had simply accentuated how thin and pasty he had become. That Christmas he had gotten everything he would have wanted as a younger boy, but he finally saw how useless it all was when the lives of his family were on a knife's edge.
Harry tried to keep his anger in check, but images of Dobby and Lupin came rushing to mind, along with images of a jeering young boy with pale hair and pointy features.
While the bride and groom went to unpack, Harry wandered out onto the patio next to the rose garden. He had hoped to find privacy, but found Kensa instead. She wasn’t alone. She and Merryn were talking, and it was clearly not small talk. The gestures were too big and they were holding eye contact. Whatever they were discussing, Harry felt they didn’t want to be interrupted. He walked back through the hotel until he reached Rosamund’s kitchen where she was standing with Draco. Her hands were on his shoulders in a comforting gesture, and Harry wondered how much Kensa’s hostility had hurt him.
So was it Flintridge? Harry's hand clenched. And if so, what made the relationship so unhealthy? Did he hurt Draco? Harry realised his heart was pounding and he was beginning to sweat. If he didn't step away soon, he was going to punch Flintridge in the middle of Draco's party on pure conjecture. Draco would not appreciate that.
Great Aunt Gwenna appeared at the door, her silver hair piled elegantly on top of her head and her angular features softened by her smile. Her smile was so like Lucius’ that it hurt sometimes, but in that moment it filled him with warmth. Gwenna squeezed Rosamund’s shoulder as she walked forward. “Well now that he’s back, Rosie, you can fatten him up.” She turned to Draco and offered her warmest smile. “Welcome home, dear. Come sit and tell us how you’ve been.”
"No. You've basically done that job since you were eleven. Maybe it's time for something new." Potter's eyes were so intense that Draco struggled not to squirm until his gaze. He allowed himself a shrug that was too jerky to be elegant and looked away over the vegetable beds to the far greenhouses. "No reason you have to run this Hogwarts program forever either. Maybe once it's up and running you'll move on to something else."
He started down another hallway until he heard distant voices which he followed to a door. He cracked the door open, freezing to observe the scene before him. Draco was stirring a bowl, the sleeves of his soft-looking pale blue jumper rolled up to show sinewy forearms dusted with flour. He wore a pinny over his wool Muggle trousers and the most open and relaxed smile Harry had ever seen on his face. Beside him, the girl from the night before was staring at something on a baking sheet. She looked to be Hogwarts age—maybe about sixth-year—so she must be home for Easter holidays.
Several Weasleys met them at the door of their twisty, creaky home. Seven, to be precise: the Muggle obsessed father, the one with Greyback's scars, the dragon tamer, the Ministry boot-licker, the twin who was no longer one of two, Granger's Weasley, and … Ginny. Draco had actually grown rather fond of the youngest Weasley now that her Hexes were on his side.
Harry shrugged. 'The bed is huge and it saves on Warming Charms. Besides, then we can watch late night telly together without falling asleep on the couch.'
Harry stood up and offered his hand to the boy, who hesitantly allowed Harry to help him to his feet. "This is Draco Malfoy’s son," he told Teddy. He turned to Scorpius and tried to sound as gentle as possible. "Are you here with your dad? Your mum?" He hated the thought of having to speak to the woman he had unintentionally wronged, but the boy was too young not to be escorted back to his family. Harry’s concern for the potential awkwardness of meeting Draco or his wife almost distracted him from the confused look on the boy’s face.
“Well I’m sure you’ll enjoy yourself,” Potter cut in. “But you’ll have to excuse us.” He nodded at Merryn walking in with their main courses. Gabby took the hint and returned to her own table where Merryn had her apéritif already waiting for her.
Harry couldn’t make out much of what they said to and over each other, but a shriek from Hermione confirmed that it was from the Wizengamot. The two of them stood stalk still with their heads together—bushy brown hair like an invading army over straight, pale strands. Harry and Oliver shared a look of mutual hope and fear before Draco’s shout had them almost collapsing with relief.
Draco sat up, but stayed sat on Harry's lap. "I'm not angry. I'm just trying to understand. It's been one hell of a day." Actually, how long had it been?
“And the rooms? I mean, was the hotel itself nice?” Harry was really trying to show interest, but he was exhausted from the double shifts he’d taken to help cover Ron’s absence. Dark wizards didn’t take time off when Aurors did, and someone had to pick up the slack.
Harry glanced at Draco, who was frowning at the map. Then Draco shook his head. “No. Wales. Definitely Wales. Probably.” He muttered something about assuming all the plants were grown in the same place, but Harry decided to ignore it.
“Of course, Ms. Clearwater.”  He stood with a smile and turned toward her office.  He tried to move swiftly, but was not fast enough to avoid a pinch on the arse.
“I’m okay with that,” Harry said, surprised to realise it was true. Malfoy looked surprised as well, and possibly disappointed. “Really, you deserve it, Draco.” He bit his lip not to the laugh at the ridiculous way Malfoy’s eyes widened at the use of his given name. This could be fun.
Moments later, Draco had two long, slick fingers pressed inside Harry's arse, but it was barely a stretch.  Harry's body wanted this, and he was clenching and begging for more.  The third finger stretched him and he relished the heat of the burn.  He felt it through his skin and into every nerve.
Draco nodded, hope trying to bloom in his chest again despite his fears that he was misunderstanding completely. He needed to keep his voice casual. “You mean how we both agree Weasley is best off with Granger?”
Potter opened his eyes at Draco’s voice. He looked from the potion to the glass before meeting Draco’s eye. He looked defensive, so Draco cut off any protests against weakness.
“So I've won over Weasley.  I can die happy now,” Draco drawled.  Potter rolled his eyes but was smiling.  “Now,” Draco continued, “I believe you were telling me about what more you could do in your bed.”  He took a step forward and placed his hands on Potter's chest.  Potter didn't seem to need further encouragement as he pressed his mouth against Draco's and slid his tongue past his lips.  Their tongues moved against each other briefly before their lips closed in a wet kiss.
blossoms around them. They seemed to have wandered away from the ball and its crowds and were now in a small clearing surrounded by lilacs. It was too early in the year for lilacs, and Harry smiled at yet another reminder of the magical world. He couldn't see the distinct pale purple of the blooms in the low light, but the sweet scent was wrapped around him like a mist. There they were. Alone together. In the moonlight. Malfoy’s hair and eyes shining in the darkness.
Draco grabbed his hand and all but dragged him up the stairs. Harry focused on the placement of each foot to keep his mind from what might be expected of him.
And wasn’t that so Draco? To follow these archaic rules no one else cared about, but then bend them to his own purposes. The mere thought filled Harry’s chest with warmth.
"Ron isn't talking to me because he heard Robards is planning to train me as his successor." Potter was pacing in the grass and tugging his hair as the words poured out of him. "It's like fourth-year all over again. I didn't
Potter placed a hand on his shoulder. "But this is all your doing.  And Ron knows that! It's probably the only day in his life he'll be happy to see you. Please?"
Draco nodded his understanding. Having prepared for Hogwarts years before he even received his letter, he couldn't imagine how difficult it would be for a child to be ready in little over a month. Their expectations and understanding of the world would need to change completely! Potter had probably imagined a very different life for himself before his own letter arrived. Draco wondered if Potter ever mourned the Muggle life he gave up. That was more personal than Draco wanted to risk so early on in his infiltration of Potter's life.
!" Well, no. She said he didn't shag, but her response would tell him if the bolder claim of virginity was true.
Harry knew they had witnessed his awkward attempts at small talk during Potions, but now he suspected they had noticed his watching as well. He didn’t mean to watch Malfoy all the time; he just found himself captivated by the pale hair, expressive features, and agile fingers. His eyes just found their way to Malfoy without Harry intending to look at him at all. But if Harry had caught himself staring, he should have known Hermione had seen.
Rosamund came dashing out of the kitchen and enveloped him in warmth, cloth, and the smell of saffron. A rush of longing came over him and he wondered how he had managed without this for so long. Strong, rough hands came up to cup his cheek.
Draco blinked at him a few times, leaving Harry with the odd thought that he would make a handsome owl, and then he was wondering what Draco’s patronus might be. The silence seemed to stretch out for ages with Harry listening to the clock on the wall ticking away.
"No! Draco, no." Virgin then. "You can't tell anyone. Neville would be furious." She had gone incredibly pale and her voice trembled as she said her boyfriend's name. Fuck, she really was gone on him.
The little tree didn’t glow and flash like the charmed trees in the castle, but it was stunning in its own right. Harry turned to the side and took in the satisfaction and contentment on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy was proud of himself. He was proud of his accomplishment.
Bernard Sothman had transferred into Substances two years ago, but thus far he'd been easy to avoid.  Their assignments had never overlapped, so there was no need for them to even talk to each other.  Not that it had stopped Sothman from dropping by Draco's desk daily, but it meant that Draco could always make excuses about important projects and deadlines.
Draco’s breath ghosted over his ear once more. “Greenhouse.” And then the comforting weight on his shoulder was gone.
Perhaps finding her alone like this was a sign. He might not be the most observant Auror—yes, he could admit it—but he was their best interrogator. People either trusted him or were terrified of him, but he always got the information he needed. Time to use that talent on this case.
Potter chuckled and shook his head. "No. I don't think Kingsley gives a shit about being re-elected. He'd much rather be an Auror and let someone else run the country, but he'll do his best by us so long as he's in office." Potter looked oddly earnest. "He really believes that we can move on from all this, and . . . so do I." He stuck out his hand. "Truce?"
If the Aurors wouldn't protect him, he'd have to go into hiding. But Claudius would know about each of the Malfoy holdings, and Draco had no property from his mother's family. He collapsed into a chair.
"I'm not sure." Potter's voice was soft and low. "It depends on the drink and the bloke." Uncertainty shone in his eyes and Draco felt emboldened by the other man's insecurity.
headlines. Rita Skeeter would have an early Christmas describing his sexual perversions and speculating about what
Four figures sat bundled against the cold that even Hermione’s Warming Charms couldn’t defeat.  The distant sun tried its best, as did the hot cups of tea in their hands, but Harry still felt a chill that left him wondering why they were sitting outside in the first place.
Draco had not meant tomorrow. He'd assumed Wednesday at the earliest. His upbringing told him to pretend he was booked solidly for the next week so as to seem important and independent. His groin told him to grab Potter and Apparate to his flat that very moment.
Malfoy arched a single pale brow and then turned to look over his shoulder. He turned back to Harry with his lips quirked up on one side. “It’s funny you should say that. I, in fact, have clothes for sale.” He ran his eyes down Harry’s body. “Clothes you desperately need.”
The Wizengamot better decide soon, Harry decided. He didn’t want Draco on tenterhooks for days. "Not yet. It’s just that Hermione and Oliver are due in a few."
"What?" Potter stopped moving and looked at him with a furrowed brow. He had clearly never asked himself the basic and obvious question.
Harry smiled. “I’ll be glad for something more exciting than confiscating a borderline Dark object from a wrinkled old witch who swears it’s been in her family since Merlin’s time.”
Potter had objected when the prosecution asked for ten years in Azkaban. He cited Draco's age and the threat to his family, and Draco hadn't been able to look away from the burn in Potter's eyes as he defended him. He could feel his pulse race and the magnetic pull that Potter had on him. And when Draco was sentenced to five years, Potter looked outraged even as Draco sighed in relief. He could survive that.
Luna met them when they arrived with a tray of nettle tea and biscuits. She hugged them both and thanked them for luring sprites to the fields with their practices. She claimed the creatures were drawn to competitive energy and loves games and sport. Draco didn't know if any of it was true, but he smiled at her excitement.
When a cake pan went into the oven, Harry thought there might be a pause, but chocolate flew into a pan again and Draco was still clearly focused on his task. Harry felt certain he had been forgotten completely and he was seeing Draco as he would be if alone. It felt rather intimate.
Harry’s mind was racing through a fog. He had so many thoughts and yet he couldn’t make a single one make sense. Was Malfoy telling Harry to open his trousers? Or was he speaking in hypotheticals? He was so close, his warm breath tickling Harry’s neck and cheek. Surely that wasn’t normal. Surely that was an invitation. Harry certainly wanted it to be one.
“Oh, I know who you are, Mr Malfoy. And you, Mr Potter.” She winked at Potter, who had only stood for a moment when Draco had and then immediately sat again.
The schools of Europe had all started again, and the number of visitors to the reserve was already slowing.  Harry looked forward to times when the cold weather would trap Draco and him together in their flat.  Draco couldn’t avoid him forever.
Earnest or not, Draco wasn't appeased. "Awww. Poor wittle Potter's feelings hurt? Fine. I won't talk to you. I'll hardly miss the stimulating conversation." He picked up his drink and walked back to his
A slight twitch was the only indication he'd startled Potter, who rose gracefully to meet Draco with a small smile. "I'm not. I was just marvelling at how they manage to produce vegetables like this. They taste nothing like what I buy at the market, you know?"
Draco looked agitated as he paced around their little kitchen.  “What would I even say?” Draco began again.  “
clean. His only pleasure is knowing that his mother isn't there with him, and yet that is the only pleasure Draco needs.
“He—”  Draco shut his mouth.  Was he actually about to explain this to Harry Potter?  “None of your business.  Go find a kitten to rescue.”  With that he turned and walked out of the loo.
It was best to get the whole thing over with, so Draco walked over to stand at Potter's right side and extended his left leg in offering. Potter pressed his own leg against Draco's and began winding the rope around them.
“This means nothing to you, does it?  This is just . . .  I am just convenient because we live together.  I could be anyone.”  He felt the pressure in his chest grow with the weight of his own words.  How could he have been so stupid?
It was surprisingly thoughtful question. Perhaps Potter realised that close quarters required best behaviour.
Despite his aching cock and the feel Potter's own promising erection pressing against his hip, Draco needed to go home, sober up, and sleep so that he could revise his plan with a clear head.
Well if they're both going to have someone . . .   Harry stopped mid-stride.  “I need to send an owl.  I'll meet you there.”
Prying Potter's warm hands from their current spot at his waist, Draco gave him a firm and final kiss goodbye.
He had to step completely away from Draco to regain enough concentration to open his door. It was a wonder his wand even stayed in his trembling fingers.
Part of Draco wanted to Hex Weasley back—a rather large part—but he reminded himself that he was there to build alliances. He was with three of Britain's most influential wizards and being offered a drink. Perhaps more valuable, it seemed he was being offered a clean slate. A little voice in his head suggested he was getting off lightly with only a Stinging Hex for years of bullying.
Six months later, he is almost able to sleep through the night. And when he wakes to the dull grey walls, he no longer has to fight back tears. He has accepted his fate. He will sit here alone until his five years are up. And when he is finally freed, he will begin to gather the shards of his life and see what he can rebuild. Maybe he will find the courage to thank Potter for his help.
Malfoy Manor sat empty as his father finished his sentence in Azkaban and his mother lived in the flat in Vienna.  She had connected with the Malfoys living there and showed little interest in returning to England.  Draco doubted if any of them would ever choose to live in the former residence of the Dark Lord and his many atrocities.
Harry nodded, a little smile pulling at his lips. Draco was in his element: he was the centre of attention, and he soaked up the limelight like a plant did sunlight.
Before the first dinner, Harry tried to hide his nerves from Draco, who looked even worse than Harry felt. The first part of the meal was awkward, but then Hermione began peppering Draco with questions about the hotel. Once Draco realised that she was genuinely curious—and not looking for fault—he relaxed into a lengthy conversation with her that left Harry free to discuss an Auror case with Ron without being told off for bringing work home.
“All right, back to work everyone.”  She shooed them all away, touching no one but Draco.  As he walked out the door, he could feel Sothman's eyes crawling over him.  When he risked a glance back, he did not like the look on the other man's face: it was as if the man were violating him with his eyes.
Potter must have understood Draco’s explanation because his face cleared into a smile. “Oh, like Ribena!”
"I'll bet Potter doesn't shag in his kitchen." It was a stupid retort, but Draco still found it hard to stay off the topic of Potter. That was Pansy's fault, too. Somehow.
A longing tugged at his heart as Potter bound their legs like usual and wrapped his arm around Draco's waist. Tomorrow would be the last time ever, and even that wouldn't be the same as their evening in Luna's overgrown field.  Draco wrapped his arm around Potter's shoulders, instead of resting it on top as he'd done before. They were pressed together from shoulder to ankle, and Draco soaked up Potter's scent and warmth.
Harry didn’t know whether to be proud or heartbroken that Teddy knew to offer his own loss to comfort other people. He was such a kind child. Perhaps he’d Sort Hufflepuff like his mother.
“This is Pavel,” Charlie said with a gesture to the man at his side. Harry smiled across the table at a handsome man with black hair and clever, deep-set, dark eyes.  He was the only person at the table who looked like he might actually be Romanian.
jeans—were only staying up because a worn leather belt under the shirt was cinched tight enough to keep them above his slim hips. Not that an observer could tell if his hips were slim or not.
“You saw the sitting room and kitchen,” Malfoy stated without turning around, and Harry wondered where the kitchen had been. Malfoy stopped at a corridor with three doors on one side and a fourth at the end. “First door is a closet,” he gestured lazily ahead with a long pale finger. “Next is a bath. You’re the third, and I’m at the end.” Malfoy spoke clearly and with no hint of emotion. He walked to the third door and opened it before stepping aside to let Harry enter his new room.
Draco could imagine Potter squirming on the other end of the phone. And he would use a phone. He was Muggle raised, wasn’t he?
"Luna?" Potter was staring at him with wide eyes. Draco glared back daring him to comment on the war. "Right. Sorry. I'll send her an owl, but I'm sure she won't mind. I'll see you tomorrow."
” he could almost hear Draco scold.  Harry took a resentful bite and felt some satisfaction as crumbs sprinkled down on the fabric below him. Draco wasn't there to notice.
Harry gave him a warm smile and took his hand. The snow was falling harder and they should probably head back to the castle while they could still see more than a metre in front of their faces. “I like Butterbeer,” he said as they started to move through the trees. He squeezed Malfoy’s hand and smiled at him. “And I like ice cream in the winter. The ice cream doesn’t melt everywhere and the queues at Fortescue’s are almost nonexistent.”
"If Weasley would be a good choice, why not put that idea in Robards' head. Even if he disagrees with your candidate, he will likely get the hint that you don't want the position for yourself."
“Of course the cloak had it’s own problems. It covered my hair but not my face, and with my complexion some of the older boys called me ptóma.” He curled his lip up as he said the word. “It means corpse, Potter. Corpse.”
“Harry,” he said flapping Draco's report under Harry's nose, “if he keeps doing things like this, you can marry him with my blessing.”
His mother? She thought he was dead? Oh, fuck. He needed to sort this out. He tried to stand but Harry grabbed his arm. "You're going to St. Mungo's. I'll owl your mother to meet you there."
He stood by the bar nursing a pint as he looked across the room. Boring dignitaries. Conceited old money. Uppity junior Ministry employees hoping to schmooze their way into a promotion. Harry didn't want to talk to any of them.
So far they had found living together surprisingly easy. Draco seemed to delight in the fry-up Harry made daily for breakfast, and Harry was always pleased to discover a pot of stew simmering on the back burner for lunch. Draco had a talent for the subtle cleaning Charms best used on clothing and linens, and he seemed impressed at Harry’s Scouring Charms in the kitchen and bath.
He leapt from bed, grabbed parchment and a quill and wrote a hasty note to Draco.  He said a brief thank you to Hagrid for insisting on getting him a new owl as he tied the note to Iris and watched her fly out the open window.
It really wasn't so different from kissing. Larger than a tongue, yes, but firm and warm in the same way. Draco focused on Potter's noises and squirms, trying to get as much reaction as possible.
Harry was grateful Auror training had included a course on dealing with the press. His instructor had indoctrinated them with several tactics Harry called up to assist him. First was to never answer a yes or no question—or in this case a true or false question—directly. “Use your own words,” the instructor had told them time and again. “If you only use your own words, they might occasionally print them.”
Potter just shrugged it off. “I’ll take a standard room. Maybe away from all the wedding people when they arrive? I’m not really...I don’t actually know any of them.”
Draco grabbed Potter’s arse cheeks and pulled them aside so he could see Potter's pink hole. He ran his thumb over it and smiled as Potter squirmed and moaned beneath him. Right then. First the cleansing spell. Draco ran back to his trousers on the floor and pulled out his wand. He mispronounced the Charm on the first try but Potter's gasp assured him that the second attempt had managed something.
Harry's mind filled with horrible images of ways Draco could entertain himself unaccompanied in a foreign city.  Hadn't Draco once mentioned some Viennese wizard his mother had tried to set him up with?  He felt his body heat with anger at the thought of Draco with another man.
Anger stirred in his chest as his eyes bore into Flintridge's face. Who did he think he was moving into Draco's space like that? Harry hated it when other people fondled his Draco as if—his stomach dropped as he realised that he thought of Draco as his own. But really, didn't Flintridge have as much right to touch Draco as he did? They were all just friends, nothing more.
Back out on the streets of Muggle London—with a Notice-Me-Not so their cloaks didn’t attract attention—Harry no longer had his injuries to blame for his light-headedness or the tightness in his chest. “So …”
Potter's outcry caused Draco to drop his quill. It was Friday evening and he was trying to finish a report before the end of the day. He didn't have plans for the evening, but he wanted to leave before everyone else began to boast about their own busy nights. He turned toward Potter and saw him beaming like a maniac.
The surprise was promptly hidden as Malfoy pulled himself up to his full height and lifted his chin haughtily. “Surprisingly perceptive of you, Potter.”
'So do you want to . . . give this—us—a try?' Harry needed to hear it, despite everything that had been said and done that night.
“You stay. This isn’t your job.” He could feel the argument brewing but he pressed Draco back harder. “You can Apparate back to the Ministry or you can stay here. I’ll send my Patronus when it’s safe.”
Harry felt his cheeks warm, and he turned his head back toward the cool air of the water. He could refuse the invitation on principle, but where would that get him? Back to his room looking at the reports he’d brought along to reduce his guilt over taking time off even though he was only using a fraction of the time he was owed according to the human resources wizard.
“Huh?” He tried to open his eyes and failed. There was a light tinkling laugh and the sound of movement. A few moments later—or perhaps hours for all Harry could tell—a glass appeared in front of his nose with a thump. He forced himself to sit up and take a swallow of what turned out to be cool water. Finally feeling a little settled, he looked up to see amused dark eyes watching him. “Oh, thanks,” he said.
Draco interrupted his rambling with a hand on his arm. It was strong and warm, even through the sleeve of Harry’s shirt. “Thank you.”
Draco forced his jaw not to drop open. Potter was just being civil until the fair as they'd agreed. It didn't mean anything. Although hot food did sound quite good at that moment, and it wouldn't hurt Draco's reputation to be seen socialising with Harry Potter.
rather nice to look at these days, and Harry did look. Quite often. And now he knew a way to look his fill. He smiled at the shop.
Draco tried to keep his name out of the paper after Merryn’s interview, but he no longer hid in his own hotel. He also read Gabby’s Squib Series, as the interviews and articles were being called, and helped where he could. When Draco heard Jowan was struggling to find work in the magical world despite his knowledge of herbology and horticulture, Draco hired him as groundskeeper for the hotel. He wrote to the witch who worried for her son and invited them to enjoy a free week at his hotel to see Squibs incorporated into the magical world.
Draco rolled his eyes dramatically, and Harry almost missed the twitch of his lip. “Come along, ignoramus. And please do keep quiet and refrain from cuddling the livestock.”
"That's great!"  Luna sounded like she really believed it and was finally looking at Harry again.  "I'm a bit behind on dinner, so why don't you go over to Draco's and catch up.  I'll come by when dinner is ready."
He tapped the kettle with his wand and it whistled instantly.  That was one of the perks of magic that would never grow old.  He poured it over the teabag in his favourite Hungarian Horntail mug and left it to steep, as he pulled out frying pans, eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms, beans, and bread.  With a flick of his wand, everything flew to the correct pan and began simmering away.  Harry smiled.  He threw out his teabag and poured in a dollop of milk.
“Right then.” Draco pulled out the wand Harry had used to end the war and conjured a beautifully carved chair with red velvet cushions. “Let’s see what drivel has made it into the file thus far.” He sat down, crossing one long leg over the other and displaying a black boot laced with a series of delicate silver hooks. The leather was so rich and supple.
and you’re holding up the game.” Harry snickered; he loved the name of the wizarding version of the Muggle board game.  He always got an image of groupies chasing Gilderoy Lockhart.
Harry didn’t taste his ice cream. He was pretty sure he was eating Butterbeer flavour, but his mouth and mind were both completely fixated on the man across the table who was licking bright green ice cream off his spoon. Oh, to be that spoon!
Draco held up his hand. “No, Potter. I think your idea about Muggle things is our best hope. We need to learn whether Squib’s Friend can grow with Muggle sun.”
He shifted in his armchair and took another sip of wine before rereading the section on Umbridge with relish. That had been Hermione’s idea, and an especially good one. Dolores Umbridge had stepped on a lot of toes to gain power before and during the war, and the owners of those toes had been more than happy to get their revenge during the trials. She had been blamed for any Ministry policy or procedure that the War Investigation Commission had deemed unjust, and she had become a favourite scapegoat for people on both sides of the war. Associating Umbridge with discrimination against magical beasts was a brilliant way to make most people uncomfortable and even angry. Hermione’s idea to have Firenze detail the ways that Umbridge had belittled and insulted him would surely work to their advantage.
“Because I’ve known him since I was a child!  He’s friends with my cousin Edward.”  Draco was glaring quite heatedly.  “Don’t worry, I won’t taint the innocent researchers.”  He flicked his wand with far more force than necessary and the tent bounced as it sprang up.  “Besides, if you had
Draco slid down the wall and pulled Harry to his chest. 'Brilliant, you.' He kissed the top of Harry's head. 'Brilliant.' Harry's whole body tingled at those words. He hadn't fucked it up. He'd enjoyed it, and Draco'd enjoyed it. This was all going to work.
"You didn't actually swallow the poisoned piece of apple, and the poison needs to react with stomach acid to become fatal. Without that reaction, it only slows the heart and lungs until you are in a state of suspended animation."
The drink must have aggravated his temper.  “Let's get you home, Potter,” he said as he led Potter to the Floo.  He sent Potter through first and followed immediately after repeating, “Buddleia Cottage,” in a much clearer voice than Potter had.  He stepped out of the Floo to find Potter face down on a rather nice looking rug.
“You're going to have to give it up eventually,” Blaise said.  “Why not let me fuck you?  I'm handsome, charming, and strong.  And I can keep the others away.  You'd be all mine.”  Blaise's eyes flashed possessively as he rolled his hips forward.  Draco was completely aware of the large, heavy cock pressed against the crease of his thigh and groin.  He knew Blaise was hung—everyone who had shared their dorm knew that—but now that Blaise's cock was so very near his arse he began to panic.
Draco opened his mouth to argue, but he couldn’t find any words in the face of her bright brown eyes. She was as stubborn as the rash lunatic upstairs with the scar on his forehead. He closed his mouth and gave her a small nod.
If Sothman were Draco's boss, Draco would find it far harder to slip away or use work as an excuse.  Even worse, Sothman would have direct control over Draco's career.  A fact that Sothman was sure to use to his advantage.
The smile spread farther across Draco’s lips. "How juvenile, Potter." He gave into a smile. "Some of us have grown up over the years."
He forced down his nerves, refusing to let things get awkward and ruin the happiness he'd only just discovered. He made sure he had a smile on his face and looked up into Draco's eyes. The hint of nervousness in Draco's features melted instantly.
It must be a colleague from the Ministry. The cruel witch might even be in Harry's house that very night. Harry forced his mind back to the party and playing host for Draco's sake. He'd spent weeks planning this party, and he wasn't going to let anything ruin it, but maybe he could use it as a chance to discover the identity of Draco's mystery woman.
Harry laughed, a rich hearty sound that made Draco's stomach squirm. "What? You that upset you'll miss watching Zabini and Parkinson snog?" He gestured with his head back to Draco's table and his groping friends.
“You don’t even know Leah Bronstein, do you?” Draco knew the bride had only just moved here from the States. Potter was rescuing strangers again.
“As I have two days off,” he took Draco’s hand and pulled him back to the bed, “I was rather hoping I could tempt you to spend some more time with me. What happens after six dates in your ancient customs?”
'So what's your plan for tonight?' Harry asked with all the innocence he could fake once Draco had finished the article.
“And selfish and moody,” Charlie said casually. “Don’t I know it.” He shrugged as if spending all day training a spoiled brat were no inconvenience. He set his cup back on the garden table and helped himself to one of the biscuits Mrs. Weasley had sent over. “But so are dragons.”
Potter looked at him as if he had grown another head or two. “Please don’t call me Mr Potter. It’s just weird. Harry is good.”
have more.”  That sat in silence a moment, Harry staring at Draco and Draco staring at the blanket.  “You do realise that makes no sense at all.”
Harry smirked back at him. “I was wondering if I could lure you to the Burrow. There’s food, drink, and Quidditch.”
Anger quickly turned to panic. What if Harry had taken too long and Draco had given up on him? What if he had already slipped away and was interested in Flintridge?
Harry looked at Rosamund to see how she was taking her daughter’s announcement to court animosity. There was definitely a tightness around her lips that spoke of worry, but her eyes shone with pride.
She places the pulla on the table, glad she made the sweet rolls with raisins and almonds that morning. Kauko and Mehiläinen will be hungry, especially once they chop wood. She knows Kauko will insist and Mehiläinen will move with him like another arm of his body.
"You did it. I had a chat with Robards yesterday about how Ron was so great with tactics and people, and today, Robards named Ron his Deputy Head and successor!"
“Fine! I want to go!” Harry called, hoping to bring back the fevered look in Draco’s eyes. Draco ignored him and continued walking. “Please? Please, Draco?” At the first sound of begging, Draco froze. He looked far too pleased when he turned to face Harry.
It must be a big case to require two fully-trained Aurors from the onset. The department was still rebuilding its numbers after the war, and Robards rarely over-allocated personnel for anything but raids.
Harry could barely hear Draco’s murmured chants over the rush of the shower, but he felt Draco’s pleasure building in the way his fingers tightened in Harry’s hair and his hips lost their perfect rhythm. Harry tasted Draco’s skin and the water and, finally, Draco’s release. He gripped Draco’s hips to hold him steady as Draco panted against the wall of the shower.
No. Harry could not work with Draco. He would stare and obsess and embarrass himself horribly. Luckily, he was pants at Potions and could use that as an excuse. It certainly sounded more professional than admitting he was fighting down a stiffy.
“The best chance of discovering who is behind this is to discover where.” Harry knew the farm had to be in Britain or Ireland. The wards along the Channel were too strong to Apparate through, and they only accept official Portkeys which landed in the Ministry for a bag and body scan.
Harry nearly walked into the entryway wall in surprise.  "You called me Harry."  It was a stupid thing to say, but Malfoy mercifully let it go.
Holding Potter open for him, Draco pressed a kiss to Potter's hole. He licked at the furled skin and managed to get the tip of his tongue in before the muscle grew tired. With all of the kissing, his tongue wasn't really up for a lot of piercing and licking. Maybe this sort of thing really did benefit from practice.
Draco smirked as he took Harry’s hand in his and pulled him away from the wall. “You can afford it.”
Nine o'clock found him already settled at his desk writing a report for Vane on the Curse he'd removed the day before.
“You’re still Potter when you’re being an arse.”  Draco crawled over to him and buried his head under Harry’s chin.  Harry could think of plenty of retorts, but instead he wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him flat against his chest.  It didn’t matter.  He had Draco now.
He was relieved to have escaped the Gryffindor common room as easily as he had. Ron’s exasperated sigh and Hermione’s knowing smile left him with no doubt they knew where he was going. Or at least who else was involved.
Draco couldn’t keep in the low chuckle. Merryn had told him all about Weasely’s eating habits in the autumn in a voice laced with awe. “That must be the flourless chocolate cake. Yes, we definitely still
Greece. Harry knew this because he always found himself collecting bits of information about Draco Malfoy. He had hoped his obsession would die off after the war, but he found himself at Draco’s trial testifying on his behalf. Even worse, after using Draco’s given name all through his testimony—the better to distance Draco from his father—Harry had found it impossible to go back. His brain simply supplied
Charlie clapped him on the shoulder and gave him a smile.  “Well I wish you both the best.”  Chuckling, he added, “Anything that improves that man’s mood is good for the whole team, so you’d better make him happy.”  The last was said with a sternness and glare that were undermined by Charlie’s toothy grin.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the thought of eating dinner before seven, but he couldn't deny his elation at the confirmation that Potter indeed remembered the night before and was still up for their dinner plans. Draco could always distract Potter for several hours until it was a civilised hour for dining.
Slowly, slowly, he pushed into Potter's heat. Potter was tense, but he didn't shout or freeze up completely. They were doing this. His cock was inside Potter's body.
Harry placed a finger to his own wet cheek and saw the grey eyes follow the movement intently.  Then he brought the finger, now wet with cum, to his lips.  He couldn't claim that semen was the tastiest thing he'd ever put in his mouth, but the thought that he was taking in Draco's own fluid made it erotic.  He licked his finger clean, watching Draco as Draco watched his tongue.  When their eyes met, Harry grinned at the disbelief and lust he saw in the large grey eyes in front of him.
It felt so good to finally have pressure squeezing around him as he pumped his own shaft. He wouldn’t last long, and he just hoped he didn’t dirty the jeans before he bought them. He imagined Malfoy would have something to say about that. He ended up coming on the rug and promptly fumbled for his wand to clean the mess. He couldn’t risk being banned from his new favourite shop.
Pansy's eyes softened and she placed a gentle hand on his. "I just don't want you to be disappointed if … your plan doesn't …"
Harry wasn’t sure what to make of that. He supposed Malfoy was entitled to think Harry was suspicious instead of curious, but it still made Harry’s heart feel heavy and tight. “I know. I just wanted to …” He shrugged. He didn’t know what he wanted, but the words that came to his lips rang true. “Join you.”
Potter's face danced through a series of subtle changes. There was the initial lift of the brow and then the slight twitch of the lip. Those intense green eyes wandered over Draco's face as if searching for some additional clue. The sound of laughter from other guests on the back lawn drifted over and reminded Draco that they were only superficially alone. He was about to make an excuse and leave—what had he been
Three Fire-calls later, the little cottage was bustling with caterers and deliveries, and Harry was grateful for Ron's assistance. By the time the guests began to arrive, Harry's rustic home looked like a French château and two caterers were carrying around trays of champagne and canapés. Harry knew it was still a far cry from the opulence of Malfoy Manor, but he hoped it would provide a taste of the sumptuous lifestyle Draco was giving up by living in a cottage without house-elves.
"You've made a mistake," Draco said through the heavy door that all but hummed with defensive magic. "No one arranged a fitting."
Draco’s face was suddenly unreadable. Damn it. Harry was just going to have to be brave and see what could come of it. Or deal with the fall out.
When Tom brought out their pies, Harry turned the conversation away from work and enjoyed more of Draco’s stories from his time in Greece. Apparently the local children had been taken with Draco’s hair, and Draco’s face lit up as he spoke of one tiny boy who insisted on petting his hair whenever they met. “Eventually I began wearing a hooded cloak despite the heat just to avoid collecting children like the Pied Piper.” He shook his head in a poor attempt at annoyance.
“That would be worth seeing.”  Draco went silent, scrutinising Harry with his clever grey eyes.  Harry admired the way they shone from beneath his neat, arched brow.  His features were so sharp and refined.
It didn’t help that Luna had all but adopted Draco and would occasionally bring him to Hogsmeade lunches at the Hog's Head where he quietly ate at her side. He didn’t say much, but his occasional smirk and raised brow showed that he was following the conversations around him and still had plenty of opinions.
“Tha—” His voice came out hoarse and cracked. He cleared it and drank more water. “Thank you.” It was little more than a whisper, but the smile Potter gave him was proof he’d heard. It was a ridiculous smile for such a small thing: so many teeth and crinkles around his eyes. Draco looked back to his sandwich. Cucumber. His favourite. He glanced over at Potter’s beef sandwich but didn’t comment. Perhaps the elf had remembered.
They had barely stopped spinning from Apparition when Draco attached his mouth to Harry’s neck. Draco had an evil tongue, which he pressed against Harry’s neck right at his pulse-point. Harry suddenly understood the lure of vampires as Draco dragged his teeth along his neck, raising goosebumps with his hot breath.
“That's right,” Blaise cooed.  He shifted Draco's weight to his left arm and began fumbling with Draco's robes with his right.  His hand reached Draco's trousers and began fumbling with the top button.  Was he seriously planning on fucking Draco right there?  Yes, Draco wanted to have sex—someday—but losing his virginity against the wall of a Ministry loo was not on .
Then Malfoy tugged again at Harry’s hair as he mumbled something incoherent and came down Harry’s throat. Harry sucked at him as he softened, marvelling at the way Malfoy barely kept his feet and shuffled closer to the wall. When he made a whine of protest, Harry released him to focus on his own needs. He pulled his jeans open and grabbed himself.
Draco nodded instead of replying and grabbed a sandwich to occupy his mouth. Potter passed him a glass of water which he drank without comment.
." Of course, she was happy; she had been proven right. "And I think Harry Potter is a fine young man."
Harry’s stomach clenched, and his skin felt tight and dirty. He looked again at the sweet young woman who must have no idea what her husband had been up to the night before. Where had she been while Draco—no,
Without the distraction of Draco’s welfare, and with four more Aurors, Harry found taking out the attackers laughably easy. He returned the way he’d come and distracted them as his team swept in and Stunned them from behind. In mere moments, the threat was removed.
Draco turned away from the kitchen just as a woman appeared in the doorway. Harry’s first thought was she had high cheekbones like Draco, which was an odd comparison as the two otherwise looked nothing alike. Harry had always thought of Draco as pointy and pale, while this woman’s features were rounded and her complexion dark. Her eyes were soft and warm, while Harry had always thought of Draco as having his father’s cold, unfeeling grey eyes. Although...when he thought about Draco laughing as they walked along the crag that morning, his eyes hadn’t seemed cold at all. More like the surface of the ocean, promising great depths beneath.
He wasn't really sure what to do, so he paired instinct with what he could remember Draco doing to him only moments before. It must have worked relatively well as Draco was moaning and trying his best to thrust his hips. Harry worried he would gag again or scrape his teeth on Draco's sensitive flesh, but despite his concerns, he thrilled at having Draco joined to him so intimately.
The snort and the sound of her body settling onto his upholstery showed that she still didn't listen to a thing he said. Bitch.
Harry and Draco had been dating quite seriously for over two months.  Despite all of the time they spent together, Harry found he still couldn't get enough of Draco's dry sense of humour, insightful comments, and firm arse.  And people had been surprisingly accepting of them as a couple.
Potter's face lit up. "I bought a cottage. My godfather had left me a place, but it was too creepy. I wanted some place I could make my own that had no bad memories."
Back at Hogwarts, Harry would have wanted to hit him for that, but over the past few weeks Draco's pretentious comments had ceased to nettle him. “Git,” he said and was horrified to realise it sounded rather fond.
He had originally made contact with Luna and her father as a political move to improve his reputation, but Luna had decided they were to be friends. Surprised to be offered an invitation by someone who wasn't Goyle or Pansy, Draco had actually found himself accepting offers of meals and walks in the countryside. His head often hurt after talking with her for too long, but he had the feeling it was somehow good for him.
"Are you really going to owl tomorrow?"  Harry had opened his mouth to thank Draco for the cheese covered cracker, but the question he had been biting back since they'd finished shagging slipped out instead.
Harry waved goodbye to Jens and dragged his tired body up the little dirt road to his building.  He bypassed the research centre and Charlie’s flat in favour of home sweet home.  After a week of travel, he just wanted to put his things away and fall into his own bed.
As soon she left, Potter pulled the tip of his wand from his sleeve and cast a silent spell. “For privacy,” he said, flicking his eyes to Gabby.
“It’s perfect,” Harry said without thinking. He hadn’t meant to get sentimental in front of Malfoy, but the bright, cosy room was so refreshing after too many years at Grimmauld Place.
“Oh, Draco,” he moaned as he fell deeper into his reverie.  “More!  Harder!”  The dildo sped up, slamming into him roughly.  He could picture Draco in his mind, staring at him with those sparkling eyes that burned like ice.  He imagined Draco moving over him, thrusting into him, moaning from that perfect pink mouth.  “Fuck!  Draco!”
“Well, no.  I was kind of hoping we could spend Christmas here.  With the Weasleys.”  Harry watched surprise, confusion, a hint of disgust, and more confusion cross Draco's face.
with them. It’s like they respect him as one of their own.” He leaned back in his chair and stretched his muscular legs in sharp contrast to the other three who sat leaning forward in their own chairs with their legs braced beneath them.
Toby assured him he knew the perfect place to “sort him out” and gestured across the road to where the battered old sign for the Leaky Cauldron was coming into view. Harry followed after him and was surprised when Toby walked past the Leaky and stopped at the next door.
It was several hours and many Muggle farms later when they saw the glimmer of magic around a decrepit barn. Harry had been on the verge of calling it for the day as the light was running low, but having seen the hint of a charm, he gestured for Malfoy to fly just above the ground with him. There was a hedgerow that ran along the farm, providing them with extra coverage as they approached the barn. It wasn’t until they were close that the illusion of the barn fell away and they saw a large greenhouse with two wind tunnels beside it.
“Looking for a place to nest,” Draco murmured.  “You can tell from the way she’s circling and the swell of her belly.”  Even Pavel looked impressed, and they all listened quietly as Draco told them what he knew of the Ridgeback.
“Why thank you, Calinda ,” he purred her name, “don't mind if I do.”  He took the forms and hurried back to his desk.  A minute later, each form was Charmed into a folded paper aeroplane and flying through the air.  He watched the Auror Request swoop down the hall before he headed out to enjoy a long lunch.
Harry chuckled.  “No.  They remember.  But they also moved on.  You’re not your father’s little clone or the Hogwarts bully anymore.  You’re Charlie’s brilliant apprentice and my boyfriend.  Those are people they want to meet and like.”  Draco looked unsure.  “Or we’re all barmy Gryffindors drunk on Christmas.  You prefer that explanation?”
Harry had searched most of London to find the antique emerald and diamond cuff links that sat neatly wrapped—by the shop assistant, of course—in his desk. He was certain they would go with the tie pin Narcissa had given Draco years before. He looked back into the flames and saw Ron rubbing his hands over his face. He was muttering something about people being clueless. Perhaps something had happened at the joke shop.
And this was where every discussion of Ron and Hermione’s holidays ended up. They would tell Harry how much fun they had and how much he would love it. Last time, it was the tropical island with amazingly soft sand and rare animals. The time before that, it was the charming old city with a library so impressive even Ron hadn’t wanted to leave. This time, Ron was rabbiting on about a chocolate cake that could lure Harry’s heart from treacle tart forever. His friends would do their best to sell him on a destination, and he would do his best to convince them he would consider it. But they all knew Harry didn’t holiday.
Kensa looked shocked, but rushed to correct him. “He’s a Death Eater! How could they go there? Sleep in his rooms...eat the food...my brother...no one would be safe!”
Draco was grateful Potter valued privacy as much as he did. He didn’t want to spend the rest of the meal watching his tone and carefully considering his every word in case it showed up out of context in an article. Not that the
Draco narrowed his eyes at the insult. He had other social commitments! He attended his mother's teas and occasionally he visited Goyle. Sure it had been a while since his last date, or even pull, but he was in no way pleased to have to spend so many nights with Harry bloody Potter.
observational skills at all, you’d be able to see that he’s completely arse over tit for Lovegood.”  He stormed off in the direction of the rest of their group, and Harry was sure the words muttered under his breath were nothing but insults about Harry.
“Your hair's soul mate, Potter?”  Potter looked confused for a moment before glancing back at the woman and laughing.
“I can’t study with you hacking away. Do us both a favour.” Draco was sure Potter could see through his attempt at disinterest, but he silently accepted the potion and water. The potion helped Potter through the evening until he started coughing up blood.
Potter sat up and called for Kreacher. Back to ignoring then. Draco let out a sigh of relief until he realized that Potter was staring at him again. The elf was, too. “What?” He managed to sound more curious than defensive.
They were listening to Charlie tell an exciting story about his narrow escape from a Horntail that winter, but Harry found his mind wandering as he gazed out over Ron and Hermione’s back garden.  He loved Charlie’s stories, but they also made him ache for the outdoors and adventure he had found surprisingly lacking in the Aurors.
They sent Kreacher to McGonagall with news that they had both fallen ill and recovered, but she was not moved to release them early. Two more days.
Despite his confidence in his cooking, Harry held his breath as Draco took the first bite, but the genuine smile on those perfect pink lips set him at ease. He barely tasted his own meal as he gave in to watching Draco eat his. It was hypnotic the way Draco carefully prepared each forkful of pasta and brought it to his mouth without a single drop of sauce falling. The way he then pulled the empty fork from between his lips with a small noise of approval went straight to Harry’s groin.
The thought of being able to stand up the most eligible bachelor in Britain gave Draco a rush of power he hadn't felt in years. He remembered the last time he'd had that feeling—fifth-year on the Inquisitorial Squad—and realised that his fifteen year old self would have made sure to break things off with Potter in the most humiliating and public way possible just to watch him suffer.
But if he were handsome, or even average looking, then why hadn’t a single bloke in the bar approached him?
The thought of Hermione giving grief made Harry laugh. 'Yeah, me too. She thinks we're having a secret romance.' He laughed again as he thought of all the times Hermione had insisted that she wouldn't mind and they needn't hide it from her. He looked up at Draco's stony expression.
A few times Draco caught sight of Vane walking around with some other trainee Aurors. Whenever she saw him, she leered and made rude gestures, but thankfully she kept her distance.
Harry turned to see Draco standing with blank shock as his eyes traveled between Kensa and Merryn. He blinked and seemed to come back to himself. He looked at Kensa and his face softened. “You don’t need to apologise. I made my own reputation and I have to deal with the consequences of that.” He glanced at Harry before returning to Kensa. “And I can relate to becoming a bit,” he shot another glance at Harry, “
Harry was about to say yes when he thought of Teddy.  He hadn’t seen the boy since the summer and hated the thought of spending the holidays without him.  “Let me think about it.”  He didn’t think to check Draco’s expression as he rushed to his room to find his mobile phone.
She was completely mental, of course, but Draco suspected she suffered from a naive acceptance of her father's tales. It was a failing he could admit, if only to himself, he shared.
Malfoy shrugged and gave him a small, slanted smile. "Paris was never forever. It was good to get away, but this is home."
Harry had to change the topic. Draco had lost all his warmth, and the connection they had been slowly building had all but vanished. “How did you get into cook—baking?”
Harry fled to the garden and was grateful for the cold air to clear his head. He found Parkinson alone on the back terrace clutching her purse and a flute of champagne. She was scowling at the sky as if the stars had affronted her.
Then Malfoy opened his mouth and found Harry’s tongue with his own. The kiss was warm, wet, and wonderful. Malfoy tasted like nothing but himself and Harry wanted to taste all of him. His hands were holding Malfoy’s face, and his tongue was in his mouth, and he didn’t think he could be any happier.
He was finishing preparing breakfast when strong arms wrapped around him and the smell of buttery toast was replaced with that of his own shampoo mixed with the unique scent of Harry.  He looked down at the sleeves around his waist.  “Yesterday's clothes, P—Harry?”  There was a squeeze and a kiss on his neck before Harry let go.
Draco let his eyes drift off to the side of the building where the rose garden was visible through a wrought iron gate. He remembered the first time he and Harry had walked through the garden when Harry had asked for a tour of the grounds. More recently, he remembered having tea at a small garden table as the smell of velvety petals accented the rosewater in the scones Draco had baked.
Potter tightened his hold on Draco as he spoke. "I'm supposed to be there for the opening ceremony, but then I'm free until our race. Do you . . . want to join me?" Draco's sleep-soaked mind struggled to make sense of the implications of that. "I can show you around the Muggle games. I've only been to one fair, and I really just watched, but I've seen a few in films and the like."
A knock on the door interrupted him. Harry waited for Robards’ usual rant at the expense of his assistant, but instead Robards called out a simple invitation to enter. The door opened and his assistant stuck his mousy face in the crack. “They’re here, sir.”
"You seem fairly certain that he'll be receptive to your advances." Pansy was looking at the sugar cubes she was adding to her tea, but Draco knew she was faking her nonchalance. She'd become almost as fond of discussing Potter as Draco was.
Despite his nerves, Harry's cock was hardening just from the intensity of Draco's leer. Why was he so nervous anyway? This was
"Can he cook?" Blaise boomed. "You haven't lived until you're had his pasta." Blaise led Draco forward with a firm hand on his back, and the Ginger Sea parted to let them through the door.
The Weasel stared at him and then gave a little nod. He dropped his napkin onto the table and rose to his full height. "C'mon, then. I'll show you your room." He looked Draco in the eye. "There's a spare bed. You're not to touch mine."
“I know that you will all miss me as I'll miss you.”  Clearwater was getting all misty and sentimental, throwing in metaphors about shepherding and family.  Draco would have found it easier to swallow all her rubbish about being a family if she'd ever looked after her department in the past.  “But, of course, I would never leave my little chicks all alone.  I can only leave because I know that you will be in the capable hands of one of our own.  After this week, Bernard Sothman will tend our flock.”
As before, Potter held Draco around the waist and Draco rested his arm across Potter's shoulders. "Go." They started with their bound legs, as they'd agreed worked best, and began walking at a casual pace. Their plan was to master walking before trying to run together.
“So you could just say that you’re glad that she’s alright.  That’s true enough, whatever the reason, and I think she’d be happy to hear that.”  Draco’s lips were pressed into a tight line, but Harry took the lack of argument as a good sign.
Harry laughed. It was too ridiculous—too adorable, really. Draco Malfoy: Defender of the undersquirrel. Harry didn’t think his cheeks could stretch any more, and his whole body felt light and warm. If talking to Malfoy made him feel like this, he never wanted to stop.
Harry wanted to kiss him, but he settled for resting a hand on Draco’s shoulder and feeling the heat coming off his body. "Dinner is perfect."
“But…” It was like he was trying to think of a reason to say no. Harry hoped he didn’t find one. “I’m using you to improve the hotel’s reputation!”
“The guests will start to arrive today. I imagine the bride and groom at least will be here by lunch.”
Vane sighed dramatically, again; it seemed to be her favourite means of breathing. "Sounds like heaven to me. The being tied to Harry part. I don't think I'd care about running once we were that close." Her eyes glazed over and Draco didn't want to consider what she was imagining.
Draco hated the thought of not being able to pop in on Pansy at any time. She was his best friend and sometimes he
“She’d want me to . . . at . . . where?”  Harry knew that Narcissa had been living with her cousin in Vienna for years, but he also knew that she still owned Malfoy Manor.
Draco took pity and raised a hand to silence him. "I figured you weren't homophobic after the Macmillan snogging incident." That lovely blush returned and Draco found it rather distracting.
Kauko goes to chop wood, and Mehiläinen stays with Aamu. He takes the seat she offers as she begins to make coffee, but he is clearly uncomfortable being idle while she works. She gestures for the cups and he jumps up to get three and bring them to the table. He needs purpose. He wants to help.
of your legs to one of his." She pressed her left leg to his right to demonstrate. "Thus creating three legs. You can run just fine so long as your strides are in sync. It takes lots of practice."
Draco had no opportunity to protest, even if he could have found the strength. He found himself surrounded by soft warm bedding that smelled of Potter. Why did he find that so comforting?
Seemingly not, given the way Malfoy dug his hands into Harry’s hair and brought them more firmly together. Harry was suddenly glad for his lack of hat. Cold ears was a small price to pay for the thrill of having Malfoy’s fingers threading through his hair.
Someone called Draco’s name, and when he turned he saw his mother in her room at the Manor. She was taking off her pearls and laying them into her jewelry box. She turned to him with a gentle smile that froze before she began screaming.
Once Iris had flown from view, Harry set about cleaning his cottage.  Whilst Draco had been there the night before, Harry could hope he hadn't seen the overflowing laundry hamper in the closet or the pile of dirty dishes in the sink.  And maybe the darkness had hidden the layers of dust in his sitting room.  He figured he could get a good two hours in before he'd need to shower and dress for lunch.
They ended up having a rushed breakfast at a café around the corner—with no mimosas but a decent cup of loose leaf Earl Grey—so they could make the opening ceremony on time. Draco wasn't sure when he'd been tricked into sitting through tedious speeches at Potter's side; perhaps Potter was more cunning than Draco had realised.
“Don't know how you boys managed it, but I don't think Substances has assigned us an advisor this quickly since Clearwater became Head.  Well done!”  A glance at Ron's wide eyes and limp jaw showed that he was as surprised as Harry was.  “Anyway,” Robards continued, “I hope Malfoy is more useful that the usual lot she sends us.”  He scowled.  “Can't be any worse.  I hope she falls into one of those damn canals.  Good riddance.”  He wandered off still murmuring to himself.
Still, if Pansy were right, it wouldn't be hard for Draco to bag Potter.  He didn't need the man to like him, just want him.  And surely Potter's Gryffindor chivalry would make him feel some noble need to protect and care for the man he was shagging.  Hadn't he tried to save Draco from harm earlier that same day?  And Draco wasn't even his lover yet!
Of course! Harry had been so worried about being inexperienced that he hadn't considered that Draco might be too. They were doing this together, both new and unsure. Harry rather liked that idea.
Harry didn't have the heart to tell her that he had meant to avoid Draco by choosing Herbology, so he simply made a vague comment about going with his stronger subject and then asked about dinner.
Aamu looks up and sees Suonetar rowing through the sky on her boat. Kauko has called her from the heavens. Aamu smiles, even as she sees Kauko crumple. He has done it. He has found his true strength.
“You're . . .” came Draco's raspy voice, although his face did not change from his expression of shock, “falling for me?  What do you mean, falling for me?”
He was a Malfoy; he should think big.  Who had real power?  The Minister was happily married, as was Head Auror Robards.  The Head of the DMLE would be perfect, but that came back to his refusal to shag a woman.  The obvious answer came up again and again, but he went through several options anyway.
Harry was starting to think he'd drunk a cauldron of Felix Felicis without realising it.  First Draco had sought him out to apologise for being rude, and then—instead of laughing at Harry's bumbling request for a date—the man had actually agreed to have dinner with him.  He had no idea why his mouth had gone and asked for a date without his permission, but he was delighted with the outcome.  Just the events of the morning alone had been enough to make it the best day he'd had all year.
"After the war, especially with Ron and me together, and then Ginny and Edwin, and Neville and Pansy … he was just so alone. We were worried about him."
"They're amazing." George was smiling as he gestured towards the apple. "I brought one back for you."
Aamu’s dreams have been of a girl in a village to the west. The girl has visions like Aamu, but she is young. She wants to help and cries when she cannot. She is suffering with her gift, but she has heard of Aamu now. She will come soon, and Aamu will be ready for her.
They had all worked very hard, and Draco and Hermione finished their efforts beautifully with their presentation to the witches and wizards that would either pass or reject D.U.M.B. Now there was nothing to do but wait, something Draco was absolutely rubbish at.
"Infiltration. Seduction is Phase Five, and I mustn't get ahead of myself." He pretended she cared as he finished his tea.
When she let him go, it was with an order to find Potter and make nice. Draco may have forgotten that Potter could make or break the hotel, but Merryn had not.
“That’s just envy talking,” Draco replied as he retrieved his book. He didn’t open it in time to hide the smile that curled his lips.
“I think I’ll be needing quite a lot of new clothes. Starting tomorrow.” Harry ignored Toby’s knowing smile and turned back to the Leaky. He had to Floo home and get some rest before his shopping trip in the morning.
He had no idea how much worse things would get. The year his father wasn't home because he was in Azkaban. The year he stayed at Hogwarts to try to fix the cabinet in a desperate attempt to save his parents' lives. The year the Carrows were at Hogwarts, but he had still wanted to stay there because it was far less terrifying than what was waiting for him back at the Manor.
Draco folded the paper and tossed it aside. 'No. The biggest stories are Oliver Wood's latest conquest and the release of a new Weird Sisters album.'
"—are men. Yes, I know. I'm not criticising. I'm saying that it might be your ticket in. Ginny's mother is teaching at Hogwarts this year and won't be back until June. Apparently they have been struggling in her absence. All the siblings are home—even the married one because his wife is in France with a sick grandparent—and none of them can cook."
“That's my shop next to the shed. I rent and sell brooms and the like. Across from me in the orange place is Roberto. He's your outfitter. He'll keep you from freezing up here in the winter. He lives above the shop and lets the second flat to a couple of your dragon folk. Not Charlie’s team.  The other one.  Okello’s.  You’ll meet them tonight.”  He continued to point out each building, explaining the shop on the ground floor—as there were no signs to be seen—and who lived on the floors above.  Harry just nodded with no hope of retaining so much information.
With Potter, much like Abbott, it started with an occasional clearing of the throat as Potter sat on the sofa in their sitting room. Draco, perched at the table with his Charms essay, didn’t notice at first. After all, he had spent every moment since they arrived practicing ignoring Potter.
“So, um . . . where do I sleep?” Harry felt it was best to stick to the basics. Draco watched him a moment more before he turned sharply and walked away.  Following him, Harry barely noticed the living room, with its fireplace and two small couches, as he stared at the way Malfoy’s trousers clung to his pert arse. Forcing his eyes up, he became mesmerised by the contrast between Malfoy’s light, silky hair and the dark leather cord that bound it. This was not a good start.
Harry laughed and pulled Malfoy to his chest. Malfoy felt right in that space. The curve of his lips pressed into Harry’s throat and his arms wrapped loosely around Harry’s shoulders. He knew watching would never be enough again. He wanted what they had shared this morning: walking side by side, talking and teasing, working as one, and the touching. So much more touching.
He glanced around the cluster of Curse-Breaker desks and saw that the two Curse-Breakers present hadn't looked up from their texts. He felt a sudden fondness for his colleagues who were professional enough to mind their own business. If
An advantage of working with his best mate was that Harry could combine a briefing with dinner. He Flooed into Ron and Hermione’s cottage to find Hermione curled up in an oversized armchair with a large tome on her lap.
Draco suddenly looked quite bored, but Harry had a feeling it wasn't genuine.  “I was planning to visit my mother in Vienna.  She has a lot of tiresome parties planned, but I suspect I'll find ways to entertain myself.”
"It’s just tradition. No one ever told me why. They just laid down the law and expected perfect compliance.”
Potter got out of bed and stretched in full naked glory. "Breakfast tea from a bag or we can go out. But if I'm buying you breakfast I want a promise that you'll go to the fair with me." Potter turned to face him and his eyes held equal parts challenge and mirth.
Having surrendered the bathroom to Potter and put on clean robes, Draco found himself momentarily at a loss for what to do next. It would have been nice to contact his own friends, but Draco couldn't cast a Patronus—not that he would admit that to Potter—and he didn't think the elves were likely to fetch his owl or deliver messages for him. For Potter, they would be delighted, but not for Draco.
Kauko is tired and the words are slipping away. He is almost overcome when he reaches out and takes Mehiläinen’s hand. Then he uses their power and calls out to Suonetar. There is begging in his voice and strength by his side. He pours himself into his magic and his call, Mehiläinen like an anchor holding him to the earth.
She explained that it was a room for two and walked Potter and him over to the stairs. As they headed to the room, Draco briefly wondered if that meant two beds or just a large one. He was
after the War, Harry still found it hard to hear any sort of compliment about his abilities, even from his friends.
Properly equipped, he stripped down and climbed onto his bed.  He poured lube into his hand and rubbed it over the dildo and between the globes of his arse.  Finding his entrance with his own finger, he took a deep breath and pushed inside.  As he relaxed into a rhythm, he closed his eyes and searched his mind for images.
In the end he sent a note back saying to wear Muggle attire.  He wanted to make this work, and that meant being honest about what he wanted.  And what he wanted was to share his favourite restaurant with Draco.  It was just a tavern in a small village near the Welsh border, but the food was incredible and he'd come to know Rosie, who ran the place.  He usually went there alone to enjoy the anonymity, but he had taken each of his closest friends there in the two years since he'd found the place on an Auror mission.
"You've never considered this, have you?" Potter had the decency to look sheepish. "This isn't fourth-year, Potter, and Robards is not the Goblet of Fire. You can simply say that you are flattered but respectfully decline. Or if you really want to be clever about it, you'd put someone else in his mind before he even asks you."
They stayed there, frozen, as Harry focused on breathing and willing himself calm.  Slowly his body relaxed and welcomed the foreign object inside him.  And then Draco
Once Potter was moaning and squirming again, Draco slid the first finger inside. It was easier this time and he was thrilled that Potter didn't go limp in his mouth. When one finger was moving with ease, he added a second and then a third.
Harry turned back to Charlie in time to catch that the ruddy-faced man next to him, Dave, was the final member of their team.  From his accent, Harry assumed Dave was American.
“I think about you all day and then I Floo to your house and love the fact that you allow me in at all , let alone when you're not there.  I browse your books and your photos and try to glean little details about you from where you live because I can't know enough about you.  Fuck, Draco.  I'm completely smitten and falling for you, and you’re not sure if you consider yourself my boyfriend?”
