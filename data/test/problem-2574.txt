Potter winked and turned to the door. The space he left behind was cold, and Draco felt so empty.
“I like it when you talk to me.”
Ron pulled a face. “Urgh. Yuck.”
Hope kindled low in his belly, unfamiliar, and he wracked his brain to think of a way they could all escape.
want?” Potter asked drily.
“He said he didn’t want to be with you anymore?” Ron’s voice is gentle and soothing, full of the pain that he feels for his best friend.
But he held back, which was also nothing new. It hurt him like a physical ache somewhere in his chest, he wanted Draco so badly. But if anyone had asked him ‘is it difficult? Are you struggling?’ the answer would have been simple: no. Never.
, and you won’t even do that.”
“There you are,” he said softly.
The words were barely more than a whisper, but Blaise heard them all the same. He smiled, radiant and warm, and the moment faded away.
Once or twice, Malfoy’s forehead drew together, and he would grab Harry with his free hand and guide him slower, softer, while the hand that gripped Harry’s cock mirrored those same movements. It was almost too much, when he did that, like they were sharing something more than just a convenient release. Harry wanted more of it. He wanted Malfoy to feel comfortable enough to show Harry everything that brought him pleasure, and then he wanted to do just that.
any vulnerabilities—but don’t tell her I said that!
walked into?
She nodded at that, taking in the words and just absorbing them without commentary. For half a second, Draco had fallen in love with her, just for the simple reason that she had been given the opportunity to weigh in on his life choices and had chosen not to.
He turned swiftly away, lest Potter think he wasn’t still furious with him, and walked into the kitchen in search of coffee and potions.
“My magic.” Harry laughed in delight as the flame receded. “It feels like mine again.”
Calm.
“Yes, Master Draco?” He bobbed on his toes, waiting for direction.
“Is this good?” His fingers drifted lower, tracing a line down between Draco’s thighs.
“Because I don’t know what’s Fate, and what’s me.” Potter understood him anyway. “I need to know it’s my choice. Everyone keeps making choices for me, and I need this one to be mine.”
“There’s a hidden balcony up the stairs and down the end of the corridor,” he whispered, hating himself with every word he spoke. “I’ll meet you there in two minutes.”
“It wasn’t at all like I expected,” Malfoy said carefully. “Obviously, you need some work. I had to adjust your technique several times.”
“We need to get a message to the Healers,” Draco insisted, looking around for someone he could accost. “He’s probably been overexposed.”
Draco blinked. What was happening here? Potter had given a performance so realistic that even Draco had doubts it had been faked, and now he was saying it was nothing more than a joke? Even without the fact that Draco had come home to find him looking as though he was about to pass out, it didn’t add up.
Granger stuck her head around the corner and waved at him. “I thought I heard your voice, Draco! Did Harry tell you we were here?”
Adrenaline overtook Draco’s confusion, and he laughed, breaking into a run before he’d even agreed. Potter easily caught up to him, and they raced side by side, their lingering tears burning away in the wind, gasps of exhilaration and pain and grief turning into laughter as tiredness crashed into them and they fell upon the sand at the base of the finish line.
Evie shot him a grateful smile. “Maybe. We’re just glad something like this exists. At least if the worst happens, she can still go for a fly with her sister.”
Something chimed like a bell, and Potter looked down at the device on his wrist. Whatever he saw there, it made him flinch and recoil, the expression on his face shifting back into that anger from before. Only this time, it came with some inner conflict—sick and wretched. Draco wondered how he could read Potter so well, but before he could question himself, it was gone.
He said his goodbyes, ignoring the way Granger studied him, the shrewdness to her gaze. He didn’t have time to dissect it, didn’t even have the energy to begin. He had a meeting to get to, and then, tonight, he had a party.
“So we need to keep this natural,” Draco reiterated, thankful that his rapidly beating heart was somehow remaining inaudible. “Believable. We need to convince the world that we somehow fit together so perfectly, so inexplicably, that they can’t believe they never saw it before.”
Draco froze. Surely, this was a trick. If he’d been George Weasley, he would have suspected Draco of being
Harry
Malfoy’s tone was so flat, Harry actually looked up at him. “Sorry, no… Sunlight cleanses the air. Only works on airborne curses.”
Draco fought to keep his expression neutral. “This has nothing to do with the bet,” he said carefully.
Thanks, Ron.
They stared at one another, the flickering fluorescent lights of the hospital room giving everything a surreal sensation that Draco couldn’t seem to shake. It was like watching something from under water, or coming off a sedative after surgery. He ached to reach for Potter, to climb into the bed with him and just hold him, but he couldn’t. They didn’t have that sort of relationship.
“If you’re going back, I’ll leave as well,” Harry admits. “I think it’s time I accepted this is just my life. It’s only taken me twenty years.”
“Unspeakable business?”
Draco looked him in the eye, swallowed once, and nodded. Harry started to push in.
It was the sweetest sound Harry had ever heard.
Harry supposed that once you’d held another man’s prick in your hand, you couldn’t just go back to a business-as-usual mentality. At least, he couldn’t. It wouldn’t feel right to just ignore Malfoy’s existence after this—not that he wanted to.
The boy—Kalen, Draco presumed—gaped in horror, and then closed his eyes and froze. Draco glanced at Morgan, who was looking between them all in shock.
“Of course,” he said lightly.
? You know I was only joking the other day when I mentioned you together. This is a bit far to take for a joke, mate.”
Irritation spiked, and Draco straightened up with a jolt. “And killing a Dark Lord doesn’t mean you get to play judge, jury, and executioner.” No, apparently that was Draco’s job, which only pissed him off more. “Who are you to question what Fate deems adequate?”
“We can’t be late,” Draco insisted, trying to step back but succeeding only in slipping his fingers beneath Harry’s waistband.
Harry stared at Professor Staltwort in horror. He had thought they were done with all of the ridiculous introductions and inane ice breakers. Apparently not. Apparently, moving onto the fieldwork part of the course and partnering up with someone meant a whole new kind of hell.
got out.
He didn’t know how many times they had done this now, exploring each other’s bodies and finding new ways to bring each other pleasure. The sensation of those first few times—the disbelief, the addictive high—had eventually faded, but it had been replaced by something better. He knew Harry’s body as well as he knew his own now, knew a hundred different ways to make him gasp and cry out in ecstasy, and every time he touched him, kissed him, held him, it felt like coming home.
Malfoy smiled slightly, very nearly imperceptibly. “No,” he said, then, deliberately, “Harry.”
“Merlin,” Harry whispered, already well on his way to half hard even though they’d barely even begun.
“A miniature one!” She clarified. “And modified to sing a terribly rowdy version of God Save the Queen as it went.” She gave an affected sigh. “My brother likes to tinker.”
Anthony Goldstein, with his trousers around his ankles, and a semi-naked lady friend had somehow ended up against a wall and were just about to get on with it. It looked like they would have, too, had Harry not stumbled upon them.
His heart thumped in his chest, making him feel light-headed. He couldn’t believe he was actually asking this, saying the words out loud.
With a small pop, two mediwizards Apparated in, and Potter visibly relaxed.
“And it’s hard not to—” He broke off immediately and shook his head, cheeks colouring a little beneath the moonlight. “Never mind.”
“I guess the curse won’t let you leave.”
They were going to talk about it now, it seemed. Thoughts raced through Harry’s head. What did Malfoy want him to say? What
Potter gave him a small smile, something hidden in it that Draco didn’t know how to read, and before he could think it through, he asked, “Has the curse made you remember me as well?”
“Does that take time?”
Then, slowly, never taking his eyes from Harry’s, Malfoy lowers his mouth and slides his lips, centimetre by glorious centimetre, back down Harry’s cock.
“Work with you on
“Why are you so certain it won’t work? We haven’t even begun.”
“The box?” Potter frowned, and Draco remembered that they hadn’t had a chance to discuss that nature of the package.
Potter’s breath was ragged. “You’re not going to defend yourself?” The words sounded almost like a plea.
“Please,” he moaned. “Harder.”
Harry supposes he’s not really one to talk; he couldn’t even wait until he was inside before he ate his own.
His voice came out softer than usual, tinged with empathy rather than the cutting edge of pity. Something warm kindled in Draco’s chest, and he changed the subject before he could be foolish enough to enjoy it.
George waved a hand in the air before slinging his arm over Kalen’s shoulder and steering him away.
Draco felt his knees give a little at the knowledge that they had done it, they had achieved something that was not only unusual in current theory, but that had quite possibly saved a life. Potter made a small noise beside him, but Draco politely ignored it.
Where am I going next?
Fortunately, whatever malady Potter was suffering responded well to the gentle tincture made from helichrysum and asphodel, and Draco made a mental note that the herbs worked on humans as well as peafowl. That was good. He didn’t want to be labelled responsible for poisoning as well as whatever had sent Potter to his door in the first place.
He didn’t really mean it. It hadn’t been her responsibility to stop him, and he wouldn’t have stopped even if she’d tried.
Draco’s stomach did that funny thing again, and he covered it by swallowing half his drink in one go. “Right. I guess we’d better start planning, then.”
“That symbol was etched into it as a kind of repellent to the Fae. They can’t pass through doors where it’s written, or hold objects that are etched with it, which is why the witch carved it into the wand when she stole it. They tricked the step-daughter into scratching it against her thorns while she was an enchanted rose and stole it then, condemning her to live out her days trapped there while her lover married someone else. Of course, the enchantment was broken and she won back her beloved Roland, but I’ll never forget the faces of the Fair Folk in the story as they taunted her and stole back the wand she’d tried to hide from them.”
“I don’t know,” Pansy hissed. “I don’t— Potter, can you hear me?
“Kalen, just open the box. You’re not in trouble.” Potter flicked his wand and the ropes disappeared.
He wondered whether to tell Potter what his friends had said about him but decided against it. There was a tiny part of him that urged caution right now. Something wasn’t right, and it was never smart to reveal one’s hand too early.
“I don’t really know,” he said truthfully. “I just… we’re both… I don’t know. It’s kind of embarrassing to admit we’re still virgins at this age and with
Draco gritted his teeth together, furious that he hadn’t figured that out himself. “Words, feathers, blood—this curse is getting awfully fucking complicated.”
“’Cept Malfoy’s,” Ron said with a grin once everyone had tossed back the shots, the liquor burning warm in Harry’s stomach. “I reckon you could do with a bit of dragonpox.”
Even with the cloud that had settled over him, Potter’s eyes were suddenly filled with heat. Draco shifted back a little more, unsettled at the way Potter seemed to be straddling a knife’s edge tonight. On one side was the familiar darkness; on the other, there appeared to be heat—intoxicating sensation. Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to follow Potter down either path.
Harry huffed a laugh, slightly offended, but before he could say anything, Malfoy suddenly put down the quill and turned to face Harry properly.
Draco blustered indignantly. “I was
“What, exactly, are you saying, Potter?”
“I’m only telling you what I see. I might be wrong, I might be right. I’m only telling you because I wouldn’t be any kind of friend if I didn’t.”
‘Longbottom, Neville”, she said.
Draco stays in the room for ten more minutes after Severus left him alone, trying to compose himself. He then stood up with the new book in his hand and walked out of the room to the Great Hall to make his growling stomach to shut up.
‘When I heard from Narcissa that he dropped you off at her without a second thought, I was furious with him that I wish he was the one that was killed instead of her. The more you grow up, the more you resembled him. I tried to hate you because of him but how could I hate you when there’s a part of her in you too.’
“I love you mom and I wish you could be here with me. Watching me as I grow up year by year.”, whispered Draco as an unshed tears blurred his vision.
Both Hermione and him looked at their significant others and rolled their eyes at their husband’s antics.
“Mr Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,’ said Mr Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted- and young Master and young Mistress Malfoy, too- charmed.”
“I’ll take this off, okay,” asking his permission to take off Draco’s skirt.
“She’s been distant with me for awhile now, I don’t even know why,” Iris huffed, her finger playing with the corner of the page, getting a disapproving sound from Hermione when she folded the page corner and smacked her hand away to not further the damage.
Draco was looking at Severus for a few seconds before his eyes perked a little up at Quirrell.
Potter fell to his knees, he for sure are going to die, it’s either stay with Potter or leave Potter be and run for his life, but he couldn’t do that to him, it was unfair.
He don’t know why he still got scared although he knows Jamie are going to be there, he gave a little gasped. Draco gave his son a stern look but he was still unfazed by it, instead he ordered him to pick him up.
Harry brought their hands to his lips and kissed the back of Draco’s hand and kissed each of his knuckles, he lingered on his ring finger, the ring he put it on two years after their graduation.
“I’m going to tell your sister about it”, said the muggleborn. Did this bitch just blackmailed him using his sister?
What does the centaur mean? Don’t let vengeance consume him? And the statement he gave on Potter, what does that mean?
She taught him how to record and how to take photos. The camera has a lot of button. At first it was hard to remember which button to press for recording and which button for taking photos but after a while, he brilliantly knows how to function it well.
Pansy set her phone against the window again, pressing the button and waiting for the timer to went off. When it was Draco’s turn, he goes all out.
“I love you, you know. Although I’m 35 years old and you are 16 which is a huge age gap, I do love you. I don’t say it under the influence of lust, I say it because I do.” Confessed Harry honestly to Draco. He doesn’t want Draco to doubt his love for him.
But what is the point, the old man is dead regardless of anything, she’s not a Necromancer to bring the dead back to life just to take out her anger on him. Each thought overlapped with a new one, creating a nonexistent problem to disturb her brain.
By the way, he got another whacked in the head from Pansy because he had been using her binocular for a long time that she missed when Potter caught the Snitch.
The cold air from the air conditioner hit Draco’s entire body.
He sat up, back rested against the headboard. He looks at his five-year-old son, whose hand is slowly trailing up his stomach, lovingly looking at his mummy’s stomach, impatiently waiting for his unborn sister to come out of his belly already.
Narcissa reads the news and after she finishes reading, she hides it at the very bottom of her drawer, away from everyone.
“So I heard that you are trying to get your first kiss this year?”, asked Draco as he looked behind Blaise, at Potter and the Weasley’s. His leaned his body, his elbows are laid on top of the counter as he was talking to Blaise while Pansy are helping Cassie with whatever she needs.
‘Stop stop, if someone finds out, we would all get in trouble,’ said Granger as she stepped forward.
They were having a conversation while they are working on brewing the potion. Since the potion doesn’t last longer than five minutes, they were easier to brew than the actually love potion because they have to wait for nine days if brewing the proper love potion.
Suddenly, his big hands went to his waist and peel off his booty short he was wearing. Now, he was fully naked from his head to his toe.
“You will get it when you’re older.”
On second thought, maybe he shouldn’t added that sentence because the colour on their faces are draining and Draco’s feet got stomped by Cassie’s and it hurts really badly that he shrieked under his breath.
“Yeah, I went to your parents house and politely asked if she could cook for us.” said Harry as he was rubbing his neck shyly.
With the last touch on the bow, he was ready to work, he checked himself in the mirror, patting his maroon button-up long sleeve shirt, smoothing it so it doesn’t crease. His shirt was tucked inside the black pants he was wearing.
When he was ready, he waited for Harry outside of his room. Harry come out wearing a clean school uniforms.
“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”
Draco shrieked as he arched his body, rubbing his length with Harry’s through the jeans.
Severus released him from the hug and reached inside his pocket and enlarged the wrapped up Christmas present, he then handed it to Draco.
‘I thought I was Harry last time’, said Harry as he quirked one eyebrow up.
The centaur pulled Potter and him up to their feet and ask them if they were alright, Potter replied but Draco keep silent because he was still in shocked.
Jamie stopped crying and he looked up into his father’s emerald eyes, waiting for an answer. “Because he loves you so much that he’s sad that you are not talking to him,” continued Harry, picking Jamie up into his arms.
Harry came up to Draco and curled his body around him, protecting him, simultaneously licking his fur, cleaning the dirt on his white fur when he tackled him to the ground just now. It’s his fault and him being a good Alpha and a good husband, he would gladly lick every single surface of Draco.
At one point, Celestial realised that her eyes were wet with tears without her permission, she quickly wiped it away before she saw it but she’s already inches closer to Celestial, pushing her head and resting it against her shoulder.
“It was a disrespect to your own kind and I was fine anyways, just let Potter get on your back because I think his head are still dizzy”, said Draco honestly.
Before Draco gets to peek inside the room, an unknown hand pulls him inside, his body was crashed with another body with Blaise followed by.
He guided his hand to Draco’s cheek to his dark circles, tenderly stroking the puffy blackish eye bags.
Draco was whining, his hands are tugging Harry’s hair into his breasts, planting his face onto Draco’s. The areola are turning reddish from the intense sucking of Harry’s mouth.
Harry was looking at them with amused so he decided to kiss his cute boyfriend on the mouth, Draco took it without protest and sighs into the kiss.
Murmurs broke around the hall as more of the Gryffindors students walks in, Draco was peaking his head up, hoping to see the black haired Chosen One wearing one of the houses colour.
“Okay,” his voice hoarse, for not speaking for a while. Nodding his head, as Harry plays with his hair, adoringly bends his head, giving Draco’s forehead a kiss.
Draco was at the kitchen most of the time with Blaise and Pansy, Cassie was somewhere in the ballroom with Daphne Greengrass and her younger sister, Astoria.
smirked Pansy at him.
“My beautiful baby Cory,” whispered Draco against his son’s fragile cheek.
He has no time to remember their first name, besides they’re a Gryffindor and he ain’t going to waste his precious time on Gryffindors.
‘I told you to be careful, Potter’, said Draco as he spelled Potter’s fingers clean with a cleaning spell. ‘Can believe the boy who lived screeching over a cut finger, You-Know-Who would be rolling in his grave right now’, he mumbled as he examined Potter’s finger again so that he doesn’t miss anything.
Pansy was already there waiting for him when he stepped inside the common room wearing HIS clothes he might add.
“Sorry? You just- I don’t mean to- Wait, I don’t mean to judge you. I’m so sorry if I’m making you uncomfortable, wasn’t my intention,” he apologised before they got on the wrong foot.
“Don’t be dramatic”, whispered Draco in her ears. Cassie gave her a nasty look, suddenly she pulled her hand back. “How about I turn the knob and you walk in?”, said Cassie intelligently as she cocked her head to the side and looked at him straight in the eye.
“So - I -,” suddenly it was hard for her to speak.
“Not trying to be a snooper or anything but are you having a fight with your boyfriend?”
As he was walking back and forth in front of a bare wall, thinking of a way of getting out, an oak door that reach until the ceiling suddenly appeared in front of him, he quickly rushed inside without thinking of the consequences.
The moon was bright in the dark sky but the clouds surrounds it, giving an effect of cold darkness.
His first crush. His dream man or whatsoever his eleven years old mind tells him years ago. He cringed at himself when he remembered how huge of a crush he had on their first son, Harry.
Mother says that it has something to do with Father.
Harry thrust his cock until the hilt, his hung balls hit Draco’s arse tirelessly, he then pulled out slowly, only leaving the tip of the head, and thrust back in intensely aiming for his prostate for the hundreds of time on the second round, his phone fluttering closer, self taking photo’s mode on while the phone was recording. Harry leaves kisses on Draco’s collarbone and shoulders, biting into the soft flesh.
“NO MAMA, JAMIE WANT THIS!”, screamed Jamie, the tantrum episode has finally begin, stomping his small feet to the ground, protesting the idea of the clothes. He finally gave in when he saw a fat tears coming out of his eyes. He could never win against his son and to think that they are going to have two more in two and a half months is terrifying.
He wanted to ask Lyra but he didn't want to raise suspicion.
“Hello, Scorpius. I’m your mama, “ greeted Draco as he did with Adrian minutes before, when he was in his arms. He got the information that the twins were fifteen minutes apart.
At the same time, Draco answered, “Sure, professor,” while he was thinking why Harry wanted to see him. Last night memories are still fresh in his mind, they’ve been going on for round after round until seven o’clock in the morning. Harry even told him that he can be excused from attending the morning lessons but he refused.
There was a yell of ‘Get him, Dad!’; Mrs Weasley was shrieking ‘No, Arthur, no! ; ‘Gentlemen, please - please!’ cried the assistant. Draco wanted to get far away from the scene without anyone noticing, when he remembered something, he has perfecting his disillusionment charm, he casts it over him and Cassie.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr Borkin, abandoning his conversation with father and his lists, scurrying over to Draco. “Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.”
That’s when Draco realized, Dobby was afraid. He did something wrong and he was afraid of the consequence, so that’s why he punished himself before father did so father wouldn’t notice.
“Don’t care. Only want Daddy, no one else matters.” said Draco softly.
The room looks like it was used specially to put old and used object but there’s an object that he feels doesn’t belong there.
Harry’s finger makes him turn his head back to Harry, suddenly his lips are attacked by Harry’s. His lips consumed his soul and at every moment he didn't care if the weather was cold or not. He wants Harry’s cock in him before he gets mad from the temptation but he got cut off again by Harry.
“Later, we have to eat first before the food gets cold.” pulling both of them off from the kiss, Draco wanted more and leaned into Harry but Harry just gave him one last chaste kiss before reminding Draco again about the food.
Ten years old Draco was celebrating his birthday in the hall of the Manor. The hall was decorated with balloons and colourful banners. On the table, there is a cake. Mother invites a lot of people from the pureblood families, he was wearing a fancy suit that makes him uncomfortable but for the sake of his mothers happiness, he didn’t complain.
He nudged him and looked at his face, “I know because I was the one who saw his face when the twins needed more of your attention, he thinks that you shifted your love for him to the twins and the only way he dealt with it is being stubborn and kept his silence.”
He doesn’t need the healer stupid confirmation to know that he was in labor but he doesn’t say anything because he was seriously in pain, his body produce a lot of sweat.
Draco already has someone.
“But you already wore those clothes the last time we went out? Why don’t you wear a new one?”, asked Draco as he slowly trying pull Jamie closer to him so he could put the shirt on without Jamie noticing his action.
Few hours later, he was woken up by a clicking sound of a camera and the flashing lights. He slowly opened his eyes and scanned his room to find the intruder who interrupted his beauty sleep but he saw no one.
Sometimes, he can’t believe that Regulus is already five, almost six. He still remembers the day he was born. One day, he will take his dad’s place as a leader of the pack, if everything goes well.
“Are we going to stargaze?” guess Draco out of excitement. Draco once told him before that he was always fascinated with stars and moons, he even wrote in his bucket list that he wanted to lay on the grass and stargaze with someone special.
The interior of the house could be described as cozy, inviting and warm. It brings a new light to The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. There could be seen photographs of three smiling residents hanging on the wall and a huge photo frame of four men and two women, each one of the women cradling their baby to their chest.
“I hate it too,” cupping his mouth to his son’s ear and whispered it playfully so Draco couldn’t hear their conversation and Draco was busy trying to pick the most freshest on display. He heard them snickered and looked up from his concentration, “What are you laughing at?” asked Draco curiously, eyes searching for any mischief.
“I’m going to slam the door so hard on your face until you can’t feel it for days.”
“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that. No Malfoy’s worth listenin’ ter. Bad blood, that’s what it is.”
“So you are saying that you and her were just friends since the middle of September? Like just friends?”
“You smoke?” With the cigarette on her waiting hand, she took it and put it between her lips waiting for Celestial to help her light it up.
When all of them are done, Harry levitate the dirty plates to the kitchen sink, Draco was getting up from his chair slowly, although he was only six months pregnant, his pregnant belly are huge and he was getting slower and slower day by day.
‘How in the bloody hell did you know that,’ he questioned the hat.
After felt like an hour, he pulled back his hand that was left hanging and turned his head towards Cassie, “Take your trunk out, let just go find new compartment, we are not welcome here.”
Dumbledore clapped his hands and the banner changed into Gryffindor red. Moral of the story is to not celebrate early, now they have to endure the humiliation.
The first thing that caught Draco’s eyes is the boy’s eyes, he had the most mesmerizing green eyes he had ever seen, it was emerald, vivid and intense. He could see his green eyes sparkle under the light, like a green gemstones, while the boy was staring at him hesitantly.
“That’s what you get for scaring me in Knockturn Alley,” bragged Cassie but she held out her hands and took some books from his hands. They both walked to the counter with Pansy and Blaise trailing behind them.
With pen and notepad in his hands, he walked over to where his damnation would start.
At some point, they were playing tugs, but by the looks of it, Harry is going to win with one arm while the other is safely tucked beneath his arm. Draco was too weak despite using both of his hands. It must be the lack of energy.
When he opened the door, he was greeted by children his age, Father always told Cassie and him to have some allies not friends because to Father, friends will bring them nothing, Draco did make a few allies and some friends, his sister and him both share the same companions.
“I’m not trying to be rude or anything but can I have your number?” said the stranger again. In his heart, Draco thinks that this stranger couldn’t take a memo because he have no interest on having a conversation with a total stranger.
They quickly walked out of the room with style because Malfoy don’t jog around. The Malfoy Manor was so huge that it took them ten minutes to arrive in front of father’s study room.
“So, I guess. I better get going.”
Did Harry just say his mother’s homemade food? Mother hardly cooks food for him, it was usually the maid, before he moved out of the mansion into his and Harry’s shared home but when she did cook for him, he was addicted.
“A day?” Granger snorted.
Draco only got angry when things were personal, which meant that Pansy wouldn’t have a reason to think that he was trying to fool her. After all, this wasn’t meant to be personal, was it? It was just a stupid little bet. Which left the question—why was he so angry?
Nonetheless, he was forced to agree. They had to do something, and the available options seemed fewer each time.
“What time is it?” he asked, his mouth dry as paper.
Neville snorted, covering his mouth and trying to pretend he hadn’t. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “Sh’kinda funny. Lil’.. lil’ bit.”
Something twisted and clenched in Draco’s chest, but he shoved it far, far down.
Draco was working his way through his neglected pile of correspondence, when Potter showed up in his fireplace.
Harry
“You mean we should have anticipated kids making stupid decisions?”
“Okay,” he repeated, and turned to face Malfoy more fully. “I guess we just… do this. Right now.”
Penned at the top of each checklist was a note Draco had only ever skimmed before. It had become part of the scenery—irrelevant to the young Veela descendant who cared only for what might happen to him now. The future was irrelevant.
blood curse, Malfoy. Here, listen.
“Whose fate do you think we’re choosing?” he asked lightly, watching the sand fall and thinking of the final line in Potter’s prophecy. He answered without waiting for Potter. “I think it’s our own. And each other’s. And a million other entwined fates, always… Our fates are always wrapped up in someone else’s, even if we wish we could deal with them alone.” He sighed. “Do you think I’m weak, Harry, if I accept your apology just like that?”
A faint pink tinge rose on Malfoy’s cheeks, and he exhaled in a rush, the corners of his mouth lifting into a fraction of a smile. “I must confess,” he said drily. “My adrenaline is kicking in and my first impulse is to insult you. Can I make fun of your hair a little? It will make me feel better.”
“Thank you for coming so quickly,” she said, guiding him without touch to the head table.
The next thing he knows, something light touches his wrists and ankles. He laughs for a moment, wondering if Draco has decided to explore something with feathers—he wouldn’t mind that at all—and then the thing draws tight, and his whole body goes stiff.
Potter made a small sound in the back of his throat, and Draco was absurdly proud his own voice had remained steady.
“Malfoy,” he said after they were well down the path into the Forest. “Are you going to stop sulking?”
With a little surge of Gryffindor bravery, he leaned up and kissed him. He felt Malfoy give a small jolt of surprise, and then his arms were coming around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer. Their lips parted, and Harry felt a rush of something in his chest, perhaps surprise that they had gotten this far without hexing each other. Whatever it was, it was warm and bright, and he was delighted that his madness had led them here, to this moment.
Dear Harry,
An owl swooped through an open window and dropped a letter from his mother. The penmanship was hastily written, far hastier than Narcissa Malfoy would ever write a death notice, far too full of excitement and disbelief. Draco smiled, knowing the contents without needing to open them.
Blaise’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re kidding me.” He turned to Potter. “Shouldn’t you know better? You’re an Unspeakable, aren’t you?”
“I was a very creative child, Harry. I don’t like that tone.”
Harry’s stomach gave a pleasant little flip that had nothing to do with how good his lower half felt, and everything to do with the feel of Malfoy’s cheek pressed against his bicep. He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to regain control, and before he had managed to open them again he felt a light touch circling his hip, questioning.
“I don’t understand it,” he said instead, after he’d sucked in a lungfull of air and counted to ten slowly. “How the hell do people have the energy for sex? I’m run bloody ragged just with my seminars and lectures, and we haven’t even
Most Charming Smile award again, did you, and now you’re trying to save face?”
The way he rolled the word tremor over his tongue made Harry weak, but he only smiled and said, “Bite me.”
He stood and closed the distance between them, shoving his hands awkwardly into his pockets. He noticed Potter did the same.
And not just from their wands, but from their very presence itself. His father had admitted to him, once, during an incredibly depressing night filled with whisky and the shattering of childhood illusions, that it was the avian link between Veela and peacocks that made their presence at the Manor so vital. It was almost impossible to imagine his father had once bothered to care for the needs of his Veela blood, but the memory was there all the same.
Two men and a curse.
“Pardon me?”
“Something happened that night,” Pansy went on. “I’m still not sure it isn’t some big scheme of yours, but I’m beginning to think that less and less.”
“You have a point,” he said drily.
It floated up from his hand and hung, poised, in the centre of the room. Then, it gave a little shudder and descended into the furthest corner, to the one gear that hadn’t lit up in their diagnostic paths: the tiny gear that moved steadily around on its own. Draco leaned over and squinted into the glass; he could just make out a tiny name.
Fate never liked to be ignored.
“We need it to be believable,” Draco said slowly. “We’ve only just started attempting to be respectful around each other; we can’t jump straight into amorous behavior. People will just think we’re under a love potion.”
“Of course it’s keeping you here! It will continue to keep you here until you admit what you did wrong! We’re obviously in the bloody judgement phase now, having hurtled past the barrier between stages one and two like it was a goddamn race!”
Draco bristled, but he forced himself to let it go. “There are always flaws if you know where to look,” he admitted. “Did you want to readdress it? I can clear time in my schedule.”
Harry knew they were all thinking back to their adventures with parenting flobberworms in third year.
Taking a deep breath, Harry swallowed the retort he had been ready to give and stood up.
“Feels so good,” he murmured.
Ministry involvement in his life isn’t usually something he has to worry about, these days. Not since he hit the age of twenty seven and told Kingsley politely but firmly that if he had to sign one more piece of his life and privacy away in the name of celebrity, he was going to shove every last sheet of the paperwork involved up Kingsley’s backside. The threat worked for a while, particularly when it had been delivered with calm certainty and a procedurally informative gesture, but had unfortunately lost its staying power in the last six months. All it had taken was Witch Weekly to run a “Savior or Silver Fox?” edition, and suddenly it was like Harry was seventeen again. But this time, he was even less interested in what the media had to say and at least thirty percent more likely to hex someone for winking at him suggestively.
“No, Malfoy.” Potter shook his head exasperatedly. “We were just talking about the feeling of magic—types of magic feel different, yeah? Well, this curse has felt strange ever since it settled, and I just worked out why. It doesn’t feel like an ordinary blood curse. It feels like a casting, like there are words that set it off.”
I followed Draco Malfoy to France—long story—and he’s acting really weird. He sent me to this café he used to go to as a child, but he wouldn’t meet me there. And then he told me some story about growing up. It was a sad story.
He leapt to his feet, steadying himself against the wall, and hunted for a piece of parchment. He had to tell Potter. There was no guarantee that he would approve of Draco’s plan, but since it involved leaping headfirst into danger on the slim chance that it would save them time, Draco had a sneaking suspicion he wouldn’t object too strongly.
Love took all sorts of forms, Harry supposed, and was shocked to realise he now held the most unexpected of them.
“Which one?” Draco asked.
Harry thought that Malfoy would sit with him at dinner, and maybe he could try to bridge whatever bizarre gap had opened between them by bringing him into the conversation with everyone else, making it less about the two of them and more about Malfoy being a part of the group. Because maybe that was the problem? They’d just been spending too much time together, and Malfoy was getting snippy that he was forced to act like there was something more than their casual fooling around going on, like they were friends.
Then, there was a fluttering in the corner of his eye, like fabric, and the scene changed. He closed his eyes and heard water dripping onto tiles. Darkness faded away as light filled the room, and he didn’t have to open his eyes to know where he was.
He gave Potter a secret smile, making sure that Hannah saw. Potter’s cheeks flushed in a way that made Draco’s chest tighten, but he had no time to examine it further.
In short, Draco would learn to love Potter, and then he would kill him.
Draco wasn’t shy about muttering obscenities and curses under his breath, all aimed at Harry. There was a terrifying moment of absolute silence during which he held his breath for fear of tipping Draco off as to where he was in bed, and then, surprisingly, the lights flickered off, and Draco was sliding back into bed.
“Yes, well.” He waved a hand airily. “I might be letting the wards down once or twice to let them.”
The room felt warmer than before. Potter’s eyes were so steady on him, so unwavering, that Draco was having trouble breathing.
than everyone else. How could Draco compete with that?
Harry’s incredulous laughter came out in an explosion of air and choking. “You’re kidding me.”
Draco wanted to believe it. He wanted to fall into the richness of that voice and trust that it held answers. But it was useless; he was too deep in a mess of his own making, and he didn’t even know why he’d bothered to come here today, except that if he tried to last one more second on his own he was going to lose it.
Somewhere deep down inside, Draco knew Potter wasn’t insulting him—the lowly peacock keeper hosting the Unspeakable—but it still felt like it.
There was a wizarding café not far from here. It was how they got home every night without splinching themselves, but Harry still hated taking the Floo. He preferred to wait until he was sober enough to Apparate.
Harry opened his mouth to snap something out—he didn’t know what—but the tone of Malfoy’s voice made him pause. Malfoy had always been highly strung, there was no doubt about it, but not like this. Right now, he seemed highly strung because he was nervous, because he was
“I’m not sharing it with you.”
“You’re not going to leave well enough alone, are you?” Draco asks, dropping his magazine and glaring at Harry from over the top of his aviators.
“Don’t be cheeky,” Draco reprimanded him, slapping his arse cheek with his free hand inserting his first finger at the same time. Harry yelped, and when he looked down, Draco was looking very pleased with himself.
Potter contemplated this as Draco thought of curses that were really gifts, and the idea that they might die for them anyway, and then Potter nodded.
“It’s not going to matter if we keep butting heads,” Potter said bluntly.
Then, before he knew it, they were Apparating back to Potter’s flat.
“I wanted to talk to the both of you.”
If Draco could accept, his debt to Fate would be paid in full.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Draco turned and strode through the front door. “The
“George!” Morgan interrupted, and he spun around to her with a grin.
“I know,” he said quietly.
But he was
Draco’s broomstick clattered to the floor. He only took three seconds of panicked second-guessing before he stripped off his leathers in record time and walked under the showerhead next to Potter’s.
The next time they’d seen the Slytherins, they’d all met at the bar and ordered jagerbombs to toast everyone’s good health.
Draco smirked. “Doesn’t feel right. So, you said he’s better than he was, but I just wondered whether you were
“Brilliant!” Harry enthused. “Did you see Arnold? He’s the youngest of the lot and he’s already got the hang of the wordless ‘up’ command. I’ll have to get him to partner up with Emily and see if he can explain the difference in a way that works for her. She might go better wordless than verbal.” He stowed the brooms away and turned back to grab the second pile off Draco.
“Fuck.”
To his surprise, Potter laughed. It was a cold sound, made worse for the slight note of drunken amusement that wouldn’t seem to fade away. All of a sudden, he realised how close Potter was. He turned to face him and took an involuntary step backwards at the triumph on Potter’s face.
Did you know that Hogwarts was the first place that ever felt like a real home to me? Every summer, I had to come back to my aunt and uncle’s house, and it was like going back into a cage. There were actually bars on the windows at one point.
Dear Luna,
With a triumphant grin, he straddled Potter’s thighs and undid his fly. He could feel Potter watching him and he made it as much of a show as he could: sliding his palms over Potter’s hips, peeling back the fabric, running his tongue in a slow slide from the base to the tip.
Harry led the way over to the centre of the pitch. The grass crunched beneath their feet; it smelled as if it had been recently cut, and the scent mingled with the rich scent of hot food that carried over from where the mums and dads were hovering in the stands.
“I do,” Harry agrees, smiling against Draco’s mouth. “And if you play your cards right, I promise I won’t tell everyone you drank beer from a shoe.”
Somehow, in between Potter sneaking around on his property under the moonlight and Draco’s unwitting midnight territory patrols, he had cursed the Boy Who Lived to die.
“Not again,” George muttered, as Draco’s eyes slowly adjusted to the light.
Potter looked a mess, sitting in the bed with his head tipped back against the wall and his eyes staring, unseeing, at the ceiling. For a moment, Draco was terrified that he’d fallen back into the state he was in before, but then he shifted and looked over at them. A strange emotion passed across his face for a split second—a mix of surprise and fear and anger all at once—and then it was gone.
“You didn’t have to kill the Horcrux; it was already dead,” Draco said, his voice sounding weak even to his own ears. “You just had to remove it.”
Before Potter could say anything more, Draco Disapparated, the room fading out of sight like a ghost.
“I don’t know how his friends haven’t noticed, but Potter’s messed up, Blaise. He’s
“Can we get help from the Aurors?” Draco wasn’t sure how they could possibly find him otherwise.
“Talk to me. I know you’re keeping something back.” Blaise’s voice was warm, convincing.
He didn’t get up until the bell for dinner sounded and Malfoy had to kick his shin to rouse him from his thoughts so they could go together, something that was becoming tradition more than habit it seemed. Harry was distracted all the way through the rest of the evening with turning the thought of Malfoy over and over in his mind and examining what had happened at great length.
. Okay, so Potter isn’t ready to see anyone yet—we don’t even know what the problem is—but that doesn’t mean
The crying halted. Very muffled, as if by more than the closed doorway, Malfoy answered, “Come in.”
“Don’t look so surprised.”
“I’m asking you if you’re about to get hurt.”
Draco sighed, reached out, and took Potter’s hand.
Nonetheless, he grabbed either side of Draco’s shirt and pulled him up into another kiss so he could finish unbuttoning and pushing it roughly off over his shoulders. He felt Draco gasp against his mouth, and he couldn’t contain a smug smile as he pushed him back down and made short work of his trousers.
Potter’s eyes held his for the longest moment, like he was studying Draco—curious, interested. It felt real, even though Draco knew it wasn’t. Then, he nodded and the moment passed.
Draco looked up at her, but instead of the suspicion he expected, he saw only concern. “Fine, fine,” he said, waving a hand. “Work has just taken off lately. You know how it goes.”
“To keep the artefacts away from the dorms?” Harry guessed, and Professor McGonagall nodded.
Draco flicked his wand and a tiny vial came racing out of the cupboard. He handed it wordlessly to Potter and waited until the shudders had passed.
Draco turned in time to see Potter racing off to another corner of the room. He looked back to Granger and Weasley, but they were deep in conversation, so he had no choice but to jump to his feet and race after him.
Draco nodded, glancing at the pinboard. “And with them… an end to this. Finally. My debt will be paid. Well—as soon as we solve this curse.”
This was, understandably, not a sentiment that made him feel particularly good.
“You call that bait?”
“What do you think is going on?” he asked. “McGonagall’s put me in here with Malfoy. We’re just about to go and make a switch.”
After several minutes, Potter set down his empty cup and sighed. “Veela use peacock feathers to line their nests.”
about crime stats. But what Potter was saying made an awful sort of sense.
“Well, you
“I’d listen to them, Draco,” Pansy said, still looking a little stunned at the whole thing. “They know best.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not messing with you. The curse is mine, so we just need to work out how I can rescind it.”
Lessons must be taught. Reparations must be given. Redemption earned.
“Hmm,” Harry said, staring up at the gently swirling grey. “Can’t say I’ve ever shagged in a cloud before.”
If he took a little bit longer than necessary so that his inconvenient erection had faded, it was no one’s business but his own.
Draco froze as he watched Potter take in his surroundings. How much could Draco trust this dream? Was it accurate? Because Potter was staring at the cottage the same way Draco might imagine an eternal wanderer stared through a foggy window to a warm hearth and a feast within. Longingly. Desperately. And with the absolute conviction that they were unwelcome.
“Yeah, I think our best option is to talk to the Veela. When I cast this spell, the feathers will create a vortex to heighten your Veela strength, and you can reach out for a parley. Much simpler than my initial plan, which was to hope I found some feathers once used in its nest and put a tracing spell on them.”
“It wasn’t meant to go on so long!” Kalen whimpered. “It was meant to spit him straight back out, not bring him to me.”
Draco shook his head and pulled the book back towards him. He could keep reading, but he wasn’t sure there was any point. He had read everything he could get his hands on several times now, and if he wasn’t the expert on the identification spell, no one was.
?” he breathed. “What in Merlin’s name does that overblown, sorry excuse for a mystery have to do with anything? It was just some drunk wizards out for a joke on the Muggles, I guarantee it.”
attracted to Potter.
Draco blinked at him. He hadn’t even thought about afterwards. Hell, he’d barely even caught up to the present. But if he’d had to think about it, it wouldn’t have even occurred to him that Potter might kick him out.
.” Potter waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
After a moment, Potter shrugged. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then.”
He searched blindly for Draco’s lips, kissing him and grabbing the back of his neck to pull him closer, kiss him harder, deeper. They were still pressed together, the sensitivity making them both whimper, but neither of them made any move to break apart. When Draco finally pulled away to breathe, Harry looked down and realised he had run his hands through Draco’s hair so much, they were both covered in glitter, their sweat-soaked skin shimmering in the moonlight like water.
“Don’t you think you’re overreacting, mate?” Ron asks, wide-eyed as he stares at Harry over the top of his beer. “I mean, you both seem pretty happy to me.”
Draco couldn’t help but notice the familiarity of their actions, and it hit him with an ache so hard he nearly gasped. He’d barely even touched Potter before, but it was so easy. So easy to reach out and caress him, so easy to ask what he wanted—to
“There you are, Aunty Morgan!”
After a while, when his back was soaked in sweat and Malfoy’s fingers had somehow crept beneath his shirt to run slow circles around his hips, he realised he was tired. Drained. Exhausted.
? Completely misunderstanding what’s going on and trying to make it out like I’m some kind of basket case?”
“It felt nice.”
It was such a strange moment of calm between the two of them. Unlike any they’d had before, and yet so normal it seemed like this must be how they always were together. Why had he never taken the time to get to know Potter?
He was the one who had to use his brain to knock the bloody troll out. Before they were walking out of the room, Draco questioned the DADA professor.
He hadn’t been lying; he really
“I’m home,” Harry calls, his voice remaining steady even as his knees feel weak with the enormity of what he is pretending.
Potter pulled a face and nodded, conceding the point.
Harry left the balcony before he could throw Malfoy off it.
“Seen any crazy exes?” Draco asked, trying to lighten the mood.
“It’s the Fair Folk,” Draco said dismally and poured them both a glass.
He didn’t step into the corridor. A part of him recognised it was all very childish, but he didn’t seem to possess the ability to change it.
“Like your meal plan involves blood-flavoured lollipops fresh from the source.”
P.S. I recommend the eclairs.
He heard his name, but he didn’t recognise the voice that said it. It sounded like Potter, but all the roughness and grit were gone from his tone, and besides, Potter didn’t call him Draco.
Draco shook his head. “I’m with Harry. Just popped over to see how it was all going.”
“Fine,” he muttered. “Perhaps we have some,” he hesitated, “
“And this thing between you and Malfoy… it’s serious?” Hermione asked hesitantly, like they were an arithmancy question that wasn’t making any sense, but somehow, impossibly, someone had written an answer that she couldn’t work out. It was quite flattering to be on the end of that look, actually.
“Tell that to Hagrid. He’s in tears over his bubotubers. Didn’t you hear? The sudden turn shocked them. They’ve gone premature. You know what he’s like.”
“Er… why couldn’t we have talked in our room? Or at the Great Hall?”
Potter snorted. “No, thank Merlin. Though I think I caught sight of one of
“I’ve lost him,” he tells Ron, before promptly sculling his beer.
“No!” Morgan shot back. “Of course not!”
“No, I won’t bloody kill him,” Draco snapped, voice shaking. “Can’t you just leave us alone? I forgive him, alright? Wandering into places he doesn’t belong is a bad habit that started in childhood; we can’t expect it to disappear now.”
“Oh nothing, just memorizing our eighth year at Hogwarts. I always wondered why you out of the blue-”, before Draco could finish his sentence, Harry cut him.
“The Potters made a reservation at nine forty-five at night today and my intuition said that they are going to bring my wrench of a disgraceful cousin and his family,” a disgruntled Mother talking to him about her estranged cousin. She told him that she always have a problem with her cousin and not because he was gay (because Draco has come out to Mother and told her he’s gay years ago) or else she has some explanation to do.
Before they get to shout up, Theo raises his hand. ‘Why can’t we use our left hand? How about someone who is left-handed?’ he questioned Madam Hooch. Madam Hooch was looking at him rather annoyed at being interrupted when she gave an answer.
“The fact that I taught you about Pureblood ideology since you were just a mere child and you still disobey me by being with her.”
Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. All three of them stood transfixed to the ground, trying very hard not to scream or bolt.
One night in the middle of December, Draco was strolling through the Hogwarts corridor, he had a lot in his mind to think of, therefore he doesn’t heard Peeves came roaming to him.
“We sometimes studies secretly, something about your father”, answered Granger. If she’s going to blackmail him using his sister then he might have to pull ‘my father will heard about this’ card.
Suddenly, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw something moved, he try not to put his attention towards it because he might scared that Jamie would change his hiding spot but he watched it careful hoping to see some more movement.
And now, Draco sees red, no one can talk bad about him and his family because his family is everything although he kinda despises his father a little. Before Draco could give him a smart comeback, Cassie cuts in.
‘Hello Draco’, said him as he gave him a seductive smile.
They were having breakfast when Celestial informs Pansy that she wants to get her blonde hair dyed on the next Hogsmeade trip. When Hermione hears that, she suggests for Celestial to go with her best friend since she wants to get a haircut too.
Draco’s mouth are moving as he reciprocate the action of the lips against his, Draco slowly opened his eyes, his vision are blurry so he had to blink a few times. When his eyes is on focus, a pair of emerald green eyes are looking at him intently.
Mother once told him when she caught him lying one day that she was so disappointed in him, not because he broke her favourite's family heirloom.
“Take a guess, love”
They laid on bed, snuggling close to each other until their tired eyes closed with a fond smile on both of their face.
Sometimes, she wonders what she did wrong in her past life but when she thinks about it, she was an arse in this life too. Right now, she doesn’t have time to think of it because her stomach has been giving her hell for the past hours.
Harry holding on to Draco like a lifeline, his huge muscular arms wrapped around Draco as he fuck him intensively. His face buried into Draco’s neck, exhaling hot breathe air into his neck.
“Jamie, can I come in please?” asked Draco patiently waiting at the front of the slight open door, when there’s no response from Jamie, he opened the door half way, walked in and closed it behind him.
“Mrs Malfoy, our relationship has nothing to do with your so-called ideology. There is nothing wrong when two women are in a relationship or two men perhaps. You should be happy that your daughter is happy. Isn't that what this war is about? To realise our mistakes.”
Draco closes his eyes again, his body was already tired, he thought everything was done until the fucking healer told him to fucking push the placenta out.
Harry was being impatient so with a swish of his fingers, his jeans and Draco’s underwear were torn off from their body. Both of them were naked now, facing each other with nothing covering them.
Being a good friend that he is, he casts a spell on Dobby’s injuries without a second though so that it will not hurt badly, although Draco did a terrible job at healing it because Dobby’s burn are still hurt but not terribly. His burn turned into a red coloured, he could see the flesh of Dobby’s second layer of skin . He knows it will take a few months to grow a new skin and it can cause scarring.
When he think the troll was unconscious, he slumped against the lavatory wall. He was breathing hard from his nose and mouth, chest rising up and down.
‘Hey, it’s not my fault you held out your hand for me to shake it when you met me the first time’, said Draco as he held out his hand to help him up.
With one free hand while his other arm holds the pillow up, he tends Addie, patting him slowly lulling him to sleep. Cory gave his nipple a bite, asking for attention on his part, he chuckled and changed the position of his hands so his left hand could pat Cory too.
The first-year Slytherins only has one class with first-year Gryffindors which is Potions so he can’t torment them always, at least, until he spotted a notice pinned up in the Slytherin Common Room which him made him beamed because flying lesson would be starting on Thursday - and Slytherin and Gryffindor would be learning together and he can’t wait for it.
Let’s just say that Cassie had something to threaten him if he keeps on bullying people but that’s alright because Blaise and Pansy back him up when they heard about their talk in the common room.
“What did you say to me, girl?” he glared at her way.
‘Trust me, she will be in Slytherin because Malfoys would always be sorted in Slytherin’, he said clearly, maybe hoping that Draco would hear him. Draco turned his head frantically towards the boy and clamped his hand into a fist tightly and sneered disdainfully at his ugly disgusting face. Potter was quiet all the time when Weasley bad-mouthed Slytherin and that gave him a new found dislike towards him.
Draco shoved his food in front of his face, silently asking him if he wanted to take a bite of Draco’s food, he shook his head no.
“I told you not to talk back, how many times do I have to discipline to keep your mouth shut whenever I am speaking? Maybe your incapability is not just being the best at school, maybe it has something to do with your reckless mouth too. Before you make me even more angrier, keep your mouth shut. I have a business to proceed”, leered father at him and proceed their business.
He handed the Potion book for Potter as they were having a conversation,Potter read it for him while he could brew the Amortentia instead. Potter took the book without question.
“Ouch- Ouch-Ouch get off of me. Okay -okay I’m not going to be near him at all.”, she let go of his ear but Draco was never the one who love to obey rules, rule are meant to be broken anyways so he run off to where Potter is.
He was amazed with Quirrell because he put out a great act. Why should he fainted in the hall, should have just faint as he was looking at the troll, that much more convincing.
Draco’s arms gave up on him and he slumped down to the bed but still he could feel Harry’s cock relentlessly jabbing his hole.
Both Cassie and Draco are speechless, he couldn’t form any word, Draco restricted his movement so he was sitting on the couch motionless, face look down to his lap, he can feel father’s eyes on both of them.
‘You don’t have to help him and why are you using the petrified spell on me, should have use it on them, honestly I was really enjoying it until you came and ruined the show.’, said Draco with his eyes rolled.
“I already put silencing charm around the room and we can hear what’s going on outside.”, said Harry as pulled his hand away from his mouth.
‘Quite a pussy aren’t you, Draco?’, dared Pansy as she crossed her arms together and quirked one eyebrow up.
Before, she wasn’t her anything but now she is her everything, Celestial Malfoy is her forever.
“And there’s probably blood tripping out of my vagina,” she added without a shame.
“Okay, Mama.” his eyes never once leave his brother, Draco’s hand went to Jamie’s messy hair, caressing it fondly, “Mama loves you Jamie, all three of you,”, declared Draco to his son so he knows that although Draco gave birth to two more children, he still loves Jamie as the first day he hold him in his arms.
Something caught his eyes because when his father thrust the book quickly to her, there was another book under it, the cover was black and no one could ever see it if they didn’t pay close attention but he did. He wanted to get closer to her but father called for them as he pulled himself out of Hagrid’s grip, to go back home.
Even his voice sounds rich but friendly. His eyelashes flutter as he speaks. Aristocratic features and his sinful slimmed body. He chanted in his mind for Draco to turn around so he could peek at his arse and when he finally saw it, he wished he could bury inside those perfect bum forever.
He swears that whoever petrified him, he was going to hunt their body down but when he looked out of the corner of his eyes, the only person who was holding his wand out was Cassie so he was not going to hunt her body down.
“Thank you- thank you - thank you so much, love. Fuck I just want you to just fuck me right here and now to show you my gratefulness.”
He read without replying, laid his phone back on his night stand.
“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward.”, said Hagrid. Maybe he shouldn’t spoke too soon. “So me, Harry an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville an’ Fang’ll go the other, send a green spark in the sky if you finds the unicorn”, said Hagrid as he told us to practice the spell.
When they arrived in the bedroom with Harry kicking the door shut, he throws Draco on the bed and crawl above him, cupping his face in his hand and gave him a long kiss.
, he bend his body forward and rotating himself and shaking his head in circle and went back up and clutched his hand together to make a gun. His mini skirt went up, showing a bit of Pansy’s lingerie. He doesn’t even know why she gave it to him to wear.
His usual messy black hair is getting messier as Draco keeps on tugging it forward. His olive skin was tinted pink. His pupil is dilated as he is looking at Draco, in his heart, he was glad that Draco was his and no one else.
“Fuck- baby.. “, grumbled Harry under his breathe as his hips meets his thrust. The only sound that could be heard echo through the room is their moaning and the sound of skin slapping against skin.
So the only thing Draco could think of is grabbing his hand, holding onto his hand as tightly as he could so Potter wouldn’t be stupid and advance forward.
He accepted it and absorbed the photo, a young man and woman with a child, he has some of her facial features but he mostly looked like Sirius Black. His Mom was beautiful, no wonder Sirius fell in love with her.
Why does everyone have an emergency today? First, Mother and now Anne? At least Mother has told him that she has entrusted the chef to close the restaurant so he can go home exactly when his work hour is done.
Weasley gave him a hard punch on his left eye and he kneed his ribs really hard that made Weasley stopped from punching him and clutched his ribs instead, so he decided to take the moment and punch him across his jaws that he knows will bruise after this.
‘If I prove it to you, what can you guys give me?’ he said while thinking of a prank he could give them.
“Hey.”
Without her realising, a hesitant hand knocks on the door, calling out to her from outside.
“What is Draco is doing? Dobby must get to work before Master Malfoy notice Dobby is missing.”, asked Dobby frantically scared.
Draco open his mouth to reply but Cassie continue, ‘Weasley said that the reason why she got no friend is because he’s calling her nightmare, a know-it-all so I’m trying to be her to proof him wrong’
She gave him a vague answer and murmured the password. When she’s inside she sees Celestial kissing a Slytherin girl their age on the couch. The unknown girl’s hand is tangled with Celestial’s long blonde hair, kissing like the world is about to fucking end or something, oblivious to the world around them.
Instantaneously, Addie turned his head sideways where his brother was situated, his small trying to find Cory’s. Once he found it, he laid it on top of his. When both of his sons finally went to sleep, he decided to have a quick nap before the Weasley’s go back to their respective homes.
“Yes”, answered Dobby shamefully as if was a sin to want freedom.
‘ What the bloody hell are you doing in the lavatory’, glared Draco at her.
While the other hairdresser, who is quiet, ferreting her wild hair around, and asking how short does Iris want to cut it. She told her that she at least wants a few inches past her shoulders but not too long.
‘Be careful Potter, your prejudice towards Slytherin are showing. We don’t want our Golden Boy to be the next dark wizard’, added Draco.
At breakfast, he heard from Pansy, she’s loves to gossip which is a good thing for him, that Potter received a large parcel and a letter from someone. Draco thought the large parcel must be a broom for him since who are going to buy him a broomstick, he’s an orphan.
“Adrian Castor,” said Draco after a long minute of silence.
Harry put the babies back in the hospital crib while Jamie crawled up to him and laid beside Draco, Harry conjured his own bed because he’s the Boy-Who-Lived and no one will have the courage to tell him otherwise.
“Yes, Jamie- look at those pretty birds,” as he looked out into the direction of where Jamie pointed his finger to.
The healer told his husband that Draco was on the first stage still and it will be some time before getting into the second stage. As he was talking, two mediwitch came inside their quarter to help the healer. The healer told him that his cervix was beginning to open up, it hurts- it hurts so fucking badly.
Potter stepped forward and walked beside him, as they were leaving the other group, he turned his back and waves at Longbottom mischievously.
“No,” Draco said, giving his head a little shake and stepping into the house. “I Floo-called your house and Ginevra answered, looking a bit frantic. She said I’d find you here.”
When the three dunderhead twits finally showed up, he finally let out a relieved breath because he don’t have to spent another minute with Filch.
“That is for scaring the daylight out of me. If I tell father, I’m sure you will get in trouble and I was kind enough to lie to you.”, answered Cassie as she rolled her eyes, crossing her arms together high on her chest.
By hook or by crook, he was going to force the answer out of Dobby, he had to use his master card privilege. Cassie too find Dobby’s behaviour was weirder than usual.
Draco did warned her about being friends with Granger but she ignored his warning. It’s not that he doesn’t want Cassie to be friend with Granger, it just he doesn’t want to listen to Father’s wrath about blood purity, he was sick listening to the same thing over and over since he could remembered.
The sky is getting darker the longer Harry drives. Draco was looking around his surroundings, they were surrounded by trees the farther Harry driving through the countryside road.
Harry decided that he wanted to play with his hole more so he kissed around the hole, jabbing his hole with his tongue on the way.
“Yes, Daddy. Yours always.”
‘Especially Goldstein’, she smirked as she continues. He noticed that Goldstein was looking at them, especially looking at him with a lust in his eyes.
It seems that their tongue was coloured with a purple and blue on each of theirs. His spirit crush and his heart gave a painful squeeze.
“Goodbye dear foes, from now on, thy will be my foe until thee hurtful word about dear me was taken back,” dramatically closing the compartment door and walking away, careful eyes watching each compartment, looking for Potter.
Before they even have the time to speak about it, Dobby appeared inside the room stating that their Mother was calling for them to come down, when Draco appeared looking suspicious, Dobby told him to not do anything stupid and disappeared out of the room. Draco quickly shoved the piece of the newspaper inside his pocket robe and Cassie was trying to put back the photograph in the rightful place but Draco held her wrist to stop her.
As he was caught in the memory, his nose was hit with a scent, he couldn’t identify the scent because the unknown was wearing a scent blocker. Draco growled at Regulus, to notify him to get behind him, he went without arguing.
‘What the bloody wrong with this hat, put me in Slytherin, I demand you put me in Slytherin, my mother would be proud of me and father will not have wasted his saliva lecturing me on why I should be put in Slytherin’.
‘Mr Malfoy!’, she addressed loud and steely that the echo of silence of the hall filled with her voice. ‘Put the hat back on’, she said sternly but Draco did not obey her orders. He turned his head around, facing her and grinned, ‘Sorry professor, need to have a few words with this fabulous and intelligent hat,’ he said softly, hiding an agenda under the soft voice he used.
“Draco, I found it,” Cassie called for him but his eyes was too focus on the old newspaper, while Draco was reading the article about his mother’s cousin, Cassie was flipping through the album and found something strange, she glanced up to her brother and around the wall that hang their family portrait and glanced back down on the album.
‘It’s not any old broomstick,’ he said with a proud look on his face. ‘It’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?’ He grinned at Potter. ‘Comets looks flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.’
“Should have thought before you sneaking out on midnight.”, said Filch proudly, Draco rolled his eyes until he could feel it at the back of his head. Draco looked over at Granger, she was biting her nails, an action when someone are nervous and afraid.
She smirked and shook her head playfully. They talked for five more minutes until Draco decided it was time for work, he excused himself and as he was about to walk out of the door. Mother notified him.
“Aunt Mione - Aunt Mione, Mama got new babies, bwothers - Jamie loves babies,” sat up and bounced in glee, can’t wait to let them see his newborn brothers.
“Oh I’m Harry, Harry Potter,” the black haired boy said.
“Though if his school marks don’t pick up,” said father, more coldly still, “ that may indeed be all he is fit for.”
He could scared her off by jumping from her behind but father told them to touch nothing the shop, what if father saw what’s in his hand is an item he told him not to touch, what would father do to him.
The chilly night shivered his naked body.
HE WILL GET A REDEEMPTION WHEN HE REALISED HIS MISTAKE!!! TRUST ME
‘I’ve been waiting for you since Potion’, said Potter as he was pulling him closer leaving no space between them. Draco was mouth agape, he didn’t know what to say but he don’t have to since Potter kept on talking.
“Sorry, Jamie,” apologised Draco, bending down and kissed his son’s head.
‘Oh It will be my business if someone blabbering their mouth until the news hit Father’s ears, you wouldn’t want that, would you?’, he waited until Cassie was out of sight, he quickly walked out of the room since he was the only one in the common room, to wander for the night.
He was in his college library, thick books scattered around him on the table, his stomach had been churning for the past two hours for skipping breakfast and lunch. He only took a small break to eat a piece of bread and banana.
He sweeps Cory’s fringe to the side - the same identical coloured hair he inherited from him but whilst Draco’s hair is straight, Cory’s hair is more like Harry’s curly black hair, it’s curly. He couldn’t say the same about Addie, it was the opposite - his hair was tameable and straight but with black coloured of hair.
“Jamie thought that Mama-,” his words were cut off when they heard a shouts from Mrs Weasley, notifying Draco that Adrien was crying and wanted his fill, followed by his twin brother, Scorpius.
Draco didn’t tell him his thought about the chamber so when he had to head back, Draco waves sadly at him, looking at his large, tennis ball green eyes, hoping that he won’t be abused at the manor.
Draco stroke his hair as he usually did with Jamie, move his fringe out of the way, his hair is a bit wet from the shower.
They walked out and he closed the door behind him and walked towards the hall. When they came near the hall, the room was noisy with laughter of children and voices of parents talking to each other complaining about the Wizarding World being corrupted by the Muggleborns.
He sighed and gave in to her demand, “Fine but are you alright?” She gave him a half smile that couldn’t quite reach her eyes, gave him an apologetic but thankful nod, walking away seconds later.
Draco laughed at the emoji Harry was using. He quickly typed in smart replies.
It doesn’t shocked him when Granger took the blame, of course she still want to make friends but in the end Professor McGonagall took five points from Gryffindor and grant five points each for the Slytherins and the Gryffindor although Potter, Weasley, Blaise and Pansy did nothing.
They met with Pansy and Blaise on the way to the second floor of the bookstore.
“I would love to do more at you, mark you and show the world that you are mine,” promised Harry as he trailing kissed his neck, biting hard into his flesh, repeating the action until he had a few bruises on his neck.
His husband’s sperm was so powerful that not just they are going to welcome twins into the world but even his son looked exactly like him with the same messy hair, same facial feature but with Draco’s grey eyes and that’s the advantage of being the ‘The Boy Who-Lived Twice’ but he hopes Jamie got his eyesight from him because Harry’s eyesight are horrendous.
Urged Granger as he overhead they conversation. He watched as Longbottom shook his head furiously indicating no.
Before his mind could came out with an answer, Severus’s cloak was on fire that he had pushed Quirrell down from his seat, as both of teacher stopped chanting under their breath, Potter’s broomstick worked perfectly fine that he had caught the Snitch, with his mouth.
Finally, after a few second, father’s gaze went back to the reports in his hands. Draco crossed his arms together and rests his back against the couch, he don’t realised that he accidentally close his eyes when he heard a called from a stern voice.
But his hope was crushed when he found out that his account is private. His back rested against the chair as he tilted his head upward, defeated. There’s nothing he can do when Draco’s Instagram account is private.
Draco followed him unwillingly as he led him away from his favourite table in the library, which is at the back of the library.
Draco gave him a soft hum as an answer but his eyes were still closed. Bringing his arms and wound it around Harry’s neck, showering kissing on his brawny chest. Without waiting for another response, Harry flipped both of them over, him on top of Draco instead.
Jamie was grumbling and mumbling about something, he couldn’t hear his word clearly because he was still covering his face against his father’s chest.
‘I don’t know! Don’t ask me’, said Pansy now, probably already getting annoyed with him but before they get to pick a fight, Blaise cuts in and tell them to let just find her at the girl’s lavatory.
Harry was kissing Draco’s sweating face while he was pulling out. He then laid beside Draco and scoop him closer to him and hugged him from behind, hand stroke Draco’s belly as his other hand wandlessly spelled them cleaned.
He was actually forgot about the scar on his chest when Potter stared down at his chest, eyes wide with guilt. Without waiting for Potter to speak, he put his hand on Potter’s left cheek, gently rubbing it with the tip of his thumb. ‘It’s okay Harry, I have forgiven you long time ago, we were both at fault at that time’, as he stared into his eyes, those emerald eyes that made him fall in love with the boy.
Suddenly, Harry aggressively twisted his body around so his hole was in front of Harry’s face. Within a second, he ate his arse out as he pulled his arse cheeks apart while sitting on Harry’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was already in his Year 11 in secondary school when Draco started going to secondary school, Draco could only look at him from afar with him hanging around with his group of popular friends.
As more students joined in, McGonagall clapped her hand to grab their attention and announced, "If I ever find out who did this, hundred points will be taken from their respective house and there would be no prank wars between houses and if I find out, detention”, said McGonagall sternly as she glares towards the twins. They grinned at her and act like they didn’t say anything.
One of their sons, who is not Harry, is giving him a seductive smile and rubbing his fingertips on the back of his hand while he was collecting the menu from him.
Everyone near Longbottom was laughing at him except Granger as she performed the counter-curse on him and took his hand, leading him over to sit next to Potter and Weasley.
“Papa- Up,” standing on his toes, lifting his arms up, demanded to be picked with the attitude of Malfoy because Malfoy don’t beg, they demand and will get whatever they want and it usually work.
Draco was counting to ten in his head and when he reached ten, he sneaked behind him and tapped his shoulders twice, when he was looking over his shoulders, Draco jumped on him real hard and startled him.
The sounds of a door closing makes him open his eyes, alerted of his surroundings. He looked out the window and it was already night time, he crawled out of bed and ran to his husband to pick a fight for not waking him up. He was supposed to have a quick nap, not hours of deep sleep.
As he walked to the Eighth Year Common Room which he shared with the eighth year since there were only a few returns to continue their study but thank god he shared a room with Blaise, he thanked Morgana’s huge arse tits at that, he thinks about all of the ways on how should he avoids Potter until the end of his school year.
So, he was right, a part of him realized that he was longing for them.
‘So, Potter what was that all abo-’, his sentence was cut off by a loud clapped from Slughorn. Draco was rather annoyed with Slughorn but he still turned his attention to the teacher.
Now he knows now why Severus doesn’t talk about Sirius at all, he was a bully. Maybe whenever he looked at Draco, he could see Sirius because he looked just like him, from the photograph that he had of them. Maybe that’s what pained Severus, Draco reminded him of Sirius when they were in school. Maybe that is why Severus tried so hard to avoid looking at him.
Celestial Malfoy is hers, she is her girl now.
‘Pansy’, replied Harry as he filled his plate with food.
Draco avoided the question by concentrating on his wand movement, but Harry did not, he stopped in his tracks on whatever he was doing, he didn’t like the question one bit. People shouldn’t assume that, to Harry, it was a sensitive topic because nobody should picture Draco with anyone else but him, but nobody knows that Draco already helped someone to warm their bed every night and it is his bed, The Chosen One in every way possible.
Draco needs to concentrate his mind so he lets Jamie do whatever he wants as long as he was seated in the trolley.
Now it was Draco’s turns to laugh, but he was silent the moment Madam Hooch realized they were not paying attention.
“Thank you, Mon rayon de soleil.”
By the glare the trio send in their way, they sure do already who jinx Longbottom. Theo was sneering at Longbottom and that makes the scared boy shaken a little bit more.
Deep with joy, chest rumbling with happiness to be a dad. They built their happy life from then on.
He shook his head slightly, trying very hard to hide his smile. “It’s okay. I find it quite amusing when people just assumed my sexuality without asking. I mean do I really screamed, ‘I’m gay and I loves strong man’?”
In that case, no one will ever find out that he was the mastermind behind this and no one noticed the bell that was hanging by the door under the disillusionment charm so nobody could cancel the spell and the best part is he had a memory that could last for years secured in his muggle camera.
“Nothing, just want to see how my favourite parental figure is doing,” they chuckled, and amusement showed on her face, “Am I your favourite because I’m not uptight like your father?”
‘It’s not your fault, Draco’, replied Severus. ‘But I still can’t forgive him for what he had done to me when we were in school.’ said Severus as he continues rubbing Draco’s back.
Before they walked back to their respective common room , Draco turned to Potter and his friend, Granger while Longbottom was still looking frightened, waiting for his Gryffindor friends to walk to Gryffindor Tower together.
‘Be quiet, Miss Patil-’
‘HUFFLEPUFF!’ shouted the hat.
He then turned to Potter and said,”You soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, I can help you there,” he then extends his hand for Potter to shake it.
“Does this one of the reason why you disappeared at night?”, asked Draco after thinking for a long time. When Dobby didn’t answered him, he turned his head to look at him, Dobby was nodding his head furiously.
Draco was actually half asleep, one eye peeking open looking straight at the phone, he heard words coming out from the phone asking Harry if he already proposed to him, he brought the phone closer to the hand that was hanging around Harry, showing it off to his mom.
“Mother, perhaps I have something that I want but you have to agree to buy it for me because I’m your favourite, right?” he smiled with cheeky grins on his face.
Sweats are forming on both them, their body are getting hotter.
Mother was taken back by his words, thinking about how he does know that Father was a former Death Eater but he doesn't let his mother question him so he quickly continues.
When they finally get to Hagrid, Draco let out a relieved breath as Potter slide down from Firenze’s back. Before the centaur walks away, he turns towards Draco and said, “Blonde haired - you’re a great boy so don’t let vengeance consume you.”
And here they are, eight years later, married with him taking his husband’s name.
‘Truth or Dare, Draco?’, smiled Pansy devilishly.
He was surprised, his heart made a weird movement when he saw Harry. He still remembered the eyes of his emerald green, that’s what attracted Draco to him. Draco always thought Harry got the rare genetic trait since Draco knew no one who inherited black hair and green eyes.
Harry chuckled at it as his mouth was still firmly attached on his nipple. He don’t know when he loss his consciousness but save to say that they had a blissful night.
I have a lot of bloody ideas. Mostly one-shot but I have started a chapters fic so I needed to finish this first. If I'm not mistaken, this fic will finished by the end of 2021? Or probably more but I won't abandoned this.
She hates periods so much. Why can’t she be a man instead? Having a cock would be ten times more awesome.
“You are going to be so fucking gorgeous with my kids, Draco. Not that you are not, you are always fucking beautiful. Fuck- I hope there’s going be a little one inside of you someday.”, whispered Harry softly into his ears.
Draco entwined their hands together where their wedding ring were.
The birth of Draco Black
Two hours later, as quickly as they were wasting their time together without them realising, Draco led Regulus to a river for a drink.
“Fucking bitch- trying to flirt with my fucking husband - not on my watch,” growled Harry, tighten his hold on Draco’s waist, as his mouth bite into Draco’s neck so it leave marks, “Should have mark you before we went out,” murmured Harry by the crook of his neck.
Potter turned his broomstick sharply to face him in mid-air. Draco was stunned since he thought that this was Potter's first time on a broomstick but he shook it off.
Potter face came to a realization that the word that came out of his mouth are all the truth but Draco doesn’t care anymore because he was too annoyed with his stupid face.
‘You-Me, Common Room. Now!’, commanded Cassie. He raised his hands in surrender and rolled his eyes as Cassie was walking in front of her.
“MY MAMA, JAMIE WANT MAMA’S KISSY!”, shouted Jamie, looking angry at his father by putting a frown on his face and knitted his eyebrows together. Both Draco and Harry laughed at his son’s antics.
“Oh, daddy,” he moaned once Harry hit his weak spot. He hopes Harry’s room is soundproof.
When it was the time for them to depart to the train station, Draco shrunk his trunk so that it could fit perfectly into his pocket.
Longbottom was so scared that he accidentally send the green spark in the dark sky as he falls to the ground. He can’t believe it, he caught Longbottom’s expression and it was worth it.
Hours passed by with a lot of screaming and shouting from his side and words of assurance from Harry’s side. When it was time, his cervix was fully open, the fucking healer told him to push out the baby.
The healer uses a cleaning charm to clean the blood up, he loses his consciousness to the darkness five minutes later, when everything is perfect.
Draco who was confused as to why the grown up was speechless, he held his father’s hand with his little fingers. He was bumbling and suddenly, his first word came out of his tiny pink lips, “Da-da”, he called for his fathers attention and tilted his head to make a confused look.
Few days gone by, he didn’t ask anything about it but he did watched Dobby carefully he keep an eye on Dobby strange behaviour.
, as the lyrics continued, he pointed his fingers at Pansy because she was the ‘he’, showed his arse at Pansy for her to slap it and she did slapped it really hard that he bend a little forward,
‘ Hurm- ‘, Peeves said as he crossed his arm, looking at him carefully.
Since the sound were enough to wake the whole bloody resident of the castle, Potter decided to yelled for them to run and the seven of them decided to sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Potter was in the lead without any idea where they were or they were going.
They are closer than ever. They greeted each other in the hall with a nod, a nod is better than nothing and sometimes, Celestial would help her with her studies.
‘Then why don’t you use Blaise then for this viral trend?’, asked Draco.
‘The 8th year groupchat, they were having a party tonight since it’s Friday night and I replied that we are going to be there’, said Harry as they were sitting down.
The newspaper and the photo that was on the desk laid forgotten for the night.
I don't know if I like this work or not.. felt like abandoning it..
Draco was looking up at Harry lovingly, his eyes never leave his husband’s beautiful face and when his husband looked down at him, he lifted his body up and gave him a chaste kiss, lingering on it for a while as Harry deepened the kiss and after they broke the kiss, he laid his head back on Harry with Harry resting his back on the sofa.
He then turns towards Potter, “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”, and walked away.
The chilly night wind of mid-October blew in his face, the taste of freedom. His face relaxes and mind blank, thinking nothing, not even the stress and the uni. Without him fully aware, he rested his cheek on Harry’s sinewy back.
She takes a deep breath, trying to calm her heart and self-reassure that whatever Celestial will be, it won’t change the friendship they already built.
Draco looked into the the mirror to fix his hair when he saw the hickies left by Harry last nigh so he used a disillusionment charm.
Cassie and Draco would practiced by themselves with no help of an adult because Mother is a pristine Pureblood wife and it will bring a bad image if someone saw her riding a broom and so she said and Father always have no time for them because of the business at the Ministry he has to attend. Since they were small, they would help each other out so they don’t need adult’s help much.
“Is there something on my face, Potter? Or have you just realised something about me?”
“Draco, I don’t have problems with animals, should I remind you that your father has allergies towards fur.”
“Why did you hide your hand? Did Father punished you harsher than usual?”, asked Draco.
It took them a while to order but once they were done, Draco wrote in their orders in his notepad as elegantly as he could while his eyes were trying very hard not to stare at the oldest son of the Potters, who weirdly are still sneaking glances at him, who is still haven’t order yet despite having most of his family members already giving him theirs.
His legs bring him inside the compartment as his hands slide the door close. He sat across from her, wanting to look at her face. When he gets a quick look at her, she looks as pale as he is. Is she his long lost second cousin or third cousin or something because he learned about his Black and Malfoy’s family tree. Most of the Malfoys have the platinum blonde hair, he doesn’t know any other family besides him who have that shade of hair before. He know this since he learned about his heritage and family tree when he was young and thought that the topic was bullshit since most of them are dead anyways.
“Huh?”, said Draco as he looked up and looked into Potter’s green eyes, “Oh yeah I’m good, just peachy”, answered Draco when Potter repeated the question.
“Not to speak while you spoke,” she answered in defeat.
yowled Harry dramatically.
He examine some object with interest but nothing caught his eyes like the Hand of Glory does, it was a brilliant invention that only the holder could see through the darkness.
Well anyways, according to Greek Mythology, Cerberus- which he called a three headed dog are a creature that guarded the gates to the underworld. In order to get past the dog, music would have to be played for him to fall asleep.
He reached for his wand on the nightstand, cast a one-way silencing spell around the twins. The silence is torturing that he decided to take a good and relaxing bath where he could clear his mind.
Asked Draco at Dobby, Draco already thought that Potter was missing from the train ride had to do something with Dobby. “You know Dobby, Draco. Harry Potter must be protected. The evil are trying to come for him.”
He tapped in the passcode and went straight to call for his driver, he wouldn't dare call for Uber since it was already late at night.
“Welcome back home, love”, greeted a warm voice. Harry looked up from unknotting his tie and there he was, Draco, wearing Harry’s Weasley sweater, the sweater reached till his knee since Harry was taller than him. His leg were bare, only wearing an underwear underneath.
He took a night shift so it wouldn’t collide with his morning and evening routine. He went to his mother’s office to greet her before he got to work. As he stopped in front of the door, he waited a few seconds before raising his hand and knocking softly on the door.
“Yes,” he said without another word, the boy seems quiet and he has flushed on his cheeks when he's done observing Draco. Cassie decides to interrupt and introduce herself to him. “Hi my name is Cassiopeia and that is my little brother Draco,” she grinned.
‘I don’t have to listen to you’, said Draco as he crossed his arm together. Pansy looked at him with a expression as if he dare to challenge her. ‘You know what I think you will’, said Pansy as she turned her head at Potter to address something to him.
Before he walked out the door, he ambled to his husband’s side, contemplating whether to kiss his husband on the cheek or mouth. He was thinking of kissing him on the cheek so he could avoid those horrid morning breaths but he settled for otherwise.
He looked at them and shook his head and shrugged his shoulders slightly, he took a path to the right with Longbottom trailing behind him, Fang cowering at his legs. He can’t believe he got the two cowards, even though he was scared too right now but at least he doesn’t show it .. yet.
He finally came for the second time followed by Draco’s fourth time as he stroked his own cock. He cum and cum and cum inside of Draco . They never did use protection since the first time they slept together.
Harry plunged his tongue inside Draco’s, fighting with his tongue for dominance but in the end, Draco gave in because he knows he’s a slut for his Daddy and only his.
After a few minutes of searching for his goddamn phone, he finally found it under his pillow, he felt dumb because he doesn’t remember putting it there. He locked into his phone and search for Blaise’s contact number and call him.
All thoughts flew out of his mind when he saw Cassie was moving far behind, where no one could see them if they were at the counter. This is a perfect opportunity so he took one of the skull carefully from the shelf as he held his breath.
But he can’t because he could hear a sound of a cat meowed to their owner.
He finally cum for the third time and it triggers Harry too.
When he was satisfied with Draco’s mouth, he kissed him on his neck, suck it aggressively leaving hickies for people to see that Draco belongs to him. Draco moaned harder, calling his name when he sucked on his sensitive spot.
“Yer alrigh’ Harry an’ Draco”, asked Hagrid as they walked back to the castle. It was a traumatic experience on his behalf that he hope he will never encounter something like that anymore.
“Jamie loves mama too and the babies and papa.”
More information was asked until he was satisfied, until it left him speechless.
“Tell me why you hate me, Jamie,” persuading Jamie as he asked him calmly with the softest tone of voice he could muster.
‘Well, Draco you will listen to me when I’m going to blackmail you’.
Gemma Farley immediately giving orders to them followed by her prefect companion who’s named he didn’t care to know, probably Daniel something. The first year who was terrified followed their orders immediately but something doesn’t feel right for Draco so he decided to look around and saw that Cassie was nowhere in sight.
His fingers are pinching and twisting Draco’s nubs as he chew on his food, he fucking loves to play with his nipples, everything about Draco are just alluring, from his head to his toes especially his personality.
“Good”, murmured Harry as his lips pressed into the bump of his stomach.
‘Of course he has,’ said Weasley, wheeling round, ‘I’m his second, who’s yours?’ Draco looked behind him at Blaise and he nodded.
‘When you told me what you smell on the Amortentia, I was ecstatic because the boy who I was in love with, loves me back. I gave you a lot of hints Draco, you are so oblivious.’, said Harry as he was trailing kisses on his neck until he came to his ear, ‘I touched you all the time to make you notice me, to have your undivided attention only for me’, whispered softly and bit on his ear lope softly. Draco’s soft moaned echo through the room.
When the number hits one in his head, he taps her shoulder twice and once she turns her head around, he shoved the skull in her face.
“Iris, sometimes you are too oblivious,” addressed Hermione as she rolled her eyes at her, she was totally not insulted by Hermione’s insinuation. If she was oblivious, Voldemort would still be roaming around the Wizarding World trying to kill people for his own happiness.
He then walks back to the living room, looks at his surroundings, walls full of photographs. Of his family and his friends. He went inside his least favourite room, where it held the family tapestry.
“So who’s the lucky guy?” asked Bryan without filtering his words, loud enough that Harry could hear them clearly because he was helping one of his students in Draco’s group.
From the corner of the room, a mother who has just given birth woke up. She looked around her surroundings and her eyes found his husband and their friends “Siri,” she called softly and Sirius’s head turned towards her, he practically skipped to her and kissed her lovable lips, her heart shaped lips full with emotion. He poured all of his happiness into it.
What is wrong with him? He has never been this horny before. He can’t blame it on the angel when it was his own body's fault that they can’t behave. His mind is going to places that shouldn’t even be crossed.
They were not pleased at all and Draco loves it.
“Everybody knows about that, just because your family has the money doesn't mean that they looked up to you guys,” he said in a mocking way and curl one lip up.
Well he did but just in passing.
“yes … hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me … It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out … hang you by your wrist from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed … Right, off we go, and don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”
Dobby nodded his head in acknowledgement, ears flopped down and apparate away, bringing Draco back to the manor to enjoy his summer holidays.
Minutes later, Cassie was standing beside him, she murmured softly into his ear, “You are smart, Draco. Don’t listen to what father said.”, and kissed his temple.
‘You are Potter to me when you being insufferable’, as he looked down to the ground, flushed cheeks.
For the next few days, Draco was on a looked out on the trio until one afternoon when he heard from Goyle that Weasley was in a Hospital Wings, he’d to pay him a visit because that was the right thing to do, right?
After all, he was the boy who lived who defeated Lord Voldemort 17 years ago, without him the Wizarding World is doomed. Before Draco was born, he was the one to guarantee that the Malfoys didn’t get sent to Azkaban for joining the dark side.
Easy! Right? He thinks the bloody hell not, how can he conjure a massive piano in the room which occupied with a massive three-headed dog, before he can even press the key on the piano, he would have been eaten. It was the only musical instrument that he could play since he was young.
They were now at the cemetery, visiting his mom’s grave since it was her eleven year death day, he asked Dobby to bring him here without the Malfoys knowing, they don’t usually talked about his deceased mother because he would always get a sad expression on both of father and mother’s faces; especially mother’s and he was not good with dealing other’s emotion, he can’t even deal with his own emotion.
The table on the right side cheered enthusiastically as Hannah Abbot went to sit down at the Hufflepuff Table.
(some Easter egg is that both Lucius and Narcissa knows who's the killer is and when Draco found out about it.. all hell breaks loose)
‘Yes, Mr Goldstein’, as his fingers pointed at him. Goldstein stood up from his chair and with a look of excitement, he answered. ‘It’s a love potion, sir’.
He sat on his chair stunned, looking at the angel which he just knew was related to his godfather, Sirius. Conversations coming in and out of his ears. How can he listen to another conversation when his only focus was the waiter Draco.
‘Mr Malfoy, follow me too!’, she said sternly, Draco obeyed because he knows not to mess around with her. Bloody hell, he hopes that he’s not in trouble but by the look of Professor McGonagall, he knows that he did.
And with that, Celestial lit the cigarette out, throwing it away and quickly stood up, walking away from the tower, from her.
said the word that coming from Potter’s mouth.
They walked out of Knockturn Alley into the bright Diagon Alley, whoever invented both of the alley are genius especially the gloomy state of Knockturn Alley. They walked to Madam Malkin’s shop, mother are already waiting for them in front of the shop, standing proudly and looking down at her inferior in disdain.
‘ This way!’ Potter mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armour. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Draco who looked over at Cassie and their eyes meet, she gesture her hand, pointed her finger to him and moved her finger to her neck, gesturing her finger movement into a slit motion and mouthed, ‘You are dead’
The same Harry fucking Potter from just now. He was tempted to accept but his conscious mind was telling that it could have been an accident because why would a famous football player want to follow his three thousand followers account.
“Thanks, Potter for not judging me,” she sighed, probably with her eyes closed since Iris is still had her head facing the sky, locking her eyes with the stars in the sky, admiring the star from afar and the star close to her, trying very hard to act that her body pressed against hers means absolutely nothing to her body and brain.
She admits.
“Come in,” answered the disembodied voice from the inside of the room. He pushed the door open, peeking his head inside before walking into the chilly room. The cold air hit him in the face once he entered his mother’s office. There, in the middle of the room sat his mother while looking down on a paper she was reading. He walked towards an empty seat and sat himself down without asking.
“Hurm- should mama buy it for you? I don’t think so - you have been a naughty boy this evening,” said Draco as he teased his son playfully. “I think I better put it back,” hand dramatically putting the fruit down but then he stopped when his son screamed very loudly.
“I’m going to the bathroom for a bit,” informed Harry to him once they arrived at the health and beauty aisle. Draco nodded his head as his eyes scanned through the shelves, he pushed the trolley further into the aisle.
Draco nodded his head as he felt Harry’s hand went from his nipples, slides down to his arse cheeks, his rough hands are peeling his arse while his mouth are trailing kisses and leaving bruises on his neck.
Draco had planned the perfect prank he should pull on the Gryffindor for April Fools after the Quidditch Match between Hufflupuff and Gryffindor. Since Gryffindor won, this was his gift for their victory.
Once he settled inside at the opposite edge of the tub, he pulled Draco into his lap, and he went willingly without any protest. His husband will always bring him the warmth and comfort he needed on days like these.
“I love you more, dragon.”
“When he grows up, he will learn about his real family, please don’t try to hide it from him when he started to ask about it, I know he's a smart one, he will try to put the missing pieces together but for now, let him have a life where he has mother and a father who is not in Azkaban and for now, his last name will be Malfoy and not Black. When he starts his Hogwarts, he will be known as Draco Malfoy''. He reached into his pocket, he looked at it for the last time and handed her the moving photograph of his family.
‘Did you know that Goldstein can’t take his eyes off you, I can see that he wants you but he can’t have you because you are mine!’
These thoughts made Draco’s mind grow hatred towards Sirius Black, but Mother said to not think badly about him, what good does he have anyways when he rather went for revenge instead of taking care of his son. A little voice in Draco's head wants him to hate Sirius Black or even the Potters but he decides that it is not The Potters fault but Pettigrew.
Draco looked over at him and saw that his face was red like his hair from embarrassed. He patted him invisibly in his head.
He fell back against the couch and closed his eyes. Unbidden, his thoughts turned to Potter and what it would be like if he was here with him. He imagined Potter staring at him from across the pile of presents, eyes bright and cheeks flushed from the wine. He pictured sending tiny pieces of tape flying across the room, sticking themselves to Potter while he spun in a circle trying to pull them off.
“No one else is here,” Draco agreed, looking around at the stark room. His voice echoed a little as he spoke. “I wonder if Pansy wants us to go upstairs.”
“Are they—?” he asked, too horrified to finish the sentence.
Draco watched Harry fight back a laugh.
“It’s all we have.”
He thought it now, and he had thought it then. But of course, back then, that was when Potter had burst through and sliced him into pieces, proving everything that he had just been thinking.
The incredulity on Potter’s face made Draco laugh.
The words “we’re friends” echoed around in his mind, and a shiver ran down his spine that had nothing to do with the chill in the air. He shoved it aside; he’d known what was getting into from the start.
“Who would have thought it,” Potter said softly, his face soft with amusement that only Draco understood. A private joke, just for them. “Shall we?”
It’s madness. It’s insane and terrifying and incomprehensible, and it’s
And Draco wanted to be reborn.
Draco snorted, some of the tension visibly seeping away. “It’s not your birthday anymore. Don’t be daft.”
“Swallowed pride, a hand to take. It used to say
“You don’t like the Floo either, Potter?” Parkinson asked, rolling her eyes. “Draco says it ruins his clothes.”
“This has a decent chance of working,” he said lightly. “We might not need a new plan.”
Potter tilted his head back and laughed. “God, so they actually bought it?”
Malfoy’s eyebrows lifted. “Potter, you wouldn’t have been alive. Or barely, at least.”
. It didn’t mean anything, but Draco noticed.
They had already passed four days into their intended two day lock-down, and the stirring resurgence of emotion in Harry’s gut didn’t feel like a positive thing, no matter if it likely was. He wasn’t enjoying remembering what it felt like to be overwhelmed. Powerless.
They decided that Potter should be the one to create the echo, since he seemed to have the most experience with it for reasons unknown to Draco. He didn’t really care; it suited him. He was far too distracted running his fingers across the mark on his neck to be able to think about spells and echoes and cursed items that never did what you bloody wanted them to.
Draco looked over to see such relief on Potter’s face that he couldn’t help laughing. “I should just leave you to it since you dragged me over half the party like a mad-man,” he said pointedly.
Draco wouldn’t do to get Potter the help he needed, no matter how long it took, or how long Potter needed to come to terms with it. Draco would make sure Potter knew that Draco would give him space, if that’s what it took, and that when Potter was ready, Draco had a list of resources waiting for him. He didn’t have to face this alone anymore.
“You can’t,” Draco agreed, his mind already whirring with ways he could pick up the project and keep it running. “I’m glad you’re leaving.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake.” Draco Summoned the pot and set it on the kitchen table. “Sit.”
“I was going to wait,” Harry said slowly. “And I mean, it’s probably bad form to do it at a wedding. But I thought… when are we going to get another shot at being—” he looked around, his eyes catching on the tiny vines that curled around the pillars in the center, covered in strange flowers Draco had never seen before, “—wherever this is,” he finished.
Their voices rang out oddly in the huge space. The light blue walls didn’t feel like they were closing in, but they made Draco feel very small. Very small and very lost and very alone. The sensation of it all was making Draco’s head spin and his vision blur. Or maybe that was just the panic.
“This has to stop,” Draco echoed.
discount the importance of your own feelings. If you do, that’s when it’s going to go downhill. You can’t save someone if you have to destroy yourself to do it.”
“You sure that’s not what
Malfoy laughed, the sound low and rasping. “I think you’ll like it.”
, really?”
Potter groaned and obliged, his hands gripping Draco’s hips so hard he was sure to leave bruises. Draco dropped a hand down between the wall and his cock, gripping himself and sliding up and down in smooth strokes. He was close, and judging from the urgent sounds behind him, Potter was, too.
Most of those are just going to filter through the Muggle-borns and half-bloods that we’re trying to reach. It’s just a more long-winded way of doing it.”
“Right, that’s it,” Draco said abruptly, sitting up. Harry had to take a step back so he wasn’t headbutted in the sternum, though he couldn’t see a way that that wouldn’t end in more laughter at this point, and possibly tears for entirely different reasons. “Get on the bed, I’m showing you how it’s
“It’s crazy!” the other agreed.
As the only wizard in Wiltshire possessing Veela blood, and possessing, too, a decades-long feud with the man in question, Draco doubted there was anyone who fit the bill more than he did. And, of course, he had been wondering when he would owe reparations to the Boy Who Lived.
It felt different to how it felt in the dream state—sharper, almost painful. He opened his mouth to say something, but found himself choking a little, unable to speak.
Blaise laughed. “I’m telling you to take the smartest option. Make him listen to you. Be persuasive.” He lifted his eyebrows suggestively before turning solemn once more. “Seriously, Draco—this has to stop.”
I’m writing this after admittedly one too many gin and tonics, which always leads me to become both more melancholy than usual and more honest—a terrible combination when it comes to you.
“Yeah,” he said finally. “But the thing with Robards is, if he doesn’t want to hear it, he doesn’t. He’s got too much on his mind to think about a new program. He’d rejected it before he even knew it existed.”
He embraced it.
Oddly, he did trust Potter. It wasn’t just that he was emotionally invested in this case, which would certainly override any feelings he had about Draco. It wasn’t just what George had said to him—that Potter thought he was the best—and the certainty that Potter wanted him on this case. It was the look in Potter’s eyes, how everything seemed a little bit dull around the edges. It was the certainty that nothing was hidden, not around Draco—the knowledge that there were no simpering smiles that could fall away as soon as his back was turned.
Potter laughed a little breathlessly. “I know. I can’t wait to tell them.”
around the flying visitor. When he had finished, nothing much about the succulent had changed, but the soil was damp around the tip of his finger and the droplets on the leaves glistened in the sun.
“Don’t look so pleased with yourself,” Malfoy snapped, though Harry noticed he wasn’t moving away and didn’t especially look like he was going to hex Harry in the immediate future. “You caught me off guard tonight is all. Next time, I’ll be more prepared. You were the one who came faster than a virgin being touched for the first time.”
Just before he Disapparated, Malfoy winked at him and blew him a kiss.
“Sickle for your thoughts?” Pansy asked, smiling at him over the rim of her glass.
Draco let their conversation fade out of his awareness as he leant on the barrier and watched Harry teach. Harry was made for this. He had the kids hanging on his every word, and his expression was so light, so carefree, it was like Draco was looking at a different person. The tightness in his jaw that he’d always worn for hours after getting home from work was gone, the lines on his face overtaken by laughter rather than tension.
Wrapping Christmas presents was always a sober affair for Draco. He tried to mask it by inviting Pansy into the whole saga, drowning them out in the most hideous wrapping paper he could find, and consuming goblet after goblet of mulled wine. This year, however, Pansy was unavailable, and there was nothing to distract him from the painful reminder that each carefully selected gift was a farce.
Potter’s face closed over, and the anger Draco had seen just before rose to the surface again. “And I suppose you think you know the answer?”
“Sorry,” he murmured. “What did I miss?”
“I hardly think, given the urgency of current events, that we would have wasted our precious time within the trance on… this… unless there is something grossly important that we have overlooked,” Draco said, refusing to look at Potter.
He sat bolt upright in bed and stared at his bedroom walls in horror.
Hermione hummed thoughtfully. “Yes, you did look particularly
“Is now really the time?” Potter snapped, leading the way into the study.
“I thought the biggest part about all of this would be the sex itself,” he went on. “It sounded like such a big deal, the way everyone would talk about it, and our overly-loud neighbours. I thought there was something huge that I was missing out on, and that when I got there, it would all make sense. And maybe that’s how it is for other people, I don’t know, but I
“No. We just have to convince the harpy, the strategist, and the inhumanly obsessive intellectual.”
Before long, Harry is riding the edge. He threads his fingers through Draco’s hair—soft with product despite how Harry’s hair is still salt-thickened and rough from the sea—and grips just hard enough to hurt. In response, Draco’s speed quickens, bringing with it a warning hint of teeth, and Harry moans.
“Just talented that way,” Harry says, the words coming in a rush of laughter. “Are you hungry?”
“Yes, well, it’s not exactly relevant.”
Potter’s chest heaved and his eyes had turned slightly glazed. After a moment, Draco realised he wasn’t looking at Draco; his eyes were fixed at some distant point Draco couldn’t see.
The memory of those lips over his cock flooded his mind, and he stopped caring. He slid inside his pajamas, palmed himself, and began to stroke.
Harry kept waiting for Malfoy to say something, but he should have known better. He knew just how stubborn the man could be, and, true to form, Malfoy remained silent as they headed off in search of the path of the unicorn herd.
“I shouldn’t have left you to deal with them alone,” he says, forcing himself to look Draco in the eye.
Draco frowned. “Yes? But I don’t see what billiards have to do with anything.”
Morgan laughed. “Of course.”
The frequent rages, the territorial displays along property borders, the—Draco shuddered—
But Potter had, and now the choice was up to Draco.
The broom shot into the air, and at the last second, he pulled his hands away so that Emily could catch it. She giggled, her entire face lighting up with joy.
“Right!” Harry shoved his hands in his pockets and looked around at the small crowd of children at his feet. There were around fifteen of them.
