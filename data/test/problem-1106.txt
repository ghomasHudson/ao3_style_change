As Dumbledore neared him, he noted a number of empty whiskey bottles and an acrid stench. Nodding a little, he Summoned his own tumbler and filled it.
‘Hmm?’ Severus made a noise like he was agreeing with whatever Draco had just said, a clear sign he was
‘Good question.’ Cross backed them all out of the room but didn’t pocket his wand. ‘Robards has already authorised drastic measures. Kid’s got a core that could take this small town with it if he has a proper tantrum.’
His poor opinion of the Potions Master began the night after the whole Forbidden Forest debacle. Draco was special, hence, he was allowed into Professor Snape’s private Potions Lab in the belly of the Slytherin dungeons. The Potions Master was Severus to Draco, on account of his father close friendship with him.
‘Can you understand us?’ Albus asked quietly in the space between them as the boy returned to his exploration of Albus’ beard and long grey hair. When the boy didn’t reply or react to Albus’ question, they all had their answer.
Now, Albus’ had been a Legilimens for some decades now and was not a shoddy Occulmens either. Although, the strange upside-down feelings his mind was experiencing then was something he hadn’t come across before.
They all walked in silence then, all alone with too-deep thoughts filled with mourning and melancholy.
like it hadn’t washed in a few moons. It smelled like rotting, maggoty meat that not even the bravest of scavengers would take a sniff at.
The Forest always gave Harry a gentle sort of guidance and she’d softly pushed Harry to pursue the hairy creature, for Harry to help him where he could. And did so gladly because Hagrid was wholly worthy of it in a selfless sort of way.
‘I think he does Remus.’ Albus murmured. ‘Very much so.’ He confirmed without actually stating what they were all dancing around.
As Draco hurried back to the castle, he tried to sort out the jumble his head had become. It was a mess of questions, of thoughts leaping in different directions, of worries and anxieties biting at him.
‘Neither’s Robards or the hoods. He started ranting about the kid being the next Dark Lord or some shite. Though, I can’t say I disagree with him.’
Despite its size, the beast had a soft hand and made gentle sounds before he let the chicken on its way. The creature was careful, and he seemed to respect everything that surrounded him – he even look somewhat awed when he passed different plants and tree spores.
‘Albus, what – what do you want me to do?’ At Albus’ furrowed brow, Harry garbled an elaboration. ‘I mean – what should I do now I’m here and – when do you want me to go? And-.’
‘Care to elaborate on that survivor shite?’ Stickes asked with an edge to his voice that told Stone he was already done with Cross as he was.
It was the night he'd taken Malfoy and the Weasley boy into the woods for their detention. Hagrid had begged off bringing them with him, he'd told Albus he didn’t know what was out there still and it was dangerous - but the Headmaster had simply shaken his head preaching something about curfew and character building.
It was silent except for the sound of the soap rubbing against slick cloth and the faint popping of the suds.
He thanked the forest by returning what he didn’t need to its floor, innards, fruit skin, and bone. It helped the plants grow wild and fierce around the hut. But he knew he’d have to hunt soon; the sun was starting to cast longer shadows much earlier. Sometimes the pips grew, he had a few young apple trees beginning to sprout. But it still be some years before they bore any fruit.
‘I understand that, in the past, you have probably utilised your magic to protect and feed yourself. You’ve honed that skill and them some. However, what I will aim to teach you is how to wield you magic to create, to transform that which surrounds you.’
‘I think so. I don’t think he’s met any Wizard before. Except the one he banished.’ Albus confirmed, his gut clenching at what he imagined was a terribly lonely existence.
It was then the stories his father read to him and Aberforth before Arianna was born. Then came the ache in his hand when he was forced to write a letter to his Aunt thanking her for knitted pants that she had no business making
Hagrid realised that he’d been through these parts before some years back. He sometimes left a swipe of white paint on a boulder or a tree if he was exploring – just to make sure he didn’t get
He hesitated. But curiosity won over when he heard the rather large creature call out to something; the noises it made were guttural but melodic and it made Harry feel…calm.
Harry bolted, grabbing tree branch after tree branch with a swiftness that blurred him. He yelped when more flashes of colour tried to touch him, when he lost his footing and nearly fell, when the branches nicked his soft skin as he stumbled.
‘Neither of us did.’ Stickes agreed, his hands now shaking. ‘We wouldn't be able to magic the memory away either…’
Instead, Draco conjured a bucket of warm water, a rag, and a bar of lemon soap before levitating closer to the boy.
It made Harry feel…uneven. Like he was watching something he wanted to be part of but was not invited to. He didn’t know how to broach that instinct that wanted to reach out and…Harry honestly didn’t know what to wanted to do if he did.
Harry removed the shiv hidden in his skin between his shoulder blades as he held the readied bow and arrow in the other. The wet sound of the buried shiv breaking flesh cracked through the stillness. It didn’t hurt anymore; the forest had shown him how to protect himself.
Hagrid still wasn't so sure when he and the shivering boys followed him into the Forest. They weren't going in deep, he promised himself. They were only travelling to where a small herd of Unicorns had popped up a few days prior to check up on them. Best time to do that was when the moon was high, the Unicorns spooked less that way.
Standing up he went to shape a bowl out of the small boulder that sat outside the hut. He’d have to be quick; it never held its shape too long once he changed it.
‘Run scared from th’ looks of it. I ‘aven’t seen hide nor hair of them for weeks now. Not one print.’ Hagrid rubbed his hands together, agitated.
There was a small nick on Hagrid’s hand from where the branches had whipped at him as he’d ran after the boy. He opened the tub and then put a small amount on, showing the boy it healing up.
With one last look back at the wan faces of the other Professors, Harry was guided through to a new room.
He pointed to the strawberries, a slice of the stump, and the a few flowers from the flowering trees he’d found. Actually, thinking back on it, he was less pointing and more brandishing them in Albus’ increasingly bemused face.
‘Nonsense. I’m simply concerned for the welfare of our students and resident creature, since this stuff is being slathered over the latter by something which might harm the former.’ The Potions Master scoffed.
Breaking the surface against with a quiet gasp, he looked around carefully. He’s just spooked some deer that had caught scent of the pulp he’d just washed off. Though, except for the quiet sounds of the smaller creatures – he was alone for now.
Harry ignored him for another prized he’d found on the way up. ‘Oh, cloudberries!’ He grabbed at the yellowy-orange fruit but frowned when he saw how little space he had left in the bowl. If he stretched the stone any further, it would crack.
And if the forest was angry at the first mauling, it was livid by the fourth and enraged at the fifth.
A while later, Harry emerged from beneath the floorboards to find a very confused Headmaster sipping tea.
With tentative steps Harry followed the curve of the corridor until his foot met air again and his heart lurched. Feeling at the ground, Harry’s hand found a platform below him, and then another which revealed a set of stairs.
‘We need to leave Harry.’ Colther hissed from the ground under him. ‘You heard what I told you before; they won’t like it when they find us here.’
This thing was a mound of black on the forest bed. It suckled at its prey, completely unaware of the green pair of eyes watching it. The sickly-sweet scent of Unicorn blood carried, and it turned Harry’s stomach.
The creature gasped as it tried to dodge the vines sharpened tips. And Harry watched it closely as it ran. He noticed it twisting its own wrist, sending out flashes of light and colour. Its power was bright and full of energy, it almost tasted
‘Put those effin’ things down!’ He shouted out as he eyed the gash on the boy’s side and the wicked sharp wooden spikes that surrounded him. The spikes moved in a circle around him and the thicket, quivering as if ready to strike at any moment. ‘He’s hurt, you bleedin’ dolts!’
Stickes rubbed his hands against his face furiously as the Occulmensed memories leaked through the cracks.
‘…Your concern is noted, but I doubt it will bear fruit. If it does, I will listen to your grievances then. Now…’ Snape then gestured for Draco to leave.
‘Albus?’ Minerva probed cautiously. No wonder, Albus and the boy must have made quite the visual; an old man grinning and making odd noises with his eyes closed as magic whipped around a boy who resembled the fabled Pan of the Wild.
Harry rounded on Colther quickly as the snake exited a hollow stump, the dark energy with roaming in his arms and legs. ‘Do you know what that was?’
He turned and was then startled by a small creature with pale, silvery features. It was staring at Harry – reeking of fear.
The Forest was an unforgiving place to dwell, and Harry had lived and breathed it since he was a babe. He knew what cruelty was, he’d seen other creatures tear each other apart limb from limb. He’d seen babes eaten, the sick discarded, and the old picked off.
This was now his sixth journey through the deeper parts, an area that any sane person would tend to avoid if they liked living. The Forest promised no kindness. But Hagrid knew these parts better than most, and with his trusty crossbow in tow – he was willing to take the risk.
With one last look south – where he’d banished the creature far beyond the Forest’s trees. It seemed
‘That lead me to the third rule: you cannot use your magic as a weapon while in this school – not unless you are in immediate danger and refraining would cause you harm.’
When he finally caught up with them, somewhat struggling to breathe and spitting out beard hairs, he saw that they’d surrounded the boy, holding him at wandpoint. The boy had burrowed himself into a small thicket, the shadows hiding his face. The light only rested on his eyes which were startlingly green and very,
Albus and Snape busied themselves with testing and running spells over the new salves and the woven wood fence. Their expressions were equally amused and fascinated, despite Severus’ attempts to seem disinterested.
He’d told Albus about the first mauling. The Headmaster had joined him in the disused stables to the east of his cabin. Albus’ eyes filled with a strange tension when he saw the state of the poor thing. His eyebrows inched higher when he took in the bite marks.
He moved closer to the ice-white creature, trying to catch his name in the hubbub of loud conversation.
The report stated its own speculations; it suggested that James and Lily must have went into hiding sue to the nature of their sons magic.
A large part of Harry wanted to jump down and finally meet the other boy. And now that he could, speak to him.
But Harry could understand the sentiment, he often harmed those that threatened him or the Forest. He would probably harm anything that tried to hurt Hagrid, the mares, even Colther.
‘Leave.’ Harry hissed warningly, circling the heaving form. ‘You do not belong.’ The screaming creature suddenly stilled – well – as much as it could when its body was slowly wasting away with putrid, deadened skin. Its face turned to him; it arms cradling itself.
Harry nodded sheepishly. ‘I followed you.’ He said to Hagrid. ‘The Forest said to help – one of your kin hurt them badly.’
Stickes was pretty sure if given the option, he might be tempted into it if it meant he’d never had to encounter the smarmy cunt again.
shame.’ The snake was pointedly looking away from Harry. ‘I guess you won’t want what I’ve just found.’ Harry smirked at the snake chanced a glance in Harry’s direction.
‘And you say that the area houses non-magical creatures?’ He probed levelly before politely turning down Hagrid’s offer of an aptly named rock cake. Hagrid set down a mug -nay- bucket of tea before sitting hurriedly like a child would if told there was chocolate cake ready for them.
Goodness gracious!’ Minerva exclaimed as the little one clambered into her lap and started inspecting her necklace, biting it. He then got a hold of the poor woman’s hair bun – which he seemed to be strangely enamoured with – squishing it between his hands.
After that, he began following the creature often with a curiosity that ate away at him. Harry always egged himself on to do the stupidest things sometimes;
The boy ran his hand over the cut instead of looking at it, still obviously too wary too look away from them, and he winced at what his fingers could feel. Hagrid then spied strange black markings on the boy’s skin, which seemed to
of the odd beasts with their shiny pieces of wood. Hagrid was among them, pointing to deer carcasses and prints Harry had left before he’d tended to the sick mare.
Harry pointed to the wand Albus held. ‘Yours dances, it’s alive and colourful, full of life. Even the spells that smell more like mine are full of light.’
magic – the kind he’d felt in spits and spots over his years as a friend of the forest. And the earth was soaked with it here, where all this life brimmed around Hagrid like a strange out-of-place sanctuary.
Then he finally lost his footing completely in his panic, his mind unhelpfully adding that the blunder was unlike him, and that he knew the Forest well enough to do better.
The Potters had sought Albus’ aid in the first few months of Harry’s birth. The infant, so young and small, was already experiencing instances of accidental magic – and they were
It was shouting, or that’s what it seemed like. The second creature wore far stranger cloths than the last one; a strange wrapping on its head – even though the sun was now high – and layers of thicker dark red wool, so long they brushed the ground at his feet.
‘-I know what hunting is, you fool! I am asking what it is exactly that you wish to hunt, insipid boy!’
used to being in charge of himself, of being responsible for his own actions and mistakes. To say that these
Dumbledore also let himself be flummoxed for a few beats; the boy’s swift grasp of language and the knowledge he was unraveling made him feel off kilter. Albus looked around, apparently everyone else was feeling the same.
It screamed again, it sounded like frustration. Harry didn’t run like it tried to. He walked calmly, always pressing forward, always throwing more and more at it. Harry’s hand moved like they were weaving; pushing and pulling at the dead wood, leaves and animal carcasses and forging them into a writhing being of many arms, hands and sharp nails.
‘You mean if we don’t. And it’s not a bloody thing Chris! It’s a fucking child!’ Stickes spat, his hate for the man now reaching a whole new, dizzying level.
‘My…magic.’ Harry then said slowly, with a small smile. ‘Can you do this?’ He gestured to the vines.
The other Professor took their seats, all of them watching Harry as if he were the oddest sight they had ever laid eyes on. Though perhaps he was, he didn’t look much like them.
‘Violence is forbidden otherwise. Especially among children.’ Lupin offered, his expression still stern and foreboding.
A flicker of movement and Draco saw the boy in a tree far to the left of the enclosure, so far in fact, it should have been impossible for him to clear the distance. Draco tensed every muscle, contorting them into paralysis.
Moving about the room, Harry saw that it was old and might have once been beautifully decorated. There were crumbling portraits on the wall, some still, other moving so slow that Harry thought they must be feeling lethargic. The arches above him at one time may have been impressive with shining, dark stained wood. Now they looked a little grey and rotted, the teak paint peeling and floating in flecks to the ground.
Wanting this over now, Harry sent his vines rushing forward mercilessly. To tear and shred. To slice and carve.
‘The castle is pleasant at night, but in daylight it’s truly stunning.’ Albus said merrily as Harry gaped at moving portrait that waved at him.
The creature moved in its own dark blur. Like a plume of smoke, it shifted then formed again now ten paces away from Harry.
The weeks following that didn’t offer much more in the way of clues. No more tracks, though thankfully no more dead mares either. The beasts were more skittish than usual around Hagrid, though it was to be expected. Even with all that life growing deep in the forest, there was still a threat in the air.
‘It was too long ago for you to remember it.’ Albus tried to comfort the confused child. ‘And you have been lost for such a long time, Harry.’ Albus let out a ragged breath, memories crashing within him. He had to tap down the urge to embrace the child, lest he spook the flighty boy.
It was so different from his own home; it was filled to the brim with strange items and materials Harry had never seen before. He traced his hands over strange fabrics and bowls with handles that had curious things painted on their surface.
‘What were they called?’ Harry asked, and a sadness had crept into the tone. It broke Albus’ heart that that it was the first emotion he had voiced.
The other creatures that normally scurried and tittered here and there were now horribly silent. He clambered down the tree, berries in tow and landed with a practised, soft thud on the forest floor. He carefully placed the bowl down, his eye flicking from side to side, watching – waiting. He never let his back turn away from the tree and kept within a few paces of the colt who was now breathing harshly.
Remus Lupin was by all accounts, a rather strange man. Or at least, strange in the way that he regarded Harry. Lupin looked at Harry as if he knew him, as if he had already forged a close relationship with Harry that he’d forgotten about.
Stickes glanced at the dead bodies behind them. He stood and held his arms out and waited for the boy to grip onto him. The boy’s small hand reached up and Stickes hauled him up gently. They boy was too light for his age.
He still watched it closely, transfixed. The huge beast made an insane amount of noise as it walked around the space. Harry’s chest loosened a little when the creature had bent down to pick up a wayward chicken and stroked its feathers.
It happened after Potions class too, only this time Draco was sure he was being wilfully ignored for nefarious reasons.
Harry’s power did not feel like that, his was like a living nightmare. He felt the keen differences at they clashed. Harry’s power destroyed; it ate at everything until nothing but the husk was left. The creatures power instead
The boy then scaled the somewhat terrified Wizard and pinched his nose, which earned him a choked, startled shout from Severus. Then the boy pulled at his hair before wiping his hands on Severus’ shoulders with an appalled noise that sounded like
He hadn’t been daring enough to leave the cover of the trees then. But now he had found the pale creature again, and with it, the scent of lemon soap.
Harry had nabbed a strange bristle thing that the creature swept over the horses hides and hair with. He tried brushing his own arms and head, but it was rather painful and not as enjoyable at the mares made it seem.
What made it worth the effort was the look on the huge, hairy creature afterwards. He seemed to beam constantly – Harry found himself doing much the same as he watched from the treetops. Although Harry sometimes watched the creature staring out into the distance as if searching for something.
On the fourth and final night of waiting. Draco crossed the enclosure to where he had last seen the boy. Above him, the trees clasped above him, as if they wanted to snatch him up. He couldn’t see far in, the space between the trunks was pitch black and there was no light this far in.
Jonah laughed humourlessly. ‘The stars tell you that?’ He cradled the infant to his chest a little tighter.
There was a strange look on Albus’ face, and Hagrid thought he knew why. With the same care Hagrid had just taken, Albus slowly neared with his palms out and facing upwards.
Minerva practically squealed with tinkling laughter as the boy unraveled her hair – which was highly uncharacteristic of the stern Deputy Head. ‘You’re a breath of fresh air, aren’t ye?’ She cooed.
‘Tha’ way’s th’ hut.’ Hagrid confirmed. ‘He’s the one.’ He said with a grin blooming on his features.
typically with a weapon or restraining devices like a snare or net. The objective is to catch the prey, one way or the other. I mean, I knew some people didn’t partake, but Severus I am surprised that you have not heard of the activity! It’s rather good for the legs and lungs I must say-.’
Harry nodded with a frown. He then twisted his hand before clenching it, his magic spiralled towards the clay, a pot formed from it – though it was somewhat ugly in comparison to Lupin’s cups.
After that, he couldn’t seem to help himself. Draco snuck out the castle ever night after in in very much the same manner. Draco would arrive, hide, try to keep quiet, would watch the boy tend to the mares, sometimes he’d risk helping him, and Draco would stew.
‘No you won’t, old friend.’ Firenze said into the air, holding the child closely. He brushed the babes cheek and smiled. ‘But that’s alright.’
The Professor then walked over to the beach wood and hauled it out of the wall before casting a flurry of magic which repaired the wall quickly.
Currently, he was balancing on a beam in a windy tower. Across from him, he could see another tower with a dark roof that seemed to hold hundreds of birds. He’d hidden away up here when he had saw a dark shape move among the birds from the tower window. His reflexes had him jumping and grabbing the beam before he could think much of it. Harry was glad that he had; the tower had then filled with a group of young girls a little older than he was. They were loud and now he was too cautious to move in case they, or any other student, saw him from the large arch ways they stood next to.
The forest helped where she could. Two winters past he’d probably have died from hunger had she not led the odd unsuspecting squirrel and rabbit his way. But still, he’d been miserable and had lost too much weight. It took an age to harden his body after that winter, so he’d stayed hungry for longer. And in this place, he couldn’t afford such a weakness, not with the other predators all too happy to make
‘Any idea as to what might be causing this Rubeus?’ Albus asked whilst staring at the flowers he’d just picked up.
He slowly edged to his left, letting his magic swirl and swoop at his side; ready and waiting to lash out.
Harry, covered in dirt and dust them clambered through the hatch door before seating himself in chair opposite a wide eyed Dumbledore.
At first Harry thought he only looked after the Unicorns until he got a glimpse inside the hut while the creature was off tending to the Thestral’s. Eggs, nests, hay, and big clear bowls filled with water. All of them had an animal or creature of sorts inside them and the hut was
The creatures power danced within him in a lurching, sickly rhythm. Though it didn’t move, merely trembled with wide eyes and gasping breaths.
To their right, a large clock chimed. Harry swayed on his feet slightly and his eyes felt very heavy.
The child pivoted quickly, his face lighting up in surprise at the blooms spreading and climbing around him. He bubbled with delighted laughter then.
rhyme were the same melody. In another flash, the awful squeak of chalk on slate as Albus figured out
Harry now knew what a teacup was, which cracked the egg of there being more than one type of cup wide open.
‘Yes.’ Albus confirmed when he gathered his wits, still somewhat dazed. ‘And what is your name?’ He tried.
Harry knew he couldn’t risk them in the fight that was about to come. He could taste an awful stench in the air that spoke of something corrupted and unnatural. The wolves hesitataed before they bowed their heads to him, baring their necks in respectful submission.
Harry kept obsessing over the fine details of these nuances and was quickly realising he might never discover them entirely.
The next day Draco was a ball of tension and anticipation. His fidgeting and snappishness had earnt him a few sideways glances from his friends, and deducted house points when he hadn’t minded himself in front of Professor Sprout.
‘Would he look after me like that too?’ Harry asked himself as he lay in the nest of blankets in his home. ‘…I’d hope so.’ Harry whispered.
How can you expect me to sleep, to walk freely without watching my back, to eat without a stomach upset knowing that thing is still out there terrorising the good people of Hogwarts!’
Draco senses were alight then; the air was crisp, cool and everything around him held such a silence that his ears rung. His own footfalls and quick breaths sounded awfully loud by comparison.
Hagrid let out a startled, joyful laugh at the boy’s nose nudging and cheek squishing. He had to carefully guide the boy’s hands away when he started pulling on Hagrid’s nose hair.
His mind now reeled through all of the precautions he should have taken. With each ‘what if’ the notion that he had aided and abetted the child’s death grew and twisted within him.
Withheld groans and bitten tongues were also instinctive by now. The mild amusement surrounding Stickes and his partners second name had been bled dry a few days after they’d been paired.
The scratches and gouges looked to have been caused by falling branches and a few falls during the night. Harry pinched his bridge and promised to reinforce the hairy creature’s fence after he returned the foals – he was not interested in a repeat performance.
‘Am no’ goin’ to hurt yeh.’ He repeated, seriously hoping the boy understood him. ‘Neither is tha’ sorry lot.’ He jerked his head behind him as he heard Snape huff.
The forest had always been a dark and dank place. Hardly anything grew in it. Often Hagrid’s walks through the place was accompanied by the foul stench of death and decay – the forest always had such little life in it.
Dark as pitch and it made the small hairs on Albus’ neck raise and unbidden thoughts of Ariana step forward from the shadows of his mind. It was an ancient kind of power, one that moved mountains and roamed deeper than even the eldest tree roots.
Hagrid was rambling and garbling when he all but hauled Albus into his hut after sending an urgent letter off to him - which he hardly ever did on account of his clumsy handwriting.
It should terrify him, but Albus didn’t typically pander to what was expected of him or even what he expected of himself sometimes.
This door was normally ignored because it looked somewhat unremarkable, especially as it was adorned by a massive tapestry of Relga the Rowdy, a rather large woman who seemed to enjoy drinking copious amount of sweet wine from a bull’s horn, surrounded by equally rambunctious knaves. The door, by comparison was simple and plain. Yet, it was an exit out of Hogwarts that no one seemed to take advantage of, except Draco.
It was akin to a Muggle piggy bank being tipped over; the boy was rummaging through his mind for valuable things that lay within it. Once he got over the shock of it, Albus thought the child might be looking through his memories. He was, in a sense – but the searching was disjointed, flighty, with nothing to connect the frog jumps the boy made between flashes of Albus’ recollections.
this is amazing!’ Harry rushed, his voice still sounding largely unemotional and it contradicted the wide eyes and massive grin on his features. ‘How did you – can I? Can you teach me to-?’ The boy garbled as he spun and plucked at violets and lilacs.
He stared at the entrance and his surrounding a little longer; such a space should have been impossible. The tower had been too narrow to hold anything this wide. Where Harry was standing now should have been where the tower staircase stood.
With a nod Harry let his magic explore the wood, then with a smile, it sharpened to a pike before Harry threw it into the wall behind them.
Minerva then threw her hands up in exasperation, knowing that Albus had already made his decision. And despite himself, Snape was somewhat excited – if only for the new and strange potion ingredients.
With that thought, Harry pulled on his hair, then began to run his fingers through it, clearing off the dirt and leaves. After his skin had turned somewhat numb from the icy water, Harry moved to the bank, shaking off the water and summoning his red robe with a flick of the wrist. Once covered, he made the careful walk back to his hut. There was a good amount of light today – a rare occasion in the forest. So when Harry arrived, he took up his carving knife and stone file before sitting on the hut step and began tending to his spears and shivs – a task which demanded a lot of visibility and concentration, lest he lose of thumb.
As usual the new Quidditch teams had to be formed in the first month of school. Draco was approached by the new Slytherin captain Urquhart, who told him to show up for try-outs.
“I do like it. I mean, of course it was hard at first. All those new people and the new school… But the girls were really welcoming. And the best thing is that no-one really knows much about the war. No-one was giving me dark looks because of my family’s allegiance or what I did. I could start over and just be myself. No pressure, no expectations.”
“Come on, Harry. It’ll be fun. He even got McGonagall to give her okay. You have to come. For the sake of inter-house-unity.”
And indeed, as soon as they rounded the corner they could see them, guarding the poor Muggle-borns that sat huddled together on stone benches. Some were alone, others accompanied by their families. A woman looked up and gasped when she saw Ron.
Draco noticed that he hadn’t lowered his wand. He was still pointing it right at Fletcher, who cowered before him. Draco couldn’t fault him. Sirius looked bloody intimidating.
Harry pulled his mouth away, but continued to stroke him through his orgasm. Draco collapsed into the cushions and Harry moved back up to lie beside him. "Sorry, I guess that was.." he started to say.
Harry had to break the kiss, gasping for air. A shudder went through him every time they rubbed against each other and he couldn't hold back the little noises spilling from his lips. Frotting – his mind supplied helpfully, in a voice that sounded suspiciously like Sirius. He buried his face in Draco's neck to hide his grin. He was so not going to think about his godfather right now.
Harry looked towards the church as well. Or more likely towards the graveyard beyond. Draco could see him shiver. “Yes, I… I’d like to… yes.”
Daphne hesitated a moment, but then she shrugged and climbed onto his bed as well. So much for stuffy pureblood upbringing. Her parents obviously hadn't done a good job of teaching her manners.
Draco quickly looked away and prayed that he wasn't blushing. "We talked a little yesterday. He's probably thinking about that. Or it could just be the bond." he claimed.
Harry took a deep breath to steel himself. Then he opened the stopper and poured the memory into the pensieve. Draco grabbed his hand. They shared a last look and plunged into the memory together…
Ron and Hermione immediately went to join the rest of the Weasley family, who was gathered together on the side. Fred had a deep gash on his forehead and George’s arm was in a sling. Mr. Weasley’s head was heavily bandaged. But at least they were all alive.
"I thought we could have a little picnic." the blond explained, silently cursing his pale complexion. He just knew that he was blushing.
Draco knew that it was no use arguing with her. And if he were in her shoes, he wouldn’t want to be left behind either.
Thanks for the lovely Reviews. And sorry I made you wait so long for the next chapter. I've been pretty busy with work. Of course more comments might inspire me to write faster next time....
“No!” Sirius yelled suddenly. “I don’t believe it. Snape must have done something to manipulate that memory.”
Remus’ voice took on a different tone as he finally started murmuring incantations. Harry tried to concentrate on the words, but found that he couldn’t. The voice sounded like it was coming from far away and he couldn’t understand what it was saying. The air around him seemed to be getting colder. The blackness behind his closed eyelids was absolute. He could no longer feel the hard floor beneath himself or Draco’s warmth next to him.
Ron and Hermione of course wanted to hear none of that and got exasperated whenever he mentioned Draco. They just didn't get it. But as the weeks wore on, they were too busy with their own lives to admonish him much. Ron seemed permanently glued to Lavender's lips nowadays and Hermione threw herself into schoolwork even more than usual. Which left Harry with a lot of free time. He used it constructively, by following Draco around school underneath his invisibility cloak or watching his dot moving around on the Marauder's Map.
“Remember two years ago, when you wanted me to stay in hiding, instead of coming back to Hogwarts?” Sirius asked.
At least he had destroyed the first Horcrux and the old headmaster had destroyed the next one shortly before the start of term. But that meant there were still four left.
“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it. It means… living beyond death. Living after death.” Draco tried to explain.
He’d thought choosing truth would be the lesser evil. But when Corner had grinned and asked: “How did it feel to have he-who-shall-not-be-named living in your house? Sharing your meals with him and seeing his face every day?” he’d known that he had been wrong. The Ravenclaw had probably been hoping that he would feel ashamed. Or maybe he’d been hoping Draco would sprout some death eater / pureblood nonsense about having been honoured, so he could say “See, I’ve told you. He’s still a bloody death eater”. He couldn’t have known that his words would trigger a flashback.
“Not that we know of.” Padma said. “Of course it might have resurfaced and whoever found it either didn’t recognize it or wanted to keep it for themselves.”
Or he could let it continue, consequences be damned. Harry was bloody gorgeous, with his intense green eyes and crooked smile. You’d have to be blind not to notice that. And there was also the fact that Draco had harboured a secret crush on the Gryffindor ever since fifth year.
Draco hugged him back, incredibly relieved that he'd finally told Harry and that it didn't change anything between them. He had been so scared it would make things awkward, especially considering the Gryffindor's reaction when he'd woken up in Draco's bed that one time. But the younger boy really didn't seem bothered at all. He sprawled over the blond's bed, like he often did when they were talking.
Harry risked a glance at Draco, who was sitting there, staring off into space. "So… do you know anything about these.. bonds?" he asked tentatively.
“Malfoy?” Harry muttered, sitting up slowly, forcing the blond to move back a bit. Again something tugged on his wrist. He glanced down to see what it was. And then he blinked. And blinked again. But the picture didn't change. His right wrist was chained to Malfoy's left one with handcuffs. Handcuffs lined with fluffy pink fur.
Harry could have lain there like that forever, but their quiet reverie was broken all too soon, when they heard voices nearby. And it took him only a moment to recognize them.
“What are you already doing up?” he wondered. Daphne and her girlfriend were usually among the last to arrive.
Remus unease grew with each step, but still the expected ambush didn't come. At least not in any form expected. When they rounded the corner however, they were suddenly faced with a dragon. It was blocking access to the deepest vaults. His scales were pale, his wings folded close to his body and his eyes milky pink. He seemed at least half-blind. There were heavy cuffs around his rear legs, chaining him to the floor with thick chains.
Draco winced and said nothing. Harry was right. It had been bad. Very bad. It had triggered the worst nightmare he’d had in months. Though he doubted that this had been their intention.
The dragon flew on and finally landed on a distant bank. Harry and Draco swam to the opposite shore. Luckily the water wasn't deep and soon they were able to stand and wade towards the grassy bank.
“It’s okay. Draco brought us here as soon as we’d seen the Death Eaters.” Harry assured. “But what took you so long? You didn’t stay back to look for us until now, did you?”
“We still won’t have much time. She usually checks in with Ginny and me before she goes to bed. But this is probably the last chance we’ll get to talk privately before tomorrow.”
“Do you think we can get away with staying out here for a while?” Harry cut in, before they could start an argument.”
He started avoiding Harry when one of them was wearing the locket, hoping to prevent more ugly fights. He already had more than enough of those with the others. He didn’t want to start arguing with his boyfriend again as well. Being cooped up in the small cottage had been bad enough before. But with the added stress of the Horcrux in their possession, tempers were flaring even worse.
“It means that Slytherin is associated with the Dark Lord now. People will be wary, possibly even hostile towards all Slytherins this year. So if Blaise and Daphne want to have any chance of being accepted, they need to distance themselves from me.”
And before Harry had a chance to protest, or ask who the hell Aberforth was, more people started arriving. Fred and George, followed by Ginny, Cho and their friend Lee Jordan. They were all looking at Harry expectantly, wanting to know what the plan was.
The red-head grabbed a vial from his bedside table and held it out to him. “Pomfrey told me to give you this. Dreamless Sleep. She said you need to swallow the whole vial.”
So yes, nothing much had happened yet. But now that the idea was out there, he realized that he quite liked the thought of them showering together. It sounded like just the thing to take his mind off what had happened.
Harry shifted until he was sitting more comfortably, before closing his eyes and starting to take deep, even breaths, like Narcissa had shown him. The first time he’d tried this, he hadn’t been able to concentrate at all. Stray thoughts kept popping up, distracting him. And he hadn’t really gotten much better after a few tries, which was probably why he hadn’t practised more.
Hermione took pity on Draco and urged Harry to open his presents. She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. He also got an enchanted razor, a bunch of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products and lots of sweets. Hagrid was pretty much the last guest to arrive. He presented Harry with a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin in there and no-one but the owner can get it out.” he explained and Harry almost immediately started a mental list of things he wanted to put into the pouch.
Harry felt incredibly tired, now that the excitement was wearing off and his paw no longer hurt. So he didn't protest when Malfoy carried him out of the bathroom and put him down on a comfortable armchair. He yawned and curled up, falling asleep within minutes.
Thicknesse nodded and went on his way. Out of the corner of his eye Draco saw the door to Umbridge's office open and close, signalling that Harry had left it.
There was just no arguing with Neville when he was on a mission. Harry didn’t like being around a lot of people, especially since his powers had started going crazy. But there had been no outbursts lately, so maybe he was finally getting better. And maybe it would be fun. Now he just had to convince Draco to come, too.
“I know. And I feel bad about it. It was just so cool to finally be good at Potions, after years of having to endure Snape's taunts.” Harry mumbled.
Kingsley reported that other Death Eaters had forced their way into every house that was somehow connected to the Order. A few people had been tortured, but nothing too bad. A handful of Death Eaters were also on stake-out in front of Grimmauld Place, but so far Mad-Eye’s protections held and they couldn’t get into the house. Just to be safe, Harry called for Kreacher and ordered him to flee and hide at Hogwarts should any strangers enter Grimmauld Place.
It was Saturday and he didn't feel like working on the house, so he decided to visit Teddy instead. Andromeda had assured him that he could stop by whenever he liked, without having to call first, so he simply apparated to her house and knocked on the door. Andromeda welcomed him with a smile, like she always did. Even if she looked a bit apprehensive this time.
“I believe so, yes. It'll still be dangerous. We don't really know what to expect and there's a high possibility we'll get caught. But that never stopped you.”
“But we didn't. I got us out!” he yelled back, trying to hold back the laughter that was threatening to bubble out of him.
Draco felt a vindictive pleasure at having reformed another member of the Dumbledore fan-club. And he knew that unlike her brother, Ginny wasn’t likely to forgive the old man any time soon. That girl could hold a grudge.
The next week brought a welcome surprise for once. The Aurors had encountered four death eaters at Malfoy Manor. And one of them had been Peter Pettigrew. After being questioned by Kingsley Shacklebolt and head Auror Rufus Scrimgeour for the better part of a day, he had finally admitted his part in the deaths of James and Lily Potter and proven Sirius innocence.
Knowing this was as good as he was going to get, the Gryffindor nodded. "Alright. See you tomorrow."
The blond got up and started the kettle for more tea, while Harry looked through the pantry for something edible. He found a couple of eggs and some bread and quickly got a pan out, all the while stealing glances at Draco when he wasn't looking. The eggs were okay, but the bread was old and hard. It said a lot about their situation that Draco ate without complaint.
He was expecting the Gryffindor to duck his head or maybe even defend the girls. He wasn't expecting the dopey grin that appeared on his face. Then he realized what exactly he'd said.
“Thank you, Malfoy.” Granger replied, the first to find her voice again. “I can't say that I'm just going to forgive and forget, but I appreciate it and I accept your apology. And I hope to … get to know you better in the future. I'm sure we can put our differences aside.”
Harry craned his head to look at Lovegood. He had already noticed the strange symbol around his neck earlier, but he had no idea what it meant.
Bill was still in the hospital wing. His scars looked bad as ever, but aside from an appetite for rare steaks he seemed completely unchanged. The Ministry was looking for Snape and Nott, but they had obviously gone into hiding and Harry doubted they'd find them any time soon.
“Well, yes and no. Our ultimate goal is for you to get it all off your chest, instead of bottling it up like you've been doing so far. But I fear that forcing you to talk about some things before you are ready will only cause another outburst.” she explained.
They dashed through empty corridors and down the great marble staircase. Draco lost sight of Harry for a moment, but kept running, following the odd blood splatter on the floor. He ran past portraits full of alarmed people and confused students in dressing gowns, down another staircase. There were shouts and noises all around, but the Slytherin ignored them, completely focused on finding Harry again and realizing too late that his boyfriend must have taken one of his shortcuts.
Lifting a bow, Harry had an arrow aimed for its head and followed it as the creature walked, staring at the ground.
Soundlessly he rushed forward, his feet barely touching the ground as eight pairs of eyes watched on hungrily.
But somehow Malfoy had gotten lost and Hagrid had only realised it when he'd heard the poor boy yelp.
Harry watched carefully as a pale hand reached to the shiv and then slowly pulled it out. The sound of metal scraping against bone and bloodied flesh was the
Stickes then grabbed a blanket from the linen cupboard at the foot of the bed, plus a few changes of clothes for him.
how interested in those creatures he was to the others. His curiosity brimmed under the surface of his skin, begging him to follow the second creatures’ path north-east and discover more about it and these
At this the boy softly untangled himself from Minerva and approached a quickly paling Potions Professor.
And this creature did not have teeth, claws, or blades to defend itself with. It made Harry grin sharply.
Lily had shook, holding back tears when she recounted the insidious nature of what she had felt from her babe. And she had feared the worst.
‘I would invite you to discuss this matter with Albus, I don’t think it’s my place to tell you.’ Lupin gave Harry another downturned smile.
There was blood in its lungs, and it was still fighting with a weapon that looked so much like Harry’s. Harry pulled at the bow, an arrow sank into its thigh.
‘But…’ Harry struggled to gather his thoughts. ‘Hagrid wouldn’t. He’d help.’ Harry tried, looking down at the colt imploringly.
‘Aye. I’ve asked th’ centaurs and the spiders. They don’ ‘ave a clue what’s out there. But they're sure something is.’
‘Second, is that although you do not need a wand, you do need to keep up appearances, for appearances sake.’
‘I was hoping that you could manipulate the beach wood in the same manner you did with the dead roots when we first met you.’ Lupin said as he gestured for Harry to try.
‘You can see it?’ Albus asked Harry, but it sounded as if he was talking to himself more than Harry.
Its screeching was unlike any creature Harry had met before. It had a face, but its black cloth hid its feature in shadow.
‘I’m not sure I’ll sleep well otherwise.’ Cross looked over his shoulder to where the pithy magic felt as if it could choke them. ‘I don’t know what that is, but it’s like no child I’ve ever seen – or adult. Inside and outside missions.’ Cross stared unseeingly.
Harry was most concerned with this person. Not only did he smell a little like the creature Harry had fought in the Forest, he also hid himself behind careful words.
Harry warily followed, the door that revealed itself had a thick layer of the strange magic blanketing it.
He took a big dollop of it and tentatively reached out the boy’s side. The little one flinched slightly before stepping closer, giving Hagrid the go-ahead.
‘I would. They are far more helpful.’ Harry’s leg was swinging as he ate more of Colther’s favourite fruit.
Even Aragog respected the man and called him ‘Hagrid’ in their strange clicking language. The spiders weren’t allowed to touch Hagrid, who Aragog had named
Firenze smiled right back at him. ‘Go.’ He ordered. ‘Go do all that sunbathing you kept griping on about as a teen. You are far to pale for a man your age.’
Not bothering to grab anything from the hut, he clambered through the grass and over the incline. His legs were shaky from the amount of work he had to put in recently. Harry’s whole body had been wishing to rest for
The forest had that morning given him a hen that still needed plucking and an old rabbit that had died but was still warm to the touch. That same rabbit was carefully skinned and now hung in the hut, ready for stew.
'Yes - I mean - it was dark...and there were shadows - it looked like that to me.' The normally self-assured boy stuttered on.
Little Andrew rolling in his own cot overlaid the scene in front of him, and his heart was breaking.
Albus watched all of this with a strange feeling inside his chest. The sensation flooded his gut a little when Remus neared him with a vexed expression.
‘It’s not as good as yours like, bu’ it does th’ trick.’ Hagrid said before he gestured a rubbing motion at the boy’s side, holding up the tub. ‘Wan’ me to give it a go?’
Draco waited for hours over several days, and there was neither hide nor hair of the boy, his strange colourful muck, his red wool, or his hissed words.
‘In the Forest Albus?’ Minerva probed gently but resoundingly skeptical. ‘I doubt none, except perhaps Hagrid, would last too long that deep within the Forest - never mind a
After that Hagrid kept searching, always had an eye out whenever he done his rounds. There were more instances of strange but ultimately welcome occurrences.
Harry let out a sigh of relief when the strange markings on the front of the book made sense to him.
He saw the distressed look on the large creature’s face and realised that he wanted to but couldn’t.
The boy was so small, so thin and dirty as Stickes slowly raised a shaking wand. The boy wasn’t even looking at him. It was better that way, Stickes couldn’t bear to meet the boys eyes.
Harry shook his head quickly, and then forced his weary legs to straighten out, and with a sharp nod he began the arduous task of rounding up the beasts.
His pack were as his side in a flash, circling him. Their noses brushes against his legs, checking for wounds and yipping when they found none.
Hagrid passed him the slice of wood he’d cut. The headmaster took it calmly, with a furrowed brow, like it was a puzzle he’d never encountered before.
The headmaster's brows rose to his hairline. He turned it in his hands, his own magic seeking and probing.
Peering into the darkest part of the space, Harry realised that it went on. Then, on one hand he was happy that he had a path to follow, on the other, he wasn’t too keen on sinking into that dark, foreboding space.
James and Lily were experienced in defensive arts. Merlin, they had seen the worst of Harry’s turbulent magic and had
‘And bloody freezing.’ Harry breathed, still watching the massive creature stomp through the trees far ahead them.
Severus was silent and blearily staring at the embers in front of him. Passing him, Albus sat on the adjacent overstuffed chair, the feather down stabbed his back a little.
‘Of course you’d say that, you mad bastard.’ Harry shook his head as he donned a woven basket, tying it around his waist before stuffing some arrows into the back of his robes.
It returned to a hut that looked like Harry’s. What stunned him was that Harry had found the Forest’s end – something he’d never even thought of before. There were no trees here. Just fields, a huge body of water and a massive stone structure, impossibly tall, straight and lit from within.
He kept his eyes flickering from side-to-side. He knew that the teachers could be crawling around these parts and if he weren’t careful, detention would be the least of his worries.
There was no answer. Harry would have laughed it off as another one of Colther’s attempt to avoid manual labour.
Harry wiped the back of his hand against his forehead, sweat was soaking his eyelashes and stung his eyes. Hunched over a deep stone bowl filled with pulp he’d ground down with his own fists, Harry found his arms and back aching. His throat was dry, and he was elbow deep in foul innards, ivy mush, and red spore from in-season stinkhorn fungus. He stared at the jug of water longingly as the mulch squished between his palms and fingers.
A few days later the young male was walking about, still limping, but stronger – the bone was bloody-well
‘Naw.’ Stickes Scottish accent shone through best when he was pissed. ‘You gonnae’ tell me why ‘am here at three in the fuckin’ mornin’ Davie. I took leave for a reason.’ He mumbled.
Hagrid’s mind turned over day and night. The prints were random at best, they didn’t seem to lead anywhere, they certainly didn’t point in any direction – which had caused the half-giant a tender scalp from all his scratching.
Now intrigued, Draco made his way over to the brewing area, a space which he was typically forbidden to enter. Snape simply looked too far gone to notice Draco at that moment in time, so like any good Slytherin, Draco took advantage of Severus’ wayward attention. Attention that should have been laid upon Draco.
The snake seemed to regard him for a moment before answering. ‘One of your kind. The beings beyond the forest.’
‘No – he knows the ques though.’ Remus said as he stared at the boy laughing as Hagrid tickled under his chin. ‘He looks just like James.’ He said suddenly, as if the thought rushed through him.
Draco had whined after the third attempt to capture the Professor’s attention. ‘You’re not listening!’
Harry then dropped down into the room, his body tense. With one eye on the door Harry moved through the room, following the scent of citrus to one of the beds.
He wanted to close his eyes for a few moments, but he never could. There were too many things out there that could be watching him, and he always had to stare right back.
do, if you wish, we will discuss something akin to lessons and future plans in the morning. Though, perhaps after breakfast. I find myself a tad flummoxed without a good few pieces of toast in me, hm?’
Draco watched him pounce after it, each time he went to grab the bar of soap, it slid between his palms.
‘Nothing good.’ Minerva added grimly. ‘The Auror’s – absolute cowards that they are – will not step one foot in those woods if something happens Albus. You’re more the fool for considering it.’ She stated sharply.
‘Here, wee man.’ Stickes approached slowly with a soft voice. ‘You want your mummy and daddy?’ He cooed shakily, tears running tracks down his cheeks.
But then a slight movement caught his eye, and in the distance a herd of roe deer grazing in the summer heat. The nearest wolf turned to him, her tail wagging.
But after many, many hours searching over the last fortnight – Hagrid hadn’t find a bloody thing except these little prints scattered everywhere. They were human, but smaller than he’d expected. The footfalls didn’t match the size of the bite marks on the mare’s neck. Well-unless the beastie had and oversized mouth or thumpin’ great hands. The tracks always went cold after thirty paces or so, like the being simply stopped, stood, and then
Harry was then met with a room filled with boys his age, dressed in black and green. He was above them, in one of the arcs that made up the roof above their beds. Immediately below him were thick beams of dark wood, like those he’d seen in the dark space before, only these were polished to a shine and lights hung from them.
Dumbledore couldn’t have foreseen this; he had thought them safe from the proverbial wolves at their door. But to discover the wolf had been among them this entire time was hard to swallow – and wholly unbelievable.
"We will. We'll think of something." Draco promised. "But right now I'm actually more worried about you. Have you eaten anything at all today?"
Everyone was either looking at Harry or staring at their plate and a strange silence had settled over the group. Draco shifted uneasily in place, suddenly missing the inane chatter and loud noise from before.
Without pause Bogrod pulled a metal instrument from his bag and started making horrible noise with it. The dragon recoiled, trembling in fear. When they passed him, Remus saw scars made by vicious slashes across his face. They reminded him of his own scars and he felt sorry for the poor beast. Then he caught Sirius looking at the dragon speculatively.
Of course things only got worse in Transfiguration, where he had to sit next to Draco. The blond was still giving him those looks and even dared to put his hand on Harry's arm. The younger boy jerked away violently and put more distance between them. Draco huffed and turned away and Harry could feel his frustration through the bond. Great, maybe he'd stop messing with him now.
“I'm only saying you should take the threat he poses a little more seriously. Be careful and watch your back. We all know he won't attack you openly, but he might try to stage a little accident or something.” Zabini reasoned.
“Better not. Someone from the village might see the light and come to investigate.” Harry cautioned.
"Death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year's league. I confess, I would prefer a quick, painless exit."
Draco got up from where he'd been sitting, with his back to the wall, when Harry finally emerged from Dumbledore's office. The younger boy looked pale and shaken. And surprised to see him. He obviously hadn't noticed the blond running after him earlier in his mad flight from the Great Hall.
Draco stifled a sigh. He should have known. Especially after Longbottom had followed him to his room, to make sure he was okay and apologize on behalf of the others.
Sirius and Remus would camp out in the garden with Hagrid. After a lengthy discussion, Harry and Draco were allowed to share a cot in Ron’s room. Mrs. Weasley wasn’t too pleased with this solution. She felt it would be improper for them to sleep together on a tiny cot and had made a lot of fuss. Sirius’ reasoning that they “are hardly going to shag with Ron only a foot or so away” did little to appease her. But when Harry had suggested that they could also share the tent with Sirius and Remus, she had quickly declared it better for them to sleep in Ron’s room.
“We should see if the others are back yet and tell them the good news.” he finally changed the topic.
The red-head cast a glare in Draco's direction, but when Harry prodded again he reluctantly pulled out the Deluminator. “With this. We sort of... heard your voice. And it was coming out of this. But it didn't look any different. So I clicked it and the light in the room went out, but another light appeared. It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing and bluish. It was just sort of … hovering in the air. And then it drifted towards me and touched my chest and … it went inside me. And I knew that it would take me where I needed to go. So we disapparated.”
“Okay.” Draco agreed, blushing slightly. “I mean, I’ve got to make sure you don’t fall on your ass, right?”
Was Malfoy actually trying to reassure him now? The Slytherin took another step closer. Harry could feel the warmth radiating from his body and suddenly found it hard to breathe.
He had to take a deep breath, before continuing. “I was her favourite. Not Albus.” he seemed very proud of that fact. “He was always up in his room, counting his prices and corresponding with the important people of the time. He didn’t want to be bothered with her. Then, when she was fourteen … See, I wasn’t there. I could have calmed her down, but… She had one of her rages. She couldn’t control it. It was an accident and .. my mother got killed. Albus came home for the funeral and settled down as head of the family. I’d have looked after her, but he refused. Told me to finish my education. He’d take over. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant.” Aberforth snorted.
Draco sighed in defeat and allowed the younger boy to pull him along, grumbling slightly under his breath. The things he did for that boy...
He’d known. Of course he’d known. Thanks to the ritual there really were no more secrets between them. But knowing and actually hearing Harry say the words were two vastly different things. “And I love you, Harry.” he replied softly.
He broke off as shouts and the obvious sounds of battle drew nearer. Seconds later Fred and Percy appeared, duelling two masked and hooded men.
Madam Pomfrey's yell prevented Draco from answering. The matron came bustling over and shooed him back into bed with a stern glare. "You will stay lying down until I've given you permission to get up. Understood?"
The blond nodded. And he knew that his decision was right. If only for the blinding smile the younger boy gave him.
“I contemplated returning your call, you know?” Draco muttered and Harry felt himself blushing. “But then I decided to drop by instead. I thought maybe you want to show me some of those things you talked about.” While he talked his fingers made quick work of Harry’s pants, opening the fly and pushing them down.
Harry turned away with a shudder and found Malfoy sitting in one of the squashy armchairs by the fire.
Remus placed another glass of water for each of them onto the bedside table, before ushering Sirius out of the room. Draco was glad to finally be alone with Harry. But he still hesitated slightly, before turning to face the younger boy.
Draco agreed with her. “Which explains why he couldn’t tell you in the will why he was leaving you these things.”
Somehow it felt like the fight had cleared the air between them. Harry found it easier to interact with the blond and even started using his first name after a while. Draco seemed surprised, but sometimes he slipped and called him Harry as well.
“Moony and I. We were already together before the war. But I wasn't big on talking either and with everything that was going on...”
And she wasn’t only funding the whole thing. When she wasn’t attending galas, where she managed to talk a lot of people into making big donations for the cause, she was at the manor constantly. She managed the day-to-day business, made sure everything ran smoothly, tended to the gardens and took care of the kids. Everybody loved her and she seemed truly happy whenever she could help. Draco had once said to Harry that she’d finally found her true calling. Andromeda helped at the manor a lot as well. She said it made the loss of her husband easier to bear.
“No, Kreacher. You can go back to Grimmauld Place if you like. Thank you for your help. You did great tonight.”
“Hello, we're here to buy our school books. We need two copies of Advanced Transfiguration Grade Seven, the Standard Book of Spells Grade Seven and Advanced Potion-making Grade Seven.” he told the clerk, before turning to look at Draco. “Do you need anything else?”
He wasn’t sure if Harry would be okay with them knowing. But he’d already said too much. Ginny wouldn’t back down until he told her.
Unfortunately it could. The two girls were playing tug-o-war with some sort of package, until it fell to the ground. Seconds later Katie rose into the air gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she were about to fly. Her eyes were closed and her face empty of expression. There was something really eerie about the whole thing. Harry and the others had stopped dead in their tracks and were simply staring at her. Then she opened her eyes and started screaming.
“The point is that it’s stereotypical Slytherin behaviour. Being seen with you is bad for my reputation, so I stay away. I’m not supposed to care if you have a hard time. I have to do what’s good for me, no matter the consequences. That’s what they all think of us Slytherins, isn’t it? That we do things only if there’s profit for us. That we betray each other if there’s something to gain. And we prove them right! Only three of us returned this year, Draco. Wouldn’t it have been better to stick together? The other houses did that. Why can’t we?”
He only had a second to admire the sudden glint in Harry's eyes, before he found himself pushed back against a shelf. Quidditch gear rained down around them, but before he could protest, Harry's lips covered his in a bruising kiss, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say and he was too busy kissing back to really care.
"Pansy, too. And I have to tell mother that it made the dark mark disappear. And I guess you'll want to talk to your godfather and …"
“Maybe not. But unlike you I was afraid of saying his name for a long time. You’ve used it since you were eleven.”
He remembered his fear and panic as he’d realized what was happening. Remembered the shocked looks of the Weasley family. The fear in their eyes. How they had all inched away from him. Their reaction had only made things worse. He’d fought so hard to bring his magic back under control, but it hadn’t worked. Not until Draco had shown up.
“Not completely straight. I never said everyone’s bisexual.” she corrected. “And I’m sure that I’m right about Harry. He quite obviously adores you. But without his friend Granger to help him he doesn’t realize it. I think you should give him a bit more time. Maybe wait until Christmas break is over. If he hasn’t started snogging you by then, you need to start courting him more openly. Not everyone understands subtlety, you know.”
They reached the altar and Sirius gave Harry a quick hug, before taking his seat next to Remus in the front row. Narcissa kissed Draco’s cheek and sat down next to Andromeda. Harry smiled at Draco, who smiled back, looking just as excited and nervous as Harry felt. A tall, slender witch stepped in front of them. She was wearing a simple, blue robe and her white hair cascaded down her back in a riot of wild curls. She smiled at both of them in turn, before starting to speak in a clear voice.
Harry had no idea why that admission cheered him up so much, but he couldn't deny that it did. He was probably just glad that he wasn't the only one with little experience here, he reasoned.
"At least we've come one step further." Remus reminded. “And I’ve brought all the books from Grimmauld Place that might have any mention on Horcruxes. So far I haven’t found anything useful on how to destroy it, but I’ve still got a few more to go through. Bill also sent two books I haven't even looked at yet. There’s got to be a way.” he said hopefully.
“I already said I’m trying! Do you think I want him in my head?!” Harry snapped. “Do you think it’s fun to see him torturing people?!”
Finally they reached the Great Hall and stopped in the doorway. The house tables were gone and the room was crowded. The injured were being treated by Madam Pomfrey and her helpers on the platform. The dead were lying in a row in the middle of the hall. Harry saw Remus and Tonks among them. And little Colin Creevey.
“I was disinherited, Harry. The wards don’t recognize me anymore. I felt it when they brought us in.”
Malfoy turned out to be surprisingly good company. They had seen each other regularly at Andromeda's and he would actually say that they were friends now. Harry appreciated the Slytherin's quick wit and wicked sense of humour. And his honesty, because only very few people were really honest with him these days. Even Neville seemed to be tiptoeing around him and Harry couldn't help but wonder what Hermione might have told the other boy.
Millie opened her mouth to protest, but the little girl beat her to it: “She can't come with you. She's busy.”
Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding, incredibly relieved by the answer. Maybe there was still hope for Draco.
He had no idea how much time went by like this. Only that it was too much in his opinion. Glancing around the table he noticed that he wasn't the only one worried. When he locked eyes with Sirius, the older man nodded and they both got up, heading to the garden. They found Harry and the Minister not far from the house. Scrimgeour had a stony expression on his face, while Harry looked pissed.
Harry was grateful when she ushered Ginny, Seamus and Dean out. Reluctantly he dragged himself out of bed. Ron and Draco followed suit.
As always the transformation had taken quite a toll on Remus and he would need a couple of days to recover. He was still confined to his bed on the second day after the full moon, so it was just Sirius and the kids at the breakfast table. Ron was finally well enough to move around freely and share the burden of the locket. Wearing it made him whiny and moody and he was prone to start complaining about every little thing. Draco had to give him a wide berth, otherwise he was scared he’d strangle the annoying red-head.
For a moment the blond seemed to waiver. Then he suddenly launched himself at Harry without warning. They crashed to the floor and the Gryffindor found himself with an armful of Draco Malfoy. Choked sobs were torn from Draco's throat as he clung to Harry desperately. The younger boy wrapped both arms around him and held him tight, murmuring soothing words. "Shh… it's okay. I've got you."
Hermione's shrill voice shook him out of his trance. She grabbed his arm and pulled him along. He stumbled after her blindly and didn't even notice Neville and Blaise following them. Millicent was in front, pushing people aside roughly.
He was surprised how sure his own voice sounded, when he felt so insecure and out of depth. Tentatively he reached out and put a hand on Draco's shoulder. The Slytherin flinched, but made no move to pull away.
The animagus dropped down beside him, looking Harry over worriedly. “What happened? Did the snake bite him?”
Unfortunately that whole stupid hero worship had only gotten worse. So Harry spent most of his free time hiding away in the eighth year common room, even if it meant that he had to endure all the happy couples there. Like Ron and Hermione. Or Ginny and Neville. Terry Boot and Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass and Blaise Zabini and so many others. Sometimes Harry felt like he was the only single wizard in their year left. Well, apart from Draco Malfoy.
But suddenly he was ripped off his feet and propelled into the air, where he hung upside down like a puppet. Immediately he started thrashing around wildly, screaming bloody murder, but he only managed to get tangled up in his robes. The surrounding students erupted into laughter, which only made him struggle more violently.
“You're right.” the blond finally agreed. Now they only had to hope that Harry's infamous luck didn't run out. But he kept that thought to himself.
When he left the Slytherin common room a few hours later, after having spent the better part of the morning tutoring not only two, but five hyperactive first years, he actually felt like himself again. It had been fun to spend time with the little ones and he’d only now realized how much he’d actually missed the Slytherin quarters. It also seemed like his house was slowly starting to accept him again.
“If anything, that showed me that I prefer boys.” the dark-haired boy said with a snort. And while he was at it, it was probably best to tell Ron everything. “I'm dating Draco.”
The younger boy nodded and they both landed back on the pitch. Draco shouldered his broom and was about to walk off, when Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him in the opposite direction.
Harry slumped down on the couch and started explaining. About the old Riddle house and arguing with Hermione, about the Snatchers and what had happened at Malfoy Manor. “It was all my fault.” he ended dejectedly.
Caught off guard, despite having anticipated something like this, Harry stammered around for a while, but in the end he somehow managed to tell her that he didn't want to continue their relationship at all. Things had changed. He had changed. Too much had happened. He wasn't the same boy who had fallen in love with her any more.
Ron helped Percy steady Fred and together they made their way down the corridor as fast as they could, with Harry, Draco and Hermione stunning every Death Eater they came across. Thanks to the injured Weasleys their pace was slow and for every Death Eater that fell, two new ones seemed to pop up.
Harry stared at the potion and felt his throat constricting. The night's events were catching up to him and he felt exhausted like never before. And yet the thought of sleeping terrified him, even if the potion would ensure that he wouldn't be plagued by nightmares. He didn't want to sleep. After all that had happened he didn't feel safe here any longer. What if the Death Eaters returned? What if he was needed?
Tonks stumbled inside and knocked down a goblet, jumping away when it started to sizzle and  multiply.
He tried not to squirm as he waited for the Slytherin to make the next move. He seemed to be shifting around on the bed, but Harry had no idea what he was doing.
Of course they did find Hermione in the library. Along with Millicent, Blaise, Luna and Neville. It really said something that their odd little group didn't receive curious stares any more. Lately Neville seemed to appear wherever Millicent was, so he had finally been let in on the secret of Voldemort's Horcrux. Draco couldn't really remember when exactly Luna had started joining them. She had just been there one day, like she had always been part of the group. Draco didn't mind. He was actually starting to like the weird girl.
The remaining four reached the first floor, only to come face to face not only with Thicknesse, the new Minister for Magic, but also Umbridge herself, who promptly demanded that Hermione/Mafalda accompany her down to the courtrooms for record-keeping. As the two disappeared from sight, Thicknesse turned to Harry.
Draco might as well save them both the trouble. “I filed the necessary forms to revert to Black along with my mother after my father died. We decided it was best to let the Malfoy name rest with him. When I married Astoria a few months later, our ceremony was in France and largely kept out of the papers.” Nerves caused him to fiddle with his watch before continuing, his voice lowered. “Scorpius doesn’t know. What went on with the war, not the details. I haven’t tried to hide my family’s sins, he knows we stay in mostly Muggle areas and shopping here in London since our family isn’t particularly well-liked. But he’s only five. There’s only so much I can explain right now until he’s older.” The breath Draco exhaled felt exhausting. “I’m not— I can’t ask you to shield him, or anything. I’d just like for Scorpius to have the opportunity for kids to get to know
Draco flicked his wrist and kissed him deeply, his free hand trailing along Harry’s bicep and squeezing the muscles with pleasure. “Sorry, Harry, but you leave me no choice,” he chuckled darkly. “Ta.”
“And before you start feeling too special, you not the first person who’s been targeted,” Malfoy muttered. “I’ve been handing out elixirs all week for — similar discretions.” He then bypassed the lifts to Level Nine and turned down a deserted hallway that Harry didn’t even know existed before today.
(His) Draco seems captivated by the ping pong argument in front of them, that is quickly ended when MV Harry shoves at Draco so he falls backwards but consequently takes Harry down with him. It looks like it hurts and Harry winces in sympathy.
Harry doesn’t give Draco a chance to fully wake up, he simply wraps his body around Draco and rolls them both over so they’re out of the way as the first Seeker crashes into the turf where they have just been, with the other team’s Seeker sliding off his broom to land on top in a heap. The blond Seeker from the Falcons raises his fist triumphantly from under his opponent. The crowd goes wild once everyone realises he’s caught the Snitch.
“Master Black is being late,” Nipsy interrupted, with a brown sack lunch in each hand, her sternness quite the contrast from her bright yellow dress. “
. While they lived their lives differently, they still had the same spectrum for emotions, ideas, and choices that could affect themselves and those around them, in both positive and negative ways. Mindful thinking always worked to pull him out of the swampy clutch of his old tendencies for nastiness, just like Mind Healer Bitterwood had advised at the beginning of his therapy. It kept Draco in check, helped him be a better person. A better father.
Surely no sane person could blame Draco for slapping Potter after daring to compare him to Granger for the second time in one day. His hair never looked that tragic or bushy.
Draco smirks, looking too proud of himself as he licks the dildo tip clean. The only thing ruining the Pensieve perfect moment for Harry is the quiet sounds of the tip jar pinging, repeatedly. No matter how tired he is, he could never be outdone by the other anonymous men watching. Draco needed to pay attention to
As Harry blinks through crooked glasses, he sees a bright sky and two Quidditch teams flying through the air overhead. Professional Quidditch teams. He recognises the colours of Puddlemere and the Falcons easily enough. They must have Apparated out of Draco’s lab and onto a random pitch, but Harry has no clue how.
“I guess you’re right.” He waits another few seconds before leaning over to hold onto Harry and turning the Time-Turner. They’re both blushing and carefully avoiding each other’s eyes when the loud moans reverberate through the ballroom.
“They’re not legos,” Scorpius tried to argue as he set the last of his buttered toast down, on the rim of the trunk. Unevenly, of course, so it fell inside the lego trunk immediately with a sticky plop that had Draco looking up at the ceiling to avoid the newest problem. Nipsy was going to be horrified.
Malfoy paused abruptly in front of an empty portrait, then tapped his wand on the frame’s edge so a hidden door would open. “Here. You won’t make it down to the labs, and I’m assuming you don’t want to cause a scene.”
Harry can feel his dick twitch valiantly just once before he groans and gives it a squeeze. He can’t go again just yet, but damn if his libido won’t try. Inexcusably lazy, Harry wipes his hand clean on his open flannel shirt, his wand too far for a Scourgify, his energy too depleted for wandless magic. They were edging for almost an hour tonight.
“Mr Potter,” Draco spoke up rudely, but necessary. “This is my son, Scorpius Black. He’ll be one of your students this year.”
— blushes the prettiest shade of pink Harry has seen yet and pushes him weakly in the chest. “Absolutely not, Potter.” He takes a step back so they aren’t breathing the same air and seems to collect himself. “You have to buy me dinner first.” Then, he turns and walks out with his hips swaying confidently. A temptation on two legs if Harry’s ever seen one.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, “I need you to decode this file and find a way to brew a reverse potion for my case. I need an antidote.”
The order was clear and Harry was obedient, his tongue lapping wide, lazy swathes across the fabric until it was clean. Once finished, Draco crawled up to kiss Harry’s mouth with the scarf between them before nuzzling into his throat.
It was a signal Harry usually found rude and pompous but was happy to see this time when it benefitted him.
. I’m in the middle of an experiment, and you’re going to ruin my timing and measurements.” Draco snaps.
There was absolutely no reason for him to be so far gone this early. It wasn’t until he felt the ghost of sensations trickling over his mind like gentle waters, like tendrils of smoke, that Harry realised Draco held him in a delicate state of Legilimency. He couldn’t afford to be knocked out on his back by the type of powerful orgasms he usually experienced under this sort of play. He hadn’t finished his clinic hours yet.
Harry rolls his eyes and pulls the Time-Turner out of Draco’s grasp, spinning it while Draco rushes to hold onto him as they leave for yet another universe.
“Yes, that wasn’t your fault. Like when you accidentally shrunk Auror Chang down to Niffler size after you two broke up.
“That’s absurd.” Almost a good enough reason to allow Draco to trample over Harry’s ‘no more sex at work’ rule.
“That—” If Harry were blindfolded, he’d swear someone’s lubed fingers were wanking him off, in tight, slow strokes. However, seeing as that was clearly not happening, his mind was justifiably shorting out.
MV Draco’s cold exterior melts away when he laughs at Harry’s antics, gently pushing him away as Harry grabs his book and tosses it on the floor. He whines about how he thought Ron would never leave and the fact that they can’t hide much longer. Draco rolls his eyes and grabs Harry’s tie to reel him in for a passionate snog.
Harry spun around quickly enough that he tripped over his own untied shoelaces. A fantastic impression to make on someone he hadn’t seen in months. Since Malfoy's — no — Draco’s trial. And now he was here. “You’re here.”
“No. Can’t do it.” Harry could be firm in the face of Draco’s flirting and slippery fingers; he could ignore how his robes were unbuttoned at a leisurely pace.
“Yes, yes, listen to the charming saviour of Witch Weekly. Out of here now,” Draco ordered, gesturing wildly with his cane and uncomfortably close to smacking both Harry and Mrs Mulberry with it.
“Except that you can.” Draco’s voice was silky now as he stepped in closer to Harry, playful fingers tracing up the seam of his lime green robes.
Draco prepared himself for the worst. To spend the rest of the school year hiding his face in shame, behind a veil of black lace, to show proof of his contrition.
Draco laughed, the noise clear and bright and bubbly. Not mean spirited for the first time — ever really. It was attractive, Harry realized with a fright. He didn't expect to find Draco
Draco attempted all of those same spells, including a few Harry admitted he’d never even heard of — not trying to show off, mind you — yet there was still no budging the massive oak door.
MV Theo yawns and shuts his heavy potions book, tossing it onto his trunk — where it promptly slides off onto the floor. He wishes Harry and Draco a goodnight as he closes his own curtains and the grandfather clock by the door chimes to announce it’s midnight.
But Harry watches, and wanks, and comes far too early. While Draco is still humping the giant dragon plush toy, his hips working overtime until milky ejaculate is smeared across the dark fur of the toy.
MV Harry finally walks up, wearing the cafe’s uniform as he drops off a slice of carrot cake and a fresh latte. He says it’s ‘on the house’ in a shy voice and turns the cup so his number is visible where it’s written on the side in black marker. MV Draco smirks and tells Harry he looks cute in his apron. It makes Harry blush and scurry back behind the counter.
Harry grumbled and arched his back, spreading his legs again slowly with a roll of his hips. He was half-hard and impatient, Draco could sympathize. Of course, that didn’t mean he was going to stop teasing. He was still holding a small grudge over Harry giving him the slowest handjob in the world last month and grinning about it afterwards. There was a score to settle.
And Draco had ground his teeth and bore it when he was assigned to partner up with Harry bloody Potter after Flitwick’s Diagnostic Charm discerned that they had the most complimentary magical cores for the spells involving stonework that necessitated two casters working in tandem.
“But this is a Muggle shop.” Not what Harry should be latching onto, but his brain is spinning in useless circles. Malfoy is wearing a very thin t-shirt and his perky nipples are visible.
“Hello, Scorpius, it’s nice to meet you too. I’m happy you’re going to be in my class.” The warmth in Potter’s voice was genuine, although he still looked at Draco, a bit unsure. “Rose, please show Scorpius where to put his things. We’ll start in a few minutes.”
MV Draco blows a lock of hair out of his face and smirks. “Long enough, Darling.” His free hand grabbed MV Harry’s arse with a casual air and Harry didn’t need to see any more.
To see Draco slowly wind down from orgasm, the evidence sliding down his chest and stomach. His thighs quiver as he slowly rises off the thick dildo centered on his bed, the shameless squelch of lube audible when the head pops free of his body. The liquid silver of his eyes is barely visible between dilation and the hazy fluttering of his lashes. Draco laughs, low and breathy, as he rubs the spent dildo along the crevice of his groin, his softening cock, and heavy bollocks. Lube is smeared everywhere, adding to his image of debauchery.
“Mate, we thought we were doing you a favour. Ginny said...” Seamus started explaining, but Harry cut off his words.
The blond leaned against the wall for a moment, pondering his options. Ron, Millicent and Neville had been on the other end of the corridor. There was no way he could find them in the darkness of whatever spell Nott had used and he also had no idea how to counter that spell. And from the sounds he'd heard, Nott hadn't been alone. Which meant that there were strangers in the castle. Death Eaters, most likely.
Lavender sat down next to Harry. “She got a letter from her parents this morning and … Oh, hello Hermione.”
The blond felt his face heating as well and cursed his pale complexion. He wondered what all those onlookers must be thinking and had to mentally remind himself to be careful. No-one could know what was really going on between him and Harry. It was too dangerous. For both of them.
He was staring at Sirius in complete shock, while the older man calmly talked about blowjobs and lubrication spells, not sure if he felt more embarrassed at the topic or grateful for the tips his cousin was giving him.
“Unfortunately yes. He caught me. Man, I've never seen him that pissed off. He yelled at me and threw me out of his office.”
For a moment they simply stared at each other, the silence deafening after their shouting. Harry had a split second to wonder about the strange look on Draco's face. Then he suddenly found himself pressed back into the wall and Draco's lips were crashing against his. Without thinking he returned the almost vicious kiss, pulling the blond even tighter against him.
One of the boys snorted. Draco was pretty sure his name was Ernie. The boy didn't like him, because thanks to Draco pairing up with the Gryffindors, he was forced to sit with the other three Slytherins in Potions.
They hurried up to the castle to find professor McGonagall already waiting for them. Obviously Hagrid had told her that they'd witnessed the whole thing. Harry showed her the necklace and she told Filch to take it to Snape. Then she ushered the six students up to her office.
“Yes, I do. You know, it took me some time, but I finally figured it out. Now what I really want to know is, why the hell you staged all that crap today. Because that's what you did, right?”
The blond muttered something under his breath and heaved himself up. Harry tried his best to help him, but of course the Slytherin wouldn't listen to his suggestions and ended up toppling out of the window head first. He crashed into the younger boy and they landed on the ground in a heap.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes. "Potter! McGonagall told us to spend time together. She said nothing about talking."
When the three boys trudged up to Ron’s room they were surprised to find Hermione already waiting for them.
“I only wish we knew who it was meant for.” Hermione changed the subject. They spent a few minutes discussing options, before Ron pointed out that it hadn't been a very good plan to begin with.
Suddenly someone shouldered roughly past Draco, making him stumble and hissing “Death Eater scum!”. The Slytherin did his best to ignore the insult, but Potter glared at the guy, who hurried to disappear back into the crowd.
"I did. There is one book that provides a lot of information and even specific instruction on how to create a Horcrux. It's called Secrets of the Darkest Art. An old book that has been banned years ago. What I read there was frightening, but it also explains a lot."
The sound of someone clearing their throat made them jump apart. McGonagall was watching them with an amused, slightly calculating look.
Thankfully no-one commented on the Gryffindor's reaction and the girls refrained from further shows of affection. They talked about harmless subjects, while they emptied their butterbeers and soon enough they left the pub. After a quick stop at Honeydukes they headed back to the school.
“You can say that again.” Harry muttered bitterly. “Did you know that his family lived in Godric’s Hollow? The same place where my family lived? And he never told me. He never told me any of the important stuff.”
Dean was an okay player, but Katie was a lot better than him. And there was also the minor problem that Dean got into regular fights with Ginny, which messed up the team dynamics. "Our next practice is scheduled for Friday evening. I'm expecting to see you there."
“A bit.” the blond admitted. “She didn’t help us openly, but she also didn’t do anything to stop us. I just hope father doesn’t try to put the blame for our escape on her.”
Their second kiss was a lot slower and gentler than the first and seemed to go on forever. When they pulled back they were both breathless. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and grinned when the blond interlaced their fingers.
The Wizengamot had decided that he couldn't be held fully responsible for his actions in the war, since he'd been young and forced into the Dark Lord's service by circumstance. As Potter had pointed out, he'd only done what he had to in order to protect his family. He'd only taken the Dark Mark because he'd been forced to.
To make up for it, they had planned to throw him a big surprise party. Luna had gotten up before sunrise and snuck up to the room of requirement to make sure that it wouldn't be blocked by other people. It would have been Harry's job to get Ron to the room without giving away the surprise. But it never came to that.
Draco could tell exactly when Potter listened to his advice and stopped taking Dreamless Sleep. He was awoken in the middle of the night by the younger boy's terrified screams. The blond was out of bed and running to the other side of the room before he even fully realized what he was doing. He ducked as Potter's Potions book came hurtling towards him, narrowly avoided getting hit by a bottle of pumpkin juice and finally dropped down at the edge of the bed.
“Yeah.” Harry said with a grin. “I know you think it’s too soon. And it’s probably a bit of a shock for you. But we’re in love. Everything just feels… right, you know? Like we’ve always been meant to end up together.”
“I had a bad feeling about this the whole time. I mean, why would Harry suddenly be friends with you of all people? He always hated you. I knew something wasn't right. But I never thought even you would stoop so low. Using the Imperius curse on him...” he trailed off, shaking his head in disgust. The other four murmured in agreement.
“Snape sent this to my private vault at Gringotts! How did you get it? Did you break into my vault?!” she screeched.
He was a bit surprised at himself. At both of them actually. In the past their intimate encounters had mostly been tentative and a bit awkward. Both of them scared of doing something wrong or going too far. This playful banter was new. He liked it. He probably had the ritual to thank for that. They understood each other better now. They knew what the other wanted. It made things easier.
Draco just stared at him for a couple of seconds. Then he sighed, got up and pulled the younger boy into a hard kiss. Harry felt a little dazed when they broke apart again.
Then he looked straight at the Hippogriff and started reciting: “The fountains mingle with the river,
She smiled back, before exclaiming loudly. “Oh look, a Blibbering Humdinger!“ and pointing out the window.
They found Sirius and Remus already waiting for them, along with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Harry also saw Hermione leaving the train with Millicent, but neither girl looked in his direction. Just as well. They had said their goodbyes before boarding the train and there would be no time to talk now anyway, since the adults were anxious to get them home.
So the chasers were sorted out and he was rather pleased with his beaters, who kept improving steadily. Ron's performance on the other hand went from bad to worse. He had gotten into yet another fight with Hermione (this time about Slughorn's stupid Christmas party) and was now constantly in a foul mood. He got angry at the smallest things and frequently picked fights with the rest of the team.
After what felt like an eternity, but couldn't have been more than maybe a minute, Potter pulled back. He still had that intense look in his eyes. Draco was stunned speechless.
Once the door had closed behind them, he started stripping off his wet clothes. When he grabbed a fresh pair of pants, he noticed a long, thin package on his bed.
I'm changing the POV for the last two chapters, because I really wanted to show things from Draco's perspective.
Draco had a really bad feeling about this. There was something off about that woman. But he couldn’t really put his finger on it. So he had no choice but to follow the other two as they approached her. As soon as they started moving in her direction, she turned around and led them down the street to a house with a very unkempt garden. She wobbled down the path towards the front door, fumbling with the key.
“Even more reason to talk to him. Not talking only leads to misunderstandings. And those can destroy everything. Take it from someone who knows.” Sirius said, smiling sadly.
Sirius still decided to stay at Grimmauld Place for the time being, since it was the headquarters of the Order and it was just easier for now. According to him, Narcissa and Andromeda had tasked themselves (and everyone who wasn't able to run away fast enough) with making the house habitable again. They were also working on the sticking charm on his mother's portrait.
The Gryffindor let go of the other boy and took a step back, staring at Malfoy warily. There was something really strange going on here.
Great, so there were already rumours? Harry had only just figured it out himself. And he still wasn't sure if he was really gay or just bisexual.
“Very. We managed to get the horcrux out of Harry.” Draco heard Ginny gasp behind him and realized that she didn’t know. But he couldn’t worry about that now. He didn't know how much time they had. “It’s destroyed. Most of them are. Only two are left now. One is the snake. The other one must be hidden here at Hogwarts. Do you know what it is? Or where it is?”
When Harry only shrugged in response, he nudged him in the side. “Come on, tell me what’s bothering you, prongslet.”
They didn't get far however, before they ran right into Snape. Hatred boiled inside Harry, while McGonagall calmly faced the new headmaster. Draco squeezed Harry's arm in warning and mouthed: “Let her handle him.”
Remus and Sirius nodded. So did Harry. Only Ron still looked unconvinced. But after receiving a nasty glare from Hermione, he didn't voice his doubts aloud again.
Everyone gathered in the kitchen for another discussion. Sirius and Draco told the others what they had learned and they all wondered about the missing sword. Harry had handed the locket over to Hermione by now, so he was acting pretty normal again. He immediately agreed that Dumbledore must have hidden the sword.
The house was a dark silhouette against the sky. It was overgrown with ivy and looked even worse than he remembered. Most of the windows were smashed and he could see holes in the roof. The garden was full of weeds and wild plants.
According to the books from the Black library, at least those Remus had read so far, there were only very few ways to destroy a Horcrux. The only substance aside from Basilisk venom that would work was Manticore venom, which was even harder to get. Aside from that their only option was fiendfyre. A magical fire that was destructive as hell and nearly impossible to control. Which meant that they were back to the matter of the sword. Sirius felt that there must be a way for them to get their hands on it.
The calm tone of his voice surprisingly helped to calm Harry's temper as well. He concentrated on his breathing for a moment and his magic settled.
Harry had wondered that himself a few times. Snape had hinted that he might. “I don't know. But I don't think so. He would've caught me by now, if he could, right?”
Most of what happened after his talk with Snape was a blur. Draco got up and went back through the hall, passing Weasley and Granger on his way. They asked if he'd seen Harry and he just shook his head. He would explain later. If he survived the night. The thought that he might die tonight didn't even scare him. There was nothing left to live for anyway.
Harry disagreed. He owed them so much. The Weasleys had taken him in, had treated him like a family member. They had always been kind to him. They felt more like family than his Muggle relatives ever had. But he didn’t know how to put his feelings into words. He’d never been good at talking about feelings.
"We went to see Dumbledore earlier. Draco told him everything." Harry shook his head, remembering the headmaster's calm smile. "He wasn't even surprised. He had known that Draco had been told to kill him all along." It had caught the blond off guard. When Dumbledore had assured him that he knew that Draco never really intended to hurt him, the Slytherin had almost cried again.
The blond jumped when the door suddenly opened, but relaxed even before Harry pulled his invisibility cloak off.
Bellatrix hit him hard across the face. “If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next, instead of my dear nephew. One blood traitor is as good as the other in my book.”
Harry wasn't sure if Draco heard him or if he sensed his approach through the bond. But all of a sudden the blond whirled around and pointed his wand at him. He resisted the urge to draw his own wand, knowing full well that it could only end badly and instead held up his hands in a placating gesture.
Draco fiddled with his napkin, glancing around the posh restaurant nervously. The reporters didn't do a good job of hiding and he wondered, not for the first time, if his father had tipped them off. Or maybe Mr. Greengrass had. He wouldn't put it past either man.
Harry only shook his head with a grin. “Nothing. Just.. strategy, you know. Can't tell you, since you're the opponent and all.” he claimed, before preventing further questions by kissing Draco.
"Mistress is calling for Mipsy." the tiny creature explained, looking sick with the strain of refusing the call.
“Yes, well... Daphne's a bit shy.” Lavender let him know. “But really, we don't exactly hide it any more. And you spend so much time with us.”
He was engrossed in a discussion with little Kilian and didn't look up when the owls started arriving with the morning post. Until suddenly a handsome barn owl swooped down and dropped a bouquet of flowers right onto his toast. He frowned first at the flowers and then at the owl, who only hooted happily, before stealing some of his bacon and flying off again.
I've got the second chapter finished and I planned out the next two or three, so hopefully I'll get those done a little quicker. Though I can't promise anything. Work is a little hectic at the moment.
“Harry! I’m so glad you got away!” Hermione shouted as soon as she saw him, pulling him into a hug, before turning to throw her arms around Draco. “We looked for you, but it was too chaotic. We couldn’t see you anywhere. So we apparated away.”
“About... lubrication spells and … positions and...” he trailed off, blushing an even darker shade of red.
“More so than ever. And you will need friends this year. There aren't many you can trust in Slytherin.” Zabini pointed out.
Both boys blushed lightly at being caught and Harry shook his head at himself. When was he ever going to learn that you couldn't eavesdrop on Dumbledore? They entered the office, greeting the adults sheepishly.
Just a short chapter today, but I think you're going to like it. And I'm fairly sure now that there will be only two more chapters after this. I'll reveal who is behind the bond in the last chapter. Anyone want to make a guess?
Malfoy looked genuinely surprised by those news. The younger boy figured that his two best friends had been a bit more obvious about fancying each other than they'd thought. Okay, so it had taken him a while to notice, despite spending most of his time with them. Then again, he'd never been the most perceptive when it came to relationships.
“Not a chance. Harry would be extremely cross with me if I let you fall flat on your face. And Remus, too. He might withhold sex to punish me.”
Maggie frowned, obviously not at all pleased with his lack of enthusiasm. “Well, of course we'll discuss coping methods in case of another outburst and I can also prescribe you some calming draught, but those can only be a part-time remedy. To stop the outbursts for good we'll have to tackle the real problem. And that will take time and patience.”
Draco couldn't help but snort at that. “If anyone's putting pressure on you, it's him. He expects you to defeat... Vol...demort.” he reminded.
He was four and crying himself to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs, after having been punished for something Dudley had done.
“Of course not. Do I look like a Hufflepuff?” the blond asked with a scoff. When Harry didn't reply he went on: “I'm not going to spill all my secrets, just because you ask nicely. But... I might be up for a bargain.”
The blond smiled nervously and took his arm. Harry shuddered at the contact. And then they were gone.
The next evening found all of them gathered in the living room again. Remus had chosen this room for the ritual because of its size and also because it was the central point of the house. The couch, chairs and coffee table had been pushed to the side, the rugs rolled up and stored away. Remus and Hermione had spent about an hour drawing strange runes and symbols onto the now bare hardwood floor, creating the circle for the ritual.
Harry considers never complaining about Floo travel ever again, as his stomach turns over from hurtling through time and across multiple dimensions. With little fanfare, they land on a velvety soft couch inside of a wildly opulent ballroom. It’s an enormous space and tastefully lit by hundreds of tiny candles. There’s a balcony with a double set of wide French doors, both held open by tied ropes so the moonlight and night air can pour in.
“Draco… Draco,” Harry panted under his breath with his balled fists pressed harshly onto the sides of his hips.
MV Harry is sitting on a group of rocks by the water’s edge, leaning over and fully focused on the iridescent merman in the water. It’s Draco and he’s singing a passionate tune in Mermish, rounding out his song by raising his hands and presenting MV Harry with a delicate necklace made of braided seaweed.
A slow blink and Potter seemed to catch himself, clearing his throat and nodding, his smile friendly and bright when directed at Scorpius
Harry may have been falling apart, but Malfoy was calm and unaffected. He didn’t so much as spare a glance at Harry, squirming in his grasp. “Weasley’s case, Potter. The black market potion dealers had an arsenal recovered at the crime scene, then some imbecile botched the chain of custody and a crate of evidence went missing. Including vials of the potion, someone slipped into your drink.”
Unconcerned, Draco brushed a spot of stray lint from his robes. “Potter, if your listening comprehension was up to scratch, you’d realise that I had said nothing inflammatory about your friend. I was merely impressed by her accomplishment.” The corners of his mouth tightened into an exasperated smile. “As fun as this chat was, I’m late for Potions. Good day, Potter.”
“You can’t ignore me for shits and giggles. And the smuggler could up his game and move to higher targets. We need to find out how he’s dosing the suppliers he’s stealing from.”
” Malfoy rolled his eyes and yanked Harry out of his seat with hidden strength, the leather of his gloves creating a pleasant amount of friction. “I promise, we all believe you, Potter.”
“Yes, I figured this part was coming. Your temperature’s rising? Shivers down your spine and goosebumps on your skin? And then there’s the matter of — well. The obvious.”
Now that the sentimental parts were over, Draco could breathe again and ignore the blush he felt blooming on his cheeks. Bloody Gryffindors and their feelings that overflowed onto everything in sight. There was no decorum with that bunch.
He struggled to hide a wince. “I know. Thank you, Nipsy, we’ll be back for dinner.” After seizing the two lunches with his left hand, Draco grabbed Scorpius with his right after throwing powder into the Floo. “Ironbark Academy for Miniature Wixen.”
Harry frowns and types out another hefty donation before he can even realise he’s been goaded into it. It is simply fortunate that Gringotts had upgraded to offer a debit card option for Muggle money transfers. He needs the easy access with as much money he spends on Draco nowadays.
“Look, that’s not what I meant.” Potter swapped his intensity for low-grade frustration and surveyed his class, then deemed it appropriate to guide Draco out into the hall for privacy. At least he left the door half-open. “There’s an ice cream shop, two blocks from here.”
Too late. The stoppered vial of potion smokes, then explodes before either of them can throw up a proper Shield Charm. The blast propels Harry back into Draco, who slips on the puddle on the floor. As Draco’s going down he tries to cling to Harry for support, but Harry trips over a crate of previously filled vials on the floor and falls on top of Draco. In a continuation of mimicking dominos  — They knock into the cauldron, its content spilling onto their clothes, but before it seeps in and burns them both, they disappear. The Time-Turner had begun spinning in Draco’s hand after being splashed with one of the potions.
“Fucking Merlin, Malfoy,” Potter hissed under his breath. The following eye roll was unappreciated. “I’m trying to ask you out. On a date. For ice cream.”
Harry studiously ignored the horde of doxies flying in his stomach as he listened to the vowels roll off of Draco’s tongue like liquid velvet.
Like an eerie impression of an owl, Draco slowly tilted his head to one side. Then spoke slowly, “Yes. Granger was the only student capable of sitting for NEWTS after…” — he waved his hand vaguely —  “The events of last year. It’s stunning that she managed such a feat.”
Draco smears his own come across his thighs in full view of the camera, then leans in close and signs off in a breathy voice.
“But you have room on your shelf beside Piglet and Eeyore,” Draco said, hoping to compromise. He cringed once he saw that Scorpius was wearing socks that didn’t match.
He helps Draco up without thinking twice, immediately wishing he hadn’t when he realizes how close they’re standing now.
Draco insisted it was Harry for picking up the cursed object without testing it in the first place, while Harry swore it never would’ve happened if they had been working instead of Draco
“We were out of the country during registration day, but I am aware that class ends at three. I’ll be here on time, don’t worry, Potter.” Draco said, his drawl slow and skirting the edge of condescending.
Draco and Harry both start coughing when they land face-first on the rug, inhaling lots of dust. This time they’re at Grimmauld Place, in the corner of a large sitting room where several Order members are having a meeting. Narcissa, Molly, and Kingsley are all speaking in shockingly polite tones while MV Harry and Draco are sitting on a loveseat, looking cosy. It can’t be too far out of the ordinary since they’re being ignored by Ron, Hermione, and Percy who are bickering about something else. MV Harry and Draco are failing to hide their grins while they play footsie in plain view of everyone else. It’s embarrassing.
“Alright. I’ll see you later, Harry.” Draco bit his lip to keep his smile politely contained then walked away with the tatters of his dignity. He couldn’t help looking back as he turned the corner. His breath caught in his throat when Harry was still standing there. Eyes on him.
What a beautiful mess he made, but Harry knew the rules. If he dirtied any of Draco’s things, he had to clean it up.
“You’re a pervert, Potter,” Draco insists, grabbing Harry by the collar and choking him as he sends the Time-Turner spinning with vigour.
The elf quaked from head to foot. “Kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible things… Kreacher’s insides burned… Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, but the Dark Lord only laughed. He made Kreacher drink all the potion… he dropped a locket into the empty basin and …. filled it with more potion. And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island.”
“Elf magic is different than wizard magic. I never really gave it much thought. I guess most wizards don’t. But elves have their own special powers. They can apparate in and out of Hogwarts, while we can’t, for example.”
Hermione still didn’t understand it. After all the fights, the taunts and insults… How could Harry fall for the boy who had done so many horrible things? On the other hand, he and Malfoy had always gravitated towards each other. So maybe he was right and this was the logical outcome.
They usually went to Hogsmeade together, but Harry really wanted his two best friends to finally get their shit together. He'd survive one trip without them. "Yeah, don't worry. Maybe I'll go with Draco." he mused and inwardly cursed himself when Ron's smile turned into a frown.
Draco sighed in defeat. Who was he kidding here? Harry had him wrapped around his little finger and he suspected the younger boy knew it. “Alright, I'll give it a try. But remember that this was all your idea, when it ends in mayhem.”
It was more a statement than a question, but Draco felt compelled to answer nonetheless. Especially since she sounded so surprised.
Draco freed himself from Harry's grasp and pushed the sleeve back down, unwilling to look at the ugly mark. He did his best to keep it covered all the time, so he never had to look at it.
The door opened and Wormtail took a cautious step into the cell. Immediately Harry and Ron tackled him to the ground. Harry clamped a hand over his mouth, while Ron restrained his wand arm. Draco watched stupidly as the three wrestled on the ground.
“Well... up until Hogwarts my father decided who I associated with. I never got to choose my own friends, so I had no idea how to make friends.” he admitted.
His plan seemed to work, because Daphne got to her feet and declared she needed to get going now, because Lavender was waiting. He breathed a sigh of relief.
And after spending a whole year trying to convince the public that Harry was a nut-case, the Prophet was now convinced that he was the only one capable of defeating Voldemort (as was stated in a prophecy) and had started calling him the Chosen One. It was all pretty ridiculous, but obviously there were still a lot of people who believed whatever those idiots at the Prophet wrote.
Taking a deep breath he tried again. He could feel Draco trembling, but aside from that he kept perfectly still. Harry slid his mouth a bit further down and tried rubbing his tongue along the underside. He could only fit about half of Draco's cock into his mouth without choking. His jaw was already starting to ache from the unusual activity. This was a lot harder than he'd anticipated. But the noises Draco made were worth any discomfort.
None of them noticed the latecomer, until he held out his invitation to Ron and complimented Hermione. She dropped her beaded bag in shock when she recognized Viktor Krum. Much to Ron’s obvious annoyance she actually blushed and started stammering.
Seconds later he found himself standing in front of a small cottage. It looked almost cosy, at first glance. But then he noticed that it was dark inside, that the front-door had been blown off its hinges and a window was smashed in. And then he spied the dark mark looming in the sky above the cottage and recoiled.
“I do. And... I'm sorry. For the way I treated you. For the horrible names I called you. I was an arse.”
So Harry kept moping, dragging himself through his classes and stubbornly avoiding his boyfriend, even though he missed the blond prat. Once lessons were done on day two, the Gryffindor fled to his room and used the two-way-mirror to contact Sirius and Remus. He finally told them about the memory and his talk with Dumbledore, before complaining about Draco. To his surprise and great annoyance, Sirius actually sided with the blond.
Ron had accidentally swallowed a love potion meant for him. Harry had taken him to Slughorn for an antidote and once that had been administered, Slughorn had offered them a drink. Which had obviously been poisoned. Thanks to Draco telling him about bezoars in Potions a while ago, Harry had been able to save Ron just in time.
"Sirius also told me that you managed to get yourself bonded to Mr. Potter." Narcissa continued, her voice taking on a slightly mischievous tone.
“You know, that might be an idea. I did have fun with the DA. I'll ask Dumbledore if it would be okay.” Harry decided, before starting a conversation about Quidditch.
“I’m sure he is. We actually wanted to ask something different. It doesn’t have anything to do with headmaster Snape.”
They skidded to a halt just out of reach of the whipping branches and Ron levitated a branch onto the knot at the foot of the tree. Harry hesitated briefly. What if it was a trap? What if he was leading his friends right into Voldemort's waiting arms?
They stared at each other, both breathing hard. He knew that Draco was right. That the blond's level-headedness was once again balancing his rash nature. But they had to hurry. Voldemort was already on the move...
“Well, then I guess the first thing would be to make you more aware of your magic.” Draco mused. “If we can find out more about your outbursts, how and when they happen, then maybe we can find a way for you to stop them before your powers get out of control.”
Well, begging obviously worked. Thanks to everyone for the sweet comments. They really made my day. And since I've felt very inspired, I already got the next part finished.
“Because it’s not! When will you get it into your thick skull that he can’t have hidden it at Hogwarts?!”
And now there's only one chapter left. You'll finally learn more about the bond and find out who caused it. Any guesses?
Before he could even take one step, there was another crack and Sirius reappeared in the field. His hair was tousled, his clothes askew and he had a split lip, but no other obvious injuries. And he was grinning. Harry rushed over and hugged him.
“We did.” Harry assured. “Remus made up the two guest bedrooms, so you can come back to Fern Cottage with us right after the wedding.”
Harry spent the evening with Hermione, telling her about his holiday and the visit from the Minister, while Draco sat in the Slytherin common room with Blaise and Millicent, regaling them with stories of Christmas at the Burrow and how much fun it had been.
They continued pacing back and forth, casting nervous glances at the blank wall every now and then. Sometimes they talked in hushed whispers, but mostly they were silent. Draco had no idea how much time went by like this. He was starting to wonder if anything at all would happen here tonight and his thoughts kept straying to Harry.
“I am. He brags about it. Apparently he-who-shall-not-be-named wanted a Hogwarts student for a job, for some reason. At least that's what Nott said. He also claimed that you were too much of a coward to do what was required. So he volunteered. He even showed me the Dark Mark on his arm.”
“Kissing Potter's ass now, are you? Oh how the mighty Slytherin prince has fallen. Just wait until I tell the Dark Lord. I'm sure he'll be thrilled to hear that you went crawling to Potter, because you were too much of a coward to take the Mark.”
The end of February brought the next Quidditch match - Slytherin vs. Ravenclaw. Seamus Finnegan was commentating this time, lashing out against the Slytherin team, but very careful not to insult Draco. Most likely because of Harry's outburst from a few months ago. The dark-haired boy still hadn't forgiven him and their interactions were rather frosty.
“Us girls, of course. Probably most of the boys in Slytherin, too. I don’t know. It was like an open secret. No one felt the need to say anything, because… well, I guess we didn’t really care. And Pansy made it pretty clear that she wouldn’t tolerate anyone giving you grief about liking boys.”
Once they entered the compartment Lavender and Daphne embraced and shared a kiss. Draco averted his eyes, wondering how any guy could get off on seeing that. He ignored their happy reunion and instead joined Luna, asking about her holiday. Harry found them only a few minutes later.
Malfoy didn't answer, but when Dobby brought him a large slice of chocolate cake he dug in hungrily, giving the elf a small smile.
Harry glanced at Draco, who gave him an encouraging nod. “Alright. Kreacher, sit up and tell us everything you know about that locket and what Regulus had to do with it.”
“Maybe there is.” Draco murmured. “It's true that wizards and witches can't apparate into Hogwarts. But house elves can. And Mipsy told me to call her when I need help.”
"I'm spending it with mother and aunt Andromeda, I guess." the Slytherin said with a shrug. "Though I hope to meet up with Pansy as well. She's coming home for Christmas."
“Nono, I’m fine.” Harry assured. “Just a bit tired, I guess.” His gaze darted around the room, before settling on Draco again. He still looked a bit shaken. “So… what did she want?” he asked, jerking his head at the door.
She hurried away and he continued to listen to Harry's yells and the others trying to calm him, until Madam Pomfrey bustled in and waved her wand at the door, drowning out the sounds. “Mr. Malfoy, how are you feeling? Any residual dizziness or pain?”
Harry muttered “Slytherin” under his breath, but he couldn’t deny that the idea had its merits. No-one could fault him for wanting to spend time with his godson, especially at Christmas. And the Weasleys probably knew how much he wanted to be there for the boy. How responsible he felt for the deaths of Remus and Tonks.
He shook his head and sighed to himself. He really needed to figure out what was going on with the Gryffindor. Maybe he could corner him later and make him talk. With that thought in mind he got up and started getting ready for the day.
“Great. That means we only have to shake off mum long enough to get past the wards and disapparate. Piece of cake.” Ron muttered.
Life at Fern Cottage was strange. They heard all these awful news or read the articles whenever one of them managed to get their hands on a copy of the Daily Prophet, which was now under Voldemort’s control as well. But somehow none of it seemed to touch them directly. The cottage felt like a safe bubble, far away from the real world and its many dangers. On the other hand not everyone dealt well with being cooped up in the old house and tempers flared more often than not.
Dumbledore was put to rest in a white marble tomb close to the lake. It was a perfect summers day. There were many people present, though Harry only recognized a few. All the members of the Order of the Phoenix had shown up, the Weasley family of course and Cornelius Fudge. Harry was surprised to see his former squib neighbour, Mrs. Figg and shocked when he spied Umbridge.
“So Nott's doing something in the room of requirement. Most likely something illegal. But we have no idea what exactly. That means we need to catch him at it.” Harry mused.
“Harry always thinks that he has to do anything by himself. He thinks it's his job to save us all, you know? That's just who he is. He's very brave. But sometimes he's not very smart. You have to tell him that you're worried.”
“I liked the DA. I learned loads with you.” Neville interjected quietly, while Luna muttered that it had been like having friends.
Trying to stop his dark thoughts he looked around. It was a beautiful day and there were quite a few people around, enjoying the sunshine. Not far away he could see a young couple sitting on a blanket, having a picnic.
Once it was over, the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, the chairs grouped around small tables and a dancefloor appeared in the middle. Ron snatched a few Butterbeers from a waiter and they went in search of a table a good deal away from aunt Muriel. They found Luna sitting alone and joined her. But as soon as the band started playing, she got up, drifted towards the dance floor and started dancing by herself.
Her final blow delivered, Parkinson got up and stalked out of the room, slamming the door for dramatic effect. Malfoy sank back into the cushions with a sigh. Harry was shocked to see tears glistening in his eyes. Without thinking he cuddled closer. Malfoy gave a watery smile and started petting him.
"Why did you help me?" the Gryffindor finally asked the question that had been on his mind since their escape.
Harry shrugged. "Nothing, really. Dumbledore is probably going to get rid of the vanishing cabinet. Sirius and the others are going to take Draco's mum somewhere safe."
Voldemort still wasn’t showing himself openly, which only fuelled the fear, uncertainty and suspicion among the wizarding public. The Ministry was now firmly in his hands. Minister Scrimgeour had been tortured and killed and replaced with a man named Pius Thicknesse, who was supposedly under the Imperius curse. Harry was a wanted man. The Ministry claimed to be looking for him to question him about the death of Dumbledore. Also new was the Muggle-born Register. All Muggle-borns were forced to come to the Ministry and prove that they had wizarding ancestors. Otherwise they were accused of having obtained their powers by theft or force.
Lucky for him the match started, preventing them from questioning him further, since the cheers and boos from the crowd would have drowned out their voices. It looked like Harry had gotten into yet another fight with McLaggen. Draco could see him shouting something at the keeper. His posture was stiff and there was an angry look on his face.
Draco was taken aback at the bitterness in her voice. He’d never paid all that much attention to her, but from what he knew Daphne had always been proud of her heritage. Just like him. Up until the moment that heritage had forced him into the service of a madman.
With a shudder Draco forced his gaze away from the dead professor. Just in time to see Neville rip off the Sorting Hat and pull something long and gleaming out of it. The sword of Gryffindor. With a cry he swung it in a graceful arc … and sliced off Nagini’s head with a single stroke.
Looking up he caught Harry's gaze across the hall. The Gryffindor gave him a tentative smile and Draco hesitated only briefly, before smiling back. Things had changed between them last night. And although Draco wasn't sure yet what it meant, he was willing to see where it would lead. He had nothing more to lose anyway. He startled when someone started piling food onto his plate.
Neville gasped and toppled out of his seat again. Zabini gave him a disdainful look. Harry however exchanged a worried glance with Draco.
Sirius shook his head with a sigh. It really was a mess and his cousin's clumsiness wasn't helping. Neither was the fact that they had no real idea of what they were even looking for. Slytherin's locket maybe, or the cup of Helga Hufflepuff. Or maybe something of Ravenclaw's. Those hints weren't much to go by. But luck seemed to be on their side today, because he finally spied a cup with a badger engraved on it.
“They did. I guess some of them choose to stay and fight instead.” Harry answered just as quietly. He sounded close to tears himself.
“Wait, what? What are you talking about? I would never...” Draco tried to defend himself, but it was no use.
“Sure. Everything’s fine. That’s why you’re sitting here staring at nothing, while Draco’s pacing down in the living room, muttering about stubborn idiots.”
The younger boy smiled weakly. “I can't really explain. It's just... looking back some things don't add up, you know? And he's keeping stuff from me. Important stuff. After Voldemort returned, he sent me back to my Muggle relatives and ordered everyone not to tell me anything. He didn't even want me to know about the Order. Sirius went against his orders when he told me. Maybe Dumbledore was really only trying to protect me. I guess he must have had his reasons. I don't know. But I just … I'm so sick of being kept in the dark.”
They all handled the scary situation differently. While Draco was obviously on 24-hour-taking-care-of-Harry-duty, Remus and Hermione spent every waking hour locked in the study, poring over books and took turns sleeping. Though Harry wasn’t even sure if they slept at all. Sirius disappeared for hours on end and often returned late at night. Harry fretted about what he might be doing, until Draco told him that he was trying to get his hands on more books about the dark arts.
The Hogwarts express slowed down and finally came to a halt. Once again people were staring at Harry and Draco as they got off the train and headed for the carriages. Draco saw Nott up ahead, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, with Pansy hanging on his arm. Nott caught his eye and smirked. Draco put on his best haughty expression and turned to talk to Harry. Remus had advised him to show everyone clearly where his loyalties lay and he had every intention of following that advice.
After breakfast they lounged around outside, enjoying the sunshine and then spent some time playing two-a-side Quidditch in the backyard. In the afternoon they went to the Burrow. Thanks to all the security enchantments it was impossible to travel there by floo or apparition at the moment. So they took a portkey to a nearby field and walked the rest of the way. Despite the fact that Bill and Fleur’s wedding was scheduled for the next day, Mrs. Weasley had insisted on hosting a birthday dinner for Harry.
“Yes.” Draco’s voice sounded firm. He looked perfectly at ease. Harry really envied him for his calmness.
“Let’s go for a walk.” he urged, steering her out towards the lake. They walked along the shore for a bit and finally stopped at a secluded spot between two trees.
Remus noticed the kitchen clock with a frown. Harry and Draco should have been down for tea ages ago. Which probably meant that it was time for more damage control. Ignoring his still pouting boyfriend he grabbed two mugs of tea and a plate with biscuits, placed them on a tray and went upstairs.
After breakfast Ron was dragged off by Lavender. He shrugged apologetically and Harry just waved him off. He couldn't even muster the usual annoyance at the red-head's girlfriend. He moped around for a while, before joining Hermione in the library to catch up on homework.
“Yeah, she should check that source.” the Gryffindor muttered, rubbing his sore wrist. The skin was starting to get chafed, despite the pink fur. At least Malfoy's wrist looked no better.
“Draco, you look terrible. We've been ever so worried, darling. Come on, let's get you dried up.” she rushed on and then proceeded to drag the blond away. The other Slytherins hurried after them.
Most of them didn't even bother to lower their voices and he was once again glad that he'd managed to talk his mother out of bringing him to the train. He caught the word Death Eater more than once. And that was actually one of the nicest things people had to say about him.
"You said you only visited your parent's grave once, when you were on the run from the dark lord. So I thought... maybe you'd like to visit today? We don't have to, of course. Or I can stay here, if you'd rather..."
And I was like "Oh my god, that makes so much sense!" So I really wanted to use it in this story, but I had trouble fitting it in. In the end I decided to let Aberforth talk of this theory. I thought it would fit best.
The blond gave her a puzzled look. “I get why you don't envy Harry. I mean, who would want that kind of attention? But why me?”
“There is no way out.” Luna said softly. “We tried. The cellar is completely escape proof. Mr. Ollivander’s been here a long time. He tried everything.”
The two girls stalked up to their dormitory without a word and Harry turned back to Ron. They shared a look and burst out laughing, which probably did nothing to appease Parvati and Lavender. Ginny shook her head and told them they were hopeless, but there was a smile tugging on her lips as well.
“Daphne? Pretty much the same thing Brown wanted when she talked to you, I guess. She said she’s hoping we’d become friends.”
At the Burrow they also met the Delacours, who had arrived the day before. Mrs. Delacour was a beautiful, blonde woman, while Mr. Delacour was a head shorter than his wife and extremely plump, but good-natured. And of course there was also Gabrielle, Fleur’s little sister. With her waist length silvery blonde hair she was a miniature version of Fleur. She immediately started flirting with Harry, much to Ginny’s amusement and Draco’s annoyance. Harry himself seemed completely oblivious and a little surprised when Draco demonstratively put an arm around his waist, while glaring at the girl.
“From the tales of Beedle the Bard? That's a children's story.” Draco cut in. At Harry's questioning look he explained: “It's about three wizard brothers trying to cheat death. They each get to choose a gift from death. So the first brother asks for an unbeatable wand. Death gives him the elder wand, but he brags about it and gets murdered in his sleep shortly after. The second brother asks for the power to raise the dead. Death gives him the resurrection stone, which he uses to bring back his dead girlfriend. But the girl is only a shadow and he commits suicide in the end. And the third brother gets an invisibility cloak. He manages to hide from death and finally dies peacefully of old age.”
They slowly got up and started treating their injuries. Luckily the Slytherin had remembered to pack some healing potions and salve.
Seconds later Lavender came running up to them, throwing her arms first around Harry and then around Draco, who returned the hug a little awkwardly. He was still getting used to her exuberant behaviour.
"I think he's just a bit shy." Malfoy said placatingly, patting Harry's head. "This is Pansy. She's nice. She won't hurt you." he promised earnestly.
“Why don't we split up? While you go to Glinting Goods, Harry and I can visit Spintwitches. I could do with a new pair of Quidditch gloves.” the blond suggested.
It wasn’t a question, but Harry nodded. “It felt too ... strange. Too frightening. I couldn’t talk about it.”
It was apparent that this was no ordinary fire. Crabbe had used a curse Harry had never heard of. The fire seemed to grow ever bigger and hotter and Crabbe had no control over it. The flames chased them as though they were alive.
They met in the middle, only inches apart and hesitated for a moment. Gathering his famous Gryffindor courage the younger boy finally closed the distance and leaned in for a kiss. He sighed in relief when the blond responded by tangling a hand in his hair to pull him closer. Harry's arms wrapped around Draco almost of their own volition, his hands stroking the naked skin of the blond's back gently. He'd pushed his hands beneath Draco's shirt before, when they had been making out, but it still felt new and exhilarating.
Draco grabbed the other one and they dragged him with them as best as they could. But Goyle was heavy and the fire was closing in around them fast.
“There are Dementors all around the boundary walls. The fireplaces are locked, the secret passageways secured. There is no way out.”
“It’s not your fault, Harry. I think it was only a matter of time until one of us slipped up and said the name.”
Dinner went by in a blur and soon Draco was sending the little ones off to bed, while he went back to his room. He caught a glimpse of Harry leaving the great hall, looking like he was about to face off against a dragon. The scenario wasn’t at all impossible, knowing Hagrid. The half-giant had been suspiciously absent from the staff table, which didn’t bode well. But Harry could actually hold his own even against a dragon, so the Slytherin wasn’t overly worried.
“We arrived back at the Astronomy tower, because we'd seen the Dark Mark. Dumbledore was ill … and weak. But.. he must have noticed that it was a trap. I was under the invisibility cloak and he … he immobilized me. I couldn't do anything but watch.” his breath hitched, but he forced himself to go on: “Nott came and disarmed him. And then more Death Eaters came and … they killed him. Snape and Nott. They both … they both used Avada Kedavra.”
Harry felt a presence at his side. He didn’t even need to look to know that it was Draco. Ron and Hermione appeared behind Voldemort. And then Ginny and Luna were there as well. He smiled, completely sure of himself.
Draco managed to produce his falcon Patronus on the third try. Ron seemed too out of it to even attempt the spell. Or maybe he simply couldn't move, since Mrs. Cattermole was still clinging to him. At least Hermione had enough presence of mind to rip the locket off Umbridge and rush down to them.
“I've got your back, Draco. You know that my family opposes Him. But you need to be very careful. Nott already took advantage of the rumours. He's got Crabbe and Goyle on his side, as well as Parkinson. And I think quite a lot more might be frightened enough to side with him.” Blaise warned.
Of course they couldn't go about it like Harry and his friends had. There were only a handful of wizards and witches working for Gringotts and none of them had the authority to go anywhere near the vaults. So Harry's first idea had been to wait close to the bank for a witch or wizard who they could use. Preferably someone with a vault as old as that of Bellatrix.
There was a niggling, worried feeling at the back of his mind and only when it was replaced by relief, once he sat down at the Slytherin table, did he realize that it was coming from Harry. So he hadn't imagined it yesterday. The bond had tightened even more, allowing them glimpses into what the other was feeling. He wasn't so sure how he felt about that.
“Harry, look at me! Breathe!” he ordered. “You know how it works. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Come on, Harry. I’m here. I’ve got you. It’s okay. Just breathe with me.”
His hand found Harry's and he linked their fingers together. Their eyes met. They both leaned in and then their lips met as well. The kiss was different than those they had shared before. It was slow and gentle. A promise of more.
“Yes, indeed. I always have... and I always will. I did what I could to... save her. I ...betrayed the Dark Lord and became Dumbledore's spy. But... it was all in vain. She died ...and it felt like … my soul had died with her.”
"Draco does have a point." Remus cut in again before they could start a fight. "Judging by what I've read so far I'd say it's pretty unlikely that the locket can possess you when you simply wear it. But that doesn't mean it won't affect you at all. This is extremely dark magic we're dealing with. As I said, I haven't managed to work my way through all the texts yet and my knowledge is sketchy at best. We'd better be very cautious."
“I know I should have said it sooner, but I'm really sorry for the way I've treated you in the past. For making fun of your family, Weasley. And for calling you mudblood, Granger. And... for all the other stuff. I was a dick.”
“I was thinking we could go to Flourish & Blotts to buy our books. And then maybe the Apothecary?” Potter suggested, looking a little surprised that his offer was accepted so readily.
“And I couldn’t get you to wake up. And you said Parkinson would hold you when that happened, so I did that and it helped, but… I didn’t mean to fall asleep. I’m sorry.” Harry ended meekly.
And Harry felt so relieved at the prospect of company, even if said company was Malfoy, that he agreed.
The silver fingers slackened and Harry wrenched himself free, completely surprised. Wormtail, it seemed, was just as surprised as he. His rat-like eyes widened in shock and fear. And then, as if he had no control over it, his silver hand closed around his own throat.
His gaze slid over to Hermione, who was sitting at Ron's bedside, holding his hand and looking close to tears again. Maybe this would finally give her the much needed push to claim the red-head as hers. Then at least something good would come of it. He avoided looking directly at Ron. Seeing the youngest Weasley boy so still was just too unsettling.
Tense silence followed his outburst. Everyone in the common room was staring at him, but for once Harry didn't care if he caused a scene.
Draco cursed himself for getting involved with Gryffindors and letting himself be dragged into situations like this. But there was nothing for it. He didn't know how much the others had noticed or where they even were. Which meant that he had to alert a teacher, preferably McGonagall.
Somehow Harry wasn’t all that surprised when he introduced himself as Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna’s father. He complimented Ron on the gnome infestation of their garden, just as Luna rushed up to them. She too was wearing bright yellow robes, just like her father and a sunflower in her hair. Once he got over the brightness, Harry actually quite liked the outfit. It sure suited her.
“Umm... I'm not sure, really. I think I had an inkling after you went completely berserk when he got attacked. And then you started disappearing in the evenings to meet him at the room of requirement. Ginny's jealous bitch act started making sense. And you're always staring at him. It's really pretty obvious, mate.”
Luna's answer had been quick and friendly. She had assured him that she understood. That she knew it wasn't his fault. She even thanked him for the food he'd had the house elves smuggle down to her, whenever he'd managed to get away with it. He was still surprised that she'd realized it had been him sending the elves.
He looked sincere, so the younger boy finally nodded reluctantly. When Draco grabbed the hem of his jumper Harry dutifully lifted his arms and allowed the blond to pull it off. There was a strangled sound from the other side of the room.
He hated being reminded of that day. Sirius had died that day, because he'd run right into danger, without thinking it through first. Stupid, reckless idiot that he was. His godfather's death had been his fault.
Fidgeting slightly, he debated what to do, completely droning out Snape's lecture and missing Hermione's worried glance. He finally decided to act on instinct. Since ignoring was impossible, he tried the opposite and concentrated on that strange feeling.
“We'll do as he said.” she cut him off. “We'll take a small sip each and then we're going to split up. Luna and I will patrol by Snape's office. You guys stay here.”
It was the last thing she said to him that day. Harry had no idea what exactly she told her family. Once they were back at the house he fled to his room and stayed there until Molly called him down to dinner. No-one but Ginny was looking at him much differently, so he suspected she hadn't told them what had happened exactly. But everyone seemed to know that their relationship was over for good.
