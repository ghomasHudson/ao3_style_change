The stars weren’t bright. A low, waning gibbous moon hovered tenuously in the twilight firmament, bestowing a very dim light upon the land and he could hear the rustling of leaves.
He paused all movement. He didn’t know about an unbreakable vow. The Dark Lord had set his terms – Be exiled to Otryazan as the price, and he wouldn’t hurt Lucius and Narcissa. “No. No, I don’t – He didn’t make a vow.”
“It’s such an absurd fairy-tale.” Malfoy said, laughing softly as he scooped two table-spoons of dough and placed them on the tray lined with parchment. Harry was standing at a distance, with a smile on his face.
"Would you?"
“Yeah.” Draco said as he sighed softly, brushing a strand of hair out of his face. “Reality is a bit harsh.”
“You – wait,” He was sort of confused, to put it mildly. If Draco wanted to be his friend, he couldn’t comprehend why had he been such an obtuse fuck for the six years. “you wanted –” A beat. “no, wait –”
He tilted his head to the sky, and his eyes were fixed on the white orb of light within the stars. The moon was uncertain. Alone. Created with imperfections. Yet, it was still beautiful. Human. It was human in the chaos.
Harry frowned as his fingers curled around the mirror in his pocket. It was a shard of the two-way mirror. A broken piece of a gift, given to him by Sirius. He had asked for a way out of the Malfoy manor.
“I figured that out myself.”
“Hey,” The brunet smiled, and nudged him softly with a chuckle. “Quite a surprise to find out you aren’t the insufferable, snot-nosed, numb-skulled git you were for six fucking years.”
As Harry walked to his backyard, he tried his best to stifle a giggle at the sight he saw. Draco was staring up at the sky, eyes wide and full of childish wonder. But that was not the amusing part. His tongue was outstretched, searching for snow.
It caused Malfoy to break into a small smile, while he chewed on a bite.
“He was with you for what – five minutes?” Draco said with a soft snort, a brief flicker of contempt crossing the features. “If you could defend Weasley, couldn’t your self-righteous arse extend the courtesy to the
“So, you’re fluent in nonsense, the oh-so subtle compliments and French.”
you to come up with an insensitive retort and screw it up, is that correct?”
He muttered a repairing charm, focusing on the core of his magic and it started to mend itself back together.
“When did you learn to cast one?”
“Right.”
“He saved your fucking life –
He cursed under his breath. Malfoy was his – arch nemesis. Or was he? An acquaintance? Sort of debatable. He wasn’t in his right mind, was he?
“I know,” Malfoy said, avoiding his gaze. “God, I know.”
Control was the core principle of wandless magic. He had to gain the control and power over his own magic. Or it would have a sporadic result.
Harry gave a shake to his head. Malfoy couldn’t wrap his head around the fact either, because he had a deep frown on his face, and he was staring into a void. “Malfoy?”
“Oh, you’re fluent in nonsense,” The corner of his lip turned upwards. “and in the oh-so subtle compliments.”
“Right,” He secured it with a soft nod. It was fair. “for what it’s worth,” Draco refused to even glance at Harry while he said, “I shouldn’t’ve touched the artefact without an idea of what it was.”
If Harry were forced into the wrong side of the war, would he have denied? Would he be valiant enough to? In theory, he was. In theory, he would retort cleverly if he was about to be tortured or killed. Yet, he wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure if he would’ve denied if the life of his family was at stake. If he could protect his family, why wouldn’t he?
“Er – hi?”
Falling through the veil.
“Hush, you.” Potter said, as his lips curled into a sly smirk as he half-turned to face Draco “Don't sound too upset, I might think you don’t like me– Too soon?”
It elicited a soft, sort of nervous, half-laugh out of Draco. He cast a glance around the room and said, “If it was in the front page of the prophet –”
He walked to a corner of the room, towards the canvas easel. A blank canvas rested on it. On the side, was a wide collection of paints and paintbrushes.
He could almost hear the smile in Harry’s voice as he said, “Oh, are we? Bless your observational skills.”
“I had a small victory over my arch nemesis – Of course I’m pleased with myself.”
“I know.”
As they're cuddling on the sofa, Harry nuzzles his face into Draco's hair to hide his shit-eating grin.
It was a cold voice. A light illuminated the hallway. He turned. Lucius Malfoy was standing in the corridor, his hair lank over his shoulder. Harry trained his wand at him. “Walk away, Lucius.”
It disturbed him, in a way. Not that he cared about Draco Malfoy. He didn’t stress over the untouched plate. Malfoy probably didn’t have an appetite. Or if Malfoy had a twisted idea in his mind, he wouldn’t know.
He fished it out, placing it on top of the novel, and the familiar rage started to fade. He exhaled slowly, putting his glasses on as he opened his eyes. The pocket watch remained on the novel. He didn’t want it close to him.
Draco doubled over; the left hand clutched into the soft fabric of the sweater and a soft laugh flying out of him, a faint crinkle on the corners of the eyes. “You’re a moronic –”
“No. I don’t care. It’s – well, I’m returning the favour considering you didn’t leave me on the rooftop when you could’ve and," A beat, "I won’t light you on fire, maybe.”
Harry, however, had no desire to cast a glance around. Instead, he focused on Draco. On the silver eyes, the softest smile which graced his lips and the light of the stars above dancing on his pale skin.
.” Malfoy said with a resigned sigh, checking his stance and extending the arm in front of him. He closed his eyes and exhaled slowly. “
“I don’t care if the obligations are fuck-all to you.” The words were underlined with a glare, as though daring the brunet to argue. “I had to save the ones I care about and I don’t regret it.”
“Yeah, sure.”
Harry focused on taming his uneven breathing. He wanted to force it out of his mind, yet the unrelenting thoughts of the nightmare wouldn’t cease, and it overwhelmed him.
He wanted to brush Potter away, but give in simultaneously. He couldn’t ground himself, and the contact was weighing him down to reality, until he brushed it away.
He could vaguely hear the soft sizzle of batter on a pan. With a confused frown, he turned the doorknob and it clicked out of place. He had to stifle a laugh at the sight of Draco Malfoy preparing crepes.
“The feeling is mutual.” He said with a soft sigh, carding his fingers through his unruly black hair. Malfoy had said it in a non-serious manner, and yet it caused a twinge of hurt in his chest.
A small frown creased his forehead while he lifted a hand and caught the seashell and turned it over in his hand. It was cold.
Or the Patronus charm to be precise. He was rather stunned when he had produced a corporeal one without a wand or a sporadic result. It was certainly progress, considering he could barely levitate seashells four days ago.
Malfoy’s face turned into a painful grimace for a brief moment. One flicker of hurt. “Okay – fine. I can’t tolerate it, so if we can start with the Patronus –”
“It all begins and ends in your mind.” Harry said, with a strained smile. “What you give power to, has power over you, if you allow it.”
“You’re cold.”
And the rage curled in him again. He crumbled the piece of parchment, and tossed it aside. He pounded his fists against his head. His body was shaking with the intensity of emotions.
“A sky,” Malfoy said, with a smirk. “A sky of your own fancy.”
"You're such a sap, Potter. Honestly, 'sweetcheeks'? Really? I don't know where you got that one from but if you know me at all, you'd know I'm every bit salty and bitter," Draco scowls out, definitely not blushing.
’,” Draco finished monotonously with a scowl on the face, which caused a slight upturn of the corners of the brunet’s mouth. “you are an unbearable moronic fuck, you know?”
“You can,” Potter whispered with a ghost of a smile on his lips. It was almost surreal. No banters. No arguments. Only a light conversation. “It’s just not the world you want to be in because it’s harsh.”
And it was so familiar. It wasn’t his own – His sky was pitch black. His sky didn’t hold infinite stars or a moon. His sky didn’t radiate a raw energy. Yet, it was familiar.
if Draco was a friend. Or
“Yes, I’m aware.” He scoffed. “It was a floo accident.”
A verbal jab wasn’t what he was angling for. It wasn’t – which explained the faint smile on his face – A part of him still recalled the third-year. The simpler times.
The calloused fingers curled around the hand and Draco’s grip tightened on the wand. He couldn’t relax. Not when Potter was holding Draco’s hand in his own, raising it to point the wand in the front while hand resting on the back. “You’re tense – ease up.”
I'm not sure what to write here, really. Not good at that (cries)
A silence lingered in the air. He wasn’t sure if he should ask him about the reason he was here. He wasn’t entirely convinced that it wasn’t one of Voldemort’s plan. In the end, it was about self-preservation. And he didn’t trust Malfoy. But the sneaky glint in his eyes was missing, and his mouth was set in a thin line.
He nodded.
He caught the blond reflexively, an arm curling around the slender waist in an inept manner, which was sort of odd, if he considered the six years of Quidditch practice. The scent of Draco’s cologne washed over him, “Care to explain, Malfoy?”
“Why would you care?” Draco’s said with a small shrug and his features feigned indifference. “In fact, why, pray tell, would you offer a chance at a friendship, when you are intent to find a way out of Otryazan?”
“I – what – a flying carpet?”
“You own a Firebolt,” Malfoy retorted, yet it wasn’t laced with venom. It was a banter. A small, light-hearted banter. Perhaps an unbelievable headline for the prophet. “If you didn’t, it would’ve been fair.”
“Yes, I might’ve,” Draco said with a small frown, “Perhaps, in a moment of weakness, it occurs once in a while” He turned his head to the side, “what’s your point?”
Draco wasn’t shouting back. He didn’t have any strength left in him to argue, and Potter had never intimidated him. He was standing there quite calmly as Potter screamed and cursed.
“I had to do a little research.”
“I am too proud to ask, and you won’t talk because: a) You’re stubborn b) ‘It’s Draco Malfoy – A death eater. He always has an ulterior motive.”
"Oh, low blow."
“Here,” He said with a small laugh. “your stance is off.”
"Draco – I told you, that outburst was caused by the cup-"
“No,” The ache in Harry’s chest intensified. He curled his fingers into a fist at the side in retaliation while he resisted the urge to reach out. “No, of course, I care."
With an uncertain sigh, Harry pushed the door open. It created a soft creaking sound. Draco was perched on the bed, reading a novel. “Draco –” He whispered with a soft knock on the door. “can I come in?”
He closed his eyes, as the violet and black blended in his mind, creating a chaotic sky, alive with raw energy and dim stars. Yes, the sky had infinite stars. Only, the stars weren’t bright.
And so he did – He recited the story of Rapunzel while they baked cookies – The soft laugh that escaped Malfoy’s lips was worth it.
“Show-off.”
Draco had a reluctant smile on his lips, and he returned to the novel. He had added the collection of Lord of The Rings and he had included Holding the man and Boy Culture with the painting supplies in a bag, casting an undetectable extension charm on it. He figured if he would be stranded on a severed Island, he could read or paint, existing in an unrealistic place he created in the mind.
"Idiot."
Slightly more tragic – Courtesy of a certain dark wizard – Or Tom. ‘I Am Lord Voldemort’ was such a pathetic anagram for ‘Tom Marvolo Riddle.’
A pitch-black sky didn’t long for permanence. It didn’t have any stars to carry. Only a never-ending loneliness. And he was the sky, in a way. Alone. A black sky was a mirror of absence.
“A side with a soft epilogue?”
Of course, the artefact must’ve caused the outburst, yet he wouldn’t’ve said it if it wasn’t true. A tiny, small part of Draco wanted to forgive Potter for what he had said. He wanted to return to the quips and sarcastic retorts. Or the absurd, non-serious fight-fests. The other part of him, was sort of reluctant. He couldn’t tear down his wall of defences for Harry Potter. “You – what you said, was cruel.”
“I – It’s not your concern, Potter.”
"Giving in to what?" Harry breathed, slightly breathless at the way Draco held him close again, swaying lightly to the music.
“Oh, are you?” He said with an unamused snort, and he scowled at the oh-so satisfied smirk etched on Malfoy’s face. “you’re possibly the worst I’ve ever trained.”
The blond lifted a brow in skepticism and for a brief moment, a wry amusement flickered across Draco’s features. “Aren’t you fluent in childish trash talk though?”
“Draco –” Potter crossed his arms over his chest in a typical closed-off stance and leant on the doorframe, fingers circled around the cup. “can we not fight for five minutes?”
Malfoy arched an eyebrow in surprise but he didn’t comment. He didn’t even want to live through that again. He couldn’t get the screams of pain out of his head. Hermione’s screams of pain.
He looked up at Draco, admiring how the soft light spilled and splashed over Draco's hair, making it almost glow.
“Can you shift, Malfoy?” He whispered, shoving his shoulder against Draco’s, fingers searching for the small branch. “I can’t – ouch – fucking twat.”
The next hallway was pitch black, but he continued through it. His scar was burning against his forehead. He scanned the area, and frowned. It was the east wing of the Manor. Yet, he had only seen a gist of it. Voldemort wasn’t here often, was he?
“I wanted a win against you.”
“Oh, it wasn’t the intention and you –” The scowl on Malfoy’s face was replaced with a confused frown, word trailing, the mouth caught open in a soft vowel sound. “wait–your first friend in eleven years?”
Falling.
Malfoy choked on air.
“I’ve got this, Potter. I can surely glide on ice without you.” Draco started as he stepped onto the ice. He managed to walk clumsily, maintaining a balance. He held onto the wall, lifting his feet up to walk like normal on the ice. Harry smiled, shaking his head.
“You did.”
The invisibility cloak dropped to the floor like molten silver at the edge of the Quidditch pitch. A slender figure was standing in the middle of the pitch. An outline against the sky.
He sat at a considerable distance, and watched the night sky as a comfortable silence lingered in the air.
Plenty.
,” a beat, “plus, I can’t write.”
“Aladdin – I – Potter, it’s confusing. Wizards don’t own flying carpets and I can’t recall a genie which can fulfil wishes in the entire fucking wizarding world even once.”
“You aren’t in spectacular shape.” Draco countered, a small frown creasing his forehead. It was a task to deal with the Chosen One. No wonder who could put up with the reckless behaviour. “No complex spells.”
“If it’s not that,” He said, closing his eyes with a pained grimace. “what is it?”
“The protagonist is a moronic fuck and if he could teach the purported rival in a proper way, it would be quite fantastic.” Draco countered, underlining the words with a glare. “
With that, Malfoy walked past him into the bedroom, closing the door with a loud thud.
“Not everything has to be Malfoy-ish.”
“Malfoy, are you –” He chewed the bottom lip with an uncertain frown. Even if he was warming up to Malfoy, he wasn’t certain if it was the right time to ask the one question which was troubling him. “Never-mind.”
He exhaled softly, and avoided Potter’s gaze as he exposed his soul slightly. “A small quest to discover the universe of fairy-tales and fantasies.”
you and for the record, if you aren’t thinking about something happy, you won’t cast one. Ever.” He said with a snort. “
For about two minutes, the blond stared at him in a calculative manner. “I’m not revealing even a bit of it to you, unless it’s reciprocated – Not even a bit.”
It wasn't the easiest of tasks trying to mask his still very present hurt from Potter's earlier words with his usual bouts of sarcasm. But Draco Malfoy was nothing if not obstinate.
“Clearly,” Draco murmured with a soft snort, fidgeting with the hem of the sweater absent-mindedly, while he said, “you’re never in a stable emotional condition.” A beat. “Quit repeating yourself, Potter.”
He walked out of the bedroom, and let out a resigned sigh as his gaze flickered to Malfoy nibbling on a chocolate chip cookie. “You finished half of the batch.”
The sky had intrigued him. In that moment, Draco Malfoy wanted a glimpse into the mind of Harry Potter. One glimpse. Into a mind that held a beautiful night sky. A sky of infinity and starlight.
"Pansy –" Draco warned and directed a sharp glare towards her, which she returned with a similar intensity. "can you not –”
“Oh, you mispronounced
“Oh, we’re on a first-name basis?”
It was rather flattering, in some way.
’ and focused on the slow twinkle of the stars. He was sort of astounded that the brunet figured out what the night sky is the reminder of, considering he was quite oblivious.
It was quieter. It was the sound of the end of chaos. It was silence. The seas were silent, and the skies were still. He wished for this kind of stillness, considering the never-ending chaos he had to deal with.
death now.”
He picked the can of whipped cream, and gave it a slight shake. And a spurt of cream landed on Harry’s face and he cursed. Malfoy stared at him, and a laugh escaped his parted lips.
He didn’t understand his father. Why would he send Harry Potter to Otryazan and risk his own life? To break the unbreakable vow, was to invite your own death. Why would he risk it, if he knew?
“The little blond lesbian from the snake house?” He said, with an air of drama. “You – What the fuck, Potter?”
“No, I wanted to inherit the Malfoy fortune.” Draco murmured with a small shrug, fidgeting with the sleeve of the white sweater.  “write a book, perhaps or –” He had a familiar impish glint in the eyes, which wasn’t a good sign. “or start a
Perhaps he could. Perhaps he could produce a corporeal Patronus.
“Finished them as well, did you?”
In his defense, he hadn’t barged into the manor willingly. He wouldn’t go in there, knowing that Voldemort was having cocktail parties with the death eaters in the manor. “No, Malfoy. I was taken to the manor. I’m not here willingly either – You can blame your precious father for that.”
’ on it. Or to announce
“I believe the technical term is ‘stab’, Malfoy.”
“Cheap shot to play the '
“Why, in the name of Slytherin, are you asking for one of mine, Potter?”
He clenched his jaw and his fists were curled to the side, with his fingernails buried in the calloused palm as he exhaled unevenly. “It’s nothing.”
It wasn’t prancing as it usually would. It was dissolving into the air. Harry felt a shiver run down his spine as he struggled to stay upright, but his knees gave in.
He was merely tolerating Malfoy’s presence, wasn’t he? It wasn’t as if he cared about the blond. Provided he didn’t entirely despise him, he wasn’t particularly fond of him either. “Will you quit staring, Potter?”
am teaching them a precise and useful art."
"Hmm, yes. He'll be back shortly," he replied nonchalantly. "What did you need?"
"How? Am I going to have to blackmail someone?"
Rumours about what had happened in potions class were spreading like fiendfyre at lunch, but of course both teachers were absent, as they had been the entire school year. Professor Longbottom was also noticeably absent, and several students speculated that he might be involved with whatever had happened earlier. Winter holidays were starting at the end of the week, and the students were already excitable, so the new additions to the rumour mill simply fueled their fervor.
"You brought me tea?"
Harry knocked on the door of Greenhouse Two after classes ended the next day. Neville looked up.
"Maybe if you can't see who's fucking you, you'll stop saying it," Harry hissed, groaning himself as Draco shifted on his cock.
They had been moving some of Harry's stuff inside — not that they couldn't have done it much more efficiently through the Floo Network, but then the press wouldn't have anything to report. Apparently none of the reporters were questioning them doing this the most difficult way possible.
This man had ears glinting with multiple piercings — and even one in his nose — but more to the point, he was absolutely
He let his hand fall to the back of Draco's neck, pulling him in to seal their lips together briefly. Harry pulled back slightly and licked his lips. "Sweet," he commented, and Draco burst into laughter. Harry couldn't stop himself from smiling and pulling him forward again to taste that laughter.
Draco nodded and grabbed a handful of Floo powder from Harry's mantel before throwing it into the fire. "3F Gloswell place!" He stepped in and was whirled away, leaving Harry to his thoughts.
that Draco would still be
Several students started to leave for their first classes and Harry gathered his things, glad to at least have something to do. Doing things was nice because then he could pretend to have a purpose and not just
"Yeah. Of course." Harry felt a little off-balance, like he'd missed a step walking down the stairs.
Harry had was actually rather...alluring. It sounded incredibly satisfying to push into everyone's face that everything they thought about him was
'Good' was an insult, it looked hot as hell.
"Hmm, fill me in on the flowers first." The Seventh Year looked speculative.
"Well, that was nice and awkward," George said loudly, offering a hand to Draco. "I'm not expecting to like you, considering you being an absolute dickhead all the time and all that, but I figure if Harry likes you and Ron says you're okay, then I'm not too bothered."
Later, when Harry was curled up in bed, he thought back over the conversation and how oddly vague Hermione had been. Looking back, it did rather seem that she had opinions other than 'hmm' that she was just keeping to herself.
Molly hugged him tightly, and he could feel her crying. "Oh Harry, that's all I want for you, really. I just want you to be happy. I'm just afraid that he's not going to be the one to do that. I had hoped...maybe you and Ginny—"
you," she said gratefully. "I'm pretty sure you've just made my career."
By the time Saturday finally rolled around, Harry found that he was surprisingly anxious. He hadn't thought he would be, but now that it was here and Draco was pacing like a caged animal, and Ron and Hermione were set to be arriving any minute...yeah, anxious was a bit of an understatement.
"I'm sorry," she said a bit tearily, "but I just saw you guys in here and I had to say goodbye again. I'm going to miss both of you so much! You're amazing teachers."
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed past him into the kitchen. "
"Harry, you and I have never liked each other. I appreciate the civility, and maybe it's part of your little guilt-hero complex, but you don't have to struggle through an awkward conversation with me for an hour so you can feel like you're an all-forgiving saint," he said bluntly.
"So," Malfoy ran a nervous hand through his hair, "why did you want to talk?"
. Harry thought she should have known better.
The reporter quickly looked at Harry's left hand and squealed.
"I really don't think you want us to."
yourself to enjoy company anymore. I gave you space because you wanted it, and frankly I needed it to work on healing some of my own wounds. And I'm going to continue doing that, but I'm not going to completely remove myself from your life—"
"What was that?"
"Hah, yeah." He hoped Harry didn't notice how his voice shook. Yes, madly in love and barely able to keep his hands off of him wasn't as far from reality as Draco would like it to be.
"No," Ginny sighed. "Pretty much what's to be expected of you. I think it's a hex, personally, and I'm guessing it's a Death Eater that got away."
"Different?" "Well." They finished at the same time.
"J-Jamie."
The Chosen One, if anyone can fix a reputation it's you."
Harry blushed, holding his hands out. "No, no, there's no lady, I'm not looking for any—" his eye caught a simple gold band with a smooth, round jade stone in the centre, and studded all around with tiny inset white pearls. He bit his lip and glanced back out the window at the reporters still gathered outside.
Draco was actually quite funny, and his confusion about all things Muggle without the disdain of past years was especially entertaining. At some point he seemed to have discovered the concept that 'different doesn't mean bad,' and it showed when he talked about Muggles. He may think some of their ideas were ridiculous, but others he admired, and he seemed able to be confused about certain things without taking it as a sign that Muggles were inferior.
Harry rifled quickly through the crate of records beside the desk and held up the album. “This one?”
"Oh good, you found it! You'll see when you read it. You're both so easy to mess with and tease, but it's all out of love. Read the book, and don't forget that it was
"I know it's been awhile since we've seen each other, but Ron updates me occasionally, and you've changed a lot, mate."
"Erm, last night..." Harry brought up hesitantly.
"...Yep."
Halfway through chopping up the pickled salamander tongue (on the very edge of the table to accommodate for the large cauldron taking up most of the space) he sliced his finger and flinched, throwing the knife down and looking at it accusingly.
Draco had come into his office right as Harry's last class had ended and was lounging obnoxiously on his desk as usual. Harry walked over and sat on the edge of the desk next to Draco and sighed. His shoulders slumped and Draco frowned.
"Well how am I supposed to be taking it? She's the only serious relationship I've ever had! We've essentially been dating since Sixth Year, and we've been married for five years!"
. The professors are always around each other. You never know what they could've just done."
"Right." Draco grabbed the drinks and brought them back out to the living room, Harry following behind, shooting his friends a sheepish look.
"Mmm," Malfoy agreed. "You didn't expect me to be doing well?"
"Who're you talking to?" Draco rounded the corner into the living room.
Harry turned his head to the side and cracked an eye open. "Don't be mean."
This was good for Harry, because if he chose the table he was currently sat at, he could tell easily if someone he didn't want to talk to (which was everyone) was approaching. He wasn't sure what he would do if they approached, but at least he could see. The group study tables were in front of him, and the entrance to the library was to his left, so pretty much everything (besides some spaces between the stacks and alcoves) was in his view.

He rolled his eyes. "I genuinely cannot fathom how you've ever called
"It's all fond, and like you're trying not to smile."
Harry let out a slow breath, and ran a hand over his face. "That really happens? When you go out without me?"
go alone?"
"Okay." Harry said quietly.
"You can use two."
Harry wouldn't say the man looked the embodiment of a long line of proud pureblood aristocracy, but he certainly looked recognisable.
As he walked down the street, he caught sight of the shiny haired person he'd seen from the window leaning against the light post on the corner, smoking a cigarette. Harry thought he looked rather pale and pointy, almost like a Malfoy.
Quite some time later, they both lay still, sprawled out on the bed.
The next morning Hermione, Percy, and Harry were the only ones up and sitting at the table for breakfast. They had been having a perfectly nice conversation until George and Charlie came down the stairs.
"It was surprisingly nice to hang out with you, I'm glad you came."
Harry supposed maybe he and Draco
"Gentlemen, I am disappointed in you. You are both professors, and you are expected to conduct yourselves appropriately at all times. I had hoped you would be able to put your childish rivalry behind you on your own, but it appears not."
"What?" several people asked at once.
Molly had been noticeably less cold to him, and Draco thought Harry must have had that talk with her, which made him a bit uncomfortable. He already felt he was intruding on the family gathering, and the idea of Harry asking for more on his behalf made him feel guilty.
Harry raised his eyebrows, but decided to leave him to his pacing and hand-wringing and muttering. Perhaps he'd be calmer by the time the Gala actually started.
"You make me feel utterly depraved with the things I want to do to you," Harry said, sucking and biting down Draco's neck.

"Wow. Has he been like this ever since...?" Neville asked from where he was sat on his bed with the curtains wide.
record breaks, I'm leaving. I'm not fixing a goddamn thing, and
Harry spent the better part of two hours taking everything out of his trunk and sorting it into piles around the room by type of item, and then putting them away. The stuff for his classroom and office he put back in the trunk (in carefully separated piles).
"Why? Is it something illegal? None of you will be in trouble if it is, I promise."
"Ow!" Several things had painfully struck his feet and legs.
"It was probably something dirty."

Harry managed to reach out for toast, and got it onto his plate. He didn't think he had given his hand permission to let go, but the food had made it to his plate, so he figured it was alright.
"I love you too. Time for class? Ugh, everybody's going to be asking about her."
for part 2!!!
Draco rolled off the sofa and wandered over to survey the kitchen.
"Mr. Potter, what a lovely surprise!" One of the healers greeted, as she did nearly every time Harry showed up.
If Harry could glare daggers, he would've been.
Eventually, he could stall no longer, and he had called them — which led to him now sitting in a booth at the Witch's Veil, thanks to Ron's insistence that he just
Perhaps an hour before Harry was due to leave from work, he looked up from his papers to see that Hermione had kindly let herself into his office.
"Well what is it then?" Ron finally prodded, when he didn't say anything more.
Draco glanced at Harry on his way back to the counter with the potions, and opened his mouth as if to speak, but then closed it, looking away and setting his wares firmly on the counter.
"I guess that's not very helpful then." She thought for a moment, before asking slowly, "Do you...you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but do you ever find yourself enjoying it? I know you said it feels fair, but do you ever want it sometimes?"
"I'll bet," Harry replied a bit breathlessly, which undermined the intended wryness of the words. No matter, though, as it was beginning to look like there wouldn't be any more words spoken for a while.
"What's that pattern meant to be?" Harry asked, looking at the spiky white squiggles.
"Well, we wanted to tell Professor Malfoy, sir, but we didn't know where his rooms were."
"Not much. Hermione's usually talking my ear off fretting about you, but I'm trying to get her to realise it's not gonna work to force you to do what you don't want to."
When they got to the castle, Harry and Draco helped each other set up their classrooms, before going to set up their rooms with all their personal belongings. It was nice to have company. Everything was much more pleasant when there was someone to share chores with and make you laugh.
"You started it. So is that a no on the repeat performance?"
When they finally got to the top, Draco was panting.
"You're welcome," she said, without pausing. "Second of all, before I forget: please just
"Hey, you're not allowed to
"You didn't want to look at any of the books?" Harry shook his head at Draco's question. He'd been plenty amused with watching Draco's ridiculous expressions as he'd looked at the books, plus he'd been approached by a few more fans.
"I guess we'll deal with that later."
could help support when Harry needed it.
want to be awake at whatever hour this was. Behind him, he could feel Draco breathing evenly, clearly not having woken. Maybe if he just ignored it and tried to go back to sleep... The knocking continued.
"Please."
He took the empty vase from his desk and slammed it as hard as he could into the floor. There, that felt slightly better.
"I will be teaching you transfiguration and, to be quite honest, I'm glad I've got you lot first," Professor Ludgor continued, "You're adults, and therefore less likely to shred me to pieces on my first day."
"Why would you go along with that? It's kind of a ridiculous idea, and I thought you tried to avoid the magical world if you could."
"You're awful," Harry snickered. "Maybe lets just sway though, if we're avoiding dancing-related injuries."
"Did you think she was acting oddly?"
"You're limping. Did you get hurt?"
"Filch won't be far behind, we can't look suspicious," she said, hurriedly stuffing the extendible ears into her hijab.
"Why not?"
They finished the first bottle of wine fairly quickly, then two bottles turned into three, and before he knew it, Draco was pronouncing Harry absolutely unfit for Floo travel.
"Blin. Complicated."
Harry and George exchanged a glance.
he continually got his hopes up that things would go smoothly. It was hardly ever the case.
As soon as Draco had gotten back to his flat after that day with Harry in Diagon Alley, he had owled Andromeda. He wasn't sure what response he'd get, seeing as he didn't really know her, and they'd been on opposite sides of the war that most of her family had died in.
She sat on Harry's couch calmly listening to him fret and rant as she sipped her tea. Honestly, she thought that she really shouldn't be all that surprised that Harry hadn't grown out of his juvenile hatred for Malfoy over the past seven years since the battle. It was

Ron looked like he was biting his lip hard enough to hurt with the effort to not laugh, and Harry could swear there were tears in his eyes.
"You really are as dumb as you look. Are you trying to get yourself splinched? Just stay the night."
They all jumped.
"No! This conversation isn't over, I still— !"
Harry laughed. "Go to sleep; your

Harry cast a warming spell on his half-empty mug of hot chocolate and picked it up again. "Open the one from me next," he urged Ron, who looked through his mostly-decimated gift pile for the right one.
"Fine. But I expect chocolate fudge
"What?" Harry asked, knowing full well why they were looking, but spoiling for a fight nonetheless.

The Great Hall quieted down.
"Eh, a little, but my leg hasn't been cooperating either — I swear, I've taken at least 5 muscle relaxant potions today, it's ridiculous." Draco grimaced in sympathy. "I was
"Er, what is this?"
"What?" several of the students asked.

Harry nodded and then groaned as Draco pushed in. It didn't really feel bad or good, it just felt like a lot and he didn't know how to process this new sensation.
He carefully packed the jars in a box, surrounding them with paper, and cast a permanent cushioning charm on the whole thing just in case it got dropped. On the way toward the fireplace, he paused. Ah crap, he probably
It was different, kissing when it wasn't for show, when there was nobody around to interrupt.
"Yes?"
Seamus whistled through his teeth.
if they still hate me," Draco mumbled as Harry went to get the door.
"Can I touch your hair? I've always kind of wanted to."
"They're surely not all studying together?" Ben asked.
Harry looked down to discover he was no longer holding the books. He looked back up at the table, which was scarcely a metre in front of him, and his shoulders sagged. He hadn't even felt himself
"Oh, Draco. What brings you up here so early?" Dinner had been little more than an hour before, and it was the norm for them to spend several hours after in their respective offices this close to the end of year exams.
"I—" Draco wanted to protest how ridiculous the two of them were acting like the whole thing was, but he realised he really didn't have a leg to stand on. "Okay," he relented. "And speaking of dinner," he realised, "I should be leaving so I can go make that."
Harry blinked his eyes open with a small, betrayed noise, but Ginny only rolled her eyes. "Oh no you don't, you big lug. You've got a boyfriend for that now," she said, elbowing him in the side until he shifted his weight off of her.
Draco laughed and laid a hand on Harry's arm.
to be that person; how can you just throw it all away to say you haven't changed?"
Harry heard Draco snort and snap another book shut. He gritted his teeth and answered politely. "No," he cleared his throat uncomfortably. "I'm afraid I'm, er, off the market."
"Ready?"
"Relax. You're so tense." Harry stroked his hands over Draco's sides soothingly.
Harry gave a small smile at her joke.
Harry slid his hands down Draco's sides and whispered in his ear. "Well I'm certainly not complaining—" he traced his tongue over the shell of Draco's ear. "Is it working?" He placed a sucking kiss right below it, eliciting a shiver.

Ginny was quiet for a moment.
"Are there?"
"Thank you for the flowers."
Hermione really did just want to help him, and so did Ron (regardless of whether he'd

Ron leaned toward Harry, as Draco and Hermione continued talking, and Draco placed the baking dish in the centre of the table. Before Ron could say anything though, Harry shot him a look and shook his head. He had a suspicion that he was going to say something inappropriate inquiring after whether certain...
When he arrived back, curry in hand, he discovered a rather impatient owl waiting at his window. Well.
Draco shrugged awkwardly, and looked down at the sofa cushions. Okay so maybe he should have exercised a bit of restraint, but Harry had found it funny at least.
"Why... How are you supposed to be in love with me? That doesn't make any sense!"
well being. Harry.
"Double Potions. Ron and I too. Ron went ahead."
"I just—" Draco's hand tightened in his hair to the point of yanking, and he looked as if he was biting his tongue. "I'm still not accepted back in regular society. I have
hurt himself. He made a small noncommittal noise, and concentrated on the feel of Harry's hands stroking his waist and the feather light kisses on his back until the pain dulled somewhat. Taking a deep breath, he shoved himself back the rest of the way, which honestly just felt more painful. How did people do this regularly?

The sex this time was nearly as violent as it was blissful. It turned out it didn't matter so much
"Feels a bit tight."
"Fuck off. Just, let's get rid of the ghoul or whatever we have to do."

It was a ridiculous situation. He didn’t have a wand, and he was here with his arch nemesis. If it was one of Voldemort’s twisted plans – It was working spectacularly. He had an urge to jump of a cliff, or drown himself. “You – You fucking bastard.”
Right?? I know, must've been surprising.
The teacup shattered by the accidental magic, and the sound echoed deafeningly in the house. He closed his eyes, forcing the thoughts out of his mind and the panic subsided slowly.
“I’m glad we cleared it out,” Draco said underling the words with a glare and placed the cup on the counter, fidgeting with it. “now, what’s is that thing?”
"Hello! Ron and I were just leaving, actually, but it's nice to see you," Hermione said brightly, and Ron chugged the last half of his glass in a truly impressive show of determination.
Harry gave her a strange look. "No, really. I mean it."
Draco's inhaled sharply as Harry nudged his thigh forward into his hard-on.
Only one person had applied for the position: Cho Chang. She'd apparently been working as a sports reporter for Quidditch Quarterly since leaving Hogwarts, and not been very happy at the job. So when she saw the advert in the paper, and remembered the Quibbler being the only publication telling the truth about Voldemort coming back and how Cedric died, she'd decided to interview — and she was an instant fit.
The end of the year came quickly, and with it came the transformation of many Seventh Years from giggly, joking messes to tearful ones.
it could be to
Truly, though Draco called it sickening, he actually thought it was rather sweet; and it would at least make sense to be envious of the easy, quiet rightness to their relationship (which, he was, but he wasn't going to admit that anytime soon), rather than their closeness with Harry.
Harry laughed and tried to tilt Draco's head back up to kiss him on the lips, but Draco resisted.
"Er, yeah, that'd be great." He hadn't expected it to be quite so easy. It wasn't guaranteed yet, though. "There's one thing, erm — there's not really a good way to say this, but I've sort of been disguising my appearance."
Harry nodded vaguely.
"I've...sort of been lying to you guys. For awhile," he admitted sheepishly. "I don't have any excuses, I was being short-sighted and bratty and I decided it was a good idea to lie to everyone. And now I'm in over my head and I need advice, but I can't get any because I was being an idiot and lying to you about it all. So I thought I should come clean at least to you two."
Draco dropped a hand to Harry's bad shoulder and gently massaged it. "Sorry. Is it bad today?"
"Fine," Draco relented, and held out his hand. "And it's
Zylphia was impatient with him about this whole thing as it was, so he couldn't tell
"It's true! I never said there was a problem with it either. The fewer customers, the fewer possibilities to mess up my brewing."
Draco whimpered, squeezing his cock harshly to try and stave of his orgasm. "Oh hell. Oh hell, please please please please."
"Touch yourself," Harry ordered.
"About that..."
"I'm sorry. I was just trying to figure out more about what exactly is happening here, but I didn't want to make you too uncomfortable."
"Alright! Whilst this conversation has been extremely enlightening, I think that's enough for now. You may continue it privately some other time. We'd all better head back to our quarters to get a good night's sleep before the journey home tomorrow." McGonagall finally put an end to the spectator sport that Harry and Draco's conversation had become.
"Shite shite shite shite fuck, oh Merlin I'm gonna come."
Draco sorted through the letters on his desk with an honestly admirable ruthless efficiency.
Zylphia's assistant?"
He finished marking the last one and sighed with relief. Actually, most of the students had done a pretty good job. It seemed that Professor Proteget had actually done her job, which was a relief. He stood and stretched before heading down to dinner.
"Not really." Harry kissed him again.
Death Eater. And you were pardoned. Hardly the same as a Carrow or a Lestrange."
"Professor Potter, Professor Malfoy?" The Slytherin girl asked.
The winter holidays were quickly approaching, and Harry had decided to avoid the Burrow for the second year in a row. He just wasn't ready to subject himself to that much Ginny. He was starting to realise that a lot of the reason their marriage lasted so long was probably that he
They both clambered to their feet, and Harry stretched, popping his back.
Speaking of strange, Draco truly fit the definition. He was very recognisably his past self in mannerisms and looks, but also so
Honestly, Draco thought the Prophet's front page was almost laughable with how frantic it sounded.
They watched silently as she walked up to the office door and knocked quietly.
Fuck, he hoped Draco hadn't noticed his little slip. He didn't quite know what to make of it himself.
He pushed send.
As predicted, Neville had been overjoyed. When Harry firecalled Ron and Hermione, they had been a bit unsure, although Hermione definitely wanted to be supportive. Ron had just been in shock for a while.
"Merlin's beard!" he sighed and mopped his hands over his face. The Gryffindor girl took over.
Harry found himself especially bold when he went out because nobody knew who he was. He could be whoever he wanted and then just...disappear. Hell, he'd probably die of embarrassment if anyone found out he owned clothes like these.
"In any case, I haven't got the time to sit about wondering why I shouldn't be with you when I'm already spending so much of it wondering when we'll get a moment alone that isn't dedicated to sleep."
"What did I tell you about using my name? When did you decide to become so misbehaved?"
"Weasley."
"How are you doing, back at Hogwarts?" She sat down in the seat next to him and faced him, adopting an interested expression. She had always done that when she knew he wanted to brush an issue off so that he knew she was really listening.
get started?"
"Right, you're still being a massive prick. Got it. You know, me and Hermione just want to help you."
Draco scoffed. "Why are you down here? Bored of marking already?"
He sighed. Of course he was being called in. Well they were out of luck — even as awkward as he felt here, he couldn't just leave. Also, he didn't particularly feel like going into work on Christmas.
"Boyfriend," Harry automatically corrected, and Draco tensed and closed his eyes for a moment.
of this discussion. That's a flimsy excuse. You don't care much, and no offence to Draco, but most witches and wizards wouldn't be caught dead with him. And I doubt he has much of a chance with Muggles, with all those moving tattoos. I'd imagine it's a lot harder to ignore when it's not just bits and pieces peeking out of the sleeves."
"No? They usually produce a zombie-like state of single-minded fixation, as do most potions and spells that force large parts of the mind and personality into submission. Why?"
"Sorry, sorry!" She finally settled in, sitting between his legs and leaning back against his chest. "You always were comfy to lie on though."
Draco watched as Harry closed his eyes like a contented cat — possibly listening in to Ron's fantastical story about a recent Auror bust, or perhaps lost in his thoughts.
Draco complied silently, bracing his hands on the tree trunk. Harry hitched the bottom of Draco's robes up onto his back and shoved two slick fingers into him, twisting them brutally. Draco made a strangled sound and Harry yanked his fingers out and slapped Draco's ass hard enough to leave a red handprint.
"Two minutes to midnight. Have you got a resolution?" he asked Draco.
Harry's eyes widened. It was just like Mad-Eye Moody's! He figured something like that must be incredibly rare.
"Wh— erm, I— I don't follow."
The smug look on Draco's face, was quickly wiped off when Harry was over him, mouth against his ear, whispering dirty things and pushing down his boxers. Harry pulled back to completely strip Draco of them, and grabbed his hips, directing him onto his hands and knees.
Harry thought. "To work on being open and honest," he said.
The entire lesson, Harry just existed in a blurry space. Everything around him was blurry, sounds were blurry, even his thoughts were blurry. The lesson slipped by and he registered somehow that it was over and managed to make it back up the several flights of stairs, through the portrait, and to his dormitory. His things slipped from his hands to the floor, and he collapsed on his bed, already falling asleep.
"I love you too. Happy Valentine's Day."
"Mhmm, I somehow don't think you mind the holiday too much. I mean, you've got me here at your mercy." Harry spread his arms wide, and Draco pressed their bodies impossibly closer together.
a displeased glare.
“Just tell her I asked you to ask her about something, I don’t know. She’ll take the out.”
"Yeah, er, I'm fine," Harry spit out quickly, hoping Malfoy would just go away. Dealing with people right now was not what Harry wanted at all.
"Did I say you could make noise?" He slid his fingers back inside and Draco stayed silent, biting his lip.
"What?"
"We've been dating for months, and we've been open about it since we first appeared in the Prophet; it's not
Draco looked up. "No. Well, they did, but I said no. Missy's just being nosey now." His phone vibrated again, and he looked down.
Draco rolled his eyes and leaned back against the wall, crossing his arms. His poker face had always kept him safe before, and the projected cool exterior had snapped into place as if the years he'd spent trying to rid himself of it had never happened.
and we don't really think about
"Am I? Fuck, Harry, that was...
Harry quickly waved his hand and wandlessley scourgified both of them.
Harry left the room, ignoring anyone who might have been in the common room, and walked down to the Great Hall for breakfast on his own. He was just stepping off of the sixth floor staircase when he felt a hand on his shoulder and whirled around. Hermione stood, panting, apparently having run after him from the common room.
"You're staying? Do you not go to the Weasleys'? I was under the impression they were sort of your adoptive family."
. Daphne was pushing for it to be at least five inches, and no way in
Harry leaned back in his chair and grinned.
“Oh, sweetheart,” With an uncertain sigh, he reaches out and places the hand on Draco’s back. “why –”
Draco couldn’t decide if it was a blessing or a curse to be stranded on a severed Island with Harry Potter. A curse, considering the excessive sarcasm and the retorts he had to deal with. Or it was a blessing. At least he had a distraction.
He could get used to this.
“Yes, I
“Or with a nose on.”
He smirked, and inched closer to him until they were almost nose-to-nose. And his heart raced – still felt like there were sparks between them.
carefree laugh around Draco. He had a relaxed face, wrinkles around the eyes – eyes which had a soft light. “
Malfoy nodded, as Harry walked to the fridge and fished out the eggs, butter and milk. He closed it softly, and glanced at the blond placing the metallic items on the prep table. “Can you crack the eggs into the bowl?”
Another shrug. It was sort of awkward. He traced his mind back to the argument, and sighed softly as he raised his eyes to the night sky. “And for what it’s worth, I don’t despise you entirely, Malfoy.”
"You have a terrible way of showing it." Harry chuckled, tripping slightly. Draco kept him from falling, but Harry still pitched forwards, his head resting against Draco's chest. He tried to move away, but Draco wouldn't let him, placing a hand on the small of Harry's back and keeping him against his chest. Harry could just make out a heartbeat from beneath the layers of Draco's soft dress robes.
It caused the familiar flutter in his chest, with a hint of warmth. The blond untwined the tangled fingers, and cleared his throat. “You can point a constellation and not a star?”
“Oh, shut up.”
Tentatively, he placed it in his pocket. It was still warm. Heavy. Still faintly throbbing.
He exhaled unevenly, as a silence ensued. The brunet was raking his gaze over Draco with an intensity, making Draco feel vulnerable in a way that he was not sure he would ever be comfortable with.
“Yeah, sure,” The blond fixed him with a cold stare, yet it was sort of unfocused. Nervous. An uneven breath stuttered out of Draco’s mouth, “your sense of humour –” He clutched the corner of the counter in a rather firm grip while he lifted the other hand to wipe the beads of sweat which had started to form on his forehead, “is awful,” He had a slight quiver to his voice, “now, can you not with the quips –” He flinched at the momentary flicker of lights in the kitchen, “otherwise I’ll light you on fire."
Malfoy placed the paperback on the table, treaded into the bedroom, and closed the door behind him with a loud thud. “Or lock yourself in. A clever idea.”
“Oh, you’re still alive.”
much thanks for the kudos and reads so far<3
Silence.
“Oh, fuck no –” Harry felt a small twinge in his chest, no way he was going to let this go without reconciliation. “We are not finished yet,” that elicited a soft groan out of the blond, “I want answers,
“Plus, if you screw it up,” One corner of Harry's lip twitched and quirked upward. “we won’t sort it out for four or five weeks when your inflated –” A pause. “when rule six in your code of conduct forbids you to.”
He strode into the bedroom with the warm cup of tea.
He snatched the artifact in a swift movement with a curse. “I warned you –” He paused when a low growl escaped Malfoy’s mouth, the flicker of malice crossing the features. “Draco, you weren’t –”
“Is that a compliment or an insult?”
Draco turned the head to the side – Perhaps, not a wise decision – it caused his heart to stutter. The faint light of the moon was falling on the tan skin, a soft silver radiance highlighting the delicate features of Potter’s face.
There was a dark feeling that the horcrux behind him was emitting. And his own panic and desperation. Bellatrix was expectant, gleeful at the prospect of hurting him.
with a small shrug, holding out a hand, which was sort of – odd – Harry Potter didn’t offer Draco Malfoy a helping hand up. Draco was rightfully sceptical. “Come on.”
“Of course not. You can’t expect me to resist a reference, Malfoy. When I was six, I believed that wizards had flying carpets and if you have one – which won’t obey the laws of physics – I wouldn’t be astounded.”
Draco frowned. The final spell had been performed by The Dark Lord, yes. Snape had worked on the rest. He wasn’t sure if he wanted Potter to know that. “Yeah, he did.”
“Not until four.”
"Mhm," Draco lifts his head from the shoulder with a sigh, eyes unfocused, strands of blond hair falling on the forehead. One rests right over his right eye. "w-what?"
“It’s not,” He said with an irritated sigh and closed his eyes for a brief moment while he leaned on the kitchen counter, “would you care to elaborate, Malfoy?”
Harry stifled a groan, and reached for the cup, sipping the warm drink.
“Can I have a quick shower; in case you decide to be Rapunzel and trap yourself in the bedroom?”
“About your common room?” Potter chuckled, shivering slightly. He strode towards the couch, and lowered himself on it.
The blond was on the chair, fingers interlaced with his head bowed. “Our first twenty minutes of the conversation went well,” Harry said with a short, nervous laugh, “I was certain we’d fight, y’know?”
"Pansy, I swear, if you don't leave right now, I'll not return your dress and of course our he fancies the idea – now, can you trouble Blaise or your best friend Ginevra instead?”
“I’ve read Boy Culture once. Or the half of it,” Potter said, and Draco forced the relentless thoughts out of his mind and arched an eyebrow at him. “It was Seamus’, I suppose. I didn’t finish it.”
He fished out the artifact and placed it on the counter with a sigh. It wasn’t a watch. It had a glamour charm on it. A potent charm. One would perceive it as a regular watch, however, it wasn’t one. It was the cup.
"Why would you want to dance with me? We’ve hated each other.”
“It’s not your concern, Malfoy.” He was nervous. Nervous at the prospect of Draco Malfoy finding out what it was. Nervous of the effect it had on Draco. A similar effect. “I’d rather you not pry into the object –” He placed a strainer over the cup and poured the tea through it with a curse. “it’s – it’s not ordinary.”
Harry laughed. Malfoy smiled.
“I was offended when you refused my offer at a friendship,” He said sort of loftily, pulling at a thread on the duvet, but he cast a glance up and stared squarely into Harry’s eyes. “and chose
“You like happy endings.”
"Nothing.”
“It’s –” Draco swallowed and half-turned with a soft sigh, his Adam’s apple bobbed in the soft candlelight and he whispered, “forget it, Potter,” a moment, “you won’t care.”
“Oh, why not?” He said with a sharp laugh. “You said I was the one person you didn’t want to be with and now, you contradict yourself with the ‘
The corners of his mouth twitched and curved into a small, satisfied smile.
“And I’m with an insufferable, excessively sarcastic Gryffindor. I’m at the verge of losing my sanity.”
“So, now you can’t form coherent –” He paused when Draco’s head drifted to his shoulder, the shirt soaking the cold sweat which was forming on his forehead.  “– sentences.”
A silence engulfed them, and he exhaled slowly and felt an odd constriction in his chest. He wanted to refute the untrue assumption. He wasn’t perfect, yet he couldn’t resist a quip.
“Oh for the love of god, can’t you recall when Weasley covered a laugh with a cough?”
“Kind of is considering I’m
“I can save you,” Harry whispered softly, searching his face. It was vulnerable. All of the walls Draco Malfoy had around him were entirely down. “Only if you let me.”
“Please don’t – I acted on instinct, Harry.” He said, with a crack to his voice. “I didn’t want you to die.”
With a chuckle, the brunet removed the black cloak he was wearing and draped it over Draco’s shoulder. “Oh, it’d be worth it to watch you suffer from cold,” He whispered with a slight shiver. “so fucking worth it.”
“Would you prefer a fucking list, Malfoy, or should I say it out-loud?”
“A rule in my code of conduct?”
Harry frantically placed it in the cloak as it started emitting a dark feeling. He couldn’t deal with it in Otryazan without Ron and Hermione and he had to find a way out. Or the wizarding world would suffer.
“I figured, Potter,” Draco said in a soft whisper, nicking the cup of the off the counter with a soft sigh and raised it to the mouth, “and if it’s not a regular watch,” A sip. “what is it?”
points it out, order the fucking prat to shut up,” He said with a snort. “now, if you’re finished, can we head in?”
“I –” Draco paused for a brief second, a small frown creasing his forehead, and the fingers around the brunet’s forearm tensed. “– sure, I wanted to.”
“Yesterday,” Malfoy whispered uncertainly, as he stared at him. “You didn’t fight back, because you’ve been there – In my place – You lost a father figure, didn’t you?”
“Yes, I still fucking despise you.” He said, as he jerked his arm out of the grip and Draco reeled a couple of steps back. Potter turned, with his lips curled and he stared at Draco. “I’d rather die than be with you on a fairy-tale Island.”
"Graceful with your words as always, Potter." He was fine with words. Yet, right then, the words had evaporated out of his mind which, by the way, was Draco’s fault. “Of course, I have that effect on you.”
He decided to summon the closest object.
“You’re a fucking menace, Potter.”
He turned, casting a final glance at the sea, and walked to the house “If you write a code of conduct, ninety-five of the hundred rules will include your favourite Gryffindor, won’t it?”
“A deal,” Malfoy repeated, and pursed his lips and directed a sceptical glance at the brunet. He was thinking. Calculating. “Could you – erm – perhaps teach me the Patronus charm in return?”
"You're drawing attention," He pointed out. “We shouldn’t be drawing attention towards ourselves.”
. It was certainly on the list of
“No, I’m sure you don’t because it’s an emotion specific to the ones who care and you don’t care. You only care about your obligations.”
“Oh, shut up.”
He realized, after a moment of thinking, this his anger was directed at his father. Not Potter. Potter didn’t want to be in Otryazan. He had never asked to be here.
No fucking way.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why what?"
In the evening, he received yet another note. An eagle-owl had a piece of parchment in its beak. He stroked the owl softly, as he unfolded the note. “I

’ out of the precious Chosen One’s mouth. “Now you’re sorry.”
On that night, the owl returned with two notes. One was in the familiar elegant cursive and it said: “
“Are you insane, Potter?”
“I didn’t sign up for reciting fairy-tales while baking cookies, Malfoy.”
"I don't know."
“We’ve already established that.”
In his defense, it was the influence of the cup which caused the small outburst. In fact, Draco was

against The Dark Lord’s wishes.”
“Oh, fantastic.” Draco exhaled tightly, shifting in place with a low grunt. “and your ribs are intact” He said with a snort, elbowing his right side, hard. “it’s rather dramatic to presume it’s fractured.”
“That’s cold, Potter.”
Malfoy laughed, and the flutter returned. He detested it. He detested Malfoy’s laugh or the smirk on his idiotic barbie face. Or the way he brushed the strand of hair out of his fucking face.
He climbed up to the roof, and smiled uncertainly. Malfoy was staring at the sky and humming absent-mindedly, as he carded his fingers through his blond hair.
He fixed his spectacles and crawled out of bed. With a simple wave, the covers folded and were back in place, but he winced. Fantastic. He hadn’t recovered.
Draco paused, and closed it eyes. He carried the burden of the crushing guilt – a consequence of the wrongdoing – It would overwhelm him a bit by bit, and then all at once.
Malfoy stared at him, and his mouth was set in a grim line. “He – I – I fucking asked you a few days ago and you denied it, you bastard. You fucking denied it.”
“Wait,” Draco said, casting the thoughts out of his head as he wandlessly summoned the essence of dittany and a rag. “You aren’t supposed to know–"
Draco flushed at the closeness. It involved a lot of contact and it caused the familiar flicker of panic in him. The air changed around them, permeating with something raw and intense. An earthy, peaty scent with a touch of lilac washed over him. “I – Thank you.”
A heavy silence fell over them, however, the weight wasn't as unbearable as it was a while ago. It was heavy nonetheless. Both boys were simultaneously itching to claw through the veil of silence and start anew their banter but also wanting to confront the elephant in the room face-to-face.
Silence.
"Yes," Draco nods and buries his face into the crook of the brunet's neck. Harry can detect the smile in his voice as he says, "I want the others to know that I'm yours and you're mine - forever."
He watched as Potter removed his coat, and placed it by the door. “Color me surprised – I assumed that it would be slightly similar to the Slytherin common room.”
“M’fine, Potter.” He whispered, voice strained, turned his head to squint at the brunet, “now, for the second time, if we’re finished,” A familiar tense returned to his shoulder, “with our conversation, which, for the record –” The lights in the room started to flicker, in a rather incessant manner, “Oh, fuck."
He gave a shake to his head, staring fixedly at the floor. Harry chuckled, as he poured another portion of the batter into the pan. “Get a few strawberries and whipped cream, if you have it – t’s a request, Malfoy. Wipe the scowl off your face – And chop the strawberries into small slices.”
"Certainly was a rare privilege to watch you turn into a ferret."
“If I’m not, why do you have a smile on your face?”
Harry brushed his finger over the watch. His eyes were still fixed on it, and it was throbbing in his grip. Almost like a second heartbeat. Another soft creak. He blinked, and snapped out of the trance.
“Malfoy?” He resolutely ignored the fact that Malfoy was sort of close to him, or that the grief was plainly visible on his face as he whispered, “I – can you point Sirius? I can’t find it.”
It was kind of surreal to be on the rooftop with Draco Lucius Malfoy – His arch-enemy of six years – He was way too sober to register the situation in his mind. Perhaps one fucking drink would suffice to do so.
Draco smiled. “The skies don’t have a thousand falling stars tonight.”
He slid his hand up the brunet’s chest, over his shoulder and into the soft hair at the base of his neck. His gaze flickered to his lips, and back into his eyes.
"But what if I don't want you?"
“Draco,” He said, and he thought about reaching out to touch Malfoy, he doesn't know why but he thought about it. He didn't, however, and his hand twitched at his side in retaliation. Almost as if he'd surpressed an urge. “Why?”
“Yes,” He said with a brief smirk, yet it was enough to cause a flicker of irritation within Draco. “it appears we’ve deterred from the actual conversation – no, retort-fest – and reached to the conclusion that you’re a bore.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco chuckled, as he muttered a few healing spells. The fractured jaw was mending itself, and the cuts were healing. He stared at the brunet. At the dark rings underneath the eyes. They weren’t unattractive. “Why didn’t you fight back?”
A warm breeze brushed across his face, and he exhaled softly. He wasn’t supposed to be here. He had to destroy the horcruxes. And defeat Voldemort.
Draco’s gaze flickered to the portrait of Narcissa on the wall. She had always loved a sky after sunset. He didn’t. He was fond of the night sky, with the corpses of stars.
“I know,” He said, as he sipped the warm beverage. “Thank you, Draco.”
No. He couldn’t get into that. It was a never-ending circle, and he didn’t want to get into one.
“Your father – He made an unbreakable vow with Voldemort.”
Harry nodded. He had almost demolished the Headmaster’s office. He had zero regrets. In that moment, he saw a gleam in Malfoy’s eyes. Admiration. Awe. Only for one moment.
He closed his eyes again. It was wearing him out, and he cursed under his breath. One fucking spell to repair the glasses – And even that was a task in itself.
“Ouch.” Potter said with an air of drama, placing a palm to his heart as if it was wounded. “Sort of an epic failure if you want to lure a Hufflepuff into the dark side.”
A laugh. Not a chuckle, or a snigger – An actual laugh. And it was a pleasant sound. Draco smiled softly, and raised his eyebrows at him. It was almost unbelievable. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy having a bit of a banter. “Are you quite done, Potter?"
Fantastic. The never-ending chaos wouldn’t cease. He had to focus on the flow of the magic if he wanted to perform advanced spells. An advanced spell to find a way out of Otryazan.
“Good morning,
He could detect another glimmer in the cup. The Head Boy one. He would’ve had the chance if he was in Hogwarts for the seventh year. Yet, one couldn’t be Head Boy
to light –
The smile turned into a scowl while he whispered a variation of profanities. The curses, french ones included, were now familiar to him. “It wasn’t a smile.”
“I can,” Harry chuckled, as he examined the microwave. It was functioning well, and he was thrilled. Chocolate chip cookies would be fantastic. “Your house is completely – mundane. No fancy ceiling lights or artifacts. You have a refrigerator – I didn’t even know you had any idea what a refrigerator was – And a few other essential contraptions.”
“Your point, Potter?”
“He wanted to fucking save you.” Potter said softly, yet he had a cold mien on his face. Careful. Guarded. Calculating. Detached. With the usual sneer.
“You – Harry Potter – willingly read half of the novel?”
“Malfoy I – It wasn’t intentional,” He whispered, and he lowered his gaze to the ground as his mind traced back to the sixth year. “If I had known, I wouldn’t have cast the spell.”
“You’re a fucking menace, Potter.”
On one corner of the bedroom was a canvas easel, and a canvas was placed on it with a wide array of colours and brushes with a palette on the table beside it.
“Fuck off, Potter.”
“I’ve been calling you ‘blond barbie’, ‘Tinkerbell’, ‘Calypso’ and ‘The Little Blond Lesbian’ and a couple more – Oh wait, I suppose it was ‘dramatic blond barbie’ – a couple other things like ‘sour patch’ or ‘rain cloud over my sunshine’ – You don’t want to know.”
With a smirk, he sauntered out of the room and received a variation of profanities. It was certainly amusing to have Potter around and perhaps, it wouldn’t hurt. Or it would, but he was willing to take a chance because he wasn’t in a never-ending circle of loneliness when Harry Potter was around.
Draco inched closer to him, staring into the emerald green eyes. They were beautiful. The back of his fingers stroked his cheek softly. God, he could never let go. “Don’t leave.”
"Your endearments are absolutely absurd, Potter," Draco frowns at him for good measure, "And I'll have you know I detest them."
The uncertainty of the situation scared him.
"Careful." Draco murmured in Harry's ear. "I don’t want to drop you.”
“Wouldn’t dream of anything else,” Harry chuckled. “I didn’t want you to have a fit at seven in the morning.”
(See the end of the chapter for
God, he fucking detested the tiny flutter in his chest.
He wanted to say it in a nonthreatening, offhanded way, only to dissolve the tension hanging in the air, but it sounded a little accusatory.
“Sure, Potter.” Malfoy chuckled, as he placed his cup down. “Know thy enemy.”
"No, you don't," Draco said with a small scoff, "I was fine on the Island without your saviour nonsense,” He forced out through clenched teeth, as if it pained him. "I was painting, re-reading the Lord of the rings and the other novels.” A pause. “I was writing poetry, for heaven's sake."
“Finished the novel yet? Or will you finish it after two decades?"
“I know, Potter.” Draco was smiling, and the familiar childish delight was playing in his eyes. And he didn’t care about the chocolates if that delight would stay in his eyes.
you?”
Draco gave him a soft nod as he rose from the couch. It was a reassurance – A reassurance that it will all even out in the end. “Rest well, Potter.”
It was a cloudless night. The moon wasn’t shining too brightly. The stars were bright and twinkling and he could make out a few constellations with no effort at all.
Malfoy fished out a wand, and fiddled with it, waiting for the tension to clear. In retrospect, he should’ve toned it down a notch instead of an insensitive comment. Or stating the obvious, in this case.
“So, uh,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly “Neverland?”
A quip, instead of a clear-cut response. Or it was the only way it worked out – subtle responses to a serious question – and it was fine.
“Sure, Potter.” Malfoy muttered half-heartedly. He added one half of the dry into the mixing bowl, and the blond whisked it together. Once the consistency was a lot smooth, he added the other half to it.
It was bothering him, and he was morose at work. He hadn’t said anything to offend Harry, had he? He wanted to be called by the sappiest names – He fucking missed them. A lot.
“No, Draco –” A pause. “I figured out where I might’ve screwed up –” He inched closer to the blond. “I can’t stay on an Island forever,” It wasn’t the perfect place to start. “If I had a choice, I wouldn’t leave you in Otryazan.” It elicited a scoff out of Draco. “I wouldn’t want you to be alone.”
Draco focused on the stance – shoulders back with the right ankle turned outward – stretching the arm at the right angle and pointed the wand in the front. “In the ongoing episode, Draco Malfoy has the perfect stance.”
It certainly wasn’t the magic of Otryazan to cause the resistance. It was the watch. With a sigh, he forced it out of his head. He didn’t want to think about it.
“I do,” Malfoy said with a hint of fondness to his voice. A fondness of fairy-tales. A fondness of happy endings and it was kind of – beautiful. “I really do.”
The blond arched an eyebrow at him, the corner of his lip curling into a derisive sneer. “Refrain from providing the pointless retorts once we start practicing, Potter – silence your fucking ego.”
He had to fix it. Wanted to. He hadn’t intended to hurt Draco. Yet, he had. He had wronged Draco. A small, small part of him wasn’t sure. Was considering an alternate way. That part of him was quickly stamped down.
– I was offended.”
“M-My Mother,” He whispered softly, as a shiver ran down his spine. “Is she alive?”
“I never wanted to kill anyone.”
He was sprawled on the soft sand with the blond on the side, out of the corner of his eyes, and he caught a glimpse of a small cut across the top of Draco’s cheekbone. “Oh, my fucking Christ.”
He encircled his hand around the ceramic mug, letting the warmth flow through his fingers.
“I never wanted to be bad.” Malfoy said, with a weak smile. It wasn’t an answer – No – Yet, it said a lot. Yes, it always came down to a choice, but what if Malfoy wasn’t given a choice?
He carded his fingers through his hair in frustration. He wasn’t going to stay here with Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, why are you such a bore?”
"I'm not covered in blood, Malfoy."
“Yes, you’ve mentioned it once,” He could vaguely recall the change in the course of the conversation, when he had confessed that Ron was the first friend, he had in eleven years. “when we were –”
He, however, wasn’t certain if he could the six years of constant enmity. Or, perhaps, he couldn’t forgive Draco for what he had said to Ron and Hermione. Or the others. A small, small part of him wanted to offer a chance to Draco. One chance.
Harry reveals his dream to Draco.
“Godric, Draco,” He lifted the blond up with a small smile and drew him closer, "You're perfect," He raised a slightly trembling hand to Draco's face and his thumb across his cheekbone, "I could dance with you to our favourite song forever."
“All you have to do is roll snow into a ball,” Harry teased, as he pulled on the mittens in his jacket pocket and reached for a clump of snow. Draco pouted, lower lip sticking out, looking extremely adorable.
“Not everything,” He said and the corners of his mouth quirked up. “when you were eleven, you were fond of fairy-tales –
The plan was starting to work. And it was working a lot better than he anticipated.
regret.”
He started the stove, tossing a small piece of butter and melted it around. He poured a small amount of batter into the pan and waited. Malfoy watched him curiously, as he flipped the crepe, catching it effortlessly. He waited for a few seconds before he placed the crepe on a plate. “What do you think you’re doing, Potter?”
“Wasn’t our conversation – no, retort-fest – situated around compliments?”
“If we’re clear –” He whispered in a clear voice, unclasping the hand, “– focus on the wand motion –” He paused and cleared his throat while he inched backward, “– on your stance and cast the charm.”
Harry shifted in place with a soft grunt, fingers searching for the small branch poking one side. “It’s not –” The fingers circled around the thin branch and he tossed it aside. “comfortable.” A sigh. “why are we here?”
Potter's voice was cut short as he stumbled and Draco caught him reflexively, slinging an arm around his waist. “Sure, you can.”
He wasn’t a pretentious, conceited prat that he was at Hogwarts. Beneath the poise and sardonic retorts was a Draco Malfoy who cared about Harry Potter. A small change. “I – we’re friends if you want to be friends.”
Harry stared at him as he said, “It’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
Malfoy cursed. It was a colorful variation of profanities. While the blond was preoccupied with swearing, he winced and clutched the edge of the chair. In retrospect, he should’ve avoided a complex charm.
"It’s dark for me?" Malfoy repeated in disbelief. "You have no idea about the demons I've seen, Potter. Yours aren't the only dark ones."
He flushed at the closeness. It involved a lot of contact and it caused the familiar flicker of panic in him.
He blinked confusedly and fear coursed through his body as he was engulfed by a swirling darkness.
“Fuck,” Malfoy whispered, and realization dawned on him. “You haven’t eaten since – fuck – Four days.”
Banters, Patronuses and a small, private moment
Harry placed the chopped strawberries neatly in the middle, and wandlessly summoned the whipped cream. It was a tiny victory.
“Rivals,
“Fair enough.” Draco smiled. Potter’s death would be a minor inconvenience. He would certainly mourn the crepes. Or the chocolate chip cookies. Or Potter. Only a little. “Why are you out here?”
“No,” Draco said, trying to still his tremble with a force of indifference. “You fucking don’t know if my father is dead – You’re a liar – You fucking don’t know.”
“And you’re indecent.”
With the two warm cups he entered the room. The brunet was perched on the bed and focused on the novel with a frown. “Careful with the tea or you’ll burn your tongue – wait, you should burn it.”
"Wait, you want to -" Draco's eyes widened and the pupils dilated, mouth caught open on the soft vowel sound. "you want to dance?" A moment. “right now, in front of the others?”
If he even performed a simple charm, it would tax him to an extent where he would be out for as long as a week or a month.
"True enough. They're bloody
"Alright guys, you get a demonstration today."
"I love you," Harry repeated, forcing his tongue to obey. It came out in a near-whisper, a final protest from his mouth at being stopped there, but it would have to do. That was all he was
"Sure mate," Ron grinned. "Hurry up and get here so you can explain yourself."

"Gah, I really want to be mad about that, because you're not
disappointed.
"Let's get ourselves together; I'm sure dinner is soon."
wouldn't do to just admit what everybody already knows," Harry grinned.
Draco pulled back, slightly disgruntled. "And show up late to dinner together? I think not."
"It's not in our notes, I already looked."
Draco rolled his eyes, and continued eating his shepherd's pie, wishing that the meal would just be over with already.
"Okay, sure. Being a social butterfly is going to spontaneously make me happy and forget everything. Nevermind the fact I never liked socialising to begin with."
was disgustingly soppy. You git."
Zylphia would do in this situation. Hermione would probably break the spell and say nothing, but get some sort of revenge after. Draco…well actually Draco wasn't such a bad model. He certainly had a way of calmly cutting people down to size when he needed to.
Draco moved up a few inches to reach his face and kissed the corner of his mouth. When Harry turned his head in an attempt to catch his lips, Draco brushed his lips right under Harry's. Harry made a noise of frustration and Draco grinned.
"Bloody
Draco smiled internally, very pleased with his students. He had confidence in them; they were a very smart group.
"Are you done?"
you."
Harry snorted. "I can live with that, I think."
"I'm fine— it's just, your rings!"
Draco's face had closed off at that. "No," he'd said, and that had been the end of that.
Once they'd ordered, they sat in silence, waiting. Draco drummed his fingers on the table, and finally let out a sigh.
— he doubted it'd do anything more than sit and collect dust on the shelf.
He quickly gave the Fat Lady the password and climbed through the portrait hole. Harry didn't stop running until he flopped onto his bed — in the same place, in the same room as it always had been. That part was comforting, but it did little in the face of Harry being surrounded by all of the horrors of last spring.
Draco sighed. "Okay."
"Yeah, well, that was supposed to be
"Yes. We are both fine. It's nothing you need to worry about. Now, open your books to—"
"Thank you, I try."

"Sure. How is your life? What do you do? I assume you live nearby if you shop here?"
"I would also like to introduce the two newest additions to our staff: Professor Malfoy will be taking on the position of Potions Master, and Professor Potter will be your new Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. That will be all for now. Let the feast begin."
"Listen, am I going to be able to go about my business or not?" Harry's patience was already running terribly thin, and honestly, fuck the questions from the press. Why did he ever think this was a good idea anyway?
The week seemed to zip by for Harry in his excitement for Saturday. If he had to guess, he would say he was so pumped because, well, he'd had the same few friends for such a long time that new friends were almost a foreign concept to him. Plus, their last meeting had been
"Great, well can you tell all the crap that's happening in my head it's unnecessary too? Maybe it'll listen to you and stop, but I don't really think telling me my words are unnecessary is too constructive right now."
I thought something was going on before, I mean there's no way there's not, have you
"A person can be rude and my favourite at the same time, darling."
"What, you think I want you to fuck me on this tiny-arse sofa?"
There was so much pressure not to get something wrong or they might not be able to charge the criminal, and sometimes that meant not being able to catch them at all because things had to be done in a certain order and there was only so quickly one could do them. Harry had encountered many of these cases, and had learnt these rules the hard way.
"I'm impressed — I didn't even see her doing the wandwork for this, and it must've all been nonverbal. This is some seriously complicated magic. It's beautiful," Draco said, once he had finished laughing.
"What?" Harry spluttered. "Why did nobody tell me?"
Harry laughed. "I'm not a
Draco sighed. He really didn't need the reminder that all his family was dead on Christmas. He briefly considered telling her to fuck off, but he knew she didn't mean anything by it really.
Harry walked out of the alley where the Apparition point was, and spotted Draco leaning against the brick wall of the tea parlour across the street. Draco apparently did not notice him, as he was staring directly at the ground and ignoring everything else.
He sat back behind Draco and ran his hands over every inch of skin he could reach, admiring all the different colours and patterns colliding on the soft, smooth skin. His hands continued to roam freely as he began leaving open-mouthed kisses up the backs of Draco's thighs. He moved up to mouth at Draco's back and dragged his hands down down over his arse.
Draco felt the beating of the Snitch's wings on his cheek. Merlin. If it was possible to die from extreme pining, he was definitely going to do it. It boggled his mind how Harry could be so close and yet not quite in the way he really wanted, but he found himself hoping to draw out this fake relationship as long as possible, nonetheless.
for part 1, and
They were resituated and completely naked in a few seconds. Harry closed his hand, and when he reopened it it was covered in oil.
Harry glowered and made his way over to his trunk, and all the other boys busied themselves.
Draco set two wine glasses and a bottle of chilled white wine on the table. "You'd better be."
Harry found himself smiling, and clapped along with everyone else. He hadn’t ever really understood before why some people cried at weddings, but he felt a little teary-eyed just now.
happen!"
(kudos if you guess the — very obvious if you know it — song this was inspired by)
It wasn't until what felt like hours later, when they were rutting up against each other in earnest, that Draco suddenly remembered what exactly he was doing.
"You know many things, Harry," he murmured against his skin, as he slowly kissed down his neck, "and I think Minerva has yet to have a problem with that fact. I rather think it's why she hired you."
Harry's frown deepened, and he ran a hand over Draco's left arm, fingers trailing over the faded mark.
"He does quite well; you shouldn't have a problem."
"Sorry mate, but you slept with
Another kiss was dropped on a cheekbone, then one on his nose, then an eyebrow, chin, eyelid, and another and another until his face was being peppered with kisses. After holding the laughter in for quite a while, a giggle finally slipped past his lips and he opened his eyes to see Draco grinning down at him. Harry straightened up and and grabbed Draco by the face to kiss him properly.
"They won't suspect anything, I promise." Harry actually could
The words on the blackboard were in a gorgeous calligraphy, the beauty of which was undermined by the words themselves.
"Apparently some of the prefects were patrolling and they heard crashing sounds from your classroom and...Peeves sort of...wrecked it."
Harry continued on with his lecture and the class stayed silent.
Draco groaned. "That better not be a proposal, Potter."
"But, Harry, you...are you sure you're alright?"
Harry sighed. “He’s very different, really. It took me by surprise how difficult it was
"You don't have to lie. We can stop." Harry hugged him, arms coming up to cross his chest, bodies pressed tightly together.
Draco writhed and moaned under him as Harry slowly tongued him and stretched him open.
Grabbing the finished cup of coffee as it floated toward him, he headed back upstairs to get dressed.
"These look...slim."
Harry hummed in agreement. "Good."
Harry shoved the book into his cloak and gathered up the remaining things in his classroom. He had to share this with Draco.
"I don't like it, but I can deal with it. People pretty much leave me alone, it's just Ron and Hermione really that are too much."
"I'm not drunk! It's just wine."
"You're both going to be
Harry thought. He looked so good like that with his lips stretched around Harry's cock. Draco hollowed his cheeks and sucked, and Harry's eyes fell closed again, hands clenching tightly in Draco's hair seemingly of their own accord.

Harry had just dismissed his last class, and was now attempting to establish an order in which he might begin his marking for the evening. He was

It wasn't as if he really had anything 'normal' in his life anymore. There were no routines established more than a month or so ago. Everything was so different already, that he supposed something truly strange on top of that had thrown him off.
to set foot in my shop. Well, how can I help you today? Are you looking for anything in particular?"
Draco sighed against the back of his neck, absentmindedly stroking his thumb over the warm skin of Harry's stomach. "Yeah, okay. You have to order and get the door though."
"Right, that's why you're always grabbing it in pain."
He pulled back with a sigh. Utterly unfair that he had to go back to
"What? To whom?" he repeated. "Once I rejected my father's arranged marriage, I didn't really have any options. I'm a Death Eater, Harry."
"Apparate?" Harry asked, heading toward an alley.
"Alright, I won't be needing help in here any longer, I can manage on my own. Take a few biscuits back out there with you." She waved a tin over and pressed it into his hands. "Just don't let the little ones spoil their appetites."
"At risk of sounding like a soppy git...you amaze me constantly," Draco said reverently. "Not the sex — well, yes the sex is amazing, but that's not what I meant. You're just really amazing, okay?"
Draco knew he could only stall for so much longer, he'd have to face the music at some point today. At least Harry would be there as a buffer.
Harry just hummed and rubbed his cheek against Draco's hair, where it had begun to grow out a bit.
His blonde hair was reflecting the light obnoxiously. Fantastic. Harry ducked his head down and absorbed himself with the book. He didn't need Malfoy to see him, as the only two interactions they'd had so far this year had gone
"Really? Well I'll be sure to leave a complaint if the potions aren't up to the usual standard."
"You okay?"
that Draco might have grown as a person, and that I just fucking like him."
Harry snorted. "Okay, great Mal—
"I love you too, prat." Harry said softly, and flicked his hand to remove the ball of soft light hovering above the bed.
As it was, he still hadn't ever bought any Muggle clothes for himself, so it was just the least worn of Dudley's old hand-me-downs with a few simple resizing charms. He thought he'd actually done a rather good job with the charms — the fit wasn't half bad.
Harry pulled back again when Draco tried to kiss him, and shrugged, utterly serious. "The one on my forehead used to sometimes."
He wandered over to Bartholomew's cage, where the owl was roosting, with one eye open, watching Harry shrewdly.
"Harry? Did you even sleep?"

say earlier that the only way we'd be able to shag for the next week and a half would be if it was on your desk in between marking assignments."
Harry cleared his throat, as he came up to the front of the shop, ready to leave for the day after cleaning up.
"And don't even give me that shite about him not feeling the same way. I told you about all the ridiculous soppy eyes you make at him and everything, but he does it all right back. Come on Harry, it's so obvious it's painful."

"No, I'm glad they're excitable and that they like the lessons, because I just want to teach them as much as I can. And the fact that they like it is great, because that'll make them remember. I just want them to succeed so much — I mean, in general — my students are great, just sometimes—"
"Good. I'll leave first. Follow me in five."
Harry ran a hand through his hair as he stared out the window. Merlin, he was happier than anything that he'd moved to Muggle London — he got to lose the constant stress of being The Harry Potter in the public eye — but he was wondering if he should want to see his friends more often. He saw Ron and Hermione sometimes at work, but, well, the Ministry was a busy place so it's not like they ever really just sat about talking.

He checked quickly that everything was in order in the back room, and came back up front to tell Zylphia.
"Make me."
He kicked the trunk the students had given them (which Harry had insisted he take, since his own already had an undetectable extension charm on it). He blamed it for reminding him of Harry.
Harry seemed almost like a different person. He was still very essentially
It had honestly gotten beyond ridiculous. Just the night before, after several other failed escapades, they had gone out on a date. A bona fide date — to a fancy restaurant with a private room and everything. They'd held hands across the table and Apparated back to Harry's place together, yet the next day the headlines speculated whether the two were new

Maybe it wasn't the job that Harry had always dreamed of, but there was something about the shop that seemed quite comfortable. In any case, he'd had plenty of experience with this sort of thing whilst serving detentions for Snape. Perhaps he could help out with some of the prepared potions that were sold; if she had trouble with her hands, she'd probably need it.
"They're actually
"Welp. This should be fun." Harry rolled out of bed and headed out of the room.
The students looked lost.
He performed a quick spell, then went ahead and cleaned everything else up as well.
"Draco, you
"No, worse."
"Just what I said. You know, most employers would start wondering about your character, with all these lies you seem to like."
"Hm. I haven't thought about it." He was quiet for several moments. "I think... I think maybe my resolution is to...let hope in. Don't be so scared to be optimistic," he finally said, looking at Harry.
"I can't go out alone without people steering their children away, and hissing that they wish I was in Azk—

"So that'll be a yes, then."
"No." Harry lapsed back into silence and Hermione made a 'well carry on with it then' gesture with her hand.
Actually, Harry wondered just what had become of him. Last he'd heard, Malfoy had all but disappeared from wizarding society and was living amongst the Muggles, which Harry had found incredibly ironic.
Rodya's brow creased for a moment. "Zylphia's potions assistant?"

got to talk to him." It was clear she was decided.
They both stood and Harry went to the front to pay, waving Draco off when he tried to hand him money. Draco frowned, but put his wallet back in his pocket and followed him out the door.
"What in Godric's name are you doing to yourself, Harry?!" she asked angrily. That, at least, proved to Harry that this had all been a conscious effort on her part to be calm and patient with him as he'd suspected.
When he finally got home, he made a beeline for the bedroom and flopped straight onto the bed, face first, which made Bartholomew screech in surprise.
"Two!"
"Nothing. We aren't trying to offend you. There's nothing wrong with you as a teacher, it's just..." They trailed off unhelpfully.
Harry sighed and tilted his head a bit so he could speak quietly in her ear without Percy or Molly overhearing. He told her nearly everything, editing small bits to leave out that they weren't

"Into the pit of vipers we go," Draco muttered in his ear as he took his arm. Harry heard him cast a discreet cleaning charm over both of them to get rid of the stray ashes from the Floo, and then they were headed into the throng.

"Ugh, that one's practically illegible."
"Ah, Harry, wait — stop."
They couldn't entirely be blamed though; Draco had gone out so he could pick a particular herb at sunset on the first day of Jupiter going into retrograde. The problem was, this particular plant was quite rare, and whilst there had been a

"Not sure, maybe it's that special instinct of yours. Like how animals won't eat

He knew her arguments technically made sense, but he didn't like them, and didn't want to deviate (even

He pulled back slightly and smiled.

He'd used the Floo in the headmistress's office to visit Teddy at Andromeda's that night, which was thoroughly depressing now that Teddy was old enough to really understand that his parents were dead and what that meant. That he would never remember them or get to meet them. That he never got the chance. His hair was bubblegum pink and his eyes were the same golden yellow colour as Remus's had been — features of his parents that he only knew from pictures. Harry had almost started crying the moment he saw him, and immediately wrapped the eight year old boy in his arms.
Harry moped around Andromeda's house. He missed Draco, but he refused to admit it — really, they barely passed as friends.
He'd only said it to Harry (at least,
"Feeling okay?" He mouthed, and Draco nodded and squeezed his hand. He didn't need to be ruining Harry's holiday too with his petty jealousy.
"Hey, okay there's no need for that. I'm sorry I didn't realise, but you don't have to be
Harry failed to muster up the courage every day for two weeks. It was now the middle of October, and he found himself more drawn to Draco than ever, but also more scared. He really didn't want to mess this up.
the only one being excluded. In which case, I'm horribly offended. Am I not fit enough for you?"
"Shite." Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "I didn't expect this to happen, if it helps?"
"Would now be a good time to tell you I've been in love with you for ages too?" he asked.
"Top secret Ministry stuff and all that, you know?" Harry waved his hand dismissively.
He flipped through for a while. “I'm not sure if it's even in here. Wait— it looks pretty similar to this one, maybe from a different angle. And the colours are different."
, Harry. Are you sure you really want to do this? Introduce me to the family? When it's not even real? They all hate me anyway — they
"Thank you, this is really amazing." He paused and frowned as he realised something. "Wait, it's for both of us?"
"Mhm, that's the idea," Harry murmured, slipping his fingers back out, and quickly slicking himself up and pushing inside.
Unfortunately, when he got back to his house, a certain tetchy owl was waiting for him. Harry heaved a deep sigh and mentally prepared himself to sacrifice his dinner for a second time to that menace of an owl.
"I can personally assure you they will love it. Your cooking is great, and the surest way into Ron's good books is through his stomach."
They ended up spending hours in the Leaky Cauldron, first talking about how they missed school and their students, and then other, more arbitrary things. They were discussing the uses of scarab beetles (or rather,
There was a wide-eyed silence, and then, "Cult?" "Oh yeah, definitely cult."
"Mmm Harry— Harry, fuck, I—"
He sat hesitantly at the staff table. It still felt weird, like he wasn't supposed to be up there, and it was so different. From his seat, he could see everything at all four tables below him. Before, when he used to sit at the Gryffindor table, he had just been one drop in the middle of a sea of students.
Draco paused, considering the last of Harry's words. "I
There must have been a muting charm on the door, because he hadn't heard anything before, but Harry was definitely hearing it now. He appeared to have walked into a spat between Dean and Seamus. Unfortunate, he thought, considering how close they'd always been. But they'd be fine — arguments were inevitable in a friendship like that.
be awkward between them after this?
Draco felt the cold glass of the windowpane abruptly pressed against his back, and he grabbed the windowsill to steady himself as he was shoved violently back into reality. Right, this was just a performance.
," Draco sounded miffed. "I'm willing to bet all of my students like me better than they like you. I'm an excellent teacher. You're just a bumbling fool who got tired of chasing bad guys for too long."
This was confirmed when he stepped through the Floo, and saw two plates of pasta on the table and an empty pot scrubbing itself in the sink. 'Cooking for four' indeed.
He was terribly impressed with Draco, though, and he thought perhaps he
"I am disappointed you did not manage to conduct yourselves properly in my absence. I will, however, let it go this once because I am too emotionally tired to properly scold you for it," he said softly.
She showed him the ingredients she needed prepared and where the tools and jars were, and then went back up to the front, leaving Harry to work alone.
"Maybe, but it's your own fault for playing chess for over two hours."
reached out to
Having had their fill, and succeeded in refusing the house elves' offers for second desserts, they retreated back to their room before dinner was over, grateful that the halls were clear of people and ghosts to question their absence in the Great Hall.
"I've been thinking," Draco forged ahead, "and whilst I still don't think what you did was right," he took a deep breath. "I think we should continue."
"Me too— shite! It's Mrs. Norris."
"Brace yourself," Harry leaned over to mutter in Draco's ear as they walked quickly toward the bookshop. "The reporters will be coming any moment now."
Confused, he flipped open to the front page.
. We're supposed to be going to Zylphia and her spouse's place for New Years tomorrow and it's apparently like a tradition for him, and I can't just
Harry blushed, but snapped back at him, "Well if we can whip up a time-turner, we shouldn't have to go
He tried again, and settled into a sort of rhythm that Draco was rather loudly appreciative of. Draco pushed back against his face, and Harry reached around to jerk him off at the same time.
"Do you want to go to bed, love?" Draco asked quietly, and Harry turned back to him. "Thought you might like to go upstairs if you're falling asleep."
Draco paused. "Yeah? You're sure?" He had spent the night a few times before, but never with such obviously...salacious intentions.
," Harry gasped.
They both dozed off on the floor, only waking from the cold to move into their bed some hours later. And if they ached a bit the next day, well, nobody had to know
"Er...alright." Harry said. Draco seemed to have gone through many different stages of...emotion or whatever
The Dark Lord was not here. The war was over. He was safe. Breathe.
Speaking of Zylphia, she seemed a very no-nonsense woman, but not altogether unlikeable. She had knotted, bony extremities, though it didn't seem to be from old age; her dark brown skin — darker even than Hermione's — showed few wrinkles, and her immaculately braided hair had only one regal streak of grey through it. She was perhaps fifty (quite young indeed, for a witch), and had the stern-set face of one who knew exactly what she expected of life.

"Am not; tipsy Draco is nice. He leaves me presents sometimes."
"Harry, you are utterly ridiculous, would you like me to make sure it's safe for you?"
Draco eyed him shrewdly. "I see. Okay, let's go. Apparate or use the Floo?"
Draco stopped his pacing. "Need I remind you that
chose to move in. Do you think I'd do that if I knew I'd have to choke down gross food every night?"
"Not to be all 'I'm the saviour of the wizarding world,' but you'd think they'd trust my judgement and ability to defend myself a bit more."
"Please don't." Draco said, looking at Harry through half lidded eyes, which seemed to convey quite the opposite message. Harry still looked somewhat unsure, and Draco doubled down.
As soon as the portrait of fruit swung open, Harry was bombarded with polite greetings from the house elves. When he explained that he had missed dinner, the overly concerned elves quickly brought out several platters of meat, potatoes, steamed vegetables, and bread rolls. It smelled delicious, and Harry thanked them and dug in exhuberantly, but cautiously. If he ate too quickly, he'd feel worse than if he hadn't eaten at all.
"You're aware he's an
know I am; I distinctly remember having several conversations about it."
Draco opened the door and gave Harry a tired smile. "I think I'm done for the night."
"I can assure you no such thing would ever happen under my watch."
Ron challenged him to a game of wizard's chess after presents, which had ended up lasting for several hours, as they were well matched opponents. The game had only ended when George set off a firecracker in the living room, which went loose and zipped across the board, scattering the pieces. Draco strongly suspected Harry had had something to do with this.
Harry got up and straightened his glasses, carding a hand through his hair.
"Mhm. Just checking."
Zylphia didn't comment on their newly-published relationship at all, which Harry was grateful for, although it did put him a little on edge not to know what she was thinking. He'd seen yesterday's Prophet peeking out from behind the register when he'd come in, so he knew she'd read it.
When Harry got back to Grimmauld place, he sat down and thought about what had happened the day before.
"Well, it's been awhile hasn't it, young man?"
"Yes, yes." Draco felt one of his hands released, and began stroking his cock to relieve the aching hardness.
Draco sighed again. "Okay." He braced himself as Harry pulled away, but dutifully straightened up and went to the partially open window.
"Professor Potter, how lovely to have you back in the castle. I trust you remember where the Defence classroom is?"
"Okay. Let's just wait and see what else happens at dinner."
They talked and reminisced about their years teaching at Hogwarts so far, and at some point during dessert, they got to talking about the beginnings of their relationship.
"Yeah, they are; it's just, ever since Ginny and I divorced...well, I don't want to be around her that much, so I just skip out. I'll probably go next year or something, it's just still too soon."
, and
Harry finished the champagne in his glass and waved it to the nearest table, holding his hand out for Draco. "It's an awful song, but dance with me anyway."
"No; a fucking headache, actually," Harry sighed. "Not a good morning, which is why I'm late."
in tattoos. Besides that, his hair looked messy and unintentionally grown out, and everyone knew what ponces Malfoys were about their hair.
to have a break."
"Whatever you say."
"No. Stay. I'm fine." He reached out an arm, feeling around behind himself for Harry. "I just need a cuddle."
Finally, after the fourth reminder that he was welcome for dinner any time, and that they missed seeing him, and after he exhaustively explained everything about his not-so-new-anymore job, there was a moment of silence, and Harry seized the opportunity.
"Alright. I'll see you on Monday."
"What the hell was that?" Ron hissed.
Draco sighed. "Yes, I supposed it is."
— you can't go around bickering all the time anymore! I know you don't particularly like him, and neither do I. He was a right git throughout most of our time at Hogwarts, and he made some really poor decisions, but he also didn't turn you in to the snatchers. And

Harry shrugged. "It was Draco's idea, really. Get people to stop treating me like I'm some sort of perfect, untouchable saviour, and stop treating him like a pariah."
make dinner. He was surprised to find the kitchen...noisy.
Sometime around mid-November, Harry realised that Draco had pretty much completely moved into his quarters. Draco's trunk sat next to his own against the wall. Their robes hung side by side in the wardrobe. Draco's toothbrush was lying on his counter, and the shower now had about three times the number of bath products in it. Most importantly, though, Draco himself was always around.
When they all pulled back, she wiped her eyes too.
time anyway. He continued up to the dorm room, and was surprised to open the door to a wash of noise.
Harry grimaced at the fawning and cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Erm, not really, sorry. I wasn't really heading any place in particular, I just stopped in."
“Sure, whatever." Just because he worked in a record shop didn't mean he had to know the name of
, no wonder we broke up."
Draco pulled back and kissed him, and he could feel Harry grinning against him. "Hell yeah I will. Nobody'll know what hit 'em. Give me three years and we'll have the best goddamn wedding anyone's ever seen."
"So where do you want to go?" Ginny asked, turning to Harry as he slouched toward the portrait hole.
"Do your
Draco blushed. "Listen, I am not at my top performance right now — my brain is a bit addled, thanks to a certain
He felt a quick kitten lick on the underside of his cock and cracked his eyes back open. Then Draco was tracing his tongue flat up the bottom of his dick and circling the head. He licked down the sides and Harry groaned.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that. That's personal." There was a long pause before he continued. "Did you get anyone telling you what an amazing teacher you are today?"
Draco was content to spend the next few hours watching Harry and the others unwrapping their gifts and chattering away. He'd gotten rather comfortable leant forward onto the back of the sofa with his chin resting on Harry's shoulder, occasionally making quiet comments or jokes in Harry's ear.
Draco picked up his book from the floor and quickly found his page, actually placing the bookmark in his place so he might not have this problem again. "I take it I won't be reading anymore tonight?" He questioned, gesturing towards the book.
But, selfishly, Harry continued to keep his mouth shut. He had to tell him. He
"Wait, wait. Start at the beginning, please. What are you going to mess up?"
"Why do I feel like you're not being completely honest with me?"
"Well, what about Christmas? All the people who stayed said you two did practically nothing besides talk to each other, and at the feast neither of you were paying attention to anything besides each other, and there was whispering and putting hats on each other...
"I never thought I'd ever have to explain to
Harry opened the door and looked in. "No ghoul — we're all clear."
"Nothing too bad. Nothing completely inappropriate."
The choice was taken out of his hands, however, when the door swung open and Harry greeted him.
"I, ah, I really don't care at this point."
"Thank you, I guess. Teddy's fun to hang out with, you should visit him sometime. He's still living with your aunt Andromeda. He's a metamorphmagus, you know, it can be very entertaining to play fantasy."
He looked a bit dazed, but Draco supposed he was realising the gravity of what they'd just done and the shitestorm in the papers that was sure to follow.
Harry didn't respond, and Draco slid his first finger in, beginning to kiss along Harry's thigh as he stretched him open. He continued kissing and nipping and sucking everywhere he could reach whilst fingering him, until he was absolutely certain he'd done a good enough job opening him up. It wouldn't do to have another Badger Incident.
Molly eyed Draco speculatively. She didn't know how he did it. None of the Weasley's had ever seen Harry like this before, but Draco somehow managed it with seemingly no effort. Then again, Harry seemed to bring out a certain ebullience in Draco as well, which Molly doubted was normal for him considering what all the poor child had been through and done.
"I...well you don't have to wear it on your ring finger."
"You'd know that
never did, but I know for a fact that Terry Boot and Daphne Greengrass made quite a habit of it." He narrowed his eyes. "Perhaps it was just them, now that I think of it."
. We're also co-workers, and he doesn't feel the same way about me. And what about Ginny? And what would people say? I mean he was a Death Eater, and we were rivals...people wouldn't get it. And they would hate Draco. And none of that matters
." He glanced back at the ring. "Are those
"You git, how much is it gonna take to get you incoherent enough to stop making smart remarks?"
Harry snorted and stepped back to let them in. "It's fine, it wasn't really anything serious."
When they reached the door, Draco balked again.
Harry laughed and followed behind him.
Harry looked uncomfortable.
This was, of course, provided he was actually
He rolled his eyes. "Oh yes, I'm practically a sofa."
at this point, anything for a break from focusing so intensely on these essays.
Harry gave him a patronising face that quite clearly said 'Are you serious?' and kissed the stupid smirk off of his face. Like a spark to kerosene, their earlier abandon returned, and Draco began walking Harry backward, intending to meet a wall to push him against. Things, however, have a tendency not to go according to plan whenever possible, and this was no exception.
"Neville? Definitely. The other two will be fine. Maybe just surprised. Really, they don't hate you anymore — although Ron still thinks you're an annoying git."
Ron," Harry called after Ron as he left the room.
"I cannot for the
"What?" he asked.
"Hey, he's gotten pretty fit," Harry flushed again. "And he's...nice."
"No, no. Well, not really. Kind of," Draco stumbled over his words, thinking how best to explain. "I'm, er, publicly dating Harry. Harry Potter."
"Right."
When nobody answered, Harry shrugged and continued on with his lesson.
"What
Harry," a voice behind him said. Oh great, now there was going to be more conversation.
The next morning, they were back at Hogwarts. They went down to breakfast late, after reading the Prophet in the privacy of their room. It would do no good to be reading it for the first time in the view of those who had already done so.
"Oh, you're
"Should've asked more specifically," Philip grumbled.
"Mr. Potter?"
"Yes, well, as I've told you more times than I can possibly recall, if you'll provide them, why should I waste time on the simple ones when I've got experimenting to do? Of course, I still need to make the more complex ones that your hapless
"Good morning, Professor Malfoy!"
"Trust me, that's
"Makes sense," Matt finally muttered. He wasn't even on the clock, Missy had just called him in to come gossip, and he was definitely high.
The students, of course, did
Draco kissed him. He didn't weigh the chances that things would go badly, like he did with most of his decisions, he just acted on impulse. Maybe that was a sign of real emotion.
"I found something! Oh, this is good," a Gryffindor girl spoke up.
Oh goddammit, Harry and his theatrics were going to be the fucking death of him. He let out a sigh, and turned back, crouching and taking Harry's chin gently in his hand to kiss him on the lips.
"Wow, thanks Ron."
"Quit whingeing, at least you got
Of course, it didn't take long for the reporters to find them, but they weren't allowed actually into the shop. That didn't stop them from crowding about the windows snapping photos and taking notes, though.
Draco also had plans for Valentine's Day, although his were much more halfhearted. He greeted his Sixth Year class.
idea what was happening, and that he would
"Goodnight Draco."
"Ahh, yes." He opened his eyes as Draco started slowly bobbing his head and Draco was still staring up at him. He kept eye contact for awhile, mesmerised, before pulling Draco off of his cock and kissing him deeply.
Really, Charlie was the only other one who seemed to get annoyed with it, as the rest
"I rather think they've gotten the point," Draco said, with much less conviction than he'd intended.
There was a somewhat lengthy pause before, "Yes. I'm fine." Draco's teeth were clenched tightly, and he had already begun sweating from the exertion of staying completely still. So perhaps he
Harry rolled his eyes. "Think I know you better than that. Just open it."
Harry nodded. That actually sounded really lovely.
He wordlessly summoned his glasses from the bedside table and quickly skimmed the article. Merlin's beard, they actually hadn't.
"But how do you pay? I don't get how you could 'pay back' whatever lives or anything you think you owe?"
"Growing up, finding yourself, anything. Take your pick. Make up a new one. I'm just proud. It's nice to see my baby brother happy."
Slowly, as he began to stroke, he trailed his tongue up along Draco's hip bone and then down into the divot next to it. Draco watched, mesmerised, as Harry pressed open mouthed kisses all along his hips and the tops of his thighs. Finally he lifted his head and stilled his hand, grinning crookedly.
Harry tilted his head back over the back of the sofa to look up at him. "Hey love." Harry cupped his cheek with a hand, looking up at him with those soft eyes, and
"Please go order some food before I pass out," Draco said, eyes squeezed shut once again, and Harry complied.
"They don't just like me
"Yeah, because you just mercifully allow her to. Not because she just does it and you deal with it."
"I've just got to, you know, prepare. A prick seems a lot bigger when you're trying to shove it somewhere it doesn't belong."
"Oh right, can't soil that sparkling reputation—" he sneered.
"Mhm, whatever you say dear."

"Well when you say it like that—"
, how am I ever going to look them in the eye again?"

. Draco did look good, distractingly good, even, in steely grey robes with dark navy accents. Harry didn't know a thing about fashion or colour theory or any of that, but it made his pale skin and hair stand out in a truly arresting way.
Ron's grin broke through. "Mate. You're not lying."
"Well, I don't know exactly everything I caused, and whom it affected and how much, but some of it I do know. For the rest of it I make estimates. Either way I determine what I owe, and I...pay. Usually for something new every day. It usually takes several times a day."
"Okay. I don't exactly know, I mean I know the gist—"
"Just startled," Seamus said in a measuring voice.
"Oh would you leave off? I wasn't raised in a bloody
"It's
When they sat down on the sofa together though, Draco whispered in his ear.
Harry could practically feel her eyes through the wall. He cringed.
, okay? Relax."
Draco kissed him again.
Draco kissed him briefly, before pulling back and heading back to the bedroom.
"Fine."
"I think we can do away with the seemly six inches of space if nobody's watching."
"Draco, I found a—"
feeling better."
"Well we're not," Harry yawned. Draco glared at him.
"I...we don't have to. But I'm okay with it if you are, I mean, like I said it's not like we can see anybody else. It's fine if you don't want to though." Harry started to shift away, but Draco tightened his legs around him.
the bloody smoke had drifted its way over to the flock of starlings, spooking them and making the murmuration move up over his chest, which blotted out the ornate pocket watch there. "Messing up the order of things," he murmured. "Now how am I meant to tell the time?"
. And the Weasley's had a full on
Fine, it was likely important anyway, as he was pretty sure Minerva was the only one who even knew where this room was.
The next morning at breakfast, Harry and Draco sat next to each other silently as usual, each reading the morning Prophet. As such, they were unaware of the rumour mill bubbling more boisterously than usual below.
Draco paused again, briefly, before continuing his sorting. "Oh, right."
"What did I just miss?" Harry asked warily.
As Draco's head slowly cleared, he became aware that he had his hand on Harry's cock.
"It wasn't even a full moon last night, stupid," the person behind them corrected.
"You know very well that I can, however I shall make no such attempt. I'm going to lie here and nap, and there will be neither eating nor any necking from me."
, rotting away there 'til I die like my fucking father, that it would be a public service if somebody went ahead and took me out for
“Yes, Sherlock Holmes.” Harry said, intending it to sound sarcastic and instead, it sounded sort of cross. He focused on the star, twinkling slightly against the night sky. “Bless your observational skills.”
Harry felt a warmth in his face, and he was certain he couldn’t sound confident in return. Instead, he cleared his throat, and angled for a quip, “well, since you asked so nicely.”
Completely undeterred, Harry laughs heartily and leans forward to rub his cheek against Draco's before biting it, earning him a squawk of annoyance.
“I defeated a hundred dementors at once when I produced a corporeal Patronus for the first time, but no – I’m not the overachieving Chosen One you resented at Hogwarts.”
to watch how indecisive you are with your words.”
“Can you get me a cup of tea,” Harry said, a smirk on his face and a glint in his eyes. “Darling?”
His voice was small. Almost pained.
Harry curled his fingers around the artifact and whispered a charm, forcing it to wear out. The artifact quivered underneath his fingertips. It was warmer. Twitching. The charm wore out. He placed it on the kitchen counter.
“It’s the only house to have never produced a dark wizard.”
He decided to avoid thinking about Aunt Petunia. Or about any of the Dursley’s. Or of Voldemort, as he sauntered into the kitchen in a measured pace.
With that, Malfoy released the grip on him and he turned to face the blond. “I don’t care, Malfoy. I’ve never intentionally hurt you. Or given you a reason to detest me –”
"The precious Saviour to the rescue," the hint of ruefulness returned for a brief second, "you treaded over the hope, when you said that you will find a way out," Draco turned his head to Harry, "Once you do, I'm certain you won't care if I'm on a severed Island, alone and suffering,” A beat. “You won't fucking care at all."
There was a pause and Harry slowly shook his head. "You know we can't, Malfoy. In there – In the real world, we’re enemies. This is a fantasy, and we can’t have that."
Malfoy’s head snapped up, and he stared at him with a stone-cold face. “I warned you, Potter. Do not go there.”
Harry turned to Draco with a faint smile while he continued to ignore the flutter in his chest when the blond returned the smile and said, "You lost a bet, didn't you?"
Draco gave him a weak smile, and a slight shake to the head. He would’ve left Potter to stew in his own misery, because Draco Malfoy didn’t care about Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy didn’t invite the others in, to heal them. He didn’t care. He never wanted to care. Not even about Harry Potter. “You can’t stay out here, Potter.”
Not for a while. He didn’t want a reminder of the war, if he didn’t have a way out of Otryazan. Sometimes he felt as if it would swallow him whole. He wanted to escape the feeling. Even is only for a little while.
, it wasn’t wise of you to offer your cloak, which, by the way –
“You should tone down the sarcasm, Potter.”
It was to save his family. It was self-preservation. But that was only a tiny fraction of it. He was a knot of fear, resentment, uncertainty and panic. He couldn’t stop the trembling in his voice as he said, “I – I didn’t want to.”
“If it was plain atrocious,” He quoted, with a smirk on the corner of his mouth as he imitated the blond. It was rather amusing to watch the brief irritation flicker across his face, and the hint of a smile. “why are you smiling?”
A distant rummaging. The clink of teacups. Draco smiled – Potter was searching the note he hadn’t written.
He fished out the pocket-watch which was warm against his palm. It had caused the nightmare. A nightmare based on one of the worst moments of his life. The moment Sirius had fallen through the veil.
His confronting words were tainted with a dash of bitterness and a pinch of fragility that were too prominent to conceal.
“I – I figured it would’ve – figured that it was related to your mother.”
“I’m not defining little – Quit smirking, Potter – And don’t grill me over the outrageous contraptions.”
“Young Sherlock solves the unsolvable riddle
“Malfoy,” Harry said, staring at the silver smoke, slightly brighter which was slightly brighter than before. “what are you thinking about while casting the Patronus?”
"Would it be absurd if I said I never thought of either of those?"
Draco shivered slightly at the cold, and Harry concentrated on creating a bubble of warmth around them.
"Is that your best?" He asked Draco.
Harry made a considering sound. "Actually, I'm sure they wouldn't phrase it quite like that. More like 'Wow, Harry Potter moving in with a new friend — they must be good buds!'"
Harry let his eyes fall back shut. “Oh, I just...” He made a vague waving motion with his hand. “Don’t need to get a wand just for that,” he mumbled.
Goodbyes took an incredibly long time, as there were just so many people.
. Isolating himself was strictly off of her list of acceptable things, and really, he thought that was ridiculous. Everybody needs a bit of time to themselves, and Harry just happened to want a lot.
he went out of his way to find recipes that Draco could enjoy too. He was unbearably sweet sometimes.
"Let's take it. Jade said the entrance to Potter's room was a pillar."
"I have several questions, but I just...I don't even want to ask."
Draco felt himself start to harden again, and he grabbed both his and Harry's cocks in his hand, jerking them off together.
"No. Don't mind him, really. He's not fond of strangers — well, strangers to
Harry frowned. "Shouldn't be. I know what I'm doing, I trust you."
"Don't I know it. I do what I can. So, see you tomorrow?"
"Harry! It's been awhile!" Draco beamed.
"That'll do just fine. You got more done than I expected. Pretty neat work too. I'd imagine you'd do just fine — that is, if you still want the job?"
"Draco, I wasn't trying to make you look like the bad guy—"
“What should we listen to tonight?”
"Draco! Why didn't you knock? Teddy's excited to meet you."
didn't make any."
For a moment, he wondered if maybe if he just ignored it, it would go away — but a quick time-checking charm told him it must be important for someone to wake him at two in the morning. Probably Minerva, since she was the only one who knew where his rooms were, as far as he knew.
"Tiring. They were alright though. The students mostly seemed to know what they should up to now, but they never want to focus. The Sixth Year Gryffindor/Slytherin class has been the worst so far — they just would not shut up. I had to start taking points, but I think they like me anyway though, it's weird."
After a bit of fruitless wandering, Harry found his feet leading him back to the dark maze of the dungeons. The monotony of the twisting stone corridors, lit so dimly compared to the rest of the castle, was soothing to Harry's chaotic brain. It quelled the constant overwhelmed feeling that wasn't really due to any one thing in particular. His thoughts had permission to be blank or to wander slowly and passively through inoffensive topics.
, is what he needed. How to tell your fake-boyfriend/friend-with-benefits that you've actually been sort-of in love with him for months and kept it to yourself because you're a horrible friend and person.
Because there's only one bed, and neither of us is going to let the other sleep on the sofa." Harry shrugged. "Ron and I've shared a bed loads of times."
Hermione nodded. "Alright then, I've got plenty of ministerial bollocks to deal with now."
"Yeah. All that thrashing around; I felt bad, but at least Malfoy woke him up." Draco could hear drawers in the bureau being opened and shut, but he kept his eyes closed.
him and might want to talk to him, no less.
Okay, that was mean. He didn't mean that, and he was fairly certain she wasn't the nosey Petunia Dursley type.
Harry was settled in on the Weasleys' overstuffed sofa, with Ron's arm around him, and his arm hanging over Ron's shoulder to hold hands with Hermione, who was leant against Ron's other side. Draco quickly made his way over to him, and dragged a padded stool over from under a window to behind the couch, hoping he'd feel a little less awkward if he could physically keep himself on the periphery of the room.
"You know the fact that you were in here is gonna be everywhere by breakfast."
"I'm sorry! I really don't want to mess up this friendship thing we have going on. I don't know why I did that, I just acted without thinking."
"Hi mum! Sorry, I got caught up with some friends—"
He had decided to just skip dinner tonight and continue hiding here, but he would definitely need to stop by the kitchens later. He'd already eaten the sandwich he'd taken with him a few hours ago, and he would need more food before night. Harry wasn't looking forward to confronting the kitchen without Dobby's exuberant presence, but that was a problem for when he got to it.
He finished back in Flourish and Blotts, and as he was browsing, he saw a book called ‘Unconventional Potions Ingredients and Substitutes.’ It seemed like the sort of book Draco found interesting, so he bought it. He could give it to him when they next saw each other.
Draco shot them an icy glare.
Great, now he was going to be thinking about that at work all day.
Harry brought his right hand up to kiss his ring, and Draco's eyes finally flickered up to his.
No, nope, please don't tell me. And never tell me how much that cost; I'll probably hyperventilate."
He managed to successfully make it down in time for breakfast in clean, non-wrinkled robes, and was irrationally proud of that fact.
"Five!"
He thought about how close the Weasleys all seemed, and how readily and happily they had accepted Harry as one of their own, and...well he
" Draco asked, still looking markedly unimpressed.
Harry shook his head. "No, it's okay." He intertwined his hand with Draco's, resting them on his stomach. "I just...haven't had a nightmare like that in a while." He shook his head again. "I haven't slept in here since the war, that's probably what's messing with me."
By the time they made it back to their flat, Draco and Harry were both exhausted.
I was listening to 'Closer' by Nine Inch Nails whilst I wrote this, if that tells you anything...
Most importantly, it made him remember how monumental everything he'd done was, and how much pain and destruction he had actually caused. Nobody else ever focused on that part — they just bypassed it as necessary for him to be the great one that 'saved the wizarding world'.
The next thing Draco knew, he was pinned to the sheets underneath a very eager Harry. Clothes were quickly shed, and soon their bodies were grinding against each other, hands roving every inch of available skin.
"Only with my Sixth Years. I definitely don't trust those hormonal Third and Fourth Years with them."
"I'm good, I'm good. Draco just...said something unexpectedly funny."
Maybe Zylphia just needed more points of interest in her life. Harry would fixate on his employee too, if the only other interesting thing was the mundane runnings of an apothecary with a rather unappetising name that, as far as he knew, no one ever used.
fault, could it? It was Harry's fault for getting him so worked up in the first place.
Harry crossed his arms and sat back, unsure how to take this. "I don't get what's so funny."
person, and it seemed that if anyone was to understand, it would be her.
He trudged up the staircases to the room and quietly slipped in, trying not to wake Draco. He shuffled off his shoes and discarded his robes on the sofa, which he was sure Draco wouldn't be too pleased about, but Harry would put them away tomorrow. Or at least, that's what he told himself.
He complied, adopting a more serious expression. "So?"
"Wouldn't you just like to think it's about how good you are," Draco bit out as Harry kissed and sucked under his jaw.
"I'll do what I like."
uncertain.
"So what's this? I didn't know you could cook."
Malfoy didn't seem to mind and checked the time. "Bloody hell, it is. When did that happen?"
It was nice. It was sort of like he could feel his magic coursing through his body, amplified so that he felt tingly all over.
gonna fuck
"Draco, solnyshko, it's been so long! Zylphie keeps telling me you stop by her shop, but I haven't seen your face in almost six months — what's that about, hm? Come, sit down."
"I'm definitely not all-forgiving, and we both know I'm nothing like a saint," he sighed. "This isn't part of my 'guilt-hero complex,'" he held up air quotes, "I'm just...interested."
"Take the stupid robes off, and you might get some domineering in."

"Is this supposed to be a joke?" she asked somewhat angrily.
The next morning when he awoke, Harry rolled over, and silently watched Draco reading the paper. He looked so soft in the morning light, just having awoken, his hair in messy, fluffed up waves.
"Okay," Harry answered, stuffing more mashed potatoes in his mouth. He had the feeling that the pompous git was going to try to one-up his comment yesterday about them liking him.
"Okay. Just know that you can come to me with anything."
He saw the second Harry realised he'd fucked up in his eyes.
"You should really start locking your Floo, mate," Ron advised for probably the thousandth time.
"Do you want to move?"
Malfoy sighed deeply.
Harry turned back to the fire, still smiling. "I'm going to go eat my breakfast before it gets cold, but I'll ask him tonight about meeting up with you guys, yeah?"
"Why?"
here."
And then there was also Ginevra.
"Whatever,
They heard a disgruntled groan.
"Uh. Yes," the man replied slowly. "Sorry,
He hesitated a moment, his finger over the OK button to send. None of his coworkers had said anything about the whole dating-another-man thing, but he didn't want to push it. Then again, it's not like it wasn't bound to come up again at some point anyway...
Harry had offered to work every day, because it wasn't as if he had much better to do, but Zylphia insisted she didn't need his help on the weekends. This at least meant he had a much more regular schedule visiting the children's ward, as weekends were his only free afternoons. He felt a bit bad that he could only visit in the evenings during the week because often the smaller children were already asleep, but there wasn't much to be done about that, and he had yet to hear the children complain.

"Is it true that you're still single?"
She sighed and turned to face him. "It's not that I don't

Draco rolled onto his back and sighed as well. "I wish there was more time in the day."
"I assume this truce is simply a pledge to stop antagonising each other...Harry?"
As much as it seemed like his superiors and coworkers had expected him to insist on continuing Auror work despite the healers having cautioned him to take a break, he found that he didn't actually
"I just forced myself to Gryffindor through it. Just go up and ask."
"I'm seeing that," Harry replied quietly. "Now I know what Hermione was on about when she kept calling him a 'polite young man' after I sent the RSVP for the wedding. I've never seen him so well behaved."
"I… yes," the shopkeeper said uncertainly. "Are you

It took Harry a few minutes to gather his wits about him, and— ah
"Really? You guys don't really seem to have been hanging out that much."

They weren't as tight as he had feared, though, merely fitted. He crossed his arms. "Well?"

the man's concern, but still. It bothered him to hear Draco just referred to as 'that Malfoy child' like he wasn't his own adult, like he was still just a spoilt brat tagging along in his father's footsteps.

He snatched his wand and stalked out into the corridor, nearly colliding with someone. Draco caught himself and looked around. His jaw tightened. Great, students. Fuck. He turned straight around and slammed the pillar behind him.
" Derek whispered alarmedly to the others, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco shrugged. "It's your plan."
"Are y—"
, but he's gonna hate me."
"Because!" Harry spluttered. "Students! Other professors—"
"Welcome, I'm Professor Ludgor, as Headmistress McGonagall has informed you," A voice boomed from the front of the room, with a slight lisp. The man it came from looked quite average and unassuming. Not at all the type who would produce a voice as forceful as that. He had wavy black hair and a face that looked as if you could mould it like clay, although it was currently quite flat.
, then, and not your head of house?" He recognised dimly that two of them were Slytherin, although the other was a Gryffindor.
been had been good-natured, so Harry figured he had at the very least found a way to deal with this lot.
"Yes, I do Ron. Any more clever observations?"
"Go fuck yourself, Potter." He slammed the front door behind him, and Harry blinked and let out a slow breath.
"I didn't do anything too much, did I? Did I hurt you?"
By the end of two hours, he managed to put everything in order by summoning the ingredients one by one, and repairing the jars. Once he had ascertained that his veritaserum was, in fact, miraculously untouched, he dragged himself up to the sixth floor.
"No fault of yours — it's just all of
"That tickles you know. Not fair to play on weaknesses," he murmured against Draco's lips.
"Was not! We all know you're gonna bring him, seemed cold to just say
"Yeah, about that. What happened to being a Gryffindor — why haven't you told him?"
. And I've never heard of a spell that does anything like this." Harry crossed his arms and tightened his features. He was

He spent over an hour quietly removing billywig stings, siphoning out the pus, and putting each into their respective jars. Nearly another hour passed as he tied bunches of knotgrass together into neat bundles. Just as he finished weighing and packaging the last of the ginger root, the shopkeeper cleared her throat. Harry whipped his head up, startled.
