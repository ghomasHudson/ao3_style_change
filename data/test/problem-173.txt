“We would have to, of course. It’s still part of the Trauma Recovery Programme. But it’s rather a matter of wanting to write in it, really.” I thought for a moment about how I could explain it best, wondering why Dean wanted to know in the first place or whether he was just trying to make polite conversation. At last, I said, “It’s sometimes easier to be open and honest when you’re writing things down.”
There was nobody around though, and so I furtively picked up a couple of booklets about St. Mungo’s that were sandwiched between large texts about working in the Unspeakable Office and being an Alchemist (is that a job? Can people really turn straw into gold?)
One thing I can definitely guarantee is that you are, without doubt, included as a member of Ron’s friends. There is no way on Earth that he’d have been so candid with you otherwise. He most especially wouldn’t have taken your advice.
You cursed the Ministry and the glorification of war heroes and I wholeheartedly agree. But refuse the medal as an act of boycotting for everything that’s been wrong with the Ministry pre-War and during the War? Complaining about the sentences people like me (lawfully) endure and about making Draco Malfoy a scapegoat?
I’ve been putting off buying a new owl because I didn’t think that I was ready, but we’ve sent and received so many pieces of correspondence the last few months that I can’t put it off any longer. Besides, Draco, my darling, we're both wizards, and a magical home just isn’t the real deal without a few creatures to share our space with.
Her comment makes perfect sense to me. After all, isn’t that everything that we were taught about what our innate magic was? The magical cortex of our brains conducts and then alters the world around us, according to our whims and desires. If I was with you now – and I kissed you – then it makes sense that our magic would fuse and blend together. Mm. That is another terribly gorgeous thought.
I’m so glad that you told me about your trepidations, Harry. Honesty: we’ll take that to the bedroom, shall we? We will talk to each other and find out what feels good and what would hurt or feel too much. Promise me.
After you had only a short glance, you looked up into my face, and before I knew it, you hugged me urgently. You hugged me just like you had earlier yesterday after you came home from Paris. Comforting and loving and like seeing me in pain is more than you could bear.
The discussion quieted somewhat down, and I was still smiling to myself because you didn’t defend the Harpies despite wearing your beloved Harpies shirt. I put an arm around you to pull you closer, and while doing that, I noticed that Dean was watching me. Or that’s what I thought was happening anyway.
Much to my surprise, you replied, “Or we Bombarda everything.” With a challenging smirk, putting on a little show for me by throwing a small cauldron up and blasting it mid-air into dust.
Also, I laughed at your comment that Mother and Andromeda might be the avid quill-drivers behind those implorations for us to get bonded right after Hogwarts. I don’t know much about Aunt Andromeda yet, except that she seems to have an orchard and a thing for cherry jam, but I can’t shake the feeling that she and Mother have more in common than one might expect at first glance. I mean, they must have grown up together even if to me that’s hard to imagine.
I know that I told you about thinking of several things we experienced together this year. But care to know how I started? I thought that I’d learn best from this bloke who cast his first Patronus at the age of thirteen, perhaps you’ve heard of him. So my mind was set on yesterday when I entered your mind, seeing all the warmth and love, light, people who love and care about you. Casting a Legilimens – you don’t only see but you feel the memories in all the intensity that you feel them, or at least I would suppose so.
What exactly is the catch, darling? You’re everything one could wish for, there must be something on the downside. My heart melts reading your words. I had to dreamily stare off into space for the better part of an hour before I could focus again.
When I start thinking about you, then I’ll start thinking about how I fancy you as well. One thing will lead to another, and then the clock will be chiming midnight. I’ll have written three sides of a love letter, and not spared a single word for practicalities.
I shrugged, knowing that the man was telling the truth. “It’s all rubbish,” I answered. “It’s all salacious lies, made up to sell papers.” I sighed, feeling my shoulders sag. “And I’m so weary of it all,” I said, wanting him to understand that I hadn’t courted any of those headlines. “Draco and I didn’t set out to hurt anyone… All we did was find each other. Fall in love was as inevitable as the tide, yet all this gossip circulating around us… It’s as if the world wants to make us into something sordid. Something sleazy.”
PS: As for your request, yes, absolutely, of course! Just send an owl order to Twilfitt and Tattings for whatever you might want or need and fill out my name at the top of the form. My account password is masterofthesnitch. (You can stop smirking right now. It isn’t THAT funny.)
Oh darling, but it was lovely. “Good morning,” you said when you woke, your voice all husky, soft with sleep. You stretched your arms around me and smiled, a lazy, happy thing.
You’ll be my platonic, friendly non-date come February too. I need to have you beside me, Draco, for I simply won’t manage the formal cutlery otherwise. A polite, well-bred chap like you is incapable of leaving a friend in their hour of need, and I need your advice on how to make small talk, what I ought to include in my speech and in the choosing of formal robes. I need you, Draco. I’m not fibbing when I say I can’t collect that damned medal without you next to me.
Perhaps I sounded insecure, because Hermione answered, “I’m sure, Harry would suffer through the inconveniences of writing a letter for you, Draco.”
It sounds like you get along with Edward’s grandmother quite well which makes it even better. I grinned and rolled my eyes when I read that you used my words to tell her about us. How did you say it? Were you nervous? Did it show? Or did you say it all conversationally like it’s no big deal? It sort of feels like we had said it together, using the same words. I only rolled my eyes because you’re such a Hufflepuff. Good Circe, I love you.
once again today with that stupid, nonsensical ‘Potter’s Preferences Exposé’ headline - which, when I investigated it further, was simply a hatchet-job from the quill of the always-vile Romilda Vane - but I do feel confident that we can change the storyline being fed to the public.
You're the first person that I've told this to, Draco, but I’ve decided that I’m going to give Teddy the medal when he’s old enough to understand what it means. It’s his mum and dad that should be receiving this honour, not I. They were the true heroes of the Battle of Hogwarts. But I’m not allowing any melancholy to slip into my letter, Draco Malfoy.
I hope your day wasn’t as demanding as you anticipated. But it does feel like everything starts to get a bit more hectic, doesn’t it? Teachers have been nagging us with revision since the start of term, but they somehow manage to top that as of late.
Your story reminded me of Barnfield’s poem a little bit. ‘His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet.’ Please don’t think me presumptive, but I bet that’s why Blaise got so erect at the mere sight of you. I doubt he’d have been able to help himself.
, just waiting for you. Now I’m living in full bloom, yours for all eternity. Goodness, but you’ll laugh and roll your eyes when you read this. I’m just of a very romantic bent this evening; the words are simply pouring out of my quill.
Don’t worry if you can’t get to me yet. I’ve found myself a classroom, and I’ve got my cloak. I’m perfectly safe from Filch and his blasted cat. One word of warning though: Peeves has been throwing furniture around, so just be careful. I wouldn’t want you to get hurt, especially when you’re supposed to be tucked up in your bed. I happen to love you, rather a lot.
I love you, darling. You must think me a randy git, don’t you? I didn’t mean to get you into trouble. No idea what got into me there. But in my defence – you are exceptionally fit. How could I not be every bit as besotted and hungry for you as I am?
My hands moved to get more of you into my arms and I heard the change in your breathing. Basically, I had to restrain myself from reaching down to your crotch, from feeling up whether you were as hard for me as I expected. To be frank, all I wanted to do at this moment was push you down on your knees, watching you undo my fly and take out my hard cock, tongue darting over my glans before you’d close your lips around my length. Fuck, I wanted you to suck me off so bad. It was all I could think about.
Part of me wants to believe that we were meant for each other even then, that even with the diversities in our lives, our families and our politics that if we’d just have talked, then we’d have found that common bond that brought us together.
Oh, Draco. By the time that I Apparated back to Grimmauld, you’d convinced yourself of a thousand awful outcomes. You imagined that they’d already collected your Mother from Whitby, and transported her to Azkaban, and that they’d revoked your probation in a secret meeting of the Wizengamot. Your face was parchment white and your whole body was trembling.
I feel like I’m boasting right now, but please know that I don’t have such intentions, not at all. My heart kind of fell to pieces when I read that you barely managed to properly read and write by the age of nine. You’re so much smarter than you give yourself credit for even though you grew up at such a disadvantage and with horrible relatives. I wish I could pull you into a hug when I think about it. I’d hold you and tuck your head under my chin right now. I’d protect you.
“She’s happy,” he said, but his face told me that something was bugging him. “She seems really happy, but… Honestly? It feels like she has a thousand other things on her mind. It doesn’t feel like marrying me is on her list of top priorities right now.” After a moment and a hapless sigh, he added, “I am not one of her priorities, I reckon.”
We didn’t even change our position or anything, but there was this moment that having your prick inside me went from feeling okay-I-can-handle-this to oh-sweet-Circe-yes. I completely understand now why you’re always begging me please when I’m inside of you. And while your heavy, hot cock pushed inside of me, your firm body moved against mine, gracing my leaking cock every so often with your movements. A wild combination of “Please, Harry, please,” started to tumble from my lips automatically.
Do I love you? Those were the very last words that you wrote in our diary. My love for you is entire, my darling. You know, don’t you, that you ought not to ask me questions like that. You’ll make me appallingly poetic.
You suggested talking to Luna about us. To ‘tell her the story of how you and I fell in love by letter, just like a courting couple from another, long-ago era.’ And to tease about the wedding we planned. We do plan for a wedding, don’t we? It feels so much better, teasing and discussing this as a couple rather than having a ring and a genuflexion. I love you. I simply know that we’ll bond. It’s inevitable.
Whitby Abbey. That building is one of my most vivid recollections of the two days that I stayed in the town.
The first thing you need to know is that I saw my Mind Healer twice this week. Just like it must’ve been the case with you, I apparently gave off the air that something upset me. I told him the truth and I tried to stick to it as well as my tongue allowed me to. We haven’t been talking about personas, which I shall try to ask him about next time, but about pride, control, and fears of loss.
My darling boy. I was speechless. I was dumbfounded. Time was vanishing like grains of sand through a timer, and I knew that Robards would soon return to take your mother back to her cell. We were running out of time.
Right now, I’m sitting in the Library ignoring my Potions homework, and I can see Madam Pince out of the corner of my eye. She’s charming a great pile of returned books back onto the shelves and looking very prim and proper as she does so. Who would have believed that beneath her starchy surface beat a romantic heart?
Okay, you seem to not only worry about your ex but about Malfoy as well. I mean, you could talk to him. Hexing you would book him a direct Portkey right into the Northern Sea anyway. Keep me updated, should you decide to converse with him. Perhaps you’re even right. Maybe the git would like to see a friendly face.
I’m going to suggest something to you, something that has been playing on my mind ever since. No doubt you’ll disagree. Feel free to hex my idea with that terribly razor-sharp tongue of yours.
I’m sorry love, these memories bring up guilt and remorse. I shall talk about this another time when I can tell you names and details, not a vague tale about an imprudent boy. Yet I’m honoured that you think Mother and I are alike. I’m sure she would love to hear that. People usually tell me that I take after Father. Please don’t forget your words. I’d be over the moon to hear you say them to Mother one day.
But Merlin, I don’t know what to say. We probably shouldn’t even put too much attention to it, but I’m… I’m not even cross, I’m just fucking exhausted of this shit.
I think, perhaps, that those Occlumency lessons you suggested might be a very good idea. Start this week? I promise to be a very diligent student too, so no flirting with my teacher to try and wriggle out of work. We’ll save the wriggling for afterwards, my darling, and it’ll be all the sweeter for it.
“We did,” I said and thought about your words. I thought about our options and, quite frankly, I thought about summer classes I had years ago, dealing with how to represent oneself in the papers. I’m not a slave to the public relations etiquette I’ve learnt, but perhaps it helped me clear my thoughts, for I thought about your words, written into our diary days ago.
Two more things: firstly, thanks for wanting to help Theo. Secondly, care for a jog tomorrow morning?
I will certainly be in the need of releasing some stress after that. I should really practice some charms. I’ve heard once that it’s important to moisten your skin against the dry winter air, as we were exposed to only yesterday. Oh Circe, I want you right now. I feel utterly touch-deprived. My hands would be all over you and I’d kiss your neck, and I’m sure you’d throw your head back and whimper my name. I’d tease you for a while, love, just because I could. But I’d deliver eventually. Promise.
Still, I can scarcely be blamed. Not when last night was as wonderful as they were. I’ve never been the romantic type before I met you, and I’d never have imagined that getting all trussed up – and sharing delicious food – could be erotic. It felt like all my senses were blooming, all at once. The kisses, the food, sharing a dessert. Every part was magic.
Thank you for your lovely letter, so full of lovely sentiments and kind words. Life here in Whatstandwell is as quiet as always, though the garden is beginning to look very beautiful with the advent of the Spring. It is simultaneously a time of great hope, is it not, as the flowers bloom and their scents drift in through the windows, and also a time of great melancholy.
I shall be your date for the ceremony in honour of Potter, my love. And for any other celebration there is yet to come all of which you’d rather not attend. I will dress up and look prim and posh for you. We’ll behave ourselves for the event until we get home where we tear each other’s clothes off. I’m sure a good shag will take your mind off the Ministry’s disingenuity. You can hardly say no to that, love. Circe, I’m feeling a little touch-deprived right now.
As I envisioned all this and even went through some nifty charms, I’d use to revive one or the other pillar, I couldn’t help but wonder how Muggles built such huge places. I know that they have useful apparatus and motor-operated machines today, but I’m quite certain these inventions don’t reach back as far as the history of the Abbey.
There’s only one thing I know for sure, Potter. You’ll be with me and I’ll be with you. No way to wriggle out of this. And I’m sure that the island won’t tire us in such a comparatively short period of our lives. But then, my lovely, un-travelled gentleman, I shall take you to every place under the skies that I’ve ever been to. And perhaps, you will even travel the world before that, catch up on all the lovely experiences you had to miss out on. Only as long as I know you will come back into my arms.
I’m not sure how to start this. But since it’s almost been a week since we have received these diaries and we’re supposed to report back tomorrow, I thought I’d might as well give it a go tonight.
I won’t forget this moment. Not ever. You, Harry, are the reason I’m learning to love myself again. And not for just anything that I grew up to be, but for who I am at heart. All my flaws seem just that tad less unforgivable in the light of your eyes.
The thing that cinched your freedom though? That wasn’t anything I said, Draco. It wasn’t anything that I did on your behalf. You saved yourself, by refusing to identify me when my face was swollen out of shape at Malfoy Manor. When I'd been brought to your family, kidnapped by Snatchers. The two of us had been schoolmates since the age of eleven and I know without a single shadow of doubt that you knew it was me knelt in front of you.
Hope I don’t wake you. I know it’s very early. I slept well enough but when I woke up a few minutes ago, there was no way I’d doze off again.
Darling, if I’d had a chance to reply, I’d have kissed all of your worries away. Nothing is going to be taken away from you, Draco. Not a single thing. I promise. Not my love, not your new home, and not our future that takes shape with every conversation that we have.
What you’re right about is that I would possibly have retreated from anyone who could have met me at the Three Broomsticks that day for one reason or another that my ridiculously proud sense of otherness would’ve come up with.
“You see… My fiancé and I have this vision. With the insatiable public at our necks, Harry and I would prefer to start off in self-employment after Hogwarts. Of course, I can only speak for myself, but as Harry will certainly have a say in this business, I’m certain that he and I both would be immensely grateful. We’d be greatly in your debt, Professor.”
They were the best lessons. The whole class used to dissolve into uproar, messing about, charming dirty sketches to the blackboard, making the desks levitate… Merlin, I’m howling with laughter. We were such little gits, and I bet your gang weren’t much better. What was the best trick that you ever pulled?
I’m happy that you enjoyed the poems. People usually tend to make fun of me whenever I commit the fatal error of letting someone know that I’m voluntarily reading old, romantic poetry. Don’t get the idea that I’m sitting around in alcoves all day, book in lap, sighing about some lad’s dramatic effusions on eternal love and worms nibbling away on virginity (very pleased that you enjoyed this line).
Gracious. With all that fabulous yearning I’m surprised that I found time to eat my marmalade on toast.
Tell me if I’m being that Hufflepuffish prat again and I’ll go back to my previous cynical persona, swear to Merlin. It’s never that far from the surface.
“You’ve no legal training, Mr Potter, and haven't even graduated yet from Hogwarts. Ergo: this is nothing more than a curious and inappropriate social call.” He frowned at me, and shuffled a sheaf of parchment that he held tight in his hands. “I’ll require a series of signatures from you, of course. Proof that we’ve provided Mrs Malfoy with her legal entitlements.” He huffed out a breath. “I must say that I’m disappointed in the way that things have turned out. I dearly hoped that you’d have applied to join my force straight out of school; that you’d have helped build on your legacy, rather than destroy it with such… Shall we say, unfortunate associates. It’s a pity.”
And the family that she protected so sharply and patiently through everything – we haven’t listened! Can you believe that? We were at a point, a few years ago, when she begged Father to flee the country before the already precarious situation would get worse. Father and me both were blind for the future she dreaded. We were fools. It was not even a year later when she asked me to leave with her alone, leave Father behind. At the time, it felt like she wanted to hold me back or didn’t trust my judgement – it felt like she saw a child, not a young man who I wished to be but, in retrospect, was not.
I can’t know what you thought about me that very day, but it doesn’t matter. You came back to save me, and I never had the chance to properly tell you how grateful I am. I wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for you. Thank you.
Last night was magical and I wish you’d grab me and Side-Along us back home. Now that I’ve been there, it feels less brazen to call it my home, too.
I also felt your magic, both while flying and when we kissed. This prickling feeling that is unique to magic alone zinged through me every time we elbowed each other and every time you cut off my way. When our lips met. And it feels so like you: raw and powerful yet so tender. I know that – above all – your magic is a something you need to be (and will be!) in control of. But perhaps it comforts you that there’s a beautiful side to your condition. At least as long as your magic flares because you’re in exuberant spirits, I suppose.
There’s one building, though, that never falls out of view. We’re staying on the West Cliff, and over on the East Cliff there’s the ever-present Whitby Abbey. The centuries-old stone walls tower above everything. It looks truly magical, and I can’t wait to visit the remains of it. It might be one of the places to sense some tingling of former magic, I’ll tell you about it soon.
My love. Your letters paint such a vivid picture. I could imagine your parent’s action and energy, dispensing with the norms of a year abroad and instead hobnobbing with local high society. They must have had very high ambitions for you too, as their only child. Were you being primped and prepared for a career in the Ministry before war broke out? Truth is, I’m not all that sure that I could bear to share you with the rest of the world, not the way that the Minister’s husband is so selflessly supposed to do.
And then your reassuring hands and your questing lips were on my bared forearm. Tears and kisses across the skin and scar, treating this neglected part of me so reverently that I couldn’t bite back the sting I felt in my eyes anymore.
A very early night will be the order of the day, and a lay-in until we’re almost late for school. That’s all I’ve wanted for months, Draco. I don’t know how you managed to swing a night of furlough with Professor McGonagall, but I’m certainly glad you did. That crafty Gryffindor is such a tremendous old brick. What do you think, love: ought we to invite her to our wedding?
I have to admit that I never fancied Longbottom – and yes, now is the time to admit I am not he! – although I do agree that by the time that we entered our latter years he was considerably better looking than he did when he was in his younger years. I don’t know. I think perhaps that he always seemed a little bit earnest for me. From impressions made of him from afar Longbottom always seemed rather fonder of his poisonous plants than he did of other teenagers, be they boys or girls. He always came across as a nice fellow though.
I told them about the raw terror in your voice when you stood, Bellatrix at your side, on the night Dumbledore died. Even then, I knew you were no murderer, Draco. That doesn’t make you weak, not in the slightest. It makes you a better person than your aunt and a better person than Lucius is too. You were lowering your wand when Snape cast the Unforgivable, and I told the Auror that. I insisted you wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore. I knew that you didn’t have it in you.
You will have me too. I want us to have each other. It is to be found out, but I have a feeling that I can enjoy almost any imaginable intimacy with you, Harry, for it’s you I’m making love with. We will spend days on end in the bedroom, finding out about all these titillating delights that we’re talking about. I can’t wait to explore every inch of you. And to read in your face, feel in your tensing muscles, and hear in your moans what you enjoy.
A massive fire roared into life, and it’s good that there’s such profound stonework surrounding the hearth, for several flames whipped way out of the safe enclosure. You quenched the fire with another quick hand movement, looking rather aghast, with a small “oops”leaving your lips.
Theo was quiet for a moment, just looking like he’s got at least a small piece of his peace of mind back – thanks to us, I might add! But you wouldn’t let poor, introverted Theo alone, love. You leant forward on the table, asking ever so shamelessly, “Were you and Pansy a couple, Theo? This clearing in the woods – did you fall in love there?”
This sounds a little lame, but tonight felt like the best of our world. Within that sacred space it didn’t matter which side a person had fought in the war. It didn’t matter whether they were pure-blood or Muggleborn, or how skilled they were with their wand. Everybody was welcome, whatever their family name might have been, and everybody was loved. I don’t know. You’ll call me a Hufflepuff sap when you read this, and rightly so, but you were in my mind every moment I was there.
So I instantly fell back into my usual habits: stayed out of the discussion for the most part, felt my shoulders go stiff, and every movement felt too much. Like I would draw attention to me, whyever that felt so wrong in my head.
You shouldn’t have been quizzed about the Battle of Hogwarts without warning or legal representation. I’m only glad that you’re okay, and that you’re out of harm's way… I love you, and the idea of you being ripped away from me on some trumped-up charges fills me entirely with dread. If these diaries were taken from us, then I wouldn’t know where to find you. You know my low opinions of the Ministry of Magic...
Well, that’s hardly the case with Teddy. Because once Andi took him out his cot after his nap, he was hardly the ever-sleeping babe that he, apparently, had been on Yule. You, my love, were completely overwhelmed, too, weren’t you? Teddy laughed and squealed upon seeing you, half walking, half crawling in your direction when Andi put him down. It didn’t take one second for him to change his feathery blue tufts into a wild mess of thick black hair.
You and I belong together, Draco, and I want to love and explore your pleasure in every way humanly possible, and to know you through every single one of my senses. You were safe, and cared for, and I wanted this to be a wonderful experience for you.
You wouldn’t expect me. But you’d instantly know it’s me when you notice someone coming in. But you wouldn’t know what to think of it when you hear me charm the shower rooms locked. All you would be able to think of is that you’ll be alone with me and that we’ll be so close to each other. That I’d see you, standing there completely naked.
believe this perspective is false, unfair and cruel. Don't Harry and Draco deserve their chance at a happy ending?
Got this blasted Transfiguration essay done today, by the way. After everything, it’s simply laughable the way my anxiety peaks whenever I think about classes and marks. Strong feeling of being too old for this shit again.
“Seamus,” Ron said, talking faster, the words tripping out of his mouth. “You’re never going to be happy until you follow your heart, matey. You’ve pined a whole forest worth of trees over the last few years... Now it’s time to man up and go after the man you want!”
I used to see family as something entirely to do with blood relations. You, my darling, are the one who taught me that that’s nothing but right dragon dung. You have been family for Sirius, Harry. Sirius made you his heir because he loved you.
Alright. Sorry. Listen to me. I'm rambling. You must be wondering what you’ve let yourself in for. I’m not normally this garrulous but, well, I wasn’t expecting your reply.
Perhaps, I blushed or looked funny because she just smiled and offered me one of her biscuits before she dismissed me. I can’t believe this witch sometimes. I think she’s my favourite professor. By far.
First thing you told me on our very romantic and chaste Valentine’s rendezvous: “You had a wank in that bathtub? Cheeky git.”
“Very true,” you answered, taking in the others around the table with your soft grey gaze and squeezing my fingers in your own. “Seven years of the pair of us being stubborn, thick-headed prats.” You raised our entwined fingers to your lips and gave them the lightest kiss. “But this? This is much more fun. Kissing is a far better way to spend our time than fistfights and badly cast hexes.”
I tried to take in as much as possible and my parents dragged me along – hence, those travels proved to be rather exhausting.
As for my hair, it’s dark in colour and it isn't confined to my head, worst luck. I’m rather a hirsute wizard beneath my robes, which I pray doesn’t put you off too badly.
And I preen at your words, that you can’t wait to show me off as your clever, handsome fiancé. I love you so much, Harry, and just now, only minutes after we kissed and you caressed my hair, I’m already craving your touch and the feel of your magic wrapping around me like a warm embrace.
That chap was the best DADA teacher we had in our seven years, but that didn’t stop the nasty Howlers arriving as soon as his secret became public.
I might not be the best (or even average) at Divination, but for once I seem to have made an accurate prediction. Andromeda has written back, and her owl arrived during lessons this afternoon. The Elves were kind enough to leave the message on my bed – they do give me preferential treatment, don’t they? – and she seems pleased about the idea of us visiting at Easter. Merlin, but I’m thrilled.
“And it seems we’ve the honour of Mr Potter too,” the Auror said, his eyes raking over me. “Our esteemed Saviour, fresh from flashing his adolescent pash at the Minister’s table. Are you enjoying your Order of Merlin, Mr Potter? Enjoying all of your headlines?” I didn’t reply. I didn’t trust that I wouldn’t swear, or else put you in some danger. My magic fizzed and danced in my head, and I felt the ends of my fingers burn with it.
Apparently, there was something going on between your wand and You-Know-Who’s, for Father had to pass his wand onto him. It was even worse from then on. Most of the things I had to go through were not about me. I’m no one. They were to humiliate Father. To show him quite plainly what a sissy he had raised for a son. I turned into the biggest joke. In my own home. It was meant to be humiliating, of course I knew that. He had a way of knowing what the ultimate disgrace for you would be. It was a nightmare come true in so many different ways.
I’m sitting here in the stands, watching the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and people must think I’m bonkers. I have a smile as wide as the Black Lake at the idea that Ron will ever stop calling you a fancy git. Those words are practically sewn into his DNA. Think of it as a nickname, if you will. A friendly compliment.
Bloody hell, Draco. This is all such an awful mess, but I’m here. I’m not leaving you, Draco. I'm sorry I've rambled, but I'm just livid. I'm a little better now though. My magic doesn't feel as wild.
The sky was ice and the wood of my broom was slick as we chased and tested each other’s limits. It was a heart-racing, blood-pounding, adrenalin-rush of a duel and you pushed me further and harder than any time since the war, swooping high into the air and then diving so low that our knees nearly brushed the settling snow.
Again, I’m not saying this in the sense of the fucking papers or all those starry-eyed sycophants of his. Potter both ruined and saved my family. I wish I could get into detail about this… I will someday, I promise. And I’m sure you’ll understand why I wouldn’t want anyone to downplay his deeds. But I have several reasons why I’m really glad that it was Potter and not someone else who was the Chosen One. Imagine we’d been at, let’s say, Zacharias Smith’s mercy. What would this future have looked like?
Sorry, I’m rambling! I can't seem to help myself. I’m already keyed up about our non-Ball tonight. I’ve got so much that I want to talk to you about. Do write back to me before then though, if you get a chance, even if it’s just a few lines.
As requested, you wanted to hear the poems I read and enjoyed from your present. I’ll confess, I did have it locked in my truck for a couple of days before I left it in the Library. I flicked through its pages a couple (several!) times.
But Merlin, we haven't been out for some flying for far too long. We were grinning at each other, weren't we, when we kicked off into the twilight. "Are we going somewhere special?" you asked, ever-so-playfully swirling around, looking so young and carefree. Circe, but I would have loved to see you in your old Quidditch uniform and with your leathers on just then. The only thing tainting the delicious sight was the school broom that hardly matches your prowess as a flyer, but of course it didn't matter a Sickle.
And being the gentleman that you are, you also collected my essays for Transfiguration and DADA yesterday, only to deliver them to our professors. You see, you save me so much time because you know how much I’m struggling with Runes and Arithmancy at the moment, but the dilemma of it all… The saved time, I spend it daydreaming about you and your chivalry.
And also, I will always be there. If you let me, I shall learn with you, at least the theory, and we will discuss Neurobiology and whatnot until we both get it into our pretty, clever heads. We will drink too much tea and coffee, pulling numerous all-nighters if necessary, and you will be brilliant at it, love. You’ve been doing so well in Potions lately that it’s honestly just luck that will decide your N.E.W.T. Imagine you get something like Veritaserum, Felix or Amortentia in the exam, or even Polyjuice. You know all about them, love. It’s just the calming (sometimes deadly calming) potions that you struggle with. But you’ll get the hang of it. I shall chat about them nonstop until you dream about the theory behind Dreamless Sleep and Draught of Living Death.
“So am I,” you answered. “This- Harry, it’s all I’ve ever wanted. Maybe that’s part of why I was so wistful when I wrote in our diary earlier - you've your same friends, you're revising in your usual common room – this is life as you know it, a world of support that you’re used to. But for me? Love, I’m still on probation. Still struggling under the Ministry’s whims. This,” you said, propping yourself up on an elbow and gesticulating between us, “this love between us is all so new, and I suppose some small part of me is waiting to wake up. Waiting for the broomstick to be pulled from beneath me.”
I also want to thank you for being so supportive yesterday about the thing with Theo. And you listened to that gruesome memory of mine. But Merlin, it was one of the worst Summonings we had. I’m sorry that I didn’t manage to speak full sentences, perhaps only half of it made sense. But the way this giant snake started her feast. I’m still so thankful that He used the Killing Curse before… And she was Petrified. Only her eyes moved in terror when she woke up. Harry, I know that’s not related at all. But in my mind’s eye, every time I see Burbage’s eyes flashing over me, I see your eyes looking up to me. Beginning of sixth year in the Hogwarts Express when I broke your nose. But then there’s the snake again, and…
Let’s talk about our endless love as well as our two love-birds, and Occlumency over dinner. We could find a classroom or go up to the RofR after we’ve eaten. I think I should be able to cast Legilimens. And don’t fret, my darling. I shall be very gentle and nothing like the brute teachers either of us had. I won’t look at anything you wouldn’t want to show me. I promise.
We’ll do this exactly like the Mind Healers want. Make this our safe space. I’ll listen to your shit and you’ve got to listen to mine. No criticism, no piss taking and no nagging. I can do that. You’ll be the first non-judgemental pal that I’ve had in a long time.
“It’s different with you, Glyn,” Mother said, avoiding everyone’s eyes. It was most intriguing, Harry, love. It’s so interesting to not only hear your parents’ well-selected pictures they have of themselves but also to hear a genuine friend’s view on them.
There are some things I’d perhaps like to talk about but. Well, BUT the catch of this whole anonymous diary thing is that we can say personal things, but we can’t say anything personal, right?
I don’t think that’s the truth: he isn’t. I think the same as you. I don’t think he should be feted and followed. I reckon the very best thanks that we could give Harry would be to give him some space and let him live his life. Let him be happy. Let him fall in love with the wizard of his dreams.
“You’re a crap actor, Harry,” he said, rounding on me. “A fine wizard, but a crap actor. I’ll no sooner vomit up my innards than sprout wings and fly away! What’s the craic, Harry?”
Had to get my attention back to my class after that, unfortunately. I was I was so happy when I opened the diary again later and saw just how many more words were added. Remember the time when you apologised for writing on my page?
I’m only glad that nobody was looking in my direction. They’d have seen my red cheeks and the strangled look on my features, and they’d have known straight away exactly the images that were filling my brain. You, my love, were quite the distraction. It was no wonder I stumbled over my answer. Indeed, Slughorn looked rather disappointed with me. The rest of Friday was slower than a broken Cleansweep. By the time I got out my father’s invisibility cloak I was hot, bothered and fidgety. I was exactly as you wanted me to be.
But anyway, back to that lovely chat with the neighbours. One of them looked me dead in the eye, saying, “So, you must be the man in this relationship then, eh?”
You never went about writing your diary entries the wrong way. If I’m being really honest, and I want to be, then I think that I might not have been able to carry on writing, had you told me your secret earlier in our relationship. My extreme reaction to your candour is a good indication of how I might have reacted. So, I think you were right. It is tricky, sometimes, to decide what to hold back and what to say. Whether by withholding, you’re not being true to yourself and, consequently, to each other.
Yes, those extra couple of inches of hair do give you quite a dashing appearance and running my fingers though it feels wonderful. I think I can imagine you with longer hair, the silk of it curling around your shoulders.
It’s too late to talk much but I couldn’t resist writing to you, even if only a few words, you little sap. Who’s the Hufflepuff now, Harry Potter? Don’t fret, I’m a bit reticent only because I’m absolutely exhausted. Tomorrow I’ll write you an epic, promise. First thing in the morning.
Well, Draco, if looks could kill, I’d be dead (and that’s a Muggle phrase, love, entirely unrelated to anything else that might have happened in the recent past).
Well, you said that it helps to focus elsewhere whenever you’re waking up from nightmares. So, let’s make a deal. You listen to my shit, and I listen to yours. No laughing, no nagging when one of us says he doesn’t want to elaborate on anything.
headlines enough in my short years on the earth, and I don’t want to share any more of my special days with strangers and gawkers.
“You’re underselling,” I told him in earnest. “Just like you can’t believe that such a witty, sumptuous witch might fancy you, she’s probably surprised to find an egghead like you has feelings for her that exceed a kiss or whatever you shared, given that it’s been quite a few months now since you’ve seen one another.” I dared to inquire about the words Pansy mentioned in that moment: “What was it anyway that happened in the woods? Did you tell her you love her? Propose?”
I felt such fondness at your question, and your childish naivete. “Start by putting on the oven,” I replied. “Back at the Dursleys we had electricity, but this place is far too magical for such trifles. Give it a tap with your wand and say
Nobody in the Hall said a word, and when I looked around nobody would meet my eye. Where are you, Draco?
This is what I do when I don’t have anything that I particularly feel like sharing: I tell them a fib. I imagine that you’re wincing! That is, I would be if I had any idea what you looked like, which I genuinely do not.
Draco. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and how you’d been threatened. How dare that officious, horrible man stand there and threaten you with imprisonment. How dare he make such allegations?
It’s tricky, isn’t it? I don’t know what it’s like in your peer group, but lots of my mates have paired off into couples and suddenly seem to have a lot more physical experience than I have. I don’t want to be the solitary, sole virgin left in our year group but equally it doesn’t seem right to sleep with a person simply to have it over and done with. I know it's an old cliché to say I want something special, but I do. I want my first time to be with the right person.
Wow, I filled page after page. I hope that me being so wordy doesn’t change how you feel about me. But honestly? I come to think that you might like to read all of this. I don’t know where this confidence comes from, but I like to think that you are happy when you check out how much more of my words you’ll find.
There was a little flush on your cheekbones as you so methodically ate your dinner (you really do have the most refined table manners) and although you were most definitely not up for a lively chat, I do wonder whether that extraordinarily slight graze of our forearms was accidental?
We took our tea in the lounge, Glynis gave us some space after saying hello, and I had to stifle a grin upon seeing your unbelieving looks when we started talking. “Splendid weather we have–did you have a chance to enjoy it during your holidays?” Mother asked, and I talked about the Islington Arboretum, playing the ball to you by asking about the statues we saw and the birds in the Aviary. We talked about books, and music, and I also mentioned the champagne we had, to which Mother told us a bit about Great-Uncle Orion’s predilection for wine and champagne, which Walburga continued the few years she outlived her husband.
Love, I had no idea that you could be so perfectly self-controlled. You kept fucking me at such a light pace without ever stopping, giving me time to adjust to you. Having a cock inside you is something entirely else than taking two or three fingers, isn’t it? And I think I mentioned it before, but your prick is so perfectly thick.
Those lingering stokes of yours must have been a slow, delicious torture. However, did you manage not to make any noise? You must have bitten your hand or buried your head in the pillow as that addictive, ticklish pleasure started to spread out from the head of your prick. I’ll bet that you made the tiniest gasp when you eventually came, wetting your hand and your pyjamas both with hot, sticky come. You wouldn’t have risked a
I have to admit, my hand was itching with the need to cast some manner of speed hex (if such a thing exists? If not, it ought to!) over my dorm mates. The amount of headache-inducingly dreadful aftershave and hair perfecting spells that I’ve been subjected to this evening were enough to have put me on my back even if I hadn’t been faking an illness.
The careless exile that this precious book had to endure could certainly be due to the fact that it might have been unseen by our dear Walburga. I have no idea whether she had witnessed death first-hand or not, but the book, much like its spectral subject, is unseeable to those who are not familiar with our great equaliser in one or the other way. Pas de problème for you and I of course: whilst death is a distant acquaintance of mine, rumour has it that you became their master.
Try not to leave it until the last bloody minute next time. You’re not the only one who needs to keep a low profile this year.
As for now, I will take all of the two-hours I have to reminisce about my childhood and share it with you. I’ll try to focus on pre-Hogwarts.
It’s a bit like flying. Harry, as soon as your teasing saunter emerged into a jog, I needed to follow and catch up. It’s always been this way with you. And in that moment my feet started to take off after you, a grin splitting across my face, I truly wondered whether I have always been in love with you and just didn’t know any better.
P.S. Yes, you did see correctly. I nodded right at your stifled grin in the Great Hall this morning. Perhaps I would have even greeted you verbally but yelling across the entire hall felt slightly uncalled-for.
Edward’s (that is his name) own Father is dead – died during the Battle of Hogwarts – but when I was younger the pair of us were very close, and for a while he was a close confidante and was a person that I felt I could trust in during a very difficult, very topsy-turvy year.
Because it would’ve been easier for me, just like you very rightly said. It would have been so easy to blame unrequited feelings or the idea that it just shouldn’t be. When you stopped staring at me, I thought I might have found a spot that hurt just enough.
Get off your robes and loosen your tie. Shove your trousers down and your pants, too. I want you to lie down on your bed and get comfortable – don’t put your wand too far away though.
The next awkward thing was when you proudly showed them your ring – Andi couldn’t stop commenting on it, emphasising how glad she was that it had been part of Cissy’s dowry so that it could be passed on to you. The thought is cute, somehow. It wouldn’t surprise me if there’d been a time when she would have pretty much liked that ring to adorn her own finger. But she looked so fondly between you and I after she had inspected it carefully, commenting on the arcane runes and the goblin-wrought silver.
Darling, I know you’re worried – I am too – but nighttime thoughts always seem bigger and more vivid than those in the daylight.
then. She said that to her, most of their articles defy all logic, and I think that’s the sweetest and most innocent thing to say. Sometimes I can’t tell whether Luna really has trouble telling cynicism and ill will from objective reporting, but it doesn’t even matter. Circe, I love her.
Oh, this reminds me of something. It’s half funny and half-sad, so be prepared. You set Dobby free on one of the last days of our second year. You know me, if it’s not for a sneer, I hardly ever lose my composure. But when I came home for summer break and heard about this incident, I must’ve looked funny at Father. Spent two weeks locked in my room for that.
I stood, and I pulled Smythe to his feet. Perhaps I was a little rough when I grabbed his shoulder and pulled his face only inches away from mine. “You’d be wise,” I explained, “not to suggest that I’m being cheated or misled.” I balled up the shoulder of his shirt in my fist and pulled him even closer. “Will that be a problem?” I asked, letting him deduce his own meaning from my words.
Life, as the Muggles say, is too short to do otherwise. So, tell me more, my intrepid sightseer. What are the top three places that I ought to see before I’m old and grey, with a beard as long as Dumbledore’s?
You kissed me, warm wet lips on my jaw. “Much more than quite okay. Showers were Muggle, but elves soaping up your back with a sponge was encouraged. Father used to say that they liked it, that it reminded them who the boss was. Merlin, but even when I was a child, Father could be a colossal arse.”
But anyhow. Our conversation soon enough came back to our beloved Pansy, and I told him about the rest of the letter, and how she said that life at the Amalfi coast was rather enjoyable, if only perhaps a bit lonely without friends.
I was sitting at my house table, shoving some brussels sprouts around my plate, and watched a pair of fifth or sixth years nearby. They were holding hands under the table, whispering about a party in some abandoned classroom.
Fuck, but we have both been through some dire shit. I assume you’re right on the wand about me shielding away memories and thoughts most of the time. Back in summer last year, when I was in custody, there was literally nothing to divert my thoughts. I was confined within a windowless room with nothing but my fears and memories. At times, I wondered how much worse Azkaban could really be even though I’m not oblivious to the fact that it must indeed be worse.
Before we had to part, I also told you that I’d love to spend Easter with you at Grimmauld. At home. I tell you, Potter, we won’t leave the bed. Except, perhaps, for the visit you suggested. Thanks for giving me some time to think about it. When Easter approaches, I’d definitely feel very comfortable, would you ask Andromeda before you stumble over her grate with the nephew in tow that she’s seen only once or twice and who probably had nothing but a cool stare for her, his nose certainly every bit as high up in the air as his mother.
I can’t believe how much these elves love you. Thought you were taking the piss when you said that they will have a fight over who gets to wait on us, but that proved to be true. And they did listen to your plea to cook posh food and get a formal table setup just for the two of us. And considering that there was Treacle Tart for pudding, I assume they know you rather well.
On the matter of sleeping: watching me sleeping isn’t creepy in my opinion. Even though, should I ever notice, I will obviously call you a kinky git. But actually, I think it’s adorable. Also, I feel very safe sleeping next to you.
You, however, aren’t in a position to be hobnobbing with Ministry officials. You’re trapped under a series of punitive probation rules which forbid you from even entering parts of the bloody library, let alone actually being able to leave the sodding castle! Lucius had a big vault full of Galleons, whereas you – and your mum – have been left homeless, friendless, and destitute. Your comparison doesn’t hold weight, Draco, because, quite bluntly, what would be the point of me making an alliance with a Malfoy?
And you told me about the first time you’ve ever been there. You whispered the story to me while we were walking down the cobble street that leads to the church and the graveyard. Every time we talk about things that happened during the war, I can’t quite fathom that we’re alive.
And you also showed me a few snippets of a letter you have from your mum, and photos of your parents, the old Order of Phoenix, and also several photos of baby Harry with the same green eyes, same wild hair. Sweetheart, if I was a bit quiet, it was because I couldn’t get enough of the sight of young you.
Some time ago, I told you that my heart sometimes starts racing because of the most ridiculous things. The Healer said that it’s too early to tell from just one session but that it sounds like I panic when I’m afraid to lose control over a situation. Sounds about right to me, even though I’ve never seen it from that perspective.
Sometimes I reread our earlier talk – the sexy ones as well. And I get what you mean. Writing something explicit now feels much different to writing anonymously, doesn’t it? And I don’t feel objectified or anything of that sort when you tell me in your beautiful words that you're thinking of my flesh-and-blood self while wanking. I’m fantasising about you too, Harry. You have no idea what your eyes and your smile and this bird’s nest for hair do to me. You are so handsome.
We would be the joke of the universe. YOU would be the joke of the universe. Letting yourself be lured in by a Death Eater. By a Malfoy. That’s what Malfoys do, don’t you know? Righting their reputation by forming alliances with the right sort. That’s what Father did after the First War: feigning remorse and innocence, meddling with Ministry officials mere weeks after his pardon. Don’t you think shagging the Saviour would come in rather useful for me?
Sweet Salazar, you said that with so much appreciation and relief. I’m sorry that I scoffed, I really am. You looked a bit hurt. I didn’t mean to mock you or anything, but I feel like I must protect you from all your bonhomie.
You, collecting my breakfast in the morning, and buttering my toast in that fancy way you have. The way that you straighten my collar when it’s skew-whiff, and I’ve been too frazzled to notice. I even enjoy the notes that you’ve magicked into my textbooks, reminding me which bits of the page are likely to be on the exam. Part of me still can’t accept that a brainy, cultured chap like you is prepared to put up with me. So yes. I love you, very much.
To be frank, this whole week has been a torrent of homework, revision classes (and that’s without having to re-do my sodding Potions practical) and I cannot wait to scream myself silly and just be a teenager for a couple of hours. I’ve already gotten myself a cauldron-sized bag of sweets to keep me company, and I intend to consume the lot. I swear to the deities above that our teachers compete against each other to see who can dole out the most sides of parchment. Don’t they understand that I have a boyfriend to write to?
We must repeat this. Regularly. I can hardly care too much about curfew – being eighteen years old and having a curfew feels ridiculous anyway. As does having to sleep down here instead of sneaking into your bed.
I can tell you exactly why Malfoy is back at Hogwarts, though frankly I’m surprised you don’t already know. It was all over the
But before I forget about it, let me get back to organisational matters real quick. Sorry. Circe, but I need five minutes, I’ll be right back.
For someone who was so worried about mixing up the cutlery, you did quite a decent job on choosing your utensils. The outside-in rule is simple enough, isn’t it? As long as you won’t try to eat your soup with your salad fork, you’ll be fine. But please don’t let me see you use the bread plate as a holder for your used cutlery ever again. The only reason this particular plate exists is so that your bread won’t get soaked with gravy. Don’t put dirty forks on it for Merlin’s sake.
But anyway. We all had double Potions together and after the lesson, you and Hermione took off to prepare DADA tutoring, leaving Ron and me behind. The poor bloke looked a little lost there, tucking his utensils away with a miserable frown on his face.
I thought for a moment, keeping your words in mind. I thought about what I usually appreciate in the way you talk to me, darling. “First of all, you ought to tell her that you are indeed happy for her. She knows that, I’m sure of it, but it’s just a nice feeling to hear it, especially from someone you love. But you also ought to mention your fears. When you tell her that you will awfully miss her, also mention that you support her, no matter what. Don’t make it sound like it’s her fault. Tell her that you, too, need reassurances, perhaps not with praise or freedom, but – I don’t know – with a surprise date or something.”
Merlin, listen to us! Making plans for a ceremony that will hardly take place while we still haven’t finished our N.E.W.T.s. I haven’t mentioned it before, but I felt really flattered that you thought about my probation in one breath with our idea to bond. May sound unromantic to some; to me it sounds very rational and practical. I love that side of you just as much as the sentimental Sturm and Drang poet that you are.
While chatting away, we rounded the lake in no time. We were already back on the way to the castle when you said, “I have never regretted talking to them,” and I instantly knew that you meant the Mind Healer. “It has always helped me one way or the other.”
You were there, waiting, and when I tickled that soft spot of skin on your jaw you smiled so delectably that I felt my pulse race.
Nobody, Harry, absolutely nobody is mentally carefree like that. She had to find a way to cope with all that – with seeing me again. She approached me with a request for friendship, probably just to make sure I wouldn’t stab her in the back. To get on my good side, so she wouldn’t ever have to relive anything like her imprisonment again. She must be fucking afraid of me, but her head is too corked up to know better.
Do you remember those secret whispered rumours of an enchanted mirror hidden within these very walls of this castle? One that would show you the most desperate desire of a person’s heart? Were we to look in its reflective pane today I think that we would see each other reflected back, exactly as we are. Not more handsome, not more accomplished, not kinder, but simply the flawed people the rest of the world has made us.
I love you. Please think of me when you’re watching the Druid rituals. You never leave my mind for longer than a breath.
As for our date: please, Harry, bring nothing but your fabulous self and what else I’ve told you. And your Invisibility Cloak, perhaps! I’m not sure how long we’ll be out. And it will be easier to get back into the castle without booking a week’s worth of detention for us.
My skin is tingling, and my heart feels like it’s going to jump out of my throat. I’ve never… I’ve never felt anything like that orgasm. It was like pleasure washed over me, like I was slipping into a deep bath.
Yet I’m thankful for having the ‘miasma of contentment’ which you described so beautifully. We both need it. We both need a piece of a normal, unthreatening life, even if that sometimes means pretending there weren’t dreadful memories or ominous fears for the future looming at the back of our heads.
I’ve literally just read your conversation with Dean, and crikey. If I hadn’t fallen for you already, I’d be swooning into your arms. Actually, I still might. We’ll wait till after our date, and then you can ravish me with your words and your hands and anything else that you might care to use. Your advice to Dean was spot on, and I suppose that it’s up to them to catch the Snitch now. Bloody hell, I hope they can be brave and get on with things. They’re both Gryffindors, so they jolly well ought to be.
“That’s sweet, but Harry and I had plans,” I said. I felt like repeating myself even though the topics were unrelated, but I simultaneously felt guilty for crushing this vision she had, if that makes any sense.
I feel awful, as low as a worm about before and my heart is hurting with the idea that you are in pain. This isn’t my Saviour Complex talking, Draco. This is me speaking, your boyfriend. I’m begging you not to let one bad experience and a couple of thick headed idiots pull you back behind those walls that you build so quickly.
The thing is, she was quite a Dark witch. From what is known about her, she used potions to kill her husbands, and she also conjured ghastly creatures. My Grandfather Abraxas once told me that the Muggles thought that Alice Kyteler would summon demons at crossroads – you know, demons like they are described in some of the scriptures in Muggle religion? I think it’s a thing. In reality (at least as per my Grandfather), she was practising earth magic, but the dark kind. She used the remains of her late husbands to summon their apparition. Now, Harry darling, guess what a witch might want from the husbands that she had offed before? Exactly. Intercourse. With all three or four of them at once.
She refused to give it back to me until she had translated some of the runes that were carved into the goblin-wrought silver. I’ll confess, I don’t know the first thing about deciphering runes. Was that a subject that you opted for? In any case, my friend decoded something curious. Something about purity conquering, or a message along those lines? I thought I’d mention it to you in case it held some significance. I’m overawed by the gift, love. I’m enchanted. Thank you.
First, let me talk about the Ministry very briefly. Reading your words made my heart swell. Please don’t think me cruel, I didn’t mean to horrify you and I realised only after your words how dependent we are on our diaries. But I felt very flattered by your protectiveness. You take so much better care of me than I take care of myself, love. I have hardly thought about it – in my defence, yesterday was a stressful day – but you’re right of course. What the Auror did, it wasn’t right and perhaps not even lawful. And they took advantage of the predicament I’m in. I had no choice but to answer their questions.
I haven’t, in the eight years that I’ve known you, and talked to you, and argued with you, ever asked for a single thing, but today I’m asking for that simple courtesy. Call me by my name.
You laughed at that. “It was a bit of a shock,” you admitted, each tiny movement sending little ripples across the surface of the water. “But actually, I’ll let you a secret, Harry Potter, dear fiancé of mine. The elves, back when I was little, had a terrible tendency to suddenly appear, with a click of the sodding fingers and then be stood there in the bathroom. They’d want to pass the soap, or hand me my towel, any other such humble requests, and – as you can imagine – I was rather growing out of that by the time my eleventh year began.” You grinned. “I’d learnt a few anti-Apparition charms by the time the next set of holidays began, and so I set them whenever I bathed."
Mother and Edward’s grandmother would get along splendidly, for Mother, too, chose the words ‘make you an honest man’ when we were talking about you and me again. She wanted to know – I suppose my mention of a committed relationship rather than a love affair sounded quite fixed for her – not if but when we’d bond and whether you had money to rely on.
I’ll gather some strength for the upcoming week of exams. And once we’re through with them, we’re ready to go home and have that appointment with Mulvaney at the Wizengamot.
From what you told me, your childhood was completely dreadful. Mine wasn’t, not really, but I can relate to the feeling of being in a cage, only that mine was golden. Remember the memory I showed you via Occlumency the other day, the relief and happiness I felt after tutoring was over? Well, another reason I was so relieved and free was the simple fact that I had arranged with Mother and Father to spend Friday afternoons without any responsibilities.
Gods but I wanted to. I was ready, so ready and I marvelled at how easily I opened for you. Your slicked up fingers quested inside of me and my body didn’t resist them at all. It was a hot, sweet perfect glide and I felt myself adjust to the delicious stretch. The blood raced through my veins and my breath trembled, and then I was lost.
Oh, love. You were my shining, perfect angel, and I’ll never forget how overjoyed you looked when I pulled you into my embrace. Draco, I don’t doubt that Narcissa will have seen every piece of your happiness too. It radiated from you, just exactly like magic. Love, you were the furthest person in the world from an ‘undignified simpleton.’
Sorry, I’m kind of reading your letter back and forth and shouting my thoughts at you. I hope you don’t mind, should I start to sound a little tiddly.
Of course, most importantly, Andromeda was only too happy to let us have the reception at her home. I reckon it’ll be perfect. Small and intimate, with all the people that we love surrounding us. Your Mother, and Glynis too. Luna, and her dad of course. What do you think, shall we let them have the smallest of exclusives for
So, you’re absolutely right, I’m an only child. I think I mentioned my lonely days in my family home at some point in our diary, love. But I can’t blame you for forgetting one thing or the other. It’s quite amazing how much we have already written.
I can’t wait to meet Teddy and Andromeda. Sure, I’m still nervous, but she sounded so open and welcoming in her letter. I’m so glad that Mother gave you the ring, both for your magic and simply for the fact that Andromeda seems so fond of the symbolic meaning of it. I, too, love to see it on your hand. And I like it best when your fingers are curled around the quill too.
After a few minutes of reading this fawning rubbish, Braithwaite came to fetch me, and the two of us made our way to his office. You’ll be glad to know that my blood pressure is good, my reactions are fine, and physically, I’m as healthy as a hippogriff. There’s the good news. As for my magic, Braithwaite was a lot less delighted.
Looking down at my body I can see the rise and fall of my skinny chest and the steady thrum of my pulse is loud in my ears. The first thing that I do is ghost my fingers over my nipples and across the thatch of black hair between them, as lightly as I possibly can.
We can even sit together at the Quidditch. Our knees definitely won’t touch and our fingers won’t brush. The pair of us will be courteous ex-rivals, and when people gossip – because they will – I’m sure they’ll just laugh at Harry Potter’s stupidly big, stupidly generous heart.
It hasn’t felt like that. I know this sounds fanciful, Draco, but if anything, making love with you felt like an intake of breath. It felt like casting a Patronus or like kicking away the ground and launching into the air. It was completion, love. I was finally whole.
First, you’re absolutely right. It isn’t your place nor the place of any other person to tell me who I like, who I fall in love with and what my feelings are. My years on the earth have been marked by others deciding what my destiny should be, and ought to be. When I was a child, it was the Dursleys – that's the family name of my uncle and aunt – the ones who denied me my magical heritage and, would you believe, made me believe my parents had died in a Muggle car accident.
Draco, your mother simply adores you, and I couldn’t ever not love a person that feels like that about you. After all, you do happen to be the love of my life.
Okay, maybe we might argue that dear Grandfather Abraxas was a bit crude and morbid in his old days. Perhaps we might even say that the details of the story are not meant for the curious ears of a nine-or-so-year-old boy. But Hecate, did I listen eagerly. Father overheard one of the last bits, though, and with that my Grandfather was up for a good and proper chastisement by his own son. I think it was one of the only times Father raised his voice against him.
We both better sleep soon, mon ange. I still relish the taste of dessert wine mixed with your sweet kisses on my tongue. And my thoughts are not only spinning around tonight, but also yesterday. The feel of your taut body under my hands, the sight of the bulge in your trousers. Oh Circe, how I wanted to see you. Everything of you. I couldn’t resist experimentally moving my hips against you. I’m glad you didn’t think it was too much.
Before we parted, Mother excused herself for a minute, rushing off to her quarters. She came back with some fabric that she handed over to you without meeting either of our quizzical gazes. The deep blue fabric is soft and sleek – it might be Diffindo’ed from a dress? Or another blanket? Let’s hope she was right when she said that Andromeda would recognise it, for Mother didn’t explain too much. “A gift,” she said. “It’s belated, but it is for the child’s quilt. I dare hope that my sister did craft a magical quilt for young Edward.”
I do know one thing for certain: one thing that I can swear to Merlin is the absolute truth. Your Mother loves you. You are the sun, the moon and the stars in the centre of her universe and, in all honesty, I don’t think that she’d ever leave you willingly.
They have called me names before, and they roughed me up before. It’s nothing new, really. Bastard Ravenclaws that they are, they usually tend to heal me afterwards, should anything leave a mark. I know that I haven’t mentioned this before. Mainly, because I was scared when we were still writing anonymously that I would give away who I was. But also because you can count the occasions that this happened on one hand.
Okay. No more romance talk. I'm getting every bit as bad as those fan-girls that follow me around the school, sending me pages of parchment covered in doodles of hearts and cupids firing their tiny bows. Although, of course, it goes without saying that if you'd like a love heart, I’d send a dozen paper birds flying in your direction.
And, you know what else? You have the most gorgeous thighs! I know, I told you repeatedly yesterday, but it doesn’t make it less true. It is a fact that bears repeating.
“Well, looks like I’m going to have to summon that for my practical DADA exam. Perhaps I’d need you there with me too.”
Now, Ron’s mother was suspicious of that stuff and seemingly didn’t trust Hermione’s knowledgeability. Hermione only wondered what made her do it in the end.
Also, it was the third time this week that we bought flowers in this little flower shop at the corner. I think the shopkeeper starts to take to us. I saw him add a few extra flowers to the beautiful bouquet he bound. It was a thing of beauty, love. The delicate magnolia branchlets coming out of this lavish array of narcissi and these green and yellow little leaves and grasses.
I love you, Draco. I love you today, and I’ll love you tomorrow. I'll love you forever. Of all the ways my life could have played out, this is the only existence I could possibly want.
So, in fact, I couldn’t have told you half as much about these places compared to the ones in my top three – not more than you’d read in a tour guide anyway. And I got the feeling that you asked for my personal top three.
I loved the way that you pushed into me, filling me. I loved the little noises that you made as you began to move and found your rhythm. We were clumsy, and we were frantic, but I couldn’t have imagined better. I got lost in you, Draco Malfoy. I got lost in our lovemaking, and I could no longer tell where you began, and I ended.
Bracing myself for the next part with some Firewhisky really quick. Feel free to tell me what you think. And do tell me whether it’d be awkward to continue. Cause now comes the blowjob.
What I’m trying to say is: Let’s just fucking hold hands and kiss whenever we feel like it. Enough hiding. I have enough from tiptoeing about the castle with my head down. Being with you feels right and so overwhelming that I don’t want to miss a second with you.
I thought about this whole diary thing again after reading your reply. This is really NOT meant to be an excuse. But I’m sure there are things you need to hold back from me as well, aren’t there?
I knelt before the Dark Lord, just like my father once has, and took it, trying hard not to make a sound and not to wince while the tip of his wand burnt into my skin like Fiendfyre.
Oh, my love, this is what I want forever: you and I with each other, experiencing the passing of seasons and years, knowing that whatever else is changing in the rest of our lives, our love remains constant and unchanged, the foundations that we build our lives upon.
Well. Sleep won’t find me if I keep writing, isn’t that right? Thank Hecate for the bliss of Dreamless Sleep Potions.
When you retreated from my mind, you buried your face in your hands, sending your glasses askew, and you held your breath. I felt oddly calm, remembering a few other things that happened back on that August day over two years ago, while I ran my hands up your back into your hair and back down.
Oh darling, I think I had under-egged the pudding a little bit when I described the state of the place. I’d only been down there once before today, and I’d forgotten what a deathtrap the basement is.
I don’t know what your dad did in the war – and it isn’t my place to ask – but I do know that you should have been his priority. Your health and future happiness ought to have been his everything and-
So you told me to roll my shoulders and to loosen my set jaw, my stiff back. It actually felt a bit like those funny exercises we do before running which should positively be implemented in Quidditch training – or did you learn that in your team?
On the other side of the cauldron, if everything goes as well as I desperately believe it will, then I suspect we’ll struggle to be parted. I don’t want your mind to be wandering when you’re having the reunion you’ve wanted for months. I imagine that you, and your mum will both have a lot you need to discuss, and I want you focused. If you wanted to tell her about me, I wouldn’t be averse. I’d be honoured.
But fuck, this was so awkward for a moment just then. I realised what I was about to do and that I’ve never done it before. I couldn’t be a complete hundred percent sure that Blaise really wanted this in the first place. And my hands already started fumbling with his belt.
We continued to chat a little longer, all about the OM and the ceremony. “Are you worried about there being a backlash to you coming out?” Luna asked for her final question. “It’s still very unusual in the wizarding world.”
Who’d have thought that having a Slytherin for a chum was what my life was lacking. How, exactly, do you know so much gossip about the staff? I need to know everything, Draco. Every bit of scandal I missed while I was busy saving the world. Do you know, I was nearly sorted into Slytherin? I only got Gryffindor by the skin of my teeth.
I’ll present you with this week's issue of Witch Weekly tomorrow. There’s a spread about one certain wizard that happens to be the Saviour’s fiancé. And apparently his dark past holds an exceptional mystique, and he has eyes like a rainstorm and his aristocratically pale skin and blond hair might even challenge a Veela’s appearance. No wonder your all-round besotted with me! It reads like I’m a model.
I’m not even surprised that the girls are obsessed with us. Just look at us. We’re a gay version of a Shakespearean couple, overcoming all odds to be with each other for their love is pure, unconditional, and eternal. Perhaps we can leave out the part in which the characters are usually dying – we’ve been close enough to that, so maybe Shakespeare would approve of us anyway.
Without breaking the kiss, I climbed into your lap, feeling your calloused hands sneak below my shirt. “Let me get us out of these clothes,” I told you, searching the settee for my wand. I will tell you now that I have actively been practising that spell, no matter how crafty my smirk was yesterday.
As I watched you diving your fork into the mille-feuille, you said something funny. “Draco, if we weren’t betrothed already, I’d ask you here and now.” It was funny because I thought the exact same thing.
But first, let me tell you how good it was to see you this morning, delighted as you were. “You’re so smart. And always thinking so practical,” you said between kisses, sneaking your arms beneath my outer robes and pulling me close. But Circe, what I said about you being a cute dolt? You did prove me right on that.
Sorry. I’m being one of those overprotective Hufflepuffs that you reckoned “my lot” are in your last letter. I don’t know. I'm poking my nose in. I’ve never heard you sound as despondent as that before though. I suppose it worried me a little.
Think of it in terms of a Shield Charm. You’ve cleverly inhibited such thoughts from entering your brain because rationally, what can you actually do about them? You've done what you needed to do to look after yourself in a hostile, difficult existence.
Spending my time cuddled close to your side, our legs all tangled while you read your book was the perfect activity for me. I didn’t understand it though, the few paragraphs that I managed to follow.
I’m currently sitting in my common room close to the fireplace, wishing I had you here with me. Perhaps in my lap, just like yesterday. I miss your comfortable weight and the scent of your lovely hair.
Will you meet me? We could go up to the Astronomy Tower. You could bring your telescope and be the clever bloke that I know you are. You could show me where the Aquila constellation – we were supposed to find that last lesson, the one I ditched – and you wouldn’t have to talk if you wanted.
My hands aren’t smooth like I imagine yours might be. They’re rough – coarse from riding my broom and cracked from not using protective spells in potions lessons – and so I’m just using the pads of my fingers. My skin shivers and goosebumps wherever I explore, and I give my nipples an exploratory squeeze.
“We’ve got a home,” I answered, feeling defensive of you and I, “and I’ve plenty of Galleons. Enough to begin a life for ourselves. Besides, the pair of us both can work. There’s potions equipment in the basement of Grimmauld Place, too. I’m sure, with a little bit of work that Draco could set it up into a working laboratory–"
You must have seen my panic cross my face because you closed the space between us and wrapped your fingers around the nape of my neck. You kissed me so lovingly in front of our friends, Draco, and then you told me that I wouldn’t have to speak to the whole of the crowd.
Do you think it is possible? We would have to become right experts in order to keep the connection going while doing something as distracting as going down on each other. Imagine doing it while we’re doing it. Oh Circe, we have to become the best Legilimens there are. The idea of feeling what you are feeling during sex turns me on so much.
I still can’t believe that you weren’t angry with me. You simply hushed my stream of apologies, took my hands in yours and put them on your chest. You pulled me closer, hugging your arms around me, and we only stood there for a moment, just breathing.
I’ve unbuttoned my pyjama top and slid it over my shoulders. I don’t know what it’s like in your dormitory, but here it’s damn chilly. The Warming Charm that I set earlier must be long broken, because I feel the cold of the castle caressing my skin.
So, in conclusion, while I cannot wait for tomorrow – well, today, it is just past midnight – all my masturbatory fantasies involve one thing, and one thing only, and that is you, my devilishly sexy, entirely delicious darling.
Sweet Salazar, I’m sorry. You know what? I’m only having all these thoughts because I’m worried that she will reject me. Or us. I suppose that I have changed a great deal. And while I’m liking the person I’m becoming so much better, I can’t be sure that old friends will. But I guess that I’ll have to accept that she’s her own person and I can’t control her reaction.
I'm sure you noticed how I was luring you along the edge of the Forbidden Forest, over to the open hills that were tinged blue and black in the little remaining daylight we had. You had fallen behind a bit, certainly trusting that I would give you a chance to catch up before we would turn the tables again. But instead, I cast a Lumos so you wouldn’t lose me, and leant forward, spurring that old broom to its limits.
P.S. Of course, we’re not eloping. We’re not getting bonded without Ron, Hermione, Andromeda, Edward, and Mother. Daft oaf you are. I love you.
It’s getting close to midnight, and I don’t want to get caught by Flitch, not if I can help it. I know he does his rounds about now and I’ve already seen that mangy creature Mrs Norris sniffing around up here. Being the gigantic prat that I am, I didn’t bring my cloak with me.
My best guess is that she would have been mildly disappointed and maybe she’d even have demanded that I act out on my fantasies with men for a few years after my graduation (perhaps on one of those continent trips my ancestors made) and eventually behave myself and settle down with a witch. Would have. Since the family name went to the dogs, I assume that this might have changed. I must hope that the War has shifted expectations and wishes for the better in this department.
, that he ran from breakfast without turning back. When Malfoy finally caught up to him, on top of the Astronomy Tower, of course, trying to slither his way out of that atrocious affair, Golden Boy cursed him – almost as bad as the Sectumsempra two years ago, they say! Worse even! But that wasn’t enough for the merciless vigilante. While the Death Eater was hospitalised – the Saviour himself must have taken pity in him, Harry so good at heart – the green-eyed lover sought out our Headmistress, demanding an immediate International Portkey to Italy where he gave Zabini the hiding of his life, not bothering with spells but using his raw fists. Poor Harry planned to stay away from Hogwarts for good and start a new life as a dragonologist in the solitude of the Swedish dragon reservation where his raw power would match even the most ferocious creatures without any restraints for the beasts. At heart though, the silvery Swedish Short-Snouts with their platinum scales and pale-blue eyes would always remind him of the ‘dragon’ he has lost. Upon realising that he couldn’t bear to live a life in such yearnful agony, the Chosen One did return to Hogwarts in the end. And he made a beeline for the Hospital Wing where he apologised to the Slytherin, only under the condition that he must tame his sexual antics, of course. It’s a pity, really, that the Saviour is as besotted as he is. But who can blame him for fancying a charmer like Malfoy? All conviction aside, he looks quite fit with this ruthless smirk and piercing eyes of his.
I’ll go to bed soon, but first I need to prepare some stuff. I won’t say when exactly but these practical exams with Slughorn that you mentioned, which your mate gloriously ruined? It’s my turn this week. Potions might be one of the classes I could finish with an E or perhaps even an O if I’m lucky. I didn’t know whether to tell you or not, but yeah. Maybe we see each other in potions once we’re back to listening to the old crawler again. Definitely one of the Potter-fanboys, this one.
You thought for a moment, then grinned. “Well, I guess they play in my mind automatically when I’m thinking about the Patronus Charm. I didn’t even realise I was thinking about them.”
Now, however, I won’t read what you’ve written because it will either be about today’s brilliant lie-in with exceptionally amazing sex with you atop my hips or it will be about talking and kissing in the tub which, likewise, might get me a bit too excited.
I have to ask, love: do I genuinely Accio things nonverbally? Honest to Merlin, I really didn’t know that I could. That was entirely unconscious on my part. A minute ago, I tried to Accio this diary from across the room and I wasn’t successful. All it did was hover for a moment, and then drop back down on the wood, which was a touch pathetic coming from a so-called Saviour.
Harry, sleeping with you in that room, so exhausted and tired after our orgasms – it was the best gift. The perfect way to end the day rather than rushing off into our respective beds. Gods below, I always and forever want to sleep naked with you, arm in arm, your scent in my nostrils and your hair tickling my nose.
There are things I want to tell you, things that I’ve skimmed over or prevaricated in our letters. I don’t want there to be anything concealed or hidden between us. Not anymore.
What I will talk about is the following: Had Kyteler been caught before she fled to England, in my opinion, she would have righteously been accused (death penalty might be a bit harsh, but not out of the ordinary for that time). From the records, she was a Dark Muggleborn witch who never received education, and therefore possibly never learnt anything about her heritage (this part will grant me the top mark). What is utterly ridiculous is the Muggles’ decision to flog and burn Kyteler’s maid in lieu of her. There’s not a single sign that the woman was a witch.
I’m incredibly excited for you, my love. You found the most beautiful words to tell me about your experience of the Yuletide celebrations yesterday. I don’t find any envy in me (which is new, I mean it when I say that I used to be a selfish prick), but I’m overflowing with joy that you had the chance to partake in such arcane rituals and that it was such a meaningful experience for you.
, but that’s not even the point – family… It means that those who call themselves your friends are treacherous. Mother wouldn’t trust anyone who isn’t family – especially not with her whole future at stake.”
Think about in the same terms as Lucius, and the draconian terms of your probation: in order to simply survive you’ve had to plough on, staying brave, staying strong, because if you actually stopped to think about everything that you’d lost, all in one go, then you wouldn’t be able to function.
I need to tell you something. I was about to ask you whether you are going to stay here at Hogwarts for Yuletide or Christmas. Or are you spending the holidays at your house? With friends?
Soon enough the public won't remember that we were ever apart. They’ll be a drunken Quidditch player falling out of a club soon enough, a new Ministry scandal or a public duel on Knockturn and then we’ll be old news, I promise you that. We'll be yesterday's headline.
But back to you first. Having grown up without siblings, without cousins – I must ask what it is like to take care of such a young child. You said babies can be a bit boring, so I assume he may sleep a lot? Can he sit or maybe even speak a few syllables? Please excuse my ignorance. I have never even held a baby in my life. Whenever you mention Edward, you sound like you love him very dearly. I swear, even your scrawl seems to look more rounded, and I wouldn’t be half surprised, should I find your i's dotted with hearts. It’s the most wholesome thing and I’m very glad that you can be with him right now.
You’re a feast for the senses. The very personification of an aphrodisiac. I’m in no doubt that were I to brew Amortentia right now, then I’d smell the vanilla, guaiac wood and almond of your aftershave and the sweet fresh scent of your sweat. I’d smell the ink and parchment of our joined diaries, and the minty fragrance of the teeth-cleaning charms that I taste whenever our lips meet.
Okay. My mates are heading back towards the table so if I end this suddenly, you’ll understand why I had to vanish.
You put your hand on my thigh, and when I looked at you, I saw a hint of worry in your face. “Is this alright?” you asked. “I know it’s not much and it’s in disrepair.”
Which brings me straight to your grave concerns about forks and spoons and knives and suchlike. There’s a reason why there are whole books on that subject matter. It’s fabulous, there’s a rule for everything.
So, this is me, trying to be brave the way you have already been. I'm going to tell you more about who I really am. You’re right: I was raised by Muggles. However, both of my parents were fully magic.
This quill will live in the office of our home, on the scratched mahogany of the ancient old desk. It’ll sit beside our diaries, reminders of our strange, twisted path to finding each other. I’m going to give you fair warning now: in years to come, when we live together, I’ll be terribly naughty, my darling. I’ll steal your jumpers and wear them when I’m chilly and I’ll steal the blankets from your side of the bed. I’ll cuddle up close to you on the settee and I’ll steal your body heat.
And from what I’ve said during the interview, Luna chose the perfect excerpt. My upbringing as a pureblood and moreover as a Malfoy, mentioned in one sentence with me holding tight onto your fingers – it’s pure gold. That’s exactly how media tells a story, Harry. Not that I think we were but a story, but people do. I’m the charming, misunderstood wizard who makes the Golden Boy happy. And for every Quibbler reader who believes in all kinds of superstitions, they will get out of this article how incredibly well our auras match.
While writing this brilliant rumour down, I was interrupted by a young Gryffindor witch (I’m sitting in the library). She asked, “Is it true that your boyfriend apologised to you even though you were the one who cheated on him?”
You looked gorgeous at breakfast Draco. All pink-cheeked, soap-clean and delectable. I hope you didn’t mind me coming and sitting down next to you. The whole bench took a collective breath – did you notice? – but when I looked around not one of them dared to meet my eye. Having a reputation is useful, I think, every so often. I swear, McGonagall quirked a smile in our direction.
If you’d rather go about this a little gentler, tell me how and when and we write our names in the diary simultaneously. Let me know which way you’d prefer.
I finally feel like a fucking human being again. By Hecate, I haven’t known how much I missed Sleekeazy’s until I used it. I haven’t been wearing any hair cream since sometime in Sixth Year when everything worldly seemed to lose all meaning to me. Anyway. Not talking about that.
You said in your last letter that pure-blood life was really prim and proper and maybe going to school could have rectified that, just a little bit? Given you a wider perspective? I can’t help but think that throwing all our children together at eleven is an appalling idea. Everyone was so stiff and difficult those first few weeks at school, but that was because we didn’t know each other.
Hermione said the pair of us made the most tremendously romantic spectacle this morning, with our sleep-deprived appearance, our matching dishevelled robes and our almost-permanently clasped hands.
I didn’t give those testimonies because of some depth of feeling or because I have some great, shining heart. I just knew that there’d already been too much waste, loss and heartbreak. I’d died to save the wizarding world, and all they wanted was to use and manipulate my reputation to lock away those they deemed the baddies. That didn’t sit well with me. Truth is, I didn’t even know if my words would even be enough to keep you out of Azkaban.
The year before my Hogwarts education started, my parents and I spent the Spring Equinox in Mexico. On the day of the Equinox, wixen – and I would believe Muggles, too – celebrate the occasion at the Temple of Kukulcán. It’s a step-pyramid with a stairway to each side. At the foot of the stone stairs on the northern side of the pyramid, there’s a giant snake head with its tongue out and adorned with feathers instead of scales. That’s a Mayan deity, Kukulcán, the feathered serpent. It’s not clear whether the creature is a Muggle invention or whether it’s an extinct magical beast, or a dragon perhaps.
A whole night alone, with nobody else around to steal our attention, and without a million stupid rules that don’t make sense anymore?  All I desire is to be close to you and I’m elated that we get to spend a whole night together without any limitations. I was heartily grateful that you told me when you did though. I wouldn’t have wanted you to see our home in its present dusty condition. Kreacher is the House Elf that lives there – and yes, I’ve tried and tried to give him his freedom, but he refuses to contemplate the idea! – and I’ve sent him instructions to make us up a bedroom with crisp clean sheets and get the place looking as splendid as he possibly can in the time he has left.
And I know that I let you down the garden path with my identity, but the truth is, you did the very same. We were neither of us scrupulously honest, but neither of us believed that we could be. Both of us had too much to lose. You said that you can’t possibly ask for my forgiveness, but quite frankly that’s another piece of nonsense. You’ve been very clear about your history in our letters, the closed world of your youth and how hard you tried to fulfil your father’s power-driven objectives.
I stroked your silky-soft hair, and you made the fondest noises. Let’s never stop kissing, Draco because I could feel all of your love, as loud as if you were telling me with words. When you broke our embrace, you were beaming, your eyes shining. “Those prats shouldn’t be back here for a few hours at least,” you told me, walking me over to the bed, “we’ve got plenty of time. Thought we might use some of it to put that thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift to good use, mm? How does that sound?”
Darling, of course it consisted of eighty percent sweets and twenty percent actual food. The evening was for you. But I had honestly no idea what else the House-Elves would prepare other than Treacle Tart and Cauldron Cakes which I insisted upon. But apparently, they remembered our requests for the fancy dinner we had just about two months ago, for these roasted red and golden beets were rather upscale. I’m dead sure the dressing was with balsamic vinegar and honey which is completely off limits for the usual Hogwarts feast. These lovely (and even to me very friendly) creatures simply adore you, Harry.
Dozing and talking afterwards was the greatest luxury. I felt warm and cosy with you in my arms, darling. It’s a shame that my two roommates didn’t take even longer to be healed.
The hair across my tummy is curly, soft and very dark. It feels scandalously arousing to let myself finally enjoy that part of my physique. I never have before. I’ve always been a little embarrassed by its gaudy masculinity. Now though? Perhaps I’m beginning to see the attraction of it. I'm beginning to see myself through your eyes.
He’s got to take that first step into his adult life by himself. I don’t feel guilty about changing my life plans, but perhaps I need to try to be a better friend to him over the next few months. Ron told me too that he had tried his utmost to give Hermione all the space she wants to revise and get ready for the upcoming exams but like always, she is taking the revision to extremes. Even when they do spend time together, she often can do little more than sleep.
I wasn’t sure what to answer him, truth be told. I knew you were right for me before I ever knew your name. I knew you were right for me on a visceral, instinctual level. That wouldn’t work for an answer though, and Seamus was looking at me expectantly.
I’m sure there’ll be hiccups along the way but you’ve got to remember that all of these people love us. They're not looking to trip us up, or hurt us. Like your mother says, ‘keep in mind how dear you are to me.’ That’s exactly how Mrs Weasley, and Andi, and even little Teddy, when he gets a bit bigger, will feel too. That you are a dear person, beloved and cared about.
Okay, Harry. I hope that my lengthy ramblings on different glass types didn’t get you too excited. You proudly presented me with the flutes you’ve found, beautiful clear crystal once with an elaborate pattern. Of course, I had to tease you, mon chéri.
Our game was the best fun of the evening though. A kiss on the forehead for every question I answered, a kiss on the jaw for every answer I got correct, and a kiss on the lips for every piece of work completed to your satisfaction.
One last thing. I wrote to Mother some days ago and told her about you. Knowing about this whole Horcrux deal will possibly help her decide which arcane rituals and potions to consider regarding your magic. That’s another thing I’ve read about on my journey through all the Prophet issues I had missed over the summer. Old families know a thing or two about Horcruxes in contrast to your common Mind Healer, but I don’t want to get your hopes up. Might as well come to nothing.
I love you too. I don’t care about what you might have done. I don’t care about your past or your reputation. I don't care what you look like.
Draco, never ever apologise for mentioning to anyone that we’re in a relationship. We are, and the sooner the world gets used to us, the better it’ll be, and if my public persona helped you convince Slughorn, then all the better for it. Being famous has got to be worth something more than negative
Do you remember that talk we had with Mother right after we booked the catering service? She wanted to talk us out of it again, saying how impulsive a decision it was to get bonded so quickly and that, if we so wish, we could remain betrothed for a decent amount of time at least.
But anyway. The four of us went on to less risky topics, and I felt like we all were enjoying our time. It’s good to know that we can have a more or less honest talk like that without being resentful for the rest of the day. I sometimes feel like that’s what family is about. No matter how and why Mother and I disagree, in the end I never doubt that we are there for each other.
I wouldn’t have said anything, hadn’t I seen you rolling your eyes at this behaviour before. But I did, Harry.
Getting on the bus was the first giggle. Your eyes were as round as cauldrons when you realised that our buses don’t provide beds – which, even after being a part of the wizarding world since I was eleven, I still find a bizarre, and frankly quite gross concept! – but instead are fitted only with seats.
But I loved it. I loved every part of sleeping with you. I loved the grey shine of your eyes as I swallowed and sucked your beautiful prick, and the throaty noises that you made. I loved the taste of you, that heady, musky taste that I’m rapidly getting addicted to.
My Mind Healer nodded, pleased that I’d remembered his words so well. “And we talked a little bit about how your public persona was the brave, strong hero, the wizard that had battled Voldemort. The one who saved us all. The private person was the one who was terrified. The person who felt reluctant, who felt fear for his friends. Harry, like we said last time, both of these individuals exist – they’re both equally you, and equally real – but sometimes they’re in conflict and, in my opinion, that’s precisely what you are struggling with now.”
