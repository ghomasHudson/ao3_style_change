Saturday dawned bright and so cold that the windows of the kitchen were frosted around the edges. Lily was sat at the window ledge, using her nail to trace designs in the ice. “DD?” She asked, not looking up from her work, “if you and Daddy are getting married, does that mean that you’re going to have sex? And have more babies?”
“What’d you say to him, Harry?” Teddy asks, looking between the two.
“You mean,
“Good things come to those who wait!” Antoni calls from the kitchen, where he’s assembling drinks on a large tray.
“Speaking of knickers,” Malfoy continued, “You should see me in a pair of stockings and a garter belt. I’ve got the best legs in Slytherin.”
Jonathan’s fingers get stuck in Harry’s hair as he tries to run them through the mass of curls. He carefully extricates them, maintaining a big, genuine smile. “Well, this hair has never met its match. And that match is me! Duh! I’m going to tame this mane, and you are going to strut around the Ministry for Magic like a pageant queen on her victory tour, henny. Let’s get you shampooed and ready!” He claps his hands in delight, then takes off Harry’s glasses and places them on the table in front of the chair. “Allons-y!”
Harry huffed out a small laugh. “I mean, I know you know that I can be a bit thick from time to time. But I was especially thick in this situation. When I got the letter from Lily’s school, my only thought was to minimize the damage. If I didn’t make a big deal out of that little arsehole calling me ‘The Chosen Fairy’ in front of Lily, then, perhaps, the whole thing would just go away. Her teacher assured me the kid had been disciplined and his parents talked to, and so I didn’t want you to have to hear about it at all. I wasn’t thinking about handling the incident as a parent; I was thinking about handling it as your partner, trying to, I don’t know… shield you from a six year old?” Harry sat back in his chair and raised his hands as if in resignation. “I know it was shortsighted. But I didn’t mean to disclude you from anything regarding Lily or making decisions about how to parent her. I didn’t even floo Ginny about it, which it’s now occuring to me was also idiotic.”
Potter looked between Draco and Scorpius, and then stooped forward to take Scorpius’ hand in his much larger one. He smiled.
Ginny nodded and gave Harry’s hand a squeeze. “I’ll be by Thursday to pick up the monsters. Don’t forget to ask Saul about the recipe book for Mum, ok?”
“That is the cutest thing I’ve ever heard and I have three nieces! Sorry girls, Uncle Bobby loves you the most though!” Bobby adds, grimacing at the camera.
Draco moved his hips so that Harry slipped out of him and he sat up, wrinkling his nose at the mess between them. “Potter, be a dear and clean this up, hmm?”
“These are
“Draco, please...I’m not going to last,” Harry ground out, trying to stave off his impending orgasm.
Teddy lets his head drop into his hands, his little shoulders shaking as he cries.
“Sobering charm.
[Camera pans around a large, old kitchen. Antoni pokes around in the cabinets while Kreacher watches from the corner, wringing his hands and muttering to himself.]
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s wrist, and pulled him up and out of the Common Room towards the stairs to the boys’ dormitories. Halfway up the stairs Malfoy knocked Harry’s hand away and rounded on him. “Are you fucking kidding me with this nonsense? I’m the one who should be herding you, you insufferable idiot! I was in the middle of my practice!” He pulled Harry up the rest of the stairs and flung the door of the first dormitory on the right open.
“We’ve wanted you to be our son forever since the moment we all came home together for the first time, when you could barely walk and talk. This is just a piece of paper that’s filed away at the ministry. In our hearts, you’ve been our son for almost seven years.” Harry meets Draco’s gaze over Teddy’s head, raising his eyebrows and looking nervous.
As is her wont, Pansy sent us all home with ridiculously expensive gift bags full of sex toys, Belgian chocolates, and lingerie (or, what Pansy calls “the ingredients for a casual night in”). The next morning, I left said gift bag in my and Harry’s bedroom before absconding into the en suite to scrub off my sins in a bathtub full of lavender and mint.
Today would be the last day of trials for the Death Eaters. Two days ago, Narcissa Malfoy had been sentenced to two years’ probation with the promise of her doing voluntary work in Muggle shelters. Everybody knew the Wizengamot had used this particular punishment because of the Malfoy´s hatred towards Muggles in general. They aimed to humiliate, and they succeeded. Harry had turned up and spoken a plea for her, reminding everyone, that she had, in fact, lied to Voldemort about him being dead. He had a feeling that this was why she did not have to go to prison and was glad he could return the favor some.
Ron pushed Draco into the fireplace and joined him after. The silence; when the remaining five friends of Harry Potter caught sight of a bewildered-looking Draco Malfoy and a fierce-looking Ron; was stunning.
He looked perfect.
Harry knelt in front of Draco and smirked inwardly at his luck. Malfoy was so going to lose this time. Harry couldn´t believe that Malfoy actually caved, the weakling. He didn´t have to look up to know that the other was staring down at him, but he did anyway, just to see Malfoy squirming. Harry had never seen the blond looking so out of order before in his life, and he took pleasure in knowing that he was the one causing this.
“WHAT?!” Harry raised his voice, not really angry with his friends, but he wanted an explanation at the very least.
Harry shrugged. “Why would you? We were never friends and you wouldn´t have cared anyway.”
Gosh, I´m dealing with my writer´s block by posting this short little thing, just to keep my fingers and my brain busy! Hope you like it – let me know! See you out there!
Harry moaned loudly and seconds after he screamed as much as he could with a mouth full of cock pumping in and out of him. Draco met Finnegan´s eyes and nodded and Harry was flooded from behind and the front at the same time. He swallowed greedily what his friend offered, and groaned at the losses when both Seamus and Draco dropped out of him, and fell onto the bed, spent.
“That leaves Gryffindor girls. Lisa, can you do that?” Goldstein asked Lisa Turpin who agreed. “This will be brilliant.”
Malfoy snapped and Harry startled when wet lips crashed against his own.
“Nobody should be
Malfoy looked away; he could not even keep eye contact. Harry snickered and let his hands find purchase in Malfoy´s pants before swiftly pulling down the zip and popping open the button. “Last chance to chicken out, minuteman," Harry mocked.
you feel?” Dean dared to demand. Harry placed his hands behind his head and bit into his bottom lip.
Harry moaned…
Ron blinked and stared at Malfoy; Draco that is. “I´m coming through Malfoy, no arguing.” And without waiting for a response and with the knowledge that Narcissa Malfoy could very well cast a spell the second he landed, he embraced his Gryffindor courage and entered Malfoy Manor, hoping to still be breathing in the morning.
“Oh no, but you do snog them, let them suck you off and-”
Draco stopped to take off  Harry´s glasses and leaned across him to place them on the table. He succeeded on his third try, and Harry yanked him on top of him and claimed his lips.
idea what that shirt cost, you better repl-“
before Malfoy was out of there. Through the following day, Harry must have been scowling terribly. “Lover´s quarrel?” Ron asked, jokingly as they sat in the Gryffindor common room later that afternoon; only Harry wasn´t the least bit amused by his comment.
Narcissa stopped just outside the room for a moment.
“It is a fame I never asked for, nor liked at any time, regardless of what anyone else believes. It is to me a mere nuisance to be followed around by reporters trying to ask me how I prefer to take a dump.”
“Oh god… Potter, what…”
Sorry, been so busy lately - 5 weeks until my third child under 4 is due :D
Everyone´s eyes widened and a few whistled. "Each round, you will have 15 minutes in total. Everyone can watch or not as they please, as long as the audience stays quiet. On the line is 50 House Points per round. If your opponent doesn`t say ´STOP´within the 15 minutes then their house gets the points. If they do say ´STOP` then your house gets the points. Simple. Any couples among us might want to agree on basic rules between themselves if they have any during this game.” He flicked his wand, and a selection of beer, wine, and snacks appeared on every table.
Draco´s eyes flew to his.
Draco simply nodded, knowing he was not allowed to speak while the chairman did.
“Rolanda Hooch will be your flying instructor.” The short grey-haired witch winked at the crowd.
“Draco Malfoy never had that same chance. He was taught from the time he was an infant to threaten or blackmail his way around getting the things he wanted. People became his friends because of bloodlines, money, and duty. He never knew who he could trust. And if he did decide to trust someone with things, he would be seen as a weakling, because Malfoys do not share emotions. Pure-bloods do not share emotions. The only purebloods who have been different were the Gryffindor ones, really. But even they were not raised the same way. They were raised with love, to love. The only exception I can think of was my Godfather, Sirius Black, but he had the best friends in the world at Hogwarts, so he overcame his families´ ways. When it got too much, he fled his home and was welcomed into my own father´s home. He had an escape. Draco Malfoy never did.”
“W-what?” Draco pulled away. “Y-you… wait… come on Harry… you´re…” He drew in a deep breath. “Harry Potter is not a virgin!”
“Stop pretending, Dray, I can bloody well see your pole´s reaction from down here.” Malfoy flushed and moved toward the door but Goyle growled. “Get the fuck over here and snog him.” Then Harry´s dick was engulfed in heat once more.
“Jesus, Seam… no wonder you get laid all the bloody time…” Harry panted and before Seamus could wipe away the stupid grin, Harry had welcomed his saluting flesh into his mouth and sucked hard.
“For anything, I may have some blame in that matter. I am the one he reached out to on more than one occasion. He tried to become my friend, to find his way out, and I wouldn´t let him. All because I was too hurt myself, too angry to see the truth - and too selfish.”
“You would love that, wouldn´t you?” Harry moved closer so that his hip was bumping into Malfoy´s groin, “We all saw that earlier. Mm, you just,
Harry grinned. "Cat got your tongue?” He stepped closer and Malfoy tensed up but Harry ignored it. Harry´s right hand rose and a single finger traced Malfoy´s jawline. Malfoy gasped. “I started to feel sorry for you instead of disliking you some time last year. That´s when Voldemort´s thoughts and actions involving you and your family became clearer to me. Voldemort´s and my minds were connected by the curse he hit me with when I was a baby.” The finger traced a cheekbone now. “Sometimes he sent images at me, that´s how… my godfather died. And other times I got glimpses, he didn´t know about. Like you, being ordered to do stuff, and I could be there and witness and sort of… feel your resentment towards it.”
“Maybe,” Harry grumbled. “He could have bloody said so when I told him how I felt.”
?” The Slytherin made no effort in hiding his growl when hearing Harry speaking his first name. Harry looked down at Goyle´s hand that had stilled its movements. His dick was not as long as Malfoy´s but much thicker; he was still above average though. It seemed only natural to check of Zabini´s cock, too.
Harry  grinned at absolutely nothing but caught up with Malfoy and practically jumped in front of him to block his way.
date him then?” Draco drawled.
Draco turned around and began walking away but Harry grabbed his right shoulder to stop his movements.
“So?” Dean said when he saw her.
“Mmm, I know just the thing to make you forget, Potter.” Harry noticed the brown eyes shining. Harry swallowed and forced his dick to behave.
,” Malfoy desperately ordered his childhood friend, but was unsuccessful, naturally.
Harry´s hips rose again, and again. Over and over, Harry kept fucking Goyle´s very willing mouth. He would have to think later, why any Slytherin would offer him pleasure willingly, but hey he was a teenage guy, on the verge of coming clean about being at least bisexual, so like hell he was going to turn down this kind of spectacular blowjob.
Harry was on fire the moment Draco´s mouth started dancing with his own. He had never kissed a man before, girls yes, but this would be a first and nothing could have prepared him for the electric feeling roaming through his insides, burning its way to his heart.
Harry silenced him by sucking a nipple into his mouth.
“That´s not. No! I just… Tell me the truth, Draco, do you want only me?”
“Whaaat?” Ron whined at his mother.
“Oi, Malfoy!” he shouted when spotting his blond hair on the second floor, finally, heavily panting. Even though he had plenty of practice on a broom, he was pants at running, it´d been years since he ran away from Dudley´s gang after all.
it has potential.”
“Bring it, Malfoy.” Harry walked away and Malfoy waited a minute before moving toward his next class.
”Tell me the truth Harry, why did you let him join us?”
Draco sucked harder hearing his new nickname. “Dray? You better not ca-“
“I will.” Someone in the way back said, loud and clearly making every head in the courtroom turn around. Even Draco, who had been sitting hunched over in the chair in the middle of the stone floor, looking even paler than usual turned to see who had spoken.
“Let me kiss you.” Malfoy shook his head again. “I want you, Draco.”
“Mr. Potter, how do you feel about Mr. Malfoy now then?”
Powerful, Pure-blooded males at that. He winced again. No fucking way was he, Draco Malfoy, getting pregnant. That would mean, that his body would change, not to mention the pain. Sure, others would admire him even more, since it was rarely done, but it would be too much of a bother.
And Draco knew Harry had just given him the strength to survive, even Azkaban.
More laughter.
until sixth year I guess, can´t really pinpoint it, it just sort of happened.”
The smile Harry offered Draco made him dizzy. So much passion had never been cast his way before; he swallowed and smiled back. He would have to get used to Harry´s reactions to him, but more importantly, he would have to work on his own reactions to Harry. He didn´t mind being honest and open when they were alone, but no Malfoy could risk it in public in fear of an enemy finding a weakness to use against him.
“What game are you babbling about, Potter? The inter-house drinking game was-“
“I love it, but it does make it hard to concentrate. Mind you, you´re divine and alluring like a damn Veela, my mind swims when I´m close to you. Which, by the way, I am not used to.”
He was a broken man. He still had his money, but what good would that do, when he would be rotting away for being someone he was not? He wished he could re-do his life. He would have been someone else. He would have been himself.
“I am the only Malfoy child, I have to…”
Harry jumped when he felt a hand sliding down his chest, gently caressing. “You really are quite…
“Mr. Potter, you may come forth to deliver your speech.”
“You fucked men to be good for me?” Harry´s voice had amusement in it.
It was said almost gently, but coming from the Dark Lord himself, every Death Eater, including Draco, knew it to be an order. Draco looked at his parents before walking towards their Master. Because, even though Draco had been forced into this, that was still what he was to him.
“Uhm, I´m not so sure
“No way, this is your thing, not mine. I´m not…”
“- but I didn´t fall for you,
“That´s fine, Harry… but Goyle? Mate, he´s a… well, besides the points of him being a Slytherin and the son of a Death Eater, he´s…
“Such a dirty little mouth, Ferret. Does your father know? Oh, I guess you lost…
This time when the door opened both Ginny and Ron stood up with their mouths hanging open. “MOM?” They yelled in unison. Molly Weasley walked in with her head held high, proudly taking her seat at the head table as all her three children present stared in confusion. “Yes,” McGonagall chuckled, “A lovely surprise if I do say so myself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“My tongue pushing to get inside… while my hand is playing with your sac…”
“I´m sorry, Harry, that was very wrong of us, but you weren´t telling us anything, and it was driving us mad thinking about how to… how to…” Hermione stopped, not knowing how to express it.
“For anything, I may have some blame in that matter. I am the one he reached out to, on more than one occasion. He tried to become my friend, to find his way out, and I wouldn´t let him. All because I was too hurt myself, to angry to see the truth - and too selfish.”
“I DIDN`T LIE!” His breath came fast and uncontrolled for the first time in years. “I… look Weasley… he deserves better… I can´t give him what he wants… what he needs…” He closed his eyes. “Just let me go.”
“I didn´t plan on it, but he´s… he won´t stop… I think about him all the bloody time… and the dreams are…”
Malfoy
Harry gritted his teeth and growled his next words: “Stop pretending you didn´t get hard from my touch; stop fucking denying that I was so close to bringing you off that you chickened out of the game! So, you get head often, huh, then that just makes me all the better at sucking cock, doesn´t it?” Harry quirked his brow suggestively at the blond.
Harry couldn't cope with the fear and pain this situation was causing him. He needed an outlet, so he banged his fist against the mantelpiece several times until it started to bleed. He rested his head against the wall and breathed heavily. “Fuck.”
It was only his dark skinned dorm mate and his red haired friend by his side at the moment, and Harry was grateful for that, knowing that Hermione would have plowed through his every thought if she was here too. It was Dean that broke the awkward silence at last. “Did you confess then?”
, you bastard.”
“What for?” Harry said.
“Fuck,
“And sometimes, one must make an example, to make sure that one´s followers have respect.”
“That must be Harry,” Neville said.
, too.
that´s… you nearly touched my dick, you freak!” The room was alive with laughter.
“Draco, come.” His father understood when to make a run for it, he knew they would get no other options. But Draco didn´t move.
“Fuck Malfoy… that´s just mean… I didn´t think Malfoys would…”
… so fucking tight, Harry…”
Harry was not sure if they all got that kind of treatment and frankly he didn´t care.
…” Ron whined and Hermione´s hand ran down the length of her boyfriend´s arm.
like that. Ugh, that´s…” Harry laughed and nodded in understanding, and then they were interrupted by Goldstein.
“Malfoy,” she said, with only a moment of thought and Malfoy twitched, but confidently smirking he walked to the couch also to take a seat.
It just wasn´t done.
Malfoy must have cast a spell on him, he was sure of it. Why else would he suddenly be thinking about the git´s semen non-stop, or bending him over a desk and driving his hot and bothered dick in the Slytherin´s tight…
Ron grinned and glanced at the center of the room. His face fell and his smile faltered when seeing Goyle standing there, grinning stupidly at him. “W-what?” Ron squeaked out, causing the Slytherins to laugh louder still.
Harry snorted at Malfoy´s childish joke, before yanking down both pants and boxers, which allowed him to stare at the pale, small cock now in front of his glasses. “I guess wealth doesn´t go hand in hand with hitting puberty and
Draco huffed. “Stop laughing, I don´t understand your mumbling." He was doing his best to sound annoyed, but failed.
“I love him.”
“You looked like a scared, helpless bird for the entire first year of school, which is why you were the teacher´s pet in most classes. I bet you never knew that.”
Luna simply snickered, “Yeah, but I won, didn´t I?” She winked at him before returning to her table to wild cheers. She had just earned her house 100 points and made sure Malfoy lost 50.
Moments later, the door was shut so loudly that they feared it had been blasted off its hinges. He made to get up but Hermione stopped him in the process.
And that´s when he had awoken.
“I want to kiss you.”
Fingers found his right nipple and began playing with it. Harry groaned, straining his ears to hear Draco´s words.
“But you´re a Slytherin, you would never willingly…” Harry began.
“Yeah. Hot, sexy, naked, sexual ones,” Harry countered. Ron spluttered while Hermione sat there staring intensely.
The bed shifted as Draco sat down in silence. Harry opened his eyes but didn´t turn around, he waited for Draco to start speaking.
They pulled apart and his mother kissed his cheek. “I was so afraid you would be –“ She sniffed with as much grace she could under the circumstances.
“In our sixth year, I discovered by accident that Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater, and even my friends believed that I was delusional at first. So, I decided to follow him around everywhere he went. I did that for a whole year.”
mother, you know what I must do.” He paced the sitting area; his hands were clasped together behind his back, where they were still having tea and biscuits. Malfoys do not pace around a room like a bloody madman, not even gracefully. There were a lot of things Malfoys did not do, one of which would be refuse to take over the leadership of the bloodline.
“How is your father holding up in Azkaban these days?” Nott`s eyes narrowed warningly, but she braced herself and moved towards him. “Not (pun intended) in the mood to chat I take it? Pity.” Snickers were heard, and Goyle hurled an insult but was silenced by Goldstein. She sat down next to the male and moved closer, causing the other to flinch involuntarily. “I smell bad, do I?” More snickers from the crowd. “Maybe I taste better, would you like to find out?” She pushed her wrist under his nose and he looked like he was about to bite it off if she let it rest there for much longer.
There was a long pause while Harry, hidden from view under his invisibility cloak, thought that over. No matter what a spoiled git Malfoy had been, nobody deserved this.
Malfoy closed his pants. “9 o´clock, Potter, don´t be late.” The blond turned and walked away.
“Mr. Malfoy, the Wizengamot has reached a verdict. You have confessed to us that you took the Dark Mark out of your own free will, you have confessed to the torture of several Muggle-born wizards, and furthermore, you have confessed to threatening other wizards to make them cooperate with your agenda. Mr. Potter has explained to us, what kind of life and morals you have been raised under as a pure-blood wizard from the Malfoy family.”
“No sir.” Harry flushed heavily.
“We need to work on this, Harry,
Seamus, Dean and Hermione needed explanations on what exactly that meant, so Luna offered her knowledge. Ron got up onto his knees and growled when she was finished.
Voldemort is infuriated that both Malfoy males have let him down and plans to punish both. Lucius, by ending his bloodline, and Draco, by killing him, in front of everyone at Hogwarts. Voldemort has already asked Harry to spare his friends´ lives by coming to him, but so far, he has not. Harry is hiding under his cloak as he watches the scene evolve.
Draco glanced to his left to catch his mother´s eyes hoping for help since she had two wands, but no help came.
“The war has ended and Voldemort is gone,” her eyes caught sight of Harry´s green ones, causing the teen to blush as everyone else began to cheer and whistle. McGonagall gestured for silence after some time had passed. Harry was glad; he didn´t think he would ever get used to the attention.
“No, I wouldn´t. I probably would have…”
Harry could have sworn that McGonagall wiped away a tear before continuing her flow of words. She cleared her throat. “The Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and Head of Gryffindor House will be another Weasley, just to add to the confusion amongst the students.” The headmistress laughed, “Passiing every essential test from the Ministry, and as a former student of mine and now a very dear friend, well, I present to you, Professor Weasley.”
Harry grinned and licked his lips. Malfoy tucked himself in before dressing again. “Fucking bastard,” he said before leaving Harry and the room behind.
Draco removed Harry´s shirt, with Harry lifting his arms to help in silence. Draco threw the piece of clothes somewhere behind him in the darkness.
“Draco.” Harry´s voice rang loudly in his ears even though. Draco knew he had only whispered his name from close behind him.
“Dear
Malfoy enjoyed watching the fire burn in Potter´s eyes; as always it brought him so much satisfaction. In reality, it was what made his days at Hogwarts worth enduring. To witness Potter explode was the most intense experience Malfoy had ever had. And to be the one bringing Potter there, well, it brought him more power than he could ever describe to anyone really.
See you out there - and Please leave a comment.
Draco knew he had fucked up, royally, one might add.
“Only my dignity.”
Harry begged for more once Draco began moving. “Please… more… I need
Draco moaned, and for the first time in his life, he didn´t care who heard him. “Yessss.” Harry had moved on to his neck, sucking and teasing as he pulled his blonde locks.
“I know, but that´s not my main concern, Harry. Being gay I can live with, it’s the
“Sure, Ron, see you later at dinner then.” Harry looked up and met his best friend´s eyes.
“It is not Draco´s fault that his parents failed –“
“You said it yourself Potter, I am
“I swear I noticed a smile on my mother´s lips before she remembered to hide it when she re-entered the room.”
Then, of course, there were the wizards who had come to take pleasure in Draco´s imprisonment. Draco gulped at the idea. Sure, he had not murdered anyone, but he had tortured people. Most of them had been when he was under the Imperius curse, but eventually, he had done it under the threat towards his mother´s life. That wasn´t a legit reason, however, so he knew that had it not been for Harry´s testimony, the Wizengamot would not even consider letting him off. He still had his doubts about what would happen; the only thing he knew was that he was about to find out any moment.
“Y-yyess… please…” Draco´s mind and body were killing him with desire.
“Harry. Please, call me Harry.” Harry blinked, “I need you to.” The hands were still caressing Draco´s thighs, but not doing anything inappropriate.
Harry hummed; this was heaven, being able to suck a huge cock while having the man of his dreams fucking him for the first time. The only reason he hadn´t come already was the damn agonizingly slow pace Draco set, clearly to tease him.
“Well, I hope for your sake that Harry will listen to your reason!” She crossed her arms over her chest before sitting back down.
Voldemort didn´t speak while he studied Potter for a minute or maybe less, then his wand dug into his own arm and he hissed. From the sound of it, Parseltongue. Draco´s arm burned and from the gasp his father emitted, so did his. Draco knew that the Mark was gone, but he didn´t care. He stared up at Potter instead.
“Not what mate? Tell us. Help us understand, or at least try.” Ron´s hand went through his hair, and Harry smiled inwardly at his best friends´ calmness about him coming out. He had expected, well, not this.
Which is why Harry had to do something about it, of course, whatever the cause.
Draco smirked at hearing Harry´s state of mind, “Your
“I-I… don´t… I… that it…”
Harry felt his body react immediately after those words reached his ears.
Ron´s mouth fell open as he glared at Harry who simply shrugged; he shut it again and scowled. “Good choice. Now, while the answer is correct, that Aguamenti conjures water, it does not control it Mr. Longbottom, but keep trying.” She turned to Malfoy after that. “Mr. Malfoy, you seemed to have an answer to offer?”
“Potter will be here after dinner,” the blond said in a hushed voice, even though he had already cast a Muffliato Charm. “He will come with me to our dorm. As for the others, we all know that Vince will not return until around midnight with us
Malfoy thought it over before answering. “When I win, you have to give me a blow job once a week for a month in the Slytherin dorm I share with the others, so my friends can watch you submit to me, just like any half-blood should.”
“TO WHAT? TO BE HONEST? TO TAKE RESPONSIBILTY FOR HIS OWN WORDS?” He yelled so spit landed everywhere on Draco´s face.
“Like me?” He asked.
“As of such, there is a new rule that I ask you all to uphold.” Her stern stare went across the students, most shuddered. “There will be no hexing when out of class in the hallways. You are allowed to practice in classrooms, naturally, or back in your dorms and common rooms. The war is over and those who should be punished for their crimes have been, so I will not have my students take vengeance on each other for whatever reason.” Her eyes lingered between Slytherin and Gryffindor the most when speaking those words.
“Don´t you dare call me a–“

Ron loosened his grip, but only a little. He then banged Malfoy´s skull into the wall. “You will go to him right now and make it better, you stupid fuck!”
“I´m a Malfoy, Potter. No Malfoy has ever bottomed, even if one was gay or bi, which I´m not.” His eyes closed when Harry began to nip his jaw suggestively.
Goldstein was still laughing when presenting the Ace of Hearts card and Seamus practically ran to the center of the room. “Yeah, let´s do this!” the Irish lad yelled excitedly. He grinned and waved to his mates. With the Two of Spades, Seamus picked out Susan Bones, who walked slowly, yet determinedly forward.
“Mr. Potter, it´s time to go back in.”
“So you´re… you´re…” Ron choked on the words he was trying to get out, though Harry knew what he was trying to ask him on Saturday afternoon.
Harry whimpered slightly.
“This is his room, you should just go in, he may be asleep still, but you can wake him up.” Luna offered a small smile before descending the stairs again to join her friends.
Draco choked on air. “I was speaking in general terms. Easy now, baby steps, alright?” He said once his voice was calm enough. “I already offered more than I ever did by having you move in. Blaise is the only one who has ever been inside my room before, even Pansy and Greg only visit our receiving wing –“
With his eyes closed and his mouth hanging slightly open, he mulled over his options. He knew he had a decision to make.
That´s the real reason why Harry jumped up and volunteered as the Challenger for Gryffindors, and it brought a massive cheer from his housemates when their card was drawn.
So, yes, Harry had to swallow his pride and offer Malfoy something else in return, whatever the Slytherin would demand of him for bailing on him. Unless it was illegal of course.
“I also had been the opportunity that others did not have. I could look into the mind of Voldemort himself.”
horrible, did it?
“Yeah, I didn´t think so, Potter. It´s all
Draco shivered as he waited for whatever punishment he was meant to receive because he knew it was coming. So did his parents, judging from his mother´s fidgeting and his father´s grey, stricken face.
Harry could tell he meant every word. He simply nodded, bit his lip and walked closer to Draco. A magical wall came up behind him when he was five steps from Draco. That had to have been for some kind of privacy. He noticed a privacy spell being cast too.
“Now-“
“I would replace my tongue with my fingers when you
“Hey, Malfoy,” he stopped in his tracks and turned around slowly gripping his wand as if expecting a curse. “You should get blown more often, looks good on you.” The insult that Harry had thrown Malfoy´s was ignored when the blond answered.
had meals every day! Meals
“Then, of course, your magic exploded all around you, without you having the faintest idea about it yourself.”
Harry's entire warm hand caressed Malfoy´s right cheek while the other held the Slytherin`s head. Harry leaned in capturing his lips and gently molded them to fit his own. His tongue wanted access and Malfoy automatically opened his mouth to allow it.
Which he could not allow.
“The Aguamenti spell,” he stated confidently. That earned him a snort from Draco Malfoy, who sat behind him in class, Neville turned around to flip him the finger outside the watch of the stern eye of their professor; several students laughed at Longbottom’s confidence. So much seemed to have changed after the war, although Malfoy was acting as nothing had changed at all.
“Mr. Potter, this is a most impressive speech and one I would not have expected from you. We already know that you have stated in a written report that Mr. Malfoy saved your life when you were captured at the Mansion, but why did you turn up here, too?”
“He is compassionate; I saw him saving people last year and then Obliviating them so they could not remember it. That is not very Slytherin of him; any Slytherin would want to gloat. He is brave; I witnessed his refusal to do Voldemort´s biding more than once earning himself a round of torture. He is smart; who else would figure out a way to sneak in the Death Eaters even though that act itself does speak against him. He is someone I should not have turned down any form of friendship with. During the past year, I must admit that he has grown on me. I no longer hate him, which I think I never really did in the first place.”
I can´t. A Malfoy can marry and have heirs and then have his urges on the side, but it can only succeed without love, because how can a man be married to someone, even if it is an arranged marriage like most pure-bloods are, and then love someone else? He can´t Harry, don´t you see? I would drive him insane, and he wouldn´t be able to be the perfect pure-blood, I just can´t, Harry.”
Until then, consider this the last chapter.
, why don´t we up the game with Potter?”
“And how
Draco pulled Harry on top of him and snogged him while Seamus finished dressing. Before leaving the room, he stopped to grin at the two.
Draco then leaned in and whispered into Harry´s ears, and Harry yelped in surprise.
Malfoy saved his life at the Manor, he had to repay the favour.
“Fuck…” Greg cursed and erupted all over his hand. Harry hummed when noticing the dark-haired male casting a cleaning spell.
Harry hesitated, took a deep breath and drew one. He grinned.
“Really?” You could see Vince´s brain trying to think of a proper Slytherin excuse to go rob the kitchens, but Blaise didn´t have the patience to wait it out today.
Harry walked to the front of the lines of chairs, no longer trusting his own legs to carry him to the back again. The empty chair seemed to swallow him whole, and he thought he would die until he met Malfoy´s eyes.
“You followed me around a whole damn year.” He kissed a trail from the nipple towards Harry´s face and stopped when they shared the same air. “Is that when it began?” he whispered.
“Of course it is; it´s bloody brilliant,” Kevin Entwhistle exclaimed. “Let´s get to inviting the others. I´ll round up the Gryffindor boys.” He went to get started.
Harry felt his nipple being pinched, then twisted lightly.
“Don´t say shit like that, Potter,” Draco spat, and fought within himself for the strength to push him away, but lost the battle. “It can´t… we can´t…”
Hey lovely readers.
“GOD, you need to be careful Har, I´ll blow soon…”
“Greg,
didn´t have to cook for your family, and god help you if you ever complained or asked a damn question…” Harry yelled, then stopped when he realized his mistake.
Harry shivered, which did not go unnoticed by his friend, who had been silently studying him. “He seems changed, from before I mean.” Hermione wasn´t giving up just yet, it was her duty as Harry´s best friend, along with Ron, who was so not talking about Malfoy with Harry, not about
“Or what, Potter? Are you going to hex me? Go on then, give me your best shot. Let´s see, yet again, how everyone will support the Savior of our world, by letting him do whatever the hell he pleases, like fucking always!” Malfoy sneered angrily.
, but he was not about to tell his friends that. That would mean he had to come clean. To confess about the thoughts he had been having. Not to mention the dream he woke up from last night. The dream that made him come in his sleep; something he had never experienced before, ever.
want you.”
Harry moaned to himself when he felt Malfoy tugging his hair. It felt so bloody good he almost let the Slytherins hear his approval. His own dick was now paying attention to what was happening, and as soon as Harry´s pink tongue tasted Malfoy´s pre-cum Harry was rock hard already.
“If what???” He blurted out eagerly.
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
have an excuse since they had been busy.
This is the last chapter.
“I don´t… why would…. I´m…” Harry had no idea when he would wake up from this particular dream, it was very confusing. He really did want Malfoy to snog him, maybe he would just wait a few minutes before ending the dream.
Harry bowed his head. “I don´t want anyone else, Draco. Your hands belong on my body, it feels
“I thought…” He bit his lip nervously. “I didn´t want you to think I was boring, and so, when you asked me to… I just figured you wou-“
Sure, it wasn´t Malfoy´s hand that cast the killing curses at his friends and family, but he had let
His palms were sweating.
“Now, why would I do that,
“I will, from you.” Harry frowned and growled in the back of his throat when Malfoy left him, still laughing.

“No, Malfoy. Call your mother and tell her we´re going, now…” He placed his hands into his pockets for something to do. “You know bloody well that you can find a surrogate mother to your future heir.”
Warm breath reached the corner of his mouth and Harry let out a gasp.
Harry was finally biting his lip and nodding, Draco was still rubbing against his special spot. Draco slowly removed the fingers and Seamus´s eyes widened when Harry turned and kneeled on all four on the bed. He now had the perfect view of two heavenly, gorgeous males; his cock was throbbing for release. Draco lined himself up and began pushing inside and Seamus had to close his eyes for a moment to steady himself.
“Mr. Potter, this is a most impressive speech and one I would not have expected from you. We already know that you have stated in a written report that Mr. Malfoy saved your life when you were captured at the Mansion, but why did you turn up here, too?” The older man spoke again.
“Crucio.”
, naked men; one his friend and the other a foe. Harry lay between Malfoy´s legs sucking him off. Scratch that, he was
“And when you get bored with me? Do you really want me or is this simply another adventure for you? And the Malfoy bloodline?”
Harry straightened his back and cast a refreshing charm before leaving the house to go to the courtroom, in which he knew Draco Malfoy´s trial was to be held in half an hour.
“Come for me, Harry,” the other whispered and sucked harder. Harry´s dick exploded and every last drop of evidence was gone by the time Harry was capable of opening his eyes and meeting the brown orbs of the male who had offered him his first gay blowjob. Goyle smirked but didn´t stop licking Harry´s dick as he came down from his high, obviously prolonging his orgasm.
That was for the other houses; not Slytherins.
The light side protested while the dark side was curious.
Harry sat down on a nearby table and waited for Malfoy to do something, but he just stood there with his back to Harry as if ignoring Harry would make the Gryffindor go away. Which seemed quite dumb considering that Goyle was blocking the only exit. Harry cleared his throat before speaking up more than five minutes after Goyle had left them to themselves. “I didn´t even know I would ever find your arse appealing until I first tasted your cum.”
Hands cupped Draco´s handsome face. “I was attracted to you from second year, I just never wanted to admit to it, because you were such a mean git.” Draco tried to pull away just then, but Harry´s grip tightened and the other came up attempting to escape his grasp. “A gorgeous and sexy git, but still a git…”
, and Pansy and Theo will most likely be spending the night in whatever room they have found like they always do.” He leaned forward
“Come off it, Malfoy, I heard you. You were bloody moaning when I sucked you. You stopped me because you were going to burst!”
Harry brought forth his bravery from somewhere deep within. “Ready to lose every last point, Goyle?” Later though, he admitted he probably should not have asked that particular question out loud. The Slytherin sat down beside Harry, his smirk never wider than this moment. Harry knew what was coming when the larger male brought his entire weight behind his body and tilted the couch so Harry and he fell backwards and the furniture stayed upturned, hiding the two males from everybody´s view.
“I´m sure mother won´t mind – she´s always telling me how the house is too quiet. Plus, she nearly plotted with Weasley to bring me here to see you…” Harry blinked. “She was less than pleased with my behaviour.” He looked away so that Harry wouldn´t notice the small pink spots on his cheeks, but he noticed them.
Suddenly the room was vivid with confusion; apparently the scoreboards had changed in favour of Gryffindor house. Goyle´s husky voice brought Harry back to reality again. “Come find me if you want more.” And with that, he was alone behind the tilted couch, recovering from the most exhilarating orgasm of his life.
“The only reason you´re free to attend to anything but Azkaban is that of me and my testimony, Malfoy!” Harry snapped without meaning to, but the blond always had a knack for getting Harry´s blood to boil.
“If he didn´t like it, then why did he get hard from it, right? It´s not like if you two kissed for a dare that you´d get a boner, unless you were really enjoying it, so it´s just… I don´t understand. He told me he wasn´t into dudes, yet he said I could kiss him when I asked permission. Why the fuck would he do that if not…”
“That´s far enough,” Harry´s confident voice sounded and Draco froze to the spot in the middle of the room. “Turn around and get the fuck out, Malfoy. I don´t know how you got here and I don´t give a flying fuck why, just leave!”
want you, but – what about my bloodline, I´m…” He sighed.
“STOP,” Ron yelled an inch before the hand groped his cock, and he stood and shook his body with disgust. “Oh
Harry shrugged. “Well, it´s not like I knew anything else that
“He clearly changed, Ron, or else Harry wouldn´t have…” She was hoping that Harry would reassure her.
Draco grinned as he continued to thrust, and then he spoke. “You heard the man, Finnegan. Why don´t you make yourself useful and suck Harry off, instead of just standing there ogling us?”
gorgeous.”
Harry heard Draco moving. He listened closer and realized that he was making his way towards the bed. His heart racing suddenly, his throat dried out. Harry knew Draco didn´t have a wand, but other than that, he wasn´t sure what to expect from him.
Harry laughed and reached forward to cup Malfoy´s balls, gently rolling them in his hand. No sense getting his teeth kicked out by Malfoy by being rough with him. Malfoy drew in a deep breath and looked away from Harry again. Harry didn´t mind, he would get a reaction sooner or later.
“Draco Malfoy first reached out the hand of friendship the day before our first year at Hogwarts, when we met at Madam Malkin´s Robes for all occasions. I was a lonely, miserable boy, who had never known friendship, and who had been bullied my entire life by my own family. And Draco seemed like just another bully to me when he went on and on about the purity of blood. So, naturally, I declined any sort of friendship he was offering to me.”
was the heir, and he couldn´t marry a man. And of course he didn´t want to do that.
Malfoy had something Harry no longer had; a family to care for. He should at least be able to keep that.
It was Friday night at eight and even though every year below 8th year had curfews at nine, the 8th years were free to stay up if they wanted; they were all of age anyway so it called for special circumstances. They were in the new and improved Room of Requirement on the 7th floor and Goldstein looked around. “Right, thank you all for coming here tonight. I had this idea when the Headmistress took away our privilege to duel with each other, and we all know we need
Harry nodded, smiled and ran his finger gently across Draco´s lips. “You´re gorgeous.”
“Eager much?” Goyle asked, staring down at Harry who had to look away while answering.
Goyle muttered something and Harry felt his shirt being ripped apart causing him to yelp. Harry stood there frozen while the Slytherin ran his huge hands over his naked chest and lower
Harry sucked in a breath.
The two Aurors went to stand by the door. “You´re the last one Mr. Potter, so take your time,” the younger one said with a warm smile. “You´re a hero, after all, that should get you something extra.”
Harry ran, he had no idea where he was going or why he was trying to find Malfoy.
Something inside the blond clicked when hearing his first name from Harry´s lips. “Just one.”
“Yes it does.” He kissed Harry´s jawline. “
"My Lord.”
? Draco winced. He knew, that should he ever sleep with Potter he would not be able to escape again. Not because it would be brilliant sex, surely it couldn´t, since none of them had had a male before, but because of those damn
Ron laughed. “Well, I threw his mum out of the room. That is to say, she kind of looked like she was grateful for having me there.” He took a swipe of his drink. “Then I grabbed the tosser and threw him against the wall while we talked.”
“It´s a Black house; it needs some work.” Draco snorted. “
“YES!” Draco shouted, and the door slowly opened and closed again. It was still dark, but they had pulled apart the curtains slightly, so the moonlight shone gently in and parted the darkness of the room.
“Can´t it wait, I want to bugger you,” Harry whined. He ignored Draco´s widened eyes and stiffness of body, which had nothing to do with the bulge down south. “You don´t want that?”
eating, Greg had noticed, he was merely poking the food and pushing it around and then raising his fork every now and then to his mouth to chew and swallow what little he had managed to capture with it. In the end, it may have looked like he ate the same amount as always - if you weren´t paying attention, or weren´t a close friend of the blond.
Harry let him go and Malfoy put his clothes back in order before speaking. “Your arse is mine come Friday, Potter, I´ll make you lose every last point your house has got.”
Harry was about to die, so he would bloody die acknowledging the truth. Even when Malfoy was as straight as they came.
Malfoy stepped closer clearly mesmerized by Harry´s admission, so he kept talking. “You´re gorgeous, and smart, and sexy, who
yes, I love your noises, Harry,“ he placed another kiss and shoved his groin into Harry´s clothed arse to prove his point.
I were into men.” He huffed and stood up taller.
“Girls do that?” He asked in deep wonder over his Godfather’s appeal.
“You´re not the only one hurting, you know.”
What the hell was wrong with him? Was Malfoy´s spunk turning him into a madman, or maybe it had the power to make men appealing to him?
“You’re on, Potter. Now, get on your knees where you belong, half-blood.”
Then it stopped.
was just perfect. “Please…” Harry´s whole body shook. “Gonna come…”
“Special necessities have been made to make sure any student who disobeys this rule will be caught and punished. It does not matter if the hex is a Bat Bogey or the Cruciatus curse; there will be no hexes.” She cleared her throat when the students began to protest.
“S-s-sorry… just… you… went out and… and I did… the opposite… cos…”
“Which is, of course, ridiculous since I, too, use a loo.”
“My uncle burned all the prior ones, because he hated magic and me. So, Dumbledore sent Hagrid, yes. What do your care,
“You better fucking do all of those things Malfoy… you promise?”
See you out there!
Draco wasn´t given the task to get the Death Eaters into Hogwarts in my story, only the task of killing the headmaster.
Harry hummed before Draco released him to draw in some air. He coughed and Draco grabbed his face and began fucking his mouth again.
“It´s a Muggle game called ´I dare you to stop me.´ I have here a Muggle deck of playing cards with the numbers 1 until 3 in all four colors. Hufflepuffs will be Clubs, Ravenclaws Spades, Gryffindors Hearts, and Slytherin Diamonds. If you look at the back, you will see a board with the correct descriptions and the tally telling us which house has the most points at all times. There are spells on it to prevent cheating, of course.”
Theo and Draco are best friends!
She smiled and leaned in to kiss him.
“Who cares, we won.” Goyle shrugged and went to join the Slytherin table once more. He high fived Blaise when the board changed scores.
“Settle down everyone,” Professor Malfoy said in a calm voice. It never ceased to amaze Harry that it was possible to get an entire Potions class to stop talking without a deathly stare or a yell; he had been so used to Snape doing that. “Today, we shall continue in the footsteps of our last lesson, since only one of you managed to make the proper potion.” His grey eyes rested on Hermione, who beamed.
Potter was humming loudly enough for all the other three to hear. Merlin, if they could share one thought at the exact moment, if would be;
a Malfoy after all.
He huffed and drew in a portion of much needed air to calm him into remembering he was a
When Draco finally pulled away, he was panting. “I went out and practised, for god´s sake Harry. So that I wouldn´t look like a bloody moron if I ever got the chance to be with you. Girls are easy to a Malfoy, we learn from a young age how to act, and pleasure a woman.” Harry snorted. “Yes, absurd, but that´s the reality of it.”
Harry blinked and before his mind would say crazy shit again, he had to do something to stop that, he leaned down and offered the pretty prick a warm house to stay in. “Fucking hell, Potter, you bastard…” Harry hummed around the dick in his mouth.
“I may not understand what just took place Harry, none of us did.” He glanced around to the others - “But whatever it is, you just got Draco Malfoy to tell you he loves you in public. He never shows any form of affection in front of anyone towards another human being, not even his own parents, which in my book means that you of all people are entitled to see him.”
Potter had his eyes closed while he took Malfoy´s cock down his throat and swallowed. “Shiit,” Malfoy cursed, causing Potter to moan and the vibrations made Malfoy´s legs almost cave under him.
Harry didn´t answer. He couldn´t, he was too damn busy thinking over what he had possibly done wrong with Malfoy. He had been honest with him. Then why did Malfoy freak out on him? He had checked his breath too - it was minty - so that wasn´t what chased the blond away so abruptly. He had asked before kissing him, hadn´t he? So that had been the polite way to go about it. Most just kissed and paid the consequences afterwards.
“... for being you…” Everything else Draco wanted to say to him meant nothing right now; he couldn´t explain anything. The war had ended, he faced life in prison and Harry loved him.
The three Slytherins were mesmerized by what Potter was doing now. My god, surely Potter could not be
“Really Potter, you´re drooling…”
Harry couldn´t resist him even if he tried. He gagged when he took Draco´s entire cock into his mouth, causing Draco to hiss in pleasure and thrust hard, making Harry gag even more.
There were appearently
When the class ended shortly thereafter only a handful of students had learned the spell, though everyone was busy talking about what had happened today. It was as if the world had ended for Ron, he couldn´t
got a girlfriend he would be sure to find someone not so prone to nagging. Although, Harry was not at all certain that he would be interested in a female anytime soon. Not with that git Malfoy lurking around inside his head all the bloody time; even at night in his dreams. Surely, it was some kind of teenage identity crisis situation? Harry swallowed his bacon and automatically let his eyes wander to the Slytherin table.
“Mother- “
“If you are here to say something stupid, then get out, I´m sleeping.” Harry put down his wand on the small table beside his bed and fell back down onto the bed on his stomach, head turned away from Draco, facing the window.
“Don´t waste your tears on a Malfoy, Potter, we are not worth the effort.” He used his thumb to wipe away some of the tears on Harry´s cheek.
They were both sitting casually on the same bed against the headboard the owner of the bed had conjured.
to lead a certain life. I am the only child to the Malfoy bloodline. I have to take a wife to keep the bloodline going, you must understand that.”
“Weasley, what do you want!?” He roared, but his mother reminded him of the politeness a true Malfoy had to contain.
If Draco hadn´t been a Slytherin and a Malfoy at the same time, that remark would have made him freeze his movements, but instead he went ahead and poured the syrup over it, folded it and began cutting it into bits. “I like pancakes.”
“I´ll know I Obliviated you correctly,” he said. Seamus froze in the middle of pulling up his pants. “A joke Finnegan… it was a bloody joke…”
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a voice rang out, cutting off Voldemort´s; obviously. It travelled with the use of a Sonorus, making it impossible to make out from where it came. “Then how about a trade with Harry Potter?”
Tomorrow was Sunday, and the day he was going to Malfoy again. He was dreading it. After what he and Goyle did together, it was bound to be awkward, at the very least. He kept walking until he heard moaning on the third floor and stopped in his tracks. He saw Zabini snogging some sixth year pureblood Ravenclaw.
“Ronald!” Hermione scolded, but the three males cheered in approval. “So, you forced him to come here? Have you even considered what that would do to Harry once he finds out?” Judging from the frown that appeared on Ron´s forehead he had not.
Not that Harry could concentrate, with Goyle sliding down his body now and then, right at the moment when Goldstein went to take another peek at the two of them, Harry´s cock was engulfed in pure blissful hot-lava-mouthed pleasure.
Nothing he did could take away the pain he was feeling inside. The war had ended a month ago and people had died. His friends, his classmates, Order members, strangers, enemies; nobody had been safe from the killing curse.
“Sooo, Harry…” She began as she turned to face her childhood friend and smiled. “Has something been bothering you lately?” she tried.
he wants! He was practically undressing you during potions yesterday. And Wednesday he looked like he was going to kiss you at lunch.” He messed up his hair a bit before continuing. “He´s the catch of a lifetime, and he clearly doesn´t care about your past or else he wouldn´t hunt you down so openly. He´s moved on, Dray, you should, too.”
Harry leaned closer and noticed Malfoy stiffen his body but those who were merely watching them would not have noticed. “Are you ready, Malfoy?” Harry whispered and almost heard the Malfoy´s strong heartbeat.
Draco kissed him.
“Yeah, I´m – … urgh?” Goyle was now straddling Harry and sitting straight across his dick. Goyle´s face was hovering right over Harry´s right ear.
Of course, Hermione had already been accepted to start working in the Magical Creature Department at the Ministry, Ron and Harry would be starting Auror training together with Dean and Seamus, and Neville would be studying under a legend in Herbology who only took in students every tenth year or so. None of them had any plans to leave Grimmauld Place in the near future, and Harry was glad to have the company, but they had all insisted on paying rent while they lived there. Well, Ron was still grumpy about it of course, even with the huge amount of Galleons they had received from the Ministry for ´Heroic and cunning efforts.´
Sweet Merlin, there were tears on his father´s face. Draco closed his eyes and kept breathing.
The whispers were there again but subsided again on their own.
“Sweet Circe… so fuckin´ good… I can´t last must longer Malfoy…” He admitted.
“He loves you. Not that any of his friends can understand that, mind you, but he´s my best mate, and if he claims to love you of all people, then …” He took a deep breath. “I will have to live with that, Malfoy.”
Harry´s hands were now moving to remove Draco´s shirt. He fumbled with the buttons but ended up tearing it apart instead. Draco growled in response.
“Greg,” Malfoy said. And as if practised, the tall dark-haired male stood and fetched a bottle of fire whisky and four glasses and poured four drinks. “Blaise,” Malfoy nodded and the student locked and silenced the room with his wand and a smirk. Malfoy faced Harry once more. “Scared, Potter?”
“My Lord, please,” his father begged. And for that reason, Draco knew that he was about to die because nothing else could ever make any Malfoy beg. “He´s just a child…”
“We have some considerable changes to the teaching staff this year. Most of you know the professors, however, for the benefit of the first years, I will introduce every professor in turn.” She waited for the silence to restore itself once more. “The returning professors include Aurora Sinistra who teaches Astronomy.” The dark-skinned younger professor waved.
Malfoy thrust his wand out his sleeve within a second and pressed it against Harry´s masculine neck. “Don´t you fucking dare say that again, Potter. If I hear one word of that shit about around the hallways, I´ll hunt you down and-”
He stretched. “I´m gonna hit the showers, mate, Mione. My muscles are killing me after today´s Dark Arts lesson.” He stood and heard Hermione´s response.
why you told Potter to not come to his arranged punishment last Sunday, is it?” Draco looked away and concentrated on his meal, he unceremoniously reached out for another pancake. “And you only ever eat
Murmurs began rising but Goldstein tried to silence them. “What do you mean when you say physical bravery?” The question came from Hermione Granger and everyone stilled.
Draco was finding it increasingly difficult to breathe, and this time it wasn´t because of a curse. Potter loved him?
That seemed to pull Draco out of whatever mental pause that had occupied his mind. He met Greg´s stare, “I don´t know to what you´re referring.”
“Stop it! You cannot force someone to…”
“Enough! I will not have this conversation again, it´s-”
Harry grabbed Draco into a fierce kiss. “I fucking love you, so much…”
Harry stared blankly at Draco for some time; he was so near him that Harry had to blink to keep his focus in place.
“N-no… I want… to suck…” Harry panted, aroused. “Please Seam… come here…”
Draco exhaled loudly. “Weasley came to my house.” He shifted on the spot.
It was a cold from deep within that, eventually, with time and years to come, would spread throughout the rest of his body. He would become his worst fear; his own father´s spitting image.
The two males stepped up beside Draco and led him through the large iron door in the very back of the room. As the door slammed shut, sparks let them know that the wards were up.
It worked, too, because the Slytherin came to a halt, sneering and going for his wand. Harry was too quick for him, and he grabbed hold of Malfoy´s right wrist. He winced as Harry pulled, which resulted in Malfoy being chest to chest with Harry for a brief moment, before the blond stepped away to get some personal space, only to meet the stone wall.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Hello Draco,” Luna´s dreamy sweet voice said as if she wanted a proper introduction.
“There´s nothing
“Even when realizing you were about to die, you went to find the bastard. You brave fuck, never caring what or who you left behind when they saw your dead body in the arms of the half giant.”
“I can´t do that.” He got up on his knees in front of Draco. Those hands landed on Draco´s thighs casually stroking, as if they wanted to comfort him. Damn it, if it wasn´t working too. “I love you.”
for god´s sake, Harry.” He closed his eyes in realization of his own stupid mistake; he had forced Harry to agree to something he didn´t really want, and on their first time, too. “I just wanted to show you that I would do anything for you, to give you ultimate pleasure. That I could be anything but what the public eye makes me out to be, that I could be unselfish.”
With that, Lucius Malfoy in all his glory and free-of-Azkaban-because-of-Harry´s-testimony glided in between the Slytherin and Gryffindor tables, meeting two sets of eyes. One he smiled proudly at; his son who smirked and accepted the congratulations from his housemates. The other, Harry Potter, to whom he nodded curtly, and Harry nodded back. They had agreed on a truce, ever since Harry had witnessed on the elder Malfoy`s behalf and Lucius had thanked him in private and offered Harry an open invitation to the Manor, should he so wish, and any favor he could possibly want.
Breathing was making him insane.
Harry leaned down before Malfoy could move and throw him off. “Say please,” and he ground down on the aching dick once more.
“Me too, mother.”
“Get out of my face, Pothead,” Malfoy spat as he rounded another corner, clearly trying to escape.
“I love you too, Harry.”
She gave him the warning look before he added a ´Professor,´ and the Slytherins snickered when watching the redhead cower before his own mother. “Mr. Weasley, last time I checked this was my class to teach. Now, you can either sit back and let me by accepting my punishment or remove yourself from this classroom.”
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron nodded to Mrs. Malfoy and went to her, Draco watching them with his eyes narrowed. “Mrs. Malfoy, you might want to leave the room while I chat with your son.” He handed over his wand to her without hesitation. “Take this, so I don´t murder him!”
His cum went everywhere. Harry managed to catch about a quarter of it and swallow it.
“Well, you wouldn´t be the one doing most of it at first, not really.” Harry´s finger ran down Malfoy´s cheek and over the masculine jaw.
Draco knew it was not the end; that had been too easy.
Even though his father was still very much alive, Draco was now the head of the Malfoy family, since Lucius would never be free from Azkaban again. His mother had received the papers yesterday at the Manor for Draco to sign and return to the Ministry, the quicker the better, but Draco had not signed them yet.
Harry didn´t realize that Goyle had sat back to make room for his friend and that he had come all over Malfoy´s clothes without someone touching him, until the blond pulled away and gasped and they both looked down.
Draco grinned, panting. He reached out and caressed Harry´s chest. “I love you too…”

be gay.”
to turn around to face the Gryffindor now.
“Again, he tried to befriend me when we arrived at Hogwarts, but unfortunately for him, he did so while ridiculing my first friend, whom I met on the train; Ronald Weasley.”
“Get your arse up here, Weasley. Unless you give up beforehand?” Goyle challenged the redhead, who looked redder in the face than his hair by now. Ron rose to the challenge, not knowing how he managed to get his feet to carry him to the couch, but they did, and he took a seat.
this further.”
Harry stopped his attention on Malfoy´s prick and instead inserted a second finger. Malfoy hissed from the intrusion. “Sweet Merlin,” both Zabini and Goyle swore under their breath when watching Draco writhing under Potter and letting the Gryffindor finger him for the first time, ever. A Malfoy being submissive, that was unheard of, but it was damn sexy to witness.
“Oh, but he is. You see, I never knew if people wanted me for my fame or my dashing personality, so we´re the same really, ´cos you never knew if people wanted you for your money or your… well, maybe it would be your looks and not your –“
“And now?” Harry tried to get the conversation back on track casually. Malfoy´s eyes bored holes in Harry´s own from the intensity of his stare. Harry waited.
“But it is. Draco don´t you see. We´re perfect together.” Potter went on before Draco could interrupt. “We will never get bored with each other. We will always share our interest in Quidditch, and our tempers are sure to collide often enough.” He licked his lips and Draco was forced to follow the pink tongue´s trail. “When we kiss, it´s like the world stops. I forget to breathe and my body tingles all over. And afterwards, I feel connected with you in a way I haven´t felt with anyone before.”
Malfoy froze. “I told you, Greg…”

“Shiiit,” Harry groaned, but Goyle knew how to suck cock. Harry never wanted him to stop doing that. The tongue in the slit felt amazing. Goyle hummed.
“Because throughout the last year I have gotten to know the real Draco Malfoy, both by following him around, but also through Voldemort´s mind. I have come to see that he is not only a stubborn, proud, arrogant bastard... well, I will not deny that he is all of those things.”
Draco took Weasley´s hand and found himself standing on his feet once more.
remember that particular trait of being a Slytherin.
“It will be when I marry.” He stood taller, “Along with a fortune.”
“Merlin yes, they were persistent today, weren´t they?” Blaise hid a yawn behind his dark-skinned hand. Draco merely nodded in agreement.
“Yes, nothing can be less than perfect for the great Harry Potter.” Harry noticed that there was no mocking in that sentence.
“Oh. Alright, catch you later then, huh?” Vince said, standing to leave.
Draco stepped closer and closer.
“It´s Potter you want to bugger not me.” And that caused the blond to choke on his food, so Greg had to pound his back twice before the piece of pancake went down Draco´s throat. “I rest my case.” He smirked at Draco.
“Well, Mione sort of… we talked, you know… and then we…” Ron tried.
Draco´s legs almost gave in when he let go and his semen filled Harry's mouth. He bit his tongue when he saw him swallow and dropped to his knees.
“I saw many things through his eyes. Things and actions that changed my mind about many people during that year. I saw brave people not giving in while Voldemort tortured them, and eventually killed them because he found them useless. I saw cowards turning their own family in to survive themselves. I saw Death Eaters who did his bidding. I felt what they felt as they did what he told them to.”
Malfoy had been furious when his father had rewarded Hermione 20 points for her potion; and he himself had not even finished it in time. Harry had laughed so hard afterwards at that with his friends back in their common room.
She played with the hem of her shirt; she was never nervous talking to her friend, but this was sort of an uncharted territory. “You´ve been acting…
“To get me to feel sorry for you, of course,” Malfoy countered lamely.
Malfoy unzipped his trousers and let them drop to the floor and stepped out of them, he was not wearing anything underneath and Harry could only stare at the pale locks and the limp dick meeting him. Harry hadn´t seen Malfoy stepping closer before a whisper close to his left ear woke up his brain again, “Get on your knees, Potter.”
“I promise.”
Harry opened his eyes and dropped to his knees. “Look at me…”
Potter, please don´t make this harder than it is.” He cupped Harry´s face between both his hands. “Whatever I feel does not change anything. I´m a Malfoy, I have to-“
“I already know the way, so why don´t we just meet there?” Harry interrupted Malfoy. So, maybe he lost the bet, but like hell he was going pass up an opportunity to shock Malfoy. Harry enjoyed the stupid look of pure disbelief on Malfoy´s face that anyone from another house could possibly have such knowledge.
“I can´t.” He bit his cheek. “If I go and this is the last time I…”
Gryffindor was so going to win at the end of this year, Harry would make sure of it, even if it was the last thing he would do, and if Malfoy went down in the middle of it all, that would be an added bonus .
“Harry… are you…” Hermione gave Ron a silent pleading look over Harry´s head from their seating arrangement on the couch in front of the fire in the deserted Gryffindor common room. Ron shrugged in understanding and cleared his throat awkwardly.
“Mr. Potter?” a female voice said.
Harry, being best friends of a know-it-all, had made sure to study the male anatomy for the past two days. There was no way he was making a fool out of himself in front of a bunch of Slytherins, which had clearly been their plan, or at least it was Malfoy´s.
“You fucking BASTARD!” Ron grabbed Draco´s collar and pulled him up from his comfortable chair and threw him against the wall. “How dare you do that to Harry, he fucking loves you, you cold-hearted motherfucker, you stupid fucking… FUCKHOLE!”
“I had a terrible childhood, yes. I was starved, beaten, ridiculed, but mostly I was left to myself. I, too, was lonely for many years, but I once I entered Hogwarts I had friends everywhere. People who wanted to know me, to do things for me, and to act on my behalf, merely because I was famous. True, I found real friends too, and I didn´t need money or threats to achieve that. They wanted me for me, the real me, not the famous me, and for that I am grateful.”
Harry heard Malfoy draw in a deep undignified gasp of air when his hand had groped his groin. “I was right: tiny.” Harry grinned, and his housemates went crazy, Seamus almost fell over from laughing so hard.
McGonagall looked pleased with what she was about to say. “Now, onto the new staff members. I have the honor of presenting one of my own former house members and an Order member, nonetheless.” The excited voices began talking louder and louder and eyes were searching around the Hall to find that special someone. Several even glanced at Harry as if he would be the new professor. Harry shook his head at that. “Our Care of Magical Creatures professor is Charlie Weasley.” Ron`s brother entered the Hall then to cheers and howls, even some of the Slytherins clapped. Ron sent his brother a scowl, he had not told him anything about this, and judging from the identical scowl on Ginny`s face, she didn`t know either. It didn`t take long before they both grinned: their brother was a professor.
But one did not speak those words and lived to tell about it. And Draco didn´t want to die. Even less, he didn´t want his mother to die. His father was the one that had gotten them into this situation in the first place, so Draco wasn´t too sure, that he would
to be happy… Do you really want a life without love… without Harry?”
“Merlin´s balls,” Harry panted silently. Only Goyle could hear him. Harry´s hips bucked into the heat he was offered, causing Goyle to growl in approval.
Numerous people laughed at this.
” Harry´s hand pulled the blonde hair but Draco shoved it away instantly.
when you´re upset.”
Draco rolled his eyes when Harry made no sign of any response to his statement. “I-I... I didn´t lie to you either.”
“Uh…”
you… no one´s ever…” Draco closed his eyes as Harry leaned closer to lick his lips gently, his hand running over the hard bulge between them.
Sitting down was making him insane.
“Mm, but you love me like that…”
His feet followed her automatically through the hall. He swallowed when the door opened and he caught Draco´s eyes. He took a step inside so the door could close behind him.
“Harry?” Ron called when they heard him stomp upstairs.
This would be one life over three – and Harry had to die anyway since he was a bloody Horcrux. Ron and Hermione would finish Voldemort off when he was gone. This would be his last chance to save someone.
“Look Malfoy, just…please don´t do this. Harry´s like my brother and if you break his heart… he won´t ever get over that…”
“In our sixth year, I discovered by accident that Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater, and even my friends believed that I was delusional at first. So, I decided to follow him around everywhere he went. I did that for an entire year.”
“I know that, Dray. But you´re usually too concerned about your physique to chance gaining weight. Personally, I think that´s stupid. You´re fucking gorgeous, and even if you ate pancakes every bloody morning you wouldn´t get fat. Not with all the flying you do.”
“Fuck yeah, Harry, you show that Slytherin scum who´s the man!” Dean and Seamus both shouted in encouragement and Harry gave them a grin before opening Malfoy´s pants, making sure the others wouldn´t be able to see Malfoy´s disgusting prick.
Well, Harry had to admit, most of the times his friend
“It´s going to cost you a lot of blows and sex to convince me otherwise, Potter-“
Malfoy´s eyes widened. “You…” Harry nodded. “I didn´t think that… Greg has always said… I´m not gay, Potter, I never…”
“Draco Malfoy was forced into doing things. Things nobody could ever come close to comprehending when they have never had Voldemort living under their roof. When they have never had an insane father figure who worshiped Voldemort - a man who pushed proudly to make his only son like him. They would never know the feeling of constant fear, of pressure to perform and to wear the perfect mask covering up just how you really feel. They would never know what it is to be lonely and afraid.”
Harry whimpered when Draco let him go and flipped them over so he was on top of him. Holy Merlin, Malfoy´s arse was hot. Seamus nearly stepped closer to touch it, but instead, he began rubbing his member through his pants. Draco spread his legs wider so Seamus had access to a view of his puckered hole; he had to bite down to not whimper out loud at the sight. The first finger entered Harry´s body and the horny moan that escaped his mouth almost tipped Seamus over.
Harry frowned. “We´re alone here Draco, there is no need to-“
make sure to break as little as possible, I shall return later.” And with those simple words, she stood gracefully and exited the room, leaving a shocked Draco alone with an angry-as-hell looking Ronald Weasley.
It dawned on Ron. “You don´t love him back… you… you … arsehole! You just said it back to get the fuck out of prison… I´m gonna kill you, right fucking now MALFOY!”
“I´m in love with you.”
“Heads for Hufflepuff girls,” Mandy Brocklehurst beamed.
Ron?” Neville asked in awe.
“Greg, what the hell?” Malfoy winced, clearly feeling awkward witnessing this.
together.” He leant over to kiss Draco softly. “I swear, I will treat you like I did in school, but replace the hate with love instead.” He winked.
Draco growled with need as he shoved the second digit inside Harry´s tightness, Harry clawed his shoulders in pleasure when Draco hit his prostate.
be long with the way Harry drove his body closer to madness.
“Chill out mate, it was only a bit of fun.” Ron tried to smooth out his obvious mistake.

be possible for some males to be pregnant and carry a child to term. So he couldn´t play the `I have to provide an heir´ card.
Draco´s eyes flew open when his mother pleaded.
Another pause.
Draco´s heart was pounding away inside his chest. He wondered when it would pop out from his body entirely; it
Draco had heard that sound many times over the past year. “Noooooooooooo!” Everyone watched as Harry´s chosen rival leapt into the air and fell down on the ground a few meters further away, cradling Harry´s dead body, shaking it while sobbing openly. “Don´t you dare! Move, fucking
“Mmmm, you want me to suck you? Hm? Like this?” And Harry sucked on the head, hard. Malfoy growled, cursed and screamed. Harry pumped the cock and licked the underside and Malfoy practically exploded.
“I´ll be gentle taking you for the first time because I know how
Another silence filled the dark room.
“YES…” Harry was already so close Draco could feel him shaking in his arms.

with you. That´s the way it has always been, and how it will always be.” Malfoy made sure his clothes were in order before speaking up again: “Even if I was gay, or bi, I would not lower myself to your kind.”
being mean; caressing Malfoy´s soft spot repeatedly.
Malfoy sneered before Harry spoke again. “Of course, there is a third possibility.” He grinned.
“Is all I need,” Harry finished before freeing the cock and again the room went crazy. Even though they could see nothing they knew what was happening.
Draco simply kept on staring at Harry dumbly while Harry waited patiently for Draco to respond. “Harry, I -”
“Great. McGonagall told us to find another thing to do; a game, which I have for us. It is something that calls for physical bravery, endurance, and naturally, House Points.”
But Greg was both.
Harry nodded and she left him alone, silently shutting the door after her before returning to the others.
Here is the next chapter in line. Hope you like it too!
Goldstein left Jones with a final parting instruction, “Oh – and it`s up to you whether you select a male or female opponent. Fewer limits make for more fun!” Jones bit her lip but nodded, she could do this. Goldstein sat down and Jones stared at the Slytherins, some looked excited, others bored, but most looked neutral.
“Then stop acting as one! He´s the best looking bloke in school in my opinion, he´s nice to everyone. He´s got his own money so you know that´s not why he wants you. Not to mention he´s smart, and talented and Salazar knows how good he is in bed.”
Draco cursed aloud. He would have to
Harry took a deep breath as he looked at Draco Malfoy again.
A bright green light right next to Draco blinded him momentarily. And then he heard it. The thump from a body dropping heavily to the ground.
He was the laughing stock amongst the ranks of loyal Death Eaters. He was sure that his father wished that he had a different heir, and not this screw-up, who just happened to be his son and only child. He had no idea what his mother thought of him recently they hadn´t had time alone together for months.
Malfoy whipped around so fast Harry wondered how the blond managed to not fall over.
Harry´s head rose as he leaned back against the wall, his two friends letting his shoulders go slowly. “Yes?”

“You fucking coward. He´s unarmed,” someone from the light side yelled, causing the Dark Lord to laugh coldly, not caring. He would deal with
“How about a trade, Potter?” Harry blinked in confusion over the whispered words that only he could hear. “I give you my house points, if you

to grab the prophecy, then I might have been persuaded to act differently.”
Challenging Harry Potter´s ex-girlfriend seemed like a perfect start of their game. They approved.
Hermione frowned. “It doesn´t look like a good sign –“
“Shit, I thought they´d never scram.” Greg stretched his legs lazily in front of him on the silver carpet by the chair he was sitting in.
“Why would you-“
So, he held back.
look away, he tried to, he really did. He didn´t need to watch Goyle, whom had lost the baby fat and grown taller and leaner; Goyle with a body to die for, so full of muscles that Harry wondered how his tight clothes didn´t burst open the seams. He didn´t need to start panting when said male´s pink tongue licked and sucked on a few of his own fingers, that he had soiled with porridge - probably on purpose - Harry thought. He definitely did
“For today´s lesson we are going to study a spell that creates and controls water. It may not seem like a Dark arts curse, but if mastered correctly and in the wrong hands, It might very well be. Does anyone know a spell that does just that?” Professor Weasley asked her class of Slytherin and Gryffindor eighth years, while she was facing them on this Monday morning. So many eighth years had chosen the class that they had to divide them in two.
“I heard a rumour about you and Finnegan, that you –“
Harry growled, slammed the door shut and joined her. “Not in the mood to chat. You´re lucky they sent you; anyone else I would have murdered…”
Harry kissed down Draco´s inviting body, tasting every inch hungrily, never wanting to end it. He licked the length in front of him once he reached Draco´s groin. Draco moaned and grabbed Harry´s dark hair at once to keep him there.
“One can never be too careful. I have to marry someday, and nobody wants a slobby husband.” Grey eyes surveyed Greg´s body, “And like you would know anything about it anyway. Everything
Harry knew, of course, that Malfoy had been pressured beyond anything to comply with his orders, barely knowing what he was doing. Harry had seen flashes of images Voldemort did not know he had let slip, whenever he was excited or angry enough to not shield it from Harry.
“Hufflepuff boys are mine then,” Michael Corner stated. “You take the Slytherin girls Li, you´re friends with Bulstrode.” She nodded.
Hope you enjoy it!
“Don´t stop talking… I´ll…” Draco laughed.
“Of course they bloody well do, even Hermione told me once that - you can´t tell anyone I said that!”
Having just finished an exhausting Transfiguration essay due Monday morning, he walked toward their secret meeting place, humming to himself and picturing possible ways to get Malfoy into trouble.
“Might I suggest that you find another way to challenge each other? Perhaps a chess tournament, sports, or another game.” She said before leaving them behind to part ways.
“Mr. Malfoy would like to see you if you have time.” the young witch - who wore blue robes - informed him. Harry took a deep breath and nodded. “This way then.”
rules to the game about dignity: no showing off intimate body parts to the crowd out of respect for the participants. Goldstein cast a blurring charm, as the only one allowed a wand in the room so that if Malfoy´s cock did appear out in the open, no one would be able to actually see it. The charm would be like a cover-up, and the onlooker would only see a fluffy cloud surrounding the said body part.
She noticed his tear-streaked cheeks, of course, but ignored them, for now. “Haven´t the faintest, but it got you to let me in.” She moved past him and sat on his bed.
“Relax Dray, Pretty boy here is gay too.” Harry´s eyes widened and he tried to push Goyle away from him. His brain had momentarily forgotten how to comprehend words; making it impossible for Harry to communicate and tell Goyle to fuck off.
“Indeed, and you think I would actually live in a Gryffindor cave?”
Harry pushed Draco back until he stood against the wall. “Open your pants for me…” His voice was raspy. With shaking hands, Draco obliged him.
He didn’t mind the fans, even if their questions were a tad repetitive; it was the fake smiles and schmoozing that the recording executives insisted on that really ground him down. Right now, he was stuck with one of the worst of the lot. Evan wasn’t even sure if the man actually liked his music or was just making empty conversation because his boss wanted him to. For some reason, the man reminded him of Fudge, which was just not a good thing for anyone. He sighed again internally and allowed his eyes to roam the room, trying to spot Scott or Angela so he could ask if he could leave anytime soon.
“Yeah, no, nightmares. But it’s fine.” Evan said, and when he noticed the scepticism on Scott’s face, he added, “No, really. It’s fine. I worked it out. I wrote a new song. I think it’s good. Reminds me of how far I’ve come and that I won’t be going back to being that broken boy again.” He said as he fed the owl some bacon.
“I heard that.” She said, not even turning around.
Draco allowed it. He knew how it went. Who among their generation didn’t have occasional nightmares. He pushed the folder towards Evan, tapping it with one long, pale finger. Evan nodded and pulled it towards him, opening it up to read through. He knew better than to sign anything without reading it.
“Oh,” Angelina said, raising an eyebrow enquiringly at Evan.
“So who is Scott? Boyfriend?” Draco asked, needing to know the answer more than he would ever admit to.
He couldn’t wait to feel the blond’s arms wrapped around him, soothing him once more. Evan was glad he had George back and maybe over time he would make friends with Bill and Charlie again as well but he knew now that he would never have Ron and Hermione back. And at this point he knew he didn't want them back.
Hermione laughed and walked out. “As long as he signs on as a client first.” She reminded him as she left, and Draco’s grin widened.
“You poor boy. I’m so glad you survived and came to us.” She said, hugging him close. Then she pulled away and continued, “Of course, your real eye colour would suit you best, love. And it is a gorgeous colour. Now, how about you show us what you can really do with your magic?” she asked briskly, changing the subject a little as she could see that Evan was getting uncomfortable, as he always did when people focused on his looks. It was strange for someone who lived so much of his life in the limelight, but she had always found it an endearing trait.
The man was rather fit in his dark blue, pin-striped, three-piece muggle suit, and Evan couldn’t help admiring how well his former rival had grown up. He had certainly filled out in all the right places. Looking up to meet Malfoy’s eyes, he was surprised to see the other man giving him just as frank an appraisal. Evan himself had dressed semi-casually in fitting trousers and a white button-down shirt, with no tie or jacket. It looked like Malfoy liked what he saw as well. Evan flushed slightly and averted his eyes.
“Right, of course. Yeah, sure, you can pick me up at seven on Friday.” Evan said, feeling stupid; he should have known that.
“Oh, ew, no. He’s my cousin. Used to go by Dudley Dursely. We, both of us, changed our names when we decided to put our pasts firmly behind us. Now he’s Scott Jamieson. You met him at the party. The blonde who left with me?” Evan said, reminding Draco of the man who had seemed so concerned with Evan at the after-party.

“George is fine, Evan. If you really want, I can ask if he would be open to meeting you sometime?” Remus asked gently, placing a soothing hand on Evan’s fidgeting ones.
It had taken a lot of time and apologies for the two of them to move past their abusive pasts and form a relationship with each other. It started with Harry writing to his aunt to get his birth certificate and other official documents to enrol in school. Petunia had tried to throw the letter out without even reading it, but Dudley had objected, and it had been the final straw that had caused him to break with his parents once and for all. Dudley had found the documents stashed in the attic and brought them to Harry.
“Draco Malfoy, are you planning to sleep with a client?” Hermione asked teasingly.
“The reason we agreed to meet with them was that they promised to increase your audience. In light of what you just told us, I’m guessing they would be able to promote you in the magical world as well. Is that something you would be interested in? Or is it too soon? Or never?” Angela asked, insistently even as she peered at him intently, searching for signs that she was pushing him too far.
“What about the rest of the presents?” Harry asked half-heartedly following along.
“There’s the rub, innit.” Evan sighed. “I guess it’s time to finally come clean with everyone?” He asked, looking up at his cousin inquiringly.
The past few days had really brought up a lot of old memories and issues, so Evan wasn’t surprised in the least that he had been woken up by screaming nightmares for the past week. He knew it would get better, but he would have to discuss it with Scott. He knew that Scott didn’t mind, and if he had had any good options or he found a way to trust magicals or even just one mind-healer, he wouldn’t consider bothering Scott like this; sadly, he didn’t.
“No, l-like really blonde. Wh-white blonde.”
“I look alright?” He asked. Scott gave him a thumbs-up, and the brunette nodded to himself and prepared to step out into the melee.
“You, my darling boy, are more than worth it.” She said, cupping his cheek in one perfectly manicured hand before she kissed the other cheek and smiled at him. “I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow.”
“Yup, smile and nod along to whatever Angela says, and you should be home free in an hour or so,” Scott said encouragingly.
“That was close,” Scott muttered.

“Of course. There’s no way we could have managed in that small flat all four of us for so long without a little magic. It’s nice to have it finally confirmed, though.” She answered, shrugging nonchalantly, and Evan grinned at her, relieved beyond the measure of it.
“I’m really sorry, Mr. Malfoy. It seems Evan is not feeling quite up to a party tonight.” The manager said on cue.
“Can we see what you really look like? Or can it not be removed?” Ryan asked, and Evan could see that he was the one of them all who was really upset by the secrets Evan had kept, even if he did understand the reasons.
Draco sat back, surprised at the anger he could feel radiating from the other man. He hadn’t expected this much after all this time. Potter – dammit Jamieson, he would have to remember the new name if he kept his client. And he realised he would be keeping Jamieson as his client; he wanted to know more about this man, and staying his lawyer was the easiest way forward. He may be angry about the man’s attitude towards Hermione, but he had already come too far to back off now.
“He wants a very specific kind of jewellery.” She said. And when there didn’t seem to be any spark of comprehension she continued, “The kind that means you stay together forever?”
“I don’t know. Angela said the firm’s name was Granger and Malfoy, though.” Scott answered, still uncomprehending.
“So, do you think you’re up to going back to the party, or should I just make some excuses for you with Angela and the rest?” Scott asked. Evan paused, assessing his state of tiredness.
“So you don’t want Hermione to know where you are. Is that how you treat old friends?” Draco drawled, his anger at how Potter – no Jamieson – had treated his friend coming to the fore.
“What like mine?” Scott asked, rubbing a hand over his own short blonde strands.
“I knew it! Never mind. Next year I’ll write you out a proper Christmas list.” He grinned before pushing his fiancé down onto the bed and straddling him.
“Yeah, Granger is one of my former best friends. The bitch who tore into me along with the other so-called best friend of mine Ron Weasley when I spoke up for the Malfoys at their trial. I’m not really surprised actually that she’s such a hypocrite.” Evan continued a sardonic twist to his lips.
Evan spoke to Remus, and the werewolf had nothing but good things to say about Malfoy’s firm. He didn’t mention Hermione as he knew how much Evan hated the mention of his former friends. But Malfoy had apparently turned his life around, attended muggle law school and done well for himself by establishing the firm with Hermione, where he handled the muggle side, and she dealt with the magical side for the most part, although there was some overlap sometimes.
Harry stared at her blankly for a moment before the light went on in his brain.
“Oh, he’s better, so much better in person.  And even better than his absolutely amazing talent is that he’s gorgeous. So damn beautiful I hope he’s not straight.” Draco sighed, leaning back in his chair and putting his feet up on the desk.
Once Harry heard Draco’s footsteps receding he turned over and grinned to himself. Hopefully, today was the day he would get engaged to the love of his young life. He got up and bounded down the stairs after the blonde.
“Harry, Harry, it’s almost Christmas.” Draco cried pouncing on his sleeping lover and covering his face in kisses.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, drinking their coffee and trying to wake up as they waited for Angela. Five minutes later, she breezed in dressed in a neat blue pantsuit, hair beautifully coiffed and looking as perfect as she had the night before.
When Remus had left, Evan wandered back into his music room and sat at the piano, noodling a tune, something he had written a couple of years ago when he thought of some of his old friends who he still hadn’t been sure had been true friends. It seemed to fit whenever he thought of the remaining Weasley twin.
“Why don’t we order some lunch, and I’ll tell you the story?” Evan said, beckoning the waitress at Draco’s nod.
Potter had left; after the trials, he had just up and left without looking back. Thank goodness Potter had at least returned Draco’s wand before he had buggered off to parts unknown, Draco thought sourly. Draco found it difficult to forgive the prat for leaving Hermione all alone like that even if Hermione didn’t hold a grudge and insisted that it was partly her fault. She hadn’t explained it to him, but he could see the pain in her eyes when she spoke of her former best friend, and he hated it. All these years of working together and establishing their law firm that worked in both the wizarding and muggle worlds had made them quite close friends, but she still hadn’t told him things in her past, especially related to the two boys who used to be her best friends. He didn’t even know what had happened to her parents, and he knew pushing would just bring all her walls up again, so he let it be.  He was drawn out of his reminiscence by the words of the next song and struck anew by how much it resonated with him.
“I-I don’t know. Let me think about it, alright? I’m getting better about dealing with it, but it’s not perfect. I had a panic attack the minute I spotted him yesterday.” Evan said, sighing again.
“This calls for a proper celebration.” Draco continued as he stood up and dragged Harry back upstairs.
“May I ask why you wish to keep such a secret?” He asked, examining Evan closely. He would address the man’s issues with Hermione later.
Evan started when he felt someone gently touch his arm. Evan looked up through blurry, tear-filled eyes to see Scott’s concerned face looking down at him. He was still gasping for breath and shaking so badly he wasn’t sure how Scott managed to hold him close without shaking himself.
“What do you want this time, Ronald?” Angelina asked disdainfully.
“Go on then open it,” Harry said walking into the room and going down on one knee in front of Draco.
George proudly showed off his new products, offering Evan his choice of the more recent adult products as they passed through the shop going to the back where Angie’s office was.
“Does my baby want a new cloak then?” He asked as he was dragged along behind Draco when the blonde started walking.
Draco fished in his pockets and found the CD he had been listening to lately.
Evan just laughed and agreed that he would like to see Angie again and meet his kids.
“Hey, I hate the paparazzi. And stalkers of all kinds. I have nothing against genuine fans. Being appreciated for something I actually did on my own, something that’s just mine, that’s actually quite nice and a genuine change of pace.” Evan answered, pretending to pout a little.
“He is pretty,” Hermione admitted while studying the picture.
“I’m sorry-“ Evan started, but she waved it off.
“That is the same blonde git. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. A lawyer now, apparently.” Evan said, grimacing a little. His eyes, now blue under the glamour, looked a little lost and a little sad. “I’m actually quite impressed that he’s working with muggles now, actually,” Evan said as he managed to gather himself. “But I don’t think I can do any work with them. The Granger mentioned?” he said, and Scott nodded again, understanding dawning slowly as Evan spoke.
Evan let out a choked laugh at that, “That bitch, that hypocritical bitch.” He gasped, laughing almost hysterically.
“You never really explained that to me.” Scott asked, “You just said they made it unbearable, and you had to leave.”
“So that’s why you told me not to make any deals with Malfoy and Granger?” Angela asked. She had been quietly listening to them for so long.
“I feel like a clueless idiot.” Harry grumped.
“Remus asked me last week if I would be alright with meeting with Harry…um Evan here and keeping it a secret from the rest of the family. So I went to meet him for lunch today. Since he just doesn’t want to have anything to do with Ron and Ginny, I thought it was safe enough to bring him back here.” George explained easily after one last mock glare at a still sniggering Evan.
“Of course, I’m allowed to go back there. I’m only his bloody brother, after all. Not some stranger.” Ron muttered as he barged into the office.
“Good night then? Do we have a new client?” Hermione asked, smiling up at him from her desk as he passed on his way to his own office.
“So, what’s your policy on dating clients?” He asked, a small grin on his face. He knew Draco was interested, as evidenced by the admiring glances the blonde had been throwing him.
“Alright, then. If that’s done, who wants breakfast?” Scott asked, getting up and clapping his hands.
They had listened to his story about running away from home and not being willing to go back even if it meant sleeping rough, and for some reason, he still didn’t understand, had decided to help him. Harry was so grateful that they had. Mama Jem or Jemima Farnsworth, who was as English as her name indicated and not the Italian mama she acted like, despite the successful Italian restaurant she owned and ran, mothered all her employees, had taken to mothering Harry as well.
“I’ll do better. I’ll help you pick it out.” She said and dragged him away from the window moving further down the alley towards the posher parts of Diagon Alley.

Evan smirked at Scott and mouthed, “Relatively.” Both men chuckled softly as they followed after her.
“I know. But there is something in particular he wants and he’s been hinting at it all bloody month. I need to figure it out or it is going to drive me crazy. Besides if he wants it so much what kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t get it for him?” Harry asked a harassed expression on his face.
Evan grimaced and shrugged, opening his mouth to reply when they heard a commotion outside. The shop assistants were obviously trying to prevent someone from entering the office area. All three of them turned around when they heard a very disgruntled voice grumbling loudly.
He then told a much-edited version of his life for the next seven years ending with his running away from the fame and infamy in the wizarding world, where everyone wanted something from him. When he paused to grapple for control of the emotions his memories had brought back, Scott rubbing his back a sympathetic look on his face, he saw his friends, his family staring at him, shock and something else he couldn’t quite place on their faces. Evan buried his face in his hands.
“You don’t need any changes?”
Evan nodded as if to himself. “So, anyway, do you agree to my terms? You still want to be my lawyer? And help increase my audience in the magical and muggle worlds?” he asked, brushing aside his anger at his former friend and moving on, forcibly.
He had never thought anyone would understand what he had been through during the war and in the years after when he had been desperately trying to redeem himself and make a name for himself away from his parents.
“Harry, I don’t know why you are so worried. You know he loves you and will be happy with whatever you get him.” Hermione said as she was dragged along behind her best friend as they made their way to Twilfitt and Tattings.
Evan hesitated, but George continued, “We never see Ron and Ginny these days, and Mum has never come into the shop, not since that first time, just after we opened it.” He said, sadness creeping into his eyes before he quickly brushed it off and smiled brightly again.
Harry was getting desperate when Draco finally took pity on his clueless boyfriend and pointed out the advertisement for shares in a diamond mine.
“Ah, the decadent lifestyle of musicians. Waking up at noon and partying all night.” Draco commented, smirking teasingly.
Draco’s eyes sharpened as he tried to recall where he had seen this man before. He was clearly a wizard if he required a vow.
“Yes, yes yes. I will. I’ll do that very thing.” Draco said throwing his arms around his lover and kissing him till they were both breathless.

Angelina looked up, and Evan was struck by the fact that, like George, she hadn’t really changed much in the intervening years; sure, they both had some slight greying at the temples, but both still had their youthful dispositions intact, and he was grateful for it.
“That’s beautiful, Evan,” Jemima said, patting his shoulder and kissing his cheek affectionately. Evan grinned. He could see that he had nothing to worry about with his family. Everyone, even Ryan, seemed to accept his magical heritage, even if it would take them a little while to reconcile themselves to his past and the fact that he had kept it a secret for so long.

“I’m fine, Scotty. Don’t worry. It’s just – you remember me telling you about the blonde git who used to make my life hell in school?”
Evan listened quietly, not really knowing what to say to that. He was glad that he wasn’t part of that anymore and didn’t have to put up with Molly’s smothering anymore, but he was sorry to hear that Molly had systematically chased away the best of her kids, leaving her with just the dregs.
A few weeks later, Evan wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans as he saw George enter the café where they were supposed to meet. He wasn’t sure what to say to the redhead. He hadn’t seen the man since his twin’s funeral. This could be awkward as hell. But it never got the chance.
