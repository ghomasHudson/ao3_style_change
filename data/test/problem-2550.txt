'Thicket,' Draco said. 'Because of its meaning.'
'Accident my arse. She hates me,' Aria said, 'told me I'd never see Draco's wings when I first met her.'
Anger boiled inside him as the lesson continued, with dueling covered, Cygnus was now going over the theory into the Patronus Charm. The Charm he knew his girlfriend could perform effortlessly. Who in the wizarding community didn't know that information.
Aria ignored him, he might have tried with his wand, but he wasn't the Master of the Elder Wand. And only Ron and Hermione knew that she had kept the wand. She pulled up his sleeve exposing his arm. Even though she knew it was there - Aria closed her eyes - actually seeing it on his arm was different from suspecting that the Dark Mark was on his arm. She brought her wand up and began to mutter under her breath until finally, the Glamour Charm faded the Dark Mark from sight.
'I - I - gosh,' Aria rambled once more, hands raised in the air as she said, 'Why am I even attempting to explain myself!'
'Don't start,' Hermione interrupted.
'But Draco's not -'
It was the only thing that made any sense. Ron thoughtfully agreed.
'I was just thinking of Aria,' his mother stated, 'of how much she deserved a bonding.'
Potter looked delighted with herself ... a little too delighted. She was enjoying this. Draco doubted it was spending her time eating dinner with them. What was she thinking? What had she been planning? Turn up and annoy the hell out of his father in hopes he'd speak with his mother and end the engagement?
Draco almost chuckled, 'I can see why you were sorted into Slytherin.'
'Cissy.'
'If you're the joker of your class or house,' Aria said, and Finnigan to a large applause from the Gryffindors made his way over to the middle of the hall, doing a little bow as he entered the square - he was joined by several others. Aria went through several more questions if they had a favourite class - and what lesson was it, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions. To if they were religious. If they owned or had owned owl, and she did the same with other pets allowed at Hogwarts. Longbottom did not look best pleased as he entered the center square when she called out for people who owned or had owned a toad. If they ever had an argument with a friend. If they were in a relationship.
'So they're talking, your mother and her sister?' Blaise asked, two hours later.
'Time to go home Coeus, unless you want to get eaten by a mad raging dog.' Aria said as soon as she entered her old bedroom. The falcon still made no move to leave. 'I swear you're just as stubborn as your owner is. Fine, you'll just have to come with me, as much as I don't like Malfoy right now, I don't want you to get hurt.'
Her aunt too had been eyeing the door but disrespectfully as though the door had done something wrong, Draco had no time to ponder on it, as a loud shutting of a door occurred. And by the sound of it, it had come from the front door.
Narcissa laughed, 'Compatible magic is not as complicated as making a wand Aria. Indeed, I knew from something simple as that.'
Draco understood what his grandmother meant, Aria baffled him at the best of times, but the respect people had for her - she had never demanded it, but people had done so regardless.
'Sorry,' Aria said, grinning madly, 'my lips are sealed.'
'I know the theory behind wands, how the core and tree have to be compatible to allow for a wand to be created.' Narcissa said, 'My grandfather, his knowledge was vast, very vast. He knew information, enough that when it became clear I was Lucius's match, that my grandfather could ease my concerns. Very much was expected of me considering Andromeda's compatible match. I lost a sister, I could not -' Narcissa paused, 'I am not strong like you, so of course I choose the rest of my family. Followed Lucius, giving him all the support I could - I thought we were right.'
'Ron?' Aria asked, 'Do you know something I don't?'
Draco - though he hated to admit it - was currently pacing the length of the fireplace. It was Christmas Eve and he was waiting for Aria to appear through the grate. He knew that they had to work over some issues - like the fact that she changed the subject every time her Muggle relatives came up - and that she still had not forgiven him. Draco had known she wouldn't forgive him quickly, but he had hoped that the other night had proven that he was being truthful with her. Enough so that she wouldn't have to spend Christmas alone ... he just couldn't get that notion out of his head, it completely baffled him, for surely she would want to go to Weasley's if she didn't want to go to her Muggle relatives.
Aria re-framed from rolling her eyes, 'yes I heard you, Marge is coming to stay, and she'll be here later on today.'
Aria shook her head, and repeated, 'I'm a Malfoy.'
'The nightmares - I take it you've had a few if your cousin's reaction was anything to go by - are they always that bad?'
No sooner had Aria moved in the direction she spotted her friends, the people on the platform begun to realise that she was there.
However, Cygnus was several years older and came into his inheritance as naturally as he had done everything else. During his fourth year, everything changed ... and Draco disliked everything Cygnus resembled including being a Veela. Cygnus just thought he was so much better than everybody else - and a thought occurred to him, it was exactly how he used to be -
“Tell me you brought enough information that we can be productive today,” Draco said. It was a question, he supposed, though he didn’t bother to add any sort of inflection.
It was a minute or two before he spoke, and it was only to utter quietly, “Thank you, Kreacher.”
Considering how reasonable the man had been on his last visit, he felt generous enough to offer up a response. “Some trees fell this weekend. I’m building an addition.”
wasn’t likely to make me more amenable. Even if this interpretation of his death was more creative than usual.”
Off to the side Vince clicked a bit as he shifted on his perch, and glancing over he saw that the owl was apparently communicating something to Potter. Bloody traitor. He finished with the dishes and turned around, leaning back against the counter.
“Sticking Charms.”
without excessive
He threw together some breakfast and thought about what he might do to pass the time that week while he waited for the kettle to heat up, frowning when his thoughts kept turning over to Potter.
“I’m not going to share them around! No one will see them. They’re for me. You know, sightseeing pictures. So I can remember the places we’ve been.”
The expression finally shifted and Vince offered a dull hoot before gliding over to the window sill.
“They have a son, you said?”
“Potter,” he said slowly, and when that didn’t get a response he reached over and grabbed his empty hand, clasping it tightly. It was cool, slightly clammy, though whether from nerves, lack of sleep, or a combination of the two he wasn’t sure. “Potter,” he repeated, “leave Hermione to me. As far as I’m concerned you did what you were there to do. You kept an eye on what was happening, and you got me to safety when things went wrong. Thank you.”
He imagined that he could hear Potter’s teeth grinding. Something that he’d considered long-dead inside him smirked at the thought.
There wasn’t much conversation. Instead they sat in silence, occasionally sharing a word or two about the following day’s test, or a comment about the Christmas tree that was still up for some reason, or about what Potter expected from the upcoming testing season at Nimbus. Anything, really, to keep from addressing the stifling tension in the air, the inescapable fact that Draco could feel himself falling apart. But they continued to sip at their wretched drinks and make idle remarks about nothing at all until his thoughts lost their hard edges and the light outside faded.
Draco watched him walk away for several long seconds before clenching his jaw and Apparating home.
,” Hermione said.
He got a distracted nod in return, then Potter’s frown deepened as he said, “All right. And, er, good job today. I guess.”
“Oh, she’s just really going to hate me now,” Potter said vaguely.
He was given an intent look then, as Potter slowly and almost carefully sat in his chair. Which was slightly amusing, but Draco figured that he had been possessive enough about it in the past that it wasn’t such a surprise. He just gave Potter a small smile, which seemed to confuse the poor man further. Which led Draco to hide his broadening smile behind his mug.
“Vince, I have no idea what has happened to my life.” When there was no response, he looked over at the empty perch and remembered that he’d let the owl out. “Right, and now I’m talking to myself. Fucking perfect.”
me.” Then he swallowed so hard that Draco heard it.
“Don’t yell. Vince finds it distressing.”
Potter spun around, then chucked the broom his way. “Yeah. Just stick within six inches of the end, if you can. Otherwise you might mess with the stability.”
The man let out a shuddering breath and nodded a few times, before knocking back the rest of his drink, setting the glass down, and adding his other hand to where they were holding each other. Then he looked up, those bright eyes freezing him in place.
“Whoever decided that we needed to do
“Maybe if you call me Harry?”
He looked over with a brow quirked and didn’t respond.
“You’d almost think he was fifteen again. So much yelling.”
Potter cracked a grin. “Yeah, I guess it’s a bit warm.” He stretched out indolently on the bed and Draco swallowed convulsively as his eyes couldn’t help but follow the sight of those rippling muscles.
“What? I’m not calling him Draco. He doesn’t have a problem with that—right, Malfoy?”
Draco frowned. “How many other social engagements have you given up because of my situation?”
Biting a trail up Potter’s neck as he fumbled with the lid of the thing, he soon had a slick hand and let the container drop onto his nearby coat. After a quick brush of his lubricated fingers against their lengths, eliciting a sharp breath from Potter, he reached up with his dry hand to tweak a sensitive nipple, swallowing the resulting cry with his mouth before spinning the man around until his chest was pressed up against the door.
“Well if you don’t hack pieces off of the brooms. . . . Yeah, you should probably be able to. If I can adjust the tamper-proofing to allow it.”
As they sat there watching each other, that buried part of Draco, the one that had an all-consuming need to annoy Potter, to hurt Potter, to do
“Draco?” he asked softly.
“I see you,” Potter said, the quiet words ringing in Draco’s ears. “I see how much the thought of people upsets you. And I know that your whole thing with spaceflight is just a way for you to run away from everything. But while you’re
The breeze made the leaves in the trees at the edge of the clearing whisper. The night air was crisp, but it was warm compared to the frigid air in Azkaban.
Vince hooted a few times in reply, then swooped over to another branch to continue his judgment.
“I still don’t know why that’s any of your business,” he replied, stirring his soup as it warmed, his back to the man.
She gave him a patient look. “Given the history that the two of you have, if Harry considers you worth helping, I think that I should probably listen to him. Don’t you think?”
And by then it was the middle of the month, and Potter’s work for Nimbus was resuming, and Draco was losing his mind.
Draco’s eyebrows had been climbing steadily higher, but Hermione voiced his thoughts perfectly when she demanded, “And no one at Hogwarts noticed!?”
“Would you mind telling my friend here if that decoration on your back wall looks anything like a lobster?” Potter asked, raising his voice over the sound of the music and flashing a smile when the woman looked back toward them.
“Press the small oval,” Draco instructed, then watched as Potter did so, the bottom of his cloak sticking to the bristles that it had been pressed up against. Then he shook the broom, and tossed it away from him, only for it to stop a bit over a foot away before falling, unable to travel farther with its tether.
Draco felt himself relaxing, the tension and discomfort leaving him because of the ease with which the other man was sharing the silly story, even while that formerly buried part of him was becoming more and more difficult to subdue, and increasingly belligerent about its desires.
Draco nodded, then turned to make his way back to his cabin. Until he sorted that layer of spellwork there was no point in beginning the next.
“Yeah. You should be able to start with the Bubble-Head. I held off on my adjustments since you’d be best off starting with the heat protection, and layering that one in as the base before the others, but you said you were going to research that a bit more. I wasn’t sure if you were ready yet, but if you are I can get started with that process on another broom while you work on that one.”
Draco shrugged. “It’ll take however long it takes. But if putting up with your presence three times per week is what’s necessary to get things done sooner, I’ll take it.”
Draco nodded, not turning around. “Thank you, Potter,” he said quietly, his voice sounding unsteady to his own ears.
When the lift doors opened a pair of witches emerged, and though their eyes slid over Draco when they walked by they gave no hint of recognition. And then the lift doors closed, and he spun to face Hermione.
“All year?” There was a thin laugh. “More so since October, but—Draco, this whole experience has been so
A few of the adults laughed, though he spotted a rather conflicted expression on Weasley’s face. Draco swallowed and looked to Hermione helplessly, who she simply smiled kindly and said, “Eddie’s introducing you to Norbert.”
“Er, yeah. I suppose that’s a fair point. I guess I also didn’t really know what to do with the stuff at the time?” His hand was in his hair, nervously mussing it as he appeared to actually notice the horrors of his collection.
The first two trunks blew up quite spectacularly, but the third seemed to hold.
Draco felt like he was choking, the words startled him so much. Swallowing hard he looked over at his mother in alarm. “Pardon?”
The man smiled and ducked his head slightly. “Hey, Malfoy. I thought I might come by a bit early and bring breakfast before Hermione gets here?”
He shrugged. Draco still hadn’t accustomed himself to the temperatures on mainland, and the air was a refreshing sort of cool compared to the frigid nights in Azkaban. “I’ve survived colder,” he said shortly, before sheathing his knife and setting off toward the clearing.
that was present when Harry moved here. And other things that surface when the house feels like antagonising him.”
The hands paused for a second and Draco frowned, then they resumed their movements.
“I know,” Draco said through a sigh. He looked at the conjured loveseat that was still there, taking up valuable space inside, then rolled his eyes and stood to push it against the wall. There was no sense in Vanishing it when Potter would probably just want it again the next time he returned.
“Maybe.”
“Yeah,” Potter muttered, stepping close and clasping a hand over where Draco held the Portkey. “Maybe we should just not go back.”
“That should be good for today,” he announced, handing the broom back over to Potter. “Keep it out of the bag. If it manages to retain the Atmospheric Charms for another week then I’ll move along to the Sticking Charms.” He frowned, thinking about how he’d want to place those so that they’d be secure enough to hold him when he wanted them to, but also release him without needing to be dispelled. “I might need to commit further assault, so prepare for that.”
Potter gave him an amused look. “She didn’t tell you what she does for work?”
“You all right?” he asked quietly.
Draco fought the urge to look back over at the man and instead focused his gaze inward, not really seeing the boats anymore as he continued to think.
He had Potter’s entire body pinned at that point and reached out, his fingers blindly finding Potter’s and threading through them against the door as his eyes were screwed shut, his mouth pressed against the junction of Potter’s shoulder and neck.
'Yes, Granger I can see figuring it out,' Draco said.
'Why didn't you just tell me?'
exactly do I need a Muggle Passport for?
'It will come ... your transformation ... Pot-Aria will see them. I have no doubt in that.'
'Want me to come with you?'
'Should we go after her?' Miss Reyes said looking past Draco's shoulder, to no doubts where his daughter had run off to.
Aria had not thought of that - she had not realised that her rejecting his friendship way back in their first year had affected him at all. 'Well, you were being a prick ... Draco. And our first meeting in Madam Malkin's pretty much put me off you -'
'Sorry,' she mumbled as she put her glasses on. Potter was still trembling, and she pulled at the bed-cover, but it did not seem to be so she could cover herself - more as a source of comfort. 'Nightmare - didn't mean to wake you.'
'It always works best, if the wand's alliance is with the wizard in question, Miss Potter. You can borrow another person's wand, but the magic will never be the same, you'll never have true potential.' Mr Ollivander said, 'Even in true magically compatibility, the wand will respond to the person's match but will not alliance itself unless it is won.'
"It displeases me to see you like this, Aria," Voldemort said. He had been doing that a lot too, using her first name though she had ever given him permission to refer to her by her first name. It was like he thought he didn't need it. "It was not like we could trust you, that is until the most unlikely opportunity arose. One that sets you free from this chair and allows for you to have your wand."
'He's magically pure,' Ginny said, 'that's why he says he's a pure-blood because he comes from a magical family. It's the same with Fleur, part Veela, magically pure.'
'Yeah,' Neville shrugged running a hand through his hair, 'it's been - it's been good. Ginny told us about your summer. It's true then, you're engaged to Malfoy?'
'To bond with you?' George clarified. 'She has a right to know that is the only way to stop magical withdrawal.'
'Well he didn't try anything - we didn't kiss.'
'You hurt her feelings Draco,' Pansy clarified, 'therego, that wonderful magical oath you told us you took - well you also happened to break -'
His name came as a whisper, a tone he hardly heard from his father. He turned around not sure whether he wanted to speak with the man or not.
'Well just you wait ... prepare to be amazed ... two days from now and you'll see stuff that normal - well people like me did and built. You'll see.'
'That bracelet was never about our engagement or a sign of our engagement Aria,' Draco replied softly, 'it has more meaning to it than that.' he kissed her cheek softly, 'None that need worry you, but it would please me greatly if you could ... if you would wear it again.' Draco returned to his task of brushing her hair, 'Thank you for telling me what you meant ... even if it was not everything, I .. just thank you.'
Draco turned as his father's stern gaze changed into bewilderment. This was clearly new information to them both Draco and him.
'Oh,' the girl sounded somewhat surprised, 'OK then.'
'Aria, what are you talking about?'
Ron looked down at the coins. Christmas day had just got that little bit brighter. "Best Christmas present, she's ever given me."
'I don't know,' Aria said uncertainly.
They were excused after the meal. The moment Aria reached what had become her room, she found a new trunk that was full of new clothing. Aria had been wondering if more clothing was to come. She had found a few items of clothing on the first day within the room she had been given. Aria rolled her eyes and tried to not think about who had gifted her the clothes, to begin with.
'So Potter's - you know - definitely it?' Blaise said, 'your compatible match?'
'Yeah, that way I can Apparate back to Grimmauld.'
"Don't you want to escape?" Neville said. "We can get that damn choker off you once we've got you to safety."
'You should get some sleep,' Drac-Malfoy said, 'You look tired.'
Aria was intriguing - she did not wear a bikini as the other Muggles did, she tended to favour wearing a two-piece swimsuit when they were by the pool. But it did not stop Draco from noticing the curves in her body or appreciate them. But Aria seemed to be uncomfortable with her skin, especially on the days she didn't wear her dorky glasses. Draco much preferred Aria with her glasses on - she didn't look the same - like a part of her was missing.
'I'd remind you that your mother has warded every single room in the Manor because as you both have now put it, "deserve a bonding", so yes I'm going, it's traditional after all.'
So he ignored the man, focused on not dropping the thing and crushing his feet, and only turned once he’d placed it on the next row.
He could feel Potter working to get his breathing under control and he waited, until the man stood up straight behind him, leaning against his back, his arms still looped around his chest. “I’ll grab the brooms. How many?”
In the morning not much was said as they prepared for the Ministry.
He shook his head. “Those won’t take, the tamper-proofing will reverse them automatically.”
Draco knocked back the rest of his tea, clenching his jaw briefly at the burn, then carried the mug over to the basin. “All right, tea time’s over. Let’s see these brooms.”
“They wouldn’t put it on the table if we weren’t meant to use it,” Potter replied blithely.
They settled into a lighter conversation after that, with Potter asking plenty of questions about foraging, of all things, and that took them through until ten o’clock when a loud crack and a rapid knock announced the arrival of Hermione.
“What are you thinking?” he murmured, his breath tickling Draco’s ear.
“Actually, I hear that I might be able to help you. Will you invite me in?”
They started walking again, though it was at a slower pace. “I tried, you know?” Potter said after a few minutes. “Well, no offense but I didn’t care about your dad. But I really tried for you and your mum.”
The cabin was silent but for the crackling fire and their shuddering breaths.
Slowly, in incredulous disbelief, he reached down with his hand and grasped at his half-hard cock, gasping slightly at the contact. He flipped off the quilt, still staring.
Potter broke their skin contact then, releasing the mug and sitting back in his chair, running one hand through his hair while the other one rested in his lap. “All right. I get that. I completely understand being hurt because of stupid mistakes,” he admitted, then asked, “I confuse you?”
Draco briefly contemplated setting the next broom on fire out of spite. “It was a perfectly reasonable request,” he instead replied with the patience of a bloody saint, “one which I’m sure your delicate sensibilities would appreciate. I plan on doing experiments on the brooms. For that to be done
He busied himself with the tea, trying to get himself back under control. By the time he turned to hand over Potter’s mug he felt like he’d mostly managed, though Potter looked out of sorts as well. He was certainly carrying himself much more awkwardly than usual, which was saying a lot, and he was avoiding Draco’s gaze. Once the mug was passed off he grabbed some dishes and utensils, and they prepared themselves each a plate.
Somewhat pleasingly, that made Potter splutter so Draco turned away to hide his small smile. The man didn’t find his ability to articulate until they were several yards outside of the clearing, where he asked, “What were those nuts, anyway? I don’t think I’ve had them before.”
Amusement played around Draco’s mouth. “I thought that might hurt your delicate sensibilities. But, as it was your idea,” he said, unsheathing his knife.
“Ah, no. We discussed things like civilised adults.” Vince shifted on his perch, his talons clicking mockingly, and Draco shot him a dirty look.
They’d been heading away from the pier for ten minutes when they finally emerged from a winding alley only to find themselves . . . back on the pier.
But then the man continued speaking before Draco could share those dangerous thoughts, and he was spared.
“Granger—Hermione,” he corrected after she gave him a hard look, “I appreciate your coming by. Really, I am realising how much I’d missed in trying to do this alone. Would you mind if I continued to run some ideas by you as this project progresses?”
Draco raised a brow.
“Malfoy, your mum is . . . intense,” he began.
“I did, yeah. I hadn’t seen them since Christmas. I’m pretty sure that Eddie—that’s Edgar, Ron and Susan’s son—has definitely grown since then. And Luna only just got back from her latest trip out of the country after being gone for four months.”
“I don’t see why it’s any of your business.”
“I can see why you’d remove it from the front hall, Potter, but I don’t understand why you felt the need to keep it. Surely there are better ways of remembering her.”
Draco shrugged. “Just the part where the door will go. I still need to do measurements to make sure I line things up properly.”
“Draco!” Hermione exclaimed once she stepped into the room. “Where’s Harry?”
“We’ve added some other factors to consider to the list, and she has some ideas about shielding.
Draco couldn’t contain his snort any longer and Potter shot him a look, then glanced away. Feeling particularly merciful, he decided to respond. “Yes, Potter, I do plenty without magic.” He looked out at the woods ahead of them and took a deep inhale of the crisp air, releasing it slowly. “I didn’t use any magic for ten and a half years. Some things I do without magic now so that I can feel them, and remind myself that I’m in the real world. Some things I do without magic now because when I put honest work and effort into them, there’s no need to justify to someone who’s already made their mind up about me that the magic was good, and not evil.”
Draco leaned forward to swing the door open and the man stepped in a moment later, giving him a shy smile.
He shook his head in bemusement. “People do change,” he muttered to himself.
Swing.
The man shot to his feet immediately, then did a double take upon seeing him, mumbling something that sounded like, “Fucking hell.”
Draco shrugged and replied, “I have no issue with that. We’ll probably want to do that during the day so that we can make use of the daylight.”
“I’ll need to apply some infusions to a few brooms tonight so that we can test them with Hermione tomorrow,” he managed, and he absolutely knew that his voice sounded wrecked.
“Is it? I figured you and Hermione still had another hundred things on your list. So you did it? It’s ready?”
“He hid in my attic instead of returning to Hogwarts on Sunday?”
Potter blinked a few times. “Right, I guess you wouldn’t know. Er, Walburga’s portrait sits behind that. She likes to scream obscenities about the fall of the ‘once noble house of Black’ and pretty much everything offends her, so we locked her behind some spelled shutters when I officially moved in. But the shutters only prevent us from hearing her screams, and don’t prevent her from hearing . . . well, my screams, I suppose. Fuck, that was intense. I know she’s not real, in a sense, but knowing she was right there listening the whole time. . . .”
Unfortunately Potter took that as encouragement, because he was then grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging them along yet another alley, but one that did happen to contain a rather busy souvlaki eatery.
Draco rose and grabbed two glasses in lieu of answering, and soon settled back into his chair. He swirled the liquid around in his glass, watching as the light of the fire was transformed into ripples of golden light under the surface. He allowed his thoughts to drift, simply enjoying the surprising turn of the evening.
All of the confusing signals Potter had been giving him during their last few interactions bubbled up to the surface of Draco’s mind, fighting for attention, until he sighed and dismissed all of them to focus on the present.
“Wait, so you didn’t have your wand taken away? What’s with all of this, then?” Potter asked, waving his arms around the small space.
“It doesn’t seem to be bothering you as much now though. Or are you just getting used to it?”
The heat was so intense that he couldn’t think, and it was gloriously wet, and he could feel each of Potter’s moans so acutely they felt like they were penetrating him. And then the man looked up at him, his mouth still stretched around his cock while his eyes blazed in challenge, and Draco felt that hidden part of him yell in victory as he held onto that gaze, his climax hitting him hard an instant later.
But he did notice that they were both suddenly completely naked, and that Potter had slid to the floor in front of the sofa and dropped his mouth to Draco’s cock.
“Well, you think about it. I’d give it another two weeks at most before we see snow.”
And it seemed that Potter also knew he was purposely being difficult because rather than fly off the handle he narrowed his eyes and took two steps closer until he was right in front of him.
“I’ll need to return to your house,” he said as their feet crunched through the snow. “I need to do some brewing if I’m to have enough to apply to an entire trunk.”
A stray part of him was cognisant of the additional intimacy present, given their surroundings and his heightened emotions. And that seemed to stoke his arousal higher rather than frightening him, as he stretched out on top of Potter and licked and sucked at his neck, then proceeded to taste his way down the man’s torso. He spent an eternity teasing those sensitive nipples, feeling his cock twitch with each of the man’s moans and gasps, each sound punctuating a flick of his tongue or a graze of his teeth.
He followed the man out onto the bow, sitting on his towel where he’d left it to dry in the heat of the day’s sun while they’d been sailing. He cracked the bottle and gave it a cautious sniff, his nose wrinkling slightly at the herbal aromas and the burn of alcohol.
They were too close now, and he could feel the hem of Potter’s cloak brush up against his calves as it fluttered in the breeze.
“Drink straight from the bottle then if you’re so inclined,” Draco replied. He had a small sip of the ouzo, letting the burn coat the inside of his mouth before taking a longer one, shutting his eyes with a soft groan.
Draco shook his head. “You and me both, old friend. You and me both.”
“Butterfly weed,” she replied just as quietly. “I think it’s time to let go of his hold on the two of us, don’t you?”
He shook his head. “No. I’ll need to be able to assess how much the alteration affects the balance and movement, and there are too many other variables affecting that one.”
Draco considered, then replied, “I’m not noticing it as often. Just after sitting for too long, generally. Or exerting myself as well, I suppose.”
It was a feeble excuse, and he knew it, and surely Potter knew it, but the other man gave no indication and simply hummed in response. They continued to sit there quiet for another ten minutes or so before Draco finally found his resolve and stood, walking with Potter to the front hall.
“You’re here? Why are you here?” Draco was confused, still feeling quite out of sorts from his day.
Draco brought his hands to his face and rubbed over his cheeks harshly, then scratched at his beard. He didn’t even know what to say to explain how much of an idiot he’d been. He could practically see the words on the page in front of him, explaining about the different gases in his body forming into bubbles where they didn’t belong and wreaking havoc.
, you won’t believe the night I’ve had.”
wants us dead.”
“You’re actually going to stay here?” It maintained its stare. “Suit yourself.”
It was the 25th, and he would need to see his mother.
Draco brought a hand to his jaw and scratched at his beard while he thought. “I’ll also need to test how shielding reacts to the environment around the broom, specifically as regards heat. See if your Elliott can confirm up to what temperatures the broom can withstand.”
“There. Come on, Vince. I didn’t mean it.”
would be, then Potter let out a ragged sigh, running his hand through his hair. “Look—you almost died. I thought you
Something inside him smirked a little, but he simply replied, “I need to keep stirring this until it’s done. Tell me about the flight charms, and how they’re layered with the braking charms.”
“I made it!” Potter said barely half a second after the crack of his Apparition sounded in the empty car park. Draco shuffled the photo back into the stack that he always carried around with him, tucking them all into his pocket. “Were you waiting long?”
Regretfully, that seemed to only encourage Potter rather than scare him off as his eyes blazed even brighter. “Why not?” he asked in a low voice.
“Because I requested it along with my order.”
They listened to Hermione’s receding footsteps, Potter’s gaze roaming Draco’s face all the while, likely looking for lingering traces of the earlier incident.
“I didn’t,” he decided, before taking another long drink from his glass.
in his eyes.
Sadness flickered in Potter’s eyes and Draco felt something clench inside his stomach. “Are you two not close?” came the careful question.
Draco cast his mind back to the previous evening, spent enjoying that massage in the kitchen. He’d been content, he remembered. That was a nice thought. He was quite content now, in fact, and he felt a smile form as his thoughts drifted.
It didn’t take much effort to remove Potter’s jumper. For some reason that entirely escaped him the shirt underneath had about a hundred buttons, and Draco was beginning to think that he did it on purpose. He wrenched at the offending fabric, hearing the faint sound of tiny buttons hitting the floor and an answering rumble of laughter as his own shirt was then pulled over his head and tossed in the direction of the staircase.
sorry for everything that you suffered.”
The following Monday after class he was marking out measurements on the logs that would become his corner posts when Potter arrived, and he let out a low whistle when he rounded the corner and saw the stone floor and neatly-arranged lumber.
Draco grabbed a spade and took it around to the back of the cabin, then began marking an outline of where the addition would go, to elongate the tiny toilet and shower nook that he currently had. He was just digging holes in the corners in order to plant some posts to act as markers when he heard the crack of Apparition.
“Well, I’m sorry that I needed to put you through that. But I can assure you that you’re not being monitored any more closely here than you are regularly at home, and that you’re certainly much safer from interference here than you are there. Now, I’ll need to go collect Harry. Did you want to come along, or wait here? Oh, you can leave your coat here if you wish, and as long as you keep that badge on you won’t be hassled.”
“Space,” he said tersely.
He bit his lip, then reached across the table to touch the tips of his fingers to the man’s hands where they clutched his mug.
“Teddy,” he replied with a groan, and Hermione made a small sound in the back of her throat. Potter glanced down at her and rolled his eyes, saying, “I know, I know. But Andromeda and I agreed that he’s grounded for the entire summer once school lets out.”
“All right, well you survived Hermione, and you’re going to be spending the next month here barring anything unexpected happening. You should know that I’ve blocked the Floo to keep my friends from popping by unexpectedly so you don’t need to feel any more uncomfortable about being here than you already do, and the only part of the house that’s open to Apparition for those who are keyed to the wards as guests is the front hall. Oh, and we’re in London, by the way. About an hour walk away from Diagon Alley, for reference.”
Blinking in bewilderment he simply nodded, and blankly accepted the hug of farewell from Hermione before they both left.
He paused for some immeasurable amount of time near the man’s cock, his face pressed into the curls of dark hair at its base, overwhelmed by the smell of musk, the tang of pre-come heavy in the air. Then he licked a stripe of skin at the junction of his leg and torso, just behind his bollocks, hearing himself groan when the act prompted Potter’s hips to jut sharply into the air and a curse to come tearing out of the man’s mouth.
“So you won’t—oh.” The man frowned, worrying his lip. “Shouldn’t you at least let her know that you’re out of St Mungo’s?”
The light from the mobile returned, though it only captured Potter’s hands which were twisted together in his lap.
“I should have known you’d be a cuddler,” he muttered without energy nor inflection.
Potter had stumbled when they’d landed and Draco could just hear a grumbled, “Bloody hell.”
The infusion worked beautifully with the trunk, and there were no issues at all when they proceeded with their heat shielding tests. After that they continued with some tests of a Disillusionment Charm against some of the sensors that muggles would be using—Draco had no clue how Hermione managed to make the things work in the bowels of the Ministry, of all places—and determined that as long as the Atmospheric Charms didn’t extend outside of the trunk’s interior, the launch should remain undetected. Of course that prompted yet another theory-filled discussion of
Draco, for his part, needed a moment to fully grasp the tightness and heat that was clenching around him. But after a few seconds he started to feel those thoughts surfacing again and he mentally snarled at them and pulled back then thrust hard into Potter, and again, and again.
happened here?”
The sleet continued long into the night and the next morning, only letting up mid-afternoon, and there was quite a mess to clean up that evening before he could continue his work on the addition. On Saturday he worked long hours, managing to finish laying the logs for the walls and Sunday was spent securing the roof extension, and making sure the structure was well-sealed against the elements.
Still chuckling he took a step back to retrieve the fallen mugs and was surprised when Potter’s hand darted out and grabbed his, then sharply pulled him into his arms for a short but searing kiss.
Harry’s other teacher was a woman like the Woods.
. Do not lower yourself and accept their company, and though some will simply tell you to steer clear of people with lesser blood, I’d consider even that limitation too forgiving. You’re a necromancer— even purebloods must
“Now?” Harry squeaked, feeling completely unprepared and out of his element. He didn’t resist when Crabbe pulled him towards the fireplace, but shot his godfather a worried look. He hadn’t come here expecting to be thrust into a conversation with a stranger.
The sprawling fortress had belonged to the Dolohov lineage for centuries, hosting Russia’s finest throughout the times. It was more of a fortress, really, and despite how large it was Harry couldn’t for the life of him remember encountering anyone else but his godfather there.
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Nothing.” Besides, he’d been spending most of his time studying away from home, anyway. It was strange how things had changed. He could now leave Mordred’s Mend as many times as he wanted to, but Lily couldn’t. It used to be the other way around, and Harry never actually thought that they’d reach a point where his mother would be nothing but a living ghost haunting the hallways of her own home.
Uncle Tony’s face twitched into a grimace before he dug out his wand and beckoned Harry closer to the doorway. Without explaining anything, the man tapped the tip of his wand against Harry’s hand, before then waving it in the doorway, muttering something at a volume too low for Harry to hear. It was fairly easy to guess what was happening, however, when what seemed like rippling air manifested at the doorway, before fading back into nothingness again.
“I’m not in a joking mood right now,” Harry said. “You’re not… you can say no. I’m not expecting anything of you, you know.”
Explaining that seemed to tell Nott enough, and the man muttered something under his breath, before speaking again to Antonin. “I can teach him
But most importantly, perhaps, Harry wouldn’t know that this association would inevitably lead him towards a dangerous career full of pain and horror on his end, and fear and respect on everybody else’s. If he reached maturity uninterrupted, no one would dare to oppose him, and he’d serve the Dark Lord as a Death Eater unlike any other.
, hajjah Mansura.”
he thought, wild hope blooming in his heart
”Oh, this is new, too,” Harry observed, walking closer to the stove. ”This isn’t the one you burned my hand on.”
“I don’t think so,” Malfoy argued. “I don’t think anyone with your kind of unhappiness can be understood by means of mere observation. And I feel like an idiot for not realizing that sooner.”
"Yes," Harry agreed, now more interested than before. He wasn't interested in hitting someone in the head, but if he could stop a fight just by making them temporarily unable to cast spells - would that be great?
That… was a really good question. Harry would see James whenever Lily was outside, but it had been a while since he’d seen James indoors. “I don’t— I’m not sure.”
Saturday was a few days away, and all Harry could do was patiently wait while doing his best to not see either one of his parents. He desperately missed fresh air, but didn’t dare to venture out when he knew there’d be no one inside to call him back if he couldn’t return on his own. The Woods were almost as hungry as the House, and he didn’t wish to become nothing but a trail of fading footsteps in the ground.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, unsure if he had been told anything about dorms at Hogwarts. It sounded vaguely familiar, so probably. He hadn’t actually thought about sharing his sleeping space with anyone else before - how could people just fall asleep and trust that no one would attack them? He’d need to ask Uncle Tony about it.
Uncle Tony had, for some reason, come on Sunday to disconnect the fireplace indoors from the Floo Network, choosing to activate the fireplace outdoor. Harry didn’t think his godfather had discussed this with Lily before doing it, but didn’t dare to ask why. He simply accepted it, dreading already the thought of needing to go outside at night if he wanted to go anywhere late.
choice.
and it had just made sense to— to bring him
”Thanks,” Harry said, reluctantly accepting the offered portfolio. ”But, well, let’s leave setting up the next appointment for now? I’d like to, uh, check first when I’m available.”
“What kind of a wand is it?” Uncle Tony asked, eyeing the almost cream-coloured wand with its dark, curling grain. Harry had never seen a wand like it before.
Harry quieted down when he looked at Malfoy again, and saw him looking at Harry with the strangest expression on his face. A curious face, without an ounce of the haughtiness and contempt that was so typical to it. Malfoy was now looking at him in a way that reminded Harry - strangely enough - of Sirius. Something about that look of almost amused wonder, that likely had snuck up on Malfoy’s face uninvited, made Harry’s lungs expand and heart beat faster.
"Neville Longbottom, right?" Harry asked, vaguely remembering the name that had popped up here and there as he'd studied history or read the Daily Prophet. "Will he be at Hogwarts?"
“She just looks at me,” Harry replied. “She never says anything, though.”
“And if he doesn’t?”
been—
“I thought the letter would arrive on my birthday,” Harry continued, picking at the fish on his plate. They were in Manchester, in a restaurant owned by a man Antonin knew to have sympathized with the Dark Lord back in the day. The restaurant was frequented by former Death Eaters, which had kept drawing Aurors for unannounced drop-ins for a long time. Eventually, when nothing suspicious was ever found, the Aurors moved on to other places - or at least became more subtle in their snooping. “But I suppose that wouldn’t make sense, right? I spoke with Mr. Crabbe about Hogwarts a few weeks ago, and they’ve got these Houses— Bellatrix thinks I’ll be a Slytherin, and—”
keep it a secret, Lily. How can he practice and become better if he’s hindered by the need to keep it all a secret?”
“A grown man’s body for an entire week?” Nott murmured, another smile making an appearance. “How extraordinary. What else can he do?”
Nott’s eyes widened, and the smile that appeared on his face was larger than Harry had ever seen it before - almost too wide to fit into his face, but that was of course impossible. The man positively glowed, though he still didn’t take a step away from the cadaver when he said: “Excellent observation!”
? Wasn’t death natural enough to not be treated like a horror?
”What about you, Harry?” Hermione asked. ”Are you sure that you wouldn’t want to go back with Ginny and I?”
He just… he didn’t understand
of his dream. He was in his bed, and—
Miles east of Khoseda-Khardsky was Hillcrest.
“We’ll talk in your office?”
"And then another one of my favourites: the knees," Bellatrix said, now moving the knife lower on the illustration. "Relatively easy to get to - people often forget to protect their legs - yet can throw your opponent off-balance and leave them crawling for safety, unable to attack you or defend themselves against you. They become little more than flies in your spider's web, trying in vain to struggle their way out. Now - questions?"
”That’s good,” Hermione said, pulling him along, back towards the castle. People - Aurors, probably - rushed past them and towards Voldemort’s body. Harry wasn’t sure what they were going to do with it, and he didn’t really want to find out. He was done with his part now, wasn’t he? He was done, and so was everyone else he had dragged with him into this mess. Ron and Hermione could go ahead and live their lives normally from now on, couldn’t they? There would be no need for sneaking around or battling basilisks or breaking out of places on the back of a dragon.
Harry didn’t go to his lesson with Mrs. Goyle. In fact, he didn’t go to his session with Mr. Crabbe either, though perhaps he could’ve.
”—and your mum was the one who dueled her and won.”
In the end, Antonin didn’t have any words with Lily. When he came to Mordred’s Mend on that Saturday morning, the witch was nowhere to be found.
”What is it good for?” the man asked. “While the core origin is interesting, hajjah, how does it behave with magic?”
“Hi,” Harry said, when he entered the cottage and saw Malfoy looking at what appeared to be ten different cabinet handles. Malfoy’s hair was cut short and  gelled back again - as it used to be back in their early years. Somehow, the sight of it took Harry back to better days, and the happy moments he had had in the past. There was good in his life, wasn’t there? Despite everything that had happened, it hadn’t been all bad, right?
He’d been more than decent.
But then he swiftly dismissed the thought, because of course people were going to judge him for his name, whether it was because of his own actions or those of his father. That was just the way things were, and would be.
Potter’s eyes immediately widened in alarm and his wand was in his hand an instant later. “That’s a good point. I’ll do it—what were the spells?”
So with that safe topic selected they made their way back along what was turning into a path with their regular use of the same route through the trees, as Draco described the end-of-winter activities when living in a forest.
A minute later he was tying back his tangles of wet hair and looking out the open door to see Potter still just standing there, as if his brain had leaked out of his ears.
“I know you refused one last year, but you were also miserable all winter.”
“And you’re telling me that you don’t have pretentious food when
And then he felt fingers threading into his hair and he couldn’t help but allow a small smile to form on his lips.
Draco nodded. “You’re still welcome to stop by,” he said, unable to help himself. Potter chewed on his lip and looked down, so Draco added, “I’d like you to stop by.”
“I promise you,” he continued, “that yes, it was a stupid mistake, but I have no intention of endangering myself with these tests. The whole reason for the tests is so that I can anticipate and prevent anything bad happening when I head up there. I’m sorry I worried you, but it was not intentional, I assure you.”
He also wrote to Nimbus, ordering a dozen brooms and requesting a safety manual to include a listing of any enchantments already on them.
Draco replied, “Absolutely not,” at the same time that Potter firmly said, “Yes.” He looked at the other man with a brow raised.
While everyone else was gathering plates Potter stepped back from the group and asked quietly, “All right?”
Draco nodded. “You’d mentioned.”
Of course she was already several steps ahead of him and produced a list of her own, which he pinned to the wall above his bookcase. The next several hours vanished amid a discussion of all manner of scientific detail, past space missions, and muggle space engineering. It wasn’t until the light outside was beginning to dim and Vince started making noises about going out for a fly that he realised how long they’d been at it.
“Yeah.”
He didn’t know how to acknowledge the words, on one hand agreeing them but on the other not wanting to face the reality of his current feelings about Potter. But then his silence dragged on for long enough that it was an acknowledgment in and of itself, so instead he let out a small sigh and reached his arm around Potter, holding him against his side.
“Potter.” The other man had been watching him the entire time, a frown permanently affixed to his face. “Catch.”
Vince shifted restlessly on his perch as he did when he was ready for a hunt, so Draco opened the door again and watched as his friend set off into the night.
Once the brewing station had been tidied up he leaned back against the table.
The hand that wasn’t in his found the part of his leg just above his knee, not sliding higher, but the possibility of it stoked the fire that was building in Draco, one which had been collecting its kindling for months—for years, if he was honest—but which had never even considered igniting until now. He let out an involuntary groan, parting his lips and Potter didn’t hesitate to deepen the kiss, the taste and smell of ouzo filling his senses as a hot tongue slid against his own, awakening every nerve in his body. Then it retreated, only to suck his bottom lip into that warm mouth and bite on it with a sting of his teeth.
There was a definite hesitation, and he was mildly curious about what sort of expression or gesture the man was doing behind his back, but a few seconds later he heard footsteps then the door closed.
“I know that I have always put so much pressure on you, so many expectations. Know that I only want you to be happy.” She reached up and rested her cool hand against his cheek, and held it there for a moment before reclaiming it. Then she set off down the lane.
“You didn’t actually think that would happen, did you?” he asked, his tone strangely pensive.
He swallowed, then tilted his head down to meet Potter’s intent gaze.
The last two things he saw before the whirl of the Portkey were a flash and Potter’s brilliant smile.
He realised that he was gripping that hand just as hard.
“The way Minerva tells it, he arranged for his friends in the other houses to help cover for him. And his house mates swear they thought he was in the Hospital Wing.”
There was a pause as Potter took another gulp of port, then resumed his retelling of the events. “I was probably about eighty feet away from you at that point and the brooms were pretty slow in the water, so I Apparated to you. And you were completely out, so I disengaged your Sticking Charms and Apparated you to St Mungos. Then I had to yell a bunch to get you seen right away, since you didn’t even look like you were
, we need to factor that in!”
And then Tuesday arrived, and Draco found himself feeling bereft. He certainly didn’t miss the stupid classes, and he enjoyed the solitude, but at the same time he wasn’t able to immerse himself in his reading, nor did a long hike around the woods help to assuage his listlessness. On Wednesday he felt much the same, and ended up heading out in the snow to the forest’s edge to collect some rose hips and haws, spending much of the rest of the day preparing them to be dried for lack of anything else to do.
Draco shook his head. “No. I can’t seem to sleep in this chair anymore because of my shoulders. I’ve been spending the nights out in the clearing.”
Potter muttered something that sounded like, “As good as,” then stomped away from the cabin.
“Did you ever meet Andromeda? Before?”
Unable to summon forth any words Draco nodded, and grabbed his coat. As he prepared to Disapparate he heard the words, “Later, Draco,” and then he was standing on his front step shivering from something other than the cold.
Draco frowned, then looked at him closely. “Potter. You always wanted to be an Auror. Everyone in school knew it, the amount you went on and on about it. What’s the problem?”
“They were,” he agreed quietly, carefully. Despite being on this assignment since March and being partners for nearly a year, this was somehow the first reference to . . . before. He'd been dreading the inevitable moment that it would happen. Because it was bound to; their histories were too completely entwined for it to not.
He finished his line, tucked the pencil away in his shirt pocket, then rose to his feet and met the man’s gaze. “Of course I am. It’s fucking December.”
Draco gave a small nod, his shoulders tight. “I’ll see you in under an hour, I expect.”
A few bites in, he hummed in appreciation. “This is wonderful.”
, for fuck’s sake.” There was a slight tremor to his voice and Draco swallowed, still staring at the red liquid in his glass.
Draco blinked. “I repeat: we’re going to die.”
“Really?” he asked as he followed, then Hermione led him down a corridor, across a strange, spinning room, along a complex series of more corridors, until they arrived at a small office. Once they were inside she shut the door and took off her winter attire.
“Seemed about the same as the broom,” Potter continued, gesturing. “I did a few comparisons while I waited.”
“Oh, don’t worry about that.” Then she was digging through her bag and removing enough equipment to set up three decent stations. “I’ll let you arrange those the way you prefer. And if you’d like to make a list of ingredients I can pop back up here to pick it up before I head out later this afternoon.”
“Would you be able to bring it up here without being noticed by any of Potter’s guests?”
There was an odd sound on the other side of the cabin and he glanced over his shoulder to see Potter giving Vince some owl treats. He didn’t own any treats, so the man must have brought them. Draco swallowed hard and looked back out the window, not wanting to think about that.
There was a murmur of a
“The wall is wood. It’ll come down.” He looked at the section of wall that he’d be removing, and Potter followed his gaze.
Swing.
Draco made a non-committal sound, not really having anything to say to that. It wasn’t as though he really knew any of them. So instead he asked Potter about his friends, letting him talk for the both of them.
“Er, Malfoy. It’s me.”
Draco sighed deeply and then looked up toward the owl that was still staring at him. “No response.”
“He’s not
Vince let out a long hoot, giving him a look.
When it had been seven days since Potter’s last visit he was awoken from his afternoon nap by the crack of Apparition from outside, which was followed by some irritated barks and growls from Vince. Sweeping his hair up into a knot he rose from his chair and swung open the door.
He spun around and pointed his spoon at Potter, ignoring as it dripped red splotches onto his bare feet. “No. I’m not talking about that with you. I’m not talking about any of it. You want to talk brooms? Fine. I want to experiment with a broom for a personal project. I expect I’ll break many brooms in the process. I might as well purchase several in one go, rather than ordering one at a time. But, if that’s what I need to do because of my status, then that’s what I’ll do.” And he turned back to his soup.
“They do,” Potter agreed just as quietly, reaching across the few inches that separated them and letting his hand rest next to Draco’s, their fingers just barely touching.
Vince let out an annoyed bark.
“That’s good,” he forced out, not looking over. He was drying his mug, which he usually left out to air dry, and soon would run out of things to ostensibly keep him busy in this part of the cabin.
They stood in silence for another minute, then there was movement next to him and a hand reached over and took his. He stopped breathing.
He was just making his way back to the cabin after another night spent in the clearing, shivering slightly at the dampness of his clothes following some overnight drizzle, when the crack of Apparition interrupted his grumbling to Vince. After exchanging a frown with the owl he hurried his pace, his eyes widening when he spotted Potter waiting on his front step.
Somewhere behind him he could hear Potter swallowing hard, likely having knocked back what was left of his drink.
There was movement next to him and Potter sank onto his own towel, extending his legs ahead of him and holding out a pair of glasses that he must have grabbed. Draco poured a measure into each then took one of them after he’d screwed the lid back on the bottle and set it aside.
At some point Potter managed to release his hair from its tie and was running his hands through it, and Draco felt himself smirking. “You seem to enjoy my hair,” he murmured against the man’s mouth, before releasing his hand from its tight grip to instead slide it under his shirt, pressing against the warm skin of his lower back.
“Thank you for inviting me. Even with how much I fought you about it—it wasn’t terrible.”
“I just mean, you do other things without magic. As far as I’ve seen, anyway. Like the woodcutting, and the jam. And drying yourself off when you were wet. Because of the rain, that time,” the man babbled.
Draco awoke at dawn, more out of habit than anything, and slowly sat up. He probably had a bit under an hour until Hermione arrived, and he had seen a bathroom a few doors down the hallway. The moment he stood from the bed there was a quiet pop near the door.
He was faintly aware of Potter murmuring something in his ear, the little puffs of air brushing against cheek and neck. But there were no words, only the rumble that travelled from his chest as he spoke, his embrace surrounding Draco with an anchoring warmth. Needing to feel and not think Draco clutched onto him tighter and sought his lips, letting out a pitiful whine that at any other time would have brought him shame but at this moment he only cared about
Draco finished the second hole as Potter rounded the corner, so he took a few minutes to smooth a few relatively straight branches with his knife, cutting away the little twigs and any remaining leaves.
“No.”
Potter blinked a few times, his hand come up to his hair, and stammered, “Er, tomorrow. Sunday roast at the Weasleys’. Well, and yesterday too.”
Draco swallowed and looked away, hating the thought of needing to be near another person constantly for a whole month. He liked his cabin. He liked his quiet forest.
Draco looked over and met Hermione’s gaze through the window and gestured for her to enter.
Potter proceeded to tell him the tale behind each of the child-made ornaments, and each one did have its own special story, amazingly enough. There was a light in his eyes that Draco only saw when he spoke of his godson Teddy, or of Weasley’s son Eddie, and he also learned of the children of that Delacour girl and one of the older Weasley siblings, and another Weasley’s adopted daughter, and the twins of yet another Weasley sibling, and so many more.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco asked, setting down his mug and flicking at some of the crumbs that were left on his plate.
He stared at the letter for several minutes, wondering what would happen if he simply sent it back. When he heard a bark from that snooty owl he rolled his eyes and cracked the seal to reveal the flowing script within.
“Right. I suppose that doesn’t make up for my behaviour.”
He shook his head. “I think Mother wrote her letters, sometimes. But she never really spoke of either of her sisters . . . before. And then, well. The War happened.”
place in
Vince perched on the windowsill, watching Draco through the sheet of water that ran past him.
He started to ascend, squinting upward, looking for signs of faint daylight filtering in through the water. But the water remained dark, after he’d ascended what surely should have been the majority of the distance to the surface. Even the light of his wand was dimming, in fact, and he blinked rapidly to try to bring the area above him into focus. Or was it above him?
he was coming apart, but it was too late, he was in too deep, and with that realisation he was suddenly coming harder than he knew was possible, the beautiful man wringing every drop of come from him.
“This is Master Harry Potter’s home.”
“Malfoy?”
A moment later an ancient-looking house-elf appeared carrying a tray bearing tumblers and a dark glass bottle, setting it down on the coffee table. Then he popped back out after a wide-eyed look at Draco.
Draco turned toward him, his mouth opening to speak but not finding any words.
“He seemed out of sorts today,” he said, and heard Vince clicking from his spot at the window. “I hope he finds his brain before his next visit, otherwise progress will be unbearably slow.”
The next day brought an incredibly boring lecture on home electronics, which must have been copied directly from the lesson Fry had given on the subject back in May since there were several terrible jokes shared that Draco
“I was able to get the information you wanted from one of the designers who was around back when the 2001 came out. So we can go over—would you look at me?” The last words came out in an exasperated huff.
He stood, brushing dust from his trousers. “Is everyone gone then?”
The last thing of Potter that he saw that evening was a glare before he turned back toward the wood stove, his shoulders only relaxing when he heard the door close followed by the sound of Disapparition.
“You missed out on some entertainment today, Vince,” he announced after he’d pushed the door open and shut himself inside the warm room. “Potter was so confused about everything that he forgot to be furious.”
“What are we doing here,” he asked flatly.
“Hmm. At least we’ve got the portrait locked away.” And without explaining what
Then his hand rose to rake nervously through his hair and Draco couldn’t help but allow a small smile to escape, a fond tendril of warmth curling through him.
“He really should get rid of half of this junk,” she said with a moue of distaste. “
She smiled pleasantly and said in a light tone, “Thank you, Draco. Now, I’ve already configured the chamber to test high levels of heat. You said that the Nimbus 2001 is graded to 800 degrees, but those tests were performed almost twenty years ago with different testing standards, so we’ll want to see just how accurate that is. Then we’ll want to see just how powerful the strongest shields can handle the temperatures you’ll be facing in the hottest parts of the atmosphere, and beyond even that because energy transfer at reentry will mean might higher temperatures. Finally, those principles will be applied to a broom to determine how well the additional shields synergise with the heat protection that is already present.”
That night Draco dreamed of glimmering golden light, and green eyes, and warm smiles, and awoke covered in sweat, his quilt tented.
Draco stood there feeling horribly trapped for about a minute before he could do anything more than blink. Releasing a shuddering breath he slumped backward against his small kitchen work space, clutching the edge of the counter behind him.
“She did?” A pause, and Draco could imagine the face he was making, then, “Wait,
Draco’s airway tightened uncomfortably.
Draco didn’t bother to hide his doubt at that bold statement.
Granger was already pulling a small notebook and a biro out of her bag. “That’s a good start. What about discretion for your launch? If you don’t plan for that I can guarantee that certain nations will think that the UK is launching a missile and you might start World War Three.”
Draco bend down to retrieve the bottle of oil, then looked for his wand where he’d dropped it, frowning when it wasn’t there. Then he noticed that his wand was securely tucked into an inner pocket of his coat, where he’d put it earlier that day.
“I remember coming here a few times when I was young. Before my grandaunt passed. The house looks much less . . . sinister now than I remember.”
Potter’s nostrils flared, and Draco watched in interest as he seemed to be already working himself up into a lather. “Yeah, well, that was before you took it upon yourself to assault a perfectly good broom.”
Draco explained, and soon they were embroiled in a lively discussion about the possible ways to circumvent the issues they kept experiencing with Extension Charms. Before he knew it there was a brief knock on the door and the sun had dipped quite a bit lower in the sky.
The next thing he knew he was being wrapped up in the man’s warm embrace, a tangle of sweaty limbs sprawled across the length of the sofa, the heady smell of sex surrounding them.
Now that he was looking at Potter, truly seeing him for what felt like the first time, he found himself captivated. His green eyes were more alive than he’d ever noticed before, brightened by the flush of heat and alcohol in the man’s cheeks, and Draco took a sip of his mead, unable to look away as he swallowed. He could lose himself in those eyes, came the sinuous thought, and he swallowed again, feeling too warm.
up since I’m sure the light will be terrible underwater. Maybe you should follow along a little above me to keep an eye on things?”
“Did you do anything to the broom? Where exactly has it been between last week and today?”
Potter’s head flipped to face him and their eyes met.
Draco nodded, focusing on the even lines he was drawing.
He snorted, somehow managing to be surprised that the man hadn’t noticed a great bloody table missing from the largest room of the house.
Then he made his way down to the ground floor, Potter trailing behind him.
“Pool?” Potter said sometime later.
He made to step away but Potter caught his arm. “Hey. I know what we said, but I can join you. If you want.”
“But—but that’s Malfoy! It’s different!”
Potter let out a gusty exhale and shoved his hands in his pockets, kicking at the floor with a foot a few times before looking back up at him. “Not really, no. I’d make the same decision again. I just—I didn’t do it because I don’t care about what you want. I did it because I’m worried that something bad will happen. And I didn’t want to just ignore that worry, and regret it for the rest of my life when something bad actually
“Hmm.” Those hands continued their ministrations. “That rash doesn’t seem to have faded.”
“Stay,” the man said. “For a bit longer.”
“What did you tell her?” Draco asked quietly, past a knot in his throat.
“It’s not a break. I’ll have finished my year of classes by then.” When Potter’s mouth rounded in an ‘oh’ of understanding Draco added, “So after that I’ll be keeping busy around here. If I’m not home when you Apparate in, either holler or wait. I’ll be around.”
disclosing. So. What were you planning on adding to the brooms?”
When they arrived back at the cabin Potter kissed him hard against the front door, then released him, then said his small, “Later, Draco,” and Disapparated without another word.
And yet, here it was, that moment. And it was fine. Better than fine, actually, given that Potter had strangely invited him to share in his reminiscence.
“Potter,” he said in greeting, giving a particularly large icicle a thump with his fist.
The room was silent but for their loud breathing.
“Yeah. Eddie’s two. Always laughing. He’s a sweetheart. They’ve been trying for a second.” And Draco knew without looking over that Potter was smiling.
Three more months of learning how to live alongside a different type of people.
“Ready?” Potter asked and he nodded, then an instant later they were standing in a drawing room that contained a very tall Christmas tree.
“No worries. Ron convinced Susan that she didn’t need to barge up here and investigate, or call in her bloody partner. Luna left with the three of them about ten minutes ago. Elliott’s been loitering in the front hall—is he heading home with you today?”
they were going to get around the blasted Extension Charm problem, which became so convoluted that Potter finally interrupted to demand that they at least try something rather than talk at each other all day, which resulted in another exploded trunk.
Their mouths met in a clashing of teeth and tongues, and Draco could faintly hear the clink of one of the mugs being kicked across the room as he pushed Potter backward, their feet knocking together. He felt the other man’s groan in his bones when they impacted against the far wall and Draco pushed closer still, his thigh pressing firmly between two legs, the bulge of a hardening erection digging into his hip.
“Is this . . . okay?” The words were hesitant, almost shy.
Then he crossed his arms and ordered, “Go inside where it’s dry and warm, for fuck’s sake Malfoy.”
Finally Potter finished his tea and they set off, taking a moment to retrieve the brooms he’d left propped up against the outside wall. The snow was still falling gently in large clumps but the temperature was rather mild, and the blanket of snow on the ground had a muffling effect on the sounds of the forest.
“I’m fairly certain that’s something you can have back home.”
Draco clenched his jaw, feeling his back stiffen even more as he contemplated the horrible thought of being trapped around so many people, all of whom absolutely had every reason to despise him. It would be just as much a reminder of his past failures as seeing his mother would be, though in a very different way.
He was surprised by the apology, but rather than show it he simply tilted his head and asked, “Are you actually sorry?”
Because beyond the troll leg and the house-elf heads there was also what appeared to be a family of stuffed puffskeins, a case full of doxies that looked like they’d been plucked or shaved, a mounted niffler, and what looked frighteningly like an erumpent head, most alarmingly still with its horn intact.
On Monday after class he busied himself mashing the majority of the berries with his mortar and pestle before slopping the mess into his saucepan, setting it to bubble away with some sugar, salt, and a few other additions on the wood stove.
“It’s just me,” he heard Potter say, his voice laced with weariness. “Ron’s gone. Sorry you were ambushed like that.”
“I’m not doing this so that I can die, Potter. If I wanted that I wouldn’t bother will all of this spellwork. I wouldn’t even bother with the brooms, actually. There are plants in these woods that I could eat with far less effort.”
Well, he could Disapparate but he knew that it would upset not only Potter but also Hermione. And ultimately it would not be worth all of the shouting that would ensue from one of them, nor the threats from the other.
Potter’s eyes snapped open and he made a pained expression, then hung his head. “Yeah, I guess that’s for the best. I’ll show you to your room, then.”
And his emotions hurt so bloody much. He could feel them clawing at him, the turbulent fear of leaving behind the known for the unknown, the guilt over leaving behind Harry bloody Potter, after he dared to make Draco actually
And that more or less set the tone for the week.
“Three times per week,” he said flatly, not bothering with a greeting.
That sounded awful, but then again so was Draco’s mistake. “Pretty much.”
“Malfoy! Are you—what happened!?” Potter gasped after he’d barged into the room.
He was just hesitating before putting on the garment when Potter said, both sounding like the word was a question and at the same time not, “Stay?”
And the something that was tucked away inside Draco, the part of him that used to
The next hour, two hours, possibly even longer passed in exploration of various shipwrecks, some deep enough in the underwater gullies that the only light was that of his wand. It was eerily quiet, and a few times Draco would fly around a wall of kelp to find himself face to face with a fish. After withdrawing from one kelp-covered gully he decided that he was satisfied with the enchantments and that there had been enough testing for the day, since his hips and shoulders were beginning to ache from the amount of effort it was taking to direct the broom.
The next morning Draco sent off a note to Potter telling him to not return that week, since he needed to do some more research before applying the next batch of enchantments. It wasn’t quite true, since he could begin his work on adjusting the steering and braking to rely more heavily on magic and less on air resistance and gravity, but he needed some time and space to get his brain working properly again.
“Call me Bella.”
"Solar plexus," Bellatrix then said. "Hard to hit, but effective in knocking the wind out of your opponents. Great for cutting curses - aim here to make sure they won't stand up again. The liver is also a good place to take aim at, especially if you wish to cause long-term damage. The groin is excellent for immediate distraction, although if you wish to make them hurt while still leaving them with hope of survival, a cutting curse there too will do a trick - and not just for men, baby."
The denial could’ve lasted longer, but the moment they had both placed their orders - or rather: Harry had told his godfather what he wanted, who then relayed that to the waitress - Uncle Tony said: “We need to talk about Lily.”
Not that he had been to Hillcrest often. Even when his parents had been both present, he had rarely been allowed out of Mordred’s Mend, easily spending years never stepping a foot into another place. He had certainly never visited his godfather’s residence enough to get used to the large, dark place with its warm torches and wooden walls.
”Harry, let’s get you to the hospital wing,” Hermione said, taking a hold of Harry’s arm. The sight of that dark, familiar hand with its neat pink nails made Harry want to cry, because she was alive, and so was Ron, and so was he, and how unbelievable was
“No,” Uncle Tony said, walking down one of the alleyways, clearly with a destination in mind. “Do not confuse their desire to keep their secrets as lack of welcome towards visitors – they are very welcoming people, open to the world and its wonders.”
“I get you, mate,” Ron said, nodding. “Have you thought about doing what Malfoy is doing, and just completing what little you have left at another school? Could be easier than going back to where everything happened.”
sometimes—
”Is he dead?” someone else, a bit to the left, was screaming. ”Is he really dead?”
“You can stop staring, Potter,” Malfoy snapped, his cheeks pink all of a sudden. “And do follow - I said I wanted to show you the fireplace, didn’t I?”
"Well, it's small but enough for me."
“You can do things others can’t,” Lily had told him often. “So you must learn how to control your magic in ways other people can’t.”
“Why would he need a therapist, then?” Dolohov asked. “If it’s a matter of him finding more people to talk with, why not just introduce him to your kid and the blond brat with him?”
“But we want Hogwarts for Harry. Not Durmstrang.”
made him
By Monday, James was missing both of his arms, large patches of his grey skin, and there seemed to be some sort of... green infestation growing across his body. Not that Lily noticed anything, if the sounds coming from the master bedroom were an indication. Often Harry wondered what was it exactly that his mother saw when she looked at James. Then he shuddered and was glad that he didn’t share the misled sight, before opting to decisively not think about his father. It was... too confusing. Complicated. Tough.
'Best idea you had in a while, love.' Draco said, 'So you going to tell me how you knew or what?'
'No need to be sarcastic - just thought you'd get an owl.'
She couldn't work out for the life of her what she had woken up for. Aria could understand waking up for a nightmare, but waking up for no reason, and why did it suddenly feel cold? Aria pulled her covers in an attempt to warm herself, falling backward to lay upon her bed once more. She forced her eyes shut, but Aria knew as with the many nights before, that sleep would not come. There was only so much one could do to make themselves fall asleep again, and Aria had tried everything she could think of, including doing her homework. There was only so much homework she could do before her brain decided to explode from an information overload.
A couple days later, Aria had enough, it was becoming an effort just to get out of bed. She felt groggy, she was struggling to eat. So Aria was sure that Mrs Weasley was onto something because she did not feel at all right.
'Yes, I know.' Aria answered simply, it was all that it required, they were after all talking about the same person. A person that she now actually knew, not the stuck-up idiot that thought he owned the ground he walked on ... well, Draco still did walk like that - but Aria tended to roll her eyes when it happened.
'He didn't like it -' Hermione said, she was no longer looking at the picture, 'I remember the look upon his face - he didn't want us to be tortured.'
Aria looked up from the desk of the small room she had been using for an office, unicorn hairs and feathers laid out on the desk in front of her.
will endeavor to be at Privet Drive at nine o'clock, the morning we leave.
'Sneaky?'
........
And she had called him Draco, as she had spoken - she had not used Malfoy. He wondered if she was beginning to sense their compatible magic or if it had just been a coincidence, after all, she had been using his first name in conversations for a while now.
Yours Sincerely,
'Dra-'
'We'll leave you peace,' Weasley's mother said, getting up, breaking the silence, 'I'm glad it's all cleared up Aria, we shall see you for dinner Saturday.'
"Yes, I can, thank you, My Lord." Aria said and added thoughtfully, "though Draco is more than capable at demonstrating if it is required and I would not dare tutor anyone without his presence."
'I've been meaning to ask,' Hermione said, 'where did you get Epsilon's name from? You got Hedwig's from History of Magic - but you never took Arithmancy and I know it has a mathematical meaning -'
Draco glanced around, to the voice in question, just moments ago Aria had left with Weasley for Gryffindors last practice before the holidays, and now Granger was speaking to him out of the blue like they had been lifetime friends.
Aria swayed a little on their landing, looked a little pale, and gave Draco a look of sheer dislike. Which soon changed the moment Draco opened his wings, Aria's mouth fell open. Draco had taken them to a large house in the countryside, it was nowhere near as big as the Malfoy Manor, but it was still elegant in its own right.
'Hello, Aria.'
'I think it's silly, so you lost in the last round.' Aria said after a few moments, 'You came second, that isn't a bad thing. It shows how talented you are, even though you didn't win. It proved how much knowledge you knew -'
"What's that got to do with anything?"
'Explains - a lot.' Aria said, 'his family doesn't seem to think much of me - well his cousins at least Mr Malfoy ... he's been rather odd.'
'Arm,' Aria said, gesturing with her hand for him to hand it over. Draco looked at her skeptically, he sighed and held it out for her.
Draco's wings opened up, though he did not retract them, flexing his wings, he felt rather sore. 'Lead the way, my lady, I can't let you out of my sight right now.' Aria raised her eyebrows. 'It's a Veela thing.'
'Scorpius, why is your dad referring to your mum by her previous last name, I'm a little confused by it.' The whispered question attracted both his own and his wife's attention, the girl his son had brought along with him, Adelaide seemed generally surprised and gulped a little. 'Sorry.'
'I came across something toxic -' Aria said,
'Pleasure to meet you, Miss Reyes.'
'Yeah,' Aria said, lowering the wand, 'it works. Sorry.'
'Can't!'
Draco pulled at the towel within her hands, shaking his head at her, Aria just pulled the towel away from him, frowning at him, 'I just figured out why your hair is so messy ... do you not care about -'
'I think most of us do,' Blaise replied, 'Potter - the odds - and still she managed to beat him- Pansy regrets it most - after speaking out in the Great Hall.'
Aria did not recognize herself the morning of September first. She was dressed in the finest robes. Her trunk that she had left behind at Hogwarts when she had been kidnapped from the Ministry had been searched through and returned to her when it seemed that it held nothing of value. Draco had proven himself to be completely cunningly resourceful; his success had returned her invisibility cloak and the Marauder's Map.
The remembrance of the battle of Hogwarts was being held outside on the school grounds, and the day itself was crisp and clear, the only upside was that classes had been cancelled for the day. Aria stared at herself in the mirror, her dress robes were a light shade of blue, but it was not the dress she was taking any notice of what she had pulled out of her trunk. She was too busy taking deep breaths, and her death-like grip on the sides of the sink had not faltered. It felt so much like September first all over again, but today ... the anniversary of the battle Hogwarts, she felt like she was battling hard with herself ... her thoughts and emotions were all over the place but if she didn't make attempts to accept the fact that it was not her fault, then the guilt would always eat away at her.
'Like the Shielding Charm -' George said, 'it's basically a Shield Hat or Cloak, like the ones we-I have got in store.'
'My grandmother is lovely, my grandfather... I don't think you would have liked very much.' Draco said, 'Father shared his views -'
'Wow ... we're what .. a week in and you already know my story,' Aria said, shaking her head, 'just not who I am.'
Granger had not missed it then either.
Hermione gave her a small smile, and continued on with her homework, acting as nothing had happened. Ron however, was wearing the expression as though he was still trying to figure out something but settled upon saying nothing.
'Sounds sensible ...' Hermione reasoned.
'You dare tell me to calm down ... when you've caused all this!' Draco ragged, tackling Cygnus, making them both tumble to the ground. In his rage, Draco had forgotten all about his cousins' wand. The only thing holding Draco back from tearing his cousin apart was the very fact Aria would never forgive him, something that Cygnus took to his advantage in the next instant as his cousin also transformed and Draco was flung away from Cygnus.
'Weasley's theory, again,' Draco huffed, 'Compatible magic does not work like that, and if Weasley had any sense.'
Aria released the breath she hadn't been aware she was holding. Today she was finally returning to the wizarding world and she was not looking forward to being swarmed by a mass of people.
'I'm fine,' Aria told her. Aria was sure if Epsilon could she would look at her as though she knew better. Because who was Aria trying to kid, she was far from fine. She felt weak, her head was pounding, she couldn't stop shivering, and she was far from feeling cold. Epsilon jumped up onto Aria's bed, made her way across the covers, and settled upon Aria's lap, as though trying to offer her some warmth and comfort. Aria reached out a hand and stroked her behind her ear, 'Thank you.'
'With pleasure.'
'What was she thinking? Agreeing to marry someone like him-'
Potter was a completely different person when she was on her own. Or had he just not noticed how shy and reserved she could be. Or her sweet nature, or how her eyes light up as she tried to take in her surroundings all at once. And Potter said that he had lived a sheltered life!
'It's just so simple Lucius; I feel like I've not done enough, that I should be doing more -'
'Aria, lovely to see you,' his mother welcomed her, 'has Draco told you about the ball we are holding in honour of your engagement?'
Every step towards the end of the aisle was taken with ease, Aria forced herself to keep her breathing calm even though her heart was racing. And when Draco faced her as she met him at the alter Aria felt overwhelmed as Draco's stormy grey eyes met hers. She remembered repeating words when she was asked to, but she couldn't remember much else, for it did not matter at that moment.
'Don't mother me or I'll bring out the baby photographs.'
Adelaide giggled, 'I like the sound of him already.'
'Why are you doing this?' Aria said softly her eyes closed, another frown reached her face, 'If it wasn't for the fact I can tell you mean me no harm, I wouldn't let you ...'
That was another thing he liked about her - they had the same mannerisms. Not that Aria had noticed it yet - but they did both like to use their hands while they spoke to make their point. But he couldn't help the spring in his step - she had been with anyone like that, just like him.
Draco ran a hand through his hair, it was the only thing that made sense, and if that was the case then he really needed to get hold of Aria. He had to make her understand - they had no other option, what options were open to him when the person whose magic was compatible with his own, disliked him. She even admitted that she ... oh Merlin, she had said that she would have heard them out. Should they have done things differently? Knowing what he now had learned about Aria, the answer was very clear, yes they should have.
.........
'Well enjoy yourself!' Ginny said.
Draco groaned and turned over onto his stomach, for the life of him he couldn't find a comfortable position so he could fall asleep. His back ached ... his mind wouldn't shut off. Though he wasn't a master at Occlumency, he at least knew how to apply the principles to shut his mind off.
Draco frowned, but seemed happy with her explanation, 'It doesn't answer everything else though - at why they cared more about the dog than you - you could have been seriously hurt.'
"What's the catch?" Aria said as Draco placed the tray of food down upon a table beside her chair. "Why are you not just killing me."
But Dudley shrugged her off. 'I was just going to ask him to help me with the bags, that's all.'
'Where is Potter anyway, I thought her nose would be stuck in some book, I swear your girlfriend has turned into Granger.'
'What possessed you to try and clean Sirius's room anyway?' Hermione said rolling her eyes. She clearly had sensed it was time to change the subject.
Draco does everything in his power to stop his trembling form. Kneeling at the feet of The Dark Lord on Christmas eve. He waits for the command, extending his arm. Pain like no other serges through him. It is by sheer willpower Draco does not scream. He thinks of Aria the whole time.
Draco smirked, no he did not want Aria to change for anything.
'What happened then?- Why are you here?'
'It's a husky.' Aria said, willing her best friend to understand, and fortunately, they had been friends long enough for Ron to get the message.
"There is no plan Ron!" Aria said firmly.
It was official, the students of Hogwarts hated him, and they had no problems in proving their point to Draco. He was subjected to receiving nasty hexes and pranks. And it was only the day after Aria had shouted at him after their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Draco suspected more to come. Draco was frustrated and angry, it was none of the other students' business what had gone on. How did Aria cope in the past with every pair of eyes that she came across, looking at her in disgust? How the tables had now turned.
'Yeah ... it can get like that sometimes.' Aria said, 'It still has the ability to surprise and amaze me.'
'Draco! Draco!'
'They got what they deserved, talking to you like that -'
'If it's not about Malfoy, what is it about then?' Ron said.
'Cheers Addey, great help you are.'
'His magic,' Draco said, giving a shudder at the thought of it, 'it's similar to my own ... which makes his compatible ...'
'No,' Aria shook her head, disbelieving her, Draco raised his eyebrows into a questioning look, 'Yes - it doesn't matter - can we just leave it -I've had a bad enough of a week as it is.'
"She is my friend," Draco said.
'I've remembered every wand I've sold so far. Birch, dragon heartstring core, ten and a quarter inches, slightly supple, excellent for Charms, correct?'
Aria spun around laughing childishly, 'this is brilliant ... I was so disappointed when I heard the forecast.' her face screwed up a little before she laughed again, 'I can't believe you made it snow ... for me.'
Lily clapped her hands together, 'Do it anyway mum!'
Draco was glad when the site tour came, even if he had to get into another damn aeroplane first. Draco had the advantage though when they landed in Rome, thanks to several years of sharing a dorm with Blaise Zabini he had picked up Italian. It seemed though he wasn't the only one who knew the language, Emily did also.
'Any shivers? Headaches ... feeling drained.'
'Hello, Aria.'
'I did not hide.' Aria corrected, 'I went out - just not where the wizarding community could mob me.'
'So, up until I've asked pretty natural questions - your gender, if you like Quidditch, what team you support, if you have siblings or not, and each time different houses have stepped into the center square ... have you noticed that different Hogwarts houses members have been in the middle, so, let's see what happens when we get a bit more personal with the questions.' Aria paused looking around, 'Enter the center square if the first time you ever heard of Hogwarts and magic was when you received your acceptance letter.'
Draco huffed, there was still so much Aria had to learn about Veela. 'I can't move - not until you tell me your OK - I reacted because you were - you would have been hurt.'
'Oh,' Potter said turning her head to the direction of a house. 'I'll get it, put my bags in would you.' she turned back towards Draco. 'I'll be back in a minute. Just put your bag in the boot.' and went off into the house.
'There's no way I'm doing that!' Aria said. 'This bracelet is the only thing that's allowing me any peace or quiet.'
'But you said that they hadn't spoken in years - because of - you know - the Muggle-born.'
Potter patted his arm, 'You'll have to forgive him,' she said towards her cousin and his girlfriend, so sweetly and almost innocent-like, but Draco was not fooled by it for a moment, 'he's lived a rather sheltered life. Poor thing has never seen or been on an aeroplane before.'
'Oh, you should know,' Aria said she supposed she should tell them both now, 'I'm going away for a couple of weeks with a few of my Muggles friends,' well her cousin and his girlfriend, but she didn't need to tell Malfoy that, 'in about two weeks time. I hope that won't be a problem.'
'I just thought it was a cold or something ...'
Draco placed Aria's sleeping form into his arms. They had spent the day avoiding The Dark Lord by trying to study. Though Aria kept getting distracted by the gardens. She had a wistful look on her face every time she looked out of the window. He carried her along the corridors of the Manor, towards his suite.
The accusing tone in her voice was back.
'You were scared?'
Of course, he would find that interesting. Smug git.
'All finished,' Draco breathed against Aria's ear.
His grandmother returned to watching the gathering with interest, Aria was currently speaking with his mother. 'I like her, Aria is a little unusual ... she has an air about her -'
'I had to put up with them snogging in front of me most of the summer ... or running off to snog each other, it's not that I mind, and it's been a long time overdue but I'm their friend, not something I wanna see or hear about.'
Aria nodded, 'Yeah, it's how wands are made, the core has to be compatible with the type of the tree used. That's why there are so many combinations -'
There was a gasp, as Aria entered the square last, making the magic square line turn green.
"Like we told you, yes."
Aria took a deep breath before shutting the train door behind her. It had taken at least half an hour just to get through the crowd of people. She heaved her trunk along the corridor and slid open the last compartment door in the hopes that she would find one of her friends.
I'm sorry Ron.
'I'd forgotten about that,' Ron admitted, 'Does he know?'
'If you have ever been bullied, whether before Hogwarts or during your time here - step into the square.'
This did not falter the excited whispers, as the students moved from outside the usual classroom, to the Great Hall. And even though they waited fifteen minutes before the Great Hall doors opened, none of the students had been willing to leave.
Fleur let out a sweet-like laugh, 'Well no one understands it better than I, you are most welcome though.'
There was a soft knock. Aria was puzzled, no one had knocked on this door before. Wand in hand in case she had to disarm the person at the door, Aria opened it slowly. To find an awkward-looking Draco Malfoy.
Draco's eyes snapped open, Aria was looking at him, completely terrified, a wall of white feathers surrounding her, 'I'm OK.'
I managed to get all the Muggle documentation you required. I have sent them along with our
It took Aria a long moment to realise why Mrs Weasley who was looking at her in such a concerned manner and had asked her that particular question, Aria had barely eaten anything. Aria looked away, she was unsure what to say - for where did she start, she should have said certain things months ago, but she had not wanted to upset the Weasleys any further. As far as she was concerned she had caused them enough pain.
It took him a few moments to figure out - from his memory - which house it was that he needed. Because it was just odd the Muggles liked having houses that looked alike, and Draco still couldn't understand it. He took a deep breath as he stood on the doorstep of number four, he raised his hand and knocked before he had the chance to change his mind. This was so foolish, completely foolish, he should leave while he still had the chance to.
'I was about to ask our guest if he'd like a drink. I was about to make some tea,' Aria said looking in Draco's direction she added, 'or there is coffee if you prefer.' Draco nodded gratefully.
'So does that mean you forgive me?'
'Isn't that Potters cat?'
'Yes well-' Mrs Weasley muttered into the silence. Mrs Weasley had taken the attitude she had about not saying bad things about the Dursleys in front of Aria and applied it to the Malfoy's. 'that hardly matters now. It's happened everyone will just have to get used to it.'
"What about destroying him?" Daphne Greengrass asked.
"Come." Voldemort gestured her forward. Aria took tentative steps forward until she was gestured to stop. This would be her last test in front of Voldemort before returning come the Christmas holidays.
'That's different,' Draco muttered focusing upon her hand as he began to clean the bite.
Aria hugged her, 'I'll be sure to remember that.'
Aria shook her head, being back here, as much as she had wanted to return, it was going to take some getting used to. 'Not really.'
'Problem?' Draco smirked.
'I am,' Aria said softly. 'But I could say the same thing about you.'
'No, I'm better.' Aria retorted. 'I'm Aria Potter, it would be wise for you to not forget that. I'm not wasting my time with this or on you - it is beneath me. You want to harm me go ahead and try. You want the Malfoys to see me as someone who does not belong, go right ahead. The thing you do not understand is that they already know. And yet here I am, still standing, a half-blood in one of the purest blood houses there is, and about to marry into it. So good luck Celena, you're going to need it.'
'It's OK, I just don't think that people understand and are after a reason as to why, my not wanting to do it doesn't seem to be a good enough of one.'
There was another pause. 'I believed we were right, that all Muggles were filthy, I had no reason to disbelieve it. Until the moment I checked your pulse.'
Though Draco did not receive points as Aria had ... he found he could care less. He felt proud, just like this morning when he had found evidence of his inheritance ... seeing the feathers upon his bed had given him an ego boost, though he still hadn't been able to transform.
Aria's magic was always on the brink of being summoned like she could cause harm to anyone at a moment's notice. Hexes and jinxes always at the tip of her tongue and oh how Aria wanted to - and she really wanted to- rip the Carrows apart limb from limb.
But why? They had never got along - and now, now - it was just odd. Draco had changed, or was it simply due to his oath - and when the hell did he become Draco? Even in her own personal thoughts, she was thinking of him as Draco, sure she had been calling him by his first name, but thinking his name as well an entirely different matter, he was Malfoy dammit not Draco! And when did she start to feel suddenly safe in Draco Malfoy's presence? What the hell was that about? Safe and Draco Malfoy did just not go together. Was her brain trying to play tricks on her? She must have imagined it all - but even her imagination wouldn't be that far-fetched.
'The sprouting blossom represents growth -' Aria felt her cheeks heat up a little under Draco's intense gaze, which had been the first one Aria figured out and without any help from a book. She cleared her throat, feeling a little awkward, and pointed at another. 'This one means sanctuary.'
Aria stopped herself before she made a fool out of herself. She knew that Draco's parents had been invited to see the last stage of the competition, for Hogwarts had all the families for the last contestants to watch the tournament.
'Have you felt like this before?'
Aria flushed so deeply Draco had no idea what brought it on, and why she was suddenly talking about the boys locking the dorm doors - guys only did that that if - OH!
Draco eyed the bulky male, Potter had said nothing about her cousin's muscular build. As for the brown-haired girl - she looked friendly enough.
'Aria.'
'Wands,' Aria answered hesitantly.
'Yes, yes,' Aria said offhandedly. 'I'll behave.' And if Marge did act up, Aria could always think back upon her face as Marge blew up the last time she had come to visit to cheer herself up.
'So how were your summers?' Aria said.
He blinked a few times, taking in the slight frame, the short brown hair in tight coils that were hardly an inch long, accentuating feminine features, the large brown eyes—
“You seemed like you maybe enjoyed yourself at a few points?” Potter asked in a hesitant tone.
Draco smirked. “You brought it on yourself, don’t forget.”
“That’s right,” he replied, frowning at her attitude.
“I don’t deserve it.” There was a moment of shocked silence, then his eyes widened in horror at what he’d admitted. He saw the pained look spread across Potter’s face and he couldn’t handle it anymore—as Draco saw his mouth open to say something he Apparated back to his cabin and stumbled backward until he was leaning against the wall, adrenaline causing his heart to hammer against his throat, his breaths coming in short gasps.
“I was thinking,” Potter began, “if you and Hermione will be meeting to test stuff on Sunday, did you want me to come along too? I know that I’m not really involved in your spellwork, so if you’d rather I didn’t go then I can always hand over a few brooms to her for safekeeping.”
“How many more island stops do you think we’ll have before we head back?” he heard a few minutes later.
“Yeah,” he barely heard as the boat thumped gently against the dock.
“Well maybe you do!” he exclaimed, then immediately looked chagrined. “Sorry. I just worry.”
“I don’t suppose you could bring me some clothing? I’d like to have a shower and I didn’t bring my things with me. If you’re able to go there, my home is in the woods next to the grounds of the former Malfoy Manor. Otherwise, I’ll just take that towel if you don’t mind.”
Saturday, he awoke far too early, and after a few hours of trying to talk himself out of it he grabbed the last bottle of birch sap beer and Apparated to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
Hermione was nodding. “That is certainly worth testing. I can put together some resources on solutions that might work, unless you had something in mind?”
suggested one of these places,” he said, gesturing around them. And sure enough they were surrounded by partitioned-off sections of tables, most empty at this late hour but the lights that were strung up on the overhangs were still lit up, and he could smell the aromas of grilling seafood coming from somewhere nearby.
There was no response, so Draco rolled his eyes to himself, tossed teabags into two mugs, and then sat down in his chair, shutting his eyes. Because damn the man, he was going to sit in his own chair in his own home.
They sat quietly for several minutes, only the odd sipping sound interrupting the silence, until Potter said, “You knew.”
He swallowed. “You invited me.”
Swing.
Potter stepped into view then, finally, aiming a concerned look up the stairs toward Draco. “It’s not a big deal, Ron. I can even quote you as saying, ‘The Slytherins are an all right bunch.’”
“Did you have a good lunch?” he asked, when it was clear that Potter wasn’t going to speak first.
“And don’t think I didn’t notice that you did something to scare him off,” he added, glaring at the damn bird, who just stared impassively back at him.
His chest was tight, and he felt a prickling sort of heat behind his eyes, overwhelmed by everything that he could hear in the man’s tone, and everything that he himself felt. He wished that he could return to wallowing in the bath.
Maybe he could try to live, and not just work at picking up the pieces back home, always putting in three times the effort for half the respect.
“I swear it was just up here—we passed by it earlier on the way up. Remember? Those teens were out front practicing keepy-ups?”
Then he was gone.
He was searching for the right words to say when the man cleared his throat, an uncertain expression on his face. “Look, I know you said that you couldn’t but I want to put it out there again. I’d like for you to come by for lunch on Saturday. It’s not as many people as pub night, and it’s just here. And if you don’t want to, I understand that. But I want you to know that you’re welcome and—and I want to see you,” he finished, stumbling over his last words.
“They had no idea what was wrong with you. And even though you had a pulse, you weren’t breathing, and then your skin started to go all patchy, and they had even
There was a pause for several long seconds. “You don’t sound too thrilled about that.”
“Draco! I didn’t know you were joining us!” Hermione exclaimed, jumping to her feet and ambushing him with a hug. Draco froze, startled out of his mind, and thankfully the moment only lasted two seconds before she was stepping back. “I think you know everyone, but maybe some introductions just in case?”
Potter seemed to mull that over, then he said, “So you knew, you just forgot.”
“Sure.”
“Well, yeah. I’m assuming you probably won’t want to stay with Hermione.”
Eventually Potter rose and set his empty mug in the sink. With his back still turned he said, “I’m just so tired of people dying.”
And Potter was, for once, quite amenable to his suggestion.
Potter’s smile was a pleased one. “She’s a terror in the kitchen, but she does know how to cook,” he said fondly.
“I really don’t care how much you argue about this, Malfoy, you’re living with me for the next month. I was pretty sure that Hermione was going to kill me, and if you don’t have someone watching you she said she’s going to take action. I don’t think that either of us want to know what that means.”
Potter finally looked up at him, his expression still shuttered. “Why?
“Thank you, Draco.” There was silence for several long minutes, and neither of them moved.
“I’m not telling you anything, actually,” Draco said evenly, that old spot of irritation inside him bristling.
Draco’s gaze skittered over to the broom and he stepped away, focusing on making his movements casual. “No, I haven’t figured that one out yet. More than anything I need a safe area to test ridiculously high heat. Not to mention access to a heat source.”
“Yeah. You’d almost think that,” Potter agreed, though his tone lacked the levity Draco had been aiming for, and instead made him feel more anxious.
He looked around, the motions exaggerated. They were in a dark, gloomy alley, hardly wide enough for the single lane of cars that were trundling up a very steep hill. Along one side of the already-narrow road there was some sort of excavation taking place, the asphalt torn apart and a smattering of striped orange pillars strewn about.
Within the following week Fry had talked about spaceflight three more times, during lectures about the Tube, David Bowie, and the EFTA, as though any of those things were remotely related. But it was fascinating to hear of the moon landing. And then, to learn that there were people living in the ISS every day, orbiting the planet?
“I’ll think about it,” he heard himself reply, then he pursed his lips. “Thanks, Potter, for saving my life again. And for not being too much of a git this past month.”
“I told you so.” Ah, there it was.
“No, Potter,” Draco interrupted with a sigh. “She’ll get bored sooner or later and fly off. I can put an Imperturbable Charm on the door if her screeching bothers you.”
“Hermione swooped in and saved the day, thank god. It still took her a long time, though. And once she confirmed that you were under stasis and wouldn’t be going anywhere, she tore me a new one. I still don’t really understand why, to be honest, but once she heard what had happened she said that if you ever woke up you’d better be prepared for her wrath. Because apparently you should have known better.”
Draco furrowed his brow, then took away from Potter and lowered himself onto the sofa, wincing as his hips throbbed. “You mentioned you’d be getting in touch with Hermione?”
So he turned on his heel and Apparated back to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“Hmm. Well, he may have blocked the Floo but he’s not going to get out of things that easily. I’ll be right back.” And with that she was racing back up the stairs.
Still, Draco knew Potter remained close to Hermoine and Ron. Having access to Hermione’s schedule permitted him that much knowledge. There were lunches and dinners, all mysteriously blacked out on her calendar. Hermoine didn’t keep secrets from Draco. Hadn’t for years. He even knew about the time Ron abandoned the Golden Trio during their search for Horcruxes.
Should Draco stop drinking the whiskey?
“Silly little badger-faced simpleton.”
“Obviously not,” Draco said. “But sometimes context matters. Knowing that other people have been hurt worse than you could help you manage your own pain.”
Ten years ago, maybe even five, Draco might have been able to keep the righteous anger flowing. But he’d been up all night. And there was a pot of coffee on…
“So, how long do you need to prepare to see me again?” Potter asked, his eyes glinting with mischief.
“Don’t coaches get paid?”
Then, before Hermione could give him her sage but unwanted and likely to be unheeded advice, the evening took a turn for the strange when a crack of Apparition brought Harry Potter into the living room.
Draco made pinching motions with his right hand until Lavender gave him his flat white. With a sigh, he took a deep inhale followed by a deeper sip, not even registering the tongue burn he received for drinking it without first removing Lavender’s industrial strength warming charm. He nudged Lavender toward the lift until she complied.
It was only inside the lift that Draco seemed to grasp the enormity of what they were doing.
Draco thought.
Draco gulped. “Is it?”
“Well, yeah, Draco,” Harry said, as if this was an obvious conclusion to draw: Hermione Granger-Weasley and Ronald Weasley talking about Draco Malfoy, often enough that Harry Potter, current and forever Wizarding World Saviour, called him
“And being an orphan,” Draco added, hoping for some more of the sympathy she was dishing out.
At 9:58, he could no longer stand it. With a dramatic flourish, he dropped a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and called out her address.
Surprise! Early chapter. Surprise! Epilogue on its way. Ended up with more content than I expected, so yay? I mean, did you think I was going to finish this story without forcing Harry to attend his own Coming Out Ball?
“It sounds like you were perfect together,” Draco said, taking a sip of wine, the jealousy winning out in his heart though luckily not in his tone. “What happened?”
Draco glared at her, but her pleading gaze revealed no harm intended. He nodded, and said, “15 minutes.”
Since they visited on a school day, the trio had their run of the small village. Harry had forgone his invisibility cloak, which he’d admitted to Draco he normally wore on outings. He seemed twitchy out in the open, but the locals kept their distance.
FYI: I started this back in December, so it's actually my first Harry Potter fanfic, even though I finished A Crack In The Wall before I posted this one.
“What about him?” Draco spat, then winced.
“When I realized my sexuality isn’t as important as when I decided to come forward. It’s important to me that anyone who looks up to me understands their sexuality doesn’t define them, nor does it make them less than anyone else.”
Draco blinked. “You… died?”
“Yeah, well.” He takes another large sip. “Old habits and all.” Sighing, “I am sorry, by the way. That I implied you liked being the Chosen One. I knew better. I
Sighing, Draco decided to reconstitute himself and try again. “Sorry, Potter. But I’m having a bad day, and I wasn’t prepared to see you again.”
Draco twirls the ends around his fingers, cheeks pinkening. “Do you?”
. What, you spend a few hours with me after a decade or so of only hearing about me through the rumor mill and suddenly you
Harry’s face flushed. “I mean, you uh. Well. Yeah. You’ve uh. Aged. Well.”
Draco stopped his mind from going down a track that involved teeth and Harry’s ear. “Yes, well. I don’t know if I’m ready to go into all that right now. The reason I needed to get out of the office today is… well.” It dawned on Draco that discussing Hermione with Harry might be too strange. “It’s about Hermione. Is that ok?”
Draco smirked. “I spelled cushioning charms onto his pants, transfigured a parachute into his jacket, and made him wear an invisible but well-protected helmet on his head.”
“For?”
Walking into the office, Draco tried and failed to ignore the growing dread of what Astoria might want to discuss with him later this evening.
“Promise?” Scorpius’s voice trembled, and
“That’s what I was finishing up this morning. Anyways, I took it to Kingsley and he loved it. Actually, he loved it so much he’s thinking about enacting the same thing. He asked us to put together a list of legislation you would work on, and then he’ll approve my hiring a new assistant, for both of us.”
Baz smiles. “He followed me around our whole fifth year. Convinced I was plotting and up to no good.” Shaking his head, “Instead, I was trying to wank away my gay feelings for him.”
Harry turned to Draco, and the devil said, “Not even a small chance?”
The two of them brainstormed for an hour or so, sitting on the sidelines of the pitch where there was ample shade from the evening sun; even in the shade, the summer heat was overwhelming for Draco given he spent most of his time in magically controlled environments. They stopped briefly to have dinner with the boys; Teddy had morphed his hair into a perfect replica of Scorpius’s, which Draco could tell flattered his son. They were fast friends, and the flush in Scorpius’s face indicated that Draco might now be expected to purchase a few tickets for upcoming Quidditch matches.
He couldn’t run from it any longer: the truth that his feelings had grown beyond a simple attraction. These pieces of Harry kept building and had been building for weeks. Any hope Draco could resist the gravity of Harry Potter’s star died the day Harry bent on his knees to address Draco’s son as his equal.
“Out?” Harry asked.
“They’re trying to make a baby, Harry. We’re not allowed to judge,” Draco said, quoting Astoria, weakly, because it’s all he could say, really.
Draco gulped. “I didn’t think anyone noticed.”
A memory gripped Draco and he gasped, “I
“Sounds perfect,” Lavender said. “Oh, and, Draco? Don’t think we aren’t discussing why you were so freaked out I might set you up.”
“Wouldn’t you have to appeal to the editor to shut down a story?” Harry asked. “And how can you leverage scandals against him, considering he chooses what to print?”
“You don’t have to do that,” Draco called out half-heartedly as Harry cleaned the pans and dishes by hand. He’d never admit it, but Draco didn’t actually want Harry to stop cleaning, even if he played muggle better than Draco ever could.
Wincing, “Sorry. Uh. She’s… passed on. But she came to my room while Baz was--”
who inspired me to write just a little bit more in this world!
“You already have some of my hair saved, don’t you?” Draco accused.
He nods. It’s only when I’m convinced of my boyfriend’s health that I realize my mistake.
“Mmhmm,” She replied. “Well,” Shuffling papers on her desk, “If that’s your story, I won’t push. Besides, I have a proposal to complete before meeting with Shacklebolt. Would you mind keeping my door shut and turning away any visitors until after lunch?”
“Huh,” Harry said, scooping a chunk of icing off Draco’s plate with a finger, then shoving said finger into his mouth. Draco avoided watching the show.
Harry smirked, pushing more confidence into the act than he felt. “It’s Harry, remember?” He corrected. Then, when the lift doors opened to the top floor, “Besides, I’ve never minded what they print about me, when it’s been the truth.”
Three, two…
Harry led. “I’m planning to come out, Draco helped me write a press release, and we’d like to do a press conference.”
“Yes,” The Headmistress sits up in her chair. “You are welcome to stay at Hogwarts, of course. I have promised the Saviour of the Wizarding World that I would keep you under my protection.” She chuckles at this, but the joke is lost on Simon and me; a fact we acknowledge in a shared look. “Unfortunately, due to recent damage to the castle, I cannot spare a private bedroom. You may stay with Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy until we find a way to send you home. I assume the four of you are mature enough to come to a reasonable solution?”
Draco huffed. “Don’t get a big head about it or anything.”
Sure, their Glamours and Transfigurations accomplish the same tasks as our spells, but they feel kilometers apart. In our world, magic is modern art: flashy, but with nuance and layers and context that changes person to person. Their magic is elemental. The body bind washed over me like a wave, the ropes grew like roots, Harry’s Glamour settled over my wings like a ray of sunshine, and Draco’s robe transfiguration felt like a soft breeze.
Groaning, Draco woke with a mouth full of cotton and a splitting headache.
Draco scoffed. “I never wanted to be
She smiled and wrapped her arms around him. He didn’t break down. Honest. But if there was a bit of a wet spot on Hermione’s left shoulder that wasn’t there before the hug, neither of them mentioned it.
“Hermione,” Draco scolded, waving the cup Marge had already dropped off.
,” The Headmistress repeats. “Mr Snow, while you are with us, I would like to investigate your transformation a bit more.” She clears her throat. “I may be in administration now but, as I said earlier, there is no age limit to education.” Her resulting smile warms my heart. It reminds me of Ms Possibelf, now that I think about it. I believe that she really cares.
Harry, more oblivious than Simon, skips over the unintended confession. “I rather like your mustache.”
“Sorry, Draco.” Hermoine looked pained. “It was last minute, and I didn’t have time to ask. You don’t mind?”
“Sixth year. And, to be fair, he was actually plotting.”
Like the little Slytherin she was starting to resemble, Hermione actually looked pleased, though she didn’t say a word. On the carpet in front of them, Hugo played on, completely oblivious to his mother’s transformation into an evil, evil woman.
“Anyway, I couldn’t be happier for her. Although, I do think it’s funny that we broke up because I wanted a family, but now she’s married and here I am. Still single.” He shook his head, as if not actually finding the thought all that funny. “But, what about you? What skeletons are in Draco Malfoy’s closet?”
Harry stood, and held out a hand to Draco, who accepted, and followed Harry to the balcony.
“Potter, stay,” Pansy said.
“You or me?” Simon asks Baz.
“I suppose there are some good things about me walking away from you.”
“You loooooved me,” Simon teases.
Sometimes, the chapters are way longer than normal. This will become more common as the story goes on.
Draco looked up and saw his mother and his son’s mother staring back with pride in their eyes. With a deep sigh, Draco released the part of himself he’d been holding at arm’s length, and relaxed into the embrace of his son.
Draco lifted his nose in the air, slightly mollified by the compliment. Slightly.
, he shook his head, narrowing his eyes at Harry.“Oh no you don’t. You had your chance to leave.” He extended his hand and pointed downward, the command clear.
Draco nodded, then paused. “On one condition.”
This answer both pleased and displeased Draco. So, he did what he always did: he focused on the bad part. “How come you didn’t want to hang out with me?” Draco was convinced he didn’t sound petulant at all in asking the question.
Harry couldn’t help himself; he laughed. “Since you fought me on the Honeymoon Suite. And won.”
Draco’s heart thumped. He examined Harry’s face, distracted by the way he bit his lip while gathering the courage to ask whatever it was he intended to ask. Salazar, since when did Draco find blumbling Gryffindors this endearing?
