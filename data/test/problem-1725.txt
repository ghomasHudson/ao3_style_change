: he’s my fiancé :)
: damn I forgot about that
“Thanks to Severus we know Voldemort thinks that Harry escaped. We need to believe the same and hope that we will find him as soon as possible. In the meantime, it is absolutely essential that nobody knows about Harry’s disappearance. Severus will tell Voldemort that Harry returned to us safely and that he is currently recovering at a safe house. Alastor –“, he looked at the former Auror, “I ask you and Kingsley to form a small group which observes and if possible prevents the Death Eater activity in the Ministry. Work silently as we can’t afford a direct confrontation right now.”

: pleAse no
So the last few weeks I basically rotated between working, writing my last assignment for the semester and preparing for my internship abroad. By now I arrived at where I will live and work for the next two months and I am familiar with my flat and I met most of my colleagues and started working here, but it’s still A LOT and I haven’t really been on AO3 in like a month and I haven’t opened Word outside of work and I WAS BUSY YOU GUYS.
: on second thought
: ADBNFAFV WHAT
: u both suck
: it's Saturday
: So, Harry. Before we get to today’s topic, I would like to actually talk quickly about you, since your childhood is one of the reasons you are so interested in  the topic of the integration of muggleborns, am I correct?
: wsit no

Good Morning Mr. Weasley,

: theo im proud of u my beautiful son
: we were on fourth floor
: i…. that’s fucking precious
Username Guide:
fuck I fucked up right
: man that kind of anger sucks
The potion master took a sharp breath. He could hear the hidden fear behind Dumbledore’s words. He silently considered the meaning of this while they continued to search for any trace of the source of the magic. If another powerful Dark wizard or witch arose, the chances of the Light side winning the on-going war was becoming even smaller.

HELLO my beautiful readers and memers!!
: oh yeah?
Padma believes her chatname proves that she’s indeed the smarter one because she capitalized the first letter of each word.
: YES
Snape frowned and shook his head. “My lab is heavily warded so that nothing can influence the brewing process of the more delicate potions. I didn’t feel anything. What happened?”
: gross heterosexual relationships aside what did Snape say
anyway?
Take your damn vacation, kids.
goodnight, harry
: brutal

Professor Pomona Sprout
: I think it’s a cool name???
: is that a question

: that's not my name and that doesn’t mean we need that many children
: Draco
: Cissy expects you and you know better than to disappoint her.
: sure, batdad
and im babysitting :D
, he asked. Now that he was thinking more clearly, the idea of being dead was terrifying. He didn’t want to be the only one able to safe the world from Voldemort, but nevertheless, it was his duty to do so. How would he fight Voldemort when he was already dead? He had never seen the Hogwarts ghosts fight, although he had to admit that Peeves could be quite destructive.
: true. I mean. Quirrel? I learned nothing.
: ….. yes
Neville – Knockyourwood
: yea well, u made me this way
: GOTTA GO
: it breaks every year
: yes?
: but I think sev would understand you best
: and Stupid and Reasonable deserve to have to work for winning severus over
: congrats!! :)
: maybe
Alarmed, Draco reached for his wand. “What did he write, mother?” the young man asked, forcing his voice to be steady.
: Remus Lupin. He’s great. Best DADA teacher we ever had. Well, to be honest, Moody was also great, but then there’s the fact that he was actually a Death Eater pretending to be Moody, so …
: is that…. blood…. on the certificate??
Dumbledore chuckled quietly at the obvious displeasure in the other man’s voice. At least some things would always be predictable for him.
: that was the whole point of messaging you about that
: true tbh
: except this time they signed up for it
: and he’ll be rewarded for that
: I had to read that
: I don’t like this. I don’t want to know what that means
: I got rid of the glasses bc fighting is kinda difficult with them???
: I love you and the way you make absolutely certain that all our expenses are covered by 50% of my and 50% of your vault
MOTHER ???????
“I don’t want to wake up.”, Harry whispered. The thought of returning to reality, of facing all the problems and duties waiting for him, was scaring him. For the first time in many years he was completely calm. Giving up his rest seemed to be an impossible sacrifice.
EDIT: none of u little shits told me about that random kyle meme thrown in between the lines where it def didn't belong i trusted u i trusted all of you how DARE YOU
: ofc I would listen to
: no I do
: srsly why is Neville so much more.... confident here than irl?
… so…?
: Flitwick, Filius
: maybe showing u the link was a bad idea

: I was asleep just now so prob no
: for real where is harry??? Or draco, they would know what happened
: I’m bored
: there’s the fact that he’s eating
: ok I get the message, u all suck, let it go already
: now that nev can finally relieve his sexual frustration of two years :) :)
: bye bye dursleys

I am afraid the esteemed members of the Wizengamot love nothing more than the sound of their own voice. I have adapted and am now using two quick-notes quills.

no mum
: I MEANT YET
: I don’t even know what to say to that
: u think people are sending harry sexual fantasies about him?????
: I’M SORRY
: you getting adopted by Severus makes perfect sense and we are happy with it. He’s proven to be able to protect you even in times when doing so openly would have gotten him killed instantly. And he has worked so hard on getting you away from the dursleys.
: he just walked out of the dorm without one, im gonna kill him
: it’s a very interesting and highly relevant topic
: bless you, devination girl
: he sucks at potions
Lavender – Stardust

: WE ARE SO HAPPY FOR YOU
: I bitch-slapped Smith into greenhouse four
Your son is great and he has never done anything wrong in his life ever.
: wow

I already received a call from Lord Malfoy, he was
: why would u do this to me

u’ve been hot since year 3 smh
: fuck I can’t just leave what if smth happens?? I need to show that I’m here right? Fuck what was I thinking I’m not prepared to be a father figure
: !!!
Draco crossed his arms over his chest. It made him look like a small child, but Narcissa allowed it because she understood his need to express his defiance in some way. “But I left him because I wanted to. You didn’t… force me to leave him or something ridiculous like that.”
TheStars - siri
: you are perfect
Snape: TheNight
: I mean right, obviously
: 3. Do not make any promises. Any at all. You can’t save the slowly diminishing population of Northern Pixies, nor do you want to become the youngest headmaster of Hogwarts ever
: oh, so it is A Day, huh?
: dragon dung
: THAT’S NOT THE WORST THING THOUGH
: that’s very kind of you to say, but we both know that the potion is way too complicated

The man took a deep breath and let the wolf in him take over. It rumbled happily at being allowed to run during the day. Remus let the wolf run through the forest, faster than any human would be able to. It had taken him a long time, but he had finally accepted the wolf as part of himself instead of thinking of it as a disease he wished to burn out of his body. Not many people understood the relationship between a man and his wolf. They thought he was a completely ‘normal’ person who was simply overcome by violence once a month. But instead he could always feel the beast at the back of his mind. During the day and with the full moon still two weeks away, Remus had complete control over the wolf. He could use its instincts and and its strength, but he stayed human. It was a small compensation for loosing all of his humanity every single month.
: he acts as if he hates it
: dad
: nothing can shook us at this point
, he whispered. The thought of returning to reality, of facing all the problems and duties waiting for him, was scaring him. For the first time in many years he was completely calm. Giving up his rest seemed to be an impossible sacrifice.
: can you believe draco’s mom killed pansy’s mom
: just shows that you are still you and your username is still true ;)
: highty-mighty Remus Lupin

as a dog, though.
: That’s not so bad???
: sorry best person speech
: I SAID I LOVE YOU AND I TREASURE EVERY MINUTE I SPEND TOGETHER WITH YOU
: do we need to have The Talk, Harry?
Remus kept silent, still focusing on Bellatrix. He had known about the wards around Malfoy Manor, thank you very much, and he had also known that he would trigger them. But he had been forced to get as close to the mansion as possible to search for any sign of Harry or at least the boy’s magical signature.
: Hey. Hey. Stop it. Get some help. Drink more water or something. Think about your choices.
: I mean… I g u e s s  it’s bc this ‘chosen one’ thing??
: ….. with puppy piles?
Ginny nodded. “And what happened to him anyway? Why and how was he wounded?”
Pansy – GossipQueen
: I know he has been writing  s o m e t h i n g  for the last few years
: thanks! Obviously he loves books but when we met him and Harry it seemed as if he also likes music a lot?? Do you think he would like one of these music boxes which can play both wizarding and muggle music for christmas??

: Oh my.
::…::…::
Harry took a deep breath and started the search for his magic. The forest around him whispered, and the sun started to die at the end of another day. Animals and magical creatures alike started to join the whispers as they watched the young wizard who was neither really there amongst them, nor was he lost to the world behind the shadows just yet.
: that’s the objective here, yes
: Lucius
Charms Master

Thank you for your very accurate evaluation. I knew that already, but it’s nice to hear.
“And what, precisely, are we supposed to
It was interesting, diving into the waters with the bubble of charms around him. He could see that his head was contained within a sphere of air, and the warmth circulating through the larger space around the entire broom remained constant. Manoeuvring the broom, on the other hand, was a different matter entirely; it was slow to accelerate, slow to turn, slow to respond in general.
“Don’t be melodramatic.”
“A few.”
Once the toast was golden he slathered on some butter and marmalade and nibbled at it, his appetite beginning to take form. Once he’d finished his second slice the kettle was whistling and he prepared himself a cup of tea. The muffled sound of raised voices made its way down from the ground floor so he poured a second cup, and a third in case Hermione wanted one.
Draco’s gaze settled on the tree once more, taking in the decorations, a mix of some that were obviously child-made, and others that were so delicate and fine that he was surprised to see them in Potter’s home.
He nodded.
Maybe Potter would.
Potter, and he knew that the man was on the edge of doing something immensely stupid because that’s what he did when he panicked.
Without opening his eyes he murmured, “You
Potter smiled fondly. “I’m his godfather, I get to be the fun one. Then again, he didn’t hear any of those stories from me.” His smile turned sad and Draco looked away, feeling a bit of relief that they’d arrived at the clearing.
Something turned unpleasantly in his stomach and he swallowed. “Good morning, Mother.”
“The nearest hollow is about two miles away. And you’ve complained about it being too small.”
A few hours later, after he’d eaten, stared vacantly at the ceiling for a bit, packed away the leftover stew, then trimmed some of Vince’s shed feathers into quills for the hell of it, he grabbed the blanket that hung by the door and traipsed outside, navigating the dark woods with ease until he reached a wide clearing.
“Plantain crisp?” Potter offered, holding the bag out while he pulled out his mobile and began tapping at the buttons.
He shook his head. “Doesn’t matter. I’ll do my own research, then.”
His beard wasn’t as wild, though it was certainly longer than he’d realised, with it bunching up into a dense thickness in the spots where he habitually scratched at it, and hanging more scraggly and wispy in the areas where he didn’t. It was thick enough that his thin mouth was completely hidden when closed, and even his long, pointed nose appeared small.
The mulish expression was back. “We’re not just going to hand over the company’s intellectual property to anyone. But I’m part of the design team, so I can answer your questions.”
“Don’t bother coming any earlier than four o’clock on weekdays,” he finally said, after they’d remained silent but for the occasional sips of tea for some twenty minutes. “The classes end at three but the instructor tends to go over. Today, I’d like to look at one of the brooms and test it a bit. Depending on what I find, I might want to do some more checks, or get started on some adjustments next time you’re here. How often are you planning on coming by?”
with the man, knowing that it would
Swing.
Draco could feel a sneer pulling at his lip but fought it down, then led Potter out of the warehouse. He only realised once they’d met the late morning sunlight once more that he was still holding onto his arm and released it, shoving his hands in his pockets since they clearly couldn't be trusted.
here?”
“No one ever said you weren’t tenacious,” Draco replied evenly.
Draco still didn’t have any new ideas on heat protection nor had he received the additional muggle books to learn more about ultraviolet radiation, so he considered his list, then said, “Atmospheric Charms next, I should think. And depending on how smoothly those work together, I’ll follow them with Sticking Charms.”
“Well, it looks like you do remember those discussions after all. Draco, I want to talk to you alone. Harry?” The man’s expression was shuttered, of what was visible while he continued to look down toward the table. He made no move to get up so Hermione made a sound in the back of her throat and strode toward the stairs. Draco rose to his feet and followed her to the front hall.
He bit the inside of his cheek, feeling as his breathing started to grow unsteady. “I’m. . . .” The words died in his throat.
Draco looked away and stared hard at the hearth. “I didn’t understand half of what he was saying. More than half.”
Potter huffed, raking a hand through his hair. “Well, we knew that, didn’t we? Look—I’ll explain something. You’ll want to heal that, though,” he said, waving toward Draco’s face.
In direct counterpoint to the literal meaning of his words the man then left the kitchen, leaving Draco to the spinning of his thoughts and the hammering of his heart.
“Probably.”
The hand was back up in the hair. Draco pursed his lips, trying to figure out what had thrown the man into such inner turmoil.
Vince had had enough of the loud noises at that point and let out a piercing shriek, taking off and cuffing Potter over the head with a wing as he flapped out of the cabin.
“Malfoy, are you all right?”
He felt the sharp inhale, the air rushing past him and through Potter’s parted lips. And then their lips met, both slightly chapped from the alcohol and the weeks spent under the Mediterranean sun. Potter’s were warm, and soft, not tentative but at the same time unhurried, brushing gently across his, each touch coaxing his hammering heart higher and higher in his ribcage.
Draco was still on his hands and knees, realizing with a slight struggle that he had been secured by magic when he appeared. Something in his expression must have given him away, because the mystery man merely laughed at his vain attempts.
"Were you away all the time, then?" Draco asked. It was the only viable reason he could think of that would push Ron away.
"I'm certain, because it's simply not possible."
"Well, we do," Harry replied with a chuckle, nursing his own mug in his hands. "At one point in a married man's life, the call becomes too much, and he must henceforth go into the nearest pub and receive its blessing."
Potter merely shook his head. "James' delivery was so easy, there was barely anything to worry about. Complete opposite of this. Ginny didn't even have much trouble, she told me. But this... it's not what...I'm pretty fucking terrified."
"How can you be so blasé about this!" Draco demanded indignantly. "We are talking about a child. An actual person. He's yours, isn't he?" He turned to his wife. "You're his bloody mother, for Merlin's sake!"
Ron laughed. "Come out with us more often," he suggested. "Wouldn't want to ignore the Call of the Pint now, would we?"
"Because he passed away two years ago."
For several minutes, not another word was exchanged
"Can I play with James tomorrow?" the boy suddenly asked. Harry thought about it, frowning because his own son was barely a year old.
"Why do you think she won't marry me?"
"As if that's a bad thing," Ron harrumphed. Hermione sighed.
The Chief Warlock spoke in a grave voice, "Let the final witness take the stand."
"Well, now that's over and done with...I'll see you day after tomorrow?"
"Listen to yourself, will you?" Harry cut in loudly. "Where the fuck is all of that even coming from? I didn't even say anything remotely in the same sense as everything you just spouted at me. Why the hell are you so defensive about your career?!"
"RON! Just spit it out!"
Narcissa looked sideways at her son, concern painted on her delicate face. "Is something the matter, dear?" she asked. Draco caught her glancing at Astoria.
Teddy, now fully awake and doubly excited, moved higher to hug Draco. "Draco, you're still here! You can celebrate with us! Hooray!" And with that he jumped off and ran back upstairs. Draco hoped to Merlin he didn't wake the babies just yet.
Dinner had ended just fine after all, with no additional drama. Ron had Apparated Hermione to a flat she was renting, while Harry escorted Ginny to the Leaky Caulron's fireplace, where she promptly Flooed back to her training camp. He then went straight home and began on his study session. That was about four hours ago, and it was getting pretty late, but he insisted on being the best Auror he could be. He had to remind himself repeatedly in the last few months that these weren't just schoolwork, they meant the difference between being an Auror and actually being a good one.
Ron's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Malfoy was in the right direction from the start, mate! This reinforces the fact that all of this has some sort of root in old Scandinavia."
They were quiet for a while, Draco understanding Hermione's need to internally file all the fresh information she had just learned. He went back to fawning over little Rosie, smiling in spite of himself as she fidgeted in her sleep.
"When he heard about your trial, and the likely outcome, Harry came directly to me for an audience with the Minister for Magic. He was.. well, he was aggravated, and he tends to forget that he consciously needs to suppress his core, given that he has more magical power than... well, just take my word for it, an angry Harry is quite intimidating." Kingsley shivered, and Draco wondered if there was more to Potter than he knew after all.
That night, Harry stayed in his study to wait for Ginny. In a bassinet by the corner, James was fast asleep. It was during these quiet hours when his mind usually began to work.
No, they just both preferred to keep this personal stuff between the two of them.
In any case, spending the weekend with Draco was enough of a booster to his mood. Perhaps he just needed that jolt in his life, to spend a few days not with his mates or his ex-fiancée or other Aurors. Perhaps he just needed someone detached from his daily life, who was sincere and forward and understanding and just as broken and sympathetic and blunt…
"I've invited Potter and Weasley for a few drinks at the Viridian," he said. "It will only be the third time we've been out in public so it won't be suspicious, and all of it under the protection of Potter's wards."
Harry groaned. "As if my life hasn't been one huge cauldron of angst. I need the laughs more, I think. I'm sure anything is better to talk about than my life."
"Mama! Mamaaaaaa!" a delicate voice suddenly pierced their bubble of happiness, and Hermione stood up, brushing off crumbs from her lap.
Ron blanched. "But she...she said... well, she said she wasn't ready yet, but you're right, she didn't actually tell me no!"
Ginny apparently didn't.
Draco heard a wail coming from behind Pansy.. "Must you go so soon?" he pouted at her jokingly. She returned his look with a grin.
Draco nodded interestedly. "Is that so? Good, then! At least we know you're not cheating!" he joked.
"Well enough, Mother," he replied,, his voice tinted with the warmth of affection for his son. "It took a bit of persuasion for both nurse elves to give him up to me, but I believe it was worth it."
"Not to mention the Pensieve memories?"
Malfoy had actually admitted to having absolutely no idea about running a home, since his own household was pretty much taken care of by the house elves. For an amateur homemaker though, he did pretty well just following Harry's instructions. They even managed more small talk while Malfoy was making the eggs and Harry was setting the table. The blonde expressed sheer delight at the Muggle toaster, explaining to Harry that it was a difficult Charm for most wizards to perfect, which meant that the typical magical person just learned to live with slightly burnt toast if they didn't have a house elf's magic.
"What? You'd carry my name instead?! You'd do that?! I mean-" Harry was bewildered.
Malfoy nodded, and his weariness and anxiety became even more obvious. "Astoria and I received a threat yesterday."
"But you see, Mr. Malfoy, my impression of you was greatly challenged by Mr. Potter."
Harry nodded but remained silent, so that Ron could push himself to continue.
Harry drew in a breath and held it. And held it. And held it. Maybe if he passed out, he would wake up and learn this had all been a dream.
- occurred."
"So no one else is coming over to celebrate?" Draco ventured to ask.
"You're such an arsehole sometimes."
Harry had been gaping at Malfoy. "But - but your baby! How are you taking care of him?"
"Alright," he heard Auror Stone announce, when they all ran back to him. "to the showers, the lot of you. I'll see you back here tomorrow for your Tactical Spells." With a curt nod, the bulky man retreated from the training field and disappeared from their view. Immediately, there was a collective sigh amongst the trainees.
Harry rolled his eyes. Only with the Weasleys could he joke about his status as Savior and Chosen One without it being uncomfortable.
She gave a smile and went on to try to fix James' hair. "He definitely got this mop from you," she said accusingly at Harry. "I've tried every grooming Charm and it won't stay put!"
"Of course, what?!" Weasley exclaimed, still slightly red. "Just explain it already, you git. Are we missing something?"
"But what about the -"
: (chuckles)
(In case you were wondering about the characters, I am writing them based on book canon, since I am challenging myself to work within the existing universe to create a realistic but different storyline that is Drarry :D Apart from that, I added a few of my own assumptions based on canon, such as Harry's tendency to feel at fault for everything and his need to have a purpose and be 'useful' because of his childhood with the Dursleys. I also imagine that Draco would have such a strong sense of pride instilled that his main motivation will always to undo what his Father did and make a new name for himself. I hope you guys are enjoying it so far, and thank you for taking the time to read my work!)
Harry sighed. "And I want my life with you, Ginny. Not this fucking charade that we've ended up with over the last year. I can't share a life with you if you aren't even here to share it with. And we both know that ripping you away from your dreams, when you're so close to it, isn't exactly something you'd appreciate. But we've got to make a choice here. It's not just for our sakes anymore, Gin. All my decisions so far have been about you. About you and James. I think it's high time that you start thinking beyond yourself, think about what your choices mean for you, for us, for James."
"And?"
"Of course she wouldn't, she hasn't referred to him at all in any way, not since they got separated officially. Mother still acknowledged that he was my father, but nothing more."
"I can understand that sentiment," Hermione said. "Look at me and Ron, when we had Hugo it also changed our dynamic, and we did have to grow up and be more mature about our life together. I guess though, that we were more prepared for the whole family thing that you and Ginny were."
Astoria laughed. "No, silly, you've already gone and done it," she said with an uncharacteristic giggle as if she had a private joke that Draco didn't understand. It unnerved him a bit, if he were being honest.
Malfoy looked at him with a curious expression on his face, then nodded. "You could say that. Also, I actually put in a joke in there, and you seem to have missed it. I never knew Gryffindors were this slow on the uptake in the morning..."
had lasted for a few months, and then he had realized that he really was free.
"See here, Malfoy," the Auror said, indicating old parchment records of previous cases. "There's typically a lull in threatening activity for stalkers especially in cases like yours where we've chosen to act as if it isn't to be taken seriously. They take it as an insult that you don't care, so they bide their time until they can't help it. When they blow off their top, that's usually when they do something careless and lead us right to 'em!"
"This is why he told me expressly that it was a bad idea to tell you of his involvement at all, he said you would react negatively."
Now, however, Draco couldn't help but feel as if he were wrong-footed, as if nothing he did could ever appease his wife. He wasn't sure when the doubts had risen to the surface, but Narcissa was right. Astoria had been acting out of sorts a few weeks after Scorpius' birth, and he felt within himself that it was probably his fault.
Bright light filled the room. With a sharp gasp, the blond on the bed sat bolt upright and glanced around with apprehension. Then he realized that it was still pretty dark, that he was not under attack, and that an errant ray of moonlight had fallen on his face while he was sleeping and woken him up. With a shake of his head, he strode to the en suite bathroom and stared up at his own reflection in the mirror.
She bit her lip. "Well..."
"Auror Potter," Ginny said, as if she were tasting the words on her lips. "Sounds pretty awesome, if you ask me."
"How is Astoria's pregnancy going?" Hermione asked, pulling Draco away from his deep thoughts.
"Chosen One's Fiancée Hiding Secret Pregnancy?" was printed in bold typeface. The letters seemed to shout at Harry, and he stood that way for several minutes, not even bothering to read the rest of the article. He was too numb at the moment.
Draco was surprised when Potter came closer and dropped his voice, eyes towards the kitchen. "Look," the brunet whispered, "I'm not sure what to do here, alright? I've already told you much more that I would have wanted, and in this case, you've found out something that not even Ron or Hermione know of."
"I can't be sure yet," Hermione admitted. "There are magical ways of determining blood relations and magical auras, of course, but these can be fooled by external factors such as volatile magical currents, or the proximity to magical substances and artifacts. There are even rituals to change or modify lineage, such as for magical adoption. In muggle science, however, there is such a thing we call DNA, which are the building blocks of every living organism."
"Long story short, my friend had to invoke an old pureblood tradition of naming parents as first of kin despite the existence of a spouse.  So it wasn't much work to get Narcissa Black's magical signature and permission..."
"Oh, and congratulations. To you and your wife. It's a big deal, having your first kid."
When Draco informed his family what Harry and Weasley had told him about the threat patterns, he was expecting some general feeling of relief. He didn't expect his mother to grow even stonier, nor his wife to be more anxious.
: (shakes hands) It was great, thanks.
Ron gave him a look, but decided not to push it. He shrugged and led Harry back down through the stairs, to where the rest of the family were celebrating the arrival of the New Year.
Narcissa nodded approvingly. "They work fast."
feeling sad that you lost your father."
Draco thanked them all, then dissolved into the fire. Harry sat back while Ron stretched. "Well," said the redhead, "let's get this party started."
in any of its Floos. A Muggleborn married to a blood-traitor, no less.
"Sorry," she apologized sheepishly. "It's only me today taking care of both Hugo and Rosie."
"...and with the combined magic of thy Father and Mother shalt thou, Scorpius Hyperion, enter this Earth to live out thy life in..." Narcissa's voice was also full of excitement, but not as much as Draco's when he felt the tug from his magical core, which meant that the Naming ritual was almost over.
Narcissa was beside herself with worry. "Has anything happened, dear?" she asked softly, "did you overtax yourself, or did you-"
Draco's eyes widened at the admission. "I - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have -"
Malfoy took the time to walk his guest to the nearest Floo, and patiently waited for Harry to step in and throw Floo powder into the flames.
Satisfied with a gurgling smile from the little boy, Draco followed the elf into the entrance hall, where mail was usually collected and magically sorted for their perusal.
"About?" Ginny inquired, but Harry said nothing. He acted as though he hadn't heard the question. "Should I be concerned?"
"Do not fret, Mother," Draco assured her with a hint of is trademark smugness. "I intend to be highly involved in this particular endeavor."
"No, of course not," he replied with a laugh of his own. "Just unexpected, that's all. Still a decent hour well before midnight, so you weren't on my list of people to expect."
He caught sight of Ginny, looking slightly harassed, trying to soothe James and stop him from bawling like a Mandrake. She saw him walk into the sitting room, the panic evident in her eyes.
The Chosen One had given Malfoy access to his Floo for the duration of his investigation in order to exchange, and told him to feel free to Floo him anytime if and only if he had made a significant discovery. It was only 11 o'clock, so Draco had no qualms about bothering Potter. Also, he would be lying to himself if he didn't admit that he wanted to be smug about it to his face.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Your estate is only keyed to the Malfoy family, right?" He knew he remembered correctly when the blonde nodded. "Do you have anyone else keyed in?"
Draco felt the man's eyes on him,  and the contempt he saw in their depths made his blood run cold.
"Why do you live here?" he suddenly asked. "It's an ancestral home, and had to be handed down."
Ron nodded miserably. "Hermione, she's gone all barmy!" he cried, then looked as if he regretted his words. "I mean, maybe it's the stress of the pregnancy. Is it the same with my sister?"
"Anyway, it should be done sometime soon, I've been timing it," Hermione added. Draco suppressed a snort of amusement. Of course she would take this on a technical level.
"Is everything alright?" Harry inquired with slight concern. It was the first time the matriarch had ever deigned to reach him without going through Draco.
The redhead clapped him on the back. "You alright, mate?"
"Well, let me put it this way. The only common things we had in our vision of the future was James. Not so much of each other," he clarified bitterly.
"And how would I be of any help, considering this is a matter of ancient pure blood magic, and not something a Muggleborn like me is likely to be privy to?"
"Merlin!" Malfoy suddenly lamented, quite out of character that Ron and Harry both burst out laughing again at the sight of his expression. "Don't get me wrong, it's not as bad as Pansy had told me, but I've been up and about just ensuring that my wife gets whatever she wants."
Harry had no idea where the words had come from but he couldn't take them back. And now that he thought about it, he didn't want to take them back.
) on his lap. The moment Healer Rosewood appeared to pull him away, Harry shot up and followed her, still holding his son and feeling both ecstatic and worried. Helen herself was a bit short of breath and looking paler.
Malfoy shrugged. "Well I just learned that both of you follow the errant ways of the Muggle," he said jokingly.
It was Malfoy's turn to laugh. "Of course not. And you two children need some adult supervision, what with all the trouble you manage to stir up everywhere you go. Bloody Gryffindors..." He threw in the powder to the flames and stepped into the hearth once it glowed emerald. His tone turned serious. "I'll owl you both with the rest of the new translations. Something tells me we're close to cracking the case."
"What-?"
Draco waited wordlessly.
He fell into a pensive silence.
"Hello, James Sirius." And he let his tears flow freely, leaning into Ginny, as they both basked in each other's presence, and that of their first born son.
"Oh, relax," he chided her. "I went out with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley last night, and we all ended up at Potter's. Neither staying over nor sharing breakfast were part of the plan, but we all got carried away with the alcohol."
"Mother, what-"
"Astoria?"
"I thought it was taking too long," he whinged, "and anyway, we'd already gotten more than the amount we initially agreed upon."
Ginny was surprised at the sudden shift in Harry's temper. "We have been working it out, Harry," she said softly. "Sure, we don't have the cookie cutter relationship, but... we've worked hard on this, maybe even harder than other people."
Teddy giggled and leaned in to whisper mischievously. "I didn't tell grandma about the extra ice cream last time, so can we have some again?" he said, eyes glancing back towards the fireplace. Sure enough, another roar echoed, and Andromeda Tonks appeared, dusting off soot from her shoulders. She beheld her grandson and his godfather, and her eyes warmed.
What was Harry supposed to say? They were having a fine time without her, it was a fact. But it was also only because they had gotten used to her being away anyway.
"Why the bloody hell are you apologizing to
"Yes, well, I can be decent when I want to be," Draco smirked. "I just enjoy bothering you too much so I make it a point to check and make sure the hour is perfectly ungodly before attempting to call you."
Apollo nodded in agreement. "It makes sense that the source would be from the British wizarding community since there is a certain degree of familiarity with Mr. Malfoy, perhaps a history. But still… whoever this is we're tracking down was at least in France for long enough to plan, produce and send the first card."
Harry nodded, playing absent-mindedly with James' chubby fingers. Ginny reached over to run her fingers through her son's hair. "Did you spend the morning with James?"
"Git."
To his relief, Draco shook his head. "Perhaps for other people," he ventured. "But for a couple of wizards as mental and traumatized as you and me, well… I don't think I could find as good a companion as you when it comes to, you know, the war."
"Please get to the point."
"Neither did I, Weasel," he said smoothly. Then he realized that a wizard from across the room was waving him over. "Speaking of work, if you'll excuse me, I really must go. The man over there is there is my six o' clock appointment."
department?"
At his words, Hermione's eyes widened. Of course she would be excited with the prospect of hidden research material. "So we
Of course, he failed.
"Well, it did take a while to convince them, but Mum became ecstatic when I mentioned that Gwenog Jones had personally requested my attendance. You know how she is."
"-sure we can fix this up by getting her back here-"
Harry looked curiously at his host. He didn't want to steer the conversation into dangerous waters this early in the day, and he was having fun. He was actually having a good time for once without having to try.
In the last few months, he and Draco had arranged regular playdates for Draco and Teddy on Sundays when their schedules permitted. It wasn't always a regular occurrence, but enough for the cousins to get to know each other better. And anyway, Harry didn't mind the extra companionship - it was much easier to handle children when there was more than one adult, after all.
mean…
It took Harry another quarter hour just to assure Andromeda, but eventually he was able to convince her to relax and go about her way. After all, she had left Teddy with Harry because she needed to take care of important family matters, and couldn't bring the boy with her. When she finally disappeared from the Floo, Harry picked Teddy up in his arms, then levitated the small trunk to the smallest bedroom, which he had long since kept for the little boy. It was almost time for bed, so they went through the routine of washing up and tucking in. When Teddy was settled and looking sleepy after Harry read to him, he yawned largely and turned on his side, which was Harry's cue to leave.
"During my probation, the DMLE would approach me for opinions about the more difficult cases." Harry and Ron both look surprised, and Draco laughed. "You wouldn't have known then, since I believe you were only training at the time. Anyway, the Minister found out that I had been instrumental in deciphering the cases that revolved around potions and poisons. That was why he encouraged that I pursue a Mastery in Potions, actually. And now I act as a confidential consultant to special cases for the Department of Mysteries."
: Thank you for having us in your home, Mr. Weasley. (muttered exchange of pleasantries). So, the first thing our readers want to know is, how are you? It's been quite a while since we've really heard news about the three of you since Mr. Potter's well-earned call for privacy, so naturally we are very curious. Let's start with you, Mr. Weasley. How has your career been?
His tone clearly told Draco that he was aware of the fact that during his monthly interviews with the Aurors, he was casually consulted regarding cases that revolved around potions and poisons. Draco could hardly call that service, since he welcomed the challenge the Aurors gave him every time they had a new puzzle they couldn't solve on their own.
"What's wrong?" he demanded, moving closer to the hearth, drowsiness and sleepwear forgotten. "What's happened?"
Potter seemed to be battling with a couple of inner demons, neither of which was close to winning, so it looked like he was fighting off the Imperius Curse.
: Well, it's been quite amazing. Harry and I basically jumped into the Auror Corps straight after the war, and we did our training for about a year and a half. You'd think after winning a war that it would be a quick cleanup, but no, we've actually had to work hard tracking down some nutters who claimed to be working under Voldemort.
Draco had never felt so insulted in his entire life. He had been kicked out of the delivery room and was just two seconds close from drawing his wand and cursing the damned Mediwizard, when his mother finally appeared and helped to pull him back to his senses.
Harry couldn't stop pacing outside the door, that Ron threatened him with an Incarcerous before he agreed to sit down and relax. Merlin, he never thought it would be this nerve wracking to wait!
was the biggest step to his goals, of course, and he had taken the Crup by its tail when he invoked it. But after that, he just wanted structure.
"What's so amusing?"
"I-" Malfoy had obviously run out of vocabulary.
"Oh, it's 'the brotherhood' now, is it?" she asked, eyebrow raised. Her eyes were sparkling with mirth though, and her lip quirked up, which Draco took to mean that she wasn't offended about the men keeping their secrets. But there was a shadow of doubt in her look, and Draco could be sure that there was something else behind her inquisitiveness that she wasn't directly volunteering. Well, he could wait.
And that was why he found himself throwing Floo powder into the hearth and shouting out Potter's address.
"So she doesn't belong where you are?"
They were given Veritaserum before being allowed to give their testimonies. Neither had even talked about how much they would say, but the truth serum made it pointless to have rehearsed something that was even an inch away from the truth. At this point, both Draco and Narcissa just wanted to get this over with.
"Sit still," he advised as gently as he could, knowing that a whirlpool of emotions was currently tormenting his friend's heart.
When her eyes began to sparkle with tears, she wiped them away with the back of her hand. Harry was surprised. Ginny never cried when she was sad. Only when she was joyous or angry. Perhaps there was always a time for firsts.
"Can we play?" Teddy was asking, eyes pleading at Harry. "Please, please pleassseee?"
: Another thing that begs questioning is your choice of career, considering your upcoming wedding.
Instead, he'd simply said "I'd love to stay." Perhaps a little too quickly. But he did mean every word.
Ron and Hermione emerged from the kitchen at that very moment, laughing about something. Harry suddenly felt quite happy and whole, as if he was seeing the entire picture of the family he had always wanted. Here he was, spending a sunny Saturday with his two best friends, his son and his godson. Then there was Malfoy, who, for some reason, fit into the grand scheme of things according to Harry's intuition.
"Hello," Malfoy said politely to Andromeda and Teddy.
Ron shrugged, as if understanding what Malfoy meant, but Harry was confused.
The brunet finally looked straight into his eyes. "No."
: That's as good as gold. Well, that’s pretty much it, our time is up anyway. Ms. Granger, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Potter, thank you very much for your time. Our readers will be grateful for this rare opportunity.
She gave out a deep sigh. "Harry, I wanted to talk to you about something," she said, her tone oddly somber that it worried him a little.
"In that case, I can understand why she might not prioritize the concept of running a family over her own ambitions. If she's spent most of her life trying to be more than the archetype of the 'Weasley Matriarch', then it's probably subconscious behavior by now," Hermione posited. "We were very close, but she was never outright or direct or aggressive about her desire to prioritize Quidditch over anything else. So I don't think her way of handling these issues are really a conscious decision."
"Yeah. We had to explain our... our change in plan to Odair, but he didn't give any indication that he cared much about the actual problem. I did appreciate that he was very professional about it," he mused.
On the contrary, even Malfoy's disposition had become... sunnier (if that were even possible on such a sharp face as his). Now that they had Scorpius and Albus, they were able to relate with each other more than they had ever expected. And during their lively exchanges, Harry always learned something new and interesting about his former enemy.
"So," Ron said after they had relaxed a little. "Why the sudden need to get pissed?"
Ron agreed. "It wouldn't beg attention since it had happened before. And with Harry's bindings, everyone will just see Malfoy hanging out with a couple of generally forgettable blokes."
He cleared his throat imperiously. "Might I remind you that I am only here on behalf of one Granger/Weasley, seeing as
It took a while, but when Ron followed the web of lines that linked and crossed and overlaid each other, he caught Harry's train of thought with a jolt of horror. "No!" he protested weakly.
Ginny's eyes widened, probably from the shock of Harry allowing Malfoy access to their son. However, she schooled her expression and took a deep breath to calm herself. "Malfoy," she nodded towards him, with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.
Draco turned to her and saw a sparkle in her eyes that meant that she was bravely keeping back tears. "No need to turn on the Aguamenti, mother!" he sighed exasperatedly, even as he informally wrapped his arm around her shoulder. Physical affection was not commonly practiced in the Malfoy line, which made both Draco and Narcissa feel smug that they were able to rebel in their own little way.
The mother of his child was going away for six weeks without coming home until after.
He turned away from Ron in an effort to hide the flush he could feel creeping up his face.
She nodded in agreement and turned back to their Healer. "Will I be allowed to go back to Montreal? I need to be there for the remainder of the month, and then back here to Britain."
"Did he give you a hard time?" Draco was only so familiar with the pressure.
The redhead warily turned to him, giving him a weak smile. Her freckles stood out even more today, because her skin was pale and clammy. "Hey," she said. "So I've got news."
"It's a mouthful!" Harry whined childishly. "So, how's Scorp doing?"
Harry turned towards Ernie Macmillan, who had been called last minute from his home to complete the elite MMI force. The Auror looked back at him. "About ten minutes, give or take," he replied curtly, indicating the blank piece of parchment in his hand. "The Unspeakables are just fine-tuning the magical signals they developed for the search. The exact coordinates should appear on this immediately."
When neither friend had anything to say, Harry finally decided to put out his worst fears.
Who knew silence could be so deafening?
: Speaking of Ms. Weasley, may I ask a few questions, Mr. Potter?
: Most of them have the same question. (laughs) How have you kept your head being the only female in your group?
"Oh," Ron turned to Harry with an apologetic look. "Sorry, mate, I forgot you're a bit unfamiliar with things like that."
The look of horror on Draco's face must have been expected, because the man smirked even more in delight. "Yeah, that's right, Who'dve guessed your pretty little wife was the center of all of this?"
, from interfering with his personal life... Of course it's a mess! Add to that the fact that Harry actually spoke for the Malfoys at their hearing, without prior warning except to the higher ups.. Well, everything's a bit overturned at the moment, because people are trying to adjust to the new policies regarding both harry and the Malfoys."
"One of the potions is to ease her pain," Narcissa explained calmly. "She drank it about an hour ago, and it seems one of the effects is a sort of dreamy lucidity."
He frowned. All Potter's note had said was that they had to go to St. Mungo's, and that he would keep Draco posted, but there weren't any real details. Only now did he realize what Hermione's worried tone might mean.
"Again!"
"I'm worried though," he continued, "she's been acting quite cold, not exactly as I pictured someone who was happy and excited to have their first child."
While Ron kept muttering his commentary to himself, Harry's eyes were drawn to the map sheet labelled 'Draco L. Malfoy'. Curious, he pulled it out and laid it on top of everything else.
As expected, they were ushered into the room full of Ministry officials, a few civilians and a couple of reporters. This was a private trial, though neither Draco nor Narcissa had any idea why they were even allowed that luxury. They didn't refuse or question, of course. At least not everyone would share the memory of seeing the once-regal Malfoys, magically bound by their wrists, awaiting judgment from people who would most definitely love to see them both thrown into Azkaban with Dementors.
"-and they just went mental! One of the - Harry, are you alright?"
"Should I call in-"
Draco frowned. "I know from personal experience just how messy this bureaucracy can be. Right after the war, Mother and I had to go through all the 'necessary channels' just to fix up the Malfoy accounts and estates, in addition to all the hassle of securing Father's treatment while in Azkaban."
"Not the way you distracted me, and
The child had the decency to look guilty, though still with a smile on his face. "I'm sorry, Draco," he mumbled, "Granma said you could be hurt if I did that without thinking. Did I hurt you?"
"I'm not saying you're not happy here, of course, and Merlin knows James loves having you around, but... I don't like seeing you turn into a shadow of yourself. It doesn't feel right."
"Well..." Rosewood cleared her throat. "I'm sure you're very familiar with what happened to Hermione Weasley's first pregnancy?"
Ginny looked at him, her expression unreadable. "I did want that. I still do. It's just... getting pregnant so early wasn't really on our plans, was it?" Harry snorted. "And now this," she said, indicating her stomach. "I just... I'm not sure about how I feel. I don't feel bad that we're having a second child, but..."
"Congratulations, Auror Potter," the Healer said brightly. "It's a healthy baby wizard!"
A Mediwitch appeared out of nowhere and brought the swaddled bundle, laying it lightly into Harry's arms.
"Ron, all Harry means is it's not what every woman wants. Being a dedicated housewife and matriarch is a very honorable and difficult decision to make, and look how happy Molly's been with how you all turned out," she said, smiling. "Look at me, I'm perfectly happy balancing our family life with a career, and it suits us just fine. Everyone has their own way of handling things."
Neither of them spoke for a while. They hadn't had a row that heated. Granted, this was prompted by her sudden admittance that she was leaving for a month and a half.
Harry had to admit that breakfast wasn't nearly as awkward as he had expected it to be. Granted, it was only him and Malfoy dining together, so he felt no need to put up an impression as he would have had to with the other two Malfoys.
"Er..." For the first time in a while, Draco found himself speechless. He had only just realized what an awkward position this put him in. "Well....."
"Erm..." Harry fidgeted. "We were hoping to explain it when we tell them about the pregnancy..."
"Do I really have to?" Draco all but whined. His mother was unimpressed.
As he said his goodbyes and reassurances to the sobbing brunette and eventually closed his Floo, Draco's mind was filled with a mix of emotions. There was a bit of trepidation, some anxiety and a handful of relief, and even a sense of responsibility at being depended upon. And a hint of happiness as well. A sense of urgency. It appeared that he couldn't wait until he could finally show Potter that he could be a good friend, too.
"And Astoria has no Black blood, which means she can't give her own as the sacrifice."
Draco realized she was partly right. Out of habit, he would analyze and overanalyze and reanalyze, if that was even a word.
Malfoy shuddered, which Harry thought was odd to watch seeing as he was a head floating in tongues of flame. He was probably thinking of Voldemort, too, but neither of them acknowledged it.
Perhaps the child had broken him after all.
Funnily enough, what stood out the most from Draco's memory was when Potter had taken him aside after the trial and personally thanked him for all his help. The gratitude, which could have been expressed in two words (or even one), had lasted a good six minutes and punctuated with much 'manly' hugs and pats on the back. Draco, who had been brought up with a slight aversion to physical affection (strictly limited from Lucius and embarrassingly exaggerated from Narcissa) found that he liked it.
The brunet blushed and took a nervous sip. "Er… I was just wondering, since you mentioned your dad… how is it that you don't think he's behind all the threats?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Meaning?"
"Not really," replied Ron, looking defeated. "But I had to tell him something. Man's going mental and we're not getting much headway into this bloody case. Nothing makes sense!"
"Simple card and envelope, untraceable, just said one thing. '
Hermione looked about to cry. "Did you and Ginny have a row?" she asked in a gentle voice.
She folded herself into Harry's waiting arms and basked in the warmth. It seemed funny to Harry that they could still be that kind of couple when they technically hadn't even fixed the problems they had over the six week separation. Sometimes he saw it as a good thing - he would hate if he and Ginny ever stopped talking to each other every single time they fought. He liked that they were quite mature about such disagreements, never allowing anything to come between them. Not once did they ever sleep in separate rooms even after major fights. But then again, it irked him sometimes that their periods of truce over the years had never actually helped them to fix some problems.
Harry thought well about his next choice of words. "You know, there won't be anything wrong with you being more in touch with your child," he said softly. "I'm sure your mother would agree, given your own childhood. I'm not telling you to disregard your own traditions, but maybe listen to your own instincts for a change, you know?"
"Draco!"
"Good morning, Mister Potter, sir, if Mister Potter would please stops hitting himself," the elf squeaked. "Master Draco has told Dilly to attend to you after you wakes up, sir. What breakfast would sir like to have?"
On one hand, it meant that it was officially illegal to do anything that would be detrimental to or interfering with Potter's personal life. Printing libelous information and using his image without permission were illegal. His properties were considered off limits unless he himself opened them. On the other hand, limitations were also placed on Potter to prevent him from abusing the circumstances of his warding. He was punishable under the law should he use the power of the wards to hurt others, inflict damage or cause disturbances within the magical community. He also had no power over what people said around him or thought about him. Not that anyone would actually verbally insult Potter to his face. Only Draco did that, of course. He would never allow for a moment to pass between them without having the upper hand.
Malfoy shook his head, which confused Harry. "Thank you, Potter," he said, still all smiles. "It's so odd that only three people know of this 'scandalous rebellion', and you're one of them."
"But?" Harry knew in his heart that there was a 'but'. There always was.
Malfoy glanced at Ron's sleeping form, then turned back to Harry. "Maybe it's because we've got more in common than anyone thinks," he muttered.
This morning had been a perfect portrait of a happy family in Harry's eyes. And he knew that now, with Ginny coming back to him, it was even more complete. Overwhelmed with their emotions, both he and Ginny fell to the floor, kneeling awkwardly and still holding tight to each other, finally breaking down from the sudden release of tension, their tears flowing unashamedly. Neither made a move to stand, or to leave. It had been a long six weeks, after all.
That afternoon when he slowly walked back to his cabin he scooped up the fallen hornbeam seed clusters along the way. He was just picking a few seeds out of their husks when he stepped around to the front of the cabin to find Potter sitting on his front step.
They ran through some specifics on the order that they would be working on the various charms, but once their tea was gone and the topic exhausted there was still a torrential downpour outside so they called it a day. The enormous chair was Vanished as soon as Potter had Disapparated, and Draco set about washing the mugs.
Draco worked slowly and carefully, wanting to make sure that whatever happened, the tests the following day were productive so that they could return to their prior progress. By the time his stomach was demanding dinner he had finished, and after a quiet meal he and Potter retired to the drawing room, where Kreacher had two glasses and a bottle of some sort waiting for them.
Vince hooted at the man reproachfully, ruffling his feathers.
“Er, sorry about your clothes. But also I’m not sorry at all,” he said with a grin, and Draco rolled his eyes.
It clearly took a few seconds for the words to take hold and Potter blinked a few times, before blustering, “What? What do you mean, both of us?”
for pestering Potter, sat there uncertainly, partly thrilled at the attention and the frustration that he had drawn from the other man, but also unsettled by the amount of hurt that had been in his voice when he’d spoken of Draco not surviving space.
“Outside,” Potter said, nonplussed. Draco shrugged and rose to tidy up. “You’ve been sleeping outside.”
He followed as Potter led them over, the smells of shellfish and butter filling his nostrils as they drew close. Then the man ordered them each a lobster roll and a can of something effervescent, which they cracked open and sipped at while the woman inside bopped around to some music and assembled their food.
“Are you sure? I’ve learned a bunch of healing spells over the years because of Teddy. I’m sure I can heal it—”
that were moving about inside them.
getting Potter to agree to Thursdays?”
“Kreacher will be fetching a damp towel for Master’s guest. May Kreacher clean up this . . . mess?”
The boy’s eyes lit up and giggled, and Draco caught Potter looking at him with bright eyes and a tender smile. He hastily looked away, glancing around the room for somewhere to sit and sank into an empty armchair near the door.
Draco hadn’t opened his eyes yet.
That first Monday Draco spent the morning in the bath, wallowing as he hadn’t in weeks, or possibly months. The afternoon was spent curled up under his quilt with only his head emerging from it, knowing that all that remained of his spaceflight project was fastening the set of three brooms to the trunk and furnishing the interior of the expanded space.
“Well . . . yeah?” Potter looked nonplussed. Then there was a sudden look of comprehension. “Oh. They’re not together, you know. Ron married Susan Bones a few years back. Ron and Hermione failed spectacularly at being a couple for about four years before they finally called it quits. To everyone’s relief including their own.”
“All right, on three let’s swap. I’ll toss you mine up high, you toss low. One—two—three.”
The next day Draco finished trimming his corner posts and on Wednesday he worked late into the night assembling the rectangular planks into a roof that he could install once the walls were built, only stopping when the bright quarter moon was directly overhead. Thursday brought terrible weather but also a horrid day of classes about muggle festive celebrations, during which they were required to sing, so rather than stay in from the freezing mess he immediately set to work upon returning home.
Potter gave him an odd look. “I promise you, they were. Look—” He pointed toward a collection of huts some twenty yards farther down the pier, one of which had a large red painted rendition of one of those horrible carapaced insect things on the side of it. “We can grab something to eat up there and ask the locals all about lobsters.”
“Sorry you had to see that, old friend,” he said with a grin, then rose, stretched, and went to clean himself up.
“He’s been talking about me, then?” Draco asked flatly.
He shrugged. “As I said, I plan to adjust the steering and braking. And the Sticking Charms are a safety precaution so that I don’t get separated.”
Draco swiped his wet hair back out of his face.“If you wait too long you’ll need to fight the woodpecker for it. And she frightens you,” he helpfully pointed out, with a smile.
that were stacked in a corner of Potter’s kitchen. Draco hadn’t read a single issue since his release, not wanting to face how the world had carried on without him. And as he read the more recent issues, he felt a muddled mixture of jealousy and pride for his former friends who seemed to be doing rather well for themselves, considering.
Not an Auror. That was unexpected. Suddenly, his tiny amount of interest in this conversation vanished as exhaustion swept through him. “Merlin, you always were so much work,” he muttered, running a hand over his face, before saying louder, “Well, say your piece.” Then he turned walked back into his cabin, leaving the door open while he retrieved the previous day’s soup from the pantry and set it to heating on the small wood stove.
Once they’d arrived at the cabin Draco selected a piece of wood from his woodpile and applied the same charms to it, then tossed it back and forth between his hands while he decided where to put it. He ended up setting it vertically next to his front step, partially buried so that it wouldn’t be carried off by particularly strong winds.
liquefied his brains. The owl looked thoroughly unimpressed.
Draco rolled his eyes, dissecting his last bit of sandwich.
All trace of pleasantries vanished as they delved into a discussion of the various items on their list, and it was determined that they would be testing the thresholds of the Atmospheric Charms, Hermione having prepared some spells that would send the temperature plummeting within a designated radius. They had moved onto a conversation about muggle heat sources when a loud crack outside announced Potter’s arrival.
That is where I’ve chosen to end things.
Draco had a few more bites before he asked, “I’m guessing she doesn’t know you’re sharing it with me?”
Black. That brought him back to the faint memories of gloomy visits when he was only a few years old.
And still, he waited, but his joints were only becoming stiffer the longer he sat in the chair.
A bit over an hour later he landed, satisfied that the addition didn’t seem to negatively affect manoeuvrability in any way, nor did it get dislodged at any point.
Then there were soft lips pressing against his in a slow, gentle kiss.
“This is brilliant,” Potter replied, sounding dazed. Then he appeared to realise who he was speaking to and yanked his hand back, stuffing it into a pocket.
One of the nearby workers laughed and made eye contact, having clearly overheard at least some of his words. “Never seen a lobster, eh?”
“Three should be good.”
His mother stood there for some twenty minutes, and Draco could make out the sight of her lips moving, though whatever words she spoke were quiet enough that he couldn’t hear any of them. Then she gave a small smile and crouched to lay her flowers on the snow-covered patch of earth next to the marker, and left to return to Draco’s side.
Potter’s eyes widened then he shook his head, and Draco felt himself immediately relax. “No, just the one. Unfortunately. I’m sure that if she had a second one she’d spend all her time there rather than here.”
And then, once again not quite remembering falling asleep, he was blinking his eyes awake and frowning at the weight that was on him, realising that Potter must have returned at some point and placed a blanket over him. His frown deepening slightly, he slowly sat up and heard some movement just outside of the room.
“Well, Mr Malfoy, congratulations on remaining in the land of the living,” she said tersely as she waved her wand over him. “I’ve explained to your friend Mr Potter here that you are to rest for the next month to allow your body to finish recovering from whatever you did to land you here in such a state,” she said a few minutes later with a narrow look.
Draco, meanwhile, was quietly grateful that he had been all but ordered to do nothing for a month. He knew that if he’d been alone at home he’d have spent much of his time keeping busy and overexerting himself; his shoulders frequently ached, and occasionally tingled or went numb.
Then he realised that his quilt had a warm arm around his chest and a hard cock pressed up against his back and groaned, pressing back into it, idly musing that Vince was going to be bloody furious with him once he finally made it home but he didn’t quite care at the moment.
“Not today,” he replied, looking down at his hands. “I let Vince out, and I’ll need to let him back in since he’s a princess when it comes to winter.”
Draco shot him a bewildered look and was ignored.
They both stood in a comfortable silence for some time, first watching as a squirrel leapt from branch to branch, making its way past the cabin, then simply looking out at the winter landscape.
Openly rolling his eyes Draco stepped further into the cabin, peeled off his wet shirt and replaced it with a dry one. By the time he’d hung up the other shirt to dry Potter had finally made it to the doorway and was standing there, still not speaking, still staring, and also dripping all over his floor.
“I could probably build a small addition,” he said to Vince. “What do you think? Maybe put in a real bath? Another window for you?”
“It’s fine,” Potter said, shrugging easily once he’d stepped up beside Draco. “Gives us more time to see the sights, anyway.”
Breathing rapidly he looked around, finding himself in a tangle of sheets on what was definitely Potter’s bed, though the man was not present. And, seeing the quality of the light that managed to make it in through the clouded window he gathered that it was later than usual for him to be waking up, since it was definitely well past dawn.
couldn’t believe they were being paid for.
of a clue what was happening. I—I yelled a lot more, at that point. Didn’t do any good though,” Potter added with a hollow laugh.
“From this side of the island we’re blocked from view, so the muggles in Wembury won’t see us. There are apparently plenty of wrecks in these waters from the past few centuries so I figure that will be something interesting to explore while I’m testing things out.” He flicked his gaze upward, then added, “I’ll keep a
He heard her walk over in the direction that he’d indicated, and for a few minutes there was the clinking sound of her inspecting his creations.
“Sure, in a cartoony way. What, never seen one before?” She glanced over at Draco before turning back to whatever she was doing on the flat top grill. “They turn red like that after you cook them, but they’re dark when they come out of the water. Overall that’s more or less what they look like though!”
Draco rolled his eyes again and chucked a fresh towel at the idiot then popped the kettle on the stove, preparing two mugs.
“Oh, right. Well did you need writing things? It’s no trouble—”
Draco grimaced. “The Manor.”
“Can I help you?” he asked, arching a brow.
He was trying to tug it away from Draco, and failing, as Draco’s grip tightened. He gave Potter a hard glare and said, “As I told you, I need to test it. I’ve purchased this broom. It belongs to me. I can do what I like to it.”
If only the bloody
Draco tossed the broom over to him and kept his gaze on his face while he caught it, watching as a large bubble immediately formed around his head.
Another streak of lightning, then a crack of thunder, this one only delayed by a second.
Before he forgot Draco jotted out a quick note for Flourish and Blotts and set it on his work surface, hoping that they could be as quick with fulfilling this request as they’d been with the previous order. “Vince, do you mind grabbing that once the rain lets up? No need to head out in this mess.”
“Yes.” Then he cursed when he accidentally split the branch, so he tossed the splintered pieces of wood aside and worked on a third that he’d grabbed.
Draco nodded and withdrew his wand, planning on casting the several protective spells that they’d previously discussed at length. Then he hesitated. “Actually, it’s probably better if I’m not the one to cast these, at least not here. I’d rather not be under suspicion because I’ve cast multiple advanced defensive spells within the Ministry, even if those spells aren’t restricted for me and you’ve said that I’m permitted to be here.”
When Draco awoke the second time, he was suddenly very much wide awake.
He released Potter’s hands and, hips still jerking erratically, reached around him to finish him off, only noticing as his hand encountered a very wet door that the man had already climaxed.
“You built it by hand?”
He reached down and grabbed Potter by the front of his shirt and hauled him to his feet, wrapping his other hand around his neck and bringing their lips together.
He felt the raw emotion in Potter’s voice and swallowed hard, his eyes burning.
Potter snorted. “You have to know how much of a prat you sound like, talking like that.”
Draco waited, and Potter’s mouth scrunched up into a guilty expression.
Swing—
“Fuck, I could do this every day,” Potter breathed, his hand reaching down to wrap around both of their cocks, pumping them loosely in a fist.
Draco felt entirely bewildered by the events of the past ten minutes but he carefully sat up the rest of the way and swung his legs off the side of the bed. “Do you mind giving me a few minutes to get dressed?”
“Yeah, yeah, no paperwork until we’re back to the dull procedural work and awful hours,” Potter replied. “He knows. Didn’t stop him from talking my ear off about how excited he is to have us back soon. Can’t believe it’s already almost March.”
“I didn’t really notice the cold, at first. I didn’t feel it. But I knew that my body needed shelter, so I did what I had to do. I threw together the barest example of a shelter at first with a campfire so that I wouldn’t die of exposure, and then spent the winter building the cabin.”
A cloying sort of fear bubbled up within him and he temporarily felt that awful trapped feeling but he took a slow breath and ruthlessly squashed it. “All right. I’ll stay.”
Once he’d been lying on the blanket looking up at the stars for some time, tracing the Black constellations that he’d grown up learning about, he said quietly, “They’ve been up there, you know?” He didn’t know where Vince was, couldn’t see him in the dark, nor could he hear the silent hunter, but he knew that the owl was out there somewhere. He always was. “Muggles have been to space. They managed it decades ago. Before my parents were even at Hogwarts.”
“What is all of this?” he asked, his disgust present in his tone.
Draco swallowed and his fingers gripped the edge of the counter tightly.
The sting of his scalp shot a piercing jolt through him, his arousal intensified by the confusing slice of mild pain and he screwed his eyes shut, his head dipping slightly as he fought to hold on and not come just quite yet. And then there were fingernails scraping down the sensitive skin of his scarred and mottled chest and he cried out, the sensation surprising him into a few uncontrollable snaps of his hips and then he was spilling his climax into Potter, hips jerking hard into him.
It was only a minute or so before the kettle started whistling, and in hardly any time they were both sitting with their tea.
Kreacher immediately disappeared, then reappeared a few seconds later along with a long dining table that looked like it could easily seat twenty. A snap of his fingers later had the table arranged along the length of the room, running under the open window.
“Have some tea.”
“But. . . .” Potter looked completely nonplussed.
His eyes widened slightly at that. “How did you manage to keep that from them? I would have guessed that if Weasley knew, they all would. I thought they were a close family,” he hastened to clarify, not wanting to start a row over a perceived slight. Especially since Potter had more or less managed to contain his emotional outbursts recently.
The arms tensed again, this time not relaxing immediately. “But you’re planning on coming back.”
like nothing else has been, not since—well, it’s been real. And Britain will always be there later. I can always go back. But. . . . I don’t want to not do this now and always regret it when it’s ten years down the road and I feel trapped.”
There was a snort beside him and he cracked his eyes open and looked over. Next to him Potter was now sprawled out on his side facing him, his head resting in his hand as he propped it up with his elbow.
“Kreacher has brought a towel,” the house-elf said with a small bow. “Is Master’s guest needing anything else?”
He heard Potter set his glass down on the table, then the front door opening. “Happy Christmas, Malfoy.”
Draco finished dealing with the last tangle and leaned against the wall of the narrow hallway, tucking the comb into a trouser pocket. “She didn’t know I was in there. She doesn’t know about spaceflight yet.”
Unexpected, but then again he didn’t really know them other than their base characteristics when they’d been teenagers. Given that he had certainly grown up from his horrid younger self, it was easy enough to imagine that they might have changed too. He gave a vague sort of nod, then returned to his meal.
He nodded, curious about the supposed secure facility that she had access to. “Absolutely. We’ll meet here?”
“‘Mione, it’s been ages,” Potter said, his voice muffled. They broke apart and he looked down at the thermos she was still clutching, then asked, “Oh wow is that coffee? Yes
Potter didn’t exactly sleep for the week like he’d said but he did spend the next several days in a bleary state of semi-consciousness, popping up at odd hours for brief conversations before vanishing again.
“So tell me about the ‘heat stuff’, as you so eloquently put it.”
It was a week before Potter returned.
Draco opened the bottle and sniffed at it, then poured two glasses of thick ruby liquid. Port, possibly. He took a cautious sip and nearly sighed at the warmth that filled him.
“Now for shielding.” She pulled what looked like a plain tree branch out of her bag. “I thought we might test on this, to make sure that the results aren’t being negatively impacted by the broom enchantments.”
“Correct.”
He made a strangled sound in his throat and withdrew the sad-looking broom that was missing most of its bristles. He handed it over to Hermione, almost reverently, frowning when she let out the tiniest titter of laughter.
, but also after reading his muggle books further the larger surface area of the shielding would likely cause even
“Vince, tell me that was just the mead. That it was fortified, and that I’m a lightweight.”
“Smiles, kisses, a fucking blow job against the wall to, ‘Oh, I’ll just make excuses to avoid seeing your face, Malfoy.’ What
Potter rolled his eyes again, then glanced at Draco and muttered, “As far as Nimbus knows it was only once.”
“Whoa.” Potter’s eyes widened and darted around, clearly taking in the effect, then dropped the broom on the ground. The faintly visible outline of the bubble vanished immediately.
“So, want to talk about your panic over lobster back there?”
“Merlin,” he muttered, then coughed a few times as he inhaled some of it.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “I am a perfectly capable wizard, Potter.”
Draco gave her a nod and followed her down the stairs as she made her way to the ground floor. When they were just passing the first floor landing there was a loud crack of Apparition and Draco flinched.
“I should probably head home,” Potter said in a strange voice. “It’s getting late. The platters are already charmed to keep things preserved, so you don’t need to worry about them turning for at least a week.”
Well, he certainly would have appreciated a little warning that they would be Apparating to the fucking Ministry.
And then all too soon Hermione was gone and it was just Draco and Potter in the clearing, and he felt like he was spinning out of control.
“I know. Two more weeks and we’ll be back home, and you’ll be able to stretch your wings in the woods rather than the city.”
It was generous of her, he decided, to allow them to pretend that they were new acquaintances without a horrible shared history. And though Potter had assured him that his friends would be reasonable, he kept waiting for the other shoe to drop as they each politely greeted him and shook his hand. Susan—because of course Hermione insisted on first names for everyone—even had a small smile for him, which he found quite surprising given that she as an Auror should certainly be one of the most suspicious out of those present.
at how Potter could somehow turn being the most infuriating man on the planet into something charming.
none of your business.”
He was just beginning to tackle the flies on the man’s denims when he felt the knot in his hair come undone, then his head was yanked back as Potter delivered a stinging bite to his bottom lip, then dropped his mouth to kiss, bite, and suck at every sensitive part of his neck.
Draco gave him a nod then opened his door, stepping inside a moment later. It wasn’t until he had a portion of bone broth bubbling on the wood stove that he heard the crack of Disapparition from outside.
Though those thoughts were promptly stalled when Draco caught sight of a stack of strange cages in one of the warehouses. Forgetting himself, he reached out and clutched Potter’s arm, nodding toward the
There was some more silence, during which he finished his soup and turned to wash his dishes. When he finished rinsing them he turned to see Potter still standing in the doorway, his eyes roaming the interior of the cabin.
“Oh, he seemed to think that you’d be quite angry that he spoke to me about you. Which I can understand, of course,” she explained matter-of-factly.
Potter dithered about the matter for the next hour, because of course he did, but finally agreed to invite his usual group of friends over for lunch. At half ten Draco gathered up his notes from the drawing room and retreated to his room.
The two of them finished off their drinks and headed back toward the hut to deal with their refuse, since they didn’t have enough privacy to vanish any of it. And before they continued on, Potter cajoled him into standing in front of that monstrous red painting of a lobster and snapped a photograph on his mobile.
“Can you tell me what house this is?” Draco asked, realising that the elf was also somehow familiar, reminding him of a childhood visit that he couldn’t quite place.
—before it shattered satisfyingly.
Draco chanced a look up as Eddie’s parents rose to their feet and approached to collect him, and accidentally caught sight of Potter. Who was still looking at him like
“But you’re on the Ministry’s restricted list for purchases,” he interrupted, “and when you’re buying
He shook his head, then muttered, “It doesn’t matter.” Still frowning, he turned to the kettle that was just beginning to whistle and set about making tea.
, if you can’t abide an ambiguous ending there is a tiny epilogue for you in the next chapter.
On Monday morning Draco sent off requests for owl order forms to half a dozen companies he knew of that made luggage, tents, and sheds, then immersed himself in some reading. If the texts he had purchased on space previously had been easy enough for him to understand, given his moderate knowledge of muggle terminology, Hermione’s book was not the same. He was frequently flipping to the glossary to check on the complex words, and had even started a list of words that weren’t defined in the glossary nor in the text itself. But she had told him that she would look through any words or concepts that he was confused about when she visited next, and explain what she could.
Once they’d made their way to the clearing Draco compared the lingering charmwork around the piece of wood, the two brooms, and the rock, determining that the Extension Charms on Potter’s bag did in fact cause the Atmospheric Charms to fade much faster. In comparing the materials the stone seemed to retain the heat better, so Draco located a smaller one nearby and set to work enchanting it. Then he looked over at Potter.
Vince flapped his wings a bit through he didn’t take off from his perch, then he ruffled his feathers.
He felt himself paling at the thought that the terrifying woman he’d visited on her deathbed as a child had just been forced to listen to them both have loud and desperate sex.
He nodded firmly, then turned back to the child and said, “I’m pleased to meet you, Norbert. My name is Draco. I was also named after a dragon.”
“Later, Malfoy,” Draco repeated to himself quietly a moment later, amused, shaking his head slightly.
By then they’d carried on between two buildings and a breeze picked up, one which carried away the somewhat stale smell of the alley and brought instead freshness. Salt. Childhood memories of summer days spent at a small beach in Cornwall.
Draco threaded his hands into his mane of hair and held his head, eyes closed, trying to calm his breathing. As much as he hated to admit it, he was just going to hurt himself if he continued in this weather. Especially if Potter insisted on continuing his yelling and distracting him, which of course he would.
Draco sighed and pointed out, “I remember saying a month ago that I didn’t want to talk about it.”
Draco turned away from him and strode out to the centre of the clearing, more to give himself some space from the man than anything, and firmly wrenched his attention back toward the subject at hand.
He heard the heavy exhale from the man next to him but he couldn’t look away from the door. “Right then. I’ll see you there. I’m with you, remember.” Then there was a loud crack.
“It’s empty up there. It’s quiet up there. There’s no good. There’s no bad, or wrong, or evil. No letters. No expectations. No people.”
He glanced over, his frown not fading as he put on his shirt. “Who or what exactly are you talking about?”
He shook his head, then gestured broadly toward the collection of vials and jars at the right end of the table. “Nothing left, at least until we test those.”
“I’ll need to get going, I’m afraid. I’ve got a meeting starting in half an hour and I’ll need to grab some things from my office first. Draco, will you want to do some heat shield testing in my lab this Sunday?”
“What do you know about ultraviolet radiation?”
If only the hotel didn’t have a bloody dignitary staying in it, meaning any use of any magic whatsoever had to be run through about fifty levels of clearance regardless of whether they might all die of heat stroke.
It was a few minutes later that Potter apparently felt able to move, as he gently separated them and turned, cupping his cheek with a hand.
He nodded, kicking up clumps of snow as he walked. “Today, I think. Might as well while I’ve my mind on the project.”
“It suits you,” Potter said suddenly, either five or twenty-five minutes later. Draco looked up, and the man gave a vague sort of gesture toward his head, likely indicating his beard or his hair or possibly both.
Potter followed a few seconds later, and Draco put the kettle on.
Swing.
“I know you just woke up, but do you want to get some sleep? Or we can have a drink and I’ll catch you up on what’s been going on.”
He couldn’t help the way he inhaled sharply at the name, and he hated the fact that Potter definitely noticed. His hands found the edge of the counter behind him and tightened as he summoned a sneer and said, “I’m not your
Potter huffed, a reluctant-looking smile spreading across his face. “Always such a prat,” he mumbled, before taking the two steps forward and leaning into him, bringing their lips together for a long, tender kiss.
“Why not?” he repeated in the same tone.
He found it more and more difficult to distract himself with his research so turned instead toward the trunk that Kreacher had brought him. It was one of those that he had ordered for his space project, and he hadn’t yet begun to enchant it nor any of the other trunks and tents. So, after emptying the clothing and towels into the room’s wardrobe he set to work.

The heavy, warm weight on his eyes seemed to ground him, and Harry hummed contently as he allowed his body to relax again. Around him the noise of the forest seemed to soften until there were only mere whispers disturbing the silence.

This is a shorter chapter, sorry about that. It's also not proof-read because I'm professional like that. As predicted, my work place has decided that days after days of 36+°C summer heat was the perfect opportunity to bury me in stuff to do. Great times.
: a horrible potions accident will kill half of the students
: u never heard this from me but snape REALLY likes compliments about how smart he is and stuff. Not about his appearance he gets defensive and closes off, but he knows he’s smart and he likes to hear it.

: well how did they think centaurs came to be?
: wow harry this looks kinda bad

Voldemort appeared much earlier during the battle in the ministry and he was there when Bellatrix almost killed Sirius. In the books it’s clearly stated that Bellatrix fired a RED spell at Sirius which could have been a stunner. That means Sirius wasn’t dead when he fell into the veil – he died because of the veil. In this story however, Harry saw what was about to happen and apparated to Sirius’ side to push him away from the veil. By doing this he accidentally fell inside the veil (“the void”). In my theory, the veil traps souls, not bodies. However, because of the horcrux, Harry has TWO souls – or at least one whole soul and a tiny part of Voldemort’s soul. If we say the veil is somehow related to dementors, we can assume that it prefers souls with a lot of negative emotions (sorrow, hatred, fear etc.). And while Harry’s soul is definitely marred, it has nothing on Voldemort’s. So the veil decided to keep Voldemort’s soul and let Harry go again (since it only needs one soul). However, by keeping the part of Voldemort’s soul, it somehow dragged the other parts of Voldemort’s soul into the veil as well (because it requires a whole soul). Therefore, all parts of Voldemort’s soul have been dragged inside the veil and he’s officially dead.

: I just wanted to announce myself in some way
Conclusion?
He voiced his doubts and the snake seemed to tighten around his head for a second.
: Thanks:????!?!?!
Harry suddenly wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and dream. He wanted to not have to make this decision. But then he remembered the cell and the fury he felt during the first days of his captivity. He remembered feeling helpless and suddenly he felt the overwhelming desire to never feel like that again.

Dumbledore looked up from where he was writing a letter when he heard Fawkes vanish in a high flame. He frowned lightly. The phoenix normally stayed by his side except for when he asked him to deliver an urgent message. This was the first time he could remember his familiar to simply disappear without even a short warning. The old wizard looked back at the letter and suppressed a sigh. The new school year was about to begin, and still there was no sign of Harry Potter to be found. The Order members had searched everywhere, and they where still searching, but it was difficult to keep believing. Although Dumbledore hated the thought, he had to start making plans for the eventuality that the foreseen savior of the wizarding world was dead.
: Where have you been?!
: but like I wasn’t aware I was holding my breath
“I know, darling. And I’ve never been prouder of you than the day you entered my room and told me that you would never follow that madman. I would have followed you gladly, no matter which path you would have chosen. But now I will walk along, at your side and I will do so with my head held high.” She took a deep breath and raised her wand, leaving it directly in front of her face as if she was about to fight a duel. “And that is why I will do this, Draco, with joy in my heart. I don’t care about the consequences; I know this is the right thing to do.”
Hermione sighed and closed the book. “The Order members will find out about it immediately, you know that. And then they will know that we want to search for Harry. As if it is so surprising that we don’t trust them to find Harry without us – when did they ever manage to do something without us?” Her voice was bitter, the strain of worrying constantly for weeks obvious in her face.

As Mr. Seamus Finnigan’s Head of House, I am writing you in regards to his feedback for this school year. Hogwarts has decided to introduce this evaluation as a method to increase transparency of the education system and your son’s development.

can’t understand it, then it must be complete nonsense anyway. And if we can’t find a solution, we will simply apparate to the house of those muggle relatives of Harry, magical signature be damned.”
Dumbledore sighed and forced himself to be patient while waiting for Severus. The situation of the young Malfoy was something else that he hadn’t been able to predict. He had been so sure, even at the end of the boy’s fifth year, that he was completely under the control of his father. Instead he had watched the boy become more and more miserable and frightened during his sixth year, spending the holidays with Severus in Hogwarts instead of returning home. He sighed. Of course he was pleased that the boy had found the braveness to choose the right side in the war, but he wasn’t easily controlled. Dumbledore preferred to be able to control even the small things. But right now that wasn’t important, and he allowed himself to tap his food once, showing his growing impatience.

Dumbledore gestured towards the back door of his office. Together they walked down the hidden staircase which led directly out of the castle. On their way down, the Headmaster explained the sudden wave of power being released freely into the world that he had felt before.
: oh look

"No. Fred's a bit insensitive sometimes, but never cruel. Remember how he tried to attack Draco in first year when he called you a- well, when he was being horrible to you? He would never hurt you, Hermione. If he's asked you to the ball, it's because he likes you." Harry said, definitively.
"Right, well, Ron, we ought to get dates. The dance isn't far off." Harry suggested, trying to change the subject before Ron got himself punched.
,” Draco heard a scream from somewhere below him. The stupid girl was going to get herself killed, whimpering like that.
"Crying? What are you on about, Potter? I have not been doing any such thing, it's not yet six in the morning, I'm simply tired and if my eyes look red, that's why. Not that it's any of your business." Malfoy snapped.
"Yeah, I'm not so concerned with all that, to be honest," Ron snickered. "Have you seen the size of her-"
"Well, yeah, I meant maybe d'you want to go with me? As friends, of course," He scratched the back of his head, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment from embarrassment. When he opened them, Luna looked positively radiant.
"And your family?" Harry would never admit it, but he had felt a pang of jealousy at the Quidditch World Cup when he saw how Lucius and Narcissa doted on their son. They were a pair nearly as unbearable as the Dursleys, but if he was truthful, he'd been jealous of Dudley on more than one occasion as well.
"Don't get near me, dirty half blood. Go back to licking Dumbledore's boots or whatever it was you were doing," muttered Malfoy in a low tone as Harry stepped closer into the shadows.
But how could it be good to celebrate the death of a kid? Harry had just been a boy, really. Sure, Draco had wanted to beat him at Quidditch, and he had wanted to win the House Cup, but he had never wished him
Had he been better, though? Draco knew that his blood was more pure than that of Potter. Potter’s mother had been a mud blood, and Draco’s lineage was as clean as you could find. But maybe Draco had been wrong to think that made him better. Maybe better meant bravery, and fighting for what’s right.
“HARRY,” Draco yelled, sprinting down the steps to him.
“Listen, Malfoy. Your creepy, inbred family hasn’t got a drop of muggle blood in it, you’re right about that. But it hasn’t got a drop of humanity or goodness in it either. You say you don’t have any friends? Maybe if you occasionally thought something for yourself instead of going along with whatever your scumbag father says, that wouldn’t be the case.” Harry turned away from Malfoy, grabbed his broomstick, and stood on the banister of the tower. He hesitated for a moment, unsure why he so hated the idea of leaving the blood elitist maniac alone, but quickly collected himself and soared back to the open window of the Gryffindor dormitory, where the fourth year boys still slept soundly.
“It’s not, I swear it on my life. No, that no longer means anything, I could throw that away in a second without hesitation. I swear it on the life of the person whom I have come to discover means the most to me.”
"Ooh, that's an excellent idea, Ron. She's really sweet," Hermione smiled. "Although, not necessarily the brightest," she added.
"Hello, Harry Potter," Luna grinned up at him from the bench of the table. "Having a lovely morning, I hope?"
"Oh, nothing really, the lake just looks nice for swimming in, don't you think?" she smiled softly, as if she could see something nobody else could.
"You get nervous when she's around, you hate seeing her upset, and you've never been as angry as you were at the mere thought of people treating her poorly," Hermione grinned.
"What the bloody hell do you mean, you've got someone? Who?" Ron demanded, incredulous.
"Thanks, Harry," she reached up on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek before skipping back to her breakfast at the Ravenclaw table.
“Draco, what happened? How did you get-”
,” Draco incanted, casting a shield around Harry and himself. “Look, I know I’ve screwed up. I’m sorry, I never meant for anything to get this out of hand, but listen. I’m a bad person and a talented wizard. You’re a good person and a relatively shit wizard- no, don’t interrupt me, you can cast spells fine, but under pressure your brain gets addled and you’re essentially useless. Let me help you. Please.”
"Hello," he smiled at her. "Can't you sleep either?"
“Bit busy, Malfoy. Getting rid of the mess you and your family helped create, you know,” Harry snapped at him bitterly. “
"Lavender Brown, that pretty blonde girl who's mates with Parvati," Ron muttered.
This is a really short chapter because I just wanted to pull a little focus to Harry and Hermione's friendship to push my own private agenda lmfao sorry. Be proud of me for not sneaking any Harmione into this tho because I ship them so hard and it was difficult. Stan the friendship too tho
“Draco, let me see your hand,” Harry said, grabbing Malfoy’s wrist before he could pull away and turning it towards him. Harry at once saw the cause of Malfoy’s pained expression, as three parallel deep cuts stretched across his palm.
“Harry Potter,” The Dark Lord paused, evidently for effect. Bloody drama queen. “is dead.”
"Hang on. If you didn't compare to Angelina Johnson, why is it he's asked you and not her?" Harry protested, taking Hermione's tiny hand in both of his.
Deep in thought, Draco was interrupted by a burst of sound. Harry’s body had fallen from Hagrid’s arms. No, no it hadn't.
"Jealous, are we?" Fred joked.
Harry nearly whooped aloud, but caught himself, remembering that the only way he could fly was if nobody knew he was doing it. He pulled up on his broom, wanting to see if Luna was awake yet. He barreled towards the Ravenclaw Tower, slightly wobbly from a lack of practice, but still Harry James Potter, the youngest seeker in a century. He flew around the tower a couple of times, hoping that it wasn't creepy to have a look in the Ravenclaw common room. Harry pulled to a stop for a moment, and there she was, sitting criss cross on a big round table, reading the Quibbler and happily sucking on what looked like a lemon slice. She looked quite beautiful, her long blonde hair tied into a loose fishtail braid, wearing a blue nightdress that appeared to be covered in spiral metal springs.
"A load of dickhead friends, a family you never shut up about, a ton of money, fair marks, a girlfriend, et bloody cetera." Harry listed, slightly bitterly.
"You know what? I think I might," she conceded. "It's just, I know he sees a lot of girls who are much older and prettier and have loads more in common with him. I mean, look at me. I hardly compare to someone like Angelina Johnson, for example."
Draco didn't respond and appeared to be deep in thought for a few minutes. Not sure what he would do if Malfoy were to start crying again in front of him, Harry reached over and took hold of his hand.
"You really don't think it's a prank or something?" Hermione whispered, her voice breaking so slightly that nobody but Harry could have noticed.
He checked his watch, which lay on his bedside table, and groaned. It was 4:30 in the morning. Hermione was probably already in the library, but Harry was not in the mood to study, and Ron wouldn't be conscious for hours.
"Yeah," Harry murmured, giving her hand a quick squeeze. "I think I will too."
"What've you got to be so bloody pleased about, Potter?" An unpleasantly familiar drawl came from the other side of the tower, and Harry realized he must still be grinning like an idiot after seeing Luna.
"Pansy? I have no idea why I'm further entertaining your fantasies, Potter, because as I said, I have not been crying. Regardless, why the hell would you think it was because of Pansy Parkinson?" Draco frowned.
"What's a Snortletuff?" Harry inquired, fascinated.
"It's like a little octopus, they go in your nose when you breathe and then they dance in your brain. Your brain thinks it's you sending it a signal, so it tries to do the dance too, only it's difficult for me to manage an eight-legged dance," Luna explained. "I've only got two, you see," she added, as an afterthought. Harry thought it was more likely that one of her tormentors hit her with a tarantallegra spell, but he cast this unpleasant idea aside, liking her Snortletuffs much better.
"Right, okay. Anyway, Luna, I've been thinking, you know about this dance thing, yeah?" Harry shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot.
"Careful, mate, she's bloody bizarre," Ron crowed.
"Well- I mean, I guess- I guess not, actually. I mean, I don't like when you two are unhappy and if anyone bullied you the way they do her I'd hex them senseless but- no, not like her," Harry admitted.
"Have you ever felt any of that for me? Or Ron?" Hermione nudged.
"What do you mean, what's the matter? Nothing's the matter, Potter. Aside from your incessant babbling, that is."
It was barely morning, with fog rolling over the dimly lit black lake outside Harry's window.
Harry stumbles upon a dishevelled looking Draco, and what ensues could be a bonding moment, or it could be what separates the two forever.
"Oh, hush up." Hermione smiled, suddenly becoming very interested in something on the ground.
It was somewhere between nine o'clock at night and six in the morning, and that was all Harry knew. He didn't know how long he'd been sitting in front of the fire, just staring. He didn't know how many times Luna had popped into his head, and he didn't know why it was such a lot. Regardless, he knew he was in trouble.
, was it?
"Why are you on the floor?" Harry grinned, trying not to laugh at her.
“Bugger off, Potter, or I’ll tell Snape about your little impromptu flying practice. You’d better not say anything about this to anyone or so help me, I will make you wish your filthy mudblood mother had been barren as well as impure,” Malfoy snarled.
"RONALD WEASLEY!" Hermione exclaimed.
His mother and father were not bad people. They just wanted a world where magic ruled, where blood ran pure. That wasn’t
After asking Luna to the ball, Harry talks to Hermione.
her, silly," Hermione giggled. "A blind man could see it, but I suppose you've never been the brightest on that score," she added as an afterthought.
"I dunno, she's your girlfriend, isn't she? What else could you have to be all upset about; you've got everything." Harry said awkwardly, trying not to sound envious.
Luna looked up at him then, smiled broadly, and waved. "Hello, Harry," she mouthed. Harry waved back, and she went back to her magazine, still smiling.
"The Yule Ball, you mean?" She replied absentmindedly, looking at something outside.
"Well, I'd like to very much, but I'm not allowed to go unless I've got a date in fourth year." She smiled at him quizzically. "Had you forgotten I'm only in third year, Harry?"
"Your blood and your esteem mean nothing. Hermione's a much more impressive witch than you are a wizard, and she hasn't got a drop of your stinking pure blood." Harry said, an edge to his voice now.
"Oh, please. I haven't got friends, Crabbe and Goyle are morons, and Zabini and Nott bore me. Money's not worth much when you're in Slytherin and everybody's rich. And no, Pansy isn't my girlfriend." Draco snorted a little at the last phrase, which confused Harry a bit. She was always hanging off him, giggling and flipping her hair about. It was hardly a ridiculous assumption.
“Draco-”
"Hang on," Harry protested. "I do not like Luna Lovegood. I mean, I like her, 'course I do, but just as friends, that's all."
"So? That could all be friend stuff, couldn't it?" Harry objected.
She swung her arms as she walked with him out of the Great Hall, sitting criss-cross as they turned the corner.
"Yeah, alright," Harry laughed, but only halfheartedly.
"Draco," Harry breathed, lowering his wand and sinking to his knees next to Malfoy.
"Yes, actually. Which is odd because we're only going as mates and I have no idea what's happening to me," Harry murmured. Hermione began to laugh, much to Harry's disdain.
“Did I hurt you?” Harry asked, bewildered.
The Dark Lord was meant to win, that was good. Right? Because if the Dark Lord should not have won, that meant that Draco’s parents should not have won. That would mean that his parents were
"Luna. Right?" Hermione grinned at him cheekily.
thought Draco.
The next day, Harry awoke feeling completely unrested.
“And who’s that?”
"So you're telling me, the bloke who defeated bloody You Know Who three times and is currently a Triwizard Champion can't get a date to a school dance, and neither can his two best mates?" Ron complained, poking at his nearly solid egg yolk.
"Alright, bloody hell, Malfoy, then. What's the matter with you?" Harry asked, standing back up to match him.
"Piss off, Malfoy. What are you doing here, anyway?" Harry retorted.
"You've got streaks all down your face, Draco. Is it Parkinson? Perhaps I could ask Hermione if-"
"Oh, whatever, fine. What's with you then, why are you down here so late?" Harry grumbled, thinking that just
"I dunno. I never used to get nervous talking to her like I did today. She seemed unhappy for a moment and I couldn't stand it. And the thought of people being as horrible to her as I know they are sometimes- Merlin, but I've never been so angry." Harry looked up at Hermione, who was beaming. "Oh,
The Dark Lord’s followers were laughing. His own parents, his aunt, his entire family were
"Hi. Brilliant, yeah. Er, can I have a word?" Harry noticed his breath catching a little in his throat. This was new. New with Luna, anyway.
"Right, well that's- that's fair, I suppose," he stammered, unsure of why he was so nervous. The worst she could say was no, right? He was only asking her because he needed a date. They'd go as friends, that was all.
"Alright, yeah. Who're you going to ask, then?" Ron asked, scanning the room.
"Besides, you're beautiful. He'd be lucky to have you, 'mione."
"Not terribly appealing when you put it like that, is it? But the squid's a lovely, gentle thing. I suppose more people would think so if they tried to know him," she looked down at the ground for a second, her smile fading ever so slightly. Hating the sight of Luna upset, Harry brushed a lock of her long, blonde hair behind her ear. At this, she looked back up at him, the smile returning to her lips. He leaned forward a little, then gave a start and straightened up.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright, whatever. Harry, I'll ask mine if you ask yours."
"What? What are you calling me that for?" Draco spat, springing to his feet.
"You've been crying, your eyes are all red. What is it?" Harry asked, trying to be gentle.
"Lumos," he incanted. In fact, Malfoy wasn't unarmed, but that was the least of Harry's surprises. Malfoy was sitting against the wall holding his wand up to Harry with one arm and holding his knees to his chest with the other, and his usually slicked back hair was tangled in complete disorder, not much tidier than Harry's. He looked tiny, almost childlike. His green pajamas were slightly torn at his sleeve, and he was only wearing socks on his feet, but what took Harry by surprise was his face. The rims of his eyes were tinged pink, and his cheeks appeared to be streaked with tears.
