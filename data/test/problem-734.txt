They’re... pleasant, he supposes—excepting the peppermint one—but he quickly tires of the flavors and doesn’t finish any of them. He can’t help but marvel over how Soto just carries that many around.
understand were his feelings for Potter.
Harry raises his eyebrows amusedly. So
Harry finally remembers he’s a wizard, reaching into his pocket and silently casting an airway clearing spell on himself, as Neville matches Rosmerta’s grin.
“What’s this about no mistletoe? Tsk, where’s your holiday spirit, Harry?” a light voice floats over to their booth, and Harry freezes, eyes going wide. Neville hides his smirk with his hand, and Rosmerta gives Harry a pointed look, as if to say that it’s not too late for the mistletoe.
Harry laughs, heart bursting with warmth and joy and
Once, they have to stop when Draco pins Harry to the wall in a dark passage.
He collects the mugs before he makes his way towards the front of the ward. The sun is warm on his back as he walks past the other beds, the bathroom, and then Healer Wagner’s office near the entrance of the ward. He avoids the old, circular rug on the floor with his nose wrinkled in distaste—it smells of dust and sickness.
(See the end of the chapter for
But something else bothers him about the letter. It’s like he
“I thought you might be out here,” Draco says softly. Harry’s heart leaps.
Draco sucks in a sharp breath. The drawings of Potter flash in his mind’s eye—drawn with such care and softness. Of everything in the journal, the one thing he
“Look,” Potter starts, voice rising over Soto’s, “I understand that you’ve run Janus-Thickey for a long time. But like I already said: you’re being demoted, and unless you want your healing license suspended, you’ll have to accept this.”
He’s been telling himself that it’s impossible to find something for Draco, simply because he never wants anything. He has Isabelle, he has every potion supply under the sun, and he has his impressive collection of tea leaves. But Harry can admit that he was wrong — that’s not why it’s so difficult to figure this out.
this had to happen today, right when he needs to be able to think about things properly. He promises himself that as soon as he wakes from his nap, he’ll think over everything.
, she seems to say.
Draco stares at the staircase for a long time after Potter disappears, waiting for his eyes to stop burning before he slips back into the ward.
is that Auror.
Draco probably used to know the place they took the picture. It was definitely taken at Hogwarts, after all, and he grimaces as he thinks of it. He knows how much he’s lost, but he wonders how he can actually
“Well, what do you say back?”
“You can rely on me, Draco. If there’s anything you need, anything at all…” she trails off, eyes imploring. Draco smiles, suddenly thinking of Agnes.
Feeling like he’s done something wrong without knowing what it is or what he should say, he hesitates.
“What? We were supposed to be at the Burrow an hour ago!” Harry says, turning on his heels and throwing open his closet to find something decent to wear. He starts rummaging around, before Draco’s hand on his wrist stops him, and he swallows thickly.
Twenty minutes to midnight.
Harry rolls out of bed, Isabelle drags a string into his room, and he dresses in his usual black robes — the morning so far is predictable.
They enter Draco’s potions lab a few moments later. Harry purses his lips at the smell. Skele-Gro is
Draco smiles gratefully. “I would appreciate that. Thank you.”
And it doesn’t help that Draco is so
Agnes barks, getting Draco’s attention again and pulling him away from darkening thoughts. She points to herself, then to him, before clasping her hands in front of her and moving them down her stomach. Puzzled, Draco tilts his head at her and smiles apologetically.
“Come in,” he calls. He’s sure the frustration is evident in his voice.
“Yes, I think so. What kind of information will it tell you?” he asks.
A parcel arrives for Draco later that morning, given to him by Soto along with a tray of food. The package is wrapped in heavy, matte green paper, tied with a black ribbon, a note tucked neatly beneath the bow. Draco runs his hands over the paper, the slightly rough texture almost nostalgic, in a way.
. Cassandra abruptly turns away and wraps her arms around herself as she leaves his cubicle.
“You’re joking,” he whispers, eyes flicking over to the partially-open curtains nervously before he shuts them, even though he knows it won’t do much.
He changes into something a little less comfortable, something Hermione picked out for him years ago and doesn’t quite fit anymore, and goes to meet Neville and Draco by the Great Hall as they do every year.
Anaise hoots from her perch when he approaches her. She wearily eyes the storm outside. Draco isn’t keen on sending her out in this weather, either, but she’ll fare. She’s a strong flier—more so than any owl Draco’s known.
He turns away from the cafeteria to inspect the lone door, hoping that none of the healers will see him—or at least think much of it.
He sucks in a slow breath. In, out. Because, somehow, Bryn
“That I’d never hurt you,” Draco mutters. Harry swallows past the lump in his throat. His heart races.
Draco isn’t sure how that makes him feel, so he thanks Agnes for bringing tea and promises he’ll talk to her later, and she makes her leave with the tray.
He drinks a small glass of water, attempts to flatten his hair again, and slides his feet into his slippers before he leaves.
Draco voices his agreement, and then Bryn walks with him back to the ward. They say goodbye and wish each other well—Draco going to his cubicle and Bryn to Potter’s office—and Draco finds himself watching the red glow of the sunset from the ward’s only window.
Because Draco stayed. He moved to the sofa, and he
And it’s that quiet loneliness that makes him pause with his hand on the doorframe before he leaves for breakfast, looking back at his quarters. He looks at the battered sofa by the fire, the mahogany desk on the far end of the room right beside the door to his bedroom, shelves lining the wall next to it, the rickety little table where two people could share breakfast if they wanted to.
about what’s happening to people he doesn’t know, anyways.
“You go shower, and I’ll find you something to wear. You’ll pick something atrocious otherwise,” Draco says, and Harry almost wants to argue, but he knows Draco is right. Hermione makes a comment every year about how Harry still can’t be trusted to dress himself.
, if it wasn’t for the fact that they were arguing not five minutes ago, and Draco doesn’t understand what could possibly have turned Potter’s mood away from hostile.
Agnes stares at him unblinkingly for a moment. He shifts uneasily.
“Draco,” he finally says, like he’s trying it out, and Draco looks up sharply. “I can do that. Draco.”
And if Draco is honest, he feels more like himself than ever when he’s around Potter. The realization leaves his cheeks hot, and he’s thankful that it’s nearly impossible to see given how dark it is.
he thinks.
Soto’s desk doesn’t have much on it apart from the mugs that Draco placed on it. There’s a framed photo of her and a similar-looking witch—Draco would guess she’s Soto’s sister—laughing as students. Soto’s tie is yellow and black, her sister’s green and silver, their school robes shifting in the wind. Red and orange leaves fall all around them, and Draco feels a stab in his chest when he sees how care-free Soto looks.
“You’re such a git,” he sighs.
“A separate examination room. It’s more private,” he explains, and Draco hums. He’s grateful for any semblance of privacy, even if it’s with a stranger.
Harry sighs heavily, pitying himself for just a moment. He wishes he had tea.
“My healer gave it to me,” Draco repeats, furrowing his eyebrows. “It makes my nausea go away.”
The tight ball of anxiety relaxes a bit more from that. It seems like he could actually
“Whose memories are they?” he asks, and Bryn tries in vain to hide their small smile.
“Malfoy,” someone says behind him, and he spins around. Standing behind him is a man in lime green robes, round glasses and deep shadows under green eyes, wearing a sneer. “You’re Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
And Harry has never loved Draco more.
sound from across the room draws his attention. With a sigh, he sits up and puts his glasses on.
. What a wonderful thing.
But Draco shakes the thought away. He doesn’t need to explain to himself, of all people, the difference between looking at
Well, he supposes, that’s as good a place as any to start.
mess it up.
“If you’d like and are comfortable to, we can continue the meeting as planned. It may not spark any memories like we thought, but it can still be useful,” they say, an encouraging note in their voice.
He drops the vial into Potter’s hand, hoping that none of his thoughts show on his face, but Potter isn’t even looking at him. His focus is on the vial, sniffing it and swirling it around, watching how the remaining potion clings to the sides of the glass.
As Harry nears and stops next to Draco, he shifts his stance to match Harry’s, and the action makes his heart flutter a bit. He has to resist invading Draco’s personal space to see the expression on his face.
He cracks an eyelid open, squinting up at a dark-haired witch in lime green robes through bleary eyes. She’s muttering spells under her breath, a clipboard and quill floating beside her, her wand moving in steady motions.
He eats a quick breakfast in the Great Hall with Neville and Draco, before they set off for Hogsmeade through the snow.
much cheese — and Harry thinks of Firenze as he eats. He’d appreciate the selection the twins have provided.
His reflection holds him in place for a moment—shockingly white-blond hair, flushed skin, wide grey eyes—and he tears his gaze away, clutching his robes to his chest. Heat rises on his neck, in his eyes.
He goes over everything he knows in his head: his name is Draco Malfoy, he is twenty-nine years old, he used to work for the Aurors at the Ministry of Magic, his parents’ names are Lucius and Narcissa, he was hit by a strong curse that took away his memories, and now he stays in the Janus-Thickey Ward. Miraculously, he still remembers magic and broader concepts like reading and writing, even places like the Ministry and Hogwarts.
Floo travel goes as it always does for him — poorly — and he steps out of the grate to a very hectic scene.
Harry lands in the alley beside The Three Broomsticks, arms still around Draco. He curses at the unexpected snow, the world spinning a little. Draco’s eyes
being brewed in here.
Once he steps out of the shower, he dries himself off, ruffles his hair with a towel. He carefully hangs the towel on one of the hooks on the wall, turns to grab his robes from the sink, and his eyes are pulled to the movement in the mirror.
It’s clear how difficult it is for Potter to remain professional—and even if Draco isn’t really helping, Potter has surely had unfriendly patients before. And besides,
The mandrakes are dealt with by ten. They drink tea over conversation and soft laughter. Then, they cast warming charms and step out of the humid greenhouse.
. He wants to reach out and open the doors, step inside and sink back in bed, but not really. Because no, no, this is all wrong, what’s he doing?
He slides between the bed sheets, which are still as stiff as ever. Despite that, his eyes immediately fall closed of their own accord, and he drifts into sleep.
, and he lets out a small sigh. So he went the right way, then. But now that he’s here, he has no idea how he’s going to get inside if the wards only accept the head healers.
“I would at least be seen to assess the damage. Any trauma to your core could cause problems down the line, if and when you use magic again. I know how crushing it can be if you learn that it’s unlikely you’ll regain your memories, but you don’t have to seek treatment even if you know there is a chance. It’s your choice, love. Not mine,” Soto says, voice calm, soothing Draco’s inner turmoil.
The underlying sterile scent of the hospital sharpens until it’s all he can smell. It burrows into his head, his pulse throbbing in his temple, and his legs start to shake with the effort of standing.
Because Potter will remain in the ward overnight, for whatever reason, Draco opts to keep the letter to himself until after he's met with the memory specialist. He has time, and doesn't really want to seek Potter out so soon after the awkward way he left earlier.
“Yes, it is,” he murmurs. “I can feel how wrong you are through your fingertips.”
She looks at him like she’s worried he’s come down with something, and Draco huffs a laugh.
His curiosity peaks when he sees the next page (“Patient Notes”), but he doesn’t keep reading Agnes’s file. He’s already seen everything he needs to know, and learning more would only intrude on her privacy. It’s difficult to push aside his desire to know more about her, but he closes the folder and slides it back into place.
“No hello?” Draco asks as they start walking to the faculty room. Harry raises his eyebrows and finally looks at Draco, heart stuttering as he does.
Agnes scribbles. He reads the note and laughs far too loudly to be appropriate in a ward full of sick patients.
Basil doesn’t seem to be very receptive, still refusing to look at Draco, and he shifts uncomfortably under Gilderoy’s openly expectant look.
He glances at the clock again. Parson will be here any minute now. He wipes sweaty palms on his robes, trying not to think about what would happen if Parson discovered him in Soto’s office. It doesn’t take twenty minutes to put mugs on a desk.
“Sorry?” he asks. Agnus waves a dismissive hand and barks a few times, waving him off. A warm, fuzzy feeling in his chest, he obediently returns to his bed when Agnes barks at him to leave.
Regardless, he wills himself to relax. He doubts Potter would hurt him—here, at least, and as his healer. Even Potter couldn’t get away with that.
Bryn quickly walks him through what viewing the memory will be like and what he’ll have to do to view them. Draco shifts uneasily at the thought of pressing his face into the liquid for a prolonged period of time.
“Answer me honestly, Draco. Is your mission, or the possibility of regaining your memories more important to you?” she asks, a grim set to her shoulders.
“You’re welcome,” Harry whispers. It’s only then that Harry realises how close they are to the mistletoe. He swallows thickly, excusing himself from the party, and ignores Draco’s questioning looks.
It’s a waiting room in St. Mungo’s, and something terrible has happened. From every direction comes yelling and wails of pain, shouts of the healers for Dittany, murtlap, and sedatives. Aurors in various states of dress are appearing with loud
Potter scowls, but continues, “It was a cure for common poisons. Healer Soto took the wrong potion, and it was Cassandra’s job to identify those kinds of errors, but she gave it to you without realizing. All of you were lucky that there weren’t any adverse effects to taking a cure you didn’t need.”
does Draco always do this?
His chest fills with slow, steady warmth. It’s an easy, straight-forward feeling, something that he could fall into if he let himself.
He turns his attention to his breakfast when Neville starts commenting about how big the sausages are today, which he would almost think was supposed to be a joke, if it hadn’t come from
that his name appears in (MALFOY OUT OF AZKABAN, REDEEMED OR RUINED?) It’s from 2002. It’s not a headline piece, and the small photo of him included beneath the article is very unflattering, but it’s information nonetheless.
. I’m not a liar.”
Oddly, the twins take to Draco very quickly, the three of them talking in low voices all throughout lunch. Harry watches them fondly.
“Well, all your vitals are normal. There haven’t been any changes in your magical core or your brain. I can’t be sure there isn’t any major trauma to them—unless you see a specialist,” Soto says a bit absently, jotting something down on her clipboard with that distracted air she always adopts after checkups.
Draco opens his mouth. Closes it when he realizes he doesn’t know what to say. Instead, he nods, and Potter nods along with him, and it’s all so painfully awkward.
Neville gives him a gentle smile before going to open his own gift, which has stopped squirming as much. Draco and Harry watch in gross fascination as Neville peels back the paper. It turns out to be a Mimbulus Mimbletonia sapling, and Neville’s face lights up with joy, while both Draco and Harry take a good few steps back. They’re all too aware of how explosive and disgustingly sticky the plant can be.
Draco pauses. Emotionally—well, there’s a lot to unpack there, and the past few days of isolating himself have only worsened it. He’s not really keen on talking about it, but if he doesn’t say anything now, will he ever? He can’t imagine saying any of it to Agnes, Narcissa, or—Merlin forbid—Potter.
Draco nods and smiles slightly, liking them already, and Bryn continues: “Great. Healer Potter, if you will, I think Draco would prefer to do this one-on-one….”
Harry finds, idly, that he doesn’t want to pretend.
He retreats back to bed with a frown, picking up his sign language book once again, but it’s pointless. He can’t focus, and after a few minutes, he can hear a set of heavy footsteps nearing his cubicle. He doesn’t recognize them, so it’s either the new patient, or Merlin forbid,
by Emily Dickinson
That’s the biggest thing that irks Draco—how casually Potter uses wandless magic around him, knowing that he can’t perform any spells himself. Frustration curls in his stomach.
“I’d forget too,” Hermione starts, “if I was lonely and pining and wasting all my chances to correct that.”
look a little flaky.
With a sigh, he removes his breakfast tray from his bed and places it in the armchair, slipping under the blankets and just listening to the rain. Rhythmic, soft pattering.
Neville laughs, but he goes a little pale and takes an eager sip of his drink. The Ravenclaw head of house takes Secret Santa very seriously. They learned that the hard way, their first year as professors, and Harry doesn’t think his left ear has been the same since.
mistletoe!”
Their fingers brush, and Harry’s skin burns from it. The touch is gentle but undeniably there, and it almost makes Harry shiver before he gets control of himself. He puts his glasses on and blinks as Draco comes into focus. He’s surprised to see that Draco’s cheeks and ears are flushed.
“Oh, fine. I came to ask if you’re busy tomorrow,” Draco answers. “Longbottom and I are heading to Hogsmeade.”
When the sun has gone down completely, he sits in bed and stares at his curtains, lost in thought. Tonight, oddly, none of the lights are turned on, so Draco sits in the darkness for a while and mourns—not for the first time—the loss of his memories.
eat—and tries to come up with more things to say than an apology for never introducing himself.
Anaise hoots softly. She seems worried.
He can feel Potter’s eyes lingering heavily on him, sending a flush across his skin, but he doesn’t look up. He holds his breath, and a moment later, Potter leaves the cubicle without a word—leaving Draco to wonder if they’re almost
As they near the kitchen, the yelling and playful shouts get quieter, replaced by soft, calm voices and the smell of a Christmas lunch.
He waves a dismissive hand. “I’ll tell you later, but not right now. The point is, you’re a medium-risk patient. You can leave the ward, but your monitoring charms are still up. But with how long you’ve been here, have you ever
On a whim, he goes left. His slippers make small shuffling sounds as he walks.
Beyond the doors is what seems to be a cafeteria—the scent of sausage and bacon reaches him even from down the corridor—and Draco wonders if this is where the food for the ward comes from. There are dozens of people already milling about, trays of food in hand. Most of them are wearing lime green robes, slumping a bit in exhaustion, and Draco assumes they just got off their shifts, or are about to start them.
After the treacle tart comes a decent amount of water and cheese — probably
He stands and collects their cups as quietly as possible — Draco’s has pink lipstick rings on it, and Harry inexplicably wants to keep them — and builds the fire again. He throws a blanket over Draco’s shoulders, one Molly knitted, knowing Draco would hate it.
But mostly, his irritability is because Soto never came to visit after she was demoted, not even to say goodbye or apologize for accidentally giving him the wrong potion. She doesn’t go to see Gilderoy, either, for all the years she was his healer.
“Are you in the greenhouse today, Nev? I could join you if you need a hand,” Harry asks a few minutes later as the students begin to clear the table.
He steps up to the basin on Bryn’s count, leaning over and slowly pressing his face into the pensieve when Bryn reaches three. He instinctively squeezes his eyes shut and holds his breath, even though he knows he doesn’t need to.
He wants his memories back—but at the same time, he doesn’t. He doesn’t want to remember everything, just to be relieved when he realizes how much he really needed his memories all along. He doesn’t want to know about Azkaban or living with Voldemort or horror stories from the Aurors. He doesn’t know if he can be a person without those experiences, but he’s terrified of reliving them. What if he can’t even get his memories back?
Harry splutters, not sure how he should even
“Was that even a diagnostic charm?” Draco grumbles, smoothing his robes and still refusing to actually look at Potter.
“What do you mean?” Draco asks wearily. Agnes tenses, and he can practically feel her irritation grow, rolling off of her as she writes. He doesn’t understand what he’s doing so wrong.
“Yes. You’re right.”
But he can’t stay focused on any of it. In his mind, the words
All of this is real.
“Did you know that you can just walk out of the ward?” he finally says. It’s difficult to tell, but Draco gets the impression that Agnes is raising her eyebrows.
If he wanted to, he could just ignore the message. He could pretend he lost his memories of the “mission” too, and no one could question him. He’s not even entirely sure that he
,” he points out quickly. Draco winces—that’s a low blow—and hopes Potter didn’t notice.
“If that’s the case, maybe I should get the mistletoe going, eh?” Harry chokes on his drink and coughs, and Neville absently pats his back as Rosmerta continues. “I got some of the enchanted sprigs from the Weasley place, the ones that hold both parties in place until they do the deed. I was gonna save it for the Christmas party, but I’m thinking it’d look great hangin’ right above this booth. Whaddya say?” Rosmerta muses, eyes on the beam above Harry’s head, nodding and spreading her hands wide like she’s imagining something grand.
Because it’s Harry Potter.
As they weave through the steadily growing crowd of people, Draco grabs hold of Harry’s elbow to stay with him, and Harry’s skin heats at the contact. Draco’s fingers are warm, his grip light, but Harry is aware of it the entire time he’s holding onto his elbow.
He walks back to his bed, feeling happier than he has since he woke up in St. Mungo’s, though he doesn’t recall
The corners of his vision darken, the world starting to spin, and then everything is black.
Below them, Diagon Alley fills with even more people, shouting and laughing, the sound carrying up to them. At some point, they begin to count down —
.oOoOo.
“Possibly, depending on the spell and kind of trauma to your core,” she says gently. Draco understands what she’s not saying: the chances of regaining his memories are slim.
“You can call me Bryn,” Cassidy,
It’s rose gold in colour, which is fitting of the shop, and Harry thinks of Draco’s words as he looks at it. He traces the plaque that reads
The letter appropriately pulls his attention to other things. It reads:
He steps into the storeroom, pulling the door shut with a click behind him. About twice the size of his cubicle, it’s larger than he expected it to be. There are multiple floor-to-ceiling shelves, the space between them very narrow, racks on the shelves holding hundreds of potions—maybe even a thousand.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees softly, pointedly avoiding meeting Draco’s eyes.
Harry thinks of Draco.
He slips out of his cubicle to the side of Rue’s, peering around her curtains to watch Potter and Soto at the front of the ward. Soto has her back to him, hands on her hips, and Potter is directly across from her. He’s nearly a head taller than she is, and Draco ducks back around the curtains when it occurs to him that Potter could probably see him.
He debates leaving the bathroom and simply going back to his cubicle, knowing he’d be able to if he wants. But suddenly, he feels wretched
up to, since he and Blaise got married and the two of them started
“Thirsty. And confused,” he adds, tearing his eyes away from the space the clipboard had been. He licks his cracked lips. “Where am I?”
“That wasn’t an anti-nausea potion,” Potter says. Draco simply stares at him for a few seconds, at a loss. Potter is
Agnes looks concerned for all of a second before she scribbles a response, hand shaking now. From anger or worry, he doesn’t know.
In the faculty room, the large table and chairs have been turned into sofas and coffee tables, pushed to the sides of the room. A large fire is going, snow falls from the ceiling, a Christmas tree in the corner to put the presents under. Enchanted, wooden mice chase each other through the air.
“You find him before midnight, though, and I’m sure you won’t be anymore,” she adds. Harry’s skin heats.
Draco’s mind wanders to Potter’s memories. They replay over and over in his head. The only thing he can even think is that, at least at one point, he fought against Voldemort, and likely his father as well.
. Harry’s heart pounds at their proximity and that look.
.oOoOo.
joke,” he replies, but the small chuckle that slips past him takes away the bite in his words. “I’ll have you know that I’m perfectly capable of remembering things.”
It’s stopped snowing by the time lunch rolls around, but it’s no less cold in the castle. Harry leaves the heat of the fire in his office with a mournful look and walks down to the Great Hall for lunch. He shivers, casting warming charms as he goes.
He leaves his empty tray on his bedside table once he's finished eating, sliding his feet into his slippers and making his way to her cubicle. He mentally goes over how to sign hello, and though he's done it so much that he can do it perfectly, there's a nagging thought that he
He thinks, and he misses, and he loves Draco.
If nothing else, Potter at least seems to be a competent healer, and has shown that he knows what he’s

how he got here, does he?
Probably.
“Yeah,” he says weakly. Both he and Neville know that he won’t stop Draco under the mistletoe.
Draco’s soft expression makes Harry’s heart thrum. He finds it difficult to look away from Draco’s eyes — beautiful, and full of meanings that Harry doesn’t understand.
“I didn’t expect to see you here, Rosmerta. The pub closed?” Harry asks. He expected Rosmerta to keep it open as usual. Rosmerta winks as she pours something in Harry’s glass. He shrugs. He may as well take it.
Draco breathes a laugh and holds the jar out to Harry, and he takes a pinch of the powder before stepping into the fireplace.
And something unexpected happens. 👀 Sorry to keep you waiting on the mystery of the potion. But don't worry, you'll learn all about it next chapter - along with some
But, on the other hand, it’s exactly as he wrote in the journal: everything seems to go back to Potter. The only history Draco knows anything about is with Potter—and
Harry waits just inside the store for Draco, Neville, and Blaise to show up, wanting to avoid the snow beginning to fall outside. Neville and Blaise appear first, holding hands, and Harry tries not to feel jealous of how openly affectionate they are.
mood than he was before.
is the one he’s seen,
Feeling a bit off-kilter and disturbed, he ignores Agnes’s barking and returns to his bed, pulling the curtains closed behind him.
However, Agnes is still eating her breakfast, taking special care to cut her food in small pieces that must be easier for her to chew. Draco didn’t think he would be startled to see her, already knowing what she looks like, but his steps momentarily falter when he takes in her appearance. Her face and arms are covered in black fur, and though she otherwise looks like a normal human, she can’t speak in anything other than barks.
Draco swallows roughly. He knew, of course, that he couldn’t have walked away unscathed, but to hear it said as
“No. Not to the brain specialist,” Narcissa replies vaguely. “Do you remember the letter you sent me a few hours before you were attacked?”
Narcissa stares at him expectantly, apparently not forgetting their earlier conversation and still expecting an answer. He sobers, the last of his good mood slipping away.
he was going to lose his memories, or at the very least, knew that something was going to happen.
“Hi.” Harry’s suddenly nervous. Draco turns, smiling when he sees Harry.
“My healer gave it to me. It helps with my nausea,” he replies. It’s not even a lie, either.
He stands on shaky legs, stumbling over to the sink. He swishes a bit of water around his mouth before spitting it out and washing his face. Feeling a little more steady, he walks back to his bed, trying not to move his head around too much.
Thankfully, it doesn’t squeak, and he shuts it with a soft click behind him.
He’s not sure that he’s going to find anything useful, considering he doesn’t quite know what to make of the letter Narcissa gave him, but he has two lists now. It wouldn’t hurt to compare them.
Harry bends and picks the “gift” up, knees cracking as he does, and he groans. The bag is soft and lumpy in his hands, and he can guess by the feeling that it’s full of vials. He pulls open the string and looks inside, and sure enough, it’s just a few empty glass vials.
Draco is seated on the other side of Neville. Harry’s eyes wander to him the entire time they eat, and to Isabelle, sleeping in his lap. Draco’s long, pale fingers curl under her chin.
Draco’s flush deepens. “Not at all.”
So Harry watches Draco.
Agnes gives him a remorseful look and scratches a response down.
Suddenly wishing that he had tea and biscuits to offer her, Draco nervously smooths over the front of his robes before he sits in his bed, a few feet away from where Narcissa sits in the armchair. She’s staring at him like he’s a ghost.
leaving him scowling and rubbing his ribs.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I can imagine how that must have felt. To know so little of the person you once were, and to only get to see something from a time in your life when you were likely just as confused as you are now,” Bryn says softly, and Draco finally meets their eye, folding his hands in his lap. He doesn’t reply.
Draco’s heart leaps, but falls as Bryn continues: “It’s not going to undo the memory loss, but it does provide information about it, like reading the history of your memory. Does that make sense?”
The rest of the students’ eyes are red-rimmed, expressions grim and tear-streaked and hopeless. Draco doesn’t see himself among them.
It’s different from Pepperup Potions, but not so different that Harry can’t grasp it after watching Draco do it. It requires some concentration and an incantation, and the lab quickly grows hot from the fires and slight magical exertion — and a fair amount of it might also be from being so close to Draco.
Not that Draco’s complaining, because this benefits him nicely, but part of him can’t help but note incompetencies.
(See the end of the chapter for
He thinks of Draco, and the mahogany cabinet in his office, filled with tins and jars of tea leaves. How the four shelves are completely full, organised alphabetically, the labels written in Draco’s neat script. Harry will never understand what Draco intends to do with so much tea, but Draco delights in having it — as does Neville, who goes to Draco’s office almost as much as Harry does — so Harry will always just accept a cup of whatever they’re drinking.
“Hello!” he chirps. “Basil, meet Draco. Draco, meet Basil.”

to say romantic things — this wouldn’t be a problem. He would just march right up to Draco and say everything on his mind, possibly be even bolder and pull Draco in for a kiss.
anything about my pajamas,” he says, and Draco blushes at the reminder.
He watches her go. Almost immediately, she disappears in the darkness of the night. Another flick of his wrist, and the window is shut and the water is gone.
“How did you get in there?” Potter asks, eyes narrowed, and the tone of his voice makes Draco stiffen.
Sweat beads on Draco’s forehead and above his lip, his face flushed rather unpleasantly, and Harry swallows past the lump in his throat, willing himself to focus on the task at hand.
“What is
Because Draco —
He gives a tight nod. “Potter.”
Neville sighs audibly beside him, patting his back as he walks by.
Memory-Draco asks for Potter’s surname, and Potter doesn’t get to reply before the world dissolves around them, fading into grey haze.
This place isn’t meant to be lived in alone. Every corner of it invites company — for a shared bottle of whisky by the fire, or reading an excerpt from the morning paper out loud at the table, or filling the shelves above the desk with framed photos and potions supplies and books and Sneakoscopes.
He waits a few seconds after Soto has left the ward to walk into her office, glancing at the beds down the ward and confirming that all of the curtains are closed. Then he looks over his shoulder at Rue. She usually stares at him anytime he’s near, but now she turns her gaze to her knees, picking at invisible lint as if to say, “I don’t see anything.”
His slippers are dirty.
“I do, actually. I’ll send them to you when I return to the Manor,” she says. And with that, she stands abruptly, setting her empty mug on the bedside table.
Draco watches in fascination as thin threads of pulsing light emerge from the tip of the wand, red and yellow and blue. They dance around the examination room, darting around each other like animals might play, steadily tangling themselves with each other until they’re a single, knotted line. He understands fully now why they’re in a room separate from the ward.
Potter waves his wand in a swooping pattern, muttering under his breath. Draco expects the sensation of the diagnostic charm to be uncomfortable, because it’s
Draco’s eyebrows shoot up, but he’s less surprised than he probably should be.
And across from them, standing in the center of a long line of darkly dressed wixes, is a tall, pale wizard, eyes glowing red and thin lips stretched into a terrifying smile.
Harry winces — of course she heard — and goes to stand beside her, staring at the self-filling, hopefully unbreakable glass tumblers, at a loss. Where are the labels?
supposed to mean?” he asks, voice deathly soft.
Narcissa sent an owl to him earlier that morning, letting him know she would visit him around noon, and he’s grateful she did. Apparently, he can nervously clean for hours.
) is a clipboard. Draco’s pulse quickens as he skims over it. There’s a list full of names signing off on potions, and he assumes that the head healers have to record whatever they take from the room. He spots Healer Soto’s name near the top.
Before he can say anything, the curtains are being pushed aside—making Draco jump—but it’s just Agnes shuffling into the cubicle. She’s carrying a tray with two mismatched mugs, strings of tea bags hanging over the sides, eyes alight with excitement. She glances between Draco and Narcissa, something like a grin spreading across her face, and sets the tray down on Draco’s bedside table.
He sucks in a ragged breath and tugs up the sleeve of his robe with shaking hands.
He spears one on his fork and sniffs it — they
He decides that today, he’ll sign hello to Agnes and introduce himself to the new patient. There’s nothing better to do while waiting for Narcissa’s reply, first of all—and secondly, it would distract him from the odd sense of unease in his chest. As if something bad is about to happen.
She punctuates the sentence with a pointed finger and promptly walks away, leaving Harry to gape at her back.
“You have a letter,” Potter says, producing a folded piece of parchment from his pocket, holding it out to Draco so the wax seal is visible. A perfect circle, unbroken, and obviously from Narcissa.
He reminds himself that Potter is alive and well, that this is just a memory.
Gilderoy catches onto the tense atmosphere and stands slowly, gently taking Basil’s hand.
. Nothing good could be in them, not involving Draco.
Blaise gives Harry a once-over without saying hello — maybe it’s a Slytherin thing? — squinting and looking like he can somehow read Harry’s every thought. Harry shifts uncomfortably.
He’s stopped looking at them, now. He doesn’t want to see them if he can’t have answers, and he’s too afraid to ask any questions.
Harry hums in understanding and finishes off his breakfast. He thinks he knows what Neville is up to — what he’s
“Oh, I’m sure.” Potter’s tone could practically be
They’re standing in a courtyard, a castle towering over them and the sun just beginning to rise. Rubble and debris are scattered across the space. Dust is falling. A ring of school-aged teens stand in a half-circle, bloodied and covered in dirt and sweat. A redheaded girl is sobbing, but the sound can’t be heard. Everything is muffled.
“Hello,” Draco greets cordially. The new patient turns his gaze away, not responding, and Gilderoy, who is sitting beside him, pipes up.
“I hope you feel better,” she squeaks over her shoulder, voice suddenly shrill.
Unfortunately for Harry, though, that means Rosmerta figured out Harry’s feelings for Draco long before Harry himself did. He isn’t sure if she wants to do something for Draco, or has something against Harry, but she always has a comment or a wink up her sleeve anytime they’re together.
Draco gives a nod—feeling like he’s been doing a lot of nodding today—and Bryn clears their throat as they shift a bit on the stool to get more comfortable.
Draco rolls his eyes. Not
“Look—I’m sure you overheard, but Soto isn’t the head healer here anymore, which means she’s no longer
Draco turns to Soto’s desk, feeling guilty, knowing how many personal boundaries he’s crossing with her to be doing this. He tells himself that if Soto knew what was happening, she’d probably
“Right,” the boy says, and Draco’s stomach flips when his lip curls and he spits, “And I’ll join you when Hell freezes over.”
Draco purses his lips. Bites his tongue. He doesn’t like the idea, but at least it makes
Either way, he’s already here, and he
“Good morning,” she says, once she realizes he’s awake, seeming distracted by whatever the self-writing quill is scratching on the clipboard. Her eyes are tired and a little far away, but her smile-lines are deep, and he feels like he can trust her. She reminds him of… someone he can’t place, but he relaxes at the sight of her.
The new patient goes silent, and Draco feels a twinge of pity for them.
Draco practically
The lights start to pulse stronger and more frequently as Bryn’s muttering grows more confident. Draco has to cover his eyes as the blue light glows even brighter, until Bryn abruptly swipes their wand as if slicing the air—maybe cutting through the thread—and the line snaps into four, the pieces slowly turning a deep, dreadful black.
He just doesn’t know what will make Draco’s chest burst with warmth the same way Harry’s does just
Draco glares at him, even though he can’t see it. “You
Potter pushes past the curtains, lunch tray floating beside him, and silently directs the tray to Draco’s bedside table with a flick of his wrist.
, a Draco who knew what a veela is and what a mermaid looks like, with a million experiences that made him who he was and a thousand hours to process them.
It’s been a while since Harry’s been to the store. It seems to grow every time he sees it, and he’s proud of the twins for getting so far.
“Hullo, Hogwarts too?” memory-Draco asks. Potter startles, and turns his attention to memory-Draco.
While the real Potter certainly is all of those things (with an added disregard for personal space and a penchant to assume he’s right), it’s not at all flattering. Really, the only pleasant thing Draco can think about him is that he’s attractive—and yeah, he smells nice and seems concerned about Draco’s wellbeing—but that’s irrelevant.
“I want my memories back, but I have an obligation here first. My memories can wait,” he says.
Inspired by
And in some ways, it doesn’t seem right. Potter’s an arse, and it’s clear to him that their “school rivalry” was worse than just some petty fights. Draco was horrible to him. It explains Potter’s immediate reaction to seeing Draco in St. Mungo’s, at least.
They walk slowly back to Harry’s quarters, talking about nothing at all, voices soft and echoey in the empty halls. Soft sunlight streams through the windows, glinting in Draco’s hair and making it look white. Harry loses his train of thought mid-speech when he notices how bright Draco’s eyes look in this lighting.
Soto’s eyes soften, and she tilts her head as she regards him, and he knows he didn’t do a good job of hiding anything.
They’re silent for some time, content with not speaking, their fingers interlocked and moving to grip the railing between them. Their hands say everything they need to.
“Harry, since you’re not busy, I’d be glad for some help with bottling the Skele-Gro,” Draco says, and Harry’s pulse jumps. Neville tries, and fails, to not smirk, and Harry has half a mind to elbow him the same way
He puts on his slippers, noting that they’re dirty and he’ll have to ask Soto for a cleaning charm later, but his plans are rudely interrupted by a loud argument starting at the end of the ward. A door slams, and Draco immediately freezes his movement towards the curtain as he listens to two voices steadily rise.
Draco clears his throat. “Alright.”
could ever be awkward,” he jokes, lifting his nose haughtily, and Agnes breathes a laugh. He almost thinks he hears Narcissa laughing too, and feels the tension fade from his muscles.
A nagging voice in his head asks that if he has no problem looking at old pictures of himself, why should this bother him?
“You won’t regret it,” George adds, throwing his arm over his twin’s. Draco grumbles more, and Harry sighs again, ignoring the flare of jealousy in his chest.
Two days left until Christmas, and one until the faculty party.
He’s perfectly allowed to be here. There’s no reason he shouldn’t be, really.
Harry and Draco are often alone together. But up here, overlooking all of Diagon Alley as Draco’s arms wind around Harry’s shoulders, it feels like this is the first time they’ve been truly alone together.
He eyes his small notepad and self-inking quill on the bedside table, deciding he should probably take them with him. They slip easily into his pocket, along with the anti-nausea potion Soto gave him yesterday—just in case.
“We will,” Draco replies, unsure of how else he should respond. He steps aside, pulling his curtain back a little more, and gestures for her to step inside his cubicle. “Come in, sit down.”
She mutters spells under her breath that mean nothing to him, and he wills himself to relax against his pillows and the eternally stiff blankets. He feels waves of warm, heavy magic pass over him as Soto completes her diagnostic charms, listening intently to her soft murmurs and the scratching of her self-writing quill.
“What’re your plans for Christmas?” Harry asks eventually, and Draco hums. They have this conversation every year with the same responses, but Harry always asks anyway, and Draco always answers.
They sit quietly for a long time after that. Gilderoy’s snores are loud, but not louder than Potter’s steady, easy breathing directly across from him. He realizes at some point that his breath has synced with Potter’s, and he has half a mind to make himself stop, but can’t be bothered.
“In where?” Draco asks, adopting his best ‘I have memory loss’ expression. He grasps at memories of Gilderoy and his open, trusting demeanor. He tries to relax the grip he has on his robe's sleeve, and judging by the way Potter’s eyes flick to his hand, it was obvious.
, now — but it’s affectionate.
“Thank you,” he says. Soto’s eyes are soft when she pats his shoulder, lingering momentarily, before she leaves him to his lunch and sign language books.
Draco stares at the note as though waiting for something to change,reveal more information, or restore his memories,
He eyes them, wondering what to do with them, before he glances at the clock. It’s a quarter to four, and—seeing an opportunity—he decides to head to Soto’s office.
Quick, light footsteps approach his cubicle, drawing Draco out of his thoughts and making his heart jump. He knows those footsteps.
—in the past tense. “Wait. You
Draco’s stomach twists.
So it’s permanent brain damage, then. Caused by some unknown exposure to negative magic, that could’ve happened at any point in his life, and he has no idea when. Whether it’s from the war, or Azkaban, or the Aurors—he’ll never know.
!” he exclaims as though she said something scandalous.
He takes a few calming breaths, willing his pulse to slow and his muscles to relax, before he swings his legs over the side of the bed. The sun is up completely now, and the rain has stopped. The breakfast tray is gone from the armchair—Soto most likely took it—and Draco’s stomach growls.
“Look, Potter, I need to know, why are you here? I thought you had enough of me.”
Agnes purses her lips, but nods slowly.
He listens, and wonders what’s gotten into Draco.
Harry sighs. He’s put off grading long enough.
“Draco picked them out,” he mutters in embarrassment, and Ron bursts out laughing.
Potter lets out a drawn-out sigh, glancing around the cubicle for a brief moment before he sits in the armchair, elbows on knees. He produces two vials from his pocket.
He startles when Agnes suddenly starts barking, much louder than she usually does. He winces—the noise is grating, even through the door.
But in the quiet, with nothing between them except the air, Harry loves Draco for the sound of his breathing. Steady, soft. For the way his fingers inch towards Harry’s, but never touch. For the way he might be listening to Harry breathe, too.
“That should give you more time to think about what I said,” Hermione says, and Harry sighs.
There’s a reply too soft to make out. The voice, deep and strangely familiar, makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up. It can’t possibly be who he thinks it is...
to see Potter when he’s already on edge. On the other, Draco craves the stimulation of their arguments—mostly about the spell Potter used on him—and the way Potter has begun to speak to him like an equal, rather than a child like Soto did.
Agnes rolls her eyes and, with a slight shake of her head, plops onto her bed with a sigh. He sits in the armchair that Gilderoy recently vacated, watching as Agnes reaches for her notepad and scratches something down.
“Err, right, yeah,” he says, and he’s saved from pretending to know what he’s agreed to by Neville, who pulls them back inside and sends Harry and Draco off in the twins’ direction to say hello.
The curtains are pushed open abruptly, Potter not even bothering to knock. Draco rolls his eyes. Of course he wouldn’t.
Despite it, Draco’s eyes immediately find Potter. He couldn’t be any older than eleven. He’s short and scrawny, with his mop of messy black hair and hand-me-downs, and he’s entering Madam Malkin’s with a nervous expression. Draco glances at Bryn, and they give him a small, encouraging nod.
“Thank you,” Draco says, genuinely.
“Draco?” a woman calls softly. Draco is on his feet in a moment, flinging the curtains back, holding his breath and staring at the witch with wide eyes. Narcissa looks back, unrecognizable emotions flickering across her face. She’s strikingly beautiful, with her high cheekbones and thin lips, and any sign of aging seems elegant on her.
about what’s going on in other people’s lives, Potter. At least I don’t use random spells on people and lie about it.”
Neville clears his throat, and Harry realises he’s been staring. He tears his eyes away and thanks Merlin that no one can tell when he’s blushing, because he can feel Draco’s eyes on him.
But it’s privacy, and Draco likes the feeling of water over his skin.
Draco Malfoy.
Draco smooths out the wrinkles of his hospital robes with a nervous hand, glancing at the stacks of newspapers that he’s tidied up as much as possible, unable to resist reaching out and straightening them. Again.
been bad at this, then.
Potter sets a quick pace, and Draco follows closely, a bit startled when they walk past Potter’s office and into the hall.
Bryn sits on the stool by the counter, gesturing for him to sit on the uncomfortable-looking examination bed. He complies, discovering that the bed isn’t as bad as he thought it would be, and smooths over his robes as he anticipates what they’re about to say.
, Draco thinks.
— so he leans into Draco, tilts his head, and Draco meets him halfway.
“Brilliant. Er, I’ll see you tomorrow, then,” Potter says, and he turns to leave, his robes swishing a bit. Draco hesitates before he clears his throat, wanting to voice something that he still doesn’t understand.
in his eyes that Harry knows all too well not to trust. He feels an inexplicable need to drag Draco away from the twins before it’s too late. “I know that wasn’t a coincidence.”
“Can I sit here?” he asks, placing a hesitant hand on the back of the bedside chair. She nods enthusiastically, gesturing for him to sit. As he does, she offers up the crust of her toast at the end of a fork.
sort of make sense—even if he doesn’t understand how Potter was in the position to demote people. Still, something doesn't add up about the potions. He pushes the thought aside for later, when Potter isn’t sitting directly across from him.
“This is much better,” he comments. “Thank you.”
Gilderoy’s smile falters, a confused hurt twisting his features, making him look incredibly vulnerable for a moment. Draco feels a twinge of guilt, but Gilderoy’s smile is renewed soon enough as he gives a deep chuckle.
“I didn’t know that I could just
Blaise winces and drops the cigarette reluctantly, stomping it out in the snow. “I hate you sometimes, you know that?”
. It sounds like he’s asking permission.
“Shut it, Aggie!” yells another patient from the other side of the ward who Draco doesn’t know.
Defence teacher.”
Draco runs his hand through his hair, at a loss. Any information must be in the other healer’s offices—if there’s any at all. He doesn’t know how he’s going to get into their offices without a wand, but he’ll have to figure it out.
“Yeah? How,” Potter asks, and Draco sighs in frustration.
, doesn’t it?
the same one Neville and Blaise share whenever they’re about to do their meddling things.
comes from Agnes.
knew, Potter never wanted to see him again.
Agnes is barking about something again from her bed across the ward, making it difficult for Draco to focus on the Prophet with the headache creeping up on him. It’s an old issue from 1999, his own face plastered across the front page, the headline reading: “DRACO MALFOY SENTENCED TO TIME IN AZKABAN!” He pulls the paper closer, observing the haggard look of his younger self as he’s roughly pushed through a crowd of screaming people.
“Yes. I think you should start calling me Draco,” he says softly, not quite sure where the words are coming from, picking at invisible lint on his clothes. There’s no use, really, when Potter can’t see him, but it’s for his own sake.
.oOoOo.
“Well if you didn’t fire her, what
Harry grins, leaving Draco to greet his mother as he hugs Ron, taking care not to touch his dough-covered hands.
Pulse quickening with the hope it’ll be something useful, he unfolds it, reading:
“Nope,” she chirps, “Perk of owning the place is that I can take all the time I want off.”
The first thing Draco notices is that the memory specialist is around Potter’s height—a bit taller than Draco—and wearing blue robes instead of lime green like Potter’s. Draco wonders if they’re from a different hospital.
He’s painfully reminded that he’s standing directly in front of the potions storeroom,which is a very compromising situation, especially considering that potions have been going missing.
They all find their gifts under the tree. Neville and Draco gravitate towards each other after getting them. Harry’s is quill-shaped and wrapped in red paper, Neville’s is leaking, squirming, and pungent… and Harry eyes Draco nervously.
He pours himself a glass of water, sipping absently as his mind goes back to the dream. Now that he tries to recall the details, he can’t remember much of it at all, or even what made him wake up. Something about a storm, and Potter?
“I just escaped.”
Draco glances at Harry.
When they finally finish cooling, stabilizing, and bottling the Skele-Gro, they drop the bottles off in the Hospital Wing together, and Harry finds himself inviting Draco for a cup of tea before lunch.
Gritting his teeth, Draco turns to see Gilderoy Lockhart sitting up in bed and signing pictures of himself with a broad smile. The man is insufferable, constantly prattling about his own supposed accomplishments and giving Draco an autographed photo every day.
Harry shuts off the lights in his quarters with a flick of his wand, then makes his way down to the Great Hall as usual. He tries not to look too long at Draco when he sits beside Neville — who gives him a suspicious look, like all of Harry’s thoughts are written on his face. Harry only hopes that his thoughts aren’t obvious to
Draco appears behind Rosmerta, leaning in for a quick hug. His hair and shoulders are dusted in snowflakes, the tip of his nose pink and cheeks flushed, and Harry’s mouth goes dry. There’s always been something about Draco and the snow that makes his mind stop working, no matter how many times he’s seen it.
So not only are they working with someone else, but with someone who previously didn’t have access to the storerooms. Only one of them is in a position to be trusted with the potions, which narrows down the suspects, but the other one could be
Draco hums and moves like he’s going to pull away, and Potter’s grip tightens slightly. Draco laughs knowingly. “You’d have to let go of my hand in order to not be doing this, you know.”

“Good lad,” Soto says, grinning before she ducks out of Draco’s cubicle. He checks the clock—a quarter till twelve—and assumes that Narcissa will arrive soon, so he settles onto his pillows with an issue of the
Panic tightens around his lungs in a vice-like grip, but he somehow maintains his composure. He relaxes his grasp on the glass enough for his whitened knuckles to return to their original color.
Feeling restless and unable to go back to sleep, he reads over the note from the day before. He raises his eyebrows, amused at how messy his handwriting was due to the angle he wrote at, but he’s more relieved than anything. He actually remembers writing that note down—he was oddly afraid that he wouldn’t by the time he woke up—but more importantly, he can remember the notice and everything he discussed with Narcissa yesterday morning.
“Come in,” he calls with a heavy sigh.
Draco rolls up his sleeves, pulling a hair tie from his wrist and holding it with his teeth as he twists his hair into a bun. Harry watches. Once, it would have been hard to look away from Draco’s forearm, but now, it’s hard to look away from his hands deftly twirling his hair.
“What’re we doing?” Draco asks curiously.
Harry puts down his drink when Rosmerta glances away, hoping she won’t notice, and worries at his bottom lip. There’s some truth to what she said, but the nerves hit him at the thought of even
articles. He thinks about the peacocks at the World Cup, Diggory and Moaning Myrtle, the sour relationship with his father, the obvious feelings he had for Potter, ferrets and mermaids and dragons—everything.
thoughts, exactly as he had them and when they happened. He eagerly unwraps the package, skimming over the covers of two sign language books, but puts them aside in favor of a worn, leather-bound journal.
“Mother,” she says eventually. “It’s okay. We’ll get there.”
Potter is quiet for some time.
Rosmerta grins, almost feral, and rubs her hands together. “I like your mind, Zabini. That husband of yours been wearin’ off on you.”
“Well, Soto wasn’t exactly doing a stellar job here, was she? She
“Can I talk to you?” he asks. Draco can imagine him rubbing the back of his neck with that painfully awkward expression on his face, and he’s not sure whether he’s glad that he can’t see anything beyond Potter’s silhouette.
Harry looks at the other professors as Draco starts to tear open the paper, spotting Firenze immediately. He seems delighted in receiving a bad tie, putting it on over the one he’s already wearing, and Harry laughs. Minerva is wearing a new hat, Filius is cracking open a watercolour pan, Sinistra and Hooch have disappeared — Harry can guess where to — and Cuthbert is still asleep with a wrapped package beside him.
He rereads both parts of the letter, his confusion deepening. Realizing that it never mentions the case, or even St. Mungo’s, how did Narcissa know about it? It occurs to him that he could’ve told her a separate time, and it’s the only other explanation he has, so he accepts it.
Draco watches until the sky breaks and the rain falls more heavily, pounding against the roof and the window. He shuts his eyes, takes in the sound and loses his thoughts for a moment, before he shakes himself from it and walks to the bathroom.
Because at least Gilderoy knows who he is. At least he recognizes his
“Give the vial here,” Potter demands with a skeptical look, holding out his hand, palm up.
He closes the curtains behind him when he steps inside, sliding into the bedside chair with ease as Agnes settles into the blankets on her bed.
“Oh, don’t look so down,” Soto laughs. “Luckily for you, I happen to have some sweets on me that I might be inclined to share.”

Draco rolls onto his back. Sweeps his hair from his face. It splays on the pillow.
And, on top of it, it’s difficult to reconcile the Potter he knows—the healer, and the war hero—with this younger self.
They walk briskly back to the castle. Isabelle greets them in the entryway, rubbing against their legs.
point out that Potter is the head of the department now, and he could easily make someone else Draco’s healer, but… he doesn’t want to. Something about Potter’s expression warns against it, and Draco’s own curiosity about Potter makes him bite his tongue.
“I’d rather not repeat that,” Draco says, a flush on his cheeks, and Harry laughs. He can only imagine what she said — she can get pretty vulgar.
There’s the familiar tug of Apparition in Harry’s gut, before the fireworks slip away.
He sets aside a newspaper about the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, which he provided a statement for—it’s clear that it was
Draco spins around, heart in his throat. There, standing right behind him, is Harry Potter—all lime green robes, dark undereye circles and a scowl—and despite his expression, Draco’s heart thumps.
“Isabelle brought me something interesting this morning,” Draco starts, always skipping right over greetings. “I think she got bored of taking
“Just you two today, or is the blondie joining ya?” Rosmerta asks as she sets the mug down heavily in front of Harry, eyes glinting mischievously. It took some time after the war for Draco to even
“It’s standard procedure,” Potter says unnecessarily, like Draco is putting up a fight, and he resists the urge to roll his eyes.
“You look nice,” he says. “Very spiffy.”
Harry rolls his eyes — Draco still calls Neville
—while she takes the blue striped one.
Harry’s mouth goes dry. Draco doesn’t usually dress this nicely for the faculty party. In fact, it’s been a very long time since Draco has worn anything that’s not black.
,” she corrects, turning back to her book. She’s said all she needed to say.
know what happened—that he doesn’t know anything.
“Moron."
The Burrow’s garden is one of Harry’s favourite places to be. It’s full of life and the touches of family. Even in winter, buried in the snow, the plants are tall and green and beautiful. It’s as messy and random as ever, and Harry loves it. Near the thicker bushes are dozens of sets of footprints — evidently, the garden gnomes still love the garden, too.
her bar, and a lot more time for Rosmerta to forgive him, but Harry knows that there’s a place in Rosmerta’s heart reserved just for Draco now. Five years of friendship will do that to anyone, and especially a friendship with
The second thing he notices is that Potter’s eyes gleam when he sees them, and something about it makes his heart contract, but the specialist gives him a kind smile and Draco tries to shove his envy away.
Madam Puddifoot bustles out from behind the counter and beams at him, eyes twinkling knowingly when he asks for her best Earl Grey leaves, and sends him on his way minutes later with a tin of it.
The weight and feeling of the package gives him the impression that it carries books. Maybe—he thinks—sign language books. So it’s no surprise that when he unties the ribbon and takes the note, it’s addressed to him and signed by Narcissa.
“I hope you don’t mind that I don’t have any tea to offer,” he says cordially.
Harry laughs weakly. “I’ve been abandoned.”
“It’s important that you know what I can and can’t do for you,” they start. Their tone is even and professional, and Draco finds it reassuring. “The spell I’m going to use is called the Memory History charm
“The results of the test are going to take a few minutes to present on the page. I have a pretty good idea of what’s going on with your memories, but I’d like to have it confirmed first. Until then, I have a few questions to ask you, if you feel you can answer them.”
He winces when Narcissa blanches, eyeing him with barely-concealed hurt. Draco’s stomach clenches painfully, but of
Bryn is sweating slightly, breath coming heavy, and the room is silent for a few minutes except for the sound of their breathing. Finally, they push their hair out of their face with a sigh, turning a small smile upon him. Draco can only imagine the kind of exertion it would take to use that spell, and he wonders how often they perform it.
But that’s hardly anything at all, is it? No matter what Healer Soto says, he’s not exactly getting very far or regaining any of his memories. Newspapers aren’t working to trigger any memories yet, so Soto has suggested that he ask Narcissa to visit with some of his old things, once he’s cleared for visitors. Maybe he will.
, for being an
“I’m confused…” he whispers, drawing his hands to his chest and wringing them.
Some meta stuff~
Neville shoots him knowing looks, which he ignores. He glances to Draco’s face, and finds Draco staring back at him.
There’s a knock on the door just as his stomach starts to settle, and he flushes the sick away, taking quick, uneven breaths.
“Is this all?” he asks lightly. His Death Eaters laugh, loud and cruel, and the students begin to shift uneasily. The boy’s stare hardens as he glances over his shoulder, and Draco almost thinks he nods to someone. “Longbottom, I presume?”
The walk to the Great Hall feels different without glasses. It reminds Harry of when he was a student and his prescription was too weak. It’s a strange, unwelcome sense of deja vu, but he’s shaken from it when he sees a familiar — albeit fuzzy — blond by the open doors of the Great Hall.
It’s early morning, the sun not even up, when a new patient is admitted to the Janus-Thickey Ward. The only reason Draco knows there’s a new patient is because they're screaming bloody murder—which is concerning, but not surprising. On a normal day, Draco would be annoyed if he isn’t so curious about it.
They point to a graph near the bottom of the page with their wand. The graph is labelled with strange symbols, numbers, and filled by multi-colored lines—red, blue, and yellow, like the lights from the spell. Bryn taps their wand to the page, and the lines start to move.
Potter stops just outside of the ward, turning to stare thoughtfully at him, eyes intense and piercing. Draco’s heart thumps under the gaze, and he has to look away.
He winds his fingers into Draco’s hair, messing it up even further, and Draco makes a small noise of protest against his lips.
Merlin, Draco will be the death of him.
, and an Auror appears almost directly at Potter’s side, an unconscious, redheaded child in his arms.
Agnes canonically doesn't have a last name. She was hospitalized sometime before Christmas of 1995, and it's presumed that she either failed an attempt to turn into a dog animagus, or mistakenly drank a polyjuice potion with dog fur in it. More likely, the former. Her son is mentioned to be visiting her when Harry passes through the Janus Thickey Ward in 1995 - so I looked around and found Arnold Peasegood, born sometime around 1976, who worked as an Obliviator until 1999. His first and only appearance was in 1994 during the Quidditch World Cup. His connection to memories, as well as his age and nickname (Arnie, similar to Aggie), is why I decided to give Agnes the surname Peasegood.
“Breakfast, love. Have you done your reading today?” Soto asks warmly. Draco drags the tray closer, peering down at the fried egg, toast, and sausages. At least he has two sausages today.
“Finally found something for Draco?” Neville asks curiously as Harry sits down with a sigh and sets his bag from Scrivenshaft on the floor. Neville peers into the bag, frowning at its contents. “
“I’ll go. Got some Christmas shopping to do,” Harry says lightly, and Draco’s eyes gleam. Almost
(POTTER TALKS OLD SCHOOL RIVALRIES AND ROMANCE!)
A sliver of moonlight emerges from behind the clouds. The breeze whispers its gentle agreement.
this chapter peeks into 14-year-old Draco questioning/struggling with his sexuality, using slurs against muggle-borns, and there's the implication of publicly outing someone. I felt I should warn, as it could potentially be upsetting.
The plaque beside the door reads
Harry clears his throat. “A little.”
,” he mutters, more to himself than Draco. Again. Draco grits his teeth.
Alone yet again and sticking to the shadows, Harry locates the nearest table of food. His stomach growls at the sight and smell of everything. There’s a slice of treacle tart with his name on it.
Soto shoots him a disapproving glance as she places fresh robes next to the tray, and Draco remembers too late that she doesn’t take kindly to complaints or insults against other patients. Something about having sympathy for those who share your misfortunes. Distinctly uncomfortable, he turns his gaze to his lap.
“Good morning to you too. And yes, I think she did too. Now I know how it feels,” Harry jokes, and Draco scoffs. Harry smirks — he knows the story Draco is going to bring up. He could never forget it.
“Rose,” he says, voice heavy with worry, brow furrowed. His wand is in hand immediately, casting a myriad of diagnostic and healing charms on her—presumably someone he knows.
“Physically,” he starts, before he hesitates. Should he tell Bryn about his concerns with the potion and the brief two days of nausea—can he trust them? He’s afraid that he’s been too open, too naive. Decision made, he continues: “I’ve been tired. I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to sleep. Is that normal?”
. Harry mentally berates himself for looking, and turns his gaze up. Draco’s hair is tied in an elegantly braided bun, full lips painted pink, eyelids shimmery and blue.
Draco furrows his brow, lips pursed. Well, the lack of an answer about herbaria is disappointing. He'll have to figure it out some other way.
He passes Rue on his way back to his cubicle, as he usually does. And she gives him the faintest of smiles, as
“Well, let me clear up what it won’t do first. No spell can tell me who took your memories—it’s nearly impossible to decipher that. However, it
Saturday.
“There are more people here than I was expecting from you two,” Draco says shortly. Fred and George share a look.
In other news, my laptop bit the dust, so hurray for that (about a quarter of this was written on my phone, so I apologize if any weird errors came from that). I think it's safe to say that updates from now on will come every
He shakes himself from those thoughts, turning back to his search. Now isn’t the time.
. His privileges certainly will be stripped—he’ll probably have monitoring charms on him now, too. A long, grating lecture from Soto, for sure. He can hear her voice now, explaining all the reasons he’s stupid with an edge of concern to her words.
Potter clears his throat.
But just then, the twins’ voices sounds over the speakers, the music on pause: “A brand-new, unreleased flavour of Weasley-Zabini gin has been added to the floor —”
“You’re my healer, aren’t you? You volunteered your memories. You didn’t have to,” he points out. He thinks to himself that he’s only arguing because it’s Potter, but he knows he’s lying to himself.
And went to sleep—
Strange.
“Healer Cassidy told me about the test results. I’m so sorry, Malfoy. Is there anything I can do to help?” Potter says. For the first time, there’s only a straightforward sincerity in his voice, and Draco doesn’t doubt that Potter is being honest.
“I’ll be there the entire time. And remember, we can’t be hurt, seen, or heard. We’re only spectating. However, if you need to for any reason, we can leave the pensieve,” Bryn continues.
Harry opens his mouth to reply, not sure what he’s going to say, but Neville interrupts. “Rosmerta was entertaining the idea of putting mistletoe above the booth. Harry was against the idea of kissing you.”
His steps falter, and the hand reaching for the door knob falls to his side. His throat tightens, and his eyes burn.
tired than before, but nevertheless gets out of bed and showers. He hates the thought of losing daylight, especially after sleeping so much the day before.
The pieces slowly start to come together. Draco’s stomach drops. His eyes begin to sting from the stench of the potions.
“But I’ve been the head healer here for
“Quite the show, innit?” they say with a lopsided grin. There’s a gleam in their eye, bright and joyous, and Draco understands how they’ve come to be the best in their field. Surely, their passion must have contributed to that.
Draco’s throat tightens, suddenly confronted by the thought that he could be here forever, like Agnes, until he wouldn’t be able to remember how long he’s looked at these walls. He wants to say he’s sorry or ask how she’s stayed sane all this time, but he won’t.
? How?
He bites his lip and thinks that he owes Potter a thank you.
, he loves this man.
Maybe he should have asked for any book on potions. Narcissa surely could have provided one if he'd only asked differently.
“Blondie here?” Rosmerta asks, swirling her glass, the ice clinking.
He has to send it quickly. He’s expecting company any minute now.
. Their mugs from the day before are still on the coffee table beside the fireplace — which is full of ashes, now, and Harry shivers at the unexpected cold.
Draco snorts. “I highly doubt that. Your hands are too calloused to feel anything as light as

, Harry thinks nervously.
Draco smiles. Now that she mentions it, he notices that the ink
Trying to focus on something other than her staring at him, he downs the rest of his tea, even though it’s cold, and smooths down the front of his robes again. He hopes that Soto will be as eager as usual to leave and not think much of him hovering by her office. Otherwise, he’ll have sat here for nothing.
“We should get back to Hogwarts,” Harry mutters.
He sets his robes on the sink, carefully avoiding his reflection in the mirror, and turns the shower tap on. Most of the other patients don’t use the shower—they don’t have to, when the healers can perform cleaning charms which get the job done a lot quicker than bathing.
There’s a slight draft beneath the door, and Harry builds a fire — both he and Draco get cold easily — and he eases into the armchair with his tea. Draco, surprisingly, sits on the sofa, putting them closer together.
“Right,” he replies through gritted teeth.
The rest of the place makes it even worse, though. While his bedroom seems strange without Isabelle, the rest of his quarters are even worse without
Draco thinks for a moment. He knows her face. And he
“I’m sorry I don’t firecall more. I’ve been meaning to, but it just slipped my mind.” Ron and Hermione share a look, and Harry fidgets nervously — he recognises that look. It’s
because of it.
At last, Potter bids him goodbye, and Draco tears open Narcissa’s letter as he tries to push that interaction out of his mind. He's not sure why he's so flustered, or even stranger, why he's in a
Harry wakes alone to cold, empty sheets.
“By the way, thanks for the rescue back there,” Harry cuts in. Fred’s getting that
“There’s a compliment in there somewhere,” Fred replies after a moment, and Draco smirks.
“It’s okay. I didn’t have my hopes up,” he replies softly, voice breaking and betraying his emotions.
Thursday.
In a few minutes, it’s over.
“Yes,” Draco replies, wondering where Soto is going with this.
Draco moves on instinct while he does this, aware of everything he does now because of something that Healer Soto observed the day before:
It’s light and thin, a leather cord wrapped around it. The corners of the cover are curled in slightly, and the pages are faintly yellowing. He hesitates when he reaches to untie the cord, nervous for what he might find in the pages of the journal. He fears seeing too much or not being able to understand it, or even worse: finding empty pages, his hopes dashed to bits.
He puts his notes beneath his pillow—it’s too dangerous to have them out in the open, now—and peeks into the ward again. He’s just in time to see Wagner disappear into his office, the door shutting with a click behind him.
Their goodnight is soft and awkward, but it leaves a warmth in Draco’s chest that he carries with him to sleep. His dreams that night are of walking to room 4B, of the potions storeroom and everything within, of herbaria and bubbling green poison antidotes.
“Merlin, you’re old,” he says instead. Agnes huffs a laugh in that way that’s quickly becoming endearing, and Draco’s unease lifts.
Maybe it’s because it’s dark—everything seems to be said easier in the dark—or maybe it’s how intensely intimate their silence feels, but Draco finds himself wanting to fill the space with words.
for the drawings!!! ❤️ They're wonderful and I truly adore Robin for doing them.
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes is bursting with life, even more so than usual. All three floors of the shop have been rearranged to allow the maximum amount of people and games in. The shelves and products are no longer in sight — Merlin knows where they went — and all that remains are a few tables here and there filled with alcohol and food.
“Did we go through Skele-Gro that quickly this year?” he asks, and Draco nods around his fork.
“Well, it was to you,” Potter shrugs, and Draco can’t really argue with Potter when he’s right, so he doesn’t say anything at all. “Let’s go, huh? They’re waiting.”
“What’re you doing?” Potter asks, voice shaking ever-so-slightly. He doesn’t pull his hand away. Draco absentmindedly rubs his thumb over Potter’s, wondering how they got so calloused.
Draco shuts the journal with a snap, dropping it onto his bedside table and pushing away his disgust of the last few sentences he read. It’s no wonder that Potter didn’t want to see him again. He tries to put the sketches out of his mind, along with what they meant. They’re not
she would be hurt. Draco is her
But questions burn within him—threaten to consume him—and this journal could answer them better than anything else. He has no idea what he was like, or who he was, or how much he’s changed by losing his memories.
“Do you think mother and I would be welcome at the Burrow?” Draco finally asks, voice soft, not looking at Harry. Harry raises his eyebrows. He wasn’t expecting that.
,” Draco whispers, hand coming up to cusp Harry’s cheek. Harry goes breathless, leaning into the touch and reaching up to put his hand over Draco’s. Oh, Merlin. “I was beginning to think I’d have to say it first, you git.”
“Holy shit,” Draco mutters. “Is it like this all the time?”
He finds himself unable to reply as they walk to the second floor, eyes trained on Draco’s neck and wandering places they shouldn’t be, mentally scolding himself every time they do. Neville, thankfully, picks up a conversation with Draco himself.
“Look, Malfoy. Something like this slipping past
He only needs information: about potions, notes or files detailing when certain patients arrived, or any indicators of when the potions started being stolen.
Memory-Draco’s expression doesn’t soften, and neither does his voice, but Potter almost seems to take comfort in it.
He dresses quickly, eager to leave the room, and relief washes over him when he shuts the door behind him. The ward is mostly silent, save for the rain pounding on the roof, and Rue shuffling slowly from behind her curtains to sit by the door. He gives her a small wave and a gentle smile, finding some comfort in routine, and her lips twitch in response.
Bryn glances at the clock on the wall and purses their lips, but doesn’t comment on the time. Draco figures that they must be running behind.
He tries not to think about it as he knocks on Agnes's curtains. There are voices on the other side, and Draco groans internally when he realizes it's the new patient and Gilderoy.
As Bryn had said might happen, a pleasant warmth starts in the base of his neck and up through his hair as the threads collide, making the rest of him feel cold. The strangest sensation of heat spreads behind his eyes, like he’s going to cry, but he doesn’t.
Draco hates how much he wants to keep staring.
The snide voice in the back of his head reminds him that he
Narcissa shakes her head softly. “It’s how you’ve always taken your tea.”
He feels himself relax completely, almost against his will. It’s so unlike what he was expecting, and so calming, that he can’t help his eyes falling shut, and all his tension and irritation slips away from him. He absently thinks that he could fall asleep, if this continues.
“You said hello,” he says in awe, and Draco stares at him in confusion, before he begins to laugh.
“Morning,” Potter greets him shortly. Draco stares at him in disbelief. Morning?
He’s starving. He’s surprised that he didn’t wake up when Soto took the tray from the armchair—and he would’ve welcomed being woken up. He glances at the clock and sighs when he sees that it’s eleven in the morning. Did he really sleep that long?
He lurches, as if to sit up in bed, but when he opens his eyes, he finds himself exactly as he was in the dream: standing in the hall outside the Janus Thickey Ward. A handful of vials drop from his loose fist and shatter on the floor.
He puts the clipboard back on the hook, cracking the door open slightly and peering out into the hall to make sure no one is nearby.
, not a former friend, and he has no idea why he called her by her first name to her face.

,” Draco once commented, and it’s stuck with Harry since. It was years ago — back when Draco’s hair was still short and slicked back, sleeves always pulled down over his forearms, and Harry whole-heartedly believed he would end up with Ginny.
Another incessant
But a moment later, the heat fades, and Draco slowly comes back to himself, opening his eyes. Potter is penciling something on a small notepad, seeming amused, lips quirked and an eyebrow raised. Draco swallows roughly and sits up, avoiding looking in Potter’s direction, a flush climbing his neck.
He stands slowly, easing himself out of the armchair. Agnes doesn’t look at him.
—and by
But just then—
Silence. One beat. Two.
Bryn laughs easily and takes a small velvet pouch out of their pocket. From it, they pull a vial full of a swirling, luminescent silver substance.
“N-no! Stop plotting things! No mistletoe!” he cuts in at last, glaring between Rosmerta and Neville. “And certainly not enchanted
“We’ll see,” he says vaguely, and Rosmerta shrugs, knocking back the rest of her drink.
“Agnes,” he whispers as loud as he dares. “Can we talk?”
Lips quirked in reluctant amusement, he thinks that maybe he should’ve accepted Rosmerta’s mistletoe — and that Draco might have, if given the chance.
Draco slides into the booth beside Harry. He sits a little too close for comfort, his shoulder brushing against Harry’s. He smells like cold air and bergamot and something Harry can’t pinpoint, and Harry clears his throat. He slowly inches away, biting the inside of his cheek and hoping his discomfort isn’t showing on his face, and Neville stifles a laugh behind his hand.
“Yeah. The twins pulled him away,” Harry says with a slight frown, taking a sip of his — whisky? Scotch? He doesn’t drink enough to know the difference, and neither are really his cup of tea, anyway.
Unable to resist, Harry hesitantly tucks a loose strand of hair behind Draco’s ear, hand lingering. In his sleep, he turns his cheek into Harry’s palm.
He gives a sharp, small nod in response, digging into his pocket until he grabs hold of the potion vial that Soto gave him. It’s cool in his hand, and he welcomes it. He quickly uncorks the vial and brings it to his lips, steeling himself to open his mouth and just
“‘fraid not,” Soto says off-handedly. “We
“Harry?” Draco whispers, his voice catching over the
There’s a rustling of blankets and the pad of her footsteps as she walks to her curtains and pulls them aside for him. Her fur sticks up wildly, whiskers drooping a bit, but her eyes are bright. Draco probably doesn’t look any more presentable—loathe as he would be to admit that out loud, though.
Harry laughs, somehow loving Draco even more for that. “Please never say that again.”
Draco wakes up at dawn the next morning feeling somehow
capable of doing, too—he’s been adamant to bring a memory specialist to see both Draco and Gilderoy, and Draco has a meeting with the healer later in the afternoon.
A breeze rustles Harry’s hair. Shouts and laughter float up from below. He walks around the balcony, leaning close to the building and wondering if Draco isn’t up here after all, but then he sees him, and Harry’s thoughts are carried off with the wind.
true, and the words stick with him the rest of the day. He watches Draco and Narcissa most of the night, fitting right in with the Weasleys. The younger ones, especially, love Narcissa — probably because Draco is their professor, so that makes him less cool to talk to, and it’s likely that Rose is digging for embarrassing stories about Draco.
After all, he’s said it a million other ways, through little rose gold tins and blankets thrown over lean shoulders when fires start dying.
“How long have you been here?” Draco asks curiously. She shoots him an amused glance before she picks up the quill.
alone, so he doesn’t.
He puts his chin in his right hand, tapping the fingers of his left on the armchair as he thinks. Agnes shrugs.
Voldemort’s high-pitched, airy voice echoes in the courtyard, sending Draco’s skin crawling: “Harry Potter is dead, and though you have fought valiantly, it was in vain. Join us now, and no blood will be spilled. I do not wish to fight.”
Draco’s heart races. He had a
“Do you—remember a lot about
“Very funny,” he replies sarcastically, as Potter stands and sets the newspaper aside. He fixes Draco with a level look, and Draco can’t tell what he’s thinking at all.
The last time they saw each other was at Teddy’s graduation, and only briefly. But Molly already has a soft spot for Draco, after everything her grandchildren have said about him as a teacher — and if Narcissa is anything like Draco, then Harry’s sure that Molly will love her by the end of the night.
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist. She’s only repeating training,” he says, fixing Draco with an unamused look.
Harry accompanies Neville to Greenhouse Two after breakfast to put small scarves on the mandrakes. He’s not particularly looking forward to it, but Neville always makes pleasant company.
, ducking out of the examination room. He spares a glance at Draco, and if Draco didn’t know any better, he’d think it was a look of concern.
all around them, startling Draco and sending his heart thundering. Some of them are carrying or supporting the injured, soot-covered people from whatever disaster has occurred.
. Perhaps Bryn’s comforting words helped get him there, and Potter was the last push. Because he says it like it’s a secret only the two of them are in on. And, Merlin if that’s not dramatic, but Draco can’t help it. Something about Potter seems to bring out that side of himself.
According to the notice, the potions thief is still working inside St. Mungo’s, and keys people into the wards on the storerooms. Draco frowns when he thinks about it. The only reason they would do that would be if they weren’t working alone.
He’s re-cleaned and re-organized his entire cubicle before Soto pokes through Draco’s curtains to see what’s going on.
He passes by a stairwell. There are people coming up, and they don’t spare him a glance, like he’s not even there. He doesn’t mind all that much.
Again, much love to J, lastontheboat, for the beta. You're the best! I don't know what I'd do without you.
Much, much love to J,

Voldemort eyes him, expression turning incredulous.
“Hermione!” Harry groans, hiding his face behind his hands. “That was harsh.”
awful.
“How are you feeling?” she asks, her voice gentle as she tucks her wand inside her sleeve, and the clipboard disappears into thin air.
“Where’s Arthur?” Harry asks curiously.
“Hey, Rue,” comes a muffled voice. “How are you today?”
“Pardon?” he asks, but Potter only shakes his head.

He doesn’t say that Potter already
Draco self-consciously flattens his hair and smooths out his robes before he goes to Agnes’s bed. He doesn’t bother putting on slippers, though. Socks are quieter.
He swings his feet over the side of his bed and stretches, yawning, before he reaches for his glasses on the bedside table. His hand runs over the smooth table — and meets nothing, not even close to brushing the thin metal frames. He frowns and opens the drawer, leaning in closer to try and make something out.

Draco quirks his eyebrow, and Harry turns his gaze to his empty plate, heart fluttering.
On the ends of the shelves are categories, ranging from

Friday.
He's still frowning slightly by the time he's done writing his reply. It's quite short, simply thanking her and expressing that it would be lovely to see her tomorrow, adding that he would like to see some of his old artwork if possible.
“I know, I know,” he mumbles, laying down before she has to ask. He knows the drill by now. Soto offers a small smile, rolling up the sleeves of her robes, and lifts her wand.
Draco waits until he no longer hears the clicking of her boots to close the curtain and grab the letter. He stares uncertainly at it for a moment, at Narcissa’s name in green ink, hardly recognizing the handwriting. His handwriting isn’t as loose or flowy like it used to be, and if he didn’t already know he’d written it, it would take some convincing to make him believe it.
Draco holds the Earl Grey up and quirks his eyebrow in a silent question, and Harry’s lips twitch. He steps back and opens the door further in invitation.
“No change is a good thing, though, right?” Draco asks, swinging his feet over the side of the bed to face her properly. The clipboard disappears from Soto’s hand with a small
Draco’s eyes widen, and Bryn pauses a moment to let the words sink in.
A few moments later, corners of his lips tightening, Potter slips the vial into his pocket. Draco’s fingers twitch. He automatically wants to take it back, barely refraining from opening his mouth to demand it.
Draco thinks about it, expecting to be angry and hurt, but finds it easy to accept that it happened. He’s not even upset about it, not really—maybe in a distant sort of way, but he’s preoccupied by the realization that he doesn’t like how apologies sound coming from Potter, especially not for things Draco can’t remember. “I think you’ve made up for it since.”

articles he read.
“Yes, I’ve seen them,” he says. There’s something tight in his voice, and Draco worries he’s said something wrong, until Potter continues: “I’m the one who gave them to you.”
When did Molly knit that for him? Why did she? Does Narcissa have one too? The questions fly around Harry’s head, but they go completely out the window when Draco turns to him and smiles.
, exactly, but he’s grateful to be walked through what it’ll do. That’s a welcome change.
They walk down the hall, past Teddy, who’s been cornered by Hugo and Rose — Harry gives Teddy a pointed look, as if to say to just give up whatever he took from them, and Teddy’s hair turns red.
A heavy weight settles in Draco’s chest, a grim resolve settling over him. He received a similar note the day he transferred to the Janus-Thickey Ward, wishing him well and telling him to await another message. He sits, letting out a shaky breath. He supposes that
He can’t help but think about the absolute lack of discretion on the healers’ parts.

want to cooperate with me, so I just decided to let it do whatever it wanted (and I ended up stepping away from it for a bit for my sanity.) It starts off angsty, but I promise I won't leave y'all on a sad note. <3
Draco stumbles, his legs suddenly too weak to be able to support himself completely, and Potter cries out in alarm. He slides his arms beneath Draco’s to prevent him from sinking to the floor—and for a single moment, they’re chest-to-chest, Draco’s leg between Potter’s, breathing into each other’s necks.
Harry isn’t dreaming.
Agnes’s eyes narrow.
Harry likes Blaise. He’s funny, he cares about Neville, and he’s generally nice when he’s not conspiring. But being left alone with him makes Harry nervous, because he’s
Draco flushes, but breathes a laugh at it.
“It also has information about your mission,” she says, voice dropping in volume. He sucks in a sharp breath, eyes widening.
For now, he supposes that if he gets good enough at the alphabet, then he could at least spell out a hello to Agnes.
“What kind?” he asks curiously, a smile playing on his lips.
, but it’s different to actually see the effects of it.
Unfortunately, it seems that he did, because his expression turns uncomfortable and apologetic.
“A quill, Nev? A
As Draco watches, the blue and red begin to grow exponentially from the start, the yellow hovering near the bottom, until suddenly, the blue drops down to zero and the yellow shoots up. The red drops drastically, but not entirely. Draco’s chest tightens as a black, spiky dot appears where the blue line peaked.
They slip through the secret passages, hands interlocked, avoiding the portraits and the possibility of running into other people.
“Well, in that case…” he says, trailing off, and Soto chuckles easily. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a handful of colorfully wrapped candies, depositing them onto the lunch tray. They clack pleasantly against the thin metal.
He distracts himself by opening his present. It is indeed a quill — the feather reminding him of Hedwig, and he smiles a bit — and based on Neville’s embarrassed grin, it’s obvious that Neville was his gifter the entire time.
when Bryn used the Memory History spell.
“Ah, thanks for offering, but I just finished eating, myself,” he declines genially. Agnes pops the bit of toast into her mouth with a shrug, giving Draco a glimpse of her sharp canines as she chews. He turns his gaze away—thinking that he’d be uncomfortable if someone was watching
“I was going to get to this later, but I’ll ask now. Would you like to view a few memories involving you?” Bryn asks.
a choice. If he regained his memories, he would no longer be able to catch the potion stealer from inside St. Mungo’s, or worse: his attacker would likely come back to finish the job if he found out.
Potter falls silent, and it stretches between them. Draco continues to rub absent circles on the back of Potter’s hand.

He thinks of Draco, and his long, blond hair pulled into a messy bun, a stubborn strand always finding its way over his eye. His bottom lip is always pulled between his teeth when he brews, eyebrows furrowed when he counts his stirs.

Soto is being
It seems to work, because Potter stares at him, wide-eyed, as though he doesn’t believe Draco is actually here.
Sighing, he opens the bedside table drawer and slides the journal in. Out of sight, out of mind, after all. His hand lingers beside the table, pausing for a second before he grabs the sign language books. Now is as good a time as any to learn how to communicate with Agnes this way—even if it’s just saying something small.
. “Fine.”
and Harry waves lamely at his back.
“What’re you doing?” he snaps. Potter looks up from the newspaper to meet Draco’s gaze, raising his eyebrows.
Draco swallows roughly. Somehow, he hadn’t thought of that at all. But he can’t find it in himself to accept Bryn’s words right now. If he does, then he’ll start to wonder who he was at twenty-nine, and twenty-eight, and twenty-seven…. on and on.
He follows Potter into Madam Malkin’s, Bryn right behind him. His breath catches at the sight of a child who is unmistakably himself, standing with his arms outstretched as sewing tape measures zip around his torso.
“Good girl,” he murmurs, tying the letter to her foot, and resumes stroking her feathers. “Take this to mother for me, and stay there. Ask for treats. I don’t want you flying back in this.”
“I’m pretty sure he’s already left with Blaise,” he responds, and he can feel Draco’s laughter, more so than hear it.
“Explain why you’re smoking?” Draco says, an accusing note in his voice, and Harry relaxes marginally — so Draco

hear the whole shagging thing. “I thought you quit.”
“But you’ve got nothing against kissing Longbottom, Harry? I’m offended. It’s probably for the best, though. You couldn’t handle me,” Draco says with a wink.
It’s all he has left, and if it’s the key to understanding what happened to him and getting revenge on the people who did it… he’ll find a way.
I woke—and chid my honest fingers,
. He swallows against the lump in his throat, lips pulled into a frown. He’s still not sure he wants his memories, even if there’s a chance he can have them, but how could he say no to that?
Draco flushes. It’s been
“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Draco says tightly. Unsurprisingly, Basil says nothing at all. Agnes seems to be wincing as she watches the exchange.

And Harry wants — he
“Come on, I’ll take you back to your ward,” he says, setting off at a brisk pace before Draco can reply.
“Snooping,” he says, straight-faced, and Draco rolls his eyes.
With that last thought, he rolls over and shuts his eyes, fading easily back into sleep.
Draco resists the urge to scowl. For whatever reason, it seems Basil has taken a dislike to Draco. It’s no problem for Draco, but it is a tad irritating.
Around noon, Draco realizes he’s somehow spoken to Agnes for three hours and that Gilderoy will likely be waking up for lunch soon, so he should probably retreat to his own bed. He stands, promising he’ll talk to Agnes later and that yes, he really
Reading over Saul’s, Draco feels a little disgusted—Saul’s leg that Agnes mentioned as being “sometimes there, and sometimes not” was
After a moment of hesitation, she adds:
Surprisingly, there aren’t many people today. They must be staying indoors, considering that it’s colder than a witch’s tit right now, and he finds that he prefers the usual loud and boisterous bar over this. But at least he can spot Neville more easily than usual, sitting in a booth in the corner and cradling a steaming beverage, a few bags by his feet.
“What would you do?” he asks eventually.
He doesn’t usually attend the twins’ New Year’s parties just because of how many people usually go, but Blaise and Neville managed to drag him along this year. It helps that Draco also agreed, though if he’s honest, Draco is the
They part ways when they arrive at Hogsmeade, agreeing to meet at the Three Broomsticks at noon, and Harry briskly makes his way to Madam Puddifoot’s.
He looks at them side-by-side, skimming over the words, looking for anything that could possibly be related. His heart leaps when he sees that “herbaria” appears on both lists. If nothing else, at least he knows now that the list Narcissa gave him is definitely related to potions, and he would reason that they’re ingredients.
Harry mutters his praises, half-wondering if he’s dreaming, and Draco silences him with a searing kiss.
His hands are sweaty, but so are Potter’s, and it’s not as nice as he expected. But at the same time, it’s
Harry groans and buries his face in his hands. Is no one on his side today?
“How’d you end up in Gryffindor, huh?” Rosmerta asks, squinting at him, and Harry splutters. “You better suck it up if you ever wanna make something between you two. From here on out, you’ll be gettin’ no more help from me. That’s my New Year’s resolution.”
“I’m not sure I like this,” he admits, but cradles the mug close for the comfortable warmth and to have something in his hands.
Memory-Draco continues to talk at Potter. Draco doesn’t even hear the words, eyes caught on the differences in their expressions—Potter’s, growing increasingly indignant and disgusted, and memory-Draco’s, with a permanent curl of his lip and narrowed eyes.
...A calming spell. Merlin. Draco could gape at Potter if he wasn’t aware of how stupid he’d look doing it.

“You’re an idiot, you know that?”
. Intense. He almost seems like he’s longing, if Harry’s being hopeful.
“Yes, I’m fine,” he calls hoarsely. “Something I ate.”
usually does. Things are seeming to fall back into routine, and with no nausea, run-ins with Potter, or things to do about the potions thief for now, he settles into his armchair with the sign language book.
With his hair up, that stubborn strand in his face as usual, Draco approaches the table and gestures for Harry to follow. He does, rolling up his own sleeves as he nears the table, listening to the rises and falls of Draco’s voice as he instructs Harry on how to handle the Skele-Gro. It has to be cooled and stabilized magically before put into the bottles.
He takes out his quill and notepad, quickly marking down the potions that are missing. He doesn’t know if the potions are related to any of the ingredients he sent Narcissa—if those were even ingredients—and he doesn't know what the next step is going to be, but it’s somewhere to start.
“Healer Potter. He was kind enough to extract a few memories for our viewing today.” Draco’s excitement dims, and he tenses at the thought of viewing a memory of
tomorrow — Draco might even, too, because they showed up together. How likely is it that someone got a picture of him holding onto Harry’s elbow?
Draco stares at her. Confusion and hurt and anger swirl in his stomach, pulling him a hundred different directions.
, it says. Draco feels a twinge of guilt, but knows that Agnes is more than likely saying it playfully, rather than actually meaning it.
“You’re quiet,” he says. Draco raises an eyebrow, and Harry recognises the look as Draco trying to figure out how to say something. He waits, and takes a small drink of his tea as he does.
“You’re very welcome.” Bryn returns his smile easily. The self-writing quill continues to write. “Is there anything else you want to share?”
“Sorry, I didn’t think. If it bothers you, I’ll stop using my wand so much,” he says, stumbling over the words. And despite how awkwardly it was delivered, Draco’s heart flips at the (albeit poor) apology, and the thought that Potter would be willing to stop just because it might bother him.
Harry sinks further into Draco’s embrace, sighing. He could never tire of this.
Well, he's been putting that meeting off too, so perhaps he deserves it.
Bryn seems to catch onto his unease, and adds: “I’ve watched them myself. There’s nothing, uh, too disagreeable. I think you would be interested in seeing them, actually, given your concern about what you read in the journal.”
His muscles tense up, wanting to reach for his bedside table on instinct, but he sucks in a slow breath instead, as he feels warm, friendly magic pass over him.
In a moment of courage, foreign but not unwelcome, Draco reaches forward and seeks Potter’s hand out in the darkness. He finds it, and his heart pounds, and he turns it over so he can put his fingers between Potter’s.
is how they tried to stop him. It’s too much of a coincidence not to be.
Harry clears his throat and looks around the lab, at the shelves of potion tools and vials on one wall, books on the opposite wall, and a spinning rack of ingredients in the corner. They’re things like asphodel and Billywig wings, used often and not needing to be kept in certain temperatures or light. In the center of the room is a large table just for brewing, three cauldrons on it with a low fire.
Draco laughs too loudly for the joke. Harry sulks for the rest of the afternoon.
It’s been so long since he’s been out in Diagon Alley that he’s forgotten that everyone
with varying degrees of amusement and irritation. Rita Skeeter was particularly biased when it came to Draco (or any former Death Eater, for that matter), but some of the opinion pieces in the back of the paper make him crack a smile.

lack of memories, but he’s so useless that Draco just can’t imagine him being involved.
“Why did you keep that to yourself this entire time, then?” he asks indignantly. “You made it seem like some gigantic secret.”
that on the tree? 🤔
“Do you have no sense of privacy?” he snaps, shaking his head in irritation as he bends over and picks the papers up.
Anaise seems skeptical, but accepts it. He steps towards the window, removing his wand from its holster as he does. The window opens with a flick of his wrist. Stray drops of water land on the window sill.
has three weeks spent inside four off-white walls, an introduction to his own mother, an unsolved case, and exactly one conversation with Potter.
his memories back, but it’s an alluring thought. It would solve all of his problems, and he’d no longer wonder what sort of person he is or what secrets he kept.
His chest feels—warm, and full, and damn, he has feelings for Potter, doesn’t he?
He gently strokes her tawny feathers, hoping to reassure her. She leans into it for a moment, before she sticks her foot out obediently.
. What happened to you?” he mutters, probably more to himself than to Draco, so Draco doesn’t reply.
Harry’s hands wind in Draco’s hair as he tastes him — bitter like amaro and bergamot. Harry hums into the kiss, a moment passing before the corners of Draco’s lips twitch. He starts laughing — and Harry can’t help but join him.
She waits expectantly for his reply, and he flushes.
Draco opens his eyes to grey. He blinks. Spins in place, looking in every direction.

Potter smells very much like the hospital—the lingering scent of illness over him—but beneath it is something musky and
He thinks of what things would be like if Draco was with him. He can imagine Draco’s hand pushing open the bedroom door, shooting a sly smile over his shoulder as he slips inside, eyes inviting Harry to follow. He can imagine waking up with Draco’s hair splayed out on the pillows.
There’s no response—which, of course, there isn’t. Draco strains to pick up the sound of the healer’s footsteps, getting louder as she nears Soto’s office, and his mouth goes dry before the steps soften again. He’ll have to leave eventually, but how can he do it without the trainee seeing him and before Parson arrives?
“Merlin’s balls, Harry, he’s dressing you now? And you haven’t even kissed?” Ron says, wiping tears from his eyes with the back of his hand, and Harry punches his arm.
, Draco reminds himself.
Draco thinks that he probably won’t leave the memories for anything, even if they are completely horrible, but keeps the thought to himself.
“No hugs for me?” Bill jokes from behind Ron, and Harry laughs, going in to hug Bill, too.
Draco sits in the opposite chair when the tea is brewed. He stares at the fire, sipping his tea every once in a while, and Harry gets the impression he isn’t in a talking mood. Harry is happy to provide quiet company.
He hums in thought, absently fiddling with a loose thread on his robes, and wonders whether Draco’s collection could use some more Earl Grey.
week. 😅 And once again, the lovely J beta'd this for me, so much love to him! ❤
The doors seem to lead to offices, general check up rooms, and a staircase going down that must lead to the other wards in St. Mungo’s. Faint voices and footsteps float up to him, getting softer as they move away from the staircase, and his curiosity almost leads him to follow the sound.
He understands now why there weren’t.
“Yes, yes, but
“What? Can I see it?” he asks, leaning forward slightly. Narcissa’s gaze remains determined.
Instead of leaving him uneasy, it only makes him smile.
was unpleasant.
In his quarters, he takes a long, cold shower and busies himself with cleaning to get his mind off of Draco.
“I can’t say I would feel any differently in your shoes. And, because this is something a lot of my patients have struggled with, it doesn’t make you any less
must Potter be so stubborn?
But it occurs to him that what’s happening in St. Mungo’s is probably the reason he lost his memories in the first place—he must’ve known too much or was coming close to catching them when he was an Auror, and
Snow begins to fall, the snowflakes, gentle things that melt when they meet Harry’s skin. Harry smiles — Neville grumbles.
“I brought the letter with me,” she says, and Draco’s eyes shoot up to meet her steely ones. “It has information in it that could potentially help you regain your memories.”
He’s woken later by a sharp knock, and he jerks awake, grumbling and reaching for his glasses. He staggers to his door, pulls it open, and blinks — Draco is waiting for him, eyeing him judgmentally, and Harry looks down at his crumpled snitch-themed pajamas.
Really, it’s as if they never existed in her hemisphere at all.
He strides across the study, footsteps pattering softly until he reaches the end of the rug, when the heels of his shoes start clicking hard on the wood. He slips his wand back into his holster and reaches for the door handle, swinging it open and stepping into the hall.
He looks across the room to see Molly fussing over a very red Draco, brushing the soot off his robes while Narcissa greets Draco with a fond smile. Harry’s heart tightens at the scene. It’s almost like Narcissa and Draco have fallen right in with the Weasleys, without any preparation needed, and Harry wonders if Molly and Narcissa have kept up some sort of correspondence. It’s hard to believe they get along so well.
“—that’s all.”
Draco’s answering smile fills every corner of the room with warmth.
They round the corner, and Harry softens when he sees Hermione reading in the armchair by the fire, Ron and Bill cooking — and to his surprise, Molly, talking with Narcissa Malfoy by the window. He didn’t know she was already here.
“Healer Soto told me to give you this potion. It’s for your nausea,” she says quietly, holding out the vial for him to take. The potion is thick and deep green in color, and Draco takes it from her. Exhaustion makes his movements slow. He really just wants to go back to sleep.

consider a quill a few days ago. He immediately discarded the idea, of course, but it crossed his mind.
He wakes around an hour later to the sound of someone calling his name.
Rue is still staring at him by the time Soto’s door opens, and Draco stands quickly, almost splashing the rest of Narcissa’s tea all over the floor. She doesn’t even look at him as she starts towards the ward’s entrance, and anxiety tightens Draco’s chest before he shakes it off.
"That'll be the results," Bryn explains. They look over the few pages, humming in understanding occasionally at whatever they're reading.
He makes his way up the spiraling stairs, trying not to knock into anyone as he does, and he’s breathless when he finally reaches the roof. He’s surprised to see that it’s only a balcony overlooking Diagon Alley, the railing wrapping around the small tower of the shop.
Draco shifts his stance, hair falling over his shoulder, and Harry’s eyes catch on the movement.
she writes with a wink. Draco lets out a short, startled laugh, almost slapping a hand over his mouth when he realizes he’s laughing about his own lack of memories. How morbid.
Draco pulls his hair out of the bun, falling in a messy braid over his shoulder.
Spells and hexes are cast left and right, and Draco flinches as a few pass through him, but he can’t tear his eyes from the sight of Memory-Draco. His face is tear-streaked and terrified, and despite it, is fighting his own people with Potter at his side.
“Don’t worry,” he whispers with a small smile, “You’ll be okay.”
Harry’s heart twists. He isn’t sure what makes him do it, but he finds himself leaning forward and putting his hand over Draco’s, a thrum running up his arm at the touch. Draco’s eyes widen.
For whatever reason, he woke up two weeks ago unable to recall his own name. Still, he was able to remember that someone in St. Mungo’s has been stealing and selling potions meant for patients—and can be fatal when administered incorrectly. He has a feeling that no one is going to stop them if it isn’t Draco.

Draco glances over his shoulder as the twins whisk him away, mouthing a
She smiles politely. “I didn’t expect any.”
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” Hermione says, not moving from the armchair or looking up from her book, but there’s a smile on her face.
“But I want you to know that people change, Draco. If it’s reassuring to know, you—at twenty nine—were much, much different than how you were as a teen. Whatever you read in your journal doesn’t show the person you grew to be. And it’s regretful that you haven’t been given that opportunity.”
Shortly after breakfast that morning, he double and triple checks that he’s signing “hello” correctly before he’ll visit Agnes. It would be embarrassing to do it wrong—even if Agnes would probably appreciate the effort—and he’d rather avoid his horrible blush that always shows just how embarrassed he gets.
They’re gone for good, now. There’s no chance of getting answers to half of the questions he had.
Draco quirks an eyebrow. “It’s called being
Harry stops in his tracks when he sees Draco, wearing blue and silver robes, fiddling with the cuffs of his sleeves. They’re patterned with snowflakes, the cut accentuating the taper of his shoulders down to his waist and…
As he passes by Gilderoy’s partially-closed curtains, he can’t help but peek in and roll his eyes when he sees that the man has gone back to sleep. His breakfast tray is empty, precariously placed atop a stack of books written by or about Gilderoy.
Part of him expects to be met with an invisible barrier when he reaches for the doorknob, but nothing happens. He glances at Rue, who’s gone back to staring, before he pushes one of the doors open.
“Mother,” Draco says, just as Ron says, “Harry!”
“Healer Soto recommended during my checkup that I see a specialist. To determine if there’s any damage to my magical core or my brain.”
But in all honesty, the comments only bother him because apparently, Gilderoy used to teach Draco. To think that he knew this man, spoke to him, learned from him, but not be able to remember any of it? It leaves a sick feeling in his stomach.
Shortly after, Neville goes to find Fred and George before the party gets even louder and more full, leaving Harry with Blaise.
“Thank you,” he says quietly. “I just don’t know if I want to remember a lot of the things I did and the things that happened to me.”
“That explains why you’re so
fingertips.”
But all at once, in the safety of privacy, complicated twists of emotions grip his heart, grief and confusion and anger, so heavy and tight that they rise in his throat.
"I know I've been a bit of a recluse the past few days, but I wanted to pop by and say hello," he says.
It was all a dream. Thank Merlin.
Uhh Drarry things are happening! Yay! Only took six chapters to get here. *sweats*
Voldemort’s expression turns venomous, and suddenly the hat upon the boy’s head is on fire. He drops to the ground with a shout, the other students screaming his name, before he pulls a
incompetent. Tired, and maybe overworked, but not incompetent.
At some point, it becomes them watching each other, pretending to watch the fire and allowing each other to stare without saying anything — and they are content in it. Harry isn’t sure how much time he spends glancing between Draco’s crossed feet and his face, but he eventually looks up to find the fire dying and his cup drained.
