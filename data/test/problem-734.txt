He bit at Harry's lower lip and was rewarded with a groan and a particularly hard grind against him, forcing out a moan and a gasp of his own, his head jerking back and thumping against the tree, their lips breaking with a slick heated noise.
Then he opened the drawer again.  It took him a full couple of minutes of sorting through the letters until he found the one he had written first.
Draco could feel that leaden sort of stillness start crawling up his legs, the fog edging at his brain, wanting to pull him in.  Just that, just hearing this was 'not good' from Harry, meaning it was even worse than what Narcissa had said about Lucius coming home.  That was enough to make him want to just turn inwards and disappear.
“I'm not surprised.”  Draco mumbled, getting busy with putting away the milk and sugar cubes that were on the counter.
“You don't know who he is, do you.”  Harry shoved his hands into his pockets, taking a few steps closer to Draco and looking up to the blonde's face.
I failed, and Draco is dying… I can't let him die... I don't care if I live, I'm done living. So many people died because of me. I'm done...
He flinches. "I didn't!" His voice is bewildered. "I didn't steal it. I just wanted to take a look."
I look down at Malfoy's dead wide eyes staring at the ceiling; at his face frozen in surprise; at his wand, still pointing up.
I take a step forward, and another one, and the next, each next one surer than the last, the fall of my footsteps loud against the stone floor. I hear gasps of dismay and outrage, the crowd shifts around me and withdraws further. They want nothing to do with me.
I turn to look at him. He stands by the bed, fiddling with the hem of his faded pillowcase. His ears droop, giving him an even more sad and ancient look than he usually has.
"Looks like Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass have got stuck under the enchanted Mistletoe in the doorway," says Hermione.
The light flares on, and I stare at the three of them in the doorway. Grim, stony-faced, all three hold me at the wand point. We stare at each other in silence. Potter is the first to lower his wand.
"It's dark when you cover my eyes." I put my hands over his, slowly pulling them away. "And now it's not."
"No!" I'm jealous, so fucking jealous. So jealous I can't breathe. I want to strangle him for making me feel like this.
I am grateful for this; I'd rather not discuss it. McGonagall is waving her wand in a complicated pattern in front of the class.
Rubbing my face against his nape like a cat, I wind my arms around him and squeeze, feeling his strong shoulders and hard chest.
However, the Dark Lord doesn't strike. "Well, Neville, I am sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
"What?" The word is stuck in my throat. I am an idiot, but every time, in  moments like this, I think you are going to say
I turn on the spot and exit, hurrying up the steps, back along the hall, past the damned living room door and up the staircase to my bedroom. I've used the living room as my sleeping place before, but when Potter and those two had returned, I moved to the bedroom on the first floor, just to the right of the staircase. It's dark and shabby, and I don't like it. Not that I particularly care.
She was tall, your eyes at the same level. Long dark hair and elegance. Her face looked familiar. A light-grey dress. You looked up from her bright blue-jade shoes on the stone steps of the porch and met her eyes.
He cards his fingers through hair of my groin, giving it a tug. This is something new, something else, other than we've already had; it makes me wild; it scares me.
When you reach the door, a shout makes you turn. In the circle, Henry shoves Tom away from Christopher's hunched form. It’s an unexpectedly powerful movement for such a small man. Mr. Vice is shouting, ordering Henry to step back.
I exhale and reach for the hem of my sweater, pulling it over my head. My T-shirt follows. I get rid of my jeans, leaving them on the floor, and climb into bed in my boxers. And switch the lamp off.
She listens to me, and her face crumples, and she nods, and nods, and nods. And then I know. She won't say it, but I
For once, Potter has stopped stalking me. Probably Dumbledore told him to. He used to lurk in the background every time I set foot outside the Great Hall or classes. No doubt he imagined himself a master of stealth and me being none the wiser. Idiot. A drunken bear is subtler than Potter creeping behind me along the corridors.
With a sigh, I gingerly take a few steps forward, until my fingers finally brush the doorframe. Sliding my fingertips down, I find and press the door handle, entering the bathroom. My hand automatically reaches for the switch on the wall before I drop it.
That would be one of those moments - I'd think, drifting into sleep in your arms - one of those rare glimpses that would become so precious to me; one of
Potter turns to stare at him. He's been sitting motionless all this time, giving the impression that he isn't listening. Now, by his rigid posture, I realise that he is poised to lash out any second.
With my eyes closed, I felt his presence looming over me. I was too weak to even squeal, the tiniest movement was agony. My chest was burning, my neck, my stomach, my lower belly. Although Snape had patched me up, it would take time to heal. That vile thing Potter threw at me was eating at my skin from the inside.
My eyes suddenly prickling, I turn my face away. Fuck. Isn't that stupid? My useless eyes are unable to see but still can cry.
I open the narrow double door and peer into the cabinet. Nothing. Empty. I retrieve a walnut from my pocket and carefully place it in the middle of the empty shelf and concentrate.
"Draco!" A shout from above makes me look up. Harry is dashing right at me on a broom, Granger and Weasley, each on their brooms, are behind him.
to guard the tent while they are asleep. Or rather Granger doesn't trust me, and Potter agrees to appease her. Once he offered to share the night watches with me, so that they would be easier to bear, each of them getting better rest. Granger said no. She was adamant, and Potter didn't insist.
side, I don't think I truly belong to one or the other. I just want all this to end. But I promised Harry; the last thing I said to him was that I was on his side. So as soon as I descended from the seventh floor into this hell, I knew that I'd do everything in my power to help Harry's side win.
"No, we'd never... it hadn't come to that." His hair is in my face, I blow it out. "Last night - with
"I found it at the Astronomy Tower, later," he says. "When we threw Yaxley off and left Grimmauld... I thought something stung me through the pocket..."
Fuck, why did Potter have to bring these two here? Was it absolutely necessary? They hate me, and not without a reason, I must admit. If Potter is counting on their help with the solution as to what to do with me, he is mistaken. His friends will only make everything worse. Worse for me.
I am alone in the centre. My breath is shallow, the broom in my hand is my only support, and my heart threatens to choke me.
Relief washes over me, suddenly taking all the tension away. I exhale. It feels so good, just to sit here by the fire, eat my sandwich and stop fretting, if only a little.
"Who is that?" Someone says next to me. "Hagrid's carrying... Neville, who is it?"[17] Ginny Weasley pushes her way forward.
I don't avoid her gaze. After everything that had happened, no way am I afraid to say the words, to admit them out loud. They are just words.
Putting the note into the box, I close the lid and open it again to find that the note has disappeared. Fucking hell, it's working! I'm grinning like an idiot. I close and open the lid to find a reply.
"Draco, dear..." She squeezes my hand over the table. There's such pity written over her face. My Mother knows too well what Family means.
stings. It feels like a bitter aftertaste of everything that has passed between us in the last several years.
"No... that was..." He waves his hand, searching for a word. "Competitiveness. To prove that Slytherins are able to last longer than any other House."
He tightens around me and cries out, as though in pain, over and over, and grips at my thigh, his other hand flying frantic, spilling hot between us, and it seems like he'll never stop.
"Don't flatter yourself," you scoffed, but your lips pressed to my shoulder. "I'm good. Probably will have a problem walking in the morning. But it's a small price to pay for the honour of having the Saviour's golden dick."
"They are coming!" Someone says, and the voice rings loud in the hushed Great Hall. "They are coming!"
Although all Henry could see was the guy's bright-blond hair, styled so neatly that no strand was out of place, and a high collar of his white shirt... Henry knew perfectly well who he was. He would recognise him with his eyes closed, by the voice alone.
I turn to look as she waves her wand, casting something that makes Malfoy cry out in pain, as his bones align with a loud sickening sound.
I didn't expect that. Everything I intended to say evaporates as I stare into his pale eyes. Dark circles around them make Malfoy look ill. His face is so gaunt, why had no one noticed that he’s lost so much weight?
"Harry! Pour dittany into the wound! Five drops, hurry!" Granger yells, springing on her feet. She runs around, slashing the air with her wand. "Salvio Hexia! Protego Totalum! Repellum Muggletum! Muffliato!"
“Well, it’s complicated, but - simply put - the essence of a Patronus can be turned liquid with a spell and collected, and then added into the potion at the final stage.” The clinking of glass ceases.
"I've passed, Harry!" She is bouncing, her face lit up with joy; she looks like a drop of sunshine. "They had made me an offer!"
"No, I didn't..." Potter takes his glasses off and pinches the bridge of his nose. "Just before you came in with the Death Eaters, Dumbledore cast a Full-Body Bind on me and covered me with my Cloak. He told me that you were acting on his orders, and he made me promise to protect you.
," I nod at the folder, feeling oddly warm in the face. His praise makes me feel weird. Good and weird at the same time.
Trying to turn on my side, I find myself trapped between his back and the sofa - there's no room. I don't feel my left arm up to the shoulder, and my neck aches, bent between the cushions at the awkward angle. I open my eyes, trying to blink the grogginess away.
"You're making it up." He shuffled away in his seat. "Everyone hates me, I haven't had a chat since I arrived with anyone here but you… let's just drop it."
"They must have held the boy captive." Greyback shoves Harry in the back so hard that he stumbles forward. "I'm not sure who is
One year ago to the day. The two of you are standing side by side, clad in Muggle jeans, identical plain white T-shirts and black bow-ties. You lean against a railing, the Houses of Parliament in the background. You are showing off your left hands to the camera, wearing identical white-gold wedding rings.
"And I didn't mean anything," he says, "I just... didn't know it's your birthday, and now I know... that's all. So happy birthday." He looks at me.
of course it is, its black outline standing out against his skin as ugly as I remember. It hasn't changed, but I know
I'm doing and withdraw, utterly horrified with myself. But he follows my lips with his and seeks and finds them, kissing back,
"No... alone... I was wanking myself, alone." I look down again at my hand flicking over his cock – flushed and thick, filling my palm perfectly - this is absolutely crazy. "Imagining watching
"But now you do the right thing," he continues, "you make amends. You are a better person now than the You that took the Mark."
and you have no idea that your house is pretty much sentient? You might have not known, initially, but... didn't Kreacher tell you?"
Down in the Common Room, Zabini rises on his feet. Malfoy is saying something to him, leaning over the desk. Parkinson sits down, placing her hand on Malfoy's tilted up arse, giving it a pat.
“Watch where you’re going, Potter!” Malfoy’s voice bristles when I bump into him after dinner, on my slow way up the staircase in the Eighth Year Common Room.
The sound of my name startles us both. I turn. Potter and I gape at each other. By the look on his face, he is even more shocked than I am with him using my given name.
The next day, none of us speaks to each other. The awkward silence hangs in the air, our embarrassment palpable.
I want Noir, but that would sound cheesy. It would sound stupid, it would be offensive, because there is no Noir and has never been - all this time it was only Malfoy. And now, when the dream and reality clash, when two images become one, I am at a loss. I don't understand what I feel, what I want. I don't know.
"I'm sorry, Ron," I repeated, "it's just... I trust you, it's not that... it's terrifying to say the thing out loud when no one expects you to, when everyone expects the opposite."
Mother squeezes my hand and smiles. She says no more and strokes the back of my hand with gentle fingers. Her touch is soothing, my eyes close.
Sad and piercingly bright - hopeful and beautiful - a melody fills the house; you've never heard this one before. The living room around you is bright and airy, filled with sunlight. Exactly like he imagined it. You love it.
A strong, elegant hand with long fingers, his trimmed polished nails dully reflecting the sheen of the diamonds.
"Are you fucking insane?!" With a grunt, I got myself seated behind you. "Have you ever ridden such a thing before?"
Hermione squeezed my hand in reassurance, but she was only trying to cheer me up, knowing that in fact I'm right.
The slide of a curtain. A shower begins to run in one of the stalls to my left. My hand resumes the movement, and I clench my jaw, trying not to make a sound.
"You seemed completely okay," he continues, "with your usual dislike towards me and all. I even thought that - you and me at Hogwarts again, hating each other's guts - the world seemed to be back to normal, you know."
She touches the inside of my wrist with her fingertips lightly, just above the place where Father's band had left its mark, and I feel a faint thrum of her magic flowing beneath my skin, mingling with my very blood.
In my room, I take my clothes off, throw them on the floor and head to the shower. I stand under the hot water and don't even bother to wipe my tears. Water takes them away. I myself wouldn't notice the traces because there are none.
"Reasons," he says, "I just... I broke up with her, to keep her safe. It's dangerous to associate with me. For anyone, let alone my 'official' girlfriend." He makes quotes in the air. I guess I hear the bitterness in his voice.
Why was it there? Tucked away on a hanger under the jacket he was wearing when he left for the Manor.
I shrug, turning my face up to him. I morbidly want to know what his face looks like right now. Is it smiling? Is it dreamy? Is he satisfied, thrilled, excited?
"Fucking bastard." You bend down and captured my lips, moving, moving all the while, until you came with a stifled cry.
"No... I mean, with that thing that troubles you," I say carefully. "In the bathroom... you told Myrtle that-"
Later, watching his sleeping face, I thought how everything had changed, how many changes this New Year is yet to bring us - changes that I want to discover, waking up beside him every morning.
His silhouette retreats, and there's a sound of the opening door. "Come find me when you pull your head out of your arse."
“Maybe?” He snorts behind me. “Most certainly, more like.” I feel his hands on my back, pulling the jumper down from where it got stuck under my armpits.
Your gaze fell on the wardrobe, and before you knew what you were doing, your hands were throwing it open, reaching among his things—to the dark green jacket. Under its collar… your fingers slipped, found the thin wooden frame of the hanger and stopped… then reached forward and wrenched the damned thing off, bringing it out into the light, only to discover that the delicate jade thing—the scarf—was gone. But the scent still lingered.
Eyeing him sideways, I take a sip from the bottle. Dry and crisp, the wine tastes nice and gets to my head quickly. Our situation seems less grim to me with every passing second.
I slide my palm down his stomach - down, down, his belly is smooth - until it touches coarse hair and hot flesh.
The sound of a bottle spinning against the hard wooden floorboards goes on and on and seems like it’s never going to stop. I take a sip from my glass. Twice.
Beams of light shimmer on your skin, making your lazy posture look golden and silvery and ethereal, like a mirage in the hot air. One leg dangling in the water, you sprawl boneless on the stone edge of the pool.
I watch as Malfoy's hand is resting on Parkinson's throat, the other one gripping her around the waist, pressed along the length of his body, as he tilts her chin up in a greedy kiss.
him until he shudders. To kiss his nape and shoulder blades afterwards, and bury my nose into his wet hair
I'd rather prefer the cosy bedroom the Room of Requirement provided for me at Hogwarts. At least the space was small and clean, and I felt perfectly safe there. Yet, here I am. In the vast living room of the ancestral home of the House of Black, tossing on the ancient sofa. I couldn't bring myself to sleep in one of the bedrooms on the upper floors. Potter said I may take whichever room I want. So the living room it is.
"You sound too happy about it, Potter," he scoffs, gathering his things into his bag. "Well, your friends are here," he lowers his voice. "See you around."
Hermione told me on our way back from the Room of Requirement. She was mistaken. We are both going to die, because of Sectumsempra - the one that I cast and the one that I didn't.
"Trousers are not allowed for women. Skirts or dresses should be worn at all times; the hem of a skirt or a dress should cover the knee."
has; he is changing. Though the stain, the reminder of what he'd once been, is etched into his body and will never go away.
"So Malfoy led Death Eaters in on Dumbledore's orders," Potter says, and his friends stare at me as though I've grown a pair of horns.
The jade scarf, the dainty flowery whiff of a perfume, his absence, his evasive eyes, his frequent visits to his mother, his weekend shifts in the Department of Mysteries. The necklace. A weightless web of golden strings, pouring diamonds into his open palm; the waterfall of sparks sluicing down to kiss the secret Narcissus sign on the inside of his white gold wrist.
for fuck's sake! Making it all about himself and then disappearing out of spite, just to alert everyone. You're such an attention whore."
And I do. My cock throbs, sweetness bursts in my body, and my come smears on his back. I lie on top of him and feel him
- use my wand these days, but the wards around the room are designed to recognise my magical signature.
I come close to trace my fingers up his right forearm, and the other - the one he holds stiffly, not trying to hide it though.
I flinched at the Dark Lord's name that he said so easily, as though it were nothing, as though it were the same to him as saying
It pisses me off because now there's no reason to be rude and just tell them both to fuck off until they start treating me
I try to stretch my legs. He stirs. Carefully, I slide my arm from beneath his head - I must do it before it dies completely - he turns anyway.
That was at the beginning. When you stayed almost every night. Before little things started creeping in between us. Before we started to fight. And even after. You always came back.
I didn't have a choice. I had already decided to follow. Whatever happened, I had no one but Potter. He gripped my forearm and led me out of the tent to the silence of his friends. We stepped out of the protection sphere and Potter Apparated us away.
I expected. The fool that I am, surrendering to Dumbledore’s mercy, I was sure it would be different. I thought that he’d hide me somewhere and find a way to sneak my parents out of the Dark Lord’s clutches. I thought he would say that I needn't worry anymore; I thought he would take my burdens away. I thought he would relieve me from the Dark Lord’s task. I thought it would be different, I thought it would be the end - of my fears, worries, danger. Little did I know, it was only the beginning. I went to him for help, but instead, he gave me another task that was different and the same as the Dark Lord’s.
We fly, gathering speed, dodging the heaps of furniture caught in bonfires that reach the ceiling. I grip Harry around his chest, press my forehead into his back and hold on for dear life. At some point, he shifts his grip on his broom and curses, turning the broom around.
“I don’t know,” Hermione replies, “it’s hardly forbidden to attend the party, and most likely Daphne invited her sister.”
"Now, class! I require your attention," the professor begins over the buzz of voices. "From this day, till the end of the term, you are partnered for the Potions class with a person you share a desk,
look arrogant, though. But not like your father." I reach out and tuck the strand behind his ear. In no time it will fall on his face again. "I like it."
"They broke the Taboo, said the Dark Lord's name." Greyback grabs Granger by the arm. "The Mudblood and the Weasley. They are on the top list, I want my reward."
"It's fine, I'll just sit on the steps in the courtyard till you're finished." Keeping my hands on the back of my chair, I gingerly step around it. "Take your time."
"I don't know." I shrug. I really have no idea. I don’t think I care. "But I promised Dumbledore to help you, so... I must figure something out. Until then, you'd better stay here." I head to the door.
bitch." Greyback scrambles to his feet. "I found it in the tent when we came upon these fuckers. It's mine now."
"Listen to yourself." Granger shakes her head. "And besides... Malfoy is right. It is only fair... the way it is," she adds reluctantly, "it is just."
I couldn't think at all, because my cock throbbed deep inside his body, and I came, hard, and for a moment forgot about everything, even about him beneath me. We went still... Until he shifted and turned his head. I moved to pull out, but he pressed his palm into my arse. "No. Stay still. I want to feel you."
"Oh, shut up!" I said loudly into the dark room, then hugged the pillow and wept under the assault of memories.
Through my eyelashes, I watch him picking his clothes up, strong lines of his body bending in a graceful arc. Even drunk, half asleep, without glasses, I see he is beautiful.
My face is hot. My palms are prickling, and I feel the urge to run my hand through my hair. Although our suits are almost identical, I most certainly look like a simpleton, compared to his elegant grace. He looks at me, but
His hand finds mine and gives it a faint squeeze. My head is so heavy. I put it on his chest and close my eyes, listening to the drum of his life under my ear.
”Yes, why not?" I reply. “It will be in the Common Room downstairs, it's not like I could avoid it anyway.”
"That may bring out the beauty of this place, and help it get rid of the old stuff that no longer serves it right." I glare at Potter, lest he blurt something stupid again.
"We should try your Patronus again." His words are hot against my stomach. "Can't wait to test this batch"
"Okay," he says warily, gingerly sitting down at the foot of the bed, his silhouette outlined against the greying window.
"You should have." She nudged me with her shoulder. "It would've been fine, we wouldn't have been so miserable all this time. I felt something was wrong, but didn’t know what it was."
How is Malfoy feeling right now about the whole thing? Why had he agreed to play in the first place?
"Nothing." I sit up, reaching for the bottle. There's no glass, I take a swig, aching inside and out. Good.
- happened to be its Master without knowing it, until Harry disarmed me and the wand's allegiance...
After the night spent on the sofa, I got up tired but feeling as brilliant as I haven't felt in ages. There were people in the Common Room, going for breakfast, giving us looks, but no one said anything.
"Is it a compliment?" My laugh faltered. You were so impossibly tight, I didn't know how I would last.
He pardoned your father; he said you succeeded in your task. He thinks you are dead, he thinks Dumbledore killed you."
He grips me, clutching, reeling, we almost fall when Mother puts her arms around us both. All this time I thought about Mother. I missed her the most and him – very little. He clutches at me, and I feel myself a little boy. Father. My Father – tall and proud and strong. Now I know I missed him, I know I longed for him, too.
"We got attacked at the wedding," Potter replies, "there's a Trace on me. We have to stay here for the time being.
"I don't know, maybe... er... probably yes. Eventually, we might." He looks at me, surprised at the sudden change of topic. "How do you know?"
I haven't seen my parents among the Death Eaters we were fighting. I don't see them among the dead. That means... that could mean anything, really... Slowly, I make my way along the wall.
When you obeyed, he closed the metal bracelet around it with a click, waving his wand several times around your wrist. He didn't have to tell you what it was. By the dull numb feeling starting in your very core, by the way it was spreading down your limbs, dimming the brightness of the world around you, you already knew.
For a moment, we stared at each other. You tried to throw my hand off. I dug my thumb into your collarbone and didn't let go.
From our side, I look across the Great Hall, at the dark crowd ready to pounce as one monstrous beast... and among them a glimpse of white... two bright blond heads next to each other, turning, searching, looking around, peering into our side. I take a half a step back. I won't think about it just yet.
I hear him rising up from the armchair, the whisper of his footsteps over the carpet, first his perfume approaches, and then he takes the tie out of my hand.
My whole body trembles faintly from standing upright for so long, or maybe it's out of fear of the Dark Lord, or perhaps because I haven't eaten all day... and Harry –
He pulls my boxers down and stands up. I feel his erection against my belly. I want to touch it, but I'm still shy. He takes my hand, leading me to the bed.
he would die?" I say dumbly. I am still standing by the door - by the wall where the door should be. Suddenly tired, I approach the bed and sit down.
The next morning, when your Father summoned you straight out of bed, you knew immediately that something was wrong. How terribly wrong, however, you realised only upon seeing his face.
"They held him captive," Mother says, "all this time. Look at him, they starved him and beat him." She points at the fresh bruises Greyback left on my face.
"Er... would we just... sit?" I gestured to the fireplace. "Or..." I waved at the staircase, not sure what I was going to suggest. Or what?
I know he hates being excluded, hates that we never tell him anything of our plans. But it's the way things are, I cannot help it.
It snuggles a tad tighter across my chest and shoulders, tighter than I'm used to wearing my own things - barely nothing, we’re almost the same. The thought is warm. I tug at the collar, pulling it up over my nose and rub my face in it, breathing his smell in, revelling in the touch. My hands reach down to tug my pants off. I discard them on the carpet and climb into bed, switching off the bedside lamp. Only the faint glow of the fireplace remains.
I know now, I'm able to take this route by myself. I put my foot on the first step, and then we fall back into our brisk pace.
he said he wouldn’t. I turn my head, and my vision blurs; there are a lot of people here. The Entire Eighth year. The task is impossible to remember and count them all; I'm too tipsy.
"You are mistaken." Father looks me in the eyes. His gaze is impossibly bright, icy-blue. Even Azkaban hadn't managed to fade its vivid colour. "Both of those things can be changed.  By refusing to deal with the former, you leave me no choice, Draco. I am ready to do what has to be done. Are you sure you are ready to deal with the consequences?"
There's something subtly familiar about his manner or voice, you are not sure. Something long forgotten, barely there, but
I take him by the arm, and we wade up to the castle. Only then does a sudden memory strike me. Well, not a memory - but rather a dream…
Dodging the Bludger, Theodore Nott flashes past me, clinging so closely to his broom that his broad back in the blue Puddlemere United T-shirt is the only recognisable part of him.
I mean, I can take a peek once he isn't home... and I'm curious, I must admit. But I won't. I think if I visited his room in his absence, Potter would know instantly. I don't know how, but I have a feeling that he would.
Did she touch it, too, while he was asleep? Following her into the hall, your thoughts were oddly detached. Did she trace her fingertips over the slender lines of the flower the same way you did?
You would straddle me and kiss every inch of my skin and slide your palms up my chest. You'd ride me with excruciating slowness, rocking, rocking until I saw stars.
My fingers close around the locket as I withdraw my hand out of the backpack to peer at it. It's beautiful: a dull gleam of gold and the dainty Slytherin
to read. I just don't read." I shrugged. "I never have time, and when I do, there are plenty of things far more fascinating than reading."
“Okay.” I stand up, putting my book into my bag. Then I remember something. “Even if it so happens that two people have identical Patronuses?”
Thick, content with hot mid-afternoon fatigue, your voice tells me that's not what you actually mean. You are lazy and tired, and we probably shouldn't lie in the sun like this...
"No, I opened the Chamber of Secrets." Harry pulls Granger behind his back. "It's basically the same, I reckon. It's a Slytherin locket. Stay where you are. Ron, on the count of three! Be ready. As soon as it opens
he used against you not so long ago. The one that killed that very part of him in you. We believe that - hmmm - the Horcrux in your head had meddled with your brain and the nerve-endings throughout those years, and its removal may have caused damage to your eyes."
"Why so dull, Potter?" He hissed, once I couldn't be arsed to react to his remark about my poor potions skills. "The only thing that's still fun is making fun of
She is small, the top of her head barely reaches your chin. She is tilting her face up to meet your eyes. She is funny and smart, and very pretty. She's a lesbian, 17, carted off by her parents to this place.
Slowly, I head along the long tables pushed against the walls. People are sitting, lying everywhere. Tending to their wounds, eating, staring into space. I see Seamus take a swig from the bottle of Firewhisky and hand it to Dean.
"Shut up and follow me." Potter bends down to rummage on the floor and straightens up again, holding something in his hands.
"I'm only logical and notice things that others tend to overlook, and now..." Granger was bouncing in her seat.
"I had to check first." He nods, standing up. "Had to make sure you were being held there against your will."
, that makes me think of his stubbled jaw and glasses, his broad hands, refolding the napkin... of something strong and confident, something that makes me want to let go and stop worrying and just
I settle to wait, checking the box every now and then. Nothing. Here I am again: hanging on the thin thread of hope, ending up right where I'd begun. Ready to sit and wait as long as it takes, and exchange everything for a word from someone who isn't entirely real. And I thought I'd got over it. I promise myself that this time, if he doesn't write back, I'll get rid of the box and set myself free.
"I actually did." I replied. That's when I remembered Hermione's hints that there was this new colleague of hers, about to take a vacancy in St.Mungo's and move to London, and
I struggle to breathe, I don't want to breathe ever again, and surety is spreading through me like terror. Because he doesn't agree, he refuses, he
“I think…” He takes me by the arm. “Maybe you should try and start using your magic? Wandlessly? Simple spells?” We head up the hill, back to the castle. “Maybe it all comes to that?”
"I really think you should cut your hair." I look at his face, and look and look, and can't get enough.
I tug at his belt buckle, unfastening it, and jerk his jeans and pants down in one movement; his cock springs out.
"Good." I exhale. I'm so tired. "Otherwise... my Mother... you know-" I want to cry, and I'm not ashamed to cry in front of him, not anymore. But somehow I can't. It feels as though I don't have any tears left.
“Luck, Potter.  You’ll need it.” Draco said before turning to walk down the hall slowly, as though half of him wished Harry would come after him.
Dumbledore fell silent again and Harry could tell by the look on his face that there was a deep sadness underneath.  The same he, himself, felt for Draco being put in such a terrible position.
He was lying.  Totally lying.  But he wanted to do anything to cling to some part of having Harry in his life.
"Everyone talks, things filter around.  The poor care of The Boy Who Lived is definitely something that makes it from ear to ear."
Draco raised his head to look at Harry, taking in his response for just a few moments, absorbing it, parsing it for any underlying issue, then shifted to throw his arms around Harry's shoulders.
Harry smiled a bit and then silence fell between them.  Draco turned to look over at his owl who was now grooming rather heavily, as though he knew he was going to be needed for something important.
"You felt bad about that?  About being chosen as a Champion?"  Draco asked in surprise, moving to sit on the edge of the  window they'd been looking out.
Draco frowned, processing all this new information about both Harry and Dumbledore.  He'd spent most of his time sure Harry was always being kept in the loop.  Anything from concrete fact to rumours 'just in case' so he could always be alert and be prepared.  To know he wasn't....
He'd hugged Hermione before.  Ron, too, once or twice.  But just short sort of hugs that had patting on the back involved.  Friendly hugs that you gave to your friends.
He did think, though, as he ducked through the portrait hole, he might actually prefer whatever conversation was to be had in Slytherin that night.
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
Harry sounded so sorry.  So apologetic and so lost that it made Draco's chest ache.  He swallowed hard a few times, clearing his throat to try and keep his voice from sounding thick and tight.
“Mm..”  Draco nodded his head, turning his eyes down as he thanked him, taking the box and leaving again quickly.
But what bothers Harry more than anything else is knowing that nothing he does right now is truly private....
"No sir.  I don't think he would have really tried to stop me, but he feels so guilty about anything having to do with you.  I think it will be hard for him to hear you're helping him..."
The elf appears with a pop. "Harry Potter! My friend!" He squeaks, taking off his ridiculous hat in greeting.
your Father used to say, sneering at the word, "is a Muggle way of explaining Magic. Initial knowledge and understanding of things is what separates
"It's a long story," Weasley begins, "we were camping in the Forest of Dean - so Hermione told me -" He heads to the sword and picks it up. I turn to face them and sit cross-legged on the ground.
There are all the Slytherins, Dean, Neville and Susan, a bit of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Hermione, however, is in the armchair with Ron on the floor at her feet.
Malfoy, however, is snooping around my room. I don't particularly mind. Though I cannot discern his shape, now my eyes are aware of the warm golden glow of lamps and fireplace, and it’s more than nothing. Better, really.
"Protective spells!" Granger goes on and on, around the clearing, repeating the spells over and over, making the air shimmer and shift.
"Not here," he says as we reach the door of the Great Hall. "I thought, we could discuss it in the library tonight. It's about our potions project."
Bella has always been suspicious. Of everyone and everything. She's recently grown jealous of Severus and the role I gave him, jealous of the place he's earned by my side. However, it won't do to dismiss even the tiniest thing.
I almost laughed out loud. Because, indeed, I was checking on the box during class, hiding behind a huge cauldron on the table in front of me.
"We should go there!" He sits up and falls back with a grunt, as the fabric of the sleeping bag yanks him back.
I've brought him food because people must eat to stay alive, even if they are Malfoy, I reckon. But I don't really care if he eats it or not, if he lives or dies... except that I do. If he dies, I die, as long as my debt stands.
We haven't spoken with him for a while, certainly not after all this gay business with the Prophet. I've been avoiding him for some reason, probably wary that he would mock me or pass remarks. You just don't go hang out with Slytherins after being outed to the entire world by the one of them, right? Now I'm surprised and unexpectedly glad to see him, realising that maybe I even missed his company a bit.
A sea of heat and red and death, eating, consuming everything around. The stench of smoke throws me into a fit of coughing, and I realise that the Vanishing Cabinet is probably gone by now. No, I must get Harry out of here... But Harry is away, and I'm going to die, Harry is not here... I fall on my knees between Crabbe and Goyle.
I should be relieved that my Father lives, but the only thing I feel is despair. He is forever lost to me. Azkaban will turn him into someone else, someone I wouldn’t know anymore.
I wash the soap off my chest and shoulders, sudsy water soaking through my pants. I need to wash it out. Fuck. Turning my back to Malfoy, I reach under the waistband, trying to make sure there’s no soap there.
and I am no longer a part of it. Sometimes I feel like... an outcast. It's stupid, I know, but..." He trails off.
"Dear friends," Mr. Vice says into the microphone, "do forgive us this little inconvenience. Please enjoy your evening!"
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m already putting the jumper on over my head. With a sigh, I caress the fabric, my palms spreading it over my bare skin. Down over my stomach - it covers my hipbones and lower belly, he's a bit taller than me - down my sides and the small of my back.
Mother. I try to will the thoughts of her away. I am afraid of these thoughts. I know I will probably never see her again. As long as I am 'dead', she is safe and so am I. Everyone gains, really, if I am dead.
Wrenching out of Ron’s grip, I stumbled forwards and fell, catching myself on what felt like the edge of Musgrove's desk.
Snape. Sweeping about like a giant bat, he doesn't pay me any attention. He all but gave up the castle to the Carrows.
"Maybe he's right, Hermione." Harry reaches under the collar of his sweater and retrieves his tiny leather pouch. He rummages inside it until the buzzing Snitch flies out and lands into his palm.
"Actually…" he clears his throat. "I spent the entire summer shutting myself up in the library. I avoided the
I catch my breath and grin and nod… and leave her in the middle, heading to take my seat by Seamus's side.
"Fucking stay still, will you?" You dug your fingers into my shoulders, adjusting yourself on my cock.
I am pleasantly tipsy, reclining on the sofa near the fireplace. Firewhisky. Yeah. Seamus's logistics.
I reach into my satchel and retrieve the box. By the look on Malfoy's face, he recognises it, he knows perfectly well what it is.
When it suddenly hits me: nausea rushes up so swiftly, that I barely have time to catch up with what's going on.
We were sitting in the library, where he dragged me to try the spell out. He replaced my notes with the Potions textbook in front of me. "Can you read it?"
He doesn't say all this, but we both know he means it, saying instead: "Are you going to waste this weather?"
"Amortentia." He smirks, looming over me. "Now, don’t worry… you want it, too." He slides his hand into my hair.
, Potter." He touches my arm. "I can't believe it worked. It's working. We'll keep trying until we succeed, until you can see the way you did before."
"I recently couldn't believe it myself," I reply. Receiving praise from Malfoy feels oddly exhilarating and embarrassing at the same time. "So, you collected it?"
I reach down to undo my fly and finally release my aching cock. He gropes in the darkness and finds it, making me jerk. I open his fly with clumsy fingers and slide my hand beneath the waistband of his pants. His stiff cock pushes into my palm. I move it and move it and
And I look, though it's probably not what he means. He called me Draco. "No, I don't think I could call you Black; it’s crazy," he said.
Your face is sunburnt-red, your thick hair - silvery and white and golden - almost reaches your chin. Though I can't see it from here, I know the sunburnt skin on your nose is peeling off, and it drives you bonkers. You pick at it in front of the mirror, unaware of me staring. Unaware that I can barely keep my hands from reaching out, from cupping your face and running my fingers through the bright strands of your hair. I would kiss every inch of your sunburnt face, your temples and your peeling nose, feel the flutter of your eyelashes under my lips.
"I think it's a pureblood thing about you... or maybe because you play the piano, I don't know." He laughs.
"I missed you," you will say into the side of my face, your lips soft against my stubble. "But I can't…
'Golden Snitch' is only several feet away. He wrenches at the handle angrily, slamming the door behind us.
hissing sound he suddenly makes sends chills through my bones. Silence falls, only disturbed by a faint mechanical ticking coming from the locket.
“Just… I don’t know, it’s sort of stupid if you think about it,” he replies. “Isn’t it? My name and all, you know… Cliché. Almost like a peacock.”
She drags me backwards, back and to the right, where we mingle with other students and teachers and people of the Order - with
Heading to the kitchen, you take a bottle of white wine out of the fridge and pour two glasses. Carrying them, you head to the hall and up the staircase, up and up, music growing louder the higher you climb.
“Stirring the contents of the cauldron anti-clockwise for thirty seconds.” His perfume moves closer. “Done.”
"Then you're okay.  I meant 'tell me you're okay' like you aren't mortally wounded or something.  I know that... Not everything is okay."
Harry’s face was right in his, his eyes looking fiery and murderous as both hands were bunched in the front of his robes, holding his hard against the stone wall.
Draco took his phone out of his pocket and showed it to the young man who immediately smiled and nodded.
The next morning as Draco sat down at the table, empty aside from himself and the cup of coffee waiting for him, his owl soared through the window and landed lightly on the table.  One leg held out with another letter, Draco's name on it in Harry's writing.
Harry chuckled softly, slightly uncomfortable with how pleased he was at the faint compliment.  He cleared his throat and spoke normally again, returning back to the original subject.  “Dumbledore has given me the task of trying to get Slughorn's untampered memory from him.”
“Sure you could.” Draco said, his eyes dancing as they met Harry’s.  “I wish you would, actually.  Once again acting against me without true reason.”
“You could have gotten us KILLED.”  The blonde hissed at him, shoving a hand against Harry's chest fairly roughly.  “What is WRONG with you!?”
Chapter Summary - Harry is more than sick of being in the Gryffindor Common room.  More than sick of the people there.  Really sick of Ron and Hermione...  He'd been avoiding being there as much as possible, which put him in the right place at the right time to run into Draco.  It kind of sucks that Draco seems so wary of him... But maybe he could win him over...
One group was for things he absolutely had no idea what they were.  Another was for things he could figure out but was not familiar with, and the last was for things he had seen on television. Once he had everything separated into piles, he sat down on one of the counter stools and started picking things up from the group of things he had no clue about.
"Dumbledore came in.  You thought he was a psychiatrist or something.  But he told you you were a Wizard and could go to Hogwarts.  You told him about the things you could do.  Make animals and people do what you wanted them to do.  You tried to command Dumbledore to tell the truth about why he was there, you thought he was lying."  Harry paused, glancing towards the wardrobe, then back at Tom.  "He set your wardrobe on fire.  Made the things in your box rattle around.  Then pretty much told you to give them back.  You told him you could talk to snakes.  You looked disappointed that he wasn't more impressed."
Neville, it turned out, was relatively undemanding company.  Sure there were topics that they clearly could not touch without things getting weird, but Draco had to admit that that was probably the case with everyone he knew.  Or used to know.
Harry tilted his head to look at it, smiling a little more.  "You didn't pawn it off on Crabbe or Goyle to take for you?"
After awhile Harry started to see their way of thinking.  But then one day, while they discussed it one last time he sighed, running a hand through his hair and rather dismissively said '
That made Harry laugh again and Draco smirked a little more, inside and out.  He did like making him smile and laugh.  It was always a little triumph when he did.
He picked up the pot of chocolate ganache he'd made... Well...  He'd dumped the chocolate into the pot and when it was all melted (and honestly smelled a little burnt) he poked his wand at the side of it, which instantly turned it into perfect ganache...  But he'd MADE it, all the same.  Pouring it into the cauldron, he breathed a sigh of relief, putting the pot down and moving the cake carefully to the edge of his bench.
This time he did look over his shoulder to make sure Harry was walking with him.  He didn't think he could handle any more surprises that night.
He stepped through the doorway into the flat, trying to ignore the eager and expectant faces of the Aurors that had just finished sweeping the place for safety before letting him in.
Draco frowned, dropping his chin a bit as he thought about the word, trying to place it but coming up empty.  He shook his head at the darker haired boy.  "I don't think so.  Another of Dumbledore's riddles?"
“Don’t start what?”  Draco raised one eyebrow, the side of his mouth curving upwards as he looked at the other boy.
"Don't swear, it's so uncouth."  Harry muttered the words but he smiled as he said them, shifting his knees a bit to start moving with more of a rhythm, pulling back just a bit, then arching forward strongly, loving the feel of being so deep inside the blonde.
Something that Harry found admirable.  Another piece of Draco that made him so desperately want to help him.
“Maybe...”  He said, despite how his insides shrieked the contrary to the request.  “But I doubt you'll convince Potter.”
"Ouch...  That's the really long winded version of 'I'm not angry at you, but I am disappointed in you.'"
or any other news from outside, you know. So the library it was. The potions section. If you must know, I experimented, too. I felt like utter shit, and brewing helped me keep myself distracted… kept my mind occupied. That was the only thing I was interested in. I experimented with advanced stuff. So when they offered me brewing batches of simple basic potions for St. Mungo's, I didn't need to think twice. I filled the papers immediately, signing up to fulfil their weekly requests. They're going to send me lists of potions that will have to be done every week. I think I'll be able to deal just fine with Pepperup or, say, Calming Draught or Dreamless Sleep, stuff like that a few times a week after classes."
I am shaking. I don't want to see it; I don't want to watch what happens next. I have to. Potter is living it through my eyes, there's no other way to show him.
We sway in place in the middle of the Entrance Hall. All I ever wanted was to see her again, and now she is here, and... Why then do I feel dead? Why do I struggle not to wail in despair now that I see her?
I pull the blanket up to cover my chest. "I was going against injustice. That's all. You didn't deserve Azkaban like your parents did. I would've done it for anyone." I don't know if it's entirely true, but saying it to his face feels satisfying. "There's no need to thank me as though it were personal."
Your fingers aimlessly tracing the doorframe, you’ll stare back. There will be so much to say, but I won't know how to talk to you anymore.
The beat of your magic in the air swirls up in a whirlwind of pieces of your shattered heart. Your pain is beating through your blood in a rush of violence.
“You’re shaking, are you cold?” He steps close again, probably to peer me into my face. “You aren’t going to pass out on me?”
I don't know what I want. I thought that I do, but I don't. That kiss was an impulse, a driving force, and the momentum is wearing off, leaving only uncertainty and wild tension.
She is right, and everything she says is true... But I don't really care. And at the Manor, at least, I am home.
"Private conversations between patients are not allowed. Everything you say, you say openly for anyone to hear."
I must have been dozing off because I suddenly start at a touch on my shoulder and the rustling of the sleeping bag. Bewildered, I realise that Potter has slipped in behind me and pressed himself flush to my back. But of course, there's only one sleeping bag and it's freezing. Where else would he go?
Malfoy rolls his eyes, pointing his wand at the bottle. The spell sends it spinning on the spot in a blur, and my head is spinning with it. I hold my breath, the mere thought of watching Malfoy doing
I glance to where Malfoy is leaning against the wall with that same haughty expression. Haughty hot. Haughty. Hottie. Hahahaha!.. I take a sip.
I nod. I'm glad. I imagine their strolls in the garden, their arms linked. I imagine Narcissa pouring him tea in the morning in her dainty parlour. For some reason, I imagine them both in fancy embroidered robes, and maybe even I'm not wrong, I don't know. I'm glad, so glad, that he spent all this time only with his mother. That no one else was there, that he didn't talk to other people, that he didn't share himself with someone when I wasn't there with him, when I didn’t know which part of himself he could have given away.
He starts saying something, but I shut him up with a kiss. He lets out a frustrated sound, kissing back, giving in and demanding, as though trying to prove the point. I feel his hand at my nape, holding me in place firmly; the side of his jaw is so smooth under my fingertips, and the faint smell of his cologne is already my favourite thing in the world. It feels so right, so brilliant: his body, his touch, everything. There’s no the faintest doubt: this is what I want.
At a loss, I am staring at the note, feeling such emptiness inside, as though my entire core has been ripped out. My throat hurts, and my face is crumpling. I realise I'm crying only when my glasses blur from the inside.
," he said and shifted beneath me to look between us, “inside.” I still hadn't pulled out. "And you are inside." He reached down and touched his cock - half-hard, resting against his belly.
fulfil them." He slams his mug down into the sink. His voice is calm, but a pissed-off calm. "You're your own person." He heads to the door. "Good night."
"Celario!" Granger moves in front of me, and another portion of space shimmers, hiding her from my view.
It would be easier - for not to have to come out to Ron, for Hermione to do it for me. It’s cowardly maybe, but Hermione offers help, and I take it.
I don't know. However, I don't distrust him completely anymore, this much I can tell. And I see no harm in telling him about the Ministry. It's not like I've told him about Horcruxes or anything.
is a lie." Harry grimaces. "The rest is true." He grabs my hand. This time I'm not swift enough to withdraw.
I’m not really sure… but last night, after our fight with Ron, after I abandoned him and Hermione, I badly needed someone to hold onto, to feel that I wasn't alone, to close my eyes and cling to him and feel safer, even if only a little bit. Malfoy gave me all that, and more. He
"I'm summoning the Dark Lord," Avery says, rolling up his sleeve, "Those three obviously know where Potter is, they'll answer
The next second I straddled him, pressing his shoulders into the back of the sofa. His short laugh turned into a gasp when I was rubbing against him whole. That damned jacket cut into my armpits, so I wrenched it off, throwing it on the floor.
I look at him sideways, at his profile in the mellow light of a garden lamp. With all that talk of kissing, my gaze immediately falls on his mouth. On his full lower lip, on his upper lip, on its precisely cut bow. He is saying something, but I hardly listen, imagining those lips meeting the other lips and
His eyes are dark, his breath urgent, his kisses burning alcohol on my lips. He leans down to lick it off my throat. The empty glass rolls off the sofa, its clatter muffled against the rug.
sake," I can't resist saying. "I was in your mother's debt. A favour for a favour, no more." I feel ugly saying that, but somehow enjoy it, too.
"Dumbledore." Potter studies his hands. "Before... Snape came in and killed him. He made me promise that I would protect you after... after his death. Bring you to safety, and..." He exhales shakily.
Skipping classes, I shut myself in the dorm. When Ron asks me what's going on, I shrug and say that I'm probably falling ill. I can't even begin to explain all this to my friends. And to be honest - I don't even want to.
Weasley complains. At the lack of food, at the ache in his arm, at the cold, at my presence. If not for me, he said more than once, food would have lasted longer.
I said I’m fine - but I’m not, I’m fucking not. A thousand times Ron apologised to me for the same words he said without thinking, and I didn’t care, really.
Once, we were even exchanging letters right in the middle of Double Potions! He started it, having the nerve to write me first. Just because he could.
"So if... sometime... you'd help me to - you know..." He shrugs. "Speak to her, get along with her. Do you think you and I might help each other out?"
"Okay." Gingerly, I take the first step up the staircase, and when my foot touches the stone, we fall into our quick pace again.
In the sudden need of the loo, I stand up and make my way to the door. It's dark in the corridor, someone has turned off the lights. I move, sliding my fingertips along the wall for balance, all the way to the bathroom door. There's a movement nearby, rustling and a sigh and a hiss, and something hitting the wall.
"How so?" He raises his eyebrow. The skin of his forehead wrinkles where the eyebrow is supposed to be. He has no eyebrows.
I don't know what to say to that. There's the thought, nagging at the back of my mind, that if our positions were reversed, I would have probably done just that - thrown him out of my house, not thinking twice. Because it's Potter, and I hate him... or at least I'm supposed to, right?
He gasps, trying to pull away, trying to wrench free... but my arms around his back hold tight. He is tense as a string, ready to snap any second.
I shook my head. It was so awkward, so many things had happened, wild things he'd been a part of. A lot of them I'd still want to go differently or not to happen at all, but some of them - certain things in particular - I would have never changed.
I could probably try and evoke the memory I lied about. The one with Ron and Hermione right after the defeat of Voldemort. But I doubt it would be enough to cast my Patronus at all. Probably because I know now what happened to me next. It's no longer a happy memory.
I didn't know what that meant, not really. The only thing that was clear to me was that it was not the kind of
Zabini shakes his head and walks away, leaving me alone in the middle of the field with a tiny box in my palm.
The mere notion is ridiculous as I'm thinking about it. But I definitely don't like to imagine Potter being kissed by Weasley's sister. I look away.
"Here, dude." He catches my hand, pulling me down to sit on the cushion. "That was hella hot, Harry."
Things have been going just fine, up to the point when we took our clothes off... And then - not so much. It just wasn't going anywhere, and I could do nothing about it. I don't think I can give her what she expects me to; I can't be what she expects me to be. I am already not.
You follow him with your eyes as he disappears indoors, followed closely by Mr. Vice’s assistant Nicholas.
I hate it, I hate them. I want to shout and stomp my feet. To say that I don't need to be treated any differently. To say that I don't need their pity, their coddling, their carefully chosen way of putting words; that I'm sick of it, that it would be better if they didn't bring it up all the time, that I would be happy just to be left the fuck alone.
"No, I just can tell day from night, I suppose." Moving forward, I reach out with my hand. "Before, it was always dark, just black." My fingers brush against
Bringing the flute to your lips, you will finally see me. All the way across the vast ballroom. My heart will drop. You will raise the glass in my direction in a show of a deliberate salute, throwing all the memories back at me like a swirl of autumn leaves. Haunting, beautiful, useless. Dead. A whisper, a touch away from turning into dust they belong to.
"You know," I say, "once I was doing this right here." I firm my grip, watching as the swollen head of his cock disappears into my fist to emerge again and repeat. "In this very stall, imagining you doing it."
You must admit, you're having a good time. You always liked dancing, always were good at it, and you do have all the classic ballroom techniques up your sleeve. So when you swirl Ivy effortlessly, she laughs - she's enjoying it, too - and it makes you feel good for the first time in ages.
Water is hot down our shoulders, everything's hot. We are naked before each other for the first time.
It's the bracelet, for the most part. But not entirely. I think something has been broken in me during these last three months... And there was Theo, of course... I don’t want to think about it.
I like to think the water is my lips. I pretend I am the water, clinging to your skin, licking your wrist without shame.
attire, Draco," he says, "if the aim of this meeting is to humiliate me, you have already succeeded."
"I believe you know your way to the Slytherin Common Room," she snaps, once we descend the steps. "Do me a favour." She gestures at the corridor. "I am quite busy at the moment."
"Why would you keep doing nothing, Potter?" He asked me once. "When you could learn as well as anyone."
I'm here for coffee and a toast and a chance to be alone. To savour this moment, to revel in joy, all the way grinning like a loon. I am happy, I'm bringing him breakfast, and I want to be back before he's awake.
"Draco." He is suddenly beside me. I don't know how I’ve missed his approach. I've been waiting, craving for exactly that.
I found myself interested, it finally felt as though there was a purpose. I found myself going everywhere with Malfoy and refusing my friends’ offers to walk me to classes more often than not.
Days pass, we move, wary of staying in the same spot for more than a day, lest someone's eye may break through the protective spells. It is unclear, whether they hold as expected, so better not to take chances.
"Yes. Especially with your dick standing up like that." He touches me, wrapping his hand around the base.
Mumbling under his breath, Kreacher goes to the counter, and I sit at the table, unfolding the newspaper.
Potter puts his hand on Granger's shoulder and steps forward. Frowning, he reaches out to grip my wrist and
"Draco worked hard, there were high chances of him succeeding without my help. But should he have failed, the Vow would urge me to accomplish his task, hence your plan would prevail either way." Severus bows.
"Your father wasn't home. She assured me she's fine. She said he'd been asking questions, but otherwise hasn't attempted to harm her in any way. But I'm still not sure she's safe in the Manor."
"You see," he continues, "you are undoubtedly aware, that the Manor and our entire family fortune were meant to be yours one day. But considering your current refusal to fix your unfortunate condition that dishonours the Malfoy name...
"I saw you on the porch... and Yaxley, then you disappeared," I explain hastily, "the coin grew hot in my pocket, I touched it and it brought me here."
[6] – monologue of the Horcrux addressing Ron Weasley, from “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” by J.K. Rowling
My hands are trembling, and so would my voice if I spoke, my face growing hot. I could have turned back and hide in my room, calm down and prepare myself to face it, but I've already reached the door of the Great Hall. There are people behind me, and turning back now would only make everything worse.
I don't want him to leave just yet because, for the first time in who knows how long, I've had a conversation with someone that wasn't all about my
myself against him. His kisses are sloppy; he touches me through my jeans and instantly snatches his hand away. I grind down to let him know that it's okay. He grabs my waist and pulls me
"You're enough the way you are," he continues, his voice distant. "But for you it's not enough, it makes all the difference to
It's been two weeks, and it seems it will never be over. Never enough. I move through a haze. Because all this can't be possibly happening to
what's the matter with me? I'm stammering. I'm suddenly uncertain. It felt brilliant when I'd been doing it this morning  sitting in the attic on my own. Now, it seems far-fetched and stupid and...
Azkaban had changed him. Painfully thin, with his grey hair cropped short and gaunt features, he looked so frail that if it were anyone else but your Father, the only thing you could have felt towards this man would be pity. Why, then, was his mere presence sending your heart racing? Where did this fear even come from? But there you were: on your tiptoes, feeling eleven again, seeking his approval.
"I thought the same about you and Parkinson. Although you two behave like utter weirdos... You suit each other."
hungry, dangerous. Holding my gaze, he wrenches at his belt and unbuttons his flies, pushing his jeans down in one swift movement. Went he straightens up, with a jolt I realise that he's removed his pants, too. I gape at his nakedness, at his hard cock standing forward, at the locket gleaming golden against his chest.
He spied on me copying my letters before sending them to Noir, as I always do, to keep our entire dialogue. I usually do it in the library alone, to avoid Ron asking questions.
Kreacher takes one of the vials from my palm, there's a soft pop. "Here, Master." Cold glass presses against my lips.
there's skin and a scratch of stubble and softness of lips. I jerk away. "Sorry… and now it's… I can see the light, but nothing else."
His mind welcomes me, embraces me and rocks like the deepest waters of the dark ocean. He is well-trained and knows better than to resist. He lays everything bare, ripe for the taking.
The strap of my satchel pressed down over my shoulder as he adjusted it. I reached out and found the sleeve of his jumper. I wasn't going to link arms with Malfoy, absolutely not, but I needed to hold onto him somehow, right?
Spending most of my time in Muggle London, I keep myself occupied. I resumed my college studies, and things are getting back to normal, but...
"Aha!" Her wand drawn, cackling Alecto Carrow steps down the dais. "The Dark Lord told us you'd come, and here you are."
"Malfoy, do tell us about the Deathly Hallows," Granger says, "it's not like we have any better ideas of what to do."
is the word I've recently allowed myself to think openly about other guys who I find attractive, since... well - since my friendship with Noir started.
I put the note inside and close-open the lid. It passes. I exhale. It has to mean he waits for my reply, even if two weeks have passed since he sent this note.
in such things." Wincing, Father gestured at Michelangelo's David, pictured at the front cover in all his glory. "No wonder where these morbid inclinations come from."
In the darkness, I barely see anything but the side of Potter's head, pressed against mine. His swollen cock is slick and alive. I can easily imagine it - red and dark - as big as I once saw it. His hand is clumsy on me, unsteady, but it is enough. Everything rises to the surface, and I am unable to hold it back. Potter
of the belt buckle, he fumbles with his clothes as the blurred pattern of the sofa fabric is swimming before my eyes. His naked chest on my back weighs me down, a touch of teeth at my nape, I shiver. Good. Just to not see his face.
I was possessed by a fucking Horcrux and witnessed him possessed. I fought him and kissed him and saved his life. I made love to him and let him into my very soul. And now I've lost him.
Eyes wide in disbelief, he turns to me. I don't know why he is surprised. Well, it's true. Last night with him was my first time ever, and
I stride into the hall... No doubt they thought I was deliberately standing there all along, getting off like a pervert. I turn the corner and head down the steps to the basement. When I enter the kitchen, Potter is there at the table with his face crimson and bewildered eyes.
"No physical contact between the patients of the same sex is allowed, with the exception of the briefest of handshakes."
The kitchen door stands open. The room is lit with a soft yellow light from a lamp. There's a big chunk of cheese still wrapped in paper and a bottle of wine. The same thought strikes us both: we step into the kitchen, I grab the bottle and Potter the cheese; with his other hand, he grabs my wrist and Apparates us away.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
With the back of my legs, I push the chair away and rummage over the desk for my satchel. Finding it, I turn to leave, taking a few careful steps forward. Deep down, I expect him to stop me, or at least ask where I'm going, so that I'd refuse to tell him out of spite. He doesn't. Reaching out with my hand, I find the bookshelves to my right and move along, until they end and I step out of the alcove and into the aisle. After a brief hesitation, I take the right turn and head to the exit.
I hold on, basking in the light, filling myself to the brim with the warmth long-forgotten, an embrace of an old friend.
The morning is bright and very cold. But even colder was his gaze when we met in the air after the whistle blew. After that he hasn't looked at me even once.
"Yes," you replied, though it was not a question, and dropped your hand from her shoulder. "I'm sorry." You didn’t know what urged you to apologise.
"Fuck, Potter..." I stand up, tugging at the front; it's damp, and I feel the T-shirt underneath is soaked through as well.
I cover my ears with my hands and press hard to block out his screams. In silence, as though in slow motion, I watch Weasley's father approaching, and his sister, and Weasley himself with Granger by his side. He drops her hand and stumbles forward, his mouth open wide...
. To the tiniest things, signs, sensations. To the whisper of the breeze and it's direction. To the talk of trees in the distance. To the air cooling down on my skin, telling me the sun is gone, telling me it's getting late.
"I get it..." he says, "me too." Still holding my hand, he doesn't look at me. "I had no idea Pans was going to do it, until she dragged me to you."
"Following my orders, Draco is doing an important task in the Room of Requirement. I want you to leave him alone and not try to find out what that task is. You must not interfere. You mustn’t. It is essential."
His back arching, Weasley thrashes on the ground, his head lolling back in the heap of the autumn leaves. The inhuman sounds filling the air come from his throat, and his arm...
"So I found out your mother’s address... and went there, but she said you were out here. She also said it's your birthday."
The door of the Great Hall bursts open, and people flood in. They are not students, they are adults. I see Lupin and a woman with short purple hair, a tall black man and the Weasley twins, more and more of them coming in.
"I'm not blind." I shrug. "Or deaf, or stupid. I notice things." Not looking at him, I fiddle with my wand. "You’re going to leave me behind."
It's dark, and I'm in my bed, fully dressed, even with my boots on. I feel disgusting, and I have a boner, a huge boner from the dream about Malfoy-Noir.
It still might be a trap. I don’t think I can trust him. What if the Dark Lord himself has set it all up?
hair. Malfoy whines and curses and manages to flip me on my stomach, straddling my arse. He grips a fistful of my hair, wrenching my head back with such force that my neck cracks. I cry out in pain. With his free hand, Malfoy reaches under my chest and finds the locket; he wrenches at it until the chain snaps. He hurls it into the cave, and I hear it crash into the wall.
Weasley got on his feet. “He’s right, I'm leaving." He strode to the bunk and grabbed his bag. "Are you staying, or are you going with me?" He turned to Granger.
"Not the same, no," I agree, "but otherwise we would've never met. And I wouldn't want that to happen."
A sound wakes me, I open my eyes. It is dark, only a thin trail of light spilling from under the bathroom door.
At the Manor, I kept it with me all the time but never dared to use it. I didn't know where Harry might be and whether my arrival would do him more harm than good; and anyway, my parents would be punished for my escape - I couldn't let that happen. Now, all I have to do is clutch the coin in my palm, think of Harry and Apparate. So I do, expecting a tug and a swirl, bracing myself for the unsettling disorientation and vertigo that always come with Apparition.
She's wrong, but I can't prove it. Not to these two. Whatever I might have said or done would never be enough. And they don't even know yet I've got the Mark on my forearm.
I picture Potter's face as I know it: laughing, grinning at me... I picture him serious... and calm... and bewildered... different... I remember his face very close to me in the darkness, when we fell asleep together, holding hands... I imagine his face as I've never seen it - very close, leaning in for a kiss.
The next moment, a spell hits in the middle of the Death Eaters mob, and chaos erupts. Both crowds rush at one another, bellowing, firing curses back and forth.
As long as this thing is around your wrist, your Father knows your whereabouts. As long as the bracelet is there, you are as good as a Squib.
Potter fills his glass and puts the bottle down onto the floor. He raises his glass briefly, not in a toast, but as though in an afterthought, then throws his head back and swallows the contents in one go.
Now, in the morning light, I am anxious. I don't regret what we've done, but I don't know how to face him.
Finally done with the belt, I sit on the bed and bend down to find my shoes. I put them on and fumble with the laces. Will do. I reach for the pile and pick a tie up. Shit. I hold it in my hand.
The rest of the day we avoid each other. Potter lies in the sun, toying with his snitch, and I deliberately don't look in his direction. But I can't stop imagining him naked. Thin and wiry, lithe muscles rippling alive under his skin as he stepped into the water. His slim strong thighs and prominent calves. The round globes of his small arse as he moved... and his dick,
"I have heard so much about you." His deep voice was barely laced with accent, an undertone still hinted that English wasn't his mother tongue. I was enchanted.
"No, my boy. From now on, you should try and do your best to make it work. It is essential that you succeed."
I imagine Malfoy soaping himself up with the tiny soap bar from the crate in the Quidditch locker room showers. Sudsy rivulets slide over his nipples, making a path in the middle of his chest, down his stomach, over his tiny navel, to finally gather in the coarse hair at the base of his cock. He is hard, he smears the lather along his length. And repeats. I think he's washing himself, but no… his palm is sliding back and forth in a different rhythm. Bracing his other hand against the wall, he thrusts into his fist, making the swollen head meet the resistance of his curled thumb, breaching it each time and withdrawing, to repeat the torture over and over again. I stare. I want to take the tip into my mouth. To let him thrust between my lips, to make a firm 'O' of my mouth into a perfect path for his pleasure. Under the steady strokes of his hand, water is washing the soap off. I want to press my tongue to the pulse point on his rigid neck. I want to slide my arm around his waist, nestling my erection between his buttocks, and take him in my own hand. To touch him and
"It's... nothing...it's just a..." He looks down. "Nothing needs to happen." His voice is a bit unsteady. "Do whatever you want... or you may do nothing at all."
"You don't need the key. You are neither allowed to invite anyone to your room, nor visit other patients' rooms here. Rules."
"I have to leave now... for the Ministry... for work. You may... you know..." He gestures with his hand. "Eat... take a bath... and such. If you need anything, ask Kreacher." He scratches his nose. "I mean, if you want... anyway, see you in the evening." He grabs a handful of Floo Powder from the jar on the mantle.
"I'm not sure yet. Probably your Patronus wasn't powerful enough to… I mean, the memory you chose wasn't enough to sustain a Patronus sufficient for…" He exhales. "Fuck."
You know your Father. He would have sent you there even without Theo’s story. You were gay, and you had to be cured.
I'm hurrying down the staircase, all the way to the basement to press the largest pear on the painting next to the Hufflepuff Common Room.
He had no idea what it meant to me - his blind acceptance. If Ron stood by me, I could do anything, anything at all.
For a wild moment I still thought I was looking at you. The same shaped eyebrows on a clear smooth forehead, the same delicate cheekbones, aquiline nose.. the same precisely cut bow of lips. It was
"It's here." He shows us the Snitch. "The Stone. Now I’m sure it's here. Dumbledore hid it inside; why else would he leave me the fucking
"I think..." He shrugs, and there's this dreamy note about his voice. Terror grips me. "Maybe in the pouch...
"Kreacher bring what Master Malfoy ask," the elf says, putting the set of charcoal crayons and a stack of paper on the table.
A man comes forward. A tall blond man with limp long hair. I squint at him. He comes forward from the
"But in a lot of things I haven't...” I drop his sleeve. "Look, Malfoy... I don't want things to get back to shitty." I wave between us. "I’ve fucked up, but I'm sorry."
Next morning, Malfoy comes to pick me up as usual. We never mention the party or the kiss again, though I think about it all the time. Not about Romilda or Susan or anyone, though with them it was great.
"However, your mere presence here shows your effort and willingness to right the wrongs you did to Draco."
With his dirty face and hair, in stained clothes and kneeling on the floor, he looks so miserable, that I suddenly realise I feel sorry for him and his mother. Can't bring myself to care for Lucius, though.
You could tell he was staring. You didn't need to look. You never missed the electric touch of his gaze, the prickling it sent over your skin each time he secretly watched you. You cherished it in silence, holding close to your heart this secret joy, this knowledge—or maybe hope?—that there was a reason behind his stolen glances. You never told him, never let him know, lest he denied it, taking it away from you.
I immediately think that he is good-looking, that he's actually very nice: funny, smart and creative, decent and easy to be around. Although we've never been close, never talked much, and Dean hardly ever occupied my thoughts before, I like him a lot, I can easily see him writing me all those letters. I would be happy to find out that Dean is Noir.
"Harry, what are you going to do, then? Shut yourself up in this house? At Hogwarts, you'd be amongst
When I finally reach Granger, she is sitting motionless, staring into space. I step in front of her, but she looks right through me.
The lantern will light up on the wall, and the door will creak on its hinges, its sound making me finally turn my head…
for fucking him over like that. How dumb you can be for doing what you'd done? Calling him out to meet you in front of all these people! And when he comes, humiliating him even more, refusing to see what's under your nose!"
"I don't give a shit about classes." Now I have to sit up to conceal my erection. "I'm not going anywhere."
I look up. He looms over me, his bewildered face streaked with tears. I take his hand and let him help me on my feet. "Thank you." I let go of his hand and look around. "Did you?.."
Uncertainly, like a guest - a stranger - I will walk through the gloomy entrance hall and look around: the grand staircase, the living room, the heavy wooden library door, the stone steps to the kitchen in the basement… It will feel as though this year hasn't happened, as though I never left, as though you may throw the library door open any moment to meet me with that easy smile of yours -
By the end of the third week, I am cleared of all charges, and Theo is sentenced to one year in Azkaban.
He gives me an odd look. "We have to guard it; it won't do if it just lies around. It may get lost again."
When the alarm goes off in the morning, I ignore it, pulling the blanket over my head. Fuck it. I'm not going anywhere.
"I'm not denying it!" Malfoy grunts. "I enjoyed it. No less than you enjoyed snogging a half of our year on Halloween!"
"What?" I begin to stand up when people flood the tent, and I find myself knocked down, with my face pressed into the floor.
"Ron got splinched when we escaped Yaxley," he says, chewing. His voice is brusque, and he looks down at his sandwich, avoiding my eyes.
I take his hand again; he says nothing, following me all the way to the inner courtyard dimly lit with the Christmas decorations. The fountain in the centre is running merrily, and the falling snow doesn't quite reach the glowing surface of a giant Warming Charm, which encloses everything in the protective sphere. There's no one here, and the place is quiet, though music swims in from the doorway. I lead him to the small bench behind the Christmas tree.
Arms lock around my shoulders from behind, squeezing me tight. I try to wrench free, but he is strong.
He'd made a Vow, he said. It had almost killed him when Potter slashed me open in the bathroom. He almost didn't have any time left, he said. If he hadn't found me, we would both be dead.
wouldn't do that. If anything, he is bound to protect me for his own safety. I'd like to think that Potter wouldn't abandon me now, even without the bond, but that's probably too much to wish for. Don't be ridiculous, Malfoy.
I knew - we both knew - Gin would never do that to me, would never stay with me out of pity. I loved her so much for that. And for other things, too. But not like that.
"It's her birthday, mate. I need something special, and… y'know—” Ron faltered, asking for your help this morning.
He helps me to my feet and leads me by the hand into the cave. There he picks up the locket and tucks it into the inner pocket of my backpack. When he finally comes up to me, I'm leaning against the wall. I feel foul and dirty and cold. So cold.
Studying your hands, you said nothing. What could you possibly have said? Let alone admit that you’d never
After the shower, I went to bed and tossed and turned for a long time. When I'd finally begun to doze off, the door opened quietly, letting in a thin trail of light from the corridor.
I think about Malfoy's tentative peck, his body even not touching mine. About his palms - steady and gentle - holding my face, tilting it up just so. About his smell assaulting my senses, about my helpless stupor and wild heart. I even briefly regret I didn't kiss him back. Well, that's fucked up. He wouldn't want that.
telling him something with that leering smile that annoys me to no end. It's only when she places her hand on his shoulder, pressing her lips to the side of his face, his head suddenly snaps up to look directly at me across the tables. Automatically I lean into Gin by my side, placing my palm on her shoulder. I don't know what we are playing at... but when she turns to me in question, I shoot a glance at Malfoy and kiss her on the lips. I’m satisfied that he sees.
"At least you can stand, which means your spine is not broken." I put his arm over my shoulder. "Lean on me."
The sound of the pewter lid dropping into place is suddenly deafening as it cuts the smells off. Next to me, Malfoy exhales shakily.
“Yeah, give me a sec.” He drops my hand, and his footsteps retreat, only to turn back in a moment. “Here.” He presses the gloves into my palm.
The dinner is excellent, but I am so wound up, I barely eat. So is Potter. We drink, exchanging glances over the table. Kreacher is the one talking. All this is surreal.
"You need to let Death Eaters inside Hogwarts, as is required of you, and leave the rest to me," he said.
"Luckily, she can't." He pecked you on the lips. "Are you sure you don't want to come? Her invitation always stands—"
"It doesn't matter that Harry's gone!" Longbottom begins. "People die every day. Friends, family... Yeah, we lost Harry tonight, but he's still with us,
I unbutton my shirt and take it off, and when my wrist catches in the cuff, I swear and wrench it off, hurling it on the floor. I want to hit something.
Potter almost spilled my entrails out on the floor and nearly killed me, Weasley, and now he bears the consequences."
The murmur of voices is buzzing around the room. I crane my neck and see that there are a lot of people here. Every bed in the room is occupied. There are visitors here and there; house-elves are helping Pomfrey tend to the patients.
Music is deafening, and my head is swimming, and people are moving around in flashes of colour; but the only one I see clearly is Malfoy. A black figurine in the middle of the motley crowd, he is wiping Parkinson's scarlet lipstick off his lips and chin, grinning down at his red stained fingers. All I can see is him.
to get it over with sooner. Or to not send it at all; or to send it in a year. I don't know. Anything to calm the fuck down a bit.
"Okay... whatever, mate," Ron said, bewildered. He didn't mind that much, but apparently his friendship with Malfoy will never happen.
"You've changed your clothes," you said dumbly, staring at the dark trail of hair that ran down from his navel to that place where his cock stood out, bobbing in front of him as he walked.
I enter the kitchen. Potter, in the dark blue uniform of an Auror, is kneeling in front of the fireplace. He turns at the sound of my footsteps.
You fucked me furiously into the mattress, the weight of your body on my back holding me down. I let you.
"Oh, nothing's wrong." Turning away, I stuffed my hands in my pockets. "Except that you prefer to spend your time with your books rather than me every time you’re here."
“I should have forbidden you to indulge in this weird fascination of yours in the Muggle arts and literature that had proved to be
"What are you waiting for?!" Rings a voice, a familiar voice. I scramble on my feet. "Someone grab him!" [13]
I am sitting at the piano, and he's polishing the lid with a soft cloth. Ever since I began to play, he's been keen on keeping the instrument clean.
[13] – Pansy Parkinson, urging everyone to give Harry Potter up to Voldemort, from “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” by J.K. Rowling.
He didn’t approach me here, as I didn’t think he would, and now I have no clue how to find him among this mayhem. I would like to find him, to say hey and offer him a drink. Why not? I’m sure he wouldn’t refuse Firewhisky…
"Kreacher see things, Kreacher know. Master don't say, but Kreacher know. Master like his guest, and Master like his guest play piano."
“Harry!” He claps me on the shoulder. “Here, sit down, mate.” His hand takes mine, pulling me down on the sofa next to him. Hermione snuggles at my other side.
"Come on." You gripped the stone parapet and, to my astonishment, jumped over it, landing on the gravel path beneath.
He laughed, pulling me away from the door. "I felt awful, having to give myself away in front of all those people. I was jealous and…"
He waves at the Death Eaters behind him and the mob cheers. His face stony, my Father claps his hands several times. My Mother beside him doesn't pay any attention, her eyes never ceasing to roam over our side... until she spots me and flinches, grabs my Father's arm and leans in to whisper into his ear.
It's Sunday, thank Merlin. I sleep through half the day. Gin left me "to recuperate," she’d said, and Ron is nowhere to be seen.
painted with a shimmering silvery stuff. It’s glittering, reflecting lights every time he moves his head. It forms a stars pattern across his forehead, around his right eye, snaking down along the neck and chest to disappear beneath the shirt. I don't know how the Draco Constellation looks, but this must be it.
In a flash, Malfoy dives towards the ground, and I'm chasing him before I even fully realise what I'm doing. He's seen the Snitch!
I feel as though being hit across the head. All this suddenly makes disgusting sense... He tried to apologise... That is why he refuses to meet me. Surely, if it's
I will approach the piano again, the image of your fingers before my eyes - strong and delicate - their caress evoking languid sounds from the ancient instrument. The image of your tranquil face, your closed eyes and a ghost of a smile blossoming on your lips will forever stay in my memory.
I drop into the armchair, watching Malfoy sitting back on his heels on the floor. His face lowered, he blinks as though trying to ebb the tears away.
as though he's chosen a spot between my eyes to stare at, to give an impression that he looks at me while he doesn't. I adjust my glasses.
Something had been gone. I'd stuck to Malfoy and had  started spending far less time with my friends. They didn’t object, nor did they interfere. Sometimes there are days we don’t talk to each other at all, it just happens.
I look at him over my shoulder, bright moonlight reflecting off his glasses. He sits with his arms crossed. All the fight leaves me, and now I just feel tired. I walk towards him and sit on the bench.
The cheerfulness of her tone made you look up. She took Father by the arm, pulling him towards the staircase. But there was something about her face, as though she’d shut down everything free and genuine and alive that had been there only a day before. It was exactly how you felt.
"Thank you," I say, "yes, actually... now I should leave Potter's house..." And the words are suddenly heavy in my throat. I'm not sure whether it's because of the house or its Master. I'd better not think about it.
I hurl the paper on the table, vanishing it with a wave of my hand. That's when I remember that I don't have a wand. Father had taken it away from me the evening he'd put his bracelet on my wrist.
His fingers are cool, smooth to the touch, and when they withdraw, I realise my heart is hammering. Malfoy’s never touched me other than to deliver a fist to my guts, or to break my nose, or to clutch at me on the broom over the fire, his shriek deafening in my ears.
“That was a really fucked up way,” he says, “to learn how to produce the essence of happiness. How in hell were you supposed to succeed?”
[11] – Harry Potter’s speech, addressing Severus Snape, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Part 2.
The whistle blows, and I am in the air, staring daggers with Malfoy. Wind is messing up his hair, making it flutter and stand on end above his forehead. The colour is burning high on his cheekbones. He has that odd, a bit feverish look on his face, as though he's over-excited about something, trying not to show it. I don't think I've ever seen him like this.
"No problem," he says and sits up, throwing the blanket off. He's in striped pyjamas bottoms. He gets out of bed and makes a few steps towards me. "Move."
house, Potter. I'm not in the position to... What I'm trying to say, is: I've just had an idea of little improvements - structural and aesthetic ones - which may..." I stop, trying to find the way to put it so that the house won't go bonkers again.
When I open my eyes on Sunday morning to his knock on my door and let him in, I suddenly see his vague shape moving in front of me, approaching through the blur.
I release my grip to cradle his face in my palms, to lean back and look at him, to press my lips to his chin and his eyes and forehead. The feeling of his hands sliding up my back, their reassuring pressure fill me with joy. Enchanted snowflakes are catching in his eyelashes, and there above his shoulder I see a glimpse of Mistletoe. We don't need it.
"Okay, I'd better go lie down." Weasley shakes his head. "Destroying the Horcrux and all that has... you know... tired me out."
"Hurry!" Snape's voice breaks the silence. "Out of here." He moves out of the line of my vision, Bellatrix following.
You didn't know how you felt about it. Father was being released on bail, on a sum huge enough to buy another Manor. The sum, Mother said, had cost almost everything from the Malfoy vaults. It allowed your Father to shorten his term in Azkaban from ten years to four.
, and it does - allowing me in. I've been granted a single room, and McGonagall has done everything to make my accommodations comfortable. I can’t -
Hell if I know what that meant. For a few days, I was jumpy and anxious, expecting his return any minute. He never came back, so eventually, I'd ceased to fret.
"Hermione knows shit," Weasley had told me after the first day in court, "just listen to her and do what you are told...
Anxiety is nagging, not giving me a rest. What will happen when Zabini tells everyone? Is he going to do it soon, or is he planning for the time to pass and for me to calm down before delivering the blow? And when he does, how am I going to handle it? How may it change my relationship with Noir? He said it wouldn't change anything, but I know it would. Once you know a person - the whole person, not only the way they either think or look - it changes everything. For better or for worse, but it always does.
that drives you bonkers," Malfoy sneers, all the softness gone from his face, "the thing that turns you into a fucking
“You all surely expect me to talk about formalities that should be undergone regarding your additional year at Hogwarts, and there is no doubt that I intend to do it later.” McGonagall’s voice rings, clear and strict as usual. “But for now, just let me tell you how happy I am to welcome each and every one of you back to Hogwarts. I want to thank those who, despite everything, decided to return and finish their education this year.”
I open my eyes to the sun spilling between the curtains. To the empty pillow on the other side of the bed. To the dark-brown blanket and the blue armchair, to his shirt hanging off its back.
, broken pieces of glass in fiery liquid rain down off the mantel into the fireplace. The raging flames burst, spitting fire, snaking their bright paths over the rug. When I look up, my reflection is smiling, bending, distorting the liquid surface within its frame. Magic mirrors don’t break. They only laugh and twist and mock you.
I’m great, I’m fucking brilliant! I haven’t wanked in ages, and certainly not in the mornings after the Dreamless Sleep, and
I turn away, too, to take my position at the opposite side of the field and survey the air for the Snitch. It's not an actual game, it's only a training session, but our determination to beat each other is as vicious as ever.
Well, fuck you! It's not. I've been experimenting with this stuff for a while, and now that you came along, you could at least help me test it and not be the totally useless prick that you are."
"Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out." Potter rose on his feet, stuffing his fists in his pockets.
You most definitely should've denied everything, but you hadn’t. Father had caught you off guard. You had a feeling that the main reason why he was so mad at you was that you’d turned out to be a moron who had admitted everything, leaving him with no choice but to deal with this
I had no idea Potter owned a house. “Okay.”  I grabbed my clothes from the armchair and headed to the bathroom to change out of my pyjamas. I dressed as quickly as I could, wary of asking more questions, for they obviously annoyed Potter.
"Wow," was all I could manage. I had lived there for years, but it felt as though I was seeing my own house for the first time.
He spends most of his time with me anyway. What else could I possibly wish for? What else could I possibly want from him? Is his friendship not enough? For me, it should be.
"You are good at it, Malfoy," Weasley says, wiping his greasy fingers at his jeans, "you should do that again when we need food. And I'm going to cook it, 'cause I'm good at it. Harry is the boss, and Hermione is our brains - they are of no use here, they should relax and take a break."
She didn't reply, didn't turn around, and you realised she was looking at the heap of clothes at the foot of the staircase. You watched the heavy spill of shiny dark hair down her back; her tall slender frame, the proud set of her shoulders, unwavering even in defeat. The sleeves of her dress enclosed the delicate length of her arms in grey silk. For a long moment, she stood perfectly still, before bringing her palm to her forehead in a tired gesture, as though trying to gather her scattered thoughts.
I sat with my legs up in the armchair, Potter drank his tea at the table across from Granger, and Weasley lay in his bunk, staring at the ceiling. At some point, he just got up and left the tent.
Potter laughs again, good-natured and a bit tipsy. "If anything, it should be me - a good thief. Dursleys never allowed me to have things; anything of mine, whatever possessions I might have had, were old shabby things my cousin no longer needed, and even so..." He stares into flames. "They never ceased to remind me that nothing I ever had was really mine. They even begrudged me food, so… I don't know how I didn’t grow up a criminal."
Severus, however, knows better than to step into my arms. He stops a few paces away and bows low. "My Lord."
The word 'girlfriend' makes me want to cringe. It's been a week, and I still feel like shit around Ginny.
The double doors of the wardrobe squealed in protest of dislodged hinges as you threw them wide open with a wrench. The first thing that caught your eye was his coat. You ripped it off the hanger, hurling it on the floor where it sagged into a thick black puddle of wool. A sweep of your arm, and several hangers with his shirts were sent flying across the floor. Another jacket—out.
People are turning their heads, pointing in his wake; bewildered noise is rising among the crowd. Hermione covers her mouth with her hand, and Ron rubs at his forehead. Ginny is standing motionless, hugging herself around the middle.
I want to hug them both and tell them how much I love them, how grateful I am that they insisted and dragged me to Hogwarts, despite me being such a dick all the time.
Harry ran his palm over his face. There was something in her manner, something desperate. He knew perfectly well how the case of
The best thing about Kreacher, is that he does exactly as he's told. Literally. And tells exactly what he's doing.
I see Parkinson and Zabini on the landing. He is clad in his Slytherin Quidditch attire for the match. In argument Parkinson pushes him in the chest, and he leans against the railings with his arms crossed.
His unwashed hair is a mess, sticking up at one side where he slept on it. His sharp collarbone stands out in the gap of the collar of his pyjama top, the other one is bandaged. He looks underfed, miserable and ill.
Every time I move in my sleep, I feel his presence. His arm around my chest is warm, stars are flickering beneath my eyelids, and I am happy.
"Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished, in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events... who fails to come forward, will be treated... as... equally guilty." He surveys the crowd. "Come forward."
"Flying with Malfoy? You? How even?" He asked me at first, when I awkwardly offered to come with us.
See people and places as I remember them. See my life - so bright, vivid and real - that awakening to the darkness before my eyes will feel like dying.
"No, I'm taking it now." My hand is already reaching to the bedside table. Fuck it, fuck it all. I'm just gonna take it.
"It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster!" [10]
He is dressed in all black: plain trousers and a shirt open in the middle, halfway down his chest. Well, not plain, as in 'simple.' Because his version of plain is usually called something else, I suppose, like... some fancy word, like...
"I mean..." I realise how it sounds. "My friends would never do that in the first place; they wouldn't find such a thing funny."
Through the open door, I see the retreating backs of the trio hurrying up the main staircase. I follow McGonagall out of the Great Hall and down to the staircase to the dungeons.
There's more. More of them. More of you, more of me. More happiness all over the place in the living room of our home. The home I have just let a stranger in.
You call me by my name now, but every time you do it still feels new. I don't know if I'll ever get used to that. I don't think it will ever be possible to hear the low rumble of
Seeing him for the first time since the trials where I spoke for him and his mother, sparing them from Azkaban, I thought that he'd changed a lot. He arrived at Hogwarts with the rest of the Eighth Year. Keeping his head down, he mostly kept to himself and to Parkinson's company, who was notoriously famous as well.
My heart thudding, I put the reply into the box, closed the lid and peered over my cauldron. I felt the urge to leave my seat. I wanted to wander around the vast classroom in search of that someone, a someone who was fiddling with a tiny box. The entire Eighth Year was present, about sixty of us. He was right there, somewhere, and I had no clue who he was.
had fucked off to dinner without me last night? I knocked on your door, but you weren't there, so I went alone. That's when Astoria--"
I come to my senses kneeling on the floor. When I look around, I realise the Dark Lord didn't speak to
Dashing to the library, I frantically leaf through a huge French thesaurus. Strange, alien words jump on the pages, blurring before my eyes. At first I even skip it in my haste, turning the next page. Finally, here it is:
I watch him with a heavy heart. What are we going to do now? I think he hardly knows that himself. We are alone, without any plan or purpose, and the only two people Potter ever trusted are now lost to him.
"Hi." Releasing Malfoy's arm, I reach out to touch the back of the chair that is put for me next to the bench at the end of the table. "See you, Malfoy," I throw over my shoulder.
You stayed and he left. White shirt and green jacket, ruffled hair and the absence of tie. A whiff of his cologne still lingering in the air even after the sound of his footsteps faded away.
In a search for a bottle, I wheel on the spot and see the stack of your photographs on the flaming table. Untouched.
“Maybe in this, you weren't wrong.” I put my arms through the sleeves and spread the soft fabric down my front and sides.
she is looking at. I stare down at her, at the side of her face in front of me, at her fair locks escaping the loose bun on her nape. Anywhere but at
This morning, after Potter left, Mother had sent her elf with my clothes and some money and stuff. He had lurked on the street, not able to see the house, until Kreacher had noticed him.
"Come, Severus." I beckon. "Come to your Master and be rewarded." I rise from the high chair and step down off the dais.
I want Mother here, want to put my head on her lap and feel safe again. Want to tell her everything, unload this burden and breathe. If she only knew, she would be horrified; she still wouldn't be able to help me. I miss her. I remember Father's face the day he returned from Azkaban. He went there strong and proud and emerged a ruin of a man. Whatever horrors he may have done at the Dark Lord's command, he is my father, and if I fail... I can't fail. I don't have the right.
Dating Gin meant we spent a lot of time together, doing Quidditch, doing nothing, kissing with her sitting on my lap, holding hands in the corridors.
"I have no idea what it is, but I'm not blind. I've seen enough to figure out that you are trapped, alone, and your time is running out," he continues, staring at the lake. "So I say it again: go to Dumbledore before it's too late and tell him everything. Whatever the fuck it is. He'll help you figure it out. He's the only one who can."
"You said I should go to him for help. What did he say? He sent you, surely he told you of his plans?"
I feel a jolt of annoyance and something else, visions of Malfoy and Parkinson fresh in my mind. Malfoy is going to have a snogging session again; seems like his girlfriend doesn't mind. It irritates me for some reason.
Curses are flying, blinding deafening, crashing down on my head. I duck and run and cast and block. I understand nothing anymore. I am not even sure I can tell
“Expecto Patronum!” Again and again. I’m stubborn, insistent, I don’t give up. It doesn’t work. That’s not how it works. I, of all people, should know. I know.
A sudden flash startles me, I stumble and fall on one knee into the snow, scrambling back to my feet. A silver burns bright against the whiteness before my eyes. At Malfoy's shocked gasp next to me, I reach out, trying to touch the silvery mist. I grasp emptiness, but its essence feels welcoming, there's something almost too familiar about it.
When I'm leaving the bathroom, I see Malfoy emerge from the stall, wrapped in a long black bathrobe, very pink in the face and flushed.
I shiver and wrap my arms around myself in the sleeping bag; my stomach rumbles. I'm cold and hungry, but there's no food. My warming spells are utter shit, I'm useless, and they don't hold. It's dark and raining heavily outside. Though tired I am, the sleep wouldn't come. I've been tossing in the sleeping bag for hours.
There's no reply... and I'm sure there won't be. Until in the morning before the Yule Ball, the note appears.
I leap up the stairs two steps at a time, pissed off with Malfoy, with this thing with Gin, with myself, with everything. I slam the door of my dorm shut. Thank Merlin, we don’t share it with the git.
[19] – dialogue between Voldemort and Neville Longbottom, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”, Part 2.
"I don't know, maybe you're right." I don't know why, but I suddenly have a bad feeling. "But wouldn't it be too dangerous? If we are seen, if
you do... I mean... when I saw you there, in the middle of all that... I don't even know how to call it...
Because Draco is good and smart and gentle, because he is fierce and kind, and he's never killed anyone - even a bloody chicken.
Malfoy emerges. He doesn’t spare me even a glance and quickly walks past, retreating down the corridor. I jog after him.
I'm so glad he came, so relieved. I've been sitting here in the back, stubbornly hoping he will approach. I refused to sit with Ron and Hermione.
Unaware of me staring, you'll be chatting with a witch in a plum gown, your delicate fingers absently tracing the stem of a champagne flute.
"Potter, what the hell?!" Malfoy springs on his feet, trying to wrench my hands away from Zabini's neck. "Get off him!"
I go to the bathroom to stare at myself in the mirror. I look like shit. I'd almost ceased to eat since the hearing began. It's been three weeks, and I look like a skeleton.
I don't want to look at him, don't want to turn my head, I cease to even breathe, lest I give him away.
He leans into me and gasps, and presses his face into the side of my neck. His breath is harsh and hot against my skin, and when it suddenly catches, I feel his shudder and a whispered moan. Warmth spills through my fingers, and I feel wetness through the front of my shirt. He shudders one last time and stills, leaning heavily into me.
"Done." He extinguishes the flame under the cauldron, closes the lid and turns to me. He's wearing goggles.
I wanted to slip my hand under my belly, but you grabbed it, pressing it into the pillow, leaving me frustrated and needy and trapped. Until I came untouched, my cock rubbing helplessly against the sheets.
There, under the ceiling, a house-elf is sitting astride the chandelier. His ugly little face determined, he twists the metal bulb on the heavy chain - around and around - his big ears flapping with every move.
, you've just barged in," Harry snapped. Honestly, could she be more annoying? "I don't do visitors. And it's lunchtime anyway."
Ron carefully stepped behind the lush rose tree in the middle of the room, peering at the assistant and the customer examining the item. A dainty gold thing, a weightless web of strings holding diamond water drops that shimmered in the light from the chandelier.
He headed to the wall behind his desk and touched it briefly with the tip of his wand in a pattern. A small vault opened in the middle, and he retrieved something out of it, making the vault close and blend back into the wall with the same series of taps.
I got used to it. Got used so that when you were suddenly not there, it felt as though I disappeared, too. As though you took me away with you, once you had left.
Potter says nothing. He takes the chair facing the window to my Father's left, leaving me the seat across from Father, as though putting himself as a barrier between us. I am grateful.
He's changed since we left the house. He often screams in his sleep or wanders, daydreaming; he's had a few seizures similar to the one I witnessed in the Room of Requirement. Unhinged - that's what he is.
Malfoy above gives a victorious cry, and I watch how Nott claps Zabini on the shoulder, passing him in the air.
I am really glad that Weasley girl isn't here with us, but my stomach sinks anyway. Because Potter has just all but confirmed my suspicions: they are on a mission, the three of them; secret and dangerous, one that includes no one else.
"I won't tell you…" There's a sound of him fumbling with something over there - a click, and a creak, like a lid opening, and then… music fills the air - a bright, uplifting tune. It beats and sways and swirls around, making me want to rock and bounce along with it.
You touched the glistening handle, ran your fingertips along the worn leather of the seat. The touch echoed in my guts. Raised goosebumps over my skin. I swallowed.
Because I'll never be able to let another man come close to me. Why couldn't I just pretend, go along with Father's game? At least I would still have remained a Malfoy.
He's right. We don't have a tent, and the cave is the best option available, but we haven't eaten anything since we left Weasley and Granger, so...
Mr. Vice says something to the staff, while Chris and Paul are standing with their heads bowed. Mr. Vice is gesticulating furiously with his hands, and two men head to the door, followed by the two staff members. You realise that the music has suddenly ceased playing.
"Shut the fuck up!" She says angrily when I almost reached the door. Not sure whom she's addressing.
Fair enough, and I do understand him, sure. It’s just every time I think of Ron - up there, without me - I feel sick.
side, I promised Harry, and I kept my promise until the very end. But Harry's dead, and I am dead, too. I don't have a side. I never had one.
"Draco, I..." I desperately wanted to move, to thrust, to go wild on him. He shut me up with a kiss, squeezing his thighs around me. I tore my lips away. "Draco, I..."
It's been a few weeks, and it feels as though I never left Hogwarts. As though nothing has happened. Dumbledore and Horcruxes and the woods. Stolen food and our camping, my fights with Weasley.
There's a silence. Malfoy shifts beside me, and I prepare myself for his another snogging session with Astoria. Maggie knows what she's doing, damn her.
Later we lay, tucked into each other on the narrow sofa, our feet sticking out over its side. The buzz of voices and a stray laughter scattered around the room. No one was paying us any attention, and it felt great.
"Deliver it to Noir," I whispered, stroking its feathers. I had no idea if it would work, if this owl wouldn't return back to me in an instant or refuse to leave at all.
"The house was on fire. I—" You wipe your eyes. "—barely managed to cast the spells so that you wouldn’t get burnt. If I came later—”
I sit down on the stool and close my eyes. I haven't played for years, and I think I have probably forgotten everything, but as soon as my fingers touch the keys, my hands know what to do. The melody returns to me, alive and vivid, the airy notes of the old Wizard Waltz filling the room as my fingers grow confident. I realise I am grinning and swaying to the music with my eyes closed. When I open them, I know what I am going to find: every lantern and lamp in the room is glowing, all the candles in the ancient chandelier are alight.
Realisation dawns on me just now: I'd never seen Malfoy show his arms. Of course, I never paid attention to that little detail but now that I think of it, trying to recall these details about Malfoy since the beginning of the term...
Abigail spins the bottle. It points at another girl. To the laughter of people, they kiss in the circle.
“Yeah, I like it here,” I reply, rummaging over the desk surface until my hand touches the cauldron in the centre. “I’m not going to brew anyway, I’ll just sit here and listen. I don’t want to get in the way--”
"What would you say if I told you that for our project I chose a potion that might return your sight?"
"Thanks." My palms hurt, I'm suddenly embarrassed. "I… I think I'm done." Releasing their hand, I begin walking, carefully prodding the floor with my feet... "Sorry, sorry guys…" People part before me. "May I?... Thanks…"
"Guys, what would you say if I told you that we found a Weasley, a girl and a guy in glasses?" Greyback grins. "It might be we captured Harry Bloody Potter." His gaze meets mine, and he stares, stares hard. Stares so that I know - he knows me, he has recognised me, and there's no point denying it. Slowly, he approaches.
Harry is asleep in the bed right next to mine. On his stomach under the blanket, his face obscured by the disarray of his hair, he breathes quietly, hugging the pillow in his sleep. I peer at him, trying to tell if anything's wrong. His face is clean, and so is his hair, he's wearing a white T-shirt. I see nothing amiss.
My patience snaps. I punch him right into his toothy smile. Crying out, he stumbles back, falling off the desk and on the floor. I loom over him. Another blow into his nose, twice. I see blood is dripping in rivulets down his smooth brown skin, and it feels so good. I should have done it long ago.
"This bath smells.. odd."  Draco said, opting to focus on the scent of the water being odd rather than the fact that he was in it with Harry Potter.
Draco shivered slightly, thinking he should have gotten redressed, not just pulled a cloak over his pyjamas, sitting down on the ledge of the window he'd sat in the last time he was up here.
Draco chewed the inside of his lower lip, looking uncertain for a moment before the corners of his lips curled up a bit and he looked down again.  “You weren't the only one who felt completely at odds with the weird 'attraction', Harry.  I wouldn't have admitted it then for anything.  And I know you wouldn't have either.”
Draco stayed silent for a few moments, pretending like he was considering before he nodded, smiling at the dark haired boy.  "Fine.  Is it formal?"
“I'm not trying to make light of the circumstances... But I would think anyone who was willing to kill someone to create a Horcrux once is not going to balk at creating another...”  He trailed off again, rubbing his thumb against the side of his pinky finger for a moment before he continued.  “Even if maybe each time you did it you became less human...”
"I am quite honoured."  Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye.  "Our next steps are fairly simple, I think.  I will get an owl, something non-descript but a trustworthy old soul. I will need you to see Draco again and brief him of what we've discussed.  I assume that he does not yet know that you planned to speak to me?"
This House Elf was perfunctory and not nearly as capricious as Dobby.  So when she saw the letter on Draco's desk, sealed and titled, she figured she would do Draco a favour.
Hermione snorted in a very derisive way that made Harry laugh and then she laughed with him.  "sorry, reflex."  She said, rubbing her cheek.  "They'll never get out of Azkaban.  But if they were hiding things that must mean..."  She hesitated here, her eyes flicking to Harry's face and searching it before she continued slowly.  "Perhaps Draco really did die in the Battle."
Silence.  Draco held his breath, counting the seconds that ticked past.  Each one that went by without Harry saying anything else made fear rise higher inside of him.
He turned his head, looking towards the back of the class where Harry sat with Ron and Hermione, as always.  The dark haired boy was writing something, but after a moment he raised his head and saw Draco looking at him.  He arched one eyebrow and raised his hands like he was silently asking Draco who he was choosing before he went back to writing.
“It was my mother's favourite punishment for me when I was a child.  Joke was on her, though, because I actually rather liked it.”
He thought he was dying.  He thought that somehow that woman had cursed him and he was dying.  His heart hammered in his chest, but spastically so, missing beats and seeming to find absolutely no coherent rhythm.  His chest hurt, it felt like someone was winding his muscles in tighter and tighter over his lungs, making him gasp for air as his hands shook.  His entire body seemed to shake, his vision somehow narrowing and sharpening at the same time.
By the second half of the third year Draco no longer came home to multiple envelopes on his living room rug informing him of intruders.
Ron frowned, turning back towards the couch as Harry's nasty tone sort of put him off wanting to help at all.
Draco picked up a pillow and smacked Harry with it, making the other man laugh.  "I won't get caught, you know I won't."
"It's just that over the summer, when he was at... Meetings in our house.  And he was giving Him updates and things.  He was telling him wrong information."
"Thank you."  Draco said, swallowing hard as he squeezed Harry's hand tight.  "I mean really, Harry...  I've never done anything to deserve this help from you."
The past month had been good fun at first, but as the weeks went on, Harry started to feel agitated with everyone.  At first Ron and Hermione hadn't wanted to listen to him talk endlessly about what had happened at Borgin & Burkes.  They didn't agree with him that Draco was up to something nefarious.  Or that he could possibly be a Death Eater.  They thought it was just Malfoy being Malfoy.
Draco had felt incredibly uneasy about the word 'action' being said while they were looking at him.  It was clear that they meant this directed at him, like he was going to have to take some sort of action.  And he was decidedly not interested in it.
"It's no trouble at all."  Draco said, nodding with a smile to Harry.  "I'll come back and help you with the rest of the house soon."
"But now it kind of is."  Harry said firmly, this time raising his head to meet Dumbledore's eyes over the half moon of his spectacles.  "But I don't want to get anyone in trouble, I want to save someone."
Harry watched him for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he smirked.  "You're serious.  No... You're joking."
“No he might.  Maybe.. I just...  I...  I haven't spoken to him.. since before the Battle at Hogwarts...”
His world softened a bit at a time, sounds started coming from the distance they were supposed to.  He could feel the carpet under him, sense the flat around him.
“Your flat!”  One of them said enthusiastically, stepping forward with a bright, beaming smile.  “Nice, isn't it?  Nicest one of all the people being put into protection.  Biggest one, too.”
So he returned to Gringotts to get the deed.  It took some persuading and some patience (he HAD, after all, broken into the vaults and released a dragon from it's depths...) but he was eventually allowed to his vault to retrieve the deed, and then he went back.
“Things change, Potter.” Draco said with a languid smile, his body relaxing and his hands sliding up Harry’s arms, twisting around them so his palms curved against the other boy’s biceps.
Mother grips my hand and crushes my fingers so that I wince and look at her. Looking me in the eyes, she briefly shakes her head. If only I understood what she means... I hardly care.
"Will Hogwarts give me my eyes back?!" I shout. "What the fuck am I supposed to do there? I can't even do magic now!"
is the only comfort left for us tonight. We have nothing, we are less than poor; we are famished of warmth and hope and trust. But at least we can have
It's so embarrassing to have this conversation with Potter, but tonight he seems to be in a rare mood for talking, and I don't mind. I'm fed up with silence. Let him talk. I prop my chin on my hand.
“Her face is… I wouldn’t call it pretty, it’s not as simple as just pretty, it’s… it has very precise, delicate features, a harmony…”
What the hell is he talking about? This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my entire life. I don't understand half of it, and I don't really care. The only thing that bothers me is
the thick tome wrapped in bright paper was already awaiting Hermione’s birthday on the shelf in your bedroom.
"You lied to the Dark Lord, Draco. You stood before him and lied to his face. That is when I became truly afraid. Your whole story was a lie to the last detail." Mother's face is grim. "If you slipped, if he as much as suspected anything. One word, Draco... a wrong word, a glance - he would have used Legilimency on you, and it would have cost you your life."
Coffee in hand, he settled himself on the couch again, stretching his legs out to rest his feet, crossed at the ankles, against the top of the coffee table.  He retrieved his phone and checked the time.  It was early, probably too early for most people, but he figured that Head of the Auror Department would likely at least be awake, if not ready for business.
"Hermione?"  Draco asked, raising his eyebrows slightly.  "Wouldn't that just cause more questions?"
It didn't matter because McGonagall wasn't looking at Snape either.  Both of them were turned to face the two boys in front of them.  The two most unlikely boys in the whole of Hogwarts to be showing any sort of united front.
But here he was.  Harry knew.  And now Longbottom knew.  And likely the other Aurors.  There was a good chance whenever he got back to the Wizarding World, IF he got back to it at all, everyone would know.
Harry started to ball one fist up as Ron asked him something so stupid, but he was spared having to temper his rage when Hermione thunked Ron on the top of his head with a textbook.
“It's.. brilliant...”  Draco said, closing his eyes immediately after he spoke, rubbing his fingers against the middle of his forehead when the words came out so utterly sarcastically even the bright Beaming Young Auror seemed to falter.
“Harry...  Whatever it is you've been going through...  You can talk to me.”  She looked at him so earnestly, so clearly hopeful.
Feel the hand on his back and the other against his wrist with two fingers held against his pulse point...
"Thank you most kindly."  He said to the house, patting the doorframe as though it was a pet.  He didn't know if that was needed, but he felt it wouldn't hurt to treat the house with a little respect and care.
They were quiet for a long time, Draco looked around a lot but never saw any other Muggles or anything that was different from the Wizarding world. That was a little disappointing, but it was quite late in the evening.  Likely this was a much busier place during the day.
“You best hope I do what you ask, then.  Nott's house burns Floo messages as they arrive so Owl Post is the only shot you have.”
Harry pushed his glasses up, then reached out to touch Draco's cheek, then moved his hand down to clasp around his left forearm, squeezing it firmly but not really hard.
They stood there in silence for a couple of minutes, the room and the safety it provided always hard to give up.
Harry knew Draco was kind of the one who understood appearances and what you did for them better than anyone.  His whole life had been like that.  His parents lives had as well.  But he shook his head rather vehemently.  "Maybe my 'fine and quaint and comfortable life' doesn't include any of those things.  I don't see why it has to and I don't see who's business it is what I do with my life now.  I've done my job, I fulfilled the prophecy or whatever.  It's done."
“I never thought of that..”  Harry said, his heart soaring a bit.  He and Draco wouldn't have to completely stop seeing each other.  In fact, it would be better if Ron and Hermione saw them together a lot...
It only took a couple of minutes, he wasn't exactly experienced, and he could tell that there was nothing stopping him, not now.  His hands tightened against Harry's back, then one slid into his hair, fisting in the dark strands as he felt the pull right from the soles of his feet.  The rush of heat that claimed him, his hips pressing forward hard as he cried out, throbbed sticky and hot against his own skin.
"Twenty Galleons.  A mere twenty Galleons and it is yours."  Borgin said with a hint of a weasel like smile.
Draco shook his head, exhaling a breath sharply.  "To think you've come this far with them as it is.  You're loyal, I'll give you that."
"Why in Merlin's name would I lie to you?"  Draco unfolded his arms and set both feet on the floor, leaning forward a bit.  He felt Harry shift next to him, felt a hand against his back very lightly.  "What would I gain from lying to you?  It isn't as if anything I do escapes your notice forever, I'd be doing nothing but buying myself the few minutes it would take you to write to Astoria and ask her who she's been dating or ask her if she even really likes me."
A silky voice spoke from a doorway on the left, making both Draco and Harry jump and turn.  Draco looked confused at who he saw, but Harry smiled, leaning against the post he still had his hand on.
It was still protecting itself, he remembered Hermione saying that to him.  That no one had been able to get inside- and now he could see why.  But he WAS legal owner of Malfoy Manor now, so it should have renounced it's ties to the Malfoy's.
"TV is... Hrm..." Harry scrunched his mouth to one side as he thought.  "That's a hard one to describe...  Without trying to get into all the mechanics behind it- A TV is a box that displays moving pictures on it with sound and everything.  Like a play but in your own home and not live in front of you, it's just pictures, the people aren't really there.  Merlin, thats a tough one to explain.  I'll just show you sometime."
"Which is admirable to say the least.  And I'm certainly not going to stand in the way of you helping someone, especially when it's clearly so pure intentioned and offers an avenue in this that I had not considered.  While I did, of course, know of this plot as soon as it came about, I was not quite as informed about the toll it was taking on Draco himself.  And was not told just how bad things were for the Malfoy's in general.  Of course, they wouldn't want anyone to know that.  Knowing they felt themselves in a bad place would be dangerous for them, even more so than the danger they're already in."
But he thought, again, as he had several times over the past few days, that maybe he should have just stayed home and taken his chances.
"Uh huh."  Harry said, keeping his eyes on the other boy for a few moments in silence before he spoke again.  "Can I see it?"
“Oh good, you're smiling.” A voice said and a body rounded the corner into the flat, carrying a box in the Muggle way so the person holding it couldn't be seen.
He hated himself for every word he said, but he knew it was for good cause.  He knew that across the hall Draco was sitting at Slytherin and probably watching him.
"Go."  Narcissa said, having moved soundlessly to read the letter in Draco's hand over his shoulder.  "Hear what he's found out, if for no other reason than
" Harry said the incantation after tapping the less dusty spot, then flicked his wand up.  Hermione had told him that if the item was in the house he'd hear bells jingling where it was and he just had to follow the sound of them as they got louder or softer to find what he was missing.
Draco rolled his eyes, picking up a box of cereal he had in the 'recognized from television' pile called Lucky Charms.  It promised marshmallows along with crunchy cereal and that was quite intriguing.  “I only put in my withdrawal form this morning with one of the Aurors.  You shouldn't have bothered coming until you had it yourself and could go to the bank.”
Silence stretched for a full couple of minutes before Draco spoke again to break it, his voice a little softer.  “I knew you were looking at me.”
Ollivander had tried to talk to him more than once.  That kindly old man, who seemed to know nothing but wands, but who had actually held a very deep understanding of people and children through his years.  Held prisoner but still seeming more concerned over Draco's fear, his trembling hands.
"Why is Dumbledore showing you so much about my life?  The real reason."  His voice was soft, but there was such command behind it.
He breathed heavily, his mind spinning almost frantically.  Trying to make sense of something that made no sense at all.
“Maybe they'll be friends.”  Harry said quietly, standing a little taller than he had been, his shoulders setting back, his chin raising slightly.  But his posture was in a way protective of the man standing in front of him, not challenging him. “Perhaps.”  Draco said after a long pause, uncertainty and unasked questions showing plainly in his eyes.
With a smirk, Draco picked up his quill and smoothed the note from Harry out a bit so he could write his reply on the same parchment-
It was strange to think of Harry lonely.  The hero of the Wizarding World who couldn't walk down the street without everyone speaking to him.  Although Draco knew deep down how hollow those interactions were.  And that they probably made Harry feel even more alone because of shallowness of it.
"Dumbledore has always told me that Snape was with them.  I never really believed it." Harry growled the words out.
“I taught you about television, didn't I?”  Neville's smile turned slightly quirky as he swallowed his coffee.
Draco nodded, turning his eyes away a bit.  "He did, I hung back, I didn't want to fight it.  Cowardly..."
He tilted his head a bit as he lapsed off, smiling at Draco when the other boy immediately picked up where he left off.
But she never seemed to have anything bad to say.  Never had a complaint.  He brought them both food.  Water.  In that dank dungeon, no light, no air...
Harry couldn't help but smirk, raising his hand to press the back of it against his mouth to try and hide the look.  Which didn't really do the trick and made Draco colour even darker than before.
"So?"  Draco relaxed his hands in Harry's hair, letting them drop down but he kept his arms comfortably around the other boy's shoulders.
"Potter?"  He said, his hand starting to shake a bit as he looked around and around, turning on the spot where he was, not wanting to move an inch.
They only stopped when the necessity to take a full breath of air forced it.  Both of them panting, their faces close, foreheads pressed together, noses nudging together.  Lips still close enough to catch together as they spoke.
“Ah!” Harry laughed, pointing at Draco as he explained.  “There it is.  The proper angle and response I was expecting.  Well alright, you don't need to learn washing up, but cooking you do.  Or at least how to use a phone and order delivery.”
"YOU don't know if you can trust Snape."  Harry said with a laugh, shaking his head and flopping back onto the bed on his back.  "You of all people.  Can't decide if you should trust Snape or not.  That's rich."
The silence stretched in the room, Draco's shifting of box contents not enough to drown out the noise of an argument that came from neighbours up the hall.
"Mm..."  Draco pressed his lips together, raising his eyebrows a bit as he tilted his head a bit further, an impish looking coming into his eyes.  "This is probably absolute sacrilege to ask but...  Was he attractive?"
"Are your Aunt and Uncle really terrible?"  Draco asked, stretching his legs out as well, comparing how much difference there was between his and Harry's together.
"They're putting it up for auction.  Contents and everything."  Ron was uncorking a bottle of firewhiskey, pouring a measure into his glass then leaning over towards Harry to do the same.  "It's been empty for five years, though it looks like it's been left for five hundred.  Already so overgrown and looks unkempt."
"You have a point..." Harry said slowly after a few moments, his tone so relaxed and easy that Draco couldn't help feeling not only relieved but also soothed by it.  "So what do we do?"
Draco couldn't help but smile faintly to himself that even amid the blood curdling screams, as though they were torturing the old lady, Harry was making sure that Kreacher was happy.
"Dumbledore."  Harry said hoarsely.  "That mead was for Dumbledore."  He leaned forward in sudden panic, not just for the threat on Dumbledore, but for the absolutely barbaric and horrific task that Voldemort had given Draco.  "He wants you to..."
“It is Voldemort.”  Draco said, sighing out a long deep breath.  He waited, sure this time that Harry would ask him more, and he was right.  After a few minutes of silence the dark haired boy spoke again.
"I know you went to Borgin & Burkes the same day we were in Diagon Alley.  And I know what you went in there for." Harry had been waiting since that day to be able to confide in Draco that he knew this, he was more than a little excited to finally be saying it.
Both boys sat in silence in the water, long enough for Draco's anger to ebb away a bit, the sting of it leaving him slowly, washing away into the water and leaving his mind more room to focus on other things.
But there was something fluttering in his stomach as Paul and Prue walked to his bench, the look on Paul's face turned from smarmy and self satisfied to more than a little surprised when he saw the visually flawless and perfect cake, his eyebrows shooting upwards.
Harry himself, to his own admission, had killed people in the war.  But surely he had reason to.  Did he feel bad about it?  Probably not since he offered the information so openly.  He'd killed Death Eaters and Quirrell.  Quirrell had been quite innocent, he thought.  But there was nothing to be done, really.  Voldemort had attached himself quite literally to Quirrell, Harry couldn't have decided to not do as he needed to just because of that.
Draco smiled back at Harry, giving him a wave before he turned on the spot and apparated back to Malfoy Manor.
Deciding to start from the place he noticed first, but he guessed was the last thing grabbed if whoever had taken the things left the house with them, he turned right to the table inside the door.  The dust there was marred with the slide of fingers that had picked something up.  There wasn't a clear outline of what had been on the table, but there was a 'less dusty' area there.  Like someone had set something down on the already dusty surface, and then picked it up again, leaving the finger swipes.
Dumbledore had already pulled a scroll of parchment towards himself and was writing.  Harry watched him without looking at the words and Dumbledore must have known he could trust him as he did nothing to shield them.
“I have absolutely no idea.” He said to her in return, and it was an honest answer.  He didn't really know what that was.  What Draco had truly wanted.  If it truly was to try and give back the necklace that Harry had always thought rather girlish to begin with. Ginny gave him a slightly side long glance with a smile and raised eyebrows that made him laugh and colour faintly.
"There is absolutely NO way you could do that."  Harry said, giving Draco a shove over on the couch so there was room for him and the massive bowl of popcorn he was carrying to flop down next to the other man.  "You couldn't even boil water for tea."
“I'll go to the library tomorrow.”  Hermione said, then glared at Ron before smiling at Harry.  “It would be helpful if you two came along to help.”
“I'm supposed to go to the library after dinner with them to start research.  So far everything is going as we hoped.”
"I will write a letter." Dumbledore said after a few moments, speaking more quietly.  "It will be for Draco and Draco only unless he wishes to share it with you.  But I do trust you, Harry, to bring it to him without reading it."
Draco huffed out a breath, moving to slide his wand into his pocket only to realize he wasn't wearing anything with pockets.  He was, in fact, just wearing boxer shorts.
He said quietly as he slid his thumb along the parchment, then sucked in a sharp breath as a name appeared in the glinting space.
"What is WRONG with you!?"  Draco sputtered when Harry continued to talk to him in such a friendly way.  He'd taken a step back from the dark haired boy, looking at him like he had eels coming out of his ears.
“Come in.”  He said, beckoning with a slight smile, gesturing to the chair that McGonagall had declined to sit in.  “Thank you for coming.”
And then he picked up the sack and the suitcase and walked back to the Leaky Cauldron.  He stepped through the dim interior, not looking around, and not glancing back once before he walked out the door onto the Muggle street, turned right, and started his new life.
"I trust you, sir.  And I think that we'd be in good hands with you actively helping." Harry smiled as he nodded and was rather pleased at the happy smile Dumbledore gave him in return.
"Same reason I bet you're trying with every bit of personal strength you have NOT to look down at me right now."  Harry said, one side of his mouth curving up again.
“Only supposed to be standing guard outside.”  The Auror had spit out, half under his breath, when Draco attempted to make conversation with him.  “Shouldn't have to actually come in here and do anything.  Ridiculous.”
"You went to Snape to ask him to be your cover for when we want to meet.  YOU went to SNAPE for a favour."
something Draco needed there was a good chance the other boy would eventually figure that out and come back for it.
They knew this might be their last chance.  Their only chance.  The years of mixed feelings, of angry kisses, of needy touches, of playing the back and forth game of trying to keep the upper hand had dissolved the year before.  When the real horror of both their lives was made clear.
In spite of himself, Draco smirked a little bit.  "I don't have to mean it to say it.  And know that it is something that should be stopped."
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Harry said truthfully, tilting his head a bit as he looked at Draco rather curiously. “I had more than your personal influence guiding me in that.  Sirius was pretty driven against it.  My father was as well.”
"You did."  Narcissa said, smiling slightly at Draco.  "That's why I guessed.  You got along far too well and far too easily and warmly to be with each other every day."
"No.  I don't."    He stopped there again, then sighed softly.  "We really aren't together.   We are for show, according to anyone who knows us we're together and happy.  But she and Scorpius live... I don't know where, actually.  I've never been to where she lives now."
“It's going to be awful.”  Harry said, almost before Draco had even finished saying 'but'.  “I know.  But we'll get what we need and then we can be even more free to plan and to talk.”
"Terrified of him."  Draco said, shaking his head.  "Oh he provided well, he paved the way for anything I wanted.  But it all came at a price."
Draco turned his head a bit to look over at his mother who was looking into the fire, sitting perfectly still.  Something they both did when they were unnerved.  She looked so strong and so tired, having gone through so much in the past few months and he'd had no idea.
But deep down Draco held a kernel of resentment that he'd been left behind.  He had no reason to think that way, no reason to feel that.  Harry and he had been enemies through school.  Totally opposing sides of everything.  There was no reason for Harry to have done something so incredibly risky for someone that he had never, not once, been able to trust even a little bit.
“How long have you been working?”  He set the milk down on the counter, added what he thought was cream as well and then went looking for sugar cubes.
“I thought they sounded quite.... useful...”  He said just as quietly back to Tom, but he smiled a bit.  Just a bit.  Just enough that was probably much like the look the slightly younger Tom had when Slughorn had explained to him about them.
“Thank you.”  He muttered, getting up from his stool and walking to the living room.  He was oblivious to the odd look Harry gave him once his back was turned, but he wouldn't have particularly cared anyways.  “I don't think I need anything else from you.”
As much as Harry didn't want to admit it, he knew Draco was right.  He'd been staunchly ignoring the fact that there seemed to be no end to what came next for himself as the Boy Who Lived.  It was still early days after the war, people and the wizarding world as a whole were still sorting themselves out.  But he could see the roads and paths that lay ahead of him.  And he knew Draco was dead on when he said it wouldn't ever be done.
Harry nodded slowly, putting together the pieces of the conversation he'd heard between Draco and Borgin.  “Right, you were asking him how to fix it.  Did he?”
“I heard that you’ve asked Draco Malfoy to come in and have a meeting with you shortly.” She said crisply, resting her hands on the back of the chair she’d been invited to sit in.  Either preferring to stand, or she wasn’t planning to stay long.
But once again he couldn't find what he was looking for.  And he wasn't so engrossed in the work that he could  figure it out any more plainly than before, working himself into an absolute lather before he hurled his book on the floor and swore rather profusely.
Tom's eyes went redder, but unlike the last dream that had ended with anger when his eyes turned red, this time they seemed to be filled with something close to excitement.
“No.. Sorry.  I don’t mean he seems scared of the subject matter.  He tackles that quite handily.  I mean he seems afraid of me.  Fairly strongly.”
The two men smiled at each other a bit more openly, neither saying anything for a few moments before Draco broke the silence.
"We might need a way to communicate with Draco's mother."  Harry said, continuing to work extremely hard to keep his temper in check.  "We don't know how things are going to play out.  He'll want to be able to talk to her and rather than wait until it's necessary, we're looking at how to do it now."
His head ached, packed so full of those cobwebs he felt his skull might crack.  He waited for the cold to come, he wanted it, wanted to pass out and wake up again.  Start this day over.  Maybe it would be better.
“That's fine, I can help you decide.  That's what I'm here for, after all!  Do you want a Windows laptop or a Mac?”
"How?"  Draco asked, turning his head a bit then to look at his mother.  "I thought we made a good show of looking very together."
Draco went back to the window, trying to look out without being obvious.  Especially when he saw heads from the apartments below him poke out of the windows to look at what was happening.
"I'm not here to play games.  I'm here for answers.  Tell me, now.  What did Draco Malfoy come in here, what did he want fixed?"
Harry trailed off then, keeping his eyes on his hands where they were clenched in his lap.  When the silence stretched, he raised his head a bit.  Then a bit more.  Just enough to see the chin of the person he was talking to.
"I have nothing to say."  Draco replied to her, shifting to cross his legs and fold his arms across his chest.
Draco made a face.  He did not want to go on a tour with Harry.  He didn't want to go anywhere with Harry, ever.  But he also didn't want to starve to death or make a scene when he tried to go out and shop.  Harry was implying that the Muggle world might be a little more difficult to navigate than Draco assumed it was.
“We can just be secretive.”  Harry said after the silence stretched.  “We can find a way to pass notes or something to each other when we need to meet and talk.  Just date and time, we'll always come here to talk.  That way there's no names, no locations, no nothing.  Anyone finds the notes, it's a reminder to see a Professor or something.”
“You don’t have proof you aren’t disappearing if it came to that.” Harry growled, shifting  forward a bit more.
But intent and focus...  That wasn't exactly something both he and Draco were lacking.  Draco was incredibly intense and Harry was being honest when he talked about his skill level.
He went first to Grimmauld Place, having no idea where else to go.  He stayed there for months, leaving only to go into the Muggle world for food and supplies.  He stopped answering Owls, stopped allowing any visitors, even his friends.  And eventually, everyone started leaving him alone.
He turned on the lights in the living room as well as the kitchen and went to flop on the couch to wait for the coffee.  As he tilted his head against the back cushions of the couch, his phone buzzed where he'd left it the day before.
He could swear he still felt it's presence on his finger but it wasn't there.  He couldn't see it and couldn't feel it with his fingers.  And yet the comforting solid sort of energy that had come with it `was still present.
“Friendly is a very kind way to describe him.”  Harry said, walking over to the staircase, sliding his hand over one of the massive newel posts as he looked up the stairs.  “Seriously...  This place is amazing.  It's no wonder you gloat about it.  And no wonder it's where all the meetings are...”
And that seemed to set Harry off guard, the dark haired boy unable to help looking at him curiously.
Draco hissed the words at Harry as the dark haired boy slid himself down onto the bench at the Slytherin table the next morning.  Harry couldn't help but note that while his words sounded aggravated, his face seemed to say he was thrilled.
