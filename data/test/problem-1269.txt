Draco removed a cigarette from his silver case, but it wasn't until he placed it between his lips that he realised the patio at The Thistle and Briar was, unfortunately, occupied.
Draco was fussing with an arrangement of valuable antique potions equipment for one of his display cases when a brightly coloured toucan came tumbling through the cracked window. It stumbled to an ungainly landing atop precariously stacked boxes of half-unpacked cauldrons for Draco's work station, upending the uppermost and sending the whole thing tumbling to the floor. One of the cauldrons landed squarely atop the bird and its alarmed squawk echoed against the iron.
Draco sent the letter with an owl at the Postal Owlery near the entrance of Diagon and then returned to his shop to set things to rights. His schedule was shot completely to hell now, and he would have to work double-time, or even hire additional help, if he hoped to be open in time for the holidays.
Harry took his time with it, undoing each button slowly and watching the way Malfoy clocked his every movement with heavy lidded eyes. When he reached the last button, he spread the fabric wide, letting it hang off his shoulders while he undid his cuffs.
Draco considered for a half-second calling into work and telling them to fuck right off, because Harry Potter managed to show an alarming amount of skin even when dressed and Draco could still taste him on the back of his tongue. Draco hoped the desire would have dimmed in the daylight, but no such luck. He sent a silent curse to the heavens, his cock twitching in his trousers, from nothing more than watching Potter bend over to lace his boots.
Draco frowned. "I can assure you, Potter, there is no room left in my schedule for casual murdering, so if you're here to accuse me of something, I suggest you get on with it so I can call my solicitor."
Draco levels him with a glare, but Potter does his best to look unconcerned. “A little gratitude would be nice. I am doing you a favour, after all.”
Draco followed Harry into the living room, where he came face to face with Luna Lovegood, seated cross-legged on the floor surrounded by cardboard boxes.
"Don't underestimate my husband's capacity for decency, Malfoy. You may have been a right arse when you were a kid, and I can't say I have a single fond memory of you, but we aren't children anymore. Unless you plan on hurting anyone or acting like the prick I presume you might still be, well, you'll get no trouble from me. I have a business to run and, if you're paying, I'll help you."
She then pulled a weighty keyring from a nail on the wall and after a few moments of fumbling, selected a long, silver skeleton key. She inserted the key into the lock of one of the hundreds of small boxes, each numbered and sporting a differently shaped keyhole. She retrieved Draco’s wand from the box and handed it to Potter.
She probably would, Harry thought. She’d smiled sweetly at him and told him to call her if he ever needed anything, and she’d emphasized the
"And would you believe, the American Minister told the French emissary that taxation on dragon's blood was just a simple matter of capitalism and — " Partridge continued, undeterred.
The group collectively leaned back, eyes wide – apart from Parkinson, who stiffened, her sharp brows drawing together.
Mary’s mouth went tight and her throat bobbed, then she squeezed her eyes shut. Her serious expression crumpled, and Marcus shot Draco a nervous look.
She was right, of course. As much as Harry didn’t want to admit it, he and Robards were at an impasse.
“I told you, it’s my job. I work with Luna at her magical creature rescue. The rest of the time, I manage a dragon sanctuary. She called me in to help move a Welsh Green that her team rescued from an illegal breeding operation in Manchester. I misread a situation. Got too close.”
but managed to keep his admissions between his teeth. "I've got Galleons riding on Marcy singing and dancing on the tables to that horrid Muggle Mariah Carey song."
Caught off guard, Draco made a horrible fool of himself, sputtering inelegantly mid-sentence during a conversation regarding contemporary robe designs with Madam Twilfitt of Twilfitt and Tattings.
Draco stretched out on the lounge, crossed his ankles, and tipped his sunglasses from his forehead down over his eyes.
Draco reached for the ashtray at his elbow, then paused, because tucked beneath it was a cream coloured sheet of parchment, folded three times and wax sealed, and stamped with the Hogwarts emblem. The seal was broken. He tugged the letter from beneath the crystal ashtray with one finger, but didn't open it.
Draco pushed the glass of champagne back into Potter's hand. There were only a couple sips left and Draco decided he'd drank enough. There were no less than three Wizengamot members hovering a few feet away, eyeing Potter, clearly gearing up to accost him, and Draco wasn't interested in standing there like a numpty while they nattered on.
He thought about pushing past Potter to the patio, or perhaps throwing his glass as some sort of distraction and hightailing it for the front door. But before he could decide which one was the better option, Potter spoke again.
“Oh, go let your adoring fans dote on you for a night. Try not to look so sour,” Draco said with a dramatic roll of his eyes.
, but I can’t say I’m surprised that yet another member of the DMLE approaches human sexuality like it’s 1895. Your lot aren’t exactly known for such modern concepts as tolerance
“Right. Yes. Regardless. I best be off. Things to do, people to see.” It was weak, as far as excuses go, but Draco’s brain had clearly stopped functioning properly. Harry had that effect, it seemed.
Draco shook his head no, certain that drinking any more in Potter’s presence would be ill-advised. He’d rather not loosen his tongue.
"And will you ever stop trying to martyr yourself because you've figured out you aren't good for anything else?"
She guided them through the front door and into the foyer and Draco finally dropped the arm from Harry’s waist to trail after her.
When Draco returns to the sitting room, Potter watches him with dark eyes and Draco waits for the insult, but it doesn’t come.
She whistled at him as he stomped up to her and obliterated the wards with an angry slash of his wand.
"Only when I have the bloody head of Magical Law Enforcement trailing me like a crup sniffing out the butcher."
He stormed to the kitchen and went about making tea to calm his nerves. With a few aggressive swishes of his wand, the kettle was on and a mug floated from the cupboard to smack down onto the countertop. Draco leaned back against the wall and waited for the water to boil.
Everyone was there; Pansy, looking quite smug, and Blaise, off to buy a round of drinks, but also Greg and Theo. Lovegood, in ten miles of tulle skirt, was standing to the side with the girl Weasel, who had one arm around her waist and a begrudging expression on her freckled face. Granger was there too, with some of their workmates, still clad in her Healer greens. She gave him a harried, one-armed hug, apologising for her outfit and potion stains, though Draco thought them more palatable than chocolate. Everyone hugged him and slapped him on the back as Draco continued to scan the room—looking, looking.
They tussled under the water, slick skin against gloriously wet, slick skin. Draco was hard as a rock – completely recovered from Harry’s attempt at drowning him at his most distracted and vulnerable moment. Ruddy heathen.
“And is this just something that came to you in the dead of night? Or is there someone specific that has made you realize this?”
Potter released Draco's tie and laid a hand over his bare chest in mock surprise. "That might be the second compliment you've ever given me."
Even without Potter, the party was fun. Draco probably had one too many of the cocktails Nigel made for him — the ones that tasted a bit like drinking pine and chewing on flowers, that Pansy said made his breath smell like potpourri. There was cake, too. A lavishly decorated thing that Greg brought from the bakery where he worked and made to Pansy’s exact specifications, with lemon curd between moist layers of vanilla. Draco loved lemon.
Perhaps it was the alcohol or the elation that came from spending a massive amount of money, but Potter let his guard down and gave Draco a peek behind the curtain – a view he found he’d desperately craved for many, many years. He wondered, was that how Harry acted around friends? Was he always so warm and candid? Because if he was, it was no wonder he had so many devoted to him.
"Ah, thank you. You're too kind," Draco responded, unprepared to accept such heartfelt compliments so soon. Lovegood and Draco had never been
The grinding of Potter's hips against the mattress grew stuttering and jerky. He was close, Draco could tell. He could always tell, and Draco was determined to tip Potter over the edge, to make him come without a single touch to his cock. Draco gave Potter a quick jerk to the thighs, raising his hips from the bed, and Potter made a pained sound. His cock hung between his legs, flushed red and dripping onto the sheets.
Harry worked him open slowly, mercilessly, skating across Draco's prostate every time the tension in his spine eased. Draco had his teeth clamped into the pillow and he was making the most gorgeous sounds — soft little groans in that deep velvety voice that went straight to Harry's cock.
They lay there for what may have been seconds, but felt like hours, just breathing into the silence of the room.
“You’re too late, Malfoy. You drilled it into my head how ‘utterly embarrassing’ it would be to show up without a date. So, I found myself one.”
“Yes, fortunate,” Draco grumbled. He glared at her while she did a lap around the living room, lifting odds and ends with her meaty hands and dropping them carelessly. He wanted to hex her. He wanted to demand to know where Potter was.
Draco's head spun, the dizziness making his knees buckle. Sweat beaded on his brow and prickled at the base of his spine, and Draco didn't know how much longer he could stand it. He could come like this, from nothing more than the drag of his clothed cock against Potter's, tongue lost between Potter's teeth. And while that desperation was nearly enough for him to let go, he wanted more. He didn't want to come on Potter in the middle of a crowded dance floor. He wanted Potter's skin beneath his hands, wanted to map the dips of the muscles at his hips with his fingertips and his tongue. He wanted more than the wild and reckless frottage of last week. He wanted Potter's cock heavy in his hand, thick in his arse.
Unlike in London, where magical districts were surrounded by wards and barriers like a fortress, Muggle Paris bled seamlessly into magical areas, distinct but unrestricted. It had made Draco uncomfortable at first, to see a rogue taxicab lumber through the wards that encased the townhouse he shared with his parents, then pop out the other side, entirely unaware. Or the flocks of Muggle tourists with their cameras snapping photos outside the French Ministry of Magic, simply because the sculptures that surrounded the building made for a good backdrop. Or even here, where some of the world's best Potion Masters trained, all of whom carried pockets full of euros to pay for coffee and sandwiches from the café across the street.
It was supposed to be a routine bust. McConnell was a prick, but he’d offered up enough low-level crooks and underworld cronies to the department that Harry learned to tolerate him. He’d promised Harry a slimy Frenchman by the name of Argent, who’d managed to con his way across Europe and America with nothing more than a fat wallet and a sleight of hand. Harry nearly dropped his wand when he caught sight of his target’s shock of blonde hair and familiar sneer – the one that still managed to make something in Harry’s gut twist and roil, even after all those years. The force behind his Expelliarmus had been an accident. Harry liked to think he had control of his magic these days, but sometimes it still managed to get away from him. And he reckoned Draco Malfoy was a predictable trigger for a magical outburst.
The night air hitting Draco’s wet skin was a shock, but it was nothing compared to the shock that came when Harry bowed his head into Draco’s lap and curled his tongue around the tip of his aching cock.
“You left,” he says, breathless as he jogs up the steps to where Draco is perched. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Draco was pushing back against Harry's hand, fucking himself on his fingers, and Harry gripped him tightly by the hip to keep him still. The third finger went in easily, and Harry didn't know how much longer he could stand it. The inside of Draco's body was slick, hot and clinging, and Harry wanted nothing more than to bury himself inside and rut until he came.
Draco averted his eyes, but not before Potter caught him looking. He grinned wider, this time wolfish and with teeth, and Draco needed to remove himself from the situation before he did something foolish like try to touch him. Like running his fingers across the ridges of his abdominals or pressing his mouth against the hollow spot at the base of his throat or…
Harry gasps as his back hits the mattress. Draco tears at the button on Harry’s jeans, then his own, rolling away just long enough to shuck them and shove Harry’s to his knees. He settles back across Harry’s hips, shirt still hanging from his shoulders, hair a mess, panting, and eyes burning. He doesn’t know what the hell is wrong with him, but he’s hot all over and is certain that if Harry doesn’t touch him soon, he’s going to burst into flames.
Draco found a smile curling at corners of his mouth when Lilian's angular face and wide, dark eyes appeared in the Floo.
“Admit it,” Harry said as he curled into Draco’s side, one arm thrown over his chest and his chin tucked into the space beneath Draco’s ear. “You like the way I talk.”
Because even though Potter was here, this thing between them was ruined before Draco even knew what it was. It was ruined the moment Potter rejected his boyhood offer of friendship. Even as a child, Potter could see Draco for what he was, could anticipate the fear and cowardice that would become his trademark.
“I don’t know. You seem…lighter, I guess? I’ll admit, I’m still surprised you finally got rid of that creepy old house. Thought you were going to live there until it rotted around you. Not that I’m not happy for you, I am,” Ron said, opening both his eyes and lifting his head to grin crookedly at Harry. “Hell, I’m ecstatic. I’m just glad I’ll never have to spend another night in that place.” Ron gave a dramatic shudder.
"Isn't it something?" Pansy asked, plucking one of the overfilled champagne glasses from the tray and handed it to Draco.
Potter licked his lips, and he spread his thighs wider. “I want it,” he said, voice smoky and grittier than gravel.
Marcus patted him gently on the shoulder once more, fingers lingering there — a reassuring squeeze. Then he pushed off the wall and wandered off down the corridor with drooping shoulders.
"Maybe," Potter said, hanging upside down in front of Draco, glasses slipping precariously from his nose and hair sticking straight up to be ruffled by the winter wind. "Is it working?"
Thank you all so much for joining me on this journey! 2020 has been a fuckall year and getting back into writing fic has been such a huge source of joy for me – and that is primarily due to all of you! There is nothing more rewarding for a writer than knowing that people are connecting with your work. Seriously all the squeeing in the comments – ugh. Just light on a dark day.
The door to Potter’s office was open and when Draco approached, he could see Potter bent over a stack of paperwork, his glasses pushed up into his hair, and one hand rubbing between his eyes. He looked tired and a little deflated. Well, as much as a person like Potter could look that way. The magic still crackled around him, electric and fierce. Draco could feel it even from where he stood, hovering on the threshold and it made the fine hairs on his arms stand on end. It made him want to go for his wand. It made him a little hard.
It wasn’t what Draco expected. He expected a fight, not this beautiful surrender. But that was it exactly, because Potter didn’t struggle or try to wrest control. He melted into it, his bottom lip sucked between straight, white teeth.
A few minutes later, Potter placed a mug of something warm and smelling sweetly of chocolate, spice, and liquor between Draco’s hands. He sipped it gratefully, the bittersweet cocoa melting away the lingering tension in his spine and soothing his frayed nerves. Draco sighed, head falling back against the chair.
And at Harry’s command, Draco shatters. His stomach pulls tight, muscles clenching as his back arches, mouth falling open in a silent shout. Every single nerve ending lights up all at once, crackling and sparking as pleasure shoots from his centre to the tips of his fingers and toes. His brain goes entirely offline, lost in a fog of aching sensation.
“Oh, all right. I was perhaps the tiniest, eensy-weensy bit miffed at you at the time. You had just arrested me and stuck me with what you must realize is an unreasonably long sentence over a misdemeanor. I hadn’t seen you in years and years, and in case you weren’t aware of it, Harry, you’ve gotten rather good looking and I think that pissed me off more than anything. Because, honestly, how fucking dare you? How dare you walk around looking the way you do with the
Draco half considered inviting Eddie to join him and Pansy for a drink, as he didn’t want to go home alone on his birthday, but decided against it at the last minute, ducking between a row of lockers and slipping out the door before the Healer caught sight of him.
Potter nodded, laughing, and Draco nearly lost his balance because he never heard Potter laugh like that. Not around him, at least. Potter extended a hand, and somewhere in the back of Draco's mind alarm bells started to sound. This was an unbelievably bad idea. They were...well, they were
The letter was, unsurprisingly, from Luna Lovegood. She invited Draco to meet her at a pastry shop on the opposite end of Diagon Alley in three hours. The letter, written in looping script, the i's dotted with little hearts, asked Draco to kindly dress his best for the photographer.
It was a lovely sight, watching Harry finger himself open, rough and hurried, as if he couldn’t wait another second to be filled. Draco dropped his legs from where they twined around Potter’s waist to sit up. He ran soothing palms up Harry’s thighs, felt the muscles tighten and roll as Harry leaned back further to bury another finger in his own arse. Draco dipped his head to pepper kisses across Harry’s chest, his saliva leaving a gleaming trail against golden skin, illuminated by the slanting rays of sunlight through the windows. He swirled a tongue around one nipple, felt it pebble beneath his lips, then nipped at the flesh until Harry cried out, a high-pitched, heavenly sound that wheedled its way from his throat to hand in the stifling air.
atmosphere. I didn’t get on the back of that bloody death trap you ride around on because it’s fun. I didn’t chase after fucking dragons in the front seat of a Muggle automobile, tolerate numerous meat-fisted Weasleys, suffer through dull parties, make house calls, or sew you up time and time again because of any misplaced sense of guilt, pity, honour, or even duty. Because in all honesty, I’m not driven by any of those things.
"How long have I been out?" Harry asked in a hoarse whisper. He tipped his head towards the glasses sitting on the bedside table.
Draco spent another fitful night lost to insomnia. Despite the exhaustion dragging at his limbs and eyelids, he tossed and turned, flitting between nightmares and vague consciousness. Even after the double espresso he had for breakfast, Draco stopped at a cafe for a takeaway coffee just to propel him through the hospital doors the following morning.
Ian laughed, and Ginny and Harry looked back at them. Ian threw a drunken thumbs up. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco makes an indignant sound that isn’t a squawk, but also isn’t that far off. It’s nonsense! He and Potter were nothing but rivals and perhaps even enemies during school. It wasn’t as if they formed some simpering friendship during those long days toiling away with the reconstruction, while Potter hovered at his shoulder like a scowling ghost. Although Draco supposes the animosity thawed, to some extent. And after Potter disappeared, off to do the Ministry’s bidding or gallivant around the continent, Draco didn’t
“Now you’re laying it on thick,” Draco said, huffing a chuckle against the rim of his martini glass. “Don’t stop.”
Draco's heart sunk into his shoes as he swivelled slowly to find Potter and Weasley striding towards them. Weasley grinned at Blaise, but Potter's eyes were fixed on Draco.
Intrigued, Draco jotted down the ingredients listed in the article, as well as the names and locations of the cited attacks, and tucked the parchment amongst the stack in his briefcase for later perusal. Then, he finished working his way through the paper, which included not one but
Draco wanted to touch him, wanted to reach out and curl his arm around Potter’s elbow. And he thought maybe, just maybe, Potter wouldn’t resist. He hoped it wasn’t just the drink, because his head was swimming slightly, but he would swear there was something
Draco perched on the cushion of one of the misshapen chairs, which was as soft as sponge cake, causing him to splay inelegantly. Potter smirked as Draco resettled himself with a glare, crossing his legs at the knee.
Potter huffed a laugh and took her skinny hand in his, lowering his lips to the satin of her glove and looking up at her through his lashes. “Couldn’t skip out knowing you’d be here. Nice of you to keep an eye on my date for me,” Potter said, slanting a look at Draco as he straightened. “He gets fussy when I’m late.”
“You most certainly are not. Particularly not when Potter is involved.” She dropped onto Draco’s bed and crossed her legs, running the sharp points of her manicured fingertips over the buttons of the discarded Tom Ford shirt.
“God, yes, it’s okay.” He nipped at Harry’s full bottom lip, tugging it between his teeth, feeling Harry go even more tense. “Very okay.”
Draco gasped. He released the hand tangled in Potter's hair and threw it over his eyes, covering his face so that even in the dark, Potter wouldn't be able to see the burning flush in his cheeks. Potter continued to mouth at his cock as that finger circled his rim. The sensation was tickling and maddening, and it had the liquid heat in Draco's gut churning and spitting sparks into every one of his nerve endings. Draco spread his thighs as far as they would go and lifted his knees, so his feet floated away from the mattress, giving Potter unrestricted access to… everything.
There was a grimace painted across Potter’s face. “Uh, hey. Quick medical question. Where exactly is the femoral artery?”
"Ah, so you wanted them to publish those photos from the holiday you took in Ibiza two winters ago, or the comments about your arse in the Society Section after the Bright Magical Futures Fundraiser."
"I could be Harry's friend," Emile said, and Draco spun around to glare at him, just in time to catch the waggle of Emile's eyebrows paired with his salacious smirk.
He didn’t really know why he said it. Weasley was Marcus’ patient, and Potter wasn’t his responsibility. But the man just looked so bloody shattered, and it made Draco’s stomach twist and ache.
Draco’s hands tightened into fists, but he held his tongue, if only for his mother’s sake. He almost felt bad for her. Ever the faithful wife, Narcissa accepted her sentence without complaint or any sign of remorse. She maintained her mask of Pureblood grace and elegance as their sentences were read and Lucius was spared the Kiss and all of them a lifetime in Azkaban thanks to a clever bit of word-smithing, a hearty donation to the war relief fund, and a carefully articulated list of names that incriminated a fair number of Ministry higher-ups.
It felt risky to leave her on her own so soon, but he'd yet to give her the keys to the wards on the potions storage, and it seemed the perfect opportunity for a trial run. He was going to leave the shop in her stead, after all.
“So nice of you to come visit me,” she said, and Draco suffered a brief flash of guilt, though very short-lived.
and my terribly important award.” Draco brandished the thing in Harry’s face, and Harry snorted into his whisky.
“My mum will torture you, you know that don’t you? She’s already spoken to Mrs. Fitzpatrick from her gardening group and Mrs. Rosenblum from down the road about whether they’ll be bringing their daughters. Have you met Dora Fitzpatrick’s daughter? Harry, she’s horrible. She has a voice like a dormouse and a face like a slapped arse."
Draco crumples the parchment with the Apparition test results in his fist and tosses it into the nearest bin. The door to the Apparitions Department snaps shut behind him, almost rudely, and Draco glares at it. It’s a stupid test anyway, and completely rigged. So what if he landed a little left of his intended location, dropping just shy of the fountain in Hyde Park? And what was the mother thinking, leaving the pram right there where anyone could go knocking into it? While Draco may not always have the best aim when it comes to Apparition, he is quick to cast, and he managed a Wingardium Leviosa just in the nick, floating the pram back to dry land. The mum was not quite so lucky. But the office witch didn’t have to go so far as to mark the test form, not once, but twice with the red FAILED stamp. He didn’t
But then you show up and take that from me. Everything I've ever wanted, you take from me." The words hissed between his teeth, seething things that burned their way out like acid. Because Draco had been holding it in for
"Wait a moment," Draco said as Potter's words caught up with him. "That's the first Snitch you ever caught?"
Draco lifted an eyebrow at that. What bloody plans? Beyond getting Harry the hell out of the DMLE, they hadn't discussed any
Draco resisted the urge to bruise him, to put teeth marks into his neck or allow his nails to bite deep enough to draw blood. It wasn't fair. All Harry ever did was mark him, in ways both seen and unseen. It was just one more way that Potter held power over him, and he hated it.
Emile shrugged. "I wanted to iron out the details first, make sure there was no way you could refuse."
It was no matter. It was a relief, honestly. Draco had an incredibly productive day and his desk remained clear of poisoned coffees and Potter’s presumptuous arse. And if Draco made more trips past the DMLE than necessary, it was only because it was on the way to the canteen and Draco needed another cup of tea, some biscuits, a file from Mildred in accounts payable, oh, and would you look at that? Draco’s tea was empty again, he ought to get some more.
It felt bloody fantastic and Draco had no doubt that if Potter kept it up, they would both end up coming in their trousers in a matter of minutes. Draco thought it would be a terrible waste if he never even got Potter out of that stupid uniform.
Draco could finally admit that his insistence on healing Harry was more than an interest in Harry’s continued safety, though that mattered too, of course. But it felt like a sort of test, one Draco had administered himself. It was an opportunity to prove something to Harry, though as to what exactly, he wasn’t sure. Perhaps that Draco was competent? That he was innovative and resourceful? That he deserved to stand at Harry’s side as more than a party date? It was silly, really. But it didn’t change that he wanted it all the same.
And then he left. They didn't kiss goodbye or say anything really, just a thanks for the fuck and see you next week, but it was better that way. That's what Draco told himself, at least.
Draco recoiled, his back bumping against the cold tile of the bathroom wall. This time, Potter advanced on him. Draco's brain was scrambling for some kind of explanation. Part of him wanted to turn tail and run for the door, because there was no way that this was going to end in anything other than humiliation. Potter was toying with him. He had to be. But another part of him, a part that Draco tried desperately to subdue, wanted to believe it was real, wanted to believe that the darkness in Potter's eyes wasn't borne of cruelty and hatred, but something else.
He spent the previous night tossing and turning, cursing himself for cutting Potter off before he could tell Draco about his mysterious date. At the time, it had seemed an act of self-preservation, but since Draco is masochistic enough to wear a suit of velvet, he is certainly masochistic enough to torture himself endlessly over whom Potter chooses to stand at his side on his big night.
Draco had laughed more in Potter's presence than ever in his bloody life. It was a painful thought, and it made Draco's stomach churn. The wrestling and giggling eventually shifted into contented sighs and soon later, Potter dozed off with one arm thrown across Draco's chest and his face tucked into the crook of his neck, soft huffs of breath against the side of his face. He'd extracted himself from Potter's embrace and gathered his things. His shirt was well and truly ruined, so he stole a faded t-shirt from Potter's dresser. It was one he wore all the time, with some Muggle band called The Clash scrolled in cracking letters across the chest. He hesitated over Potter's sleeping body for a moment, then pulled the blankets from the foot of the bed and draped them over him. Potter snuggled into them with a sigh, and Draco all but fled to the Floo, anything to avoid examining that persistent clawing in his chest. The ache that echoed even now.
Weasley sighed and crushed the empty cup in his fist, tossing it in the nearest bin. "Stop Harry when he's got his mind set? Bloody unlikely. I've known Harry long enough to know that he's only happy when he's in the thick of it."
She laughed — a cruel biting sound without a stitch of humour. “Draco, you were in too deep before you even stepped foot through the door.”
It wasn't until the figure ducked past the threshold that Draco realised it was a woman clad in Auror red, with broad shoulders and heavy, dark brows drawn down into a menacing scowl. Eryn positively quivered at the sight of her.
They discussed his latest inventions, his commitment to the ethical harvesting of Unicorn horn, and the wide variety of uses for Gurdyroot. All the while, Luna bobbed her head and sipped her tea, her eyes fixed on Draco.
about him. Not often, at least. Potter is just… fit. And sort of funny. And looks dashing in Draco's designs. It isn’t something Draco encounters very often. He likes it.
Draco chewed his lip and ran his thumbnail up the seam of the door frame. He didn’t want to look at Potter, to see what his face was doing, if he was laughing at Draco, annoyed, angry, indifferent.
He couldn't make the visions stop. Draco tried for years to forget them, to push them to the corners of his mind to gather dust. But they were always there, waiting for his vigilance to slip. Potter's face, crumpled and lost in pleasure, haunted him, surfacing even when Draco was buried to the hilt in someone else. The flush that spread from his cheeks to his chest, the bottom lip clamped between his teeth, the way his eyes stayed trained on Draco, pupils blown wide, unable to look away. Fuck, he was beautiful like that. Draco used to spend hours taking him apart. The exquisite torture of it satisfied Draco's urge to make Potter suffer far better than any cruel joke or a backhanded curse. He adored reducing Potter to begging, pleading for Draco to give him more, more,
“Alright, James Dean, rein it in. As if the bloody motorbike wasn’t enough, next you’ll be swanning about in a leather jacket.”
Draco stills and is suddenly very aware of his position, on his knees and in direct eye line with the zipper of Potter’s trousers.
She smiled once more at Harry and swept out the door into the warm summer evening humming to herself.
Watts’ silencing charm felt like cotton in Draco’s mouth, but he grinned anyway. As soon as they released him, he’d make sure McConnell paid his debt. Draco wasn’t going to waste four-of-a-kind just because Potter needed to flex his authoritative muscle. Those six-hundred galleons were his, fair and square.
“Well, colour me impressed,” Draco said, sitting back in his chair and appraising Potter with fresh eyes. “And here I thought I was about to blow your tiny mind.”
"I don't fucking care if you vanish it, Harry. I'm offended that you even wear shirts. I mean honestly, look at you," he said and sunk his teeth into the tender skin just to the left of Harry's nipple.
A faint tinge coloured her round cheeks, and she adjusted the cat-eyed glasses perched on the tip of her nose before disappearing again.
Potter purses his lips and squints one eye in scepticism, then laughs. “So, you’ve been hiding? Blending in? That doesn’t sound like you.”
"I'll admit it took me a little longer to find my way than it should have. But you wouldn't believe what I had to do to get here. I broke laws, Potter. At least three that I can think of."
Lovegood placed the two matching teacups in front of her and delicately poured the steaming liquid nearly to the brim. She scooted it across the table, managing to keep it from spilling over the lip, but Draco had to duck his head down to sip from the cup so it wouldn't slosh into the saucer. He felt more than a little silly holding the tiny cup, as if he were an adult attending a child's tea party, seated between stuffed animals, rather than across from a grown woman.
Weasley and Hermione were a constant fixture as well, though by the third day, they had to take shifts so Hermione could take a shower, and Weasley could swing by the DMLE to put in his statement and take care of some paperwork.
Once the door shut behind him, Draco gasped in a deep lungful of chilly night air and fumbled through his coat pocket for his lighter. As soon as the cigarette was lit, he took a shaky inhale. He could only hope no one saw his little episode, particularly Potter. That was the last thing he needed.
The taps shut off a few minutes later, and the door creaks again. Draco can just make out the soft padding of Harry’s feet on the hardwood in the hallway, followed by the groan of his bedroom door across the hall, then the click of the lock. And that’s it. Draco can’t hear Harry anymore. He sighs.
Potter smiles, fully this time, and without warning, throws an arm around Draco’s waist — and then they’re hurtling through space.
"Pansy told me that the best way to bribe you is with sweets. I'm very fond of them myself. I wasn't sure what flavour you would prefer, so I got them all."
The air punched out of Draco’s lungs. His hands scrabbled against Harry’s back to settle on his arse and squeezed just as Harry rolled his hips.
Draco turned, scooping up the bag with his few belongings settled next to the vinyl chair he'd lived in for nearly five days. He convinced his legs to move, to take him to the door and out of that room — placed one foot in front of the other until he was over the threshold. He heard Hermione's gasp, and Weasley's happy bellow, and then the door shut behind him.
He holds out a hand to Harry, who is still sprawled across the steps looking ruffled, pink, and completely edible. Draco takes a moment to commit that sight to memory, because it’s bloody lovely. Harry lets Draco pull him up and corral him, stumbling backwards, through the entrance to Draco’s shop, the little bell chiming overhead.
Draco didn't have anywhere else to go, anyway. He had missed his Portkey by hours, but that didn't matter. There was no point in going anywhere until he knew Harry's fate. So, he would stay there, in the hospital until he knew. And then? Well. He'd figure that part out when he got there.
“Hardwood floors, recently refinished. And would you look at that crown molding? To die for!” she carried on.
. It’s inconsiderate. How do you think Ginevra feels? It’s barely been six months since they broke up officially and he goes around sticking his tongue down the throat of some slag he just fucking met.”
Malfoy talked with his hands. He gestured in wild, elegant arcs when describing things. He raked them through his pale hair frequently, twisted his paper napkin between his slim knuckles, spun the ring on his index finger, fluttered over the base of his wine glass, always moving. And when he wasn’t being a total prat, he was almost nice to listen to. He rambled on a lot and insulted Harry at every turn, but did it in that pleasantly deep voice and luxurious accent. Harry almost caught himself laughing at Malfoy’s jokes more than once.
"I don't think I'm reading too deeply between the lines of that utterly pathetic excuse for an explanation when I call you a bloody liar, Draco Malfoy. So, what? Was it bad?"
"Do not insult me," Emile chided, but his expression was gentle. "You were like an open wound when I met you. Pardon me if I do not want to see you in pieces again."
In truth, Draco was fairly certain most people had forgotten his birthday this year. Pansy invited him for a drink, of course. Blaise said he might show up if he could get off work in time (“The Ministry waits for no one, Draco. Not even you. Especially not you.”) But it was fine. It wasn’t as if he expected the fanfare of his childhood birthdays. And anyways, Pony rides and party games weren’t quite to his tastes anymore.
yellow, Harry!” Draco gasped. “Would you suggest that marigold is the same as sunflower? That butternut is no different from mustard?”
It was properly dark, but the balcony was lit with fairy lights and the domed glass of the Ministry of Magic glowed with life behind him. It was festive and sort of nice, if you were sappy enough to be a sucker for the holidays.
Potter put his hat back on but didn’t buckle the little strap. He kicked the bike to life with a roar and went speeding down the street at a horrifying speed.
Draco reached out a hand to brush his thumb across the crest of Harry's cheekbone. He pulled his hand back to inspect his fingertip. "Is that glitter?"
Hermione and Weasley fell asleep on that tiny sofa, heaped atop each other like kittens. Even Draco dozed briefly, only to wake with a start and a crick in his neck when the door opened to reveal a slight Mediwitch Draco didn't recognise. She beckoned Draco to her.
Draco panicked. His wandless magic was shit. He’d practiced it a bit because Potter insisted on it, but Potter was like a bloody magical hurricane, and training wandlessly with him made Draco feel like a fumbling child. He did, however, manage a few minor spells, some of Potter’s greatest hits that he practiced just to spite him.
suck his cock like he’d never had anything better. No one would ever be more beautiful. Draco would never want anyone more than him.
Draco threw the potion out. He closed the biro full of scribbled notes — the one he hadn't reopened until tucked into that chair by the fire in his London flat.
The night wore on and eventually, everyone began to filter away. Ginny went back to the Burrow to stay with her mum and dad for the weekend before she had to return to Holyhead for practice. Dean went to meet his girlfriend at some Muggle club, while Pansy and Luna had managed to disappear hours prior without so much as a goodbye, so wrapped up in their strange love as they always seemed to be.
Draco didn’t see or hear from Potter for days. The case was splashed all over the front page of the Prophet and, from the looks of it, Potter was going to be caught up between depositions and court for the rest of the week. Draco tried to swing by his office once or twice on his way to get his afternoon coffee or tea, only to find it vacant. He even left a takeaway cup on Potter’s desk, and found it gone the next day – either cleared away, or perhaps consumed.
Draco returned to his own flat, eventually. Harry's clothes were comfortable, but they weren't suitable for public viewing, and they'd have to go out sooner or later. In fact, they had dinner plans the very next evening, and Draco fancied a trip to Harrods to get Harry a new shirt.
Draco can’t bloody stand it and excuses himself to the loo, where he splashes cold water on his face and glares at himself in the mirror for far too long. Now that his scarf hangs loose around his neck, he can see a red and purple mark left by Harry’s teeth on the side of his throat, and he scowls. He buttons his shirt all the way to his chin and shucks the scarf and coat. It’s too much in the humid air of the restaurant, anyway.
"Me? Nice try, Potter," Draco replied with a click of his tongue. "Bet you'd love to see Bridges put me to task."
Harry just shrugged them off with a weak laugh. He hated that everyone assumed he did it for the showy heroics, rather than just being, as Malfoy would say, a self-sacrificing idiot. It wasn’t as if Harry thought deeply about it before jumping into dangerous situations. He only saw the lives at risk and the small window of opportunity wherein he could protect those lives, and the rest was just instinct.
“That’s…alarming. And weirdly competitive. But also, kind of sweet?” Harry said with a small, confused smile.
“Listen,” Draco said, letting the tips of his fingers brush over Harry’s shoulder, a comforting touch. “Don’t make any decisions tonight. You don’t have to. No one expects you to. For once, Harry, just live. And see what happens.”
curling madly around his grinning face, the dimples in his cheeks deep and his eyes sparkling. It was only then that Draco realised Potter’s glasses were gone, lost somewhere in the wild fucking, though he couldn’t pinpoint when. He was once again unsettled by the intensity of Potter’s eyes without the barrier of his glasses, and he was transported back to the moment at his flat, Potter stretched out on his sofa, looking up at Draco, lips pressed against his wrist.
To prove his point Draco started to dance. He moved his hips, spun with flourish, pointed at Potter, and sang, “
"Shows how little you know about me." Draco plucked a cigarette from the proffered pack and placed it between his lips.
There were quite a few promising options for future cases. There was an older gentleman who’d grown wings and a beak like an over-sized chicken, seemingly overnight, and a woman whose left arms went rigid as stone every quarter-hour. He sorted an unidentified dancing curse and a case of unexplained levitation to the maybe pile. He tried to maintain his focus, but the stack of Marcus’ files weighing down his outbox continued to draw his eye. He’d signed them all immediately, trusting Marcus’ diagnoses implicitly. But there was something about that Auror that didn’t sit right with him.
Potter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something, like he wanted to argue, but before he could continue, Draco cut him off. He was already sick of the conversation and was kicking himself for allowing his tongue to run away with him.
Harry's friends were always touching him. Always had an arm around his shoulders, a hand at his wrist, tousling his hair and tugging his collar. And Harry only blushed and donned that crooked, beguiling smirk, and it took all of Draco's willpower not to smack their hands away and wrap himself around Harry, because he
Draco took one of Potter’s hands in his and scrubbed the blood from his fingers, then did the same with the other, while Potter watched him from his slump with half-lidded eyes.
Draco stumbled to his bedside table and fished out a large vial of Dreamless Sleep. He swallowed its entire contents and let himself fall backwards into bed and sink into the abyss, still dressed, shoes still on his feet.
“I’m fine, Charlie,” Potter said, patting the hand against his face, his words slurred together. “I promise. Malfoy fixed me up. I’m almost as pretty as before, see?” He grinned with teeth.
"I swear, I Vanished that thing two days ago," Harry groaned as Draco rolled off him, rubbing at his bruised forearm.
“Fucking hell, Potter.” Potter chuckled again and Draco pawed at his face with a blind hand to shut him up. “Quiet now, you insatiable monster. Let me sleep.”
Draco slid his middle finger from Potter’s body and added his ring finger alongside it, feeling as Potter tightened almost painfully around him. Potter let out another shuddering exhale and the tension in his muscles eased, balled fists releasing and fingers curling around the belt. Potter used the leverage and rolled his hips, then gasped as Draco twisted his fingers to brush over his prostate.
“Yeah, I’m not entirely sure that’s true. But it doesn’t matter. Clearly, whatever you said to that bloke left an impression.”
But Potter just stood there, holding out his wand, and Draco heaved a sigh. He took it gingerly in his hand.
,” Draco said immediately and without hesitation. “I have all my cards on the table here, Harry, and I need to know if you’re going to change your mind in the morning.”
Lilian showed Draco the basics of the Muggle phone. It was a frustrating contraption, and sometimes screens would open up that Draco didn't know how to get out of. The process of typing was unbearably slow, but Lilian promised it would get easier with practice.
"No, I mean just you and me." Potter rolled his head on the pillow to look at Draco, and Draco frowned.
He would have preferred to mix it carefully, but there wasn't time. Weasley's voice was going hoarse from all the shouting, and he was pretty sure Bridges was bleeding from both her nose and one of her ears, and even Potter couldn't fight a damned army on his own. So Draco hastily cast a Bubble Head charm, sent a prayer to Circe, Merlin, and that Jesus fellow the Muggles were always flailing over, and dumped the powdered Death-Cap residue into the jar of liquified spider legs as carefully as he could, so as not to cause any disturbance on the surface of the liquid or allow puffs of the powder to escape into the air. He pulled the stopper from the distilled Angel's Trumpet with his teeth and poured the entire thing into the jar in a steady stream. He tossed the empty vial aside.
It’s Christmas in July! In honor of this totally made up holiday, please enjoy this semi annual update 😅 If you are just reading this story for the first time, I’m sorry. If you have been following it for a while, I am sorrier still! You all have the patience of saints. As a check in, I fully intend to finish this fic but it should be obvious by now I have no idea when. The end is written and so are a few key scenes along the way, but I honestly don’t know what I want to do with the middle. So with that in mind, what are you hoping to see? I am open to ideas 😁 I probably won’t be able to incorporate them all, but I’m sure I will find all of them inspiring! As always, thank you for reading!
He grinned and squeezed Harry's hands, rubbing his thumb against the bones of his wrist with no more pressure than a butterfly's touch.
"In that case," Potter replied, grinning, touching his forefinger to Draco's paw, "pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Ferret."
He lifted his quill and notepad like a sword and shield and regarded Malfoy over the top of them. He was proud of himself for sounding so professional when his id was screaming at him to pin his house guest to the couch and answer Malfoy's incessant flirting with all the pent-up sexual frustration of the last few days (which was causing his left eye to twitch and his trousers to feel rather too small at the moment).
All laughter left immediately after the Auror began stroking him again and was replaced by gasping moans. "
"Now that we have established we are both of a right mind... Shall we escape to my bedroom before an elf catches us? I have many, many plans for you."
He gingerly withdrew his softening prick from Draco's arse, making both of them hiss and Draco wince.
He slumped against the wall to brood, counting down the minutes 'til he was allowed to leave, heedless of the risk of wrinkling his tuxedo. Out of habit, he went to adjust the lay of his glasses on the bridge of his nose, but his fingers brushed the black velvet of his mask instead. The vision enhancing charm he used to wear the stupid thing (at Hermione's firm insistence--
Draco grabbed what was left of the drought from the desk and downed it like a professional. He dropped the bottle back onto the Auror's work space and took a few slow steps back.
Ultimately, however, he had to accept that Granger was there to help out of the Gryffindory goodness of her heart. And if he couldn't trust the brightest witch in an age, who could he?
Harry rocked on his toes when Draco spanked him and snorted. He swiped a taste of the sauce out of the pot. It was quite good, actually. Nice consistency, flavourful blend of seasonings. He voiced his opinion and earned a pleased little smile from Draco.
Harry let that roll around in his skull for a minute. It still didn't sound all that complimentary to him, but he understood the weight of the statement a little better, at least. (And Merlin, it was a wonder Draco wasn't more screwed up with an upbringing like that.)
He stomped over to where Draco stood in the relative privacy of a copse of trees and pointed his wand at his own neck to cast a broad glamour over the whole thing since the prat refused to do it for him. He then planted himself in the grass with his back against a broad trunk and looked challenge up at Draco.
Harry was graced with a smile from a handsome stranger. He wasn't sure if it was flirtatious or merely friendly, but it was nice all the same. He straightened his posture and smiled back. The bloke held his gaze a moment longer, took a delicate sip of his drink, then turned to weave his way back into the crowd with what might have been a parting nod.
"Then it's true," he murmured, voice barely a whisper, thoughts racing, tumbling from his lips. "Pansy helped... She must have. But why? She works with the Healers at St. Mungo's, you know. I heard a rumor that muggle medical technologies may be integrated by the Healers in some sort of program starting in the next few years--very few people know about it. She's high enough in staff to have known... She very well could have produced the needle," Draco's stomach gave a queasy lurch. "I only know because I still use my father's connections to keep up. He told me about it recently, but nothing has been totally confirmed. Even the program is just an idea for now... She might have had to do research or something, or made an underling do it to avoid the extra work." The more he talked, the more he picked up steam until he was nearly frantic.
Hermione put her fists on her hips, bunching the fabric of her oversized jumper. "I didn't know I had to! Because
"I've heard of cake and ice cream served together but this is a first for me. Is this what ice cream cake tastes like? Just cake with ice cream on top?"
Potter continued petting him, neglecting to comment on Draco's nudity or the fact he still occupied his lap. "Potion wore off then?" he asked, though the answer was obvious.
Taking the parchment it bore in exchange for a bit of rice, he settled back in his chair and looked over Malfoy's reply. He was surprised Malfoy had agreed to come to the Ministry, though of course he had a long list of terms and conditions to do so.
Draco continued to press against the special button that made Harry spasm as he slowly slipped off his cock and began to lick the head like a delicious lolly--lapping with the broad end of his tongue and probing the slit with the stiffened tip.
He couldn't help but grin at the final outcome, particularly with the unmistakable tenting in Potter's skirts.
"Let's get this over with," he mumbled through a grimace. "The sooner I embarrass myself the sooner I can go."
Draco appeared to be dozing when Harry finally returned but he cracked an eye open at the sound of a floorboard creaking.
"And since when do you have a Floo?" Pansy interrupted, attempting to look past Draco and into the room. "You're at his house already?" she gasped. "Why didn't you tell me immediately, and why am I not allowed to know who he is?"
"Like this? You want more?" His voice was rough and low as he half-spoke, half-groaned. "I haven't just... Used fingers in a while... I forgot how fucking tight it feels inside."
When Harry arrived at work the next morning, he discovered Malfoy's coat slung over the arm of the sofa where he'd apparently left it. Seeing it triggered a flood of visceral memories: Malfoy stripping down to his trousers for his impromptu nap, the lewd and lascivious way he'd eaten his dinner, the Snog to End All Snogs. (That bloody kiss had been a revelation in and of itself).
"Who says it's foreplay?" Draco smirked up at Harry with an evil twinkle in his eye. "You denied me my chance to explore your body properly before, remember? Just be glad I'm not so cruel as to leave you waiting an hour while I poke," Draco pressed a finger against Harry's sphincter again, "and prod." His finger circled the hole as if to slip inside, but instead Draco slid the tip away and across the underside of the Auror's testicles.
Malfoy looked like he intended for Harry to go alone. That wasn't going to happen, at least not without Ron in the office. Harry didn't think Malfoy would try to hurt him while he was occupied with the memory (which was rather surprising to realize), but the Slytherin couldn't be given the opportunity to snoop with so much confidential and classified information laying around.
"The tortellini was magnifique," Draco purred. There was a light tinge of color across the bridge of his nose. Behind him still sat three empty bottles of champagne, most of which Draco embibed alone. He lifted his free hand, sans glass, and caressed the jaw of his date affetionately. "Have I told you yet how hansom you look? Glasses, no glasses..."
Draco rolled his eyes. It became immediately apparent that this Auror, Briggs, according to the name on her tarnished, scratched-up badge, was not going to make this easy. It was no matter, really. Draco had plenty of experience dealing with low-level grunts like her. It was all so tedious and rising to the bait would do nothing but incense her further, and yet, he found he couldn’t quite help himself.
Potter agreed to meet Draco at the tapas bar at seven on Saturday evening. It was a lively little place — the perfect combination of comfortable and chic with its white marble tables surrounded by caramel-coloured leather chairs. The kitchen was open so patrons could see the chefs wielding spatulas and frying pans with practised ease. The centre of the room was dominated by a high-top bar, where bartenders mixed cocktails and poured wine. Servers flitted around the room in long aprons, ducking the plates of food as they floated out of the kitchen.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Difficult to the very end, aren’t you? Fine, fine. Come on. I’ll treat you to the worst dinner of your life.”
The gnawing ache in Draco's belly refused to ease that morning, and it was all that propelled him down the stairs to the dining room. He would have rather stayed in bed.
Draco caught movement in his peripheral and turned to see Potter jumping from the vehicle. The coiled ropes trailed behind him as he closed the distance between the car and the dragon.
“Ceiling beam came down,” Harry admitted. “Nicked me. Bled like crazy, but nothing serious. Healers patched me up. Scar should fade. They usually do.”
Lovegood smiled at the compliment and took Draco's hand, holding it for far too long to be appropriate and gazing into his eyes until he was forced to look away. She gave his hand a gentle pat, and to Draco’s relief, dropped it.
The press of Harry’s mouth against his own was soft. Too soft. His lips were wet, and he smelled of chlorine, liquor, and that warm wood and sweet honey scent that made Draco drunk.
“That makes three of us, though the anticipation is most invigorating,” Marcus said, grinning as he dropped onto the rolling stool in front of Mary’s chair. He leaned a casual elbow on the exam cart positioned next to him, but Draco could see the tension in his shoulders and the way his dark eyebrows bunched together, belying his nervousness.
Draco chuckled because he knew that, obviously. “Then why do you look like someone pissed in your pudding.”
Draco gave a triumphant grunt as he produced a fresh pot and unscrewed it with shaky hands. He probably shouldn't have had that last shot of espresso, but the café across from his flat stayed open late, and even though it wasn't the best coffee, it did the trick.
She bats at him, but her cheeks are tinged with a happy flush. For all Pansy titters and snipes, she only wants what everyone wants — to be appreciated and admired. It doesn’t matter how many times a stranger calls you beautiful or handsome, lusts after your photos, or promises to call. A compliment or the starry-eyed gaze of someone beloved holds ten times the weight.
looking for Potter that he doesn’t notice Theo Nott sidling up to him until the man is speaking into his ear.
The problem was that each recorded case of successful wand sharing was between bonded pairs—couples who could channel their magic through one another culminating in a startling increase in casting power. He and Potter certainly weren’t bonded. Hell, they weren’t even friends. And yet there was no arguing with the fact that Potter’s wand responded beautifully,
He looked windswept and pink-cheeked when he came strutting through the door, clad in the leather jacket and slim jeans that
Potter sighed, his breath forced out through his nose as he righted himself on the sofa, his elbows on his knees. He scraped a hand across his face. He wasn't wearing his glasses and, while his gaze on Draco was wandering and fuzzy, his eyes were bright.
It was Pansy who pulled him out, Pansy who stormed straight into his office, dragged what was probably his sixth cup of coffee from his shaking grip and told him to
Draco stepped forward and dropped one knee onto the mattress next to Potter. He pushed him down onto the rumpled sheets and Potter went easy, flopping back with a whoosh of breath. Draco dropped his weight and indulged in the hard lines of Potter’s muscles splayed out beneath his body. He buried his nose into the base of Potter’s throat, where his scent was the strongest, then rolled off and onto his side, pulling Potter with a tug on the wrist. Potter didn’t resist. Instead, he curled around Draco and held him close, with a hand flat against Draco’s stomach and nose against the back of Draco’s neck, his breaths tickling. Their legs tangled together beneath the blankets.
Briggs’ eyes flashed. Draco knew it was probably a bad idea to antagonize her, but damn it all, he was
He didn’t tell Ginny that there had, in fact, been photos in his pants, though he’d never had the guts to look at them. She’d never let him live it down.
Draco had attended numerous events like the Ministry’s annual Foundations for Futures Gala at Noah’s side. He was also well aware that when Potter bothered to show up to such things, he arrived fashionably late, or, more often than not, well past fashionable and just bloody
Bridges went barrelling in after them, taking down another chunk of the wall with her wand to accommodate for her massive breadth.
It felt strange to be in Weasley’s home alone and without Potter, so Draco didn’t linger. He went straight to the fireplace and, pinching a bit of powder between his fingers from the box on the mantel, called out for home.
As soon as he was gone, Draco sank into the recently vacated exam chair, placed his hands over his face, fingers spread wide to cover his eyes, and laughed.
“If you say something as filthy and depraved as you’re thinking right now, I swear to god Potter, I’ll shove your arse right on the floor.”
The next morning dawned and Draco felt as if he were blinking away a dream. A slight thudding at the back of his skull informed him he’d had a bit too much to drink and he winced against the bright morning light. He pushed up until his legs were dangling off the edge of the mattress as he ran a rough hand across his face. And when he saw the dirty sheet wadded on the floor, he groaned and vowed to never drink again.
Draco was hit by a wall of sound and warmth. The room beyond was sparkling. Fairies danced across the ceiling, and Pansy's chandelier cast glittering golden light around the room. The furniture had been pushed against the walls, where people heaped atop them, laughing with drinks in hand. The floor, left wide open, was filled with clusters of people dancing, arms thrown around each other, swaying, jumping, and spinning beneath the shimmering lights.
And Potter would take it beautifully, Draco had no doubt. He was a fighter. He'd make Draco work for it, would resist the need to fall apart beneath him as Draco teased him open with fingers and tongue. Breaking him would be glorious. Draco always relished the moment when his partners gave in, when they stopped pretending they didn’t like the way Draco brushed merciless fingers across their prostate until they dripped onto the furniture, blushing red and embarrassed. He loved it when they moaned his name and pressed back against him as he fucked their arse with his tongue.
Potter stripped off his shirt, dropping it to the floor, then popped the button of his jeans with one hand, letting them hang open and loose on his hips. He wasn't wearing pants, and Draco's eyes helplessly followed the trail of dark hair beneath his navel to the distinct bulge between his legs.
“I thought I’d be married, of course,” Malfoy said. “To a pureblooded witch. Take over the manor. Go into politics. Have a couple brats - excuse me -
Draco sighed and put down his glass. He could still make it out of there if he wanted. He could walk right into the Floo and go home, sleep off the whisky, and return to life without knowing what Potter’s home looked like, without gleaning from it all those closely kept secrets. He could do it.
"Not that I have any desire to indulge your ridiculous obsession with Potter, but did you not see the news in the papers this morning?"
Harry rolled his hips forward and Draco skimmed from his arse to his back, beneath his shirt. He dragged fingernails down his spine, as he had earlier that evening, although now he let them bite into bare skin so he could hear Harry hiss.
"That isn't the point, Draco," Harry said with a roll of his eyes. "Joe Strummer doesn't have to know how to sing."
“Potter,” Draco said, clearing his throat and scrambling to regain his composure. “I thought you were my medical assistant.”
Draco ought to have made some joke about how he wasn’t aware Potter was capable of thought but could only manage a minute shake of his head.
“Everyone likes me,” Marcus said, kicking back in his chair and resting his heels on his desk. “I’m very likeable. Even you like me, and you don’t like anybody.”
No, Draco would not step foot in the Ministry unless there were cuffs around his wrists and a price on his head. And he had no intention of doing a single thing worthy of such a punishment.
“Among other places,” Potter said with another shrug, clasping his hands together on the table in front of him.
Potter ran a hand through his hair, mussing it again, only accenting how incredibly thick it was, that he definitely wasn’t balding, and it was very likely soft and fluffy, unlike that bastard Jeremy’s. Potter was grinning, but it was that same crooked one from the magazines and Draco wanted to lick it right off his face.
Draco found Pansy at the bar with two fingers hooked between the shiny black buttons of St Nicholas' red suit.
"Where's the nearest loo?" Draco said with his teeth at Harry's ear. "We're commandeering it immediately. I hope your silencing charms are strong, because we're going to make a lot of noise."
The humidity dropped the second they left the heaving press of bodies. Malfoy pressed a cold glass of water into Harry’s hand and spoke into his ear.
Draco winced. It was bad when Potter started cursing like a Muggle. "This was a mistake," Draco said, shaking his head.
“Don’t be coy, Potter,” Zabini said with a chuckle, low and deep like melted chocolate. “It has everything to do with you.”
“What are you talking about?” he snaps. “Nothing is going on between Potter and myself that is beyond an appropriate, working relationship. Client to proprietor. Very proper.”
Two Mediwitches stayed behind, wrapping Weasley’s wounds and monitoring his vitals. They avoided eye contact with Draco, the same as all the medical staff, though one of them gave him a nod and a tight smile as he made for the door.
Lovegood stretched out a hand and patted Draco’s arm gently. “Come see me any time, Draco. Even if it’s just to talk about Harry.” Then went to help her customers.
Draco spun on his heel and fled to the kitchen, where he drank an entire glass of water and then stood there with the tap running for as long as it would take for Potter to cover himself. Because even though Draco wasn’t that drunk, he was just a man — a man who hadn’t got laid since his arsehole ex-boyfriend started shagging the intern. Not that there hadn’t been offers, because there were plenty, thank you very much. Draco simply hadn’t the
“Certainly not! But I will wait until we aren’t surrounded by politicians and undercover reporters to do so.”
“Is this what you wanted, Potter?” Draco hissed, words coming out thick with lust. “Is this how you like it?”
Draco's breath caught in his lungs, and he hung there, suspended in mid-air for only a moment. With an anguished moan, the swelling pleasure within him burst and flooded outward from his centre to gather at the tips of his fingers and toes. But it didn't simply wash over him in a single rush. Wave after wave crashed over him until he couldn't see or hear or feel anything but heat pouring from his body. And then, that heat was filling him, pooling warm and wet deep inside of him as Potter slumped forward, his nose pressed against Draco's throat. His breaths gusted across the quickly cooling sweat on Draco's skin, and even that was enough to make him shiver, his skin so sensitive that the movement of air was too much.
“I should go talk to the family,” Marcus said, normally booming voice weary and weak. “I’m afraid they’ll set up camp in the hallway if I don’t.”
“You do. I can tell. You ought to be rolling in galleons, Potter. Why don’t you just buy a new one? Or a couple of new ones. I hear Greece is nice this time of year. Or perhaps Costa Rica?”
Draco suffered no such restraint. His hands were everywhere – splayed across Potter’s shoulders, dragging over his scalp, and buried in his hair. He wanted to feel him head to foot, to drag Potter against him completely so he could feel the hardness of his chest against his own, the heat of his hands gripping him, but Potter held himself back, and Draco would have precisely none of it. He grabbed a fistful of Potter’s robes and tugged him forward, at the same time arching his back and bowing his body to bring them together. And oh
Draco and Pansy spent the next hour chatting. It was nice to have her at his side again. It made conversations with the others much easier, too. She praised Draco in front of everyone — waxing poetic about his shop, the advances he'd made in medicinal potions, the lives he bettered. Draco warred between wanting to strangle her and hug her.
Draco watched from the shadows as she handed the cigarette holder to Potter, who inhaled as she did. He couldn’t hear what she said, but she mimed a rolling gesture with both willowy, gloved hands. Potter smirked around the jade mouthpiece, nodding with what Draco recognised as false sincerity, and then he exhaled his own cloud of smoke. It formed into a series of perfectly concentric rings and Madam MacDougal clapped, delighted.
Both Draco and Emile rounded on Lilian; Emile cursing and waving his hands, Draco shooing her back to the front of the store.
to his self-control. In fact, Draco was not too shy to admit much of anything. He flirted with Potter shamelessly and at every opportunity. And Potter, bless him, always responded with the same narrow-eyed wariness, as if unsure why Draco was practically drooling on his boots. Potter seemed to have no idea the effect his broad shoulders, bright eyes, and messy dark hair had on Draco – or everyone else, for that matter. It was fucking precious, and it made Draco want to wrap himself around him.
Potter was still in the papers all the time, but Draco stopped reading them. Sometimes Draco didn’t think about Potter for days and it was bliss. But then, without fail, he’d appear again, like a bad omen, and do something awful and Potterish, like volunteer with Wizards for Werewolf Wellness or donate obscene amounts of galleons to underprivileged squibs, and Draco would be forced to remember how much he fucking hated Harry Potter.
Malfoy laughed, but it wasn’t the usual cruel sort of laugh. It was deep and warm, and it made something in Harry’s stomach go all liquid and melty. Harry didn’t quite know what to make of that.
He willed his own hands to move and placed light, seeking fingers into the gap where Potter's jeans splayed open — a question answered with a hiss and groan. He pushed past the metal bite of the zipper to wrap his hand around the velvety hardness of Potter's cock. Potter's eyelids drooped, lashes fluttering as a crease formed between his brows. He leaned into the touch.
“Mm, that doesn’t bode well,” Draco said dryly, but Marcus only chuckled, keeping pace with Draco’s long-legged stride.
It was the strangest thing, because while everyone fawned over Harry, Harry hovered close to Draco. He kept one point of connection with Draco at all times — a hand at the small of his back, at his elbow, or an arm pressed against his side. And people noticed, because people noticed everything Harry Potter did. Draco kept waiting for the moment when Harry would realise that everyone could see and withdraw. But he didn't. He just left his hand wherever it landed, while Draco quietly died a little.
Potter cleared his throat. “Am I… interrupting something? I can just… go… or…” Potter yanked on his hand a bit harder, and Emile released it, only to throw it around Potter’s shoulder and pull him in close.
Draco had his suspicions about Lovegood and whether she might potentially be a conniving little sneak, and those suspicions were confirmed when Draco stepped through the front door of M.A.D. to find Charlie Weasley leaning against the counter, a magenta-feathered Fwooper hopping up his arm while Lovegood giggled.
"Yes," she said with a sharp nod. "The use of emulsified bloodroot and moondew to reduce the dosage and improve both longevity and efficacy was inspired."
“That’s too bad,” Draco said. “My new wards were incredibly clever. You would have been extremely impressed. I have it in my mind to be cross with you, after I spent all that time coming up with ways to singe your eyebrows off and blast you halfway to Belgium.”
at formal events. You drag around a date so you have someone to pose next to in photos, fetch you drinks, and chat with so you don’t mill around alone staring at your shoes all night,” Draco says with a wave of his hand. “And bonus points if they can carry on a conversation with the boring ones while you guzzle champagne.”
Draco attempted to lean casually against the back of the sofa, but no. It was too short, and he was slipping. He leaned into his hip. But that was fucking ridiculous. He looked like an idiot. Hands in pockets? No! Gods, what did he usually do with his hands in these sorts of situations?
It was already full summer again, and Harry dropped the arm around Draco’s shoulder to tug off his jacket as soon as they were out the door. The heat was stifling and humid, like wading through bathwater, and the sweat prickled on Draco’s brow. But unlike Harry, he kept his jacket on. It was part of the outfit, after all. And he looked striking in dove grey linen. Harry thought so too and had told him so every time he donned the Cucinelli suit.
“What do you think, Pans?” Draco uses his other hand to smooth the hair behind Potter’s ears. “Shorter on the sides, pushed back in the front?”
“Then that only leaves you one choice,” Malfoy said, one eyebrow twitching as his gaze returned to Harry’s own.
Potter nipped at Draco's lip, and, with a final twist of his wrist, Draco's pleasure crested and broke. With a gut-wrenching groan, he spilt himself, wet and hot, over Potter's hand. Through the haze, he heard Potter curse and his body tense, cock pulsing hard as he came seconds later. Potter held him gently as Draco's hips gave slight, abortive little thrusts through the aftershocks.
. It was interfering with Draco’s ability to hate him and if that wasn’t just the most inconvenient twist of events, he didn’t know what was. He was meant to be making Potter as miserable as he was, but instead, all he wanted to do was maybe lick Potter’s neck or put his hand in Potter’s trousers.
As the final seconds ticked away, Draco imagined chucking the Portkey into the Seine and going home. But, before he could change his mind, there was a familiar tug behind his navel, and with a dizzying
, because that means Harry does unbelievable, impossible magic in bed and that is the hottest thing Draco has ever heard and it will
Pansy laughed — and not the trilling giggle she gave when she was putting on airs, but the real one, the one that reached her eyes and came out throaty and soft. She shook her head gently. “I
“Can I get a Side-Along back to central London?” Draco asks her. He tips his empty cup in her direction. “Bit toe up.”
Yes, that was better. He didn't want to sound too fond. Didn't want Harry — Potter! — to get the wrong idea.
In the early hours of the morning, as the sky began to turn pink, Mark asked Draco back to his flat. Draco declined, his hangover already manifesting and causing an ache at the front of his skull. And he could only imagine what Mother would do if he wasn't home when she woke.
Draco had to drop his eyes to his shoes, because Emile’s effusive praise always made his cheeks heat. It was so sincere and heartfelt, and there were few things in the world Draco desired more than his dearest friend’s approval. Now that he knew it passed the test, he couldn’t wait to get Pansy through the doors, if only to watch her jaw drag on the floor.
Draco clicked his tongue at her, mouth twisting as he tried not to smile too broadly. He opened the envelope to find a simple card with a picture of flowers printed on the front, swaying gently in an unseen breeze. Inside, Mrs Marchbanks had signed her name and included a shiny Galleon.
"Harry's dating Sean Shilmore, the Keeper for the Falcons. He was at Pansy's party the other night. Didn't you see him?" Blaise explained, gesturing to the painfully attractive man guarding the rings at the far end of the pitch.
“I think I prefer Buttercream to Cornsilk,” Draco said, studying the two swatches in the late afternoon sunlight.
"No? What if I told you my injuries were serious? That they wanted to keep me in hospital? Nearly lost an arm." He tugged up his sleeve a bit further to show the bandages that curled all the way up his bicep.
“I always remember my promises,” Draco said, summoning his own glass of white wine and taking a delicate sip with a pointed look at Potter.
“Don’t I? I’ll admit, the clothes, the atmosphere, that part was for me. I’m selfish that way. But the rest? I think you need it.”
Blaise is shouting into a Muggle mobile that he uses to manage his clients outside the wizarding world in their civil cases against magical folk. Blaise is a litigator with an emphasis on Muggle and Wizard disputes, which means he’s the scariest kind of lawyer. He’s so good, he gets paid five hundred Galleons an hour just to fight with people. But he fights with Draco for free, because they’re mates.
There was nothing left to be had for it, so Draco propelled himself forward. He felt Potter's wards envelop him as the facade of the building rumbled and stretched to accommodate another doorway, this one shiny black with a gold number twelve beneath a door knocker shaped like a lion. A set of stairs unfolded from the landing, rolling to a stop at Draco's feet.
Draco was never someone to deny himself a thing he wanted – certainly not when that thing was trapped beneath his weight and looking up at him with such fiery intensity it made him ache – but something in the denial was sweetly addicting. Potter was drunk and pliant and Draco thought he could probably shove Potter over the edge, could just kiss him with tongue and teeth and Potter might give into him, but it was then that Draco realized he didn’t want it like that. He didn’t want to trick Potter into his bed, he wanted him to go freely, to submit to the desires he so obviously had, and do so without reservation. For once, Draco wanted to win the game without an ace up his sleeve, he wanted to win because his hand was the best and because he deserved it. He wanted Potter to let him win, fair and square.
Hating Potter became something Draco did unconsciously, passively. It was like breathing, like digesting, like blinking. Draco just hated Potter. He’d see Potter’s stupid face in the papers again, or he’d run into him with his foolhardy band of do-gooders at the new pub in Diagon Alley, and the feeling would just be there, as familiar as the feel of his wand in his hand. And Draco would think, there’s Potter, the bloke I hate.
“I most certainly would. And I’d call it a service to mankind.” He gave the box of clothes one last cursory look before giving it a little kick. “None of this will do, Potter. I’m afraid we’re going to have to take drastic measures. Give me your hand.”
Harry never thought of it like that. He’d clung to the last gift Sirius gave him like a lifeline to his godfather, a desperate attempt to feel close to him, even though it just made him miserable. Letting go of Grimmauld Place felt like lifting a weight from his shoulders that had been there so long he’d forgotten how it ached. And now it was gone, all he felt was an unbearable lightness.
On the Tuesday after the Quidditch game, Draco finally broke down and called Emile. He'd suffered yet another sleepless night, and woke with a shout to the pre-dawn grey, rain pounding against the windows.
And then he felt Potter’s breath against his skin, the scratch of his chin, the heat of his lips. Draco turned his face into the pillow and groaned at the first press of Potter’s tongue against his hole. There was nothing tentative about the way Potter pressed his face into Draco’s arse. The movements weren’t fluttering or reserved, but confident, hungry, and it felt fucking
Harry didn’t respond, just hummed noncommittally and turned his attention to the room around them. Draco found it so easy to forget that the world beyond their table even existed. Harry had that sort of effect on him; it was as if everything outside their little bubble just melted away to nothing.
Harry’s stomach was wound up in knots as he stepped out of the lift and into the penthouse foyer. He hadn’t spoken to Draco since the night they spent in bed together – nothing beyond the hasty and cowardly note Harry left on his bedside before doing a runner.
Draco didn't care for hospitals, though he'd spent plenty of time in conference rooms and Healers' offices discussing contracts and sales. But he avoided the patient wards. He hated that cloying scent of antiseptic, barely covering the stench of sickness, death, and infection. Cringed at the way everything was bleached white to hide the bloodstains — pristine and clean. False.
around to show the front page of the Lifestyle section, where Draco and Potter stood side-by-side at the Ministry gala.
Inside the pub was dark, dingy, and stunk of stale lager. The vast majority of the patrons were old men — worn, cracked, and rusted from too many years next to the sea. Harry found them a table at the back of the room, where the darkness almost enveloped them, and Draco sat while Harry went to get them drinks.
The slick slide of Harry’s tongue against his own had Draco twisting beneath his hand, all but begging Harry to stroke him harder, hold him tighter. But Harry didn’t relent. His palm moved slowly, a dry drag against Draco’s already aching cock. He nipped at Harry’s lips, tightened his grip around the back of his skull, rolled his hips, but all Harry did was chuckle, soft and sweet, against Draco’s lips.
Draco stepped closer, between Harry’s spread knees, and loomed over him where he sat. He pinched two fingers at the end of the strip of medical tape and yanked it off.
Draco's chair toppled backwards as he tripped away from the table, his legs ungainly and chest tightening until his breaths came in wheezing gasps.
Draco arrived at Grimmauld Place at six o'clock on the dot, only to find the wards shut tight. He frowned, checking his watch for the third time, which only confirmed that Draco was punctual as always. He yanked his sleeve back down over his wrist and pulled his cashmere scarf up around his neck, attempting to smother the feeling of disappointment that left him colder than the November air.
“It’s pretty lenient as far as sentences for accused war criminals go,” Robards explained, his lips curling in contempt.
“Fi-ine.” Ginny twirled her ginger hair between two fingers the way she did when she was thinking. “There’s always that girl who works with Hermione over at the Magical Creatures for Peace and Unity organization. Olivia?”
Potter appears in the papers. He makes a valiant attempt with the hair and looks rather nice, even though Draco thinks the Tom Ford suit he suggested would have been better than the trouser/t-shirt/blazer combination Potter selected. But it works. There is almost something charming about the mismatched quality of the look, along with the dishevelled hair and jaw already darkening with stubble, which is a very odd thought Draco doesn’t believe he’s ever had before.
"He's alive," she said, voice raw. "But only just. He's lost a lot of blood —" Her eyes flicked to Weasley's robes, and she tightened her grip on his hand.
Potter lifted his injured arm, and Draco turned his head on the pillow to watch, eyes cataloguing the stitches — intact, though somewhat irritated.
Draco expected the huffing-giggle, but was treated to something much lower – a throaty, gruff sort of chuckle, which was new.
And Draco knew that, of course. Everyone knew that. While Granger and Weasley were never treated to the same scrutiny beneath the spotlight as Potter, they made regular headlines in the media. Their relationship was reported on like a wartime romance, culminating in the perfect marriage. Naturally, that only resulted in further speculation on Potter's relationships. In one particularly nasty article, Skeeter even accused Potter of being jealous, of wanting Granger for himself and plotting against his best friend. It was shortly after that, Potter pronounced himself "kinda gay" (his words, obviously, since Potter was always prone to ineloquence), in an exclusive article published in
Draco chuckled. “She knows me too well. I was convinced everyone had forgotten all about it. Was resigned to a night alone. Felt terribly sorry for myself.”
Draco was babbling. He would have been embarrassed by it if he’d had the wherewithal to even think about it. But Harry was pounding into him with steady, powerful thrusts and Draco was riding back against him, never able to get deep enough, never able to feel enough of him.
And then two fingers became three, curving wickedly, and stars exploded across Draco's vision. He cried out, back bowed as his hands flew up to fist at his own hair.
A man with biceps like battering rams and an unfortunate crew cut was the first to approach. Draco sent him lumbering away with a haughty sneer and a rudely dismissive wave of his hand. There was no time for pleasantries; Draco was looking for something specific. Though he wasn’t exactly sure what that was, he was confident that he would know it when he saw it.
It took hours before Draco fell asleep, though he wasn’t sure he’d ever been more tired in his whole bloody life. His eyes ached and his head pounded as the alcohol leached from his bloodstream, but he watched the shadows that danced across the ceiling as they gave way to the watery grey of dawn. He heard the moment the wretched birds began to sing, when the traffic picked up, when the floorboards creaked and groaned as the upstairs neighbours started their morning shuffling.
Draco stilled, frowning down at the suitcases. There was an argument poised at the tip of his tongue, because she was wrong. Shutting everyone out forever was exactly what he intended to do. And to hear those words from Pansy Parkinson of all people was even more irksome. Draco attributed the length of their friendship to the fact that they were the same. That it was their prickly yet refined exterior that protected them. Pansy didn't harp on Draco to talk about his
"In the cupboard," Harry said. His eyes flicked away from the view to Draco, then he sighed. "I suppose that means you want me to make you one."
It was a PR disaster. Robards already had it in for Harry, certain that his position as Head Auror was in jeopardy. He pinned the entire thing on Harry, had him demoted to Vice instead of firing him, preferring to keep him under his thumb until Harry quit or snapped. But Harry didn’t want to give him the satisfaction.
Harry inhales sharply through his nose, shifting so they are pressed chest to chest, with one elbow propped on either side of Draco’s shoulders. Harry’s mouth is hot and wet, his tongue skilled, and Draco feels as though he’s been set aflame. His head swims, but isn’t sure if that is because he’s stopped breathing or an effect of Harry’s kiss. Is this what that stupid girl felt while kissing Harry on the dance floor? Certainly one didn’t have to
Draco studies the ground, watches a spider crawl out of a crack in the concrete. “Perhaps they were just so moved by your cause they were willing to donate their efforts.”
Harry frowned, but Draco didn’t drop his hand, instead gripped it tighter and dragged him towards the bedroom.
Harry groaned as Draco snapped his hips up hard. Harry tried to draw back, to roll his hips and fuck himself on Draco’s cock, but Draco held him fast by the hair.
Potter’s mouth bunched to one side, and he looked into the fire. He said nothing, and for some reason, Draco found that comforting.
At first, Potter looked confused, but his expression soon morphed to realisation, then rapidly back to anger. "That's why you — you've got it all wrong! It was nothing! You should have known that. The papers were always speculating. Why didn't you ask me? You didn't have to go and…"
Mark looked disappointed but handed Draco a bar napkin with a seemingly random string of numbers on it before disappearing into the London dawn with a last smile over his shoulder.
Draco slipped his icy fingers beneath Harry's jacket to press into the cotton of his shirt, between the leather and velvet — warm. Harry's head turned to where Draco was tucked against his neck, and he tilted it back to knock lightly against the helmet. Draco just held him tighter.
Draco should have anticipated the sharp ache that stabbed through his middle, but it took him by surprise all the same. He only hoped that his expression hadn’t spasmed to the same degree his heart had.
Potter placed the paper cup directly in front of Draco. Draco stared at it as if it would burst open and bite him, because this was Potter, who hated him, and he absolutely could not be trusted.
Draco spun on his heel. He stalked straight through Weasley’s silly little cabin and headfirst into the Floo. He crashed into his own sitting room, where he binned Potter’s shirt and threw himself into the shower.
Things moved very quickly after Draco and Marcus’ midday alcohol-fuelled conversation in the Horse Brass. They stayed far too late into the evening and the conversation devolved from serious discussions about their medical practice into unmitigated shouting as to whether cowboy boots were acceptable footwear for Healers in a hospital environment. Draco strongly disagreed, and when Marcus suggested they were no different from the Prada wingtips Draco sported, Draco nearly threw his martini in his face. The barkeep shuffled them out shortly afterwards.
He wandered much the same as before, until he mustered his courage and ducked into a nondescript café tucked between a bookseller and an antique shop. The scent of espresso and earl grey washed over him in a comforting wave. The place was cluttered and homey, potted plants sitting in the windows, half-wilted, while scarred tables with mismatched chairs scattered across the floor. It was early evening and there were only a few patrons lingering, huddled over notebooks or newspapers.
Potter's eyes refocused and settled on Draco, warming considerably. "Thank you. Hermione told me that if anyone could figure this out, it was you. And I've learnt to trust her instincts."
Potter dropped his hands. "Don't I? See, that's where I think you're wrong. I think I know plenty about you."
"Potter may put up with your shite, fairy, but I don’t got half his restraint. No one would care if I let a little hex slip here and there, if you were a little worse for wear at your next meeting. And they certainly wouldn’t be so sympathetic if I told them how you’d threatened me, how you’d tried to curse me, but I was quicker and smarter and bested you, no trouble.” She brandished her wand.
“Oh,” Draco says, sauntering into the room, running a finger along the spine of one of the many leather-bound books Blaise has certainly never read. “I was in the neighbourhood, wanted to see how you were doing.”
"It's like a drug, being with you!" he shouted, pushing to his knees and pointing an accusing finger at Potter. "I just want it all the time, even though all it does is make me sick and miserable. And I just
Harry was completely out of his depth. Was he supposed to act like things had changed between them? They clearly had, but maybe Draco didn’t think of it as anything more than an alcohol-induced tumble. Harry wasn’t even sure
Draco chanced a glance at Potter. Light danced in his eyes, and Draco could practically see the wheels turning in his mind.
Harry wobbled his head. "Bit weird, to be honest. You're not going to split up with me now that I'm without the fancy title? I know how you felt about the uniform. And the handcuffs."
of hate, jealousy, and gut-wrenching yearning. He feels that disobedient tear escape the corner of his eye and slip free, cutting a stinging, salty trail down his cheek.
Draco is a bloody genius, and were it possible, he would shake his own damn hand, because Potter almost looks presentable. Sure, he’s got a weird look on his face that is somewhere between a scowl and a blush, but even that looks becoming when his hair is so perfectly coiffed.
A server came bustling up to their table, spitting out the specials rapid-fire and in heavily accented English. But when he noticed it was none other than Harry Potter seated at his table, his prepared speech fumbled to a halt. The man’s eyes scanned Potter from boots to sloppy hair, pupils dilating as he went.
“Normally I’d say just about anything you do, but what I’m really asking is whether you’ve torn your stitches and I will be forced to sew you back together for…. What is it now? The third time?”
Draco shrugs, flippant, though his heart bangs against his ribcage and there is a tightness in his throat that makes him want to squeal like an idiotic girl, because Harry
Harry looked right at him, the deep green of his eyes glinting in the low light. “And that’s how you do it? You just ‘see what happens?’”
, like holding chilled skin next to an open flame, a momentary pleasure and a promise of pain if he drew too close to the fire.
Ron laughed loudly. “Right you are, mate. Right you are. Come on you great git, no more sulking. You’re missing your party.”
Draco sighed, the tension leaching from him as the air whooshed from his lungs. He let his forehead drop to Emile's shoulder, felt his friend's arms tighten around him.
"Then you know that potions labs and apothecaries all over England are being ransacked? We thought it was just petty theft at first; an addict looking for a fix, a bitter ex-employee, someone with a clear motive. But now, people are turning up dead."
Mrs Marchbanks was his favourite patient. Her arthritis kept her bedridden most of the time, but it did nothing to dull her razor-sharp wit. She’d eviscerated every other Healer Trainee to step through her door, but took to Draco immediately when he threatened to steal her jewellery and shave her head in her sleep if she didn’t behave.
Draco tugs once more, causing Potter to gasp outright, and a zinging thrill zips through Draco’s belly.
Harry scoots over until his thigh presses hot and hard against Draco’s. Draco knows it doesn’t mean anything, knows they’re all squished together, knocking elbows as they eat and talk, limbs liquor-loose. But Draco’s brain misfires anyway, the nerve endings in his thigh sparking to life. He tries not to stare too closely at the way Harry’s mouth moves when he talks, or the vibration of his laugh, because at this close a distance, it’s bound to make things worse.
The girl in the sequin shift absolutely melted, her hand pressed against her chest. "That's so romantic! Do you want to come with us? We don't mind!" Her friends nodded enthusiastically.
The pale blue eyes currently trained on Harry’s own swim slightly, then flash, swirling into Draco’s sharp, mercurial stare. The eyes are always the first to go. The jaw is next — narrowing and angling, cheekbones hollowing to devastating depths. The lips thin slightly and the nose elongates to aquiline elegance. The hair pales and lengthens, tumbling across one newly arched brow in fine strands like corn silk. Harry can see the way Draco’s lip twitches towards a sneer and his jaw works. He knows that the flicker in Draco’s eye means he wants desperately to avert his gaze.
When Draco was forced to go back for regular check-ins, a condition of his parole, he could still recall that sickening pit of dread in his stomach, an omnipresent nausea that left him sweating and shaking as witches and wizards twice his age sneered at him across the atrium or through their office windows.
Slowly, shapes asserted themselves, darkening and forming into Harry's lovely face and handsome smirk. It didn't move much, not like the photos taken by proper wizard cameras, but it did move. Mostly Harry just blinked once, averting his eyes, his smile going a touch crooked.
Harry wanted to ask what he thought he was doing, but instead, he just watched. He watched as Malfoy took the tip of his middle finger and gently bit it between his teeth.
“He really took the coffee table?” Pansy asked, extracting another dull cotton button-down from the heap of Noah’s abandoned clothing. “It was teak!”
Eryn was there, looking worse for wear, hair frizzing out of its usual tight bun, eyes sunken and skin pale. But she gave Draco a watery smile, which was far preferable to the odd vacant stare from previous days, and Draco returned it tentatively.
Harry chuckles again and shakes his head, lifting one hand to skim the curve of Draco’s jaw with his knuckles. “I fucking knew it. Thought I’d imagined the look you gave me when fitting me for these bloody trousers.”
"I heard about what happened at your shop," Hannah said, pushing the paper cup across the counter to Draco.
“Mm,” Pansy hummed, delighted, sniffing the wine in her glass. “Keep me full up on this and you can say whatever you like.”
Draco felt like he was glowing, like light was just radiating from him so bright it would be blinding. This was Potter,
Potter’s lips parted around a breath, and Draco was transfixed. His fingers tightened on Potter’s jaw and suddenly Draco was crushing their mouths together. Potter responded with a groan and melted against him. Draco let Potter’s wand clatter to the floor in favour of burying his hands in his hair. He tugged the thick strands in his fists, yanking Potter’s head to the side so Draco could easily plunge his tongue between Potter’s yielding lips.
“It’s less lonely,” Harry corrects. “Don’t you think? Wouldn’t you be lonely, too? If I wasn’t around?”
Draco loves to dance, and the three — or was it four? — shots of vodka send heat coursing through his veins, and his limbs are loose. It’s easy to let go and lose himself to the music, to move with the crowd. He sways back, unsteady from the drinks, to lean against another solid body behind him. He turns slightly, eyes half lidded, to catch a glimpse of a tall, pale man with a sharp jaw, dark hair, and darker eyes looking back at him with one eyebrow raised. Draco closes his eyes and melts against the man as a hand trails across Draco’s abdomen, the other curling around his hip and tugging at his belt loops.
Potter shot one last dark-eyed glare at Draco before letting Weasley cart him off towards the pitch.
Draco chuckled as he fiddled with the dial on the radio, stopping when he found some scratchy Muggle rock music. “If I’d know how fun it is to drive, I would have stolen the keys from you ages ago.”
The only person who didn't seem to notice that Draco was dead on his feet was Eryn, who was somehow even worse for wear. Draco half wondered if she'd got into the potions, because the girl looked oddly dazed when she stood at the counter. Draco watched from the corner of the shop as she unloaded a box of empty potions vials into the storage cabinet, her hand continuing the movement even when the box ran empty and shelf full, just lifting thin air and setting it down with care.
“If it was nothing to you, then it is I who has misunderstood the situation,” Zabini said. “I’ll pass that along to Draco, if only to encourage him to let it go and move on. I don’t like seeing him like this.”
“Don’t be difficult. Do you know what I had to do to get us an appointment on such short notice? And after business hours, no less.”
Draco’s wand was in his hand in under a second. He summoned his medical bag and a few potions from his stash. He cast his cleaning and protection spells as he plucked the Floo powder from the container and flung himself into the fireplace.
Narcissa nodded and gave him a fake seal that magically bonded to the parchment for him to use to close the letter, Draco put it on the letter and then gave it back to his mother.
Remus had to take Harry out to get a new writing book. Harry didn't mind this, because it meant he could start practicing his letters better, too. He wanted to make sure all of his letters were really, really nice, so that Draco's parents wouldn't change their minds at all, ever. If Harry was on his best behavior with them, and always super polite, then they would never have to change their minds. It usually worked with the Dursleys, so it might work with them too, he thought.
Ron stopped and hugged Draco tightly, not liking that he didn't have fun at home. Draco had returned Ron's hug, though he had been taken aback by the suddenness of it. Draco was getting used to hugs still, but he did really enjoy them. "We can have all the fun you want while we're with Harry. Everyone should have fun." Now Ron really didn't care whether or not Draco's family was bad. Draco wasn't bad, and he needed friends. Ron knew how to be a good friend, and he would be Draco's friend along with Harry. "And you can come to my birthday, for sure. I'll throw a tantrum if I have to, so you can come. I promise."
Harry gave a happy squeal and practically dragged Draco to his room. Draco bounded along behind Harry giggling happily. The noise sounded strange to him but it felt good to make it, so Draco let himself have fun and giggle as much as he wanted. "This one is mine! It's all mine, and Remus says I don't have to share if I don't want to, and all the toys are mine! I never had toys before I came here, because Dudley took them all away, but now I do. Isn't that great?" Harry beamed brightly, radiating pure joy.
She smiled warmly at the boys and replied, "Well Ronald if you are sure you want to join Harry and Draco and that you will be on your best behavior during lessons, then I see no reason why you shouldn't study here with Remus. Especially if Remus is sure it won't be any extra trouble. What time should I start bringing Ron over in the mornings, Remus?" Molly asked, turning her attention back to the other adult in the room.
Harry beamed when Draco squeezed his hand, his green eyes sparkling brightly. There were tiny flecks of gold in them that made them seem to glitter more than anyone's eyes had a right to.
Harry beamed. "We have..." He counted. "Six gold ones, and ten silver ones, for ice cream." He did a little dance. "A-and... I'll help. I bet if I ask nice, she'll let you go. And sometimes... Mister Florian lets people have parties here, so maybe Ron could do a party here." He danced more. "I'm gonna try the cherry-lime. Cuz I like cherries, and limes."
To second Poe's comment: This is not the "good but kinda mean Malfoys" this is my take on what Draco's life would have been like with his parents. They are monsters in this story and they will continue to be monsters in this story. Draco is essentially the rich version of a neglected kid when you meet him. Now prepare to meet my adorable and incredibly lonely little Draco!
Harry held the snake steady. He was good at holding things steady. The snake lifted its head to stare imperiously at Draco, quite offended to be left out of the conversation. "Of courssse you may pet me, sssmall sspeaker. I like the ssscaless of my hood sscratched." It spread said hood for Draco to attend to, tongue flicking. "I don't need to sssmell you. I have already done sssso."
Harry was vibrating slightly with excitement, but otherwise contained it well. He wanted to howl for joy! His best friend, the very first one he'd ever picked for himself, was going to be able to come and visit more!! He blushed faintly at Draco's praise and smiled again, his eyes shining with his joy.
Harry watched, close enough that he could step in if Ron decided to be rude. He hoped that maybe they could make friends before Ron realized that Draco was a Malfoy, and that would help Ron get over it. He knew that Ron's parents didn't care for the Malfoys and that Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley often fought, but he hoped that maybe seeing Draco was different would change things for Ron.
"Remus, how long are we supposed to read for today? I read my book twice already so I was going to look for a new one if you wanted us to read for longer. If not then maybe we could do some writing and work it into our adventure for the day?" Draco said shimmying hopefully.
Draco settled into a cushion, on his belly with the book out in front of him. Draco wriggled a little as he read, since he always had trouble sitting still for long periods of time. Lying on his stomach, gave him the ability to wiggle his legs without making it hard for him to read. Draco was reading a book about a cat named Pete, and it always made him giggle. So as he read he laughed, though he tried to keep the laughter quiet so as to not disrupt anyone else's reading.
Draco blinked rapidly for a moment, eyes darting between the two men. Then, he reached for his wineglass and lifted it. "I think we do," he said.
They sit that way for a few moments, Draco watching the people pass and Harry staring into his glass.
The words had barely slipped from Draco's tongue before Harry had a hand fisted in his collar. He dragged Draco down so they were nose-to-nose. "Harry," he growled.
Weasley slanted a glance at Draco, then returned it to the view. "For what happened to you. After the war."
By Harry’s calculations, Draco only had two weeks left on his sentence, and then he’d be gone. And Harry wasn’t exactly sure how he felt about that. On one hand, with Draco out of England and out of his life, the fog of attraction and lust would clear from Harry’s head and he could think properly for the first time in weeks. But on the other hand, there was something addictive in the obsession. For so long, Harry had no focus. It was paperwork and pub nights, take away with Ron, board meetings with Hermione, a few failed blind dates. Stagnant repetition for Harry, all the while the world moved on around him. Friends started new lives, new careers, new families. And what did Harry have? Nothing. A dead-end job he hated. Friends who pitied him. Fans who tortured him. An empty house and a cold bed.
Potter's eyes narrowed as he studied Draco's face, then his lips twitched, expression cracking into a smirk. "What fun would that be?"
and Harry’s pint explodes on the table, shards of glass flinging themselves halfway across the room.
Her smile stretched strangely, and she nodded once. She looked down into the empty box she held in one hand, set it aside, and withdrew another from the stack of packages that had arrived that morning.
There was, however, cappuccino and a croissant under a stasis charm at the breakfast bar. They sat atop a stack of old copies of
“Is that what you think?” Potter asked. He looked rather befuddled and there was a line between his brows that was probably going to cause a hideous wrinkle from all the scowling he did and would hopefully mar his ugly face even further. “Do you hate me?”
Harry laughed. Draco slapped a hand over his mouth to quiet him, because he wasn't ready to be caught just yet, but moved it out of the way to kiss him. It was so easy to lose himself when kissing Harry. Draco was certain he could do it forever and never get bored, if given the chance. But Harry was pushing at his chest with a hand again.
Theo laughs. He drops his hold on Draco’s wrist and slaps a hand against his own forehead, though Draco doesn’t see what’s so bloody funny. “Come on, Draco. You can’t be serious.”
Potter kissed beautifully. He was fiery and skilled and tasted deliciously of sweet mint and warm tea. And when Draco dragged his hands from where he held Potter behind his ears to circle his throat loosely, he made the loveliest little whimper that sent heat flickering through Draco’s gut. Draco had one thumb on either side of Potter’s Adam’s apple and his fingers spread wide, manipulating the angle of their kiss, all the better to devour him.
. You would rather spend all your time hating me and hating yourself instead of feeling something, for fuck's sake. You can close yourself off, lock yourself away in your little shop playing with your potions because you think it keeps you
But then Harry wrapped a hand around Draco's cock, the pad of his thumb sweeping over the weeping tip, and Draco choked around a moan.
Draco stopped breathing. It was too intimate, too tender, and the simple act of being held had the devastating effect of causing the lump in Draco’s throat to expand to the point of aching, and his eyes began to burn, no matter how tightly shut he squeezed them. But Potter was so bloody warm, and Draco was just
Draco did, although he took his time about it. He didn’t want Potter to get the idea that he could order Draco around like that, pointing and grunting one-word commands like some kind of uniformed ape.
? Draco thought with a twinge of dismay. He knew he was a master of the art, but he'd expected better from Potter. Pity.
Freshly scrubbed and shining, in a clean set of his usual weekend uniform (denims and a t-shirt, as before, making him woefully underdressed), with his still-damp hair as styled as he could muster (which was to say, not much), Harry was lead by a somewhat subdued Bixby to the dining room. Blessedly, it wasn’t the one Tom Riddle had favoured for his “family” dinners—Harry learned later Malfoy had had that one shut up for good. This room was small by comparison, with just ten seats at the heavily polished mahogany table and a fireplace that only
Harry chuckled at Draco's harried tone and seated himself on the sofa. From the sound of things, it would be more than a few seconds before he was ready.
"I'm not sure about this," he replied eventually. "But it's not my decision. I get it... But it's Malfoy! Why couldn't it have been someone who isn't a complete wanker? Ugh..."
"You know, it's not nice to tease people, unless you're me," Draco said with a sigh as he sat back in his chair and was forced to let go of Harry's hand so they could finish their meals.
Draco sighed and visibly relaxed once his brain had been "sorted". He smiled as he opened his eyes again.
If Draco was bored enough to be thinking about (and, Godrick, wanting to have a conversation about) their post-shagging activities, he needed to step up his game. He pounded into Draco, holding his hips firmly to keep him from sliding up the mattress, angling his hips to strike his best approximation of Draco's prostate. He didn't expect him to come so soon after the last time, but he could at least make things interesting for him.
When Potter was fully seated, both men released the breaths they'd been holding. Potter grasped Draco's hip with one hand and reached in front of him to palm his prick with the other.
Draco finally set his glass down and turned to fully face Potter. He offered a long, pale hand again and flashed his teeth in a playful grin.
"Draco," Harry groaned in reply, hoping that word was enough to convey his own feelings. His whole body burned pleasantly and his cock would most likely suffer the strain tomorrow, but right now it was brilliant. He nudged Draco's legs wider before thrusting again, harder and wilder than before, his bollocks tightening swiftly.
"Not--Nn...! Not that I'm complaining, but... Wasn't it supposed to be... Me sucking you? Or did you change your mind about--holy fuck, your tongue! About... What I offered earlier?"
"Whatever," Draco held his hand up in a submissive fashion as Potter jerked away before wrapping it over his own waist. There was a sardonic smile playing at his thin lips. "I was going to offer to soften it for you, but I suppose you always did prefer things
He used his fingers and a generous amount of lube to get Draco ready. Once his boyfriend was alternately begging and cursing him to 'get on with it already,' he cast the necessary spells, lined up his prick, and eased his way in with shallow thrusts.
The whole place had an odd aura to it, something comfortable and heavy like a welcome blanket. Harry's leftover energy was there and the most dominant of all, but so were the energies of a few other wizards and witches--other people who had lived there generations past. Draco felt entirely comfortable in the old mansion, as if he were not only welcomed but
"Right," Granger nodded (very much like Potter in the mannerism) and examined an entry closely, absently chewing a stubby thumbnail as she worked.
He'd spent the better portion of the afternoon making preparations for Potter's imminent arrival. The house-elves were putting the finishing touches on a lavish four-course meal, Gieves was due at 6:30 sharp for the fitting, and the borrowed gown (Pansy's, from one of Blaise's ridiculous themed parties) was prominently displayed on a transfigured dress form by the hearth--like an out-of-season Christmas tree. He could hardly believe that what he'd first taken for a cruel prank--which had caused him to miss three entire days of work and resulted in no small measure of emotional distress--had concluded with his new partner, Harry-bloody-
