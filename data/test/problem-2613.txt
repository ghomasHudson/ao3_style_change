"There's things I tell Ron, and not Hermione, and things I tell Hermione and not Ron. There's things I can just tell you too. Things I think you'll understand in a way they couldn't."
He whurls around, a fire brewing just behind his grey eyes.
"I'm alright." He says quietly, but loud enough so that Harry can hear him over the wind. Anxiety gives way for exhilaration, and the warm excitement defends him from the chill of the night. "I'm ... this is amazing." He adds after a few moments, and Harry twists around to smile at him.
"No, Granger, I haven't talked to him since two days ago."
I started this story maybe not so serious about my writing, but i've really been trying to improve and add new depth to this story. It's still all for fun, and still very playful in terms of canon compliance, but i've been trying to add more subtext and symbolism and all that fun writer jazz. I think this is genuinely one of the best chapters i've written in terms of depth, and that's overall, not just for this work. Also, all this confidence i've gained if definitely because of you guys, the readers. It's even started to help me in my school grades, my writing has improved very drastically and you've all motivated me to be better. I can't thank you all enough.

"Thank you." He says, in earnest. He doesn't like that Hermione knows, but it's a kind gesture, and he's recently grown rather fond of those.
"Come on, Harry. Just do it. I can handle it, it's a simple enough anti-jinx."
Perhaps it's wrong, to allude to the war like he did, but it seems to trigger a reaction from Ron, so Harry doesn't let himself feel too bad.
“It started when I woke up to screams. This was only a few days after term had started.  At first, I thought it was me — you know my nightmares — but then I realized it was Draco. He was tossing and turning in his sleep, and he kept crying out stuff like, ‘No, please! Help!’
“Before I tell you how to get your guy — don’t give me that look, Harry! You came to me for advice! — anyway, before I tell you, do you mind sharing some stuff that you and Draco have talked about?”
“You really do care for him, then. This is real.”
Draco looked up with eyes that swirled silver with fear and tears, his book held tight and his body curled and stiff in anticipation. He looked ready for an assault of any kind.
“I don’t think he would be happy that I’ve said as much as I have. You — you get my point though, right?”
“Dray, don’t worry,” Harry said, creeping closer until he was sitting on the bed. Up close, he could see Draco's eyes in all their glory: grey, but brighter than they had been at the start of the term. There were slight blue flecks near the edges, and they swirled silver whenever Draco had any strong emotions.
But surely that couldn’t be right? As long as Harry had known him, Malfoy never tried to act like he wasn’t there. He was loud and brash and an annoying git — he was
“Potter.”
“Promise not to tell anyone if I tell you? They’re pretty dark, not to mention personal, and I don’t want anyone to know…”
When Harry looked around, he saw Malfoy sitting by the fire, reading a book, curled up in a ball. The thought that Malfoy was trying to be as inconspicuous as possible hit Harry again, but it didn’t make sense; the Malfoy that Harry knew was brash and loud and arrogant. But here he sat, small and silent and… afraid. His platinum blonde hair was longer than he had ever seen, and was held off the smaller boy’s face with a pale blue ribbon. Even though he sat right by the fire, Malfoy had his sleeves all the way to his wrist — and as Harry watched, he would stop reading to pull them further over his wrists and hands, almost as if he were — oh. Of course. The hint of black on a left forearm had peeked through, and Harry remembered that Malfoy was the enemy.
So, Harry said, as clearly as he could, “Seven years ago, you asked to be friends. Since then, we’ve been through a lot.” He swallowed, realizing the common room had gone silent, watching the two most volatile boys in the grade interact. “So, seeing as we’re rooming, I don’t think it’d be good if we were at each other’s throats. So, start anew?” he asked, sticking his hand out.
Hermione gasped, “The forest?” At Harry’s nod, her eyes grew even wider.
McGonagall looked at him through her glasses, the familiar soul-staring look brushing over him. “Very well, Mr. Potter, please take your seat, so that I may continue to the feast.” She walked away briskly.
He headed back to his room to grab his school bag so he could work on some essays — Herbology was due tomorrow and he hadn’t even started. It was on the Blood Orchid and its properties in potions, but Harry didn’t even know where to even begin. He should have paid more atten –
“Mr. Potter! May I ask you what you are doing?”
“Really!  Me and Draco talk about so much. He told me about his backstory. I told him about the forest.”
“What — But — How — How do you even know if he’s gay?” Harry spluttered.
“I — I didn’t mean to, I just — you just smell — I-”
“… staring at me, will you let me through? Not all of us are endowed with superhuman height.” Malfoy’s voice was different, too. The lilting speech and high voice were gone, replaced with a soft baritone.
He waited. Draco looked at the hand, then at Harry’s face, then back at the hand. Slowly, he reached out and shook Harry’s hand.
“No Harry, we couldn’t mate. We almost missed breakfast completely because you slept in late again.”, Ron said to Harry as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
“It’s done Mal-”
And, as before, Severus completely ignored Hermione’s hand. “Oh, what a shame no one from Gryffindor knows what it does. Malfoy, what does this potion do?”
Holy-
“One handful of rose thorns.”
“Ok Golden Boy, put it in the vial now.” Draco slowly shook his head as he watched Potter.
"Now you owe me. What's wrong?"

Dont hate me, here have a long chapter to make up for my.leave of absence, I'm sorrryyyyy!
Harry, apparently not registering the words, smiles. "Well,
In an instant, both Harry and Draco are on their feet in front of him.
Healing pleases him. No one would guess so ; the irony of an ex Deatheater for a healer seems too much for most people to look past. He can't fault them - It's strange to him too.
. It's an interesting way to acquire a fracture, for sure. Oh, my friend stubbed
The grin that stretches across Harry's face is unnervingly innocent and naive, considering the situation.
Harry groans. It's going to be a long day.
It's her fault, and his fault, and nobody's fault at all.
Harry had vehemently denied that public impression was a valid reason to forbid their relationship, but evidently he's changed his mind. Or maybe, it's not the public's impression he really cares about. Draco was right to bring up his friends; and now that Harry's
Harry sighs, concentrating on him.
A part of him wants to laugh at himself. He's behaving ludicrously. All he has to do is apologise, two little words,
"Tell me, Draco." He presses on, unaffected by Draco's comment. He's heard too many anyway, they all blend into one. Draco makes a mental note to up his game.
It's almost worth it when he sees how Hermione's eyes sparkle with newly discovered hope. "Thank you, Draco. Really."
Don't travel late at night, don't look at people the wrong way, don't walk down empty corridors. Maybe he can't fault Potter for treating him like a child, or some sort of precious porcelain doll, but he sure as hell can feel like one.
"You did! Admit it Draco, you panicked, and you ran."
"Please, believe that I didn't think this-"
"You don't have to tell me." He turns his face away from Draco, to glance over the lake.
Draco's quiet again. Harry saw their similarities before him. And more than that, he
Draco considers his options. Dirty robes and close proximity to Harry wins, of course.
"Did you-" He starts, looking at Harry in question. He didn't explicitly tell him not to tell her about his 'wand situation', but he thought it was quite clear he didn't want it to be public knowledge. But Harry shakes his head, looking just as confused as he does.

charm.
"I didn't hurt you."
"No, Harry, you've fatally wounded me. How will I ever recover?"
Draco can do little more than nod numbly and shiver. There's something about the way Harry said it; informal as it is authoritative, that sends tingles down Draco's spine.
It's funny, the memory associated isn't as painful physically like the other ones, but it still sits on Draco's consciousness and weighs him down like a stone to the bottom of a river.
He'll try.
So Draco had obeyed, agreeing to keep the relationship secret, for all of their sakes, but really mostly for Ginny's. He could, and
The water is glistening as always, the chilly breeze rippling the surface and distorting the moon's reflection into wavering pieces of bright, white, light.
, Harry. You have to choose." He says, the ultimatum poisoning the air and making it hard for Draco to breathe steadily.
"No, don't." Harry murmurs, tugging his hand back. "I don't want you to hide."
- I'm aware that some chapters happen the day or night after the previous, but there are week jumps elsewhere. So between chapter 15 and this chapter, about two to three weeks has passed. It would be very boring and tedious to go through everyday, and plus that would make the story move toooo quickly.
He actually laughs at this, an odd, hearty sound, reaching Draco's ears and winding through his body, sending shivers down his spine and a fluffy feeling in his stomach. He likes hearing people laugh. It creates the illusion that he's laughing with them. That he's feeling the happiness they are.
All I want (KODALINE) https://youtu.be/d6i-lvRkB8M
Draco tilts his head upwards so he doesn't have to look at Harry anymore. He's afraid of how much he craves him. Like an addict to a drug.
"I'm fine, like I said before. It barely hurts." He lies fluently, it's like a second language to him.
Forget chivalry. Draco turns to him with knowing narrowed eyes. "You wouldn't."
"Babysitting me. Tell me you at least get paid well for it. Otherwise, what's the point?"
There's nobody in the common room- everyone's at breakfast, so Draco's anxiety over getting caught eases a little.
Draco's exhausted by the end of the day; cleaning Harry's room, despite Hermione's help, was a big job, and he's well and truly knackered by the time he finally gets back to his own room.
The walk from his room to Harry's isn't too far; and most of the 8th years are in classes at this time anyway. Draco's DADA class had been cancelled- something about some fifth years accidentally setting a Boggart loose. So he arrives outside Harry's door with little trouble. However, getting into Harry's room may be another task entirely.
A hushed voice in passing firmly grabs Draco and drags him out of his own thoughts.
Harry's truly angry; and it's sure as hell not because he spoke to Hermione. It's
"Ginny-" He gasps out, because there has to be
But Draco finds his rythym eventually, relaxing and pressing closer to Harry, whose fingers dig possessively into Draco's hips, harsh enough to bruise.
"Draco, don't-" Harry starts, eyes flashing a warning and a reminder of their unspoken agreement that he'd do the talking.
"It's not your fault, Luna." Harry answers, sighing. "He's still getting ...
Draco's too distracted again. God, Harry looks so attractive when he's focused. He has no right to be, the rest of his classmates look like they're about to throw up when they attempt non verbal spells.
He doesn't see who's there, but he surely feels the harsh jab at his chest.
Draco's aware he's being ridiculous. Harry's not stalking him, really, it's a fantastical idea. But even as they get the all clear from Madam Pomfrey to leave, and are walking down the hallways to the dorms, Draco still can't shake the unsettling feeling that Harry was watching him - that he knew full well where he was.
It's all gonna work out someday"
Reluctantly, he lets Harry pull him along, and halfway through thier journey, the other shoe drops with a deafening thud.
"So," Harry folds his arms over his chest and look at him. "What did Hermione tell you to say?"
"This. Jinxing you."
spell is one thing, but for a healing charm to go wrong, well, Draco's more willing to just bind up the wound the muggle way. He's quite good at that, actually.
Draco's come to realise how lovingly the words 'shut up' can be said in the time he's spent with Harry. How somebody can say it with a smile, or not a scowl. How it can send sparks of warmth through him.
It's not that Harry doesn't WANT to tell his friends. He just can't. It would complicate an already complicated, delicate, situation.
He can work alone, it's not the end of the world. He's already lived through that, and it did not feel so trivial, of that he's sure.
But Draco can't find it within his vulnerable self to refuse help from anyone. "Thank you."
"Excuse me," Ron mutters, standing abruptly.
Draco's in no mood to argue with Harry further, so he keeps his mouth shut on the issue. "You know," He starts, when the space fills with silence again.
Draco's just as familiar with consequence as he is with pain. Which is useless, really, because it does little to prepare him for all the backlash.
"I asked first."
"Harry, I swear to Merlin himself, if you give me another excuse-"
making a fuss about Harry not telling anyone before, perhaps he deserves this horror. It's certainly self inflicted.

Draco can hear Hermione's voice faintly, muffled by the door. He wishes it could muffle the thoughts zapping around his head as well.
"Ah, how could I forget?"
grew to have an acceptable understanding of non verbal spells. He supposes if he had more practice he'd be brilliant, (probably even able to protect himself from people like that Gryffindor) but as learning non verbal spells wasn't really a big priority in his life, what with the aftermath of the war and all, he's just average.
He can find no purpose in standing and arguing with the oaf, so he just turns to leave, when he speaks again.
"Come with me." Harry says, interrupting. His eyes are bright and open, and shamelessly cajoling him into agreeing. "Please. I'm sorry for today ... just let me make it up to you."
He knocks on the door, as nervous as he was last time he did so, but for remarkably different reasons. "It's Draco." He calls through the wood.

"You're late."
It's in the bin before he starts crying again.
Harry doesn't reply for a little too long, not meeting Draco's eyeline.
"Tolerate him sitting with us?" Ron presses.
? Yes, Potter, I was just
He should stay away, shouldn't let himself get close to the boy, just because he's shown him an ounce of kindness.
"Is she alright?"
However, ever the proud Slytherin, he doesn't look up at the whispers or the jeers, pretends to not notice them, but the relief he feels when he hears them all stop abruptly is evidence that they affect him more than he'd be willing to admit.
Turns out, letting people know he and Harry are friends was NOT, in fact, a victimless crime.
to be thrown into the mix.
"I'm glad I told you."
She snatches the carton from him with a glare, and sets about helping him with the tea. Harry sends him a wink that makes his heart flutter nearly out of his chest.
Or maybe it's fate that does so, because Harry's waiting for him, fist raised like he's about to knock as soon as he opens the door.
Something evil and malicious and hell bent on ruining Draco's life must've possessed him when he agreed to help Hermione clean up Harry's room. Really, there's so much that could go wrong. Draco embarrassing himself in front of Hermione, for one.
"Hey, look at me." The hand pulls, applying the smallest amount of pressure, and Draco doesn't have the mental nor physical strength to be disobedient.
So he did what he does best. Flee.
"It's strange, you know." She says, and immediately, everyone's eyes are on her. She has that quality about her; she's soft, gentle; but when she talks you want to listen. "Seeing you two together. It's strange."
Draco. "I don't believe you don't want to be the saviour anymore."
"She just asked me to talk to you. You've never missed class." Not that Draco's keeping tabs.
"Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
"It's moral support!" Harry says, defensively. Hermione's nerves have started to rub off onto him, making him teether dangerously on edge. But surely Ron can't stay mad at him for so long, even given the circumstances. I mean, it's not like Harry's
, I would've never believed it. But Harry's right; you've changed. You're not who you were."
"No, I mean ... why are you here, talking to me?"
Supposedly, not Draco's.
His eyes don't falter. Maybe he knows he's really won him over already. "Don't you trust me?"

It's just that, for once, things seem to be progressing exactly the way Draco hoped them to. Hermione's spent countless nights with him, studying from dusk till dawn, until their tired eyes sting too much to read another word. Luna's walked him to class when she's afraid to leave him to brave the corridors alone, babbling on about this and that to calm private nerves he'd never dare voice to her. Even Ginny's shared a rare smile with him on occasion, when he'd accidentally let a snarky but superficial dig at Harry fall past his lips.

Draco's one of the first to enter, a wide smile stretching across Slughorn's face when he greets him.
"Hermione- what-" He fumbles for the blankets,  drawing them up and over himself. She rolls her eyes - Hermione's never been the kind to wait for people to get up to speed.

selective ability to remain quiet when he needs to be, smiles.
Draco's just about at his wit's end when Harry suddenly pulls him into the open courtyard, and they finally come to a stop.
"We can't do this." Draco mutters, closing his eyes in a rare moment of vulnerability. "What will everyone say?"
Now that Harry mentions it, Draco can feel something wet running down the side of his face - or at least, he would if he wasn't  so zoned in on the sensation of Harry's warm fingers pressing gently but firmly into his cheek.
"You don't have to do that." Hermione says curtly, tossing her hair over her shoulder. She sets her eyes on Harry's, so that he's forced to look at her, forced to be truthful. "I know you two are...
"I have to borrow usually, just for the class. I'll have to talk with Professor McGonagall about borrowing one for the entirety of the N.E.W.T.s."
"Alright. Now flick your wrist forward, like this." Harry moves his hand slowly with Draco's demonstrating the action. "It's like casting a spell."
Somehow, even when he's being vulnerable, Draco manages to still sound poised.
? You're going to just stand there and-"
Harry's one of the first, and only people to believe that, and Draco's unable to think straight long enough to apply his regular cynicism and prove him to be a liar.
It's fitting in a way - Draco's always had the spotlight on him, now he's cast away into the shadows. Logically, it makes sense, he understands.
The latter rolls his eyes irritably. "Give me the blasted rock." He snaps, marching forward to the edge of the river bank, hand outstretched.
It means that he's asleep almost as soon as his head hits the pillow, which is a rarity; Draco's insomnia seldom shies away for any amount of weariness.
The electrifying touches, the possessiveness, the concern and the care. The revelation makes Draco sway on his feet, forcing him to sit heavily on the nearest chair.
So Hermione breaks the eye contact before anything comes to light in Harry's eyes.
"Sportsmanship! There's never been a better time to make new friends, you know." He says, far too cheery for Draco's taste.
"I'm taking you to get that checked."

Disclaimer : I do NOT support engaging in a relationship with someone purely because you believe they can 'save you' or because you are in a vulnerable place. They maybe be taking advantage of you without either of you realising it. Draco and Harry's relationship in this story is NOT something anyone should aspire to, and it is pure FICTION.
Thank you for reading, you're all sweethearts!!
Abashed, Draco doesn't look up from the table in front of him for the rest of the hour.
But the thought starts to fester. Does he want this? Or does he only believe he wants this?
"Harry." She says, meeting him in the common room.
He knows Harry's just worried, but he can't help but feel a little ashamed at the mention of the incident.
"Harry-"
Harry laughs, but Draco feels suspiciously like the joke's on him. "Draco

are making him jealous of Ginny.
And anyway, he's got the Weasley, right? Why on earth would Harry choose Draco over Ginny? Or Draco over anyone for that matter. No, it's better this way. He should just dismiss these ridiculous feelings; go back to focussing on his work and the N.E.W.Ts.

He locks the door quickly; thank god the key's magical itself, otherwise fiddling with a locking spell would've cost him another ten minutes, and rushes after Harry.

Malfoy looked through the window and motioned for Parkinson and Zabini to get Scarface off him. Pansy understood the gesture Draco was making through the window and kicked Blaise in the shins to get him to notice. “Oh, yeah.” She heard Blaise say as she pulled him toward Malfoy.
Tomorrow. Oh no.
Harry heard Ron groan at the sound of working with Zabini.
Harry seemed to sense the tenseness in the air because he squeezed Draco’s hand lightly. “It’ll be alright.” Harry whispered gently into the other boy’s ear. Draco wasn’t fully calmed because he could hear the nervousness in Harry’s voice as well.
Snape’s mind suddenly connected the dots. The potion on the floor. The clingy Potter. The shards of a broken vile. “Draco, come with me.”, Severus said as he pulled Malfoy’s hand from Harry’s and dragged him into the hall. “Draco, when did this all happen?”. Snape said calmly as if he couldn’t hear Potter’s fists banging on the door.
Potter looked up at her with puppy-dog eyes. “Fine, you can also cuddle.” Pansy extended her hand to Potter’s and they shook on it.
He really didn’t care about the morning.
“It makes the drinker fall madly in love with whoever brewed the potion, sir.” Draco automatically responded. “Another 10 points to Slytherin for the correct answer.” the Professor stated calmly.
After Draco started sobbing, he couldn’t stop. It was like his eyes were filled to the brim with the cold and icy liquid. Harry quickly came out of the Gryffindor common room and tried to comfort the one he knew he belonged with, but it was no use. He didn’t know Draco like he wished he did. So he decided to plop down next to Draco and tried to whisper reassuring words into his pale ear.
Harry opened his eyes at once. “Please, Professor, there must be a mistake… I can’t be with Malfoy…….” Harry stuttered. “I assure you, Mister Potter, there’s no mistake. 10 points from Gryffindor for arguing with a teacher.” “Anyway, you all can go to your stations and start your potions.”, Snape stated, rather brutally. Harry trudged over to his station with Draco, rolling his eyes. “Listen Potter. I’ll tell you the instructions, and you’ll do what I say, got it?”
“Love you baby.” “Love you too.”
“GET OFF OF ME, YOU BASTARD!”, Harry heard Malfoy say. But to him it sounded like, “I love you Harry, and want to be with you forever.”
“Oi Scarface!”
“Yes!” Harry said, although it was muffled by his giggles.
“Fine.” “One ashwinder egg.”
Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes and asked, “How much?” Damn. How had he never noticed how gorgeous Malfoy’s eyes were…
“LET GO YOU BASTARD!”, Draco screamed. He was pretty sure everybody in the whole bloody castle could hear him, but he really didn’t care.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly shuffled into their seats, making it just before class had started.
“POTTAH, YOU GIT, GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF ME!”, Draco seethed with anger at the boy next to him.
“Now, I will pair everyone up, and then they can start their potions.” said Severus.
Draco looked at Harry and sighed happily. He felt like now he was falling in love, though no potion was involved this time.
“Potter with Malfoy”
“Great…”, Harry muttered under his breath. He already could tell that today was most definitely going to be horrible after all. All the signs were there, he could see them oh-so-clearly.
“CAN YOU STOP BEING SUCH A POMPOUS PRICK?”, Malfoy screeched at Harry.
His forest green eyes looked up into Draco’s gray ones and he took a step back. He admired Draco for a second, then opened his mouth to speak. “I need you to go talk to someone for me, ok love?”, he said, eyes shining prominent in the moonlight. “Anything for you”, Draco replied, feeling a bit braver now that he had calmed down. “Go talk to Pansy, ok? You need her and we both know it. I’ll be here waiting, don’t worry.” Draco nodded, standing a bit straighter. He gave Harry a peck on his toned cheek. “I’ll be back soon”, he promised. He walked down the hall and Harry watched his silhouette as walked through the corridor.
“No, Harry. He’s not ready yet.”, Parkinson said steadily. “We’ll tell him about our deal later, in our common room. Later Potter.”
“Moonstone.”
Chapter Six: Asking Politely
As they sat writing their charms essays, Draco felt happy for the first time in years. Finally someone actually cared about him, and he was enjoying their company.
He leaned up and grabbed his hand, sending him the ghost of what used to be a brilliant smile. They walked in a comfortable silence as they slowly creaked down the wooden floorboards. The white light of the moon shone through one of the unclosed windows, and bounced off of Draco’s milky white complexion. A lone tear slowly fell off his pointed face, down his neck, and finally dripping onto the old and rusty floor of the Slytherin common room.  Harry and Draco  lent forward, pressing their lips against each other. They relaxed into the kiss, Harry sighing into Draco’s plump lips. He eventually removed his own and decided he would help Draco, no matter what it took.
“Well”, Malfoy said thoroughly, “We were brewing Amortentia, and after it was done, he dropped the vile on himself by accident. Snape looked at Draco for a second, then burst out laughing. “What’s so funny?”, Draco was already seething from Potter, why did his professor have to add to it?

"Yeah."
"I don't think Professor Shrike has a choice." He says, as a way to divert his attention from the gut-wrenching scene. "There's a large number of students taking Defence against the Dark Arts this year ; too many to fit into one class, i'd imagine."

Ron wrinkles his nose. "Care and Draco Malfoy. Merlin, this is too much for me."
Draco has always been ghost-like ; in a way. Be it the shockingly white hair, stoney eyes, or perpetually sneering expression, something about him seemed supernatually charged.
"Good." He drops his hands from next to Draco's face, and back down to his waist. He kisses him again slowly; tantalizingly slowly, like he's trying to draw out every ounce of need Draco has for him.

And Harry laughs, again, and Draco's breath catches. There it is, that sound. He doesn't even mind that he's making fun of him.
He's gasping for breath at the end of it, knees pressed into the wet dirt, hands gripping his own sides in a pseudo-hug, comforting himself for there's no one else to do it for him.
But then, of course, there's
No, not a victimless crime in the slightest.
"Horrible texture."
"But you weren't."
Hermione knows it, Luna knows it, and she thinks, deep, deep down, Ron and Ginny know it too.
"I should go. You can get in on your own, right?"
Another simple pleasure - that's why Potter, and Draco, are here. A childish joy for young adults who've had to grow up too quickly.
As McGonagall spoke, Harry couldn’t help but look back over at Malfoy. The git wasn’t even looking at McGonagall, and he seemed distant, an emotion Harry couldn’t place on his face — maybe fear? Before Harry could analyse the emotions on the blonde’s face, everyone around him was standing. He turned and saw all the eighth years moving towards the table at the end and quickly followed suit. As he blindly followed Hermione, he glanced once more in Malfoy’s direction –
“Well, Harry, I believe you. You have a crush. Draco has a crush. So, what are you waiting for? Kiss him!”
Harry agreed absently, too busy staring at Malfoy, who had his head down and was staring at the table. Not once did he look up, not even when the food appeared. Not even when Parkinson sat next to him and attempted to start a conversation; she eventually gave up and went back to sit with Zabini.
“Take your time, Harry.”
“It’s okay. We were all scared and trying to stay alive. The war’s over. We all need to move on.”
Harry drew nearer slowly, giving time for Draco to move, but the blonde seemed as transfixed as he was. He put his hand on Draco’s cheek and the blonde sighed, leaning into it. Slowly, slowly, they drew nearer, and then stopped, lips barely touching, feeling each other’s air. It was as if time had stopped and reality had reduced to him and Draco on this bed, nothing more.
When Harry walked back into the Great Hall, the first thing he noticed wasn’t the new teachers, or the half-enchanted ceiling, or even the fact that there were five tables instead of four. No, what he noticed first was the flash of blonde hair that only meant one thing — or rather, one person. Somehow, Malfoy had got here before any of them and was now sitting down, shoulders hunched, looking very un-Malfoy-like.
He could see Draco’s sleeping face as he slept soundly, the image of an angel: peaceful and happy, his platinum hair fanned out on the bed. He was clutching his own pillow and had the covers wrapped around himself loosely. Harry felt a rush of fondness for the boy, and realized Hermione was right: he had it bad. He crept closer, trying not to make too much noise, but his foot slipped on a shirt that he hadn’t noticed on the floor, and he fell back with a yell.
"And what exactly do you want?" Draco murmurs, the private  thought somehow finding its way onto his lips.
"Was being the operative word." Draco continues, flinching when Harry accidentally presses too hard against the wound. It looks a lot worse in the light of day. Nothing life threatening, obviously, but it's decidedly not pretty, all purple skin and stained blood.
Draco regrets asking; blushing and looking away. Merlin, this boy will be the death of him. How he's going to get through tonight with his heart still in his chest he doesn't know.
Because Harry just
"You know i'm right. He made a mistake. That's all it was. You know that he must
But this time, when he sits to enjoy the small pleasure, two people stare back at him.
"I couldn't care less about what people will say, Draco. And you can't make me care anymore than I can."
Harry's not said anything, but Draco can hear the disagreement in his silence.
He thinks about that as they sit, Draco up the front next to Harry for a change.
"And I won't." Harry says firmly. "Ron will come around."
She does see, but she shouldn't. She shouldn't look. "Ginny loves you, and you love her. It can't be over."
"I didn't know what to say to her - I was caught in a love triangle with one dead side."
Actually, he's so put off by the notion, that he skips breakfast, far too sick with worry to even THINK about eating.
"I wouldn't
Something in Draco physically recoils at that. The idiot has no idea what relationship Draco and his father share-
Of course, he has Harry to thank for that. Hermione, who too was rather excited about the upcoming Yuletide celebrations, toned it down a bit upon seeing Draco's dark demeanour. Harry, on the other hand, takes some inane pleasure in seeing Draco irritated.
Uh oh.
"Hey. I wasn't sure you'd come." Harry starts, and it startles Draco into silence.
"Ron, i'm sorry. Just let me in, yeah?"
"No, of course not." Hermione offers her an encouraging smile, but he sees the look she shoots him.
No, Potter's leniency can't possibly extend to Draco. He should despise him, even more than he already does.
He's acutely aware that he has to return with a book vaguely related to their study focus, otherwise their suspicions will only worsen, so he idly runs his fingers over the spines of the neatly stacked books, trying but ultimately failing at paying much attention to the actual content, or even the titles for that matter.
"What? Oh really, Potter, i'm not going to say I missed you too. What are we? Third graders?" He huffs quickly. Of course he'd never admit to it. His attachment to Harry shall forever remain hidden in some deep, obscure part of his mind.
"No. Your boyfriend made it clear I wasn't to."
"It's not her's, either." Draco mumbles, eyes transfixed onto Harry's. He could fall into them, could easily be trapped in their blissful world that promises wonder and joy and
Hermione doesn't fancy herself a genius. People say she is, and she knows she's smart, of course she does, but she's never, and will never, call herself a genius.
She's not really only talking about herself.
His pride, though a sin, is the only thing stopping him from childishly glaring back. Ron should just hex him and get it over with;
say aloud.
Privately, he sources a little joy from the fact that Harry doesn't seem to be talking to Ron either. Or Ginny for that matter. It's a cruel twist of fate; finally Harry's free to be all Draco's, and he's not even Draco's anymore.
all this?"
She's shaking with anger by the time she's done, and fiery red fills her cheeks, but she doesn't move. She doesn't want to make a scene, and she hasn't. "I think you two should go." She mutters.
Perhaps Harry would be his solitary star. But the stars' only commitment is to the moon. Harry's commitments are far from singular.
And, as Draco's finally fixed one issue, another arises.
Draco feels the shame inch into his cheeks. He's humiliated. Harry must think he's pathetic, insecure, and a host of other qualities he's most certainly not.
Thank you to all who read and commented! No songs this time :( I legitimately just sat in silence as I wrote this !
"I did. Now you're undoing it." Draco says, grumpily.
One, Draco cries out, clasping his hands over his ears, trying to soothe the pain building there.
And in a moment, it's all shattered.
Expecially not when he can see them together, all over each other like filthy dogs in heat. It's disgusting, Draco is disgusted.
"I solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
." Draco bites out in exasperation, color filling his cheeks.
"Something's wrong with you."
It's warm too, regrettably, so he can't bring himself to think rationally and give it back. "Thank you." He says, when he realises he's been cozying up into the coat without a word for far too long.
I can't express how greatful I am to all those who commented and left kudos. You guys are amazing! Also to the people who subscribed, and the people who bookmarked my work, thank you so much. I feel so blessed to be receiving so much love.
Once he apologises, it'll be over.
"If you're so sure, why are you asking?"
, some reason to prove what's happening really isn't, that this is some elaborate joke and reality will slap him into awareness soon.
you for it!"
, and he shouldn't want him. And despite the fact that Harry's made his desire for Draco abundantly clear, he's waltzed around the subject of Ginny smoothly enough to make Draco foolishly put her aside.
Harry, lying in his bed. Harry, his hands all over him. Harry, fingers tugging at blonde, almost white hair, nails running down tan skin, breath filling up empty space -
I'm so, so, so sorry for the delay. I had exam after exam this week, and now, I've unfortunately had the displeasure of falling ill, and there is a high chance I've contracted the 'dreaded' Covid-19 virus. There's definitely perks to it - I get to take time off school to watch Netflix, catch up on sleep and studies, and write all day!
Still, it's these firm reassurances that Harry will be there, regardless of their disagreement, that helps Draco keep to his promise.
Hey guys! Thanks for all the reads and comments and kudos as usual. I just wanted to check in and apologise for the long long long delay. I've no excuse for how long I waited to upload this. Truth be told, I had started to wonder if this did was worth finishing, my passion had completely dwindled to nothing. But I'm doing better now, and I hope to keep writing and continue with my plan of making this story into a 3 part series. Oop, announcement alert, I'm making this into a three part series!
Draco stands with sudden purpose, wrenching the coat off the hanger. Enough is enough.
Harry laughs again, and he's so close to Draco, he can just about see the brightness in his eyes.
"That's the idea. But Harry refuses to part with any of this!" She says, staring dangerously at a rather sheepish looking Harry, standing in the middle of it all.
The former reason is why he finds himself in old Slughorn's potion class first thing in the morning. If it were any other lesson, Draco would have moaned and groaned on to no end about how no class has any business being so early, but the potions class, despite the very tangible lack of a certain Slytherin professor, never fails to bring comfort to the youngest Malfoy.
- four times, mind you- to get his wand to light up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco smiles. Harry's likely only saying it to make him feel better, but it's working. "I was what? I misheard that."
They have way too much history to let something like this affect them. Right?
I think this explores Harry's character more than Draco's tbh, though it's from his point of view.

Hehe :)
Harry groans. "Okay look. You have to swear not to bother me about this."
"No, no, I'm fine."
If you think you're reading too much into this chapter, trust me, you're not.
"Draco, I'm coming with you. It's non negotiable."
A Minister of Magic, that young ... it's unprecedented. Boderline nonsensical.
And just like that, Draco doesn't need to answer. "Let me get my coat."
Draco can't remember what those points were again. "I-" He's stuttering nonsense, but he has to say something because Harry's right there in front of him and he's staring and oh Merlin, Draco can't stop thinking about kissing him senseless. "Your coat." He says quickly. "It's cold. You need it."
Well, that's his logical reasoning anyway. He's coming to realise that emotions and feelings are far from logical.
"No, I don't. Just say it Harry." Draco's pushing, far too hard, and he knows he has a bad track record of missing out on the moon because he wants the stars, but he can't help it. He's got to know.
Hermione and Harry were supposed to meet him at the library
"How could you?" His voice shakes, just like the tremor in his hand, and the guilt, rushing in like a tsunami, hits Draco all at once.

It's ordinary, unremarkable; but Draco's grown to admire the charm of commonplace.

at the praise, too caught up in the feel of Harry's hand against his skin to feel ashamed. "Kiss me." He intends to say it like a command, but his voice betrays him and he sounds suspiciously like he's begging.
"I know why this, erm,

He shrugs it on, but quickly rethinks it, because it smells so much like
The 8th year dorms aren't separated by house. Inclusitivity, or sportsmanship, or something like that - Professor McGonagall had given a good ten minute speech about it after the sorting ceremony.
"Something I should've done before. Harry, move."
Draco turns to set his eyes on the line where the sea meets the sky, afraid of falling into the hypnosis he always seems to succumb to when looking at Potter for too long.
And then, without warning, Harry's lips are against his again. He tangles his hands into the front of Harry's shirt, needing to grasp at
"He must be." Draco mutters in agreement, not really focusing on her words.
Ah, so Harry's avoiding his own 'Draco problems' by refusing to talk about them. It's a tried and tested strategy, in his - and Draco's - defence.
Although, Draco does suppose he
Harry shrugs, feet scuffing the earth. "I wasn't sure if you wanted to see me, after ..."
"Damn, out of milk. I think Ginny's got some." Harry says, placing the mugs - finally cleaned and polished- back onto the counter. "She's got Quidditch training, but i'm sure I left her key here somewhere ..."
"One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go, whether it’s guilt, anger, love, loss or betrayal.
Now this, this is too much. It's like he's in Draco's head. Actually, Draco's starting to think that maybe he really IS inside his head. Harry's got to be using some kind of

Yet something, masochism, probably, propels him forward.
and they needn't talk about the incident ever again.
"Potter, there's no need." He says it shortly, a lot harsher than he intended it to be. He can tell that Harry picks it up immediately, but because he's somehow
Draco has to bite his lip to hide the amused grin threatening to light up his face. Sometimes Harry's disregard for social niceties can be a good thing.
"Harry. Harry!" Harry wakes with a groan, then a jump when he realises Hermione's standing over him.
Sometimes, Draco misses Harry, his touch, his concern, his friendship. Other times, he wants to stick pins into the boy. How is it that Harry can be so selectively obtuse? So he can keep his mouth shut when Draco's upset with him, but not now, huh?
"So," Hermione says, rolling her eyes as though Ron was being intentionally witless. "He cares about Harry. A lot. Why else would he jump to make sure he was alright?"
It's hell; sleepless nights picturing Harry's hands brushing his skin then

counts as 'good'.
"Draco, I asked you to sit with me, right? And you said yes, so sit with me. You're not here because of them." Harry says, offering him a lopsided grin that traps Draco's breath in his throat.
"What, then? You can't possibly love Draco."

Draco's heart seizes up, shock and confusing grabbing him and making him lie dead still.
It rolls into the water with a plop as Draco sucks the blood from his skin, and a funny feeling rises in his chest. It keeps rising, through his lungs and up out of his throat.
Neither of them and up with what they deserve. Happiness.
His hand is shaking, and his eyes are still adjusting to the light when he tugs open the door.
Draco's heart slows, not daring to even beat too loudly in case it distracts him from the surreal scene unfolding in front of his eyes.
It leads Draco to come to the probably very likely conclusion that Harry hasn't explicitly

greater a show of bravery.
"Draco..."
- André Aciman, Call Me by Your Name
Hermione, unsurprisingly, takes the first tentative leap. Draco has to keep reminding himself of her Gryffindor status.
There's nothing on his counter save for an old muffin- a blueberry one.
I know. I'm his best friend, Malfoy. You're nothing to him. Nothing!"
Harry listens to him, he checks up on him, cares for him. That should be enough; girlfriend and best friends and the whole of Hogwarts be damned.
It feels like a stone in her stomach. "Draco?" She asks, though it's futile to do so. She knows he's talking about Draco, it couldn't be anyone else, even if he'd left out the gender.
In his other life, he'd have gladly died thinking Harry to be a pompous arsehole. But now, he can't sit next to the boy for five minutes without wanting to snog him senseless.
None, not even the two girls who were oh-so-eagerly whispering to each other before can say anything now.
Yet somehow Draco had managed to for a good amount of time. Another reason Harry has no business befriending the blonde.
"Regardless, i'm sorry." He says.
"When i'm with you. When i'm happy. It's like, I can't help but feel guilty, because I shouldn't be happy. I don't deserve to be, not after giving up on her like that."
But seeking the truth is often better than believing a lie.
Draco doesn't dare say anything. He's not supposed to know anyway, strictly speaking. It bothers him that Harry hasn't confided in him about it yet, of course it does, but he keeps reminding himself to relax. Harry will tell him when Harry wants to tell him, and that's that.
"I didn't realise we set a time, Draco."
happy to be near him. Draco groans dramatically, more gently releasing his bag onto the floor and sitting cross legged next to Harry, close enough that they're barely centimeters apart.
"Not enough. Now get lost. And hurry, I need that Tea." She calls after him.
So when Harry's next sentence is
"He's a snake. He'll lie just to get you to trust him, and when you turn your back he'll bite, i'm telling you. He's playing you!"
"You didn't have to." Harry half smiles, like he's fully aware of his shabbiness, daring Draco to say something more.
His breath hitches when Harry's wandering hand moves to the back of his neck, and he hopes against hope that Harry doesn't notice and withdraw from him.
"Five minutes, got it 'Mione." He says quickly, offering her a placating smile, gently trying to usher her out as soon as possible.
A quick healing charm later, and the cut is rapidly receding, healing itself swiftly. Draco almost wishes it hadn't worked, just so Harry would keep holding his hand.
Draco avoids her eyes, remembering what kind of memories she probably has associated with him. It's not everyday you're held captive in Malfoy Manor. There's no guarantee she'll set it aside as quickly as Hermione did.
walks in.
There's no fire, no danger, just miles and miles of black night, framed by midnight blue tainted clouds and twinkling fairy lights spotted around the crescent- shaped moon. And there's Harry too- right in front of him, his hoodie soft beneath his clenching fingers.
"What's gotten under your skin, Malfoy?"
And when the end of his last class rolls around,promise in mind, run to the lake he does. It's a strange concoction of emotion that spurs his steps onward. Worry, anticipation, a great deal of fear too. It's not a foreign feeling for Draco, but it really doesn't get easier with practice.
"Ron, i'm trying to be understanding here!" Harry says, prematurely snapping in his frustration. He thought he'd loose his cool at
"See you tomorrow, Draco?" Harry seems to inexplicably KNOW he's messed something up; call it magic, if you will. He says it gently, like he's taming a wild animal.
The jealously that is usually aroused in situations like this is misplaced by a deep admiration this time. He can hate their relationship as much as he wants, but he can't deny what an amazing boyfriend Harry is.
Draco agrees almost instantly but he's not sure that that's what he really wants. He can't think of anything he wants to say, either. But the instinctual reaction within him surges forward, consuming his mind, the words spinning around his thoughts and making him dizzy.
"You have to care, Harry." Harry doesn't acknowledge him, instead rubbing his fingers distractingly over Draco's jaw, making the other boy press into his palm, not entirely of his own volition.
But Harry's hand accidentally dips lower, and Draco's pyjama sleeve is hiked up and he's running the pads of his fingers over the bumpy skin over his wrist where smooth skin should lie.
"Beans?"
"A little bit." Draco clenches his jaw, but Harry presses his lips against his cheek. "No, not like that. I miss talking to her. We always fight, and I just miss when we didn't; we really were good friends before. I'll always care about her, but, I dunno, I think i'll always miss her like that too."
Professor Shrike, the newly
Harry shakes his head, still smiling. "Give me your hand, Malfoy."
Non verbal spells are hard, because they rely solely on your ability to control your magic, drawing power directly from the source. See, wands are just a conduit for magic; the real power's contained within your core.
But he doesn't get to finish the sentence, because his world twists and turns and falls away in front of his eyes, the stars tumble over each other in a hasty dash to fall out of the sky and into his lap, the waves change their direction and crash against the sand with all the ferocity of a lioness.
"All our dreams can come true. If we have the courage to pursue them."
Suddenly, Draco feels guilty again. Harry's alone. He lost two friends in the span of two minutes, and he's left alone and probably very upset.
His fingers loosen around Harry's wrist. "Ron and Hermione ... what about them? Your friends?"
Draco's aware he's staring far too intently, but it's like he's entranced.
She clears her throat to get the focus back on her. "Well. Good thing you're here. Here-" She hands him a wand, which he frowns at.
Draco knows all too well how much the truth can hurt, so he'll keep fuelling his forged fantasy- he'd rather loose touch with veracity than confront his demons.
"Ron, he's lost everything! His family, his friends, his reputation. I really don't think plotting to take me down is high on his to do list."
Ginny's supposed to be what Draco is to him. Hermione can't in good conscience slap Harry on the back and congratulate him, not when it would shatter Ginny. He's always impulsive when it comes to emotion, but this is different. This is the most awful thing he could have done.
"Did I do something wrong?" Harry asks softly, the hesitation in his voice clear. It's sweet, Draco's heart thumps at the way he cares so
The brunette smiles, making his way back towards the castle.
"I'll... see you, Potter."
Draco wouldn't have dreamt of saying something that sounds suspiciously like he needs Potter, but this is a careful situation. He has to know how Harry knew where he was. He can't have just heard them talking ; he appeared far too quick for that.
in a way. Maybe that's why he can't seem to take his mind off the boy. Maybe.
"Just listen, please." Harry says - no,
"I don't understand ... why is he upset with you?" Draco asks.
At least Draco feels terrible about it. Perhaps that could be his penance.
"No." He agrees.
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
Harry and Draco stop outside a potrait of a tired looking man, behind which lie the 8th year dormitories.
"Nothing."
Draco pulls the blankets over his head again, stopping the light from reaching him and calling him out on his lies. One day. Just one day, and he'll be okay. He'll get over it,
Harry brought her here, and you'll have forgive his mind for running a bit behind schedule; he

"You should have gotten up then!"
"No." Harry walks closer, and Draco, daringly doesn't move away this time. "It's not your fault."
"He was confused, or-or manipulated. He doesn't love you, he never did. You've got to be seriously dim if you ever thought he actually cared about you." Ron spits, walking around him with his wand pointed outwards.
Hermione glares. "Don't do that Malfoy. I'm being civil with you."
"How can you be sure-" Draco presses, and Harry lifts his other hand to pry Draco's fingers fully off his wrist.
Draco scarcely breathes, at risk of Harry feeling the shuddering gasps. He needn't worry - the pulse beating away wildly under Harry's palm is a dead giveaway of his anticipation.
driven by a hormone-induced haze, he's probably woken up to smell the roses that reek of horrible truth.
She's right, of course. Draco should extend her the same courtesy. It's just that it's such an open wound still; he'd rather not think about his 'Harry problems' (as he coined them), especially not with his best friend.
Second Chapter, here we go!
" He pushes a plate of bacon towards him, which Draco wrinkles his nose at. "No, come on. You don't like
Draco pushes back, trying to get him to
"It's okay." Harry whispers into his hair when he has to pull himself away. "I'm here."
Somehow, Harry and Draco had come to a non-verbal agreement that they'd meet after their last class every other day,only because meeting everyday got a bit finicky, with Quidditch and assignments and whatnot. It's strange, how this arrangement has never been explicitly adressed nor confirmed, yet Draco's not exactly jumping to question it's validity.
"Harry!" Ron's voice this time, followed by a harsh banging on the door. "What's taking you so bloody long?"
“...Crabbe and...Goyle with Longbottom...Finnigan...Thomas…”
As he got up from the table he felt people walking all around him, not wanting to be late for class.
“Death Eater!”
“C’mon!” Harry seemed very excited to be spending time with Draco, and even though he was his enemy, Malfoy thought this was nice, because a lot of people would’ve turned down the answer in a heartbeat to study with him.
However, Severus Snape did not notice that. “Ten points off each for being late. Now, students, who can tell me what potion we’re making today?” Snape sneered. Draco Malfoy’s and Hermione’s hands shot in the air.
“Eat something Harry!”, He heard Hermione say seethingly as the last few minutes ticked by on the ginormous clock at the front of the hall. Not wanting more to add to this already terrible day, he shoved a spoonful of oatmeal down his throat just as the clock stroked 7 AM.
“Refined peppermint oil.” Harry shifted his hand around in the cupboard until he found the tiny bottle, popped off the top, and poured in some of the liquid.
“Bye Dray! See you tomorrow!”
“Parkinson and Granger.” “Zabini with Weasley.”
Pansy grabbed Harry’s arms and Blaise got his feet, and they carefully brought him back into the classroom. Almost immediately after locking all the doors’ latches,  Harry started to pound on the door for Draco to notice him.
As soon as they saw Harry and Malfoy together, chaos erupted.
“Wait!” Draco turned around to see Potter. “Draky, I was wondering if you wanted to spend the night with me?”, Harry asked politely. Draco smiled. “Sure Potter.”
“C’mon Harry, we're going to be late to breakfast!”, was the first thing he heard as he woke up from a deep sleep. Another person behind a new grunting voice was tugging his arm, and, grudgingly, Harry got up.
Since whatever he was doing wasn’t working, he finally thought of a solution to his problem: Pansy Parkinson. Draco’s best friend in the world that understood every little thing that he had told her. The one that had known him for years. The one who also had to suffer with an ungrateful family and a disregarding dark lord. He tapped Draco on his fabric-covered shoulder and pulled him up from the ground. Draco just held on to Harry for who knows how long and leaned his head onto the golden boy’s shoulder, sniffing. He felt so stupid to believe that everything would go his way for once. But no. The world had always hated him and he hated the world. Oh well, at least some people still cared about him.
Draco felt queasy entering the Gryffindor common room. After all, he had despised the whole lot of the Gryfindorks since he first came here.
Harry, Hermione, and Ron studied all day, though Harry seemed immensely distracted. Hermione looked over her shoulder and saw Malfoy. ‘Oh no wonder, he still has that stupid potion on him.’, she thought as she rolled her eyes. Malfoy came over to them and asked if they had found anything that could reverse the potion.
“Dray-boo!”, Harry exclaimed. “I missed you!” Malfoy rolled his eyes as Potter hugged him.
“Get out Malfoy!”
“Hey Draky, wanna study with me?,” Harry asked as he was pushed from his embrace on Malfoy. “Fine.”, Draco sighed, seeing as he couldn’t escape him.
He had forgotten to put the cork on the tiny bottle. He only realized this mistake when he leaned the vial back onto his palm. He could feel the liquid seep through him, and suddenly-
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry. “You only needed one stone, not five.”
Harry smiled as he saw that Draco was back. He raced toward him and just hugged him and thanked Pansy again and again. After they said their goodbyes they walked back up the stairs and flopped onto Harry’s bed, not bothering to get into their pyjamas.
“Why’s that ferret here?”
“Oh, sorry Malfoy.” Harry said while he shrugged sheepishly as he took out four of the rocks.
But he didn’t sigh for long, because, right after he did, Potter pulled him into a kiss.
Harry dropped the tiny egg into his cauldron.
Draco walked through the corridor, and picked up his pace when he saw his best friend’s dorm. He knocked politely and waited patiently until she opened the door. He didn’t have to wait long, as she was apparently in her room, repainting her nails with glossy black polish. She immediately stopped when she saw him, knocking down her expensive polish onto the floor with a thud as all its contents soaked into her new fluffy white rug. “Dray I missed you! You haven’t been stopping by as much since you and Potter started snogging- oops I mean dating.” She changed her words when Draco gave her a look.  “Harry’s the whole reason I’m here Pans. his Gryffindor friends made fun of me and then I had a huge breakdown in the hallway”, he said, rubbing his thumb and index finger against his temple.

As they walked they caught up, talking about his boyfriend, how everything is messed up, and some random bits of gossip that Pansy probably got off the back of one of her magazines.

Draco reached a hand to try and wipe it away, but it was no use. Pools of the clear liquid slid down his pale complexion. He slid down the wall and cried.
