“Nepotism really does work out sometimes,” Draco said from his seat at the table behind them.
Draco nodded, “here you can see that there used to be more properties, but that your family sold them.” He pointed at the crossed-out addresses. “They probably sold them because they weren’t of any use.” Harry nodded along listening to Draco intently. “We might be able to visit your manor somewhere before New Year.”
He took a deep breath and stepped inside the cabinet. He moved to the back and cast the spell that was necessary for them to be moved between the cabinet and emerged in the drawing-room of his childhood home. What he had feared so much came true, in front of him stood his mother, the woman strong as ever, behind her was Bellatrix, her manic smile in place. Though, when he emerged he saw that there were many more people in the room. He saw Bellatrix, the Carrow brothers, Fenrir Greyback, Thorfinn Rowle and Gibbon all standing around his mother. However, that was not the person that drew his attention. Behind Bellatrix, stood Voldemort, looking down upon him.
Neville is next to him in an instant, ‟Harry,” he says. Harry stands up shakily flushing the toilet. ‟That doesn´t sound like you´re feeling any better.”
Draco frowns, ‟I thought you didn´t want that though.”
Harry laughed. The door to the common room opened up, Dean and Seamus walking into the room. “Hey guys,” Harry said, “could I ask you something?” Harry told them about the snake, and how he wanted to adopt him. The two boys had no problem with it. Slowly Harry and asked everyone what they would think if Harry got a snake. Luckily for him, no one was against it. Though, he only had to ask Ernie.
When everyone sat down the food appeared on the table, Lucien standing behind Harry and Draco. “Thank you, Lucien,” Draco said, the elf bowing and disappearing. “Well,” Draco said grabbing the glass of wine, “thank you all for coming and I hope it tastes well.” He raised his glass the others following.
“Yes,” Kingsley said, “I know Dumbledore sent you all on a mission, that much is clear. But, I am going to have to ask you to explain it all.”
‟Good to know, I´ll have to talk to him about a baby shower,” she says.
“One thing I don’t get,” Harry wondered out loud, “how come the Horcrux in me didn’t die when the basilisk bit me?”
“When did you get access to your family vaults? Did you have access to personal vaults before you got access?”
Harry made a happy sound, jumping off of Draco and walking past Sirius to bound down the stairs. Draco chuckled, following behind Harry.
Harry nods, kind of relieved to not be alone, “that sounds great!”
so uh, I have no actual experience, with writing things like this, and also with kissing on itself, so please don't judge too harsh :|, Also no real experience with rating works, so should I change it to explicit or not?
“I see,” Riddle said, “well done, you might be of use after all.” He walked forward, the group parting for him, “tell me, can we attack tonight?”
“Though, those are connected to him. Dumbledore could’ve known about the cave when he visited him in the orphanage. And he did know about his middle name. He could have found the connection. The Horcrux at Hogwarts must be safe, no one but I have found the deepest secrets. We must go all the places, double the security.” He looked, “we will start at the ruins of the house. Come Nagini we must depart.”
They walked in silence, they sat on the floor by the lake, using the cloak as a makeshift blanket. They sat next to each other, Harry still leaning on Ron.
“Can’t believe the ferret didn’t even wake up,” Ron said, “even Daphne, I think that’s her name, came out of her room for a second.”
‟How are you so chill about that?” Harry asks, ‟I mean, I was already overwhelmed when everyone started saying Ginny and I would end up together. And we were dating at that point.”
“Yes,” Harry says, “so, thanks for taking me out, but I’m going home.”
Harry nods, ‟I think it can totally happen,” he says, ‟but if you don´t go you let that chance slip away.”
“He said that you are very nice,” causing a smile to break out.
‟Purple?” Harry says later, ‟can´t believe not only the rooms will be either Hogwarts colours or gender colours. Purple and white are the only colours left.”
He put his finger under Harry’s chin, pulling it so his eyes were now on Draco. “You want a shirt?” he asked, knowing that the feeling of fabric could be annoying to Harry. Harry just shrugged again. “Okay,” Draco said, “let’s put on a shirt, and if it bothers you, you can always remove it,” he looked at the boy, “does that sound good?”
Draco nods, ‟yeah I realised that too.” He smiles at Harry, ‟though I know those times we slept on a couch were better than most nights in a bed alone.”
“Of course, my boy, you know where they are.” With that, he left the classroom.
“Yes!” the three of them said at the same time. “I know a place where we can put it, that way you wont be tempted to find it again.” Ginny said. Reluctantly Harry agreed, he had hoped that he could keep the book, but the secret meeting tonight was more important than any book, especially since Slughorn already seemed to love Harry.
“I love you, Draco,” he said, “be safe.” And with that, the man walked out of his room, and he was gone.
“Very well,” she said, “please deliver the list tomorrow. That is all.” With the dismissal, the groups went back. The eight years said goodbye to their fellow students, moving to their own tower. All of them went to their own room, writing down the list that McGonagall had asked for. Harry and Draco would have their testimonials the first two weeks. As Lucius was the first one on trial, having housed the Dark Lord, and having been the right-hand man. The next week the people who fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower would be on trial. All would go at the same time, as to make it easier for those who would be testifying.
It turns out that coming back home was what Harry needed. He wakes up in his bed next to Draco and remembers all the times he did so before. He walks into their kitchen and remembers how he and Draco both like their tea. He kisses Draco when he walks in and remembers the mornings they spend together. Once it starts there is no stopping and he remembers and remembers. Hermione and Ron come over, and he hugs them, apologizes for not telling them, and shyly asks if they’re mad.
“Ginny,” Harry said, “you have to stay here, someone needs to protect the other students.” He looked at her, “Voldemort promised Hogwarts to Snape. I have a feeling he’ll find a way to keep the promise. But that means that Snape will have to act like Voldemort’s pawn.” She nodded, “you will find a way, and Draco will try to help any way he can.” He saw her looking sour at that, “we need all the help we can Ginny.” She nodded.
Harry showed them the cinema, the others not knowing what to expect. Harry had picked the first film he saw, which turned out to be an action film. The worst part was that the whole thing was an American film, with guns, and NSA agents and all kinds of things the three purebloods had never heard of. When they went out for dinner after, the three of them were questioning Harry about all the things they had seen in the film.
“Neville! What the? How?” Harry asked. But the boy didn’t answer he just walked over to the three of them hugging them all.
The plan was that when someone lost 10 fingers, they had to do a dare. Everyone agreed and some girls decided to join the boys and Hermione. Dean was the first to start. There were some laughs, and harry rarely had to put down his finger. Nothing that would really matter was actually found out. That was until someone said, “never have I ever kissed the sibling of a friend.” Harry cringed as he put one finger down, Dean and Neville all looked sheepishly at Ron when they too put down a finger.
Blaise laughs, ‟you´ve heard from your aunt about any houses?” he asks.
Harry startles, ‟no,” he pauses, ‟maybe in the beginning, but not in the end.”
“But how come they didn’t almost expel me when I blew up my aunt?” Harry asked Draco, who had no idea how Harry had blown up his aunt looked almost frightened of Harry. “I blew her up like a balloon, Draco, not like a stick of Dynamite.” This caused Hermione to laugh, though she answered his question.
‟How about tomorrow, you kick whenever I´m not paying close enough attention to the recipe,” he asks Scorpius. ‟Or when I´m cutting something wrong, yeah?”
“So,” Neville said, “is it true, did you three just rob Gringotts? And did you really escape on a Dragon?  Everyone is talking about it you know. Terry boot got beaten up by the Carrows for yelling about it in the great hall.”
Harry laughed, he lifted himself from the floor. There was no place on the bench, so he just dropped himself on Draco’s lap. The taller boy let out a grunt but wrapped his arms around Harry. “You really wanna know?” he asked. He would tell the truth, they had decided that they would do so if anyone asked about anything. Especially now that they had the okay from Kingsley.
“Well,” Draco said, “people actually just expected you to know. The rumour had been that you had been taken in by family. People thought it had to be Potter’s that were no longer connected to the family but still connected by blood. So people expected Harry to know everything.”
to look pathetic.”
“What
She opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it. Narrows her eyes.
“Wait, uou want to kiss him
don’t think so. Luna sort of…figured things out. About us.”
“You didn’t splinch either of us, so I think it’s a win.”
There’s a knock on his door and he gasps, sitting up. He doesn’t remember lying down across his messy covers, dozing off, but when he throws a glance in the mirror he can see his hair is a disaster.
“In Azkaban? No. Seems everybody just assumed that was true until it was proven false.” Draco throws himself onto his bed and pinches the bridge of his nose. The tension in his head is threatening to burst.
All of this is playing in the background, passing without much meaning through Harry’s head. His mind is busy, working, turning, taking the blueprint for a plan and molding it into something more like a prototype. Ron continues to go on about how mental Ginny is acting about finding a date while Harry looks down the table, trying to find her.
Without thinking, he steps forward and hugs her. Again, all he wants to do is go on and on about this stupid
“Apparently not,” Luna says, and for the first time Harry detects a bit of acid in her tone. She’s Ginny’s best friend, after all, but coming from her it makes his stomach drop.
His feet carry him forward without permission from his brain, but he isn’t pacing this time. They seem to have a goal in mind.
“Perfect, off you go, then!”
“I didn’t realize we were getting philosophical,” Draco says, impressed.
“Any idea why that is?”
He feels himself going red again and looks to Hermione and Ron, who both give him little nods of encouragement.
“Right. It’s
But for now, Harry is going to try. Any alternative might destroy him for good.
. He knew that the crimes in his past—the ones he’s more than made up for, if you’ll recall all of the recent events—would be resurfaced!”
Harry’s skin prickles when he realizes she’s looking directly at him. His friends notice too and are visibly confused, Hermione excluded; Harry turns around and finds Draco again, who shakes his head. Somehow McGonagall knows they’d gone down into the dungeons.
“About what?” It’s like Harry had read his mind. Or his face, maybe.
One of the Aurors steps into the room. He’s tall, muscular, an indifferent air about him. “Draco Malfoy, you are under arrest for several charges including harboring a war criminal, treason, obstruction of justice—”
She nods but doesn’t look convinced. “They told me that you would be able to stay here and heal, but it really looks like you should be transferred—”
,” Ginny mutters to Harry as they rejoin the group.
Being with another man is
is a better question, then?”
Harry sighs. “Any objections? And if so, any other suggestions?” He glances around at his six players and they all shake their heads. “I…suppose we have a name then.”
“Do you want my help or not?” Harry asks, but his tone is playful. He steps closer to Draco, amusement playing out on his face.
“Works for me.” Blaise starts to load up his plate with grilled vegetables and a few pieces of brisket as Draco begins.
“So you came to me instead of researching for yourself.”
“Saving the world is a pretty good precedent!” says an undetermined voice from the middle of the room. There’s a round of quiet laughter which Harry allows himself to partake in.
Draco sees her logic, but it’s not like he’s ever had a crush on
Not that they’d spent ages together before he’d recognized this wrench in their friendship. And the more he reflects, the more he wonders if it had been there all along, hidden by sneers and facades and a preconceived rivalry. Hadn’t Draco always quietly questioned how Harry’s eyes could capture all the green of the emeralds in the Slytherin House Cup counter, hadn’t he always loathed his dark, messy hair for all the wrong reasons?
“Yeees? Are you just realizing this? Have you not noticed my accent? Or the fact that Bella and I speak almost exclusively French?”
Ron looks at Harry, betrayed. “And you just let her do that, did you?”
Harry’s stomach rotates at the thought of that. It wan’t his intention, but the idea is suddenly tantalizing. Still, he says, “No, I just meant your head. Trust me,” he adds upon seeing that Leon’s doubt has not dissolved.
Draco is in the Room of Hidden Things. He’s alone, and he’s running. Looking for something. He can’t quite picture what it is, but he knows that when he sees it everything will make sense, he’ll just
“Something went wrong,” Harry offers after a silence.
“Well he didn’t tell me about whatever it is that’s weird between you right now, if that’s what you mean.”
“So how did all of this start?” Ron asks as they stand.
that this is something he’s been missing for years and years.
Harry bursts through the door, his hair a bit wild. “I came back as soon as I heard. Another one? Are you okay?”
Despite the damp and the cold, their words had initially carried some warmth and levity. Not anymore.
“Shut it! It was rhetorical.”
Already regretting it but knowing he won’t have any kind of peace until everything is on the table, Draco asks, “And what about Leon?”
Leon pulls away, nodding. “I’ll try to keep that in mind.”
“That’s up to you. I’m just trying to help, you know.” His voice is riddled with hurt. Like Draco pushing away while he’s trying to make things better is some cruel act.
He stretches, swings his legs out of the covers, and rises, crossing to the window to study the world. It’s the same lawn he’s always known with its patchy grass and incessant gnome issues, but lately everything feels different. Even the thick layer of disgruntled clouds is more silver lining than chance of rain. A strange sense of peace, even hope, sits light in his stomach, though he feels as though anxiety should be the primary emotion of the morning. Not that he’s complaining. He’ll take this unidentifiably sourced optimism over fear any day.
“Yes, of course,” he says. Draco can’t exactly tell what Potter’s tone indicates, aside from guilt. There’s something else, too.
“Alright, are you ready to hear about the
Draco shrugs and scoffs. “I don’t know, but he’s our Head of Bloody House, so if he can’t help me I’m properly fucked.” And with that, he slips out of their room, creeps out of Ravenclaw Tower, and slinks through the hallways to Slughorn’s office.
Truthfully, I’m not usually sentimental much. I guess things have changed a bit for me recently. And yes, I would say you’re partly to blame for that, so I would certainly hope you don’t have any complaints. This monster is partially your making!
They both stand exchanging a concerned look.
“But something so big?” Draco stands, stunned. “Hold on. This is…impossible. We destroyed the Room of Hidden Things, didn’t we?” In all their rush to get here, Draco hadn’t even stopped to consider what occurred the last time he was here.
“I know, but you won’t—”
Draco reads the letter three, four times. He runs a hand over Artemis’ head as he does, unbothered by the little love nips she attempts.
Coming from anybody else, Harry might be insulted. But she has a point, after all. The library is not a place he makes a habit of spending his time, especially not these days. Over the course of the last few days, all of the letters he’s received from Leon have been whisked directly to a tucked away corner so he can read them and grin like mad without interruption. Today, though, someone had been in his usual spot, and he was impatient, so he settled for something more in the open.
“There’s got to be another way.”
“Hello, Hermione,” he says as he approaches. He tries his best to look friendly but can’t tell how successful he is by her reaction.
tired of feeling like the privacy of his (shared) room is the only place he can exist in a space that isn’t littered with the rotting entrails of previous battles. Draco longs for reprieve, for some bloody peace. Maybe even happiness, eventually. But he’s getting ahead of himself, isn't he? When he isn’t numb, everything hurts. Feeling happiness seems just about as likely as running into a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in the Great Hall.
While it’s understandable why she’s so taken aback, her commitment to not giving Draco any kind of answer is only rubbing against his nerves. He plops back down into the bench. The gears turning in her head are practically visible, and while the idea is a bit outlandish given their history, Draco is confused why it’s taking her so much to rationalize it. She’s the smartest person in their year, after all.
would he be risking his freedom for some stupid grudge against Hogwarts?”
But every sweet memory he’d tried to conjure was rotted, soured by the images of friends and family and loved ones and his own body dashed against stone.
That being said, he’s found that he does rather enjoy cooking for many of the same reasons he loves brewing potions. Everything is lain out in a clear, linear fashion with an ingredient list and step-by-step instructions; he gets to let his motor functions take precedence as he prepares his food, cutting and peeling and crushing and stirring.
“She says hi to you two, by the way,” Harry adds, raising the letter again to confirm that she had, in fact, included such a casual greeting. Though, McGonagall always did seem to have a soft spot for the trio. Ron and Hermione give each other a slightly puzzled look but both chuckle.
‟Started well,” Harry says, ‟until Scorpius started moving. That was a bit distracting.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, interrupting the two boys, “am I hallucinating or are you actually working on the essay for potions?” she asked.
‟You guys don´t know where Ron and Hermione are perchance?” Harry asks instead of answering. Dean frowns but nods, ‟can you get them? And meet us in the Room of requirement.” Dean nods again walking off.
They walk into the infirmary, Harry removing his arm and walking in by Draco´s side. Draco gives him a sideways look, before handing him his bag, ‟I think you can take it from here,” he says. ‟Meet me in the room after,” he whispers quickly before walking out.
He looked as he saw Voldemort pointed his wand at Neville, the hat went on his head, Neville’s body going rigid. Then seconds later the hat bursts into flames. Seconds later the sound of Gwap running over to Hagrid was heard. The other Giants ran at the half-giant. Death Eaters broke ranks.
Lucius appeared in the courtroom, much like Dolohov had appeared when Harry had watched the memories of Dumbledore in his fourth year. There was a bar around him, keeping him closed in. He was tied to a chair, his hands secured to both armrests. His hair was almost grey and his face sunken in. Harry heard Draco breathe in sharply. He took his hand, hoping it would help him a bit. Draco squeezed Harry’s hand in thanks.
Harry corners Ron a few moments later. ‟Mate,” Harry says, ‟I have to ask you something.”
No one was in the bathroom as far as they knew, but that didn’t mean someone could just walk in. Draco gracefully lifted himself to a standing position, wiping of whatever had spilt from his mouth. He grinned at Harry, tugging at his own erection lazily. He moved back until he was against the opposite wall of the stall. Harry taking no time to move forward, dropping to his knees as well.
“It’s mainly cursed against non-family members,” Draco said, sitting down next to Harry, Hermione sitting next to Ron. “Though, I guess some death eaters could have cursed stuff for the hell of it.” The two boys nodded at that. “But all my stuff is already moved to Potter Manor.”
She walks through the room and pushes open a door. ‟Dining room, or office,” she shrugs, ‟we used it as a dining room.”
Dean and Seamus look at each other bewildered before laughing. ‟You seem to know your muggle sports.”
‟Another one,” he says with a smile. He laughs brightly, ‟we´ll have to see if we can add a room,” he says, ‟or this time we have to give up the office.”
“That was a compliment,” Sirius said, “Remus is really weird with complements, right moony?” he said louder over his shoulder, to which Remus only reacted with a middle finger.
Draco gapes at his mother, and Harry chuckles. ‟I used to want to be an Auror, but now I want to teach defence,” Harry tells Narcissa when she asks what he´s going to do. ‟I´ll start my defence apprenticeship next September. It might be hard with Scorpius already one, but I think we´ll manage.”
They both opened their respective binders looking through it. Hermione commenting on the things she read. With their input, they walked through most of the points. But they wouldn’t decide until they at least got Pansy and Blaise’s thoughts. Draco will ask them Saturday, as he wanted to do it in person and not over owl post.
‟You can´t tell me you´re not the least bit curious,” Draco whispers. ‟I mean Regulus is an obvious Hufflepuff, and Alyssa very much a Slytherin.” Harry laughs and nods, ‟but Scorpius, I´ve never been sure.”
,” Harry said, sinking through his knees, “
“Okay,” Draco said, turning around in Harry’s arms, “teach me, Oh captain, my captain.”
‟Harry, you gotta wake up love,” Harry blinks his eyes open lazily. The world is blurry, and it takes some time for him to realise it´s because someone took his glasses.
“What move?” Dean asked while Seamus said, “you are moving out?”
The house is filled to the brim with their new stuff. Paintings stacked against the wall and boxes filling the living room.
“No,” Harry said, “I’m going to use it. As Draco said, I can find out where he is, what he’s doing, at the moments that he’s most vulnerable. I hate that I see this, but it could help us. And right now we need whatever we can get.”
Harry feels himself relax, relief flooding his system. None of his friends hate him or are disgusted by him.
Harry shook his head, “no, no,” he said, breath slow, controlled, “you just enjoy,” he smirked. He grabbed his wand, pointing it at his fingers, coating them with lube. He moved slightly back but didn’t move from Draco’s lap. He moved his lubed fingers behind him, moving them around the small ring. Slowly he pushed one finger in, letting out a low groan.
Harry laughed at Ron’s perplexed look. Even though the boy was so observant, when it came to his family he could be pretty blind.
“So you knew?” Harry asks. Draco nods. “How come you know and they don’t. If I saw their reaction when I said I’d let you step on me, they don’t think we are friends.” He pauses, “we are friends right? Why else would you know and not them.”
Sirius, still sitting on his desk, instead of sitting behind or standing in front of his desk, clapped his hands, gathering everyone's attention. “Good morning. Now, some of you may know me personally and others may have only heard tales waxed lyrically about me, but I imagine not everyone has so I’ll introduce myself before we actually start.”
“But the wand is mine, I stole it from the last master’s tomb.” Riddle screeched.
‟You´re always welcome to stay with me if it ever comes to that,” she says, ‟though I imagine Molly would say the same.” She laughs, ‟you´ll have your hands full with the number of people ready to help you.”
“Wait,” Harry said, remembering Dobby saying people had told him about Harry, “Are you the one that told Dobby about me?” he teased.
“Uh,” he said, “do as you’ve done before?” She nodded, snipping her fingers. A pot of Floo powder appeared on the mantle of the fireplace. Hermione looked at him with a disapproving look, “what did you want me to say?” he asked, but she just shook her head and pursed her lips.
Suddenly a silver Weasel appeared at the table, Arthur’s voice came through, “Minister For Magic coming with me.”
Sirius chuckled, “I honestly expected this question before.” He turned to Draco, “you might not be my godson, but you are my cousin. Not just some cousin, but a Black family member that doesn’t care that I was a Gryffindor, that doesn’t care that I love a werewolf. You accept me as who I am and you are family, I think that’s all the reasons I need to choose you as my best man.” Draco nodded, smiling at the other men. “Also,” Sirius said, “Remus asked if he could ask Harry, and they have a closer connection than he and I have. And I am a sucker for Remus’ puppy dog eyes.” Draco laughed at that, Sirius joining.
“Don’t” came Myrtles voice from inside, “Tell me what’s wrong… I can help…”
“That you’re what?” Ron asks with his eyes wide.
“It is unclear when he found out that the founder of the house could talk to snakes, and if he had been impressing his fellow students with the talent. If he did none of this had been heard about but the staff. Though he never showed remorse for what he did in the orphanage, he seemed polite, quiet and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly the whole staff was enamoured by him.”
“Okay, okay,” Hermione conceded. “We need a plan.”
“What do you have there Harry,” Hermione asked. Curse her curious mind.
Draco started kissing down Harry’s body, moving from his mouth to his neck, to his collarbone, there he kept kissing, sucking lightly, biting, after leaving a love bite, he moved down to Harry’s nipples. He teased Harry’s nipples, Harry whimpered at the sensation. Slowly Draco moved down, he kissed over Harry’s stomach, working his pants open, while kissing down to his love trail. Finally opened his pants, he moved them down, working them off of Harry’s legs.
“It was Ron who suggested it actually,” Harry said, done with the expectations that only Hermione was the smart person in the group. “Will we be able to figure out what he did with the objects, to make them so important to them?”
Harry nodded, “it’s only because of Draco that I survived, really. If it was up to Dumbledore,” the name still created a bitter taste in his mouth, “I wouldn’t have.” Draco’s arms tightened around his waist. Harry laid one hand atop his. “He wanted me to live, so I could die when the time was right for him. Didn’t even care that about what the muggles I lived with did,” he saw peoples eyes flitting towards his arm, “or that I was just a fucking child.”
‟You tired? I can unpack some more, I don´t mind,” Draco says.
‟Well, the prophet did write an article about it. I just asked if it was indeed correct in the engagement.” Andromeda says, ‟Don´t blame your mother.”
“No,” Draco said, “I-“ he paused, he didn’t know if he could talk about it really. If it wasn’t common news, there must be a reason. Though, at the same time, the whole Gryffindor squad knew, so why couldn’t his friends. He looked at Harry who shrugged.
Sunday morning, they board the train, and they go back to London for the very last time. Mrs Weasley is surprised to see Harry and Draco, but she hugs both. There are some stares, but with the glamour on the baby bump, it's all speculation.
“Then why did you take the dark mark?” Hermione asked, “If you are so against Voldemort,” both Ron and Draco flinched at the name, “why did you join him.”
The man behind the counter looked Harry up and down slowly. “You can just pay, sir,” he said, smiling cheekily, “just let me take off the tracking spell.” He walked closer tapping every piece of clothing with his wand. He smiled at Harry. “Would you like to pay cash, or will you transfer it from a Gringotts account?”
That morning, more Order members arrived, they all had been told about the meeting that he would be having, and had all be summoned to Grimmauld place. The group was small, but enough that the dining room was packed. Harry, the only one who knew what it would be about, was fidgeting in his chair. Sirius, who was sitting next to him, lay a hand on his shoulder, Harry relaxed into it.
The two of them ran up to the tower, getting changed into something that they could fly in. When they arrived at the pitch they saw Dean and Seamus there as well. The two called them over when they saw the two boys had joined them. Together they had a quick game with the quaffle, mainly just racing around throwing it to each other.
“I do,” Harry says, “you see. Draco told me some things. Mainly how we’re engaged and that I live with him. He also told me that I didn’t know how you’ll react and that I was going to tell you last Friday. That’s why I hid it.”
“They are actually pretty fun,” Harry tells Draco when they are walking back to Hogwarts. “Very different than what I had in mind, though,” he adds, “I had no idea what to expect of them.”
Harry looked around, seeing others doing the same. Some were staring hard into their hoops, people trying to concentrate. Harry looked at the stone inside the hoop, working hard to focus. Trying to think of nothing else besides the hoop.
They wound up in a little sandwich shop in the centre of London. “I actually wanted to ask you something,” Draco said when they finally got their sandwiches. “I know we discussed the Honeymoon, and said we’d go to India in a year,” Harry nodded, “but I also think we deserve at least some fun after we get married. Maybe a small trip abroad.”
‟I lack subtlety,” Harry answers, ‟but the hat did seem to think I would have been good there.”
‟So?” Draco asks. ‟I don´t care how your body looks. I like you for you Harry, your mind, your heart. Yeah, I´m gay, but you´re still a man, aren´t you? If you grew a vagina would that make you a woman?” Harry shakes. ‟It doesn´t. But to be honest, I think it´s bloody hot to know that you´re growing our child in there.”
“Saturday,” he said, “they’re coming to Hogsmeade, so we’ll meet them there. They’re mad at Draco because he didn’t tell them we were dating, let alone that we are bonded now.”
Draco just finished when Hermione walked up to their door again. They once again called her to enter, having to with the spell. She had a black liquid eyeliner in her hand. “It’s a muggle version because that’s the one my mum taught me to work with.”
‟McGonagall was married?” Harry asks, ‟and lived there?”
She takes it with a bright smile, ‟I´m happy for both of you. How far along are you?”
Only Friday night had all the eight years and seventh years finished their exams. The eight years sent Ginny and Luna out to invite all the seventh years to the tower so they could all party together. They might not have been in classes with them, but they too deserved a good party for that.

“Hmm?” Harry replied, suddenly becoming a bit distant.
Thanks for reading. All comments are welcome.
PS: I wanted to use a different font for Draco's letter or upload an image for it, but I couldn't get it to work. If anyone has more formatting knowledge than me and wants to give me a hand it would be greatly appreciated.

Plus, he still needs to ask Molly if Draco might eventually join them. And delve into the myriad of questions that will inevitably conjure.
There’s another moment where Draco considers it, can somehow
“I’ll think about it,” Draco finally says. Now that it’s been brought up, there is something about that career path that seems inviting and fulfilling. Being given the chance to spend his life trying to help others in such a meaningful way? It feels like it could be a second chance, a way to rewrite all of his past wrongs.
“As you all know, we have a fair amount of Beauxbatons students who will be joining us for some time, and they’ll be arriving shortly along with their headmistress Madame Maxime, whom some of you may remember from their stay here during the Triwizard Tournament. We will be splitting these students up between the three dormitories.”
Finally, he collects himself and stands up. He makes to leave and almost runs headfirst into Hermione.
The return to the Burrow had been a mixture of pungent emotion. Joyful, disappointing, comforting. All of this mixed with Draco’s situation has had Harry on edge since their arrival.
Harry hums. “Very true.”
“I’m going to go grab us some seats inside,” Hermione says, then she plants a quick kiss on Ron’s cheek and she’s gone.
“I think I do,” Harry says, smiling at Leon as he stops for a moment to admire one of the suits of armor that line the halls. “Just don't expect to be a master of getting around after just one tour. I still get lost sometimes.”
Something cold touches Harry’s calf. He looks down and sees that Leon’s robes are dripping wet.
Leon shakes his head. “We don’t know.
“I trust his judgement. We’ve made sure to leave room in the schedules of students who might be interested in taking the class, so there’s nothing to worry about there.”
“I’m so sorry, Ron was right, we should just go back—”
“I think you should take that job,” Leon says suddenly, not breaking eye contact.
“So…were you discussing plans for what happens next?”
“Stop that,” Ginny says, voice rising again in frustration. “I feel like I’m the only bloody person in this damn castle who doesn’t know which way is up anymore.”
Harry gasps. “Now that’s just cheating!”
“We reckoned we were safer on the property so no Muggles would see or hear us. Blimey, Harry, we were even calling your name for a good ten minutes at one point. There’s that big bloody hole in the side so we figured you might hear us.”
“What is there to process?” he says with more volume than intended. He pulls back as he continues. “Leon isn’t even going to remember meeting me.”
He spends a lot of time thinking about things like that now. About what might have happened had it not been for the war. It doesn’t hurt quite as much as it used to, especially when he considers the way he feels on a regular basis. It’s like the trauma of it all plucked the thing out of his heart that was black and vile. It’s not completely gone, he can tell that much, but most of it is. That’s all he can really ask for.
He sighs. “Alright, I’ll play along.”
“Oh, shut up,” Draco says and closes the small distance between them, one hand going to Harry’s face and the other to his waist. Their lips crash together and Draco’s wand literally sparks in his waistband, which makes them both startle and laugh. Still, the kiss doesn’t stop. Draco finds himself up against the same wall where Harry had been leaning moments prior, narrowly avoiding a similar head injury.
. I’d like that.”
They both stand, the sun starting to drop in the sky, casting a multitude of colors across the sky that surrounds them.
“You were right,” she says. Her eggs must be fascinating, because she refuses to look up from her plate. Redness returns to her face.
A silence breaches between them. Neither breaks eye contact. Harry smiles, defeated.
Harry licks his lips, genuinely considering pulling Leon out of the room to lecture him on why he won’t accept being undermined. But he quickly regains his composure and slips into a faux cheerful tone. “Oh well, things like this happen in such a hands on class.” He steps forward and retrieves his wand from the ground and it feels like the whole room exhales in relief.
“You haven’t told anybody this before?” Harry eventually asks once Leon has calmed down.
Leon gives him a resigned look and nods. “No, that wouldn’t be weird.”
Nothing happens.
“He does have this way of making me feel like I could be a normal person.”
Harry frowns, but Ron is already walking away. Oh well. He’s sure he’ll hear about it later. He continues toward the pitch and laughs to himself when he hears “Afternoon, shite breath!”, indicating that Ginny and Ron have crossed paths somewhere behind him.
“Anything fun?”
“I’m glad! It’s great to have you on our team. It should be a good season.”
“Hogwarts has a multitude of mysterious and undisclosed areas, many of them under the surface. I’m sure Mister Potter knows a little something about that.”
to take on, especially in his current emotional state. “Er, I, I guess I’ll think about it.” The thought of living under the same roof as Harry makes his pulse thunder through his veins, and what Hermione said hasn’t gone unprocessed, either. “Do you really feel that way?”
Something suddenly feels off to Harry. Peculiar. He’s hyper aware, now, of how close Leon is walking to him, of how he keeps glancing over. Of the way he said “ex.”
“I’m saying I trust you. And by making you Prefect, all of Hogwarts and then by extension their families will
“Are you serious? Half the people in that room only ended up getting it by luck. You were right on target every time.”
McGonagall sets her own tea down. “Well, that depends. What exactly is it that you want to do post-graduation?”
“I’m going to stop you. So you’re saying that this friend of yours sent
Now it’s Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “Only briefly. You know how crazy things are, we have to keep each other in the loop and all that.”
“I don’t doubt it,” Harry says with a big smile. He pats Ginny on the shoulder and turns, practically bounces back to the Gryffindor table.
“You’re fine?” he asks, not bothering to doctor his tone. She’s right about his hair of course, but now feels like a bad time to discuss why.
A moment goes by and neither utters a word.
“No, Draco. I’m serious. Not just the magic, although that was admittedly very impressive.” Draco smiles. That means something coming from her. “But you threw yourself in front of a swarm of Dementors, and you’d never cast a proper Patronus before. Not very Slytherin of you.”
“Oh,” Luna says. “I suppose I shouldn’t have said that.”
“I hadn’t given it much thought, truthfully. I’ve been rather occupied lately,” he says drily.
Another chapter? Madness!!! Notes at the end, as always :) Please leave a comment if you're enjoying!!!
“That would be the investigation, yes.”
“Leon,” he chokes out, his grip on Ginny and the other girl slipping. Their arms hit the floor and the man grins, only with the left side of his face.
Draco nods and presses his sleeve to his eyes. His legs are beginning to shake from crouching; he’ll chalk the tears up to that.
“You can…touch me, if you want to,” Leon says. There’s nothing suggestive in his voice—though maybe there’s something in the pause—but it’s a genuine invitation either way.
The look he gives Harry must not be convincing, because as he stands he adds, “I can ask Ron and Hermione to come along as well, if that makes you feel better.”
The irony of that. There’s no evidence against Draco and he’s certain there will be a social rebellion against his existence, but if he tried to bring his knowledge of Leon’s involvement to counter the allegations, he would be shut down immediately because of Leon’s ties to the wonderful Harry Potter. It makes his blood boil, the way justice is evading him, but if he doesn’t time everything correctly, Draco knows it will all blow up in his face.
“Nothing has changed since you asked me that question two days ago, so yes.”
“You’re welcome,” Draco says, and finds that it feels rather nice just to accept the gratitude. He follows Hermione to Harry’s bed, where he places himself as far from Leon as he can and does his best to watch without Leon noticing. Luckily, the blond is too invested in fawning over Harry. It’s possible he missed it, but Draco never hears any mention of Leon’s hasty departure from the ball. No need for him to call attention to it, Draco supposes.
“Do you know—“
“It was just supposed to be research,” Harry says. “I never intended on actually
Ron huffs. “I don’t know. Part of me wants to, but what’s the point? Hooch already chose him. I wasn’t good enough for her, and the team knows that, and
She laughs and he frowns. “Yes, of course I do! And even if the whole world did decide to hate you—which would
“The point is, he’s
“I’m thinking that I’m going to be doing a lot of thinking.”
A polite round of applause comes and goes.
Yay! Another chapter! This one sort of got away from me in the best way and went in directions that weren't quite planned, but either way I'm very pleased with how this one turned out!
“That’s blood magic for you. Does this sound like it may be in the realm of possibility?”
Because in the middle of the hall is an enormous chasm, and something inside is dragging Hogwarts down into itself.
“As you may know, Harry and I have sort of…become friends.”
“I wish I could talk to him,” Harry says, his voice just barely audible.
“I had my suspicions. You were never really that great with girls, Harry, you must admit,” she says, cracking a fond smile. “At first I thought it was just a sort of awkward yet ultimately endearing thing about you, but especially with what’s been going on recently, I started to put some pieces together.”
The humor in her voice is like sunlight on skin; it teases him further out of a shell that’s hardened over the hours. She isn’t making fun of him, though. No. She knows exactly what it’s like to see people the way Harry had. For months, their dreams had been rife with grisly images that magnified and yet couldn’t compete with the blunt mundanity of the real thing.
“Like Quidditch. And Defense, even. I was wondering if maybe you would help me out with my Patronus.”
. Although the semantics of that might not be worth the inquiry.
“Well, Ron used to tell me all of these stories about the kind of petty things the two of you got up to because of whatever silly rivalry you had. It sounded more to me like something else was going on, but I chalked that up to being so comfortable with my own sexuality and seeing little things like that in everything around me. Projection and all that.” He sighs. “It’s rather nice to be right, though.”
Harry nods, scratching the back of his head.
He spins in a circle and takes in this patch of the Room of Hidden Things, this territory where he’d spent much of his sixth year at Hogwarts. “It should be right here,” he says, pointing with a shaky finger. “Where’s it gone?”
is going on, but the nature of the danger is still a big mystery.”
“I...will let you know when I start to figure it out myself,” Harry says gently, feeling utterly heavy. “What I do know is that you have to compartmentalize. Let yourself feel it in bursts. Don’t entertain what-ifs. Know now that someone else knows and doesn’t think of you negatively for it. If anything, I think you’re brave—for going through it,
Slughorn pauses, following Draco’s gaze.
. Leon’s words replay in his head. “I messed up.
Harry’s throat nearly collapses at the sound of Leon’s name.
“I’m sorry, I…” Draco says. He fights a bubbling pool of nausea that threatens to boil over his edge as he takes a step away. Had he misread?
“Oh?”
“I’ll see you around though, yeah?”
“You’re a bloody git.”
Harry feels like a walking cliche. There’s a bounce in his step, a smile stuck on his face. The colors in the world seem more vibrant, the light a little bit brighter. So bright it’s nearly blinding, really. And though his reputation has never really been something he’s worried about, it does feel nice not to have people questioning his magical abilities everywhere he goes.
Harry’s pulse is rapid and he’s starting to sweat in the sunlight. The story brings back memories of the Battle of Hogwarts, of students frantically checking in with each other as they dodged curses and tried to hold their ground.
“What about the library?” he asks as she starts to trim away. The metallic snips that exile his overgrown platinum locks are music to him, freeing him of the literal weight that has been hanging around his head.
“I don’t mean that,” Harry says, eyes locked on Draco’s.
“You seem...unsettled,” she says tentatively. “It’s all right to say no, if you truly don’t think you’re the right fit. But as your Head of House, and as someone who knows who you are and what you’re capable of, I personally think people have a lot to learn from you. We're living through the unprecedented, and currently, this is the only immediate solution to a rather serious problem. I wish there were another candidate for the position, but in the meantime I think you'll do just fine.”
“Harry,” Draco starts, but he swallows the words. It’s not worth another argument, not here or now. “I understand,” he says instead. His heart is being torn in half, pulled in opposite directions. Harry needs to know the truth, but Draco doesn’t want to fight with him again. Even if Harry would never want to be with him now, it kills Draco to know what Leon is doing under his nose.
hadn’t interfered much with his flying is another point of tension release. Although, working with Weasley for the whole term will certainly be a challenge. Sure, he’s changed his mind significantly regarding Harry Potter, but
“But I do, Draco. My whole life since coming to Hogwarts has been glorified on the front page of the
In the middle of the room, Harry and Hermione are still both on the ground. Looking at the scene is like a jagged blade in Draco’s side, like he’s bleeding but can’t feel the gash. He can’t understand where this apathetic blight is originating from, only knows that everybody is more in shock than in panic, and that’s enough for him right now.
“Right, Harry?”
“Shut up,” he snaps, his father's face flashing through his mind. “Just. Shut up.”
“You’re a prat.”
She holds up a hand to stop him. “Harry Potter, there will be no arguing today. We are
OK, that's all I'm retiring from my soapbox. I know that's not what y'all come here for, but that's what's going on in the real world and I don't think it's fair to have even a fairly small platform like this one and not address important issues like these. Anyways, hope y'all are well and enjoying how things are playing out! I'm very excited to hear thoughts on this one, because it starts to hint at some major plot points for the final stretch of things. :) <3
“I’m going to talk to Slughorn before this blows up and I have to avoid showing my face for the next week.”
He grins as everybody gets into position once more. “To reiterate, I am
“I’m well aware of that, but
Christie nods. “I guess so!”
The girl is swiftly escorted away from the entrance to the dungeons, even despite her begging that she go look for her friend. The pleas toe the line between earnest and hysterical, and Draco frowns when a tear forms and falls from his eye. Empathy has never been his strong suit; he doesn’t even know this girl, but the way she kicks and reaches as she’s practically dragged away tugs at something inside him.
“Go!”
“Well thanks, Ginny,” he says. “I appreciate the support. I imagine you’ll be a sort of leading figure as well. That’s always been your nature.”
Ron’s bristles seem to lie flat and he relaxes back into his chair. Harry takes a deep breath.
The information stuns Draco. Harry Potter unable to conjure his Patronus? That doesn’t seem likely.
“It sounded like you,” Hermione says as she examines the wall where the door had been.
He’s alone at the Slytherin table for dinner. Well, he’s surrounded by other students—primarily the Beauxbatons lot, still—but Draco has the not-uncommon talent of feeling deserted in a crowded room. It doesn’t help that he sees Pansy also sitting by herself some ways down. Though they’d certainly patched some things up, and both are clearly grasping at straws for a social life, he has to respect that she’s doing work on herself and that can be an isolating process.
He looks down at his feet, unable to meet her eye. Mostly, he doesn’t want her to see that he’s started to cry again.
“Fuck.”
“You can’t keep beating yourself up like this. It’s not healthy. And it makes me sad to think that you’re dwelling on it. I see how bad you feel, and I don’t want you to feel that way. I really mean it when I say that some time away allowed me to clear my head. I feel like a completely different person coming back.”
It’s all come on so suddenly, but through this new lens so much makes sense. It feels like finally waking up and seeing colors the way they’re meant to be seen. Harry thinks again about Leon opening up to him, pouring his heart out on Harry’s chest, taking comfort in him,
“Well, he…he
“Fine. I suppose that’s fair.”
“What?”
He crosses the lawn, tall, green grass tickling his ankles, grown clean over the stones leading up to the door. His hand is on the knob and he turns back toward the street, seeing both Ron and Hermione talking to each other fervently. He takes a deep breath and turns back around, twisting the knob as he does.
He’s suddenly struck by an odd terror, a panic that grips his lungs and squeezes until they can’t pull in air. The sensation is a flash, there and gone in a second, but it echoes through his muscles, a warm, rolling wave of adrenaline that makes him want to run. It’s odd, almost external, like someone has cast some charm on him and forced him into anxiety.
“She’s right, mate,” Ron says and pats Harry on the back. “Even before Dorsey got a hold of him, he wanted to try to make things work.”
They go to join Hermione in the Great Hall.
Ron shrugs. “I’m just not convinced that they’re any less slimy than they were before the war, that’s all. He deserves to know!”
Harry sighs. “Eventually, I suppose it’s only right. But not yet. Once everything has blown over, then I’ll start thinking about how to go about doing that.”
“Well,” Ron starts carefully, pulling open the wooden door. “The two of you sort of had something going on at one point, and I was wondering—”
He turns to see Headmistress McGonagall bustling toward him, her expression stoic.
Draco Malfoy’s voice, crystalline through the fog: “
“No, I feel as sane as ever.”
“Right. That’s beside the point. It’s all handled, so if you’ll just come with me.”
“Well, it’s much more your thing than it was his, that’s for sure.”
“And you’re sure there aren’t any Slytherins in the Great Hall right now?”
That’s why he’s waiting in the courtyard for his friends. For Draco. Harry needs to be in motion, needs to push forward to whatever comes next. He’s spent his whole fucking life dwelling on the past, and he’s good and tired of that. There are conversations that need to happen, of course. People who have been left behind, who have forgotten, who can’t
“You look incredibly handsome,” Leon murmurs under the din. He gives Harry’s hand a squeeze but quickly pulls away.
“I thank you all for your patience!” Madam Hooch calls as she steps back toward the group. Many are lounging in the grass, eagerly reliving every detail of each match. It’s late afternoon, a warm breeze caressing the Quidditch pitch as the sun starts its descent.
“Stop,” Harry says and shakes his head. “Don’t do that.”
“And by that logic I’m a Malfoy,” Harry responds. “Does that make this incestuous?”
Draco turns the heat up yet again, watching his cauldron closely. Ironic that something intended to heal burns requires so much heat.
Harry frowns. “To be fair, we decided to give it a shot before all of the drama presented itself. It wasn’t quite as insane several hours ago.”
“Hello, Harry. It’s wonderful to see you.”
“The ball, Harry. Will you be my date?”
Leon nods and joins Harry as they leave the pitch. “You did a really good job out there. I mean, I knew you would. I’ve already seen you teach, and this isn’t so different.”
“I can’t tell you.”
He’d been turned away from the hospital wing. Again. That Pamela girl apparently has an apprenticeship there, and is even scarier than Madam Pomfrey. Their conversation had gone something like this:
“Whoo!” Ron screams from the front. “Patronus impotence my arse!”
With one last look at his new friend, Harry turns the handle of the door and slams it open.
Hermione nods. “I think that answers that. Don’t you, Ron?”
“Hello, Harry.”
Ron sighs but nods, then turns from the crowd and takes a quick sip. “Hermione’s enchanted it,” he says as he turns back and wipes his mouth. “Fits a whole bottle.”
“As for your recon, I completely understand the rationale behind the desire to have that information going in. I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad idea, but I’m not sure if it’s a reliable plan. If you’re close enough to this person to consider asking them to be your date but you don’t know what their sexuality is, then it’s likely that they’re quite closeted if they
“You’ve already seen just how fast word can spread around Hogwarts,” Harry counters. “Even if we make it through the ball itself, we then have to think about the next day, and the one after, and then the whole future. We agreed—”
far be it from him to deny someone the opportunity to learn from
“Or like somebody who grew up with Muggles.”
Slughorn taps on his desk nervously and adjusts his glasses. “Well, while you’re here, why not talk about the future?”
“Pleasure!” Hermione says, grinning.
Pansy lays a hand on top of his. “I really appreciate this, Draco. I know things won’t change overnight, but…I feel like I have at least a starting point now. Thank you.”
“He was a Death Eater, but only towards the beginning,” Draco mutters so only Harry can hear. “I haven’t seen him in years. He was loyal but unstable, and even Voldemort wanted nothing to do with him. Which means...”
“And who’s going to hire you if you haven’t passed your N.E.W.T.s for those subjects?”
McGonagall clears her throat. “A rather unfortunate occurrence, of course, and a highly illegal branch of magic.”
Harry laughs again, shrugging. “I wanted to see what would happen.”
“Afternoon, everybody,” Harry says cheerfully as he enters.
“You’re not sounding like the impulsive, headstrong hero I’ve heard you to be.”
Draco wants to bite back, but he sees the distress she’s in, so instead he bites his tongue.
The blonde girl continues to stare out the window, the world around them now green. “It just doesn’t make sense to keep the fourth House around. I reckon we’ll have to be re-sorted,” she says, seemingly unfazed.
Narcissa sighs. “So I’m supposed to tell people I’ve eaten all these biscuits myself?”
Draco looks around, a strange melancholy setting in. Part of it is due to the knowledge that he’ll have to clean and pack. But oddly enough, this room in Ravenclaw Tower feels more like home than his old room ever had.
Harry glances back and forth between Pamela and Leon. Draco had been accusing him of being in two places at once, and Harry had been too blind to see how that was possible, to remember he’s taken Polyjuice himself, that magic doesn’t always make sense.
to talk to
Pansy gives a gasp, looking between Blaise and Draco frantically.
Harry licks his lips. His pulse thumps in his wrists, the underside of his jaw. “We’re sort of…together.”
“I recognize that many of you will not get a chance to play this term, but as I said earlier, there may be more opportunities down the line. I make no promises, of course, but there is always next year as well. For most of you,” she says solemnly.
“Right,” he says, his head far off. “Something to think about.” With everything going on, he’s gone a bit off track in terms of thinking about his future. There’s still time, but not much. Not enough. But there’s never enough time.
“Harry. No, I’m not mad.” His tone is deliberate now, something that is a rarity for Ron Weasley. There’s a comfort in that. Harry can tell he’s taking this seriously. “I have nothing to be mad
“Well, you must have some more details about what the field entails. And there are subdivisions, of course, and—”
Harry purses his lips and harrumphs. “That’s…a good question. I hadn’t thought much beyond finding you and making sure you’re okay.”
Leon looks up at him from the couch. “Look, I really want to go to this ball with you. And
His hesitation to answer
“Yeah, see you, Ginny.”
“I reckon I’m done for the rest of my life,” Harry says, and even in the tension of the moment they both chuckle.
want. Within reason,” he says, the corners of his mouth twitching into a smile. “I recognize that there’s a lot about you’re past that I don’t know. Whatever this is, it clearly means something to you. Maybe it’s just new and that can be terrifying. I care about you, and you don’t need to apologize for being honest about your level of comfort.”
given the opportunity?”
“Excellent. Now, I believe I owe you a conversation?”
The trek up to the Hospital Wing feels long, belabored. Draco jumps at every noise, always ready to block whatever spell may be coming his way. His trust in his relative safety while in the castle has collapsed—what little of it was left, anyway. And Merlin knows what Harry’s told Leon about him. Would he be so stupid to confess to Leon that they’d had a moment, even if that moment involved Draco throwing accusations Leon’s way?
this feels. But maybe it’s imperative that it does; if Draco stops for a moment and thinks about why he’s here, it takes him the better part of an hour to dredge himself up out of his anxiety. He knows because it happens several times a day.
Draco clears his throat. “I know what I saw,” he says, trying to maintain the pride in his voice.
Harry closes his eyes and inhales through his nose. “Are you working on a potion that makes the ingester wildly cryptic?”
They pull him over the threshold and something in him loosens, then snaps.
Ron is lying on his bed, tossing a little ball up into the air over and over. “Didn’t you say you always sort of had feelings for him once you figured out the whole gay thing? Even when you were with Leon? That’s got to be well before he started to feel strongly enough to project that onto you.”
Harry looks at him, resigned. “Well, that’s my life.”
Harry smiles. “I hadn’t thought of it that way.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, fighting the urge to lean in and stick his head into the crook of Leon’s neck. “This isn’t how things were supposed to go.” Now, stronger than anything, more potent even than the fear and the nerves, is the sense of guilt, of Leon being stuck with Ginny (which was her own request, Harry can’t seem to forget) and shoved back into the corner of the room.
and as much as Harry wants to take things slow and do things right, there’s a cute boy who’s leaning up against him who would rather be kissing him than listening to him etching pointless words into parchment.
“Investigate all you like. You’ll find nothing,” she says, and it’s somewhere between a falsehood and reality. The truth doesn’t lie within the walls of Hogwarts, it’s stored in Draco’s magical memory, in the millions of cells that blinked out and were kick-started back to life. They won’t find anything just by searching the castle.
Harry’s heart plummets, smacking some arbitrary floor and cracking in half. He puts what pieces together that he can. These Aurors had come for Draco, clearly. The
“No, professor, I apologize. Should I come back later?”
Harry's throat tightens. “What are we doing here?” he asks quietly and takes a few steps forward, unable to look at his friends.
“Yes,” he says, giving her space to say more if she wants to. She doesn’t. She just sniffs and nods, standing again.
Harry snorts. “Typically, no. But not really by choice. I think I just attract the abnormal wherever I go.”
Draco stammers for a second. “Well, no, not entirely. You see, my friend is…male.” Again, her expression is unchanged. “And he’s wondering if Harry is even…gay,” Draco finishes, trying to get used to the way the word sounds in his mouth.
He offers a small smile and turns to leave. Then:
“So, you lot! Congratulations again on making it this far. It’s going to be an
Someone runs out of the castle and up to the headmistress, then whispers something in her ear. It seems that relief washes over her.
“Good. And what about that Leon guy? I haven’t seen him around much. Thought the two of you were hanging about.”
“I’ll do it.”
“I mean, you remember how it is even adding one new person to a team. They have to adjust at their own pace. So now multiply that by seven…”
“First of all, I still think you’re an absolute idiot for what you did. I just want to make that clear. But…I’ve been thinking about that conversation we had, and I realize I may have been a notch harsher than what was deserved. So. I’m sorry.”
So he does. He tells her about the walls coming to life and devouring Draco’s limbs, about the panic of the moment. Before him a whole chasm of panic. Thousand of ideas fluttering around above his head until a few pieces of information formed a haphazard bridge across the bottomless gap, a bridge that he barreled across with no hesitation. A slice to each palm, two matching scars, the mingling of feuding blood, a tight squeeze and a brief sensation of being too powerful for his own good. Quiet, then so much noise, all at once. Whirlwinds of questions and explanations. And, the oddest bit, no real consequences. Not yet.
The Snitch’s wings had unfolded in his hands to his surprise. “But...he played Chaser. I don’t understand.”
What ever happened to Mari? Draco got so caught up in a leftover Death Eater trying to overtake Hogwarts that he has’t even thought about his own therapist. Probably at St. Mungo’s still. Maybe he could pay her a visit. Is that allowed? Can confidentiality be breached if Draco is the one who chooses to breach it?
“Malfoy, why did you take this class?” Harry asks out of the blue.
“Besides, if I really mess anything up…” She steps in front of him and waggles her wand back and forth. “I
“I’ll see you at dinner,” he mutters and hurries off, unsure of what had possessed him to preach to her the way he did.
to begin with!”
Harry starts to stammer out a response, but closes his mouth. Remembers his conversation with McGonagall just moments ago. If she’s on his side, if his friends are on his side, then what
Maybe it can be good for all of them.
“I did, as a matter of fact,” she says, voice all ice and bruise.
Mari sighs. “Listen, I’m going to go make myself some tea. Do you want anything?”
and waits for Harry to offer some guidance on what might happen next.
His mind wanders as he heads for the Great Hall, eyes too tired to fully register the arrows of disdain that approach from all sides. Classes don’t start until Monday, so he hadn’t been counting on so many people being up and about this early on a Saturday morning. As he approaches his destination, his confusion grows at the sight of a large crowd forming just outside the large doors.
“Oh, Harry, your socks!” Mrs. Weasley cries, shooing him forcefully back toward the house. “Take those off before you go inside, I don’t need you tracking mud through my kitchen!”
“Well, no sense in falling apart,” she says, voice high and breathy. “May I ask, how exactly are you planning to protect my son?”
“I’m your Prefect.”
upset Harry, like something really bad happened.”
“Oh.”
Luckily, his off-the-cuff reasoning is enough to convince everybody. Besides, he can see the ways eyelids begin to droop, how every so often somebody tries (and fails) to stifle a yawn. It’s true that they’re not in the most productive state of mind, at any rate.
Draco is about to speak but Harry holds up a finger and throws the cloak over them both. Draco almost giggles when he sees that he’s too tall for the fabric to reach the ground and his feet must still be visible, but the humor is dampened by the circumstances.
Ron snorts, shaking his head. Harry can’t help but grin.
“Lord, I don’t even know where to begin…” Leon says, inhaling sharply. Harry stops walking, turning fully to him.
Draco is only more confused now. What do the Slytherins have to do with anything? And why would Leon or his father care about them if they’re from Beauxbatons?
“Not my best introduction, I’ll admit,” she says, peering at him through round glasses.
“We never really spoke of
Madam Hooch is thanking the other players for coming out and giving it their all and encouraging them to come back whenever the next set of openings is. Some look hopeful. Others defeated. Harry reckons they’ll all try again anyway. Or hopes so, at least.
And as Draco watches as Harry curls in on himself, his features lit up by dancing flames in one of Malfoy Manor’s fireplaces, he thinks that things have never made more sense in his life.
would be as captain,” he says, putting emphasis on his friend’s first name, “I think you’ll do just as well.”
Then, the temperature plummets out of nowhere. It almost doesn’t faze Harry when there are a few gasps from the crowd, when Hermione’s hand clenches down around his arm. Someone screams and the music goes weird, then crashes to a halt.
“Right side, you’re on offense first. Wands ready everybody…”
use,” Ron adds. “I’m with Hermione here, mate. It's a bit mental to imagine you as a teacher, but it sort of makes sense, too.”
“That’s okay, I’m sure I'll have time to meet her soon enough.”
Despite himself, Draco laughs again. “Why does it sound like
“Well, we can’t have that, can we?” she jokes. “No matter. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, Harry, but you’re just as much a child to me as any of the red-haired monsters stomping around this place. Hermione too, of course, but,” she reaches out and makes a futile attempt at smoothing down his hair, “you especially. Even if it’s not by blood or marriage, it’s by choice. I choose you. Always will.”
She smiles. “I hope you do. Now let’s get down to the Great Hall. I didn’t eat a proper lunch because I was worried sick about you.”
“They…deserved it,” Leon says, his eyes unfocused.
In a similar fashion to the previous class, Harry has the class do a short writing assignment following the activity.
who is like you. Nobody. One does not simply get over Harry Potter.”
“We’ll see. Regardless, I’ll be just fine. I am rather capable, you know,” he jokes.
Draco shoves his fingernails into his own palms, the fists so tight he feels muscles straining. The two boys glare at each other for one beat, two, and then Draco closes the distance again and shoves his finger in Harry’s face. His fingertip is stained dark red; he’s drawn blood with his nails. “I am
,” Potter repeats, not waiting for an answer before taking off toward the head of the Hall.
There’s a sudden buzz around the Hall as people rise and shake off food-induced drowsiness, led on only by the promise of warm beds and the chance to sleep in. Harry suddenly realizes that he might be expected to escort the Gryffindors, but relaxes when he sees two Gryffindor Prefects—William Ritter and Annabelle Kim, both sixth years—rounding up the first years and showing them the way.
A gasp of recognition from Draco reverberates around a room that is at once so full and so empty that Harry feels a sensation of falling paired with one of being pulverized, boiled down to his most principal constituents.
Draco sighs and looks around, then allows his head to hit the ground again as a groan passed his lips.
Harry frowns. “Possibly. Elaborate?”
Still, it’s doing things to Draco and he’s very much considering turning around again. Instead, he removes his own top and tosses it to the floor, almost defiantly. He’s never loved his body. Tolerated it, sure. Appreciated it even, in moments. But he knows he has a frankness to his frame, his skin pale, his build sharp, angular. Hell, maybe
“You can go, Harry. Like you said, nothing’s going to happen to me here. I’m not going anywhere. I’m safe.”
“Because of his scar?” Ginny finishes sourly.
“It seems that way,” Draco says with a nod. “I’m sorry if it feels like I’m trying to get down on you, but I don’t think you’ve been honest with yourself. It’s only natural to cling to what you know, but what we knew was
“But that’s in the past,” Harry says, and while it
“You alright?” Harry asks as he approaches the desk.
Yay for an update! Not much to say about this one, but I'll have some notes at the end.
“Is everything alright, Harry?”
“According to protocol, we are well within our rights to treat you as hostage. Those measures won’t be taken unless you resist arrest,” the woman explains. It hurts even more that she sounds sympathetic. “If you cooperate, nobody has to get hurt.”
Leon’s strides are matching Harry’s, his body shifting ever so slightly closer. “Something bad?”
“Just the one gay.”
“We were just talking about Quidditch,” Ginny supplies, clearly trying to size him up. “Do you play at all?”
. In fact, I’m indignant. I’m beside myself.”
a possibility. I know it’s already pretty clear, but I really don’t know the full extent of what I had to do to save you. It might mess with both of our magic. It might change absolutely nothing. I think only time will tell. Even Hermione doesn’t have any solid theories.”
Everybody else is a stranger. Some are vaguely familiar, but Harry has also been gone for a year. With the ban on Quidditch (and also joy) from the year prior, the pool of players is suddenly much different than the one he remembers. He has two players from Beauxbatons, his Keeper and one of the Chasers, as well as a rather buff Ravenclaw Beater. He gives Harry a wink, which he raises an eyebrow at but says nothing. There’s also a broody looking blonde girl from Slytherin.
“I just need you to listen, and then potentially offer a response in the form of advice.”
“Ginny?”
“Headmistress,” the man snaps. “This will be much easier if you let us take Malfoy and be on our way. If the charges really are false, that will be proven in a court of law.”
“Of course not, I just like to be thorough,” he mutters, gathering up his things and approaching Harry with the parchment in his outstretched hand. “Thanks,” he says, not meeting Harry’s eye.
Harry wonders if Draco can feel the pit of dread eating away at Harry’s stomach. On the one hand, so much has come into focus. It’s no surprise that their relationship has kindled so quickly, if this emotional connection really is the case. He thinks on Ron’s point, though, and considers his question. It’s certainly true that Harry had been mentally replacing Leon with Draco, which isn’t something he thinks would be a result of the blood magic link. After all, why would Draco be thinking about kissing himself? (Harry smiles to himself; only a year ago, he might have thought that to be not only possible but probable).
He can see that Leon is staring him down. It’s like those beautiful, honey-gold eyes are boring into his skull, trying to get inside his head. Harry tries to ignore the sensation, but it’s really quite distracting. He ultimately refuses eye contact.
“Even if you aren’t interested in becoming an actual Healer, there are plenty of auxiliary professions, people who work behind the scenes. The whole system would crumble without them. People who develop medical potions, new techniques for treatment and prevention of illnesses, things like that.”
“That’s…One smile can’t do all of that. It was just a stupid smile. You’re not making any sense.”
“Wow,” Harry breathes. “That was…” He doesn’t finish his sentence, but he finally opens his eyes. Draco is shocked to find that there are tears gathering in Harry’s dark lashes, glittering droplets perched on the bottom row.
“It’s…Well, it’s Luna,” Harry says. Draco frowns, because there’s something in Harry’s voice that informs him to inquire further.
Leon chooses the seat between Ginny and Harry. Luna sits to Harry’s left, then Ron and Hermione. Leon kicks Harry gently under the table and he feels himself relax, smile, breathe.
“Ugh. Don’t remind me.”
He spots Ron first, waving him over from next to the fireplace. Ron’s acquired a more appropriate set of dress robes thankfully, free of any ruffles and more robe than dress this time around, but still maroon. Hermione is at his side, her arm looped through his. She looks stunning, her hair up in a complicated looking knot and her dress a peachy sort of orange.
“You’re sure? You know you don’t have to hide anything from me.”
“Thank you for being cool about this.”
“Harry, it is so good to see you!” she says; her heavy French accent causes Harry's grin to widen as she kisses both his cheeks.
“You’re not going to kill me, are you?” he jokes.
and some others are lounging around and chatting. He enters, shrugging off the pointed looks that wrap around him, and approaches the group of people in conversation.
“So, for your writing assignment today, I’d like everybody to boil down those happy memories to their most basic components. I’m not asking you to give me personals details about your lives, here. What I want is for all of you to dig even deeper and analyze what about those memories makes you feel happy. What is happiness to you? If you start to think about the emotion on a different level, it will be much easier to bring it to the surface in the rare events that you need to do so.”
“Harry?” they both call after him, but he doesn’t turn, he doesn’t look back at the lake or the forest or the pink and orange sky spreading out above him, warm and inviting. He just keeps running, through the doors and up stairs, as fast as his legs will take him, until his back is against his closed bedroom door, his chest heaving and his nerves on fire.
“Well, I saw how you reacted to it in class.”

Harry chuckles and takes a deep breath, something sentimental shading his eyes. It’s so clear that Draco can almost
“I don’t really know what to say. I mean. I don’t know where to
Harry strides up to McGonagall, trying to keep his panic from boiling over. “What’s going on?”
Harry nods, already wondering what the best method might be. The Ministry must be surveying her closely. Maybe Ron and Hermione will have ideas; Harry is sort of at the end of his intellectual rope.
Harry’s smile fades and he takes a deep breath as he props himself up on his elbow. He cranes his neck and looks over his shoulder. “Oh, good. Hermione’s awake, then?”
Harry cracks his knuckles, tiny pops ringing through the empty corridor. Hogwarts is ghostly, most of the students already packed up and shipped off. “Explain what’s going on, let him know that he’s safe for now, and…leave him there, I suppose? Doesn’t seem wise to pull him out of the one place he may be safe.”
Neville releases an incredulous laugh. “I’ve actually done it!”
forgotten.
Hermione smiles but her eyebrows seem to be asking why he’s so chipper given the circumstances. “Have a good morning?”
“Like…do we tell people? I mean, of course we will eventually. I guess ‘when’ is really the question.”
All of the excited chatter dims to a low murmur as Madam Hooch finds her way to the center of the crowd. Despite not feeling nervous, Harry can’t help but notice a strange twisting in his stomach. Sure, pre-Quidditch nerves weren’t completely foreign to him, but this sudden wave of nausea is confusing and, admittedly, slightly concerning. He tries to ignore it as Madam Hooch addresses the players.
“Why are you doing this, Harry?” she asks, exasperated. “Why does everything have to be so complicated all the damn time?”
He can’t tell if she’s furious or just coming down from the panic, but he figures there’s no point in lying. “I-I made it, professor. In Slughorn’s Potions class on Tuesday.”
“They bloody know who you are,” Ginny says. “He’s a lot cooler on paper, believe me. Ginny Weasley, seventh year, Chaser.”
“Still at the manor? Yes.”
“Well, I suppose even if we do have to do some sharing, we probably won’t have to deal with the likes of Malfoy, eh? It would be pretty bloody stupid to show up at Hogwarts after everything that family did…”
“Mister Zabini, out, now!” McGonagall shouts over the student’s screams. Blaise nods and makes a swift exit, leaving Draco stunned in bed, every nerve buzzing.
ALSO: I have been SO MUCH more active on Tumblr these days, so if you want to
. Draco’s face scowls up from the front page, right underneath a headline that says
“Everything okay?” Leon asks as Harry approaches. Not sure why, Harry grabs Leon’s arm and gently pulls him along, gesturing for Ron and Hermione to follow.
“Lovely to see you, Ronald.”
“But it’s the right one. I committed
“I…don’t know,” Harry says. Draco’s chest tightens. A strange mix of emotions is hitting him from nowhere and he can’t help but feel mortally conflicted, but he has no idea what about.
—was suspicious when he offered to share the captaincy with him. He supposes he can’t blame him for that, given their pasts. But the more he reflects on it, the more Draco is sure that he simply has no ulterior motive. Well, not a malicious one. The offer had been an olive branch, a blueprint for a bridge. A request for a new beginning.
He almost bites down on his tongue, doubles down, but when he sees her face, Harry surrenders. He tells her all about the plan, about how Leon is his boyfriend but he’s not ready for people to know yet, that Ginny and Luna agreed to accompany them so they could still attend the ball.
Draco looks to Harry; his eyes are wide. This could be a moment of truth for the two of them as a pair, at least in the eyes of Draco’s mother.
“Huh. Wild. Does this mean he’ll start spending time with us?”
“Of course I do, you know that, I just—”
“Of course. Thank you so much for your time, Minister.”
He rolls his eyes. There always has to be some sort of drama, doesn’t there?
“Harry,” he says in a warning tone, “what are you doing?”
“Not sure how Blaise would feel about having an owl in the room, so, you know…behave.”
He almost drops the glass when Potter suddenly wakes up, making a noise between a gasp and a snort. Instead of responding, he raises the glass to his lips and drains it, hardly stopping to breathe. His body feels as if it’s been sucked completely dry. Potter’s eyes are on him the whole time, but he relishes in the cool liquid. He can wait.
Draco stands frozen, his chest heaving, nerve endings dipped in ice, numb but buzzing.
Draco chuckles at himself, shaking his head. “No, it’s alright. You remember me?” He’s not sure why he asks it, as he’s fairly certain his reputation proceeds him nearly anywhere he could go these days.
“Hello, Luna! I didn’t see you there.”
He nods, cutting a sausage in half and popping it into his mouth. “I was just thinking,” he murmurs back.
“But from what I can tell, it seems like you do genuinely care about him. Or maybe you
Potter groans and runs a hand through his hair. “Bollocks. I thought we’d made sure all of the leaks were covered.”
As he pushes around bread crumbs on his plate, a plan is already brewing.
McGonagall nods. “All right, that’s perfectly understandable.” She looks around at the students gathered around her, eyes flitting between Luna and Draco. “And the two of you have the same destination, so nobody will have to walk alone. I think that’s best. Let’s plan to reconvene in my office tomorrow after lunch. I’ll make some tea and we can discuss what you all think is best from a student perspective. Please give it some thought in the meantime. Goodnight to all of you.”
Blaise nods, sitting back on his own bed. “I’m really sorry, Draco. If it means anything, I believe you, and I’ll have your back if it comes down to it.”
“Can we just cut the passive-aggressive routine, Pansy? If you knew at all what my summer was like—”
what I needed to hear.”
“What?” he says, his breath all but gone.
“No, and I reckon it won’t ever be,” Harry says with a wry smirk. “But let’s go before either of us lose our nerve.”
Something dark flashes over Harry’s face as he makes a frustrated noise. “What the hell do you mean?” he asks. “After…” Harry takes a step in and Draco fights a shudder when his voice lowers into something close, intimate, and it’s all in his head but Harry’s mouth is so close to his ear. “After we went down there together and saw just the
Harry chuckles. “I’ve survived the last eighteen years of my life, haven’t I?”
“I know, right? Feels like I haven’t eaten in years,” Ron says, his mouth slightly full.
“Just because Kingsley has hope doesn’t mean everything is going to work out like he’s predicted.”
“But he’s the Minister of Magic, Draco. There’s almost nobody who has as much pull as he does.”
“You know, there was a moment when I could’ve sworn somebody else was here,” she says thoughtfully. “Perhaps I should trust my intuition more.”
“That is not even
“Exactly. So I kept quiet and hoped he would die in the wilderness somewhere.”
Harry has been on edge in the days following the attack of David Winslow. While the incident didn’t end in disaster as he heard it would as it was happening, he can’t shake the feeling that something sinister is happening around Hogwarts. He can tell McGonagall is withholding something rather important, and he wishes so badly that she would tell him what’s going on. He wants to help. Hogwarts is the first place he ever felt at home, and if something is wrong… Well, Harry just won’t stand for that.
“First? What about Ginny?”
, and it’s equal parts endearing and infuriating. “Why are you talking like we’re both being tried, here?”
She laughs, eyes still full of sympathy. “I’m Mari, by the way,” she says, holding out a hand. Draco takes it with the hand that isn’t clutching his abdomen. “Mari Mandal.”
when that person is a stranger. I recognize that. But therapy is an ongoing process. It won’t “fix” your life in one session by any means. It’s about understanding the past and using that understanding to guide how you move forward into the future. It takes patience and strength. Things I believe every person can muster, even if it takes some work.”
Leon slinks down the staircase opposite the hall’s entrance, a hand tracing the railing as he descends. There’s a man behind him—who bears an odd resemblance to Lucius Malfoy, Harry thinks: straight, silver hair, tall and slim, but with a beard and a crooked mouth, the right half drooping—with a tight grip on Leon’s shoulder. But Leon doesn’t look scared. He looks…proud.
“What…what happened?” Draco asks gently.
. He never should have asked him for a fucking private lesson. It leaves too much space for interpretation, too many minuscule questions that aren’t worth addressing but will be thought about anyway. Plus, suddenly he’s not sure if he’ll even be able to spend time alone with Harry without melting into a puddle. Or worse, making it obvious that he has
“I really don’t know what came over me,” Harry says honestly. The brief moment of relaxation is gone fully, replaced by a rising anxiety. “That’s not usually my thing.”
Draco frowns. Maybe it’s a trick of the light, but the mark seems less pronounced than before. He chalks it up to the buzz in his head, the lightheaded rush of Harry’s lips brushing tender skin. He chalks it up to wishful thinking. And pulls his sleeve back over his arm.
Draco hasn’t made an attempt to Apparate while awake. Not even just to the next room over when nobody was looking, or back to his own room after waking up here. For years, that rule was one that was so concrete and impossible to break, and now in the course of a week, he’s been involved in five situations that shatter the rule entirely.
!” Harry responds before turning back to Hermione. “I’ll have you know, Ginny and I had a perfectly mature conversation about how we feel about each other over a month ago, and we agreed that there wasn’t really anything there anymore.”
Honestly, he feels rather fit. Knowing there’s a boy just down the staircase waiting for him makes him smile, and he stands in front of the mirror for a moment soaking in the feeling, the glow. And then he feels dumb for smiling at himself like an idiot, so he makes one last valiant attempt at taming his hair, takes a deep breath, and exits the room.
Closer and closer, screams can now be heard over the grating stony chorus. A larger piece of rock falls from the ceiling and Harry blasts it away only inches from Draco’s skull.
real.” He’s shocking himself. Draco has no idea why he feels so affected by that moment. Maybe it had been seeing his own body amongst the many people Harry was so upset to lose. Or maybe it was something else. He can’t put his damn finger on it, but it feels like whatever knife had entered Harry’s gut had struck him just as hard.
“Ron, could you stand up, please?”
Harry looks between his friends. “Something I think you need to know: If we really are planning on giving this a shot—
“I was advising you on two questions,” Blaise says, obviously glad to be back on topic. “You have my answer for the first.”
and previously unheard of, even for someone like her who has been in the profession for many years. I myself never would have thought to have someone consume a burn salve. Most of us have become accustomed to thinking of medicines like that as purely external, but if it weren’t for your skill matched with your decision making, we’d have an even bigger problem on our hands.”
“Right, sure. Oh look, there’s Hermione, there!” He points up into the stands. It seems she’s just arrived and found a seat. She notices and waves, smiling and letting out a whoop of excitement. “She’s been really excited about this for some reason.”
He has a point.
He finally takes a deep breath and raises his fist when the door swings open, the knob colliding with his stomach.
“Of course. Do you have any further questions? If not, I really should be getting back to the Ministry. Lots going on these days, especially with everything that’s gone on at Hogwarts. Which, by the way, your son played a major role in. Putting a stop to it, I mean. Minerva made sure I was aware of that.”
“She seems in a weird mood,” Ron remarks, sliding off his bed.
Harry lifts an eyebrow. “About Draco’s situation?”
“So, what did Ginny say to you earlier?” Ron asks, badly masking the intrigue in his voice.
“Alright. Well, here we are! Er…second class, yeah? Everybody have a good first week?”
The light is momentarily blinding as Harry swings the door open. He notices first that Bella is nearby with Eva, and her head snaps immediately to them.
Harry slides his legs in and drapes the covers over his body. He’s in the bed but there’s still half an inch of space between them, charged like the air between two like magnets. Finally, Harry gives in, closing the distance and pressing his chest against Draco’s back. He reaches an arm over Draco’s waist—thin, bony, like he hasn’t been eating properly, Harry thinks—and drinks in the warmth, cherishes the way Draco’s hand comes to meet Harry’s on his delicate chest, his heartbeat gradually coming down from its hummingbird patter.
, like I’ve already said, my summer was a rather difficult one, and responding to letters was not high on my list of priorities.
So. Leon had made a move. That much is obvious. A very subtle and sweet move, yes, and one that was probably even warranted given the context. But not one that Harry had been expecting. So then why had it felt so…right?
“Ah.” Fair enough. Why would he leave them here?
“I don’t mean it to discount what you’ve done,” she continues. Draco almost falls off the bed when she lays her hand on top of his. “It was incredibly brave regardless, and everything worked out. It’s a start, at any rate. You’re showing people you’ve changed. I guess my point is…he brings out something in you, doesn’t he?”
“I’ve…sort of been thinking about it a lot since it happened.” Harry finally looks up to see Leon’s face is as red as his own feels.
“What the hell do you even need Defense for? Now that
He flips it over and sees his first name, written in unfamiliar handwriting. Given the recent familiar revelation, he’s not quite sure he can trust it. Artemis trills again, hopping closer.
He snaps back to the present. Why is Leon making his way toward the dungeons? Draco’s been down there himself, and even the most basic level of evil that he found with Harry was enough to prevent them from really considering a repeat trip. Yes, Leon is the Head Boy for Beauxbatons (or whatever their equivalent is called, Draco doesn’t really care all that much), but Draco is certain that McGonagall would not have granted him permission to access the dungeons, even with the position.
fit everyone and just stamping it into people’s heads. That’s bullshit, if you ask me.”
After a beat, some of the tension in the room releases. Molly’s shoulders relax, her face softens. “You really care about him.”
“No, Draco. I think you’re incredible, and patient, and caring, and
Suddenly a lot is making sense to Harry, and so many other things are
And the walls are blanketed by mirrors.
“Rules are simple! Everybody will be assigned one team, unless there are uneven numbers, in which case some people will get to play twice. Should you all be so lucky.
Draco nods and stands. “I hope things start to get better for you,” he says, hoping the words don’t seem hollow. He means them. He misses his friend.
“So, about that…There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
Harry nods. “Avoiding getting hurt would be preferable.”
“Fantastic,” Harry says. He turns to Bill to ask what he’s doing at the Burrow, but Bill’s a step ahead of him.
“Bloody
Leon reaches for Harry’s hand. There’s a spark when they make contact—a literal one, static electricity hopping from Leon’s fingertips to Harry’s wrist. The digits close around his arm and guide Harry’s left hand up, forward, until it’s resting gently on Leon’s waist.
Harry reaches over and grabs Draco’s shoulder, giving it a little shake. “Well, get used to it.”
“It does seem that way. Again, your being here is a very good first step. Changing a whole world’s opinion on you is no easy task. You should take it day by day, person by person. And most importantly, please make sure you’re taking care of yourself.” She stands from her perched position on the desk, crossing around to sit behind it. “I won’t lie to you, it will be a taxing process. But if you work at it, really work at it, and keep coming back to me to check in, I think you’ll be much happier when you leave Hogwarts.”
“You’re not worried about this, are you?” Ron says, stepping in close and dropping his voice. “You fly better than every other player at this school, and probably the Beauxbatons lot too. And if you’re worried, then I’m wondering if
“Outside. We’re not doing this here.”
“I’m close personal friends with the Minister,” he says casually, like that’s just another data point. “And you have a small army of respected voices behind you. Dumbledore, McGonagall, Ron and Hermione—”
Leon breaks into a run and Harry’s insides twist. There’s a very large unknown factor sprinting down the corridor, and Harry is the mark.
Draco allows his face to slide into his hands, groaning.
after hearing that
Draco’s blood turns to slide in his veins. Leon’s
She waves him off. “Nothing serious. Don’t worry about us, everybody is unharmed, if a bit shaken. This whole ordeal has been particularly taxing, which is why I want to give everybody time to process before jumping in again.”
that way, too. And what if he doesn’t like what he sees? It’s not rational, Harry is well aware of that, but the thought is still there in the forefront of his mind, gnashing its teeth and making a fuss.
Harry sighs. “Then…I guess the truth would come out, and so would we. But the alternative is we let the world—and my stupid reputation—push us into the shadows until we’re ready to step into the light. And life’s too short for the shadows.”
, Draco thinks, but he has to find a way for Harry to hear him out. “Anything.”
A jolt fires through Harry’s body; he takes in a sharp breath and snaps to attention.
She purses her lips. “No, I suppose not. But I do think I have a pretty good track record when it comes to being right, don’t you?”
Ten minutes before the lesson is scheduled to start, the room is already crawling with students. Draco is unsurprised to see rude looks shot like darts in his direction. The shining Prefect badge on his chest is where all eyes are drawn. People whisper just loud enough for him to hear. They’re confused, they’re angry. They think McGonagall has lost her mind.
“No,” she says, not sounding remotely apologetic. “But if it was supposed to actually hit you, it would have.”
“Hi everyone, I’m Christie Collins! I’m a fourth year and I’m our Keeper! I’m so excited to be part of this team with you. Hufflepuff always had a Keeper, so this is my first opportunity to really play.”
They head back toward the castle, intercepting Bella and Eva as they go.
; Draco has been tailing him for five minutes. Not only has Leon been utterly predictable in his destination, but he’s also failed to notice that someone has been following. Granted, Draco had also been lurking when he discovered Leon was doing the same. But that was more out of morbid curiosity than ill will. The idea of going to Hogsmeade on his own is not exactly an appealing one, and what’s his alternative? Go with Blaise and Pansy, who now seem to be spending all their time together? Or join the Potter crew? That’s not likely to work out in his favor.
“Just—I’m sorry, one more time, and then I’ll be fine. This is
“Where was she?” Harry asks.
“Sorry to bother you. Keep up the good work,” Harry says. He turns on his heel and practically jogs away, returns, shuts the door, and then quick footsteps sound from the hallway as he retreats.
. In class. It didn’t feel complete. I think you saw the snake’s head and panicked—which I totally get—but I’m wondering if there’s more to it than that.”
to happen.
“Excellent, is it breakfast already?” Harry asks.
Blaise’s silence is an indication to Draco that he’s at least seeing things Draco’s way now.
“Shit, I’m sorry,” says a familiar voice, and when Draco regains his footing and turns around, he sees Potter gathering up Draco’s things from the floor.
“This may seem like unfair advice, but it might be best if you lay low for a bit. Let people think through what’s being said and realize how misguided it is.”
There’s also the matter of his increasing proximity to Harry Potter (though he’s not so sure where that’s going anymore). If it really is Leon behind all of this, is there a possibility he’s somehow caught on to Draco’s feelings toward Harry? Draco isn’t even certain
But then he thinks about what might happen if somebody found out. The press would have an absolute field day. People would absolutely think of him differently. Even if it’s not a bad different, it’s a
“No, it’s not that,” Harry says, repositioning his bag on his shoulder. “I just see you as different now. That much is already clear to me, you’re a completely different person. You feel it too, right? Things are just
Harry sighs. “Draco and I…”
mad, but the urgency is enough to give him pause.
given Draco plenty of reason to.
did.”
Harry smiles to himself as Crookshanks finally catches the gnome he’d been chasing. Quiet footsteps approach the room and Harry turns to the door, which slowly swings open.
Ron sits back and crosses his arms. “I never said I was taking him up on it.”
“First of all, my thoughts on the more broad question are to go for it. Everybody else will be attending with a romantic partner, and you shouldn’t feel barred from the event because your choice in romantic partner is not as common.” Blaise pauses. “Hold on, just to clarify, it’s not
“That’s not the point. I just want to see why you’ve chosen him over me, that’s all.”
Draco twirls around and starts to pull on clothes, whatever is laying around. He doesn’t usually leave things strewn about, but the last few days have been taxing and tidying up has been low priority. Two different socks—one brown, one black—a pair of jeans, a gray sweater that’s fraying at the end of the right sleeve. He tries to drag a brush through his hair but it’s too tangled (probably the result of tossing and turning), so he gives up and makes for the door.
“Killed me for good?” So Potter really
“The best idea you’ve had all day.”
“Quite all right,” Kingsley says.
“So, I have this friend,” he starts, already feeling how flimsy the words are coming out of his mouth, “and they’re sort of…into Harry.” He pauses, trying to read Hermione’s face, but she’s frustratingly blank. Draco continues. “And you know there’s this Autumn Ball coming up—”
Draco stands his ground, his brain telling him to run. He knows it’s not an option, but it feels tempting.
count everything we’ve been through, most of it applies almost exclusively to Defense Against the Dark Arts or Charms. What about Transfiguration? Potions? Herbology?”
"Draco please. I'm trying to get cleaned and start the day" he whined, gasping when the other grinded into him.
"Ah well you see I'm trying to correct the bisexual Weasleys tastes. What better than someone who would compliment his own. He's hot tempered. You're calm. You cook. He eats just about anything. "
"M-morning Mrs. Malfoy. "
"Yes really! If you're going to act like this you can bugger off!" Ron snapped.
"Slytherins?" Harry pondered.
"Dibs on being godfather of your first born." Harry grinned as Ron messed his untamed hair more.
".....I...I will think about it."
“I honestly wasn't going to sign anymore and wait for them to fire me for losing yet another partner when Weasley walked up with the paper. What did you say that day?”
"She knows I talk with and work with Malfoy. Yet she gets so mad when I spend lunch with him. Like come on were not third years anymore. Its stupid. Malfoy and I are ...what are we? Work partners or friends?"
"I'm fine…...No one has seen Eliza. We tried tracking her we're led to the ocean. Father and uncle think she joined the saltwater dragons in the sea. I only hope she's okay…." There was a soft knock at the door Dean opened before gasping. He moved to let her in.
"Hello Mr Malfoy."
"Trust me. It's in the house. Then again I'll throw in another if you convince this one to stick around." Harry and Ron looked confused as the two smirked.
"You have a wife Ron. Ask her. Until I have grandbabies from you I don't want to hear about it!" He made a mocking tone of his mother, making Draco snort and Harry laugh.
"Break up with her! I know she's my sister but damn it Harry you are just important. This is disgraceful, that's she's lying to you and cheating."
" Where are you all heading? I have time before I have to go back to my shop."
"Hopefully to find out if she stays in touch with her family." Dean sighed. “I sent the letter. I was surprised when my owl came back with seaweed charmed with the words. ‘I will be coming with a company of two.’ It was in a dragon so I called Charlie for a favor. Who knew Dragons could write?”
"Open it!" Harry looked excitedly at the box. Once opened Ron picks up a redwood wand it had an iridescent handle.
“Yes. Vicent died in that fire. I didn't realize he and Eliza had ...done that.”
"Well I ran my mind through a few ...Blaise being one. Flint said as soon as he's off work he wouldn't mind stopping by to save me from Gryffindors. " The group laughed as Harry stared at him in pure shock.
"No...well ...kinda...I try not to take it from the Potter vault unless I need to. Which is often. I know I'm rich. But being at home seems worse than having a job. It's not even home anymore."
"Archie?" Draco looked shocked he had been listening to Ron talk about his sister and how mad he was at her.
Lucius was the first to greet them.
"W-we have too much clothes " he whined yanking at Draco's clothes. Draco helped Harry strip him before finishing Harry's clothes. The two fought for dominance again as they hit the bed. Draco won again pinning the other under him. He made quick work of lubing spells and protection spells before slipping a finger in Harry's ass. Harry arched his back moaning.
Thaisius knocked rapidly on the door.
"Morning." Narcissa smiled nodding to the boys.
Harry paused, sighing as all anger left him. "Thank you Ron…. What am I going to do?" Harry slumped into a chair defeat on his face.
Eliza flinched but sighed. "I trespassed onto his land. Nothing exciting "
"...he was my God father and teacher! An uncle!. He was a brother that my father never had Potter! And that damn war. YOUR DAMN WAR-" Draco's wand was in Harry's face before he could say anything.
"Fuck a guy. Pick any man and fuck him. A, you'll either regret it or B, fall in love with someone else." Lucius stated Draco blushed thinking about him and Harry.
"Fuck me." Harry's face was on fire. He was on cloud nine and drunk.
"Honey, you heard him. He hates his own home. Let's give him a place with people in it. He can say ``no."
“He was using older spells, ones I didn't even know existed but Draco did. I couldn't ask for a better Partner on that one….of course that was the first one we worked on there was a lot of fighting about who was right and what not.”
Daimon walked in holding a small boy to him. He didn’t look like he wanted to be there.
"Consent?" he asked Harry nodded, kissing him. The two started slowly, Draco's hand slipped under the other's shirt. Harry gasped, allowing Draco to slip his tongue in the other's mouth. Harry moaned, arching his back. The two started to fight for dominance with Draco coming out on top. Harry allowed his shirt to be pulled off moaning.
“It won’t kill you Potter.” Draco snorted as the other straightened up.
"Let's go Potter. Weasley hasn't shut up about eating with you. " Ron gave him a look that Harry couldn't tell what.
“When are you going to get custody of him?” Ron muttered
"I'm sorry to hear that" Harry sat down, and Narcissa waved her hand and food floated onto his plate.
"Morning madam Tai. "Draco called out.
"I can say you have other plans?" Ron stated.
"M-move please!" Harry cried out as Draco started a quick pace snapping his hip.
"Deal" the two picked up where they left off. Draco's hand snaked its way into Harry's pants making the other moan. The hand jerked him off in quick and rough but not enough to hurt. Harry moaned, bucking his hip.
"Lily Evans...there was a girl who cared not for your house. But your heart. Best half blood ever." Lucius chuckled Draco and Harry looked shocked.
"Molly asked me to sleep at the Weasleys tonight and to make up with Ginny even though we're not fighting.I don't know what to do."
“How is Zabini’s cake shop going?”
"...come on let's eat up, we can jump over to Oliver's wand shop. Or Tai's...I think tai's would be a better option. She's less likely to judge you. And hers are more durable. Harry smiled as they finished lunch, leaving Ron to look at his wife who just glared at him.
"Oh wow. " Blaise eyed the beautiful wand.
"My mother hasn't started dinner, Weasley. Let's go. "
“ Good. he’s got a place to start up in Hogsmeade. You're a fan of sweets, we can stop by there some time.” Draco chuckled before taking his godson back in his arms as Archie tells how she met Thaisius.
“Ridiculous amounts” Draco rolled his eyes.
"No…. wait, I do have food this time."
"Say it." Draco said a little more than demanding.
The next day, Ron and Harry met Seamus for a drink and showed him their memory. The poor man was crying.
"Ah, thank you. Your wife tends to come in and pick whatever she pleases. But I remember your favorite from our school days and would sneak one or two in. As long as I don't charge her she doesn't say anything. Maybe one-day she will remember to get them for you."
"Come on then Harry. "
Draco nipped at the other's neck, sucking gently.
"You'll die if you keep up this habit. You're thin enough anny thinner and I could break you like a toothpick."
"Nope, not getting out of it. Let's go Potter. " They apprated Draco forcing
“I would lose my job if I asked, '' Malfoy spat, not really angry. “Weasley may get into Fights but hes not completly stupid. We have broken several cases. Why should I risk a change in partners or losing my job when the one i have is enough.” Draco looks bored with the conversation as he shoves Ron’s arm. The red head noticed it wasn't as hard as it could be.
"Hello Archie." Eliza hugged her cousin before hugging Draco. "Draco. I would like you to meet someone. Come in please ..Archie meet your second cousin Vincent the second. His stepfather Daimon.
"Yes?"
"Fir-wood mixed with unicorn hair. Nice." The rest of the day went quickly for them Ron and Draco even cracked a hole in their case. And was so excited to tell Harry about it. When they got to Harry they could tell he was upset.
"Alright!" He said after Draco snatched his quill from his hand. "Pushy."
"Last warning Finnegan!" Seamus yanked the door open moving out of the way.
"DRACO!!" Archie squealed, running up to her friend and hugging the two hug. He still towered over her picking her up; he swingged her around in a twirl, smiling.
“Malfoy ...isn't that bad.”Ron shrugs. “You work with one person long enough you learn things about them and yourself.”
"I'm not that bad."
"Father!" Harry covered his smile. "Both of them want me to stay in Draco. But I won't intrude if you want me gone."
"That was a little harsh Ron." Harry patted Ron's shoulder.
"Malfoy~"
“Do you really wanna start a fight now? It's a /nice/ party”
"How are you?! How is Eliza." Archie's face fell on her cousin's name.
"So who 's coming?" Ron cleared his throat.
"Any godfather's??!" Draco snapped half expecting to be said godfather.
"Don't."Draco snapped, tapping the throwaway bowl with his fingers. He warmed it up slowly with each finger. "Their last thing you need is to be starving and wearing your food. Honestly I told you to get a new one."
xX2 weeks laterXx
"I-I...please. Draco…"
"Harry. Why not tell us what you're doing now that you're out of school for a few years?"
"Fair." She smiled softly.
"Welcome ChirCreek. I see you brought a friend"
Harry Didn't see it, he did however think about slamming a few drinks then into Draco of all men. A few more drinks Lucius pulled the drunk men to his house shoving them in Draco's room "good night son. Goodnight Harry."
"The first time I met her I called Severus a poor s.o.b. for liking a Gryffindor but I knew from his letters he liked her before Hogwarts. She liked him but didn't know how to tell him ...in fourth year she stood up against James in my stead. I was rather shocked, no one defended Slytherins. Yet she was constantly protecting us or trying to befriend us...she made Bellatrix laugh. Genuine laughter! Not that fake manic laugh she had later in life. She and that Remus boy were alright….when I found out he was a werewolf. And what James and the others had been doing I didn't see them as complete jerks. They had a friend in dire need and met his needs. James Potter was in love with the same girl as Severus...Lily didn't know who to choose and when James started to really bully Severus she said she would date him if he stopped. She used herself...as a means to help Severus who did the worst thing ever...he called her a mudblood. Though he knew the truth about her. She still hung out with us. But they seemed to love each other at farther distances. He would avoid her. She would cry in my arms. In fifth year she was caught sneaking into our common room by an older Gryffindor. She lost a lot of house points and was considered a traitor. James started blackmailing her with the whole sev thing to keep her in check but we still met up with red scales. She could animagus into a red corn snake." Lucius finished his drink and ordered another.
" Tai's wand shop. Ron needs a new wand again. Harry stated as Ron took the cake out of the air.
“Like why your wife was a horrible choice.” Draco didn't seem fazed when the other glared at him.
“Or did you tell her I was going to be here?”
"Because some humans will call us uncivil swine for it." He knocked again.
"Divorce her. I know better suitable wife's or husband’s. " Draco wasn't letting up on this. Harry glared at him.
“So Potter. What have you been up to.”
LH ch 3: Family issues
"There's probably a pile waiting at my house. I have been fine. Oh here." He picked up the bag with an R on it and handed it over.
"Father...where's the house bill."
"Getting to know them. And working harder cause someone spoke harsher and tricked me into wanting to better myself. "
"Give her a swish." Ron used the levitation spell on an apple nearby, setting it back down.
"Fine!" Harry couldn't take the teasing anymore. "D-draco please" Draco didn't have to be told twice he was pretty sure if his parents weren't awake Harry woke them up. Once the fun was over and they were dressed, Harry let Draco lead him down to the dinning room where Narcissa and Lucius were sitting drinking morning coffee.
“Is that why you two are never in the office? You're always out of a case somewhere?” Dean asked.
"Yes."
"That's not my Dean I know my Dean he's gotta be under…..something" Seamus seems to go into deep thought "…..the chocolates!!" Seamus jumped up, knocking his chair back. " I have to go home and throw them out. They were a gift to him from her. I thought it was odd but now I understand" he grinned, throwing on his cloak. " thank you both, this means a lot!" Seamus hugged them both before running out.
LH Ch 2: Starting of something new
“Why are you here potter?” Draco turned to Harry, at first Harry didn't want to answer.
"Don't!!! Um ...look ...I ...there's something I want to show you." Ron led him out to the garden where he had seen Ginny go in hours ago. Harry froze when he saw them. Ron grabbed him, yanking him back inside before he could do anything.
“Oi Malfoy I found another old spell castor buried in the pile. Sign it and let's get going.”
"Oh uh...have a…..I'm in the ministry. I sit at a desk reading the Auror reports. The minister didn't want me in the paper so I was asked not to talk about it too much. God I didn't think I miss being on the run. Or school for that matter."
“It is a nice party. But seriously where is your wife?”
"Draco enough! It's not Potter's fault he was a baby when it all started!....care for a drink Potter you look like shit." Lucius yanked the younger Malfoy's wrist down.
"Potter. Have you eaten?" Draco and Ron appeared.
"Do what you wish, we just ask as a resident here you make an appearance." Narcissa smiled checking the time.
"A month at best. I wasn't sure what I was seeing at first ...then I didn't want to believe it ...I told George and he told me if I cared enough for you as my best friend. I would let you know ...I have been trying to find an appropriate time to ...as you can see it's not easy." Ron snapped but quickly winced he was not angry with Harry he was angry with Ginny.
"D-don't stop!!" Harry begged as he moaned Draco's name. Draco yanked him by his hair into a kiss. The two became more disparate as they reached closer and closer to their climate.
"Easy Draco." Draco smirks.
"Dibs holding him first" Draco said softly, eyeing.
"Harry~"
“So I was on the mountain side preparing to check the whole damn thing for Eliza! Because we hadn't seen her in forever when I caught a glimpse of a dragon. Curious went up and ended up fighting said dragon turning into one myself. I of course won the battle and he turned human and started helping me look for her. We stayed up there for half a year with me sending letters back to my father. Then there's a clue given to them through my Grandmother. Kelp. we think okay she's near a lake or ocean.... How did you two meet?"
"Duh. Anyway come on Malfoy we need to work on the hollow case. " Ron hugged Harry one last time before turning to leave; he missed Draco leaning into Harry.
I smile sorrowfully, and many nights spent at a pub drinking I never thought I would see him in this place. But there he was. His blonde platinum hair stuck out like a red grape in a bag of green grapes. I started seeing him every night. Sometimes with his father.
"And the third?" Draco watched as she set it by Harry.
"My mother. I ranted about how you ate half my meal last time Weasley" Draco sneered but had an amusing look in his eyes. Ron blushed mumbling
"Mother" Draco warned.
"S-strawberry?! The fuck kind of nickname is that!" Ron glared at him before facepalming. "Okay maybe a little."
"Ron needs a new wand." Harry stated as Ron stepped up a box flew at him in such rage he caught it before it could hit his chest. The red and gold box seems to be almost in demand.
"No…" Draco pulled off, Harry was looking confused at the man. "If ...if we're doing this it better be Draco I hear." Harry took a minute nodding
"No fair, I'm the second cousin!"
"Boyfriend actually. Easy Thaisius. Thanks for inviting us."
“We were dating. It was a secret because I was worried that I wasn't going to make it. Only for him ...”tears started to peek at the corner of her eyes. Daimon put his hand on her shoulder, his eyes cold but the hand was warm, she moved closer to him.  Draco took note of the tension between the two. ‘A fight or is this normal?’ he thought he didn't have much time to think about it as Ron started cooing at the baby. Harry nervously smiled at it.
"Pffft. As if. She literally is trying to punish him now."
"How long have you known? Why did you keep it a secret?!" Harry's face was turning red with anger
"Yes and it helps most of the time. But there are times when a wand is more useful. " Draco used this to shrink the cake box carefully, putting it in his carrier bag.
"I'm going to take that as a compliment to Malfoy. "
"Tell her thanks for me. My mom refuses to cook for me and Hermione doesn't have time ...I don't know how."
"Harry…" Harry turned his head to where Draco was laying looking at him. One arm stretched as if trying to get Harry to come back to bed. Harry smiled walking back over.
"I don't live there most days. Only there if she is. Otherwise I'm couch hopping. Silence seems to be my biggest enemy in a normal house…. I grew up with other people there. So to be in a house that has no one but myself.....I thought of getting another owl…" tears entered his eyes remembering Hedwig.
