“Fuck off, you’re well enough to overdramatically flop around on the bed like a fish out of water.” Harry was slightly concerned about injuring Draco, but was quite sure he’d done his job well with the bruise salve.
Well, he probably shouldn’t regard them as kids - some of them were only a couple of months younger than him - but really, the way they’d giggled as they’d walked up, he couldn’t see them as anything else.
He snorted softly, pacing in his room. The ambition of a young boy. He’d take Britain, and Ireland, and then expand to the rest of the world. There were millions of muggles here; and muggle minds were weak. Easily manipulated. It would be easy to get them to fight for him.
one — stepped out. Tonks tried to change back into the random man before Umbridge saw her, but Umbridge, apparently, had perfect eyesight, and was making a beeline for her.
“Yes, well, we all know Potter is immune to death.” Snape rolled his eyes. “And the blood potion will keep him alive, as we have established. Perhaps the most important thing would be to check who’s magic is compatible with his; if one of you is also compatible, then we could keep one person with Potter at all times to speed up his recovery.”
He watched the name on the Map, making towards the door as it didn’t move, but then it did. Harry felt a flood of relief as the feet beneath the name started stiffly walking - towards the common room. Harry cleared the map and started pacing again - who knows what state Draco would be in, and Harry couldn’t be a mess when he arrived.
“Dumbledore died three weeks before the Hogwarts term ended on a mission with Harry Potter. Harry made it out, barely, and isn’t well enough to see people. This is the whole truth. It is devastating, and a huge disadvantage to our cause, but we can’t let it affect us, because there are people out there who need our help.”
Draco jumped in shock. Rather than the bathroom being empty, Harry was standing there, shirtless. Draco realised he hadn’t seen Harry shirtless before this point, and now saw why. Harry was standing with his back to Draco, and his back…
“Does that mean you’ll be at dinner then?” Granger had leaned around the back of the Weasel to look at Harry.
He hadn’t realised that he’d been shackled under the expectations of everyone else until he and Draco had started this...friendship. There wasn’t really any proper name for it - they comforted each other (or Draco comforted Harry, although Harry is perfectly willing to return the favour), Draco brought food which they ate together (in companionable silence - a world away from the lively Gryffindor table, and not unpleasant) and Harry had rubbed bruise salve on Draco. Which was not a ‘friend’ thing to do, but…
Another discussion decided on the seven people to impersonate; they’d have to be high–ranking enough to not get questioned, but not
They continued along those lines for the rest of the lesson, occasionally bickering out loud or waving their wands to hide the bond.
Hermione felt warm tears sliding down her face at the statement, and blinked hard. She had to try to stay strong. She couldn’t let Molly do this.
“Yeah, well, some pure blood families aren’t so accepting - what with their obsessions of ‘continuing the bloodline’ - but overall everyone is alright with it.”
“My Lord, I believe that they are currently at Hogwarts — I believe my son had a way for us to get in, if only we didn’t have to deal with Dumbledore.”
. He may be affected worse than most, but almost everyone went through something bad during the war.
“Today, we will be brewing Felix Felicis. You may remember what it looked like, although sixth year may seem like a lifetime ago to some - it is supposed to be similar in colour and texture to molten gold at the end. It normally needs to be left for six months to mature, but I can grade whatever you make today and vanish it - it is a very advanced potion, and it is unlikely that any of you will make it correctly. It is your methods that count. You have two hours - begin!”
Draco got a few odd stares as he walked into the Hall, but just went to his regular spot. Thanks to Harry’s testament at his trial, he didn’t really have to keep his head down, but still preferred to stay out of the spotlight, unlike his younger self. To his dismay, however, he noticed many stares and odd looks being sent towards him for the course of the meal. He felt the constant prickling sensation on the back of his neck that came with being watched, and rubbed it constantly, frequently looking up for whatever threat his body was telling him to watch for.
I have a few notes about the AU that I wanted to tell you guys, but couldn’t quite shoehorn into the epilogue:
Hermione nodded. “Yep, exactly. Kreacher, could you tell us what happened afterwards?” She added gently.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that the ties had been removed and he was on the floor. Not really wanting to deal with the pain, but needing to know what Bellatrix was saying, Harry pulled back into his body, gritting his teeth at the wave of pain that crashed over him. Bellatrix had really gone nuts.
He couldn’t bring himself to move — until his shivering slowed, and then stopped, as heat washed over him. Who would cast a warming charm on him? The heat was steadily becoming unbearable, and Draco opened his eyes, seeing smoke above. Of course Lucius had set fire to the bloody house.
Draco rolled his eyes. At least it was Slytherin colours. And he could say the H stood for ‘Hogwarts’, or something.
“Will someone tell me what’s going on?” Malfoy said, and Ron might have echoes the sentiment had it not been said by
“I refuse to call someone by their first name when their tie isn’t even tied.” Draco wrinkled his nose at Harry’s collar, where his tie was slung loosely around his neck.
Harry smiled softly, gently untangling his arm from Draco’s and smoothing the hair away from his face. Harry stared up into Draco’s eyes, watching as they softened from steel into quicksilver. One of his hands rose to cup Harry’s jaw, gently brushing his cheek as if to try and remove the water.
They’d been surprised when a few seventh–year Slytherins had been led in by the Carrows, and even more surprised when, after a disgusted glance over her shoulder at Amycus, Pansy Parkinson had whispered “scream” before shouting
Harry’s eyes were lit up, and despite not eating for three days he was still looking better than he had until about a week ago. “Yep. I’m not even mad at you for telling her.”
, Draco thought, hurrying to his dorm room. The quicker he got there, the quicker he could put on one of his own silk shirts.
Harry slowly chewed on the sausage that was in his mouth, audibly swallowing before saying “do we though?”
A huge grin plastered on his face, Draco practically skipped to the Slytherin table, almost knocking Pansy off her seat with his newfound energy.
Draco’s name was a prayer on Harry’s lips as he lowered himself, pressed his forehead against Draco’s.
His question was soon answered as he spent ten minutes rattling around the kitchen in search of flour. He’d found eggs in the fridge, which had surprised him, and knew that sugar was in a large pot next to the coffee, but where on
Not for the first time that day, Severus traced his dark mark over his robes. This afternoon, that skin would be unblemished.
“I have people to defend, Conan.” Remus sighed and turned, looking into the eyes of his friend. It had once unnerved him, the fact that one was brown and the other grey, but Remus had grown used to it. “And I think we both know I don’t belong here.”
march off to Hogwarts to see what was going on — he pointed out that she’d probably been forced to destroy the notebook, since the Carrows were trying their best to get into the Room. The last entry had been November 21st, when Ginny said that someone’s cat had gone missing, so she was going out with a large group of seventh years to find it. They’d figured that the six of them would be able to hold their own against the Carrows and Umbridge, but she hadn’t replied since.
There was a beat of silence as Severus processed that Remus had asked him a question. He was tracing the veins under his skin. Somewhere, deep down, he’d thought that it wouldn’t work, because he’d had it for so long, and yet here he was — with a perfectly clear wrist, matching with his right.
“He was quite talented at potions in Hogwarts — he could easily help me with several potions, freeing me up for other tasks, or making new potions.” Severus carefully kept his voice bored, indifferent — one slip up and Draco would be killed.
Anyway, Draco didn’t want Potter noticing, because despite his lack of observational skills, he wasn’t
Draco laughed, a fond look on his face, and half–carried Harry to bed, gently tucking Harry in. Harry knew he was blushing, but he couldn’t bring himself to complain; not when Draco was looking at him like
There was a brief pause, before Draco apparently came to a decision. “I have an apartment in muggle London. My parents live in France - I might go visit them but you can come to the apartment with me if you want?” Harry felt him stiffen as he made the offer, but Harry grinned with delight.
“You sure of that?” Harry closed his eyes again, and pulled on his magic, holding his hands perpendicular to his body, palms facing upwards. The Elder wand was already in his right hand, and the resurrection stone appeared in his left, the cloak appearing around his shoulders and flowing back in an invisible breeze.
“Okay, so I didn’t get much because I kind of had to run away when he found me, but one was with Bellatrix — probably not still
“Well, we could start with those, since we definitely know what’s in them — diagnosis charms would probably be the first thing, since we need to know what to focus on.”
Harry knew it was unrealistic to expect this to go without a hitch, but he’d gotten as far as the fifth floor without being detected and dared to
Hermione shook her head and muttered something under her breath that made Draco chuckle, before rummaging in a little bag — clearly with an extension charm on it — for a little while. After about ten seconds, she gave up and just said “
Harry could have sworn he saw a flicker of blonde hair, out of the corner of his eye, and a flicker of hope lit in his chest. He turned his head - maybe they were just out of his line of vision, maybe if Vernon saw them he would stop.
“Fucking mother hen,” Potter grumbled, before taking the bread Draco held out, slathered on some butter and dunked it in the soup. “Why are oo’ ‘oin’ ‘is any’ay?”
“Wait,” Hermione said. “If Ron gives you a piece of paper with the address for Grimmauld, you’ll all be able to stay here. The house is huge, and Kreacher has been really good lately — he’d be able to sort out a few rooms for everyone.”
He checked the egg - he couldn’t even tell it was supposed to be an egg, it was just grey powder. It looked more like ash. He didn’t want to ask Draco, but he also didn’t want to be hexed, so he said “this must be good enough.”
“Voldemort comes first. We are going to Malfoy Manor, and we are going to kill that bastard.” Harry was surprised at how authoritative his voice was, but at least everyone listened to him.
He took in the market around him — there was still the butcher’s shop and the florist’s cart, the small corner shop with sweet jars displayed in the windows. After a moment, he dug out some coins from his pocket and picked out a small bouquet of lilies.
He held the wards a moment longer than he had to, just to make sure, before finally dropping his arms. He was panting with exertion, and a light sweat had broken across his forehead.
Severus nodded thoughtfully. “That’s something to consider. Anyway, around a week after Regulus voiced these second thoughts, he ended up dead. I hadn’t thought anything of it — perhaps he said something to the wrong person. Certainly I mourned, but I thought it was an ordinary death. Apparently I was wrong.”
His mark began to burn, and then freeze, as Severus coaxed out small tendrils of dark magic and amplified them, before threading them into the wards. He began to feel the strain of the wards on his magic, but he gritted his teeth and continued to give — once this was finished, he could rest. And get this bloody mark off.
“He took Kreacher on a boat, and made — made Kreacher drink the potion from a basin, on a tiny island. Kreacher drank it, because Kreacher obeyed his Master and Master told him to obey the Dark Lord. Kreacher drank, and drank…Kreacher’s insides burned…Kreacher cried for his Mistress Black to save him, for Master Regulus to save him, and the Dark Lord l–
Despite this, Remus’ heart ached at the lack of faces, both new and old, present at the meeting. They would try to recruit new people — muggleborns especially, if they were capable of fighting — but the fact that the full extent of their forces fit in the kitchen of the Burrow was still very disheartening.
The four Slytherins headed to a table near to Potter, but didn’t allow Draco to get a chair facing the rabble’s table - a good idea, since this meant Draco had to actually be part of the conversation. Pansy arrived last, levitating four butterbeers - she always got the quickest service, although she refused to let anyone come with her, as she refused to reveal the ‘family secret’ (Draco was of the opinion that Madame Rosmerta wasn’t as straight as she had everyone believe, and the family secret was ample cleavage under a low-cut top).
Draco’s hand tightened on Harry’s leg. Harry had no recollection of it being placed there in the first place, but wasn’t complaining. “I think what Ron
Wandering further, he saw some clothes similar to what Potter wore. They were probably muggle - it was common knowledge that Potter had grown up with a muggle family. He eyed up the pull over shirts, and the pullover...jumpers? They had an odd, large pocket towards the bottom and elastic around the arm holes and the body hole, and a hood with laces threaded through. It was quite odd, and Draco wondered what the muggle world had against buttons.
It was the first time he’d seen his mind - it was a dark, gloomy place, surrounded by trees. It just made it easier to see the bond - a brightly glowing thread, leading out into the open. By instinct, he’d shouted down the bond, laughing at the indignant tone in Draco’s voice as he’d said “Not so loud.”
“Fucking hell-“ Harry started, ready to continue muttering a string of obscene words, but the sight before him left him speechless.. His robes, shirt, jumper and tie had disappeared, courtesy of the potion, and he was left standing in only his trousers and shoes, glaring at Harry. Harry was somewhere between his jaw hitting the floor, because Draco was
,” Harry protested as they approached the bathroom door. “I hadn’t used them in six weeks, they were a bit dead, but they’re alright now.”
) although he kept his eyes trained on the argument as if listening for the most part - they’d flicked to Draco’s for a moment, not long enough for Draco to read what was in them - and hopefully not long enough for Harry to see what must have been clearly written in his.
.” Draco could hear the look of disgust that was under the mask. “You’re no better than a blood–traitor.
They all jostled one another in, with the couples next to each other and Harry on the end with the best view of the bar.
“‘E’s go’ a poin’. Loo’ a’ all ‘is foo’!” Ron said, mouth already full of roast beef and potatoes. Harry loaded his plate with small amounts of everything, extra bread and a few little packets of butter. Why the elves served butter in little packets Harry didn’t know, but he wasn’t complaining now.
...well, Ab is as good as, with his goats...at least two of those horrid things are gone...shame Harry’s one though…”
He opened his eyes wider, accustomed to a bit of light filtering through the drapes, reaching out an arm towards his wand, when his hand hit a wall far sooner than it should have.
After scanning the ground in front of him a few times his eyes came to rest on the Whomping Willow. He hadn’t been there since the Battle - he shuddered at the thought of the red eyes, Nagini striking Snape in the shack. He briefly closed his eyes - no need to focus on that memory. He thought back to third year - meeting Sirius for the first time, the brief elation at the idea of living with him. Grimmauld place, no matter how dusty, would have been paradise compared to the Dursley’s. Harry sat back and closed his eyes, imagining what life at Grimmauld place would be like. Waking up, spending the days racing Sirius on his broom, Sirius helping him with his homework…
Ron, who’d been growing steadily redder since the blond had walked into the room, snarled, “Well we have better things to do than clean, Malfoy. Aren’t you supposed to be with Harry right now anyway? What with your
Draco nodded stiffly at Potter, only just remembering the etiquette that his mother had drilled in to him. Potter nodded back, raising a single eyebrow, before shoving his hands in his pockets and walking off.
“You should write that down for an Order meeting,” Ron said, waving his fork at Severus, before helping himself to some roast potatoes. “Remus is always looking for inspirational shit like that.”
again as it flowed through his veins, lighting his core and causing electricity to crackle through his hair.
Remus nodded once, before standing, the scrape of the chair on tiles effectively shutting everyone up. Sweating under the weight of their stares, Remus began to speak.
The younger of the two — Draco estimated maybe four years old, now that he had a better view — screamed and collapsed to her knees, desperately shaking her father, who was staring at the wall with wide, glassy eyes. Draco could feel himself trembling, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes — nobody should have to see their parents die. He tried to still himself, allowing the tears to track paths unseen behind the cold, metal mask.
They quickly found Tonks’ body; now that she wasn’t using her powers, she was in her natural shape — same colouring as her dad, with dainty, aristocratic features like her mother.
After taking account of his surroundings, he’d realised that he must have been feeling this through the bond. The pain was mediocre for Harry at worst, but it was clearly an echo of what Draco was feeling, and getting worse - Draco definitely had some broken bones.
. With Umbridge in charge, who had said all detentions were to be had with the Carrows, and was constantly assigning them for no reason, there was almost no way to avoid them. Quidditch was cancelled, Hogsmeade trips were cancelled, nobody was learning anything related to the syllabus, as the teachers often spent their time trying to console their students, or teaching them ways to avoid the Carrows and who to go to, and most people skipped at least one meal a day. Everyone had agreed that this was
They’d asked Harry if he was comfortable with them telling Draco and Severus about him being a horcrux, since they really needed some new information, and Harry agreed. Draco had shot concerned glances at Harry throughout the conversation, but had regrettably no new information to offer. Severus, as a potions master, knew a lot about the potion, but had no new information other than what he’d told them that first day. He did go slightly more in-depth with the theory, though, causing Ron’s eyes to quickly glaze over — even if he trusted Snape, he didn’t enjoy potions in the slightest, and would much rather stick to baking — but Hermione frowned at the implications. Since it was old magic, it was void of loopholes; at some point in the fourteenth century, an Italian wizard had brought new magic based on Latin rather than the original Germanic languages that the English lower classes usually used, and everyone had taken them as they came, wanting to be like the french royalty. No one had noticed the loopholes in the more complex spells and potions until the spells were well integrated into society, so they stuck, and the solid, older magic was forgotten.
Before being given the chance to answer, Draco found himself being dragged by an iron grip around his arm. A door to a small, brick house with peeling, red paint was blasted off its hinges. Draco was dragged inside, but not before he was given a chance to note the neat garden, without a weed in sight, clearly looked after by a family that didn’t have much to their name. A soft smile appeared on Draco’s face, unseen by anyone else, at the late-blooming narcissus flowers — more commonly known as daffodils — blooming in long, narrow beds.
- to any other idiots who are reading this, and/or have left kudos, I don’t know why you’re still reading but I love you all as well.
As if they were of one mind, all three of their heads turned to the corridor that led to the dragon.
“Guys.” He started rapidly patting Ron on the arm, who was shamelessly sleeping with his head on the desk. “Guys. I think I’ve found it.”
Tonks shook her head as Fred — probably, Remus had issues telling them apart, like everyone else — started to speak.
After about twenty minutes Harry felt well enough to emerge from his cocoon. He cast a tempus in the darkness, revealing it was 4:30 in the morning. Assuming nobody else would be awake, Harry crept out. Malfoy hadn’t closed his drapes or the curtains, and a shaft of moonlight illuminated his pale face. His hair fanned out on the pillow - it was longer than Harry remembered, not long enough to tie back but getting there - and his mouth was slightly open, a puddle of drool underneath. His arms were skinny, one tucked under his pillow and one on top, and one leg was sticking out from underneath the covers. Staring at his once-hated nemesis, Harry was surprised to feel nothing towards the sleeping boy. Likely because he looked so vulnerable and…
she shouldn’t have gone alone,” Bill whispered as he knelt beside Tonks. “It was supposed to be an easy stealth mission — we were supposed to just be in and out, no confrontation, nothing like this was supposed to happen—”
him. Perhaps seeing Harry wouldn’t bring up any good reactions — Harry knew all about PTSD, at this point — and since Harry didn’t have to stay close to Draco anymore, perhaps he wanted to stay in separate rooms. He probably didn’t return Harry’s feelings, anyway. Maybe one–sided true love was enough to break the effects of the potion.
Everyone nodded and murmured “yes” before departing. As everyone except Severus, Remus collapsed in his chair.
Thanks to Narcissa’s connection to the wards on the Manor, she knew Voldemort was the only living person in there, but the wards couldn’t detect any inferi; in any case, they were nothing a bit of fire couldn’t handle.
Tears leaked out of Harry’s eyes, and Draco’s heart broke - there was no pain coming through the bond, likely because this was a dream, but the pure hopelessness that Harry was feeling was bad enough. He hadn’t reached towards Draco once - and didn’t react when Draco talked down the bond. It was likely blocked for him.
I think this fic is going to be...very long. Just started chapter 9 (I’m still sticking to this posting schedule, don’t want to stress myself out) and...yeah. I hope to finish it by the end of August but I’m not sure if that’s realistic - at the very least, get as much written as possible before I go back for my last year of school. (Wow. Scary.)
Harry nodded, and took another bite of his bread, which was surprisingly good. Then again, once you get used to mouldy bread, any bread tastes good.
“Of course, Harry.” Dumbledore hauled Harry to his feet, dragging him to the bank of a pond that had been hidden behind the door. He stuck his hand out over the water, a chain appearing. “Harry, would you mind? My hand…”
“Mr. Potter’s core looks far too small for someone who causes that many accidents in potions. Don’t look at me like that — having a larger core means it’s harder to control,” he added, as Harry glared at him.
Luna, of course, immediately spotted Ron and Hermione for who they were, and after being quickly informed of the events that had transpired behind a
“M–Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket, and he told Kreacher…he told Kreacher to switch the lockets, after h–he drank the potion. And then Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to leave without him af–after he swapped the lockets, and to destroy the locket, and t–to not tell his Mistress. And Kreacher didn’t want to, Kreacher wanted to stay with his Master, but he had to obey, s–so Kreacher swapped the lockets, and then watched as Master Regulus was dragged beneath the — the water, and…” Kreacher trailed off, wailing as he knelt on the floor.
“Hermione, this is a memory, remember?” Ron sighed, “we need to get as much information as possible. We need to think now, mourn later.” Ron grimaced at the sight of the Dumbledore on the ground, but tore his eyes away and continued to study the island.
Harry shook his head at Draco, tucking in his own shirt and redoing his tie. Draco clearly wasn’t impressed, as he finally deigned to get off the bed, grabbing Harry’s tie and redoing it for him. A blush spread down his neck as he stepped away, muttering “he can kill a Dark Lord, but can’t tie a basic half-Windsor knot.”
The day after that the death eaters, after having been suspiciously quiet for at least a month, suddenly launched a massive attack on all the neutral magical creatures. They found out via Kingsley’s patronus, as werewolves and banshees flooded the ministry, flanked by death eaters. He’d sent them a list of the names, and after scanning the list four times Remus had abruptly apparated from the kitchen.
“Are we talking today, or over the course of Hogwarts?” Harry found himself feeling increasingly reckless regarding information he revealed about the past, as he grew more comfortable around Draco.
Around October, the younger Slytherins had started turning up to the Room. They hadn’t had it as bad, since the Carrows and Umbridge foolishly believed that everyone in the house supported their views and there were no muggleborns in there, but after they started trying to take punches and punishments for the few students from other houses that remained, while refusing to tell anyone where the others had disappeared to, they were treated as badly as the rest.
Getting into the office had gone off without a hitch — she’d walked straight in, and no one had said a word. She’d taken several classified files from various draws, and burned some more that they knew about — Dumbledore’s, Hermione’s, and the Weasley’s, to name a few. She’d used a spell to flatten and smooth them, before shoving them under the hideous, pink cloak she was wearing and stepped out.
“Coming right up!” Madame Rosmerta winked at him, sliding two foaming glasses to him in record time. He left a few sickles on the counter before hurrying over to Draco, keeping his head down as he passed some adults.
Harry sighed, slumping further. “I know. I just...don’t want to be there. I don’t want to talk to anyone.”
He grinned as her eyes cleared, then lit up with delight. “Excellent. I don’t think I would have had it in me to do that again anyway.”
Hermione and the twins had ended up not able to link multiple notebooks, since the current spells they were using weren’t compatible with whatever they were trying to add and there wasn’t time to make new ones, so Ginny had been sent off with a small, black, ring binder notebook, and a muggle pencil, so she could erase what she’d written with the little rubber on the back and reuse the pages.
Her brown eyes searched his for an unnervingly long amount of time, before she eventually nodded. “Come in when you’re ready.”
Most of the people they wrote to replied, although Kingsley’s letter came with worrying news that a lot of the people who he knew to be able to throw off the imperius curse had disappeared, allegedly on ‘sick leave’. They figured that they’d experienced the same fate as the people who hadn’t replied, but on the bright side, those numbers were few, and all members of the Hogwarts staff they’d contacted had replied.
“A member of the bloodline of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black — Kreacher is most honoured, oh yes, he is — would Master Malfoy be wanting anything? A drink? A massage? Mistress Black was always very fond of Kreacher’s foot–rubs, oh, she was…” Kreacher continued to mumble while Draco stared at him in equal parts shock and horror. Snape’s shoulders were twitching with restrained laughter. Harry and Ron had actually managed to keep themselves calm — until they looked at each other and burst out laughing, quickly reduced to noiseless wheezing. Hermione was tempted to join them, and could feel the corners of her lips twitching, but took a deep breath and calmly said “Kreacher. Get off the ground and listen to Harry.”
“Well I’ll just go then,” Draco said, making to get off the bed. He wasn’t sure what he’d do if Harry didn’t tell him to stay - it was more of a ploy to see what Harry thought.
. He was dreaming - soon, he’d wake up for breakfast, where he would continue to ignore his friends in favor of pining after Harry, like normal.
“I don’t think you fully understand the magnitude of the sacrifice I have made for you” Ron said, in the same tone of voice as Percy when he was being Important. He looked outraged when Harry told him as much.
“Portkeys.” Hermione said, as if the idea should have been obvious. “We’d have to have them go to a neutral location, since they can be tracked, but if it was close enough to apparate the paperwork to a safehouse then it wouldn’t be too difficult.”
If you've read this far, I'm glad you're enjoying the fic, and hopefully the wait for the next chapter won't be this long :)
“I agree, but there’s nothing we can do, for now.” Severus sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and glaring at the floor, his mind whirling with possibilities. He could easily fight his way out, especially with Draco by his side, who wasn’t bad at duelling; but dragging Potter along with them would be difficult. At the very least…
They continued with the small talk, going through two butterbeers each before Draco remembered that they were eighteen and could get alcohol.
Harry grimaced at himself. Draco had to do his homework, he couldn’t spend every moment of every day looking after Harry. Harry shifted, sitting further towards the back of his bed and wrapping his arms around his legs. He’d just go to the Weasley’s. Draco could get a break from him that way.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine. But I can’t do anything if you’re holding my hand.” Draco took his hand off Harry’s wrist as if burned.
“Kreacher, can you…wait, I don’t actually know what he should be after. Kreacher, answer every question from Ron and Hermione honestly, and obey their orders.”
He sat there for what seemed like an age, listening to Hermione’s screams, until Wormtail came down. But this time, his hand didn’t strangle him. He grasped Harry’s arm in a painful grip, and dragged him up the stairs.
Remus woke up at ten in the evening, a while after the sun set. He startled Bill with a weak cough, and then said in a raspy voice, “Sorry for dropping in on you like this.”
“I was just making sure - I worry about you, alone in that house. You could come stay with me and Ron?” Hermione had breached this topic at least once a week since Harry had left the Burrow; that is to say, since he broke up with Ginny. They lived in an apartment Hermione was renting in London until school started, and then were planning to use the money they’d received with their Orders of Merlin to buy a house. Harry would, but he worried - if he forgot to do his glamours, if he forgot to put up a silencing charm, if the charm failed...he couldn’t worry them anymore. He couldn’t be a burden - they’d already gone through so much for him in the last year, he couldn’t ask any more.
“He’s the ‘responsible’ one, after all,” George said, and, well, maybe he had a point, Ron had to admit.
wasn’t going to test on anyone else — the idea of harming anyone in the house made him shudder. Even Ron, to his surprise.
at his nearest follower, a man with mousy brown hair,  and hurried out of the room, his dark robes swishing behind him as he cursed Lucius for the anti-apparation wards surrounding the manor.
They apparated to the Manor, his mother and father ushering him down dusty passageways rather than through the main corridors. Once she deemed it safe, his mother enveloped him in a tight hug, the pair hidden in a dusty room. Draco breathed in her scent of jasmine, tears pricking his eyes. He took another deep breath, forcing his emotions down where they threatened to spill over.
The main issue Draco had when considering going back to Hogwarts would be giving up this freedom. While before he couldn’t have imagined living like this, now he couldn’t imagine living without it. The tipping point, the one that had him writing his confirmation, was that this was the only opportunity he would get to return to Hogwarts - while he had been happy in his home, it had been a refuge in sixth and seventh year, and didn’t hold many negative memories - and he wouldn’t have to go to the Astronomy Tower or Room of Requirement for the entirety of the nine months he would be back. He would continue paying his rent for the year though, just in case he couldn’t do it.
Harry watched the colours undulate for a few seconds, before noticing a thin, white thread trailing off. He frowned, his eyes trailing along it, only to find out that it led to Malfoy, who was staring at it in horror.
Harry turned the knob (just as gleaming and brass as the number) to reveal a room about half the size of a classroom. There were two double beds, each done in a soft grey. There was a huge window looking onto the forbidden forest, so Harry took the bed nearest to the window - Malfoy could fuck off, Harry wasn’t waking up every day to a view of the place where he walked to his death. Opposite each bed there was a desk and a wardrobe in a dark wood - maybe mahogany? Harry had never been much good at identifying plants - and there were two side tables between the two beds in the same dark wood. There was a rug matching the drapes on the floor, and while it all should have looked quite drab, Harry found it calming. He unshrunk his trunk and put a few random clothes on his bed to claim it as his before shoving the trunk underneath.
Luna chuckled. “I’m quite surprised it took you two this long to get together. I’m glad to see Draco’s influence has reduced the number of nargles around your head though, Harry.”
Harry laughed, pressing another kiss to Draco’s lips. Draco smiled in return at the pure, unfiltered joy that Harry sent down the bond. Now, instead of shadows, Harry’s mind was often lit up by some inner light. He still had his off days - his therapist said they would never truly go - but Draco and Harry worked through them together.
“I’m sorry I gave him your room, but it’s the only other clean room in this place, and mine has my bras and stuff…”
“My family was murdered by death eaters. Let’s teach this one a lesson.” As Draco resigned himself to his fate, a blue shield charm appeared, and a voice started yelling.
He stumbled out of the bathroom, not sure what he was looking for until he found his potions knife - gleaming, silver metal, sharp and ten times better than any provided by the school.
“Of course, you have already many notes on the theory of duelling, but no harmful curses please, but pair up and go ahead!”
Harry truly believed it, looking into Ginny’s sparkling, brown eyes, as she laughed, tossing her hair over her shoulder.
“Harry!” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arms and half dragged him to the dining room. “What happened? We didn’t expect you back for at least an hour! And what happened to your clothes, they’re all ripped and you’re
His parents picked him up with cold masks on their faces. To anyone else it would seem that they were distant and unaffectionate, but the fact that
He got dressed, having anxiously sat at his desk for the last hour as Harry was sleeping. He’d found out from experience that waking Harry up halfway through was good for neither of them.
considered occlumency to be a useful skill — and it was getting easier and easier to dissociate from the pain.
“Well, our last visit was cut short. And you deserve proper closure, and to go into your parents’ house, without…
Lucius muttered a curse, and the boy fell, his head hitting the floor with a sickening thump. Draco turned to look — he’d grown up
“I’m hallucinating.” He looked up at someone behind Harry — Harry turned to see Hermione, Ron, Remus and Severus, all with expressions of shock. Harry kind of wished he had a camera, if only to capture such an open expression on Severus’ face.
and he turned to see Dumbledore lying gracefully across the rocks, the tip of his beard not two centimetres from the water’s oddly still edge.
Draco raised one eyebrow, his silver eyes glittering with delight. The corners of his mouth slowly turned upwards and his gaze slowly lowered to Harry’s lips.
forgive him for that.” Harry reached the door just as Draco opened his eyes, and immediately dropped his tea cup, surging forwards and throwing his arms around Draco.
Harry’s lips thinned, but he bit into a chunk of bread and took a small sip of water, chewing slowly. “I look forward to it.” The five words caused a sharp pain in Harry’s throat, but it was worth it to see the smug look wiped off Lucius’ face.
“I’m up, I’m up, you little terror,” Draco said, ruffling James’ hair affectionately. The four-year-old had kept up the tradition of looking exactly like the Potters, with messy, jet-black hair and caramel skin. However, his eyes were a light shade of grey, identical to Draco’s.
“I am the Dark Lord, why didn’t I get Lucius to come down,” Voldemort muttered, grimacing as he stepped through the open door.
Remus felt a stab of guilt at the fact that he hadn’t thought of the kids that weren’t in the nearby vicinity, but Bill shook his head at him.
— and wrapped his arms around her waist, burying his face in her neck, which still smelled of her and not that awful rose scented perfume Bellatrix always wore. “Make sure you stay safe. I don’t want to lose you again.”
What ‘himself’ was, exactly, Harry didn’t know. At the Dursley’s, he’d been small and unassuming, trying his best to not get a beating. Throughout his years at Hogwarts, Dumbledore encouraged his reckless ‘bravery’ in a way no adult should. He went after Quirrel when he was
They ended up having dinner with Bill and Fleur, before flooing back to Grimmauld, with a bit more hope. Granted, they were woefully outmatched, but they had a
“He’s not that bad, Ron,” Harry replied. The Weasel looked shocked, his jaw nearly hitting the ground, while Granger just looked contemplative.
“Fuck off Blaise” is what Draco tried to say, but his voice was muffled by the pillow so what came out was “uh oh aise.”
“Do you know how unnerving it is to watch you watch an empty space wistfully where my brother and his wife disappeared into?” Remus almost fell over as Ginny appeared at his side, only not falling because Ginny grabbed his arm and held him up with a surprisingly strong grip.
Her eyes flashed darkly as she began talking. “The Ministry has taken all power away from the governors, making the Wizemgot in charge of staffing. Thankfully, they haven’t fired any of us yet, but they’ve put the Carrows twins in as professors,” gasps were heard from all around the room, and McGonagall nodded darkly, “and
He’d sprinted down three corridors before slowing to a fast paced walk, deliberately not thinking about how soft, and warm, and inviting Har- Potter’s lips had been.
When he’d seen how skinny Harry had been, he hadn’t registered the other emotion he’d felt at the time. But now, thinking about it - he felt protective of the Gryffindor. He hadn’t wanted anything to happen to him before, but hadn’t been opposed to the occasional hex. Now? He felt ill at the
The lesson concluded too soon, in Harry’s opinion, as the lesson ending meant the next thing he’d be doing is dinner. Flitwick set them an essay on the spell, which Harry considered doing straight after the lesson - he’d also got an essay set earlier in transfiguration recapping turning live animals into other live animals, and would quickly fall behind if he didn’t keep on top of things. He walked out of the room directly behind Ron and Hermione, who quickly fell into step either side of him.
As the day passed, Harry felt like he was on a high - he felt lighter than he had in the last year and a half, spending far too much time staring at Draco, admiring how the sun bounced of his pale hair, or how slightly softer light softened the harsh angles of his face, or how gracefully he did everything, from writing (in calligraphy, no less) to eating (with small, delicate bites and not a drop of food out of place. Harry felt even more honoured that he’d seem Draco with gravy on his face yesterday). All in all, Harry was completely and utterly obsessed - allowing him to ignore the nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach that
They baked almost entirely in silence, with Ron ordering them around the kitchen. Apparently he’d spent his childhood baking with his mother, and knew what he was doing. The rich chocolate cake, with slightly less icing than Ron had intended —
Being aware of the soulmate bond just made Draco more aware of the emptiness radiating from the other end.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. “That spell is very sensitive to ambient magic, so I was concerned that maybe it wouldn’t work, but apparently whatever magic that was preventing the dittany from working wasn’t strong enough to affect it.”
Just as they’d finished bottling the potion, Lucius came running in, hair still in place despite him panting with exertion.
“Okay, so if everyone has their assignments, even if it’s just continue as you are, we can leave for today — meet back here on Friday, yeah?”
“Couldn’t be arsed. I got food from the kitchens yesterday, and it’s been enough to last me until now,” Harry said, dismissing the concern with a shrug.
Potter arrived at the exact same moment as the group of Slytherins, so Draco decided to get his attention before entering the hall - at least he wouldn’t have to do this at a table of Gryffindors.
Everyone else was gormlessly staring at the exchange, Harry included. Since when were these two friends?
“You have to talk to us more often, okay? Let me and Ron have some meals with you.” Hermione lunged forwards and wrapped her arms tightly around Harry.
“Anyway, here’s your meal.” Lucius threw another two slices of stale wholemeal bread. “The Dark Lord doesn’t want you to die, apparently.”
“I’d first like to thank you all for coming today. I’ll cut straight to the chase; we’re here to formulate a plan, perhaps not to fight You–Know–Who directly, but to thwart his plans.
There had been an awkward moment when Draco had seen the mock dark mark on Harry’s wrist after healing it, a stark white scar remaining against his caramel skin, a reverse of Draco’s dark mark on his pale skin.
They often talked through the bond now, regardless of whether or not they were in public. Harry found it helped with his occlumency - when he talked through the bond, he checked his mental walls barring his emotions. They were made up of dense, green hedges - similar to the trees - and the shadows reared up against them, but didn’t go past.
be him, but sometimes Ron said things that just rubbed him the wrong way. He appreciated the bluntness — it was often preferable to the
“Not yet.” As the couple gaped at him, he practically bounded up the stairs and lay awake in bed for Merlin knows how long, excited for the morning.
A good ten minutes later, Harry’s heart was still pounding - due to adrenaline. And anger. Malfoy had looked as he always did when Harry had walked away - calm, collected, completely the little pure-blooded heir his father had brought him up to be. But when he had pulled Malfoy off the floor, his palms had been sweaty, and his grey irises had almost been swallowed by his dilated pupils; clear signs of fear. It was two weeks into the term - how often had this been going on? The attackers must have been reasonably sneaky - Harry had been following Malfoy around for a week, looking for an opportunity to give him back his wand now that Harry had his holly and phoenix feather one back, but had always been prevented by the idiots who insisted on following him everywhere. Thanks to them, he had refused to eat or drink anything Hermione hadn’t tested for love potions (especially when a few of them had tested positive), until she taught him the spell. Now, despite the idiots, he always felt alone - he and Ginny had been too alike to work, and the spark had died out within a week of them getting back together. Hermione and Ron, on the other hand, were sickeningly in love, resulting in Harry always feeling like he was on the outside of an inside joke. While he loved them both, Harry decided to avoid them a bit more than he usually would - at least, until the honeymoon period was over.
Also, I don’t know if you noticed but I’ve got an estimate for the total number of chapters! I’ve planned out what’s going to happen in each one, and I think I’ll manage to stick to it :)
Harry cast a stasis spell on Draco’s wrist to slow down the bleeding, before going to Draco’s trunk. He summoned the bottle of dittany he’d used the day before, and tried to summon what Hermione had used on his hand to stop it bleeding in fifth year. “It began with an ‘M’...mingled...moper...maple…” Harry was starting to hyperventilate, and took a couple of deep breaths before the word sprung to mind.
Harry slipped the horcrux into his bag and started to creep back from the way he’d come from, but shuffling footsteps were moving towards him.
been through worse. He sank lower until his head was underwater, listening to nothing in particular, ignoring the pain of his lungs for as long as he could. He suddenly emerged with a gasp, before leaning against the cool porcelain. He opened his eyes, and spotting a bottle, quickly soaped up his hair and scrubbed it clean, before dipping below the water once more. Satisfied that his hair was clean, he slid down so that only his head was out, resting against the edge of the tub.
“There you go. No more mark.” Remus grinned, before stretching his arms out. “I’m going to go get myself a snack. Do you want anything?”
“And we’ve all been sending people off to Europe, when we’ve had some perfectly good safehouses right here in England,” Ron grumbled.
“Don’t go saying that to Trelawney. She might throw one of her crystal balls at your head, then you’d be stuck with another scar.”
Voldemort sat at his chair, which wasn’t nearly grand enough — but apparently Lucius didn’t have anything better. A
Hagrid had been forced out with Fang by Umbridge within the first week, but Hermione assured Ginny that he’d reached the Burrow, and had gone to Romania to help Charlie with the dragons. As little love as she harboured for the beasts, especially after seeing them in the triwizard tournament, Ginny couldn’t help but think that he’d gotten the better deal.
“You have a bit of gravy here,” Draco said, gently wiping the corner of Harry’s mouth with his thumb while cupping Harry’s jaw with the rest of his hand.
After Potter finished the potion, Draco vanished the vomit and stood up, holding Potter's skinny arm and pulling him up with him.
them, at the very least. The Dark Lord still didn’t know that Draco could do neither, but would soon be finding out, apparently. Fenrir likely wouldn’t notice if Draco wasn’t pulling his weight, in his bloodlust — Draco shuddered at the thought of having to witness that — but Rodolphus probably would, and his father would definitely be watching his every move. Draco had hoped to go further before being found out, but resigned himself to his fate of being killed that very afternoon. It would be hard on his mother, but an easy escape for himself.
“We should — probably — be a bit — quicker,” Draco panted, feet pounding on the dry grass. “DUCK!” he added, and two flashes of green flew over their heads.
Which was why he was caught completely unawares when he rounded a corner in a relatively silent corridor to stumble ungracefully into Potter.
exactly, but it had been at least two months since he’d been down any, and the stairs of Grimmauld were narrow and tall. He managed to get down to the bottom without too many issues. That may have been due to Draco following him closely; despite his jokes Harry felt much safer, since he instinctively knew that if he fell, Draco would levitate him to the bottom. Or at least make the steps soft and bouncy for that extra comedic relief.
But that’s all they were. Small. Insignificant, in the grand scheme of things. No trouble for Lord Voldemort.
“That’s a good idea, Miss Granger.” Ron could only watch in shock as Hermione led them into the downstairs sitting room, allowing them to gently lay him on the sofa, before standing, both of them looking surprisingly awkward.
Hermione and Ron took three steps to the door, but were quickly petrified. Arthur plucked hairs from each of their heads, and put them in the two potions. Ron’s turned a fiery orange–red, a little darker than his hair, and Hermione’s turned a rich purple. Arthur then levitated the two teenagers back to the other side of the dining table, away from the door, and removed the charm.
Draco was shaking Potter’s shoulders, yelling at him to wake up, and could have sobbed with relief when those green eyes snapped open, staring directly into his. Potter was still shaking, but at least he was awake.
Bill turned off the stove with a flick of his wand. “Everyone sit down, I’ll go get Fleur and then we can talk.”
Luna nodded. “Centuries. But if you could talk to someone who’s been around for centuries…” Luna stared at Harry, clearly waiting for him to put the pieces together. Harry, however, was not getting it.
Sadly, neither Severus nor Draco had any immediate suggestions for how to remove the horcrux, since it would require killing Harry, and according to a prophecy, Harry had to kill Voldemort. It seemed like Voldemort had made the perfect situation that surpassed the prophecy entirely. Hermione remained optimistic, maintaining a bright bead of hope in the house, as she marched Ron and Draco into the library. However, she refused to let Harry go in, telling him to “practise his spells.”
Maybe slightly shocked by the revelation that he cared about Draco - his thoughts towards the blonde had done a one-eighty in the space of twelve hours - but
“I don’t know about you, Hermione, but I’m quite comfortable, here,” Weasley smirked at him, and Draco sneered back. Hermione just looked amused.
Charms was another question. Most of the lesson had transpired similar to Defence - Flitwick had lectured them about the proper way to cast mind-bonding spells, and how to make them temporary - but at the end he told them to pair up and practice, “While the information was still fresh in their minds.”
The books on horcruxes mostly talked about how to make them — useless, since he had seven already — but at the back it had some extra information on human horcruxes:
Draco murmured, waving his wand in a Celtic knot movement before flicking his wand upwards. “Do you know how to occlude, Potter?”
Harry raked his eyes over Draco - blonde hair slightly dishevelled from rolling around on the bed, shirt untucked and tie loosened.
Harry scoffed at Draco’s indignant tone, and headed off to the kitchen, sliding into a seat beside Hermione, who was deep in discussion with Ron on her other side. Harry found that he was increasingly tolerant of the ambient magic surrounding Ron and Severus — now, it was more like coarse fabric brushing his skin than needles burying themselves deep inside. “Hi, guys.”
He lay there for a moment, before everything came rushing back. He shot up, mentally bracing himself for pain that didn’t come. He frowned — he’d definitely been hit by quite a few spells, not to mention the
In the dream, it had had a couple of scars, but nothing too bad. Not that any form of child abuse wasn’t terrible, but it was nothing compared to this.
He couldn’t believe this was his soulmate. His initial concern had been that Draco would tell others. Well, that
The others had also improved significantly, resulting in Harry being the only person able to successfully beat Draco, if he lasted long enough. Nobody knew how, Harry included; he tended to put it down to luck, but Remus and Draco knew that there was something else behind the way Harry dodged spells that he hadn’t even seen.
Draco was clearly relieved about the neutral topic. “She’s also making me sit there, so you won’t have to suffer alone.”
There were lines upon lines of scar tissue, criss-crossing across Harry’s back, clearly never healed properly. It didn’t quite bulge out, likely due to accidental magic, but looked terrible nevertheless. Against Harry’s naturally caramel colouring, it stood out even more. Draco dragged his gaze up to meet Harry’s eyes in the mirror. They hardened, resembling glittering gemstones as Harry stared into Draco’s grey eyes. His lips thinned and he took on a fighting stance.
They walked to the graves in companionable silence, hand in hand. The bright, summer sunshine made it a much nicer walk, with yellow dandelions and buttercups springing up in the lush, green grass.
One good thing came out of the fanbase - Draco always got a giggly warning whenever Potter was nearby.
Harry and Draco stepped out of the pub, realising a moment too late that it was hammering it down. “For fuck’s sake, Harry,” Draco muttered, angrily stomping down the lane and evidently forgetting that his arm was still linked with Harry’s, who was dragged along.
“We both know I can’t. The adrenaline spike will disappear soon, and you know I won’t be able to apparate for at least twenty–four hours — just let me go. I’ll try to come back for the next full moon.”
“Pansy told me to ask you!” Harry heard Draco come to a stop, and he reluctantly turned to face the blond, all coherent thoughts vanishing from his brain. Draco’s mouth was moving, and he was moving his hands dramatically - apparently he did that constantly, not just when putting on performances in the Hall for Harry’s benefit.
“Tea” Draco demanded, taking the mug Pansy hurriedly handed him lest there be another Incident. “Much obliged.” He took a sip, staring at Potter’s hair as he took a scalding sip. It was worse than bed hair - it looked like he had just been shagged. Hard.
Harry trudged out, his school uniform draped over one arm, Draco already in bed. He raised an eyebrow at Harry as he got into bed.
Draco placed a hand on Potter’s arm, ready to withdraw if Potter woke up, but he simply continued to breath quickly, his hands twitching slightly.
Severus kept his face carefully neutral, mulling over the words. From the sounds of that, the death eater in question could likely be a potential candidate for Dumbledore’s side. If the codger ever got back from whatever secret assignment he and Potter were on.
Potter groaned again and sat up, looking as bad as before, except that his hair was worse. “If I eat will you fuck off?”
Hermione hurriedly put up as many wards and charms as she could to hide the house, before dragging Ron into the nearest room, stupefying Walburga’s portrait as she went.
“It’s not. It’s not.” Bill stopped shaking his head and sat back on his knees, looking at Percy with bright, determined eyes. “This is why we need to defeat You–Know–Who; to save the muggles and the muggleborns, to thwart his plans. For everyone who died. For mum and dad.”
“Get in, and don’t touch the water.” Dumbledore gestured towards the boat, his words tinged with urgency.
“We have not.” Draco looked quite smug, as did Flitwick. Harry realised why as he saw gold flash between him and McGonagall.
Harry’s mind was already spinning with the idea of having to go through that much pain, and was about to say don’t worry about it, because they’d heal by themselves anyway, but Severus beat him to it; “I do, but my magic hurts Harry, and I don’t know what effect it would have if I actually cast on him.”
“Don’t eat with your mouth full, Potter” Draco replied, avoiding the question. He really didn’t know, other than Potter had looked so pathetic on the bathroom floor, and at the thought of the darkness at the end of the bond, Draco hadn’t had the heart, or lack of, to insult him. “Perhaps I’m ill, I’ll be back to normal tomorrow.”
Hermione shook herself out of her stupor, packing all of her personal items neatly in her trunk with a flick of her wand, and shrinking the trunk with another. She pocketed the miniaturized trunk, casting a long look around the room. Lavender, Parvati, Fay and Julie had all left already. Hermione had always felt out of place in this dorm, never quite fitting in with their conversations, but had enjoyed several late night conversations with her roommates nevertheless. They’d been particularly helpful in fourth year for the Yule Ball. Hermione hoped that she’d come back, but knew that it would be a long time before she returned. She could only hope that McGonagall would allow her to sit her exams after the war was over given that she studied in the time between.
Once, something warm settled against his skin — something like home. He’d cautiously ventured forwards out of his mind, looking out of eyes that didn’t feel like his own — but no one was there. Shying away from the pain, he retreated.
If Ron had a drink in his mouth, this would be the point where he spat it everywhere. “Harry, mate, we’ve established I’m fine with you shagging guys, but not ferrets! That’s beastiality.” Clearly, Hermione’s vocabulary had been rubbing off on him, although
go back, because he didn’t want to have to wait years until his mind was sorted out and then get his NEWTs. He imagined going back as a twenty-five year old, sitting in a room of seventeen year olds who hadn’t been affected by the war as much as him. It just wasn’t done, and he didn’t want exceptions being made just because he was the
He turned on his heel, and suddenly he was on the island, watching Harry and Dumbledore glide across the lake. He turned around, looking around the island. It was made up of strangely jagged rocks, with a stone basin in the middle. There was a stone cup balancing precariously on the edge of the basin,  which, upon closer inspection, was filled with a deep purple liquid.
He’d also lost any use of his right leg, the pain of the infection steadily moving upwards. His heartbeat was erratic, fluttering —
Harry looked up and shook his head. “It’s fine guys, I’ll probably be the same when I have a new relationship. Once you’re out of your honeymoon phase it’ll be better. And that’s my cue”, Harry added, as Hermione and Ron started looking at each other in that way, and while Harry really did love them both he wasn’t ready to be present for a make out session unless he had a bottle of firewhiskey. “I’ll see you tomorrow for Hogsmeade, yeah?”
Kreacher looked at her with wide, pale–blue eyes. He looked as if he was going to say no — she’d asked it as a request rather than an order, after all — but then shifted his feet and continued. “Master Regulus was worried, very, very worried, and he told Kreacher to stay hidden and not leave the house. Kreacher stayed in his cupboard,most of the time, until Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard, one night. Master Regulus was disturbed in his mind, not quite himself, but he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. We went to the cave, again, to the basin, and Master — Master Regulus…”
you know how to do it?” Hermione cut in. Harry frowned — her tone was challenging, but surely Malfoy wouldn’t
“Here. Your dorm is further than mine.” Harry removed his warm cloak in one smooth movement, and in another was fastening it around Draco’s shoulders - even though he was a couple of inches taller, the cloak was just long enough, and he stopped shivering almost immediately. Harry should have been cold, but the heat of Draco’s stare warmed him plenty.
“Bye guys.” Ron waved to Dean and Seamus, who were whispering urgently in the corner. “Don’t miss the train!”
Harry quickly packed up his stuff, debating the merits of giving Draco his cloak to walk back to his dorms. One more look at the other boy decided it - he was much paler than usual, his lips no longer pink, and had his arms wrapped around himself.
The parents fell abruptly as Draco’s father fired two killing curses in quick succession, the wand movement too fast to track, the green light illuminating the room. It unnerved him just how adept his father was at the killing curse.
“You’re late.” Severus frowned at him, even as he flicked his wand to put some more potions ingredients in a bag.
“I don’t think I will.” Voldemort smiled, an evil smile that struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. At least, that’s what Lucius had said.
“Come off it Ronald. I’m going to go through the proper routes to the top of the Ministry, purging it of the idiots as I go.”
startled Harry, who would have flinched had he had an inch to move. He was thrown roughly into a room, hitting the wall with a thud and falling to the ground. The murmuring started again, and then Harry’s ties were removed.
“That’s a good idea, Harry.” Hermione smiled at him - one of those soft, ‘I’m sorry’ smiles. It made Harry feel slightly ill, so he said:
Both of them turned to the window as an owl started tapping at the window. It was huge, glaring down its beak at them with two huge, orange eyes.
His locket was still safe, and although Potter knew where it was, it was expendable. He should probably check on the ring, but he didn’t have any ties to it — it was his family home, but only Dumbledore knew about his family. And Dumbledore was dead.
He dipped the cup into the purple liquid — he could see a silver chain and greenish S that looked oddly familiar. However, halfway into the action, he heard a thud to his right. The cup fell from his hand with a
you can keep your breathing even, but I heard it change when the others walked in the room. Were you listening to the conversation?
And then he was being shaken awake, by slender hands attached to pale arms, face to face with wide, grey eyes.
It had been three months and twenty-eight days since the Battle, and twenty-eight days since he’d gone off Dreamless sleep, so he didn’t become addicted. This meant twenty-eight nightmares, twenty-eight nights of under five hours of sleep, and twenty-seven days of using glamours to hide just how bad the bags under his eyes are when around anyone other than Kreacher.
“We are in a war, Mr Weasley; and I am very knowledgeable in the area of defence against the dark arts, and could teach yourselves.” Ron blanched as Severus continued. “Also, I don’t know what the Order is up to, so we should probably organise a meeting.”
“Wonder what that was all about?” Draco said, sitting next to Severus with the countdown for the potion ticking ominously in the air.
Draco once again woke up having been blocked out of Harry’s mind. This time he hadn’t even been able to see the nightmare - he’d just been blocked, no matter how much he shouted and pleaded and hammered with metaphorical fists.
“Late morning, remember?” Harry grabbed his bag as he stood from the floor, digging through it until he found the emerald green jumper. It featured a lime green H with gold thread woven in to make it glimmer as the light caught it. It was a bit glitzy for Harry’s taste, but if he’d have had to choose any jumper for Draco to wear, it would be this one.
- across his back. Harry dutifully started making dinner, burning his hands and wrists a few times. Draco grabbed his wand, ready to heal them, before realising that he couldn’t do anything but watch. He stood next to a large metal box, which Harry had produced food from, watching Harry frantically sprint back and forth between another metal box which he put bread in and the pans on the hob. As Draco watched, the panic calmed, settling into something more along the lines of dread - as if he knew how this was going to play out.
, cast a disillusionment charm and a second charm to soften his footsteps, and walked down to the dungeons, sticking to the shadows. He hadn’t come across Nagini in all his time in the manor, but then again, he didn’t spend much time outside of his and Severus’ warded rooms.
— since the aftermath of the battle at the Ministry. Remus had ran away, afterwards — doing valuable work with other werewolves, but still run away. Hopefully the time away would have helped him heal, but…Severus was still nervous about seeing him.
He looked around him, squinting at the sunrise filtering through the towering trees. Despite having spent the last five moons in this wood, this area still felt unfamiliar. A thin carpet of pine needles pricked his bare feet as the wind whistled through the evergreens. He took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of dirt, and pine, and of the pack he’d spent the night — well, most of his time for the last year — with.
Malfoy looked between the three in shock — or maybe it was dread — before coming to the conclusion that he wasn’t getting a say in the matter. “As long as we have the biggest bed.”
Harry dragged himself out of bed as Draco started shifting around. They made awkward eye contact, apparently having reached a mutual agreement that they weren’t going to discuss the dream from last night. Harry knew Draco clearly didn’t mean it, but it still hurt a little.
Draco reached up tentatively, delicately wrapping his hands around Harry’s wrists, as if he was scared Harry would disappear. “Harry?”
They all started walking further into the woods. Draco saw Harry cast a wistful look back over his shoulder at the park, and grabbed his hand, so that Harry looked at him. “Later. After the war.”
“I wouldn’t have to ‘wiggle’,” Harry could hear the implied quotation marks, “if you had landed properly. You used to play quidditch for fuck’s sake.”
He removed his cloak, startling several elves. Kreacher came over first, croaking “What would Master be wanting in the kitchens? There is a feast in the hall, Master could sit with Master’s friends. Is Master okay?” He added, noting Harry’s eyes, which were likely red and puffy from crying.
a first aid kit and started to tend to Harry’s various cuts, before moving onto Draco and Narcissa, while Draco quickly recounted the story — the trip to the graveyard and the Peverell grave, the house, Harry’s ‘complete and utter
?” In his mind’s eye, Harry saw Bellatrix weirding multiple silver knives, hurling them at him as he lay, unmoving, on the floor—
Ron quickly looked to Hermione, who was now studying the water, having finally given up her fascination with the cave face.
The Weasel and Granger entered the room two minutes later, sliding into the chairs closest to Harry. They shot glares at Draco, but they were...milder than the ones he was used to.
Draco was greeted by closed drapes. He sighed and put the food on the bedside table - Harry had taken a muffin, which was good - vanishing the food from the night before and taking a piece of bread for himself.
After what seemed like an age, Draco aware that Harry could burst through the door any moment - hopefully not now, the prat was in no shape to be beating up fifth years - they finally saw sense, and lifted the jinx. “You will not breathe a word of this to any teacher, or there will be much worse to come” was whispered in Draco’s ear, before he heard the door open and close, and footsteps walk away. He slowly uncurled, taking note of what was wrong - a few broken ribs, and a broken nose, easily fixed by an
But Malfoy had said the charm didn’t work, and even if it did, it would have only lasted for five minutes, according to Flitwick.
Hermione rolled her eyes, exasperation evident in her tone. “Yes, obviously. Anyway, Harry’s unconscious.”
“We could send him an owl under a disillusionment charm, so that it didn’t give away his location.” Hermione bit her lip — she wasn’t sure that Dumbledore would be able to be found by an owl, if he was in hiding. Their magic was good, but not that good.
Ron really wanted to stay and check on Harry, and Hermione would probably be fine with Snape, but the looks Malfoy was sending him were extremely hostile.
She watched from the shadows as green flashes of light flew across the grounds, flinching as they hit the ground just behind the two — three? — figures sprinting across the ground.
person not vying to obliviate him and set him loose in the woods. “Severus, looking as dramatic as ever, I see.”
“Sure.” Draco thrashed Severus in game after game, revelling in the small window of normalcy from their everyday life.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but let Harry’s shoulders go just in time for Hermione to hug him. Harry felt a second pair of arms wrap around them — Ron —who then shouted “are the rest of you lot coming?”
Harry huffed, pulling his cloak around him and checking that his bag had everything he needed. He cast his glamours, before asking Draco “You coming?”
“Dumbledore wouldn’t be an issue — but I would like to talk to them personally. We shall strike after the Hogwarts term has ended. How much longer is it, Lucius?”
She removed his arm, standing up. “Of course.” She shot a glare in Ron’s direction, who had his mouth open, ready to object. He obediently closed his mouth, so she shot an apologetic smile before striding into the only space in the common room, near the door to go to the dorms.
Snape tossed a knife to Malfoy — a small one with a wooden handle — and winced. “The wards aren’t going to hold for much longer. Hurry up.”
Draco was released from the jinx, so he propped himself up to see an arse in front of him. An arse he would know anywhere.
“The Dark Lord preferred to keep me out of operations, but I do know the basic goals — gain control of the Ministry, which he’s done. Through that, he’ll gain control of Hogwarts, and then use Ministry documents and resources to hunt down muggleborns, before enslaving or exterminating the muggles.”
the Death Eaters on his heels. Up and up the spiral staircase, he ran, hoping against hope that their intel was wrong, that Dumbledore wouldn’t turn up there.
Potter was gazing down at his food, pushing it around with his fork and occasionally bringing a bit to his mouth. Nothing like the gusto he usually had. He looked a bit pale, as if he hadn’t left the house, but it looked odd from Draco’s angle - a glamour. It shifted slightly around his robes too. Potter was a powerful wizard, but had no talent for delicate spells - it was a strong glamour, but could easily be spotted by someone used to seeing them. It was similar to the ones his mother had used on his father when back from Azkaban - Draco wondered what Potter had to hide. Maybe he’d find out.
Harry determinedly shut his mouth, which had been hanging open, as Draco turned back around, and smirked at the light flush spreading across his pale cheeks.
Draco was pretty sure words came out of his mouth, because his brain was very much short-circuiting. Throughout the conversation they had been turned towards each other, but Potter had turned a little more, so that his knee was pressed right up against Draco’s. He’d all but ignored Draco’s little jab - it was all harmless teasing at this point, the two of them were friends - of sorts - and had continued to talk about his plans for the weekend. Draco wasn’t listening to any of it; his world had centered to that one point of contact between them. He adamantly refused to look at it, instead softening his gaze and staring into those green eyes, which seemed close enough for Draco to fall into. They weren’t a solid green - the outer ring was a couple of shades lighter, and when the light caught them at just the right angle - like now - they glowed. Between the beautiful eyes and Harry’s unguarded, joyous expression, Draco had no idea how long he could keep up his careless facade.
“That’s an idea, Harry - there is an unnerving lack of swearing coming from his room. Talk tomorrow, okay?”
, exactly, they were researching. He occasionally did his exercises, but often ended up throwing the wand that didn’t really work for him across the room in frustration. Ginny tried to console him and say that he was still doing well, and that
Severus gasped as the shape was completed, and the magic started to work. It felt like the magic was carving out a section of his skin, slowly, with a slightly blunt knife, before peeling back the skin. He squeezed his eyes shut, before opening them and studying the wall in front of him. Green tiles, well polished, splatters of grease towards the bottom.
Harry huffed, quickly drinking the potions before starting on the toast. “Since when do you know how to use a toaster?”
Malfoy grimaced, “I don’t, but I could probably find one — there were all sorts of hidden rooms around here, I used to look for them when we visited.” He shuddered slightly. “It’s a horrid place — kind of like a haunted house. It looks better now, despite the dust.”
“They don’t have to be, though. And yep, that’s pretty much all the solid facts known about them. There are various theories, about sharing magic, and...other stuff, but none of it is confirmed.”
half a foot shorter than him, he was more muscular, meaning it hung loosely off Draco’s slender shoulders and exposed most of his collarbones.
Ron sighed. “What, do you think Dumbledore’s dead, Harry’s been captured and forced to write this by death eaters?”
That Friday night, the situation was indeed revealed to be too good to be true, to mini-Snape-in-Harry’s-head’s satisfaction.
He knew that the cell was draining his magic, but hadn’t noticed for what he estimated was around forty–eight hours. Now, between the draining magic, thirst and hunger, he was constantly plagued with headaches and shivers.
for writing half of the outline for and editing this chapter! Honestly, she made this chapter what it is :) If you want to read more drarry, click on the link to go to her AO3 account! Honestly, she's got some great stuff on there (my personal favourite is Forty Days, we love a good quarantine fic)
“Let’s go.” Green eyes widened in shock, but he cast a silencing charm before he could protest. He put up new anti–apparation wards, this time making sure he could apparated in and out. Then he sent a message to the death eaters that were supposed to go to Hogwarts to send a note through the vanishing cabinet and get back to the Manor
A white–hot needle of pain pierced Harry right between Harry’s eyebrows, and he whimpered slightly in pain.
The rest of the teachers would just have to stay on, and he could send…Amycus and Alecto. Yes, they’d do nicely. They were vicious — there wasn’t much going on
“I’m going to drink it,” Dumbledore said, and Ron frowned slightly — sure, he didn’t want Harry to get hurt, but
- to Harriet, for putting up with me ignoring you on our discord calls and my delusional rambling.  I love you very much and you’d better fucking know.
“I was...but I couldn’t reach you. I’ll always be there.” A tear rolled down Draco’s face - he’d known Harry couldn’t see or hear him, but that small, broken voice, was one he’d hoped never to hear again. He hadn’t truly expected to never hear it again, but it hit him hard nevertheless.
Right so...this entire chapter is centred around child abuse. I’m sorry. If you don’t want to read the actual graphic abuse, it starts at ‘Harry woke up to complete darkness’ and finished at ‘Draco was finally pulled out of the dream as Harry lost consciousness.’ I’ve put sentences in bold.
“Alright, alright, let’s just go.” Hermione stepped in between them, glaring at both of them. Severus stepped out of the door, wondering how on earth Hermione was the adult of the house — it
The next two days progressed similarly to that day. Harry’s occlumency got better, meaning Draco rarely felt any emotion from him, and had reduced himself to regularly checking on Harry. The shadows didn’t get any better, but they didn’t get any worse either. Considering the new situation, Draco had decided to count this as a win.
Harry sat upright against the wall, eyes searching in the darkness. He saw a glimmer of silver, and heard the footsteps growing steadily louder, but this person hadn’t cast a
On the bright side, this is the last chapter where I didn’t really know what I was doing. I have a good idea for most of the other chapters, which means when I actually get time to write I should be able to churn out the chapters pretty quickly!
Between the Carrows and Umbridge, the rest of the teachers would stay in check. Well, all of them except McGonagall — but there weren’t any decent transfiguration teachers in his ranks, to his knowledge, and she was the best. Still, he should probably have a plan in place to subdue her, if necessary. Some inferi under his command in the lake should do it.
“Are you two going to argue, or are we going to breakfast?” Hermione glared at them both, who looked sheepish and sped up, Ron holding Hermione’s hand.
Bill nodded and passed his bag to Remus. “See you in a bit.” Then he ran out, as the other six touched their portkeys and disappeared from the room.
Satisfied with the conclusion he’d come to, if not particularly happy about it, Draco continued to their room. It was adequate - the bed was large, the drapes were grey - and Draco would get a nice view out of the window, as Potter had taken the bed closest to it. Draco unshrunk his trunk and put it on his bed, briefly admiring the silver lettering on the side.
Remus stood in front, with his hand outstretched — he had done his research — and Fleur took it, frowning slightly before she started chanting in Latin. Bill steadily kept his hand on her shoulder, not flinching even as her silvery–blonde hair started to fan out, floating on an invisible wind, despite the wind actually flowing in the same direction that she was facing. Remus winced as he felt the magic flow from him, but as a werewolf, his magic was rather strong just after the full moon — once the exhaustion wore off, that is.  He wouldn’t be this strong again until twenty–four hours before the full moon, so really, this was the perfect time. He took a deep breath and relaxed, allowing the magic to flow out of him — and before he knew it, the spell was finished. He took a step and stumbled slightly, but could already feel his core refilling.
“You have five minutes.” The booming voice echoed around the room, startling everyone. Ginny started sobbing, throwing herself into her mother — Hermione’s — arms.
“Bye Ron.” They both waved back, seemingly knowing that this would be the last time they would see each other in a long time.
“Long time no talk then. How are you? How’s rooming with Malfoy?” Everyone leaned in to listen to Harry’s answer. He recoiled a little under their stares, but reminded himself that no one needs to be worrying about him and steeled himself.
“There’s no point in feeling guilty, you’ve had your own shit on. Anyway,” he said, clearing his throat dramatically while unfurling the letter, “this needs to be read.”
Ron snorted, and then immediately looked horrified with himself, hastily hiding himself behind the parchment that Severus held out.
The sounds coming out of Dumbledore’s mouth were no longer words, just sounds with the odd pop of a consonant. The old man was rocking back and forth clutching his shoulder, which didn’t bode well. What happened when the curse reached his heart?
wasn’t feeling up to that. The thought of all those eyes on him, the pressure to be the picture-perfect Saviour, wasn’t one he thought he could endure. But he had to. Nobody needed to be worrying about him and his issues on top of their own. And it wouldn’t do to never leave his room again.
Anyway, it didn’t really matter, Hannah had interrupted, as the siblings looked ready to turn the dining room into a battleground; Narcissa had come into the dungeons on their fourth night there and taken them out of a secret passageway. No one found out until the next day.
Severus didn’t show his confusion, sweeping down and picking Draco up. “Time to go,” he hissed, before dragging him to his room. He saw Narcissa nod her thanks out of the corner of his eye, and smiled slightly as he exited. Not only did he know Draco had a mind of his own, which was a relief in itself, but if he could get him out, Draco could be a valuable ally to the other side.
“Top ten ways to crack your skull open, the first of which being demonstrated by yourself” Draco replied.
The blood rapidly drained from Ron and Hermione’s faces as they exchanged identical looks of horror.
disappear from the back of his mind - Harry hadn’t disappeared, of course, just closed off his mind a bit. Draco could see a hedge, the same green as Harry’s eyes, surrounding the shadows, keeping them in check. Draco’s heart broke a little as he imagined having to deal with those at all times.
Charlie came back from Romania three days before the wedding, and promptly left as soon as he heard the news. He’d never liked crying in front of anyone other than dragons, since the hugging and sympathy made him feel claustrophobic. His siblings had looked at each other knowingly, and not said a word as he returned with red–rimmed eyes, wand help aloft, ready to lift up the marquee.
Harry covered the space between them in a few short strides and wrapped his arms around Draco. “I don’t know. Prophecies are shit.” Draco laughed softly, the vibrations rippling against Harry’s cheek. It was easy for him to forget just how much taller Draco was than him.
Malfoy nodded his thanks. “So who’s in it? Weasley’s family, I’d assume — Professor Lupin — the aurors that aren’t taking bribes — some of the other professors?”
Harry was shouting at everyone in the kitchen while wildly waving the letter when an owl flew into the window, which promptly got blown to pieces by Harry’s magic, which had been crackling around the room as he paced.
“Severus? Anything to add?” Malfoy looked worriedly at Snape, who was also looking increasingly pale.
The people who had arrived were Kingsley, Hestia, Remus, and the aurors. They’d arrived just in time for the area to light up with green light, followed by a loud
They made quick work of the food, eating in silence, before Bill and Fleur side–alonged Ginny and Remus, who didn’t know the location.
“And you won’t, because I’ve been taught how to duel, and I’ll just stay in the Room anyway. I just need to close all the loopholes, I’ll be fine.”
“But it was solely because I — I was jealous, of your friendship with Harry. I don’t know if you remember, but — well, in hindsight, it was due to being mean to you, Ron — but Harry rejected me, and it hit hard. I’d never been rejected before, you see, having grown up the little pure–blood Malfoy heir, it shook me to my core, I guess. It doesn’t excuse my actions, but..well, I’ve never admitted that to anyone before, and I thought you guys would appreciate the reason, as shitty as it is. I am sincerely apologising for everything I did at school, and while it certainly can’t cancel out my actions, I hope you can both forgive me, at some point. It is a lot to ask, but…” Draco trailed off, having ran out of words to say. It made him unbearably uncomfortable to be so vulnerable — he hadn’t bared his soul like that to anyone since he came out to his mother — but they deserved it.
“No — as long as Draco spends a lot of time around Harry, it should accelerate the healing of his magical core. We still need to do the diagnosis charms for his physical health, though. And should probably do some healing charms on those cuts,” Severus added, grimacing as his gaze flicked to Harry’s cheeks.
“We can check to see if Mr Weasley and Miss Granger can do it when Potter’s conscious, but for now you two should probably share a bed.” Ron snorted at Malfoy’s expression, who looked horrified.
“Is that all? Because I’ve got a meeting to go—” Mundungus started to leave his chair, but was pulled back down by Tonks, who grimaced and wiped her hands on her robes afterwards.
“You know what I mean, I know you do. I can feel it,” Harry said, wiggling his eyebrows at Draco. He chuckled at the sight of the box again.
“They aren’t as healthy as vegetables, and you know it. Oh look, there are the Slytherins,” Hermione added with clearly false enthusiasm.
Draco looked down his nose into the mortar. “It’s...adequate. Stir the water anti-clockwise with one hand and gradually add the egg with the other, then turn down the heat and add the horseradish. Then stir clockwise
He’d felt...detached, since charms. Like something was leeching his emotions away. He hadn’t felt particularly angry at the person who tried to hex him on the way to the library. He hadn’t been particularly amused at a funny joke he overheard.
“Throw it away, the book said one should be enough.” Voldemort hurried out of the hall, trusting Severus to do what was required.
Harry dragged himself out of the shower, regretting it as soon as the cold air hit him, but determinedly pulled on his school trousers, shirt and jumper, leaving his robes for the while.
“Harry…” Draco reached out as if to caress Harry’s cheek, but Harry flinched backwards, into the wall. Draco stopped his movement, his hand dropping out his side.
Harry reached forward, trying to find Draco’s magic, his soul. It was barely there; a small, delicate thing, fading slowly. Harry tried to capture it, to wrap it with his magic, but it had been completely drained.
Muttered swears and curses rippled around the room. A couple of people looked as if they were ready to argue, but McGonagall stood before any of them could even open their mouths. “Albus’ death is a tragedy. But he dedicated his life to fighting against evil, and we will continue that fight today, and tomorrow, and every day after that until the fight is won. We cannot let his death weaken us — we must mourn, and forge that sadness into strength, to take down Dolores Umbridge, and the rest of those complete and utter…dicks!”
Also, I’ve almost finished writing - just got to write 11, which I hope to finish either tonight or tomorrow night. Because its pretty much finished, I’m going to post all the next chapters every other day instead of every 3 days :) I’m not going to start writing my next fic until all these are posted, but I still want to write, so please could you send prompts to my instagram/tumblr at Huffinglepuff?
“Well, class, that’s the end of the lesson! Put the classroom back to it’s usual state, and twelve inches on what you could improve about your duelling technique...except you two.” He pointed two fingers at Harry and Draco. “Could you do a demonstration for my sixth and seventh years?”
“So there’s no way to remove the blood bond?” Hermione tilted her head, continuing to watch Ron out of the corner of her eye.
When Flitwick had pronounced them soulmates, Draco had felt numb - all of dreams had literally come true. The panic that had set in from the other end of the bond had crushed any elation Draco might have felt.
On the train, Hermione didn’t really say much, no matter how much Ron tried to coax a conversation out of her. She just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was
At night, the pair still slept in separate beds (to both of their dismay) and ended up cuddling after whatever nightmare they forced themselves through. Both of them had worked out that sleeping in the same bed pretty much got rid of their nightmares, but neither brought it up in fear that the other would do...something. Harry was scared Draco would out him to the press (despite the small part of his mind adamantly screaming that Draco would never do that), and Draco thought that Harry would immediately get a room change as soon as he found out that a
“Nope, I’m awake now.” Harry got up, pulling the blankets down as he did so and exposing Draco, who looked adorable. Harry held a special place in his heart for how Draco looked in the morning - his hair stuck up at odd angles, his eyes were squinting and the corners of his mouth were downturned as he swore at Harry for getting him up at this ‘ungodly hour’, whether it be half-past six or eleven. Beautiful.
“Rise, both of you. I need you to make this potion.” Voldemort slammed a book on the table, making them both flinch, and opening it to a seemingly random page. He moved backwards so the pair could look.
“Apparently so. We might as well work together — make the cake quicker, then we can go back to sleep.” Hermione smiled hopefully, but Ron scowled and muttered something in Hermione’s ear. “Not anymore,” she said out of the corner of her mouth, and Draco’s heart sank.
“Your drapes were closed. I thought you were in bed. Why would I knock on the door of an empty bathroom?” Draco took a step forward, relishing in the fact that Harry neither backed away nor lowered his gaze, but instead turned to face Draco head on.
Draco shook himself out of his shock, glaring at the huge back of the fat man. He was dragging Harry by his hand, opening wounds - from
“You wanna work together?” Potter asked. His voice was more gravelly than usual, like he’d been screaming. Unlikely, considering how antisocial he’d been throughout the day.
“Unless the secret keeper dies, or removes the spell.” Hermione finished Ron’s sentence. “Kreacher, can you bring me every book from the Black library that has useful information about the Fidelius?”
“I’m not going to. Thanks for sorting me out - I haven’t had a particularly bad episode since being at the Manor, but I forgot to occlude before I went to sleep.”
I’m probably going to have to change my posting schedule to every other Friday, because mild writer’s block regarding this fic - I’m still writing it, but it’s slower, and I don’t want to publish shitty chapters, so sorry guys :( even if my writing speeds up, I’ll probably stick to the slower posting schedule, and then post it more regularly when I’ve finished writing.
Draco barely flinched at the knife cutting into his skin, at the blood that trickled down his hand, concentrating on his task. Slowly, so slowly, the mark came off.
Nothing particularly eventful had happened in Arithmancy - he’d sat alone, in the corner, and taken notes, not really contributing, not drawing any negative attention. The usual.
) before sighing and lying back down on his bed. Tomorrow was going to be terrible. And Potter would never sit next to him again.
Then he’d dreamt of Harry rescuing him from the Voldemort’s grasp, being whisked away to wherever Harry was hiding. He’d dared to hope, when Harry had been in his basement, that when he broke out he’d take Draco with him. But he’d just taken his wand, leaving him near-defenceless against the death eaters in his household.
(It was all Draco could do to not start squealing like the newest member of the I heart Potter club.)
Dumbledore looked at him from over the top of his half-moon glasses. “I thought you agreed not to question me. We don’t have time to test it — Voldemort is on his way, is he not?”
Draco leaned in for another kiss, ignoring the shocked gasps of people in the hallway, in the Great Hall, and whispered against Harry’s lips “Okay, Harry.”
After another hour and a half, people started emerging from the dorms. They seemed surprised to see Harry, but having grown up with him they had no illusions about the ‘Chosen One’.
Draco was convinced he’d heard a chuckle as he walked out the room, and a warmth from the other end of the bond that usually eminanted emptiness.
Remus took a few stiff steps and started when he scented a wolf walking behind him on near–silent feet.
He turned to see Draco, who mumbled something obscene and tightened his grip on Harry, who pressed two gentle kisses to each corner of Draco’s mouth. He couldn’t believe how natural this felt - and how long they’d taken to get here. It was the end of November!
. The seventh years had always seemed so tall — to think, Cedric was in seventh year when he’d died. He’d seemed so heroic and manly to Harry, as a fourth year. As a seventh year, he certainly didn’t feel heroic and manly. Even if he was—
“Breakfast started an hour ago and will run for another hour, and the elves will give us anything we want anyway.” Harry fell into step besides Ron, who looked at Harry as if he was from another planet.
and Harry had a huge crush on him and seeing that expanse of pale skin just made him want to run his hands and mouth all over Draco, and giggling because between the unkempt hair and downturned mouth, he looked like an angry kitten.
Harry felt the warm magic wrap around him and kept still, not wanting to be removed from this dream. He hadn’t had a dream in weeks, to his knowledge, and this was wonderful — the magic gently caressed his skin, chasing away the chill of the dungeon and soothing the cuts. It might have even stopped the bleeding.
“Whatever they’re after you for, you need to make sure you succeed in it. It must be key to defeating Voldemort if he’s this desperate.” Arthur sent a thin smile at Ron and Hermione. “You two,” he addressed the twins, “I’m very proud of what you’ve done. Keep it going, even when things seem bleak. You never know when something’s going to come in useful.” He turned to Ginny. “Don’t do anything rash — you’ve got a temper to rival your mother’s. Be calm, but fight when it counts.” He took a deep breath, and hugged Bill and Fleur, whispering something in their ears.
- Lastly, I mentioned towards the start of the fic that Hogwarts hadn’t had any soulmates in twenty years. The soulmates twenty years ago were Remus and Sirius (AHH! WOLFSTAR!) I may eventually write this, I may not, but if anyone wants to - if you have a vision or something, feel free to write it. I’m not sure how people writing parts to other people’s fics works on here, so if you do want to can you DM me on either tumblr or instagram @ Huffinglepuff :)
Draco pushed himself up with his right hand, sitting beside Harry as he drew the bowl over to his lap. He sniffed at the water - murtlap and dittany - before examining his arm. It was marred with raised, white scar tissue, going halfway up his forearm. Under the scar tissue...Draco almost threw up. While the mark was even more faded than before, it was still there, light grey against the pale skin. Draco flexed his wrist - there was a dull pain emanating from beneath the scar, but overall it could have been a lot worse.
Somewhat detached from everything, Harry’s first thought was “it’s been a while since I was in here.” His forehead was in
Severus frowned. “I haven’t really been in contact with the order…Professor Dumbledore was the only person I really spoke to, and he’s been away for the last six weeks.”
The war was over, there was no reason to still fight people. There certainly wasn’t any reason to be hexing people who had been forced onto the wrong side.
“Yes, although a better course of action to take would be to steal them. Then we could save the muggleborns, or at the very least warn them. We’re too small to face the Dark Lord’s forces alone, but we can help others evade them.”
“For the love of Merlin- Theo, bring your book with you, you can find your place much more easily without little pieces of Draco on it after he explodes.”
“If we spend tomorrow planning, the guards are most lax on Thursdays, since they go out for drinks on Wednesdays and are generally a bit sleep–deprived.”
Harry spent a remarkably long time in the shower, but eventually emerged, grabbing the food and sitting on Draco’s bed, to his surprise. “Sorry for not talking the last couple of days.”
Then, Draco felt panic - nothing like what he’d felt from Potter at the announcement of them being soulmates. Just as Draco had figured out it wasn’t his Slytherin self-preservation, but coming from the end of the bond that was normally empty, it sharpened into something...worse. Not at Draco - this new emotion promised destruction. Vengeance.
jumper - for some reason, he hadn’t taken it off - he practically started drooling at the sight of him walking down the gap between the house tables.
Somehow, Potter was always where Draco was. When Draco left class, Potter was there. When he walked into the Great Hall, Potter was often on his heels. And where Potter went his adoring fanbase went - girls and guys alike, after the wizarding world had a crisis over Potter coming out as bisexual.
He walked down the path towards Hogsmeade. He had no intention of going to the village, but it was on the opposite side of the castle to the forest. He skirted around the Whomping Willow, which waved its branches menacingly, making sure Harry knew what would happen if he dared approach. He sat down, leaning against another tree, facing the Whomping Willow and the castle. At least he would know if another student came down.
He looked longingly at the bread — Bellatrix had clearly gone out of her way to pick a horrid slice, with little mould spores everywhere. But he was a horcrux — and horcruxes needed to be destroyed.
charms every five minutes. Finally, when there were only three other than himself and Severus, he called out
Harry huffed and lay back down. Draco followed suit, hoping that Harry couldn’t hear his heart pounding.
“Well, Harry, one would assume that when you were dead, the bond was broken. Since there isn’t much — if any — documentation about such a bond, never mind someone coming back to life, we don’t really know what it’s supposed to mean. We should take you St. Mungos, but—”
Harry woke up on the dreary Saturday morning close to pushing Draco out of the bed. He wasn’t even surprised when they woke up in the same bed anymore.
She might have apparated, gone after them, but she had nothing with her at the moment, and no way to help them.
Having spent forty minutes wandering and daydreaming, Draco went to the counter to pay, before banishing them to his room and going over to the three he’d arrived with. Millie was sitting on a stool, looking rather bored but still running an eye over whatever Pansy came out wearing and giving her her blunt opinion.
She immediately snatched it up, skim reading it by the fire for about ten seconds before triumphantly saying “He’s shagging Malfoy.”
“Molly is the one you’re going to have to go to” Harry replied - while he invested in the shop and George would listen to him, Harry didn’t feel comfortable using his money against George. However, Harry had no issues with throwing George’s mother at him.
Hermione’s face lit up in a grin, before both of them were abruptly pulled from the memory as a flash of red light — a
Draco went to the entrance hall at exactly half past eight. His father and Greyback were already in the hall, and Rodolphus turned up five seconds later.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and snatched the flask from Snape, uncorking it and, surprisingly gently, pouring it’s contents down Harry’s throat.
The Ministry fell as Bill and Fleur danced, silvery tears soaking Bill’s suit as they whirled around the room as one being. Kingsley’s patronus caused the somber event to erupt into chaos, Hermione apparating Ron and her beaded bag onto the doorstep of Grimmauld Place.
The conversation had changed a lot during his zone-out, but thankfully no one had noticed - they were watching the entertaining, monthly edition of Ron VS Dean: Quidditch or Football?
The toll the cell was taking on his magic was becoming steadily obvious — Harry found that, when he was awake, he could feel the magic of whoever come down the stars - it stung against his skin, like a thousand tiny needles.
Narcissa kept her bag, ready to leave, on her at all times. It was only small, with an undetectable extension charm, so it was easily hidden under her robes.
The screams suddenly stopped, and Ron turned spun around, to check if Harry was okay. Dumbledore bent down, looking for injuries and murmuring to Harry, who relaxed at the sight of the old man, mumbling replies too quiet for Ron to hear. Ron jumped forwards, away from the water when he heard a splash, but when he turned around to look, the water was perfectly still. Ron turned back to Dumbledore and Harry, who was curled up on the floor. Dumbledore murmured something to Harry, his expression becoming determined as he dragged Harry to his feet, past Ron, to the bank, before pressing a hand to Harry’s chest, preventing him from tumbling into the water. He summoned a chain from the water without a second thought, and Ron
Severus had demoted him to the floor and taken the stool, although not before transfiguring it into a rather nice sofa. Draco sat as far away from Weasley as possible, even if that did mean sitting next to Gr–
After a chorus of “Okay Harry”’s and “See you Harry”’s, he turned around on his heel and walked out as fast as he could without running. Each double room had its own bathroom, and Harry’s, thankfully, was empty. He went to the toilet, and cast a mouth freshening charm instead of brushing his teeth, before heading to his room. Malfoy wasn’t there, but his trunk was - it was black with gleaming silver buckles and “D.A.M” in silver lettering on the side.
“Traitor.” Draco ruffled Scorpius’ hair, putting him on the ground to toddle to the house. Even after all these years, all the Weasleys and Harry congregated at the Burrow every other Sunday for lunch if they could.
“You remember how you had that link? Well, I can reform it, which will drain almost all of your remaining magic to bring Draco back from the brink of death. The bond will be significantly stronger, so you need to be sure that you want to spend the rest of your life with Draco, because you can’t go too far apart for long periods of time without the bond straining — and if it breaks, Draco will die. Additionally, whenever Draco is injured, you will feel a large drain on your magic, and whenever you’re injured or drain your magic, Draco will feel the same amount of pain, and will probably lose some movement, depending. Essentially, your magic will be sustaining Draco — and when you pass, he will pass too.”
For the first time, the welcome feast was muffled by an atmosphere heavy with tension. Everyone huddled in small groups, knees touching as they craved some semblance of comfort under the heavy gaze of Umbridge and the Carrows. They ate in silence, shooting sideways glances at the huge gaps at the table. The Sorting Hat had been allowed to sort the kids, but had been threatened with incineration if it dared sing a song. To everyone’s surprise, it obliged, the sorting passing by in record pace as four Gryffindors, three Ravenclaws, two Hufflepuffs and two Slytherins were sorted.
Ginny didn’t mind life in Grimmauld — she often talked to Harry, since Ron, Hermione and Draco were all holed up in the library more often than not. Harry had grumbled multiple times that they refused to let him help, and in turn refused to tell Ginny just
He looked in the mirror, noting he looked considerably worse than usual. He cast his usual heavy-duty glamours, before grabbing a book to stare at from his trunk and sitting in a chair in the common room.
“You should probably go to Pomfrey, you know.” Draco’s head snapped to the left to look at Harry. He looked a bit better than usual, surprisingly. The shadows under his eyes were a bit lighter, and his face had started to fill out. He still looked as if he’d arrived fresh from Azkaban, but it was a start.
Draco held out his hand, saying he’d be fine with the dittany and salve but...Harry didn’t want Draco to have to move with all those injuries. And he’d comforted Harry last night - Harry could do this, now.
“She’d a very recognisable owl, Ron — we’ll have to glamour her feathers on top of the disillusionment charm.”
Draco was on the floor, in a huge pool of blood, and his skin was as white as paper. He had deep scratches across his face, and bite marks all down his arms and torso, huge chunks of skin ripped out to reveal muscle and bone, spurts of blood squirting rhythmically, weaker than they should have been. “Draco, you
He felt something hit him in the head, then Bellatrix’s heels were clicking away. Harry groaned and sat up, his arms shaky beneath him. She’d clearly cast a couple of crucios as well, based on the pain in his muscles and general shakiness. Gritting his teeth, Harry pushed himself up so he was sitting against the wall and examined his body.
He stood up and looked, to see the whole class staring at him in awe, his Professor clapping his hands together. “Brilliant! Splendid! Marvellous!”
On top of that, he’d barely spared a look in Draco’s direction - a sharp contrast from the stalking of sixth year. Draco had almost missed it, until bright green eyes were staring in his direction once again.
Trying his best not to groan at the headache pounding at his temples, Harry dragged himself upright.
Potter held out his hand for the flask, but promptly dropped it. A hasty levitation charm stopped it from smashing on the floor, so Draco sat next to Potter on the floor, grimacing at the smell, and held the flask up to his lips. Thankfully, Potter drank the potion - Draco didn’t know what he would have done if Potter was being difficult.
“I know,” Draco said, his breath catching as Harry nibbled on his ear. When did he get so good at this?
What was most worrying to her, was his plans for Hogwarts. He already had a headmistress chosen — a toad–faced which, who’s expression was closer to the malicious glee of the Carrows than the blank, neutral expression of those under the imperius, which meant the children were in even more danger than usual.
Voldemort stepped into the cell, vanishing the contents of the bucket with a flick of his wand and presenting Harry with a quill and paper. “Write to your little friends and tell them you’re safe. Don’t try anything, I’ll be watching you the entire time and both me and Lucius will read the letter before it’s sent.”
Harry’s eyes darted nervously between the other two death eaters, who were wearing identically malicious expressions. Harry tried to suppress a shudder.
Draco glared at Severus, before turning back to his book, allowing the conversation of the others to wash around him.
There were cuts criss crossing up and down his right arm, and the left had an elaborately carved dark mark.
Remus stepped out of the embrace, already feeling the post–transformation adrenaline rush ebbing away, and apparated to the Burrow.
After two hours they headed down to dinner. Walking into the Great Hall he ignored the images that bombarded him, determinedly looking around for a familiar flash of blonde hair. He started panicking as he didn’t see Draco, but suddenly remembered the bond.
He let his eyes roam freely over Draco - hunched over his desk, quill scribbling away. He clearly felt Harry’s gaze on him, turning around to flash a grin before turning back to his homework. Harry beamed at his back, before a small part of him said
Harry fell to his knees in front of the grave, his good humour evaporating. He thought he was ready for this, but he wasn’t. What did he say? Was he supposed to speak?
were they still bonded, then, if Draco had done the spell correctly and bonded himself to Potter? It shouldn’t have lasted for longer than five minutes. But here he was, hours later, experiencing Potter’s emotions.
“Two butterbeers please,” he said, trying to angle his face away from the majority of the crowd. Thankfully, it was mostly made up of Hogwarts students, who were used to seeing him around the school.
Draco didn’t know what he’d thought would happen at the end of the charms lesson. Perhaps Harry would have joined him in studying in their room. Perhaps he would have invited Draco to the study session (Draco would have declined, but it was the thought that counted). Either way, there was no excuse for the sadness that Draco hid behind mind barriers when Harry had walked off as the missing piece of the trio, rightfully returned. He didn’t belong with Draco - a Slytherin, a Death Eater, once a pure-blooded bigot. He belonged with the loyal Weasel and the smart muggleborn.
Harry rolled his eyes and ate his toast, which had come with the perfect amount of butter and jam. “So did your super–accurate
was younger, or fiddling with the hem of his shirt. His hair slowly became messier, curling more at the front and escaping the neat lines. Harry preferred it — it made Draco seem more…approachable. More
Ron lifted a hand, and saw that it looked like it had been drained of blood. Hermione looked fine, other than the fact that her skin had a slight grey tinge. “It’s probably the lighting.”
The day of the wedding, Ron and Hermione polyjuiced into Molly and Arthur Weasley, eliciting fresh tears from the rest of the family, who knew what had happened. As far as the others knew, Ron was upstairs with spattergroit (the ghoul in Ron’s pyjamas) and Hermione was in hiding with her parents in an unknown location. The rest of the attendees assumed the tears were due to the emotions triggered by the first of this generation of Weasley’s getting married, and no one asked too many questions.
“He was in denial,” she replied shortly. Weasley scoffed beside her, and received yet another stamp for his efforts. “I’ll talk to him - just be at dinner, I’ll make sure he’s there.”
The conversation continued for hours, making plans for the next few days, figuring out how to get in touch with various Order members, who to invite to the first meeting, and other things. Severus mentioned that he’d have to be spending more time making healing potions, if this is what they were getting into, and remembered about Remus’ werewolf problem. He volunteered to make wolfsbane, but realised if he was to be spending this much time brewing, he probably wouldn’t have time to teach the kids defence. Remus agreed to take that over, three times a week.
He called all the death eaters to his dining room, and dismissed Severus and Draco — they needed to do their potions. Anyway, even without them, the group was a hundred strong.
After a long time in Honeydukes, the rain had let up so the group spent a while just wandering up and down the track. Around lunchtime, Ron shyly asked Hermione to lunch in Madame Puddifoot’s, who blushed a bright vermillion before accepting. After about five seconds of staring into each other’s eyes they remembered Harry and Draco, who were looking on amusedly.
“I killed Voldemort, being seen with you isn’t going to ‘tarnish my reputation’ or anything. And also, I do not care.” Harry crossed his arms - he wasn’t leaving without Draco.
“Bad luck mate” Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Maybe McGonagall would let you get a room change? I’m sure you could sleep with me and Neville. Or in the common room.”
Normally, the dream forced him to relive the moment Dumbledore died, helpless to help. Never had he been forced into Dumbledore’s place. Others had, but never him.
A flash of silver, and glistening droplets of blood sprayed across the seemingly impenetrable cave face. A  bright white light shone across what Harry assumed would be the outline of a door, but Harry fell to his knees, clutching his head as his scar burned.
“It’s—it’s okay.” Percy said, cautiously approaching Bill, clearly unsure of how to comfort his brother.
Draco sighed, and rubbed his forehead. So much for Potter being easy to deal with - of course the git was being a self-sacrificing hero. “Well what am I supposed to do with you then?”
waste — most of the wolves had agreed to remain neutral, which was an improvement from them blindly following Voldemort. Most of these people weren’t fighters — they’d be safest in the forest.
Harry shivered. He was always shivering, now, even as beads of sweat trickled down his face. An area in his chest — or maybe his abdomen — previously a reasonably large ball of warmth, getting him through the long nights in the cupboard back at the Dursleys, was shrinking, barely the size of a marble. Instinctively,  he knew, as soon as that marble of warmth disappeared, he’d die soon after. The smaller it got, the slower it shrank, as if fighting for Harry’s survival, but Harry was quite sure he wouldn’t last another week.
have woken up everyone else up — but Draco frantically screaming “Potter!” wouldn’t help in the slightest.
He didn’t really sleep, just lightly dozed. At one point, two in the morning according to his wand, he took some food from the side of his plate - he felt gratitude towards Draco, but really, he couldn’t understand. Better to leave him be.
“Yeah, yeah, show-off,” Harry rolled his eyes, “will you go get the ingredients? What cauldron do we need?”
“Probably. We’d have to ask him that, when he wakes up. Until then…do you know what the Order’s been doing in the last few weeks?”
“Going to take up healing, Potter?” Draco smirked as he nudged the door open with his foot, holding his wand in one hand and some vials in the other, some food levitating behind him.
Remus thought about it, burying his grief and guilt. He’d only encountered Draco in lessons — he’d always acted up, likely because of his father’s beliefs. But now that he was away from Lucius — he’d probably been forced to do something that he wasn’t happy about — he might actually grow into a
“Ron ordered some, and it just didn’t taste the same. Stop trying to ruin my fun, Draco.” He pushed Draco’s shoulder. He was always doing that - casual shoulder pushes and nudges with his feet in class when Slughorn fucked something up, a sparkle in his eye when Draco turned his head indignantly.
“But he barely looks like he could survive another day!” Draco looked at him with wide, grey eyes, even as his skin paled further thinking about the state of Potter.
Tearing his eyes away from Draco, he finally lined up the cork and the hole and started to walk towards the classroom’s centre aisle, taking all of one step before tripping over his bag.
This pain - this pain was a thousand times worse than whatever Bellatrix could conjure. Because this pain - the physical pain was nothing, compared to the coldness and apathy in those eyes, the heartbreak that actually made his chest hurt with the pain of it. He barely registered the
“Well if we put some charms on the letter so only a Weasley can open it, and send it to Ron, then we can put our location and reveal the fidelius to them. I think they’re somewhere in London, so it isn’t a terribly large distance, although they’d have to stay the night so they don’t splinch themselves on the way back. But we’d have time to plan, which is what we need.”
Malfoy knocked on the door, waiting for Flitwick. The tiny professor opened the door, and looked delighted, saying “Come in, come in, I don’t have a lesson or any marking and am rather bored…”
Potter was lying on the floor, his breathing shaky despite him being clearly unconscious. His potion hadn’t been made a moment too soon.
, she spend the rest of the night at Ginny’s side. Nobody took note of the triangle hanging around Xenophilius Lovegood’s neck, and no one bad–mouthed Albus Dumbledore, even as rumours flitted around the crowded tent.
Kill himself, probably. There wouldn’t be another option for him. A lifetime under the Dark Lord’s command isn’t one worth living.
Ron rolled his eyes and opened the window, untying the letter and getting a nip to his finger for his trouble before the owl took off into the night.
Ron took the bag from Hermione and chucked it into the corner, before holding her hand. “Come on, you’ve got this.”
Draco looked at Harry curiously, before taking Harry’s hand in his own. He chose a deep cut running up the side of his forearm, and pointed his wand at it, the end trembling slightly, and he didn’t make a move to heal the cut.
Thankfully, the decision was taken from him, as his floo chimed. Harry hurriedly cast the usual glamours - to hide the bags, add colour to his face, add weight to his body - and then answered to Hermione’s face in the fireplace.
“Sorry, I — I have no reason to have done that other than I really like you, and you probably want me to leave, which can be arranged, I’ll just open this door and head right ou—”
Based on all of this, Harry was really concerned with his decision to go back to Hogwarts in two days. He had no idea what the room situation would be, since there weren’t exactly eighth year dorms in the school, and what if he had an episode in a lesson? That wouldn’t be good for anybody.
Harry sighed and leaned against the wall, casting a disillusionment charm and steadily watching the doorway. After about fifteen minutes afterwards, Draco emerged lugging a huge picnic basket with him. He thanked the elves, casting a featherlight charm on the basket before looking around for Harry.
The next few photos were of him as a baby, with his parents. In their arms, walking and holding the sofa for support, zooming around their ankles on a tiny broomstick. He couldn’t help but see how different this Harry was from what he’d seen in the mirror in first year. This Harry was chubby, with round cheeks, his eyes lit up, his forehead unmarred by the ugly scar. In first year, he’d been underweight, his bones sticking out in places they shouldn’t have been. He’d had a huge scar on his forehead, drawing attention that he’d never wanted. His eyes had still been bright, though, and one constant was that his hair stuck up at all angles.
But she hadn’t come by since she’d almost killed him. And Harry doubted that Voldemort would let her near his horcrux after she almost killed him.
“I said I wasn’t hungry,” Draco replied, smiling softly anyway and taking the plate floating beside him, spreading butter onto a slice and sinking his teeth into the bread. He only ate a couple of slices, however, before stopping. “Are you going to stare at me all night?”
Harry thought, before closing the distance between them and kissing Draco. It was hardly more than a brush of lips, but Harry felt it all through his body, sparks dancing down his spine at the contact.
Harry had taken to flicking through the notebook that had been connected to Ginny’s, looking for a clue, or who to send a message to. He finally just asked Kreacher to go to the Room of Requirement in Hogwarts and try to find out what happened to Ginny from someone in the room. Kreacher came back a day later, with a letter written in shaky writing, from none other than
