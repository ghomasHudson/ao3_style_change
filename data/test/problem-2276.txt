Darkness. All around him was darkness. Impenetrable and everlasting darkness. Ron looked around, trying to find what he was looking for. A spotlight shone down from above, illuminating only himself. He walked around, trying to find his way, but could not tell which way was which. Suddenly, he heard a high-pitched scream. Ron knew it was one of his family members. He started to run in the direction of the scream, but could not get any closer. Ron called out their name and tried to see if he could locate them. “Mum? Dad? Percy? Fred? George?” No one answered him. The scream started to get louder and sounded more painful. Sprinting, he tried to reach the family member. Suddenly, Ron stopped, for the lights in the room came on. He was in the Chamber of Secrets. It looked just like it did two years ago. In front him, Ginny was on the ground, bound in chains. She looked like she was going to pass out and was covered in blood. Ron took a step closer to his sister, wondering if she should get any closer. “Ginny?” he asked. Ginny screamed and threw her head back from the sheer velocity of the pain. Her head came forward and she looked directly at Ron. Her eyes pleaded for help. “Ron! Help me!!” she screamed. Darkness surrounded Ron again, the after-image of his sister seared into his mind. “Wake up.”
She pushes herself up on her elbows, looking at him with a curious intensity. "It's done. I had an abortion."
Harry considered how to phrase this. "Well, you know we're worried how this will reflect on Draco if and when he runs in the next election. So, er, we hired Parvati and Lavender."
Draco spoke around a lump in his throat. "You have great intuition, Ted. Your intuition is maybe better than ours was, maybe, I—"
, it kept giving me women to rescue. So I can tell you that it wasn't looking too deeply into my mind."
But Hermione is in the flow of dancing and waves him off. Harry, who realises exactly how drunk he is as he unsteadily makes his way to the bar, knocking into people as he goes, freezes.
If Harry's going to have no family, at least he has no family with Hermione. "Let's go out and get drunk?"
He and Ginny had tried to talk again, and it had been hopeless—disastrous. The kind of talk that doesn't so much open up a rift, but shines a light on rifts already there.
James grinned at the elf and Disapparated; Lorraine followed. Loud bangs sounded from the fifth floor.
Aster flung her face into Draco's chest, rooting for a nipple. Poor child was forever trying to find human nipples to suck, and with no success. It was worst with Ginny. It was like Aster could sense that those tits had nourished three babies.
Hermione looks at him in that way she has where he's 99% sure she's not performing Legilimency, but he's sure she's seeing his soul. After a moment, she nods.
Rump's office looked much the same as it had when Kingsley had been in office, but the atmosphere could not have been more different. Everyone there always seemed to be walking on eggshells—a state of affairs Harry was proud to report never prevailed in the DMLE under his leadership. Rump, on the other hand, sacked his assistants so often Harry had never met the same one twice.
"Maybe," she says, looking up at the sky. "It's hard to say. Might help if we all sat him down and suggested it together, a bit of an intervention, you know?"
Draco tilted his head before he could ask his mother continued to speak, “I was strolling through Diagon Alley when I saw a poster. Remember how you used to play quidditch as a boy?”
Once the toast popped he gently plucked them out, managing to only burn himself a little bit. He dropped the toast on his plate and sucked on his index finger. It soothed the burn only slightly but it was better than nothing. He pulled his finger out so he could spread jam over his toast. The high pitched whistle of the kettle caught his attention. He poured some of the steaming chamomile into a teacup. After trial and error he had discovered chamomile helped his stomach the most. He never understood why his stomach hurt so bad in the morning… his mother always told him it was just the nervous jitters.
Ron grabbed the cards and looked them over, laughing at the “Get well, Wanker” card just as Harry had hoped. The redhead sighed and looked over everyone in the room, “Yesterday the team came to see me, sad you couldn’t be there, Harry.”
Maybe that’s what made Harry stand up. What made his set down his food and begin to stride toward the Slytherin table. The world seemed to stop as he took a seat across from Draco. Everyone fell silent as Harry grabbed a plate and began eating.
Draco’s ears turned red with rage. Beating him daily was far from best for Draco. Forcing him into a cult following of Voldemort was sickening and disgusting. Draco watched people die in front of him, how could that possibly be best for him?
The exchange left Draco without an appetite and he pushed his plate to the center of the table before standing. He slowly walked off down into the hall, all while stroking his cheek in pain. She may have been small but damn, did she know how to really hurt when she slapped. It almost felt worse than when Granger had punched him square in the nose. He had deserved that one though.
It had been a week since Draco had gotten his first mystery letter. Since then there had been no other writings or trinkets. Just him, his boxes, and the odd charm in his pocket. The questions still rung in his mind. Who wrote the letter? Why did they write it? How long have they been waiting to contact him? Those questions were pushed down and far away.
Harry never wanted to save him. It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be true. He refused to believe it was true for now and for forever he’d avoid the truth. He’d run from it just like he ran from the past. Draco’s burning feelings that he couldn’t describe were both the truth and the past.
When Harry looked into Draco’s eyes, he saw the same scared look he saw in the mirror every morning.
“Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.” He chuckled to himself and held the charm to his chest. Rivals and enemies to the bitter end huh? It could’ve been different. He knew it all could’ve been better if Harry had just taken his damn hand. He wouldn’t have hated him, wouldn’t have become a death eater.... Maybe his father wouldn’t have beat him so often.
It was a brief and dizzying moment before tumbled out of the lobby’s fireplace. Most likely built there for witches and wizards traveling this way. The people in the lobby sat unphased as Harry stood and dusted off his clothes. He walked to the front desk and asked to see Ron. His visiting hours had luckily just started for the day and Harry navigated his way through the corridors and stairs until he made it to Ron’s room.
He stripped off his sleepwear and pulled on the outfit. Ever since Ron’s injury he hadn’t been looking after himself properly, Nismy decided to take matters into her own hands. He didn’t need her to pick his clothes, but she had insisted she would.
“Thanks.” His voice was stiff as he watched his mother move to the couch and sit. Her eyes still sized up the room. Draco shut the door and stood by it, not knowing what to do.
Draco sat on his back porch. The sky was cloudless and a soft blue. He admired it as he sipped on his tea and chewed on his toast. The strawberry jam was delicious. For once he was glad to be enjoying breakfast. Moving out had really been a wonderful idea.
As Severus led Hadrian and Valorie to the secret entrance he stopped and turned around to face the twins. “You two might want to stand back.” Severus pulled out his wand and placed the tip on the floor and started chanting in latin.  Hadrian and Valorie’s eyes widened as the ground opened up to reveal a stairway leading down. “ Following me please.” As Severus walked down the stairs carefully he entered the secret weaponry. “Wow. Are any of the scythe ours?” Hadrian asked his mother as he looked at the blades. “Yes I'll go get them.” Severus left and came back with two scythe. Severus handed Hadrian a black scythe with  a crismon stone in the hilt and where the blade connects to the handel itself. (If you’re a Legend Of Zelda fan and you know who demon lord ghirahim is and what his rapier looks like then you can imagine Hadrian’s weapon. Just a heads up.)   Then he handed a purple scythe to Valorie that looked just like Hadrian’s but the metal was purple and the stones were black.  “How?” Valorie was just as stunned as Hadrian.  “In your father’s family it is a tradition for any new members to get a blade because I was married into the family I also got my own.” Severus  summoned his own scythe. A pitch black scythe. Similar to what the twins had but his was fit for a queen. “Wait… You’re the queen of darkness?! In history they mentioned you but never by name.” Severus looked at his shock son and daughter, a small smile making its way across his face.   “That’s correct and your father is the king of darkness. We only took the titles because we needed away for the community to know us but not by name. Let’s go back before your father starts to worry”   As Severus and the twins made their way back up they ran it to a worried looking Tom. “Severus what were you doing down there?” Severus gave Tom a shy look. “I was just giving them their scythes.” Tom started to calm down knowing that his family is ok. “Well we should head to bed now. Tomorrow, Hadrian if you wake up to a black mamba sitting on your bed it’s probably me.” Hadrian looked at his father with a weirded out look. “Ok. Now the real war starts.”
Today Harry turned 14.  The day started pretty normal, his aunt banging on his door. He sighs as he gets up and walks out to the kitchen.  When he walked out a sudden pain went through his back and Harry fell. The others noticed and started to freak and pointed to the boy’s back. Harry turned his head to look and saw pitch black wings, blood dripping on the floor.  Aunt Petunia screamed at him to shower and clean up the blood. After showering Harry went to his room and laid down trying to figure out what the hell happened out front.
Tom watched as Severus rushed out of the classroom with Remy. From what he gathered from her breathless rant, Hadrian was in danger and needed Severus’s help immediately. He was hoping that Severus would be there to help convince Karkaroff to join, but he knew that he could manage on his own. After all, Karkaroff was one of his most loyal Death Eaters before misfortune befell them. He heard a knock on the door. “Come in,” Tom said. As he suspected, Karkaroff walked in. He closed the door behind him. When he laid eyes on his master, he promptly sunk into a deep bow. “My lord,” he said. Tom commanded him to rise before him. With the formalities out of the way, the two greeted each other as old friends. “Igor Karkaroff. I wondered when we would meet again. I hear that your school is flourishing and that you lead a prosperous life.” Karkaroff thought that he was scolding him for not trying to help his master achieve that. “I-I am s-so sorry Lord Riddle. I tried my best to help you when all was not well.” The Durmstrang headmaster bowed his head in shame. After a few seconds, he looked up to see that Tom had a remorseful, faraway look. “I know, Karkaroff. You did your best. And please, call me Tom. There is no need for formalities anymore,” Tom chuckled. Karkaroff relaxed himself. Tom led him to a cleared off potions table. They got themselves comfortable before Tom went to business. “I’ve been meaning to ask you to rejoin the Death Eaters, Igor. I am sure you remember the fight against Dumbledore, correct?” Karkaroff nodded his head. “Of course I remember. I lost a lot of sleep around that time and my hair began to turn white.” Tom looked at his colleague and realized he looked much older than he did years ago. “Yes. After the fight, Dumbledore had you imprisoned in Azkaban for a while. How did you manage to get out?” “When I was imprisoned, Dumbledore visited me every other week. He made sure that the Demeanors had wrought enough pain onto me until I cooperated with him. I realized that I was going nowhere until he heard what he wanted to hear. I began to say what he wanted me to say, cooperating and obeying every whim. He then deemed me ‘reformed enough’ to be with the rest of the magical community. After a few years, he told the jailer that I’ve ‘seen the error of my ways’ and that I should be released. The only reason that I’m not back in Azkaban is because Dumbledore truly thought I reformed.” Tom scowled at the thought. “Dumbledore is a fool to think that he could ‘reform’ Death Eaters. You were clever enough to trick him. Your cleverness and deceptiveness are precisely why I ask you to rejoin our coven.” Without a second thought, Karkaroff answered him. “This life was given to me by you, my lord. I do not intend to give it to anyone else.” Tom grinned at his devout follower. “Thank you, Igor. I knew you would make the right decision. And enough with the formalities already.  I insist that you call me Tom. Just not when in a meeting.” “Sorry, my lord. I mean, Tom,” Karkaroff corrected himself. Tom began to head over to the small fireplace near the far side of the room. “I better tell Lucius the good news that we have another recruit. He’s helping my sister-in-law protect Riddle Manor. He’ll be delighted to know that your back. I still remember you two would rival over who was the better dueler.” Karkaroff laughed at the fond memory. “Lucius was always good at spell casting, but I was better in countering his spells.” Tom laughed with him as he knelt down and lit the hearth with a quick spell. He was trying to communicate with Lucius through the fire grate. When Tom casted the spell, Lucius’s face began to form within its embers. “Tom? Tom! It’s good to hear from you. How’s life at Hogwarts?” Lucius’s voice echoed through the fire. “It is great so far. Igor has decided to rejoin our ranks. Another Death Eater to battle against Dumbledore.” Mr. Malfoy’s face in the fire smiled back. “That’s great. I can’t wait to tell the others the good news. I…” Lucius was cut off by a sharp knock at the door. “Who is that Tom? Classes should be near over by now. No one should be heading to the Potions room at this time. Transform and hide!” Lucius warned him. Tom waved him off. “It’s probably just Severus. He had to go help Hadrian and the others.” Tom shifted his weight to look at the door. “Enter,” he called out. Draco opened the door and an unexpected figure walked in struggling, with Hadrian forcing her to move. The rest followed suit, confusing the three men who watched the unusual sight.
The young Riddle circled around the Weasley boy, ready to get to the fun part. He looked upon Ron with hatred, channeling his anger. “Well, now that you know, I think it's time to get to the reason why you are here: your suffering. Sectumsempra!” Hadrian casted the spell towards Ron, a bright light heading towards his victim. Ron was blasted backwards, his binds keeping him from struggling. Ron let out a scream. A scream so terrible and piercing that it bounced off the walls. Blood spilled from his ears and nose. His skin flayed of his bones, revealing dark, crimson blood underneath. Hadrian reveled in Ron’s pain. He maniacally laughed, soaking up every moment. “Crucio!” Ron started to twitch in pain. It felt as if lightning and fire jumped onto every part of his body. His inside felt like they were melting. Hadrian thought that he didn’t seem like he was in enough pain and decided to cast it again. “Crucio!!” Hadrian screeched. His victim doubled over and wailed in pain. His flesh tightened against his ribs, cracking at the edges. Ron started to cry. The pain was too much. “Stop….Stop….No more…” Hadrian watched as Ron moaned in pain. “Oh, Ron. We are just getting started.” Hadrian kicked Ron in his stomach, forcing the breath out of him. He kicked him a few more times. Each time, he hollered in anguish. Hadrian summoned his scythe to his hand and began to slice Ron. His blade had slashed against the young Weasley’s skin, covering him with new cuts. The scythe even made Ron’s previous wounds bleed deeper and fiercely. When using his scythe started to bore him, he willed it away and clenched his fists like stones. Hadrian punched him over and over. Each blow was more painful than the next. Hadrian took out his anger on Ron. His rage, his hate, and his love were what fueled him to keep going. To torture Ron until he was an inch from death. He grabbed Ron by his neck and flung him into a wall, his body crashing against stone. Ron lay crumpled at Hadrian’s feet, curling into a ball that pooled blood under him. Ron struggled to get up. He could barely breathe. He was dying. Hadrian picked up Ron by his shoulder and propped his bloodied body up. “You are...a monster. Have you...finally...gotten your fill?” Ron taunted him, wincing with every word he spoke. Hadrian knelt down to his eye level and smiled. “Not yet,” he smirked. Hadrian bit into Ron’s neck feeding off his blood making sure it would taste good for his mother. Hadrian then drove his hand right into Ron’s chest. Hadrian curled his fingers like talons around a small object and pulled out Ron’s heart. It beated rhythmically in his palm, glowing and pulsing red with enchantment. (Once Upon A Time anyone)  Hadrian looked at Ron’s heart with amusement. “Hmmm. My pregnant mother will love to feast on your heart.” The heartless boy held his head up with all of his strength. “Who..who is...your mother?” he asked fearfully. “You already know him: the teacher that you despise.” Hadrian loved how Ron’s eyes widened in shock when he realized who Hadrian’s mother was. “Snape. . .” Hadrian eyes glowed with hatred when the bloodied boy used his mother's maiden name. “That’ll be Riddle now.” Hadrian could see the fear as Ron figured out who his parents were. “You’re the missing son of Tom Riddle. But they said that your mother was female...” “Well, they were wrong. Severus is my mother and my baby sister Amelia is the child that your sister abandoned.” Hadrian was getting bored of Ron’s constant talking and questions. “Will you ever shut up?!” Hadrian punched the already beaten boy in the face, wanting to completely kill him. “You know what, I'm done with you.”  Hadrian resummoned his scythe and slashed it at Ron’s neck, cutting his head off. As Hadian did that, blood splattered everywhere, covering the wall and himself. Ron’s head plopped on the ground, his face still with shock.
When reading the paper Hadrien felt betrayed and wanted the spells broken right away. Snaggletooth shook his head and led the young Riddle to a room where he told Hadrien to drink a potion to remove all the spells and blocks. After drinking the potion he felt different. He turned to the mirror to his left and saw that he looked like a young version of his father with red eyes. While his eyes were shaped like his mother and he had the same jet black hair.  Hadrian was also taller. Going from 5’5 to 5’9.  The young riddle smiled at his reflection to see fangs from the vampire side of his mother.
Madam Pomferey let him sleep for a while. Once he was awake enough, she gave him a couple of potions for the pain and to help the baby. He fell back asleep after she gave him the medicine. She watched over him while he slept. He tossed and turned, mumbled a few times, but was pretty fine overall. As she straightened up the hospital wing, she watched the sky change color from a bright blue to honey gold. Even though many patients came and went, she was quite lonely. During Severus’s school years at Hogwarts, she helped him when he was being bullied and became quite close. Later on, Severus woke up from his sleep. He felt a little refreshed now that he relaxed. Feeling a little chilly from a draft, he pulled the blankets closer. “You’re awake. I’m glad.” Severus spotted Poppy walking towards him with a cup in hand. She placed it by his bedside. When looked in it, he saw a rich red liquid sloshing around. Blood. “I know it’s not Tom’s, but I always keep a vial handy just in case you need it,” Poppy said. Severus took the cup and slowly drank the blood. It wasn’t sweet like Tom’s, but it wasn’t bitter like Mud bloods. “Thank you. It helped.” As Severus looked around, he realized that the rest of the room was empty. “Not that busy today, huh? I would have thought you’d have your hands full with Ms. Weasley’s incident.” Poppy lightly chuckled at his remark. “I did have my hands full. Once Ms. Weasley came in, she was my top priority for most of the day. Your son did quite a number on her. After casting numerous spells and giving her potion after potion, she was recovered. Although, by the time she walked out of here, she looked quite shaken up. She is no longer physically hurt, but I bet that experience will traumatize her for a long time.” Severus took another sip of the blood. “Well, at least some good came out of that,” he whispered to himself. Poppy noticed that Severus was becoming agitated when she talked about Ginny, so she changed the topic to something else, trying to keep his mind off troubling thoughts. “I wanted to say ‘congratulations’ on your baby. I know I said it earlier, but I wanted to say it again because I am so happy for you, Severus. When I first saw you all those years ago as a lost and confused student, my concern was to help guide you to find happiness. I’m so glad that it finally came.” Severus smiled a bit. He really did come a long way once he put it in perspective. “Yes. I agree. Happiness is...something that I’ve noticed is really hard to come by. The moments I’ve had with Tom and the children were truly amazing. The thought of spending those moments with our newest member is quite thrilling.” “Speaking of your baby, Severus, your glamour spell will only harm the both of you more. If you want to hide your stomach from Dumbledore and the rest of the faculty is fine by me, but you need to be careful on how you are going to do that. Glamour illusions may sound appealing to use, but they sometimes have negative side effects.” Severus sighed. “And here comes the lecture.” Poppy placed a hand on his shoulder. “I’m not going to lecture you, Severus. I’ve already done more than enough with students today. From what Tom told me, Narcissa Malfoy has been watching your pregnancy thus far. If you two have the same friendship now as you did back then, she must be constantly berating you. Your friendship aside, Tom told me that she helped you correct your eating habits and made sure that the baby was growing correctly. Since she helped that from early on, the baby seems to be developing nicely for the first month. I don’t want that to regress because of a glamour spell. Maybe you should wear looser clothing from here on out to conceal your stomach. With that, no one will take a second glance.” Severus packed longer robes for special occasions. Seems like they now had to be put to use. He stared at the blood in the cup, watching the liquid slosh and sway as he moved it. Placing a hand on his stomach, he imagined seeing his child in front of him, holding hands together. That vision lasted for a couple of moments. Severus’s headache returned and felt dizzy, chills shuddering down his spine. Poppy noticed it immediately. “It’s already time for another dose of medicine. I’ll be right back.” Poppy hurried to grab it while Severus hugged his stomach in pain. Once she rushed back with the medicine, he gulped it down. The pain began to subside; the dizziness gone. “Get some rest, Severus. With the remainder of the year ahead of ourselves, you’re going to need it. If you need anything let me know. I’m here to help, ok?” Severus nodded to her. He quickly drifted off to sleep, the vision of his unborn child warming his thoughts.
Hadrian was walking hand-in-hand with Draco to the Slytherin dormitories. “You’ll like it there,” Draco told him. “It’s much different than your old Gryfindor one, but it is still cozy.” Hadrian huddled a little closer to his mate, clutching his arm with his hands. The Slytherins walked through the snaking dungeon corridors. Whenever they got further down a level, it got colder. They made it to the Slytherin entrance, where a painting of Salazar Slytherin waited. “Hello, Severus,” the painting said. “I see you brought your students. They look like a fine bunch.” Hadrian and Valorie made their way through the crowd, trying to catch up to their mother. Salazar saw their faces and recognized them instantly. “Welcome, my heirs. I’ve been waiting for this day to finally meet the both of you. I was foretold of this moment by your mother, and now, it’s here. Make me proud, for I know you will. Password?” Severus stepped up and told him the password. “Pureblood,” he said. The door swung open and the students were led in. Salazar was now facing the wall and away from the students, but still spoke to them. “Welcome, my little Slytherins. May your ambition lead you to greatness.” Hadrian followed Draco and his mother into the common room. He has been in there once before. When he was still Harry Potter, he snuck in with Ron to gather information about the heir of Slytherin from Draco. Now, he is staying in the Slytherin dormitories and is the heir of Slytherin along with his sister. Just like Draco said, it was cozy. It was a giant room, bigger than Gryffindor’s. The ceilings were vaulted, which dangled black crystal chandeliers from the ceiling. Velvet couches were scattered around a fireplace that spewed green fire. The Slytherins filed in and started to sit down on the couches. Pansy walked over to Severus with an inquisitive furrow in her brow. “Professor?” she asked. “What did the painting of Salazar mean about the transfer twins being the heirs of Slytherin?” Severus knew that this was going to come up after what the painting of Salazar said. Even though he is not supposed to tell anyone the truth, he trusts the Slytherins. He knows that they can keep a secret and they looked out for one another. “The reason that Salazar Slytherin had said that Hadrian and Valorie are the heirs of Slytherin is because they are. Everyone, these are my children Hadrian and Valorie Riddle.” The students walked up to the twins, introducing themselves all at once. The two of them couldn’t keep up with the names since everyone was overlapping one another. A boy went up to Severus, trying to ask a question. “Umm, Professor? If they are your children, who is their father?” he asked. Severus rolled his eyes, knowing he was going to have an odd duck in his house. “Their father...is Tom Riddle.” All the Slytherins gasped when they heard their names, for they heard about the strength of Riddles. “Don’t worry,” he assured them. “Everything that you know about the Riddle family is false. We may be powerful, but we are nice.” He heard a voice call back from the group. “So, your husband is the Tom Riddle? And these two are your children and the rightful heirs of Slytherin?” Severus told her yes and everyone processed the information. For a minute, the students whispered amongst themselves. After a while, they welcomed Hadrian and Valorie into their ‘family’. When the twins were accepted, they felt happy that they were accepted for their true selves. A few minutes went by with Hades and Val introducing themselves. “All right,” Severus interrupted. “It’s time for bed. Classes will start early in the morning, so no staying up. Girls, your bedrooms are on the right. Boys, yours is on the left. You will find your belongings next to your bed. Goodnight everyone.” Severus left for his room, leaving the students to settle themselves in. “Mother.” Hadrian called out to his mother right when he was about to open his bedroom door.”Yes, Hades?” Severus turned around to face his son. “Father and I have a plan that we need to tell you.” “Let’s go into my room and talk about it.” Hadrian watched as his mother opened the door to his room, revealing a large room with one wall covered with books on potions. The bed was a simple queen bed with gray sheets and a black bedspread. “Let’s sit on the bed, ok? Hadrian sat next to his mother on the bed. “So, what plan did you and your father come up with?” “When Dumbledore got the letter, I asked Father if he wrote it. After he answered, we came up with a plan to kill Moody.” Hadrian explained the plan to his mother. “So, your father wants to sneak into Moody’s room and bite him.” “Then he’ll meet with you in here.” “Alright”
They were much subdued compared to yesterday, Harry noticed, but were definitely breaking the dress code. Hermione wore a low-cut shirt that showed a sea of cleavage and bra straps. She wore no makeup, and her hair was a wild mane. She wore a short skirt and tall boots.
A yellow butterfly flapped between them, landing directly on Draco’s forehead. He stood, abruptly stiff. “Harry.
"No, listen, Potter. I don't care about the baby. That baby was never a person, was never going to be a person. I care about
Penelope's bright eyes were too much for Harry, and he found himself looking at the upholstery of his chair. It was a red and brown scratchy weave.
"Go ahead, ask me anything." Harry's eyes were all challenge—it reminded Draco of that short-lived duelling club, back in school. "I am not fucking around, Draco."
He stares up at Ginny's ceiling. The plaster is cracked in places, and younger Ginny had used shimmering gold paint on the cracks. There are charmed stars up there too, but the spell is fading. The stars perpetually look like that moment right before sunrise, when you know the stars will be gone any minute, lost to the new day.
When they get inside, Malfoy bursts out laughing. "Oh my goodness. What was that? Was that you trying to be subtle? Merlin help us. Merlin save us from Harry Potter's attempts at subtlety."
"You know," she continued, "imagination is like a muscle. Often, with disuse, it withers as we grow up. All the weight of society's expectations of 'acting like a grown-up' beat it out of us. In your cases, you were forced to grow up even more abruptly than most people, because of the war. And sometimes, like Draco said, we intentionally keep it weak, like a defence mechanism, because if we don't dream, we can't fail to achieve our dreams."
I reach for my arm, gasping, trying not to pass out—that happened once, and I was punished accordingly.
"Yes and yes. But I can't be my own solicitor. Anyway, as our solicitor, Angus was informed by B.A.I.R.N.s, as a matter of protocol, that our marriage vow was nullified. I explained to him that we're still married, we simply wanted to get rid of the vow. He seemed perplexed, but I pay him enough to pretend to be tolerant of my whims." Draco sighed. "But the bad news is—this requires that we adjust the terms of my will and our trust, and that requires the signature of our executor."
Draco waved his hand in the air. "That's irrelevant; you know Malfoys only ever have one male heir." Harry hadn't known that. "I don't even want to know what disturbing blood magic my ancestors used to accomplish that." He inclined his neck and frowned, meeting Harry's eye. "Thank Merlin Aster doesn't have any of that nonsense running through her veins."
Draco's hair was back to its usual length today, but he still had the beard. And he was wearing a short skirt again. This time it was a brown corduroy.
“Are you going to keep wearing skirts to work?” Harry asked with interest as he sat on the sofa to unlace his trainers.
"Oh my god," Harry said, pointing at him. "The quiche! Do you not eat muffins? Are you on the Atkins diet?!" Harry cackled, bracing himself on the doorframe to stay upright.
Harry snorted, staring at  Draco and wondering what that had to do with anything.  "Yes, I seem to remember stock in the
For some reason, Harry does. He hated seeing Draco with sad eyes and too-pale-even-for-him skin, with shuddering agony on the Astronomy Tower, with horrified fear while being made to torture. Harry hated it, even then. Draco isn't supposed to be like that. He's supposed to be holding court about making Harry's life a living hell, or about escalators, as the case may be.
Harry half-listened to Nico and Scorpius discussing hacking, a concept that he had only the most tenuous understanding of, and served himself a second bread roll. Draco, sitting on his right, caught his eye and gave him A Look. Harry tried to convey
"I'm serious!" Harry insists, wondering why he's so vehemently arguing for his own ill fate. "I am undateable!"
"I wish you weren't a member of the Orphan Club. It's a shitty club. But I promise I'll always be here to understand, okay? You're going to have it
He wore a red embroidered kurta and matching churidar. Parvati and Lavender had dressed him (with Draco's help), and Parvati had calmed Harry's reservations about wearing traditional Indian clothes—he didn't feel
There had been a case a few months back in which a magical law enforcement officer named Dimitri York had detained a woman named Asmaa el-Sabir for "suspicious spellwork," at which point he had checked her wand. The spell she had just cast was a Vision Clarity spell taught to young magical people in schools in the Middle East, which, though unfamiliar to York, was perfectly benign. The Priori Incantatem, however, had also shown evidence that the woman had cast a spell to hide her magical signature while buying restricted potions ingredients—a punishable offense. El-Sabir had argued that the evidence couldn't be used against her because it had been obtained through racial profiling. Memory evidence from Magical Law Enforcement Officer York had suggested that his detention of el-Sabir was motivated by her "foreign" appearance and her "non-traditional" spell. The Wizengamot Ethics Committee agreed that the Priori Incantatem evidence needed to be thrown out, having been obtained unlawfully.
Ginny laughs harder, hand coming up to her mouth, and she stands. "I'm—I'm sorry, Harry. I—" She's still laughing, with tears in her eyes that are clearly not mirthful. "I'll be okay. It's totally fine that you are hooking up with blokes after splitting with me. Totally fine. I'll be okay. You can just—you can go fuck Malfoy. Have at it. I certainly don't want him. You hereby have my permission to fuck any Death Eater who catches your fancy. I'm just going to—" She points vaguely at the house. "I'm sorry. I am not reacting properly to this. Maybe now we're even for you acting like a shithead when you found out about the abortion." She stops, thinks, bursts into a cackle again. "Actually no, definitely not even. Perhaps you're even more indebted to me now, in the cosmic balance. I'm just going to go. Inside. We can talk again soon. I'm sure it won't be at all awkward."
. "The best part is that we are home and don't have to lose any sleep caring for her. And then we can go tomorrow and see her during waking hours, and then we can come back home and sleep tomorrow night."
"Don't wait for me to like, encourage you," Draco breathed. "Just fucking—harder—just—I want you to—"
"We thought," Albus said, looking up, a bit dazed, "that if she was going to have the baggage of a surname like Potter-Malfoy, we might as well go all in and have you two arguing forever about which family she was named for."
Harry turned his head, at once expecting and shocked to find Malfoy laying next to him in the hot sand. Malfoy looked gorgeous, Harry thought, though he also looked completely ridiculous because his skin was so pale it nearly got lost in the sea of sand.
That thought only lasted a moment, because his second thought was about yesterday's election. Rump had
But Harry wouldn't take his outrage out on this barista, working a food service job. He reached back into his pocket to pull out a Galleon, then moved to the side to wait for his drink.
It's disconcerting, to be here with him. After months in this house, questioning every decision I've ever made, living in constant fear—now I'm here with the person who has made all the right choices. And he has no reason to believe that I don't want him dead. Even if I did just kind of save his life.
"I'm sorry, Dad," Albus put in, his face pale, "but as much as I don't want to hear the answer, you're going to have to answer James's question, because my brain is going 'does not compute, does not compute'."
Harry's tone is pure sarcasm, but Malfoy just smirks and says, "If the options are me or Ginny Weasley?" He holds his hand out to the side, as if he's just solved a complicated mathematical proof. "Q.E.D."
On top of all that, it had caused the Magical Civil Liberties Union to publicly attack the list of restricted potions ingredients, arguing that the list was skewed to disallow ingredients thought to be dangerous by Western standards with no regard to how those ingredients were used in other cultures. The ingredient el-Sabir had bought (jimsonweed) was illegal in Magical Britain, but it was an ingredient in important Arabic magical rituals.
"We need two lists," Draco said, ignoring Harry. "One for the foreign magic ban and one for the ICW slash Triple M."
There was a strange look on Draco's face that Harry didn't think was because of his upsidedownness. He looked—sad.
Draco strode in and flopped elegantly in one of the armchairs in front of Harry's desk, his robes billowing around him. "How about, 'Can I offer you a drink'?"
“Excuse me,” Draco drawled, a dangerous edge to his tone. “Are you suggesting that you would blame someone for having an appearance that others find distracting? Because that seems sexist, homophobic, and transphobic, and is probably a bunch of other -phobics, too.”
Harry sits in an armchair and nestles Teddy snugly against his chest, cradling him with this left arm and using his other hand to stroke his downy hair. "Hey there, Ted-o."
? What kind of thing is that to say? But when he meets Malfoy's eye—wanting to take the piss—he sees clear dismissal. Malfoy is telling him to get lost.
For approximately half a minute, Draco allowed himself to freak out. He buried his head in his hands, closed his eyes, and gave his mind the freedom to think whatever it wanted to think, which, in this case, was the thought equivalent of a string of about a hundred exclamation marks.
"Do you think we'll hear them coming?" Potter grimaces, looking at the stairs. "I don't really want to hide there for hours."
Draco hummed thoughtfully. "Between us, we probably have enough kids—and, in your case, niblings—to talk about all the issues of the day only by discussing our personal lives."
Draco had fallen into this role seamlessly. They always knew what the other was thinking, and a split second of eye contact was all that was needed to assure Harry that
Harry whirls around, watching in disbelief as Draco walks to the kitchen and takes out glasses and soda cans. "What? No! I can't—fuck. I have to go."
Harry leans forward, wrapping her in a hug, and they're both crying. "In another life," he says, "it would've been a fantastic person. We would've been an incredible family."
, objectively. But it felt like a guest room, and this was supposed to be his home. He'd somehow got used to sleeping in the master suite, where things felt lived in and un-lonely.
"How dare you," Draco says, in full outrage, dropping on top of Harry but holding himself up on his arms, out of Harry's reach.
Parvati's mauve lips turned down. "Then why are we here? This is a professional call, correct? Not that I would say no to a social call, of course."
Malfoy nods as if he knew this all along. "Exactly. See? So be grateful, Potter. You can find someone better."
Rump had recently removed all regulation on disposal of potions, which meant that there was now a burgeoning issue of magical contamination in the environment—dangerous for magical people, downright lethal to Muggles. Potions companies claimed they were being responsible about disposal, but some undercover journalists had discovered that they were merely transporting the potions waste to random places before dumping. It was, of course, illegal to Vanish potions, which was why disposal was such an issue and required regulation. Ideally, spoiled or excess potions would be collected and brought to the Unspeakables to be broken down into their constituent elements. Rump claimed this was too expensive for the companies that owned the potions and said they would be able to pursue responsible disposal without governmental intervention. This was, patently, hogwash.
Albus sent a message on his phone and they stood up, Scorpius giving hugs to Draco and Harry and Albus talking a mile a minute about when they'd next see each other. Then they stepped into the Floo and swirled away.
“No, today we’re here to discuss strategies to interrupt the path of negative, unhelpful thoughts,” Penelope continued before they could object further. “You are both smart people—”
"It's about the party we talked about having in a few weeks. You know, the party to celebrate our new flat?"
Harry’d convinced the others that this type of campaign was worthless if it didn’t allow each person to express their own truth. Harry’s truth wasn’t makeup or skirts or beards.
I can't deny it, can I? "Sure. You hated me, too." I scrunch my nose. "Not sure about the tense, there. You probably still hate me."
Harry snorted, opening his eyes to find Wilhelm peering curiously at him. "This ensemble is probably going to get me sacked today, Wil." He looked around the office. "Shit. They probably won't even let me come back in here after. Jorgen!"
"I'm not alone," Harry says, though he's not sure that's the point it makes most sense to defend. "Hermione's here somewhere. And trust me, my life is
"Sometimes I wonder." She sighs. "I don't know. I worry about how we can move on. But I don't want us to hide here, like this is the tent and the rest of the world is Snatchers."
lying. We've made a decision to live together and to be married for a period of time. What difference do our motives make to them?"
Since I felt better we continued having an in-depth conversation and learned a lot about one another. "Do you want to just stay here for the night?" I offered, I wasn't going to make Draco walk back to his uncle so late. To my absolute surprise, he nodded.
He walked up shyly and slowly, Remus smilied at him, givien him his wrapped gift and helping him out of the Hall an into his Palace. I dissmided the rest, they could have their dreams crushed and sent home. I have the four I want.
It was cold but dry. Something Draco would be forever thankful for; he could however think of much more comfortable ways to go about this.  "My Lord?" He asked softly turning his head to face him, strapped to a table with his hands immobilised. The knife glistened in the firelight, instinctively Draco tried to move his hands.
This is simply a note explaining all the changes, along with the timeline I decided to arrange, All the changes/timeline construction happened in December 2020, if you're reading after December 29th 2020 then you can ignore this note as it won't apply, you can read on as usual.
I woke up to the feeling of someone looking at me, I opened my eyes and screamed. Trying to get away from the bony, elf-like creature that was looking at me, unblinking. Within seconds three people are in the room, as I'm huddled with the duvet, reciting very prayer I know, hoping that thing would go away. "Stephaine what's wrong?" my eyes snaped open "Is it gone?" I ask immediately, when I got a nod in return I actually looked at them, Lucius was tall with long blonde hair, wearing mostly black, the woman beside him has long wavy black hair that was tied back and was wearing a light green dress, while a boy, about my age, was standing between them, wearing a pale dress, with his hair obstructing part of his face, probably wondering who on earth I am. "Draco, stay with her, don't ask questions that are intrusive." Is what i heard Lucius say.
As soon as I leave into the gardens, the air assaults me and I'm thrown into childhood memories of running around freely without much of a care in the world. Shaking my head I look up and among the several trees, I notice a stone building in the distance. Rushing up a tower, I stare into the Black onyx that greets my vision. My palm grips the mossed brick of the old tower I'm in as I stare at my home; the deep, almost sparkling marble glistens as the sun rises against it, taking a breath I realise that no matter what I do, I can't run away from this place. I will always have to return at some point, today is just one of those days.
"Well technically since my family's older you'd have to take my name, and either lose your name entirely or hyphen it." I paused and looked at him, did I want that? Did I honestly want that, to lose my entire identity, the only thing my parents ever gave me? I hadn't even registered that Draco had wrapped his arms around me.
Chapter five: August 9th > The first introduction of Bella and her enunch Alice as she tells her to spy on Daffodil (Narcissa) to get back at her and plan some sort of revenge on her sister and Lucius. Alice does as told but Daffodil finds her and shuts her in the basements before getting ready to leave.
Remind me to never say yes to going to a Ministry. The lifts are hot and stuffy, Draco looked like he was holding his breath; or breathing into his hand. Whatever he's doing I don't blame him, at all. We're here for a 'trip' by we I mean: Draco, me, Lucius, Narcissa, Bella, Tom and Severus. I was trapped between Draco and Bella, I am not enjoying the lift ride.
"Can you make a smaller one?" I ask he looks at me strangely expecting an explanation. I turn to the terrarium/snake tank "We're aren't the only ones who live here." Draco sighs nodding kissing my forehead. The snake is a gift from the Death Eaters; I can't tell it's breed but it's been around on of them for a while. But it's a nice pet and doesn't bite us, I asked Draco to say thank you multiple times, I don't know if he ever has.
I hadn't even said much about Granger yesterday only questioned something perfectly reasonable, they do so much worse. Oh great now I'm whining. Either way, nothing I tried worked, I was always roped into
That was the Draco Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter ended up dating after the war. The Draco who had achieved his goals, the Draco who had indeed continued on the Dark Lord's legacy, and the Draco who had paid dearly for everything.
Daffodil left Alice while she went upstairs and had a bath of her own, she wanted to see Draco, make sure that he was okay, and that everything was going well with Harry. Maybe the two boys were spending time together and she might join them if they were okay with her being there of course. She would hate to be somewhere where she wasn't welcomed or if the two didn't want her there. Lucius had gifted her something, that wasn't white but he had given her permission to wear it, while Lucius had lost a brother and a sister in law, but Draco had lost his parents, she would ask Draco if he was okay with her wearing it before she removed it from the box. She didn't want to bring up any memories for the young adult.
I could hear my father's voice from the door, smiling brightly to myself, I knocked on the old willow door, the sound of clothes turning made my breath halt "Enter." Came to a soft yet impatient command, I didn't like it one bit.
"Oh she bothers me, she won't leave me alone, she's had this wired thought that she'll be the next Lady Potter." I paused, what would happen to Potter line if I was to marry Draco? What would I be expected to do? I really don't like the idea of simply ignoring my family and their history.
It was clear that they weren't expecting Draco to run, jump and hug them around their necks at full speed but they welcomed it all the same "We also missed you Dragon." I smiled at the family as they end their group hug "Now what happened to you, Draco?" His mother asked I opened my mouth to answer her, but Draco beat me to it "We were in the Great Hall, and I cut my cheek by accident, as Harry's Head of House was yelling his name because Harry zoned out while Headmaster Dumbledore was making his announcements ." I just shut my mouth and sat still. His mother sighed reviled for Draco's safety "Oh well thank Merlin you're both alright, Draco are you sure your okay?" He nodded to his father,"Harry hasn't done anything to hurt me." I smiled at his stubborn child-like voice as he sat back on my lap,
"I think you should listen to my grandmother, Marcus Banks." Do I have to explain? I think I just found my new favourite male adult that isn't my father. This dark-haired man knew how to use his voice well, to threaten although he doesn't seem like the dangerous type, maybe he's territorial over what's his?
The Dark Lord knew how to force Draco to get better, it wasn't through threats of murder. How do you force dependence out of someone? By taking away what they are dependent on.
"Draco, I care about you a lot, I won't stop because of anything, but you and your friends said really hurt Hermione, according to Ron and Ginny, I know that you're better than that, by the way, Professor Snape told me what it meant."
I didn't want to leave their side, knowing that this might be the last time I'll ever see them again. Why hasn't a vaccination been produced yet? Why is life so cruel as to take away those we most love? Why can't we live in a world of happiness and joy! I held my mother's hand, her sweet voice doing little to soothe me, although that is my fault, not hers. I can't calm down, even when I desperately want to. Something won't let me, gripping excruciating pain in my chest.
She didn't care. Everyone here was below her, they should bow till their knees ache and throw themselves to the floor for her. Not just her husband. She would rule them once her husband died, then the100 days of mourning would be worth the white clothes, which she only used for minimal tasks regardless. Her beauty was suffering from this stupid thing, her arms and legs looked like an animal, she was always shaved, this was humiliation. For her no doubt!  That boy and his uncle's plaything were getting on her nerves. If it were up to her, she would have dealt with them all personally. She didn't care that the fancy toy was her sister; all she was good for was being on display naked for all to see, she got enough of a rush from it with Lucius.
I heard Hermione tell Draco that I most likely wasn't in the mood for a lot of talking, before letting him in and smiling as she went to prepare us some tea, lemon and ginger for me, as well as to make something for me to eat. I smiled up at Draco, my previous thoughts about him all forgotten, he kneeled by my chair, sitting on a cushion to rest his knees on. "How are you?" I know he meant well, I did, but I couldn't help but sigh, I didn't know how to respond.
After dinner and a bath, a shower for Draco, where he was given his extremely important privacy, we both settled into my bed, facing each other. I couldn't help but giggle, I had never slept next to someone in my entire memorable life, of course, I slept with my parents as a baby. Draco was smiling at me, almost protectively "You haven't done this before huh?"  I shook my head and he wrapped his arms around me.
"Yes it is, Harry, it's not well known and I myself hardly knew about it." I glanced at Lucius as he smiled up at the building along with his wife. We heard another car pull up behind us and out of the front.
"I want my aunt and uncle, life isn't fair, they know that they will be happy with their father." she rolled her eyes as I made a move to leave. They would be arriving within twenty minutes I want to be home for them.
We aren't supposed to leave, one of the concubine's mother was sick all the way in Scotland. The Emperor denied her leaving the city; she was only two ranks below me. She soon died a few months ago. The last time the concubine saw her mother was three years ago when she arrived here. I recently received news that my parents fell ill with Dragon Pox; it took a little pleading for me to be allowed to return home for a few months tomorrow. Father's friend offered to travel with me, I politely declined. I think he's trying too hard.
But I saw a female girl with long brown hair, with bright honey brown eyes, wearing a fnaf themed green shirt and black trousers  watching them while ironing clothes "She's my maid, you can ask her as many questions as you want about now." We heard a soft thud, turning around I saw that one of the children had hit the nose of the bear it was on, I don't think I've seen Draco, run to anyone so quickly.
I smiled to myself and played with his long soft hair as his parents looked at each other before asking "Harry, we know our son, and we need to know, will you hurt him?" I tilted my head "How so?" I asked, his mother continued for Lucius "We know you'd never hurt him physically, there was a reason we asked him to stay close to you after all, but we meant emotionally, we know he won't do the same to do, at leat knowingly." They really care about their son "I won't I promise." They smiled and Draco woke up "Do you have to leave?" He pleaded they seemed to stop and sit next to him (Well us really) "Dragon, look if we wish we could stay, but we- well I can't, your mother can try but I can't." Draco's father said cupping Draco's cheek, looking at his crestfallen face, it was then that I realised just how much he loves them, he wants to stay with them and they want to stay with him, clearly. Gently I let go of him but held his hand.
He smiled and told me to sit down, I did I nearly fell into the chair, "Sorry, doctor" I mumbled after he helped me sit down "Don't be, Draco does the same thing." The talk was about me being there and my role as a maid, which soon went on to my going to school "Which school did you go, exactly Stephine?" I closed my eyes as I prepared the same thing I say everything I get asked this, taking a deep breath.
I was being gently shaken awake by my mother and father, both looking worriedly down at me. I smiled weakly at them.
"She'd be a second Ron." I looked up to see who said that, with Draco immediately grabbed my arm, in something like fear.
Apparently, I'd taken longer than I should have done, as when I came into mine and Draco's dormitory, he was curled into a tight ball, bleeding with a piece of something over his eyes. "Please let it be over, please let them have left, please." Gently I sat on the bed, "Draco, it's me Harry, you're safe." I said brushing back his hair, that seemed to have blood running through it.
"Are you alright? Draco?" She asked, holding out her hand, Draco moved his away, other Slytherins were still, and silent waiting to interfere if needed. "...I.." No sound came out of his mouth, he closed it and looked down, the older year stood up and walked around to stand next to Draco, "Draco, are you alright?" He flinched and looked up at her, "Draco?" She softly placed a hand over his, and did something to his magic, sighing he lifted up his head "Draco, you can't keep doing it, what he did was unforgivable, now please answer my question, are you alright?" He shook his head, and his hair covered his eyes.
"Harry, of course, you can, just make sure Draco comes with you." I nodded, waiting for Draco to come out so that we could go down to dinner together, as I still didn't really know where everything is.
"Do you want me to leave then?" I shook my head, he didn't have to leave, especially if he had wanted to tell me something. "I came by just to ask if you were okay, and to apologise about this morning." That had me confused, why would he apologise for something that wasn't his fault? "I never intended to have everyone look at you like that." Why was this even Draco's fault?  I didn't have the willpower to continue our conversation, so just gave Draco a look and shook my head, changing how I was sat down. Draco felt happy enough to sit in near silence occasionally saying something or thinking out loud, I felt much more at ease and happy with his situation and Draco was happy to accommodate this perfectly.
Nevertheless, Harry Potter loved Draco with all his heart, they spent every waking moment with eachother. They could communicate by one language. Parsletonge. Afteral, who needs a tongue to hiss? Within a year they had announced a wedding date. The world seemed at peace with Voldemort's ideas at play but adapted to not be synonymous with genocide.
he looked up as I untied the ripped clothing and didn't attempt to sit up "Draco, I'm so sorry, if I hadn't taken so long-" He smiled softly at me "Harry, I know they would have been nothing you could have done, but watch, they made Pansy and Blaise watch when they tried, but they could have done worse.". I carefully picked him up and wrapped him in my cloak and he hissed in pain, I gently rubbed his back "Come on I'll carry you to the train okay?" Draco nodded, he wrists, ankles and neck red and bruised.
"Why didn't you say thank you?" I turned my head towards Harry, he looked confused, I smiled and ran a hand through his hair. He still had a lot to learn about how we live, and I also apparently had to do the same with Harry.
"What brought that on?" I looked at him, blinking I wanted to tell him everything, tell him how worried and broken I felt, how destroyed he made me feel at breakfast. But he was a child, he wouldn't understand, saying things like that is normal for him, for them. I was honestly sorry for what I said, I knew it was wrong, but that's children do, they bully, they break each other, they hate each other, they are the perfect example of tyranny.
"Harry, I didn't mean to do what I did, but I've been acting, towards you, and everyone else." I paused as I realised what I had done. I stepped back and gulped, I hadn't meant to interrupt him.
"Harry?" I ask out loud as our dormitory door opens, I don't mean to sound hopeful, but he's the only person it could be, no one else can enter unless it's Professor Snape. The door opened slowly as if offended that I had dared to assume who was behind it. I bit lip, yelling at myself for being so foolish, stupid and even believing that he might care.
"Do I look alright? Harry, I'm fine, It's just numb with pain." Draco said stroking my hair, I looked at him, his eyes scanned my face, in the sunlight I could see a glaze to them, a shattered glaze, but one nonetheless.
This made her look away and huff "I'm starting to see why Draco hates you so much." At that, my head shakes, oh she has no idea why the blonde child dislikes me, to be honest, I don't either but I have an inkling of a guess. "Regardless I might just do that and absolutely not, nothing is wrong with me."  Now I never said that, how dare she twist my words.
Our carriages stopped by a village. For breakfast we were told, Susan and Regulus the two eunuchs that joined us had no idea of what just happened as they knocked on our door, although for Regulus it wouldn't have been hard to guess. The Village had a temple and that's where we would be eating this morning and of course taking our prayers. Seeing Daffodil made me smiled and I immediately hugged her as she and my uncle shared a kiss, "How are you felling Draco?" She asked me, kneeling expertly to be eye level with me. Her delicate hand ran through my hair and tucked a blonde lock behind my ear. I felt like shrugging, or combusting into tears and begging to go back.
I opened my eyes to see myself beside my parents tucked closely into my mother's arms, I shuffled slightly before falling asleep again.
"On the assumption that you've been told about the ritual we did on Draco, it wears off in the Manor, it only works outside the Manor and our friends House, or family estates, would you be okay with that?" I thought about it
Our peaceful rest was interrupted by Pansy running in and shaking us both awake. We sat up and rubbed our eyes open and Draco sat on my lap, tugging down his shirt as he looks up at Pansy through his eyelashes "Blaise is in the Hospital Wing, I was in my dormitory and went down to the common room to see Blaise on the floor with his pyjama cut and  tied around his mouth and around his hands and feet."  We had never run so quickly in our lives.
"Alice?" She called out, snappily once her water was cold. She wanted to be warmer, her servent would do anything she asked of the near-insane girl. Absolutely everything. Which gave her an idea, she would send Alice to spy on her sister, get poor Daffodil publicly killed and then watch as she regained power within her City.
The knocking on my door to say that someone was waiting outside to see me was not expected, after all, it was a Saturday morning, who would want to speak to me so early? Or just speak to me at all, I knew that I was probably the second most disliked person here other than the Emperess. The knock was too feminine to be Lucius and it was much too soft to be Tom. I let them in and sent my eunuch away to make some tea or something. Of course, it would be her, her long, elegant plunging dressing, ivory in colour. She swept across to room to greet me, her tail of lace and slim followed behind her. I would have thought her feet bear, although it wasn't a stretch, as the pathways are clear of dirt and mud. Although it wasn't her dress, shoes, or anything about her physical appearance, even if she was fit to be a goddess, that caught my attention. It was the way she spoke. As if desperate for my help and assistance. It wasn't a tone she regularly used.
Instead of doing either of those things I nuzzled into her and fiddled with the embodiments on her dress. "I don't know, I'm scared I guess." Naturally, these weren't words we were allowed to say and or emotions we were allowed to feel. She hugged me close and placed a kiss to my brow.
Our teacher had left us halfway through the double to check something in his quarters, he still hasn't returned. Through this, I had learned that each class had a head, a selected student that would 'head' the class in the case of the Professor's temporary absence during class time. The class had ended up talking about the old Potions Master/Chemistry Teacher, rumour had it that he could have rivalled Severus Snape and had won multiple awards for his work and skill. The teacher we had before, the cover, is his nephew and he had been raised in school by him. 'Eric Riddle."
"You have my vote," Harry said. "Now can you get out so I can finish this pile of work and maybe get home before tomorrow is today?"
Harry decided to take his word for it. "My work is good. Hermione and I are partners and we enjoy the work and complement each other well. By that I mostly mean that she gets off on perfectly filled-out paperwork, so I don't have to do it."
A moment later, the tall double doors adorned with the stylised M of the Ministry flew open, revealing Rump. He radiated impatience, intolerance, and a pathological lack of care for his fellow humans.
Harry only just stopped himself from laughing. “Would you like me to ask him to stop? How long has he been at it?”
"Don't answer that," Harry said, more for James's benefit than Draco's. "Alright, Jamie, sorry I questioned your finances. So when can I see it?"
"Oh for the love of," Harry mutters, trying not to find it funny, trying not to be a person who is charmed by Draco's antics. He fails miserably, and ends up pushing Draco out of the way as he goes back to chopping vegetables.
Draco stretched. "Maybe we could find some sort of harmless magical ritual that requires love—that we could use to make a point that this is something that needs studying. A ritual that picks up magical energy as more and more people snog. There's probably something in books on traditional Beltanes..."
Harry scanned the paper. Tomorrow, in front of their children, families, and close friends, they'd be married. Today, he would find solace in chatter about Rump's assholery. "Not a big deal. I told them to forward every notice to Rump's office and otherwise ignore them. How long until I get sacked?"
I hate that he has that effect on me, so I start babbling again. "What do you think Granger and Weasley are doing now? They're not foolhardy enough to try to come back, are they?"
Draco leaned back in his chair and sighed. "I never wanted to get married again. I never wanted to get married to you for love. It wasn't…a thing I wanted. Getting married was a thing I did because it served a purpose, which didn't bother me. You know, Slytherin cunning and all."
How had he forgotten? There was healthy non-attachment to politics and then there was neglect of the nation. Was Draco so love struck as to have forgotten his own priorities? That would make a great campaign slogan:
he did was new. Almost every day, unavoidably, he was a new person, being asked to do new things, having new experiences. Now, though, his life's momentum was a comfortable, deep rut, stretching out before him in sameness. Doing new things, making hard choices, required dragging himself out of a deep trench.
Harry's back was to him—muscles flexing under his t-shirt as he washed the breakfast dishes. "You okay?"
an echo of Dobby's voice sounded in Harry's head. Harry pressed his forehead into his hands and took a deep breath. He didn't much feel like a great wizard these days. He felt lonely despite all his friends, untethered despite his job and house and responsibilities, unfulfilled despite all he'd accomplished. And somehow, he was fixated on Draco Malfoy, as if it were 1996 instead of 2006.
“Thanks for coming," Penelope said with a smile. "Today we're going to brew the Draught of Pure Imagination.”
Author's Note, 23 January 2021: I had so much fun writing this chapter during some tumultuous real-world political feels. I wrote Harry's meeting with Rump the day after the insurrection at the US Capitol, but as I post now, the US has a new president. My political hopes are grounded in the reality of the continued struggle, but it feels good to be posting this from a world in which one of the Rumps has been kicked out.
, like the blood pumping through Harry's body, the sweat prickling against their skin, the feeling of skin against skin.
Aha, here’s the place where the magical identity established by Draco’s DNA matter is used to determine desire. And,
"Dad," Albus said when Draco'd finished reviewing the effect of Fortunade Lestrange's elopement on the Goblin Rebellion of 1752, "stop working and come watch with us. The only way we'll get through this is by making fun of Rump as a community."
Malfoy turns to look at him fully with a scathing glare. "No, Potter, I didn't take N.E.W.T.s in the middle of a war in between sessions of torturing and being tortured."
She shrugged, smiling. "Friends help each other move. It's like the first line on the friend contract." She pulled away and looked around. "It's so empty."
Draco pulled away, leaving Harry flushed and out of breath. “I’m not going to keep wearing skirts to work. It’s comfortable and whatever, but it’s not my thing. I mean, I don’t particularly like the macho aesthetic, but I can subvert it plenty without wearing skirts. Does that disappoint you?”
"Because I've been so involved with Aster and helping out Albus and Scorp." Harry paused to spit into the sink. "I mean, they don't deserve less of my attention just because they don't have a baby."
Draco thought Harry was going to shout—he usually shouted when he was upset. But this time Harry sighed. "Yeah. Same here, I guess. I drove Ron and Hermione bonkers—they thought I was obsessed with you. I was convinced you were up to no good. Which, to be fair, you were."
"It's true, isn't it? Curse-breakers usually work alone, even though it's really dangerous. Or do you not know what a lone ranger is? It was originally some kinda Muggle show, I think."
Harry’s good mood deflated. “Well, let’s see. Smacked me around a little and locked me in my cupboard. But not until after they bought my cousin a giant ice cream and wouldn’t buy me any.”
James, ever the shit-stirrer, propped his chin in his hand and looked raptly between Harry and Albus as he sucked on a candy cane.
Harry decides that he's only going to sing along to the line "Am I sexual?", which he takes to doing with exuberance only to find himself the target of a Stinging Hex from Draco.
“Go ahead, go ahead,” Draco said in the tone of voice one might use when showing off an item one had made.
"Oh come on, according to those books you love, interns and students and beseeching public figures are always fucking powerful people in their offices."
"Father," I say, trying to buy Potter a moment to Apparate the fuck out of here. But the rat is racing toward my father, and he slashes his wand, cutting a slice down the rat's cheek.
“I can’t even force myself to go outside and play Quidditch because I just want to sleep all day,” Harry said. He’d assumed she was suggesting that he, not Malfoy, was the one who could hypothetically overhaul the Ministry. Perhaps that was an unfair assumption.
Draco joined them, Levitating three glasses. "A well-deserved break. She worked herself to the bone."
Harry smiled, feeling a sense of relief at having this in the capable hands of Parvati and Lavender. "Fantastic!"
“Spent a lot of time staring at my arse that day?” Harry asked, then internally kicked himself because shouldn’t he be preening at that rather than taking the piss?
Harry stared at the book, alternating between blank staring and wondering why Penelope was forcing them to go through this ridiculous exercise.
"How people end up having so many kids." Draco let his head fall back. "That feeling could get addictive."
Draco was really getting agitated now, and Harry couldn't stop his laughter. "Look, Draco, if I'm completely honest, I haven't had sex outside of a relationship….ever. Wait no, once, which confirmed that I'm not interested in it. I'm old. I know how to deal with my libido. I can…what did you say?…attend to my genitals on my own."
Harry closed his eyes. They wanted to get this in the papers. They wanted their beards and legs and makeup on the front page of the Prophet, blinking up at magical people from breakfast tables all over England. Harry thought they were bonkers—admirably bonkers, but bonkers all the same. He could admire their commitment, but also… “There’s no way I’m wearing a skirt in the Prophet.”
think he was the worst possible human, and yet he somehow continuously proves himself to be even worse than I'd already thought."
Harry steps closer. “Oh, but you do. I was sure that when I took the potion, I’d look, like, thirty-five. Remember? When my beard first started to go grey and I was going to the gym a lot because everyone was doing wizard CrossFit back then? George nearly busted a spleen laughing when I ended up looking like this. He was calling me
“I guess,” Harry said, uncomfortable with this whole thing. “Why can’t I just play it by ear? See how I feel then.”
Harry’s fanciful imagining is closer to reality than Draco would like to admit. Allergy Elixir had been a constant in his childhood, and he resents Harry’s implications about allergy-sufferers.
"My parents—" Harry looks pointedly at the ceiling, refusing to look anywhere near Draco. "—they got pregnant with me at nineteen. They could've...got rid of me."
"With you, you prat," Harry laughed, then leaned in and Draco was lost in the intensity of Harry's kisses, Harry's fingers, and the recently issued challenge to break his personal best in fellatio.
Harry didn’t say that he had only ever heard it from around the corner of whatever room Dudley was in when it played. Harry’d enjoyed Dudley’s similarity to the various non-Charlie children, even if he couldn’t see the screen.
After a minute, he stood and walked into the house. Everyone was in the kitchen. Fleur had Dominique in a sling that magically adjusted to hold the baby in whatever position was needed (currently, the baby was breastfeeding), Victoire was at the table with crayons showing Teddy her drawing, and Bill was buttering toast triangles for the kids.
Under the text was a photo that Harry seemed to have taken by propping the phone at his shoulder and aiming down—it showed his body stretched out on the sofa, Aster asleep on his chest. Her little mouth hung open, a drop of drool suspended at the place where her lips met her plump cheek.
So what were they hashing out, anyway? "I guess we just need to agree that, if this changes, we'll discuss it. When it, er, comes up."
For a few seconds, neither of them moves. The silence of the room echoes, a stark contrast to the lurid music of the club and the blood-thumping-kissing-haze of the sex. When Harry finally pulls his hand away, looking idly for his wand so he can clean up the mess, Malfoy murmurs in a voice that sounds—but can't really be?—reverent, "We're not dead."
for wearing a pair of trainers I’ve worn to work every day for years.” Harry leaned forward on his arms, and the pub table stuck unpleasantly to his skin.
I look at him the way you look at Draco? I don't know. Maybe I should get someone to record me so I can look at my face."
“We should imagine how we could make this year better,” Malfoy said, looking out over the lake, where the Giant Squid had just broken the surface, casting ripples. “Imagine these Serotonin Potions and all this cognitive-behavioural therapy help us.”
Harry hummed as if in agreement. Neither of them mentioned, though both of them knew, that Draco had never managed to accept or believe that advice, and neither had Harry, when his own therapist had told him the same thing.
that, in our current society, in which we believe that myth and give it power, gender does make a difference. Sexual assault is a gendered issue, even if it need not be."
“I’m not going to get addicted to any potions,” Harry said, then wondered how his life had ended up with him here, alive, but needing to declare that he wasn’t going to develop a potions habit.
“You look good in booty shorts,” Draco retorted. “Doesn’t mean I want to see your arse in the office.”
to turn off the light on his side of the bed. “Hey,” he said, “did you have a chance to write down what we wanted to ask Bill? I can send the owl tomorrow. About the Triple M, I mean.”
"You two are insufferable!" James shouted joyfully. "That was like watching one person reflected in a mirror!"
Harry's never wanted to have sex with Malfoy, but now that he's doing it—wet tongues, grasping fingers, cocks pressed tightly together in the circle of Malfoy's fingers—he keeps thinking of the old Muggle saying, "Make Love Not War." Maybe this is how they move on, how they start the rest of their lives. Maybe this is like a commencement ceremony, a ritual to symbolise the break, the start of the rest of their lives, lives not dictated by war and hate and the whims of a man named Tom. The rest of their lives—all their lives, everyone's lives—can be a swirl of contentment, and pleasure, and life—vivid, vital
Harry should've known his kids would take the news of a wedding in stride. They'd been a part of so many weddings. Ginny's, Andromeda's, Victoire's, Louis's, George's, Molly and Arthur's 50th anniversary renewal, Albus and Scorpius's, Rose's fuck-the-patriarchy non-marriage commitment ceremony ("just because I don't want to be called a 'wife' doesn't mean I don't want cake"), George's second marriage, Ron and Hermione's re-marriage after their year of separation—
Aster reached for the phone with a wet hand. Harry moved the phone out of her range and pretended to munch on her fingers instead. She curled her fingers into his cheek, and his heart clenched with an expansive, overwhelming sort of love.
"You didn't tell me you were late," Harry says, wincing when he realises it sounds like he's blaming her.
"No. I just—you know, I sometimes just don't want to do stuff. It wasn't because it was Malfoy. At least, not mostly."
"Keep the queue moving," a voice drawled from behind Harry, and he realised that he'd lagged behind pretentious Blue-Lens at the same moment he realised that the voice behind him belonged to no other than Draco Malfoy.
"Here's how it works," Scorpius said. "I ask a question that starts with 'who…', and to answer, you raise that person's shoe."
Penelope sat across from them, acting for all the world as if she were unaware of the history between them, which was impossible, because she’d been talking to both of them weekly for a few months and she knew that Malfoy had fought, what Malfoy had been, what Malfoy had done in the war.
It's strange—Potter is everywhere. My entire being is eclipsed by him, and it's making me dangerously likely to dredge up memories of him that I don't want to share. I recite the ingredients of Wiggenweld Potion, giving my consciousness something to do. It won't keep him from seeing any memories, but it will, hopefully, prevent me from handing them to him.
. Harry stands there, frozen, for a minute, until someone knocks into his back and pushes him forward a few inches. Harry is drunk enough to decide it's a good idea to walk over. "Malfoy."
Harry doesn't have a job or and he doesn't know what he wants to do. He has no idea what to do with himself; he only knows he can't go back to Hogwarts. It's like the final year of the war was a turning point in his life—he's not a kid anymore. He can't go back.
Malfoy's eyes dropped to Harry's lips, then flew back to Harry's eyes like he shouldn't have allowed himself to look there.
"Of course, Jorg," Harry said, grinning like a cheshire cat. "Thank you!" He turned to Draco, ready to run to the lift, but Draco was searching through his suit pockets.
No sooner had Draco shaken their hands than the two of them were gathering their things and muttering excitedly to each other. "We'll need to check the poll numbers—the data from the Smithwick elopement—the effect on the queer movement—voter mobilisation—"
It was Hermione who eventually quieted the group, using a Charm that sounded like an air horn. Everyone stopped talking, looking to her with eagerness. As much as these people were all independent personalities, they also loved the structure of a clear leader.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and Harry winced, remembering that he’d won that phial Malfoy had wanted. For reasons he wouldn’t allow himself to consider right now.
“Thank you,” James said, looking genuinely grateful. “And yes—it’ll be super convenient. I can even get my morning run in by running to work! I’ll start looking for a flat soon, I promise.”
"It's a great idea, Al," Harry said, smiling. "I never would've thought of that. This is why we need intergenerational protest. The problem is, that kind of protest can't be tied to this family. With my position and Draco's position…it would be a disaster."
"I think maybe I always have been," Harry said, his grin morphing into a sad frown. "Only I didn't realise that in time to choose a career path that wasn't deeply entrenched in hierarchical power structures."
Draco knew better than most that the "right decision" was often calibrated as though to tear one's heart in two. He remembered—in startling vividness—making wrong decisions
"What, like he just stood up and left the table without saying a word?" Hermione asked. "That is odd."
"We're not joking, Lils." Harry hated lying to his kids. But he and Draco really were going to get married; was it even a lie at this point? "It's serious."
"Lorraine's labour does not change the fact of your behavior!" Scorpius insisted, and Pansy's voice shouted something out.
"Apparently there's a notion in some pure-blood circles that a Crucio is an appropriate treatment for a panic attack."
Potter uses a Sticking Charm to attach it to the ceiling. We need to hang it quite close to the wall, or it won't blend in. Which means there's not much space for us to squeeze behind it.
Draco reaches around to pull Harry into a one-armed hug as Hermione consults the book to figure out how to stop the flames. She whispers an incantation and the flames stop, leaving the cauldron still and empty on the counter. It's shockingly dull and quiet in its wake.
"Well, I do," Penelope said. "I’m a person. I need imagination, too, even if my goals are different from yours. Imagination is important, Draco, even if you need to temper it with realism. None of us know what the world is going to be like, now, after the war. Maybe things will be different. Surely there are things that are impossible, but many things are possible. Many future paths are available to each of you."
Of course, Harry had to ask it as a question. Of course, the Veritaserum made Draco answer. He looked at his hands; the truth serum, at least, couldn't compel eye contact. "I don't deserve happiness. I don't deserve to be with you."
"Maybe when we turn 60," Harry mused, "we'll finally be over our different flavours of childhood neglect."
Draco looked at his hands, trying to figure out how to wrap this up. He'd told too much. This had to be enough for them to understand. They could understand, even if they were hurt. Maybe.
And it's better if we discuss it now, when it's theoretical, rather than later, when it's…imminent."
Draco's mouth tightened, a tiny bit of butterbeer foam on his lip. "Too right. I don't like it, but I don't think we can tell anyone. Not even our kids." He sighed. "Because if we tell just our kids, that's four people, plus two partners of James or Lily's, plus Teddy because you'd feel guilty not treating him the same as your biological children, that's seven, plus if Teddy tells a partner that's eight."
Coming home used to be a boring, predictable thing. Say hello to Lorraine, dinner at 7, answer correspondence from his mother, text Scorpius, maybe invite a friend over for an after-dinner drink or dessert.
"Maybe for you!" Harry leaned forward. "I can't think of a more unsexy setting than a Ministry party. Getting it up while the Minister and all of my Aurors are in the next room is my idea of a nightmare."
Harry slumped backward, his face pale and tortured as he leaned against the sofa, and Aster stuck her thumb in her mouth and leaned her head comfortingly on Harry's chest.
kissing, because they were drunk and it was a stag do and their children were conniving foxes, and what choice did they really have? But fuck it was hot in this room, and Draco tugged him closer, their chests and hips bumping together, and all Harry could think was
"Who is it?" Molly pokes her head out of the kitchen. "Harry, darling! I haven't seen you in ages. Are you hungry?"
Harry frowned. “Er, no. You don’t have to answer.” He dug his fingers into the grass, picking at the blades. “Do you ever wonder if things could’ve gone differently?”
"I wish I could tell him it's an irrational fear, but…" Harry trailed off and looked around the restaurant, at the people on the street. "Did you request this table to be most visible? Is this part of your plan?"
"We don't live in that life," she says, face crumpled against Harry's jumper. "We're broken. We're broken, and it broke our relationship."
"Who says that's a parenting tactic!" Harry cried, disturbed that someone could see through it. His kids never did. They were always looking for an excuse to keep talking, to organise and clarify their own thoughts. They never wanted Harry's opinion; they wanted someone to help them realise their own.
Harry’s first thought (an unhelpful one, he was sure Penelope would say) was to roll his eyes and think how silly girls were for crying at fucking children’s films. But Harry ignored that impulse and just waited for her to continue.
Lucius held my hand to help me get down, I gladly jumped down into his arms, he lightly spun me around and kissed my cheek before placing me down on the floor. Daffodil smiled she shooed Reg and Susan off to walk towards us "How do you feel darling?" She asked, kneeling beside me again, gently running her hand through my hair, let me think about my answer and lean into her as Lucius kept a hand on my back treasure me that everything was okay. I ended up shrugging, licking my lips.
Lucius smiled at me as I collapsed onto our bed, hugging a pillow to my chest, looking up at his warm grey eyes. His hand runs through my hair, growing out although I don't intend to keep it that way, he fingers untangle any knots and I sigh happily. At least being alone with him is a good thing. Being alone with anyone but Severus is a good thing. It's even better mid-morning when we can do nothing but rest and stay in bed. This moment of peace is soon shortlived, as Susan comes in within a few minutes, apologising profusely over disrupting us. With a glance at Lucius, I shake my head and beckon them forward. They're more mine than his, but right now it doesn't matter. I take her hand and slowly rub circles into the back of it. "Now now, no need to fret and worry. You did nothing wrong." Still, she seems to shake but nods, being conditioned that disagreeing will be met with pain.
The Dark Lord wanted Draco to be one of the best wizards to ever live, he wanted Draco to continue on his legacy. To make sure that Draco would stand all he had in mind for a teen, it was only fair to have Draco kill the beloved Headmaster. Yes it did particularly break the poor boy, but his determination to succeed was evident to the Dark Lord all the same.
Kissing the twins goodbye was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, leaving them with Severus for the next three hours only to leave Harry within two was painfully, but it has to be done. Damm Merlin and fate.
I woke up to find Draco playing with a small  glass dome, about 40cm in height, I sat up and realised he was flipping it upside down and opening it, "What are you doing?" He didn't seem to hear me, I waited and watched him, he was completely immersed in the dome.
I held his hand again and smiled. He smiled back and Dumbledore let us go to class,  although he told me that he would busy at break, so I shouldn't try to find him. I nodded and smiled sadly, I had wanted to spend time with him. I felt him grab my hand and brush away my hair "Harry, don't be upset please, I'd honestly rather you be with me, but that can't happen, besides you need to spend time with your friends, otherwise they'll claim I'm stealing you." I laughed and got out my things, ready for Charms.
"Would I really be this small?" I waited and I sat next to him He turned his head and smiled before answering "Harry when I die, this dome is what my parents want to put me in if I'm not married by then. It means that I can be completely glazed and fired in a Kiln and be an actual doll forevermore so they want to place me inside here, to have on display for anyone else who lives here."
"You think I mined, Malfoy? Draco, it doesn't matter, It felt calming and nostalgic."  That at least claimed Draco down and made him laugh as his mother came in running towards the bed
I wish I could hate them all. Most of them are not what I want, it's all fake. They all look like me, that's not good for any chance of an heir. But there is one who interests me. Dark hair, green eyes, and he keeps coughing and sits down a lot. I think he's sick, or at least, sickly. He's from Surrey and looks awfully undertreated. After a brief conversation with Lucius, Severus, Remus and Sirius (Perl, Obsidian, Amber and Ruby) They each chose someone, Remus and I chose the same person, Harry Potter.
"Harry, don't feel bad, honestly money is no problem for us, to us 36 galleons is nothing." I nodded but still looked sorry, he stroked my hair and smiled "Why don't we go buy your shoes while Draco places the clothes in the car and gets lunch for us, how does that sound." I smiled and nodded, taking hold of his sleeve.
He was about to walk out of the church when he rethought it "I am not going to risk taking you out there Stephaine,do you mind appreciation?" I shook my head and hid myself in his robe, as I felt the pull of being sucked through a tube, before breathing again, and evening out my breaths. I could hear someone, running "Are you alright? Who are you holding, Lucius?" I slowly poked my head out, from where I was hiding. "Um, Hello?" I said meekly, at the well dressed woman who's face showed nothing but worry.
I was hiding from the storm; hail, rain, wind, thunder, lighting, ice. I was so close to death going outside would be suicide, my friends couldn't help, we were just ten. I heard someone come in, probably to get away from the storm. They found me.
The sounds around were calming and the view was peaceful as it could get. We were oblivious to the world outside, the starving poor, the broken adults, the destroyed children having their dreams for the future ripped out of the hands, leaving life long scars and self-hatred. No, we were safe, protected and enclosed like babies. We didn't have to worry about anything here, everything was taking care of for us. From food to having clean water and air. If we had good enough families, we would know how lucky we are, I know that some people here don't know that.
It was soon afternoon, and I was sat in a chair reading, in the comfort of my chambers. I was left alone through the day, luckily. From what I had been told concubines were known to be ruthless and cutthroat depending on what they wanted. I was unsure if this was supposed to bring me comfort or fear, so I decided to take it as neither and let it simply be a statement. I wouldn't worry unless Remus or Sriuis said that I needed to, in which case I would follow what advice they give me. Although this currently wasn't no my mind, but rather the orange glow that was spilling across my book page, illumining the parchment on which my Shakespeare was printed. I'm told by Hermione that the setting sun makes my green eyes sparkle and glow. I smiled, thankful for the compliment but also shook my head, I certainly never thought so since I always try to avoid the sun whenever possible, which is rather difficult living here and seeing the metaphorical 'Sun' the Emperor, the Son of Heaven.
Maybe I was ill again, maybe I was sick. But these past few days have left me bedridden and at the mercy of fate herself. Constantly being seen and checked on by healers and my closest family here, I was certainly never left alone. It appeared to have scared almost everyone I had come into contact with, whether for good or worse, I certainly hadn't had the mental capacity to guess. Although I definitely knew exactly what had occurred when He himself came to see me.
I heard a door push wide open and hurried shuffling footsteps towards the bed "Harry, I need to ask you a question." He said sitting in the bed and taking Cygnus from me, who easily went back to sleep "Harry, how would feel if I stayed exactly the same, forever?" I blinked and sat up, I couldn't really see Draco, "What do you mean?" He sighed and opened the curtains, I blinked and my mouth opened, his hair looked so soft and his face..."Why are you asking me?" Draco smiled and blushed, running his hand through Cygnus' hair "Well, I care about your opinion, and I do really care about you, Harry honestly." I smiled and bit my lip, "I mean, I wouldn't mind, but I really think I shouldn't have much of say..." I saw Draco smile as he patted my head, he pecked a small kiss to the crown of my head, "I'll get dressed to see Sev, you can stay here if you want, and call Steph if Cygun's and Aliette wake up, I'll be back soon, I promise." I nodded and laid back down.
Draco was nervous and afraid of all this new stuff. I had tried my best to calm him, by telling him that it was interesting to watch the sky and imagine that we're playing Quidditch. It helped him a bit. His parents were not doing much better, his mother was gently rubbing his father's hand and arm, whispering things into his ears.
"You seemed scared to tell me before you stopped." Draco laughed and smiled, he had regained some calmness and relief.
I sighed and licked my lips, Draco sat down next to me and held my hand "You know how we're fictional in the muggle world? And how there are 7/8 movies about each year in Hogwarts?", Draco nodded wondering where I was going with this, "Well, I was watching the second film, and got a crush on one of the actors, my aunt got me a doctors appointment because I wasn't a 'normal boy'." Draco ran a hand through my hair. "They asked me a bunch of questions, and told me to keep a journal thing of all my emotions and thoughts down on paper." Draco hugged me, and I rested my head on his shoulder.
I smiled, dazed as he pulled away from our intense kiss, leaving me with bruised lips and an attacked tongue. My hooded eyes looked at him, licking my lips and moving a tad against his arm. He let me go and I simply leaned into Lucius. "Are you alright Draco?" Yet his voice reminded the same soft and caringness it always had with me. I liked that he always cared, always asked; it made me trust him more. Despite the assault on his throat just a few moments ago. I nodded silently and let him sit me on his lap, he knew that for an hour or so I would let him move me around like a ragdoll. Lucius smiled and kissed my cheek. Running a hand through my hair "Good, was that a nice wake-up call?"
Wait. That's a bad thought, absolutely not. Not like that. Harry had almost nothing to do with my uncle. I definitely do not find my uncle cute or adorable. Not in the slightest.
Two weeks later and I was packing my trunk for staying at Malfoy Manor, they'll probably want me out as soon as they see my clothes Draco skipped in and sat joyfully on the bed "You look happy." I remarked as he looked at me and grinned "We're going shopping, they're going to buy you stuff too, no buts and I get out of Hogwarts!!" I smiled and closed my trunk "and wrapped my arm around him "I'm going to see Hermione and Ron okay, I'll be back soon, promise." he nodded and laid back down'
After this revelation I took my time to walk back towards the room we were graciously given, making sure to greet whoever I passed appropriately. When I did return about half an hour later, I was glad that my uncle was still sleeping as soundly as I had left him. It was me getting back into bed that woke him. As it turns out I make more noise getting into a bed rather than out.
A few months after that night Draco had cancelled one of his rewards, it would make little difference, so he didn't think it mattered a whole lot. Harry didn't care. He liked Draco regardless of anything.
Chapter six: August 10th > Draco and Harry are together and talking about the past and things Harry has experienced, with Draco asking what Remus and Sirius were like outside of the City, (the motorbike is also mentioned). When Harry asked Draco stays quiet and doesn’t answer much, not wanting to. Harry gets excited over fish and the water.
Although he did pick up his wand now and then to make sparks fly. He wanted to use it for the wedding and then place it in the Malfoy Valut, as an heirloom. He used his father's wand if it was absolutely necessary, but most of thine had it float beside him, or have the teeth attach to his clothes.
She led us inside toward a warm living room, I followed Draco and sat beside him on the white leather sofa. Neptune had eagerly sat between her parents and brother. "What exactly did I miss during the past 22 years?" Draco was leaned against her waist.
"However dispute that we still have the biggest amount of seats, plus your uncle had taken Ganut, Slytherin and newly gained Riddle seats." Neptune smiled, I hardly understood a word but they seemed happy. Which often meant that it was good for them and bad for Dumbledore.
"Harry!" I smiled and sat up. "Come with me, please." I looked up at him as I followed him upstairs to our shared dorm.
"How did it go, the phone call I mean." I laned on the wall and sighed quietly. It didn't go badly, so to speak, I just couldn't find it in me to hear his reply. I wondered what to tell Harry. I did not want to lie, but I didn't want to tell the full truth either. I bit my lip and almost stopped myself at the feeling of unnatural smoothness. I shook my head, hoping Harry realised that I wanted him to drop it. "Draco, are you okay? You don't seem yourself, I mean granted your generally differ-"
"Draco, really? You were never one for modesty, you know I'd never harm you." I nodded and smiled as he rose from sitting down, to pat my head and pull me into a soft, hug. "Keep your eyes open, as much as you can, I don't want to hurt you." I relaxed in his arms and nodded "Severus, I'm cold and I know this is going hurt me anyway, I'll be blind for half an hour at least." It was a lie, but it felt comforting nonetheless a soft white lie. I felt a kiss to my forehead, I sat and laid on his soft plush mattress.
She's what I expected from Neptune's sister, creative and passionate. I didn't really know Apple very much, Father never spoke about her, even when I asked it seemed he wanted to forget her existence, Neptune and I are the only children in our family that really count. Neptune said that father had told her that they certain people have to be sacrificed in order for others to live happily  -while they were playing chess-, she said that he was referring to them, he left them so that we could live happily at home, without arguments, lies and jealousy. Neptune did the same thing by leaving.
I gently pulled Draco next to me and gave him the best reassuring smile I possibly could, "It's fine, but you might want to cover yourself with this." I pull out my invisibility cloak as Draco eyes seem to light up at the sight of it "I'm not sure how my housemates would react if I brought a Slytherin into the tower." He nodded and I draped it over him, He coughed a bit them nuzzled closer to me before. When we got into my dorm room I had been given this year Draco shook his head lightly and pat down with impossible sort hair before shuffling on his feet "Something wrong?" I asked, sitting on one of the beds in the well-lit room, Draco putting on the other "Not really it's just, I'm kind of scared." He said, my face softened and I went to get up, Draco watching my every move I sat down next to him, slowly "Of what?" I asked softly letting him think, my hand were on my lap Draco looked at me "You can keep a secret right?"
"Probably not, he did always want me to have long hair, but I don't care about he wants that much. I can do whatever want I'm not letting my uncle stop me." I said with a shrug, smiling a little at Harry, "He can, technically, but it's my choice whether or not I listen." I watched as Harry glanced at the water and the fish, looking up at me after a few minutes, "Why do you ask?" I questioned, reaching to hold Harry's hand, wanting to know if he would answer me.
"But father! Please can't you try?" Draco begged to his father, he looked so sad that he was leaving his son, but Draco's chin quivered and his mother wiped the tears falling down his face like a thunder storm with her hand and pressed him to her side "Lucius, please can you just try to talk to Dumbledore about staying, nither of us like to to Draco cry and I don't feel like leaving him in Hogwarts, with just Harry, no offense dear." I was surprised that I had been mentioned let alone called 'dear' by his mother. Lucius semed to think it through "I'll try, but I can't promise that he'll say yes." It was enough to make him smile.
He sat down on a stool, watching as I rest my head back into the water and seem quite an at peace "We are about a mile away from home."  My head moves forwards as I look at him in near alarm, my mouth opens to speak "Draco, yes it's visible and no we cannot back out now and turn away." He kneeled to full height and held my hand "I know that this will be hard for you, to return, it's hard for me as well and, depending on who is judging, harder for me. But try your hardest to not think about them, about it. I will do the same."
We must have stayed still late since by the time Hermione gave me my large bowl of  oatmeal and fruits we could hear bugs "Is that dinner?" Draco asked, albite very confused and worried. To his relief shook my head. Hermione had also been making something for Draco as well it seemed as she came through with a plate of rice and beef. "Thank you."
"I'm not tried I promise." He rolled his eyes and patted my head, before accioing something in his hands.
"Do you sleep with your uncle?" Harry's voice is quiet and gentle, I would asv him to explain what exactly he means, as at the moment, sleep with could mean anything. Although I've grown up in a limitless world, I've had rules yes, of behaviour and decorem; but of moral and and boundaries we had none, my parents always led lax lives, having no real issue with bending the rules, my uncle and Daffodil are the same but worse. Severus, he is different. I don't like Severus, I never have. "Draco?"
"Ron's my best friend, but even I couldn't bear two, especially when one is completely obsessed with me." The Slytherin girl smiled and nodded to Draco, who looked pale and scared.
"So what are they like outside of the city?" I was mealy curious because I knew that everyone was different outside the city, and Sirius and Remus seemed to be the most detached and quiet people here. They were always together or with Harry, at least Remus was a little talkative and with people, he was often round the city. I've often walked in on him in a hall or a seen him by a riverbank, humming to himself, he always looked so peaceful. Sirius I hardly ever saw outside of mealtimes; if it wasn't for those I would assume he didn't live here at all. I know now that Sirius spends most of his time either at his palace with Remus or in Daffodil's eunuch house
Slowly we leave the dense cities and move towards land I know. Grass and trees, fresh air, and clear starry skies. I have missed it more than I realised, it's been years since I slept on my own bed. I thank the driver, giving him 300 galleons for his troubles. Stepping off of the carriage I breathed a small sigh.
Luckily today of all days was the day that writing on the wall cause the whole school to go up in flames. I think I will pretend to care. It was probably someone trying to make a scene. Enemies of the heir beware? Who in the name of Merlin and Morgana was the heir! I stayed as clear to any drama as possible.
Reaching for my wand I wave it around slightly, some sparks shoot out of the end. Then form a little image, it's clear and translucent but I can just about see it. I wave it away as quickly as I conjured it. I keep hearing this little melody in my head, along with a male voice humming. I pay it little mind and let him continue.
I looked at Harry, thinking of some way to prove Harry wrong that wasn't just me talking to him, "Come with me." I stood up offering Harry my hand "I want to show you, someone." Harry looked at me curiously but grabbed my hand anyway, letting me lead him away.
Blair had told me that she wrote books in her spear time, and had even gotten to publish them, the series name was 'Palace of Evil' the books so far were 'Queen of Evil, A School Girl's Crush, A School Girl's Crush: Jealously and When Wedding Bells Chime.' Blair had said that it was based on my Mother and our Father at Hogwarts and afterwards, she'd worked hard for years making sure she was telling the total truth.  I liked the sound of them, although I know that the Triplets never really had a good relationship with Mother, not while Lily's was around anyway.
"We'll rock paper scissors it if we can't decide." they turned around "Auror Malfoy, well-done go getting here." I rolled my eyes and sat next to Auror Little (Allison).
"I want what we decided last week to be folded and put away, I will not look like an Edwarain princess." Reg nodded, smirking as he turned away to do what I asked but my uncle groaned "I'll be able to handle him uncle, please don't worry." He needed assurance that everything would be okay. We were set to leave at dusk tonight, ready to arrive at Wiltshire for dawn, and subsequently, my new Lordship. At last, I could step off the stool and into waiting arms. Sents of cinnamon and spiced chocolate engulfed me in waves. This morning the bells were rung loudly and clearly over the whole of the City and therefore London. The seventy-five days were over. Mourning had ended, although for us, it would never be complete.
I don't know how to describe the things I saw on my way; I don't think I was paying much attention to the outside world when arriving in the City too excited to finally see the Emperor in person, I had met my uncle before, multiple times. But it's so different, I don't like it. There are people in rags outside shops, children in unwashed or over washed clothes. Parents on their own. I don't like it! It's cruel and mean, what are they being punished for? What bad deeds did they do in their previous lives? Why do they have to suffer in mortality, why not drum skin? Or a butterfly or a rock?
"She's as good as a blind bat and you were warned by plenty of people that she would be a mistake." The Emperor smiled a little and beckoned me closer, making me yelp quietly as he pulled me onto his lap when I got close enough, chuckling as he saw my expression
They came in together, side by side. The Emperor led Draco, holding his arm and leading him to the table, allowing him beside Lucius while I sat close in between Remus and Sirius. Draco smiled at me as he reached for a selection of toast. Lucius leaned in towards Draco's ear and began whispering, what it was I have no idea. By then they had all started talking amongst ourselves, but most of everyone looked at me in destain, which I didn't understand. I hadn't spent the night with our Emperor, that was Draco! Is Draco better liked because he can function as a normal teenager? Or do people just not like me and this has nothing to do with Draco? I cam to rest my head on Remus' shoulder, too dizzy to lift my head. Remus looks at me with a smile that comes too naturally to him he feeds me little bits of cake until I've eaten my slice. At this everyone is muttering and glaring at me and to each other, I heard one tiny snippet; 'spoiled just Lady Malfoy'. I looked over at Draco and he shrugged, he had been dealing with this for a while I could tell.
The Empress was currently bathing in warm water and rose petals, said by her healer to promote her muscles and magic to relax and calm. Which was at the moment something she required. She had felt the stress of some sort of oncoming issue. Her husband, as always brushed away her concerns and told her to do some needlework. She had been shutting herself out away from everyone, too ashamed of her looks to let anyone see her. She even stopped lying beside
Breakfast was sweet but silent, they only knew that I wouldn't really be coming back, I didn't want to leave them behind either, not when they would be at Hogwarts so soon. I had really wanted to watch them grow up, and have children of their own, to be a better grandfather than my own.
Harry didn't speak much during breakfast, he answers some questions but that was about it; I tried to make conversation but ultimately it fell flat. I was due to leave by two am, so that we got to England by seven in the morning, by we I mean me, my parents and the twins. Quite simple, expect it's anything but.
My eyes snapped open as I jolted up and nearly fell out of bed, "Do you have any idea of how worried I was? You kept drifting in and out of consciousness, I was about to call Snape and Madam Pomfrey if you hadn't of woken up just now!" I blinked, all them weren't real, they were nightmares, but the first one definitely was. I mumbled an apology and got ready for breakfast.
I woke up panting, and was held back, by Draco's hand, I sat up as he wrapped his arm around me, "Harry? Are you alright?" I nodded meekly, as Draco smiled and squeezed my shoulder "Did you have one of those dreams again?" I nodded and saw that Draco was in his uniform already "Draco, where are we?" He looked out the window, and grinned, "We left the station about ten minutes ago." I rested my head on the window and sighed as Blaise laughed, "Oh and Draco has something to tell you, in Hogwarts." I nodded.
After breakfast I asked if I could stay outside for awhile, I spent the hour or so just laying on the soft grass, I couldn't see any bugs, flies, or any garden animals anywhere, I couldn't even see ants! Staring up at the clouds I smiled, until I felt someone walk behind me, sitting up and turned around to see Lucius, he smiled maybe he was looking for me? "Stephaine, could you follow me, you can come back outside after." I got up, went to brush off grass off my skirt to see none "My wife, Narcissa didn't like getting grass on her, and still doesn't, and my family never liked incests, the most you'll see here are bees." I nodded and followed him into a lit room, with candles that emit blue and green flames "Copper and Barium." I mumbled under my breath as I looked around "Excuse me?" I looked at him and shook my head "I was just mumbling about the flame colours."
"Whose Scabbers?" Lucius asked, probably knowing what I could have dreamed about "Ron's pet rat." I answered, when Draco laid his hand on my forehead, I sighed and laid on his chest I could have sworn I'd felt that kind of calming magic once before, maybe as a baby, as we drove on, we could see the Manor now "Draco you don't have to do that, you don't have to put yourself through using that magic. I'm glad you gave them to your aunt and uncle, and you can still see them, and they at least know who their father is, and they still have a room in the Manor, besides they are there here, with them, but you don't have to use magic that you gained from them, if you don't want to."
Her sigh was what immediately called Daffodil's attention. She stood up and whipped out her wand, walking silently, a spy in her own home. Slowly she began to turn on her music box; the sweet tune luring out her prey. A simple old tune, sweet and alluring, but dangerous and harsh, a little like death Daffodil thought. Reggie was currently cleaning another area and she couldn't very well call him here, maybe they would have a discussion later on about the distance they constantly faced. Daffodil waited calmly as the eunuch came from her own bedroom, blood boiled as she sent the darkest holding curse she could. Binding the brat to the floor in her special room. She didn't take calmy to people rummaging through her things, her precious things. Her gifts and pride.
I woke up again before sunrise, using the time to get ready before Harry, I was out of our dorm by the time his alarm went off, not that he'd get up. I sat back on the chair I was using last night, waiting for anyone I knew to come down, I was waiting for a while I could tell.
“She might have.” James reached for a muffin from a basket Lorraine had just added to the spread. “How could she think I want to food shame her, though?! When I first met her, we once had a marshmallow-eating contest. I am one hundred percent pro-eating.”
oppressed people, and because there's "no rule that you must be 100% Indian to embrace the culture, Harry."
Harry's heart was racing. He took a deep breath—however much anxiety he had about this whole fake marriage thing they were doing, he needed to push through. He'd have to look to see if he still had any of his low-dose Calming Draught upstairs.
Harry walks over to the sofa and flops onto his back. He's not expecting Draco to flop on top of him, his pointy nose pressing into Harry's collarbone.
"Level with me, Potter." Malfoy leans a hand on the kitchen counter. "Are you really here to study? Because we can do that. I just—"
Draco gestured at Harry with a bag of walnuts. "You're the soft one, that's all I'm saying. Despite what the public thinks, that you're like a big bad Auror who annihilated Voldemort with his eyes closed, using his non-wand hand, or whatever they say about you these days. All I'm saying is, of all the grandparents, if the boys were looking for a mark…"
Harry turns around, pointing at the canvas on the mantel. "I already told you, didn't I?" He meets Draco's eye, trying to project all his inarticulate feelings of hope and commitment and maybe-we-can-actually-do-it onto his face.
George answers in the middle of talking to someone in the sitting room. He briefly pauses, smiles, says, "Hey Haz. Why did you knock, mate?" and disappears, talking about Shrivelfigs. There's an unidentifiable whirring noise. He steps inside with the odd feeling that this is what home used to feel like.
Seeing that certainty now sparked a tiny flame of hope, the first Draco had allowed himself to feel today. Draco leaned in, touching his lips tentatively to Harry's, but he had to stop. He had to pause—he had to pull away. The force of the emotions was overwhelming, like he was going to burst. It was, frankly, scary as fuck.
What had he worn the last time he went on a date? He couldn't even remember, and that seemed somewhat pitiful. How would he attract someone? He sent up a silent prayer to the ghost of Sirius, whom he always thought of as his fashion role model and whom he wished were here to help, and grabbed blindly for some garment that would usually seem too tight. That's how people dressed to attract others, wasn't it? He pulled the clothes on, refused to dwell on it, grabbed a bottle of wine and a bottle of the fancy mineral water Hermione liked, and disappeared into the Floo.
Maybe it was strange to look to their sons' relationship as some sort of model, but honestly, this entire thing was so fucked up to begin with, why stop now?
Draco turned towards Harry. "You wanna prove it? Let's Floo to the Ministry. If you snog me anywhere in the building, I'll take it back and never call you prude again."
"Would you like a Calming Draught?" Draco asked, rubbing one of his eyes. "I think I might have diazepam, too, if you'd prefer Muggle."
"Regardless," Draco said, bringing his fork to his mouth, "I'm sure I'll have an easier time feigning interest than you. Which should work out well, because I'm so good-looking, it's not like you'll have to feign attraction."
"Yes, clearly, and I don't resent that," Harry sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face. "I just—it's brought up a lot of feelings about—being wanted."
For a minute, Harry doesn't say anything. He sips his drink, then looks indistinctly into the distance, his eyes unfocused on the colourful array of bottles behind the bar. This isn't what he thought life would be like, if he ever made it past the war. "I thought it would be better now."
Harry laughed but tried to keep it silent, which resulted in his face going delightfully red. He waved his hand to rotate the floating book.
"First things first," Hermione said, leaning back to perch on one of Draco's more expensive-looking pieces of furniture, "who are the most vulnerable groups to this policy change? Who will be harmed; whom do we need to help? Protect the vulnerable first, then we can debate how to deal with it on the policy level."
"That it's happening. He claims he doesn't need approval of the Wizengamot or of voters, blasted system as it is."
“Admit it!” Harry enthused, gesturing around them. “You love having fun. Where are we going, anyway?”
Ron turned, a wide grin on his face, and his eyes dropped to Harry's legs. He thrust a finger towards Harry and shouted, "You vixen!"
“Yeah,” Harry said, looking across the Great Hall to where Malfoy was chatting with Parkinson at the Slytherin table. Malfoy wasn’t eating his food.
He closes his eyes, hand still on the wall, so I mirror him, trying to visualise magic—both my own, happily circulating in my core, and the magic around me. I've never been very good at it, to my mother's dismay. According to her, the problem is too many thoughts in my head to be able to concentrate properly. According to my father, it's a lack of strength and discipline.
?" Malfoy said, elongating the words, and then bursting into laughter. "Potter, neither of us has ever been fucking
It doesn't seem to have worked. He fumbles with his keys, wishing for the comfort of his bed even though it's three o'clock in the afternoon. A reasonable time for a nap, really. He gets the door open, then stops short.
"Okay, true. But you're happier any time we have the kids over for dinner. Any time we go flying. That time we went to the zoo. I see you happier like five times per week. On the average Tuesday!"
They still had no idea what they were going to do come summer. Penelope was helping them to "be okay with not knowing." They kept saying they were okay with it, but Harry didn't think either of them really believed they were.
"That righteous speech you made was pretty sexy." Harry wrapped a finger in Draco's belt loop. "Very like, David Attenborough documentary—Protective Mate Fends Off Interlopers."
The door opens and Ginny walks in, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. "Ugh. Did we eat something off?"
Harry whirled around, knocking into a chair. His head was all over the place these days, but mention of Albus—which could only mean news of the baby—was a surefire way to get his full, focused attention. "Did he say what about?"
Harry’s eyes flew open, blinking rapidly in time with his heart. His face was pushed into his pillow, the first light of morning peeking through the window.
"Excuse me, you—" Jorgen started, but the man closed the door and sagged against it, and something about the movement of the shoulders told Harry who it was.
“The article’s out, then?” Harry asked, and Draco handed him the paper. Above the fold, a photo of the four of them—each breaking the dress code—looped below the headline, “GOLDEN TRIO TAKES ON THAT-WHICH-MUST-NOT-BE-WORN.”
Draco took a step away, feeling a bit cold now that his hip was no longer smothered with Aster's warm little body. Harry stepped up next to him, which did not replace the loving feeling of a baby barnacle, but it did make him feel somewhat less bereft, regardless.
A burst of light explodes from his hand, blinding us. He mutters quickly, "Nox!" and the light flickers out.
He throws on a pair of jeans and a hoodie and wanders out to the street. The air is damp from recent rain and smells like morning; the streets are filled with shopkeepers putting out placards and bags of trash from last night's store closings. Harry tries two doors that are still locked, despite the hubbub inside, before he finds a café that's open.
