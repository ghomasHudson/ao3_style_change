Harry felt a lightness enter him as some of his worry left him. He could always count on Draco. “Do you want to hold it?” There was definitely awe in Draco’s eyes as he spluttered undignifiedly. “Here,” he forced the sword into Draco’s hand, who almost dropped it.
Harry let him leave but turned to Draco to ask permission to leave him alone. Draco nodded before Harry could say anything and gave him a kiss. Harry followed Sirius to the garage, where Sirius was climbing on his motorcycle. The roar of the engine drowned out Harry calling his name. Harry watched him drive off, concerned. Sirius was rarely one to let things get him down, and he wasn’t entirely sure what would make him upset. He had hidden his face when Harry first told him about the marriage, was he truly not in favor of that?
Ron wanted to go visit Hermione after breakfast, and Harry saw an opportunity to read the letter and possibly visit with Draco. At the Entrance Hall, Harry said, “I’ll go get her a book and meet you there in a bit.”
When they got to their secret room, where Draco had taken great pains to make it as beautiful as possible, all for Harry, he couldn’t help but stare as his breath left him. For the third time that night, it wasn’t the surroundings that enraptured Harry, but the beauty of Draco. Not just the light shining off his face, reflecting off his slicked hair, but how wonderful Draco was, as a person. He was the person for Harry. The one.
“What do you think the Brute has to show you?” Draco asked after the door had swung shut behind them.
He would find the horcruxes, destroy them, and take on Voldemort. If he had to sacrifice everything in his life to defeat him, then that’s what it would take. If it took his very life, then so be it. At the moment, it would be a relief.
Ron and Hermione stared at him after he took a small gulp. He felt fantastic. His night went well, and he got the memory! He immediately went to Dumbledore’s office and they viewed the memory together in an emergency meeting.
He knew that there was no proof, and he probably shouldn’t even be up in the Headmaster’s office. There was never any proof he took the things he took. He had them in a box under his bed, enchanted to be hidden from prying eyes. He only ever took them out in the dead of night, when everyone else was asleep. So, there was no way he was in enough trouble to warrant a trip up here. This deserved punishment.
“Speaking of Draco, I wanted to talk to you about his birthday. It’s on the fifth.” Sirius listened to his barely-there ideas and made a couple well-placed suggestions. Harry felt much better about what they would be doing when the silence fell between them again.
“Thank you for telling me all that, Harry. I know it was hard. I’m so proud of you.” He pulled Harry into another hug. “If there’s ever anything you need to talk about, anything at all, you can come talk to me.”
"You'll never take me alive!“ Harry yelled as he started struggling. Draco stared at him as he tightened his grip on reflex, probably wondering what the hell Harry was doing.
“Mother, I wouldn’t have anyone else as my mother. You are incredible as a mother, and a more outstanding pureblood matron will never be found elsewhere. Don’t do whatever it is you plan to do.”
He turned his head to look at Draco and was struck by the love, affection, and awe on his face. Draco really and truly loved him, he knew that more than ever, just looking at him. He pushed himself up on his elbow to get closer to him, he really needed that. He pushed himself on top of Draco and attacked his lips.
“There are very few House Elf wards, and most people don’t bother with them. If she did enforce them…well, we’ll deal with that if it comes to that.”
Their voices traveled over each other, all trying to talk at once. There was a deep voice behind them. “Quiet!” It demanded, and they fell silent again, parting to allow Snape into their midsts. One of the Death Eaters tried to tell him something, but Snape only lifted his hand to order him to fall silent.
He started to relax back into the couch, and Draco started moving his slow sweet kisses further down towards his neck. He moved back his collar and Harry tensed. Draco paused, and when Harry didn’t move further, continued kissing further down his neck, almost to his back.
“Good. Weird. But good.” Draco nodded, and picked up the pace just a little bit. Harry hadn’t been lying when he said it felt good, but with the faster pace, it felt
“Thank Merlin you’re alright.” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand. Harry was very grateful for that.
“I was so worried about you,” Draco whispered into Harry’s neck. It was so nice to have someone worrying about him. “What took so long for you to get here? Did you give ‘em a piece of your mind for wasting your time?” Harry could see his thought process.
Harry nodded. “Alright. I promise I’ll leave if I feel unsafe.”
“Ron!” Hermione exclaimed. “That was just cruel! Did you see he was crying? He could have been badly injured.”
. “Coward,” he screamed. Snape turned, within reach of the gates.
“This is rather brilliant. It doesn’t even look like the same room.” He took a seat on the sofa, and Harry squished his rush of excitement as he took the cushion next to him.
Harry’s face evened out to warmth, and he grabbed Draco’s face. With intentional slowness, he leaned forward and kissed Draco’s lips. Draco sighed into Harry’s cheek and hugged him. Harry expected it to be quick, but it wasn’t. Draco hugged him tightly, rocking them slowly for several long minutes.
“Really, it was just the one,” Harry said with a huff, “and that didn’t count, I didn’t go out of my way to apprehend him.”
Pansy Parkinson was Draco’s date, as Harry had been informed of beforehand. She had asked him after they had agreed to just take whoever, and he figured she was about as good as he could do. Harry didn’t like the way she gripped his arm like it belonged to her.
wellbeing, especially after that meeting. Another year, another plot to kill him. That was how life at Hogwarts was.
Krum’s whistle had gone off when Harry was battling the pixies, and his screen came up in the lower left hand of the screen. He chose to go left at the fork.
He looked up when Sirius’s voice wavered, and he wiped away tears too. “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry,” he said, he got up and leaned over Harry’s chair, giving him an awkward but comforting hug, and Harry couldn’t keep the sobs at bay anymore. Sirius just hugged him tighter.
“Didn’t you see his eyes?” Harry asked as they stared down at him. “I don’t think he was acting under his own power.”
She shook her head, tears springing to her eyes, as she took more steps backwards. “No,” she said in denial, as she realized that she had been wrong. Harry didn’t love her. He didn’t want her. He might not even like her.
Harry blushed again. “Thanks, Sirius.”
“It would be good if we found an empty classroom over break,” Draco had said as he levitated what looked like a bird cage over to the corner. “With no one around, it would be easier to move this rubbish with no one around.”
“Young lady, do you have any idea how much harm you have done to Mr. Potter? What were you thinking? You are, what, fourteen-, fifteen-years-old? You have absolutely no right to administer potions to
“…Sirius Black and James Potter!”
Hermione was the one who caught his eye over Draco’s shoulder. Harry stared at her, trying to figure out what her thoughts were. She didn’t give anything away, other than her tilting head beaconing him over to where she was standing with Ron. Harry resisted a movement from Draco, so distracted was he in trying to decipher what was about to happen with his friends. Draco paused the dance long enough to look over his shoulder and rolled his eyes, looking contrite when he realized Harry had caught the motion.
“I don’t trust him.” Ron finally said, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. Hermione shook her head.
Harry took Draco’s hand and smiled at him rather dreamily. Draco stared back, eyes lidded. Harry really was tired, but he didn’t feel like sleeping just yet. He didn’t want the night to end.
spotted, would you?” Ron and Hermione glared. Harry, who was a little behind them, sent a relieved smile in his direction at him being safe. Draco did not return it, but adjusted his stance leaning up against the tree to hide his slight nod.
“Mr. Potter!” Madam Pomfrey exclaimed. “You’re awake!”
“What is that?” Draco asked from where he was unpacking.
Dumbledore leaving was the worst thing to happen to Hogwarts since…Dumbledore had left, second year. The castle just seemed empty without him. Umbridge tried to question him with Veritaserium about Dumbledore’s and Sirius’s whereabouts, but Harry caught on and didn’t drink it.
“I’ll take care of them,” Sirius said, walking calmly up to him. “You go get Draco, and I’ll stand guard. Don’t take too long now.”
A couple of red flags stand out against that. Draco locks eyes with his father who’s finally starting to sit up. The man taught Draco almost all he knows that books couldn’t. For starters, when elves picked up wands after their master forbade it, their hands would burn instantly. Instant punishment, because it was such a Big Deal in the wizarding world. He pays close attention to her face and can’t help but notice how similar she looks to his Torture Pixie after the Imperio curse wore off. Both
agree to be her co-owner? It’s a weird situation, because Draco
Looks like a week has passed by already.
Draco frowns, “Let’s get on with it then.”
“Do you remember what I told you about Snape and his personal vendettas in all this?”
“Bloody fucking-” Draco sighs. “Griphook, if I’m here and you’re here, I’m assuming you know that business is about to happen.”
And because it’s not already awkward enough, Harry picks that moment to rip his hand free from Hermione’s, naturally keeping Draco’s hand in his, and starts rummaging through his pockets.
The old coot is waiting behind his desk and before Draco can rant and rave at him, a small ball of white tackles him into a chair.
“They abuse him! Harry deserves better and you know it.”
“The Dark Lord placed a sort of spell on him, a form of the Imperius Curse, but one that brings up past memories so the person in question has no idea of the reality around them until much later. It is meant to confuse and torture the effected’s mind to insanity. Severus says it’s called
Harry blinks twice, just to make sure he isn’t seeing things. Only he is, in fact, seeing things, because as soon as the page number left his mouth it materialized on the paper. He couldn’t mistake it, the little number filling in on the top right hand corner as ‘958’, the heading reading
“The Beauxbatons?” Blaise smirks, “So she’s hot-”
He does have to admit that he’s never felt more prepared for exams. Each of them have their own strengths, Harry leads them in Defense Against the Dark Arts, which isn’t surprising. Blaise takes Herbology as his specialty while Pansy breaks down and gives them all a lecture in Transfiguration. Weasley even makes some quips when they’re studying for Care of Magical Creatures, and since he’s playing nice, Draco assists everyone in Charms. When Hermione isn’t having a breakdown, she gives them History of Magic lessons. They’re all too afraid of what will happen if they don’t pay attention to fall asleep. Amazing how effective fear tactics can be.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco hopes Snape takes the note to heart. From the smile slowly blooming across his face, he appears to. Which is good, because Draco has a professor to meet in exactly twenty minutes.
Lucius shakes his head, “My dear boy, you deserve all the kindness your mother and I have to offer. As for the Dark Lord, I have a new plan to please him. If Potter refuses to become your friend, we shall wipe out his other options and aid his Darkness in his return.”
“In Yorkshire.” Snape pipes up quietly. “We had been sent to clear out wizards so the Dark Lord, sorry Draco,
At the end of his mini-shopping spree, Draco finds himself with a few new books, a couple of mismatched coffee cups, a few toys for Salem, a new off-white sweater, some pants that were said to be the most comfortable thing
Draco blinks.
“Leave Howard to me.” Mrs. Daisy says. The smile on her face sends a shiver up Draco’s spine.
The second thing on his master list is to get some fucking food. Staying up learning a semi-new language makes a growing boy tired, so after a few sausages and some weird looks from Hermione, Harry is fully prepared to begin his plan. And then a giant, pissy-looking owl drops a note on his plate.
Sirius blinks a few times, then looks to Lucius again. “What happened?”
Lucius joins his wife’s side, easily linking their fingers together. Narcissa smiles at him in a way Sirius kinda missed. The full, completely in-love, stuck in the heart type of way that he hasn’t seen since they were students.
“Y-yes, and you are?”
Now he thinks that it was probably not worth it, because Blaise looks pissed and worried at the same time and that
“I assume you know how to block.” The professor whispers, it takes all his self restraint not to step on the toes beside his own.

appears before him in bright letters that glow in the fog.
“He did
“So, I’ve been doing some reading, and turns out my ancestors were actually really friendly with snakes? Like, uh,” Harry’s not really sure how to demonstrate, so he makes an attempt at shrugging and does his best.
“Would it really be so awful if Harry Potter and I became friends?”
Sirius shushes Remus as he holds up another shirt to the man, “It’s been two hours love, this is nothing.”
“Really, you should have seen that coming. Severus is not one miss a payback opportunity.”
He’s not really sure how it happened. He remembers stopping for lunch when Narcissa got hungry, he remembers Sirius talking about the renovations and a photographer snagging a picture of the teenagers bickering. He remembers the bad headache he got, Narcissa offering him a potion for it, Draco checking his temperature. He also remembers Blaise mentioning some weird training camp, and then Sirius was asking if anyone was staying over and now here they are.
Two sets of arms he quickly recognizes as Pansy and Blaise wrap around him before he could reach for his wand, but once he’s encased in the familiar warmth, he grins back. “You! Mother? Did you?”
“We kept meeting after I was healed.” Snape explains. “Every new town they were there, and every time I would sneak back under polyjuice and help them. Brew what I could, drag the bodies they couldn’t.”
“Dates, people!” Harry calls out from where Luna is leading him. “Ron and I don’t have dates!”
“I dunno, the library is also a valid option.”
“It says,” Blaise continues, “That you cannot lie to us. Ever. If you do you’ll spend the day speaking in Latin until you tell us the truth, we’ll face the same thing..”
Snape opens his mouth right as Dumbledore rises, silencing them both. “That is quite enough, Draco has a point, Severus. I believe you and I must speak with the rest of the staff about this occurrence. Draco, would you watch over Harry until I can return?”
The renovations, well, what he’s seen so far, are stunning. Like one of those magazines Petunia likes to look at, the ones that Vernon always called her crazy for because they were ‘too expensive’. Harry finds it extremely funny that Remus is casually spilling alcohol on a countertop that’s probably worth more than Petunia’s entire china collection.
“What? No. That’s like me loaning you the money, Howie. I won’t allow you to pay it back.”
Draco completely ignores her, turning to Blaise with wide angry eyes, “I
relaxing year.”
“Whatever, she is adorable and sweet, but I’m willing to bet my little Crookshanks won’t like her, plus we have work to do.”
Another half truth, would they catch up with him one day? He hopes not. Either way, truth or lie, it seems to be enough for Snape.
needs his friends right now, not some impostor, he continues. Saying something about Arthur Weasley being stupid- and he’s not wrong. With how the entire family acts, no one would ever know their purebloods, his father had drilled it in his brain that the entire lot of them were the biggest disgrace high society had ever known. Judging by the look the frauds give him, they don’t agree.
left banister and glare at the figure coming down marble steps.
Sirius has to agree with Dumbledore on that one. Never in his life could he have predicted this moment.
Hermione puts her books down, “Harry. Do you know anything about Kneazles?”
Clearly this took a bit of planning.
Snape sighs, and right before he can give any advice Lupin is stepping through his fireplace, “Sorry I’m a bit late, I know we agreed on noon but-oh. Hello, Draco.”
“Yes.”
Because the truth is that he’s not running away for once.
The glint in her eye is only a little crazed, “I haven’t been calm since I first laid my eyes on those two idiots. It’s a wonder my hair hasn’t gone grey yet.”
“I definitely did, sweetheart. I like whatever you do. Don’t be afraid to try things with me, ok? Even that foot thing was, well it felt really good. I still think it’s a little gross, it’s a foot, after all. That was why you waited until it was clean though right?”
“I’m interested in hearing all your ideas and opinions,” Draco murmured, just before their lips met.
Harry leaned forward to catch a glimpse of Pettigrew. He was looking much thinner than the last time Harry had seen him. He was nervously looking around the room, as if looking for a friendly face. Harry was gratified that he didn’t find one.
When Harry started to see numbers all around the room, Draco agreed they needed a break and went back out to the Alley. They window shopped for a while, only buying a pack of cards, candy, food, and bottled pumpkin juice on the way back to the room, again slipping past the Auror.
“Oh, I loved it. Made it seem like we were watching a play. I love plays,” he added pointedly. Harry nodded, filing that away. He might have found something else they needed to do.
“Merlin, Harry,” he continued whimpering. “I’m the luckiest bloke to have you. I can’t imagine my life without you.” Draco became wistful, so Harry slowed down and lightly scraped his teeth against Draco’s shaft. “Ah! Point taken, you little shit. I’ll talk about something else, like how I was going to say, I could get used to this. I could wake up every morning with your lips wrapped around my cock. You’d do it for me too, if I asked, wouldn’t you? I bet when we’re married, you’ll wake up early just so you can suck me off. Then you’d get on your knees in the shower. Then you’d let me bend you over the breakfast table. Oh, you like that, do you? Yes, I can see you making me breakfast, wearing nothing but an apron, and I’d just slide right into you. Can’t wait for that can you? Oh, Merlin, Harry, Harry, Harry, close, please.” Harry sped up, and Draco came. Draco’s hands stilled Harry’s head with his dick forced down Harry’s throat.
Harry squeezed his arms around him tighter for a moment. “You don’t have to say anything, Draco. I didn’t realize how much that had bothered me and admitting that was really freeing. I know there’s not really anything you can say to make things better, but this, you being here for me…that’s all I really want.”
Harry cocked his head and cupped one of Draco’s cheeks. “Ok. Stay with me?”
Umbridge’s office! She had a fireplace and plenty of floor powder, he set off right away, running. He had to get to the ministry, and he started retracing the route he would have to take through his dream. He would go from the fireplaces in the main atrium, take the lifts down to the last level, and make his way to…the Department of Mysteries.
They talked about it, and decided not to inform Sirius or anyone else about their Soul Bond. It wasn’t that they didn’t want him to know, but it was still so new and special. It felt intimate, something that should be honored and not shared lightly. They just wanted to enjoy having something special between the two of them for a while.
“Well, we don’t have to decide now. It’ll be years before we’re ready, don’t you think? When are you thinking we would start having them?”
“Maybe. But I’m not counting on that. Someone has tried to kill me every year since I’ve been here. I just wanted one year where it could be someone else, is that really too much to ask?”
Harry was faster and got to Honeydukes with the secret passage before the collective group got there. He didn’t slow down in the secret passage but decided to leave his invisibility cloak and map in there and strolled casually out. He made his way to the Gryffindor common room and managed to change into clean clothes before sitting in front of the fire. There were plenty of people in the common room and he figured it wouldn’t be a bad thing to establish an alibi.
“There is nothing to apologize for, Baby. Nothing at all.” Draco shook his head against Harry’s shoulder.
“Sally!” Mandy berated.
Updated 8/1/20
“All right settle down!” McGonagall called out. “We will give you more information in the morning. For now, it is past the point you should be sleeping. Please grab a sleeping bag and go to sleep!”
“Ok,” Harry said, and he did feel much better. They talked for a little while longer about possible things to do on Harry’s birthday. Draco asked for ideas, but decided that he wanted to surprise Harry with whatever activities they ended up doing, provided it was what Harry wanted. Harry agreed, happy with the idea that someone wanted him to be happy.
“Alright,” Draco agreed after exchanging a look with Harry. Tia gave a little cheer that made the men chuckle.
Harry shrugged, not really sure.
“Your name was placed into the Goblet without your knowledge or consent?”
“Yeah…about that…” Harry scratched the back of his head nervously. “Don’t get mad, but that was kinda Ron and Hermione’s fault, and maybe, a bit, mine. See, they thought you were Slytherin’s Heir, and made Polyjuice potion to try to get a confession out of you. I tried to talk them out of it, but Hermione is scary when she gets passionate about something. They were going to do it with or without me, so I figured it would just be best to come along. I’m really sorry. I thought it was really wrong to trick you like that, but I couldn’t find a minute to tell you and you told me not to send you any owls…I didn’t know what to do. Can you forgive me?”
“Haven’t I earned the benefit of the doubt, at least? A second glance? Not one single one of you listened to me. You made fun of me, sure. Said it was impossible to pull one over Dumbledore. How impossible is it sounding now?” Ron and Hermione refused to meet his eyes.
He felt cold chills grip his heart.
Harry took a seat on the edge, and Draco sat next to him. His face was expressionless, eyes troubled but dry. He took a deep breath before he responded. “I’m alright, Harry. I’m just concerned about something having to do with your accounts. I have a suspicion, but it’s just that, and I could be dead wrong. I’m hesitant to tell you, but I have a feeling you’re not going to let it go, so all I can do is tell you, but, again, I don’t know for sure that this is what happened. Do you want to know?” Harry frowned.
“Er—yeah. Yeah, of course I do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright, well, I’ll see you tomorrow.” Harry leaned forward to kiss Draco, but he leaned back.
“There are several bonding ceremonies we can choose from, I’ll make sure we get the book, so we can choose soon. There are different levels, you see. They can be done in front of witnesses or not, at least most of them. And remember, we’re not technically married until the Wizengamot legalizes it. With just you and me, yes, we will be. In my heart, you’re already my husband.”
Draco smiled. “I would expect nothing less. You won’t be able to leave me.” Harry hummed and kissed him.
Harry made sure to introduce Draco as his fiancé; most had no problem at all and simply got on with their stories, a couple made comments like one who said they hadn’t realized it had been legalized or that they were too young. Harry could deal with all of that, and even Draco reigned in his snark. A couple confessed they were wizards, but most didn’t have to say they were muggles. They ended up staying for a couple hours, and Harry felt his mood start to improve, though it stayed in the range of nostalgic.
“Then, are you going to put something else on?” Draco sauntered over to him, swaying his hips, and encircled his arms around Harry’s neck.
“Of course not, Baby. If you’re sick, you’re sick. I hope you feel better. Want me to walk you down?”
“No!” Draco barked. “Go to the living room.”
“Well, it’s just that lots of things went wrong, and we should have been able to have a better time than we did. I wanted everything to be perfect.”
He took this moment, where Draco still loved him, selfishly. After he rescued Draco and told him what he had done, their relationship would be over, Draco would never be ok with what he had done.
The rest of the year passed, as years tend to do. As years at Hogwarts were beginning to go, there was an adventure with death-defying stunts and peril. Ginny Weasley turned out to be the one releasing Slytherin’s monster, a Basilisk, on the students but she was possessed by a sixteen-year-old Voldemort, who was apparently named Tom Riddle.
Harry read aloud. He looked up at Draco.
“Sure,” Ron said a bit slowly, “I just mean, you know, the stuff you haven’t told us.”
Hedwig returned with a letter from Sirius, which Harry read quickly before he was distracted by Hermione’s loud gasping. She had a letter in her hands as well, though she was looking into the envelope it had came in with wide eyes. “What?” Ron asked curiously, leaning over the table to try to see. Harry, who was next to her, only had to lean over a little to see gold at the bottom of the envelope.
He couldn’t feel Draco yet, but if things continued, he probably would. Draco started kissing the back of his neck and Harry let out a low moan. Then, just as suddenly as things had started, they stopped. Draco laid his head against Harry’s and they enjoyed the slow quiet of the room.
He thought he did, but he also wasn’t sure that he completely got it. He nodded anyway. “So…can we conduct another experiment, then?”
“So, you will sleep in the next bed over then?”
“Private?” Harry asked, now confused, and dreading having to deal with this.
“No,” Harry admitted, “but—”
Harry felt a touch of something at the base of his spine. He almost regretted winning, seeing the look on Draco’s face. It was mostly blank, in the typical Slytherin mask, but Harry could see the longing on it. As he felt his own face start to fall, Draco blinked, and gave him a wide, beaming smile. It lit up his whole face, making him look more ethereal, like an angel. He was Harry’s angel.
He took in each of their faces, realizing they weren’t playing a cruel joke. He took a deep, shuttering breath and covered his face with his hands. Harry took a step forward, a little worried about him. “I’m free.” Sirius whispered from underneath his hands. Harry took another step forward and Sirius threw his arms around Harry.
The author does firmly and unapologetically take the stance that as long as a person is human, that person is entitled to basic, equal human rights, to put it simply, though there is much more to be said on the subject than could possibly put down in under 5k words, though the concept should be simple enough to grasp.
“Harry," Draco said quietly from the bed. Harry looked over at him with a heavy tome on his lap, Harry's Disenchanted novels easily visible along the more non-fictional books spread around him. "I think I figured it out." Harry dropped what he was doing to make his way back over to him, something in Draco's voice telling him just how important Draco's discovery was.
“I love you too, Sirius. You’ll come to my next one, right?” Harry said, feeling a little overwhelmed as he pulled him into a hug. Sirius squeezed him tightly, swinging him from left to right and back again.
Draco walked over to the bed, pulling back the sheets, when Harry wrapped his arms around him from behind. “I don’t care.”
“Er, I don’t know Professor, this is pretty strange. Why, what’s happening?”
“Draco!” A voice came from the door. It belonged to a beautiful woman who had to be Draco’s mother or older sister, with her long blonde hair and haughty expression. “Are you finished yet?” She asked as she got closer.
Harry snorted. “You don’t have to do that. I’ll be fine.”
“Yes, you do,” said a voice very close to Harry. Ginny had joined them on his left on the sofa, and they were a bit squished together. Harry scooted closer to Luna to give her more room.
The End of Year 6.
“When I win, I expect you to put a lot of effort into our surprise date.” Draco raised his eyebrows.
He threw the orb as hard as he could to the ground. It burst into a million pieces at his cold feet, a ghostly figure rising from the shatters. She began speaking in a high-pitched, harsh voice, Voldemort was still screaming, there was so much noise, Voldemort raised his wand, and Harry fully awoke as a spell headed straight to him.
Harry was a bit worried about Mandy. He had invited her to come along to the meeting, along with a couple of his friends from other houses, like Cedric. She had been morose, wandering around on her own, and Harry hadn’t seen her smile since the previous year. He tried to include her whenever there was an inner house study group happening, and she gradually at least gave small smiles. On one day in particular, Harry saw Luna and introduced them. They hit it off; they were in the same house, only a year apart, and Mandy was bubbly enough to pull the best parts of Luna out, Luna cheering up Mandy. Harry saw them together in the corridors sometimes, and finally Mandy started smiling again.
He sat across from Draco and he moved the cake in front of him. “Happy birthday, Harry.” Draco whispered. He sang the song slowly and quietly, taking Harry’s hand and kissing it several times. Harry pulled Draco’s hand to him when he was done and kissed his wrist. He had half a mind to push aside the cake and blow out and eat Draco, but it was obvious that Draco had made the cake himself. He had put effort into it, so he wanted to try it.
“Are you paying any attention at all?” Draco asked wryly, and Harry jumped.
Ginny sighed wistfully. “Think I’ll ever find someone?” Harry wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close.
Harry blushed and waved her off. “It’s only been two couples, I don’t think that counts.”
Sirius realized that Harry still didn’t feel like the rest of the house was his too, after he noticed Harry bringing books and other belongings back to his room. He asked Harry about it, and a blushing Harry said he didn’t want his things in the way of Sirius. His godfather had growled and told him that he lived there just as much as him, and he could treat it however he saw fit. Harry suspected that he was just trying to get him to be more comfortable with leaving a book on the coffee table overnight, and he would actually have a problem if he started flinging clothes everywhere and made a genuine mess of things, but that was alright.
That hurt them more than anything. What’s the point of such a silly rule? Surely Draco would be burning their wrists every time he went home for the summer...
“Well I’m gay, for the record.” Draco drawled, sitting back, his eyes shining bright, taking Harry’s hand.
“This was a brilliant idea, Sweetheart. I love the way your mind works.” Draco panted before he leaned forward to kiss him. Harry took over the stroking, so Draco could support himself easier. He increased the pace a little, it had been too long since they were together, and he wanted to experience the ecstasy with Draco.
“Alright, what is this about?” Harry asked, feeling the beginnings of anger.
They repeated their actions several times, and each time, Harry felt his emotions start to calm. Draco started doing something with his wand, Harry wasn’t sure if he was summoning the glass figurines or creating them somehow, but the higher-pitched shatter was extra satisfying. Finally, Harry laughed, and the last figurine went unbroken as Harry hugged his fiancé for a long time.
“A test?” Harry blanched. He was doomed. “I bet I’ll fail, and they won’t even let me in.” His heart began to hammer away in his chest, he would have sat down if someone wasn’t at his feet still working on his robes.
Hermione shook her head. “It’s such a small house, and I don’t want to put Sirius out. This will be fine.” She said, becoming more doubtful the longer she spoke.
Draco snorted, but Harry reached his hand out for Draco’s, looking at Sarah. “A couple things, actually,” he said as Draco took his hand. “It’s this one’s birthday today, but it’s also our first real date away from school. We’re also got engaged a couple days ago, so I suppose we’re still celebrating that.” He smiled at Draco.
He was Harry. Harry was who he is. He was standing in the atrium of the Ministry for Magic. There were Death Eaters all around him in their dark cloaks, forming a loose circle, as if they were guarding something. There, ahead of him, was Voldemort, hand outstretched. “Hand it over, Potter.” He was saying.
Draco groaned. “Just give me some warning before you spring some insane scheme on me, alright?”
“How do you know all this?” The conversation was turning dangerous. If he needed to, he was prepared to tell them the whole and full truth, if Draco’s life depended on it. However, he knew that Draco didn’t want them to know yet, and he wasn’t keen on the idea of it either. It could go very badly very quickly, and he didn’t need to have a major distraction when Draco was in trouble.
The rest of the break passed without either of them seeing the other beyond tough words in the corridors. Hermione and Ron stuck to him like glue, making sure Harry never had an opportunity to sneak off. It was unintentional, Harry thought sardonically.
look that promised Harry he was about to experience a world of pleasure, but Harry wasn’t sure.
That appeared to not be how it was going to happen, however. His son closed his eyes, stuck out his chest, and said, “no.”
“I know you got my father arrested, Potter, and you’re going to pay.” Harry followed him out as he left.
Harry glared at her. “Oh! Draco Malfoy wasn’t at the very center of this? Whose plan was it? Who was forced into servitude? Who did the work?”
They continued kissing for a long time, feeling the joy of being close together. “I like that you’re marked as mine.” Draco whispered as he kissed the hickey.
“Yeah,” Harry said quietly. They stared at the gleaming silver and ruby, taking in the beauty of it.
“So that’s how you’re getting your money. Did Daddy cut you off?” Draco growled.
Harry paused, thinking. “That was the song about how she wasn’t in love with Hercules, right?”
He was absolutely flawless, pure white alabaster skin, perfection in a package. His white-blonde hair really complimented him. He was hairless on his chest, but he could see some on his stomach. He was more muscled than the other boys in his dormitory, being a quidditch player, and thinner too. He was long and lean, and Harry had never noticed how every part of him was like that, from his fingers to his toes. He looked absolutely perfect, standing there in a little black swim costume, a big smile completing the look, proud and assured in himself.
“Something’s wrong.” Harry said, knowing that his gut instinct had been right. Draco turned down the walkway for Knockturn Alley, and Ron and Hermione caught on to what was going on. They followed Draco until he got to Borgin and Burkes, where they heard him buy something, but not what.
“I suppose you could say that,” Draco said, smiling and shaking his hand. “Thank you for saying so, Victor.”
Harry grinned. “Well, I’d hate for you to drink alone, and I figured you’d like having a matching set, for when we have special occasions.”
Draco placed a kiss on the top of his head as he gently caressed his back. Harry finally looked up. “I’m sorry, that’s never happened in front of anyone.”
Draco wrapped his sticky hands around Harry and kissed his chest. “I like that you’re marked as mine.” Draco whispered as he kissed the hickey.
Previously: " Harry hugged Draco close to him; they were both shaking. "
Visiomagic was fantastic. It was like a muggle movie, only the cameras were enchanted to follow the players, displaying as if from the perspective of a player. It was interesting but jarring and honestly got dizzying after a while watching the wobbliness. Harry preferred the Omnioculars.
me! You know what? Screw ‘em! I don’t need them.” He threw the cup against the wall and it shattered into hundreds of pieces.
Moody had dragged him off just minutes after Harry had returned to the quidditch pitch with Peter Pettigrew clutched in his grasp. He had stunned and grabbed him, then summoned in the portkey cup.
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” they chorused. They opened presents much more sedately than they had in years past, but Harry opened a box that changed how he felt. In it, was a Firebolt.
“I did too. I could barely close my eyes.”
Harry nodded. “Alright.” Draco felt caution coming from the ball of energy. “Well, there’s nothing we can do about that now, why don’t we go back to bed?” Draco nodded, mind still on the problem before he caught up.
Ron wasn’t that curious about the note. He seemed to have adopted a ‘don’t ask’ to Harry’s ‘don’t tell’ policy.
“I’ll be there in a minute,” Draco muttered, trying to find the right place for a silk, periwinkle blue long sleeve shirt.
Previously: "Harry pulled his fingers through Draco’s hair. “I love you. Thank you for being born.”
Harry thought for a moment.
“Merlin Harry, sometimes you drive me mad. I asked what happened, when you disappeared earlier.” Sirius growled lowly, but Harry and Draco ignored him.
“I’m doing great. And you?”
“I’m alright, it’s just a scratch.” Draco said, face screwed up in pain.
“Is that a challenge?” Draco asked.
He would always love him. Always. And forever.
“They did,” Harry sighed. “My Aunt and Uncle, my mother’s sister and her husband, raised me. And they knew I was a wizard, but they purposefully didn’t tell me. Wanted to stamp it all out.” The last part was said under his breath, but he knew Draco heard him.
Hermione put her hand on Ron’s arm. “We weren’t ignoring you, Harry!”
The bed he was sitting on, here in the hospital wing, sank as Sirius sat upon it. Arms were wrapped around them. Sirius just thought he was upset about Dumbledore. He had no idea.
“I knew at least some of that was bribery money.” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
Draco laid there still. The spell couldn’t force the body to do things like fall asleep, but it came close. He could lie there, not thinking about anything in particular.
They stood there, slowly swaying and comforting each other. Then, there was a loud bark.
“Draco’s Father didn’t appreciate our friendship, so it’s very important that you not tell anyone about us. It could lead to him being punished, and trust me, a lot worse. I know you don’t want any student harmed.” Harry added.
“At least you were around, which makes it better than when I was at the Manor.” He placated honestly.
Murmurs of agreement were heard around the room, Harry nodding in agreement.
“They haven’t. But you might want to talk to them about it.” Sirius said gently. “They are your best friends, Harry.” There was some hurt in the Bond, coming from them both, though for different reasons.
Draco nodded.
Harry raised his head then looked back at Draco in near awe. He had noticed things about Harry that no one, not even Harry himself, had. He had thought about him, it sounded like he had for a long time. And he was telling Harry.
“But I don’t want to compete!” Had he not made that clear?
“Does this mean you don’t want my number?” The hostess asked as they passed her. She recoiled from Draco’s glare.
They were playing a little game where one would suddenly grab the other and kiss him, then walk away calmly without a word. It was enjoyable, but inspired growing retribution. Harry had Draco pinned against a wall behind an alcove, kissing and lightly sucking on his neck, when he heard footsteps, close by.
“Hopefully these kids will quiet down,” Draco mumbled to Harry.
Harry didn’t think about the boy once he was inside the bank, but less than an hour later, Hagrid left Harry at Madam Malkin's’ with a blush and a mumbled excuse. When Harry followed a helpful lady to the back where there was a fitting area, he was startled and happy to find the Blonde Boy there. It appeared he was happy to see Harry as well, for a smile stretched across his face, and although he looked condescending, it lit up his face enough Harry didn’t mind.
The screen kept going in and out, showing strange images. Harry was on his knees, holding his head as if in pain, then snow. Then, the camera picked up audio.
“I am appalled and disgraced to have heard about all my client, Mr. Peter Pettigrew has had to go through. And before even hearing his story, you are writing him off as a Death Eater! Why, he doesn’t even have the mark that all Death Eaters bear! He has been accused of some awful crimes, when all he was doing was trying to fight those forces of evil he stands accused of consorting with. It is a mockery of justice that he is even being tried in the first place. It is Sirius Black who has committed the crimes my client has been accused of, and I am going to prove it during these proceedings. I only hope the ladies and gentlemen of the Wizengamot will open their hearts to listen to my client. Thank you!” His voice was disgustingly slick, just as his hair. He had started out impassioned but got sadder and sadder the more his speech went on. Harry was amazed. Was anyone really buying that? He looked around, but the faces he saw were blank masks, similar to Draco’s.
“I don’t know!” Harry said, sitting up and hiding his face in his hands. “I don’t know, alright? This has never happened to me before. I’ve always been able to talk myself out of it. I don’t know why it freaked me out so much, but I promise I’ll work on it and next time you want to…to…”
“You know what? Let’s worry about that later. For now, let’s celebrate you winning the tournament.”
. “At first, I was so happy, but…I couldn’t let him walk out on his wife and child. So, I convinced him to go back to Tonks. Only, it was too late. She kicked him out and won’t take him back.”
“Think I can wash up with these bandages?” He asked. Harry summoned some plastic and placed it over the bandages with a temporary sticking charm. “Thanks.” Draco said, as he turned the shower on.
“Ron, it’s not a big deal, don’t worry about it.”
Harry sighed. “I never said I thought he was a Death Eater, I said it was weird when I saw him jump when my scar hurt. I just said I think he’s in trouble.”
Harry rounded the table, taking the seat rather hesitatingly. He and Dumbledore were on good terms for a student and Headmaster, but Dumbledore was still pretty intimidating. “First of all, you are very much welcome, Harry. I can honestly say it was my pleasure to fight for such a deserving cause. I never thought I’d live to see this day.” He added quietly.
Harry repositioned himself so he was in between Draco’s spread legs, moving them into a spread-eagle position. He summoned his favorite lube from the small collection in their bedside cabinet and warmed it lightly with his hand. Draco jumped as the liquid touched him, but he held his position. Harry could detect excitement and intrigue, with a whole lot of desire from within him.
Harry figured he should brush his teeth too. It was strangely intimate, doing a bathroom ritual together. They kept glancing over at each other and smiling, foam leaking from their mouths. Even so, Draco was still sexy and beautiful. He noticed that Draco brushed up to down, the weirdo. He wondered if Draco was taking in what Harry was doing, making note of their differences. He was, but Harry had no way of knowing that.
Draco shrugged lightly. “I have wanted to marry you for a long time.”
“Er, it may have been my bedroom, at the time.” Draco let out a small breath, like a whisper and closed his eyes. He withdrew his hand from Harry’s to hold his head in his hands, leaning forward, his elbows on his knees. Harry felt sick. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I –”
“I know, I get that this is a lot,” Harry said, trying to keep his patience. “You don’t have to be happy, but this is the way it is, the way it has always been.”
“Alright, alright. A couple songs, then dueling?” Draco nodded, and everyone hastened to find a partner.
“It’s alright,” she smiled tightly at him.
Harry’s neck almost cracked he moved to look at her so quickly. Her head was tilted to the side, her eyes squinted at him as if she could see the answer written across his face. He blinked, then looked down at his shoes, hanging in the air in front of him. He had already given the answer away, but…
“Yes. Not every family is sorted into the same house, but it’s common enough to share values that it’s reasonable to assume, unless your parents were already from different houses. What house were yours in?”
“I was wondering if you wanted to join a club, Harry.” She said. “Sally and I talked about starting up a union our fourth year, but it fell through, what with her leaving and all. Luna and I were talking about it over the summer, and we got permission from Dumbledore. Said it was a marvelous idea.”
They stayed silent as they walked, one block became two, then three, then so many Harry lost track. They made turns randomly, alright with getting lost. It wasn’t cold or dark yet, and it would’ve been more appropriate for their moods.
That thought made him have a strong sense of the injustice of the whole ordeal. In the grand scheme of things, with all the violence and murder in the world, homophobia seemed like a lesser crime. But in that moment, Harry was gripped with a sense that there was a lot more to it than senseless discrimination. It was looking at a person, and only seeing their skeleton. Not seeing the heart that beat blood into their veins, the lungs breathing air into the body, the nerves feeling every pinch and prod, the skin that registered every gust of wind. The brain that had individual and unique thoughts and emotions.
“I guess you’re rubbing off on me.” Harry blushed and stared forward, hoping Draco wouldn’t notice the innuendo that could be there. He missed Draco’s slight smirk in his direction, and because of that, his glaringly obvious acceptance of letting the joke go past without comment.
WARNING: You may or may not have noticed I added a tag. It's for a minor character death. I classify it as a minor death, not major, and you can probably guess who it is. I struggled with the death itself, this author's note, the scenes afterwards. I hate it when characters die, and I didn't take it lightly. I was so upset when I was writing it, and I hope no one takes it as badly as I did. The death is 'implied' in that it is not shown, if that helps. If this happens to be an issue for you, please let me know and I will do what I can to help.
Harry climbed into the chair, leg on either side of Draco, facing him. Draco moaned and hugged him close.
“So, he had help. Maybe his Father told him a way around the magic. Lucius Malfoy’s good with dark magic, I bet there’s loads of stuff he can do we have no idea about. Didn’t Moody say it was dark magic that was around the Goblet?” Hermione stared at Ron in awe.
Harry leaned forward to take his hand, stroking the top of it comfortingly. Draco took several deep breaths and looked at Harry as if his heart was breaking. “It means that I love you, and I want to be with
Harry placed a finger on Draco’s lips, shushing him. He took Draco’s hand and pulled him further into the room. He assumed the area outlined with jars was a makeshift dance floor. That would do for what he wanted. He pulled Draco into his personal space, wrapping his arms around his neck. Draco wrapped his own arms around Harry’s waist. It wasn’t a traditional pose, but then, neither were they. They swayed slowly back and forth for a couple seconds before Draco got his wand out. He pointed it in the direction of their table and an old-style radio filled music in the room.
“I still don’t know how you can always tell us apart, Harry.” He grinned at him, “it’s a talent only you possess.”
“Here, Babe.” Harry brought the potion over to Draco first, who took a small sniff without opening his eyes, smiled slightly and took a small gulp.
Draco frowned for a second before he giggled again and fell into Harry’s lap, looking up adoringly at him. “I have no idea. What are you talking about?”
Harry stared at the bottle, looking at the label, reading every tiny word before he took a sip. It was delicious. He bit his lip, not quite sure why he was suddenly choked up again.
Draco smiled and took his hand. They both looked around the room they had created together. It was stone walls, floors and ceiling, just like the rest of the castle. There were candles all over the room, and a fire was roaring in the fireplace, casting a very romantic glow throughout the room. There was a red carpet in front of the fire, a dark wood coffee table behind that, a black leather couch behind that, and a bed in the middle of the back wall. There were nightstands on either side, both them and the frame made from dark wood. The bedclothes were black as well, with gold and silver thin lines embroidered around the edges. There was a red plush blanket folded at the end of the bed, and that and the pillows looked very fluffy. Harry thought it couldn’t be more perfect.
“Great!” Harry had the urge to hug him, his arms even twitched before he controlled himself, looking down with a blush.
It was the Slytherin vs. Gryffindor match, and the Slytherins were playing dirty. They had just won the match, despite Harry being thrown from his broom by a rogue bludger when Draco landed pretty close to Harry. They had decided on having a fight the last time they saw each other.
Harry’s mouth opened, no noise escaping. Draco looked down, as if he was embarrassed to have confessed that. After confirming that, Harry cupped his cheek and steered his face in his own direction. “That’s so sweet.” He said quietly. “I understand, Draco. I want that, too. Tell you what, let’s get out of here, and go home, and the two of us will find the perfect song and we’ll dance however you’d like. I’ll even let you lead. How does that sound?”
“It has to be getting closer, how big can this damn place be?” Sirius asked, it was the eighth similar comment made since they had entered the passage. Harry sighed. He wondered if Sirius was just trying to distract him from his worry.
Harry loved having someone next to him while he slept. He had found that he could sleep better with Draco’s arms wrapped around him, or vice versa. The first time he had a nightmare, Draco woke him up before it got too bad, then wrapped his arms around him, talking quietly until Harry fell asleep again. He began having more and more as Voldemort began acting himself, and not occluding his thoughts. Draco also worked with him on his own Occlumency, so he was better able to deal with the outcome.
“No one who knows you thinks that. I don’t know why Weasley said all this like that.”
“This is very good.” Harry commented in slight surprise. He hadn’t found a wine he liked other than Moscato, and this was better.
Harry thought for a moment. “You can if you want, next time. After all… I am your slut.” Harry watched as Draco’s eyes darkened, he had whispered that last part huskily in his ear. He wasn’t prepared when Draco lunged at him, throwing him on his back as he placed himself on top of Harry.
“No, Mrs. Weasley, this is about me.” Harry said, but Mrs. Weasley was off with her next assumption.
“Seriously, Draco, the money is one thing, but the face Harry Potter will make when we win the match will be so much better. Let’s get in the sky boys!”
“Well, it

The boy feigns hurt, leaving them both in fits of snickers, Crabbe and Goyle just mutter something about not getting it. Understanding reaches them a few days later when they all walk into the Great Hall and are bombarded with flowers of every kind in pink, hearts hanging from the sky, and one imbecile in the middle, smiling like it actually looks good.
Draco grins, “I dunno why it occurred to me, but white strawberries are very good, I wanted to share.”
“Because if that’s the case,” Draco can’t stop himself from smirking. “You could always take Myrtle.”
Blaise doesn’t offer much comfort. “We all have.”
“Why haven’t you written back?”
Ron, just writing a letter to his friend:

Eyes linger over every scar, every cut, every bullshit thing he had endured the past few years. Draco rolls his eyes, “Did your mother take you to France after the blow up?”
“Hey,” Draco bumps into his side, “You’ve gone all quiet on me. It’s the smell, isn’t it?”
It should feel weird to shower together, but they’ve been doing it since they were kids, and Blaise has already seen his scars so he doesn’t think anything of it until Blaise catches his wrist and holds it up.

“Thought what? Who’s we? Theo, what are you talking about-”
Their shared water cup falls to the floor, shattering and spewing more filth. As the dust settles around them, Draco realizes she’s staring at him.
“Alert me if you find anything, Severus, I’ll keep looking, and you! Mr. Malfoy.”
And, naturally, everything feels wrong.
“Happy, are you?”

Some bloke named Tom’s diary, a boring old book with a boring old look that of course held a portion of You-Know-Who’s power. Slip it into one of his classmate’s bags and something called the Chamber, sounds a little bit like a weird club house, would be open, and though his father couldn’t place what kind of beast was inside it, he knew it wouldn't be pleasant. Leave it to Lucius to ruin what he thought would be a somewhat peaceful year. Couldn’t he just play Quidditch and mind his business? Keep watch every-so-often? Have nothing to report about his family other than his mother’s favorite tea set being broken? This whole ‘situation’ of his is quickly turning into a nightmare. But, given that he himself is a Slytherin, and self-proclaimed most cunning of them all, Draco will simply have to deal with this quickly.

He can see
William rolls his eyes, “We’re gonna train your mind stupid. You and that Harry Potter git.”
“Dragon, love, your flames will come out.” Pansy remarks, idly tying up her hair. Draco glares at her before relaxing into Harry, who still has a lot of questions.
“Twenty minutes.”
“And you’ll get it.” Sirius says calmly. “Under a few conditions. Tomorrow morning the papers with my cleared name will drop, I will adopt Harry and you won’t say a single word about it. When you hold order meetings, Narcissa, Lucius, and Belle will be invited. In addition, Harry and Draco will sit in on the meetings, keep your hair down, Narcissa. Harry is bound to be in the middle of whatever mess Riddle stirs up, and wherever Harry goes Draco typically is there to protect him anyways. Not informing them would just put them more at risk, and I refuse to make Harry hide in his own house.”
before drilling him with more Fun Facts about how he’s probably going to die. Harry doesn’t understand why they all have so little faith in him. He’s survived worse, a dragon seems fun. It’s at least new.

Draco can feel his teeth clench, looking around frantically for the idiot staring at a hanging cat with a scared look on his face. And then he sees Granger and Weasley beside him and he understands Potter’s fear. If a Slytherin made the chamber, his enemies would include muggle wizards, people who damaged the ‘pureblood’ name, someone exactly like Granger….A lump forms in Draco’s throat, if Harry is going to be at school during his father’s scheme, the least he can do is help protect those in danger.
Hedwig hoots like she agrees, but since it’s there Harry might as well start reading.

Dinner comes and goes much too quickly, which means he basically blinks and then he and Draco are standing in Myrtle's bathroom, an hour past curfew.

The island is stunning, just like it had been when he was little, Baia do Sancho off the coast of Brazil. Full of white beaches and clear waters that Draco once liked to watch fishes swim in. They owned a part of it, big enough for a house, a private beach, and land to hide if one of them needed to use some more….exaggerated magic.
Footsteps echo his, slightly off beat, like someone is walking behind him but he can’t see anyone. Not even a shadow. Draco palms his wand, slowing down and trying to think of

Luna finishes her button, there are only twenty more to go and it’s only nine. Sirius will be calling soon. “Do you want to know more about them, Harry?”
There’s a moment that he looks between them. His mother, kind and calm, tears threatening to spill from her perfect eyes, her chestnut hair still in the bun his father once told her was his favorite. His professor, still clad in black but not the robes that make him seem untouchable, rather a sweater Draco just knows is softer than LuLu’s fur. Both of them are nothing like other people know them to be.
“What are
They both roll their eyes at Blaise’s call, turning to look and watch as letters in the shape of two men merge together, twirling on a pearl white ceiling. One man turns to the other, a gentle voice recites something about love. The words come together for a kiss.
All that effort, all that strength just bounced right back off the door, sending him tumbling down the stairs and not even
Lupin nods, “Yes. You and Harry Potter. Quite some intriguing targets if you ask me, oh there’s no need to worry, Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure it was just a routine check for and fugitives, if you catch my meaning. I really should be off to see the driver now, do make sure to eat that, you’ll feel much better afterwards.”

He’s too shocked at the change in tactics to say ‘no’, so he ends up sneaking past the ghost that everyone avoids. Draco doesn’t get it, she’s really quite easy to handle, all you have to do is give her a smile and treat her like she isn’t worthless. Granted it was a shot in the dark, but he remembers Pansy talking about how lonely Myrtle is, and well. It doesn’t take much to put two and two together.
What was that thing Severus used to say all the time? Something about-
“I am the second choice here, understand? I was not supposed to be apart of this, and I refuse to sit here and listen to you degrade the true champions for an article. You want a few words for your paper? Think of them by yourself. The champions have a competition to win, and I have to be there to support them.”
“I’m sorry,” He tells her, figuring that he should probably let his boyfriend know that he’s alive

“Ebony wounds that don’t heal and Dementors that don’t make you faint? What exactly have you been up to this summer?”
As a matter of fact, she looks fucking furious. Like Draco when Harry nearly dies furious. It’s not a comforting sight, but at least he gets why Narcissa named his crush after a dragon now.
“The one we gave the candy to tried to push him down the stairs-”
Remus flushes, keeping his arm wrapped around Sirius and reminding himself that they are grown adults, not teenagers caught snogging in a broom closet. “Yes, well. We were um, rather busy.”
“Ronald.” Draco says, setting his tea down. “Why do you call my parents by their first names?”
“And then what? Would they have hidden their magic away? You remember the witch-hunts happening back then, James wouldn’t have endangered Lily like that, much less Harry.”
The pent up worry doesn’t uncurl from his gut until he sees Harry Potter the next day at breakfast, in the middle of the table with, thankfully, no injuries and a flustered Wealsey beside him. He tries to keep his irritation to a minimum, staring over his morning fruit with a somewhat murderous glare Pansy is surely making a face at. Friendly conversation distracts him from the Daily Prophet’s ‘exclusive’ interview with his lying father, but it’s much harder to ignore the front page where the flying car moves. Merlin, he’s going to
Pansy swats him on the arm, “Please, we both know your father will have your head if your grades are as bad as they were last year. At least try to make an effort, I hate to think about what might happen to you otherwise.”

Saturday.”
“Frodi Axel?” Theo giggles, “What type of name is that?”
Flint pats him on the back, “You know what? I think he did.”
The group laughs at that and Draco carefully steers the conversation back to their summers, hearing all the fun bits. Crabbe and Goyle spent much of it together, laughing and trying out new sweets, playing on brooms and trying to figure out their school work. Draco promises to help them once the year starts, Merlin knows they’ll need it. Pansy had taken a trip through Europe with her mother, shopping and tasting new foods, coming home to visit with Daphne Greengrass and her sister, Astoria, “Her family was so happy she had another Slytherin friend, they were worried about her being put in Ravenclaw, you know”. Blaise spent his summer with his current father in Germany, reading countless books. Apparently his mother had another affair while they were gone, a divorce was coming soon, paperwork already filed. “The new guy is okay, doesn’t really talk much, but he gave me a new book that the old one didn’t have, so I guess it’s fine for now.”
Given how

“Very well then,” Dumbledore puts down his books, “To answer your question I need to clarify that it was Severus who told you all these facts?”
Taking one last look out the window to make sure he is, in fact, not hallucinating the whole event, Draco turns on his heel and starts for his luggage. He'll need his head-pain relieving potion sooner than he thought.
Every single person in the room blinks.
The next morning Draco’s studying once again, which annoys Fleur to no end.
No one moves for an uncomfortably long time, so Draco takes it upon himself to break whatever trance they all got sucked into.
They can feel more than hear the giant sigh released, and it’s then that Harry remembers Fawkes clawing out the eyes, so he opens his and draws in a sharp gasp.
The notes Draco can forgive, but the crease on the page from being dogeared gets a harsh glare.
“Alright,” said Harry just as doubtfully. “Do you guys want anything to eat? We can check out the kitchen. Kreature is probably around somewhere.” Not that he wanted to call upon the elf.
Just as he was about to leave, Draco’s wand began vibrating on the nightstand. He breathed in and out deeply before blindly touching it to turn it off. Harry stirred but did not awaken as Draco detached himself from Harry. Albus smiled, invisible to him, as Draco leaned over Harry to whisper something in his ear before kissing his cheek long and lingering. Draco stood slowly, running his hand down Harry’s side before he departed, taking one last look before he disappeared behind the curtain.
“Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Draco.” He put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “We’ve been friends since before our first year, Sirius. His father doesn’t want me being friends with him, so we pretend we’re not, in public. When we’re away from the other students, who would gossip, and news would get back to Mr. Malfoy, we’re friends. I haven’t told anyone, except this girl I took to the Yule Ball, but she hasn’t said anything. Oh, and Madam Pomfrey caught us once, but she said she wouldn’t say anything either. Please don’t tell anyone. Draco’s my best friend. I don’t want to lose him.”
Mandy still couldn’t see anyone, but she had a feeling Sally had chosen the same bed she had at Hogwarts. In the left back corner, furthest from the door. Sally had run up to the dorms first back in first year so she could claim what she later confessed to Mandy was the safest bed. She told her that she liked having her back up against the wall. The memory brought forth sadness as well as a warm fond feeling.
As the occupants of the train calmed down, Draco leaned back against Pansy, settling his head in her lap at her insistent pull, triumphant expression on her face. Harry was shocked and enraged by the show and caught sight of a butterbeer on the window ledge. With a quick spell, the butterbeer exploded, aimed right at Pansy.
Draco nodded. “Yes. I won’t try to pull anything cheap, I promise.”
He had a lot more he wanted to tell him, and ask him, but he didn’t want to write much more than Draco had and annoy him. The letter writing had taken up a fair bit of the morning, so Harry had lunch at the bar with Tom before heading to the Alley. Draco hadn’t said to avoid Diagon itself, so he figured it was alright to go explore. Both times he had been before he had been escorted by others who were intent on shopping for school supplies only, though the quidditch store had been included. He was surprised by a lot of the things that were for sale, even things he hadn’t known existed.
Harry blushed, pulling the sheets to cover himself up as Draco snickered behind his hand. “What are you laughing at?” Sirius asked him, not turning to look, however. “That sheet is damn thin, I’m seeing a lot more than I want to.” Draco blushed. He pointed to his bathrobe on the back of the desk chair and Sirius handed it to him, pointedly looking at the ceiling. Harry took the opportunity to grab his own robe and put it on while Sirius was distracted.
“Wha—really?” Draco nodded solemnly and Harry felt a lump in his throat. “I really don’t want to kill anyone, not even him. I mean, I know…”
“I love you too, Sirius. You’ll come to my next one, right?” Harry said, feeling a little overwhelmed as he pulled him into a hug. Sirius squeezed him tightly, swinging him from left to right and back again.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed. “Kreature, you can stay if you would like. It must be lonely here all by yourself, isn’t it? Do you wish the Order was still coming?”
“No, there’s still wards preventing just anyone from entering. Someone already allowed inside would have to pull the other inside the wards, like you did with Draco at your parents’ house. But Snape would be able to tell them to go to Grimmauld Street and hang out.”
He rubbed the sleepiness out of his eyes, yawned, and reached for his glasses. After briefly bumping into Draco, he swam into view, gloomy in the darkness, but he could still see his silvery eyes shining.
He thought it might have been the thought of coming down Harry’s throat that set Draco off, because it was happening, and Harry choked, but kept his cock mostly inside. He swallowed as much of Draco’s pulsing cock as he could as he stilled, thrusted twice then stilled again.
He thought he had seen Dumbledore at some point. He must have, because he was carrying the locket, they had retrieved that night, only it wasn’t the locket they had intended. It was a fake. It had all been for nothing.
“Here is Mister Harry Potter’s dinner, sir! I also be bringing dessert, as requested. Can Dobby be doing anything else for Mister Harry Potter?”
“When did you figure it out?” Sirius asked, leaning forward and grinning.
It was a couple hours later when Draco finally entered the room again. “Hey,” Harry said, a bit distractedly when Draco greeted him. Draco chuckled and started packing again. “Do you need any help?” He asked, not looking up.
“Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry,” Mrs. Weasley appeared close to tears. “I was just so worried about Percy.”
They exchanged nervous looks as they waited for her to come back. She handed stained and ripped paper menus to each of them and returned to the back of the bar without a word or looking at either of them.
Finally, blessedly, Draco’s sobs quieted to harsh breathing, then quiet breathing, then soft snoring. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to comfort Draco, but he was very glad this part was over, if it was over. He really hoped that it was. He just didn’t want to see Draco go through so much pain. He’d be damned if he made Draco go through it alone, however.
He wasn’t sure how long he was staring out into the waves crashing onto the shore before he felt a presence behind him. The ball of energy in his chest thrummed, and he didn’t have to turn around to know that it was Harry before his toned and darkened arms wrapped around him.
Draco grinned rather manically. “Harry, goblin made silver takes on properties that make it stronger!”
“Oh, really?” Hermione nodded confidently. “And how much luck have you had?” Hermione deflated at that while Ron puffed up as he did when trying to prove himself.
“I like having my hair stroked. She’s about as close to a friend as I have. I know she wants more but she’s not going to get it from me, and I’ve made that clear to her. You are my one and only, Sweetheart. I would never betray you like that.” Harry sniffed, wishing he wasn’t tearing up. It was just the pain from his broken nose. Draco lifted one finger and placed it under his chin, pulling him towards him to meet his eyes. “I love you, you creepy sneak. How’s your nose? Is it broken?”
Harry pulled Draco a little closer to him, not that there was much room between them. “Should we hyphenate?”
Eventually, however, he had no choice. Draco had been bugging him about the second task insistently, and he was ready to do something just to shut him up. He figured since he was taking Cedric’s advice, he might as well do it in style, and decided to go to the prefect’s bathroom. Draco decided he would tag along and bought Harry a swimming costume when Harry used that as an excuse not to.
“No, but there’s not that much that’s known about them. I guess that’s a reason to do some more research.” He looked rather excited at the idea. Harry groaned theatrically. Draco just laughed at him and lifted their clasped hands to brush his lips across his husband's knuckles.
“Well, I think that is one thing passed. To make it official, all in favor?” Every hand in the room rose, and Mandy smiled, it was very happy, and Harry caught a glimpse of her previous self. “Excellent. This club is hereby renamed Hope’s Army.” They all applauded, and Mandy took her seat. “Next, I thought we could go around the circle, introduce yourself, if you feel comfortable with it you can talk about your sexuality, if you’ve had trouble with it, maybe any prejudice, against you, or something general about yourself, why you’re here. I’ll start.” She took a deep breath.
Harry reached his hand over and took the one Draco wasn’t using. Draco smiled at him, they were both pleased that they could openly show affection and comfort in front of another person.
“It’s not fair,” Draco took many, many times to complain as Harry slathered an aloe potion on his skin. “Why do I have to burn, and you don’t?” Harry’s snickering was punished, he was sure, by Draco demanding to not be touched while the potion took effect.
The next couple weeks went by in the same way. Draco was either late or completely missed their dates every Sunday. Harry was beginning to feel hurt as well as suspicious. He knew it was hypocritical of him to want to know what Draco was doing when he hid what he was doing from Ron and Hermione. He just knew there was something wrong, and it bothered him to the point of distraction.
Harry was upset that Gryffindor lost the match to Hufflepuff, even though Ginny caught the snitch. It set the tone for the next several weeks as Harry’s ecstasy after Valentine’s Day faded, though it fueled him memorably. His mood picked up when his article came out and had a whole slew of effects. Umbridge was furious and banned him from any future Hogsmeade visit, Harry was secretly pleased for the excuse. She also made it an expellable offense to have the Quibbler in possession, which ensured the whole school read it. Students were treating him like a person again, no one made fun of him. They were congratulating and praising him, which Harry didn’t love, but figured was preferable to being a pariah. The teachers all found ways of showing their support for him. Draco was a little upset that his father had been mentioned, afraid of the ramifications. Harry made it up to him until he was feeling better.
“…My father, he…” Draco cleared his throat. “He made it very clear that any sort of friendship would not be tolerated. I argued at first, and refused to sever ties, and threw tantrums. I wasn’t used to not getting my way. Father quickly became angry, I’ve never seen him like that and…” This time, Harry could tell he didn’t just need time.
“It’s an adjustable potions journal. There’s instructions on the back page, but there’s places for ingredients, instructions, and notes. Snape mentioned it’s pureblood tradition to have one of these for personal use, right? I didn’t overstep my bounds, did I?”
Harry was sure he was imagining it, but the more students came in, the more Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to twinkle, and the angrier Snape seemed to get. Finally, Dumbledore declared that it was all hearsay at this point and no punishment would be given. Harry let himself feel elation as Snape stomped off, but it evaporated at Dumbledore request that Harry stay.
“Keep her in there.” Harry said quietly as he unraveled the invisibility cloak, just in case. As they were still sneaking towards the front door, a floorboard under Harry’s foot creaked.
They walked up to each other and stood about a foot apart, neither knowing where to start. It was awkward, they hadn’t been alone since Draco’s teary confession.
“I was disappointed we weren’t able to hang out more this year,” Cedric said. Harry nodded. “I was a bit more preoccupied with my studies than I had intended, I didn’t mean to ignore you.”
“’Tis no trouble, sir!” Dobby squeaked before popping away. Harry sighed. Draco hadn’t moved once since laying down, facing away from Harry.
One of the first things Draco highly recommended doing that Ragran had scowled over was making a will. Harry was hesitant, so Draco told him to think about it, which Harry took as code for he’d try to convince Harry later.
When he woke, and he wasn’t sure he had fallen asleep, he was in a white room, the hospital wing. “Harry.” A voice called to him, and he looked over to see Dumbledore. He looked even more tired than Harry felt. He sat up despite his protesting body. “Harry,” Dumbledore repeated. Harry stared at him, his head still wasn’t quite clear. “I’m so sorry, Harry.” Harry was surprised and confused to see tears forming in his not twinkling, blue eyes.
Draco started rocking him side to side and Harry tilted his head back to kiss Draco’s cheek. That rule didn’t apply to Draco. He found him beautiful and he understood him.
"Ew," Draco whispered, drawing Harry's attention back to him. "Harry, look at these! I've never been more happy to be gay." He was levitating a pair of bright pink, huge, lacy knickers. "I bet these will fend you off from women for life."
Draco didn’t respond for several minutes.
“You’re quite the matchmaker, Harry.” Hermione commented.
Previously: " Harry smirked, and Draco recognized it as one of his own. The strange ball of energy expanded slightly, and he was feeling lust that didn’t originate from himself.
“I’m sorry it took so long. I should have come back sooner.” He kissed Draco’s cheek in apology. “Is everyone alright?”
Harry laughed, some small tears escaping from his eyes. What a question. If it, when it, had been asked even a couple minutes previously, he hadn’t been. Now, though…
Draco looked up and smiled. “Sure, just let me get rid of my entourage and follow me.”
“You have to go?” He asked as Harry made his way to the door.
Draco hummed. There was more silence, and Harry’s thoughts went to Dumbledore. He had to admit, losing Draco had been more traumatic than Dumbledore. He had thought about Dumbledore over the last couple days, particularly at his funeral, but he had mostly been thinking about Draco.
“Your trunk, my king.”
“No, but I can’t miss this. Are you sure I can’t talk you out of it?”
He moved closer and stood still right next to the Christmas tree and listened in horror to the conversation unfolding in front of him.
“Dumbledore made it into a bit of a historical landmark. No one’s allowed inside, but you technically own it now, so the wards should recognize you if you want to go inside.” Sirius said quietly. Harry closed his eyes.
He tried to enjoy the ride, but the hand being squeezed distracted him. Thankfully, the ride wasn’t that long, and they were pulling up to the little hut where they would get off. “Are you ok,” he called to Draco, but he didn’t answer. Harry sighed internally, that was a good sign.
Draco sighed wistfully. “Not this summer, Sweetheart. I want to live with you as soon as we graduate, though.”
Draco blinked. “Sure, if that’s what you want. You know I don’t mind, right? It’s just going to be you and me.”
“Alright then.” Draco nodded. Harry looked at him, considering. He really wanted to see if Sirius was ok with them being together, as well. He still couldn’t make up his mind, however. He was a little afraid of Sirius being homophobic, and a boy being with his godson might tip the edge of the scale, and forbid Harry from Draco, or ensure that Lucius found out about them. That would be cruel, and Harry couldn’t see Sirius reacting like that, but Harry couldn’t shake the fear.
“We’re not engaged Harry, calm down. I think fourteen’s a bit young to be even thinking about it, don’t you?”
“I was just leaving, Professor.” He said. She nodded, and he pulled his arm off of Harry.
The Summer before his third year was a remarkable improvement from the year before, if a bit too exciting, for once. His not-blood-related Aunt came to visit and in a fit of rage, he blew her up like a balloon. Still furious, Harry left for the Leaky Cauldron, and managed to call the Night Bus after a dog spooked him. He made it, only to be caught by none other than the Prime Minister for Magic. He was rather nice, however, and let Harry off with two warnings. One, an official one for blowing up his Aunt, and two, not to leave Diagon Alley. Harry had no need to venture out into Muggle London, so he was just fine with that.
if I left people out.”
“That? That was nothing, give me some more.” Harry kissed him longer this time.
Draco visited again, as much as he felt he could get away without suspicion. The last time he did, Harry’s friends had arrived unexpectedly, and Harry had practically thrown him out, at first. He was suddenly questioning just what his place in Harry’s life was. Then, just as quickly, Harry had put him first, saying his other friends could wait. It went a long way towards convincing him that he was special special, but something was still holding him back.
He felt like a total wimp for asking for reassurance. Draco’s features cleared of the disappointment that had been there for a moment vanished.
“I did it!” Came ringing around the courtroom. In the ensuring silence, Pettigrew sounded louder. “I betrayed Lily and James! I sold them out to the Dark Lord! I gave him secrets that resulted in deaths, we could have lost the war because of me! And I killed those muggles, Sirius was innocent! I sought out the Dark Lord, and I resurrected him! I did it, all of it!” Pettigrew went on, as Fudge banged his gavel, as the Aurors let Harry go, as people traded looks.
“You also don’t want to at the same time.”
He couldn’t help but wonder if this was another attempt on Dumbledore’s life. He didn’t bring it up with Draco, not wanting to make him feel badly.
The next time he saw Mandy, she had tears in her eyes. It took several more weeks before he saw her smile again. Luna happened to be with her, talking together, when he saw it.
“What day is that, sir?” Harry asked, after a moment.
“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go.” Fred winked. What turned out to be festive cheer was a map that showed where anyone was at the school. It was an incredible bit of magic.
He touched my hand earlier, that might mean he wants me to…
What would she look like? Would she have black hair like Harry’s, or blonde, like Draco’s? Or maybe she would have red hair like his mother. What about her eyes? What would her name be? What would she be like? Would she be adopted, and nothing like them, at least physically, or be the result of surrogacy, having the genes of at least one of them?
I've never been to Thorpe Park, but it is a real place- I looked online and got as much information as I could. If anyone has been there and noticed a mistake, please let me know.
“No,” Draco agreed. “I know you love me more than anyone in the world, Harry. I love you just as much.” They mutually stopped their progress, facing the other and taking another hand. Harry’s nerves and erratic emotions were put on the back burner. He could still feel them, but they were distant, as if someone else were feeling them. In their place was the peace and serenity that came from feeling love. As he stared deeply into Draco’s silver eyes, he suddenly couldn’t wait to make the man standing in front of him his husband.
“I don’t expect that—”
It was Winter break, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione had just attempted an undercover mission involving Polyjuice potion, cat hair, and chocolate cakes. They were overall somewhat successful, finding out that Draco Malfoy wasn’t the heir of Slytherin, but Harry had already known that. The whole thing was a pretty big waste of time in his opinion, but he had been unable to talk Ron and Hermione out of it, and he figured it would be easier to participate than to refuse to.
Draco went first and arrived at the Ministry in a dignified manner, though not as much as he would have if he were acting as himself. He looked around hidden by the motions of brushing off the ashes from his cloak. When he assessed that there was nothing seriously…dangerous, he sent happiness through the Bond, and Harry departed as well.
They both scoffed. “You didn’t talk to him about Regulus, we asked him. If you were there, why didn’t you talk to him?”
“Well, I won’t be ready any time soon.” Harry promised. Sirius shook his head.
“That’s a wonderful idea, Mr. Malfoy. I’ll escort you to make sure this one doesn’t try anything.” She gave Harry an evil grin Harry wanted to slap off her face.
They had been staring at it for just a couple minutes when a group of Slytherins approached, with Draco in the middle being the loudest, it sounded like he had just told a joke. His eyes widened then narrowed when he saw Ron standing there, seemingly alone, but he had to know Harry was standing nearby under an invisibility cloak.
“He is, and he sure better remember it.” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. He was blushing ever so slightly.
“That doesn’t matter!” Draco almost yelled, “it’s none of your business what goes on in my home, Potter. And we would have let him go if we knew he was spilling family secrets, but you tricked my Father into it, didn’t you? That’s a dishonor against me, personally, and I bet you don’t even know that, because you’re clueless about Pureblood Tradition. You know what, this isn’t working, Potter, just stay away from me.” And with that, he stormed out of the room.
“Yes,” the compartment collectively answered. Harry shook his head.
George shook his head. “No, it’s anyone who’s dating a bloke.”
“Oh! Hi, Luna,” Ginny called to a girl in the hallway. Harry was honestly somewhat glad. He didn’t fancy being alone with her.
Draco was successful first. “There’s something here,” he exclaimed excitedly. Harry rushed over just as the painting swung forward, reminding him of how the Fat Lady’s portrait would. There was a small hole behind it, and it was filled with galleons, gems, a golden goblet, and pieces of parchment.
“Does it matter? The information is solid, I promise.” Hermione’s eyebrows raised, “look, we just don’t have time to get into everything right now. I need to be coming up with a plan, and you two are holding me back from that. I need an answer now, are you in or not?” There was silence for a beat. “It’s fine if you’re not, I understand you not wanting to risk anything for,” Draco, “Malfoy. I just need to know one way or the other. What’ll it be?”
Harry grips his hands that have somehow ended up on the boy’s shoulders, “I’ll be back, promise.”
“What do you mean?” Draco whispers back.
A moment of shuffling later and Draco finds himself recounting all of Harry Potter’s stories through out the years and agreeing rather aggressively with every ‘what the fuck’ that comes out of his cousin’s mouth.
There is, however, Misty, who’s dragging him inside.
Draco shakes his head.
And then the common room door creaked open.
“Sir!” Blaise greets him, “Did you talk them out of it?”

This dining room is very different from the one at the Manor. It’s smaller, filled with plants and windows that overlook the sea. The table itself is round, feels closer and more like something a family would eat at. Instead of thirty chairs there are only five.

On the plus side, he spent his free period practicing the ‘correct usage of minor healing spells’ with Pomfrey, no,
“Arthur?” Sirius asks.
Draco’s trying so hard not to laugh. “I don’t take Riddle as a candle man.”
Eventually three little, blue glowing balls join them in the room.

Three books seem to call out to him, interrupting the peace and happiness he’d been reveling in. Since the nagging feeling won’t go away, Harry rolls off his bed and walks over to it, snagging the three that are demanding to be read, and plopping them on his coffee table so he can get comfortable on his maroon reading couch.
Blaise and the Weasleys only make fun of him a little bit.
“Bad chakly?”
“Come on, love. You’ll feel better once you’ve showered.”
“Not as much as you’ll miss your throat should you keep speaking.”
Molly comes storming through seconds later, frantically shouting Arthur’s name.
The group around them starts to gather their things, wands are collected and Sirius is forced to swear something about not hurting anyone to Severus who also curses Lupin up and down and threatens to have him removed from the grounds. Hermione steps in to point out that Weasley is still hurt and it’s almost lost over Pettigrew’s screams for mercy.

“A brief case?”
It’s quiet in the headmaster’s office, despite three people and one Phoenix being there. The paintings say nothing, the sorting hat is out of quick remarks, even the fire has calmed it’s cackling. Their tea is growing cold, but Draco can’t find the will to reach for it. Snape’s cup sits untouched besides his, and after a long moment, Dumbledore takes a deep breath and the quiet is shattered.
“Mother!”

Harry ignores their laughter and Ron’s annoyance in favor of starting the next letter.

especially if he could use the chance to lure them to the light side. And if he goes with Astoria, Harry can take Luna. That’s like three birds, one stone. Perfect.
Snape gives him a look, “Foe-glass? You have to actually dislike your ‘foe’ for it to work.”
“Shut
“You promised me you wouldn't tell!”
No, no he has not. Partly because he wanted to make sure it actually works, and also because he has tea scheduled with the man at two. It’s the first time they’re both had a free moment to enjoy, and Draco’s very excited to have time with his godfather, but fate has other plans because he walks in to find Ellios and William sitting on Snape’s love seat.
Which makes sense because it is rather cold.
A few seconds pass and it’s then that he realizes
The two at his table stiffen. Weasley glares. “I swear if you do anything to hurt him-“
She doesn’t spare him a glance, fully focused on his father. “You will tell me why you harmed our child- my child.”
Theo chuckles at him, but he does end up staying for dinner. Somehow, Draco blames it completely on Misty, he even ends up staying the night.
“Careful, you wouldn’t want to speak Latin until tomorrow, would you?”
Theo. I couldn’t live with myself if he got to all of you. It’s-it’s bad enough that Greg and Vince-”

Stay safe, stay protected, and stay informed. I love you all so very much and hope my writing can be of use to you.
Winds from the sea push him back, he takes out his wand.
Draco groans, rolls until his face is completely in his pillow so he doesn’t have to deal with their smiling faces. The past week has been quite possibly the longest week of his life.
Narcissa shakes her head, “No, darling, I have a tight hold over his mind right now. I’ve put him to sleep.”
“Your version of relaxing is still more anxiety-inducing than a Death Tournament.”
“Goodnight, Theo.”
Harry exits the room silently, guilt nearly eating him alive.
“Settle down.” Snape draws out, and even though he’s terrified of looking into the man’s eyes he does. Nothing is in them, except relief buried so deep Draco almost misses it.
“Now, now, Sirius.” Narcissa grabs his arm, the lights get a little brighter. Oops, he didn’t mean to do that, “Albus, you and I both know how your reputation is fairing, I think it would be wise-”
“Do you know why blood contracts are rarely used anymore?” Narcissa smiles coolly from her cup of tea.
The flashbacks come next, nailing him to the spot as he thinks of all the other times he’d seen it, of what this

“I don’t care. Let him wake, at least then we’ll know if he has any internal damage.”
“Exactly. There are

Harry laughs, Hermione shakes her head and then Sirius clears his throat. He doesn’t have to say anything for Draco to pull the muggle-born away and engage her in conversation so they wouldn’t have a chance to eavesdrop.
They make their way back to the living room. Salem comes out from wherever he was hiding, approaching them cautiously as Draco rummages through his bags.
No. No he did not because he was very concerned about his father, and getting to talk to Harry, but she doesn’t need to know any of that-
“Tell us, Harry, who’s your next victim? Gonna switch it up and go for a pureblood?”
“Her full name is Parvous Lumen Malfoy, but that’s a mouthful and she likes LuLu much better.”
He knows that voice. He’s heard it a lot in his probably cursed life. That last time he heard it was when his boyfriend’s dad lost his arm, and he was hoping that he’d get a few months before he heard it again.
“Yeah? I was drowning, so he just stuck his thumb in my mouth I guess.”
“Nonsense, Draco, that’s just a side effect of having a friend who’s always on some sort of suicide mission.”

Pansy has the decency to look slightly ashamed, “My father came across it in a case a few years ago when a man murdered his wife.

Pansy rolls her eyes, looking longingly at Millie’s book like she might snatch it away just so she doesn’t have to participate in the same conversation they’ve been having for the past hour. It would work as annoying if she wasn’t muttering ballgown ideas to herself in the hallway.
Someone to care about, to protect, to align with no matter what. Someone to look to when things get bad, someone who knows limits and expectations and still offers happiness so sweet it leaves a sour aftertaste.
doesn't want his ice cream to melt. Then he moves onto stocking the coffee and tea cabinet, putting out paper towels, the knife set he bought that he sharpens with a few cutting spells; shoving wooden cutting boards, his new copper kettle, various cooking necessities that were shoved on him from a sales assistant, and lastly the bakeware into their respective cabinets.
“Like…” Fuck, how did he word this? “Like my mother. Her and I laughing and dancing on Christmas mornings. Or my friends, Pansy and Blaise, and the small moments we share that just
He doesn’t? That’s cool. But, to be fair, that’s probably because of Ra. Should he tell her that? Is it really important?
Harry wants to protest, but he
How the hell are we-”
Hermione’s calming brown eyes come into view. Something is gripping tight on his shoulder. “Harry. Look at me. Stay with me, okay?” Something grips at his shirt, a solid weight runs trails on his back. “Can you breathe in?”
Harry laughs despite his current position.
Harry badly hides a snort at that, and yes, Ron does elbow him in the side for it, but in his defense he can’t believe he’s allowed to have a sleepover
Mrs. Daisy gives him a look, but she still refuses to let him pay so Draco’s totally in the clear.
During the night it seems black, but it’s really a dark navy. Giant fish jump out and try to reach the moon. It’s full….he wonders if Lupin is doing okay. The sea winks at him like some type of dark abyss. He doesn’t notice the chill until another blanket is added.
She grins a little too evil-like and he decides that she needs more sleep than any of them.
harry: *comes in crying*
The giant looks like he wants to argue, but there’s no point in resisting Dumbledore, so he turns and goes. Madam Pomfrey bustles over to her medicine cabinet, giving Dumbledore the chance to lean closer.
“Hmm. I like presents.” Draco mumbled as he joined the land of the living. Harry kissed him. He loved him so much. “I like that too,” he said, as he licked his lips.
“Damn,” he said again. “We’re pretty high up. We might be able to use a cushioning charm, or a feather light charm, but I’m not sure it would be good with Draco’s injuries.”
Draco again broke the silence. “I’ve been wondering something for a while. Do you mind if I ask you something?” At Harry’s nod, he continued. “In Madam Malkin’s, you told me that you weren’t used to ‘all this’ and I just wondered what you meant by that.”
Draco stretched as he stood, his arms descending to wrap around Harry’s neck. “Uh-huh. Was it just me, or did we both not feel alright until the other one did as well?” It took a second for Harry to process that question, but thinking about it…
Harry raised his brows. “You realize it’s winter, right?”
“What, do you think I’m just going to leave it lying around?” Her fierce glare was back, and she crossed her arms as if personally offended.
Hermione pulled him, and they were off before his nausea could catch up with him. It was dark and confusing on the way to the woods. Mr. Weasley instructed the younger lot to get to the woods and stick together while they went to help the ministry.
Professor Snape hummed. “Well, isn’t that just
Harry thought this was the best way it could have happened. He undressed quickly, with Draco sitting along the side facing away from him. He was leaning his head back, eyes closed when Harry slid in. Harry made his way slowly to him, trepidation in every muscle.
“Write them down, I’m sure they were the ones taken,” Professor Snape shot another look at Hermione.
“It rather sounds like he was.”
On his way back to Dumbledore’s office, he ran into Draco as he had hoped he’d be able to. “Come in here, quickly,” Harry said in a rush as he grabbed Draco and pushed him into the empty classroom. “I ran into Trelawney, and she said there were people celebrating in the room of requirement. I think that something might be happening tonight, and Dumbledore’s leaving. I want you to be ready to leave. And take this.” He held out the Felix Felicis, but Draco merely looked at it.
Draco smiled. "So what if they didn't get along? We fight all the time. Who knows what would have happened if you hadn't come after me and demanded to be my friend all those years ago? We could have been enemies throughout all our years of school. Maybe we would have been like them and gotten together later. I'm personally glad for how we turned out, and I'm sure they were too. What's really bothering you?"
Harry placed the mirror face down and kissed the top of Draco’s head. “I’m sorry, Baby.” He said into Draco’s hair.
“You did what?”
“You are very welcome. It was definitely all my pleasure.” Harry smiled and pushed his nose into Draco’s neck, breathing him in.
“I’m intrigued.” Draco commented, pulling on his jeans. “I would love anything that you would call selfish. I can’t wait to see what you have in store.”
“Harry Potter.”
you. I love
Harry sighed as his eyes slid upwards for the third time in about a minute. His stomach felt like it lifted for a moment as he took in the sight. Draco had a lock of hair that was ever so slightly out of place. Under normal circumstances, his hair was brushed back with gel, the comb marks distinguishable. He had been so frustrated by Harry that he had started running his hands through his hair and messing it up. Harry wished he could run his hands through it and botch it up further.
“What time is it? How long was I out?” Draco moved his hand up and down his arm.
He changed into them, admiring himself in the mirror across the room before he turned to the other present. He opened it even slower than he had the first, savoring the anticipation. He even closed his eyes as he pulled the paper away, waiting for the last second. It was a small box, with a note on top.
“It’s a symbol in the muggle world for gay pride.”
Just when Harry thought Draco was calming, more sobs erupted. Harry rubbed his back and kissed his head. He was a little out of his depth. He wasn’t quite sure what to do for Draco, he wondered if Draco had these moments when Harry was upset or if he knew exactly what to do every time. It felt like it was the latter, but Harry had a feeling it was the former.
His thoughts were interrupted by a hand on his shoulder. “I know, better than anyone, how tough it can be. I’m dreading telling my parents, they already don’t like that I’m a witch. They’re god-fearing muggles with warped views,” she explained at Harry’s curious look, “and I’m sure they’ll have a problem with it. But at the end of the day, I’m their daughter, and I know they love me. I’m sure that whatever problem you’re picturing won’t be as bad as you think.”
Draco walked silently, the only sounds were from Crabbe and Goyle Seniors, one in front, one behind them. It was absolutely disheartening to be led about in his own home. The main parlor was where they were headed, he could tell by the layout. There were Death Eaters everywhere, some were standing guard, others joined their rag-tag group as they moved further and further into the Manor.
His face slowly broke into a smile. Finally, something had gone right. His life had been one disaster after the next, usually a confrontation with Voldemort or his followers happened at the end of the year, but not this year, this year, he had escaped from even having to do that. He wondered if Voldemort could feel his triumph, because he was certainly feeling it very strongly.
“There’s no way he can be that bad of a bloke.”
“It is. The bloke who made the movies invented theme parks, too.”
. The third, he got on the stairs leading out of the castle.
The day of Hogsmeade arrived rather gloomy. Regardless, Ron and Harry had a rather nice day until they got to the shrieking shack.
“Well, that’s the point, you’d have to get creative.”
“—In my house!”
He had no idea where he was, except that he somewhat did. He didn’t need to look at the Marauder’s Map to know where Draco was. He wandered, but with purpose. He stood outside the door for a moment before opening the door fully.
Harry turned his face to Draco. “We should try your portkey.” He told him. Sirius’s eyes lit up, but Draco frowned in confusion.
“Draco’s alive.” Harry told him, about to burst if he didn’t. Sirius blinked several times, before a hopeful smile blossomed onto his face as well.
school? I’m sure McGonagall will make an exception for you when you need to leave if she knows the alternative. And education truly is important. If my scores hadn’t been as good as they were, I probably wouldn’t have been able to find a good job. I want you to remember that this war is only temporary, and after it ends you will need to get a life. You can’t live off your inheritance forever.”
Something fell in front of him. It was white and heavy, and exploded on impact, small bits of stone hitting the hand Harry had raised to protect himself. He had no idea how he was still alive, it made absolutely no sense.
“I’d like diamonds and emeralds. Actually, would it be possible to match this one with a couple key differences?” He pulled Harry’s hand to the counter, showing off his engagement ring, and pointed out how he wanted his to be different. The man’s eyebrow raised. He looked once between them, then smiled and nodded, taking notes on the paper.
“Was that necessary?” He asked Draco, pulling the table closer to them.
He was very close to just going to the Leaky Cauldron, like Draco had suggested. He just knew someone would find out about his situation, however, and it was the same problem as telling someone what was wrong. Whoever he told would look at him strangely, and then other people would find out, and he would be a freak again. He hated that feeling, more than anything else, so he didn’t let people find out.
Draco was much more graceful. He raised a sculpted eyebrow. “I’m not sure that would be a good idea, Blaise.”
Harry leaned up to kiss him fully. “You are my husband.” He told him. He felt lighter than air. He was so happy, nothing could ruin this for him.
“Great,” Harry said, hoping he hadn’t just made a large mistake.
He finally managed to make it upstairs to some relative peace and quiet, where he found Ron curled up on his bed, reading a magazine.
“How are you doing, baby?” He asked as Draco’s face was revealed to him. Draco looked drunk he was so relaxed.
It was Harry’s turn to frown, “Not much. I know about Voldemort,” Draco flinched. “And that my parents fought him, and that he killed a lot of people, but that’s about it.”
The two caught up, as much as Harry could, as the Weasleys filtered in, Ron and Hermione noticeably absent. Occasionally, one of the other Weasleys or Sirius would interject with a comment, but Harry and Ginny quickly built up a joking rhythm.
“I want to mark you,” Draco said, Harry knew he wasn’t seeking permission. “Because you’re mine, and mine alone.” He started sucking little spots all over Harry’s back. Harry jumped when one of them happened upon his spine, he was apparently extremely sensitive there.
“She has?”
“Unfortunately, men’s rings are not quite as designer as ladies’. If you don’t like what you see here, we also custom make rings.” Harry and Draco exchanged a glance before nodding at him.
“Thank you,” Harry said, and held out his hand. Cedric shook it, and said he hoped he could still write to Harry. Harry agreed, and they departed. Harry was confused why Hermione ducked into the compartment as he came back.
As he was just hovering there, waiting, Draco wrapped his limbs around him, saving one hand to pull his chin up. Harry was struck, again, how beautiful Draco was, how big the moment was, how much he wanted this. He saw it all reflected back in Draco’s eyes.
“I am tasking you with a very coveted mission. Many of my Death Eaters have failed. I expect that you shall be better than all of them. You shall succeed where others have failed. Do I make myself clear?” Draco waited. “You shall kill Albus Dumbledore.”
Harry opened his mouth as he struggled against his captor, who had his arms pinned, but before he could, the hood was pulled back.
Harry was silent for a moment, then words were pouring out of his mouth, and he absolutely did feel like talking. He told Draco everything he had seen, every detail of how he felt. How his father had played with him and his mother had fallen right in front of him. He would pause occasionally, lost in his thoughts, and Draco would give him his time to continue. Once he was done with what had actually happened, he started on the nightmares he had that night and every spare feeling. Draco would squeeze him tighter, give him small kisses, run his hand soothingly down Harry’s arm or back as Harry talked.
“Well, let’s get out the books.” Hermione said with forced cheerfulness “I’m sure we’ll find R.A.B. soon.” They were quiet as they hit the books. For the next couple hours, the only sounds in the room were the pages flipping and intermittent tapping when one of them got bored before Hermione glared them into quiet again.
Harry was in the middle of wondering how many times he would be able to see Draco over the school year when the train came to a sudden, lurching stop.
Harry left the room slowly, happening to be next to Cedric. He was lost in his thoughts, so he startled when Cedric spoke.
He sat up, and grabbed Harry’s face, taking three heartbeats to look at his beautiful face. For some reason, he couldn’t speak, and was somewhat choked up, so instead, he leaned forward to kiss Harry.
Harry was infuriated that Draco would bring the Weasleys specifically into their fights. In the past it had been vague, but this was too explicit.
Harry frowned. “Did it feel different?”
“No, it’s not. Can’t a bloke just be happy to be going to school?”
“Why not?”
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, thinking he should probably be a little offended.
Harry blushed. “Definitely. Isn’t this a little, I don’t know, teenaged?”
Malfoy flushed in anger. “Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.” He said dangerously. At his anger, Harry felt his start to melt away. It was still simmering, but he was already regretting his insult.
“Wait!” Draco said, again desperately. His hand moved to Harry’s shoulder. “I know you’re both angry and upset, but you can’t throw away six years of friendship just for me. Think about all the things the three of you have been through. Things that I have no idea how you dealt with. What about first year, and you fought a troll together? Or battled through a maze of obstacles set by crazy teachers to get the Philosopher’s Stone? I wasn’t there for any of your crazy adventures. It was just the three of you, don’t abandon Harry because he made a new friend. Take some time and think about this, because it may be the biggest mistake of your life. Please, don’t put Harry through losing you.”
He had a hard time not skipping and whistling on the way back to the Common Room.
“Okay…” Harry said slowly, trying to figure out where Draco was going with that.
“Yeah.” Harry said, “it might take a while though.”
“Did you have a crush on me?” Ron asked, looking both horrified and curious at the prospect.
“I’m causing a scene? No,
Draco gasped and covered his mouth a couple times throughout the movie. He tilted his head in confusion, and whispered to Harry how amazing this experience was. He ate the popcorn blindly, and leaned forward as if that would help him hear better.
“They’re just, not very useful, are they?” Zacharias Smith asked when Harry raised a brow at him, being the loudest moaner. “It’s not like we’re going to be using them against Death Eaters.”
Harry sat back and groaned. He suddenly couldn’t focus on work. A quick fly would help clear his head.
Harry felt some of the tension in his shoulders release, and he wrote a quick note before he apparated straight to his bedroom.
They grinned back. Harry took the moment to kiss Draco on his cheek again. The movement pulled on his arm, and he remembered that Hermione still had a hand on his arm.
“I don’t know.” Harry said, frowning, “but it makes sense that it would be him. Who else do we know who was with you, knowledgeable of potions and poisons, and he did like you some years ago? He made an unbreakable vow to your mother, maybe the terms still applied.”
*** Present
“Speaking of bets, I suddenly remembered that bet we made a couple months ago, we never collected on it.”
“Sounds good,” Harry said, taking a deep breath of the sea air. He couldn’t believe he was standing on a place that had so much family history. He hadn’t thought about his ancestors much past his grandparents, but being here made him wonder about them. Had the men passed on the Potter hair? What had the women passed down? He wondered if there were any pictures in the cottage and took a glance back at the inside.
“You can. Look, you’re going to be a Potter soon. I think my Dad would’ve wanted you to have it.”
“I’ll join you in just a minute,” Draco called to him. Harry nodded and closed the door behind him.
“I am appalled and disgraced to have heard about all my client, Mr. Peter Pettigrew has had to go through. And before even hearing his story, you are writing him off as a Death Eater! Why, he doesn’t even have the mark that all Death Eaters bear! He has been accused of some awful crimes, when all he was doing was trying to fight those forces of evil he stands accused of consorting with. It is a mockery of justice that he is even being tried in the first place. It is Sirius Black who has committed the crimes my client has been accused of, and I am going to prove it during these proceedings. I only hope the ladies and gentlemen of the Wizengamot will open their hearts to listen to my client. Thank you!” His voice was disgustingly slick, just as his hair. He had started out impassioned but got sadder and sadder the more his speech went on. Harry was amazed. Was anyone really buying that? He looked around, but the faces he saw were blank masks, similar to Draco’s.
“It’s a great and personal challenge,” he said sarcastically, even in his sleepy state, “but the greatest joy of my life. Go to sleep, love of my life. Happy Valentine’s Day.” Harry fell asleep with a huge smile on his face, feeling so very happy.
“We’re not going to get any work done like this.”
Remus turns him around slowly, Harry feels stupid for flinching at the contact, but he also feels justified for flinching when he gets a good look at Remus’s face. His teeth are going to break if he doesn’t stop clenching his jaw like that.
Intrigued, the class does as they are told, following the professor out of the class and down the hallway, Draco watches in amazement with the way Lupin deals with Peeves and smiles to himself. Snape be damned, he liked this teacher. They migrate to a secluded classroom with nothing but a wobbly wardrobe inside, Draco is sure to keep an eye on it. Lupin explains the bogart inside, such nasty creatures, but he hadn’t known they were allergic to laughter of all things, who did they think they were? Snape?
“He’ll be coming with Fudge, I was eventually going to summon and warn you.”
“A Basilisk? What the hell has that boy been getting up to? James would kill him….”
“And Granger, and Weasley, and Lupin. What’s next? Are we going to put an ad out in the
of people, for simple reasons and complex ones alike.
She doesn't even look at him, but Salem does, so Draco sighs, picks the cat up, and aparates them back to the Scottish Wizarding area.
And in truth,
“I’m surprised you’re not begging me to let you join them.”
the amount of foreshadowing i've done in this fic i-
harry: I am always honest with my friends
“Who wants to meet him?”
Dumbledore smiles, “
Pansy: I'm gonna ruin Umbitch's legacy so she has nothing left
“Now that that’s settled, I have a few questions.”
“He’s a werewolf,” Draco sighs, then adds “Idiot” so Harry can’t accuse him of being nice later.
“You heard Professor Snape,” he sighs, somehow making it sound like an insult, he really is rather good at this, “Cut my roots.”
The boy flashes him that charming smile again, “We warn all our first year Huffles to be wary of you, Halloween your first year really had a few of them sacred.”
