Pansy forces Draco to look at her in the eyes. Her eyes are fiery and firm. “Yes you can,” she says firmly. “You can do this, i know you can”
Draco however feels as if he’s underwater, drowning. His mother's voice so far away. The rest of the world is drifting away and he’s lost in space. Heart pounding against his chest, the beating loud in his ears, banging against his skin.
“Darling,” Narcissa says firmly. “It is not your fault,” she states. “If anything it’s my fault, i shouldn’t have allowed the dark lord into the house” she feels tears welling up in her eyes at the thought of what her baby went through because of her
He flinches as two firm hands grasp his shoulders but allows the hands to stay there, somehow they’re grounding him. Hearing a distant voice, Draco opens his eyes to see bright green eyes staring worriedly at him.
Draco grits his teeth. "Pretend what? That I actually hate the fact it's the dark lord's child growing inside me?"
Draco blinks. “Who are you? What are you going to do with me?” he exclaims, sitting up much to the pain in his head
He clenches his hand into a fist and places it in his mouth trying to drown out the sobs while he bites into his hand.
Draco peers over his arms to see confused brown eyes softly staring at him. “Oh” is all Draco says glancing around the room to see he’s safe as memories return to him, that he’s in Potters house
“People will probably hex and bully me and I won't be able to defend myself because the professors will think I started it,” he says out loud to himself. “It’s the reason i can’t live in the wizarding world, people always find me and i get the blame”
Harry sends Ron a scowl at the playful gleam in his eyes, before Harry could answer Draco beats him to it. “Slept alright, apart from Potter’s snoring”
“I’m okay,” he squeezes her hands back in reassurance. “As much as i hate to admit it, i like living with Potter, they treat me nicely, besides it’s only until i go to Hogwarts”
He looks at the leaflet of abortion he grabbed on the way home despite saying he didn’t want one. There’s a clinic near him. Heart pounding, he calls Pansy.
Narcissa glares at Lucius, bringing a hand up, and draws her hand across her throat in a throat-cutting gesture. “Let’s talk outside” she says out with a pointed look
Draco gracefully sits and takes a sip of his hot chocolate. “What’re you reading?” he turns his head around to see the words upside down
Once he has their orders and starts making his way to the kitchens, he overhears Granger say “Did you notice his stomach?” which makes Draco’s heart pause and him stop in his tracks
Before Ron could respond, the door opens with Harry and Hermione walking in with shopping bags in their hands. Dropping the bags to the floor, Hermione greets Ron with a peck on his lips while Harry says "Hey guys" and smiles at Draco
“This child also has your blood Draco, Malfoy blood,” she says. “That is the blood that will be thicker than the dark lord's water”
Harry furrows his eyebrows and slides his legs off the bed as the door barges open and Ginny stomps inside before stopping in her tracks at the sight of Harry and Draco in bed. She shakes her head slightly and turns to Harry who jumps to a stand and races towards her when he spots tears forming in her eyes.
“I did knock,” she says.”But you’re right, i shouldn’t have come in like that, especially this early in the morning but i just got The Daily Prophet and,” she takes a deep hitched breath. “They know”
Lucius glances at his son and gracefully sits on a chair. “What happened, son?” he stares at him carefully. “Why did you do what you did? How are you even pregnant with the dark lord's baby?”
Potter sighs. “But still, like I said, i’m worried, especially since you basically said you’d rather be dead right now,” he says. “What’s wrong?”
“That’s not true Miss Parkinson,” Lucius narrows his eyes. “They are my family, i would never do that and that’s not what i think”
Draco shakes his head. “I can’t,” he holds onto Pansy for dear life, as if that if he lets go he’ll sink into the ground. “I can’t do this”
“No Potter,” Draco seriously says. “If i had it my way i would put this thing up for adoption, however mother won’t allow me”
Head hurting, he flutters his eyes open but winces and squints them shut at the bright lights blinding him for a moment.
Draco nods distantly and leaves the room, calling a taxi, and making his way home. Once he arrives home he flops onto his bed, thoughts whirling across his mind. ”What am i going to do” he says out loud to himself. “I need to get rid of it as soon as possible”
Ron huffs. “Yeah, right,” he scoffs. “But anyway, what’s with you Ginny? You come here hysterical and then you say you lost the baby, like…” he trails off watching as his little sisters face falls
Ron moves his gaze to Draco and his features soften slightly. "We won't make fun of you, your life's a mess but so is ours, we all have our own trauma and it's not a joke"
“I saw it coming, i’m not allowed nearly everywhere in the wizarding world, so i saw it coming, it was only a matter of time”
Before they could continue, a voice calling out “Draco Malfoy” makes them cut their conversation short as Draco is called for the abortion.
“Oh i’m moving in with Potter and his friends since it’s not safe to stay here since Skeeter knows I live here” Draco says
“I nearly lost Draco, my son, my dragon,” she feels tears swell up in her eyes. “I was too overbearing and controlling,” she says. “If Draco doesn’t trust you and doesn’t want anything to do with you, then I’m not telling you anything,” she slowly steps closer. “And you’re not going to ask Draco any more questions if you want to see the light of dawn tomorrow”
“No,” Harry says firmly. “At least not anymore, and i want to help you, you clearly need help and no one else is willing to give you any, so here i am”
They make their way out and the golden trio leave the restaurant, leaving Draco to deal with his angry boss.
“I’m just saying hello to my friend, can’t i do that,” she says. “Anyway, i just thought we could hang out, it’s been a while since we’ve done that”
Harry narrows his eyes. “Right…” he trails off as Draco turns his head sideways and refuses to look at him. “Are you going to eat the burger or not”
Draco sighs and plops his half eaten burger onto the plate and reluctantly eats a single chip. “Potter, as much as i appreciate you getting me lunch, i can’t finish it, i feel very sick today”
He slowly stands up and stares into the mirror, his rough reflection staring back. His hair is ruffled and his eyes are bloodshot red. Tears slowly stream down his face.
“You are officially around one month into your pregnancy, the first trimester,” the doctor says. “You hear that sound?” the doctor asks with a small smile. The sound of a rapid beat fills the room. “That’s your baby’s heartbeat”
Draco shuts his eyes. “...I just wanted it all to stop…” he ends up saying, not really knowing what to say other than that or ‘sorry’
Once lunch has finished cooking, they both dish up for themselves and sit around the table in the dining room. Sitting in comfortable silence, they both eat their beef with vegetables and potatoes.
Draco glances back to see his boss stare at him and gesture for him to hurry up. Draco coughs to catch their attention. “So what can I get you three?”
The next day, Draco wakes up to his stomach swirling and twisting like a washing machine again. Carefully getting off the bed so as to not upset his stomach further, Draco gets started with his day by getting ready for work. Making his way to the kitchen, his stomach rumbles like a growling monster. However, his stomach also twirls as if someone is twisting his insides.
“Thank you Potter” Draco says genuinely with a small smile of his own but it falters slightly. “What if…” he trails off before shaking his head. “Doesn’t matter,” he says as he raises to a stand. “Lunch is going to get cold”
“Okay, i’ll be on my way then” Narcissa leaves with a final strong look to Harry which says ‘Look after him’ to which Harry nods in response
“Who cares, and besides,” Pansy says. “You’re Draco Malfoy, since when do you allow what others think of you affect you”
Without another word, he goes to the bathroom, locks the door and stares at the dark stormy grey eyes in the mirror which stares back at him. ‘Why?’ he thinks to himself. ‘It’s all because of this stupid baby, i can’t do this anymore’ he bites on his hand to stop the sound of a pathetic sob escape his mouth.
He grips tightly onto the raver and places it over the top of his wrist, where his veins lay. He knows what he’s doing, he knows that this could kill him, but he doesn’t care, in fact, he wants it to. With a hiss, he digs the razer deep into his skin and slides it across his wrist. A burning sharp pain escalates through him, across his back and wrist. He gasps for air, hissing blood gushes out of him.
Narcissa kneels before her son and takes his hands into her own and gives them a tight squeeze. “Take deep breaths darling, please,” she soothes, kissing the crown of Draco’s head. “Everything will be alright”
Draco watches as Potter disappears into the frozen food aisle. With a huff Draco grabs his basket and makes his way to the cashier
“I’m not sure how to feel about the concept, talking to someone i don’t know about my problems worries me, but all of you say it’s good and that it helps, so i’m starting to feel a bit better about it, i’m actually looking forward to it in a way”
Potter scoffs shaking his head, nostrils flaring. “At least tell me it will be going to a good family, that you’ve taken that into consideration”
When he hears a door open, Harry looks up and spots his therapist smiling at him and waving him over. Harry rises to a stand and says his hellos while commenting on her new hair cut which has been cut just above the shoulders.
Harry clenches his jaw at the man before sending Draco a pointed look telling him with his eyes for him to stay quiet. Luckily Draco just lowers his gaze with a small grimace as Harry opens his mouth to respond
“So,” Draco starts. “Is there anything i should know about you guys or any rules that you want to enforce”
Draco flutters his eyes open hissing in pain as a pain flares through his arm. Glancing around through blurry eyes, he sees that he’s in the bathroom. Sitting up against the wall, he holds a hand tightly over the open wounds across his arm with a groan. “I fainted...again,” he says to himself with a roll of the eyes. “Great” he mutters
Heart pounding hard against his chest, Draco’s breath hitches and he finds it hard to breathe. Grasping his tightening chest, he tries to take deep breaths however it stops halfway as a burst of pain bursts from his chest each time he tries to breathe
Harry winces. “Well, it was very unexpected and we didn’t expect you to come so early, so technically yeah we do,” he says. “But before you can say anything i don’t like this more than you do”
Narcissa bites her lip. “But this is a child, a new life, who’s done nothing wrong, you need to think through this thoroughly and carefully before doing anything drastic”
“Well, always about the time when I was stuck in the fiendfyre, the smoke, everything. And then it’s about the time the dark lord...you know…”
“Yeah,” Weasley starts. “I heard you now live in the muggle world, i couldn’t believe it, i had to see it for myself to believe it”
Narcissa nods and looks at Draco who is looking at Harry gratefully. “Draco, do you want help packing”
Draco shits his eyes not to look into Potter’s eyes, but tries to take deep breaths. Heart calming down, Draco takes a final deep breath before opening his eyes, jolting back when he sees Potter’s face so close to his.
Holding his stomach, the thought making him feel like vomiting again, Draco grabs his wallet and keys and races out of his flat, not even bothering to get changed out of his pajamas
Ginny Weasley bursts out laughing, making the few people in the waiting room stare at them. She then calms down and looks between Draco and Narcissa. “Wait,” Weasley says. “You’re not joking?”
Draco smiles slightly, taking a bite out of the potatoes. Silence fills the air again once more, the only sounds being the traffic outside and their chewing. Draco feels his stomach whirling, before he knows it he jumps to a stand and races to the bathroom, and vomits once more into the toilet.
Potter nods with a tight smile. “Anyway, i should get going. My offer still stands about whether you want to go baby shopping with me and Ginny…”
Losing his patience, Ron opens his mouth to say “What happened though? What do you mean you lost the baby?”
Potter blinks. “Oh nothing, i was just wondering, if you’d like to go baby shopping sometime with me and Ginny and...your boyfriend”
Why does he keep living? What is keeping him going? He has nothing except maybe his mother. But he just can’t do this
Harry wakes up the next day with a pounding headache as the doorbell rings. He sits up and frowns when he finds the bed besides him empty. ‘Huh, I wonder where Draco is’ he thinks to himself. With a sigh, he slides his legs off the bed and stretches with a huge loud yawn. Glancing out the window, he watches as a bird lands on it’s nest with a worm in its mouth and feeds it to its children. Harry squints his eyes shut as loads of rapid thoughts run through his mind about Ginny and the baby
“No need Granger” he swishes his wand and levitates the bags before following Hermione through the hallways.
A knock at the door brings him out of his thoughts. “Harry,” Hermione’s voice says on the other side. “The sofa bed is here”
"Thanks guys," Harry sighs, shutting his eyes and raising to a stand. "I need time to think and sort myself out, im going to rest a bit more," he says before looking at Ginny. "You don't mind?"
Once Harry's pacing starts to slow, Hermione gestures for him to sit back down. As Harry sits down feeling a bit calmer, Hermione pours the tea with a sigh.
“I know that, I mean that’s what they said. I told them that he’s not, but they refuse to listen,” he states. “They also won’t allow the baby to be treated there either”
Narcissa furrows her eyebrows. “They already discharged you Draco? But they said they were going to watch over you”
After a few minutes, Draco breathes softly and falls to the floor bringing his knees to his chest and resting his head over them, trying to make himself look as small as possible
Sorry it literally took me forever to update, my laptop officially broke and im now writing on my phone, so updates may take a while. Sorry once again
Harry sighs squinting his eyes shut. "Ginny lost the baby" it was painful to say as saying it makes it more real
“You were a prat, still are to be honest, but I’m not as closed-minded as i was before, i want us to at least not fight every time we see each other”
Draco rolls his eyes. “I don’t have time or patience for this,” he says grabbing another milk and placing it in his basket. “Hopefully i won’t see you around Potter”
Draco jolts awake as a crash echoes across the flat. Fumbling for his wand, heart pounding, he throws the blanket off him and tiptoes towards the door of his room and slowly but carefully opens it, peeking his head through
Harry rolls his eyes, but steps away watching as Draco gets off the bed and reaches for his own clothes that lay on a chair.
“This baby will grow to be loved and cared for, we will teach it what’s right and wrong, it won’t have any ties to the dark lord other than just blood, everything will be alright”
“I can’t be pregnant,” he states out loud to himself. “I haven’t had sex in over a year” he furrows his eyebrows until a memory flashes through him and stops him dead in his tracks.
“It doesn’t matter what I think, but if you must know, I think it’s brilliant, a new life is always amazing, even if it is a Malfoy” Potter says.
Draco melts into his mother's arms, feeling safe and protected from the world. Draco feels tears swell up in his eyes. He coughs to hide a sniffle and wipes his tears behind her back right in time before she pulls back and looks at him square in the eyes.
Arriving at the muggle pharmacy after driving like a mad man, Draco grabs three pregnancy tests and ignores the strange look from the cashier, before driving back home and racing to the bathroom and doing the pregnancy tests
Draco shakes his head, trying to deny it. “No, the muggle tests are wrong,” he says. “They’re wrong” he repeats
Draco looks around the flat. The walls are painted a warm cream colour with pictures hung up of the golden trio and their other friends. TV in the middle of the room with a black sofa in front with two arm chairs besides it. Like Draco’s flat the kitchen and sitting room are connected together.
A hard red blush creeps upon Potter's dark face. “It’s for you, from us, for you to, er, get better”
Pansy sends him a look. “Do you really want to be working as a muggle waiter for the rest of your life”
“--We’re sure, besides it’s not safe for you to be out there alone, there are people looking for you, you know” Ron says only to furrow his eyebrows at a pointed look Hermione and Harry are sending him
An awkward silence fills the room. Harry lays down on the bed and curls into a ball, pulling his knees to his chest, trying to make himself look as small as possible. "Why?" Harry whispers
“Okay,” the healer says. “Well, the board spoke to us, and we can’t treat you and you can’t come back to St Mungo’s ever again”
Draco rolls his eyes as Potter sits on a chair besides Draco’s bed. A soft silence looms over them. “So,” Draco starts. “You’re not going to ask me questions, like why”
“Yeah, I was bleeding when I went to the toilet, and i went to a healer, and they did some scans and tests, but the baby…”
Narcissa slaps his shoulder. “Hey it’s true,” she says. “And when you’re a father, you’ll know what I mean."
Once again sorry for the really slow updates, my laptop is still broken and I'm trying on my phone lol. Hope you enjoy this chapter. Thanks for all the comments they make my day.
Ron sends Harry the best puppy eyes he could make which makes Harry chuckle. “I’m down” Harry says. Ron then looks at Draco who nods with a shrug. “Sure, i’m just intrigued to go”
“I thought you were an intruder,” he lets out a breath of relief. “You can’t just walk into my home like that mother, you must knock at the very least”
Draco startles awake as he flinches away from a touch on his shoulder. “Please don’t do this” he exclaims, pulling his knees to his chest rocking back and forward
After everything he’s done, he’s been accepted back into Hogwarts and been given a second chance to get a better education. After the trial a month ago, on whether Draco, who was a former death eater against his choice, will go to Azkaban, Draco was given a second chance at life, thanks to Potter who testified at his and his mothers trial.
Dr Jones nods. "No one deserves to be subject to unfair treatment and oppression, and from what you've told me, he's a changed person"
Draco can hardly stop the joy that flutters in his chest. He’ll be able to better his potion skills and work on getting a better job than he has now, and in the wizarding world too. But his heart suddenly drops at the reality of the situation, and how on top of being pregnant, he’s not welcome in the wizarding world no matter what his mother says and what Happy Potter said in trial.
“Stop this talk Draco,” she squints her eyes shut. “Please, you’re all i have, don’t talk like this”
The next day Draco flutters his eyes open and wakes up with a groan, a stab of sharp pain flaring on his back and arms. He sits up, with a deep frown, eyes squinting shut from the bright lights shining in the room. He glances at his surroundings to see he’s in the hospital
"It's understandable that you feel tired, anyone who's been through what you've been through will be tired," she states. "But your resilience and determination to keep going is strong despite all that, and that's a good thing Harry"
Everything bubbling up inside him starts to overflow as he mutters “Fuck it” and grabs some muggle paper and starts to write in the heat of the moment that yes, he accepts the invitation to go to Hogwarts for eighth year.
Potter scratches his neck with a sheepish smile. “I basically threatened her,” he says, making Draco furrow his eyebrows. Potter sighs. “But i’m not sure if she’ll listen, i’m sorry Malfoy."
Draco blinks with his mouth agape. He doesn’t know whether he feels joy or dread, he doesn’t know what he’s feeling but this ultrasound made this more real for Draco. There is a baby growing inside of him
Draco gets off the bed and follows Harry towards the dining room. On the table is french toast with sugar and cinnamon sprinkled over them, and golden syrup oozing down the stacks of pancakes. Draco’s mouth salivates at the sight.
Fury flares through Narcissa but looking at her son's broken form, she takes a deep breath. ‘I have to be here for Draco’ she thinks to herself. Narcissa places a hand on Draco’s cheek and raises his head back up to look at her. “This,” she starts. “Is not your fault”
“I just want you to explain, and tell me why, why do you think you’d be better off dead, is it because of the baby? It can’t be that bad can it”
Pulling his shirt down he sighs making his way to the kitchen and preparing some toast with jam. A knock at his door startles him and he opens it to reveal his mother. “What are you doing here?” Draco questions
Ron glances at Harry who smiles sheepishly as he bites a bit of the burger. Harry scratches his neck. “Sorry mate, i’ll try to eat quickly”
Walking to it with a yawn, he scans the letter for any tricks or booby traps. Seeing that there’s none, he grabs the letter and strokes the owl's soft feathers, eyes widening when he sees the Hogwarts crest on the top. Rapidly reading through the letter as the owl flies away, he blinks and blinks again when he sees the words written upon it.
Harry nods. "He's a completely different person, well, he can still be a prat but he's not an ignorant Muggle Born hating git anymore"
“It’s just, you were really excited for the baby and loved it already,” Draco starts. “And i feel bad because i HATE my baby, i don’t want it and i’m not looking forward to it”
He tries to resist rolling his eyes. “I’m pregnant, Weasley” he says, ignoring Ron's small “Oh”. Draco goes to bed and lays down staring at nothing before shutting his eyes attempting to sleep once again
Narcissa glares at him. “But,” she starts. “I know that this baby will love you, and that soon you’ll love it back”
Narcissa sighs. “Anyway, did you send your response yet about whether you’re going back to Hogwarts for the eighth year?”
Potter leans against the wall, fidgeting with his hands. “No,” he says. “I see why you don’t want anything to do with it now”
Draco glances out to the balcony to see that the usual owl is on the bars of the balcony, the owl has been coming and going every day, waiting for Draco to give him his answer. Draco holds the piece of paper to his chest and squints his eyes shut.
Harry shakes his head. “No, at least not yet” he says only for Draco to cross his arms with a “Not helping Potter”. Harry sighs “I went to your flat to tell you that you can move in, and i found your mother there and she told me what happened”
Ron stands from where he was sitting and turns to Harry. ”Mate, you still haven’t answered us, are you okay?”
“It’s my grandchild, even though it’s also the dark lords, it’s also yours and I will look after it”
Narcissa cups his cheek. “I think you did,” she says. “It will be hard because not everyone is accepting, but going back will be worth it, I know it will”
“An ultrasound?” Draco questions, he’s heard of it but never figured out what it was despite studying and trying to discover all there is to know about muggles and their technologies
“And I thought you couldn’t be more of a prat, you’re not excited for a poor innocent baby to come,” Potter scoffs, shaking his head. “If you didn’t want the baby you should have used protection”
But Harry is determined. “Yes you made mistakes, we all do, we’re all human after all, but what counts and matters is that we learn from them, that we don’t make the same mistakes again,” he says. “In Malfoy manor, you learned from your mistake and chose not to reveal that it was me they snatched, and you’re still learning from them, for example by trying to get on with Hermione and Ron, by getting on with me, trying to be the best person you can be”
Ron lowers his gaze to stare at Draco's stomach. "Is it really Voldemort's baby you're pregnant with?"
Draco bites his lip. "What if they tell people my problems and thoughts? And it has to be a Muggle because no one will want to listen to the problems of a death eater, though I can't tell the whole truth if it's a Muggle obviously"
Draco holds his hands up and shakes them and his head rapidly. “No no mother,” he says. “You know I want nothing to do with this thing, much less buy stuff for it, besides, it makes it too real”
Draco giggles and Ron stares at him before rolling his eyes and chuckling along with him. "Have you thought of seeing a therapist?" Ron then questions
Potter shuts the book and looks at Draco. “Did you buy baby things yet? I bought so much stuff, I just couldn’t help myself to be honest” he chuckles slightly
‘I’m not going to think about you,’ Draco thinks to himself. ‘I’ve been doing well and today has been a good day so far, I’m not going to let you ruin it’
“So Draco,” Potter says, making Draco blush, him saying his name sounding like music to his ears. “Shall we get started on lunch” he reaches his hand out for Draco to take
“You took over half an hour in here, we got worried,” Harry says before blinking at Draco. “Wait, have you been crying?”
Before Draco can reply, a hard knock at the door startles them both. “Breakfast is ready” Ron’s grumbling loud voice says
“What’s wrong, what’s wrong?” Draco starts. “Everything is wrong!” he exclaims. “First, I constantly have nightmares nearly every single day. And second, this fucking baby is ruining my life.” tears start to swell in his eyes once again. “I was raped by an evil man,” he finally says the dreaded word which he found so hard to say, as it would be accepting what happened. “Only to end up having his child, I feel like shit every single day and i’m constantly reminded of my past and my mistakes because of the dark mark and...and…” he trails off with a sob
With a final nod, he scrunches the paper up and throws it in the bin as he makes his way to grab his wallet and keys before walking out the door. Making his way to the nearest cafe, he sighs, keeping his hands stuffed in his pockets.
Draco takes a deep breath. “You know what,” he starts, hurt, pain flowing across his chest. “Maybe I am pathetic, a horrible person, I can't help it,” he exclaims. “I should have died that day in the Fiendfyre, but of course fate is twisted and messed up”
Once the dark mark is covered in long thin cut lines which are neatly scattered across his arm, Draco sighs squinting his eyes shut as he washes his arm with cold water under the tap, turning the inside of the sink a pinky red as the blood is being washed away.
Draco frowns at being reminded of the situation at hand, that he’s going to be a father no matter how much he hates it and tries to avoid it. “Right…” he trails off
"What? And have you and Granger make fun of me? I know you have every right, my life's a joke, but still I'd rather not"
Ron jolts from where he’s sitting on the sofa watching TV. “Jeez, mate, you made me jump” he exclaims, turning around only to frown slightly at Draco’s presence. “Malfoy”
“I don’t understand,” Narcissa says. “Isn’t that a good thing, I’m going to have a grandchild” she smiles slightly
“Draco,” Narcissa softly says. “Please, I just want to help, I want the best for you,” she says before looking at Harry. “I’m sure Mr Potter does as well”
“I know you’re slow Potter but I didn't think you were this slow,” Draco sasses. “I live in the muggle world if you must know”
As Potter stands, a bug of some kind drops to the floor besides Draco which makes Draco screech shuffling away. Taking his shoe off, ignoring Potter’s worried “What’s wrong”, Draco goes to hit the beetle however it runs away quickly. 	Racing to keep up with it, Draco is about to hit it when a burst of magic explodes from around the beetle and it turns into a familiar woman
Harry sits besides Draco on the bed, making Draco huff and slide further away from Harry. Trying not to lose his temper Harry takes a deep breath through his nose and out through his mouth. “We want to help, talking helps you know, just tell me what’s wrong”
“I’m transgender,” Draco states not knowing where his courage is coming from. “If you have a problem with that…”
Ron, Hermione, and Harry blink at that. “Wow,” Ron says. “That’s actually very, I don't know, nice of you?”
They sit together on the floor in a comfortable silence for a while, they don’t know how much time passed until a soft knock on the door makes them jolt and knocks them out of their thoughts. Harry raises to a stand and helps Ginny up as he says “Come in”
Harry shrugs. “I mean i’d have to talk to them first but i’m sure once they find out what happened they wouldn’t mind”
“Yes you can,” Narcissa states. “Yes you can because you’re strong, whatever it is you can get through this”
“Oi,” Weasley stands but is pulled back by Granger. “Don’t talk to her like that, just because you gained weight--”
He wraps a bandage around his arm, wincing at the stinging which flares over his arm. Once done, Draco grabs his things and makes his way to the front door. On the way, Draco slowly stops in his tracks when he spots the Hogwarts letter still on the table. He still has to write back on whether he’s going back or not. Hell, he still has to make his mind up.
The healer frowns and crosses her arms. “Didn’t your mother teach you it’s bad manners to not greet people when they greet you”
Ron shakes his head. “Look i hate you Malfoy, but i wouldn’t wish what happened to you upon anyone, not even you, however what happened happened, and now we must move forward from this, it doesn’t do well to dwell on the past, but focus on the future”
He shakily moves the razer to his other hand and does the same to his left wrist. His vision goes blurry before he sees all black
Draco wakes up and suddenly a wave of rapid thoughts crashes over him. As soon as he’s conscious it seems like anxiety and thoughts never seem to leave. Draco quietly slides off the bed, careful not to wake Potter up. He gets changed and leaves a note on his side of the bed saying that he’s going to visit his mother.
Draco flinches back at the bluntness and shakes his head. "I don't want you to stop doing what you want or change your plans because of me"
Draco has never fought back to his parents, however there’s a fire within him that is burning through him. “No” he says
He glances at the razor blades on the sink and bites his lip so hard blood comes out. “No,” he holds his hand back as he reaches for it. “I shouldn’t,” he says. “If i go back down that dark hole I may never get out”
“Oh, right” Harry whirls around to face the wall, biting his lips as he hears shuffling behind him from Draco getting changed. The urge to turn around is high but Harry knows he can’t and shouldn’t as it would invade his privacy
Once they’re outside St Mungo’s, Harry wraps his arm around Draco’s, linking their arms together before apparating into Draco’s flat. With their arms still linked, they spot Narcissa flinch and jolt whirling around to them before letting out a breath.
Draco nods. “Yes, thank you, Weasley,” he says much to Ron’s surprise. Draco then looks at Hermione and Harry. “I appreciate you trying not to worry me, but it’s better I am prepared for what might happen”
Draco opens his mouth to reply but shakes his head. He takes a deep breath. “The dark lord” he whispers
Hermione looks at Draco who’s staring at Harry with a small soft smile. She tries to hide her knowing smile but fails as Ron questions her. She shakes her head saying “It’s nothing” before looking at Draco. “So Malfoy, how do you feel about that?” she asks
Once Draco is out of sight, Ginny glances at Harry with her eyebrows furrowed. “Why were you both in bed together--actually, why is he even here?”
“Because,” Harry starts. “I know you, and I know you’re strong enough to get through this, and you’re not alone in this,” he says, watching as Draco’s features turn to doubt. “Come on, dinner must be getting cold”
Draco raises an eyebrow at Harry as Harry sputters and chokes on his own spit. “I do NOT whine” Harry exclaims
Potter bursts out a laugh in the silent supermarket causing everyone to snap their head to them. Draco frowns as Potter keeps laughing while wiping fake tears from his eyes.
Draco tries to take a deep breath but it cuts off short each time. He shakes his head in despair. “I can’t,” he croaks out. “I can’t”
"No you prat," Ron rolls his eyes. "You don't have to pretend to be okay, you're clearly not and I don't really care but I'm sure it would make Harry feel better if you didn't try to hide it"
Narcissa shakes her head. “Once that baby is born, you’re going to look at it and your heart is going to swell from love and affection,” she sighs, tears forming in her eyes as she remembers the day Draco was born. “And then they’re going to grow up, and have their own life and soon you realize that your baby doesn’t need you anymore”
Harry sighs. “Yeah, people are looking for you because of the baby, people are in a panic because they think the baby is going to be the next Voldemort”
"Yeah but it's not what you think," Harry exclaims. "He doesn't want to have Voldemort's child, he was...he was raped by him"
Draco squints his eyes shut, his heart pounding against his chest. He drops to the ground and pulls his knees to his chest, breath hitching. “No no no no no,” he mumbles to himself. “No!” he slams his fists and hides his face in his arms to hide the tears streaming down his face.
Draco's laugh dies down and he frowns. "Granger and Potter said once that it would be best and that they actually help," Draco says. "Though I really don't want to talk about my issues with strangers"
Harry full on laughs and Draco stares at him, his face warming up as a soft pink blush flushes on his cheeks. Draco notices for the first time the small freckles dotted around Harry’s dark skin and his green eyes full of life have different shades of green.
Draco rubs a hand over his face. “Should I visit father or not,” he mumbles to himself. “He is its grandfather, he does deserve to know,” he sighs. “But I can't look at him in the face after everything that he did, after everything that happened, what he did to us, to this family”
Harry turns around to face Draco, tears are in his eyes and his voice cracks as he says "Promise me something"
Narcissa grabs Draco’s hands and gives them a tight squeeze. “Darling, don’t feel bad, it’s okay to feel a bit sad for them but they didn’t lose the baby because of you, and just because you feel a certain way about yours doesn’t mean your thoughts and feeling don’t matter”
Once he’s finished peeling a mango and cutting it, he joins Pansy to watch TV in the sitting room. And that’s how they spend the rest of the day until it started to become dark and Pansy had to go home, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts
“Exactly,” Draco says, mixing the mince and sauce together with the pasta before turning to Harry and crossing his arms. “So don’t judge me on my choices”
“Skeeter is probably writing the papers as we speak,” Harry says. “I know you don’t want to think about it, and you have every right, but you must think about what you’re going to do next, you must think about your safety first and--”
Before Draco could respond, they’ve reached the hospital and are waiting in line to see the receptionist. Once Draco tells the receptionist his name and birthday and that he has an appointment with Dr Smith for an ultrasound, he makes his way to the waiting room with his mother in tow but he stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley sitting there
They make their way to the waiting, sitting away from all the other people, Draco decides it’s a good time to talk about what he remembered in the taxi.
Harry sighs. “We ALL went through traumatic events, some different, some similar, however, we’ve all got each other, and we’re not alone,” he says then looks at Draco. “Even you Draco”
Potter frowns. “Neither is mine and Ginny's baby but we’re still excited and looking forward for it to come”
Sorry it took me a long time to update, my life has been crazy and hectic and I've been really busy, plus my laptop is on the verge of breaking as the fan is broken so I can't use it as much as I'd like to. Thanks for sticking with me, i hope you enjoy this chapter
Narcissa sighs. “But what happened...happened, we can’t change the past, all we can do is accept what happened and try to move on”
“Er right” he says before sitting gracefully in one of the armchairs forcing his eyes on the TV, trying to ignore the stare from Hermione
“Anyway, i’ll leave for you to get dressed” Harry says before leaving the room and shutting the door behind him
“Fuck it” Draco reaches for it and presses it against his skin and drags it across his arm, across the disgusting dark mark which will forever mark his skin and remind him of everything the dark lord did as well as remind Draco of his mistakes.
As they walk into the semi-empty corridor, Narcissa shuts the door behind and glances around to see everyone in their own world of worry as their heads are slumped down or whispering to the healer.
Potter tilts his head, trying to piece everything together and once he’s pieced it together Potter snaps his head straight and stares at Draco with his mouth open in shock. “Wait a second, are you saying you were…” he trails off
Draco furrows his eyebrows. “It’s where you watch films on a big screen in a dark room with loads of people right?” he asks.
“H-How do you know that?” Draco slowly lifts his head, trying to take deep breaths but each breath is hitched and cuts off halfway
Before Harry could start an argument with Ron about it, Draco cuts in saying “Whatever happened, i’m thankful and im your debt for allowing me to stay”
Draco and Hermione look at Harry with worried eyes. “Yeah,” Hermione says. “Please be honest with us, we just want the best for you”
As Harry leaves, Draco makes his way to the bedroom and flops onto the bed and allows darkness to take over him.
Not hearing a response, she hits the door harder. “Draco!” she pounds a fist on the door. “Draco this is not funny, open the door!” she exclaims, banging it.
Harry's heart stutters against his chest as his eyes widen and a huge hopeful smile builds on his face. "Really?"
Draco frowns. “Look, I appreciate the offer but I know i won’t be welcome there, and i won’t stay where i’m not welcome”
“Well, you won’t be safe there,” Harry states. “If you don’t fight back you’re definitely going to be picked on and bullied, but if you do fight back, it’s going to be put against you, especially since you have the dark mark”
Draco waits outside for Pansy and once she appears, they get a taxi and make their way to the clinic. The ride in the taxi is silent, Draco suddenly remembers something but decides he can’t say it in the car in case the muggle taxi guy overhears them
"There's a quote from a Muggle about that, 'if you're going through hell, keep going' " Dr Jones smiles slightly before adding. "Besides, why would you stop in hell"
Draco sighs making his way to table five but stops in his tracks at the sight of Potter, Granger, and Ron Weasley sitting at the table. Draco winces with a small whine. “Why” he says to himself walking over to the table
“I spoke to them by the way, they’re willing to allow you to live with us as long as you’re not a prat”
“Oh,” Potter says “Sorry i just thought since it takes a lot of magic for a male to have a baby, i thought you had a boyfriend or something”
Harry looks at Draco when he feels a hard stare and he notices his face is scrunched up, Harry frowns, wiping his mouth and plopping his burger on his plate. “What? Do I have something on my face?”
Draco feels his stomach twist and swirl at the thought. He opens his mouth to say it but he clangs it shut.
Once the food is done, Draco dishes up for both of them a huge amount of spaghetti bolognese. He hands it over to Harry who looks at him with wide blown eyes. “That is a lot of food” he comments
The doctor sends him a tight smile. “Well we want to do an ultrasound to make sure everything is okay with the baby”
Draco falls to the ground and curls up like a ball, bringing his knees tightly to his chest and burying his face in his arms. Pansy’s heart drops at the sight of her friend's broken shaking form. She sits besides him and pulls him into a tight side-hug
He doesn’t know how much time he’s been crying in front of the mirror but a knock at the door startles him out of his thoughts. “Y-Yeah?” he barely croaks out
As Draco makes his way to his bedroom and flops onto the bed, his mind is whirling with thoughts, unable to sleep. He grunts and lays back onto the bed with a thump. He stares at the ceiling. Thinking. Draco’s heartaches.
“You didn’t allow anything,” Harry says. “Yes it is your fault the death eaters got in, but that was a mistake”
“I draw, it’s calming and helps me distract myself,” Draco says. “But it’s very private, i can’t show it”
Harry turns around and looks to Draco with a tiny smile. “It’s okay,” he says. “And Draco, you will be okay you know”
He leaves the room to find Harry scattering around the flat like a confused cockroach. Draco tilts his head. “What’s wrong?”
“It went well, talked about Ginny and the baby, and i feel a bit better after venting everything out--oh and i also may have gotten Draco a therapist”
Draco feels his heart drop and his stomach growl, but he then shakes his head. ‘Why am I jealous’ he thinks to himself. “Congratulations” he forces out
Draco wakes up with a groan, his stomach twisting and swirling like a washing machine. Sitting up his mind foggy with flashbacks of a nightmare, pressure builds up from his stomach up to his throat and before he knows it he’s throwing up onto the floor. Throat burning and tears stinging his eyes, Draco finally stops vomiting after a while. However, still feeling nauseous, he takes a sip of water which stands by his bedside table
The next day Draco wakes up with a soft sigh. He flutters his eyes open to see beams of sunlight shining through the sides of the curtains. He turns around to see Harry still sleeping, his features soft and relaxed, unlike the usual tenseness that is around Harry. Soft snores escaping Harry's mouth fill the otherwise quiet room. Draco smiles staring at how relaxed Harry is, how soft and calm he is.
“What,” Draco blinks. “Of course not,” he says. “I’m just thinking they may not be happy to have me there”
“Why Potter?” Draco sighs pulling his knees to his chest. “After everything I've done to you and your friends, I mean I'm a bloody death eater for crying out loud.” He holds his arm out, which is covered by his long sleeve jumper, to further prove his point.
Harry nods silently but then shakes his head slightly at the fact she’s behind the door and can’t see him. “Yeah, i’ll be right there” he says
“And choose your choices wisely, sometimes it’s better to just ignore,” Harry says. “Talking back will just make them angrier”
“What, it would be to his advantage, he would gain even more respect and power by the death eaters, thinking that they’ll have a new dark lord”
Noticing Draco shifting in his seat and fiddling with his hands, Pansy coughs and tries to think of something different to talk about. “How are you even here? Aren’t you meant to be in Azkaban” she questions before narrowing her eyes. “How did you even know we’re here?” she asks
Staring at the mess he made, Draco holds his stomach while placing his feet onto the cool wooden floor. Like needles pricking at his feet, Draco wiggles his toes before making his way downstairs to grab a wet cloth.
Potter huffs but before he could say anything, Draco slowly gets off the bed, revealing his swollen belly bump. Harry goes to help Draco but Draco shoves him away saying “I’m not a china doll, i don’t need your help”
He then makes his way to the kitchen to eat something before work. Putting his work clothes on, he notices in the mirror that his stomach is sticking out a bit. Biting his lip, he squints his eyes shut to try and drown away the feeling of disgust which fills him from his stomach.
Pansy whirls around to spot the familiar man entering the room. Narcissa’s eyes widen at the sight of Lucius before them
Narcissa takes Draco’s face into her hands, cupping his cheeks. “Because,” she starts. “You’re strong and i know you can get through this”
“Time to go shopping i guess” he grumbles to himself, forcing himself to have a shower and get changed before making his way towards the nearest muggle supermarket.
Draco’s heart drops to his stomach at the thought of Potter being a father for some reason, but it’s probably more to do with himself becoming a father, or at least, Draco hopes. “Oh” he says, lowering his gaze before taking another sip of his hot chocolate
It’s not until a different healer to the other walks into the room with a tight smile. “So Mr Malfoy,” he starts. “I have bad news”
"Sometimes talking with strangers is better than talking with people close to you," Ron shrugs. "For me it is anyway"
“Mr Malfoy,” a doctor comes to where he’s eating some bread with soup in a room. “The results came back that you’re pregnant, are you aware of this?”
Harry, Ron and Draco watch as Hermione’s stern face softens as she rubs a hand over her face with a sigh. “Fine, whatever, only if Harry and Malfoy want to watch it though”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Because if you want me to vomit, i’ll go vomit on your bed for you being so stubborn”
Ron, Hermione and Draco peep their heads through the door and look between them carefully. “Is everything okay?” Hermione questions.
“Right,” Hermione coughs. “You’ll be sharing with Harry since we only have two bedrooms” she states not asking whether it’s okay or not.
“What,” she says. “It’s to help get it into your head” she knocks on his head to further prove her point.
As Draco lays down, he lifts his shirt up to reveal his swollen stomach and the doctor places the gel on it. Draco refuses to look at the screen where the image of his baby lays, but Narcissa is wide eyes staring at the monitor taking in the image
“You may have been a huge vile prat, but you didn’t deserve that, you don’t deserve that” Hermione says
"We need to heal the wounds and possibly give him more blood, he's pregnant isn't he?" the healer says
Harry lifts the two brown paper bags. “Firstly, I got us both lunch,” he says. “Secondly, i think i found you a therapist”
Once they’re at the flat, Draco makes his way to the bedroom without a word and lays down on the bed staring at nothing. He runs a hand over his stomach. “I’m not going to change my mind” he says to himself, insisting that it’s true, before shutting his eyes and allowing sleep to take over him
The healer walks away and Pansy turns to Draco. “Since sixth year?!” she exclaims, her voice laced with pain. “How could I not have noticed”
Draco groans sitting down in front of Potter and Weasley. Narcissa shakes her head at her son's actions but sits him on the plastic blue chairs. The ticking of the clock in the silent waiting room is like a bomb waiting to go off, ticking down until it’s about to explode
Draco throws his apron on the ground and wipes his shoes on it. “Good,” he exclaims. “I hated this job anyway”. Stomping out of the restaurant, too angry to drive he apparates to his house and races to the bathroom.
“Woohoo!” Ron woops, pounding a fist in the air. “Malfoy,” he points to Draco. “Get dressed and ready, chop chop, hurry up”
Potter shakes his head. “No, hate is a strong word, besides if you hated me, you wouldn’t have spoken to me today in the cafe”
Narcissa digs through the bag and pulls out a bunch of tiny onesies, shirts and dresses, and shoes, but she holds out a particular one, a tiny yellow shirt which says ‘I love daddy’ upon it.
Harry decides to let it slide as he says “Were you waiting for me to make lunch or something? Why didn’t you make anything”
Harry looks at Draco carefully. “You’ve never cared about what people thought about you before, why do you care now”
Draco walks out of the bedroom to find Harry, Ron and Hermione huddled in a small circle talking in hushed whispers. He stares at them when they all jump and whirl around to him.
Harry blinks remembering something. “There’s always the new wizarding hospital they’re building, i’m the one funding it and it was my idea, and i won’t allow Draco to not be treated there if he needs it”
Noah had made a full recovery in the weeks that followed the accident, but he was unable to remember anything else. Apparently the obliviate had partially worked, only causing him a strong headache if he tried to remember any details leading to his and Bea's attack. It wasn't helpful, but Harry was pleased the boy was alright and walking around again.
"I know, Malfoy" He whispered, and alright... maybe it was the cold that was starting to rise from his back to his head, or maybe it was the way Malfoy's nose was all pink, or maybe it was just a lapse of good judgment but Harry moved his hand and touched Draco's. It was a simple gesture, just his thumb brushing lightly over the back of his hand.
"Yes he did" His voice was low and almost broken. Harry had a flash of sixteen year old Draco, crying in a bathroom without knowing he would be bleeding out a few moments later... "And he is right"
"Yeah, you did. A lot" Harry squeezed his hand, trying to tell him he wasn't angry or disappointed, just worried and mildly confused "But why?"
They remained in that weird silent company for several nights, their only exchange had happened when Harry couldn't still his tongue anymore, and asked:
Draco seemed to be fighting with himself and Harry knew things could get ugly. Things had been incredibly well so far, neither of them hurting the other too much. They would fight, of course, but they were careful with each other's feelings.
Harry smiled and reached for his cheek, touching it for a moment before Draco moved closer and closer and close enough for them to finally kiss. He had wanted to do this all day, all fucking day. He closed his eyes and kissed back, feeling Draco's lips and the way his tongue brushed gently against his from time to time. It was slow and lazy and yet Harry felt perfect. Draco moved a bit closer, forcing him to spread his legs a bit to make room for him. It was really comfortable, having Draco slightly sideways between his legs, holding his face and kissing him. Both of Draco's legs were over one of his, so he had to hold him close with his arms - which was perfect.
Draco closed his eyes, exhausted. It was a bit uncomfortable having his boxers dirty but... Well, that could be fixed easily.
"You have no idea what we have to do, huh?" Ron chuckled trying to figure out the recipe while Hermione gave them worrying looks.
"Yeah, you think?" Harry looked around. The room had never hurt anyone. Why was it doing it now? "Let's find the door again"
Harry noticed Malfoy was sitting by himself on the grass, -which seemed so uncharacteristic- slowly biting an apple and reading a book. A smile crept up on him remembering his 'secret' love for muggle books. Agh, but why was he alone? Malfoy always had someone following him or around him, it used to piss Harry off.
Of course Bell had been aware of certain children trying to get in the way, but they were extremely inexperienced and weak. They cared about others. He knew exactly how to exploit that sort of weakness. And he would, if he had to.
Harry said nothing, giving him space. When he flicked his wand, a small white-ish glow appeared, but nothing formed. Draco opened his eyes, and groaned. He was clearly annoyed, upset even.
Draco chuckled and uncrossed his arms "Fine, apology accepted. You are free." He stepped inside the classroom, every time he had class with Ravenclaw he realized how he had never made any Ravenclaw friends. Luna had been nice but... weird. Not that there was anything wrong with being a little weird.
Harry was about to have lunch when he found out. The whole morning had gone without any type of trouble. He had followed his friends, kept some tabs con Beatrice -who seemed to have an extremely boring life- and waited for the time to meet Draco to go explore the castle. They had decided to look for abandoned rooms, Draco suspected that if the attacker planned to do this sort of magic ritual, he would have a place set up for it.
Terrified, he looked down, expecting to see a slithering shape hurrying towards his body or something equally monstrous. He saw nothing. Draco was about to get up and run, when a head appeared, and then shoulders, and then there was a whole Harry Potter in front of him.
"Don't worry, he won't be coming back" Draco regretted it the moment he said it. He didn't know if that was true, he just wanted his father to shut up about them.
Lucius seemed paler than usual, one of his hands moving restlessly next to his body. It was clear how much he missed his cane, and the wand, of course. His face, though, betrayed nothing.
Draco smirked for a moment and pressed his face against the fabric of Harry's shirt. "It will be, one day"
"At least they... Maybe they are thinking about it. Maybe they were silent because they didn't know what to say but-"
The women stared at him, no one wishing to speak. "She will stand trial, but... She's still a minor and we suspect..." McGonagall shook his head "She will be fine, Potter"
Harry felt a strong knot on his throat "Yeah, I just... I never thought I would have to be inside a maze again. Last time..."
If one thing could be said about those Gryffindors it was how... surprisingly loyal they were. Draco couldn't quite picture Pansy worrying over some boys she didn't know.
"Potter, your wand" His voice was much more calm and collected, but Harry could tell that was only masking his true horror.
The words were a bit of a shock for him, and not only that but the way he said it: as if it was true, as if it hurt to even consider leaving him. Draco's chest was about to explode. How could people feel like this and not brag about it all the time? How did people find the strength to not be snogging all the time?
The house seemed to be eerily quiet as the day before. No aurors in the house that morning, that was good. They came and went, Draco knew some were stationed outside, or making sure the wards kept them inside but he couldn't care less about them. As long as they kept their distance, he would do everything he could to tune their presence out.
"No, not like walking" Draco stopped him and made him move one feet first "Alright, a bit like walking. It's a 1, 2, 3"
"What is this?!" A strong voice came from behind him and a spell must have been used because the other students were pushed away. Draco opened his eyes and quickly covered his arm again. They hadn't exposed the...
"Do you know how many reporters are in here? " He tried to sound as if he didn't care, but his voice trembled and he took a sip from his champagne.
Elliot nodded carelessly, relaxing back on his seat and grabbing a small tennis ball, throwing it up and down.
Harry had no clue what he was looking, until he pointed. Harry turned around on his chair, staring up at the dark sky. One of the beautiful things about the wizarding world was the lack of electricity, which made the night sky with all its stars easy to see.
"Lucius" Narcissa moved a hand, clearly telling him to shut up "Draco, darling, I'll be upstairs in a minute"
Draco was tense. It was weird how Harry knew him and didn't know him at the same time. Harry missed some vital information about him, favorite color? Food? Hopes? Dreams? What did he dream about? What were his nightmares about?
Draco barely moved, just enough to look at him over his shoulder "There's nothing to thank, Harry... I enjoyed it as much as you did... Alright? I wasn't 'taking one for the team'"
"What?" His head shot up, almost as surprised as Noah had been moments before. He couldn't understand, his brain wasn't fast enough to even... What?
"No. No, I don't" Harry intertwined their fingers, trying to move closer but unable to do so. "Ugh, this place is tiny. Ow, sorry" He said, accidentally hitting Draco's leg with his knee.
Draco pulled himself together, swallowing what felt like lava down his throat, and walked down the hallways he had memorized. Part of him was surprised that Harry had left, and wondered if he was actually angry at him. The rational part of his brain, instead, told him McGonagall had probably forced him to go to bed and Harry surely felt as spent as him.
The burrow was bursting with sound and laughter, as there were too many people inside as usual. It only made the empty spaces left by those who left feel all the more real. Harry tried not to focus on that, but it was hard.
"Yeah, really. Am I wrong?" Silence "So, wanna go to the Tower with me? I brought the cloak and the guys aren't going to say anything, promise"
His scarf smelled like him, and it was weird because he had never been close enough to know how he smelled like. The only chance had been during
way. I'm sorry, Draco" He pulled his arm free, starting down the stairs without waiting for him. It's not that he was angry at him -he wasn't- but concerned that perhaps Draco wasn't as trusting of his friends as he had suspected he was. Things had been going smoothly between the four of them (six, when Noah and Elliot joined them) so this was unexpected.
Ugh. Yeah. That. Draco hated feeling like his whole life was in the hands of some aurors. And, truth be told, it was.
"We're not staying long," He added, not wanting to drag out the silence between them "I'm glad you are back on your feet"
"No, don't... don't" Draco closed his eyes for a moment, looking clearly affected. Harry wasn't stupid, he knew what was on the seventh floor. He knew what had happened there.
With a groan, he used his wand to make everything fold back into their packages and into the basket. He would make sure to pay Rosmerta later, and give her the biggest tip he could afford. She had been really good to him. To them.
"I don't..." Draco looked away, trying to find the words, and trying to find comfort in the fact that they were alone and no one was staring at them "I can't protect myself from you... I don't have... I-"
Harry was sure he'd have been able to finish just from that, but he should've known Draco was going all the way with this.
Right after the war he had gone to therapy. Well, Molly Weasley had looked him straight in the eye and said
Harry kissed him, pressing himself against him a little bit more, while his hand found his way in between Draco's legs. They were still touching and kissing, but it was much slower, much more intimate. Draco pressed a hand to his shoulder, digging his fingers into his skin. His breathing was erratic but Harry could tell he was trying to slow it down.
Knowing Malfoy, if he felt accused he would probably say some really uncomfortable things and that could not go well for him.
Harry almost fell asleep while waiting, sitting on the floor with his invisibility cloak still on him. He had no idea what was going on in there, but it was taking a really long time.
"Can we not talk about it?" Harry felt a bit embarrassed, not only from everything that had happened but by the fact that he had very clearly been crying. "It was just a stupid fight, alright?"
Yup, that didn't make anything clearer. Malfoy must have noticed his face because he continued talking.
"Herm, I am going back to the common room. It's too quiet here" She gave him a weird look but nodded, burying her nose back in her huge books.
Draco frowned, uncomfortable from everyone's eyes on him. He was a Slytherin in lion territory, after all.
"I'm still not sure if I want my parents having... Access to our home" He could see in Harry's expression he wasn't sure either "And if one of my friends ever does anything that hurts you or offends you, I want you to be able to tell me"
"Make a copy of this, come on" Draco said, placing the key he had used the night before between them. "You
His feet touched the steps when Malfoy' s voice pierced right through the dark: "Good night, Potter"
“We didn't talk about it. Not really. It wasn't the time or the place. They can't have a scandal like that right now” Draco frowned, looking down at his own hands.
If he were anyone else, he might have screamed or punched a wall or done something irrational. Instead, he got up and looked at his wand. He was an auror, he had special training and no one was going to take what was his without him knowing.
Draco tried not to laugh in between kisses, but Harry was clearly having a hard time with only one hand.
"It's alright, Harry" Draco looked spent, his back still pressed against the wardrobe, shirt loose and a huge mark on his neck. "I'm okay" He moved away from the piece of furniture and grabbed Harry by his arms "It's just... it can't be like this"
He opened his mouth to answer but it was Hermione who spoke "We are seeing this through, you don't think Harry is doing this for you, do you?"
"It's the truth, isn't it? You think you are so smart and closed up and mysterious, well you are not. I see how you look at him"
"I need to be going" Harry rose from his place, taking a long look at Draco and deciding it was best not to... come back the next night.
"How come you are always getting in trouble, Malfoy?" he smiled and Draco relaxed. He could see Elliot's shoulders relax as well.
Harry chuckled, his eyes focused on Malfoy. "Alright, fine. But I think you have a sweet tooth and hate to share"
, but now? They have a reason to hate you. They don't really need a reason to hate me but this helps. If we were nobodies it wouldn't be so obvious, I suppose"
Harry placed his free hand on the mattress next to Draco's head, trying to steady himself. He didn't want to hurt Draco, so he used a finger first, easing it inside of him, extremely carefully.
Harry's back hit one of the walls, tilting one of the paintings, almost making it fall from its hook. His hands found his shirt and started unbuttoning it as fast as he could. Without breaking the kiss, Draco did the same. When he placed his hands on Draco's face, they were both already getting rid of their shoes, just stepping out of them.
Harry sighed, his head pressing against the wall, who could be attacking students? And more importantly: why?
"Oh" Neville nodded, always so calm. Draco knew he was capable of being angry, hell, Neville was capable of being scary but it was refreshing to see someone so nice. It was tiring as well, but Draco wouldn't be around him that much anyways.
That's something he loved about Noah. People usually thought Elliot was dumb, but not Noah. He always listened.
over and over, and he wasn't fine with it. Yeah, he had told himself he was and that it didn't matter but truth was he liked him so,
Draco, even as he was clearly opposed at the idea of eavesdropping, had now pressed himself against Harry to be closer to the door. Harry realized how brilliant that idea had been just by having Draco so close to his body.
Finally Malfoy moved away from the wall, and gave him a look "Maybe I will tell you everything after the holidays"
The slytherin sat up on the bed and reached out for his wand, using it to dim out the lights in the room. He moved closer to him, holding them close together and pressed his face to his neck. They were both incredibly aroused and Harry was going to feel incredibly guilty if he ruined the mood.
Harry shrugged and offered his hand out, the other boy seemed to think about it for a moment but eventually squeezed it. Their hands touched for about a minute, and Harry assumed that was a normal amount of time to do something like that but it still felt like too long, too much...
Draco moved a bit, forcing him to follow. They were far from the edge of the lake so if anything bad happened... Oh, Goodness.
Harry didn't know what to say, but he knew what he needed: he pulled Draco close to him, hugging him with both arms. They were quite sticky with sweat but he didn't care.
Draco raised his head and stared at him, trying to prove he was alright. The bad moment had passed and his father could go back to the house. He didn't know if his face showed how surprised he was seeing his dad like that. Had Lucius ever sat on the floor? Or seemed worried like that? Luckily, Draco knew better than to trust him.
If anyone had told Harry a couple of years back that he would be willingly - and happily- following Malfoy around Hogwarts without really knowing where they were going, he would have laughed for hours. Yet here he was, staring at the back of a blonde head while quietly moving from hallway to hallway trying to avoid ghosts and prefects.
Harry groaned when he started kissing his chest, both half sitting - half kneeling on the bed. They didn't have much room in a single bed, but they made it work. It wasn't the first time they had kissed and touched each other, and it wouldn't be the last. That single thought made goosebumps appear all over his skin, while he dug his fingernails on Harry's hips.
"It's not there anymore?" Draco looked behind them and... the door definitely wasn't there. A brick wall stood instead, empty. Oh, why? In front of them the rows of books went on and on and the maze became a scary thing. "This was a terrible idea, Potter. One of your worst"
"Mh?" Harry felt his eyes heavy and he almost wanted to take a nap right there on the floor, with his head still resting on Draco's chest.
"Sure, I've got a free period" Harry's eyes moved slightly down, and Draco knew he was staring at his lips. Oh, Merlin, he wanted to kiss him so much. Just like the night before. "See you then"
Tears formed in his eyes, even if he didn't want them to. Would his father ever understand that, despite his sexuality, the love he felt for his family was true? That this would break something inside of him?
"Alright, enough!" Harry stopped and grabbed him by the arm, making him half-turn to look at him. "I know it's hard, but... no one blames you"
"I guess what I'm... I just..." Draco being insecure and nervous did not help at all. It only made him feel more shitty about being angry.
Noah had seen everything happen from his own table at the Library. And he had done nothing. He had wanted to, but ever since third year he had tried to keep to himself and don't be noticed too much. He was proud of finally looking like he felt since forever but
Did Harry really want to hold his hand? It had been a soft brush at first and he read that as a sign so he simply took it... What if it had been a mistake? Harry looked surprised but his thumb caressed his skin so it couldn't be bad, could it?
There was a part of himself, one that he would never be able to ignore, that ached for it. A part that ached for the
. Cute, Potter, very cute" Draco walked past him towards the other two gryffindors, walking as if he owned the school. Christ, he seemed the same boy he had met all those years ago. Harry had to remind himself that Draco probably felt outnumbered and was faking his arrogance.
Harry frowned, feeling like he wasn't being completely fair with Malfoy. He had no idea how his childhood had been and... Malfoy wasn't like his father. That was pretty clear.
"If you all don't mind, I had a long day" Shit. Harry remembered the reason he had gone after him: what had happened at the library. "We can discuss this in the morning with the other two"
Someone tripped over their shoes, and Harry couldn't tell which one of them was, as he was dragged forwards to the bed. Not that he cared, honestly, he was much more focused on kissing Draco than anything else in the world.
Draco tried to count to three before speaking, but failed. "I won't go to the press before talking to him about it. That's not how we do things"
He closed the curtains around his bed, wishing he could throw a protective spell or a silencing one. No one was going to harm him, at least not physically, and pranks had really disappeared in Slytherin after the war.
"Oh, I didn't mean..." Ron gave him a confused yet curious look before shrugging "Then ask him, and we can all go back to normal, you know?"
to do" He bit down on his lower lip "Something that made me think that... the way I was... the way I
Harry fisted his hands, breathing quicker. They had physically fought before and it had never ended well. He didn't want to turn Draco's skin black and blue but he was so mad... and he knew Malfoy was as mad as he was.
"Dumbledore knew what you had to do" He whispered "He told Snape to... murder him. It was going to happen, regardless of your actions"
Harry had almost forgotten there was a lake near the village, that froze over during the winter and most people didn't visit because there was no real path there. How come Draco knew of this place? Did he like going there?
Even though she was sure Lucius had nothing to do with anything anymore -how could he? trapped in there-, it was amazing how good he was at reading a situation. Even with only bits and pieces of information.
He didn't answer, barely shrugging one of his shoulders. Draco's smile faltered and Harry wanted to kiss him.
There was a small pause while Draco had the fork inside his mouth, staring at him "So you eat like someone who just came out of a war" Harry grimaced but nodded "We have to change that, Potter"
It made no sense. Harry had never liked a boy before, never. He couldn't remember a time when he had checked out a guy or... or anything like that. Well, it's not like he had had any time to figure out what he liked or didn't like. He had just assumed... Why wouldn't he like girls? And he wasn't sure if he didn't like them now. Was he supposed to stop liking girls?
“I'm sure you are going to see him today, calm down” Hermione said, trying to hide her distaste for his relationship with Malfoy. It was strange, how despite the new found peace between her and Draco, she was still weary of their relationship. Harry was half sure it was because she was always looking out for him, and wasn't sure if he was the right one. Sometimes, he wanted to snap at her and just tell her off. But most of the times, he knew Draco was the one thing that felt like the future and that was enough.
"Now... Where were we? Ah, yes. Honesty" His tone was cheerful "Tell us, Draco, how do you feel about him?"
"Thanks" There was a brief pause and Elliot saw him move, sitting on the bed instead of laying there "You too"
"Well, I guess... I could ask around Slytherin but I don't think anyone is going to tell me anything"
He chewed on his lower lip, knowing he was going to get no answers that night. At least not the ones he wanted.
Harry quickly rose from his place, leaving the table before they could catch him. Hermione hadn't been serious and now he had shot himself in the foot. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This was bad.
"With me?" Draco pressed his back to the hallway wall, closing his eyes. His perfect hair a bit messy against the bricks. "Nothing is wrong with me"
"I know you know her name" No answer "It was fine. She... Is incredible, really" Draco's writing slowed down but he said nothing "No pushing, nothing. She told me she is worried, like everyone else. And... Well, she said I need my space and that's fine but she cares and wanted me to know she is there for me"
He frowned for a moment, the memory of that night hanging in between the two of them. Draco's birth had been extremely difficult. There had been a moment when she was sure she wouldn't make it. But she did. The crying of her child was still the most beautiful sound she had ever heard. When the midwife gave her the baby she wouldn't let him go. She could hear them saying things like
"Oh, fuck" Harry cursed, running a hand across his face "What happened? I leave for just a moment and..."
. They dont do that yet. And thanks to our little war, we have less powerful mages than ever. We were so stupid" he covered his eyes with both hands.
Harry looked at the familiar room, knowing full well he wouldn't see it again. He almost wanted to cry. Nothing was permanent in his life, was it? He would always have to leave whatever place that gave him comfort. Not to mention people...
The Aurors kept staring at them, and barely nodded when their names were called out. Harry didn't feel exactly safe at the moment, but at least they wouldn't have to see them all the time. Right?
At first it hadn't been hard, those first few months when they were painting walls, changing furniture and making love on every surface. The difficulties started after, when Harry got his first job and started spending more and more time away from home. Draco was proud of him, of course, but it left him with hours on his own in an empty house. He had started counting the days to his release, not that it would change much -where would he go? on a stroll through Diagon alley?- but at least he could breathe in the fresh air or something.
Draco swallowed visibly, and looked down at his left arm. Sometimes the bandages were extremely tight, he liked them like that. He liked it when it almost hurt.
Harry shook his head, pulling back and going a bit down, his lips brushing against his skin. Draco had to close his eyes, feeling the soft dry kisses on his scars. They were slow, methodic, Harry wanted him to feel this as softly as he was doing it.
"Ah, yes, Draco. I wanted to speak to you" He touched Malfoy's shoulder, pulling him away from sight "The headmistress wishes to see you, don't worry, you are not in trouble"
"Not as much as I would like." That was surprising. "And I don't think she would like to know me... and with what happened to her daughter"
"I guess we're family" Draco whispered, a pale hand caressing the hair of the young baby who had no idea what had happened to his parents. They simply never came home. They would never hold him again.
It was all extremely confusing, but his head was somewhere else. Actually, he was completely focused on Draco. And Draco was only focused on him.
Oh, right, she didn't know. Harry blushed at how much he knew about the situation -and about Malfoy- but tried to disguise it as a consequence of the cold.
People stared as they left the library. They only sat next to each other and barely spoke, so if anyone was watching it would've looked like two friends studying or maybe two
Harry rubbed one of his own cheeks and looked down at his books, he should really do some studying if he wanted to become an auror. But did he? It was a dangerous job. Maybe the adrenaline would make him feel alive again. Yeah, he... He needed that, right? The rush, the danger. And if he died, well, he would die making the world a better place. As it should be. As it was meant to be. Harry closed his book, feeling overwhelmed by a dark feeling. It was as if something took all the drive out of his body. It was nothing like a dementor, he just felt... Nothing. No desire to even breathe because, what was the point?
"Fuck off" he half meant it, but he hesitated and suddenly Harry hated the fact that he didn't have his wand. Surely with it he would feel safe enough to tease him. Or maybe he got mad at the idea of Malfoy being
Draco frowned "How would you know that? Nobody knows shit about Longbottom's parents, Potter. I didn't know. I wouldn't know if my auntie hadn't bragged about it every waking moment" He closed his eyed, pained. Memories flooding back, for sure. And he could understand why. Bellstrix Lestrange had been a horrible human, sadistic, without a shred of empathy. Harry remembered her laughter and her taunts after killing Sirius. Oh, he hated her still. What things had she done to the poor Longbottoms? And how would she tell it?
The back of the building was deserted, but well lit, the area probably used by employees to take breaks or dine. A small table with two chairs was set up for them, and even if it wasn't fancy, it looked nice.
Finding a piece of cloth in the dark wasn't the easiest, even if some moonlight came through the windows. Draco was about to give up and just dry his hand over his pajamas when the lights turned on, as if they had a life of their own.
"Draco?" Neville stared, surprised for a few moments, before something dawned on him "Oh! We were supposed to meet at the... Oh, damn, I forgot! I saw the clouds and thought it would rain so I stayed inside and... Completely forgot. You must be pissed"
Harry didn't want to show him the map, it's not that he didn't trust Draco it's just that the map was still something... personal. It was weird just opening up that much to someone. Even if he wanted to.
"Draco? Are you here?" He whispered, fear creeping through his body. What if he wasn't there? If he was unable to find him? What if he was already...?
Draco wanted to say that he wanted to know, that he would listen to her story without saying anything or interrupting but he knew his mother's word was final. It had always been like this, especially about Andromeda, or Bellatrix, or any of her family members. If he thought about it, not even the Dark Lord had mentioned another Black in front of her.
"This has nothing to do with how you raised me" He was getting desperate, was he never going to understand? "You wouldn't marry a man, and I wouldn't marry a woman. It's like that"
For a brief moment Harry didn't know what to do or say. What was the plan? To get drunk? Elliot seemed a bit uncomfortable, holding the bottle in one hand with everyone staring at him.
Harry moved through the corridors without being seen, and went straight for the Infirmary, if he was lucky they would still be there discussing what had happened. If not, he would have to find a way to get a teacher to talk to him about it, and that could prove difficult.
"You don't have to do whatever I want. Harry" there was a softness in his voice when he moved away from the stone column, his hand touching his arm very briefly "You don't have to impress me with your heroics, or be whatever it is you think I want. Do you understand that?"
Told you this was going to be a short one. But it needed to be because... structure. At least the structure I have in my head for this haha
"My... my fault... everything" Harry mumbled in between sobs, not fully aware of what he was saying but knowing how much he meant it. If he had died -or never been born- his parents would be alive. Someone else would have killed Voldemort. Sirius would be alive. Lupin would be alive. Tonks would be alive. Dobby would be alive. Everyone that ever loved him would live. They would all be alive if he were dead.
Something had jumped out the bathroom, a thing that moved like wildfire but had eyes and claws. Draco wasn't sure he had ever seen anything like it in his books or
"I was just going to walk him back to Slytherin" Harry lied, his gaze defiant. He knew she wasn't trustworthy. "Why can't I? What happened?"
Harry sat up with his legs crossed under his body and stared at the boy who had dark eye bags and his hair slightly out of order. Maybe he had nightmares too?
His parents pretty much knew, now the school knew... It was just a matter of time before the press...
"No, we don't. We can keep this between you and me and use it to our advantage. If no one else knows any of it, we could... figure out who is behind this. If we start leaking the information, then... we just won't know"
"Hey" They had started talking to each other in public ever since the library, and people had noticed but Draco wasn't exactly sure what they were saying about it. He could feel the looks and the whispers and the muffled laughs. He would have to take care of that.
Harry shook his head and looked away, he couldn't tell them that and he doubted Malfoy would agree to a meeting with Ron and Hermione. "I will ask him if he wants to... if he wants your help"
That made sense, and Harry felt the need to go back inside and scream to those kids. But he didn't. Somehow, spending time with Draco was better. He had to admit he enjoyed the peace and quiet of being alone, even if it was unfair.
Draco didn't want to think about it, because he knew the type of pressure it could put on their relationship. It could break it entirely, all those opinions, all that hate. And the last thing he wanted was to be left alone with the feelings he had.
He tried not to run towards the Astronomy Tower, but it was really hard to control himself when his mind had only thought of Malfoy and their 'fight' earlier that day.
They walked back in a comfortable silence, despite their little moment before. With each day, Harry realized how right they were for the other.
"Yes... Yes, please" it was hard not to beg, his mind racing. He wasn't a complete prude, he knew exactly what Draco was talking about but he had never felt it. Hell, he hadn't even wondered how it would feel...
He looked over at them, resting his fork next to his plate because his food was pretty underwhelming and he wasn't hungry anyway. "I am just tired"
After a few moments of stroking him -not quite sure how, but not stopping, following what seemed to make Harry whimper- he felt Harry's hand under his boxers to do the same. It was almost too much, almost enough to make him end right there.
Potter" He was tense. Did he want to fight? He probably did. Harry was about to speak when he saw Ron walking towards them, but he wasn't alone. Fuck. Ginny was right next to him, looking exhausted from Quidditch. Her cheeks were slightly pink and her hair tousled. Harry wondered if he should've felt attracted to her then. He had been, once -right?.
"Harry! Come say hello!" Charlie screamed at him from a side of the room and so he did. Smiling, he approached and hugged him. The Weasleys had always been a second family to him.
Harry knew that was true, but Molly Weasley had a lot to deal with and he didn't want to be a burden. Or perhaps he didn't want to be in the presence of a woman who had lost a son. Perhaps he was that selfish.
The kid grew pale, looking around for assistance but no one seemed to want to interrupt. Of course, every single table in the vicinity was eavesdropping.
Deep down, he knew he would never be, so he had to just force himself to keep moving, to face whatever came his way. To be brave.
Draco pulled the chin from his shoulder and stopped touching his back, taking the letter in between his hands to read it more closely.
"Look... I just asked to help you because I don't want you to go to Azkaban" Draco opened his eyes slightly, looking at him as tired as they both felt "I... I don't want you to go anywhere, actually"
in danger the first time? Yes, he could have said no to the mark but he had been sixteen! If he had done anything, it had been
"Thanks" Harry mumbled when they parted, starting to walk again and unable to stare at Draco's face. He hadn't cried, which Draco found incredibly odd. What would it take for Harry to...?
"I... Always assumed I would have at least one" Draco laid down on the bed again, face up this time and didn't stare at him. "But I honestly have no clue what I want"
"There was no need for that, Draco" His father spoke very calmly, walking away from the table that looked odd now. Who was going to eat all that food? No one was in the mood anymore. "This came in the mail for you" He dropped an unsealed letter on his lap, giving him a look. Draco didn't know if he was disappointed or angry, because he couldn't look him in the eye "I'll be with your mother, who has done nothing but support you"
Harry hesitated in front of the door to the 'safe room', he wasn't sure if Malfoy was going to be there or if he should even be going there. What had happened had not been his fault, he didn't have to feel so uncomfortable... But he did. He was sure Malfoy would be in a
or the way they both fought over the years or Malfoy's fucking side during the war he felt rage all over his body.
"So, Malfoy" Draco looked at the young Weasley girl. Ugh. "What are you going to do after the school year's over?"
"I'm okay... we are okay" He repeated, and Draco kept nodding, one of his hands on one of Harry's wrists, the other one still clutching his shirt.
To tell or not to tell. And if he did, what would he say? Would he say that he was doing it because he had fallen for Potter of all people? Would he say the war broke him and while picking up the pieces he realized he didn't wish to live a lie anymore?
Harry frowned, but remembered the boy couldn't see him in the dark, so he spoke "No. I don't want those"
of his friends, but it took too much energy. Pansy was the only one that had gone to see him, which told him enough of his standing amongst the 'high' society. It was clear he wouldn't be getting invited to many parties once everything passed. Somehow, it didn't bother him as much as it should.
He stopped for a brief moment in front of his house's door, trying to gather his thoughts and look as composed as possible before going inside. His lip hurt like all hells and even though he was quite skilled at occlumency it still took incredible amounts of energy to resist the serum long enough.
"I was just going to-..." He tried, not looking at her and not really knowing how to explain whatever had happened. Hermione gave him no time to think an answer, she hugged him tightly until he relaxed and hugged back. It was weird, having friends that knew how to handle him in almost every situation. Perhaps that's what happens after risking your life time after time for each other.
Oh. Harry nodded and quickly dipped his quill inside the inkwell and proceeded to write. Merlin, his writing looked like a 5 year olds next to Draco's. Well, it's not like anyone actually cared to teach him how to do it.
They both had ditched class, but only Draco was the guilty one? No surprise Draco was so uncomfortable around aurors all the time.
Elliot tried not to look scared, because it was unlike her to be so angry. Well, he would be pissed too if he had to deal with Bea for as long as she had to. Noah had his eyes closed, sweating as if he had just been running.
"We shouldn't tell him, 'mione" Ron said, walking hand in hand with her back towards the Tower. It was better if they kept quiet, otherwise their friend would go ballistic like last time.
He had gone back to school not by choice, but out of duty -and the Ministry, of course-, wanting to find himself. To know what to do once he went back home. And oddly enough, the world had showed him a new path. A path with someone that, somehow, had always been there in his life. In the parts that mattered.
the room for him or anything, but that blonde almost white-ish hair was impossible to ignore. And after all those letters the least thing he could do was go say hi. Especially before they reached the castle.
Hi! I hope you liked this one. This update came quickly because I was writting this chapter almost as the same time as chapter 22 haha!
Malfoy smiled, but his eyes remained closed and he looked extremely tired now. Maybe they weren't so different after all.
Draco shrugged, resting his shoulder against one of the bed posts. "Sometimes I think I do... But I don't think he knows, not really"
as if his job  wasn't being an auror but a salesman or something. Harry wondered if he would look that
Suddenly he realized that was the first time in a long while he was actually excited about something.
Movement caught his attention and he turned, finding the ghost of the little girl near the sinks. "What do you want?"
Draco scoffed "Fucking raised by muggles, weren't you?" he meant it as an insult, great. Just great. It wasn't going to end well "People knowing my Father is weak is bad for us. Terribly so. Makes people who should be afraid of us not afraid, and it makes our allies
Harry shrugged "For what I heard you were petrified... But those things sound normal to me. I get the invasion of privacy thing but it wasn't such a big deal"
Draco looked up at her, right as she grabbed his left arm and pinned it down to the table, his other arm clutched now by the guy that had a hand on his shoulder.
Harry started stacking the books they had already gone through, placing the others inside his bag. He could feel the boy's eyes on him the whole time.
Lucius almost smiled. "Good" He got up, brushing the grass off his pants "I'll be inside if you need me. Hopefully your mother didn't burn down the kitchen"
Draco turned around, still between his arms and stared at his face. "Big house, I like that. Why upstairs?"
"Malfoy... Look, it's complicated. We don't know if she..." Harry sighed. Yes, of course he knew. But thinking about it didn't make him feel any better so why bother? "Can we talk about something else?"
?- and went to sit next to him, touching his hair and then his shoulder. He wasn't jealous anymore. Well, maybe a little bit, but he knew Hermione loved him and Harry was not interested in her. Good.
"He was... Through Snape's eyes he was a tormentor, a bully" Harry sounded so ashamed and disappointed Draco wanted to kiss him until he couldn't think anymore "I saw his memories"
Harry got up in the bed next to him, closing the curtains as he always did. It was a reflex at this point, probably, but it made him feel safe. He wondered if the Gryffindor felt the same way.
The first few steps towards the manor's entrance were the hardest. Draco tried to remain calm, holding Harry's hand. His fingers stilled and he pulled away, eyes roaming the building, head flooded with memories. He had believed he wouldn't care what other people thought of him, but being faced with a moment he dreaded all his life was different. They had been outed as a couple a while back already, but being seen together, holding hands, touching, kissing... Draco felt the need to run away.
Ginny threw daggers at him before pulling out her wand "As you wish" she flickered it over her head and her red hair turned... Blonde. And not just blonde, but white-ish blonde. Oh. Merlin. Draco seemed as if he was about to murder her, and Harry wanted to bury himself underneath the floor boards.
"Hm" Draco shrugged and clearly didn't mean to elaborate further. Harry had no clue what that meant but decided to let it be.
Not many students came back to finish their seventh year, and the ones that did were still trying to go back to normal.
them since he was walking backwards. Draco, somehow, didn't seem to struggle at all, while his hands unbuttoned his shirt, exploring the skin immediately and almost causing Harry to trip and fall backwards.
"Not necessarily. The room might be telling us to trust them and work with them. But we can't rule them out as suspects, not really"
If he felt like this after just touching each other, how would he feel when they...? It both excited and terrified him.
Narcissa worried for him as well. Draco wasn't as strong as them, he wasn't made with the same materials they were. He would never be happy with the choices he had had to make. And Narcissa only wanted her son to be happy. Her only son.
There was no fondness towards Draco but it was fine, Harry couldn't expect everyone to treat him how he did. It would take time, but they would get there and the whole world would see how incredible Malfoy truly was.
"Very well, I won't sugarcoat it. I know you hate that" Even if his words seemed confident, he could see Draco's uneasiness "I know this has been a dream of yours, and I have no doubt in my mind that you would be... Excellent. You would do a lot of good, for a lot of people" He shrugged "That being said, I think you are unfit to do the work in your current state. And... Even if you were well, the work would push you to... Dangerous situations, to pain and loss. You would never be... At peace" Draco tried to read his face. If he was honest, Harry had no idea what expression he had on.
Harry chuckled, looking at where their shoes had been abandoned. Wouldn't it be better to try this on solid ground? He felt a bit dizzy from having his hand held so... "Alright, sure. But don't let me fall"
It's not that Elliot hadn't tried to hear what they were saying, but his mind was completely focused on Noah and how... bad he was. He had tried to say something, but his eyes had been wild and he spoke complete nonsense...
A small tornado had gone through the room or Draco had had a fit, because almost everything was upside down. Yeah, hurricane Malfoy had gone through the place.
people at the school were really close minded. It was weird how Elliot wasn't like that. They had become friends during a really hard time in his life and Elliot never said anything stupid.
Harry felt like someone was pulling the ground from under him. How could she know about this? They had been careful and no prefect had found them. No ghost had seen them. Their friends wouldn't go and tell on them either.
What the hell? The books stopped falling after a few minutes of having the magic shield up. Thank Merlin.
"They need to see what you are! So they won't forget" The girl was getting impatient at the other boy's hesitance "Just do it! You know it's there. You know what he
"Harry, is something wrong?" McGonagall asked, looking up from a pile of papers that apparently needed her signature. Harry was growing used to the idea of her in that office. If he tried enough, he could see the office looked completely different. And, of course, there was no one better for the position.
"Look, it's just..." Harry moved away, opening the microwave and pulling the bloated paper bag out. When he opened it, a hot wave of steam poured out and he had to back away a bit "that thing about feeling worthless, you know?"
Narcissa almost looked surprised "I-... When you were a baby, a tiny, tiny baby" Her expression was soft, loving "your father and I would look at you while you slept... You were so fragile and perfect" Her voice broke and she swallowed "Oh, we had no idea what to do" A smile appeared and Draco smiled back "We would spend hours with you, just... Holding you. It feels like yesterday"
Harry knew the real reason was that Malfoy didn't want people seeing them together in public and it hurt a little bit. He was unsure as to why he felt that way. Was it because of what people in Slytherin might say? Maybe being his friends would undermine his place as a...? Ugh, Harry's head hurt when he tried to think about all those things. He was sure Draco thought about everything before he acted, and had no idea how he did it.
The moment Harry reached out for the door, strong iron chains appeared from the walls and created an 'x' over it, keeping them locked inside.
Harry closed the map for a moment, leaving it under his pillow, to lay on his side and touch Draco's cheek.
The bookcases were so tall they couldn't see where the hallways lead, they had no way of knowing if there was a way out or if they were going the right way.
"Noah, a friend of Elliot's. Uhm, Harry and Draco talked to us about what you are doing. The investigation"
They stood like this until Harry moved his arms to his back, pressing himself even tighter against Draco. They didn't speak or move for a long time. Draco wanted to find the words, but there weren't enough.
He decided not to ask about his father because that would never go well. Lucius wasn't a good man. Was he? And Draco didn't deserve to go through whatever hell that man would put him through for this.
"I know, I know. But we don't know him like you do now. I mean... we haven't spent time together, have we? But I am on your side, Harry" She moved away and kissed his cheek "Even if your taste is really, really bad"
"We should go inside, it's about to rain. Neville probably forgot about our study session anyway. Let's go"
"Yes... But we will have to go back to the castle early in the morning" Harry moved to stare at him, fingers touching his lower back. "I kind of wish we could stay right here"
"Here, come on" Harry tugged at his robe, turning around the building until they found a back door. Draco wasn't sure he knew about this entrance to the place.
"I guess you are right" Harry smirked, trying to find some comfort in that, because his friend was right, no? It was as simple as going down to the ministry and asking to see him. They wouldn't say no to the hero of the Wizarding world, would they?
would know. This has nothing to do with who raised us... No, you know? It does. You were raised by monsters, therefore you know this monstrous magic!"
There was a brief moment of silence among the group, until one of the aurors, the young one, spoke again. "We can't be sure of it. The girl was pretty shaken and that ghost is not speaking to us"
Yeah, Harry did know. In fact, it was all he had heard the blond talk about for days. He knew how important it was for the slytherin, but still, he had been jumpy all week and Harry had no clue why.
Draco smirked, alright maybe it hadn't been lucky to find him in there. "It's alright, something came up and I didn't show up anyway"
She rolled her eyes "Nothing. The headmistress wanted to inform us... some things have happened. She believes it would be best for Draco to come here during the weekends"
Hi! This one took longer to write than I expected! Sorry about that, I had one of the big career exams and had to focus on that for a bit. Also, the next chapter has been on my mind since I started this FF so I'm excited to finally write it down.
He closed his eyes when Bell started to recite something in latin. Normal spells would be just one word or two, but this seemed a full ritual, like the ones in muggle books. But those were fiction and this was reality and he didn't want to die.
"Hm, I guess I couldn't know anything about that" He was being sarcastic and this time he didn't feel like choking him.
After their first time together, Draco laid down on his bed unable to sleep, replaying the same things over and over. How comfortable he had felt, how safe, how loved. He had done things, and let things be done to him that were, without a doubt, shameful. Things anyone could use to embarrass him, things he wouldn't have allowed if it were anyone else. But it was Harry. The one boy he wanted, he had always wanted, really.
Alright, it was now or never. He walked close to Malfoy to get out of Slytherin, not caring if he bumped into him or not.
Morning found them like that, tangled in each other, half-naked. Harry had set up a charm to wake them at 5 am, to give them time to run back to the castle without anyone realizing they were gone. So even if they wanted to rest under the sheets or kiss or touch each other again, they couldn't. Breaking the school rules
was the cause of it. He smiled against his skin, moving his hands to his hips before going back to his lips. Pulling him forward a bit, Harry's leg found its way in between Draco's.
“Eat,” Pansy said when he noticed it and continued her talk with Hermione about her time in muggle Paris and if she knew how to properly use the eyelash curler because when she tried she had to regrew her eyelashes.
“Okay, I know how stubborn you are, but let’s not push our luck, if something weird happens I promise we’ll take Malfoy seriously,” promised the ginger boy and even though it didn’t felt like enough Harry had to agree with him, with all the events that had happened since Sirius death he had been a little bit too paranoid and maybe, just maybe, he was seeing things where there was nothing to see.
They arrived home absolutely exhausted, they had walked so much and they ended up buying more things than planned, which was okay because according to Draco "he deserved it".
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, I would love to spend the rest of my life with you, but for now I would love to spend as much time as I can with you"
“No, I saw her struggling with it the whole hour like the rest of us, maybe Harry just hid his talent in order to annoy Snape,” she joked and maybe in another time Draco would’ve laughed at it, but lately his relationship with the ex-potions professor was on thin ice, no longer trusting him.
“I mean, he wasn’t alone, sometimes all you need are friends that help you in the way,” mumbled Draco as he opened his Herbology book looking for the information he needed for his essay.
"Yeah, but it's awesome," he replied as he saw how Ginny managed to win ye another game of flying hockey against Ron, who was screaming that she cheated somehow. And how Hermione was proving that muggle sports aren't that bad, while winning in a game agains't Fred.
"Hell no, I don't want a million needles on my skin Harry, muggles are out of their minds for doing so"
“I’m sorry, I didn’t find you right away and they offered to share with me” explained the blond with a quiet voice while rubbing his shoulder.
"Don't you dare do this to me again! You stupid little brat," Harry is quite sure that he's crushing Draco with this hug, but he couldn't care less.
“We should play a quidditch match today, it’s been a while and I miss beating you at quidditch,” said Draco as he sat on the Gryffindor table, he had just ingested an elixir to induce euphoria and he was praying for not having any side effects, he just wanted to feel happy even if it wasn't real.
"Why I always find you in the middle of a conflict between what you want and what you think you deserve?" a voice said behind him startling the hell out of the boy.
“I wouldn’t have brought you if I didn’t” he answered as he approached the graves, the first time he had been here was with Hermione, and since then Harry never returned here alone. It didn’t felt right, so he always returned with someone important to him, and even if he didn’t stay for long it was enough for him to tell his parents about that person, and this time that person was Draco because even if he has always been an important part of his life this time, this time it was a different kind of important.
“I think dad is getting permission to spend Christmas at home, and I’m scared of what could happen, not because I fear him, I mean, I already know what he’s capable of,” he half-laughed, “but because I know he’s going to invite Theodore and his parents so they can talk more about the arrangement and I don’t was
be alone. And don't get him wrong, Draco wasn't complaining about his childhood, he had all the toys he wanted and sometimes he could manage to make a hose-elf (almost always Dobby) to play with him. He wonder what happened to him, last he heard Harry set him free (and he was glad because out of their servants he was one of the most poorly treated, or at least he heard Granger said that once).
“I don’t know, I just like to watch people when they think no one is watching them, you looked lost, you don’t anymore but you did,” she started to braid her hair “and Draco looked angry all the time, but then he started to look scared and sad and now he just looks broken, like he’s given up, and I know why you’re asking me this because I know that he was a jerk but I don’t think he ever meant the words he said. I don’t believe he trusted his dad way too much and looked up to him and he bullied so many people but in the end, there was someone above him bullying him so… Do you want to know when I forgave him?”
So in his mind, Harry told them about how he and Draco had been hanging out more, and how he was worried about the blond, he started to recall all the little details about the other boy, how his eyes disappeared when he smiled, or how he bite his bottom lip when he was concentrated. He also told them that for the first time in forever he wasn't failing Potions and that he actually started to enjoy the class. Harry started to tear up when he began telling them that he was happy, genuinely happy, that he felt his life was worth living and that he was scared because he wasn't used to be okay but that he was trying his best to make the best out of every day. And finally, he told them about his concerns about the future, because even if being an Auror seemed the obvious next step he was honestly tired of that stressful life, but then again he loves the adrenaline and the satisfaction of doing what was right. He promised them to start visiting them more frequently and with that, he just stared at the grave, he knew he was crying but he didn't know what to do.
"Oh, but that's where you're wrong Draco, I'm left with a bitch who helps me relieve my needs while looking pretty beside me, and I get to make your life miserable for being a failure, just like your father, at following the Dark Lords wishes," the boy got dangerously close to Malfoy but he didn't coward
"I like it too, but you know what I love the most? How pretty you are, and how confident you've gotten over this months, that you decided to take charge of your life again and let me be part of it," Harry smiles while kissing Draco's temple, "but what I love the most is how you look with flowers in your head because you remind me of a nymph"
But Harry has also learned that Draco was depressed, that Draco feels so guilty for everything that happened that he constantly tries to overcompensate it not caring if he hurts himself in the process. He has also learned that Draco now likes to make himself look smaller in the hallways, and how little he eats during meals. He hates how bony his body has become and his heart aches at the way he can touch his index with his thumb around Draco's wrist. He hates how Draco put to sleep that fire hi used to have, and he sometimes wonders if he ever had a fire at all. And he just learned that Draco Malfoy cuts himself, adding scars to his body in order to try to hear, the wounds in his mind.
“Our roommates are not bad, we got Neville, a Hufflepuff guy and Draco,” said Ron excited as he guided Harry to their dorm, quickly claiming the bed on the centre so he could have harry on the left and Neville on the right, who had already claimed his bed. The Hufflepuff guy, whose name was Jackson chose the bed next to Neville which meant Draco was going to be next to him. It kinda made him excited, but as soon as he put on his pyjamas all the emotions he felt that day crashed and he felt so tired that maybe that night he would sleep without waking up every 3 hours, even though it was all over sometimes his mind didn’t think so as well, he didn’t get nightmares as much as he used to, but he was still easily triggered by small things that only Ron and Hermione knew the reasons behind them, but he was okay with it. Because he just survived a war, and it was okay to not be okay, he found good coping mechanisms thanks to his friends and family, he was healing so it bothered him that Draco Malfoy was just surviving.
“Mmm not really, Pansy and Blaise are going to go to Hogsmeade and I don’t really feel like attending to the Halloween feast” answered Draco, they were walking side to side and the fact that Harry was now taller than Draco made the raven-haired boy smiled, it wasn’t by much but enough to be noticeable. “And you? Do you have any plans?”
"It is okay, and when you see them, can you promise to not feel guilty? We both have scars, and we both had done things we're not proud of so, there's no need to feel guilty for something that happened so long ago and I deserve anyways-"
“Well, that sure ain’t gonna make this whole situation easier,” said Harry hiding his face between his hands as a sign of exasperation and he heard Ginny sigh.
Harry felt a little bit out of place, the dishes on the menu had difficult names and Blaise was asking what kind of wine they wanted. But part of a relationship was to learn to enjoy your partner interests, even if that meant smiling like an idiot while your boyfriend ordered the closest thing to fish and chips. Then again, Draco had suffered too because being so exposed to the muggle and wizarding world has been hard, but the beautiful smile that only grew bigger with time was so worth it.
“Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you'll find that all of your endeavors succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead. Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. Issue one doubt, however. Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence.”
"Oh yeah, I can't believe how much I've missed because of who I used to be, if I knew Gryffindors could be great company- well, there's nothing to do know, right? How about you show me how to play with this machines, can't be the only ones who aren't having fun" his boyfriend said as he offered his hand, which Harry took smiling and dragging him to one of the games.
“…and maybe you could help Harry with potions, honestly there’s so much I can do after trying all my methods in 6 years!” he heard Hemione finished and when he raised his eyebrow demanding an explanation all he earned was a ‘later’ look from her.
"Get out of here! Last time you tried to kill him!" she shouted him once she saw him, this only made Draco cried harder.
“And I thought I’ve seen it all,” said Pansy while sitting next to Draco, her eyelashes were curled and he almost smiled at the thought of Hermione teaching her how to use a muggle artefact. Her hair was in the same haircut as always, but shorter than he had ever seen, it suits her.
“I didn’t realize this one was already opened, a pet peeve of mine is opening something new when you still have some left,” said with chuckle popping the chocolates into his mouth and continued to talk with Ron about their trip to Australia.
"Well, that's normal considering the blood loss Mr. Malfoy, why don't you go and ask Madame Pomfrey for the potions Ms. Granger?"
- Now he had to carry some sort of candy or chocolate for Draco to eat otherwise he would get grumpy, which wasn't actually a con because the blond look adorable
"Yeah, I did, but I only realized on our fourth year, it became harder to have your attention and most of my friends felt like connections instead of whatever you and your friends had. Today I have Pansy and Blaise, but back then I had no one and that started to bother me a lot which is why I took a lot of dumb decisions."
“Well, I was going to go to Godric's Hollow for a bit and then Trick-or-Treating with Teddy” answered Harry as they exit the library, he could sense Draco’s confusion.
And that’s how he ended in the library on a Friday afternoon rather than in the Quidditch pitch with Ron and Ginny, those traitors leaving him with the two nerds in front of him, he could honestly die from this betrayal. But Hermione had already kicked him in the ribs with her elbow two complaints ago, and his best friend was right, she really had boney elbows.
"Oh yes, I'm having trouble too, is it the last problem?" Draco nodded just to shift the attention from him to her and attempted to listen because he was indeed having some troubles, but then again he had a lot of those. He had tried to solve them the night before but a panic attack ruined his plans and he ended up crying with his face between his hands wishing there was someone beside him, a certain boy came to mind but he tried to ignore those feelings as best as he could.
One hour later and a small vial of Felix Felicis in his hands later made Harry think that maybe this book would be a good way to gain Slughorn's trust.
“I did try to warn him, but he was worse than a little kid refusing to re-apply sunscreen when I say so,” the curly-haired said as they searched for an empty wagon. He honestly wasn’t paying much attention to his surroundings, so it wasn’t a surprise when he bumped into someone, what indeed was a surprise is that someone happened to be Draco Malfoy.
The game laws really good, Ginny was really good but so was Blaise, and that stupid snitch was really good at hiding, but then he saw the golden object, but so did Harry and let's be honest, he was a Slytherin before he was Harry's boyfriend so a little bit of cheating never hurt anybody.
“Pans, you’re dating Blaise, I swear that was something we thought it wouldn’t be possible” joked Draco and she rolled her eyes “I swear! He’s so cold and masculine and then there is you, with a thousand friends and making out with Daphne every time you got drunk” Harry was shocked from this, he never thought Pansy was bisexual, but he guesses this shock wasn’t interpreted as that because Pansy asked in a very defensive tone if he had a problem with it.
"You check the Astronomy tower and I'll check Myrtle's bathroom, those are the only places he likes to go when he's sad, send a message if you find him," said Harry and started to run to the bathroom.
"Me neither, but I'm glad you let me be part of it," answered Harry while putting his arm around Draco. "Now about that package."
When the class was finally over Harry followed his friends to the Great hall, he was craving pudding and really hoped the was some tonight. When they found a seat in the Gryffindor table and he saw the pudding he smiled remembering the day he met Luna and started to savour the dish in front of him, nodding occasionally at something Ron said and laughing at Seamus and Dean's stories.
"Oh, so bossy, at least Draco likes that, that bitch never knows what to do unless you tell him, so annoying, but his mouth it's so worth it, right?" and that was when Harry lost it and hexed Theo, if Madame Pomfrey didn't arrive at that second the next spell would've been Sectusembra, knowing well how no one knew the counter spell but him and Snape.
"I wasn't with her, I was with a new friend." he replied and changed the topic to avoid more questions.
And so here he was, in front of his cauldron with no idea where to start, that was until he opened the book and saw notes all over the place written in terrible handwriting (not that he could say that he was better, but he could at least brag about it being more legible thank this one), deciding that this notes may help him to make something more acceptable than whatever he would’ve managed without them he started to follow those instructions instead.
"Stop lying, I hate when people lie!" Draco shouted as he scratched his arms, Harry wasn't sure if he was trying to make the cuts bleed more or if this was just his anxiety acting up
"Why are you like this? Why are you gaining from this Theo?" Draco dared to ask, he wasn't ready for the answers but this stupid confidence won't last forever, not for a long time at least.
Harry's eyes watch the scene not knowing what to do because one part of him said ‘let him go, you’re not even friends’ and the other part said ‘well yeah, and if you let him go you might never be friends to bloody idiot’. But his hopes were restored when Draco turn his head back and mouthed a ‘thank you’ with a smile and continued to walk with his friends.
“Of course not, is part of him, and he’s so perfect and those scars held meaning and a lot of stories I would love to hear once he’s ready to tell them-“
It wasn't the first time Draco did something out of the ordinary but it was the first time that Draco treated Teddy with such love and tranquillity, it was like the anxiety around his distant family never existed and that they had been coexisting for years and not months.
“Not really, you just need to answer something first,” Draco started and when the other boy nodded he took a deep breath, “I need you to promise that you’ll be patient with me, you’ll never lie to me and you’re not going to waste your time with me, whenever you feel like this has no purpose you’ll break things up”
“Because I love Harry like a brother and I would hate to see him brokenhearted just because you’re trying to sabotage yourself, life has been shit for you so why do you keep trying to ruin it even more?”
"I've missed you too mother, did you like your Christmas present? I was going to wait and give it to you myself but I know how special traditions are for you"
"Well, now that that is solved, would you guy like a cup of tea?" offered Andy and they both nodded, no one said a word about how Teddy's hair now resembled the platinum tone of Draco's.
“I had a hunch, I’m glad I was right,” he said as he began to look around, several minutes passed until he decided to talk again, “I was here that night, you know?” he saw Malfoy tense in the corner of his eye and waited for him to say something but when that didn’t happen he let himself continue “Dumbledore petrified me and hid me with the invisible cape, I saw the desperation in your eyes and even if I didn’t understand it then now I know that you were just a pawn in a game way bigger than us, so when you saved me those two times I was so confused and tried to still hate you, but in the end, I couldn’t do it because you were just a kid like I-“
"He hates you for being gay?" Draco didn't want flinch, but he did. It was one thing to know that about himself, and another to hear it out loud.
"There will be more people there, it's a dinner party after all... Don't be so worried" Draco said, staring at the man in front of the mirror.
"I think we can read the rest" He whispered, taking one of the papers with notes and leaning in to share it with Draco.
He remembered that discussion. It was risky for Astoria to have a lover, but at the time he had approved purely for selfish reasons: if she had a lover, she wouldn't ask anything of him. It had been the moment that cemented their friendship. He knew something that could destroy her, and she surely suspected he was hiding something.
Harry didn't like thinking about the trials, or the newspapers after the trials but sometimes he couldn't help it and his mind went back to Draco. He had been surprised to see him there.
He covered his face with his arms and tried to become a little ball and disappear. So many nights and days he had pretended not to exist with the Durlseys, he could do it again, right? He could just disappear and be a ghost and perhaps everyone would be better off. Draco would certainly be better off.
"Ron" Hermione soothed, moving a bit closer to her boyfriend "This has been hard on us all. Even on Draco. We don't really know him, and if Harry trusts him... maybe we should too"
Draco uncovered his mouth, breathing heavily. There was light coming from the half closed door, just enough to see Harry clearly.
It was fine, really. Harry had grown used to having magic, but he had been raised like a muggle and he knew how to cook and shower and make his bed without it. It wouldn't be a big change... although he didn't quite trust the ministry with his wand. He didn't trust many people these days.
It was a deep kiss, filled with all the things they didn't say, the things they couldn't say. It was a kiss for the two of them, for the rest of the World didn't exist anymore. Nothing existed then, only them.
The blond was completely taken by surprise, unable to speak. His arms were limp at his sides and he looked at him. Had he thought he didn't know? Or, worse, did he believe Harry had forgotten?
"Exactly" Draco didn't even look at Elliot "It would state the place, the time, the conditions. If someone is going to do this... we will know where, when and how"
"I got us permission" Harry smirked "Well... kind of. Trust me on this one?" He walked towards him, clearly wanting to grab one of his hands. Draco moved slightly away, they were outdoors, anyone could just... see them.
Draco smiled pulling him closer and sliding his hand down inside his last piece of clothing. The feeling made him dig his fingertips on Harry's back, searching for his lips with his own. Thoughts raced through his mind, things he wanted to say to him:
and deep down he knew violence solved nothing. But, again, if someone instigated hate after what he had been through, he would probably lose his cool.
Huh. Draco wasn't sure if he had heard him correctly. His father never apologized. Not to him. Lucius had always been 'his father' and therefore he had no reason to apologize, ever. If there was one thing Draco had had to learn growing up it was how his father was always right. No matter what he said or did, he was right. And everyone had to follow. Why the change of heart? Why apologize when Draco was sure he had felt everything he said the night before?
Narcissa got up so fast Draco almost expected her wand to be raised, but of course she didn't have it. He had never seen her mother as hurt and angry as she was then. He was sure she was going to slap him, and perhaps she should, but he didn't care. He needed to say it! He needed to. He was tired of so much hypocrisy. He was tired of not knowing anyone from his extended family. True, he didn't have much family left, but... Things could have been different. Much, much different.
Draco went silent once they reached the bedroom, and it probably was because they weren't alone. Ron and Hermione were sitting on Ron's bed, talking calmly about something Harry had no clue. Shit, he really needed to spend more time with them.
Harry grabbed his face between both his hands, smiling and trying to calm himself. The adrenaline was still running through his veins, pumping blood all over his body and making his head not think straight.
What was going on? Harry felt something squeezing at his chest and his brain trying to figure out exactly what he felt. The answers were terrifying, so much so he was unable to see it.
Shit, how late was it? Did they have any classes? Harry was sure he didn't until after lunch, but missing breakfast altogether would put a mark on his back.
"Why?" Harry didn't answer "The investigation? Potter, maybe it's better if we let it rest. There has been no attacks, nothing had happened. It was most likely a bitter student or something and now it's done"
The correct situation was, maybe, that Malfoy was so subdued he wasn't actively pursuing him or bothering him. And
“Excellent” He smirked, taking one of the vials and looking at it for a few seconds “I had hoped to have more fun with you two” He said, shrugging “But I guess I need to focus on what's important”
"Shut the fuck up!" He didn't mean to scream but it worked, surprisingly. Draco was giving him a murderous look, breathing quickly without moving. At least he wasn't trying to escape again. Harry slowly let go of his arm and tried to find the correct words "I don't think you did it, alright? What happened was horrible but... just blaming you is not going to change anything"
Harry knew allowing someone as disgusting as Bell to damage his relationship was not worth it. These kind of situations are what those people crave and Harry knew he was falling for it. But... He needed to know.
Harry pressed his lips together, was that what 'they' wanted? Was that another red herring? "Yeah, yeah I'm sure that's it"
Draco pressed his lips into a thin pale line, looking around, a couple thunders exploding in the distance. The air was damp, and the temperature had dropped, it would rain any moment now. Harry kept his focus on Draco.
Harry tried to find some steady ground, but his eyes decided that the steady ground had to be Malfoy. Because of course it had to be. Harry didn't notice how fisted his own hands were. He stared at Malfoy who was completely drenched and starting to shiver.
"You are my son, it is my business" Lucius crossed his arms as well, staring down at him with a frown on his face "What's going on?"
"I'm fine, thank you. You can go back inside" His voice was strained but he had to say it. He didn't need his father's pity, he didn't need anyone. He had to learn to fend for himself. Lucius and Narcissa weren't going to be there to support his decisions and he couldn't count on Harry, could he? One day that would end as well and he would be left alone and broken and he wouldn't know what to do anymore.
Draco was surprised. Perhaps he shouldn't have been, but he was. There was something in the way she said it, a longing he would never understand. He had never met any of his extended family, not in a way that could make him care
Draco pushed him backwards, lips still locked, trying to get to the bed that felt more inviting than ever.
"You are alright" Lucius said, sitting across from him. Draco knew how strange that was, how they had never done something like this. Why would a Malfoy sit over some grass and dirt? To get their expensive clothes
Draco closed his eyes, clearly tired and with no intention of getting up. He wanted to do the same, but a strong feeling of dread set on his stomach at the thought of his friends realizing he had not only slept outside of his room but missed breakfast, just like Draco. Harry was sure Ron wasn't going to realize anything, but now that Hermione knew they both spend nights together, she would put two and two together and... And what? They were doing nothing wrong. Talking was no crime. Right?
Draco moved his head and then his whole body to be facing him, their hands still together between them "So, are you?"
Harry placed a hand on his shoulder, trying to calm him down. He wanted to say something, but knew Elliot wouldn't want to hear anything from him.
Harry blinked and looked over at Ron who was frowning and clearly worried. Why did he have to be so worried about him?
"I know" Draco's fingers touched his cheek very softly, and he gave two soft kisses to his lips. "So the bedroom is upstairs, what else?"
"Something has happened" She exclaimed in a clear and loud tone, catching everyone's attention, even drawing some people from the bedrooms, still in their pajamas. "No one is allowed to leave the dormitories. And after tonight there will be a curfew. That includes both of you" She said, looking at both Harry and Draco, who were very still trying to understand what was going on and what had happened.
"Yeah, it's fine"  Noah pressed his lips together. He had been there and done nothing and that was... it was something he wasn't sure he could forgive himself. He always thought he would stop bullying or something like that.
Harry placed the letter on the table and placed a piece of paper next to it to start writing him back. For some odd reason his chest felt heavy and his heart kept pounding away at his ribs.
And in that moment Harry knew he had to be the bigger man and let go of his anger for a moment, to try and understand what had happened.
Narcissa would never forget her husband carrying their child around the room. It was like staring at her own heart. He seemed different somehow, soft, happy. So happy.
"I don't need you defending me. I can handle Elliot pretty well on my own" Draco said while searching under one of the desks, trying to find something, anything. They had decided Hermione and Noah would try and keep an eye on the aurors during the day, while Elliot tried to find out anything about the state of the other victim. Both Draco and Harry had been left with the task of searching every room and hallway near the place where Elliot was attacked, trying to find evidence.
Voldemort being dead didn't mean hate crimes would stop happening and maybe he could do something to help.
Draco closed his eyes, but pulled away. Not that he didn't like the comfort, but if he didn't try and keep some distance, it would be even more painful when he had to leave.
The other boy closed his book and placed it inside his bag incredibly slowly, giving him distrustful looks before getting up and tugging softly at the cloak's fabric.
"Don't make me say those" Draco held his gaze, but eventually gave up "I would be worried out of my mind about you. There. Happy?"
He could feel Draco's eyes on him, so he kept looking down to the wand while trying to aim it right. This spell was knew to him, Hermione had explained how to do it but still...
Harry hadn't seen him much that morning, only a couple glances on the hallways and nothing more. It wasn't enough, and Harry knew that wanting to be with him much more than with his friends was a problem, but he didn't have the time to care about his problems.
"Yeah... no" He sat next to her, going silent as a group of third years walked behind them "I spoke with McGonagall. It's... worse than what we thought"
Harry listened intently, focusing solely on his face, not letting go of his hand "I don't know how long this will last either... But I know how long I
Draco's cheeks were pink, but he didn't know if it was because of his comment, or from their kissing.
And without looking at them again, he turned and left the room. Once the door closed behind him, his knees almost gave. He had to lean back against the stone wall and close his eyes, every breath was pure fire inside his lungs, trying to eat him alive. Things weren't supposed to be like this. He was supposed to get the upper hand on his Father for once. Now it was all for naught. His parents had seen them, and they had a clear idea of what was going on. The moment he set foot inside his home again, it would be his downfall. Draco knew they would come up with some sort of plan, to make him right again. To
Harry didn't look up at the sky, he kept his eyes on his face, trying to find something he didn't like... he failed.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was doing. But there was no time and you are a terrible actor. It had to be convincing"
"It wasn't me" Malfoy was staring at Elliot almost as if he wanted to strangle him. Christ. It was going to be hard.
Ron looked at her, and they both got up, hurrying right behind them. Of course the moment the door opened, they knew things wouldn't be so easy.
Draco wasn't sure if that was true or if he had purposely ignored what was right for the longest of time.
"That's... that's just it" He whispered, a bit unsure. "It's something that was always on my mind, like something I
The papers did care, though. It didn't surprise them when they got the front cover of the Prophet. There was no picture to go with it, since Draco couldn't leave the house, so a lot of people dismissed the claims. Eventually -when Draco was allowed to go out- they did got a picture of them together, walking around hand in hand. It was a big deal for Draco, to do this, to be open in public with him, and it was as scary as he always imagined.
"Thank you" He sat on the kitchen table, extremely thankful for the cup of hot chocolate his mother gave him. It was strange having something other than tea, but it was comforting. Had she heard him scream during the night?
Draco laughed at that, leaning against the stone pillars, his eyes towards the sky. The snow had melted completely and spring was just a few days away. The air was warmer, the birds seemed to sing louder, the trees had started to shine green again. Harry loved this time of the year.
"Fuck, you are beautiful" Harry spoke without even thinking about it, because he told what he felt was true.
"I told Ron to go check on Ginny" Hermione said, keeping her voice calm. "Harry I know it might be hard, we are all struggling right now..."
Harry grumbled, maybe he would have. Maybe being punched would make him feel something, anything. And yet...the thought of punching Malfoy and leaving marks on his body did not sit well with him.
To tell the truth or to lie? Draco would 100% want him to lie for him, and say he wasn't going to help him and they were still enemies. But Harry was a terrible liar, and maybe if his friends helped they would put an end to whatever was happening with no one else getting hurt.
"No, Hermione. No. He..." Ron said, closing his eyes for a moment. "Has he really changed, Harry? Like...
"...No, sorry. I was thinking about something else" He looked at her and smiled the best smile he knew "Sorry"
There had been a time when he had bullied him and enjoyed watching him flustered... No, not flustered, hurt. Coming to terms with everything he had done -even as a stupid child- and how it had affected others was... Extremely hard. Sometimes Draco wished he was the stone cold, heartless man people thought he was. If he were that sort of man, then he wouldn't care. And if he didn't care, he wouldn't hurt. But, sadly for him: he did care.
