Of course, I will do the same even for Hermione, but she seems to be doing just fine, chatting with Daphne Greengrass. Daphne will be surprised when she finds out Hermione is muggleborn, but I know Greengrasses are pragmatic and value skill and wit over blood. Also, Daphne is no Ron Weasley and has a tact, so I’m not worried she wouldn’t treat her with respect.
"Oh, shut up, Potter." Draco snapped back and Harry was glad to see he seemed to feel a little bit better.
"It might take you a bit of practise, you stuttered there a bit," Harry teased. "But it must be late, let’s go back to sleep." Harry said, reached with his hand to turn off the nightlamp, Draco caught his wrist.
"Shut up, I wasn’t asking you. I’m talking to Harry." Ron growled.
"So you only want us to take of his turban? Easy, peasy."
He pretended to care about blood and about the future of the wizarding kind, but it was all a lie. He was crazy and he murdered anybody who dared to disagree with him or just simply happened to be in a wrong place at a wrong time.
"I don’t want to stop." Draco whispered, leaned in and licked his member’s underside in one excruciatingly slow motion, making Harry moan loudly.
"It's not like I have anywhere else to go, Potter. You don't have to worry." Draco said and curled up . Harry was pleased to see that the blond wasn't crying anymore. Most likely the appearance of Kreacher must have distracted him.
I turn around and see that indeed, the squid is right behind the window, peeking inside curiously with one of her big black eyes.
Draco wanted Harry desperately, fiercely. Between his legs, his cock and balls were growing hot. He wanted to reach down and adjust himself but then Harry would see and Draco didn't know how he would react. Did Harry realize the effect he had on him?
Harry was worried about persuading Luna to participate in the purification ritual but once again the strange Raveclaw girl surprised him. If anything she seemed happy and excited to be able to help, she even suggested as her father war currently in Italy, informing far branch of their family about the outcomes of the war, and her house was empty, they should do the ritual in their garden.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco…" he whines and clutches my shirt. I don’t remember him being like this in the original timeline. Harry Potter was always strong, or maybe he just had to be, he had nobody to lean on. I hug him tight. I’m supposed to train him to become stronger and I’m not so sure I’m doing very good job but I can’t help myself. He is just a kid.
"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —" And Harry tries but it doesn’t work either.
"Wow, that was quite advanced healing spell! It’s not even in Hogwarts curriculum, is it? I read it would be really expensive to have your eyes treated at St. Mungo’s. I have only tried simple spells from the first year’s textbooks myself, they all worked for me, but you are on a whole different level!" Hermione says, impressed.
"Thank you, Harry. Good night." Draco whispered and pushed even closer towards Harry.
"It’s okay. Thanks again for healing me."
"Snape doesn’t have any family and he was close with Draco, I saw his memories and I’m sure he wouldn’t mind Hermione."
"Harry, I…please…don’t" Draco started to say something, not knowing himself what, but panic was hearable in his voice.
"And isn’t it?" Hermione asks curious before she can stop herself and then is embarrassed by her own question.
"Fuck... what is the cure, Draco?"
Hermione leaves to do her homework and Harry starts stirring up until he wakes up with a jolt.
"I can’t be sure but if I were to guess, I would say about ten years."
"Thank you guys for standing up for me." Hermione says, still trying not to let her tears overflow.
"I told you to shut up, mudblood." Ron barked and Hermione started to cry.
"Harry, it’s your Birthday today and I haven’t given you anything yet. It would be an honour if you let me pay for your wand." I say to Harry and Ollivander understands.
And that is basically how we got to this moment, where I’m about to jump eight years into the past to make sure Voldemort doesn’t come back, Dumbledore doesn’t play us like chess pieces, Snape doesn’t die useless death and actually helps out when needed and if Harry needs to fight, he is ready to actually fight and have a chance of winning, not just throw expelliarmus left and right and hope for the best.
"Of course, I’m not happy. We have to get you to see a healer."
He hugs me tight and buries his face into my neck. His nest of hair tickles me a bit but I don’t mind.
"It’s okay Ginny, let me walk you back to the fireplace, you can floo home and have a rest. We will find somebody else, don't worry about it." Harry said and led the young with out of the room. He shot Hermione a look and made small hand gesture towards Draco. They were friends for ages and she knew it meant to look after Draco for a while. The Slytherin didn’t catch that and she was wondering if he would be annoyed or flattered, knowing what Harry had have her do.
"Okay, okay then, let me just get you in the bed." Harry said as he carried the blond boy to the bed. He covered him with the blanket and then let the wet towel he wrapped him in before disappear.
"But Harry, I’m everything he said about me." Draco said.
"It started when I was 12, before that mother always protected me, saying I was too small but since second year of Hogwarts, he wouldn’t listen to her anymore. I tried to do my best to please him but I just wasn’t good enough. Nothing I did was good enough." Draco mumbled.
Comments and kudos keep me writing, this chapter would have came out much later if I didn't get such a kind feedback.
"I’ll go with you. I am closer with her then you are." Harry said towards her. "Will you be okay here alone?" Harry asked Draco who was already on his feet, uncomfortable about showing his weakness in front of Hermione.
"Unfortunately, no, Miss Granger," the Head Warlock replied what Hermione expected.
"Because he was worried it wouldn’t work. He researched your condition and the notes healers left thoroughly and realized that while the damage of your muscles and nerves is bad, your magical core not recovering by itself is the bigger issue because if it wasn’t damaged, it would normally help you heal. He was looking into unforgivable curses and found out that when somebody is put under cruciatus or imperious repeatedly, the caster leaves a trace on the magical core of the person under the curse. " Hermione explained and Draco visibly paled.
"No, Professor McGonagall, I’ve already finished transfiguring my match so I was doing a bit of reading ahead." I say and show her the advanced transfiguration textbook I’ve been hiding under my desk.
"I don’t really know which purification ritual you are talking about but what about Luna?" Draco offered his idea.

in her voice.
“All you did was tell him it was a gas leak, I could have done that!” Harry said.
"That is good idea. Just maybe don't call him Weasel when you do that, Draco."
He smiles and when his feet touch the ground, he lets out big sigh of relief.
We have Herbology with Professor Sprout – which is quite relaxing, History of Magic taught by Professor Binns – as boring as I remembered it to be. Ten minutes into the lesson I open a book about alchemy and start to read. Hermione is absolutely dumbstruck by this and nudges me with elbow to pay attention until Harry falls asleep and she redirects her efforts to waking him up. It doesn’t work. We often talk until it is quite late and Harry needs the sleep. There are just so many things to tell Harry about, he knows literally nothing about the wizarding world. I knew that would be the case but still it’s baffling. If there are muggle studies for children from wizarding families, why isn’t there something like that for the ones brought up by muggles?
They sat down on the bed. Harry took Draco’s left hand and rolled up the sleeve to see the dark mark on his forearm. The skin there was red and angry, bleeding a little.
Food appears and Harry’s eyes grow wide with awe. He has probably never seen this much food at once and I’m angry at his stupid muggle relatives again. I lean to him.
Draco responded to the touch curling himself against Harry. Harry liked it, he did well. He let out deep, content sigh and rested his face against Harry’s chest. He felt warm, wanted and safe.
"I thought you loved me." She sobbed and Harry, despite being angry at her approached her and hugged her.
Draco was thinking about what Harry said, because of the sadness in Harry’s voice not questioning his memories at all.  It was a past, something far gone and yet when their eyes met, Draco knew that Harry wasn’t over it at all.
"I love you as a little sister, as a family. But I realized I don’t want a romantic relationship with you. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kissed you. I’m sorry Ginny." Harry explained softly.
"Draco, don’t even joke about something like this."
"Harry, you had my wand all this time!" Draco frowned and Harry had enough sense to look guilty.
"Then I better not let the prince wait too long." Harry said and went upstairs.
"Thank you Hermione." Harry said.
"We only kissed once in a heat of a moment during The Battle. But I’m not sure if I like her like that."
"Weasley twins. They are capable enough not to get hurt and will only approach Quirrell if there is an audience."
Hello dears,
Yet Harry was so good to him. Draco had to admit it felt amazing to be held in Harry’s arms when he cried. It felt safe, secure, like nothing and nobody can hurt him. Like Dark Lord cannot hurt him. Like his father and other death eaters cannot hurt him.
"What are you talking about?" Harry asked, confused. "Hey…. It’s okay. Look at me," he said, pushed the blond’s hands away and gently tipped his chin up so that they could see each other’s eyes. "Whatever it is, it’s okay, you can tell me, Draco."
"Harry, these are runes, alchemy, blood magic, elf magic… all mixed together. I have no idea how this spell works or whether it’s safe." Hermione whispered into Harry’s ear. She didn’t want to disturb Draco and cause him to make a mistake in what was clearly a spell way ahead of anything they learned in Hogwarts. "It’s not how we use magic in the modern times."
So Harry uncorked the small vial and put it to Draco’s lips. Draco drank it in a one swallow and it tasted foul, like most of the potions did.
"No, you couldn’t, he would have killed both you and your mother." Harry replied.
"Thank you, father, for doing all this. Mother too."
"It was an accident." Draco stated, he didn't want Harry to blame himself for something like that.
Hello dears,
"I do Narcissa. And I believe Draco will continue to be source of great pride for our family while attending Hogwarts too."
"I loved him. How could I be so stupid to love him?" Hermione asked when she calmed down a bit a pulled away.
"I deserved it." Draco admitted.
"What is going on here? Draco, Narcissa, why are you sitting on the floor?"
"Draco, you don’t see things clearly. He hurt your mind as much as he hurt your body, maybe even more. Your body needing sex or reacting to touch doesn’t make you a whore. Him, raping you, doesn’t make you dirty or ugly. There is nothing dirty or ugly about you little prince. Nothing." Harry placed a gentle kiss on his forehead. He was determined to kiss Draco as many times as it takes until the blond realizes just how he feels about him.
Harry looks so free and happy, air rushing through his hair and he is flying fast, faster than I thought was even possible on these old school brooms. I don’t give up easily but in the end, he wins our race.
"Please, kiss me again." Draco whispered.
"And why would it be bad to be sorted in Slytherin?" I ask and pierce the half giant with my eyes. He is already putting ideas in Harry’s head and while I’m together with them, I will not let such a thing happen. Besides, I need us to be together and Slytherin is the most likely choice.
"We really are friends, aren’t we?" Draco asked with a small smile.
"More wandless magic?" Draco asked with one arched eyebrow.
"You aren’t wrong. Merlin knows this past year I could have used a real friend." Draco mumbled.
"Oh, I don’t really know much about that," he admits.
"Then we must get ready for the shopping trip to Diagon Alley."
"Shut up! Who are you to say who is and isn’t supposed to be here! Fuck, Ron, you cannot just appear in my house and beat up whoever you find here! Draco is hurt and needs help!" Harry shouted back.
"I won’t." Draco said eagerly and Harry smiled.
"Alright then, if we are going to do this, I want you to lie down on your back, comfortably." Harry said and Draco moved into the position. "Now, relax, have you had your mind read before?"
"Yes, Draco?"
When we arrive to Diagon Alley, I ask my parents for money and go off on my own. They are both impressed when I tell them I will do my shopping alone and meet them later. I will not lie, I used to be rather dependent on them and it didn’t please father very much. So now I get another of his rare smiles, he gives me money, way more then I need, and sends me on my merry way.
"You tell me, Draco…" Harry sighed. "I found you, sleeping, no … passed out in the bath." Harry explained as he rubbed the blond’s body with the towel.
"Why Draco?" Harry asked, searching for an answer in the blond’s silver eyes.
Slytherin prefect, she introduces herself as Gemma Farley, calls and leads us to the dungeons. We reach the entrance covered by intricate stonework.
"Show me your needle," she says and I do. She turns it around in her fingers a few times, looking at it from different angles.
"Draco… " Harry sighed and caressed the blond’s hair. It was so beautiful, looking almost white in the morning sun. Harry was getting more daring with his touches everyday and Draco seemed to welcome it. "Nobody deserves the way Ron treated you. He was wrong to shout at you, wrong to hurt you." Harry said and continued stroking his hair.
"It will be okay, my little prince, the fire cannot hurt you." Harry tried to assure him.
"No, no, Draco." Harry reached for the blond and pulled him onto his lap and against his chest.
"There is no need. Besides I deserved it." Draco said and turned to lie on his side, so he wouldn’t face Harry anymore.
Harry slowly started pushing the blanket down to Draco’s waist to have access to the bruises but Draco stopped him, catching his wrist. There was fear in the blond’s eyes and his breathing got uneven.
“Yes, that’s true,” agreed Nick.
Who shared the same dream and desire
Most of the other students were all in their dorms packing, as the professors would be putting the students onto the carriages to take them down to Hogsmeade in a few hours.  Draco was alone in the bell tower.  Hardly anyone ever came into the tower and Draco often went there when he wanted time to himself to think.  Lost in thought, Draco didn’t hear anyone enter the room.
“You’re not seriously going to give one of them to Malfoy are you, Harry?”
“Looking to get me into trouble, Malfoy?”
“No, it isn’t.  The restoration spell is so powerful that it will start to restore all of the books in the library at the same time.  If you tried to direct the spell at a single book, it would likely destroy it because the book would be incapable of handling such a powerful saturation of magic.”
“I’m afraid I have to shoulder the blame for that,” Salazar answered.  “I summoned him to Earth in 862, so that he could divine when my heir would find my Chamber of Secrets, and to assist me to breed the basilisk and keep it alive until that time.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but Voldemort cast some extra spells which would summon him back when my heir, Tom Riddle, found my Chamber.”

“I bought my wand from Mr. Ollivander,” Ryan said.  “I’ve never had any problems with it.”
“Why do I get the feeling that everyone here, except for Zach and me, already knows what’s going on?”
Arriving in the gardens behind the temple, Draco immediately saw the large flowering tree that was obviously the garden’s centerpiece.  Several women dressed similarly to Anarra who Draco assumed to be more priestesses of Persephone were gathered around the tree.
“Do I really need an invitation?” Harry asked in a low, seductive voice, as he stood from Bill’s bed, walked over, and began to caress the older red-head’s cheek.
And the Four Founders are long gone.
“You should have forced her to.”
“I don’t have it with me,” Nick answered.  “It’s in a book of Salazar’s most secret recipes, all of which he created himself.  He’s asked that none of his recipes be removed from his lab, so I’ll have to take you there.”
“Well, Hermione, Ron, come into Godric’s quarters and see for yourselves,” Aarik said.  “I’m tempted to ban you from Godric’s quarters permanently, after what I just heard you say, Ron, but I won’t.  I want you to see what Draco has given me with your own eyes, because I want to see you eat crow for thinking he’s just like his father, which couldn’t be further from the truth.”
"What kind of special circumstances?"  Ollivander asked, as he arched an eyebrow, his curiosity obviously piqued.
“It leaves an extremely bitter taste in my mouth to say this,” Lucius said, “but I hope that old fool Dumbledore and his Order find a way to reverse the path that the world is now on.  Because the alternative is…”  Here Lucius stopped speaking, unable to think of a word to adequately describe the alternative, as Bellatrix nodded her head in complete agreement.
Ginny was speechless as she followed Harry into the room.  Harry closed the door after her, then walked further into the room, and took a seat on the large red velvet armchair in front of the fireplace.
“Father, please,” Prince Erevan began.
*	*	*
“Mr. Ollivander did not make my wand?”
I’ve never given much thought really to the idea of being a father.  I always assumed that one day I would be one and I swore a long time ago that I’d strive to treat my children better than my sire treated me growing up.  Of course, as Rule #221 in the Malfoy Family Code of Conduct states, Malfoys must not have an excess of children.  Rule #222 goes on to explain that an excess is more than two.  Total rubbish if you ask me.  I wouldn’t mind having three or four myself, but if it meant spending my life with Harry, I’d gladly help sire two or three dozen.  Of course, I might change my mind about that once I actually feel the pain of childbirth, seeing as how part of the spell that allows two wizards to have children together transfers the labor pain from the surrogate to one of the fathers, leaving the surrogate with only some minor discomfort.
Aarik was at a loss for words and simply nodded his head, as Lily let out a cry of what could only be described as joy, as she threw her arms around both Aarik and Draco and hugged them tightly.  James came up behind his wife, looked at Draco for a long moment, and then asked, “I take it you are Lucius’ son?”
Draco frowned.
