Maybe that’s why he’s broken and destroyed? Maybe that’s what’s wrong with him? Perhaps losing your Other does this to everyone. Everyone who has one.
Draco almost feels like he’s the one who’s suffering the least, like the true victims of this crime are his friends and family who have to watch him waste away. He doesn’t think they would agree if he said as much to them, but he can’t help but feel like he wants better for them.
He's quite sure that they wouldn't stay for him. Potter has always been the one people prefer, the one who is so charismatic that he just draws people to him. At least, he's always drawn Draco to him.
Draco nods. "So it was his Ancient Name that the God of the Stars sacrificed to protect his parents?"
“Well… As long as I’d get a veto on something that I find terrible, I wouldn’t mind. I mean, you’d get a veto the same way back at me, I guess…” He scratches the stubble on his chin. “I feel like raising children should be a joint venture and something where we need to work together as a team. Besides, aren’t relationships about compromising?”
But now he can’t sleep, his body aches, and he cannot fathom a life that continues like this in perpetuity. It’s intolerable.
The fact that Potter's no longer a short and scrawny child had been obvious for a while, since he finally had a growth spurt sometime in their third or fourth year, but "not scrawny" does not equal fit. It’s bloody annoying and unfair is what it is, especially since Draco has had to come to terms with having his mother's slender build rather than his father's more powerful one.
"I do! I know a lot more. For example, though they became lovers, the God of the Sun and the God of the Stars were originally rivals." Adriana puts some glasses away as Draco takes a seat at the bar.
Harry doesn't think he cares about Malfoy's parents. He's hated Lucius Malfoy for years after all, but... They saved Harry and his friends now, didn't they? Of course, Sirius might contact Harry through the mirror tomorrow and tell him that it was all a ruse, but that seems unlikely.
Potter had been so amazing. So full of life and looking forward to the future. And then he had just disappeared, and left Draco alone in the gaping maws of the past.
With their plan of attack finished, their next step is to sneak back onto the walkways so Draco can get a better look at the Rune and glyph placements. After all, it's not like Draco is going to be able to reverse the whole thing on the fly. they're going to need to plan it just a bit, take some time to do it before they set the whole thing in motion.
The words slip away from him. His parents are Malfoys, he knows that. They live in Malfoy Manor, he knows that, too.
"My first instinct would be to say that we should just destroy the entire crystal. Just blow it up and destroy their Inferi creator entirely."
Ron and Hermione are gone... But he can't dwell on that. If he does, he's just going to lose his mind. They were the only friends he had for so long, and he hates that they decided that it wasn't worth it to stay by Harry's side anymore. He knows that in part it was because of the locket—the horcrux slowly driving them to paranoia and lashing out at each other—but at the same time... There's a part of Harry that fears that was their real feelings. He knows they were just tired of having to live through this horrible situation, just because they're his friends. Just because they want to be loyal to Harry.
“Now come on, you dunce. Don't just stand there with your mouth gaping open. Let's get this show on the road so we can get this stupid locket destroyed as quickly as possible.”
Adriana nods. "Absolutely. They all have a Spoken Name, which is what they're called when we don't use their title, and they all have an Ancient Name, which is what gives them their power."
taught you to cast the Patornus charm?” Potter’s voice is, if possible, filled with even more disbelief now.
The lush gardens surrounding it and the large pool truly is a sight to behold. This is where Draco first learned how to swim, as the Manor held no such opportunities. Wiltshire is landlocked, and there are no
They don't know quite yet what they're heading into, and they don't know quite yet how they will be able to stop Voldemort. But they're going to do it, one way or another.
Draco flushes. “Right. My apologies.” He turns back to Loulou, but before he can say anything, she speaks up on her own.
Silence spreads over the table, no one says anything for quite a while. Harry knows it's because they're all waiting for Draco to finally give in. No one wants Draco in a strop; he can be quite unbearable when he is.
“My, what a lovely bow you’re wearing. What is…” Draco trails off as he catches sight of the ring box hanging from Cassiopeia’s ribbon. Harry watches as Draco’s eyes grow huge and he moves forward slowly, his hands shaking as he gently undoes the ribbon.
His parents are making noises now, he knows they're coming closer. But he keeps his attention on the small furry creature. Its fur is so pale and thick and soft. He tries to keep himself together, keep this odd sharpness for as long as he can.
Lucius doesn't so much as blink, but the sheer glee the Dark Lord describes Potter's dreams with, as if he's
Draco’s aware that these people have no idea how much he’s been helping them over the past months, but he still finds it quite annoying how they don’t trust a word out of his mouth. Though perhaps that is his own fault all things considered.
Because Harry hasn’t talked much about her really, though Draco’s been under the impression that they’re at least civil to each other.
“What the hell are you playing at, Malfoy?” Harry’s heart is beating so hard in his chest it seems to hurt.
Harry hears Draco let out a shuddering breath, and it just reminds Harry how much he hates having to bring Draco to these places. While Draco would be incredibly upset about being described as ‘delicate’, Harry knows that Draco isn't cut out for violence. He never has been.
Draco stiffens in his mother’s arms, only barely daring to peak up over her shoulder at the redhead who’s pulling—ah yes, he remembers the Patil twins properly now—a lovely, dark woman behind her.
After a brief while he nods. "That does... Echo well. I like it." He closes his eyes and hums to himself—clearly he's more than a little odd. Adriana briefly wonders if he's escaped his carers, if he's one of those who's been touched by something otherworldy—she's never met one before, but she's heard stories about them.
As soon as they finally make it behind machinery, so they're no longer in the Herders’ line-of-sight, Harry turns on the spot and crushes Draco's body against his own. If something happens to either of them now... He wants to have held Draco one last time. He couldn't bear it if—!
they’re all still children. Draco’s doing his bit, but only within the realms of his capabilities. He’s not trying to go toe-to-toe with the bloody Dark Lord. Potter truly is an
Straining to see over his mother's shoulder because her head is blocking his view, Draco sees… Bloody hell, why is Loony Lovegood here? Did
And with its discovery, she transcended mortal flesh and took her place in the pantheon of the gods. She is remembered and praised for her perseverance, for proving that humans too can become gods, and that there is no single predetermined fate for anyone. Within the dark curls that adorn her head she now carries the knowledge of the universe.
They know the Inferi can sense when too much magic is used, so they have to be very conservative about its usage lest they alert them to their presence. But Harry knows Draco didn't use a lot of magic as they searched the building, they were together the entire time after all, so he has no idea why Draco is blaming himself.
“No,” Harry says immediately. “Both that and the Sorting Hat have stayed safe in Dumbeldore’s office.”
He pretends to sleep in Harry’s arms, while really listening to his would-be husband cry himself to sleep. They’re trying to shield him from it, he realises, but he wishes they would just be honest.
His only other option would have been to go back to Hogwarts, and Draco doesn’t think he can ever walk back inside that castle. Not after… Not after everything.
Draco’s  wheezing, and when Harry looks closer, his lips look swollen and he’s scratching at his throat.
Certainly, he's handsome, but that's hardly a reason at all. She's seen beautiful people before without entirely losing her marbles...
He doesn't really like the idea of coming inside like a thief in the night, but they have no choice. If Voldemort and his Death Eaters have managed to get into Malfoy Manor, then Harry and Draco must be extremely careful. They cannot risk getting caught. If they are… It'll be the end of everything.
He brings out his wand and summons a ribbon in red silk. He gently transfigures the ring box so he can hang it on the ribbon, and then he ties it around Cassiopeia’s neck, using his wand to tie it into a magnificent bow.
And that's when Harry remembers that he didn't kill the Herder he Stunned before Draco even started changing the magic circle. That means that if the others get out, and Harry doesn't manage to take care of them... He and Draco may end up having to fight all of them despite their plan.
. Like pain directly put into his nerve endings, unending and damaging. He’ll go mad from the memory alone.
The thought is sharp and unbidden, and the desire fades almost as quickly as it came. He continues to move through his life with the small furry creature, continues to do as his parents, as the funny creatures with the big eyes and long ears, want. He doesn't know what
He falls asleep then, depressed and exhausted. He won't last much longer, he knows. He's grateful that at least it hasn't been a painful end. This curse could have been so much worse; he could have suffered the whole way through, with agony and tears.
rather skilled and powerful, so he might have tried anyway. Maybe even succeeded if he knew where to attack. I doubt it though; Father says he doesn’t appear to be a
and then he'll... He'll leave the country! He'll head off to France, to the Riviera, to lie on the beach and not think about
"There aren't really people who can Apparate to coordinates only, and I don't think... Setting up the Apparition point to be useful for people other than us... I think that would take too long, I don't even know if it's possible. Not to mention we risk that they find us before we can finish and then we'd lose our chance."
The footsteps come closer, and the herders are arguing loudly amongst themselves. Harry and Draco draw part, this is not the time. They have to be prepared, though this is likely to get very ugly very fast.
“Part of the—! We didn't have a plan! We've just been trying to come up with some way to destroy the Horcrux and some way to find the other ones.” Harry pinches the bridge of his nose and tries not to blow up on Draco completely. He doesn't want to alienate one more of his friends... even if Draco is a very weird acquaintance-that's-barely-a-friend at best.
“What? Why are you cancelling? What's come up? Is something wrong? Is there something you need to tell me?” Draco had really and truly tried to get more information, anything that could quell the churning of his stomach. Something that could keep the fear and nausea at bay. Because it cannot be true. His most horrible thoughts and fears after overhearing that conversation in the Leaky Cauldron cannot
Have they been sheltering the amnesiac God of the Stars in their tiny village for months without knowing it? Has Adriana's mother made the God of the Stars
“You never think.” Draco sneers. “Didn't even consider asking me, did you? Didn't even consider talking about it. You just made up your mind and went with it, as always.”
It’s extra lucky that the lands around Malfoy Manor are sprawling enough that they can enjoy a lovely picnic among its lushness without risking running into Draco’s parents.
He’s not exactly surprised that a lot of the herders are former Death Eaters, or rather still Death Eaters—just without Voldemort to look forward to. Still, it would have been better for them if they were just regular people had gone a bit weird in the head. At least they would have been less likely to be vicious then. Willing Death Eaters truly are the scum of the earth.
Harry and Draco end up standing huddled together outside of the restaurant along with all the other guests, watching in disbelief as the staff—and soon Ministry wizards as well—cast spell after spell to try and put out the fire.
He carefully floats some of the powder up into the air, carefully encapsulated in a bubble so that it won't start to have an effect too early. He also cast a disillusion spell on it, just so they won't realise where the powder comes from. He doesn't want to reveal their position. If they can make sure that the Herders don't know where they are…
do such a thing… They love him, he knows that. It’s the knowledge of their love that kept him sane through the war, wasn’t it? It was all because he loves them, because they love
Well, besides the fact that Malfoy is kind of fit and Harry has suddenly and surprisingly found himself wanting to touch him.
If it's currently powering them, currently powering the curse that makes them spread the state of being an Inferi like a disease, then changing what the crystal does definitely should cure those infected who haven't been killed since their infection—or so Harry fervently hopes—but also depower the ones that are relying on its power to function.
“I thought… Your moods were getting worse.” There’s a scratching sound, as if Potter is dragging his nails against those terrible Muggle trousers he always insisted on wearing. “You seemed less and less happy, more and more lethargic… And it was always worse after you’d seen my friends, or I’d seen yours. And we fought and got into silly and petty arguments so often.”
"It's so romantic... Oh, I wish I could be present when the God of the Sun finally finds his love again. Surely that would be the most magnificent of scenes..." She rests her head on her palms, elbows on the table, and sighs dreamily. The God of the Sun will never love her, or even look at her, she knows that. But the thought of their romance—born out of rivalry—still makes her happy.
Draco frowns. "That seems peculiar... Wouldn't it wound the God of the Sun's pride more than anything?"
“Of course…” Draco can’t help the stab of disappointment. He feels it every time Harry needs to leave. He needs to be brave, he thinks, and be the one to start the discussion of whether or not they should come clean to their friends and family.
Draco immediately pulls out his wand and starts to cast charm after charm, and soon he has some sort of box tied to a fake leather strap which he then puts around his own hips like a belt.
Ron and Harry go Aurors on the whole thing—Harry may not be allowed to work the investigation due to a too close personal connection to it, but he still oversees things and function as someone to help Ron think—and immediately go back to the scene of the attack to see if there was anything they missed the first time.
“—And you got him here quickly enough that there’s nothing to worry about. He’s still a bit groggy, I’m afraid, as the spells and potions we give for allergic reactions can take a bit out of you. Not to mention the reaction itself.” She smiles again. “Not to worry though, he’ll be just fine as long as he avoids grapefruit in the future.”
He’s kind of given up on the idea of a perfect proposal, but he still wants it to be good. He wants it to be something Draco can look back on years later with a smile on his face. There won’t be any pictures, because as much as Draco thrives on drama and spectacle, Harry wants something more private for the proposal.
about that fact. He doesn’t quite manage, not always, but sometimes he does. Sometimes he wishes he wasn’t wrong and destroyed. Perhaps his parents would be less sad, less upset, if Draco wasn’t like
Harry crosses his arms over his chest, trying to think of what they should do next. Draco put the destroyed locket back inside the satchel he transfigured and then put
Hermione's face is red, and the blush is even more obvious on Parkinson's pale face. Whatever they saw in there, it clearly flustered and embarrassed them.
He looks down at Cassiopeia. He thinks… He thinks she was the first thing that helped. But he’s not sure why…
He feels oddly numb, as if his brain still hasn’t caught up with any of it. Harry’s hand is clutching his own in a grip Draco would normally complain about, but right now it feels grounding, a tangible connection to the world outside his own shock-numb mind.
“Draco, please…” Pansy’s voice is teary… But Draco can’t listen to that right now. Can’t care about the fact that she’s sad and hurt.
Sometimes he wonders if it's him. If he's seeing a small furry representation of himself, brought to life by his mother's magic. Can she do that?
"I'd like to die outside, Harry," he murmurs one day, lying on a reclining chair outside as he is. "I want to die surrounded by the people I love during a lovely, sunny day with birdsong and flowers."
"Why wouldn't I dare, High Inquisitor Umbridge? What are you going do? Use illegal items on me to cause pain and try to torture me into silence?"
Sitting in the tavern's food court, staring down at a bowl of soup, is the most beautiful—and the most pale—man she's ever seen. His features are exquisite, almost as if they were made to be as pleasing to the eye as possible. His pallor is so striking he almost seems unreal, as if he were an illusion rather than a real man.
And then Malfoy turns his head and looks over his shoulder at Harry. His mouth twists into that smug and unfairly attractive smile of his.
Instead of answering, however, Neville simply turns the paper around so they can read the headline for themselves.
Harry has no idea what the hell they were doing in the kitchen to end up with some sort of magic resistant fire, but it just ruined his proposal, so he’s absolutely less than pleased about it.
Harry should have stayed hidden, he should have stayed a bit further away still looking around the room instead of stepping into the middle to stand next to Draco. At least Draco’s beneath the invisibility cloak.
A loud yowling noise causes him to look down. Sitting in front of his legs, staring up at him with wide, pale green eyes, is Cassiopeia. She gets up on her back feet and leans her front paws against his knees, yowling again.
“I have an enchanted mirror, alright!” Malfoy yells, twisting in Harry’s grasp. “As if my parents would send me off here when You-Know-Who is loose without the ability to contact them instantly!”
He starts to shovel his food into his mouth, somehow just barely managing to appreciate the delicious taste of it all, even as he watches Draco intently. At least Draco hasn’t finished his meal either, distracted as he is by story-telling.
“Yeah, I just… tripped.” He shrugs and scratches his head, only barely refraining from screaming in frustration.
He can think about what the hell this all means for his own relationship later when he's alone at home. He's probably just being overdramatic and there's some sort of innocent explanation to it all. He's just making a big deal out of nothing.
Sometimes he just wants to go to sleep and not wake back up... But he thinks that would make his parents sad, and he doesn't want that.
Besides, he had it on good authority that she will be leaving the castle in disgrace very soon indeed.
A better person would probably have been happy for Potter and the fact that he's doing well. Draco, however, is a bitter mess and he doesn't have it in him to be happy for someone who broke his heart. He just wants to disappear sometimes, especially when he can't get anything done as far as writing goes.
Behind the darkness of his eyelids, everything seems as it always has. He feels the softness of the sheets, the warmth of Draco's slender body in his arms, and he takes in the gentle sound of his husband's breathing. Nothing here has changed, but as soon as he opens his eyes he sees the stone walls of the cave and the way the only light comes from magical fires... And he remembers everything that has changed and everything they've lost.
hurt like a slicing hex to the spine. He’s not used to be so easily used and discarded… Only one person has ever treated him or his parents like that before, and considering that was the literal self-professed Dark Lord…
As they come closer to St. Mungo’s, it becomes obvious that Andromeda was telling the truth. The NMO
. But no matter how far he walks, no matter if he runs, no matter how he shouts... It's all just empty hallways with silent and unmoving portraits.
His parents never let him go outside when it does. They stop him by the door and pull him into the large room with the sofas and the fireplace instead.
“No.” He can’t. He’ll break down again if he does, he knows he will. He needs to seem strong now, even though Potter has somehow convinced Draco’s parents to not only tell him where Draco is, but also let him gain access to their private property. Something that should absolutely have been impossible.
Harry Potter, simply because it’s what they want to hear and what they will pay for. And likely Lockhart before Potter.
Draco gives him a deeply unimpressed look. “Alright, so we're calling him Thomas now? Fine.” Draco rolls his eyes.
“Ginny called me a dunce about it. And she’s right, because I could just have told you what was going on while keeping the fact that I was looking for something
“That was just the Manor wards, Harry. They were sensing whether or not you are an intruder, or if you're allowed to be here.”
“Point me Harry Potter,” he whispers, and watches as his wand spins in his hand. Noting the direction, he sets off again.
He wants to leave something behind for these people, for all of them who love him so much and suffer so much in the face of his pain and untimely demise.
He freezes with his hand just barely avoiding clutching Cassiopeia’s fur harshly. He tilts his head down and keeps his eyes stubbornly closed, biting his lip.
Ron and Hermione are gone, leaving only Harry and Draco behind. Harry feels destroyed, betrayed. He glances up to take in Draco's facial expression, and winces when he realises that Draco? Draco is livid.
Draco doesn’t recognise the voice, and he doesn’t remove his face from his pillow, even as it grows wet and disgusting with his tears and snot—he’s never been the most graceful of criers, quite the opposite.
“So what happened on the mission? You lost two people and Allison was in a terrible state when she arrived. Not to mention that I can see that you're not exactly unharmed yourself, Harry.” Lavender’s eyes are narrowed.
the problem here rather than your lies. Or lack of communication, in your bloody version of events.”
He shakes his head to stop focusing on the negative. They have a chance to find something that should be able to destroy the locket and that is something to celebrate. He also feels better, now that he doesn't have the locket hanging around his neck every now and again. He's still worried that they will lose it, but Draco hasn't allowed him to have it back since he put it in the bag so... Harry's just going to have to trust that Draco is taking care of it.
Draco screams in fear, shakes and trembles. He can’t breathe, the man will kill him, will kill his parents… He has to… He has to…
"Well... The Heavenly Throne was empty, and they were the two candidates suitable to ascend it. Some of their rivalry stemmed from the fact that only one of them could become King, but both of them wanted it."
Draco actually kind of likes the idea, so he just continues to experiment as he has. He may never get to take his N.E.W.T.s at Hogwarts, but if he at least gets grades in equivalent tests that are recognised by the British Ministry, then he can apply for positions and things that would otherwise be out of his reach.
There's no reason for Potter to be here now. It's been months since they broke up, Draco doesn't have any of his things, and they haven't exactly been speaking. There's no reason for Potter to be here ever.
He doesn't even want to consider what the NMO would have done to him otherwise. Possibly used him in a trap, tortured him for information, or even killed him as an example. All because he's married to Harry.
He'd really like it if Potter would stop, since that would make it much easier for Draco to ignore him. He doesn't want to think about Potter and his surprisingly muscled body at
, to care even slightly about his life, his situation... It is his magic he misses. The feeling of it rushing through his body, the ever present warmth.
“No! I didn't think you had depression at the time! I just thought I was making you miserable! You never wanted to talk about your feelings when I asked, and towards the end I felt like I only ever upset you. I didn’t think… Not back
Draco shakes his head wildly, and draws another loud and wheezing breath, an almost desperate sound.
Draco doesn't say anything, because he can only imagine he wouldn't be too happy himself if it had been his mother or his father in this particular situation. Feh, he doesn't really enjoy empathising with
Harry from going to the Ministry. The only thing Voldemort could have gained from that would've been a test to see if he truly
He doesn't think that anyone would have expected for him and Potter to end up falling into a relationship. Many days it doesn't seem like it was ever really true. Most of the time it seems far more like a fever dream that he’s just woken up from.
It’s all been too reminiscent of his childhood, of having all the people around him believe his Aunt and Uncle’s lies about what a terrible troublemaker he is, even though he never actually causes any trouble. It’s been like a festering wound ripped open, and it’s made him angry and snappy.
Draco is walking as fast as he possibly can without running, and Adriana actually has to run to be able to keep up with him. Her legs aren't nearly as long as his are after all.
Draco snorts loudly. “The Sword of Gryffindor is just, you know, one of the greatest examples of goblin smithing, Potter. From what I've been told, it will retain the essence of anything that will strengthen it, and since
“Then it sounds like what we should be looking into is the concept of Others,” Granger says. “Is there anything about that in your library, Mr and Mrs Malfoy?”
“So, what do we do now?” Draco says and looks at Harry. They're eating a quick meal from one of the Manor's pantries, and Draco has stuffed some more food that will keep in Hermione's bag. At least Hermione didn't take that with her.
"I had a vision, I thought... I thought you were in the Department of Mysteries. I thought Voldemort had you and..." He rushes through the words, and only trails off when he seems to choke on them.
Draco sighs. “My Other died, or underwent Core Severing, which is what caused my… State, shall we say. I have recovered, but I’d rather not be constantly reminded of the fact of it. And since everything is black-and-white for me now… Well.” He gives an elegant shrug.
All the blood drains from Draco's face and his eyes grow huge as he stares at Harry, with Harry can only assume is horror at Harry’s betrayal.
Mother and Father have taken to joining him in the library, though usually they simply sit on the sofas drinking tea and chat in low murmurs as he works. He wonders if they’re just starved from seeing him… be him… that they can’t stand the thought of being separated from him for too long.
The story she loves the most, the one that she finds both fear, horror, and comfort in... is the story of how they lost the stars.
"Mate, maybe uh…" Ron trails off when Harry turns to look at him, but then he takes a deep breath and continues. "Maybe you should stop staring, yeah? You look a bit deranged."
to do? A bit less so. Not because Draco thinks his father doesn’t love him, but simply because the Dark Lord was still
A shockwave of green light slams out from the shroud of darkness created by the Peruvian Instant Darkness powder.
—and the new people were far less petty point scorers with decades of old grudges. That must have helped Draco’s parents too.
Harry takes fierce enjoyment in feeling Draco's fingers dig into his shoulder blades as they cling to each other—desperate to prove to themselves that they're both safe, both unharmed.
“There you go, girl. Take that box to Draco for me, will you?” Harry gives her a kiss on the head and puts her down on the floor, watching as she starts to elegantly make her way towards Draco, her tail high in the air like a plume.
Harry stares at him, probably for longer than he should, before he slowly reaches out and puts the locket in Draco's open palm.
“I love you,” Draco murmurs, looking up at the man he thought he’d die before he could marry… The man he now
Father might have always enjoyed being a man of leisure, but Draco is quite certain that his ever-moving brain would start to dribble out of his ears from lack of stimulation if he tried to do that.
a fridge—it’s a cupboard with inlaid magic spells to keep food at the optimal temperature to stay fresh—but Harry grew up Muggle, so he always thinks of it as a fridge anyway. Same with the freezer equivalent.
There's no guarantee after all. Voldemort will hardly spare any of them. Besides that, Harry can't run anywhere and he knows that Ron and Hermione will stay with him until the bitter end, no matter what comes their way.
"Draco, we've been your friends for years. We can tell when something's wrong." He shakes his head. "We've tried to humour you, we've tried to accept that you don't want to talk about whatever it is, but..."
“By the way, do we still have one of those charms that repel post owls? To ensure they can’t sense you to deliver the letters?”
“Why are you even doing this?” Draco just cannot understand why. What does Potter hope to gain from this, beyond the return of colour vision in both of his eyes? It’s not like he wants anything to do with Draco at the best of times…
, Draco. It's just... We still don't know how to get rid of the Horcrux. How are we supposed to do this?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Because, for me, ‘in it for the long haul’, as you put it, means at the very least an
to tell them anything at all, of course. But perhaps, just perhaps, he’s hoping for a bit of sympathy. Maybe this can be a way for the Golden Trio to stop hating him.
“No, nothing’s wrong. It was just unexpected. Don’t worry about it. I’ll send an owl and maybe I can Floo over on Monday?”
With a grumble he turns to his side and pulls his covers up so high they almost cover his face entirely.
Harry pulls him into his arms without a second thought. Judging by Draco's reaction, he has recognised whatever it is that's going on down there.
“All right, let's do it then. Let's get back to the Forest of Dean and see if we can find Ron and Hermione.”
They've also made sure that none of their friends are nearby, but also that they know where the bombs are located just in case. Just so they won't accidentally get caught in the crossfire.
Harry touches him. Watches the contrast of his own tan hand against the pale skin of Malfoy's chest. Watches as a shudder runs through Malfoy's slim frame and his mouth drops open.
Draco hasn’t slept. He lay awake all night, staring at the ceiling, counting the snoring breaths of Cassiopeia sleeping on the pillow next to his head. She didn’t move all night.
Draco had been too clingy, too dependent, too lost in the past to be a partner of worth to Potter. He hadn't even managed to get along well with Potter's friends, and one would think that would have been the bare minimum.
well aware that he’s dating a Gryffindor and they’re basically all about the heat of the moment… But he’s sure they’ll learn how to work things out between them together. They haven't really had any fights yet, thankfully, just some minor squabbles and times when they're absolute shits to each other. Though there was that time when Harry thought Draco had told his friends... Well, it hadn't been a fight really. Draco had quickly calmed him down after all and they resolved that misunderstanding.
"Yeah? What'd you dream about?" His voice is slightly muffled by his shirt as he tries to pull it over his head, but gets stuck—just like every morning.
He turns over on his side, ignores his straining erection and tries desperately to think about something else. Tries desperately to fall back asleep.
Seamus shakes his head. "Yeah, but… I know you. And I saw what happened to Diggory… Mum's just been so afraid, I didn't want to believe it for her. But there's still no excuse, and Dean's been telling me all year to get over myself."
But… But why… Well… Wouldn’t Harry have mentioned it? Why would he be keeping it and the whole thing with Grimmauld Place secret? And… Why would he be so picky if it was just a temporary space? Because Ginny Weasley
His parents seem... happier. He's not sure, he can't... They seem less old. He thinks they smile sometimes.
and outright killing one of his more useful servants was the kind of mark against him Draco would assume his father would have avoided.
His heart pounds in his chest and he feels his mouth go dry again as the Herder comes ever closer to Draco.
He blinks rapidly, Cassiopeia's rumbling noise in his ears, and stares at the piece of food in front of him. It tastes
in the case of Draco and his family, for whom it ended as well as it possibly could have. He's certain that things would have gone far worse for him and his father if Potter hadn't chosen to testify for Draco and his mother. He's quite certain he would be spending time in Azkaban now if not for Potter’s testimony.
As long as Kreacher doesn’t find out—he’ll be in a bad mood forever if he finds out he wasn’t consulted for the food meant for a proposal to someone of Black blood—that’s just fine with Harry.
Sometimes Harry wonders if maybe Draco stays with him just to keep being friends with Ginny… but not really.
“I don’t care what you think about my parents, Potter, but they’re both very accomplished, and they’re
hit Harry at the time, though he had noticed what Malfoy smells like, but now he can’t stop thinking about it. About the feeling of Malfoy’s chest pressed against his own, about the feeling of holding his wrists in his hands…
Perhaps it's selfish of Draco, but he wants Harry to promise he will. He wants to die knowing that Harry will do his best to find happiness after he's gone.
“Goblins choose one single Life Passion, which they dedicate their lives to. That's why they're so good at whatever their passion is, and why the bankers at Gringotts—who you must understand are goblins who chose banking, I suppose, or finance as their Life Passion—are way better at running a bank then us a Wizards could ever hope to be.
"So since our lease was nearing renewal, we started looking into something bigger where we could all fit, especially since Ginny also wanted to bring Luna. Her father's in St Mungo's and she wants to live closer to the hospital and also not be alone so…" He shrugs. "That's about when I decided that maybe I should just renovate the very large wizarding house I own…"
? He's actually quite sure Lucius might have said no if Narcissa hadn't been so immediately thrilled).
They reach the town square where the stranger—the God of the Sun—and Adriana's mother still wait for them.
He feels too tired to get out of bed, his limbs sluggish and aching... So heavy he can barely bear to lift them at all. He barely even rolls over in bed, and rather than going to the bathroom, he just casts a few spells usually used for coma patients to deal with it.
"Seeing Malfoy sneer would scare anyone out of their dream with that pointy face of his." Ron's grin is wicked, and Harry quickly joins him in laughing.
Harry stares at him, not sure what to think about this. Why on Earth is Draco acting as if this is news?
Harry sits slumped in one of the uncomfortable chairs in the St Mungo’s waiting room. The healers had whisked Draco away immediately, casting spell after spell, and Harry hasn’t seen or heard anything since.
“When Allison came back, gravely injured... I was so worried, Harry. I hate that you have to leave, but even more than that, I hate that I'm not there to watch your back.” Draco's voice trembles, just slightly, and Harry knows how deeply affected his husband is by all of it. It's not safe for Draco to leave, even less so than it is for most people—both due to his status as a healer and as Harry Potter's husband.
happened, we’re still not sure what the trigger was, I think you know that better than anyone else, and things spilled over, for a lack of a better term. Your shields ran rampant inside your head, and you locked it all away so tightly you essentially… gave yourself amnesia to a severe degree to protect yourself from the trauma.”
if Potter and his lot gets offended. “You can… you can tell Mother it’s okay. Potter’s not going to run off to the Department of Mysteries.”
Draco whips around so quickly Harry's almost certain that it's magic. No human has reflexes like that, surely.
They seem to be alone, and there doesn't seem to be any Inferi nearby... So there's a chance that they can deal with this without getting caught.
Harry doubles his efforts to get free. He feels his own magic start to surge in an attempt to throw Malfoy’s hex off.
He can point to the now existing papertrail that shows that he was in that shop to try out armchairs. He’s innocent.
The man smiles. "That will do. If you do not trust me to tell me, you shouldn't. But I will say this: if you
When Draco wakes up next, it’s to find that his lungs feel freer than they have in a long time. He’s breathing easy, and while he’s
“Only what a genuinely good idea living her with a private international Floo sounds.” He shrugs elegantly and lifts his bag and starts moving towards the Villa, knowing Pansy and Blaise will follow. “I’m actually surprised my parents haven’t thought to do so between the Manor and Château already.”
to marry Draco, so of course he doesn’t want Draco to turn his marriage proposal down. However, he doesn’t want to botch another proposal either. It’s become almost silly, and it’s actually starting to get painful.
As Draco gets a closer look at her, he realises that it’s the same healer who first diagnosed him with the wasting curse that’s slowly been killing him.
His parents, or one of the strangers, or one of the many funny little creatures that swarm around his feet and look at him with huge eyes as they tug at their large ears... Someone will interrupt his walk and take him to... He thinks it's the dining hall. But it looks so different from what it once was. The furniture is different, the rugs, the curtains, the look of the fireplace.
“Goblin made? I thought they were bankers…” Harry stares at Draco, confused. He has to admit that he didn't listen too well in Binns's lessons regarding the Goblin Wars, but it's still kind of weird. He feels like he should have at least remembered
One day, his mother brings in a new creature. He hasn't seen if before, he does not know what it is, but she places it in his arms, and it is soft. It has fur. Pale and bright fur. And as he holds it, it presses its nose against his cheek—small and cold and wet—and he can feel it vibrating against his chest, in his ears.
the amount of spells you need to cast to properly contain Basilisk venom. Father spoke about it a lot, when he warned me away from that particular vial. He didn't want me to get hurt by accident, you see. He knew I like to snoop around and that he couldn't exactly stop me.”
When he opens his eyes again—he’s surprised that he does, he didn’t think he ever would again—he’s in a place he doesn’t recognise. The bed isn’t his bed, it feels different, smells different. The room isn’t his room, it’s white and small, it doesn’t have any of his furniture and… And the bed isn’t big enough for Cassiopeia.
“You mean a lot to me, even though our friendship is different. We just haven't been friends as long. That doesn't mean that you're not my friend or that I don't care! It's just lying! Draco!”
Draco bites his lips but keeps quiet. He’s not going to say anything else until Harry’s finished. Probably. He’s at least going to
Father used to believe in the Dark Lord after all, so Potter was his enemy… But towards the end… Well, no Malfoy was especially enamoured with the Dark Lord at that point. But they’ll always do what they must to survive.
“How did you even… Did you follow us?” Potter frowns and crosses his arms over his chest, looking more like the frustrating shit he’d been in school than the man Draco had gotten to know over the last few months of their relationship.
He feels quite out of it, and he’s stopped listening, but from the vibrations of Harry’s chest against his back, Draco knows that he’s talking. Saying something. He closes his eyes and snuggles closer to Harry's warm body.
As soon as the Golden Trio take their leave, Father takes Draco by the elbow and leads him to the dining room instead. Mother and Father have been quite… Well,
At least they got Teddy out before she joined them. He still can't really believe that she did, despite everything. She lost her husband and daughter and even her son-in-law last time, and Harry wonders if that somehow affected her decision. He wonders if she thinks joining the NMO is somehow going to make sure she doesn't lose anyone this time. Though, arguably, she's already lost everyone, because the rest of her family are part of the Rebellion.
“Nurse Malbrook, has the patient’s family been notified?” the same voice says, though it’s far more hushed this time.
Draco shivers again, but nods. He did. He did his very best to shut things away in little boxes inside his head, to not let them affect him. It didn’t always work—he still couldn’t manage to kill Dumbledore, after all—but he doesn’t think he would have survived if he hadn’t done it.
Not to mention that it's almost the end of term and they're all heading home soon. There's no reason to worry about Potter now. No more danger for the time being, at least non for Draco to deal with. Potter will be fine, surely.
Especially not since that would ultimately be a weak point in his defences if Potter decides to get nasty. Anyone could easily fall victim to the Boy Who Lived’s charms. Draco would really rather not have someone help him break into his apartment. However unwittingly, of course.
Draco flounces past them. As much as he’s playing up his annoyance, he’s glad for it. If nothing else, his friends are
Draco lies curled up against Harry's side and sighs contentedly before taking a long sip of tea from his mug. The fire is sparking and lovely to watch, it creates a perfect atmosphere for the detective drama they’re currently listening to on the wireless.
Potter used to make him write. There was just something about his presence that sparked creativity in Draco. It's
Harry stares at him in disbelief. What the hell does Malfoy think he’s playing at? As if Harry’s just going to stay still and do nothing when Sirius…
"Harry... Be careful okay?” Black’s voice is soft, but he still sounds determined. “I'll contact Dumbledore, and we'll probably set up some sort of trap for You-Know-Who to make sure that the Ministry can't keep their eyes closed to the reality of his return anymore. Just... stay safe, okay?"
"I'm just saying, Hermione, I'm genuinely surprised Malfoy Senior is calm about this." He shrugs and looks entirely unrepentant even as his girlfriend glares at him. "I expected more weirdness from him."
How do you even admit something like this to someone? Even people who are your best friends? Who stuck with you even as you made the kind of mistakes that generally end with prison or death?
As one of Umbridge’s “inquisitors” or whatever, he has far more leeway than other students. However, he doesn’t want to get caught right now.
He doesn’t want to let go of it, but neither Mother nor Father tries to take it from him. They stay near, they talk as they always do, but they don’t try to take the stick.
It doesn't stop with the weavers either, the other craftsmen and artisans wants to test him as well... and  just as with the weaving, every pot, every painting, every sculpture... All of it is magnificent.
"Muh... Muh... Mah.." He struggles with the word, his tongue feels as heavy and leaden as the other times he's tried to speak a new word, say a name he has not already struggled through.
Harry's blood is pounding in his ears and he swallows harshly. Everything comes down to this: everything comes down to whether or not he'll be able to hold the onslaught off long enough for Draco to reverse the magic circle and end this whole nightmare.
“She probably didn’t want to give you a chance to back out, now that I won’t die before the big day.”
Perhaps he shouldn't be surprised that things didn't end well, that they crashed and burned the way they did. But somehow, he had almost thought that they would make it, that their relationship would stand the test of time.
Then he wanders again, until he reaches the... He thinks it's a library. There are so many bookcases, so many books... But what he's there for is the large armchair. He sits down in it and stares out the large windows at the grounds below. He watches as day turns to night.
Hermione and Ron soon join in, and Harry feels like everything is going to be alright. Even if they are heading for darker times.
that he should know. His mother and father's names are still gone. He cannot remember what they are.
Draco doesn't seem to have noticed, luckily, and is instead regaling Harry with a tale from work as he waves his fork around in the air as if to really drive home his point.
Unable to kill him unless he wished to lose his only chance against the God of the Sun, the God Wisher did the next best thing: he ripped the knowledge of the God of the Stars's own Ancient Name out of his mind, and with it his powers and memories.
Weasel, clearly illustrating his lack of upbringing, doesn’t answer and just proceeds to drag Draco along to the nearest Prefect bathroom. Draco complains the entire way there, though in a hushed tone because part of the Inquisitor Squad or not, he would really rather not get caught after curfew with this rabble.
Time passes, and Adriana is starting to feel like Draco has always been there... As if he just somehow belongs. She knows her fellow villagers agree, because she often hears them talk well about him.
“Oh Draco.” Father has never been as free with pet names as Mother, but Draco has always been able to hear “darling” and “mon petit chou” and everything in between in the way he says Draco’s names at times. The knowledge that even Father wants Draco to do this…
He wonders if it’s his Malfoy pride that doesn’t want to entertain the idea of being wrong. If it’s the shameful thought of having cried himself to sleep night after night over something that wasn’t real. If his friends saw through him—the embarrassment threatens to set his face aflame even as he wants to simply crawl into a hole—then no doubt his parents did too.
Even if Harry and Draco hadn't been inherently incompatible as a couple, it seems that adding their friends to the mix had made them so.
He can’t even enjoy the gardens as much as he used to, because they’re all grey. There’s no amazing bursts of colourful flowers to admire, it’s just all a grey shroud.
When they first started this whole thing, he wasn’t sure they would ever reach a stage where their relationship is
“Draco! Are you alright? How did it go? Did you manage to stop the damn boy from doing something foolish?” Father’s voice comes through strong, but Draco can see the worry on his face.
carried with her the secret of the God Wisher's weapon to the God of the Sun, for she had seen it in the God Wisher's mind. Such is the weakness of a god diminished, and he knew not that she dared put her life on the line to defy him.
The locket lets out a loud shrieking noise, and it almost sounds like a dying animal. Last death rattle of something unspeakable. It makes sense, Harry supposes, since it's a bit of Voldemort's soul. But it's still extremely unsettling.
The small furry creature, Cassiopeia, lies on his chest, and keeps licking him with that sharp tongue. But he feels himself slipping away into a daze, suddenly exhausted.
"Right," Father says. "Because it told us that there was no help to be found in the libraries. We did everything we could until we realised that it was futile…"
Potter's acting weirder than usual, and that's saying something. He won't stop staring and it's driving Draco absolutely out of his mind.
Most of their actual arguments, not just the petty squabbling, had been about Draco's interactions with Harry's friends, or Harry's interactions with Draco's friends.
Still, Draco thinks, as Potter bustles around the room cursing up a blue streak every time he hits his foot on something, maybe things are getting a bit better. Maybe Potter
At least Pansy is having the time of her life now that she realises that she can mock Umbridge openly without having to fear detention or something from Draco. Of course, she yelled at him for not telling her the truth about his opinion of her, but she calmed when she realised he hadn't even told Greg and Vince due to necessity and they even followed him into the Inquisition Squad.
“Excellent. I have some calming draught for you, and then Healer Binns is going to run through some tests with you, okay?”
Would they go away? Would Draco be left behind? Alone and broken? Or would his parents enter the same sort of state that Draco is in?
Still, having Ginny’s seal of approval on the ring and the proposal itself is a relief. Pansy had Opinions too, but Harry tuned her out. She’s been Draco’s friend longer than anyone, but for some reason she just doesn’t understand his taste and refuses to accept that she doesn’t. It’s a standing joke among the rest of them at this point, and Draco doesn’t mind getting gifts that are very much Not To His Taste… but only if they’re from Pansy. No one else gets any sort of leeway.
She has looked up at the night sky since childhood, stared at the empty black void above them and wondered what it must have been like when the stars lit up the sky with their gentle glow.
that Malfoy is attractive, in an abstract sort of sense—the same way  you know a film star is attractive—but he's never... never... He's never wanted to
Cassiopeia lets out a loud yowl then, prompting Draco into motion again. No point in standing around here like someone hiding in his own home.
. Somewhere they can take them to make sure that they only bring the healers who are actually on their side to the headquarters.
“Because the house elf can’t suspect anything! Mother is distracting him, but I don’t know how much longer she can! Any longer and he might go to bloody
"Harry..." Draco repeats the name, and his expression suddenly seems far away, as if he's entirely lost in thought at the mere sound of the name.
They curl together like small children, crying their hearts out for the future they'll never have, the future that was
“There's no one here,” another voice says. This one is not familiar to Harry, but by the way Draco tenses of behind him, it's clearly familiar to him.
Draco is acutely aware that they’re not alone. Potter shouldn’t sound like that in front of others, in
As Draco stares at the magnificent view, Harry reaches for the ring. His hand goes into his pocket… and finds nothing but air.
Draco's eyebrows fly towards his hairline in surprise. My, these days since Harry first came to the Manor must have let Father rant quite a lot judging by how calm he is. That's a relief.
“I ultimately had to ask for reinforcements, because they didn’t believe me. And then both Ginny and I had to take Veritaserum. Which we had to go and buy. All of us. Because they didn’t trust that we wouldn’t switch it out or something.”
It is a consequence of his own and his parents’ actions, and it’s simply something he has to live with.
"Perhaps we should give Harry and Draco some time alone?" A dreamy voice says from the back of the group.
Harry doesn't say anything, but he's kind of relieved that Hermione isn't here right now. She would probably start talking about elves’ rights again, and he doesn't want to hear her and Draco square off about it. It just seems like it would be a very uncomfortable situation for all of them. At the same time, however, he misses her. He misses rolling his eyes in time with Ron as Hermione and Draco get into some squabble about something or other, usually for no reason beyond an excuse to get to have an intellectual debate.
“You know as well as I do why you have to stay here, Draco. This is bigger than just us. We can't lose you, too; we can't lose another healer.” The fact that Harry wants to keep him safe and sound back at base, to never have to fear losing him... that is entirely secondary.
shared ideology, anyway. Father never was the most gung-ho about all the murder, according to himself. He could be lying, Draco supposes, but he’s quite sure Father thinks it’s
Kissing Cho was... not great. Not at all like he imagined it in fourth year, before... before everything. She cried in the middle of it and that hadn't exactly felt great for Harry in any way.
“Can't you ever just explain something? Do you always have to come with the insults first?” Harry's kind of used to it by now, but it feels like they don't really have the time to stand around chatting about this. They should do something, now that they have a goal.
“Loulou is sorry, she will being speaking l’anglais for Maître Draco’s guests.” She gives a small bow and her ears twitches. “I will being telling Bibi and taking the bags now.”
He looks up from his plate and his parents are... He thinks they're both smiling and crying. He doesn't know why anyone would smile and cry at the same time... But he thinks his parents are doing that anyway.
Draco is too weak to leave the bed under his own power. He's entirely reliant on his loved ones for everything, even magic beyond his reach now.
The silence that follows seems so loud suddenly, and Draco wonders what his friends are thinking. What they think about
.” As if Draco would have children outside of a marriage anyway. And truly, their relationship is far too new for talking about
Adriana feels trapped, uncertain of what she should do. Before she can make any decision, however...
The walk back downstairs to the foyer feels like an eternity, as if time is slowing down around him as he moves, or perhaps as if he's moving towards his doom.
He busies himself by settling into a lovely set of sofas and grabbing the Prophet lying on the table, opening it up and neatly hiding his face from anyone who might possibly be looking his way. Not that anyone will.
“We need to get to my father’s second study,” Draco whispers. “It's a secret one that he keeps all the dangerous stuff in. I'm technically not allowed inside, and he made sure that no one really
that he’s here. The generational blood magic that ties him to all of his family’s land and properties… It’s distinct in each place, and yet still familiar. He loves it.
"Hey! I cursed the ledger to make sure—!" she begins to defend herself, of course she does, but Draco cuts her off.
It was so recent but it still somehow feels so long ago, as if his heartache as made time slow down to an unbearable crawl and even brief spans of time stretch out into infinity.
He can’t bear the thought of it, even as the fear of it shakes through his bones, rattles in his skull and makes his teeth clack together as he tries to stop the howl that wants to escape his throat.
Draco had seemingly lit up in gratitude, though Adriana still hasn't seen him smile even once, which was a definite improvement compared to the almost morose state the story of the stars seemed to put him in.
The world is still grey—it always will be, because Draco’s Other is gone—and now he’s alone. He doesn’t have anyone at his side… Perhaps his parents finally got tired of him?
Harry feels his eyes widen almost painfully as Malfoy unclasps his cloak and lets it fall to the floor, leaving him in just his expensive looking robes.
Draco looks around the Gryffindor common room and stiffly refuses to shift from foot to foot. He cannot show any weakness right now, not surrounded by Gryffindors in their own territory.
Harry blinks furiously, trying to get his swimming vision under control, until he’s finally faced with the truth that it
And he’s quite sure his own eleven year-old self would scream if anyone had told him that would happen. It’s a funny enough thought that Draco lets out a small laugh.
He stumbles as he walks, he hears Cassiopeia yowl as it moves around his legs. He wonders if he should pick it up… It probably wants him to, but his arms feel shaky and weak and he fears he would only drop it.
Some gods are born gods; from the first time they come into existence they are gods, and until the moment they are unmade they remain gods.
Kingsley, Ron, and Lavender Brown step inside behind Hermione. They take their own seats by the table and look at Harry with grave eyes.
They finally make it to the debriefing room, and Harry takes a long-awaited seat with a loud groan. His leg really hurts and he feels generally bruised and exhausted, but the information is important enough that he  needs to debrief before he goes to sleep
The puce colour her toad-like face is turning as she stares in horror at the newspaper in front of her reminds Harry a lot of Uncle Vernon.
As one they all turn to the Malfoys, well, to Lucius and Narcissa. Draco sits next to Harry after all.
technically make his own Portkey—he’s always been good at charms—but the Ministry tends to get fussy when you do international Portkey travel without alerting them. And, well, Draco doesn’t want to risk any of it getting back to Harry.
Longbottom and the Weaslette are giving him uncomfortably intent glances, but Granger and Weasel are muttering something between themselves. Loony Lovegood is humming to herself and seemingly not paying attention to just about anyone else in the room. She’s a bloody Ravenclaw, so Draco has no idea what she was doing with Potter and his group. Aren’t Ravenclaws supposed to be smart?
Harry feels like his chest freezes to ice in utter disbelief. How does Malfoy know that they were heading to the Ministry of Magic to rescue someone? And why does he think it’s
The seconds continue to pass ever so slowly and Harry can hear his own heartbeat, can feel how harshly his pulse slams in his throat. Cold sweat starts to bead on his forehead and slowly drip down the back of his neck and into his shirt. He tries to swallow around his dry mouth and focuses on keeping his breathing even.
she’s happier now that Harry’s on the cusp of marriage. He ran the ring by her, because she’s always had an eye for things that would make Draco’s eyes sparkle without being so ostentatious and overdone they would make anyone else roll their eyes and want to die.
The doors burst open just after Harry says it, and he freezes in place. Standing out in the open like this, when the Herders are definitely looking for something is the worst thing that could have happened to them.
With a promise of taking his N.E.W.T.s in France, with colour returned to his world, and with this new
He's so shocked he doesn't react immediately, instead freezing in place as he hears people scream around him—there aren't many out right now, it's early on a Saturday—and trying to catch up to what just happened.
"Are you all right?" she asks gently. He looks happy, but considering he said that he suffers from amnesia...
what would have set that spiral off, what final trauma would have caused his Occlumency to go haywire.
If either one of them had moved just a bit closer, their lips would have touched. They could have kissed.
He hears a garble of words and the rushing of footsteps, but it’s all off, muffled and muddled, as if he were underwater.
“Do you see anyone?” one of the Herders calls out. there's something familiar about the voice, but Harry can't quite place it.
“Uh, as I was saying, er,” Potter begins with his usual eloquence. “I’ve been colourblind on one eye since the Battle of Hogwarts, so we’ve been trying to figure out what happened. It wasn’t until you sent us to talk to healers regarding losing your Other that we really got anywhere.”
It may not be a healthy way to live, Draco is quite sure that it isn’t, but for now it is how he will live. Just until he can properly come to grips with it, accept what has happened.
very clearly tell you she loves you? I must have imagined all of that then, I suppose. Silly me.” If he clenches his jaw any harder, he’s likely to start ruining his teeth, but…
Like a flashback in a bad film, Harry remembers chucking the ring beneath his pillow just before Draco came back into the bedroom while they were packing for the trip.
It’s too much. He’s sure Potter can spin some fucking bullshit explanation if Draco were to ask, probably something about the lease or maybe being tired of living with a couple who probably has loud sex—oh Merlin, why did he have to have that thought? That’s disgusting, he doesn’t want to think about what Weasley and Granger get up to at all.
That one is… It’s hard to swallow. Draco always liked Snape, and only in part because the man would occasionally dote on him—well, as much as Professor Snape doted on anyone. He was Draco’s favourite Professor, the only one who wasn’t biased against Slytherins—how could he be, being a Slytherin facing the same prejudices himself—in favour of all the other houses.
Harry sighs and runs one hand aggressively through his hair, mussing it up even worse than it usually is.
Harry clutches him close, presses a kiss against his hair, waits for him to pull himself together enough for a
“It took us a few weeks to sort out what, exactly, was causing your more or less catatonic state. When we did, we brought in expert Legilimens to sort you out.”
Harry splutters, and likely would have spit out any food or drink he had in his mouth, so Draco feels almost entirely too relieved that they finished their tea earlier.
“Draco," he whispers. “I just felt something. It might be Voldemort, he might have set up a trap for us here.”
“That’s… That’s fair, Harry.” And it is. It’s better than anything Draco could have hoped for, after all. And even that concession is enough for Draco to feel comfortable to continue being together with Harry, because Harry’s not immediately against the idea.
“Did you know?” Blaise’s voice is low and painfully neutral, the way it is whenever he’s got an assumption but hoping it’s wrong.
"We're going to have to be careful," he says, unable to take his eyes off the amulet hanging from Draco's fist. "And we're going to have to set up Apparition points along the way."
that Harry realises that if Malfoy hadn’t stopped Dumbledore’s Army from getting caught… Maybe Umbridge would have managed to unseat Dumbledore as headmaster entirely.
"Cas... Cass... Cassiee..." he gasps, chest feeling tight, his lungs aching, and his eyes stinging from how avidly he's staring.
Perhaps it’s mean of him to think so, but she always has been a know-it-all, even if you completely disregard blood status.
“Right,” Weasley chimes in. “The healers said it usually corrects itself when the part of the Pair who didn’t die sees their Other and knows them to be alive and well again.”
He’s not going to do anything fancy like that this time, just a lovely meal at home—one Harry is cooking
At least he can rest assured in the fact that Harry is equally gone with him. As Draco slides his arms around Harry’s shoulders, he revels in the feeling of Harry’s hands on his waist.
speak. He cannot remember a time when words and sounds and speaking made sense. He cannot remember the time before he lost the names, before he lost colours, before he lost his
He wonders if it would have been easier to die in the autumn, or perhaps during winter, when everything else is dying too. He wonders if hearing the birds sing and watching the flowers bloom makes it harder to accept the fact that he's going to die soon. That while everything else is growing and full of life, he's slowly being drained of his.
Hana laughs. "I'd say. How about it, stranger?" She looks intently at the man, who seems deep in thought.
Harry doesn't answer, he only cries harder and pulls Draco into his arms, burying his wet face in Draco's hair.
“I guess we both fucked up… But uh… Well, I’m glad you wanted to tell everyone because… Well, I kinda have now. In my short depressive episode right after I got the letter, I ended up crying on Ron’s shoulder about it, so probably not the best way to tell him and Hermione about it.
“Do you think so? It would be very helpful for us if there were more of us than just the two of us, right?”
Hermione shakes her head furiously, Parkinson is giggling into her hands, and Zabini just shrugs with a stupid smirk on his stupid face.
But perhaps that's best to leave for the future. For now, Draco wants to focus on something far more immediate: he wakes to get healthy in time for his
His father stops then, and he thinks his father looks sad, but then his father moves to his side and helps him to his feet, gently stroking his hair and making gentle shushing noises. He likes that better, when his parents don't try to speak, when they just make gentle noises he can understand.
If things go wrong, and Draco dies, Harry doesn't know if he'll go on. He might just let the inferi take him.. No. No he won't. If he does, then he's going to be a problem for his friends at a later point, probably. He couldn't put them through that. Couldn't possibly risk that.
"Are you certain, my Lord? Potter and my son have had a very... antagonistic relationship since their first year. Even if Potter lusts after my son, I doubt he'll be willing to overlook their past to... Make his dreams a reality."
where to find him. That’s… that’s ridiculous. Absolutely insane. It cannot possibly be true. Draco may have had the thought himself, but it’s still absolutely ridiculous.
Now that Harry thinks about it, it's pure luck that he and Draco are even here right now. Draco might never have found them in the forest and then Harry... he would be all alone.
He wants to go back to thinking he and Harry actually had a relationship and there was a chance for them to come clean to their friends and family, that there was a chance for them to have a relationship out in the open.
Draco’s core has grown stronger and stronger, and he starts to experiment more and more with charms and transfiguration.
He chases the thought away with the image of Draco's peacefully sleeping face, and falls into his dreams with Draco on his mind.
Unrolling it, he finds that it’s a letter written in French, detailing in elegant cursive that he’s been accepted for a six-month fast-track at Beauxbatons for exams that are N.E.W.T.s equivalent and can be transferred into N.E.W.T.-grades should someone need it.
“Next week?” Harry’s thoughts are running a mile a minute and he’s just grateful Draco hasn’t felt the ring box in his pocket. If Draco wants a kneazle, then Draco’s getting a kneazle.
“What’s that then, Potter?” Malfoy says and sneers through his panting. “Going to the Ministry of Magic to get you and your friends killed in a mad attempt at a doomed rescue mission based on a lie, huh? That’s what you’re so busy with, huh?”
Harry doesn't know what to do about the dreams. Over and over he dreams about snogging Malfoy while they're naked in a bed. Over and over he dreams of... having
The last piece of food one of the small funny creatures puts before him looks interesting. He pokes at it gently, watches as it moves and falls apart from the action. He takes a bit and puts it in his mouth.
Spring is really showing its best side, and Harry knows that Draco, for all his poshness, does so love the outdoors. Well, not the “
Cassiopeia has made her home on Draco’s lap, purring up a storm, and Father has his face buried in Draco’s hair, clutching his other hand like a life-line.
It is odd, perhaps, that the story of their loss brings Adriana comfort due to how monumental and devastating their loss was,
been like that. In school, he just used to channel stupid and petty things rather than what he's done in adulthood, but the fact of it remains the same.
If the Herders call the Inferi, Harry and Draco may just have to apparate away to safety, and possibly lose all of the progress they made here when the Herders undo the work they did with the crystal.
Harry's walking through Hogwarts again. It's still empty, but this time the portraits are moving around—still not saying anything though.
that you’re dramatic, and that sometimes you get away from yourself like this.” He laughs softly. “It’s one of the things I love about you. If I couldn’t handle you being dramatic, we wouldn’t have made it as far as we did before all of this in the first place.”
He wonders if he has himself to blame, for wondering if Potter’s return would help his creative output. He wonders if he somehow summoned Potter through all of his ridiculous longing and all the letters he wrote.
“No! I even tried to ask you what you were doing when you blew off our standing Saturday date! And you just told me to not worry about it! And then the whole thing with her happened!”
Travel at sea has become much more treacherous since the stars were lost, Old Tobias would say. They used to be a seaman's guide at night, one of the most easy and clear tools for navigation on the ocean.
If not for the fact that Ginny helped Harry make sure everything would be Just Right, he would probably be even more nervous right now. If that’s even possible. He’s got a plate of his favourite French food he can’t pronounce in front of him, and he can barely eat it. That really says it all.
Ron shakes his head. "I mean… yeah, but that ritual you found. The one that sort of made you stop looking…"
"Well, no one has ever accused you Gryffindors of being subtle, so I'm not really surprised, all things considered." He rolls his shoulders. "Are you done now? Will you let me leave or are you going to
He seems... content, but not happy. Perhaps she shouldn't be surprised, considering that he's missing almost all of his memories, but it still makes her sad and worried for him. It would be far better if he could make his peace and decide to make new memories, rather than long for those he lost.
“You did tell me that, yeah.” Harry feels oddly breathless as he stares at Draco, who is now positively beaming with pride. It's a really good look on him. most things look really good on him, if Harry is being honest.
. Ginny’s been eyeing him weirdly lately, but he doesn’t want to admit to her the complete hash he’s managed to make out of all of this.
Draco's eyesight is going, so Harry has taken to reading for him. Always in the garden, even if it's raining—there are charms for that, after all.
Harry hates that he has to tell them that he and Draco can't wait, that they can't risk staying here without doing something because of the Herders in the building and the Inferi outside it.
different, just not in the way that the horcrux is implying. It's not that Draco doesn't mean as much to him, or because they haven't been friends as long... It's just that Draco is... Draco. And Harry wants to kind of snog him. Sometimes. But he's never wanted to snog Hermione or Ron. So his friendship with Draco is fundamentally different.
He turns in slow circles, because they don't know how many points of entry there are to the factory floor, so they cannot know for certain which direction the Herders will come from when they return.
On the topic of forgiving Potter, however... well. Draco will leave that for now. Maybe he should have been more receptive to talking about his feelings back then, but he’d just been a bit down on occasion! There was nothing to talk about! He’d just wanted Potter to stop prying, not break up with him.
“Want to help me propose, Cassie-girl?” he murmurs, and gently lifts her into his lap. She purrs loudly and rubs her face against Harry’s. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Greyback before he could kill a Gryffindor girl in retaliation for the months he’d terrorised Draco with the threats of what he
Potter would probably resent the comparison, but Draco is currently feeling about equally charitable to both of them. His utter disdain for Voldemort having only softened slightly because the bastard is dead and ashes and actively hating him is more effort than he’s worth. Really, Draco would rather not think about him ever again than go on hating him. He's simply not worth the effort.
If he forgets that the little furry creature's name is Cassiopeia, will that veil fall over the world again? Will it all grow even hazier? If he loses a name he's gained, what will happen? Perhaps he'll stop functioning entirely.
Draco leans into him then, and Harry wraps his arm around him. He doesn’t sigh in frustration, but it’s a near thing. At least the ring is still in his pocket, he concludes, discreetly patting it.
He leaves Potter in the foyer, wonders what the hell Blaise and Pansy will think of the whole thing. After all, they kept unusually quiet during the whole thing. Draco nearly forgot they were even there in the first place.
Hana just laughs, her eyes twinkling with humour. Before they get any further into the discussion, however, the gentle scrape of a chair against the floor catches Adriana's attention, and she sees the pale man get to his feet.
, considering the constant barrages of angry demands Malfoy is yelling at him, increasingly out of breath, as they run to grab Sirius’s mirror.
Maybe after he talks to someone about it, he'll feel more charitable. Or at the very least less raw and aching inside.
“I’m really not joking, Seamus,” Ginny Weasley says with another laugh. “It’s only going to be temporary while Grimmauld Place is being renovated—and let’s not get into all his demands on
"In a way, yes. They're using the glyphs and the rooms to taint and just utterly change the nature of the Life Crystal. And in doing so there basically creating the living dead.
to stay in this dreadful forest, then I know precisely what we should be doing. We should go to Malfoy Manor,” Draco says, as if that wasn't the craziest thing Harry has heard all week. All year even.
Draco doesn't move. Neither does Harry. The more still they stay, the greater the chance their disillusion charms will remain entirely undetected and Draco won't have to hide under the invisibility cloak with Harry. They decided it was better if they could move more freely, rather than being almost trapped together beneath the cloak... but Harry finds himself questioning that decision now.
Harry shares a long look with Lucius Malfoy, and knows that they're thinking the same thing: they don't always agree, they don't like each other, but for Draco’s sake, they're both willing to do just about anything. Keeping each other safe is not much of a hardship, all things considered.
Still, things don’t improve much from there. Draco continues to work on the wedding, and together with Harry, he puts the finishing touches on the planning—the only thing that hasn’t been done is
Whatever it is that is happening to him, he wonders if it’s the beginning of the end. If he’s coming ever closer to the void of Death, if perhaps he’s losing it.
Ten minutes later, when he was lying in a pool of water and blood, Uncle Severus kneeling over him, casting, chanting, and looking utterly terrified, Draco could hear them. Four words, echoing inside his head. Four words, reassuring him even as he drifted off into the numb, all-encompassing darkness.
As Draco rang up the order and placed their cookies on a plate, he felt his muted phone vibrate in his pocket, not once, but twice in quick succession. He ignored it, of course, no way was he going to pick up his phone in front of a paying customer. Instead, he busied himself making the couple’s drinks, forcing himself to focus as he reached the critical stage, this time managing to produce a perfect cinnamon heart on the chai latte.
He and Ginny were over. Not a dramatic break-up by any means, but an amicable agreement after realising they both wanted something different than the other would be able to provide. He wanted something bigger, something more than what he’d felt with her. She wanted something softer, more comfortable than he was able to give her. So he was letting go of his dream of a life with her, and although he knew it was for the best, it still felt like one more casualty of the war.
When dinner was over and Draco was sure he’d never eat another bite of anything, the family settled into the sitting room and played games. Draco hung back, watching from the doorway as Harry stepped over and nudged his shoulder.
Draco tastes sweet, but like nothing Harry could ever describe. He tastes like…well, Draco, he supposes, and the notion is making him dizzy. The feel of Draco’s tongue brushing against his own, learning the contours of Harry’s mouth, has Harry craving to do the same. Reaching up to wrap his arms around Draco’s neck, Harry pulls him closer and pushes back into Draco’s mouth. It’s hot and wet and eager, it’s lips and tongues and teeth, and the intimacy of the give and take, the push and pull, makes Harry want so much more. Running on instinct, he moans and pushes his hips forwards, prompting Draco to gasp and pull away.
Draco’s heart tore a little at that, but Harry was right. He wasn’t an expert. “Yeah, well, spending two decades with them hasn’t made you one either.”
The sound that emerges from Harry's chest is incomprehensible. It's loud and needy, and he'd be terribly embarrassed if this wasn't so.
for Draco. With his own hands. Unable to cope with any more of his confused thoughts, Draco turned back to Charlie. Charlie, the man he was about to marry.
Draco smiled, squeezing Harry’s hand, and he just knew his eyes sparkled with the delight of being on the arm of a man who knew him so well.
“I know,” you say, offering a playful pout that makes me want to lean in and suck that protruding lip into my mouth, maybe even nibble on it for a while. “What I don’t know is
"Indeed," Draco replies quietly. "But seriously, thank you for getting me away. For showing me that I'm more than what they see."
Oh how your father hated me for tricking him into freeing Dobby. You should’ve seen the man’s face as he realised what had just happened; it might just be one of my life’s most satisfying moments to date.
What the fuck was Draco doing here? Why wasn’t he where he was supposed to be, with Narcissa and Andromeda? And why the hell had he shown up dressed like this, wearing his Santa costume? Why did Draco always insist on being so weird and unpredictable? If he’d only been able to behave like a normal person… It would have made him so much less intriguing and irresistible.
“You’re just a big softie, aren’t you?” Draco smiled and patted its head, then reached into his pocket, pulling out the large sandwich Pansy had pushed onto him before kicking him out of the ballroom.
He hadn’t planned to elaborate on the matter, but the wine had apparently tampered with his mind-to-mouth filter. That, and the unexpected comfort of sitting in front of Harry, another wizard; the only person in this non-magic world who could possibly understand what Draco had gone through. When Draco spoke again, the words came unbidden, voicing a truth he, until now, hadn’t even admitted to himself.
As he quickens his pace — suck, lick, swirl, swallow — Draco gets louder, crying Harry's name, his wings unconsciously expanding the closer he gets to his climax.
“Hey, no need to get defensive…” Draco said, holding up his open palms in a placating gesture. “I never said I didn’t like it, did I?”
“Um, thanks.” Draco bit his lip, only hesitating for a moment before convincing himself to cross the threshold. “Here.”
Draco took his time, sucking and licking and kissing a trail up Harry’s chest, along his neck, and all the way up to his ear. The hand fondling Harry’s cock squeezed lightly as he whispered, “Have you been a good boy this year?”
Draco glanced up at the man standing over by the window. He looked unkempt — an unshaven jaw, dark curly hair without a trace of product, strange clothes unlike anything Draco’d ever seen before — but he had a kind warm smile, and when he gestured towards the bed with a polite, “May I?” Draco could only nod.
“Pott— Harry…” Draco squeezes his eyes shut and swallows before they flutter open once more. “I-I don’t think that’s a good idea.” He shifts his weight to his toes and rises to standing in one elegant fluid motion, starting to back away. Harry’s Seeker reflexes are the only reason he manages to grab Draco’s pale arm in time, preventing him from moving too far.
“Oh, don’t start on me.” There was a slight note of panic mixed with the laughter in Ginny’s voice. “Mum knows I’m a lost cause at the moment. ‘A girl can’t settle down if she’s cavorting around the world on a broom,’” she mocked in a dead-on impersonation of Molly. “I have absolutely no interest in a relationship right now, and Mum has finally accepted this.”
He patted Draco’s shoulder and stepped back. Draco was reeling, his mind in tumult, but he managed to smile and thank the man before the Minister left to join his wife.
Malfoys didn’t run. Ever. Running was for reckless Gryffindors or absent-minded Hufflepuffs, Draco knew that. Which was why he wasn’t running out of the Great Hall heading for the stairs, wasn’t running away from Potter and Bell and the truth that would soon explode and destroy him, his family, and everything he’d worked for for so long.
Bill groaned. “Fine.” He moved to the bed and everyone stepped back. Draco held his breath, hoping that Ernie hadn’t been making things up.
He trailed off, effectively silenced by Draco’s death glare. “So, just because I occasionally enjoy a slice of cheese on my Granny Smith, it suddenly makes me pregnant?”
Reckoning the coast clear for now, Harry wills his hands to stop trembling as he grabs the mugs and exits the kitchen. His eyes are inevitably drawn to Draco’s door, the sound of Draco moving around in there doing Godric knows what teasing him, tempting him, taunting him. The man is most likely just putting on some fresh clothes, but Harry’s imagination is currently having a field day.
Draco bit his lip as he sent off the message, then promptly jumped a mile high in his seat when the phone started buzzing in his hand.
Yet, I realise that I could never risk you finding out, could never risk having you walk out of my life now that we’ve finally learnt how to get along.
He nodded. “We aren’t really the same after…after. And, well, I’ve been imagining what it is that I want, and what we had just didn’t feel right.”
He shrugged uncomfortably. “Well, I need to maintain my image, don’t I?” He pulled Ernie’s paperwork from the folder on his lap and handed it to her. “I promised Macmillan I’d bring this over. He said it was urgent?”
Speaking of, here’s a secret for you, Draco, something no one else knows, not even Ron and Hermione: The sorting hat wanted to put me in Slytherin at first, but thanks to you and your haughty attitude, I convinced it not to. Yes, the great Harry Potter could have been a Slytherin. Can you imagine? Us, sharing a dorm in that creepy underwater dungeon of yours, sharing the same table for countless meals in the Great Hall, fighting for the same seeker position on our house team? Of course, you wouldn’t have stood a chance against me, but then you’d probably have cheered me on from the stands instead, wouldn’t you? I mean, who knows? If we were housemates, this never-ending feud between us might’ve never existed… Imagine that…
After dinner, Draco watched everyone gather around the Christmas tree, piling onto sofas and chairs, large pillows on the floor and conjured stools. It was chaotic, with the baby being passed from person to person nearly as much as the cups of wassail and punch. The eldest children handed out the gifts, and Draco watched everyone’s delight as they unwrapped their presents.
His stomach-turning, Draco put them all into the rubbish bin and vanished the contents. An Air-Freshening Charm followed and, finally, Draco was able to breathe again.
“The silver Sickle you always carry around and fiddle with anytime you’re feeling nervous?” Harry grinned and nodded towards Draco’s trouser pocket where, yes, Draco was currently fingering the coin in question.
He sighed and tore off a piece of his sandwich, tossing it to the dog. He took a bite of his own and chewed thoroughly before continuing.
“I’m so sorry. It all happened so fast. I was in Charlie’s room, checking on the man I saved from a dragon, the man who worked for my friend, and then you all came in and there were so many of you, everyone talking and worried about Charlie. When someone said I was his fiancé, I was as shocked as you, but then you hugged me, welcomed me into your family—” His eyes burned and his throat was closing up, but he cleared it and kept going, ignoring the quiver in his voice. “And I couldn’t bring myself to tell you the truth; I didn’t want to make you more upset than you already were. And then I didn’t
Divination had never been Draco’s strong suit, however, and when the bell attached to the door jingled the next day to announce not reporters, nor Aurors, but the man and his friend, Draco could only hope no one caught the surprise threatening to overtake his features.
“Ron! I’m eight months pregnant. Of course, I had to go. And thank you very much for announcing it to everyone.” She approached her mother-in-law with a slight waddle and put her arm around her waist. “The doctor said he’s going to be okay, Molly. You should sit down, though. It’s not good for your nerves to get this worked up.”
Had it been anyone else, Draco would’ve been obliged to ask for a specification regarding the tea, presenting the various options and guiding them to an informed decision. However, with this woman, he knew not to bother with the company guidelines. He’d made that mistake once, his first week on the job, only to receive a ten minutes’ lecture on how and why Earl Grey was the only blend worthy of the name tea, and how anyone thinking otherwise were ‘deluded dimwits devoid of dignity and decorum’. Draco still cringed thinking about the experience, but once the air had been cleared between them, and Draco had got a chance to commend her for her inspired alliteration, she had turned out to be the sweetest grandma.
“And then the hospital just accepted all this, and they’re telling everybody I’m the fiancé, and they’re giving me his personal items to care for, and I’m not kidding, Pans, this is all going to come back and bite me in the arse any day now, I just know it, and then—”
“Don’t you give me that virtuous act. You, sir, are a liar.” Draco sat down across from Sirius and crossed his legs. “And you’re fired.”
“You just disappeared,” Harry said after helping himself to a second slice of the dessert Draco had contributed to their evening. Draco looked up from his plate to find Harry watching him curiously. “I remember reading about your release, and then… Was it even two weeks before you—”
A slight movement of platinum-blond hair, caused by a minuscule headshake, and, after another endless second, a weak, cracked whisper. “No.”
Cancelling the spell around them, he picked up the bag and walked back into Charlie’s room. It felt even quieter now after the Weasley whirlwind had subsided, the low beeps of the monitoring spells now reassuring, like white noise. He sat down on the same chair as before, placing the bag on the floor beside him.
“Let me take over for a while,” she said, beating him to the cup he’d been aiming for. “Pumpkin spice latte,
When Draco didn’t move, Potter ventured another step closer, cautious as if approaching a wounded wild animal. Draco could have backed off, but he didn’t. He just stayed there as if petrified until Potter was no more than a foot from him, right up in Draco’s personal space and still, Draco didn’t move. A large, warm hand wrapped around Draco’s own, making him lower the wand he wasn’t even aware he’d been directing at Potter just moments earlier.
Nobody in the room seemed to know who he was talking about, and Draco watched with concern as the first signs of true panic crossed Charlie’s face, his breathing quickening.
Even so, it was enough to convince Harry that perhaps he liked blokes as well as girls, and to realise he wanted more than just a light romance with a friend. He and Ginny had both agreed they wanted more than that after the war, and what Harry wanted was, well…
“I guess that’s one way to look at it,” Harry allowed, amusement tugging at the corner of his mouth, “but that’s not what I see.”
Sighing, he picked them up and washed them in the sink, then began spooning the canned food into the bowl. “Kitty-kitty?”
“Slyvia, I’m really not in the mood tonight.” He stood up and stalked to the door. “Yes, you look beautiful; yes, I know my arse would make an angel sing, and no, I will not run away with—”
“He’s been home too much lately. I haven’t been able to take him to the Reserve this week, given everything else going on, and it’s not good for him to be alone so much. Foxes are pack animals, you know, and I’m his pack.” Draco looked down at the crate in front of him and used his wand to spell off the top. It was the oil portrait promised by Dean Thomas. He reached for his clipboard and checked off the auction item before levitating it to the easel prepared for it on the far side of the ballroom. “Besides, he’s still a baby.”
Draco felt his heart rate quicken and glared at Sirius, who just sent him a completely innocent smile in return. Fucking Black family morality.
He wasn’t too worried about giving it all away beforehand, figuring his nervous anticipation should be able to come off as excited grand-opening adrenaline. Yet, in an attempt to rein in his racing heart, he channelled his bone-deep exhaustion from countless weeks of preparations and made his way across the room, balancing the two cups in his trembling hands while greeting each smiling customer with a friendly nod as he passed their table.
Harry broke the silence that followed, clearing his throat. “Right, well, Charlie, I’m sure you’re tired and need some sleep, so maybe we should all leave you alone for a bit.” He walked over to Charlie and leaned down, giving the man a casual one-armed hug as best he could with Charlie still laying in his bed. “Good to have you back, mate.”
Harry was shaking with suppressed laughter now, and Draco couldn’t help letting an audible snicker escape his own lips. It was all so ridiculous. And yes, perfect.
Despite its title, it’s actually not a coffee shop AU, but even so, it’s friggin’ awesome, so if you haven’t read it already, please promise you’ll do it asap (after you’ve finished this one, obviously 😉)
Draco growled and lunged, taking Harry’s mouth in a fierce kiss that wiped away every trace of coherent thought from Harry’s mind and left him breathless. When Draco withdrew, it was only to assault Harry’s neck instead, mouthing his way down Harry’s stubbled skin to the accompanying sound of Harry’s needy whimpers. With a bit of hard-earned concentration, Harry managed to wriggle his wrists out of Draco’s grip, freeing his hands to slide under the fabric of Draco’s fur-brimmed coat. The broad leather belt was already on the floor, fallen off after Draco’s body had returned to its usual lean self. None of them had noticed it fall, too wrapped up in each other to pay attention to such trivial things as the clunking sound of a heavy metal buckle meeting wooden floorboards.
My words get stuck in my throat, hindered by the lack of oxygen in my lungs. Apparently, I’ve stopped breathing at some point, probably when my body realised the tip of your nose is only a few inches from mine, and for some reason, I can’t seem to figure out the mechanics of inhaling and exhaling anymore. Instead, I smile, hoping it will convey the support I’m currently unable to articulate.
this wasn’t it. An unyielding metal disc digging its sharp edges into Draco’s left palm told him otherwise.
Harry didn’t hesitate. He leaned in, his lust-blown eyes never leaving Draco’s as he braced himself with one hand next to Draco’s head and licked his lips.
Over the month they'd been out of school, they'd figured out the appropriate charms to allow Harry to fly with Draco more easily than their first attempt. A combination of Sticking Charms and Weightless Charms did the trick — currently combined with an array of Disillusionment and Notice-me-not Charms — and now Harry was able to fly comfortably with his mate, Draco's secure arms tight around his waist.
The silence in the room was deafening, but Sirius broke it by letting out a long whistle. “Well, fuck me.”
Instead, I’m just the guy who takes you home. The one who makes sure you rehydrate and get to bed in one piece. The one who makes sure you have a hangover potion and a hearty breakfast waiting for you the following morning.
“Thanks.” He nodded at the young man and breezed into Pansy’s office. She was sitting at her desk and on the phone, her back to him as she spoke, looking out the window. He grinned as she held up a finger to him over her head. There wasn’t much his best friend wasn’t aware of.
The unmistakable sound of Apparition echoed through the room, startling Draco enough to almost drop the device to the floor. He grabbed its chain in the nick of time, just before the malfunctioning gadget turned into worthless pieces of crap.
Even so, he can’t find it in him to move away. Instead, he attempts for some distance by placing an open palm on Draco’s chest. The sight of his hand there, touching Draco’s body, is so surreal Harry can’t take his eyes off it. He’d never thought he’d be able to touch Draco like this, that Draco would ever let him. With only a thin layer of cotton between them, Harry can feel Draco’s rapidly beating heart under his palm, its pulse reverberating up Harry’s arm towards his chest, reaching for Harry’s heart as if wanting to become one with Harry’s heartbeat.
Blaise. I’d just come back from inside when I saw them snogging in front of the bonfire, and I guess the sight caught me by surprise because, according to Theo, I had been sitting on the steps to the porch for nearly twenty minutes when he eventually came over to join me. He asked me if I was okay. I guess he thought I might be jealous of his mate or something, but I assured him I wasn’t. I told him my mood had nothing to do with Ginny and all to do with the prospect of ending up alone, and then, for some inexplicable reason, I mentioned what you’d said, that you thought I should give kissing boys a try.
Draco held out the canister he used for his Floo powder and Harry took a handful, calling out for the Reserve and stepping through the fire. Draco turned back to his flat, casting a Locking Spell at his wardrobe to protect its content from any more canine invasions before allowing himself to be whisked away by the green flames.
PS You? Dance? With that stiff posture of yours that makes it look like you have a stick up your arse 24/7? Please forgive my scepticism, but I really can’t see it. Maybe you’ll just have to show me sometime. Not that I’m any good at it or anything; I couldn’t dance if my life depended on it. Whenever I try, my body simply refuses to cooperate and I only end up feeling awkward and thoroughly embarrassed. So, no, there’ll be no dance floor at any party of mine if I can help it. But I can assure you there are lots of other ways to have fun.
“I’m not sure. His mother was so happy, and she hugged me so tightly. And then Sirius said the news about our engagement was the only thing helping her hold it together; that she can’t be worried about losing another child.”
"What?" Harry asks, trying to raise his head, but Draco nudges it back down and scoots away slightly.
So I do it. At late o’clock in the evening, in the middle of Nott’s pre-Christmas party, I begin the difficult task of raising the walls around my heart. Impenetrable walls to protect my inconvenient feelings towards you within a fortress of self-preservation, preventing them from ever seeing the light of day.
Potter’s eyes narrowed, and Draco watched with trepidation as the man opened his mouth to speak. But then Potter hesitated, seemingly coming to some sort of internal decision before taking a deep breath. “Congratulations on your engagement,
“Coming! Good luck,” she added with a wink in Draco’s direction before hurrying away. Draco took a deep breath, turning towards Charlie’s room. He could do this.
“Thank you,” he said quietly, taking in her quiet look of understanding. She thought he was distraught over his fiancé, after all.
It’s the first evening you’re spending in our flat in days. I’ve looked forward to it, to finally having you home with me again. I’ve missed you so much. Now that you’re here, though, even as you’re sitting right beside me, I realise I still miss you.
We’re de-gnoming the garden today, in preparation for next Saturday’s party. It’s not going to be a fancy thing or anything, just a bunch of friends over for food and drinks, chatter and laughter, maybe some pick-up quidditch for those who’re up for it. George has promised a bonfire later in the evening, but that’s probably as exciting as it’ll get. I’d invite you to come, if it weren’t for… Anyway, thanks for the heads-up on Nott and Zabini. Sounds like I’d better not drink too much, or who knows what I’ll spill, or to whom.
His cock had been rock hard for what felt like an eternity, throbbing where it laid pressed against Harry’s soft duvet. Every fibre of his body screamed for him to move, to thrust against the mattress, to seek out any form of friction available, chasing that sweet release rapidly pooling hot and fierce in his heavy balls. He swallowed down his embarrassment, acutely aware of the sticky mess soaking the fabric of his pants, pretty sure he’d be staining Harry’s sheets with his pre-come if he didn’t find a way to somehow fix the leak, and soon.
Sirius smiled, and Draco realised his grey eyes resembled Draco’s own. “I don’t think you would, Draco. If I thought there was even a chance of that, I’d… Well, nevermind. You get the idea. I’m fairly sure you know better than anyone what a Black is capable of.”
Fuck. Now I feel like the most selfish prick ever. Merlin, I’m sorry, I will tell them, I promise. Not today, though — I’m not as stupid as to deliberately distract Hermione this close to N.E.W.T.s week — but maybe after the exams are finally over and done with?
The undisputable nearness of another man leaning close to him now, though, the heady whiff of earthy tones and sugary sweetness told him otherwise. Harry fucking Potter was invading his personal space, and Draco had to bite back a groan as he tried to remember why it wouldn’t be a great idea to bend over right then and there, begging Harry to take him against the counter.
Draco shook his head at her theatrics. “Yes, well, I’m high in calories so you’d probably better refrain. Listen, I’m on my way out, so… Did you need anything, Slyvia?”
Sighing, he turned and made his way into the hall and adjusted his jacket in the mirror before opening the door.
Now, keep your fingers crossed I’ll be able to sneak this letter out to the owlery in time without anyone noticing.
He stepped into the next room, the main reception area used by anyone coming or going as the Reserve was warded against Apparition to prevent disturbances for the dragons. The intern, currently serving as receptionist, nodded as Draco waved and stepped into the Floo.
“No, I—” Harry gasped as Draco grabbed his arse possessively with both hands. It was awfully hard to think when Draco was nuzzling his neck like that. The soft hairs of his moustache were tickling his skin and— “I meant… n-neat and tidy isn’t rea—
“You’re going to make some bad decisions along the way — and so will I — but when the time comes, when it matters the most, you will make the right one; the one that changes everything.”
“Huh? Oh, the wards.” Harry waved the question off as he retreated further into the flat, supposedly towards the kitchen. “They told me someone was—”
They weren't expecting any company. All the people Harry knew had places to be, friends and family to be with. Moreover, if any of them had indeed decided on a change of plans, they’d use the Floo, right?
“Oh, I don’t know that that’s any of my shop’s doing.” Draco opted for humbleness, a trait he’d soon learnt after joining the Muggle world only for his own limited knowledge to strike him with the force of a wrecking ball to a sandcastle. “Didn’t Flourish & Blotts’ autumnal sale start today?”
Draco's arms wrapped around Harry's waist and he rested his chin on Harry's shoulder, looking out at the sea. "You like it? It's just us out here for the next three days."
“Teddy, please…” Harry abandoned the whisk in the saucepan and turned around to face the boy. “There’s no way Santa is—”
Harry thought back to the war, to their wedding, to their time at Shell Cottage, and had to agree. They were definitely stronger as a couple.
When Draco eventually put his phone down, it was already far past midnight. He knew he shouldn’t have kept the conversation going for so long, seeing as he was scheduled to open the shop the next morning, but frankly, he couldn’t care less.
Okay, so, speaking of telling the truth, I do have something to tell you. Something that happened on the night of my party that I’m sure you’re going to be most excited about. I did what you told me to do. I kissed a boy.
“Definitely,” Draco said, brushing past Harry and dropping his box on the floor. He stepped out and waited as Harry closed the door behind him and locked it. “So another trip?”
Harry let out a low groan. “Circe, I’d hate that. I had to do it for the Wheezes once when George was out of the country for a couple of weeks. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”
"You are so beautiful," Draco says, his voice soft and reverent, as though he were looking at a panel of artfully stained glass or a sculpture in a gallery. Harry relaxes and reminds himself that this is Draco, his mate, his love. Their bodies are made to be together — he even has the mark on his shoulder to prove it.
In fact, it was all he could think about while he stood there in the queue surrounded by excited kids and stressed-out parents. From his rounded belly and white-blond curly hair to the reading glasses perched on the rosy tip of his pointy nose — Draco truly made the perfect Santa. He’d even managed the intricate clusters of crow’s feet at the corners of his eyes, making him look like a man with a million happy memories and not a worry in the world. The sight made Harry’s heart melt.
Smaug joined him at the table and they ate together, Draco relaying his conundrum to his little friend.
Don’t be silly. If I hadn’t replied, you simply would’ve written to someone else. One of your actual friends, who, I’m sure, would’ve been happy to hear from you. Corresponding with them, you’d be updated on all the latest Slytherin gossip, and you could’ve slandered the rest of us, shared inside jokes, reminisced about good old times, and whatever else it is that you usually do together. I bet they’d be able to cheer you up just fine, making sure to keep you alive and sane till you eventually get out of there by the end of the year.
“He wants to talk to you, Mr Malfoy,” Mrs Champon said on Draco’s right from where she and her husband were eagerly watching the interaction. “Do you know Mr Potter?”
It felt like an eternity, but maybe two weeks without Draco was exactly what Harry needed to return to some state of sanity. So why didn’t it feel like a reprieve? Why did it feel like a punishment?
No, I didn’t kill Snape. Riddle did. He cornered him in the Shrieking Shack on the night of the final battle, ordering his snake to kill him in an attempt to become Master of the Elder Wand. Good thing he never figured out you’d already won its loyalty from Dumbledore before Snape got to the Astronomy Tower that night — if he’d known, he wouldn’t have hesitated to go after you too.
Draco put the last bulb into the box and sealed it, then pushed it aside and sat down next to his neighbour. With an audible sigh, he let his head fall back against the cushion. “Maybe. And maybe he’s horrified at all the lies and what he probably regards as manipulation. If I were him, I’d be questioning everything he thought he’d learned about me in the past few weeks.”
Harry didn’t mind being totally ignored in favour of his godson. This was Teddy’s moment, and quite an important one at that, judging from the way the boy immediately straightened up and cleared his throat.
Draco’s other hand stroked unreadable patterns over Harry’s back, pausing every now and then to squeeze one shoulder here, one arsecheek there, searching its way up into Harry’s unruly locks, running neatly trimmed nails over Harry’s scalp, grabbing a fistful of hair and tugging slightly, making Harry gasp.
A hiss from Orion catches Harry’s attention, prompting him to place his hand on the desk and allow for the snake to slither down his arm onto the polished wood surface. He shrugs off his father’s cloak, his eyes never leaving the mesmerising sight on the other side of the door as he drops the magical fabric in a heap next to Orion, letting him curl into it for warmth. Heart pounding, Harry moves towards the door, pushing it open, breathless.
Victoire dropped a package onto his lap, and he looked up, surprised. “It’s for you. And don’t forget your stocking.”
. He’d had enough torture for one evening. In one graceful swoop, Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists and pinned them to the bed above his head. And fuck if Harry’s eyes didn’t turn a darker shade of desire just then. Draco nearly growled at the sight. “You’re aware I’ve been hard since the moment I lay down on this bed, right?”
Draco minded; of course, he minded. “No, we spend most of our time together at my place. He likes to get off the Reserve.”
Draco grimaces. "Darling, as much as I love the idea of celebrating my birthday, can't we just save it until after our examinations? Please?"
“Thank you,” she said, grabbing the cups and making a move to finally let Draco breathe. He was just about to force his shoulders to relax when she stopped in her tracks and turned back to face him, the clear challenge in her gaze making Draco’s pulse race. She bit her lip, considering, then leaned in. “Just do it, okay? We have this really important anatomy exam next week, and if James flunks it, it’ll all be your fault. He hasn’t been able to concentrate for weeks, thanks to your pretty face.”
Teddy is growing far too quickly for my tastes. It’s only been a little over a month since I last saw him, but seeing how much he’s developed since then… It makes me want to never let him out of my sight again so I don’t miss anything important while looking the other way. He already walks and talks and eats solid food; I swear it’s only a matter of time before he’s ready to take his N.E.W.T.s.
Draco relaxed and nodded, then met Harry’s lips gently to cheers all around. It was quick, and it was chaste, but it seared through Draco’s every cell like lightning.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, his voice understanding. Because, of course, he understood. Probably better than anyone else Draco had ever spoken to about it, which, granted, was few. “What’s your favourite memory of her?”
,” Malfoy announces as they’re finally seated in the British Museum’s cafeteria with two generous portions of Caesar salad on the table between them. “Any idea what it’s about?”
Well, shit. I’m properly cross-eyed now, thanks to you, so I better hit the sack before I actually fall asleep and bang my forehead on the desktop. Please pet your lion for me. (Does he have a name, by the way? For some reason, I want to call him Lucy.)
Harry’s barely out of the shower when the green flames of the Floo roar to life in his living room. He blinks at the unexpected caller as he kneels in front of the hearth, making sure to keep a tight grip on the towel wrapped around his waist.
PPS All right, so, can we both just agree we’ve hurt each other in the past, that we’re both sorry for it, and that we’ve both managed to save each other’s lives after that? Call it even?
It may seem inexplicable, but Dumbledore actually had his reasons to leave me with my aunt and uncle rather than someone else. You see, as long as I stayed in their home, the magical protection my mother’s sacrifice gave me at the time of her death lived on through the blood connection between her and her sister. For it to work, I had to consider their house my home, or Riddle and his followers would be able to find and kill me as soon as I was outside Hogwarts’ protective wards.
“True.” Harry nodded, seemingly pondering Draco’s words while taking another sip of his tea. “What gave you the courage to do it?”
PPS A kazoo? Seriously? You’re playing both the piano and the violin, and that’s all you’d think I could manage? A kazoo? For fuck’s sake, I don’t even…
“Are you sure you won’t need any more Pepper-Up?” Draco frowned, perusing Harry’s potions cabinet. “I brought you three bottles, but…”
Draco let the door close behind him, the mellow harp music fading into nothingness as he stepped outside the wards. The chilly December air sent a shiver through his tired limbs, and his breath produced a billowing cloud before his eyes as he looked around at the quiet London street and heaved a sigh.
Draco pulls Harry's hips to his, lines himself up, and pushes inside his mate for the very first time.
Draco focused his attention on the man before him, his heart skipping a beat as nervously, Harry licked his lips.
“Yes, all right,” he said awkwardly. He liked Sirius. He reminded Draco of his mother in so many ways — his speech pattern, his demeanour, some of the expressions on his face. He was a little wild, though, even if he was thankfully missing Aunt Bella’s sparkle of insanity.
Draco turns, meeting Harry’s gaze with eyes drawn in despair. “Harry? Oh Merlin, I’m sorry.” He jumps down from the ledge, turning to lean against it as he shakes his head and lets it fall into his hands. “I’m so sorry, I— I thought I could… I tried to keep you out of this.”
That was…insightful, actually. Generally, Draco hated to be sad, so he usually pushed the memories aside, afraid of them creeping up on him. But, well, maybe…
Somewhere inside him, there’s a tiny voice insisting this can’t be real, that Draco can’t possibly want him in this way. Of course he can’t, or he would’ve said something sooner. If he’d wanted Harry, he wouldn’t have gone for those other men. He wouldn’t have dated that fucking jerk who eventually decided to break Draco’s heart. If Draco had wanted him…
Malfoy’s eyes narrow and, for a brief moment, Harry wonders if he’s gone too far. With Malfoy, it’s always hard to know where to draw the line.
“Yes,” Draco said. “Preferably a Camembert if you’re partial to tart, green apples like I am. If sweet reds are more your style, then I’d recommend you try it with a creamy Cheddar instead. The salty cheese will bring out the sweetness of the apple like nothing else.”
Harry tore his eyes from Draco’s fly so fast it made him dizzy. Or, maybe it was the sight that met him when he did; those silvery eyes twinkling at him like the finest tinsel in town.
“You…” Draco frowns, searching Harry’s face as he wraps his hand around Harry’s arm. “You sure you want to…?”
Draco raises an eyebrow over silvery eyes twinkling with mischief. He leans in, his warm breath heating Harry's core as much as his words as he whispers in Harry’s ear. “Yes, and if you’re good, we may even find out what else I can do while flying.”
Your voice is so soft, so weak, that I almost miss it at first. And the words make no sense; surely I must’ve heard them wrong. I reach for the remote and mute the melodramatic strings accompanying the credits of the movie we’ve just seen without really watching it, both of us too lost in thought to take any note of its content.
With his hands on Harry’s arse, Draco guides Harry’s undulating hips into a steady rhythm, meeting his every thrust with a relentless thrust of his own.
. Harry’s almost convinced to dive right back in, no questions asked. Who cares about the future anyway? Harry used to think that he did, but the magnetic pull Draco has on him now — and honestly, always has — makes it hard to remember why.
A knock at the door had him pausing. He closed the box and glared at Smaug, then promptly scooped the fox up into his arms to keep him away from the temptation.
Smaug yipped at Draco’s feet, reminding him of the bowl he still held in his hand. “Sorry, darling,” he said to the fox before turning to Harry. “Let me just…”
“Er… Sure,” he said, not that there’d ever been any question about it. Mentally, Harry had been outside ever since Goyle first mentioned the snow.
“No, I mean it. I live for my dragons and my job, but I ignore my family. I spend all my free time drinking and carousing — before you, I mean; I’ve never been a cheater, even if I can’t remember everything — and I’ve been neglecting the things that are important.”
“Maybe next year?” Harry’s mouth offered, without his brain’s permission. “You could come over and do it with us. I bet Teddy would like that.”
apparently consists of two main elements: informative, fact-focused mini-seminars and inspirational practical workshops.
With that thought occupying his mind, it was hardly a surprise when that same ginger hair flashed across the periphery of Draco’s sight. Of course, it would draw his attention; it always did.
You asked me what I want out of life, and while I still have no clue when it comes to my career, there’s one thing I can say for certain. I do want children of my own someday. I can’t wait to cradle a newborn in my arms and feel the rush of emotion as they grip hold of my pinkie with their tiny fist. I can’t wait to see them take their first wobbly steps, to find out the colour of their eyes, hear their first word, and witness their first spark of accidental magic. I can’t wait to take them to Diagon Alley to buy them their first wand, or take them up on their first flight, teaching them how to manoeuvre the broom while experiencing the exhilaration of the first time all over again through their eyes. I can’t wait to see them grow into their own person, taking on the world with all the joy and certainty I wish I also possessed. I’d love them so much, my battered heart wouldn’t be able to contain it all.
“Honestly?” he mumbled to himself, itching to take out his wand and clean. But, first, the cat. “Ps-ps-ps-ps,” he called out, making the same noises that usually got Smaug’s attention. “Here kitty-kitty, where are you? Tch-tch-tch.” He wandered into the kitchenette and found two small bowls sitting on the floor, empty.
They lay like that for quite a while afterwards, with Draco collapsed over him, none of them willing or able to move. Harry could feel Draco’s heartbeat pulse with his own, no longer racing but still beating hard against his ribcage. Draco left sloppy kisses on Harry’s neck and shoulder, anywhere he could reach without having to lift his head. Harry let his fingertips wander absent-mindedly back and forth along Draco’s side and he smiled every time he hit a spot that made Draco twitch under his hand.
He yawned and prepared to stretch, but a man’s low voice talking to Molly in the doorway halted him.
“I— Sorry, I shouldn’t have…” Harry gave him a sheepish smile. “Just, you know, in my head, eleven-year-old you is still a cocky little bastard with too much confidence for his own good. Homesick and insecure doesn’t really compute with that.”
“So beautiful,” he mumbled. “So fucking sexy.” Harry’s praise, delivered with that same awe-struck reverence as before, was almost too much for Draco to bear. And it only got worse when Harry leaned in, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s neck as he whispered close to Draco’s ear. “Do you have any idea what you do to me, Draco? Do you have any idea what the sight of you, naked in my bed, does to me?”
The wind and the rain drowned out any other sounds of the surrounding wildlife, and the lack of people made the usually busy Reserve feel eerily abandoned. On a regular day, it would not only host the dozen dragon-keepers that worked and lived on the premises, but a decent amount of support staff that alternated in through the week, visiting groups of students eager to learn about the dragons, and the random visitors that had to be monitored while on the grounds. It rarely felt this desolate.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” he says in a whisper, and the map comes to life. Pointing his lit wand down towards the map, he traces the lines, tapping the parchment to scroll to the castle grounds. He finds the Owlery and squints in the dim light, looking closer, making out the name he’s followed on the map for years. The name he’s not at all surprised to see.
"Everyone's outside and waiting for you both," Molly said, letting him go and giving Draco a tense but genuine smile. "It's nice to see you, Draco. I'm glad you could come."
— for their every purchase? It was honestly so very impractical.) “I hadn’t realised your grand opening would bring so many extra customers to the rest of us, but it seems as though every witch and wizard in the country have suddenly decided to run their Diagon Alley errands today.”
, and I know it’s only a matter of time before this whole illusion will come crashing down around me.
He knew Harry had cleared his schedule for the day, leaving the practice in Janie’s capable hands, but surely there must be something better for him to do than—
“He’s not here, Bella.” Mother’s voice this time, as calm and level as always. “And even if he were, I wouldn’t let you touch him.”
— awesome person, brilliant collab partner, and general Creator of Gorgeousness. If you haven't discovered their
Draco looked around but there was nobody nearby to help. The other keepers were likely scattered across the Reserve, taking care of their own duties.
Accepting the situation for the time being, Draco shrugged and took the canvas bag of things from the witch. It wasn’t her fault things had got cocked up. Yelling at her would solve nothing.
I can’t deny I never cared much for your father, not that this should come as any surprise for you. But even so, I do get how the changes you’re speaking of must have affected you and your family. You know I saw him that night, right, the day Riddle returned? Safe to say, Riddle was not merciful to him and his buddies for denying their allegiance after his downfall. (Not that Riddle was ever merciful to anyone; it was one of those incriminating weaknesses he never would’ve allowed himself, right up there with love, empathy, and compassion. Oh, the horror of having something beyond power and other people’s fear worth living for!) So, yeah, I can understand if Lucius was terrified of what would happen to him — and in extension, to you and your mother — after Riddle came back. And I can very well picture him tensing up as a result of that. What I can’t imagine, though, no matter how hard I try, is your father as the cringey dad-joke person you describe him as. It just doesn’t compute in my head.
“And me.” The conspiratorial glint in his eye made Draco’s insides tingle. “Still, I’ll make sure to remind him tomorrow.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “No, I— I didn’t mean… Just recognising the desire to be left alone, is all. You know, getting overrun by fans and reporters all the time wasn’t all that amazing either.”
“So, you’re coming to the celebration tomorrow, then?” Ernie asked without lifting his gaze from his own paperwork.
“Charlie Weasley!” Molly scolded and smacked her handkerchief across her son’s head. “Is that any way to talk to your fiancé?”
“Yes, right, I—” Draco cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably in his seat, desperate to change the subject. “Your dragon says hi.” According to Charlie’s family, dragons usually were the best way to distract him.
I’m sitting outside today. Spring is finally here and the bright blue sky of the Great Hall this morning was so perfect I just knew I had to get out of the castle. Sure, writing’s a bit awkward out here without a proper desk, but hopefully, you’ll still be able to read my scrawl. I promise I’ll do my best to keep it legible this time.
He’d become so attached, so quickly. Not just Molly’s gentle mothering and Arthur’s kind, understanding eyes, but Bill’s and Percy’s big-brotherly support, George’s mischievousness and Ginny’s teasing, Fleur’s and Angelina’s comradery with him as the non-Weasley spouse-to-be, Ron and Hermione’s eager acceptance — something he would never admit to having craved since childhood.
The sound of the pouring rain filled the silence between them as they traversed the uneven ground. Draco’s thoughts wandered freely, contemplating Harry and everything Draco was learning about the man he’d become. A few minutes passed before he eventually decided to voice a question that had puzzled him for over a decade.
The beautiful, blonde-haired child ran from the room as fast as she’d entered and seen them, but Sirius simply ran to scoop her up, grinning. “Victoire, I got you!”
… “I think his name is Drago? Or Drake? Well, something like that…” Draco shrugged, flippant. “Anyway — ever met him?”
Harry’s eyes dropped from Draco’s face, landing somewhere around Draco’s middle. Draco froze. Surely, his halfie wasn’t that obvious?
“Hannah!” he called through gritted teeth as he saw the Hufflepuff emerge from the next hospital room. “We need to talk. Now.”
“You’d better,” Draco grumbled. Merlin, he hated feeling this out of sorts. And in front of a stranger, no less. Harry Potter or not, Draco did not do uncertain. Not in front of anyone. Ever. Not even his parents.
“Good.” Harry stood and stretched his legs, scanning the crowd for any familiar faces. Not until Teddy’s impatient bouncing-on-the-spot reverberated up his arm did he realise he’d placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder, apparently unwilling to let him out of reach again.
Thank fuck I have auror training to keep me busy during the week, or I’d go mad in this house. First day was this past Monday, and with all the textbooks and theory, it’s almost like being back at school again, only without the usual crowd being there to make sure I don’t get behind on the homework assignments. Sure, we have physical training too, but far less than I’d expected, and the fieldwork to assist the corps isn’t scheduled until year three, which might as well be aeons away as far as my restless impatience is concerned. According to the syllabus, this entire term will be focusing on reading up on old laws and regulations no more engaging than Professor Binns’ droning lectures on the goblin rebellions. Yay, lucky me!
“No, not yet. But you will,” the man answered cryptically. “One day you and I will know each other better than anyone else.”
The witty remark was on the tip of Draco’s tongue, but he quickly reined it in when he caught sight of Harry’s sheepish squirm. By the faint blush on Harry’s cheeks, the man was already regretting saying anything at all, but were his words really that irrelevant?
“How about an old cousin?” came a voice from the doorway. “People generally complain they can’t get me to shut up, though, so don’t be surprised if you don’t get a word in edgewise.”
Harry hurried down the stairs, thanking his lucky stars he’d managed to get them both dressed before Andromeda’s impromptu Boxing Day check-in. He paused in the sitting room doorway, his heart warmed by the sight of his darling godson sitting cross-legged in front of the hearth, animatedly telling his grandmother about the previous day.
“First a fox, then an owl, and now a comatose man. Next time, I really need to pick a conversation partner who can speak.”
Ever since your last letter, I can’t get the image of you walking around that house all day blabbering to yourself out of my head. The first sign of insanity, all right. Talking to yourself, I mean. And you’re not even halfway through this year yet; Merlin, you’re going to end up a fucking nutter after this, aren’t you? I’m pretty sure I would.
when the chime of an incoming Floo call stopped him. Harry looked relieved by the interruption. “I’ll get that.”
Because behind him stood Harry. Harry, whose solemn, emerald eyes followed Draco’s every move as he walked down the aisle, approaching them. He looked like he wanted to say something, and for a futile moment, Draco wished that he would. Draco knew he wouldn’t, though. Harry had already made that perfectly clear the other day, despite the thoughtful gift. The gift he’d
As it was, though, Harry couldn’t for the life of him figure out what the man was up to, and it was driving him insane.
Speaking of all your old mates, I can’t help wondering… You’re only 18, and yet you talk as if you already knew who the love of your life is. Do you? If so, that’s pretty unusual, isn’t it? I get that you won’t give me a name, but can you at least tell me if I know her? And you can delude yourself however much you want, but I’m not ‘jealous’. I’m just thinking you shouldn’t give up on your dreams so easily. Come on, Malfoy, you’re almost as stubborn as I am. There must be a loophole somewhere in that ancient contract; there always is. And you’re a smart bloke, you can figure it out. Just let me know if there’s anything I can do to help, okay?
“I know.” He sat down in the seat across from her, incredibly proud. It was a big moment for her and the Foundation.
In short, he looked good, and he knew it. It was almost a shame to cover the outfit with the customary black satin dress robes, but he’d take that off quickly enough. He just needed it for his entrance, which he was currently making to the accompaniment of appreciative gazes from all across the room.
What's more, he knows so many places Harry’s only heard of in passing, if at all, and over the next few weeks, he takes Harry to them, letting him experience everything from paintball and arcade games to horse riding and karaoke. They go to a wine and cheese tasting and they visit the Greenwich Observatory. They go on a boat trip down the Thames and even to a pottery class (because ‘every Potter should know how to potter, right Potter?’).
I tense up at the sudden sensation of gentle fingertips stroking up the length of my forearm, playfully caressing my bare skin, eliciting goosebumps I’d rather live without. The man is still murmuring next to me, his mouth now close enough for his hot damp breath to tickle the sensitive skin behind my ear. Before he can get any more ideas, I pull my arm away from his probing touch and reluctantly turn my gaze from the dancefloor.
Ginny grinned and answered in a stage whisper, “Shh, don’t tell anyone, but I think she knows about sex. I have it on good authority that she, gasp, has had sex at least six times before!”
Harry started to babble. “Wait, anyone could know that by just sleeping with Charlie. That doesn’t mean they’re engaged. You know how Charlie…” Harry cut off when Sirius hit him with a Silencing Charm, his mouth still moving.
“Now, stop fishing for compliments, you vain git.” Somehow, I manage a light, casual tone, lightyears from the flustered turmoil currently swirling behind my ribs. Your eyes light up at the familiar teasing banter and I manage a chuckle, albeit a bit strained, desperate to regain at least some of my precarious equilibrium. Heart racing, I tear my eyes from your heady allure and head for the door. “Just get dressed and get out of here, will you? Before the lucky guy thinks you’re standing him up or something.”
They crashed, of course, snow flying everywhere. Honestly, with Potter steering, what else was there to expect? They tumbled down the hill in a tangle of limbs and when they finally came to a standstill several yards from the sledge, Draco found himself with his back against the ground, straddled by a more-than-usual dishevelled Potter. The git was grinning like a loon, his face mere inches away from Draco’s as he held himself up with one hand on either side of Draco’s head. Time stood still as their panted breaths swirled hot between them, as Potter’s every exhale ghosted over Draco’s bare skin, making him shiver.
“Good. Now, give me a twirl, will you?” Harry does what he’s told, feeling Malfoy’s eyes on him like a scorching flame as he does. “That’s it, Potter. No more oversized t-shirts or baggy jeans for you.”
Draco drew the last remnants of composure from his core and steeled himself as he turned to face the man he loved but could never have. When he spoke, his voice was but a whisper, and he doubted the man could even hear him in the commotion surrounding them.
When it's finally over, when he's fully wrung dry and ready to collapse, Draco gently lowers him down onto the bed, arms wrapped around him, keeping them joined for as long as possible.
More customers followed, keeping him on his toes, and it wasn’t until he sank into the cushions of his couch at the end of the day that he remembered he never got to answering that text. Draco reached for his phone and opened their earlier conversation, staring at the last message for several minutes before finally plucking up the courage to send off a belated reply.
Draco’s eyes finally return to Harry’s, accompanied by an encouraging smile. “Don’t worry; you’ll ace it.”
But Teddy was awake, and if Harry didn’t get downstairs soon, they’d risk getting caught in bed together once the boy decided it was time for breakfast. Not that Harry had any intention to keep this latest turn of events a secret from his godson, but he figured he’d rather have that particular conversation when they were all decently dressed.
Actually, I did know about Dumbledore’s offer of protection. I was there. And before you say anything, no, I couldn’t intervene, no matter how much I wanted to. I was stuck under my invisibility cloak, mute and immobilised by a freezing charm, powerless to do anything but witness your exchange and the following course of events. At the time, I was furious with Dumbledore for doing it to me, for not letting him help, but then I didn’t learn about his ulterior motive for that night until almost a year later. It wasn’t until I witnessed Snape’s memories on the night of the final battle that I fully understood why he did it. He wanted me to witness your hesitation. He wanted me to know that you never really wanted to go through with your horrendous task, that you had no choice, that he still believed in your ability to change.
When Harry turned, he found Draco's lips with his own, losing himself in the familiar taste of his mate. It was sweet and heady, making Harry's blood thrum with each passing moment.
Harry turned back around to find Charlie with his eyebrows raised high under his flaming red fringe.
No, he doesn’t mind humouring Draco and his peculiar ideas. Maybe he should. But how could he? Not when Draco’s still feeling raw and vulnerable from everything that’s happened these past few months. Harry knows all about Draco’s pain; has seen it shine through his carefree façade enough times to know how fragile he still is.
“Okay, okay. Relax, will you?” Harry throws a nervous glance around the place, hoping no one’s caught their conversation. “Please, do impart your superior dating knowledge, o esteemed Master.”
You know what? Once you’re out of that place, how about meeting up for a seekers’ game sometime, just you and me and the snitch? For old time’s sake? I’d even let you win if you wanted me to. Anything to get to race you again. I still haven’t flown against anyone who’s been able to push me to my limits the way you always used to do. (And I had the opportunity to play several seekers’ games against Krum over the summer.)
“Blond,” came Sirius’s voice from Draco’s left, but it was quiet, and he wasn’t sure who all could hear it. “Harry likes blonds.”
Draco reached the paddock and slipped through the protection wards that kept the dragons away from the buildings of the Reserve. Blazing heat slammed into his face, scorching his throat and making it all but impossible to breathe. It was an inferno, and Draco suddenly had a flashback of the Room of Hidden Things, of raging Fiendfyre and absolute terror. Heart hammering in his chest, his breathing quickened, desperate for oxygen but too shallow to actually take it in.
And he was. Together, they soared; like two Seekers towards the sky; side by side, reaching for the Snitch; for once working in unison to catch the golden prize in their joined hands.
Harry must have imagined the slight tremble in Malfoy’s voice, because once he completes his rotation, he finds the man as relaxed as ever, a pleased smirk curving his lips.
“Me neither,” Harry said, breathless, looking up at the gorgeous vision before him. Draco looked like an angel; a true Christmas angel descended from the heavens to bring beauty and joy to the world.
When the Emergency Portkey dropped Draco and Charlie into the Creature-Induced Injuries ward, they were immediately surrounded by Healers and Mediwixen who took charge. Charlie was levitated and rushed away, and Draco sat on the floor where he’d landed, stunned.
For some reason, that didn’t help Draco’s nerves any. It was the same thing he’d assured Draco for three days now, and things still weren’t cleared up.
Jess nodded and spelled the door open for them so they could leave, and Draco stepped out into the cool night, Harry at his side.
Draco shakes his head but lowers them down into the trees on the edge of the forest. They're still on the school grounds, but far from view from the castle, so Harry doesn't hesitate to reach up and nuzzle the side of Draco's neck.
Harry swallowed and met Teddy’s gaze, mustering up a smile for the boy as he willed himself to stay upright.
A smile crossed the girl’s face. “Great. I have your fiancé’s belongings. They told me to give them to you so you could take them home? We don’t like keeping valuables around in case anything gets lost.”
I’m concerned by your words, though. He assured me he’d be able to heal you, but now you make it sound like that spell did more damage than he ever let on. Please tell me it didn’t cause any permanent injury to anything vital, or I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to look you in the eye again.
There’s a lot of Slytherin in me — even if self-preservation isn’t nearly my strong suit — and I bet there’s quite a lot of Ravenclaw in you, just as there is in Hermione. And even if you’ll never admit it, I know there’s a fierce lion hiding somewhere deep inside you too. I glimpsed it once, you know, lurking in a thick foliage of deliberate uncertainty. I might never find out what made you do it, but the courage you showed that day when you refused to identify me is one of the main reasons I’m still alive. That we all are.
"All right," Draco finally agrees, and Harry relaxes. "But that means we have to get back to it now." He sits up and reaches into his bag, pulling out his textbook. "Granger, what's the alchemical makeup of…"
The bedroom was about what he was expecting now, the blankets a rumpled mess, clothing everywhere, dishes on the nightstand. Draco suppressed a shiver as he turned around, backing out of the terrible cave where Charlie slept. And then he —
Mother didn’t speak up against her sister often. Not that Draco blamed her; Bellatrix was… intimidating, to say the least, and more than a tad volatile. That Mother defied her now, on his behalf, made Draco’s heart swell, even as fear for his mother’s well-being surged through his veins.
“I always pick up the bill,” Harry objects, disgruntled, causing a spray of breadcrumbs to litter his plate.
Draco lowered his gaze to the coin in his hand, still remembering every word from that night as if it had been only yesterday.
Merlin, just get down off that high horse already, before you fall and hurt yourself and that precious little arse of yours. No, I really don’t need you back in my life pestering me anytime soon. In fact, if you could stay as far away as possible, it’d be great. Just for a century or two? Although, I must say I am a bit curious about testing that fan repellant theory of yours sometime. Your reasoning in this case is interesting and may indeed have its merits.
enthusiastic fans? Did you know I can’t even walk the halls of Hogwarts unaccompanied by several friends without being attacked by reverent pre-teens at every turn? Seriously, Malfoy, I swear, most of the time, I feel like a fucking prey.
“Oh. My. Grind.” Draco’s head rolled back, exposing his long neck like a prey offering himself up to his predator. He may be the one on top, pinning Harry down, but there was no denying his sweet surrender to the man under him. He’d had fantasies about having Harry like this for so long, he almost couldn’t believe this was not just another dream; that Harry was really here, touching him, kissing him, craving him… “I need…”
And as for his unwavering loyalty, I guess you’ll just have to trust me. But if it helps, yes, Dumbledore was indeed dying, infected by an extremely dark curse that had been sapping him for nearly a year. Snape did all he could to try to heal him, but in the end, there was nothing to be done. Cue, Backup Plan Let’s-Secure-Your-Standing-With-the-Noseless-One.
It happened so many times that eventually, Draco could swear he even heard Harry’s voice. Draco knew it wasn’t possible since the man wasn’t on the guest list, so he pushed it out of his mind and continued the conversation with the couple in front of him.
Harry’s faint smile tugged at Draco’s heartstrings. “I’m really glad you’re not going to be alone anymore.”
“As long as you don’t mind,” Harry says, knowing full well what his suggestion implies; that he’s ready to go public with their relationship — a relationship that has never really existed…
Frankly, I don’t know why I haven’t told anyone about you yet. When your first letter arrived, we were all in the middle of the pre-term chaos and I figured I could always tell them about it later. I never would’ve thought we’d keep writing to each other like this, months later, but now that we do… Circe, I can only imagine how pissed off they’re going to be once they find out I’ve been keeping this from them for so long. I know I’ll have to say something eventually, but since I still have no idea how best to tell them, I’m afraid you’ll have to remain ‘my dirty little secret’ for a while longer, if you don’t mind.
“Yes, of course you are.” Draco’s smile is kind and warm. Harry wants to melt under it. “You’re kind and caring, funny and gorgeous—”
a ridiculous name. If you really want to know, I got it from your middle name… So no, not intended as feminine at all. I don’t doubt you’re a man, Malfoy, I really don’t. And if it irks you so much, feel free to go ahead and name my inner snake at any time. I’m curious to know what you’ll come up with.
“Hey, take it easy.” Harry chuckled, apologising to an observant old lady who’d been kind enough to step aside to let Teddy cross her path. “We’re almost there, cutie cub. I’m sure Santa will have time for everyone.”
He entered the kitchen, but the room was silent, Molly evidently having gone back upstairs. He jotted down a quick letter of thanks to her and promised to see her later at St Mungo’s, then walked to the small sitting room with the Floo. He reached for the Floo powder, but the discreet sound of a throat clearing behind him made him freeze.
If this had been any other day, Draco would have been sitting here relaxed and content, unwinding with a book and his usual evening cup of tea. That was what he always did at this time of day, a constant part of his comforting evening routine.
Harry leaned to the side, squinting at the coin as he held it up in the light from the nearby reading lamp. “It’s—” Harry blinked, confused, then, “It’s… me,” he breathed. “But… Fuck, Draco. What the…?”
He lay in the centre of his large bed, the soft mattress cradling his body as he stared at the ceiling, listening to the silence.
“And risk humiliating myself in front of my sworn enemy?” Draco shakes his head and lets out a self-deprecating chuckle. “No, Harry. I may not always have made the right decisions, but I’m not
With his heart racing in his chest, Harry rushed after him, not slowing down until he was back at Teddy’s side.
She looked back at Draco, watching him admire her, and her smile softened from predatory to genuine. “No, sweetheart, I don’t need anything. Only for you to have a lovely evening and that the new year will hopefully bring you someone you can finally be happy with.”
“I love you, Draco. I want to be your family. I want to see the world with you, to grow old with you. I want to go to Florence with you and let you show me all the happiness you’ve experienced there. I want to make you happy.”
“What the fuck are you doing? Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy? How did you even get there so fast?”
“Harry, please, and yes, I am. The last haircut I got was before Hogwarts, and it grew back overnight.”
