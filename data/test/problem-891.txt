Harry looked up from his spot on the floor. He looked into Hermione's concerned and... knowing eyes. Wait. Knowing. "Umm... if I tell you please don't judge me..." Harry said softly while rumbling the back of his neck.
“I guess that’s your submissive side craving for attention of a dominant”
Harry was nudged out of his thoughts when Pansy slightly dug her elbow into Harry’s side. He was disoriented for a moment before he realized that the food had arrived.
Harry had been quiet ever since they had gotten back in their rooms, his silence was getting Draco a little worried.
Harry snuggled back into the warmth of Draco’s chest. Wrapping his arms around Dracos torso, making sure to wedge himself deeper in the dominant’s hold. It was starting to get colder, and Harry never really liked the cold after the Dursley’s, so it was nice to be able to snuggle up to a body so warm he could act like a heater.
“What was that for, not that I’m complaining.”
Harry leaned up and kissed Draco’s cheek to calm him down, he also released a few calming pheromones for extra measure. It worked because a few moments later the blonde calmed down and resumed his reading. Still, however, mumbling under his breath ways he would torture and eventually kill the stupid weasel if ever even look in Harry’s direction.
Harry let out a relieved sigh and turned slightly avoiding the stiffness in his shoulders. Harry then cracks open his eyes and whispers "Happy Birthday Harry" Then the pain comes back tenfold and Harry passes out, a heap of appendages, clothes and hair.
“Thank god you're okay. We were about to send out the search team to see if everyone was okay.” Elder Hanna said, stepping forward to check Harry for injuries.
"That you kiss me right now" Harry said smiling "OH and you buy me LOTS of chocolate im talking mountains!" Draco chuckled
His smile
“Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
These little run-ins with Harry kept happening, and everytime Draco would catch eye of Harry, he would always see how beautiful he was. But not once has Draco ever seen his eyes since last term, and Draco was really getting worried that something was wrong. He would always tell his concerns to Pansy and he knew that Pansy and Hermione were really good friends. He also guessed that they had started "shipping" them, and honestly didn't mind. He wanted to be with Harry as a friend or more.
30 more seconds
Harry waited on Platform 9 3/4 , for once he was relatively early. There was about 30 minutes before the train would come into the station. There were a few families here already, Harry thought he saw Susan Bones and her aunt earlier before he got on the platform. Harry was nervous, the Goblins confirmed that he was indeed a Veela.
Harry tended to his injuries as best he could using scraps of cloth from his old t-shirts to wrap his more severe wounds. Before crawling onto the bed and curling up in a tight ball to preserve body heat as there was no blanket. Harry then fell into a very uneasy sleep. Dreaming of someone (or people) who would care for him, protect him.

“Are you sure you aren’t hungry?”
Harry thought about it for a few more seconds. "Sure, anything but 'pet' though."
Harry looked up from the book, somewhere while reading he had transitioned to lying on his stomach while toying with his hair. After reading the passage he was certain that he was in fact a Veela, and not just a Veela, but a male submissive Veela. After the initial shock, Harry went over to his mirror again and took in his appearance as well as reflecting on his day. Harry realised that like the book said he had been acting extremely more emotional than he usually was. He noticed that he spent a lot more time trying to hide his tears from his uncle… and he was significantly more scared of his uncle… yep he decided i’m definitely a submissive Veela.
“You can't see it?” Theo said his tone laced with so much sarcasm. “There is that one little hair right there” He pointed at Blaise. “You can’t see it but it’s out of place.”
Draco hated the Dursleys.
“OK I get the point.” Harry could feel his face burning up, like he could roast chicken on his face.
“What time is it?”
Harry was shaken out of his thoughts when someone tapped on his shoulder, Harry jumped slightly looking up to see Luna standing beside him. With Neville just behind her. He grinned at her and Neville as he stood up to hug them.
"BOY, you freak what did you do!" Vernon shouted at Harry after his uncle scared him into pouring soup into his lap. "You ungrateful little BRAT! You FREAK, ruining our dinner! We give you a roof over your head! feed you! and clothe you! And this is how you repay us! Pouring food onto us! Come on Petunia, dudders, let's go get some burgers, YOU clean up this mess that you've made! This kitchen better is spotless when I get back! And don't think this is the last of your punishment boy!" Uncle Vernon grabbed the keys then rushed Petunia and Dudley out of the door before slamming it shut then getting into the car to get some take out for dinner.

Except Pansy and Blaise saw it.
1 day to the hunt
“Oh, and Harry I saw you staring at Draco” Pansy smirked when Harry’s head snapped her direction, his face a deep red.
Draco chuckled pulling Harry impossibly closer. “I love you too Harry, more than you could possibly imagine”
Harry imagining a life with a partner
Harry finished the dishes, then went upstairs to his cousin's second bedroom. He went inside then picked up his textbooks, he was able to sneak them out of the cupboard the other week so he could actually prepare for his classes. It wasn't that Harry wasn't smart. He probably could answer the OWLs and get EE, or an O in some subjects. It really wasn't his fault. He was so used to staying in the background and purposefully failing classes, that he carries that habit to Hogwarts. He was never able to shake it. Then when he met Hermione he didn't want to upset her by beating her grades, or be accused of cheating. He just made sure to know the material and then do his best during the test. He actually wasn't that bad in potions either, if Snape didn't intimidate him or belittle him, shocking him to adding extra ingredients and then messing up his potions he would be good, it would be even better if the Slitherins stopped throwing stuff into his cauldron constantly. He was pretty good with the theory, but he couldn't work with all the distractions and people tampering with it, so he was never able to practice it.
“Oi, urm… Harry what was that? You just froze for a moment there? What was that about?” Neville asked, concerned lacing his voice.
“Need help?”
Outside the alcove there were 4 very supportive friends, 2 girls squealing their brains out and the other 2 watching the scene go on inside the alcove. Squeals of Finally and about time had been heard muttered throughout the great hall as Draco and Harry sat beside each other the next day for breakfast. Even professor Snape looked "soft" as he watched Harry and Draco exchange a kiss before his class, not that anyone would say it in fear of their house being rid of 100000 points. And Draco and Harry were as happy as ever, when they were together they were always smiling, and it wasn't a surprise when Draco proposed to Harry in the end of their seventh year after 2 years and ½ of dating, or when they had the biggest wedding of the century 3 months after school ended, or how 8 months later, Harry gave birth to their 1st child, and then two years later when he gave birth to a pair of twins, a boy and a girl. And Draco and Harry were so happy together even though some people started to hate Harry because of this and Harry would sometimes have bouts of depression, Draco was always there to get him out and back on his feet.
“Yes I am aware, it's not that bad is it?”
Harry watched the dominants demonstrate their strength, their speed and their wings. Spreading their wings as far as they could go. Carrying the tables outside so they could enjoy nature. Chasing after other dominants.
you. I think I'm ready.”
“No. I guess not.” Harry collected the food from Draco and dug in. “Mhhhh, this is so good” Harry moaned at the taste of the raw meat. He was hungry since he hadn’t eaten anything since the previous day. Harry finished his plate in less than 5 minutes. He was still hungry but he didn’t want to get any more food, in case it disturbed Draco that he wanted more. He leaned into Draco’s side and watched as he ate his food, eventually getting a second serving, and a third.
Still not Beta'd -_- sorry for horrible grammar and spelling....
"Sorry I forgot my jumper" Draco said, not looking very apologetic. Smirk plastered on his lips.
“Draco what do you know about my childhood?”
"You ready?"
“I know I just want you to know everything but it hurts to open up all those wounds.”
“We were angry that he attacked you. We needed no other reason” Neville said. Harry was surprised that Neville and Luna were even capable of doing something like this.
-Tina
“Of course baby, take your time baby. I’ll be right here, whenever you're ready”
Draco nodded, "Of course"
“Yes,” Harry said giggling, heaving in breaths trying to get air back into his lungs.
He was like his plants, they were dependent on him, and he wished he could just let go and depend on someone to take care of him, instead of him taking care of himself. He was tired of it, he just wanted to let go and be happy. Not that he thought he deserved it, being the freak he was.
Pansy led Harry to the table with less people, Harry guessed it was the table for the submissives. He talked with a few of the submissive there but mostly kept to himself and Pansy. He wasn’t in the mood for talking with other people to caught up in his excitement.
“Oh and Hermione dumped him,” Theo said
My school work is starting to pile up so updates might be more spread out.  I'll try to make them longer, but idk
“Was that all love?”
Harry looked up and noticed a pair of beautiful Grey/blue eyes staring at him with such... adoration and love. His breath hitched, he could feel his face heat ups, his heart speed-up, his stomach fill with so many butterflies that his stomach started to churn, and Harry started to feel dizzy. But despite all that he continued to stare at the normally icy grey eyes that now showed a sheen of heat. Eventually he ducked his head and excused himself quietly, as soon as he left the library he found the closest alcove and sunk to his knees.
He felt like he had the world on his shoulders and he didn't know not to deal with all of it. Things that he shouldn't even have to deal with. That no child should have to deal with. Yet there he was. Every year he kept reinforcing his different masks depending on what the Wizarding World wanted him to be, his hero mask he started to call it.
I just want to say thank you for all the kudos and comments!
“Hmmm, ya your right. Though your Veela could be blocking them because they know you have me now” Draco gave a smug smirk, reaching for Harry’s hand and lacing their fingers. “Or they could have worn off”
“PANSY! STOP.” Harry said. Hiding his blushing face in Draco’s shoulder. “How was your date by the way”
with Malfoy, always watching him and hoping that Malfoy would talk to him.  Harry would try to be more civil towards him for the rest of the term.  But Harry was pretty sure that Dra-Malfoy would still treat him the same…
“-Great Hall were those the suppressant to” She said raising her eyebrow, smirking smugly.
Just like the first time Draco opened his arms and Harry crawled in, snuggling close.
A/N sorry for the cliffhanger but I gotta keep you guys interested in the fic :)
He stared down at his Harry and slowly kissed him for the first time. Just a small peck of lips. But that small brush of lips caused an explosion of warmth all around his body, and Draco knew he would NEVER let this submissive go, and kill anyone who tried to take him. Harry was his, there was no doubt about that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No other dominant is going to get him.”
Harry wondered as he admired his new look. Experimenting with his wings and new look for a few minutes he found out that he could fold his wings into his back although it was uncomfortable for a minute or 2. He was broken from his musing by 2 noises; his uncle getting ready for the day and the tapping of 2 owls on the windowpane.
“Okay then, whenever you're ready”
“My instincts aren’t acting up”
“Just because Draco stopped Gelling his hair back does not mean I am worse.”
Draco stepped in front of Harry warning her not to come closer. He snarled at her wrapping a wing around his sub. She could be a threat, no way was he letting her near.
Draco forced himself to look away from Harry and focused on Blaise. “Hmm, Pardon, just a little distracted.”
It tasted exquisite, like a berry dipped in chocolate. He licked the skin again, this time paying attention to how it affected the little sub under him. He heard his breathing hitch before he gave out a soft moan, which Draco quickly followed by another lick. He let himself get lost in Harry’s taste, His scent, the way he sounded. Before Draco rubbed his scent gland to Harry’s making sure that their scents mixed. He then lowered his nose to the scent gland, and growled happily when he could scent himself on Harry.
"Let's just say that...my relatives didn't really like me and made sure to make my life horrible from the moment they met me, from daily chores, and by that I mean all the housework, to starvation." Harry said sighing, looking at Draco cautiously, at first as Draco was processing it he had a blank face, then a look of pure anger flashed across his face before it turned to Horror.
The dominant tensed. Draco could tell the dominant wanted to pounce. The councillors got to him first. Harry moved on, as if nothing just happened. It was probably the inducers making him oblivious to the near tackle. Fortunately Draco was there to pounce on the dominant if the guards did not get there first, Draco seemed to forget that there were borders protecting Harry from that.
Once again Harry slowly drifted off to sleep. Only this time he was surrounded by warmth and comfort.
“I’ve wanted you to claim me for a while,” Harry said, gathering some of his ‘Gryffindor courage’.
Harry woke up in the middle of the night. It was his second time sleeping with Draco. However, last time his feelings were clouded by the need for a mate. This time however it was his first time sleeping with Draco without the inducers. It was weird and awkward. He could feel Draco's heat on the other side of the bed. Draco's scent inviting him closer to Draco. But instead of wiggling closer Harry just turned to observe Draco.
He went up the stairs into his bedroom and stared out the window until he saw the Dursely's pull up in the driveway. He mentally prepared himself for the beating he was sure to receive from his uncle.
"Draco?" Harry asked when Draco had turned the page. Draco turned to smile at him.
“Just. If you're hungry we can always call a house elf. I don't want my submissive going hungry. Harry just nodded, even though he wasn’t going to do so. He needed to keep his weight because what if he just gained so much weight Draco would leave him. Totally implausible but this was one of the many thoughts running through Harry’s head until he was shaken out of his  thoughts by another person.
(See the end of the chapter for
After reading that Harry was actually quite excited for his 1st mate meeting that was going to be held in November. He had gotten the letter from the council the day prior informing him of the date and the location. Fortunately for Harry the hunt was going to be held at hogwarts.
The pair had also found out that they both enjoyed a lot of physical attention. Especially Harry since he didn’t have that kind of affection, or any affection growing up. Along with that, neither of them minded PDA, and every time they went out of their rooms they were always touching whether it was holding each other's hands, cuddling, or kissing.
Draco took a deep breath "Well... I was Jealous, that Ron got to be your friend or even close to you..." Harry looked sad for a moment before he launched himself at Draco and hugged his neck.
“I’m finished”
Harry just nodded, not really knowing how to respond
“No…”
He watched as Harry lounged with Pansy and Neville by the fire, with his wings out. Wings that he wanted to groom, he wanted to pet and stroke. Hair that he wanted to run his hands through. Harry looked so relaxed, much different from the stiff and rigid body that Draco was used too.
“Oh, and Harry I saw you staring at Draco” Pansy smirked when Harry’s head snapped her direction, Harry choked on the bite of tart. Coughing it into a napkin.
“What do you mean? Don’t we all have the same instincts?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He was always near Pansy during the introductions. A lot of the dominants were paying attention to him. He didn’t understand at first until Pansy told him how rare male submissives were and these dominants were probably gay.
“Huh? I'm Sorry I didn't catch that maybe a bit louder” Harry could clearly hear the amusement in her voice, not even needing to look at her face to know that she had a shit eating grin plasterd on her face.
Okay... so I know that the creature that Draco and Harry are, are Veela. But like I edited "Veela" so it's not like the traditional Veela. Just keep that in mind... if you don't want to read that, then don't read it.
Harry nodded. Draco could sense how nervous he was. The recent scuffle with Ron had brought back flashbacks on the Dursley’s to Harry, and he thought it would be better if he talked to Draco about it.
“WHAT?” Pansy spluttered. “I don't know what you're talking about” She looked away to get some bacon and steak on her plate.
Draco finished with his hair. He glanced over to see Theo had done but blaise-
“A lot”
Draco and Harry moved all their things into their joined room in the “couples” hallway. The couple's common room was very similar to the submissives common. But there were a lot more loveseats and secluded corners. It was very cozy and the color scheme was a nice grey, cream, black. In the corner, there was a basket of nice fluffy throw blankets and another filled with soft pillows. It was a very comfy area to just cuddle and hang around. It was still early in the morning so there weren't many people out in the common room.
“Theodore Knott, and Evan Hardwood.”
“Is that all you're going to eat? Even with the stimulants?”
“Well, I guess I have been a bit obvious.”
Feeling dejected, Harry got one of the chocolate frogs from his stash and started eating it starting with the limbs, then the head, until he finally ate the body. Humming content Harry changed into his school robes and then settled down once more, but instead reading a romance book that he was able to buy the book when he was out in diagon alley buying his school stuff. Harry lounged on the couch, his body splayed on the seat as his eyes skimmed the pages. Gasping and making an odd comment here and there, but other than that it was a very peaceful day on the Hogwarts express.
By morning Harry was tucked into Draco’s side.
still not beta'd
Pansy just smirked, eyes glinting with mischief storing away that bit of information.
“Oh Harry, I'm so sorry you were treated like that” Draco cuddled Harry to his chest Harry cried softly, Harry enjoyed the love that Harry showed him and at some point started crying. And when he did start crying Draco comforted him, making Harry want to cry even more because it was the first time in his whole life that he could remember where Harry had felt loved, well not the first time there had been plenty before, but that moment would forever stand out in his mind for the rest of his life.
“You're going to be ok Harry, and in the rare case where you are not with Draco and your dominant hurts you I will gut them, then gut Draco. AND if none of the dominants see how perfect mate potential you are it's their loss.” She had a sadistic grin on her face that made Harry shiver, he didn't want to be on the receiving end of that smirk.
Harry was in with the dominants for a full day. The last time it had taken this long it was because all the dominants had been knocked out by the submissive, that was over a decade ago. All other hunts had been within 6 hours. The council was starting to get worried about how long they were staying in there, wondering if the submissive had just found a good hiding spot or if all the dominants were dead.
“Everyone is safe right?” Elder Jacob said as Draco downed half the potion before handing it to Harry for him to finish.
He had scars to prove it. Carvings all over his body, courtesy of his uncle, saying exactly what he was, an ungrateful freak who deserved nothing. He hid it well. So many glamorous and lies. Though he was sure his friends knew of his abuse. I mean Ron saved him from his room in the summer of 1st year, when there were bars on his window. What kind of person doesn't question why you have bars on your windows! They either saw it and chose to ignore it or didn't think anything of it. It hurt either way, but he got over it, they were only kids after all, and he really didn't give them any reason to suspect otherwise.
Then when Harry got sorted in Gryffindor he made up his mind that he wouldn't be able to have a second chance, so once again he resorted to being mean. Just to have those amazing emerald green eyes at him, at the time that was enough but, last year when Draco had been taunting Harry and he looked straight at him with such hate in his glowing eyes. Draco couldn't stand it anymore, he couldn't deny it anymore, he was obsessed and slowly falling in love with Harry, and that was why he decided he would be nicer. He wanted those eyes to look at him full of admiration and love not with hatred and hurt, it hurt him too much knowing that it was him who took some responsibility for those emotions.
“How can you be so calm about this?”
Draco smiled at the nickname and grabbed his bag slinging it around his shoulder before he walked back to Harry and grabbed his hand, and they moved to go to the dining hall with the rest of the school for lunch.
"Truth"
Umm... I don't really have a posting schedule, because that pressures me then I end up writing nothing at all, just please be patient with me, please. Also, I am still working on my grammar, etc, this is also not Beta'ed so there might be some mistakes that I may or may not have slipped over, sorry.
"YES! I KNEW THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM!" Pansy said, she shot up then started pacing "I've always thought that Draco must have had a thing for Potter, always 'Potter this, and Potter that, and Potter with his Perfect smile and a Perfect eyes.' I should have caught up sooner, Bloody Hell. Especially recently I am 1 million percent sure Draco so has a thing for Potter! I mean he has been rather soft recently! Even nice to other Lions! Bloody hell! I am so shipping them!" Pansy then gasped then she stared at Hermione and squealed "WE NEED A SHIP NAME!!!"
Harry snapped his head to look at her startled out of his head. “Yeah, I’m good. Why what’s wrong?”
"Of course not Harry, not even if you were to confess that your dating Snape, um... scratch that please don't tell me your dating snape mate." Ron spoke up for the first time during their confrontation.
“Not this one.”
This is kind of a filler, but i kinda like it. Merry christmas yall
Harry nodded resting his head on Draco's chest breathing in his scent.
Draco settled, quickly scanning the dominants table as well as the head table before moving to the submissives table. No males, Draco sighed, still scanning the submissives none of them piqued his interest though.
Sorry this is short... but i decided that my chapters are gonna at least be around 1k-3k words. Hope you guys dont mind
“I'm so sorry you had to go through that Harry. I won’t ever let them get to you, or touch you or hurt you for as long as I am living.”
Draco was exhausted; he was tired of seeing all the dominants floundering around Harry. Draco knew that there were only 3 dominants that Harry actually took notice of, himself included. But it still didn’t settle his nerves.
I think I'll start the Hunt after this.
“ Yes, you were still the bi- HAHAH- Dr… DRACO. Hahah. Stop PLEASE, oKay Okay.”
"Hey, hey, it's ok, it's all in the past now. I forgive you" punctuating each sentence with a kiss. After he was done talking he was as red as a tomato.
Harry was starting to feel hungry. It was a familiar feeling, he didn't eat much but he still felt hungry. So Harry sat up leaning his head on Draco's shoulder, waiting for Draco to turn the page.
Sorry for not updating in a while. Also yes I am aware that this is a filler I just needed to write something to get me inspired. Hope you liked this anyway :PP
“How much I've wanted to claim you since that day on the train when I first scented you. So powerful, so pure, so perfect.” Draco said, smiling softly. Harry blushed, burying his head in Draco’s shoulder trying to cover his blushing face.
He was in position, and pounced on the deer, letting his Veela take over for the meal. He skinned the deer before eating the animal raw. The hot red blood made the animal warm as he took bite after bite. The taste of the warm blood flooding his mouth, excess dripping down his chin. He moaned. The meat was so tender, so soft, so juicy, Harry relished the taste of the deer's blood, the thick, warm liquid made him feel warm inside as it slowly filled him up.
“You are too cute if you think that is scary.” Pansy said, eyes shining.
They couldn’t even say where they were. Ron was probably just over exaggerating. They were most likely having fun without him, stupid Potter, freal, ugly, brat… Why would they want the freak...
“No, I knew you would help me” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s hand. Draco smiled back at Harry.
“I love you Draco”
"Yes" Harry said turning his head to look at Draco
The Dursley's finished their breakfast soon after and Harry cleaned up the kitchen. After his uncle left for work and Dudley went back upstairs to play with his video game console, his Aunt gave him his list of chores he had to complete before his uncle got back from work.
Draco must have stared for hours, but it was merely minutes, his mind was screaming at him to pounce on the submissive and
Draco on the other hand was confident, he was only going for one submissive in this hunt. It was obvious, every dominant in the chase knew it. A lot of them were going for the same submissive, determined to at least get a chance.
The tents were set up in a clearing in the forest and it was a Hogsmeade weekend so most of the students would be in Hogsmeade for welcoming ceremonies. The Veela students that were participating in the hunt were on their way to the tents, the adult Veela’s who were participating should already be in the tent waiting for the festivities to start.
“But aren’t we too young to be having… sex… and stuff”
Harry had a dopey grin on his face. His Dominant was Draco Malfoy. Harry was oh so very happy about that, and judging from the look on his face, it didn’t look like Draco minded either.
“Ahh, would you look at that? Isn’t that cute Zabini.” Draco smirked as his friend’s head snapped in his direction. Harry giggled as Pansy snuggled in closer, moving closer to his dominant. Draco wrapped an arm around Harry before glancing back at the pair, smirking. Harry leaned up to whisper in Draco’s ear.
“That would be the stimulant Harry, bringing out your submissive instincts, It’s different for every sub.”
“Then they will be idiots. End of discussion, now if you want to be there we best be going, and none of this… stuff. Go back to excited Harry.” Pansy said, nudging Harry towards the door. “And If it helps I already know a few dominants who are going to be pining for you just you wait.”
“If you're not ready I'm 100% sure that Draco would understand, he won't pressure you into anything you know, under all that ice is a rather warm soul.”
also its almost Christmas!! :)
“I love you too Harry” Draco smiled. “Harry, you do realize when I give you the mating mark you’ll start your cycle right?”
"Yes, I would love to be your Boyfriend Dray" Harry said smiling his face flushing a cherry color.
He studied the eyes, they had so much depth, so much emotion, warmth in them Draco was swimming. The rest of the world faded. It was just him, Harry and that sweet smell. He took in Harry’s slender body, curves accentuated with his robe. They were traditional submissive robes. Draco was wearing something similar, while Harry showed off his curves, Draco’s displayed his angular shape and strong muscles.
“Yah… we are such big idiots. I’ve liked him since first year as well, but I only noticed last year during the Yule Ball.”
Draco read the book to Harry as they relaxed on the surprisingly comfortable bed of the hospital wing.
And just like the first time Draco opened up to Draco about the cupboard, the beatings and the emotional pain he went through when he was with the Dursleys. The entire time Draco held Harry close to his chest as he processed the information Harry was given him. The worst of it was that unlike the last time Harry was so calm, not shedding a single tear. This just made Draco even angrier.
"Well, you are wrong"
"Yah, why did anything else happen?" Pansy asked, slipping out of the way she would act around non-snakes, since she knew she could trust Hermione she was as cunning as a Slytherin that Pansy sometimes wonders how she is not in Slytherin. Pansy was starting to get excited because this had to be good if Hermione was calling in early.
“Ok, OK, I get it, You are getting better at that. But really Harry” Pansy said, raising her eyebrow. “ ‘I may have a tiny crush on Draco’ ”  She said, doing a horrible impression of Harry’s voice. “Tiny. Are you sure tiny.”
-End of Abuse-
change of character. Sighing Harry decided that he would tell Hermione, the worst that could happen was that she and Ron would flip out, right?
Anyway thnx so much guys for the support :)
I mean he did that before, but this one was on an entire new level. But, at the same time she had to admit, as much as Harry would avoid Draco, she could also see the small glances she sent Draco's direction.
“Oh it's bad, not horrible, but it's bad. Don’t worry I’ll be there to help you”
Harry crouched in the garden, where he was weeding the flower bed for his aunt Petunia. It was July 30th, the day before Harry turned 15. He sat there using the hand shovel to soften the dirt before he pulled the weed out, making sure to get the whole plant including the root. Then he places all the weeds in one pile. Harry barely acknowledged what he was doing, he was on autopilot. Daydreaming of a person, or persons who would love him and care for him, and see him. Not as the Boy who Lived, but as Harry, just Harry. He had done so much Gardening in the past that he could do this task with his eyes closed.
“Good luck there. There are a lot of dominants who want him, look around.”
“So… you don’t need my help,” Draco said walking past Harry towards their room. Trunk floating above him. “You are a wizard you know”
5... The burst of magic makes the air tight, harder for Harry to take in the oxygen
But if Draco was being honest with himself he had his sights set on a certain Gryffindor half-blood. Regardless of whether or not he was a Veela, he was only going through these mate meetings because they were mandatory… and so that he could prove to his dad that none of the girls were good matches for him. He was just very glad that his parents were supportive of his sexuality, as well as the fact he might not marry someone of creature blood… much more one that is not a pureblood.
"YES! I knew it!" Hermione shrieked , "I can finally tell Pansy... ohh this is going to be so much fun" Hermione smirked with a mischievous glint in her eye. Harry nodded at her then turned to look at Ron who, to his surprise looked amused.
. As his mate. It was surreal. Harry was waiting to wake up to find himself back in his cupboard. It never came.
Draco was hopeful, all he needed to do was chase Harry in the hunt, if he had to he would kill all other dominants who wanted to get Harry.
Needing to make sure this dominant was worthy, he had passed the first task of actually catching him. Now to see if he was strong enough. He finally was able to flip them, the blonde Veela was strong, Harry was pleased. He started to claw at the dominant. He wasn’t able to even get one before both his arms were caught and he was flipped again. But this time his eyes were locked with piercing story grey ones. Harry was lost in them. This dominant was worthy, he had earned that title. And Harry willingly submitted to this dominant. Baring his neck for the dominant to scent him.
Things were finally starting to look up for Harry. After the incident with Weasley, as well as many more with other submissives and dominants, the teacher’s saw it fit to have a ‘short’ seminar on magical beings.
After all the food and drinks had been finished Dumbledore stood up again to make a speech.
“I don't need anything as long as you’re with me”
“That was nothing… I just smelled something good…” Harry said before relaxing back into his seat. Neville saw that Harry was getting uncomfortable so he dropped the subject and started talking to Luna about whackspurts… whatever those were.
“Hmm, Sorry Harry dear I didn’t catch that.” She smirked
“Draco! Don’t do that!” Harry said bumping Draco’s arm playfully.
While there were about a dozen dominants flaunting themselves at him, only 4 scents piqued his interest, and only 3 of the dominants pleased his Veela. Harry watched them with a keen eye, his Veela shining through in picking the right mate. First impressions were very important and Harry’s Veela wanted the best.
-Abuse Starts-
Draco growled again, the dominant didn’t back down. So while the dominant was still out of breath. Draco flipped the dominant over so he was on the floor. He quickly kicked the dominant in the face before moving on, he had wasted enough time on this stupid dominant. The submissive was coming closer to him. The dominants were still far away; this was his chance.
“Oh, I don’t doubt that.” Pansy sighed. “Why are you so excited anyway?”
Sleeping on the
He heard the click of his lock indicating that he should probably leave his room before he got dragged out and eventually hit. Harry stood up not minding that he had a headache or that he had many bruised bones and protesting muscles. He had gotten all too used to the pain that if he didn't focus on it, it would just fade into the haze of his summer.
Harry was gazing out his window the 2 days before his birthday. He was trying not to move so that his back -which had just been whipped yesterday- had just started scabbing. Harry was just wondering if he would ever get out, if he could ever get out.
Draco glanced at Harry, his mate was perfect. So beautiful, Draco felt himself melt whenever those emerald eyes were fixed on his own. His mate was glowing with the light of the sun going down. He was curled up on the armchair facing the balcony, while Draco was on the couch across pretending to read his book, while instead observing his mate slowly drift off to sleep.
"Okay love" Draco said, Harry could picture the smile plastered on the blondes lips as he spoke.
It was perfect.
“Just a crush. HA that would be sneaking glances at him. Harry dear you were staring for 10 minutes before I nudged you out of your little day dream. I’d say you have a rather large crush on a certain blonde Slytherin.”
Harry was mesmerized with how beautiful Draco looked at this time of the morning. The light was shining, making his hair look like it was spun of gold, and his skin looked like he was glowing.  He looked like a Greek god with his sharp aristocratic features and toned upper body. Harry turned more to observe
After 30 minutes of reading through descriptions of Inheritances such as: Incubus, Drakens, Pixie, Fae, etc and their dark counterparts. He stumbled upon Veelas and their variations.
“The book said that the hunt starts with the most powerful submissive. Since this isn’t the case how are we going to do this?”
“To provide for you” Draco turned to meet Harry’s eyes, smiling softly. Harry blushed a lovely pink.
Harry left the room and went down the stairs to get a start on breakfast before Dudley woke up, and complained. He made bacon, eggs, pancakes, and sausages flawlessly (to any normal person, but to Harry and the Dursleys it wasn't good enough). Not even trying to eat some, because he knew how fat he was, how freakish and ungrateful (what could he say after years of being told the same thing over and over again he eventually started believing it, despite knowing that it was wrong). No he didn't deserve to eat, no matter how hungry he was. He served breakfast while standing in the corner waiting to collect the dishes and get started with his long list of chores already on the counter.
Draco woke up suddenly, something was different. He was still groggy so he couldn’t decipher what. But something was definitely different. Assuming it was just another dominant searching for the submissive. Until he smelled it. It was so familiar, so sweet, so pure. It was the submissive.
Everyday he spent at the dursleys the more depressed and suicidal he got. The more his self-esteem slipped through his fingers as he was pushed aside and ignored not only during the summer but during most of his time at Hogwarts as well, and it didn't help that most of the time that he got attention he was either being insulted or called attention seeking brat. But what would you expect from a person who has never been shown any attention or affection throughout his life.
It wasn't that Draco had been mean to Harry, no in fact he was actually rather nice, but you see, Harry has had a crush on Draco since his 4th year. Well... he's always had a crush on Draco he's just never realized it till his 4th year, during the Yule Ball, and he caught himself wishing it was him Draco was twirling around the great hall and not Pansy. He was positive that Draco wasn't even Gay, although being gay or lesbian wasn't as frowned upon, unlike in the muggle world. This was mostly because they could still produce young, through a potion that some potion master created 500 years ago... or something. This was mostly why he'd been avoiding Draco, although he would never admit it he was falling in love with Draco, he couldn't stand staying near him. Something he could never have because Draco was soo.... Draco, he is amazing and he was soo.... Harry is just so ordinary that there was no reason why he could possibly want Harry. These were some of the thoughts that went through Harry's.
Thnx for reading hope you enjoyed :) Kudos and Comment, please :) Thnx for the support guys :) School has been taxing there is so much work and not enough time to write... so as you noticed updates longer. I'm not abandoning this fic even if it takes me a month to update.
They did a few tests on him and saw that he was a powerful and a very fertile Veela. That when it was time for him to decide whether the dominant who got to him was strong -both magically and physically- enough he would need to take their power in consideration, they needed to match him magically to keep him sane in the future and his Veela would crave for a powerful mate. The Goblins also reached out to the Veela council informing them that there was a new Veela. The Goblins also told him he needed to eat more since he was getting too skinny even for a Submissive Veela. Harry just nodded his head, even though he knew he wouldn't.
Harry looked down at his clothes and frowned. "Yeah, why? It's all I have at the moment Pansy and I forgot to order winter clothes when we ordered clothes. And the only other one I have is a sweater Mrs. Weasley gave me. But I don't really feel comfortable wearing that"
He stopped running to check, disappointed, he continued running. It seemed this dominant wasn’t worthy. He wondered if any of them were, if none of them were able to catch him he wou-
After an hour or so Harry was well rested. He couldn’t sense any others nearby so he figured it was safe to finally move out of his hiding spot and continue running. He slowly got out from his hiding spot taking refuge in the shadows the trees were producing and moved slowly towards the cave he saw while he was walking early during the day, only stopping every half an hour or so to make sure that he couldn’t sense anyone else nearby.
“Used to” Harry looked questionably
Harry was released and ran as fast as he could. There were dominants nearby. They needed to prove to him that they were able to track him, protect him, that they were worthy. These dominants, none of them were worthy until they could fight him. He needed to make certain that they were able to protect him from anything, even if the threat was himself.
"That is besides the point, but yes." Draco said smiling, but then turning grim as if he remembered something "I remember you mentioning something about Ron being your first ever friend, What is up with that?" Draco asked
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
“Ah, staring again I see”
Draco flew up to a tree and waited, and the submissive came closer and closer until Draco could see the little submissive coming up. And oh Merlin he looked beautiful. Draco didn’t know how but it was as if the submissive had a glow to him, Draco could spot it from anywhere even in the dead of night. Even if the submissive was ruffed up, hair messy full of twigs, skin smeared with mud here and there. It didn’t matter, Harry still looked wonderful and nothing nature could throw his way would make him look less than it.
"I'm sorry! I'M SORRY UNCLE! I PROMISE I WON'T DO IT AGAIN! I'M SORRY I'M SUCH A FREAK! I'LL BE GOOD! I'LL BE GOOD I PROMISE" Harry sobbed curling into himself as his uncle moved on to kicking and punching him. "You better be boy or else" His uncle left the room with a final kick then proceeded to slam the door shut leaving Harry to tend to his injuries in the dark cold room.
“Why?” Harry asked
Draco and Harry get the first whiff of one another after their inheritances.
Harry let Draco guide him to the submissive entrance of the enclosure. Harry shot off red sparks, and a few moments later the enclosure opened revealing worried council members. At the sight of the pair, the council members relaxed.
Harry took a deep breath. "Well, first of all... I'm Gay" Seeing Hermione smirk and about to interrupt him, he raised his hand signaling for her to let him finish, "... and... urmm... and I think... I think I'm in love," Harry looked directly into Hermione's eyes " or rather falling in love... with errm... , Draco Malfoy"
“Umm.. not a lot to be honest. When I was younger i used to think you lived a very privileged life.”
Draco couldn’t wait to mate with a submissive. For them to bare his children, to bond with them. It was a common misconception that Veelas used sex as a bonding meathod. In all honesty it was more like a bonding of the soul, sex was just encouraged by the bond, if the partners wanted they could consummate. Honestly Draco didn’t really care, as long as he would have a mate.
“Love you to Pans”
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter”
Draco talked to his housemates about house politics and what happened while he was away, but making sure to keep track of what Harry was eating and if he was eating enough. It scared him that Harry was so light, and he was motivated to help Harry gain some more weight. He knew Pasny would definitely help him out if he asked her.
Until...
“Oh, ok” Harry went back to staring out of the window.
Thank you for reading! Hope you all enjoyed it? :)) Kudos and Comments are very much appreciated thanks :D
“Hey did you guys notice that Weasley's been leaving us alone?” Harry asked his friends one day while they were hanging out by the great lake.
Harry picked up his potions book and flipped to the page he last read. He skimmed through the book taking note of the ingredients and compared how they reacted to one another. He was working on a new version of dreamless sleep, that was stronger and not addictive. He was almost done; he just needed to find a replacement for the Valerian Sprigs so that it wouldn't cause an explosion when it came in contact with crushed wormwood. After 2 hrs of reading Harry placed down his potions book and checked the time. It was 11 pm, 1 more hour till he was 15. Sighing, Harry placed his potions book down and picked up his charms textbook and skimmed through the lessons, just retaining the main ideas so that he could perform well at best.
He couldn’t believe that it was his reflection he was looking at, he really didn’t mind, he really didn’t. No. What really surprised him wasn’t the fact that his hair was longer, nor that he looked more feminine, or losing the height that he spent so much time trying to grow taller after years of abuse where he wasn’t able to get enough nutrients to grow, or even the fact that he looked kissable and hot. No. It was the fact that on his back was a pair of wings. A pair of wings that were covered in soft black feathers, at a closer look the inner feathers were actually a very dark emerald. The emerald so dark that at a glance they just looked like a black that was a bit green.
Harry looked shocked
Harry found himself thinking this a lot when Draco was in his line of sight, and he was. With his broad chest, muscles, sharp aristocratic facial features, beautiful bluish-grey eyes that pulled Harry in.
Hope you liked it :)
“Umm.. thanks. But why?”
So when he was talking to a Pansy in the hallway. Pansy shifted a bit and he could see him. And Merlin to Draco, Harry looked like an actual angel. But he wouldn't put his head up and tried to run away after Draco tried calling after him. So Draco ran after him. But after turning the corner it was like Harry just disappeared into thin air. After looking for him for 5 more minutes he went back to Pansy to see her smirking, she was the only one who knew about his... Crush. She asked about what happened and as he told the story she looked like she started to deflate, but Draco already being upset excused himself and headed down to the dungeon to think about things.
“It’s weird,” Harry said thoughtfully
Get a grip Harry, DAMNIT! All you had to do was pour the soup into the bowl! GOD DAMNIT! Harry repeated to curse himself while cleaning up the mess of soup on the chair then cleaning up the dinner and placing the leftovers in the fridge.
“Only you Harry, only you”
"Mhh, you smell nice."
2 more days until the hunt and Harry was practically vibrating with excitement. He had a gigantic smile on his face, and he was practically skipping down the halls. His excitement was starting to rub off on the people around him, so the Slytherins were mostly affected. When they were around him they wouldn’t be as harsh and there was the tiniest quirk of the lips that would disappear within the minute, but nevertheless it was still there.
“FINE, I may have a crush on Draco.”
"Harry, could I have the pleasure of being your boyfriend?" Draco asked clearly nervous
Draco watched as he studied in the library, tongue sticking out slightly, face pinched in concentration as he finished his assignments.
“Is that all you're going to eat?” Draco looked down at his mate, concern shining in his grey eyes.
“I love you too Harry, so so much, I won't let anyone take you from me.” Draco hugged Harry close.
And most importantly, his trust. One that he wouldn’t break unlike the Gryffindors.
It was a chaste kiss but filled with as much love as Harry could relay in that moment. When Harry leaned down the pair smiled at each other.
They sounded wrong. They weren’t scary enough, not strong enough to ward off threats to him. Harry needed to get away before they found him. They were currently fighting by the trunk of the tree clearly fighting over which one would go in and claim him.
“Well actually from what I have experienced. Usually the dominants say who they will hunt for. Then it is the most sought-after Submissive to the least. It gives the least sought after sub a chance, because if they go first the dominants won't try their best… You know?”
"POTTER!" Dr- Draco shouted at him "Wait come back here!" Harry could hear Draco shouting at him as he turned the corner, he heard footsteps chasing after him, so he ran and turned the corner hiding in an alcove behind a rather large tapestry. Harry held his breath as he heard Draco run past the tapestry once more shouting his name. At his name being called he couldn't help the way his stomach fill with butterflies. Once he was sure that Draco was long gone, he quietly left the Alcove and headed for the library once more to meet up with Hermione once more.
Draco was panicking, he needed to make a good first impression today. Being a dominant it was his job to impress the submissives. And he wasn’t the only one panicking, Blaise and Theo were also in the bathroom with him all trying to fix their hair.
Draco did, he started growling softly. “I will make him fall for me, I won’t force him if he doesn’t want me, but I will do my absolute best to make him mine.”
Draco felt Harry flinch for a moment before he relaxed. Draco then pulled them back into the alcove and set them onto the floor with Harry between his legs. Comforting Harry, when Harry was calm enough, Harry lifted his head until he was staring at Draco, and once their eyes connected Draco's breathing hitched until he was swimming in Harry's eyes, exploring each detail memorising each and every color and detail, every feeling and emotion that filled those eyes.
“-re of Magical creatures, and transfiguration and in the-”
Harry raised his head slightly to make sure then headed over to the table and collected Dudley's china then deposited them in the sink, he rinsed them with water, then went back to his corner to wait for his Aunt and Uncle to finish eating. When the couple was finally done eating he got their plates, cups and utensils then placed them in the sink. He then started scrubbing and doing the dishes. Finishing as fast as he could so that he could go to his room to relax before his birthday.
"So what did you find out, were you right?" Pansy smiled at Hermione, even more intrigued by Hermione's reaction.
"HARRY! What is up with you? Last term you were still fighting back! But ever since... ever since... ever since the Yule Ball you've been different! You run away from Draco! Just... just we want to know what is up with you! We're your friends, we only want what's best and to help you!" Hermione said, you could clearly hear the concern laced in her voice. It hurt Harry to see that she was this shaken up by his
“Draco Lucius Malfoy. I swear to Merlin if you don’t help me, you will be sleeping on the couch.”

“ What did you do, because it worked?” Draco asked, curious to see what they came up with.
And that one kiss became two.
'"Says who?" Harry asked turning to Draco smiling
"Hey Mione, what's up you said it was important." Pansy said, turning to Hermione with a raised eyebrow, while Hermione finished putting up a privacy charm around the already semi-hidden alcove, so that if anyone monitoring the halls were to pass by them they wouldn't be able to notice them. It was a system they had come up so they could meet up without "ruining" their "reputation".
“Well honestly, I just wanna curl up with someone… stronger, more dominant? It’s a weird feeling, I dunno how to describe it…”
“Sure don't care as long as you don't change this bed,” Harry said rubbing his face on the soft comforter.
This dominant was Draco Malfoy.
Draco walked into the tent, keeping his composure even though all the sweet smells around him were driving him nuts, though he could keep it under control, the only time he wasn’t able to keep his composer was when he had just gotten his inheritance and at the platform when the mystery submissive came.
Harry slowly drifted to sleep again. Draco stayed awake consumed with the boys depicted in the strange muggle book. A type of literature he had would have never explored before he met Harry
She had grown up during the summer, she didn’t just want to collect the latest gossip, or try on makeup products, and talk about fashion and etiquette and pureblood society all bloody day, even though there was no denying that she still enjoyed doing those things very much, it just wasn’t as fun anymore.
Common Room Mood Board:
He loved everything about Draco. Draco’s eyes looked at him with so much love and affection. Draco’s rare smile that was only common for Harry to see. Draco’s scent that instantly calmed Harry down and Draco’s embrace was always that warm and safe.
26 ...
He prepared himself to fly, he was pounced on by a bigger dominant. Draco shook him off easily.  How did he not sense this was dominant coming. It must be the sneaky one. Draco growled. If this dominant thought could coerce him into becoming he had another thing coming. Draco used the bigger dominants own strength to flip him over while he was trying to ram Draco into a tree.
"Harry don't fight me on this. You are so the cutest"
“I was so nervous you weren’t going to sign for me, I mean this isn’t a dream or something right?” Harry said softly
“I know baby,” Draco said softly, ”I’m so proud of you love.”

Harry shifted his focus from his surroundings to the actual people who were there. He noticed that there were 4 of 10 council members present for the Hunt, 3 of them looked very happy to be there while the other looked like he would rather be 6 feet under.
I wrote dialogue for once! I am proud of it, hopefully, you guys will too.
Harry stumbled toward his wardrobe opening the door and peering into the mirror. Staring at his reflection he gasped. He looked so different. Yesterday when he checked himself in the mirror he looked normal, with his extremely messy mop of pitch-black hair, his green eyes (that were previously looking dull and hollow), kinda muscular body, and build.
Harry could feel himself tearing up at the love that was showered upon him by Draco. “Draco I love you so freaking much.”
The sub barred his neck to Draco. Trying to coax Draco to scent him. And Draco did, he lowered his head putting his nose right at the scent gland of the sub. And he was in heaven. The scent that Draco had been surrounded by for the past few days was 10 times stronger in his neck. Draco softly licked the glad, tasting the skin offered to him.
Draco got his Jumper before retreating back to the bathroom looking smug at being able to get such a reaction out of Harry. When he exited the room a good 5 minutes later, he was dressed and ready to go. Hair styled to perfection not a hair out of place.
Then he focused his attention to the dominants. When he did he noticed a few of them, well most of them, were already staring at him. He squirmed under the intensity of a certain stormy gaze. Their eyes met for a few seconds, his stormy gray eyes captivating his. Harry couldn’t look away. Those gray eyes studied him, taking him in. They stared at each other for what felt like only a few seconds but it could have been an hour.
“So, Harry then, you are going to chase after him aren’t you” Blaise had a smirk on his face, while Draco started to choke on his food.
“I hope you all have decided who you want to hunt for. Just approach one of the council members present, tell them the submissives or submissive you would like to hunt for. So that we can set up the order.” The council member said. “Oh, you may change your mind, just inform us, and if you wish to participate last minute you must inform a counselor at least 30 minutes prior to the submissive’s hunt. The hunt is tomorrow, choose wisely, we mate for life. A Veela will always be their happiest with their 1st mate.”
"Shiz, Harry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean too, you just looked so beau--" Draco wasn't able to finish his sentences because Harry's lips were on his once more kissing him. Both of them melted into the kiss. Draco moving his arms to wrap around Harry's waist pulling him closer, and Harry's arms wrapping around Draco's neck. Their lips moved in sync, after a few moments Harry pulled away.
He then opened up Hermione and Ron’s letters. Both letters were pretty pathetic. Well, at least Hermione had some concern for him. Not even a present. Though he really didn't expect one from them anyway. Ever since they got together they had started to ignore him in favor of their relationship. Though he really couldn’t blame them, they were new to it.
“2 others.”
“What if-”
Draco nodded. "Of course baby, If you're ever uncomfortable just tell me, love."
"Ok, what is this condition then, Har?" Draco asked, smiling fondly at his boyfriend.
“So what’s on your mind Harry?”
“What do you mean?” Draco looked up to the confused gaze of his mate.
Harry was so overwhelmed with the love that Draco was giving him he didn’t even know how to respond.
He watched as Harry passed in front of every dominant, he’d already ½ of the Dominants. Draco was shaking. He was so worried. Harry was at the dominant right to his left. Draco held his breath.
Harry thought about his birthday and wished that he could spend it in the burrow with his friends and actually have a real birthday for once. With a party, cake, presents, and his friends.
Draco watched amused as his best friend sat awkwardly, leaning to the side a bit as a figure curled into his side.
Harry was so happy that he would be spending the rest of his life with Draco
Once the scent disappeared and his head cleared. He was taken to the dominant entrance and given the inducer. He could feel his senses sharpen. He let out his claws and his wings, growling he could feel other Veela’s nearby. He could smell the submissive. It was faint but he could smell him. There was a hedge keeping him from the submissive he tried everything to get there. There was something keeping him from flying he couldn't cut the hedges.
A/N I changed a few details about Veela's in this chapter. So basically after the hunt, they aren't a couple until they bond. Meaning until they have intercourse (but that will be later and there will be warnings, I'm not even sure if I will write it. If I don't end up writing it I will change the rating of this fic)
Harry heard several loud thuds indicating that his uncle had awoken. Dust particles falling onto his head as he tried to get comfortable in the cramped toddler's bed. He heard his uncle screaming at him to get up, and start making breakfast.
“Yes, yes, and I would levitate my trunk if my wand wasn’t packed inside”
-Tina <33
Harry flew to the center. There was a big tree in the middle, perfect for hiding in. He hid in there. He could sense the other 2 dominants close by. Half of him wanted to show himself, let them know where he was so that they could catch him. The other half thought that was too easy, they needed to find him themselves. So he stayed hidden. They heard the growling of the other 2 dominants nearby.
“Students.” Dumbledore noticed none of the students could hear him, they were trying to keep their instincts under control. He cast a sonorus on his voice. “STUDENTS.” All heads turned towards him. “Good, now that I have your attention, just a reminder that all students who will be participating in the hunt will be exempted from all school work, until the hunt is done. Teachers have been notified, none of them are requiring work from you until after the settling period for those who are going to mate. This will allow you to choose your mate and choose them wisely, they will be your mate for life. Now that is out of the way you may now mingle.”
"Of course."
“Ok then, if you're sure.” Pansy was still judging his plate, her own plate filled with so much meat and salad Harry didn’t know how she could eat that much “God knows why you're not slimmer.’
“Okay what”
“Yah. I kinda get it.”
When she finally got to the Library, Hermione started asking him questions about where he was, but Harry was already tired from his little run in with Draco, that he was just answering the questions without really realising what he was answering, Harry picked out a charms book and sat down with starting his charms paper, the last thing that Harry heard before he got lost in his work was "Dammit!" Courtesy of Hermione.
"It's okay Draco, erm..." Harry said looking nervous "Do you like me?" Harry asked, closing his eyes nervous. Draco chuckled,
Moving to his bed Harry curled up against the corner of his bed, relaxing as much as he could and then started reading. Using the lamp outside as a lightsource so that if his aunt and uncle went to the bathroom they wouldn’t see his light on.
"Thanks, Harry, but srsly I'm really sorry you went through that." With that they lapsed back into a comfortable silence, Draco and Harry repositioned so that Harry was leaning onto Draco's chest and Draco's arms were around Harry's waist.
“I’m not that bad Pansy”
Early the next morning Harry woke up with his body aching. Stretching to get his glasses he opened his eyes to see that he could already see everything well enough. Thinking that he must have slept with his glasses on he stretched and rubbed at his aching muscles and standing up, using the table as a support for his wobbling legs.
"Yah, remember what I told you last time, about my suspicions with Harry?" She said sitting down against the wall behind him, gesturing for Pansy to do the same. Pansy sat down beside Hermione looking at her with her eyebrow still raised. Pansy gave a slight nod, still suspicious.
Merlin does have to look so attractive.
“Calm down Harry, you're practically bouncing off the walls. If you keep this up i doubt you’ll have enough energy for Saturday” Pansy rolled her eyes playfully at her friend. They were on their way to the dungeon for potions class. “And I’m pretty sure you don’t want to be asleep do you”
“Ok” She went back to wolfing up her food. Harry was sure when her instinct would be suppressed she would be so horrified. He giggled to himself already seeing her face. He turned back to his food when she started glaring at him.
But no he wasn’t your normal submissive. They needed to work to get him. So he made sure to move around constantly to make sure they wouldn’t be able to track him.
It was the first kiss Harry had initiated between the two of them.
Harry covered the letters and Parcels with some of Dudley's broken toys and oversized clothing. Then he left the room to prepare breakfast for his “family”.
“No, I think you're fine.”
“Ready for what Harry?”
“No, but it would make sense.”
“How are you not?”
Just as Draco was finished with his plan he spotted his friends by the train's entrance. On his way to his friends he froze. He smelt the most amazing scent since he was at his Veela Meeting. After a few moments, the scent dissipated and Draco continued his way to his friends knowing exactly what that scent meant. There was an unmated submissive Veela at Hogwarts, and they were powerful and by the looks of it very fertile.
“It could be better…” Draco said smiling at his mate. “We might need to change the color scheme.”
-Tina
Draco was really looking forward to going back to Hogwarts, especially when he could act like himself outside of his dormitory and common room. Draco also was looking forward to being able to act nice to people now that his father didn't have his “Malfoy’s are cold” reputation anymore. He was going to try and get closer to his raven-haired crush. If he was able to have a good friend relationship with Harry he would eventually ask if he could court him.
He must have made a sound because the next thing he knew the submissive was staring right at him, as if his eyes were looking into his soul. And they just stared at each other.
“Just leave it Pans, I wanna finnish my tart.”
Harry’s face was bright red as he mumbled something, Pansy was barely able to hear most of it.
Dudley ran down the stairs and practically pounced on the chair. Making sure he sat on the spot where all the food was in arms reach. Then Vernon and Petunia came in and sat down. When the family was settled Petunia signaled that they were ready to eat. Harry bowed his head slightly then headed for his corner of the room. Not looking up until he heard the silverware stop clacking and the chair scraping backwards, signaling that Dudley had finished his dinner.
“True. Then it's probably your Veela blocking them. Mine are still acting up because I just claimed you, and there are still unclaimed dominants in the area.”
In a fit of anger Draco punched the dominant in the stomach, and growled the most ferocious he could manage, smacking the dominant across his face making sure his claws caught on a bit of skin. Not enough to kill him, but enough to warn him, he wasn’t going to back up.
Harry raced ahead of Luna and Neville. But half-way to the train he stopped mid-step. Harry got this dazed look on his face as he stilled until he shook his head confused for a second before he kept walking. Luna and Neville exchanged looks behind his back before boarding the train with him.
“Yes Draco, I’m not hungry” He was
I am so sorry this is Trash.
When he finally calmed down enough to sleep, his dreams were plagued by the horrors of what happened to Harry growing up. They felt so real that whenever Draco would wake up from one of these dreams he would check to see if Harry was still beside him before falling asleep again.
“Yah… I guess that makes sense”

Elder Hanna stepped back, not fazed. This was normal behavior for dominants. “Okay, I’m not going to hurt him. Here is the antidote to the inducer. One sip each.”
“Yah, I’m good”
When Draco didn’t have his masks on was actually quite decent. Harry wanted to get to know this part of Draco much much more.
The submissive was missing. Nowhere to be seen. And his scent was everywhere, like he ran up to every single tree and rubbed his scent on them to keep him off the trail. But Draco was smart. He knew that this was probably what the sneaky submissive would do. It was nearing night time and Draco was sure that Harry would be hungry, and he hadn't seen any animals in the deeper section of the forest. He saw a lot more at the outer edge of the enclosure. He was sure that the submissive would be there.
Harry was confused. While he was on his way to board the train he smelt the most amazing scent. He just didn't know what it was. As quick as he smelt it, the scent was suddenly gone. Harry shook his head, and continued on his way to the door of the train.
“Hey Luna, Neville” Harry beamed at his honorary siblings. “Luna how was your trip with your dad? See any Crumple horned snorkacks?”
Draco was doing fine. He meet a nice ravenclaw, not his type, but would be a great submissive to her dominant. Draco was talking to her about her plans for the future when he saw it. The world went in slow motion as he saw the dominant grobe Harry’s bum. Before he knew it he was growling running to tackle the dominant.
“Yes, you are Harry.”
“Do you want to continue, because we can continue another time?”
Thinking about this imaginary person Harry felt even more alone, he felt that if he were just to disappear no one would even notice much less care. His stomach grumbled, then he realised how hungry he was. He didn't even know when the last time he ate was. He longed to go back to Hogwarts at least there he had food -even though he couldn't stomach much- water and a bed.
“Are you okay Harry?” Draco asked him after Harry had zoned out again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think you smell divine, but yes I agree I think we should head back before they send out a search team.”
“I just wanted to inform you, that you may return to your rooms in the castle. The headmaster has set-up a room for the mated couples for both of you, you should move in soon. You don't need to attend and you can just settle in for the next 4 weeks.”
“Draco. We all know the only other dominant who could possibly catch Harry besides you is probably me. We are the fastest Dominants here. Even then you would overpower me. You are stronger. Plus we have been training since we were 11 when we found out. If anyone had the best chance of getting Harry, it would be you.” Blaise sad rolling his eyes, this was at least the 5th time he had said the exact same thing.
Draco couldn't wait for the mating meeting in November, he was really looking forward to finishing out who this submissive was. But could you blame him? Maybe he could even get to see the identity of this submissive before the hunt. Maybe even a glimpse. Now Draco was really excited for the Hogwarts express to roll into Hogsmead station.
“Draco?” Harry said softly not opening his eyes
"You've liked me since before first year?" Harry asked hope clearly in his eyes.
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
When Draco was able to focus again without the intoxicating smell of the powerful submissive infiltrating his system, he noticed that Goyle and Blaise had the same reaction as him. Shaking his head he steeled himself and turned away from the compartment and walked down the hall motioning for the other 2 dominant Veela’s to do the same.
“Hey, I was going to get tha-” Harry stopped mid-sentence when Draco started filling up his own plate. “What are you doing?”
“If you're sure”
Phew! So that is done. I hope yall enjoyed this chapter. I thank you guys so much for all the support that you have given this work. I really appreciate it.
“Sure” Harry got up and went to explore their new quarters.
“That makes sense”
He wondered if his parents would be proud of him if they were alive, of course he knew that his parents would be... but that doesn't mean that he didn't wonder if they would have been upset instead that he goes out risking his neck every year.
He watched as Harry bit his quill during class when he was writing notes.
“For you to claim me, for us to start the mating process.”
"One ... two ... three ... f-four ... f-fi-five... SIX" Harry started counting repressing whimpers and screams of pain so that he didn't have to go through with it much longer. He knew he was still counting but it all blended into the haze of pain and misery. When his uncle finally grew tired of whipping him. He stood up and threw Harry against the wall.
When Harry was full there was still a lot of the deer left, and he was stuffed, barely able to move. He hoped that none of the dominants were nearby, he was vulnerable right now. Harry crawled to a small hidden space between trees and settled down. He was going to rest for a while then find a good place to hide in the forest, if he remembered correctly there was a cave that he passed while he was hiding from the dominants.
“No not really, us creatures mature faster, so by the time we mate it's mature enough to have children. So yes if you were a muggle or a regular wizard it would be rather weird but not uncommon, but for creatures it's completely normal.”
Pansy a life of adventure and independence
"Hey." His voice breathy, still full of sleep.
Draco had to stop himself from snogging the beautiful boy senseless whenever those eyes turned towards him. He was happy to notice how Harry would stare at him constantly, the same way that Draco would in turn stare at him.
Harry looked down at his plate. It wasn't empty but it was at least three fourths full. “Yah, I’m hungry.”
“No, I just noticed in third year. I’m pretty sure he’s fancied you since first year.”
"How could I not like you? For the record I've liked you since I saw you in that shop in Madam Malkins, I've liked you ever since. But really Harry, how could I not like you, you save people and you give the wizarding world hope, especially when you vanquished... You-Know-Who last year during the last task. What isn't there to not to like you, besides the fact that you can be such a stubborn git at times but I love you for it even though every time we've interacted before hasn't been so pleasant, but I plan on changing that if you let me." Draco said clearly meaning every word of what he said.
Anyway, bye for now -Polyester :)

And he was coming closer to the cave. Draco panicked, if the submissive were to scent him out in the area he would for sure run away, and Draco would lose his shot. So Draco decided he would fly up to the tree by the entrance of the cave and wait for the submissive to come closer, he would have a better shot.
“I dunno, I mean I've got my whole life ahead of me. Why do I need to settle down right now? I mean I’m only 15, why do I need to mate?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Umm... Truth, again" Harry said a blush dusting his cheeks
And two became three.
“No… Dad thinks they migrated to the north for summer, but we were able to find a horn!” Luna said in her Dreamy voice with a smile on her face as she remembered her summer. “How about you Neville? How was your inheritance?”
Harry had gone through all his clothes that he and Pansy had owl ordered. He realised he didn't order any clothes for the winter weather. All he had was the jacket he wore during the hunt, and the robes he wore in the enclosure. But other than that he had nothing else warm to wear except a few long sleeves. After thinking about it a bit he decided that the long sleeves would work, even if they were thin.
“Yes Elder?” Draco asked curiously
Thank you so much to everyone who has chosen to read this fic that I am writing. I am so sorry it is so cringey, but I am so glad yall enjoy it! Comments and Kudos are always appreciated
And Draco knew for sure he was in love with Harry, and he was determined to have that boy as his mate.
“Around 6:30”
“What?”
-Tina <33
At some point, they moved to the living room. Draco was sitting on the couch reading a book while Harry was on his lap reading along. Draco had his hand running through Harry's hair. Harry and Draco had spent the day getting to know each other. They realized how stupid they had been during the previous years. All those years they could have been dating instead of fighting. Draco was determined to make up for 2 years of Hogsmeade dates. Harry just nodded, subdued by the steady fingers rubbing at his scalp making him sleepy.
‘What was that?’ Harry whipped around to face where the sound was coming from. And he saw him. It was definitely a dominant. With his angular body, sharp features, and predatory gaze. Harry stared at the dominant in the tree wondering how a being could look that handsome while in a tree.
"Yes Hazz?" Draco said
“Draco your on my side right mate?”
Harry riffled the pages and sniffed at the paper, sighing when his heightened sense of smell obviously picked up the scent of a new book. Opening the book to the table of contents and turning to the chapter that read:
“Yah” She said looking up from her food.
Eventually Draco came down from his "high" and sighed "Harry what's wrong?" Harry ducked his head, Draco not wanting Harry to hide anymore placed his finger under the smaller boys chin and tilted it upwards. "None of that Harry, look, I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry for the way I treated you, Ron, Hermione and everyone else that I have hurt while I was being childish. Look, I understand if you don't forgive me, i just wanted you to know that I am really sorry, I honestly was just really jealous and i didn't know how to deal with it since growing up i was an onl-"
"I like that. Hazz, Hazza. Has a nice ring. But besides that, can we go down for lunch? I'm starting to get hungry" Right on schedule Harry's stomach decided to make itself known.
Perfect pairs were rare, a perfect pair is very rare in the Veela community. It is when 2 Veela’s are compatible with each other, and their inner Veela can feel it. Often pushing the 2 partners together even when they haven’t had their inheritances. Often it will be easier for the pair to talk to each other mentally, feel the others pain and emotions etc…
The Displaying week was over. It was time for the dominants to decide who they wanted to have as their mates, which submissives they would be willing to die for, care for, love.
“Sounds good,” Harry said, already falling asleep.
Getting over the shock he reached behind him lightly brushing his fingers against the feathers. Shivering at the soft wave of pleasure that coursed through him from the light brush. He then strokes his inner feathers curious to see his reaction. The moment he touches the smaller inner feathers closer to his back his moans softly as a stronger wave of pleasure overtakes him.
Harry tried studying for Potions with Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco, but he just couldn't keep up, sure he was smart but he still couldn't keep up because the Slytherins and Hermione were already studying months ahead of where Harry was, when Harry finally got really worked up that he couldn't understand anything he banged his head onto the table and just sighed. Suddenly when all the concentration left his brain and he just started to relax he noticed that he could feel someone looking at him, well more like staring at him.
Harry was escorted to the submissive entrance by a guard and a council member. The hedge closed behind them right after. That was the last he caught of the submissive before he could sense the strong mating hormones being released inside the maze. He surged forward, a growl forming in his throat. The scent was getting away.
Harry and Draco didn’t leave their rooms often other than to eat, and catch up on the school that they were missing while they were settling, but whenever they did leave it was to hangout with Pansy or Blaise or Neville or any of their friends. The more they went out, the more Harry noticed the absence of one annoying weasel.
“How can you be so calm?”
"Yes uncle Vernon" Harry practically whispered just loud enough so that his uncle could hear him. He finished making the coffee in record time, putting the cup on the table then bowing his head "Here you go sir, anything else sir?" Harry asked quietly, not willing to have another punishment given to him so close after last night's punishment. When his uncle didn't respond Harry went back to the corner, bowing his head.
Draco looked so horrified with the information that Harry couldn’t bear telling him about the cupboard or beatings yet, he would just not yet. He needed time to rest after opening up his emotional wounds.
“Don’t hide,” Draco said, Harry tilted his head to look up at Draco and mumbled something. “I’m sorry, Harry, I wasn't able to catch that”
She didn’t realize that it was already this cold even though it was in the middle of November. She was starting to get chilly, her hot chocolate the only thing keeping her from freezing. By the time she realized that she was a witch and there was such a thing as magic, she also remembered in her grogginess she had left her wand on her dresser table. Settling for a weak wandless warming charm, it wasn’t the best since she was hopeless at wandless magic, but it was better than freezing in the cold.
Harry was starting to get hungry, he could smell a deer close by. He tracked down the deer, sneaking up on it to get the kill. He was craving its meat, the sun was close to setting, and Harry hadn’t eaten anything since sunrise, and all the running away from domiants had Harry getting hungry faster.
“But seriously me, a
24...
Draco didn't respond. He was in his head imagining a life with a mate. His mate the one and only Harry Potter.
Later that night long after Harry and Ron had gone up exhausted from all the revision work, the same bushy haired teen under the disillusionment charm snuck out of the common room and down to the snake den. Once she arrived she saw her by the entrance tapping her foot impatiently, God to the bushy-haired teen she looked perfect. She'd been harbouring feelings for the Slytherin for some time now, not that she would admit it to anyone. Unlike what most people say, she was actually a decent person.
He wondered if he would ever be happy, or if this year was going to be the year that could be normal... or as normal it can be when you are the boy-who-lived and everyone is either worshipping the ground you walked on or is calling you a liar and a cheat. And with Cedric dying and Ron and Hermione's newly found relationship - where they often ignored him and left him sad alone- he was wondering if he could ever be happy.
“Pansy”
“What’s on your mind love?”
Draco couldn’t stand it. There were so many dominants around him. Too many dominants around what should be his, Draco had to steel himself. Harry wasn’t his… yet. He just had to win him over, Woo him. Make Harry forgive him for all that he was done over the years. Give him a second chance to prove himself.
“Ha ha, funny Blaise. But yes I will be.”
dominant more.
Draco has always had a crush on Draco ever since he 1st saw the raven haired boy in Madam Malkins, Draco tried impressing the boy but looking back at it, he came off as mean and he knew it. Draco always thought that he would have a second chance when he got to Hogwarts again, which is why when Ron was able to befriend Harry in his 1st go Draco got really Jealous so he resorted to being mean.
Have a great Day!
Harry jumped a bit surprised by the smooth voice of his mate.
"Good." Harry nodded back, eyes also flickering between Draco's eyes and lips for a second. Suddenly Draco came closer and closer until their lips brushed together, the lightest kiss, just a slight brush until Draco pulled back looking panicked.
The one good thing about his birthday, his relatives would avoid him at all costs. It was like a little retreat, their own form of gift maybe. Anyway no matter what it was. Besides having a longer list of chores, or being avoided like the plague, to Harry July 31st was just another day. It was like any other day, therefore nothing to celebrate, if there was anything to celebrate. Harry couldn't wait.
Draco watched as Harry carefully decided what he was going to put on his plate during meals.
Hermione and Ron were getting worried because this was almost a daily occurs now, after dinner every day -even though Harry wouldn't eat that much- Harry would work on his homework, that itself was very strange, and then he would go either onto a couch or a bed and just lay there staring emptily at the ceiling mumbling stuff under his breath to really nobody.
"Of course he's not dating Snape you idiot!" Hermione said, narrowing his eyes at Ron. "What Ron means to say is that we will support you through anything, even if you are in love with Snape, unlikely as it is." Hermione said smiling at Harry.
“Pansyyyy, please shut up” Harry said nudging her
Little did they know, he had already escaped away from them. The dominants scents were everywhere Harry didn’t know where the dominants were, they must be by the center of the forest if they were thinking he would be like every other submissive.
“Maybe. But you're still being very Veela’y, no that’s not the right term. Erm… protective?”
Some of the submissives looked snobbish, the type of submissive who would wine, be difficult. Draco didn’t want that. He glazed over those subs, the others looked ok, if Draco weren’t gay he would probably go for them. He noticed there were less submissives in this meeting then there were in the one he attended over the summer. A lot of submissives chose to wait then.
“Draco I’m ready”
1... Suddenly the pain stops
Once he felt the world stop spinning and his legs starting to wake up again he took a step forward only to hear a crunch. Looking down confused he looked at the floor seeing his glasses (the frame broken) just laying there he picked them up confused. He gasped in surprise as his head made the connection  he felt on his face with his hands feeling the bridge of his nose, when he felt nothing there he started to panic slightly rushing for the small mirror inside his wardrobe.
Pansy was starting to worry. During her last gathering, none of the dominants had taken this long to capture their submissive, she was wondering what was going on in the enclosure. It was already so late that the council had sent the remaining submissives and dominants back into the dormitories. Pansy had gotten so used to having Harry around she was getting lonely without his presence and her old Slytherin friends weren’t the same.
Harry moved closer and closer until he was tucked into Draco's side. His warmth surrounding his body. Harry sighed as he fits perfectly curling into Draco's body. Tucking his cold feet to rest beside Draco's warm ones. He heaved a sigh of relief, he was so comfortable it was as if Draco was made to be his pillow. Harry didn't want to overstep on boundaries not knowing how comfortable Draco was with cuddling so he settled with their position right now. For now, just imagining his arms spooning Harry into Draco's solid chest.
“Yes, I want you to know everything”
They arrived at the clearing where the tents were. There weren’t a lot of people there, maybe around roughly 20 on one table and then 10 on the other. When Harry stepped in the tent his senses were overloaded with so many scents. Harry went weak at the knees, it just smelled so good. Pansy was already so used to the different scents that it didn’t bother her much, and Harry held on to her for dear life. She didn’t seem to mind much.
“I may have a tiny crush on Draco” Harry said louder this time, but not loud enough.
Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle were once again in a corridor on the way to the library where Pansy arranged for them to meet up with the Golden Trio to study as well as put into motion the next part of their plan. When they arrived in the Library Hermione and Pansy started to study in the bay window together, Hermione helping Pansy with her "good subjects" while Pansy helped her with her not so good subjects. Eventually everyone broke into their groups with Blaise and Draco joining Pansy and Hermione studying for an upcoming Potions Quiz, while Crabbe, Goyle and Ron started talking about quidditch.
“Oh, I was a prick huh?”
“But what if-”
"Really, this is what's got you so worked up? Mate. I may be stupid but I'm not blind! I've known you've liked that Ferret since that care of Magical creatures class in like, 3rd year, when he got hit by Buckbeak remember? And then I saw you show concern, you know?" Ron shrugged as if this was news to everyone
"Um.. No I guess not. I just mean why would you like me? Your... Draco Malfoy, the Slytherin Ice Prince, Handsome, and mysterious" Harry said Gesturing with his head then pausing to look at Draco," I didn't even know you were Gay until you kissed me mind you" then he continued his ranting arms flailing," and your so cool and overall just... WOAH, and i'm just... Harry. I'm so Boring and so Plain... Just why would you like me?" Harry asked true confusion flashing through his eyes.
Harry snuffled a bit before he turned facing away from Draco, huddling in the comforter against the freezing air. Draco watched the sleeping form of his mate for a few more minutes before he slowly slipped into dreamland as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
He blushed remembering their moment the night before.
Harry was happy, and this time it wasn’t just a mask.
Harry laughed at that comment. “You were a big prick back then”. Draco quirked a brow, his eyes betraying his true feelings.
“Because I want to,” Draco said, adding mashed potatoes to Harry’s plate, no gravy. Before passing it to Harry “Is that a crime?”
Draco went into the washroom to freshen up. He took a quick shower and put on a pair of pajamas, before leaving and crawling opposite to Harry. It was still awkward sleeping beside another person. So Draco kept to his side not knowing if his presence would be appreciated by Harry this early in their relationship. Cuddles administered by Harry was okay, but Draco didn’t want to do anything if Harry didn’t start it for now. He wanted things to be perfect for Harry.
Have a good day
"It's okay Draco, I'll be your friend now. I was just mad that you were treating my first ever friend mean." Harry pulled back and looked Draco in the eye "We can be friends as long as you stop being mean, you can continue the whole slytherin prince, ice cold, or whatever that is, BUT no bullying, ok?" Harry said, staring Draco dead in the eye, completely serious. Draco gulped and his eyes flicked to Harry's lips before back to his eyes.
yes i know its been a while-
The pair decided that they would have their mating in 4 days' time, Enough time for Harry to heal, and enough time for them to prepare for the 3 days of solitude that followed.
Harry was almost at the cave, he was so close. He didn’t know how but it was if he memorised the forest. The trees were so familiar as if he walked this path everyday. He was enjoying the calmness of the nightime, almost completely forgetting about the dominants that could be lurking in the shadows.
Draco gave a deep feral growl. Trying to force the bigger dominant to submit. When the dominant growled back, Draco got angry. The stupid dominant thinks he could get his submissive. Not a chance. He needed to get rid of this pest and continue searching for his beautiful present hiding somewhere in the forest.
Then Harry made the first move. And Draco was on his heels, a growl bursting from his chest determined for this submissive to be his, he wouldn’t go for anything else.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine, you weren't the biggest prick”
As they continued to get comfortable with each other, the more confident Harry got about their mating. He was even ready, and heavily anticipated, the time when they would complete their mateship and have sex. The kisses that Draco was giving him, were like a nice appetizer to what Harry knew would be an amazing meal.
Draco had bought a book from their room to the infirmary. Not one of their school books or potions journals. But a muggle book that he had caught Harry reading on occasion before they were mated. The title of the book was “The Lord of the Flies” a book about a group of schoolboys that got stranded on a deserted island.
That got Harry to start walking normally again but still wouldn’t erase the grin from his lips. “Fineeee, but only because I want to be there on Saturday, I would still be annoying you otherwise” He smirked, casting a slight warming charm on his clothes. The chill of October started to get to him.
"Yes just a bit sleepy"
Tell me what you thought. I dont particularly like this chapter but I didn't know what else to do. Anyway hope you like this
“My views have changed”
Days leading up to the hunt
"What's wrong?" Draco was concerned. "Did I do anything wrong?"
Harry woke up a bit as Draco set him on the bed and changed his clothes into pajamas.
28... Harry ignored the slight tingle he was starting to feel in his chest
25... The tingle started moving higher, to his shoulders and down to his abdomen
Harry was curled up in the armchair by the double doors to the balcony half-asleep as he watched the sun go down. He kept gazing back at Draco as if trying to convince himself that he was where he was. In the couples hall, with a mate, with
(See the end of the chapter for
“At this point you're worse than me.” Draco said leaving the bathroom.
Harry knew they were released, he could sense them all around him. There was one in every direction. He needed to go deeper and find a place to hide, where the dominants would have a hard time finding him.
“You are so cute,” Draco said as he passed by the bedroom, and into the walk-in closet to unpack their clothes. “Harry do you want me to unpack your clothes?”
“He never eats much.” The boys turned to see Pansy sit across from them. “Congrats guys, see Harry you had nothing to worry about.” Harry blushed while Draco looked questioningly at Pansy, wordlessly asking her to tell him what she was talking about. “He was worried you weren’t going to go for him.”
“Ah- but Harry we already said that your first instinct was to get the attention of a Dominant”
That's it! Hope you enjoyed
They cuddled the rest of the night. Harry felt lighter and freer now that everything was out in the open. He was so glad that Draco still treated him the same, even if he knew how horrible his childhood was. It was going to be even better now that he could understand more of his needs and wants.
Pansy woke up, she didn’t know what to expect, but she hoped that they were out of the enclosure by now. She wanted some time to snuggle with Harry if Draco would allow her. She didn’t know she had gotten herself so attached to the younger male, but honestly, it didn’t freak her out as much as she thought it should. Pansy never knew she wanted a sibling until recently when she started to get to know Harry.
“It is funny!”
“Ahh… Possessive already.”
Harry smiled snuggling in as Draco wrapped his arm around Harry.
"Ahh, I see. Let's go then." Draco stood up putting his book down on the coffee table before pulling Harry up and dragging him to the closet to get changed.
"Oh, oh it's ok" Harry said shaking his head, flushing a nice fiery red.
When Harry found that out, he also realised that he may or may not have feelings for his schoolboy nemesis Draco Malfoy -Harry was sure Ron would freak when he heard this. That made everything click, why he was so
Harry especially loved Draco’s kisses. From the light feathery ones that Draco planted everywhere from his cheek to his shoulders and his nose. Those always made him smile. To the hot, heavy and dominating snogs that they shared, those always left him breathless.
He was making spaghetti carbonara. He heated up the leftover bacon from breakfast and started cutting them up into tiny bits and pieces. Then he got the cream, salt, pepper, cheese, etc. and started on the sauce. While he was waiting for the sauce to finish he started to boil water in a large pot then started to make the pasta. When Harry was finished he stared at the food for a moment before scrunching up his nose. The pasta was ok at best (for him, but really was amazing for other people's standards), it was too runny and there was too much salt and not enough pepper. But he didn't want to get scolded for being late, so he plated the carbonara into the serving pan, then brought it to the dinner table.
Harry looked at his wings again stroking the wings and then softly shivering in the soft waves that stroking the outer feathers gave him. Harry thought… is this such a bad thing? Harry thought about it as he toyed with his hair… no, no it wasn't such a bad thing. This could finally be the chance Harry got to be cared for, to have someone love him. No this would be a good thing, and Harry looked forward to meeting his mate. Remembering that the Goblin’s were waiting for his response as to what his inheritance is. So Harry got up and got a parchment and a quill and wrote a quick letter to Ironclaw, saying that he was a Veela. He gave the letter to Hedwig, then lay down on his bed exhausted, as soon as his head touched the pillow he was out like a light.
“Seriously I'm not that bad!”
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, I'm not."
Harry giggled slightly as Draco set him on his feet. The pair set out to the edge of the camp, Draco was still on high alert, he had already scent marked Harry, but that wouldn’t stop the other dominants from trying to stake a claim. Harry on the other hand was relaxed, his Veela was no longer shouting in his ear to mate.
"Oh" Suddenly Harry could breathe easier knowing that his friends supported him, maybe he had a shot. Secretly in the shadows you could see a bushy-haired teen sending a secret message to someone. Telling them to meet her in the shadows in front of the snake's den. With a final smirk as her message had been received. She snuck back to her 2 best friends and sent them to the Gryffindor common room to work on their assignments and in Harry's case so that she could check them.
"Yupp!" Harry said, smiling, grabbing Draco's hand to pull them to the door.
Nothing could ruin his mood, well almost nothing. Weasley would still glare at him from across the room while Granger just allowed it to happen. Ginny had finally noticed he was missing and started to try to latch on him. Luckily Harry had a Pansy, and Pansy had like a third eye for this. It was like she could sense when weasley or granger were on their way and would always usher him away. He was very grateful, the only thing keeping him from clawing their eyes out was the fact that they never got within 6 feet of him.
