Draco was very amused. He had totally fooled Potter into thinking that he would have kissed him... oh, that poor naive soul. At least now he had it, the confirmation that he was totally into him as well, despite him being with Weasley.
Everyone agreed. Harry and Draco blushed, feeling embarrassed, but they were smiling, nevertheless.
Draco was surprised at their open-mindedness, they were so fine with them being together.
"Remember that in relationships, both participants have to be on ze same level." Jean Jacques said, putting his hand on Draco's nodded, but he didn't say a word.
June train rides to King's Cross were never really a fun adventure for Harry and his gang, but this time was particularly hard.
"I just want to say how truly sorry I am." the girl said, looking down at her feet.
Ginny Weasley, Harry's ex and best friend's sister, was standing there, a smirk set on her face. She had a camera in her hand, the camera that he had given her as a birthday gift in August. His breath caught up in his throat as he began to think that, maybe, Ginny was determined to use that device to hurt him. If she hadn't done that already.
The day after, Pansy had her trunk ready, she was in the Slytherin common room, waiting for her ride.
"We heard so much about you!" Both parents said as they all came inside, and it didn't take them long before they hugged Ron, too.
"What do you want, Hermione?" Asked Harry in an annoyed tone.
"Ron and Hermione played a part in this." said Draco.
The little boy seemed to enjoy being moved around from his parents to his uncles and aunts, his cute baby laughter confirming the theory.
"Ok, Goodnight, everyone!" said Ginny, awkwardly. Then, she got up and left, followed by her girlfriend.
They were both wearing the jumpers Molly had made them for Christmas, Luna had her hair tied in a messy bun, set into place with her wand.
"I saw it when you played Quidditch together that time, when you exchanged a kiss in mid air." Miss Sivan observed. "So, do you need my help with your proposal, dear?"
In Hogwarts, he was a leader, people followed him and feared him, but they also adored him. Those were all the things that he felt for his father.
Then, she ran after the pair.
Right in that moment, the doors flung open and three people came running.
"What were you looking to achieve?" She asked in a scolding tone, referring to Ginny and Pansy.
"3, 2, 1!" Said Ginny, then everyone grabbed the object and got teleported to the Burrow.
For example, he would raise his hand faster than Hermione would, during classes.
Luna and Ginny did a dance that was very similar to their Easter one, earning a bunch of puzzled looks.
Obviously, the good times prevailed.
"Hello, Narcissa." Said Harry, nodding his head at her when he sat down.
The same set of golden chairs was used, they were placed in front of many round tables, all covered by golden silky cloths.
"Oh, right." Harry said, shifting his attention from Draco to his best friend. The thought had never really crossed his mind in the days before.
"You knew this was going to hurt us." Harry said. "Don't you dare sit here with us. Oh, and consider yourself out of the Quidditch team."
This was when their ways parted, Pansy made her way to the Slytherin table, while Draco went to the Gryffindor one.
Now I can die happily, she thought as Gwenog Jones in person got up from her seat to squeeze her into a hug and wish her a happy birthday.
"Look, Luna," Ginny began, after taking a breath. "What happened between us... it was just a kiss... no more. We are just two friends who happened to kiss." she said, although she knew that this sentence was inconsistent with her real thoughts on the matter.
They were now flying side to side, lightly pushing each other around.
Luckily, the pain of leaving Hogwarts was mitigated by the stay at the Weasleys' for the Summer.
But, he had to admit, that he was the one to save his life, not his father, in the end.
"Oh this must be them!" Said Ron, after he heard a loud "pop" coming from the entrance hall.
"Hi Ron, Mione!" Harry greeted them.
He was standing in front of the fireplace, tapping on the armrest impatiently.
Draco's jaw stayed dropped for the whole time it took Harry to eat the baked treat.
"Has Harry found a replacement yet?" Ginny asked bluntly.
"Ok, Harry. But only one minute." The half giant nodded, then he left to say goodbye to some other students.
"I'm going to act like this Adrian guy had an evil twin." said Harry.
Draco sank his body into the bubbly water and suddenly felt all the tension he had built up fade. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the border of the tub.
"Pansy, I am so, so sorry." The blond boy put his hands on her shoulders. "But it would never work between us, for I am gay. And there's nothing I can do about it."
***********************************
"Come on, baby, join us!" Luna shouted.
Ginny continued her screams of joy. "Stella Thompson is a terrific seeker! She's my second favourite player!"
He remembered her insufferable giggle as she'd play with Harry's hair. Now, there she was, congratulating him for accepting to marry her ex boyfriend.
He didn't really feel like trusting her right away.
As the game continued, Ginny found that she and Luna were both competing for first prize.
"No!" Draco screamed in desperation. This was it, his life would have ended in a matter of seconds.
And Draco didn't really feel like getting his boyfriend into trouble, so his idea consisted in avoiding the subject.
"But we don't know where they are!" Draco whined.
He would have never been able to get Lucius and Narcissa to greet Harry this way. He felt it was so unfair.
In the days that followed it, he couldn't help feeling a mixture of excitement and terror, as the Big Day was getting closer and closer.
"Actually, that was my mother's idea... She said she's willing to put the past behind now that you're Harry's boyfriend." Ron said. "Although, my dad doesn't know yet..."
When the two girlfriends saw Ron and Hermione again, they screamed of joy and almost tackled them to the ground.
Meanwhile, Jean Jacques Germain, the person who had caused all of this shit, was nowhere to be found. It was like he had vanished in the air.
It was a ring. It was made of gold and it sported a ruby.
That boy had completely changed his views regarding the school. Maybe it was the simple fact of him being there that was able to turn it into a pleasant experience.
He didn't regret talking like this to him, not one bit.
That was not quite what Draco expected. The Weasleys weren't so fond of him, to say the least. Arthur Weasley had his fair share of discrepancies with Lucius, so he didn't think that he would have welcomed him into his home with open arms.
He was shaving the muggle way, as he thought it was easier than the magical way. That was the only good thing that his uncle Vernon had taught him, he reckoned.
"Yeah, so, how can I fix this, babe?" asked a struggling Luna, who was struggling with keeping the broom still.
Not much later, after Ginny and Luna had been picked up by Xenophilius, Hermione saw her grandmother in the distance. "There she is!" she exclaimed, then she waved at her.
"How did you know the password to this bathroom?" Draco asked. Last time he'd checked, Harry wasn't a prefect. But then he considered that his closeness to Ron and Hermione might have played a part in it.
Her behaviour had been the same as her husband's, she had been no better than him.
"You're right, I was a piece of shit, but this doesn't mean you can go out and smooch that... that..."
"You can't force that upon me, father. You can't expect me to just go back home and forget everything after you and mother have completely ignored my existence for months." Draco said bitterly. "Also, these people now are my friends. And Harry is my boyfriend."
She didn't mind that her ear gloves had just fallen away from her.
Harry extended his hand for Draco to hold. "Come on, Draco. Don't be a chicken. It will be fun, I promise."
The bird was holding a letter firmly into his beak, its envelope was red. There was no doubt as to what it was: a howler.
If he kept him on his good side, if he was able to please him enough, Lucius would reward him with expensive gifts, like new brooms or antiques.
"Hey sis!" Ron greeted her. He was walking funny, she noticed. "Don't mind my walk, I fell on ice and landed on my tailbone." He then sat next to her, flinching slightly.
In the meantime, a determined Ginny Weasley was running to the dungeons, aimed at the Slytherin common room. She looked around for a bit until she found her person of interest. "Parkinson, wait up!"
"I feel the same." said Harry, as his eyes began to leak hot tears. He was now sure that the answer would have been positive.
His son pushed him away violently.
"Oh, wow and which one is he?" asked Harry, eying the Slytherin table.
His trusting habits needed to change, he wasn't going to fall for his mother's pleas.
When school had started eight years prior to that moment, the two friends never would have thought that their goodbye would be tearful. If anything, Hermione had always thought it would be relief.
Ron and Draco learned that muggle restaurants had a paper menu instead of the drawn-in-the-air-one. They also had many waiters. No one would have their trays fly above their hards, they only carried them by hand.
Hermione sighed, but it was Ron who spoke. "It just takes a bit of getting used to, that's all. But, Harry, do be careful with those exchanges. You don't want the whole school to see..."
Luna was not over the apparition yet, as she was jumping around contentedly.
Right after dinner, Mrs Weasley pulled out a heavy, old set of Wizard's Chess out of a box. As she placed it on the table, it blew dust everywhere.
"It's not just now. I never really got over my parents' rejection, babe." Draco sighed. "I've been hurting about it, mostly when I was alone."
Draco froze in horror as he heard his roommate drop his accent.
"You're such a pussy." said the blond boy, wiping a tear from Harry's eye.
Hugo was really chill with his aunts, even if he didn't see them too often.
"See, my mother isn't so bad." Draco happily observed, pushing his boyfriend playfully forward as they stepped on the soft grass.
What Hermione would have missed the most were the classes.
"Of me." the blonde said, finishing the sentence for her. "I noticed how you look at me, Gin Gin. "
********
"Excellent, boy. We'll talk this evening again." said Lucius.
When Harry set foot in the Great Hall, the first thing he did was run to his fiancè, who was already standing there next to Luna.
"Oh, right, I never make efforts." Harry scoffed. "Because I didn't go out of my way to invite you to spend Christmas with a family who most definitely hated you, so that you wouldn't spend it here, alone!"
Ginny had to share her bedroom with Luna, so they slept in the same bed, Luna sporting a provocative position now and again. She was determined to seduce her, it seemed. But Ginny fought her urges.
"But she is my sister, Harry!" Ron said.
"I don't know how you can just forget about our good times, the Quidditch championships... and just say this. Did you even love me or did you only care about the way I made you appear? " said Draco, trying to ignore the lump in his throat.
"I'm all ears."
"Explain what the hell this is." his father said, referring to the article.
"Don't." he said to him. "You don't want to get in any more trouble."
Ron blinked, hardly believing his ears. He had not gotten used to the fact that this was Draco Malfoy. The same Draco Malfoy who had bullied him for years... was now in his home, sitting on his brother's bed, giving him advice while Harry was on his lap.
That night, the Room of Requirement was occupied by Luna and Ginny, who needed it for a thorough research on Wrackspurts.
"I didn't want to ruin our happy moments." Draco explained.
"Hold him, Lucius." the woman said in a croaked voice.
Ever since she had met him, she thought he looked familiar.
"I agree with her!" said Ron. "Harry is my best friend, as well as my brother, and I am happy to 'deliver' him in the hands of this bloke right here. They are one of those couples that you look at thinking 'man, this is true love'! And besides, they are two of the most important people in my life. I love you so much, guys!" He, too, was weeping lightly.
A woman, who must have been the French Minister, was sitting next to a flamboyant looking man, who was dressed in a purple suit. He had a fuchsia feather boa around his neck-everyone identified him as head of Magical Games.
Ginny's frantic hands removed Luna's "L" jumper, leaving her in her bra.
"What? Can't you see how much potential there is between us? The fire.."
Pansy must have thought that the guy was just a random muggle, but, turned out, he was a Quidditch player, disguised as a foreign exchange student. He was probably just exploring the muggle world, just like the gang had done for Easter.
The six of them were all outside the Burrow, now.
The Slytherin was suddenly run over by a spiral of memories.
Ginny, at the sight of the applauding people, felt as if she had made a mistake in her plan. She turned to Pansy, her face showing a disappointed look. "I don't understand... why is everyone clapping their hands?" She wondered.
"Was it in your bedroom, Ginny?" Harry asked.
He was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, when his room mate moved his drapes open.
But who could he ask that would keep it a secret?
Ginny gave her a dirty look. "Well, Thanks for reminding me... Oh,I really want them to pay. Here's what I'm going to do..." The Weasley girl said as they were entering the greenhouse.
"Anyone but me, uh, Draco? " Pansy whined. She has always had a crush on him and found it rather unfair that he would go checking out everyone else but her.
He was going to prove to Harry that he had been 100% genuine regarding their relationship.
"Come on, e'ryone! It's time ter go now, for real!" Hagrid's  booming voice called.
If Ginny hadn't stopped her, she would have broken that guy in two.
Just like he had done that time, the Gryffindor tried to whisper calming words into the Slytherin's hair, as he cried so hard that his whole body shook.
From there, the castle looked so massive, so magical.
"I don't think I am." he said. "Harry would murder him if he knew."
When the two of them went back to the Great Hall, they were cornered by Blaise and Goyle.
"I'll warn you, though. I'm not gonna use those pet names Gryffindors are so fond of. Clear?"
"Me too." said Harry, closing his eyes contentedly.
He could read his anger from where he was standing.
Draco didn't notice him at first. When he did, he froze. He looked into those marvelous emerald green eyes. He would get lost into them upon initial glance, they were his weakness.
Pansy grabbed the door by its handle and slowly pushed it open. She was not prepared for what she saw when she did: Draco, her longtime crush, had his arms wrapped around his so called rival, Harry Potter, and they were kissing passionately. The girl's mouth dropped open.
But it had been long overdue.
"Oh no, dear. Please, walk with me outside of this... area." His mother suggested.
"Holy fucking shit!" Pansy shouted, her hand still on the door.
It being a mixed wedding, meaning that muggles, too, would be attending, there couldn't be too many magic tricks and it had to be in a muggle location, in order for all the guests to reach the place.
"I will never forget you, Harry Potter. You've been a hero to me and reason why now I believe in myself." When he had said that, Harry had not been able to suppress a sob.
They were acting a little too sweet to each other, for them to be friends.
Not that Harry cared about it, of course.
"Did you take a picture of us with that camera?" Harry asked, getting up to get closer to Ginny, who nodded with a smirk.
"Ok, now you will tell me what's bothering you." He demanded.
At dinner, things didn't seem to ease up for the two of them.
"I thought punctuality was his forte." Lucius snorted.
Everyone moved to the living room, where Fleur was meticulously setting an ornament on the Christmas tree. It was a snow ball containing a small replica of the Beauxbatons castle.
"I swear, you will kill me one day. You gave me a massive scare out here. Now, I want to marry you even more than I did before." said Harry, once he recollected himself.
What was he doing, thinking Potter was cute? He had said it himself: they wouldn't be a cute couple. But what could he do about it? He was still incredulous, he thought that maybe it had just been a dream and it played tricks on his mind, making him think that he had woken up while he was still asleep...
"I'm sorry I called you a mudblood..." Draco said, looking down. He couldn't believe he had just apologized. Slytherins did not apologize. He still shook her hand, though.
As soon as Ginny heard their voices, she sped to where they were standing and pulled them both into a hug.
Draco and Harry, though, were beginning to suspect that something was off between them.
"Hi, Fleur!" Ron said, blushing instantly. He was looking at her with dreamy eyes and his mouth dropped, waving his hand like a fool.
Their friendship had not always been an easy ride, but they cared for each other, deeply.
"But-" Pansy tried to argue, but she was shushed immediately by McGonagall's worst death stare.
"Babe, wait!" said, Harry, running after his boyfriend.
"We didn't exactly buy your change of heart, Narcissa..." said the Hogwarts Headmistress.
"Hello, everyone." she said, taking out a small piece of parchment from her pockets. She began reading shortly after. "Firstly, I feel I'm obliged to thank our Headmistress, Professor McGonagall, who made this school livable again. Also, she has been a very important figure for me among teachers. Secondly, I must thank our fallen professors, Dumbledore and Snape, whose sacrifice will not be forgotten. But mostly, I have to thank the school itself for giving a young Hermione Granger a chance to study its wonderful subjects!" When she was done talking, she had to wipe several tears. Professor McGonagall was in the same situation. Hermione's words had moved her to an extent.
Harry was now certain that he had been honest and what he had told him was the most beautiful thing someone had ever said to him.
"I don't know." She replied, not knowing what to think.
All Quidditch matches had been canceled as a consequence of the weather, much to Harry's relief, as he had not yet found a replacement for Ginny.
It was Ginny's turn to speak, now. "So, um... I haven't always been a fan of this couple, but they're definitely soul mates, I found." She said, beaming.
"Harry, we've talked about this. No dueling, ok? You don't want to be expelled when there's only three months left of school!" Hermione admonished.
"Aw, that's so cute, actually!" said Hermione, resting her head on Ron's shoulder. "I'll never leave you lonely anymore."
"It's about your parents, isn't it?" Said Harry.
Harry had a special thing organised for that day, but he didn't say what it was.
"I don't know," the brunette sighed, "Ho do you think your brother would react?"
This was it. They were going to come out to their friends and anxiety spiraled through their bodies. Ginny didn't know why she was scared, after all there was already a diverse couple in their group, but, for some reason, she was not completely calm.
Draco was crying, too. But, unlike Harry, he was able to speak.
Soon, it was Ron's turn to speak.
He had been slightly shocked because of it, but he had chosen not to tell anyone that he knew about it.
said Lucius, stretching his arm so that his son could take his hand.
He wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, pulling their bodies closer together.
Draco sighed. He'd been hoping that his boyfriend would magically appear at his dorm -he had told him the password, after all- and whisk him away, begging him for forgiveness.
"And then you bite." Harry continued, biting his slice ferociously.
Also, the muggle location was the best choice to avoid unwanted press.
"Last time it was 'nothing' you and Harry didn't speak for a month. So, tell me what this is all about!" said Ron, close to losing his temper.
After Narcissa left- her send-off including a very awkward group hug- the couple found themselves walking back to the castle.
"What with Mal- what?"
"May Slytherin win." Draco said to his boyfriend, while he shook his hand.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him. "I volunteer to apparate with them." she said, then she walked to the girls. Ginny was visibly tense as she saw her approach.
In that moment, Luna's girlfriend rushed into the bathroom. "Mione? Are you alright?" she asked, out of breath.
Luna linked her arm with hers, smiling. "I love apparating. It's so cool, it makes you feel like you're stuck in a vortex of fun."She said. The bushy haired girl giggled at her excitement.
"Oh Thank God!" Hermione pulled her friend into a tight hug, then she moved her attention to Draco. "Draco! Are you Ok? Are you hurt?" she cried out in a worried tone, all while taking his face in her hands.
Harry and Draco were treated the same, receiving the guest room.
They were going to face this, together, no matter what it took.
When the pair exited the greenhouse, Draco followed them.
You are being brainwashed by Potter's lot, we demand that you drop this act and sort out your priorities, if you care about your family.
"Well..." Draco sighed. "I have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to share this Holiday with you. Without you, I would have been miserable... but you made it perfect. How is it that you always make everything better?"
Hermione's eyes narrowed and her neck turned red, she gave the impression that she was on the verge of exploding. But, just as her lips parted to speak, she started looking ill.
The Slytherin girl looked like she had been slapped across the face. "No, Draco, I am done! I will get to the source of your strange behavior and everyone else will know, too." Having said that, the girl went back to her cauldron. "You just try." Draco said, more to himself than to her.
He and Harry could have said "I do" in their pajamas, for all he cared.
Therefore, they could only do the side-along apparition.
"Get. Lost. Now." Harry ordered, putting himself in front of his boyfriend, shielding him with his body.
Draco simply nodded.
"I'm starting to think you're right about that..." Draco sighed.
The Slytherin took it, giving him half a smile.
"Here is where an eleven-year-old Draco entered as a spoiled brat and where he left as an enriched person, thanks to some amazing people. Thank you Hogwarts!"
The other boy nodded frantically. He pressed his body on Draco's backside, causing him to flinch with anticipation. "Oh, yeah..." the blonde whispered. He gripped his hips firmly, then he took his pants and boxers off, exposing the boy's ass to the cool air. His eyes fell on a bottle that had conveniently appeared on the bed, lube. He dipped a finger in its liquid and then slipped it in the other boy's entrance. "Oh, Potter!" Draco cried out. Harry smirked as he added another finger, which made Draco whimper loudly. "Oh! Fuck me!"
As the momentary euphoria of alcoholic beverages kicked in, all the people in the room joined forces to lift the couple in the air and having them crowd surf.
He should have just left him in the fire. Now, he would be dead and Harry wouldn't be in this much pain over him.
"I'm not defending him! It was just a supposition. But don't worry, I would never cheat on you. Hell, I even used Protego on my bed so that he wouldn't be able to replicate his action."said Draco. He was starting to lose his temper.
Harry Bloody Potter could see everything, there was no way Draco could ever keep his feelings to himself. Not when it came to him.
"Oh, it could be symbolic? Or they could marry somewhere where it is permitted? Don't spoil this, son!" Molly reprimanded.
"Worry not, you will see her soon. Why spoil New Year's? When you meet again, you will have a lot of cool stories to tell." Draco reassured, giving him a comforting smile.
"Having to share the bedroom with Jean Jaques is rather, um, horrendous." said Draco, grimacing. Jean Jaques was beginning to make him miss his old room mates. And that said a lot.
She even had a cage full of those flying creatures, who were constantly shining a light.
"Enough with this disgusting crap!" Blaise's voice boomed. "That should be banned!"
Hagrid had been invited, too, but, given his ongoing beef with Draco, he chose not to attend.
The blond boy held her into a tight hug. He didn't even mind her tears all over his coat.
"And why didn't you find the Room of Requirement?" Ginny asked Luna. They were still working on the project from the night before.
Draco lay down so that Harry was now on top of him, not breaking the kiss.
"I wonder how it is that he didn't touch Pansy at the hair salon."
"Me too, but I think you already know." Draco said, referring to the Daily Prophet scandal.
His was grey, with a green "D" on top. The whole ensemble suggested Slytherin.
"Took you long enough to realize, eh? Only 7 years." Draco said, shaking his head.
"Oh, now I'm even more nervous! He will totally kick me out." Draco muttered in his hands.
"At least he doesn't talk in his sleep or moves uncontrollably. Next time, I will kick you." Said Draco, suppressing a sneer.
"I suppose that counted as a consolation prize." said Draco.
The bartender kept her death stare. She left mocking Narcissa.
Not replying to the boy next to him, he brought himself down on the mattress, facing the curtains. Tears were still streaming down his rosy cheeks.
"I'd say this was a mistake." Said Harry, as they had fallen silent after their second kiss. Draco rolled his eyes. "You're the one who launched yourself at me, Mr 'this was a mistake'!"
"Oh, Neville.. no, you shouldn't." Harry said, bending down to look at him. "What they did to you was atrocious and they will pay for it." he extended his hand for the other boy to hold.
"Same."Luna said. "People are cruel. And your little game in the Great Hall probably didn't help. I suspect the Wrackspurts had infested your brain that day." She continued, firmly convinced of her theory.
She got up from her chair to give them both a one arm hug, together with two air kisses.
"Fuck you, Malfoy!" Harry yelled at the blonde boy. All Draco did in response was smile. Yeah, Potter, Fuck me, was Draco's thought.
Luna and Ginny's kiss was unnoticed.
"And Rrron! My brother in law!" She greeted him with a sound kiss on the cheek.
"Everyone calm down, ok? No ONE is gonna die! Stop blaming each other and crying over spilled milk! Right now all we need to do is ACT. And we must do it fast!" said Hermione, bringing some sense into all of them. Hermione truly was the brightest witch for her age.
"Oh, right, hi, Malfoy." Bill said, no emphasis whatsoever. "So it's true, then? You're together?"
"What, then?" Ginny asked, feeling nervous.
When her mum saw Hermione, she was setting a plate of decorated hard boiled eggs next to the roses.
Now, he was sure that their whole relationship had been part of a sick plan, Malfoy style. How could he have been so blind? It was all clear to him now.
Ron followed suit.
Her blouse fluttered as she did so. That earned her a glare from Luna, as she had risked exposing her body.
Ron's eyes widened at the realization. "Oh no, Harry, I'm the one who told her that you were there together, but I didn't think...Oh Merlin!" He put his hands in his hair in guilt and frustration.
His father's face suggested shock. He couldn't believe what his son had just said to him. He never thought that he could ever speak to him in such manner, it seemed.
"Happy Birthday, gay daughter!" Draco chortled.
"I hardly believe this, the four of us, together, at the same table, with no wands out." Ron said with a grin.
Talking  about the weather was always a good way to deal with awkward silences.
It couldn't have ended a better way.
Molly was almost sobbing, hugging her husband as he, too, shed a tear.
"Well, where were we? Ah, I had just asked Mr Ronald Bilius Weasley and Harry James Potter if they agreed to take Miss Hermione, in Ronald's case, and Mr Draco, in Harry's, as their lawfully wedded spouses." The fairy lady picked up from where she had left off.
"You're ridiculous. " Draco hissed. "If I'd wanted to, I would have done it already, don't you think? But I pushed him away because I happen to be dating you."
"Oh, I'm sorry! But, you know I suck at keeping secrets." Pansy said, in her defence.
"Wow, they are not so bad." Draco said, wearing his jumper. "It keeps me very warm."
"Mmm, if you say so." Harry muttered. He suddenly looked upset. It wasn't like Harry to be like this, not around his friends and boyfriend.
She had been holding back after their kiss, thinking that, maybe, she didn't really have feelings for Luna, but, looking at her being all cute and, well, Luna, she thought differently.
"Yeah, I heard you cry at night, sometimes, because of Hedwig!" said Ron.
It was weird to think that only months before he'd found her the most annoying person in the world.
Harry's paranoid thoughts weren't really senseless, after all.
"Of course it is... " said Draco, fighting his urge to slap him.
"Happy now, Arthur?" Molly said in a reprimanding tone.
He was right, once again.
"No... Luna, I think I might be pregnant." Hermione finally breathed.
Ginny suddenly felt a weird feeling of warmth invade her chest, then her face, which became red. Must have been the effect of the Butterbeer, she thought, although she wasn't sure of it herself. Did she enjoy compliments from Luna a little too much?
Ginny was also very excited to see her nephew, little Hugo, who was now six months old.
His boyfriend gripped his shoulder for balance as he felt like he was going to fall from the bed, headfirst onto the floor.
"Well, I won at other things."said Draco, giving him a suggestive smile.
"...but you'd never get the memo, you fool." Draco went on.
He wondered if he had made the right decision.
Suddenly, their peace and quiet was interrupted by a loud thump coming from the chimney.
But Draco was past that, such behaviour wouldn't bother him anymore.
They had been humiliated in front of the whole school, yet that had not been enough to sever said bond.
Oh, the joy of young love. Such a pure feeling.
"I'm confused, Mione... But don't worry, there's no chance I'll ever be with Draco."
"Harry, wait!" She called to him, but he didn't seem to care. "Please, don't walk away! We loved each other once!"
Since the visitors were divided in groups of six, all friends were able to enter together.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look.
"... even though you'd find an unabated enjoyment in making me jealous, with Krum..." Ron continued, making Hermione look down.
"Were you checking out Granger?"
Harry said, as his lips parted from Draco's. He was incredibly proud of him for doing so.
The line went Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna on the right side of the table, while on the left side sat Molly, Percy, George, Angelina, Bill and Fleur. Arthur was the head of the table, sitting between his wife and Harry.
"Don't mind them, Harry." Hermione said.
"Good."said Jean Jacques.
"Yeah, a master of embarrassment, you mean." Draco snapped back.
They would have done the countdown in the garden, as they were going to watch magic fireworks, courtesy of George.
"Oh, sure." said Draco, stretching his arms to take the container from her hands.
As Hermione and her mum sat on the chairs, the daughter noticed someone she knew sitting three seats from her.
"Go Ginny! Go Gryffindor!" Luna cheered, she was in the Gryffindor bleachers, wearing her famous Lion Hat.
Even Ron was becoming suspicious of Harry's next move.
"You can study your stuff with us!" Hermione suggested. The red haired girl seemed to consider the offer for a second but then opted to do her research for the sixth year with Luna.
"There's only one way to find out..." Hermione said, looking around the room. "Harry, where do you keep that map of yours?" she asked her friend.
Her whole body shook as her orgasm dangerously threated to take over her.
"Oh, she's so beautiful!" Hermione's mother chanted, holding her husband's hand as he sat next to her.
"...Harry and I had been suspecting it for, like, two months." said Draco, smiling.
"Then, you are no son of mine, not anymore." Lucius snapped.
She had at least four rings on her hands. The light in the room made a ruby on one of her rings shine as she waved her hand to the pair, motioning for them to sit with her.
The whole room smelled like a combination of jasmine and lavender fragrances, evoking a calming effect on the people who entered it.
Draco shifted his head slightly, so that he could face him. "I am totally fine, really. I've given up on him. His acceptance is something I will never get." he said, sighing. "I'll just have to go on and come to terms with a life without a family."
"Behave." Ginny said to her brother, while grinning. "Don't traumatize those muggles."
That Sunday a Quidditch match was in order, Gryffindor vs Slytherin.
Ron had a point. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but he was interrupted by Miss Sivan's voice. "Come see how you did, this time." she said, then with a swift movement of her wand she made a grade sheet appear.
As they reached the classroom, they were greeted by a smiling Slughorn.
"Be careful, if you don't want your pants to catch fire!" he said, trying to suppress a sneer.
"1999!" Everyone shouted.
When the oldest of the three girls pulled away, everyone else pulled them into a group hug.
"Oh, I see... he's just a bit...goofy, I don't want to say a bad word." Mrs Granger said as she folded the cream colored napkins. "Are you sure he can provide everything you need?"
********************************
If anyone tried to get close to Mrs Malfoy, they would get petrified or stunned by Neville.
"What is he doing?' asked Luna, naively, as her girlfriend's brown eyes widened in shock.
Harry knew, though, that it would have been impossible for them to be completely clueless, since the whole school knew about it.
"I'm just not hungry. I'll go to bed. If you'll excuse me." That said, she rose to her feet and left without saying no more.
"Oh Ron, how am I going to live without seeing you eat like a pig every day?"
The black haired boy suddenly twirled him around, making a circle in the ice. Draco had to hold on to him to avoid falling head first into the ice. "Are you out of your mind?" he yelled.
"You know what, Luna... I feel bad for Malfoy. I never thought I'd say this but he didn't really deserve to be thrown out of his home."she said, still looking down.
"...we talked to the headmistress and, since your situation is unlike any..." Ginny continued.
Ginny suddenly lightened up, "Oh, but that's great!" she exclaimed.
*********************
The large wooden table was dressed in a pink cloth, the 'Easter cloth', as the Grangers called it.
"I am finally free, father. The price to pay, though, is to live without a real family. It hurts, but I will manage." he said, glancing at his boyfriend.
As already anticipated, that night Harry and Draco communicated via fire.
Her red stained lips were letting out a sigh, while her shaky fingers put her hair behind an ear.
He tried to say something, but Draco shut him up with a gesture of his hand.
Ginny pulled away from her girlfriend, then she summoned a knife and began slicing the pastry the way her sister in law instructed.
Hermione had never cried this hard out of happiness in her whole life before.
"What? Are you sure?" She asked.
Dechampes was the one who scored the most points.
Ginny was still incredulous, but she couldn't help letting out a joyful laugh.
"Oh Crap! What time is it?" Draco said. He sat up suddenly. "Tempus!" He muttered and gasped as he read '10:00am'. "Oh no, Draco! We missed our first classes! And we'll be late for potions!"
Hermione looked at her dad with widened eyes. " How do you know about it?"
She was sitting next to Hermione, who had brought two pairs of binoculars.
Everyone received their own Weasley Christmas jumper, even Draco, much to his surprise.
In the last two months, she and Draco had developed a friendship filled with funny bickerings and teasing.
"Just what happened the day after under the tree, us kissing." Harry admitted.
"Ginny," Hermione interrupted her. "I don't know if you know this, but Draco's family has just disowned him, because of you. So, if I were you, I wouldn't show my face around here."
Harry proceeded to open it as fast as a kid would.
He felt blinding rage come over him at the sound of those appalling words.
Hermione cleared her throat. "Zabini was so incredibly obnoxious, don't you think?" She said, shifting the attention to herself.
Your beauty and kindness made me want to befriend you. I thought that, maybe, you could help me keep the nargles and other beasts away. Now, I can say that you did. After many years of loving you silently, we finally merged together and became the super cute lesbians we are now.
The taller boy pulled him into the most stringent hug they had ever shared, rubbing his back to soothe him.
Luna started jumping around excitedly, tugging on Ginny's dress.
"But.. what? Draco?" Lucius addressed to his son. "Is he serious? How can you do this to our family name? This is an outrageous insult! My son... an abomination!" He spat in an almost undertone. He was furious.
"Good girl!" said Luna, clapping her hands. "One point goes to Ginny!"
He watched as a tall guy walked in awkwardly, he was holding a black trunk in one hand, while he had a small flask in the other. Its label said "magical maladies remedy", it looked like it came straight from Saint Mungo's.
The Hollyhead Harpies Keeper wasn't really at the most of her forces, by the looks of it, as she was unable to stop the Quaffle from entering the hoops, multiple times.
"The worst two weeks of my life." Harry said, in all honesty.
They had made history in Hogwarts, not only by being the first openly gay couple in school, but also by opening people's minds.
"It doesn't matter now." said Draco in a monotone voice.
"No, we are going to sleep tonight." said Harry, sternly. Then, he made his way to his dorm, not telling Draco to come with him.
"No!" Ginny shouted, then she pulled her hand out of Harry's grasp. "Pansy! Lift the camera up in the air!"
"Yes, I know, I was there during her meeting with them." The voice in the fire said. "I do think that Potter has begun to suspect something is fishy with you, Mrs Malfoy."
Ron and Hermione's mouths dropped open. Hermione covered hers, while Ron let out a loud gasp.
That wasn't a bad idea.
Harry couldn't believe the amount of butterflies that his boyfriend gave him, just by holding him close.
"Say, Dracó, can you introduce me to your friend there, a little spicy ginger!" The french guy said, looking captivated.
Oh the cruel touch of Karma...
And the rest is history.
Oh dear Merlin and any other wizard. Was his lunatic of a boyfriend going to dance on the damned lake with these ridiculous muggle shoes?
"Hello, everyone!" Said George and Angelina in unison.
Even Neville congratulated the pair. "I heard it was a beautiful proposal." he added.
"Oh, dear, Mione, are you Ok?" Harry questioned as he noticed it.
The wedding would be officiated by none of other than the most beloved teacher in Hogwarts, Adrastea Sivan.
"Did you cheat on Harry?" asked a still enraged Ron.
"I can't believe this is our last day." he sighed after drying his hair with a movement of his wand.
"Not really,"said Draco. "I suppose if you had kept your mouth shut, maybe, Harry wouldn't have overheard you babbling about the Jean Jacques thing."
The six friends all descended the stairs, headed for the VIP Tent.
"Shut up, Potter!" said Draco, slapping his face playfully.
"I know that, silly." Draco purred. "Althought I'm shocked that a Gryffindor like you isn't willing to have some outdoor fun. I thought your kind was known for being adventurous." He joked.
"I love you." he whispered.
"Oh, will you stop being so mistrusting? Relax for once!" the Slytherin voiced.
It was now time for Luna to speak for her girlfriend.
"Get out of our spot, losers. We were here first!" Draco said to the three of them, eyes on Potter.
"If I'm fine with it, of course, my sweet!" Said Molly, putting a motherly hand on her daughter's. "Don't tell your dad, but before I had him... I had my fair share of experiences with girls."
Luna was wearing the dress she had worn when they got together, it was black with blue abstract figures drawn all over. She had one of the blue gloves as a necklace - there were two holes and inside of it ran a silver chain.
"Tell you what, if my brother ever tries to leave you, I will kick his nuts!" The redhead reassured.
"He's... he's great! Thank you!" Harry said to the three of them, wiping a tear. "Thanks, babe, I love you." he then said to Draco.
The couple was waiting for someone to show up in their fire, by the looks of it.
Then, the rest of the gang said hi to him as well, except Ginny and Luna, who were in their own little world, giggling and being cute.
Harry couldn't remember the last time he had been this satisfied. It felt so good, almost soothing.
And Ron rarely saw things. But when he did...boy, was he right.
"A nightmare!" said Draco, pulling his head back, frustrated.
"But, they're like my family! I'm sure they wouldn't mind. I know that there's always been a lot of hate between your family and theirs, but hey, it's Christmas." Harry explained, but Draco wasn't convinced just yet.
The Headmistress ordered for everyone to go back to their seats and continue with their meal, then she turned around to speak to Harry and Draco and awarded them 25 points each for their bravery.
Now, Harry thought that he had been playing with his heart the whole time.
As soon as Jean Jacques saw the two boyfriends looking at each other that way, he took Draco's face in his hands and pulled him into a rough kiss.
"Must be 'ard, being the boyfriend of the Saviour of the World, eh?" Jean Jaques observed.
"Draco..." She said as she saw him walking by her.
Ginny and Luna were crying while holding each other, relieved that their friend's pregnancy had not been a disgrace, after all.
"Oh, that would be the Nargles, Draco." said Luna, suddenly sitting up, hitting Ginny's face with her hair.
Draco hated Harry for his ability to bring him to tears. Hell, he had been able to avoid crying through the whole of the confrontation with Lucius, yet, at Harry's words, his eyes rained teardrops like a British shower.
The brunette gave a giggle and fixed them for her. "Here."
"She's the apotheosis of anxiety." Draco whispered to his boyfriend.
"You, too." said Draco, giving him an Eskimo kiss. "Oh, he already had a name, though. He's called Viridis, if that's alright."
His girlfriend turned around to face him and with a death stare she finally spoke. "Ask him, if you want to know."
"Hermione Granger," Ron began, while taking his bride's hands into his "When I met you, I thought you were an obnoxious little know-it-all. Like, I really couldn't stand you! But then, years later, I finally realised that I was in love with that know-it-all."
Draco enclosed his bed in a protection charm, just to be safe. He didn't buy the whole 'innocent cuddling' thing in the littlest bit. He was sure, at this point, that it had been an attempt at seducing him. Jean Jacques must have had a problem with Harry, or he was very attracted to Draco.
"Thank you, baby." She said, as she climbed on the carriage. "I trust Harry on this, but Draco..." she gave her friend a look. Draco had never had anything to do with muggles, so he was a real beginner. She was worried that he would do something that would give them away.
"Just cuddle a teddy bear or something. I don't know if in France 'snuggling' consists in touching people's privates wearing only underpants," said Draco, moving further away from the other boy. "But here, it is downright creepy. And if you don't go back to your bed I will call the Headmistress."
If Hermione had been pregnant, she would have become an aunt. The thought made her feel excited, although she tried to conceal her enthusiasm- she didn't know whether the news would be positive for her brother or Hermione herself.
They risked losing everything because of a jealous, untrustworthy, girl who had disguised herself as an obnoxious foreigner.
Life had given him a second chance. It had granted him with a mountain of love and affection, only to later have it crumble right before his eyes.
They aimed upstairs, towards the Gryffindor common room. When they saw the fat lady, Harry blurted out "Lacuna!". She tried to argue against the presence of a Slytherin, but Harry shushed her before she could protest any further.
"Why didn't you ever tell me about it? There should be no secrets between us." Said Harry, slightly upset.
"... And you're free to sleep in my dorm, just like I am free to sleep in yours." Harry concluded, smiling brightly. "Whenever we please."
"I did this just for you. I mean I know she's better than your dad, but... Are you sure she's completely honest with you?" Said Harry, expressing his concerns.
"My name is Draco. Malfoy." Draco said, extending his hand for him to shake.
"I think Harry is in here with Malformed." said Hermione.
He had grown accustomed to lying to him, lately.
Ron and Ginny accepted the hug invitation.
Harry had saved him, not just physically, he had given a meaning to his life.
"Dark Magic!" Hermione exclaimed. "How can they say something like this about homosexuality?" she continued. She was appalled, to say the least.
" Get him." Mrs Malfoy ordered sternly, sitting back in her chair and smiling wickedly.
While looking for a beautiful ring to add to my collection, I was congratulated by the seller for your wedding. I was confused at first, but then he told me that Mr Potter had bought the engagement ring right there, in his shop."
"Lucky I have this dame to save me!" She said dramatically, putting her arms around her neck.
"Surprise." Mr Malfoy said in a faux calm tone.
In that spare second, they held hands.
The first month and a half was spent calmly, in a routine of comfort and games.
"Twenty points each from the four of you!" said Miss Sivan. "And go back to work, you two." She said, addressing Draco and Harry.
"Yeah, I'm Ok, not one scratch." Harry said, giving her a reassuring smile.
"I'm so sorry, Harry! They threatened me... to kill my grandma if I wouldn't help them with their plan! I never meant to hurt you... oh, man, I should go to Azkaban, too!" the boy said in the grip of his sobs.
Draco and Harry were sitting opposite the straight couple.
He needed some air, as the thought of this father was enough to make him incredibly anxious. He was sure that he would have had a panic attack if he had stayed in that bed. So, he slowly lifted Harry's arm and went on to slither out of his grasp.
Harry had never made her feel like that just by kissing her on the neck. Now she was sure that she didn't like boys, at all.
Draco got up from the black leather sofa he was sitting on and walked closer to the entrance to the Common Room.
He was on his way to Breakfast with Pansy, the morning after.
"Oh, no worries, darling." said Mrs Malfoy, gently. "The plan is going smoothly, from up here."
The Great Hall fell silent. Some students were exchanging looks, some of them were looking at Draco and Harry, but no one dared say a word. The two of them just stood there, next to each other, unable to produce a sound. Harry wasn't scared, but he was still shocked that Ginny could ever do something like this to him. Additionally, he was aware that his boyfriend was having an internal break down.
"You know nothing!"Harry said, in a rage. Now, this moron was crossing a line. He rose to his feet, ready to fight the douche.
"Maybe. But I'll admit that you might have a point. I know a place that is much better. I can show you the way." Draco whispered in his ear. Then, he licked his earlobe.
"Ah, Potter, I'll say it again" Mr Malfoy addressed him, livid. "You find pleasure in ruining families, don't you? My son had never felt anything towards other males, before you. You somehow put it into his head. Did you use a love potion, perhaps?"
"What the hell is Neville doing in your room now?" an annoyed Hermione asked her boyfriend.
Draco kept silent, still. Harry had a point. "I need you, Draco. Like you need me. Not just physically."
She said goodbye to Harry by lightly pecking him on the lips. "See you at dinner, babe. I love you." She said with a smile. "Love you Ron and Mione!" Then she left to go to the library.
"Yeah then you went to get confused with Harry, who is literally, the gayest wizard ever." Luna observed.
She didn't know how to react, although the fact that her boyfriend was calling her his 'one true love' couldn't be a bad sign.
Out of the four pairs of eyes, none was dry when the boys formed a group hug.
Hermione took a deep breath, all while her eyes were shut.
Their ride was the French version of the knight bus, the Magicobus, which took them to Le Chaudron de la Sorcière.
Everyone else in the room congratulated the pair, then the dancing officially began.
"Oh, come on, Weasley. My friendliness might surprise you."
"Yeah, you did, but that's in the past. Don't bring this up again, Ok? This doesn't change the fact that you're the best part of Hogwarts. You beat classes and adventures by far." Said Harry in a stern voice.
There, in an extra large robe, stood...
She didn't know whether she should say hi, since they now had a mutual friend, but they didn't really see eye to eye.
"I won't!" Draco yelled to his dad. Then, he buried his face in Harry's neck and let out a sob.
Ginny couldn't be happier knowing that her mum was Ok with her being in love with a girl. She had spent months filled with anxiety, in fear that she wouldn't be accepted.
One morning, he had Herbology with the Gryffindors.
"Ah, here you are, my lovely boys!" Said Mrs Malfoy when they entered the bar.
"Don't you dare say speak ill of Harry! He is my family now. Hell, he has been more family in these months than you have ever been in nineteen years. And Ron, he gave me his house for two weeks. Yeah, the same people you taunted so much were fine with having me in their home."
Indeed, that was exactly how it turned out to be.
Also, for Luna's birthday in February, Ginny had kissed her on the cheek and given her flowers. And on Valentine's day they had gone to Madam Puddifoot's, instead of spending the day with their friends at the Three Broomsticks.
"I'd say this is not enough." Said Ron, looking disappointed.
It was Lucius Malfoy.
The plane trip had been terrible for its first timers, who were everyone but Hermione.
She got just the effect she had intended to receive, as every student was done clapping and shouting.
"For they're jolly good fellas!" the tipsy crowd chanted.
Harry made a chair appear, just in time for Draco to fall right on it.
Draco nodded, but he wasn't so sure that doing nothing was the best option. In a matter of hours, his father would have heard the news and would have probably come to Hogwarts to harm him. The only thing that Lucius hated more than Mudbloods were the homosexuals.
But she felt that it would be a pity to burst Luna's bubble so quickly, so she played along.
Everyone watched, holding their breaths as the chessmen ruthlessly destroyed each other.
And then Pansy. Why the hell had he decided to become friends with her in the first place? She'd always had an enormous crush on him, which had made her so disgustingly attached to him.
How could she had done something this serious to a person that she had once loved? She could have been a mature girl and accepted Harry's detachment, maybe now they would have been friends. But no, she had to go and ruin everything out of jealousy.
"Woo! Happy New Year!" Ron screamed, clapping his hands at the sight of the Dragon-shaped fireworks.
Ginny immediately snapped out of her thoughts and her face turned crimson red.
"It begins!" said Luna, calling to the boys' attention. The House Cup winner would have been revealed.
"What are you saying? This is just brainwashing that this dirty homosexual performed! If you do not intend to drop this act, I will disown you." The oldest of the Malfoys in the room threatened.
No way. Ginny had never been more shocked in her life before. Malfoy? How could Harry, her man, have cheated on her with Draco Malfoy? She felt disgusted, to say the least. She was so shocked that she thought she would faint. This was a lot to take in. She sat so that she would steady herself, thus giving herself time to process the news she had just heard.
"Do you ever think before acting?" She said as she broke free from Harry's grip. "This is the same guy that gave me shit for being a muggle born!"
Draco looked up at him. He agreed with him , for once. "You have a point." he said.
"Oh, shit, Draco." Harry growled. He had forgotten how tight he was.
"I'm so nervous!" Ginny said, that day at breakfast.
"You, first." said Harry, putting his present in his boyfriend's hands.
The last day of school an outbreak of sadness spread throughout the people attending their final year.
Harry sighed, then he spoke, "Ginny, I'm really sorry if I hurt you. But, I figured it would be best to break up with you than actually cheat on you." He got up and walked over to her.
She wondered if the other girl's eyes had ever been more beautiful, two crystalline drops of silver.
"Slytherin scores!"
Draco sighed, then he hid his face in Harry's shoulder. "I suck at muggle things." he said.
"We felt so bad that we had to interrupt the girls' date for their month-and-a-half-and-a-weeks-aversary, but we needed them to warn the Hadmistress."
"These fairies thinking they can change the world." Blaise agreed.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you  marry me?"
"That garçon is worse than Draco was years ago!" Hermione grumbled. "Sorry, Draco, but you were an insufferable git."
"No worries," said Draco, as he sat opposite her, next to Harry. "Your friend here has taught me a few important guidelines to follow."
"Oh shit!" Draco exclaimed. He turned to Harry, hoping he had his invisibility cloak with him. "Quick, get that damned cloak of yours!" he ordered.
The Grangers had been informed, too.
He had to do this.
"Out of the way, Potter!" Draco spat jokingly, placing himself in front of him, thus cutting him off.
"I don't really care if he doesn't, honestly." Draco said, bitterly.
He wouldn't dare to meet his gaze, also, which generally wasn't a good sign.
Luna wasn't certainly used to calling everyone "Baby."
"Miss Parkinson, you have a day to gather all your things. Tomorrow, workers from the ministry will come pick you up."
"Mione..." Harry began. He was beginning to think that it wasn't a bad idea to have kissed Malfoy, it was a terrible one.
So, I forged Madame Maxime's signature and sent an owl to the Headmistress, saying that, any minute, one of their students would be transferring to Hogwarts. The letter expressively said to put the new student into Slytherin, as, down in Beauxbatons, he was in the French version of that house.
Not long after, he felt himself close to peaking, but he wasn't ready for it just yet.
"Let's hit them from here!" The brunette whispered in a loud tone, poking her head out of the hiding spot to get a glimpse of what was happening.
Harry slowly pulled the door open, then he entered the room timidly.
"Serves you right!" His girlfriend spat.
"Yeah I agree, you and I are better than anyone else, together." Luna smiled.
"Guys..." Harry said, then he took a breath. "You'll think me crazy, but... " he moved closer to them so that no one would over hear. "I think I might be falling in love with him."
"We're on the same page, if it can make you feel better, mate." Ron whispered back, chuckling nervously.
Ever since her Christmas apology, Ginny had formed a bond with the pair.
"It's so weird to think that this all started with Draco pushing Harry to the ground." Hermione pointed out.
The two boyfriends had not played against each other yet, not since their romance had blossomed, so they both took it as a fun challenge.
"This could be the right chance to clear things up." said Ron.
Luna and Ginny had just finished school at Hogwarts and they were still living at home with their respective parents.
Molly shook her head. "No, but I noticed something in the air was... different. And besides, mama knows best!"
"What the devil is going on?" Miss Sivan's voice said, echoing through the hallway. "Mr Malfoy, let go of Weasley! And Parkinson, put the wand down!" The woman rushed to the four of them, her cloak brushing the floor. "Do you all want detention?"
"To my brother, who used to hex me as a kid, testing his atrocities on me..."
Xenophilius spun Luna around, holding her from her back as she lifted her legs.
"Oh, Draco..." he said, looking at Molly, who nodded for him to continue. "I think I owe you an apology."
He had met the love of his life there, after all, and on his last year- his first and only 'calm year' at Hogwarts.
When he finished, his sister gave him the most loving look ever. "Thank you, I love you too!" she said, squeezing her brother's hand lightly.
Now, she knew that Ginny was going to 'make impossible happen' because she already knew how to do these things - at least, partly.
"Which face, this one?" Said Harry, maintaining his puppy face.
They were walking in the hallway, making their way towards the Thestrals that would have taken them to the station. They had all used Locomotion Charm on their trunks, so they were flying behind them.
She found it as a surprise to see her in the muggle world, as Slytherins never had muggleborns.
"Well, now that I think about it..." He lowered himself so that his mouth was on his boy's neck.
"Oh Merlin!" she screamed, throwing the object on the table. She covered her mouth with her hands and her eyes widened in surprise.
The sight was heartbreaking for Ron and Hermione. They watched as their new friend broke down in his boyfriend's arms because of his parents.
"Please Ginny, it's no one! Please calm down..." He tried to reassure her, but she wasn't having any of it.
"Ron, stop, I didn't fool anyone! I swear, Germain kissed me because he saw that Harry was looking!" Draco said, trying to push Ron away from him, but he wasn't strong enough.
Draco was glad that he was now spending little to no time in the Slytherin common room, for it was always so cold in the winter, due to it being located in the dungeons.
But, every rose had its thorn.
"This is where I can find some of the serum." He told the pair, then he meticulously looked through the shelves.
That made Ron and Hermione stop in their tracks.
Oh, Luna and her uncomfortable truths. Both components of the pair blushed furiously, although Ron was the reddest one. "Um... what are you doing here?" Hermione asked, avoiding the question. "Needed it for nargle studies. But can't, it's occupied." Luna said with a shrug.
Harry sat up from his heat to walk towards where Ginny was sitting, positioning himself behind her.
Because the Burrow had five bedrooms, each couple was granted their privacy, at least for the first night.
"Aren't they a bit too young, mum?" Percy wondered.
Luna seemed to think about it, then she sighed, relieved.
He had never thought, in the past, that he would ever be able to help someone in the process of being themselves. Yet, he had just participated in a couple's coming out. A new feeling invaded him, it was the idea of being a good person. And it was all because of the boy sitting next to him, his fiancé.
"Yeah, sure, 'sleep'." Luna giggled. "Someone is eager to have sex." she said, in one of her famously uncomfortable truths.
"Oh, come on!" Harry said, putting his arms around his lover's neck. "You know that my biggest crush was you."
When she took her first bite, she found out why.
"Treat him right." He said, in a fake stern voice. "Or else."
"Oh God, this feels so real, now. What if Ron leaves me after the baby is born?" She said, biting her nails nervously.
Harry sped up to the Snitch, his boyfriend doing the same.
The Weasley girl was put as head of the table, while the others all sat around her.
"I'm not in the mood for it, go away!" said Harry in a broken voice.
It didn't look like one of the Hogsmeade bars, it was bigger, warmer and it smelled like alcohol.
"Ron, look, I..." Harry began, but his friend interrupted him. "I wouldn't care if you were gay, Harry, but if you are to fool my sister... this is where I'm not fine with it." His voice was stern, Harry had never heard his mate speak like this to him before. He must have been very angry.
"So do I." Ginny murmured as she pulled Luna into yet another passion filled kiss.
"And I'm sorry I called you an evil loathsome little cockroach..." Hermione said."I hope this means we can be friends now."
"Ok, to Dracó, hope you reach your goals, Adrian Martin."
Draco finally got up and ran towards Ginny. He then tried to snatch her camera out of her hand, but the girl's grip was stronger than his.
Luna had a point, the two decided to not let that ruin their excitement.
"Boyfriend." Harry repeated with a smile. He really liked the sound of the word, it seemed.
At least, it made her see just how annoying she had been during her previous years.
Hermione could have been a life coach if she'd wanted to.
"You know, Jean Jacques reminds me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who.." Hermione observed.
"I don't know..." Draco murmured. His voice came out broken. He suddenly felt nauseous, his head was spinning as though he had been running around non-stop.
Harry noticed that his boyfriend was sweating, but he was proud of him for standing up to his father that way.
Ron pulled out a magical camera, which he used in self portrait mode to capture the exact moment in which his sister blew her 19 shaped red candle.
Hence, I had to make it that this guy had a rare illness, so that he would always have the flask on his person.
"Bye, Hagrid, we will miss you dearly." Said Hermione, through her tears.
That night, as Draco lay in bed next to a sleeping Harry, he thought that this had been the best Christmas of his life.
"I love you, brother!" He said to his best friend, smiling through the tears.
Molly had a very special New Year's Eve planned.
And so Harry told her all about it. Hermione wasn't the least bit surprised. "It was not a girl, but it was Malfoy." she shook her head. "Who is a ton times worse."
Later, Donald showed them where they would sleep.
"Morgan! Griffin! Ambers! June! Conrad and, last but not ze least, Seeker Thompson!"
"No complaining. You are lucky that you're not going straight to Azkaban. Your wand will be broken in half, now." the Headmistress continued, summoning the girl's wand.
She had waited so long for Ginny to finally see the light. She knew that their under-the-mistletoe kiss had moved something inside her, but this time Ginny had taken the initiative and Luna couldn't feel more euphoric.
Once again, it was so hard to hide things from him.
Luna and Ginny came outside, holding hands, jumping excitedly in anticipation.
The people in the room all looked at each other, then Luna got down on one knee.
He knew that, technically, he was breaking a law. Common rooms existed for a reason.
"Because I am." Draco replied. "I need you to follow me." He said, gulping.
There had been a misunderstanding, freaking Jean Jacques had formed a friendship with him just to forcefully kiss him in front of Harry when he had the chance.
The couple's destination was the lake. When they reached it, Draco looked at Harry with widened eyes. "What exactly do you think we are going to do on this frozen lake?"
She would give him pitiful looks, saying how sorry she was for his breakup.
Molly cheered, too, feeling proud of Harry. She had motherly instincts towards him so she felt as if yet another son would be tying the knot.
"I mean isn't he just so cute when he does that?" Harry said dreamily.
Harry walked towards his boyfriend, ready to overcome his pride and apologise.
The blond could only sigh in response.
"You are simply a nincompoop, is all you are." Draco teased.
"Eh, I told her to go to hell." Draco shrugged.
***********************************************************************************************
Harry sighed, circling his fiancé's back with his arms. "You're right, I'm too tense..."
"We won't." The couple said in unison, although they had their fingers crossed behind their backs.
"Then, I guess you don't know your son at all." Harry smirked. "He likes men, all right. Because he makes love to me, every. single. night."
Only a few months before, Draco would have been disturbed by the dust, but in that moment he didn't seem to mind.
"Did you really think that we weren't prepared for this eventuality?" said Arthur Weasley.
Draco recognised the owl upon seeing him. It was the Malfoy owl.
In the meantime, Luna had taken Ron and Harry to yet another sumptuous looking honeymoon suite, which similar to the other one, except that it had a green tone and it smelled like lime and ginger.
The doubt kept gnawing at her brain, until it struck her.
"How is it that everyone here is getting married?" Luna observed.
"Tell us your plan in detail." He hissed, stone cold.
Harry eventually did. Molly had made his opposite to Ron's. -- brown, with a red "H".
When the three arrived, they were all severely out of breath. "Here we are." Ron panted.
Looking in the distance, he saw his younger self bullying people and being downright terrible. Suddenly that image faded, he now saw himself going through his change of heart, going against his patronizing father and his views.
This wasn't what they had established. Draco mentally shivered. He had never been in a relationship before, he had always opted for friends with benefits.
"It came from our chimney, it seems." Donald observed. He had a worried look on his face.
Meanwhile, Ginny was in her bedroom, as her dad had urged everyone to change into their elegant clothes for the 'special fireworks photo of 1999'.
"Now, you grip the stick firmly, like so..." said Ginny, holding onto the broomstick like she said she had to. Luna's hands almost slipped from them.
“You might be right, Mister Malfoy.” Pomfrey regarded him stoically, though the tightness around her eyes betrayed her.
The floor in here was lit up like a beacon.
“Someone to shut him up, would you say Lissy?”
“He was your soul.”
Something Draco had always tried to smother reared its head then; a teenage crush, an infatuation, an obsession, a need, a want, a wish, a pipe dream, something he could never even
“Awake Mr Malfoy?” she asked in her normal, no-nonsense manner.
In the months that follow, it becomes a fairly common thing to do in the mornings, at nights on the occasions Harry sneaks into Draco's bed after everyone in the Slytherin Commons is asleep. Harry never has to ask because Draco always offers first, always gives him everything that Harry hasn't been able to ask for.
Narcissa regarded him, frustrated and concerned in the same moment. Draco hadn’t been well, but he had also not felt this low in months. There was recognition in Narcissa’s eyes, which had just glanced at a massive timepiece that stood tall in the foyer – one that stated the time and date.
It was only then, somehow, that Draco realised Harry was not wearing glasses. Hs green eyes were staring at him.
Potter was staring too, but then nodded slightly, kicking the ground as if he were nervous. His timidity didn’t make any sense, Draco thought. What did the dead have to be anxious about? He’d imagined Potter’s ghost would be this wild thing, like Pan running with the Forest winds. Not this shy, anxious boy standing across from him. Potter was not shy – Potter was a lion.
"A world without love can always seem a bit grey," she said quietly. ‘Literally, in some cases.’
Potter made a gesture then mouthed something; Draco couldn’t understand it. Harry huffed what looked like a self-deprecating laugh. And then he made a new gesture, touched his own chest.
"He left us," she then said. "He said goodbye and that – that stone you have there. It’s rather special. A Hallow in fact."
To Draco, he could see the way Harry was smiling at him, brushing fingers at his hairline, his cheek, the tingles of magic that shivered down his skin. He could feel his hand moving down his neck, his shoulders, his waist. Harry was pressing their foreheads together, dipped down together, Draco laughing thickly as he could see the colours following down Harry's hands, filling in the grey that had become him and his life.
He looked out into the sky again, unsettled. He tried to see it, mentally willing colour to pool back into the world.
he caught sight of him
“Yes. Though, from what I understand, death was apparently preferable. And that is not something I say lightly as a Healer.”
It seems a little too vulnerable and raw to talk about, the way he was starved for it, and for him.
He swallowed and looked away from her, ignoring Goyle’s confused stare entirely.
Draco. Don’t you dare. Don’t you fucking dare," he breathed to himself furiously. “He's dead. He –
We are pleased to inform you of your continued enrolment with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Each time he woke up from these dreams, his pillow was wet and he was typically late for his first lesson, trying to talk himself down from an unbearable sadness.
The last thing that let go of him was Harry's warmth, a soft kiss at his temple.
There he was. Harry. He was here, kneeling beside him, and his cheeks were wet but his eyes were furious. He was shaking his head in such a rage.
She might have been referring to Draco’s almost constant mute companion, but he couldn't be sure. Nothing else of what she had said made any sense. But Draco was observant and knew that Lovegood wasn’t a basket case. She merely presented herself as one. Too much of what she had said to him in the dungeons had stuck or unravelled into some terrifying kind of sense afterwards.
They all moved on without him, and now Draco was alone. Alone with Potter.
"You're sick all the time. Sometimes you get so sick that it— well. It fucking scares me. Because it feels like you're..."
Finding Harry’s dorm was just as breezy as breaking and entering into the lion’s nest. It was mid-morning, and all of Hogwarts’ was in class at the moment, bored out of their minds, and highly unlikely to catch Draco in the act. He was currently dodging Defence, and happily so. He hated the stares he got in that class, the wayward looks at his left arm he received when the new Professor levelled pointed, weighted looks at Draco every time the term
He woke up knowing Potter should have grown another year older, and the fact that he hadn’t — that he never would — caused Draco’s stomach to turn violently. Images of Potter, the few he’d rather not have witnessed, swirled in his mind as he stared unseeingly up at the canopy.
"I'm sorry, too, Harry." came Ron's voice, then he joined the hug. Draco felt a bit out of place as he witnessed this touching reconciliation. They looked like they really cared about each other. He wondered how it felt to actually have friends. It must have a been a very beautiful thing.
All those times they spent together, going to see Quidditch matches, roaming through Diagon Alley... Draco cherished them, they were among the only moments of utter delight between them.
Draco took the couple to Slughorn's office.
"Ron, we've already discussed this. No, I do not intend to keep your sister in our team. She betrayed us, therefore she is out. Full stop."Harry snapped.
His attention fixed on the other players, he saw that the chasers, Leon Dechamps, Axel Segal and Basile Trevors, were very good and, also, they had a lot of presence in the show.
The secret wedding theme, they found out, wasn't too much of a surprise.
"Oh I think I see one!" Ginny exclaimed, then she detached herself from the other girl to run towards an object that looked like an egg.
He had a very special bond with the place, even if his times there had not all been peaches and dandelions. He couldn't remember how many times he had risked death, together with breaking rules and being almost expelled.
Ron and Hermione then joined in on the hug, reassuring him and telling him how great he was.
Ginny and Hermione were standing by Angelina's side, while Ron and Charlie stood alongside George.
"You never spoil anything. We are not going until you tell me what's bothering you." Harry said with crossed arms. He proceeded to sit next to him and give him a look.
"Here we are!" said a puffing Hermione. She had changed her clothes and she was holding Ron's hand. "Happy Easter, everyone!"
Ginny tilted her head up and gave Luna a smile. She felt blessed to have her, without her it would have all been much harder. "Thank you, Luna. You're the only one who doesn't hate me around here." She said, taking Luna's hand in hers.
Ron took a breath, "Are you absolutely sure that you want to-"
"Don't call me that." Hermione said in a furious tone and rushed out of the room, leaving Harry there. Was Malfoy really worth losing his best friend over?
"Good. Night, Harry." Said his best friend. He then lay down and turned to face the wall. That hadn't been an easy talk and boy, was Harry glad that it was over. He closed the drapes on his bed and stared at the ceiling. But as he looked down, he noticed a small problem he had forgotten about. Consequence of his dream, of course. Sighing, Harry opened the drapes, got up and made his way to the bathroom.
Harry blushed furiously.
So, this is how things were.
"I couldn't care less about that tool. I don't want Harry to end up in trouble, is all."
December 31st, 1998, London
Ginny took a sigh of relief, then she pulled Luna closer and jumped with her, unable to fight her tears.
Ron gave them a disgusted look.
Harry was engaging in a long conversation with Stella Thompson, she was telling him about some strategies, but he wasn't listening to her that much, he was too busy staring at Adrian Martin, who was talking to his fiancè.
She had chosen a table in the center of the room. It wasn't that ideal - Harry thought - as this was the perfect way to get all the attention.
Some of them thought it was an act and that it was part of the show - especially Rosemary Granger, who stood there, watching the scene unravel.
"I solemnly swear I am up to no good." Harry recited and the Marauders Map appeared.
When the three couples exited the tent, they well all astonished that no one had said anything about the French Seeker's attempt at molesting girls.
But, just when he was about to fall into a blissful sleep, he was interrupted by a much dreaded voice.
"I know my mother." His fiancé stated.
The writing on the howler read 'Draco Malfoy, Muggle City' and, although there was no sender's name, it was obvious that it was from Lucius.
Harry was smiling uncontrollably, happy to have finally filled the void that Draco's absence had brought.
Harry got up and the two lovers shared their first kiss as an engaged couple.
But that wasn't the case. His parents had completely deleted him from their lives because he hadn't grown up according to plan.
without you, that is," Draco breathed, as he would if he were speaking to his own reflection; honestly and without restraint. “Though, it’s also terribly good to see you now – even if you aren’t really here.”
because Potter was–
Tears fell down Granger’s cheeks and Draco felt his own were wet too. She looked back at the spot where Harry was standing, his expression devastated.
A small movement at the bottom of the bed caught his eye. Draco turned to see Potter perched on the foot board. It might have been strange to see your now departed, once-nemesis sitting at the end of your bed. And it was, except Potter’s expression was even more strange.
These were the second last set of Harry's footsteps. They were taking him towards the very last piece of his life that he could have, and Draco was thinking of him here, in this Forest where he last stood, facing the evil madman that took him away so that he could save them all.
“Stay.” Draco couldn’t think of anything else. “Please stay. I’ll stay here
“Fucking scum.”
That necklace is the furthest thing from cute, if Harry's being truthful. "I think you just find
“There — all better.” Lovegood moved away from him before sitting on the step at his legs.
"Night, Draco."
"Your best friends. Alright. Fine." Draco exhales a slow, heavy breath through his nose, his lips pursed, his jaw set tight. "Explain to me why you're okay with your ex-Weaslette touching you but not me."
Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater. Draco Malfoy had no future.
Greets volleyed him in the stomach for his troubles.
Draco heard a thump in the aisle beside him and then a swish of a silken cloak. Potter was only a foot away from him, standing, breathing.
Harry smiles, a small breath of it. Draco's hand is warm and soft, more comfortable and fitting in his own these days. "Yeah. Yeah, she'll allow anyone in when she's asleep, as long as you say the right password."
. I was on Bicorn Horn, which is what you're actually supposed to powder. Keep up, Potter!"
“You don’t. You didn’t deserve any of it. Or any of this.” Lovegood gestured to him, her pupils as small as a needle’s point.
His and Ron’s attempted brew was already a disaster if Hermione’s world-weary sigh was anything to go by. But, at least they were
The first words Draco uttered when he woke sounded small in the dark.
Then a terrible calm flooded him.
Draco sighed, not unkindly, as he watched her curve down the many higgledy-piggledy iron grate steps. Her footfalls echoed like a gong all around him inside the tower.
"I love Harry too," Granger said quietly.
dimmed. He looked up, still smiling at the boy in front of him, and thought,
"Do you know what, Granger? I want to. Because this way, I finally get to have him, even if it’s only for a while."
Harry catches Draco eying him as Hermione leans her head against his shoulder by the force of her laughter and Harry pulls her close by an arm around her shoulder, grinning broadly, not going still. He catches eyes with Draco when Ron pats Harry's back or his shoulder, not going still. He notices Draco go quiet and distant when Ginny kisses his head playfully and he doesn't go still.
"I'm not people, Potter, I'm your boyfriend. And you're just fine with Weasley and Granger."
And Harry was still holding his hand, but he was warm, solid in the way alive people were. Draco was staring at him, blank-minded and dreamy, and Harry's lips crooked into the tenderest smile.
He and Ginny kissed for the first time on the Quidditch pitch, in front of thousands of people, the two of them high on the rush of victory. It was nice, wonderful, but it was still new and foreign, having another pair of lips on his. It was still new and foreign to have anything of anyone on him, for the most part.
Those same authors had recently printed new books, all of the rose-tinted lies about their imagined hero. Potter had been too human, too real to fit the mould of their fanciful ideals. And it made Draco ache with anger that the truth of it was ignored for something more aesthetic.
There were tears, silently glistening down her cheeks. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had seen such a sight.
"For Salazar's sake, Mother! I do not want to go to a Healer! So will you leave it alone already!"
Concentration now firmly ruined, Draco’s eyes roamed the space around him. In half a year, Hogwarts would no longer be opened to him. He felt very much as if he were on borrowed time already, and a firm deadline to his continued sanctuary within these walls made his mind obsess over the issue.
Harry knits his brows, but complies with his demand. He moves over to lie down next to him and waits for him to do whatever it is that he wants to do.
He knew exactly what Harry was speaking about. He had felt the same. He had thought himself mad.
As he walked, he saw Harry in his footsteps. In front of him was an alcove that he often saw Harry and Weasley muck about in, playing cards or chatting. He walked past a classroom that Draco remembered Harry running into during those last moments in the war, one of the last times he saw Harry alive. He climbed up and up, seeing Harry in the shadows and small spaces, until he happened on a hidden room, nestled in the belly of the seventh floor.
Harry pushed Draco’s clasped hands to his chest. The hawthorn wand rested on Draco’s chest, a thrumming warmth moving through him. All the while, Harry stared at him, and Draco’s lungs felt like they were filling with fire because of it.
Then his fingers found a piece of parchment at the back of the journal. He pulled at it until it loosened. Placing the journal down in his lap carefully, he then unfolded the parchment. He hoped for another silly drawing or doodle, as young Harry was partial to. But instead, there was a letter.
“In a hurry?” The stranger asked, now tense.
His father then regarded him, but didn’t say anything, just looked at where Draco’s hand rested on his chest. Lucius left the frame, and Draco thought he was going upstairs, to follow the love of his life, his soul, too.
Draco was shaking and there were damned tears brinming in his eyes. Granger didn’t look much better herself, flinching with every mention of Harry’s death as if in physical pain.
"You know, it makes sense, in a strange way," Granger said.
"Not having a good day, are you, mate?" Ron asked.
It's just that when Draco scoots in close against his back, Harry tenses up all over his bare and warm torso, and Draco can't have not noticed this.
Granger finally stood up to her feet, clutching her books to her chest, looking adamantly ahead. She stepped past him,  her jaw set with it all.
Lovegood nodded, this time solemnly.
The room was bright and full of colour. Full of words –
even added some sort of black-out charm on the fabric for good measure. He sighed
On a Saturday, sitting on a bench in Hogsmeade after Harry and Draco had both copped out of a snowball fight between them and their friends, Harry thinks a little too much about taking his cheeks, pink against the white frost of the world around them, in his hands and kissing him.
“Bit harsh, Draco.”
Harry shakes his head. "I'm not embarrassed to be with you, for Merlin's sake! I don't bloody care what people think about us."
But he doesn't. That might have been terribly out of line anyway. Instead, Harry says, "Go out with me."
When his mother opened it and saw him, she smiled. She remained graceful and composed, but her joy reflected in the brightness of her eyes, and she stepped forward, kissing his cheek in greeting. But when she drew back, her face pulled into a frown.
"Spoiled rich prat," Harry says, can't hide the breath of a grin playing at his lips.
Then, an elated smile bloomed on Potter’s features. Draco’s lips upturned as if dragged along with it. A tight sensation danced along his ribs, and his palms were not sweating despite the cool air of his dorm.
Granger moved, as if to say
He turned, ducked, and dived into an alcove, then a flight of stairs, through another corridor, that lead into a huge room, another set of winding steps until he was met with a door.
Snape frowned but then smirked.
, Harry's lips shaped around his name back, softly, head cocked slightly.
He wants to hold Harry after. Harry doesn't hold people or like being held much in the aftermath, but he does want to hold Draco, quite desperately in fact. It throbs beneath his skin and sternum, how much he does.
"What the bloody hell are you on about?"
“Nothing,” he whispered again.
With both their shirts off, Draco places his hands on either side of Harry's head, snow-blond hair hanging around his face and into his silver eyes, hovering over him. "Tell me what you want."
He didn't notice it at first. He didn't notice it at all, in fact, through his trip down to the library, planning on continuing his studying for the Transfiguration test tomorrow there.
Draco looked down at the fields below. It was a mess of too-green splotches surrounded by greyish turf. It was as if Harry’s footprints had soaked up all of the colour surrounding them – as if they needed to be seen, to be noticed, to be followed.
"Like what?"
"Luna's right," Goyle said.  "Maybe you should get yourself checked at St. Mungo’s too."
"Hm," Draco says noncommittally, a little too much so. There's a twitch in his cheek, but Harry can't tell if he's only imagined it. He shifts around to get comfortable on him, drops a blind kiss that lands on Harry's neck and then turns back to the book, continuing on with his explanation of the procedure for the formation of Polyjuice Potion.
Draco reared up a few more steps. The flinch shuttered Lovegood's perpetually dreamy expression before it turned dark, so much so that Draco noticed that it was the first time she’d ever looked so sober.
"Right." Harry shakes his head. "I didn't think of that." He rubs the back of his neck awkwardly. He can't explain the irrational, roiling ache in his chest again, not too dissimilar to the one he'd felt seeing the Dursleys recoil away from him a very long time ago. "I guess I'll be going then—"
After skimming through the book, and carefully sliding the notes back into the crease of where the pages met the book spine, Draco flipped back to the first pages. He noticed that there was no library card inside, which was odd. Draco then, as if possessed, took the book to Madam Pince.
Harry’s heart hurt with every word that Draco said. He could only nod jerkily as he tried to reign in his emotions. His lips found Draco’s again, and in this kiss, he found his home, the fantasy that felt eons old.
Draco stops, turning his torso around to look at him with an inquisitive raise of his brows, hands in the pockets of his long coat.
"Yes," Harry said, strained.
Draco hauls him aside into an empty corridor and against the wall and kisses down his face and jaw and neck. He wraps his arms around his neck, bounces his eyebrows and asks with a grin,
Draco felt blindly for his wand, and it wasn’t where he left it. He couldn’t find it, and his mind was too terrified to summon it. He clawed at Burns, his face, his arms, his neck. He tried to reach for Burns' throat so he could choke him out, anything,
"Oh, poor thing, I'll have to check on her later." said Hermione in a sad tone.
"Well, won't you go to the kitchen now! Christmas lunch is ready!" Mrs Weasley said.
Harry said. He was starting to sob now.
Easy, I thought, since he had been brainwashed by fucking Potter. All I had to do was drop an act. I have always been a good actress, ever since I was a kid. I would get innocent people into trouble with my amazing acting techniques, just for fun or to save my own skin.
Hermione nodded, although she found it rather odd that the adults in the picture weren't too aggressive on the intruders.
"This way, it will always be with you." said Ron.
***********************************************************************************************
"Oh, here they are!" said Molly, as she ran towards the children with open arms and the brightest smile Draco had ever seen.
Hermione and Ron held onto each other as they hid behind the altar.
"Ill take that as a yes." Said Molly. "Ah-ha, I told your father, but he didn't think this was possible! Once again I was right!"
Harry couldn't help giggling at that.
All of a sudden, his anxiety died down ad was replaced by overwhelming joy.
"Father?" said Draco, stunned. His eyes widened in terror and his whole body froze at the sight of that man.
What was not to cherish in such a cute couple?
The whole room cheered for the brunette, Ron in particular, as he gave her a standing ovation.
"I want to make love to you." Luna whispered, maintaining eye contact.
Shooting Draco a death stare, she tugged on her boyfriend's shirt, motioning for him to come with her.
"Where is Harry?" she asked her brother.
Hermione was the most nervous among them.
Draco sat next to Harry. They were both very ecstatic and couldn't wait for the game to start.
"Ok, so..." the male voice said, the face it belonged to sighed. "Last night they slept in the same room, like every night. Nothing new. They've just spent the whole of breakfast time analyzing their talk with you, ma'am. Nothing too relevant for the time being."
"No, not yet." Draco breathed. He then stopped what he was doing and rolled around the bed, then went on to remove his own shirt. He was no longer on top of Harry, but he was now positioning himself on all fours. "I want you to fuck me, Potter."
All the people present in the room gasped, especially Ginny.
His father would have suffered a heart attack had he known that.
"You're so cute when you do that." The blonde observed.
When the people in the room gathered around her to embrace her fondly, Ginny felt like the luckiest girl in the world.
And it that moment, they were one.
"I think you need to go. Night, Love you." He said to his boyfriend.
Throughout the next days, Draco tried to contact Harry in many ways, but he never succeeded.
"Come on, Harry. Your relationship is strong, I'm sure it would be fine if you just talked it through."said Hermione.
Ginny and Luna ended up being among the petrified.
It was a moving drawing of the two girls, Luna was kissing Ginny on the cheek while hugging her.
He turned around to see Neville break into a sob and fall at Harry's feet.
"Yes, don't worry."
"Ah, a boy can look, no?"Draco winked at Blaise, the other boy rolled his eyes and then stopped as he saw the three friends happily walking towards their tree. "Ugh, look at the three little piggies. This is our spot and they want to steal it!"
"But, professor-" Pansy started, but she was cut off.
"George Weasley, do you take this woman  to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, in sickness and in heath, in good times and woe, for richer or poorer, keeping yourself solely unto her for as long as you both shall live?" Miss Sivan proceeded, her attention fixed on the groom.
This was it. He heard nothing but his own heart thumping in his ears, as time perilously got closer to his speech.
Harry blushed furiously. It had actually happened. He recalled that dream about them kissing, which became true a day after.
Not finding a better option, he ran away. While he did so, his heart was beating so loud that he couldn't hear his thoughts, his head was throbbing violently. He was crying tears of anger.
"Look, Draco...I know we haven't been a couple for the longest time, but..." Harry took a breath.
She had bitten on something hard, so she spat it out.
When the clock stroke midnight, they dived into a sweet kiss.
As Harry arrived in his dorm, he screamed in frustration.
Given the guy's behavior, he might go as far as to spike Draco's drink with a love potion.
The Slytherin shook his head lightly, then he brought their foreheads together. "You are too adorable." he whispered, then he captured the Gryffindor's lips with his own, engaging into a soft kiss.
They were made to be worn with golden heels.
It took her a while to regain her senses and realise what Luna had just done to her.
"No, Ron. I have to do this. He cheated on me with fucking Malfoy! He deserves to suffer!"
Present day, Hogwarts
"Well, I'm not sure he would rejoice, but I guess you could tell him? I mean, if you're planning on keeping it..." The redhead suggested.
Luna was confused at the sight of a pissed off Harry sitting next to her. "Oh hi, Harry, why are we glaring at Ron and Hermione? Are the nargles behind it?" She asked him in her usual dreamy voice. He simply nodded.
Only minutes later the pair was able to at least sit up. That's when Draco remembered that he had a question to ask him. "So, as you know, Christmas is close." he began, although he thought that what he had just said sounded a bit dumb.
He seemed unsure of himself, was struggling to wrap his head around using a diary
mentioned, like Draco was some sort of posterchild for it all.
Draco thought she didn’t realise that her inability to talk about him, his preferences, was more hurtful than anything a stranger could conjure up.
It was amongst the passing bodies, people walking back after class, that Draco saw him.
He swallowed, his heart throbbing slow and erratic in his throat. "Yeah. Well. You saved me too. So, I suppose that makes us somewhat even."
“I’ll take my chances," Draco said, softly. "There’s nothing I wouldn’t do.”
"Yeah." Harry clears his throat. "The closest they could stand getting to me was to whack me with a frying pan, or to grab me by the collar. Or sit on me, in my cousin's case."
Ron's blue eyes narrow at him in some kind of silent warning. "Remember what we talked about, Malfoy?"
“Did you… did you ever seek treatment?”
Dating Draco Malfoy, Harry thinks, will mean being at arms length outside of sex. No unnecessary physical contact or displays of affection. He wants him anyway, inexplicably. Perhaps that is exactly the kind of person he should be with, someone who will never need Harry to kiss him first, because Harry doesn't think he'll ever be that person.
They found Luna on the way, who joined them on their trip to the infirmary. Luna, strangely enough, had made unlikely friends with Goyle, and it wasn’t unusual to see them in each other’s company, even if the sight of it was wholly odd.
"No, Granger. Keep it. It’s yours," Draco said, even though he coveted anything that was once Harry’s. But it seemed like it meant dearly to her, that it was one of the few things she had of him left.
Draco couldn't speak, couldn't move, staring at that place where Potter was, and then wasn't.
"It’s none of your business—"
In that small moment, it felt warm. It felt good.
“We can’t
"Bad? How can this be bad? It’s
consequences. Especially among our kind.”
it leaves scars in its survivors. It tears people apart...and sometimes that has unforeseen consequences. Awful,
Draco couldn’t feel Potter’s fingertips, not really. His body still lit up with gooseflesh and a rolling shiver as if he did.
"We can both see better like this," Harry murmurs. Draco's back melds easily into his torso, his body sprawled out across the settee between Harry's legs, knees folded up where he's propped his book against them. "And it's more comfortable."
it said.
“No, not really – but you’ll blame me anyway – "
“They are Potter’s," he stated, dumbfounded.
Because these were the things he would never share with Harry. These were the things in some form or another that he’d secretly wanted over the years; Harry's attention, his touch, and a place in his life, at his side.
"I found something," Narcissa said. "Whilst I was going through the storage room." Her eyes were still on her hand, the slow opening of her fingers, revealing a black gem. For a moment, he only stared at it as if he didn't know what to do with it. His fingers trembled, reaching for it.
dying, then," Greg said. He swallowed hard. His eyes were wide, bright, his brows drawn together in a doleful frown. He stood up, ran a hand down his mouth as he turned around. "Fuck." And then he stayed like that for a moment, turned away from him with his hands on his hips, head lowered down. His shoulders were quivering.
"What did I say then?"
Sitting in the library on a study date together, Harry pushes his fingers between Draco's and entwines them together, his eyes flicking over to him, but not completely resting on him. He sees just enough to catch Draco's lips quirking into a small, mellow smirk, the subtle inclination of his head towards him. Draco curls his hand around his and he doesn't let go all throughout, even when it grows sweaty and hot and uncomfortable.
"Congratulations!" Luna shouted, holding her dress to avoid stomping on it with every leap her feet took.
Harry thought that the grey eyed boy was about to reject him, he was sure. He looked quite shaken.
The only one left was Luna. Molly was sure that she would beat her as well.
In a matter of seconds, the whole of the Great Hall was filled with banners, much like those used in the House Cup, but, instead of a house crest, they sported a picture of Draco and Harry kissing each other.
He had never noticed this before, but her office was filled with pictures of fairies.
"Oh, babe, you're Ok!" said a stuttering Ginny. She flung her arms around her girlfriend, wrapping her into a firm embrace. "I was so scared that something had happened to you!"
"Of course, mum." He said.
Hermione's discomfort, however, didn't go unnoticed.
When Hermione and Ron pulled away, they were both giggling.
Things were going great for the new couple lately, though there was one particular they couldn't ignore: They couldn't be public about their relationship.
Draco found out the hard way that it's hard to be believable, when you've always lied.
She was a good person, through it all, but she was still a Malfoy.
"I did care about them. That's why I did all the things I did... to please them. But if he thinks I'm willing to go back to being daddy's servant, he's wrong." He said. His tears had dried on his face, but his eyes were still puffy and red.
"My Dear Lucius. Those are your son and I kissing. Yeah, because we love each other." He said in a mocking tone, putting emphasis on the word "love".
When all hope seemed lost, an idea sprung at the back of his mind - veritaserum.
"But you didn't, I'm right here! Because you were cautious and this saved me." The Slytherin said in a reassuring tone. He cupped Harry's face in his hands and locked his eyes with his. "You saved me. Like you always do. And I can't wait for Miss Sivan to pronounce us married."
"Ah yes, Ginny and I knew about it, but it was supposed to be a surprise." Ron confessed, grinning from ear to ear.
Narcissa Malfoy looked to her right to catch Neville Longbottom's eye, then she nodded to him.
But who they found was not Ron nor Hermione, it was their most dreaded enemy, Jean Jacques.
"Will you two please tell me what's been going on in this past month?" he asked. Not that he expected a response right away.
He felt like his walls were crumbling down, his head started to spin, he felt like he would faint.
"And that wasn't even our first kiss." Ginny pointed out.
At this point, Ron and Hermione changed their facial expression.
"Come on, guys, don't let this spoil the fun!" Luna intervened. "He's not the guy you think he is."
It really flattered him to know that he had given someone the strength to be open about their relationship with another male.
He would have seen him soon, though, he knew it.
"I told you that my friendliness might surprise you." said the Slytherin.
"Congratulations, Harry! I knew he would say yes!" a thrilled Hermione squealed, launching herself at her friend and squeezing him tightly.
If the girl ever brought up magical beasts, it meant she was serious.
Said an apparent muggle from several seats behind. He quickly reached his target and bound his wrists together with invisible handcuffs.
"I can't believe this! You're my husband!" Draco squealed.
We learnt that you will be spending Easter in a house of mudbloods, in a muggle city."
She was right in front of her favourite Quidditch player ever, she had fantasized about that moment so many times and now, there she was, so unbelievably close to her.
She was in love with her gown.
Meanwhile, at the Three Broomsticks, the golden trio plus Draco were enjoying themselves.
"Thank you! Today is my birthday, you've just made it unforgettable!" Ginny squealed, trying to keep her tears from falling, but to no avail.
Draco wasn't ecstatic to see her, but he couldn't be too mad at her, not when she had snowflakes all over her face.
He held his breath as it flew towards him.
"Am I mute or something? Now, all of you, go back to eating dinner or I will expel you!" McGonagall yelled.
Harry had a hopeful look on his face, waiting for his lover's response.
Her husband nodded his head in approval.
The woman nodded. "I noticed a while ago, actually. New Year's eve, to be exact." She confirmed, her lips curled into a smile.
"Tell you what, both of you." Miss Sivan said, getting up. She walked closer to the pair. "Why don't you come to my office for some remedial Defence? This afternoon at 5."
"Look, Draco," said Narcissa. "My opinion on the matter differs greatly for your father's." she explained.
Draco felt his anxiety grow. He had to wait one more day to face him.
"Hey..." said Hermione, right after her dad left her at the altar.
"Ow, baby! You know I only have eyes for you, that's just the quarter-veela thing!" Ron defended himself, massaging his cheek.
"Nothing is more beautiful than you." her girlfriend said, dancing a bit.
The girl scoffed. It was true, though. She wasn't willing to change her mind on Draco, and she wasn't even trying. "I'm just looking out for myself and you! You're such a fool, Harry! Do you really want to ruin a friendship because of that piece of trash? So much for being a Gryffindor! You should have ended up in Slytherin!" It was Harry's turn to scoff. Ron didn't know what to do, he was going a little crazy as he couldn't keep up with all their fighting. "You know damn well that I need this to know who I am! And it's merely physical!" Harry shouted. Now Ron was done. "What the hell is going on?" He finally snapped. The two seemingly ex friends stopped their ruckus and looked at him. They were both panting. "Our 'friend' here has been shagging none other than Draco Malfoy! And he's taking this so lightly!" Hermione said in a bitter tone, puffing a little. Ron's eyes widened. "What? You said you wouldn't!" He was angry. Of course he was, Harry thought. He had to agree with his girlfriend if he didn't want trouble with her. Grow a mind of your own, mate.
But what killed him the most were the memories. Their first kiss, their first time... the way their bodies intertwined with lust, the way Draco's kiss was enough to make him weak in the knees... all the time they had been cute, their ice skating date, Christmas, kissing in the middle of a Quidditch match...
"What did I tell you, uh? That he touched you because he wanted to get in your pants! Because he wanted to take you away from me!" said Harry, crying freely.
Ginny and her brother looked at each other, finally unmasking their fake confusion.
"Listen, come Monday, you go see the Headmistress and tell her what happened. Then, I will challenge him to a duel." Harry suggested.
As she sucked on her clitoris, Ginny grabbed the sheets and tried to suppress a moan, all the while her toes curled in pleasure.
Pansy screamed, "NO!"
For some reasons they had girl's names, like 'Margherita'.
"I'm just so proud of you!" Harry sighed contentedly.
Draco, in particular, was looking forward to seeing his most beloved team play. He hadn't seen them in a while, so he didn't know who was in the team. He was excited to see who would play and if they were able to beat the former players.
"We can. I will guide everyone myself, Harry entrusted me with this task." Ron responded, showing off a bit of a leader vibe. "It's Harry I'm worried about. Hoping Malfoy won't kill him in there!" He chuckled.
To their surprise, he didn't have any bad reaction. On the contrary, he simply congratulated Ginny for her win.
Also, their choice of drinks sounded funny, too.
But Harry wouldn't let him finish. He pushed him away abruptly, using so much strength to nearly knock him to the ground.
Ginny fought the urge to scream for joy.
However, when I saw them holding hands earlier, I knew my plot had failed.
The others all cheered for them as the older girl put the ring on Ginny's freckled finger.
Ginny and Pansy sat at the High Table with the teachers.
The younger boy took a deep breath. "I'm not fooling her into anything, Ron..."
Then, they plunged themselves into each other, diving into the most passionate kiss they had ever shared.
"Ah, what an adventure!" Arthur exclaimed while entering the house. Molly ran to him, gave him a kiss on the lips and then removed his coat. "Finally! We were beginning to worry!" The woman said, putting her husband's coat on the hook.
There was nothing more that Lucius could say to his son in that moment. He had ended him.
Hermione had given Harry a box of Chocolate Frogs, while Ron had bought him a decoration for Viridis' cage. Harry had given Hermione a new quill. His gift to Ron was a box of Honeydukes exploding bon bons.
He had done all of this to create a strain in their relationship.
Draco had not been terrific at that, not recently, but his parents were aces at it.
"I won't say anything, people who don't keep secrets get bitten by Domodils." said Luna.
Her girlfriend turned to her, smirking. As she opened her mouth to speak, Luna shut her up. "Oh, no, don't look at me. I want to marry you but we need to finish school first. I don't want to be too vulnerable for the Nargle attacks."
Luna pushed that hand away so fast that it hit the wooden surface below it.
She didn't know how she could have prevented herself from jumping  on the girl.
Hermione slapped him across the face so hard that her hand print exceeded the redness of the blushing.
"Draco, you will do great things in your life, I know. You will conquer the world, even. "
Ron even got physical with him once in the hallway.
It had felt so good and satisfying to excel in almost every subject each year, to always be the one speaking during lessons, to be the brightest witch of her age...
His boyfriend grinned at him, then he brushed his face with his thumb and kissed him softly. "I love you, too."
Wizards and witches attending could travel there by Floo Powder or disapparation, as they would end up in a close by room. which was protected by a disillusionment charm.
As the years went by, little Draco got close to both of his parents, but his dad had formed a special bond with him.
"Please, professor! We can't stay here!" Draco pleaded, trying to see where the girls were headed.
"New Year's Eve." Luna and Ginny said in unison.
Miss Sivan involved a reluctant Mr Lovegood in a very sensual tango, her hair glitter hitting the man with each move.
There was a slow clap, then it became louder by the second. Harry smiled. He felt so much respect for himself in that moment. And for the crowd. Everyone was clapping at the bravery, except Blaise, Gregory, Pansy and Ginny. Blaise was so shocked that he had almost choked on a bean.
"I saw that." Harry said to Draco with a 'you can't keep things from me' look.
In the last days, when Harry and Draco slept in the same dormitory as Ron, he had been pestering them with his anxiety. 'What if they don't like me? What if they kick me out after two minutes?' was only a glimpse of his constant rambles of fear.
Hermione and Ron hugged, both of them were crying .
Draco's lips curled into a smile.
Luna's heart was warmed at the sight of her cheerful girlfriend. This was definitely more worth it that taking her to the Nargle Convention.
"I hope so," Harry sighed, "I feel like shit after how I treated him... He's right, for some things..."
Even Ron had noticed that.
Draco nodded in response, then went in for a kiss. It was the sweetest of their kisses, so far.
Harry let go of his wrists and stopped to think.
He was sure of one thing: Jean Jacques Germain couldn't hurt them.
He pulled away, slowly, then, upon fully recollecting himself, he spoke.
"If you say so." Draco rolled his eyes. He couldn't deny that she was a good actress., at least.
After Hermione threw her bouquet, who Ginny promptly caught, Molly declared it was time to dance.
Only the ones who knew the whereabouts of the venue could use those methods.
Her hair was tied in ponytail with multiple bands, each of them 'embellished' with a Butterbeer cap. She was wearing the dress Hermione had worn at George's  marriage ceremony, the colour had been changed to green, though.
It wasn't safe to sleep in the same room as Blaise and Gregory.
Harry wasn't sure about how he should have reacted. It was shocking, but at the same time he didn't know if his friend was happy about it. Judging from her expression, however, she didn't look like she was on cloud nine.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. Their suspicion was close to being confirmed.
"What was that all about?" Draco asked, as he came into the room. Harry was already in his bed, facing the wall.
"Mmm maybe it doesn't stick because it can't make your straight if you're not straight at all." His best friend joked after examining his mop of a head.
"Of course I would, but that doesn't mean you have to lie about it!" he said, angrily. "My boyfriend gets molested and keeps it a secret... how am I supposed to take this?"
"Like hell you are! I mean, why do you even have to lock yourself in?" Draco groaned in frustration.
"I knew that something was up!" Pansy shouted, " But never, for the life of me, I could have predicted this!" She pointed her finger from Draco to Harry, then back to Draco. "Potter? Really, Draco?"
"Jean Jacques is Pansy! She just took the polyjuice potion!" said Ron. "Oh, they know already."
Draco ended up tackling his fiancè to the ground.
Harry wanted to wipe that smile off that stupid face so badly. But he had to admit that this teasing was not so bad. "Look who's talking!"He simply said.
Draco's expression was puzzled, at this point. What the devil did he have in mind?
"I win! I'm the Easter Queen!" Ginny squealed contentedly, proudly displaying her basket
"I happen to have a wide ranged vocabulary." Draco said, pompously.
"We will see." said Harry.
Draco looked at them, smiling.
"If it's just for the sex you could do it with anyone, no? Not necessarily with Malfoy!"
"Oh, Draco, how will I manage without your snarky comments?" Ron responded.
"I do." Angelina replied, barely able to keep her tears from falling down her cheeks.
"Pansy, look," Draco said. "I know that I'm different now. And yeah, the fact I'm dating Harry played a part in that, but in the end, he just let me be the person that I always wanted to be, underneath it all. Now I am free, Pans. Partly because of you, I finally spoke up to my father."
Just breathing into each other, feeling each other's bodies close, was enough to make them ecstatic.
Harry pretended to scoff.
"Go!" Hermione said, pushing him out of his chair.
"Come on, don't whine! We have to go, our ride is expecting us!" said a chirpy Hermione, getting up from her seat and leading the way out of the building.
"Is there something you need to tell us?" asked Ron.
Ginny and Hermione were bridesmaids, so they would be wearing the exact same dress.
"No!" she shouted. "Stop it!"
"Um..." was all that the blond boy could say. He had never really stopped to think about it.
"I'm not talking to him, unless he apologises." Harry argued.
Harry knew what it felt like to lose someone he loved, having lost a bunch in the previous year alone.
His presence in the crowd and his support warmed his heart greatly.
They went to bed at around 5 am.
"Ah, and who do we have here, little Malfoy." Molly finally said, acknowledging his presence.
"This is not what I was meaning to discuss, actually." The boy said, scratching his head. "I need to tell you something very important."
Her choice of outfit was definitely posh, it was a very expensive khaki gown, paired with her brown heels.
It was a gift from Luna to her girlfriend since she had won the bet.
"You see, this is the only way we can have a moment in public. By checking the grades sheet together." He sighed. "I don't think it's fair, Ron... I mean, why can't I kiss him in front of everyone like you do with Mione?"
"How dare you dishonor us this way? Apparently, being an abomination wasn't enough for you."
Hermione suddenly began sweating profusely.
As she kneeled down to examine it, the mystery around it was revealed: it was nothing but a chicken egg.
"Let it go, Ron. Your girl here doesn't understand." Harry replied. It was clear she didn't.
Draco, who had recovered from the effects of the impediment jinx, stared at him, his mouth dropped.
"Oh, of course you can go! Even tomorrow - I value these acts of love! And don't worry, your secret is safe with me." The ex Hufflepuff said, accepting his request.
Ginny screamed upon hearing her name. "Go, Gwen!" she yelled, then she laughed for the enormous amount of happiness that her presence gave her.
She would have remembered them very fondly - except for, maybe, her third year ones with Trelawney.
"Harry..." Draco whimpered at the intrusion. "More."
Harry sighed, looking up, trying to get the tears that were threatening to escape his his eyes to stay in place. "Oh, Luna. I miss him so much."
"I could have lost you!" The Gryffindor weeped, looking up and swallowing a lump in his throat to keep from bawling.
"I wonder what it will be." Ron said, jokingly.
"Then let's go to that altar and let's get the fuck married." Draco said when pulling away.
"So, I told the Ministry of Magic that something like this could take place, therefore they made it impossible to disapparate from here until after the ceremony would be terminated. This is why you're unable to leave." Harry suddenly said.
"But where is he now?" Jean Jacques pointed out. "Is his pride stronger zan his love for you?"
"I'm just so anxious." he said, after Hermione had asked him about it.
He seemed to beg him.
"Wow, that was some show!" Hermione's grandmother squeaked, clapping her hands slightly.
"Don't worry, Ginny Poo." Luna said, adoringly. "You're the best chaser in the team!"
Harry kissed him in response.
Also, the mystery surrounding the Malfoys knowing everything their son did, even if they weren't communicating with him, was solved.
"I'll talk to her tomorrow..." Harry reassured his friend. He surely didn't want to be hated by him. He knew how protective Ron was when it came to his sister. He shifted uncomfortably in his bed, hoping that this conversation would end as soon as possible.
When Hermione went back to her seat, her boyfriend complimented her and then kissed her softly on the lips.
The french guy smiled widely. "Oh, Oui! I come here late, straight from an 'otel. I spent troi days there... "he explained.
After this marvelous gastronomical experience, Hermione dragged her friends to a pub.
"Yeah! So we can spend every night together!" Said Harry while holding his hand. "And you won't risk getting awful room mates again."
Harry's face turned as red as Ron's hair. "Not at all!" he said.
Draco was now extremely creeped out by him. He noticed that his room mate was wearing only boxers, nothing else.
"Guys, wait!" He called out, waving his arms, but they kept on walking, not daring to turn around.
It didn't really matter, though. Draco had lost everything.
He stared at them as Potter ran his fingers through her hair, eliciting a giggle from the girl. It was nauseating to watch those lovebirds, if anything. They could get a bloody room, for one.
"Oh, but he's the one who pushed me to the ground!"
Ginny's voice broke the silence, "Screw you, Harry! An owl is on its way to the Daily Prophet, soon everyone will know."
"I never even expected him to do anything, you know? I didn't even want to be with him in the first place. I simply wanted a few nights of meaningless sex with him. But I don't know how, I fell for him. Must be the Chosen One charm, I reckon." The blond boy said as he put his head in his hands, sighing. He couldn't believe it, he was opening up to Jean Jacques.
"I'm Ok with it. I feel bad for the girls." said Ron, shrugging.
"Sure." Draco said, he then turned that handshake into a slightly awkward hug. If his dad had been there, he would have cruciated him. Or killed him right away. Friends with a mudblood, he heard his father's voice in his head say, what a disgrace for the family.
So, someone else was behind it.
"I do!" Draco and Ron said in unison.
Who was this guy? And why did he thoroughly enjoy messing with them?
"Draco's only doing this to get back at me, because I didn't exactly treat him nicely." Said Harry, looking down at his plate.
Ginny timidly walked to her idol. Her heartbeat was very fast and her face was as red as her hair.
Luna was happy, too, and she showed her emotions by twirling around.
Thus, they didn't hear their fight.
"Your choice of boys is.. peculiar, to say the least." Her mother expressed. Her lips were pursed, suggesting a minor disapproval regarding Ron.
Ginny had learnt, as she grew, that nothing in life was ever a guarantee, so she figured it would make sense to try something new and leaving her fear behind.
The woman was wearing her hair in an elegant bun.
"What?" Harry and Draco exclaimed in unison, not sure they had heard her right.
"And I happen to love you, like only a nincompoop can love." the black haired boy said after his laughing had died down.
When the Weasley girl arrived upstairs, in Fred and George's old bedroom, where Harry and Draco had slept the night before, she found the couple sitting on the bed. Draco was crying, arguing that his boyfriend should have left him at Hogwarts.
"Ugh, you know I can't stand this damned face of yours!" Draco said in a fake angry voice.
Harry nodded, then everyone entered the house.
Harry scoffed, pretending to be upset at his comment.
He and his friends were in the Gryffindor common room, sitting on sofas, their trunks standing next to them, ready to go.
"What? I couldn't let you win on purpose!" Draco put his hands up defensively.
Here went his promise of avoiding usage of cute pet names. He had to admit, though, that these names were not so puke-inducing, once he was the one being in love.
All that could be heard was the occasional cough from a student. The teachers were also very quiet. When the two lovers parted the kiss, Draco had tears in his eyes. Harry brushed his fingers on his face to wipe all the residue . Draco looked into his eyes and smiled. The two boys looked at the crowd in front of them and Harry's voice broke the silence.
"Where is the Birthday Girl?" Said Draco, looking around to see if he could find her.
She had been going on about it for years, spreading anxiety throughout her peers.
Even if it meant engaging in criminal activity.
He didn't mind the fact that the person showing off the snitch looked exactly like Jean Jacques anymore.
Draco felt as if an enormous weight had been lifted off his shoulders. So Pansy didn't know what was really going on. But the problem persisted: she still knew something was up and, knowing her, she'd be well determined to know what Draco had been hiding all along. He couldn't let that happen, that would have ruined his life.
"Hello, dears, butterbeers for everyone?"she asked.
"It's so beautiful!" she said.
"And I'll be a grandfather! Congratulations!" Arthur added.
After an agonizing half an hour, the pair was finally done with their lesson.
"What do you know about our relationship?" said Harry furiously.
It hurt, but she managed to get through it, as well.
"Draco, we're in the middle of Hogsmeade!" Harry observed, accentuating the fact that they were outside in the open air. But he didn't remove the possessive hand from his buttock. He didn't hate it there.
"This is so exciting." said Harry to Draco, as they sat next to each other. "I can't believe we used to play Qudditch together, it feels like yesterday!"
The redhead was wearing her Quidditch training uniform, while Luna sported her "anti-nargle" vest, as she put it.
Seconds later, the door flung open, revealing the three of them, covered in snow from head to toe.
Not even sleep would, as his dreams were even more ruthless than his conscious thoughts.
He could say that he was ecstatic at the idea of being a father and wondered how it was that his girlfriend's friends didn't think he would have had that reaction.
"What do you mean you can't? Let me do that!" Mrs Malfoy shouted, pushing him away to take her son into her arms.
"Oh, Mr Longbottom here will not come with us, no. He told us everything. You blackmailed him into spying on his friend and later sabotaging his wedding to avoid his grandmother getting hurt by you." Auror number two said.
"Don't worry, we have hours to spend on the train." Draco informed.
"This wedding is cool, by the way. No Nargles as party poopers."said Luna, contentedly.
They had probably cast muffliato and disillusionment charms when in bed.
"Aren't you a bit obsessed with him?" Blaise observed. "I just hate him so much." Draco responded with a shrug. Oh, Blaise was so right, for once. He was becoming obsessed with Potter, not that he hadn't been in the years before this.
When Hermione had told him to go to the library, he hadn't done that right away. He had simply stayed hidden behind the door, using one of George's Extendable Ears.
When Harry and Draco did that, their eyes exuded pure happiness and excitement.
Hermione smirked, then she turned to her boyfriend. "I think I might know just who is in there..."
There was no doubt as to who that was.
"I don't think so," said Hermione. "I mean, they didn't react badly to the news of you two being a thing." She pointed out.
His fiancè's intervention was what it took to make him smile and forget about his anxiety for public speaking.
"Oh, shed a tear there!" Miss Sivan commented, wiping a tear. Even that gesture was a graceful movement. "So, without further do, do you, Ronald Weasley, take Hermione Jean Granger as your lawfully wedded wife? While, do you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, take Harry James Potter as your lawfully wedded husband?"
"I welcome you to the semifinal of ze Quidditch European Cup of 1999!"
Madame Rosmerta eyed the woman eerily, not really enjoying her presence in her place.
"Good, then after you."
Although he was always under Ron or Hermione's watch, when they were in class, though, they couldn't exactly know what he was doing.
"How dare you? On my birthday!" The Green eyed boy scoffed when the mach was over and Draco flaunted his prize - a homemade cookie- for everyone to see.
So, now they knew about Jean Jacques' thing with Draco.
The rest of the Christmas day was spent exchanging presents, singing and eating biscuits in front of the fireplace.
"We need to study! Or we'll get a horrible mark in our NEWTs. What are you... are you checking out Weasley?" Blaise asked, with a hint of laugh in his voice.
"Oh no, he did not." Ginny said in response.
Now, they had the room all to themselves.
"Hey," said his boyfriend, squeezing his shoulder lightly. " I know it hurts but, with time, you will realise that 'family' isn't always blood-related.For I am your family now. We all are."
There she was, looking so bashful and adorable, blushing at her compliments.
"Won't you tell her why you broke up with her, mate?" Ron wouldn't have any of his shit, it seemed.
"Hey, love, you're trembling! Don't worry, it will be fine." Donald Granger cooed. "Otherwise you'll harm the baby."
From a distance, the French Seeker didn't look familiar, but, with the touch of the Omnioculars he most certainly did.
"You're terrible." said Draco, going in for a second kiss.
"Oh," the woman giggled. " The other day, on one of my strolls through Diagon Alley, I came accross this Jewel Shop.
"Potter? I'd rather sleep with bloody Gregory than Potter! You are so funny sometimes!"
He had to admit that, throughout the last two months, they had bonded to an extent.
The girl almost forgot to hug Draco, but she fixed it almost immediately.
His eyes were blue, but he had olive skin, so he definitely didn't look British.
"Thanks for the support." said Draco, smiling.
"Dracou? Are you awake?" Jean Jacques called to him in a whisper.
In the past few years, she had developed an unquestionable crush on Neville, but she'd never found the courage to come onto him.
Hermione was the one to break the silence. "Pansy, I hope you know that this is a criminal offence. You will be expelled for this, as a minimum. This is serious, Azkaban serious." She said, sternly.
"Let me deal with it." Draco smirked. He got up and walked closer to the trio, focusing on Potter. So I can get close to him... Oh the way he moves those hips...That unkempt beard...
On June 5th, 1980, a young woman named Narcissa was lying on a bed, spent. She was sweating profusely, her breath was slowing and her whole body ached.
"We can face him together." Harry reassured.
As he finished, Draco was panting and sweating a bit. He wasn't crying, though and he wasn't going to, not this time.
"Hey, bro!" Ron said happily. "How are you? How's Fleur?"
Then she pulled away and went to say hi to Luna.
"Morning, Mrs Granger." the couple said in unison.
Ginny and Hermione exchanged a tearful look, then they hugged.
Harry scoffed, then he straddled him, pinning him down by the wrists.
"He said I'm not a good boyfriend because I don't dine with the Slytherins." he explained.
Harry passed a shocked Ginny on his way to his seat. "It takes much more to bring down Harry Potter, didn't Voldemort teach you anything?" he said to her, with a hint of sass.
Most of them had agreed to it, but Ginny and Luna had already made arrangements to spend it in Luna's house. Xenophilius had invited Ginny as he saw her as 'his daughter's most personal friend'.
Harry smiled in response. Banter in the Weasley household was one of the things he liked the most about that family.
Therefore, he was dreading the arrival of that day.
"I'm so lucky, honestly. I'm so happy to be dancing with you tonight." The taller boy stated.
"Dear Merlin, this is great!" He exclaimed.
"Lastly, this school is where I ask her to marry me." Ron finished, then he got down on one knee and showed a ring box to Hermione.
All she had to do now was wait.
Ginny glared at her, but almost immediately cut to the chase. "There's something you need to see."
"Oh, there he is!" said Ron, pointing at Draco, who was sitting on the other side of the bar.
Hermione covered her mouth with her hands as she gasped. "Ah I knew it!" she said contentedly. Then, she walked towards them and proceeded to squeeze them both into a tight hug.
"To be honest, I'm surprised she even knows how to use magic, given her background..." Draco said with a shrug. Harry gave him a look. Oh, of course he would use one of his 'mudblood remarks' now. "Please, Draco. Don't. I know that this whole mudblood hater thing was just a charade that you had to keep up for your father."
"Dear, are you sure we can invest our total trust into him?" he asked her, apparently not convinced of his loyalty.
"Oh, that's our cue. Let's go back to the altar, guys!" said Hermione, letting go of Draco's face. She grabbed her dress and walked towards where Ron was standing. She turned around to motion for her friends to follow her.
The next morning, everyone but Fleur, Bill and Molly woke up late, at around eleven.
Harry's breath caught in his throat at the sight of his fiancé. He could have sworn that he had never seen him more attractive than he was in that moment.
"Well he asked me if it was worth it, losing my father over him. I mean, it sounded a bit out of place. Like, who even is he?" as he said so, he let out a sigh of frustration.
"Don't say this." Harry told him. He then turned him around in order to face him. "Draco, look at me." He cupped his face in his hands. "We are better than them. All they want us to do is either attack them or run off crying. But we won't do any of these things, ok?"
"Draco..." The other boy said, unable to continue his speech, as he sobbed.
Domodils had no mercy on people who didn't keep their word.
Harry and Draco kissed, too, then followed suit.
Ron and Harry were discussing how the simulation might have gone. "I don't think I got a good mark, Harry." Ron told his best friend. "Bloody witch always grades my works poorly."
It wasn't like she had dignified him with a letter.
She had been waiting for her to tell her that for a very long time.
Donald Granger looked a little embarrassed at his mother's behaviour. "Mum, sit properly, we have guests." He warned.
It was like Xenophilius had taken a golden glitter shower, but he didn't really mind.
The rest of the match was breathtaking. Gwenog Jones was a wonderful beater, she never missed a Bludger. Her seeker, Stella, was also pretty amazing, Harry observed.
Pansy removed Draco's arm in a violent motion, then she obeyed.
Harry, on the other hand, wasn't affected by Fleur's presence, at all. He exploded in a sound laugh. "Ron used to have a crush on her, once." he explained to his boyfriend.
Another pretend muggle did the same with Blaise and Narcissa.
Harry finally stopped running, then he turned around.
The eccentric teacher was sitting on her chair, grading papers for some first-years.
Ginny should have had a worse time than her, since Ron was her own brother, but that wasn't the case.
"Why, did he make you think about it?" the girl asked. Something in the way she asked seemed off, like she was eager to know the answer, but he chose not to mind it too much- Pansy was known to be a gossip.
"You did marvelously, Gin Gin!" Luna said, giving Ginny an Eskimo kiss and holding her hands.
"Oh, he would!" Ron confirmed.
"No." he responded, turning around to face the wall.
When he'd first set foot in Hogwarts, around eight years before, he was delighted to begin this new adventure. He'd had fun, during his first year. He'd met his best friends for life and had finally been able to experience the things that his brothers spoke so fondly of. He had also risked his life a couple times, once with a three-headed dog, once with a Devil's Snare... and his experience with Norbert wasn't too jolly. But, in the end, it had been an adventure.
The fact that she was wrapped into her lover's arms probably helpef lull her away.
"Therefore," Draco said, smiling through his wet face. "Yes. I will Marry you."
He hated that face, it usually indicated that the other boy had something unspeakable planned out in his mind and there was no escaping from it. Not that he minded-he couldn't wait to see what his plan was- but he was supposed to be studying. Draco, that slimy bastard, knew that he just couldn't say no to his 'hot requests'.
He and Harry were sitting next to each other, holding hands underneath the table, while Ron and Hermione were sitting opposite them, also holding hands.
"Check on grades together?" Draco mouthed back. Harry nodded, then turned to Ron.
"He deserved it! He called you a spicy ginger, only I can call you that!" Luna snorted.
"I will save you forever!" Luna exclaimed, finally dropping her anger.
"I promise to for ever beat you in Quidditch, but, mostly, to love you unconditionally for a thousand lives." Harry concluded, laughing with tears in his eyes.
"I'm trying, but I just can't." her husband whined. Try as he might, he wasn't able to flee the scene.
"Yay Ginny!" Luna squeaked, smiling even though she had lost.
At that, Pansy made a shocked face. "Oh Merlin!" the girl said, sitting closer to her friend. "How were you able to sleep?"
handprint had branded him, proof that Harry was real
As soon as Granger’s eyes landed on it, she paled and gasped, her hand covering her mouth.
Harry mouthed, but Draco
He saw Harry then; his lovely ghost, screaming silently, trying to shove at Draco’s demons.
"For Merlin's sake!"
Draco was cut off by a sharp glint in his Mother’s eyes, telling him she knew
Up and up to the rafters was where Harry took him, his coloured steps slow and careful and heavy along with Draco's. The solace of his hand, the illusion of his arm supporting his waist the only thing pushing Draco forward, one breath and step to the next.
Green eyes and the flash of a toothy grin – and Draco’s eyes betrayed him, the scene vanishing once more.
Draco’s heart lurched when he found everlasting flowers and a solitary candle under one.
His fingers reached out gently to run over the words Harry had written. He closed his eyes at the sensation, knowing that he now stood where Harry once had.
There was so much that he could have had.
Greg was quiet for a while, and then looked up at him. "After Crabbe? I'm done losing people. I haven't got a lot of friends, you know. I can't lose the only other one. But if you are, you know… if something really is going on, I'd rather know now than…"
"No," Draco said.
The aftermath, the stillness and quiet of him on the ground, and his eyes distantly fixated up at the grey sky, still the greenest bloom of colour.
dead and there is no point –
“Twenty points from Slytherin, for being lackadaisical when in charge of such a volatile brew," Slughorn stated angrily, still casting his gaze up at the rafters like Draco, huffing.
well. Thank you. I’ll just
kissing his shoulder, stroking his hair, and then, quieting into it. Draco just held him with all the little strength he had, swaying along to the gentle little rocking motions.
"Draco," Harry whispered, and his lips
Draco shifts behind him, away from his back and onto a shoulder, looking down at him. "Are you alright?" He sounds bemused.
There was a moment of shock that flashed across Greg’s features, and then a slow recognition. Draco knew what he had just admitted, and there was no shame in his belly. There was no fear in his heart.
Draco still wasn’t sure saving Harry was a purely conscious decision. He had been so frightened, and his Aunt Bellatrix was in one of her more violent moods, his father in one of his more frightened ones. He was glad he had given his wand, even if at the time he feared for his life without it.
Hence, he didn’t try for a third and relaxed totally when he heard Madam Pomfrey’s muttering. He was breathing in the lemon-lavender scent of the sheets when she finally pottered to Draco after telling of a first year off for slapping an exploding snap card against his own forehead.
, Harry's lips shaped, and then he pressed the tips of Draco's fingers back with his own, sliding into the spaces in between. Near-solid. Chilling.
“He carried it everywhere with him in those last months.” Granger audibly swallowed against her grief. “We still never figured it out – but he must have. I wish...but I suppose life has its mysteries.” She seemed to speaking more to herself than anything. Still, Draco nodded sympathetically.
Harry blinks. "What I want?"
“Let me go, please! Let me
“You’re a bit of an odd bean, aren’t you Lovegood?” Draco’s features contorted into a combination of something amused and a frown.
He never understood why, had always thought he was the only one who felt this way, and so he kept his feelings locked away in a corner of himself. He only acted on what made sense to him, and that was his jealousy, his bitterness and resentment.
” Draco then all but ran from the infirmary.
"Lay down," he said to him. Draco smiled, an overjoyed breath. He was dying and he knew this, but he'd never felt more alive than he did now, feeling Harry's life and body and warmth against his hands.
"You did, you do," she said, softly, gently. “We care, you know.”
Potter’s life had not been the fairy-tale as it was presented to Draco as a young boy.
he’d prayed a thousand time before now.
Draco clenched his jaw against the burn in his eyes, but he kept reading, even as it tore at his insides.
"Get back here Potter!" Snape shouted, but there was no way in hell Harry was going anywhere except
The smile slipped slowly from Potter’s too-real mouth, and now green eyes stared unblinkingly – blank and shallow.
The thought had Draco leaving his bed very quickly and almost cursing at the white sheets that wouldn’t unwrap themselves.
It's intense, a little fast and hard, and it's brilliant.
"That's not something to rely on," Luna said.
Draco swallowed, his lips bitten to stop its involuntary twitching. He had to smother a flinch when Harry had spoken, the sound of his voice as surprising as it was vexing. Any notion of his remaining stoicism was out the window. He simply couldn’t muster the energy.
"No, I didn’t you thrice-damned—" Draco stopped himself when he saw Harry step out of a shadowy alcove to his right, his expression unhappy.
Burns sat on him, and smiled down at him with all teeth.
Harry doesn't really know what he's supposed to do, though, so he just stares at Draco and then smiles at him, but it comes out a little nervous and awkward, maybe. Draco presses his lips together, exasperated as he rolls his eyes slightly. He steps forward, lifts his spidery-thin hands out of his black winter-coat pockets and takes Harry's face in his hands like Harry had wanted to do to him yesterday on the bench.
It was also the time he started becoming more aware of the way they looked at him.
Draco stares at him for a long moment. He shakes his head. "I don't understand. You—you lived with your relatives, did you not? Your mother's sister?"
Draco swallowed his anger, and it was replaced with self-loathing. He couldn’t bear to be the reason for Harry’s sadness.
Draco watched, vexed, as Narcissa slowly stood and walked away from him.
"Tell me, Harry. What are we, really?"
"May I hold you?" Draco asks, after a long moment of only breathing together in the silence.
So he pulls at Draco's hand and draws him close, nose pressed up against his, and he murmurs against his lips, "Kiss me."
Instead, Draco followed after some strange urge to look through the book, carefully turning the next page, past the contents and the introduction and onto the first chapter. The pages were worn, as if thoroughly read. This had been Potter's favourite class, particularly in Third Year with Professor Lupin teaching them.
The burn of tears already bloomed as he smoothed the paper out. And there was his name,
But then he steps away from him, inexplicably, and Harry wonders if he's noticed the strain in his smile and the stiffness of his response,
Draco nodded, then held it out for her to inspect. He was nervous now. Granger had clearly seen this item before, and her expression upon seeing it made him tense.
"They're Ron and Hermione," is all Harry can say.
“He shouldn’t have died,” Draco found himself saying.
“Though, as concerning as your silence is, it’s moot if we humour the possibility that I’ve finally cracked.” Draco exhaled harshly. “I mean,
Draco turned to Goyle slowly, and he felt the cold of Harry's hands on his own.
After glaring at a small first year Slytherin who had caught him in the act, Draco’s eye caught on a glint of gold. The flash was so bright, he could see its afterimage burned into his sight, casting blue-green flashes in his vision. Blinking it away, Draco tried to zone in on where the flash came from. He was somewhat concerned that the flash might have been a spell, instead of something more benign.
"Ah, I see. Well, I'd say that it's a bit too soon, maybe? I mean, the scandal only got out in December - although I'm inclined to think that your relationship started a month prior. But then again, who am I to stop this? After all, I married my first husband at eighteen and I had known him for around... two months?" Miss Sivan responded.
Ron immediately noticed that Hermione wasn't eating anything. "What is going on here?" He asked her. But what he got in response from her was a "Mind your business!"
Before Harry could realise what was going on, his old room mate, fellow DA member and close friend, Neville Longbottom, had already cast Petrificus Totalus on him.
Ron noticed that his best friend had not taken his boyfriend to dance, so he became curious as to why he would refuse to do so.
"Oh I ran into Hermione and your brother, who were hoping to use the Room for themselves, and she said that she knew who was inside."
Harry pretended it hurt. "Ow!"he said, but he giggled right after.
"Before we can all engage in this dance, Ron and I need to tell you something... We're having a baby!" she shouted.
"Oh get lost, Malfoy!" She shouted at him and then kept on running. She was crying freely.
"I'm so nervous!" Draco said. He was going to spend the next two weeks of his life with the Weasleys, the very people he had treated like scum for years. He wasn't sure how to feel about that.
Draco knew what Potter was playing at. He wanted to be in a cute relationship filled with flowers and chocolates.
The Slytherin's side all roared in chants of excitement, including Blaise.
"I lost my family, Harry!" The Slytherin cried, wetting Harry's robe with his tears.
"I know, but it won't be the same! We have so many memories here, together!" Harry said, his voice still broken from crying.
Oh, no. Were Draco's lying abilities that terrible?
By the looks of it, it must have been an office. There was a desk filled with quills, books and semi-opened ink bottles.
The components of the pair were both barely twenty-year-olds, yet they were ready to tie the knot.
Lucius slowly took his son away from his mother's grasp and smiled through his tears upon carrying him in his arms. "Hello, Draco." He whispered. Rocking him slightly, Lucius managed to soothe the baby. He stopped crying, he only moved his head around slightly, fluttering his tiny eyes open and closed.
When it was time for cake and the attention fell back on the newly weds, Molly went to talk to her daughter and Luna.
"So sorry, man... but I need to go study. I'm so behind on Transfiguration..." Pansy said, then she left the room, hurriedly.
And he wanted to feel like this for the rest of his life.
"So if you wanted me present at your wedding, I'd be happy to oblige." Mrs Malfoy said, letting tears escape her eyes, putting a loving hand on her son's shoulder.
On the other hand, he was far from a reconciliation with Hermione. She knew of his 'Malfoy Escapades' and she wasn't in any way willing to accept them. She felt as if she had been betrayed.
Not long after, the door swung open, revealing a smiling couple. Hermione's parents looked very clean and nice, their teeth were unbelievably white.
"No, your life is over! The whole school will know!" Pansy replied, eying the camera in Ginny's grip.
"Father, what are you doing here?"
***********************************************************************************************
Her sobs made her whole body shake and she couldn't control her smile from making her face cramp.
Also, there was one thing that was constantly tucking at its brain. How he would have spent Christmas. Professor Slughorn, who was now head of the Slytherin house, had made a list of the students who would spend Christmas at Hogwarts and he was pressuring Draco to tell him what his intentions were, but he didn't feel like getting into it just yet.
"And at a wedding, how romantic!" Hannah Abbott stated in a dreamy voice.
"You teased me into it." The dark haired boy stated.
"I do." George said, smiling uncontrollably.
"Look, you're free to choose. But I would love to spend Christmas with you. I could stay here, but I already promised Molly I'd go..." Harry said, looking at him with pleading eyes.
Otherwise, you will suffer the consequences of your betrayal.
"Why should I believe you, uh? You've done nothing but lie your way through things for eight years!" Ron spat.
Draco couldn't read her facial expression, he wasn't sure what it meant, to be honest. It felt a bit weird for him, since he had called her the worst fat shaming names in the past.
"Oh, hi guys! Looking for a place to make love?" Luna asked as it were an innocent question.
The room was complete with a table filled with butterbeers and snacks and there was a pouf for each person to sit on.
"But you're, like, a thousand times more interesting than this piece of wood." Luna chanted.
"It will be alright." Harry whispered. "I know the feeling."
She placed a hand on her mouth and hurled in the direction of the castle.
Hermione shook her head.
"That's what you get for ripping my heart in two." Ginny said, in a faux calm tone.
"I can't tell you that.' Potter said. He had no doubt about it.
Draco was surprised at the way Goyle was talking to him. He never would have done it a year before. He wanted to threaten him, but he was far too distraught to do so. So, he ignored him.
"Oh well, if she's busy she surely doesn't need me as a distraction, no?" Harry promptly responded.
The theory would have made sense, if weren't for the fact that Mr Germain was male. And Lucius hated homosexuals.
"...and now, time for Harry's words!" Said Arthur Weasley, wiping a residue of his tearful speech.
When she was lucid again, she thought it only made sense to return her 'favour'.
"Ginny," Harry said. "I swear to you, I never cheated on you. I got with Draco after our relationship had ended." He took her hand into his. Ginny looked at the hand and sighed.
The Slytherin girl turned around, annoyed. "What do you want now, freckles?"
The NEWTs pressure and the occasional haunting memories of the previous year had been very harsh on Harry and his ability to concentrate, even on his beloved subject.
She suddenly didn't care that Luna was a girl anymore.
"Don't mention that moron." said Harry. "He didn't, by chance, happen to molest you, did he?" he asked his boyfriend.
"Me? You're the one who disturbed me! I was just walking when you cornered me!"
After that, he woke up sweating. "Oh no..." It was only a dream and Harry hated himself so, so much for it. How could he just have dreamed of snogging Malfoy, of all people? And how could he let himself like it? It was just his mind playing games, cause there was no way that he could ever think those things in real life. He could only hope that he hadn't made a sound during his sleep. He was wrong.
A few days after the 'incident' there was still bad blood between Ginny and the Gryffindors plus Draco. The girl had given up trying to explain herself, as she was considered a traitor.
His howler, it seemed, was not filled with empty threats, it was a promise.
Luna's little quirks never failed to warm her heart.
Harry hesitated, but then thought that, since he had taken the veritaserum, he wouldn't be able to lie, so he nodded.
He had finally said it. After years of bottling this up, he had found the courage to spit it out in his father's face, at last.
"Hi, Bill, right?" he said.
The woman and her son were going on about memories and happy times, when Narcissa mentioned the wedding ceremony.
He couldn't be more excited to start the new year, he was sure that it would be pretty good, if Harry was by his side.
Harry smiled, tightening his grip around her. "Thank you, Gin."
"Do come in!" the teacher said in her calm tone.
"Attention, everyone!" The Headmistress shouted, getting up from her seat, her palms up. "As you know, next year most of you will be coming back within these walls, but for some of our students today is a very melancholic day. With great honour, I present you our Seventh-years valedictorians! First one to start, miss Hermione Granger" She gave a rigorous applause.
It was Draco's turn to roll his eyes now.
"Thank you for your services, really. Your information is crucial for the fulfillment of our plan." Narcissa said, beaming.
Lucius was standing with the Daily Prophet in his grasp.
George wrapped an arm around his new wife, pulling her closer as his friend delivered such beautiful words.
Ginny noticed her friend's hopeful yet scary look. She didn't know, if she had to be honest. Although, her brother wasn't certainly known for being the bravest man the Wizarding World had even seen. The chances of him running away were high.
He, too, was smiling.
"Typical spot for couples. Though Harry and I never went..." Ginny observed.
"You are a charmer, Potter." He murmured. "And as much as I would love round 2, we have to get to Ron and Hermione, they must be worried." He said, tapping his shoulder as a way to tell him to get up.
Draco's face was paler than usual.
He knew that the jeweler wasn't fond of delivering items by owl and, in addition to it, money to pay for it was in Gringott's.
"And I should have... listened to you instead of guilt tripping you!"
"We're not afraid of you, Potter." Blaise said. "You are just a pompous shit who struts around saying that he saved the world. But you're just a fairy, is all that you are." He said in a disgusted voice.
"Oh right, shoot, almost forgot." said Harry, flicking his wand. Then, a present appeared. "My present for you."
Ron captured the guests' attention by hitting a bottle of butterbeer with his wand, producing a clink.
Narcissa Malfoy had complained about that decision, but accepted to go anyway, as it was her son's wedding.
"Draco..."Ron said, giving him a pitiful look. "If I may... It's simply not worth it... I know this sounds harsh but they will never accept you, not if they don't open their minds."
That year, in addition to it, the Headmistress had organised a Graduation Speech, which meant that the Prefects from each House had to speak in regarding of their experience in Hogwarts.
"I don't have a roommate now, though." Said Draco, changing the subject.
The morning after Draco woke up in Harry's arms. He was confused at first, but then recalled what had happened the night before. He had agreed to a relationship with none other than Harry Potter. If a year ago anyone had told him that he'd ever become his boyfriend, he would have laughed in their face. But there he was, all cuddled up with him. He couldn't believe this. After years of this crush that had made him hate himself so much, he was finally with him.
"But you could at least let me help you release the tension..." Ron suggested.
"Ok, now, if we're all set I think we can go on with the party." said Ron, motioning for everyone to follow him.
"The way your smile dropped when Ron said the thing about me not being with you for today." said Harry.
"I don't really care about the looks, honestly." Draco declared.
Wow, and he thought their love could overcome every issue along the way.
"Oh." The Gryffindor girl said, as if she had finally understood the mystery surrounding those creatures.
She was wearing a golden gown, this time, and her hair was wrapped in a fancy bun.
"You little git! How dare you speak to my friend like that? If you don't stop, I'll throw you in the lake!"
Professor McGonagall was on leave because of a death of a distant relative, so there was only one person in the whole school that could have accepted; Miss Sivan.
"And these are my friends, Harry and Draco." Hermione said, grinning and putting her arms around their shoulders.
True, they had not been together for a long time, but it was proven to him, in many occasions, that they were soulmates.
Oh, sure, now Malfoy had to play the victim.
He had completely drowned into him and he didn't want, for anything in the world, to go back to the surface.
It was located near a deserted beach. It was concealed from Muggle eyes with a disillusionment  charm, as the stadium would been to big to hide.
"Farewell, Hogwarts."
Narcissa was more confused than she had ever been in her entire life. She jerked her head slightly to see that both Blaise and Neville were being held down by Hagrid.
"I'd say you are." The black haired boy said, ready to take his wand out.
"Sorry, I'm late, I just had a lot going on." the person on the other line spoke.
Her parents knew that already, so, of course, they didn't act too surprised. But they were happy to become grandparents so they cheered for her.
"Give me your feet." Harry simply said.
Mrs Weasley gave her half a smile, an eyebrow raised. "Oh, I don't mean that." she said, looking from Ginny to Luna, then back to her daughter.
"That'd be you, Malfoy." Harry replied sassily. Oh, how he loved his sassy come backs at Malfoy. He couldn't hurt him, really.
On their way back to the castle, the two couples saw Pansy approaching to them.
The maid of honour was Rosemary Granger.
"Sure you would." Harry sounded pretty convinced of that. Something about this talk reminded him of his dream from the night before. It felt like it was coming to reality.
"Relax, I'm not gonna detach them from your body." Harry said with a chuckle. Then, he pointed his wand at his boyfriend's feet. A moment later, his shoes had turned into ice skates.
No one spoke for a while, it was too much to process, all at once.
"You're really disgusting, did you know that?"
It still had its original vintage vibe, but Molly had applied lacy decorations over the old layers of tulle and organza. She'd modified the top, breaking the round neck part into a V-neckline, and added beads to the ball gown skirt for shimmer.
They stayed like this for a while. They didn't even need to move.
"My wife has been very convincing, I reckon." Mr Malfoy intervened.
The groomsmen were Seamus and Dean, while the best man was George.
"Oh, yeah, he's very lovely." the girl said with a smile. "But, really... I can't get him to match clothes!"
"Does father know?" Asked Draco, while wrapping his fingers around his butterbeer mug handle, looking down on it.
A worried Pansy put her hand on his shoulder. "Draco? Are you ok?" she asked.
During these past four months, he would hold his breath every time he saw an owl approach, hoping that it was some sort of apology letter from his parents, begging him to come back home, telling him that he was accepted.
"But I do care! I am your mother, Draco." Narcissa scoffed.
"Look, I'm going to sleep, now. You do whatever you want. " Harry said, lying back down on the wall's side.
"Yeah, just... a bit anxious." Draco said. His anxiety hadn't left him, on the contrary, now that he was about to go to the house of a family who didn't see eye to eye with his, it was increasing by the second.
In his eighth year in the magical school, he had changed his ways. The war of the year before had made him reevaluate his life and realise what was really important to him.
"I couldn't sleep." Draco said. He rested his head on Harry's shoulder.
"I'd like to make a toast to my son and his new wife..."
"You don't know how bad I feel for you right now, Dracou." Jean Jacques said with a smirk.
"Surprise, Potter." She said, covering herself with her over-sized robe.
"You agree with my statement, don't deny that." Harry winked.
"Oh, so you did dream of me that night!" Draco said, surprised. "What did you dream I was doing?"
Harry had let himself down, in the first place.
"You guys are amazing! But Mione, your cake almost choked me!"
"Yay, that's awesome! " Ginny cheered, clapping her hands. "Well, I'd say my work here is done! And, since we were able to make this miracle, I guess I win the Hollyhead Harpies."
She came back minutes later holding a smiling Ron by his arm.
"And besides, I don't think Ron and Mione are going to murder us if we're two minutes late!" Said Harry while unlocking the door.
Not even Harry knew, but he was still in a great deal of pain when it came to his family situation.
Those tricks looked extremely hard for Luna, who usually never did them.
The pillows looked weird, though, as they were square.
"Who the fuck are you? What have we ever done to you, uh?" The Gryffindor spat, pushing the other boy physically.
"Ahh that's going to be great! I can hardly wait!" Harry said, excitedly. Then, he kissed his boyfriend on the cheek. "You will see, it will be so much fun! Molly always makes us those ugly jumpers for Christmas!"
Ron, Hermione, Draco and Harry were all sitting in the same compartment on the train, with the same positioning scheme as their double date in Hogsmeade.
With no further hesitation, Draco tore the envelope open.
"No! Are you out of your mind?" Draco said to Pansy in a loud whisper. How had Pansy found out about him and Harry? Had little miss Perfect AKA Granger tipped her off? It had to have been her. Draco felt like fainting in that moment. His heart was beating so fast that he could feel it in his neck.
An owl entered the place, flying through an open window.
The two teams flew to the center of the field, the visual effect was mesmerizing as their colours merged, creating a flash of pink and green light.
His second year hadn't been too fun - he'd almost lost his sister- but he'd still managed to create indelible memories with the two most important people in his life.
Hermione had chosen to wear her mother's wedding dress, however she wanted some changes made to it - all of which Molly took care of.
"Ugh can't we have a dorm just for the two of us?" said Harry, annoyed. "I'm starting to think this constant house division thing doesn't make much sense."
Draco laughed. "Oh yeah, sure, you really can't lie, Potty." The taller boy shook his head and then moved closer to him and put his arms around his neck, this time. "Let's see if you hate it so much." And then he kissed him. Harry's eyes widened, he was surprised. After a few seconds he let himself go and dived into the kiss, too. It felt so good, so right... But it's Malfoy! The voice in his head said. But he didn't want to care, he just wanted to feel those lips on his.
He took a breath, then he shyly placed a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"Well, it makes more sense for you to come here since everyone here is your friend, now." Harry pointed out.
This was living.
Draco cried out his name, as each second his member spent inside the hot cave of the other boy's mouth brought him closer to heaven.
"I had no doubt." the grey eyed boy said, stroking him faster. Harry arched his back in pleasure, gripping on the sheets. That was it, he was so, so close.
"I know, Luna, but... what if Hermione is a runaway bride?" Ron said, paranoid.
"Not as good as you!" Angelina broke in, beaming.
All of a sudden, his heart sank into his chest, breaking into a million pieces, as he witnessed something he never wished to see.
"I'm pregnant." Hermione repeated, slightly raising her voice. She gulped nervously.
"And you didn't hurt me, right?" Draco's tone was beginning to raise. "I'm telling you, if you're not going to accept me for who I am, then I have to ask you to leave."
He didn't think he deserved to be loved so much. He wondered what he had done to have the most amazing people in the world as his friends and lover.
"The show is over." Said Pansy, siding by Ginny.
"Oh," said Draco, looking at his fiancé lovingly. "Because we want to be together for the rest of our lives... Wait, how do you know about this?" He asked, even though the Hogwarts sneak theory made sense to him.
Ron, Hermione and Harry all turned their heads to check on the Slytherins.
She stopped speaking for a moment when she noticed that Draco was wearing a Gryffindor scarf while Harry was wearing a Slytherin one.
Hermione and Ron didn't really agree with him, as they didn't think the words "Draco" and "sweet" belonged in the same sentence. Harry saw that his friends were not so convinced, so he continued. "He just happened to be unlucky. He didn't really have a choice, he had to join in on Voldemort's plans or he would have been killed. But he wasn't too happy about being a death eater. Such thing made him suffer greatly."
"Look, my dear, I'm sorry that I didn't get in touch with you. As you know, your father won't smile at you if you contradict him." she voiced her apologies.
"And do you, Angelina Johnson, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and health, in good times and woe, for richer or poorer, keeping yourself solely unto him for as long as you both shall live?"
Now he had to hope that his boyfriend would believe his own truth, without the use of veritaserum.
"If you won't tell us what happened, then we can't really help you." said Ginny.
"What did I do now?" He asked. It had to be about him, it was most of the time.
The other four were also invited, so it was a great way to celebrate Draco's birthday as well, given it had been impossible to do it in the NEWTs week.
In the meantime, Ginny and Luna were celebrating their special occasion.
Saturday, 15th of May
Harry looked at him with a raised eyebrow. Did this guy have a problem with him?
"Seeing them today warms my heart greatly. I honestly can't imagine them being separated. I think Angelina is perfect for George, their personalities merge together beautifully." He continued.
Maybe he actually knew, if the news of Pansy's craziness had reached the French as well.
French.
Breathing heavily, Harry detached himself from his dancing partner and walked to where Arthur was standing.
Ron extended his hand for her to shake, but she simply stared at it in utter disgust.
"Ginevra Weasley, my ex and now sister/daughter, I want to thank you for every memory that we have. I think the two of us have been through a lot, but I cherish every moment. You are very important to me, so I want to pull this muggle tradition on you. I have to pull your ear nineteen times, it's for luck."
Neither of them wanted to put an end to that row.
"I'm the one who's surprised that you didn't let this secret slip." said Ginny, rolling her eyes.
Her innocent smile faded as she noticed that the other girl was sitting on her bed, only wearing her underwear.
"Yeah, you were a bitch." Draco confirmed.
"Well, boys, I'll leave you to it. I'm expecting you to work on what I've just told you, ok?" Miss Sivan said, then left as expected.
"Aren't you my biggest fan!" he giggled while cupping his lover's face with his hands.
It felt as if he had been sent from the heavens to cause a storm between Draco and Harry and then disappear, so that the repercussions would not affect him in the least.
"I need back up here!" Said Harry, calling to his friends, who happily obliged and went on to participate in the tickling frenzy.
Each table had their own vase of red roses as decoration on top.
When the guest left, Mr Malfoy turned his attention to his wife.
"Are you saying I'm not Gryffindor enough?" Harry playfully asked, pretending to be offended at Draco's remarks.
"Not what Hermione told me." said Draco.
Harry nodded, then they all went back to their tickle filled torture.
It was definitely a girl, as the voice suggested. It was slow and a bit dreamy. There was no more doubt as to who that was when Harry heard the words "crumple horned snorkacks".
As they spoke, Jean Jacques' features softened, his height shrunk and his hair grew longer.
" Look, it might come as a shock to you, given I'm not the brightest wizard there is, but, Harry... I'm not blind, I saw what happened today. It looked as if Malfoy was about to kiss you... and you didn't seem too mad about that." Ron said. Crap, what now? There was no way Harry could lie his way out of it. He wished that Ron and Hermione hadn't been there to witness that 'incident'.
"Well, as we both know, on Saturday, my friends George and Angelina are getting married- I mean, of course you know, since you're officiating it- and I'm planning something special for that day" He said, all in one breath.
"Ah, silly me. Almost forgot." the Ravenclaw continued, looking like she had forgotten to do something very important. Then, she took Ginny's face in her hands and planted a kiss on her lips.
"But I told you, I did it cause I love-"
"About that..." Said Hermione, smirking.
"Yeah. This is nothing." Harry responded, laughing softly. "Hi, friends!"he then said to them.
"You see, sharing is better than bullying." he said, taking Draco's hand in his own.
"Well." Narcissa said, when her fancy drink was placed in front of her. Her eyed then fixed on the ring on her son's left hand. "Marriage, uh? What pushed you to make this choice?"
Draco had to sit in order to process the news. "So, now, everyone in the Wizarding World knows?" he asked Hermione, who nodded.
"There will be no problems." He said to Hermione, ignoring his boyfriend.
"Mr and Mrs Weasley, I'm sure you already know why you're here." Said the Headmistress.
Harry could finally understand why Neville had petrified him. He felt so bad for him, his friend was very easy to manipulate and the Malfoys' cruelty pushed him to do the unthinkable.
"Um... no. Mum said that he never would have agreed to that, so... she said a surprise would be better." Ron said. He, too, seemed a bit nervous.
He was home.
At least, the way he said Draco was different.
Her husband was holding her hand, as he had been during the whole delivery process, while her newborn was in the hands of the midwife, who was washing him.
"You are my favourite thing about Hogwarts, too." The blond declared. There was nothing truer than that, he was sure of it.
"So, is everyone ready?" asked Ginny, as her girlfriend zipped her up.
Hermione's mouth opened to speak, but she was interrupted by the sound of her boyfriend's voice, coming from the bathroom.
"Gotcha!" Harry exclaimed, the Golden Snitch firmly between his fingers.
Just as Draco had predicted. It was Pansy. His friend and confidant, Pansy.
"Happy Easter!" Ron repeated.
"He's changed, I reckon. I could get him to buy the Quibbler, maybe." said Luna. "Don't pretend that you're not about to cry, Gin Gin. You can cry freely with me. Unless you get your tears in my drink, I don't care."
Upon reaching the Great Hall, where everyone was gathering for dinner time, they spotted Ginny and Pansy right at the center of the room.
The woman made sure that she was alone, then she locked the door behind her with a spell.
"Not many days ago, when I tried to speak to you near the Room of Requirement, I had been there long enough to hear you two talk about how you had used that room for your dirty doings..."Ginny explained. "And I just thought that Parkinson could be interested in knowing this, too. I knew I'd find you here. Very unwise of you not to use the invisibility cloak, Harry." She finished, pointing at the camera in her hand.
"This," he said, getting in the Slytherin girl's face. "Is for making out with my boyfriend."
"Hey, baby!" Harry greeted him happily. " Did you send our best regards?"
"You had never taken the initiative to kiss me in front of everyone, It was always me who did."
"Why not? I do want to know!" Said Luna, genuinely curious.
How could they turn their back on him? After all, he was still a prefect. And not to mention he had helped build everyone's reputation. Now his own reputation had fallen apart.
Now, it was all about bravery and pushing others to never be afraid of their surroundings.
No one believed him, he was painted as a calculating person, when he was just trying to prove his innocence.
"Well, I listened to some of the other things you said while asleep." the Slytherin purred into Harry's ear, then he winked.
"The saying is 'may the best team win' not 'may the worst team win'." Harry said with a wink, earning a death stare.
"Two." She said. "And one red currant rum with lemon zest and three ice cubes, please."
Hermione couldn't prevent her cheeks from becoming as red as a beetroot.
"I'm so excited! I saw 'em grow up right before me eyes!" Hagrid cried and then blew his nose into his sheet-looking handkerchief.
(See the end of the chapter for
As absurd as it sounded, it felt like it was mad at Draco, too.
Luna, Ginny, Harry and Draco were all sitting on top of their trunks, trying to recover from their traumatizing experience.
"Lucius Malfoy, wasn't a year in Azkaban enough for you? I'm afraid you will get more for this."
Draco's laughs echoed through the courtyard as he thought that these people were truly wonderful to him. He would have never been able to thank them enough.
Draco was reminded of the first time he'd tried burgers. This dish, too, had to be eaten with your hands. He reluctantly grabbed a slice, having some of the toppings fall from it, then he took a bite.
"Dunno. Gotta go, have fun, guys!" Luna said, then she hopped out of sight.
"Mione, where is he getting at?" Ron asked.
He feared him. Sometimes, the sound of his steps alone was enough to make him shudder.
"I hope you behaved." Her mother whispered to her, then she pulled away and pinched her cheek.
"No, I realized that there is no... spark... between us, I-"
"I won't let my son marry this scum!" Lucius' voice boomed through the venue. He had the most disgusting expression on his face.
"Yeah, but we have many things to do... You need to change into muggle clothes before my Gran can see us... she's coming to collect us in London. Did you pack everything in? Harry, did you put Viridis in the owlery? Did you all get Toothbrushes? My parents are dentists, they care about dental hygiene..." the only girl in the group babbled.
Angelina Johnson
Ginny nodded.
Harry guided Draco as they skated their way towards  one of the shores, where they made their first stop. "Was it that bad?" Harry asked, grinning widely. But when he looked at his boyfriend he couldn't suppress a laugh. Draco showed the angriest death stare ever.
"Hey, guys, are you Ok?" Said Luna while coming out of the bathroom, ready to go.
"Yes, it's no big deal. Sorry if I ever lash out you... I don't really mean to." His girlfriend simply said, giving him an apologetic look.
"What has gotten into you lately, Draco?" Blaise asked his friend, down at the Slytherin table. He must have noticed his enhanced good mood. Plus, the way he kept glancing at the Gryffindor table didn't help.
After all, Harry's requests could have been as innocent as a 'fix my tie'.
The Malfoys, though, were good at concealing their true intentions.
"I have my ways." His boyfriend responded.
The fact that one of them was your son and didn't mention such life-changing event to you, for example.
Many boys in the class were mesmerized by her apparent delicate manners, but in reality she was a very strong witch. Perfect for the subject, Harry always thought.
It was Lucius Malfoy, sided by Blaise Zabini.
"Good Morning, boys." said Laura, a bright smile painted on her lips.
"Angelina's mum has already got that covered, she's a magical tailor." Ron explained.
Harry had to fight the temptation to rip all of her hair off, piece by piece.
"What problem? Worse than you missing Quidditch practice?" Ron said in a bitter tone. But there was no time for futile grudges. "Really, Ron? Now you're gonna be all offended? Your devil of a sister found out that Draco and I were together and she had Pansy tell her that we were in Miss Sivan's office, then they went there and took an incriminating picture of us, which they're going to scatter across the whole school!" Harry said, all in one breath.
After infinite plot twists, the winner was Luna, much to the surprise of everyone.
"Fine, Molly. But I'm only giving him one chance!" Arthur said, ready to walk upstairs to talk to Draco, but stopped as he saw that he, Harry and Ginny were all coming down.
"So," she began, sitting next to where Ginny was. "Care to fill me in?"
Draco tried to say, but his mother's unbelievably calm voice got the best of his.
"Oh I can't be too surprised, my dear friend." said Luna. "He literally ogled him all the time. I don't think the nargles had anything to do with it, at this point." Luna raised her shoulders.
"Yeah, but... I mean, this is a special occasion... You say maybe I could have gone with her? It's not like they invited me or anything." Ron complained. Sometimes, he was worse than Hermione when it came to sulking.
"Oh, naturally. I tried to convince him it was good news - he hasn't spoken to me since. So I fear he won't be attending." The woman said in a gloomy voice.
His boyfriend was smiling uncontrollably at his words. "No, thank you for accepting to come here, in spite of  your old feuds, all out of love. Really, how many people can say they have a boyfriend as good as you?"
Mr Malfoy's amplified scream was so loud that all four of them jumped back, startled.
Seamus and Dean wouldn't stop thanking him for all the good times and for giving them the strength to be themselves. Neville was the saddest to let Harry go, it seemed.
Harry could only agree with it.
"I am never taking an airplane again!" he grumbled as he got out of the bathroom in the Nantes Airport. He had just been sick there.
A/N: Second to last chapter, y'all :( so sad that there's only one more, but everything comes to end.
"Luna!" Ginny cried out as she inadvertently came.
It was almost too much to handle.
"I have to apologise for my Mother-in-Law, She has a bit of senile dementia... i hope you're not too uncomfortable at hiding your magical aspects." said Laura, giving Harry the cutlery to put on the table.
"Good evening everyone!" He started, adjusting his glasses on his nose. "I've known these two for almost eight years and I can tell you that they were marvelous Quidditch players!"
Draco wondered why he'd asked him that question, but he didn't want to mind it too much, he was too tired to care. Maybe Jean Jaques' only purpose in life was to annoy people when he was too bored to sleep. Either way, it was too late at night for this shit.
