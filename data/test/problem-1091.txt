Draco's frown smoothes out in understanding. He leans up, one hand cupping at the back of Harry's neck to pull him closer.
, it has decided before Draco's mind has a chance to catch up. Wide green eyes are watching him go, but Draco doesn't look back. His hands are shaking.
He kisses Harry deep, and dirty, sucking on Harry’s lip and pressing him back against the kitchen counter. It’s uncomfortable, digging into the meat of Harry’s arse, but Draco’s hands are creeping up the back of his top and his thigh is perfect between Harry’s legs. Harry’s not moving for anything.
having a breakdown. Or at least, whatever he took Ron to mean by that. The clash of who Harry had been all his life and what he’d lived with, and who he wanted to be now, was weighing on him in ways he didn’t know how to handle. He’d heard once that some soldiers, after their wars had been fought and won, found it harder to live during peacetime. Harry wondered if that was what he was going through.
Harry doesn’t care what any of them are ‘just sayin’’. He and Draco are mates, and that in itself is miracle enough, and so what if Draco is a bit fit and Harry is a bit prone to noticing that. He notices lots of things: trees, cats in his garden, that sushi is gross but somehow stinky cheese isn’t. That Draco’s bum is amazing. All just normal things, it’s no big deal.
"Just think about it," he repeats, quickly scrawling the address of the flat he’s temporarily renting on the pale skin of Potter’s inner forearm. He tries not to notice the gentle lilac and blue veins under Potter’s skin. His writing is wobblier than usual, his hand trembling slightly. He fights to keep his grip on Potter’s wrist gentle. "And meet me at this address tomorrow evening if you decide yes."
"Ugh, yes. We’re not, like." Harry rips open the biscuits in lieu of answering properly, then shoves one in his mouth. A mouthful of chewed-up biscuit is a good conversation ender, he’s found. He doesn’t like this chat, or that fact that Agatha keeps trying to have it with him. Or that Hermione does too. Or that bloody Ron even mentioned something about how Harry, "Talks to that bloke an awful lot for someone who apparently doesn't want to get into his fancy knickers. What, I’m just,
"Better be." Harry's voice is a low rumble, his eyes wide and his whole body thrumming with anticipation.
responds Harry, feeling gooey and stupid and deeply touched that Draco saw a tree and thought of Harry. It’s really pathetic and Harry knows it. Never mind it might be a horrible tree, seeing as Draco doesn’t like his current location. He said the tree was
It takes Harry two tries before he finds the right door to the bathroom, fingers slipping a little clumsily over the ornate handle in his morning stupor. The bathroom tiles are clean and white, and freezing, underneath his feet. Harry pisses, leaning one shoulder against the wall as he does and resisting the urge to close his eyes again and doze off. Power napping while having a wee has never been suggested to him as a good idea, and Harry’s sure Draco would murder him if he got piss on his fancy bathroom floor. Murder him, and feed him to the peacocks, no doubt. Harry flushes the loo, smiling to himself again as he makes his way to the sink to wash his hands.
“Yes.” There's a quill and ink on the desk in front of the Healer, and he reaches for them now, then strokes his fingers across the soft edges of the quill. “Amateur astronomers, for the most part, out to catch a glimpse of something celestial.” The Healer’s smile turns almost wistful.
Daco times his steps to land on whole paving slabs, avoiding stepping on the cracks where he can. He’d be driving the people around him spare, were there more people around, but this isn’t a thriving part of the city at 10pm. The streets are winding, the bare brick walls around him slightly sinister with their rough edges and looming height. It’s safe around here, though. Draco’s the most dangerous thing on these little streets at the moment. And he’s incredibly well-behaved.
’ might be a bit much as far as the things they had previously introduced into their bedroom dirty talk repertoire, but then again Harry had been wanking to the idea of that ― of Draco’s come inside him, of him whispering filth into Harry’s ears as he filled him up ― for about a fortnight, so what the hell. It was definitely going to make Draco come faster, that was for sure.
“Oh fuck yes, yes.” Harry panted, fingers clawing at the dark wood of the headboard. He felt one of Draco's hands leave his arse, moving between his own legs to fist himself. Harry groaned, low and guttural at the idea of Draco touching himself while he ate Harry out, and then again as his orgasm hit the base of his spine, running over his skin and down his legs as he came. His cock
"This is all I've found," he explains. "Names, who I'm looking for, where they might be. Some leads." Potter licks his lips, then shakes the folder in a gesture for Draco to take it.
Potter continues to stare at him inscrutably for another long moment before he turns away. He nods, pushing his glasses further up his nose with one finger. "You didn’t know," he says definitively. It’s a statement not a question.
Draco snorts a startled laugh. He pinches the back of Harry's thigh quickly, making Harry jump. "It's not as dire as that, Potter." He kisses the reddened skin where his fingers had been.
"Just right now?" he asks, leaning back a lot as Draco's kisses slip lower. Harry's breathing is heavy around the wet sensation of Draco's lips.
“And you’re cranky,” Draco said rolling on his back with a yawn. 65% awake, now, Harry reckoned. “Wake up hungry again?”
Potter shifts his gaze slightly to the left of Draco, then shakes his head. His expression has slipped into that sad almost-resignation Draco thought he saw before. He’s certain he sees it now. "Difficult for anyone, I imagine," Potter says softly.
Perhaps he just recognised Draco and decided to be a royal prick and give him eternal life to live on in infamy.
The club is down a back street, away from any main roads or bustling pedestrian areas. Outside, people are sparse; there's a man smoking next to the doorway, and a couple who appear to be having a fight a little further down. One of them might be crying, their gestures turning more and more animated as their partner scowls down at the pavement, arms crossed. Looking around, Draco sees Potter pacing near the alleyway Draco was waiting at when they first arrived.
Harry clears his throat, rubbing his palm over the stubble on his cheeks. He glances at Draco,  who’s leaning against the wall, arms folded and entire posture oozing fatigue, to see if he’s noticed anything, picked anything up off of Harry. Draco doesn’t mention it, though, or seem anything other than tired and mildly bemused by Harry’s quietness. Harry thinks he can pass that off as just being a result of the odd night.
, etc. It faded as quickly as it came, like all knee-jerk reactions do. Harry didn’t seem pathetic, or like he wanted Draco to leave, or to combust on the spot, like Draco expected. Above all, Draco did want to stay. This was his spot, and he could share it. So he did.
Beside him, Potter laughs under his breath. "Not your kind of place?" he jokes, softly. The room doesn't appear to be affecting him the way it is Draco. Draco's oddly glad of that; Potter is the most powerful wizard Draco's ever met. He can't help but feel safe around him, whether that's currently merited or not. Of course, magical ability aside, if Potter doesn't find this club repugnant then he is clearly still an imbecile.
Draco then changes into the grey vest and similarly-coloured trackies he likes to relax in and sits down on the edge of the bed. He rests his bare arms on his knees and lets out a breath he feels like he’s been carrying inside him for hours. He hangs his head, then stares at the corner of the room where he first saw the figure in his dreams. His mind is racing, the way his thoughts always do as soon as he has a moment to pause and properly let them come together. It makes sense, what Potter has told him, confirms Draco’s suspicions that the dreams were connected to Potter in some way. At the same time, it makes no sense at all. Draco’s never come across something like this. All he knows about the possible state of his own soul comes from the literature he’s managed to scare up on his travels about possible vampiric origins. He knows so little about Horcruxes, about magic that can scar a soul and leave it looking for a remedy on its own volition. He’s completely out of his depth.
The vampire was gone when Draco regained consciousness, in an alleyway and with the metallic taste of blood coating his mouth and warming his insides. It takes more than a bite to make a vampire—vampiric magic has to be shared, drunk down in greedy gulps by the dying prey should the vampire be feeling generous, or broody, or whatever the fuck was going through the bloke’s head when he decided to turn Draco that night.
Upstairs in the guest room Harry's made his own, he ruffles through the clothes Ginny bought. Harry's shirt and work trousers are clean enough still, despite the two days of wear, but he's itching for a change. He pulls out a pair of well worn joggers and a grey vest, sparing a wistful glance at the pyjamas Draco lent him. There's no reason to wear them again, now that Harry has his own set with him. He dithers for a moment, slipping out of the trousers and into clean pants (heaven) and the joggers. At the last minute, he decides fuck it and tosses the vest aside. He pulls on the cream Henley top instead; if Draco comments, Harry will simply lie and say it was comfortable, not that the smell of Draco's clothes makes his cock thicken. No one needs to know about that.
Potter does flinch at those words. He recovers quickly, before Draco can probe further into it. "Fine. I want. Just." Potter sighs, runs his hands through his hair. He adjusts his glasses. "I saw you last night. You saw me." Potter spreads his hands as if the answer is obvious. Draco shrugs, deciding not to make it easy for him. If Potter wants something, he’s going to have to use his big boy words. "Don’t tell anyone you saw me. Please," Potter adds, after a moment, belatedly polite. Draco almost wants to laugh at the ridiculousness of it. He keeps his expression plain, instead.
It’s refreshing at least, to be certain about something and to have it resonate within him without any inkling of doubt. Maybe this is how it feels to believe in something rather than to simply saying he did because there was a snake hissing at hisheels. Draco doesn’t have much experience with the difference between choosing to do something, and being told to, but he thinks this might be the former. That’s one thing about this year that Draco thinks he feels okay about.
anything. Draco doesn't know how to fear this apparition. He won't until he has reason to. He refuses. Its presence, however, fills him with sadness.
Draco lets Potter sleep. He seems like he needs it, has barely moved at all in the hour or so Draco has been awake and reading at his desk. He's tried not to watch Potter sleep, of course; Potter's right, it would be creepy, no matter how besotted Draco may feel right now.
"Nothing!" Potter stands still, but his body is still radiating a restless and unhappy energy. He lifts his hands in a helpless gesture then lets them fall back to his sides.
Potter takes a moment before he speaks. "No one has ever been a living Horcrux before," he says, his face still tilted up now to look at the stars. "At least, no one who survived to talk about it. It’s done… it’s done something to me." Potter sucks on his lower lip. His eyes are bright. "It took us a while to notice, or to make the connection, really. The people around me, who I was close to, started having these dreams." Potter shakes his head as if bewildered. "Something in the room with them. Watching them. At first we thought it was the war, the aftermath. Ron and Hermione and Ginny lost people, everyone did. It made sense they would have nightmares." Potter shrugs. "But they kept happening. Scared the crap out of them when they realised they were all having the
“Smart lad.” Draco kneels onto the bed, still naked. “I’m sure you can deduce the second thing as well, then.” He rubs his eye, a habit of his when tired, and brushes his hair back away from his face.
Harry looks down at the text on the parchment. It glitters at him briefly before settling across the page in a line of dark, cursive letters.
"Thank you, Draco." Potter’s voice is heavy and tired, the words sleep-slurred. It takes Draco aback, the same way Potter saying he trusted Draco did. He’s not sure what the thank you is for, or exactly how Potter means it. It could be for trying to help him, for finding Darya, for listening to Potter’s story. It could be for as little as letting him sleep in his bed tonight. It doesn’t matter to Draco, really. Having Potter’s gratitude hits him hard, burrowing a home between his ribs. It’s another of those things, like having Potter’s touch, his friendship, his confidence, that Draco never imagined he would ever have freely given to him. It feels valuable beyond compare.
When the door clicks shut, he shuts his eyes, then picks up the pyjama top Draco left him and pulls it back over his face. Muffled, he groans into it as loudly as he dares, letting the excited frustration tumble over his lips. He has no idea what just happened, but it was something significant, Harry decides as he sits up, quickly pulling the buttons of his shirt through their holes and peeling it off. He slips on the cream-coloured henley top Draco left him, followed by the soft pyjama trousers, and flings the corner of the duvet back with more force than is necessary. He all but falls into the bed face first, catching himself on his elbows at the last minute to save himself from landing on his glasses. He pops those off and folds them carefully, then sets them on the bedside table. With a click, he flicks the lamp off and plunges the room into welcome darkness.
Harry had meant to make a comment on the fact that Draco’s guestrooms have cold floorboards while he himself is rolling around on thick pile carpets, but the thought wisps away from his mind as he watches Draco. Harry realises, with a clench of his belly, that this is the first time he’s seen Draco naked. He lets his eyes trail down over Draco’s chest, past the faint scars he’s seen before and along the trail of dark blond hair low on his belly that leads to the thatch of hair between his legs. His cock looks heavy, large even while soft. He’s slim, still, his body lean and wiry like Harry expected. Harry feels a dull throb of arousal as he looks him over. When he returns his eyes to Draco’s face, he’s watching Harry back, faint amusement in his eyes and his wand in his hand. Before Harry can speak, Draco casts a soft cleaning charm over them both. Harry feels his skin prickle up into goosebumps in its wake, the pleasant tingle of the charm scouring him clean, like his body’s been dipped in gentle toothpaste. Draco sets his wand down on the chestnut bedside table, beneath a lamp that matches the one in Harry’s room.
Draco, lost in thought as he gazes out over the dark marshland, starts slightly. “What, what do you want now, Potter?”
He doesn't want to taste anything more in his mouth than the salt from Potter's sweat-damp skin, than the lingering mint on his lips. Blood and fangs and dark appetites have no place in this room, Draco decides.
"Do you want to bite me?" Potter asks, and Draco's hips stutter. He recovers quickly, fucking down against Potter's stiff cock through the soft material of their night clothes. "You can, if you want."
“I thought it might have been,” adds Harry, feeling quite triumphant at guessing correctly― and then feeling an odd, distant throb of annoyance somewhere in the back of his mind. He’s not in a particularly bad mood, and at the same time, it’s there simmering around him. Not for the first time he wonders if Draco is managing to actually project his pissiness out into the atmosphere, but he doesn’t mention it. The last time he did that Draco tried to hex his knees together.
Well, a lot of things happen. He gets several haircuts, he gets spat at on the streets on the regular, and he grows an inch, to name just a few boring items on his 1999 agenda. The mundane, the everyday―it happens, and it happens and it happens again. It’s not the worst year of Draco’s life, because that’s still a toss up between the year Harry Potter refused to be his friend (wanker) and the year Harry Potter refused to let Draco die in a fire (
"Think about it," Draco says. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out an inky black pen, and looking around for something to write on. There’s nothing. Potter’s coaster is stark black, and therefore useless, and Draco didn’t bring his notepad. The pen is habit; the notepad is work. He chews his lower lip, pulling the cap of the pen off and exposing the silver nib. Impulsively, he gestures with two fingers towards Potter’s bare arm, then mimes writing with the pen. Potter is wearing a dark denim jack, a grey top underneath. The sleeves are rolled up to expose his forearms. He frowns at Draco, obstinately confused. After a moment, he extends one arm anyway with a slow reluctance.
“I’ll be sure to send a memo to the sun, as well as all other magical space detritus passing through our galaxy, on your behalf,” the Healer says with impressive sarcasm. It reminds Harry, powerfully and suddenly, of Snape. “Now, before I do that, shall we focus on the more pressing concerns of symptoms and duration?”
Potter's face creases in concern, and Draco wants to wave it off, to make a joke, but he forces himself not to. He wants this to land, what he's saying here. "My point is," Draco goes on, "that you might be dangerous. And I
, but never lets his eyes stray from the barman's. He resists the urge to bare his teeth, let his fangs distend. He wants to, though, wants to see this man flinch and back away. Draco's done it before and revelled in it. There have to be some perks to carrying weaponised biology now is his justification.
“A connection,” Harry repeats, barely a mumble. “How does…” he trails off, unsure of the words he needs to force the question in his mind out loud. He feels somewhat overwhelmed.
Ignoring Harry, Draco turns back to the Healer. “But shouldn’t we be issuing warnings to people when these sorts of celestial events occur, to prevent these from happening?” he asks. “Stop people from standing out in fields at least, pointing telescopes at these magical anomalies?”
I can be. And I do understand what you said last night, why you left your friends. I do," Draco repeats sincerely. "In turn, I ask that you make sure you've heard what I'm saying too."
At least she’s miserable somewhere warm, Draco thinks, mildly resentful. He shakes his head to cast the thought away, watching the stupid swing of his flop of hair. He forces a smile. He’ll laugh at himself these days, if there’s no one else here to.
“Hi.” Draco steps into the room, then backwards again as he closes the door behind him. He leans against it. “Are you just sitting here in the dark, Potter?” he queries softly.
Draco wrinkles his nose. "Yeah. I may have…panicked a bit." He sucks his lip into his mouth, worrying it with his teeth before releasing it again, shiny with spit. "Stupid of me. Sorry." He flicks Harry a glance, then moves his hand to Harry’s hip. There’s two layers of clothing between Harry’s skin and Draco’s hand, but Harry feels it like a brand. "Do you ever feel like you finally get something you want. Something you’ve wanted
Harry hums his acknowledgement, shifting up into a sitting position. Now that he’s fully awake, he feels a bit of a tit, lying on his back while Draco is fully seated. “Why’re you up?” Harry queries, rubbing his hand over the back of his head. “You’re not known for being an early riser.”
“Emotional and physical connection. No doubt as we’ve sat here you’ve been aware of the other’s mood, as it were. Perhaps without being sure of what it was, exactly, but it’s there. Now, should you intimate physical content, skin on skin, intimacy of any kind. The connection will most likely increase. Is this clear?”
There was a lot of coffee, and a lot of exasperated sighing from Aggie, and one slightly mad proposition from Harry about what he would like to do instead of the book he promised them but is definitely, definitely not writing. Or able to write. Or in any way remotely interested in writing.
Potter shakes his head. "Wrong, wrong, wrong. I’m nothing," he repeats. He folds his arms across his chest, defiant and casual. Draco knows he’s lying, he must be. He can’t tell what it is specifically he’s lying about, though. Draco hates not knowing.
an erection, yes, that was par for the course of penis ownership, but it wasn’t normal at all for him to be pulled into wakefulness because his dick was so hard he couldn’t hold onto his sleep. He grimaced, curling his toes and resting his hand on the curve of his belly. He looked down at it grumpily.
Draco had apologised right back, by saying it that it was only reasonable for Harry to be a little tetchy, considering there was a small person using Harry’s kidneys and bladder as alternating foot rests, and that he was currently at the mercy of magically simulated hormones Draco himself couldn't actually pronounce. And then he’d offered Harry a back massage. Harry could have cried with relief.
The sounds of the club two doors away feel like a surreal backdrop to the building pleasure in Draco’s gut. His breathing grows faster still as Potter shuffles forward, taking Draco down so deep that his nose almost brushes Draco’s pubic hair. His fingers claw at the open waist of Draco’s jeans, pulling on the tight denim. Draco fights to keep his own fingers loose in Potter’s hair, not to pull him down on his cock, not to pull at all. It’s bad form, for one thing, to choke someone on one’s cock. Terribly impolite. More than that, though, Draco finds nothing in this world more gratifying than withstanding his most base of desires, controlling exactly how much and when he will submit to them. He knows it comes from the part of him that is still terrified of the fangs that sprout from his mouth, from those moments when he stares at a bare throat or the blue veins revealed by the tilt of an elegant wrist. Even now, his mouth is watering in a way that goes beyond sexual desire―his gums ache, his jaw feels loose. There’s the stirring of
Draco nods, his lips pulled into a tight smile as he slips his fingers into the delicate bone china handle of his tea cup. “Absolutely fine, Potter.’ He sips his tea, sets the cup back in its saucer with a gentle rattle. “I look forward to her bringing you around your most appalling house clothes and ratty joggers.”
After a light, tension-filled supper, Harry excuses himself to have a breather upstairs. Draco hasn't made any more pointed remarks about things he can feel from Harry, and Harry hasn't felt anything in return―beyond Draco’s jealousy which he's quite certain Draco would not find being made aware of very sexy at all. Quite the opposite, Harry feels sure.
Harry chuckles, each stair feeling harder than the last as the events of the evening seem to suddenly weigh on him like a tonne of bricks. Quickly, before he can think better of it, he takes the chance to voice something that's been niggling at his mind. “Draco,” he starts, then licks his lips, choosing his words.
be doing, but he’s not so sure that’s the case now. At least, he doesn't feel so bad about it anymore. He feels oddly like that weight on his shoulders has, if not quite alleviated, at least lifted a little. He still has a horrid meeting tomorrow, but Aggie is pleasant and reasonable and it won’t be the end of the world. Probably. Hangover aside, Harry feels incredibly positive.
Draco’s stomach clenches, his hand stilling. His insides twist. He can’t think of a single thing to say. This is far from the longest conversation they’ve had since they started meeting here, but it’s the first time Draco’s been terrified by it.
“Harry, you’re not.” Draco lifted one leg until Harry was straddling him. “Ego? Enormous.” Draco slid down the bed as Harry braced one hand on the headboard. “Cock?” Draco licked along the base of Harry’s prick, and Harry suppressed a moan. “Largish, I’ll grant you that.” He grinned, hands on Harry’s thighs and urging him up to his knees. “Now, up.” He pushed Harry up towards his face and Harry went easily, both hands now gripping the headboard as Draco settled underneath him and between his legs.
Potter sniffs. "It means making the first six fucked him up so badly that by the time he tried to off me, his soul was…" Potter shrugs. "Unstable. Broken. Crumbling away. Fuck knows, really." Potter folds his arms across his chest, then looks down. "People aren’t supposed to make Horcruxes. Souls aren’t supposed to be split," he says to the ground. His voice sounds hollow.
Potter smiles at him ever so slightly, just the smallest lift of one corner of his mouth. It's such a tiny thing, a barely there movement of muscle, and yet it lifts his entire expression. He shrugs, the smile still glued gently to his lips and the corners of his eyes. They remain unerringly focussed on Draco's.
“So, how was the shower?” Draco queries a moment later, picking up his knife and watching Harry shrewdly.
“What, no.” Harry laughed again as Draco jostled him, running his hands to his elbows and gripping him gently. “I’ll squash you.”
, don’t think about that. Harry scrunched his face up, his cock hard and dripping, leaving a wet smear against his belly.
Draco sits still for a moment, weighing his next words. He stands, and then moves across the room to sit on the bed next to Potter. He wants to take Potter's hand, but he doesn't. He rests his palm against the duvet instead.
The answer was no, which Draco had felt the need to deliver via equally panicked lecture to Harry regarding the safety of the gestating child, adding that maybe Harry should take the offered time off work and, well, gestate somewhere a little less exciting. This in turn had made Harry roaringly angry, because he couldn’t just not do his job and it wasn’t like he did it on purpose, or like he was going to be dangling the baby over a vat of the stuff,
“Potion’s ready,” Draco supplies softly after Harry’s stared at the page for a while longer. Harry nods, letting go off the end of the scroll and letting it coil back into a roll.
Potter nods, Draco's words seeming to soothe him, insofar as he hears them. His body feels strung taut, hips punching up against Draco's with enough force to throw their rhythm off. Draco leans his weight on one elbow, gripping Potter's hips with one hand to hand him down. That does it for Potter. He gasps against Draco's mouth, thighs clenching around Draco as the hand gripping Draco's arse holds him against him. Between Potter's hand in his hair and on his arse, Draco feels held in place, hips now moving uncontrollably as he feels dampness spread across Potter's lap. Draco groans against Potter's lips as he follows suit, coming in heated pulses between them.
Harry nearly chokes on his toothbrush as he reads it. His mouth feels like something’s fermented in it, and he wants a new tongue, and he’s laughing so hard he almost gags. It’s far too early for Draco to be hilarious.
It's not nearly enough of an answer to be satisfying, but Potter hasn't shut down the line of inquiry either. Draco grabs at it with both hands, gobbling it down, and immediately wants more. He wants to ask,
Potter comes out of the small ensuite bathroom in a burst of warmth and dissipating steam. There’s a towel slung low on his waist, water droplets on his shoulders from his dripping hair. He’s tried to dry it, but it’s thick and still holding water. Draco considers not staring at his bare chest for a brief moment, then casts the thought away. He won’t ogle, he’s better than that, and besides. Potter’s had his cock down his throat; they’re past pretending they aren’t attracted to each other.
. It sounds accusatory, like Draco fucked up, when he really didn't. Harry just doesn't want to make it happen again by Gryffindoring into a situation, if it can be avoided. Especially if all it takes is getting his lower half under control.
Draco's gums ache, his teeth itching to descend. He's fed two days ago, more than enough to keep him flush and well. He doesn't need a single drop of blood from any person here, and he knows it. His
Harry spared a moment to feel ridiculous, sitting with his cock jutting out ahead of him, angry and red, from below the sweep of his stomach. It was hard to focus on that, though, when Draco lifted his face, sucking one of Harry’s balls into his mouth. Harry groaned, cock twitching as Draco did it again, his hands spread on Harry’s arse and moving him in time with his mouth.
When they leave the bar and find a somewhat secluded corner―at least as secluded as this club is capable of―Draco all but sags against the wall. He sips at the drink Potter procured him, eyes closed. It's some kind of sour beer, Draco thinks, a lambic or geuze. It's not what he would have ever ordered for himself, but the surprise and tang of it is a welcome shock to his system. He needs to get a grip, get himself back under control. A room full of warm bodies can’t affect him this much. He won’t allow it.
He allows himself one glance before he exits. Potter is exactly where Draco left him, still staring at the dark writing on his arm. His brow is furrowed, an almost haunted look on his face. He clenches and unclenches his fist, the movement tensing his arm and no doubt making the words appear to move. Draco forces himself to look away and reach for the handle of the door to open it and let the cool evening air caress him.
“For the most part, yes. Now, if you would like to make arrangements for where you will stay, we can get you there quickly and safely. It’s far too late and dangerous to have you Apparate, not after this kind of an evening. Duty of care, and all that, you know.” The Healer waves a hand if he’s swatting away midges.
"Oh god." Harry opens his mouth, trying to think of something else to say, but in the end he just abruptly stands up. "Biscuit?" he says, heading for the nearest cupboard. If they’re doing this, he needs something to shove in his face.
Not yet, anyway, Harry thought giddily as Draco undid the last button of Harry’s shirt, slipping it open and then dropping to his knees.
“Shut it.” Harry laughs softly. “Anyway, being an Auror’s not for me,” Harry jokes, taking a mouthful of his own tea. It’s still perfectly warm. “I hear it’s all loads of sitting around in bogs in the Fens watching a fat lot of nothing happen.”
It’s not that the message is incomprehensible, although parts of it certainly are. The bulk of it is pretty easy to make sense of. It’s not a declaration of love, but it’s bloody fucking close, Harry having apparently decided that midnight UK time, via Muggle technology and while swimming in pizza grease, was the perfect moment to let Draco know how much he fancied him, how he used to think he was an intolerable mean prick but now he thinks about how much he likes his hair and face and stupid posh voice, that he thinks Draco might like him too but he can never be sure but he’s trying not to be a mushroom anymore and do things he likes, and one of those things is Draco. Double entendre not really intended, but also he would like to do him.
Ginny wrinkles her nose, then nods. "Sort of. But also, not really. It’s the kind that’s worth it, I think." Ginny lifts up her arm then shakes her hand to make her bangles settle evenly down her wrist. "Like when I left the Harpies. I knew it was…well. It wasn’t what people expected of me, or what I was meant to be doing. But I hated it.
Draco snorts, and then properly laughs, shaking his head as he looks at Harry. “Well, it’s not just that. Earlier, I saw what I am quietly confident was,” Draco pauses for effect, leaning closer to Harry; Harry feels his face flush gently from the proximity, “a badger.”
"Add another," he murmurs. His voice sounds breathy and strange to his own ears. Draco is alternating between looking at Harry's face, and watching the way his finger slips inside Harry as he twists it. He shifts his weight from knee to knee, distracted by what he's doing and breathing hard at what he's feeling.
Harry breathes out harshly on a laugh. He swallows, every inch of him wanting to turn his face into Draco's cupped hand. "Never been great at rules," Harry croaks.
Draco moves his knuckles closer to Harry's hole. He extends one wet finger out, rubs it over the puckered flesh. "I'd like this to be good for you," Draco says after a moment, surprisingly earnest.
"What, hump against me in your kitchen?" Draco teases breathlessly, slipping his thigh back between Harry’s legs. There's just enough wet from Harry’s leaking cock to ease the way, slicking up Draco's leg and the crease of his hip. They rut against each other like the inexperienced teenagers they never really got to be, just enough of a rhythm to be satisfying, to leave them breathless and dizzy and get them off. Draco digs his fingers into the thick of Harry’s thigh, lifting his leg just enough to really grind down against him. Harry lets his head thunk back against the ledge of the open cupboard, Draco mouthing at the line of Harry’s throat.
“Wonderful, Harry,” Draco says quietly, turning his cup in his saucer. His breakfast sits abandoned in front of him as he looks into the milky brown liquid, his eyes smiling and teeth pulling at his lower lip. Anticipation settles heavily around them.
Potter nods, and then tucks his hands under his armpits. The rain is ruining his hair, making his clothes wet through. The drops glisten on the metal buttons of his jacket. His posture makes him look young, like the boy Draco used to know, and not at all like him at the same time. The boy Draco knew then never gave things willingly to Draco.
Harry sighs, comforted even though Draco’s hand doesn’t feel steady, even though Draco’s body is starting to slump. Harry feels the blood in his veins rush excitedly through him, his heart pumping faster. He should be afraid. The light in the sky grows brighter, and brighter, until all Harry can see is vague splotches of colour. He should be afraid, but he’s not.
!” Draco’s low drawl turned into a sharp intake of breath as Harry moved his hands to his arse, spreading him wide at the same as he lifted him and buried his face between Draco’s arse cheeks.
He’s not an idiot, is the thing. He’s a clever man, and was a clever boy before that. He can connect things quickly in his mind, make the necessary leaps of logic needed to be a good investigator. It’s why he excels at what he does. It’s how he found Darya when Potter couldn’t quite get there.
It’s clever, Draco thinks, the way that Potter has avoided outright requesting Draco get in bed with him and yet made it clear all the same. Draco can understand that well enough. He would probably go to the same lengths to avoid admitting he doesn’t want to sleep alone. Draco can respect this level of sneakiness and self-protection. Perhaps those rumours about Potter almost being sorted into Slytherin were true, after all.
Harry's smile grows so large he feels it pinch in his cheeks. “I like hearing that,” he confesses softly in reply.
He finds Draco in the kitchen at the wooden eating table, an ample breakfast set before him. He glances up when Harry walks in, and then away again quickly.
Draco looks away, then quickly back again. "Yes, I was. I came back prematurely. I thought perhaps we should…talk." He clears his throat again. "In person."
Annoyingly, that doesn’t seem to be how things actually work, so Harry's just resigned to wanking in the shower and probably dying alone. Oh well. He's been through worse.
For the briefest moment, their eyes meet. It's not for long, merely seconds even. Just a glance barely shared. It's too much for Draco. He knows Harry recognises him. Draco hasn't changed much. He's striking, if not pretty, and he always will be. He was striking well before vampiric blood ever touched his lips. He's sure he looks the same as the boy Harry loathed at school.
Harry's startled out of his reverie on the extent of Draco's adaptation to Muggle tradesperson skills by the next glittery message flitting onto the parchment.
“Oh, whatever,” Draco waved a hand, adjusting the pillow underneath him and getting comfortable. “I was conceived quickly, and easily ―”
Which is not to say he wasn’t; he felt bloody enormous, although that was mostly because he just wasn't used to carrying weight
Potter tilts his head to the side. "Then you know I'm dangerous. I could hurt you, without even knowing it. I know you think I won't, and it's fine, but I need to know you take this seriously."
Draco scrunches his face up, then runs his tongue along his teeth. Blunt, blunt, blunt. There’s nothing sharp and unnatural in there right now; they’ll only lengthen when he wants them to. He very much does not want that right now. He wants another gin, one that comes in a glass the size of a fishbowl that Draco can properly drown his sorrows in. Long teeth would only get in the way of the straw.
Harry spreads his legs wider, getting comfortable and shifting Draco against his own thigh, giving him something to grind down on. He feels Draco’s breath hitch, his teeth scraping over the line of Harry’s neck.
The first two events in Draco’s 1999 were already impressively disruptive on their own, but this third is a
"Okay. Look." Ginny tucks her hair behind both ears, chin-length bob swinging slightly. She holds her hands out palms up. The sunlight glints off her silver rings and bangles. "You know I love you, right?"
Wanker. Harry throws the ParchText onto the floor, then begrudgingly goes and does what he's told all the same
settles inside him. He busies himself with taking off his thick Auror coat and teal green scarf instead, until he’s just in his white shirt and black wool trousers. He dithers for a moment before hanging them over the back of the nearest chair, part of a set by one of the ornate windows. As expected, Draco tuts at him.
“You want to come in me,” Harry continued, determined to both get Draco off and see exactly how far he could take this whole new strain of dirty talk. Apparently he was into it. Harry was always a fan of riding new kinks out. “Getting me messy, knocking me up.”
"No no, it’s fine." Harry plonks himself down into the chair. "Don’t apologise. Err." He gestures at the table. "Sit down and have some of the tea. That you prepared."
." Harry shuts his eyes, then lets them flicker open again. He reminds himself to breathe as Draco suckles at the head of his cock. He presses his tongue against the slit, toys with Harry's foreskin, his forehead scrunching up as he groans. Looking down, he can see Draco press the heel of his palm against the firm shape of his cock through his pyjama bottoms. Harry's lips are tingling again, his mouth filling with saliva.
"We can take things slow, though." His voice is low and raspy, which hilariously contradicts his words. Draco seems to agree, judging by his gust of laughter.
Harry laughs again, quieter this time. He feels Draco lean back a little against his knee. “So we’re doing this, then?” Harry lets his smile turk cheeky. “Even if the sex is shit without the bond?”
"Wellllll." He pokes the papers to his left. "No? I mean, I’ve written nothing on The Four Sisters, but I did, um. Write a bit about a cat. Which, y’know. Wasn’t actually that bad."
"Hermione figured it out, that it was coming from me. She’s so brilliant." Potter’s voice is reverent, melancholy. Draco thinks the
"What can I get you, gents?" The man grunts, his accent startling in its familiarity. British, or perhaps South African.
“Merlin. Sorry,” Draco said softly, eyelids fluttering as he tried to blink himself properly awake. He sat up against the headboard, resting his head against Harry’s shoulder. “Can’t sleep?” he murmured. “You moody wanker,” he added playfully, testing the boundaries of how pissed off Harry actually was rather than trying to add to it. It had taken him a while, but Harry could tell the difference now.
He feels quite proud of that message, really, conveying annoyance on Draco's behalf and hopefully hiding that he was properly worried about him. Harry smiles, satisfied he’s covered his arse here.
kids love Harry, because Harry is great. With kids. He is not great with writing. Harry groans, the sound whooshing out of him in a constipated exhale. There is
He’s not been recognised once here, anyway. The infamy of the Malfoys and their role in the War hasn’t really extended outside of the UK, and fair enough. Draco wouldn't expect wizarding communities in the Czech Republic to have really given much of a toss about him or his family. They’ve had their own political nightmares to navigate, corrupt officials and those who were in Voldemort’s pockets. Lucius Malfoy is hardly unique in being a seedy political climber. Draco would have happily followed in his father’s footsteps if he hadn’t had a wakeup call in the form of… well, developing a moral compass. Small mercies.
There is a plus side to being the son of a Death Eater, and a newly turned Dark creature himself. He’s both seen and invisible at the same time. As a social pariah, he can get around quite well in the seedier parts of the wizarding world. The ones who do recognise him don't want anything to do with him, and the ones who don't know him just… don't give a shit. It suits Draco quite well.
Draco sets his teacup down with a sigh. "No, I went home first. Then to Astoria’s." He smiles slightly, levelling Harry with a look. "She wasn’t very happy to see me, but she never is. I wanted to see Scorpius. Have a cuddle. It was lovely." Draco’s smile turns wistful, then down at the corners of his mouth. "Of course, then he threw up in my mouth while I was yawning, so." Draco shrugs, and Harry barks a shocked laugh. "Gave him back to his mum for the rest of her allotted time," Draco goes on, watching Harry fondly. "I mean, I’m meant to be in another country anyway, so it was nice of her to let me have him for a day as is. Now I’m all stocked up on toddler time and thus, I came here." He takes a sip of his tea, and Harry takes a shaky breath and manages a smile back.
"You know what I was doing," Draco says after a moment. His voice is soft and low, his cheeks flushed pink. He's so pale, Harry thinks, that he never gets quite red when he blushes, just goes pink all over instead. Harry wants to press his thumbs against Draco's skin, watch the flush fade to white and then spring back again. "Don't you, Harry?" Draco leans closer, so close and yet not touching Harry at all.
Harry looks up from the strawberries, then shrugs. There’s an odd expression on Draco’s face, but Harry can’t quite put his finger on what it is, nor what the feeling he’s picking up from Draco is either. “Yes, no complaints.” A small smile creeps across Harry’s face. “You fishing for compliments on the plumbing, Draco?.”
He turns up just as Draco is finishing his second, nervous cigarette. Draco feels like he’s worn a dent in the brick wall he’s leaning against, he’s been there that long.
It's a strange and electrifying sensation, made sharper by the knowledge that Draco knows Harry can feel this. Harry doesn't know, can't know, what Draco is doing, but he can feel it, and he spreads his legs a little wider. His cock isn't hard, but it would take only a few strokes to get him there. His thighs feel tight with pent up tension, and he leans back on his hands, chest open. He shuts his eyes, head tilted back towards the ceiling, as soft waves of arousal pulse through him like sweet molasses through his veins. It's so much softer than turning himself on, pressing his own buttons and feeling himself react. It's a glorious echo of Draco's own body reacting. Harry shuts his eyes, heart racing like he's miles above a Quidditch Pitch, the Snitch in tantalising reach of his questing fingers. He shifts his weight onto one hand, presses the fingers of the other against his belly instead. The moment stretches paper thin as Harry wonders what to do from here.
"Either," he responds, the word hitting Draco in a rush. Potter looks Draco up and down. His gaze lingers, pointed in the way it travels from his thighs to his midriff, over the plane of his material-clad stomach and back over his chest, his neck, his lips. He feels it like it's a caress.
Potter licks his lips. He cups the hand holding his drink against his chest, still smiling that crooked and barely-there smile. "Dance with me first?"
“Fuck me. That was...” Draco trailed off, leaning his weight onto one arm and wiggling the other hand down between them. He began to stroke Harry’s aching cock. The touch was ― oh,
"Thank you," he murmurs against Potter's damp skin. "But I'm fine." He kisses Potter again, open mouthed and filthy, as he rolls his hips again.
The barman appears to be smirking at them. "Better hurry, love," the man mutters in his indecipherable accent. "Your boyfriend's in a rush, isn't he?"
Draco’s eyes flashed as he grinned, then pulled Harry towards him by the hem of his top. “Oh look at that, I’ve suddenly recovered.”
“You sleep naked,” Harry answers, stepping closer. He doesn’t usually, himself, but Draco hasn't offered him more night clothes, seeming to throw hospitality out the window the more tired he gets. Harry decides he’ll sleep naked tonight, too.
Draco shrugged again. “Something great.” He ran his hand over Harry’s stomach. Harry laughed again, his smile turning soft.
Draco shrugs, even though he feels far from casual. "Of course. I said I would help, and I did. I found Darya. I can find more. If you want me to, that is." He clears his throat, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees. "I can also fuck off and leave it alone."
Harry stops at the crook of Draco's elbow, letting his lips rest against the tender skin there. It's another private, vulnerable place that Draco is letting Harry see, letting him get to. He swirls his tongue lightly, gasps in the echoed sensation against his own elbow. He sits up, both hands holding Draco's arm now, keeping it close to his mouth. The movement brings his groin closer to Draco's bent knee.
Potter makes a broken sound. "Sorry, if that was―" He gasps, then tries again. "Um, insensitive, or―"
“Yes.” Draco wound his arms around his waist, rested his forehead against Harry. “And only one, thank heavens.” He kissed Harry gently, and Harry wasn’t sure if he was imagining the slightly wistful tone in Draco’s voice, or if he just wanted it to be there.
much." He strokes his fingers over Harry’s elbow, his hand warm through Harry’s thin shirt. "And then you messaged me." Draco inhales deeply, then laughs. "Well, you messaged some gibberish, Potter, I feel like I needed a Drunk-to-English translator. But I could get the jist of it." He licks his lips. Harry tracks the movement with his eyes, his stomach doing a somersault and his pulse starting to pick up the pace. "I had no idea. You’re so hard to read. I’ve been flirting with you for so, so fucking long." Draco laughs again, his knee bumping against Harry’s as he tucks his hair back behind his ear with his free hand. "I could never tell if you were aware and just politely not mentioning it, until you just went,
“Piss off,” Draco said affectionately, running one hand back to Harry’s arse and easing his underwear down. “You’re hardly impressive enough to squash me,” he rumbled, sucking Harry’s lower lip into his mouth. Harry groaned, ending on a soft laugh.
"Mm." Draco splays his hands across Harry's hips. Unexpectedly, he pulls Harry closer to the edge of the bed, until his arse is almost hanging off it. "Alright then." He plants a kiss on Harry's arse cheek, then moves to the other and does the same. Harry squirms, trying not to disrupt him but wanting to get closer all the same.
what this is. What it’s trying to get from people, and that it eventually will hurt someone." Potter swallows, visibly upset. "If I haven’t already. No one has been a Horcrux and survived before," Potter repeats. It’s the same sentence he uttered before. Potter sounds almost broken repeating it now.
Harry laughed ― and then almost tripped over Draco’s Quidditch boots ― as Draco steered him backwards towards their bedroom.
. He feels there may not be enough punctuation available to truly convey his disbelief at this development.
"Yes." Draco looks up at the night stars, at the shadowy spires of the towers visible over the treetops, that are so present in the city’s architecture. "It’s vile magic," Draco agrees.
“Not with me, you don't.” Draco bends to kiss the corner of Harry's mouth, the faintest press of his lips. Harry sighs into it, curling his hand around the back of Draco's head to bring him closer.
While Draco sips at his beer, Potter downs his, as well as the whiskey chaser he bought for himself. He disappears shortly after, heading back for another round which Draco politely declines. He nurses his drink, letting it cool his already cool hand and slowly bringing himself back down from the edge. It's not often he feels so strung out, so close to the creature within him running the show. He never lets it; he's the epitome of self-control, and that's not a simple brag. He knows what he is now, but he refuses to be ruled by it.
It really doesn’t, but Harry isn’t inclined to push it right now; it’s late, and everyone is already in a rotten mood. The three of them lapse into silence, the Healer content in his explanations and Draco and Harry mulling over their differing levels of nonplussed confusion.
Draco makes a cut off, startled sound that deepens out into a low groan as Harry shoots inside his mouth. He swallows as best he can, breathing harshly through his nose and with his eyes shut, his brow furrowed in concentration as he works his own cock over. Harry can feel it, the rush of Draco's pleasure crashing into the back of Harry's, making what feels like an endless wave. Harry presses the heels of his hands against his eyes as Draco lets Harry's cock slip from his lips. Draco chokes down a breath, nuzzling against the crease of Harry's thigh as he comes with a low, muffled sound. Harry's spent cock twitches, overstimulated and almost sore as he feels Draco's orgasm course through him. His head spins.
Draco hummed, fingers against Harry’s chin as he tilted Harry’s face towards him, kissing his neck, then his jaw.
Everything slips out of focus when Draco leans in to kiss him on the cheek. He pulls back and then does it again, pressing his mouth gently against Harry’s other cheek. His lips are so soft. Harry’s head swims.
In his quest to find something non-Potter to rest his gaze on, Draco makes eye-contact with the coiffed blonde across the bar. She smiles, mauve lips curling pleasantly and raises her drink in greeting. Draco is about to look away, until she pats the stool next to her, inclining her head in a clear invitation to come over. Draco smiles again, but tightly this time in polite rejection, and turns back to Potter.
"Don't be embarrassed." Draco smiles. "I'm not making fun. But you do realise, I could hurt you. I'm dangerous." He repeats Potter's own words, not to be facetious or a prick. "It's not hard for a vampire to take a life, or so I've been told. I didn't notice it happening to me," Draco admits.
Draco can’t explain why Potter saying that stings. It has no right to. Draco was never a friend, or close, or even bloody
? Draco struggles with that for another moment, as well as how arousing he finds it. It makes Potter no less saintly or heroic in his mind, rather renders him worryingly even more attractive.
Something flashes across Potter's face, another quirk of emotion Draco isn't sure how to read. He's stricken, suddenly, with the worry he's revealed too much―about himself, about his preferences. Potter's expression is once again impossible to read.
“Oh, no no.” The Healer chuckles. “No, that is in fact too far in the other direction, and brings us to symptom number two.”
“Oh.” Harry licked his lips, tilting his head to better let Draco kiss over the line of his neck. “Guess we’ll….need a bigger house, then?” Harry muttered, closing his eyes as Draco kissed over his neck. He felt goosebumps shiver over his skin as Draco laughed, his soft breath puffing over his collarbone.
By the time Potter has returned, Draco feels composed and more like himself once more. Potter stands next to Draco, their shoulders bumping as Potter leans heavily against the wall. He's holding another drink, whiskey again by the looks of it, over large blocky ice cubes. The lights of the club glisten over the amber liquid and the clear ice, infusing them with shifting colours. Potter's hand looks steady as he raises the glass to his lips, but there's a flush on his cheeks now and a glassiness to his eyes that implies his fast drinking is taking effect. His body seems more relaxed, even if his mind is still whirring.
Potter shakes his head, taking two steps back until he's standing against the brick wall of the alley. He rests against it, then lets his head fall back. He sighs, his face tilted towards the night sky.
Harry laughs, and the sound croaks out of him even as he tries to muffle it into his palm. They’re already on the thinnest of ice with their Healer, it seems, and they probably ought not to be goading him so much, but still. This situation feels stupid, this bond is stupid, and Harry has developed two rather bad habits recently: finding Draco funny, and giggling during serious discussions. The second habit is usually very closely related to the first, it seems.
On the other, more Muggle-facing hand, Draco is an odd job man who just happens to turn up on the doorsteps of increasingly frazzled Muggle occupants who can't understand why the pipes are clanking and the ceiling is bulging and Great Aunt Hetty's heirloom mirror just called them a twat.
"Oh, tsk, Potter, no need to be so dramatic," Draco chides, pulse quickening in excitement. He loves getting what he wants. "One always has a choice."
It’s a beautiful morning―or, it was. It is now a beautiful afternoon, and Harry has done fuck all, all day. Well, he’s texted Draco back and forth. Maybe his next novel could just be a series of texts, an examination of an enmity turned friendship turned let’s-annoy-each-other-constantly-over-wizarding-social-media. People might read that. Maybe? Harry would personally rather lick a Hippogriff, but you never know. There’s a market for everything.
When Potter pulls Draco on top of him, Draco is already closer to coming than he would expect. He settles between Potter's parted thighs, kissing him deeply before pulling away for a breath. He kisses down Potter's jaw, now smooth where before it was rough with stubble. Potter must have used a Shaving Charm when he showered. Draco kisses over his throat when Potter's arches his neck. He buries his face there, breathing in Potter's scent. There's no cologne left, just Draco's own shampoo and Potter's skin. It's intoxicating. Potter's hand is in Draco hair, keeping him where he is while the other grips at Draco's arse. Potter sets the rhythm, Draco circling his hips and thrusting down against Potter, guided by Potter's hand.
"It’s the worst. Actually, most of the stuff in here is either broken, or just shit," he explains happily. It's true; the cottage Harry’s renting came fully stocked, but with stuff Harry suspects the previous Muggle owners bought at a thrift shop for 30p, and only because they felt sorry for it. The other day he even found a fork in the drawer which only had two prongs. He and Draco had a good laugh about that when Harry told him.
“I don’t think they are, to be honest. After all, it’s only us here, and then Wilkins and Gunn on duty next. Hardly a substantial surveillance project. They’re just going through the motions.”
This year, all Draco wants is a good night’s sleep, a reprieve from the low ache of self loathing that’s settled deep in the pit of his gut ― and for Harry not to turn around, see him, and start a fight. It would have been warranted, but Draco had no fight left in him. He didn't want Harry to find that out, for some reason.
"Oh?" Harry stares up at the ceiling, one hand flat across his stomach, little finger almost brushing his own cock. "Conjured's fine with me, by the way." Harry swallows, then brings his other arm to rest up above his head. "Any lube is fine. Spit's fine. Go in dry, even, if you like."
Harry promised, midway through stuffing a pizza crust in his mouth, because he’s a great friend and also a hungry drunk. He suspects he and his friends have been wonderful for Abbotsbury's small takeaway restaurant business.
―as it does to him, but then again, Potter's kisses are hot, deep and real. His hands clutch at Draco's hips, bringing him closer, and Draco shamelessly sighs into it. He's past caring. It's too loud in here, anyway; no one can hear him, and if they did, Draco doesn't think they'd bat an eyelid. They hardly stand out here. There are a myriad of lustful couples scattering the dancefloor, the corners of the room. It's glorious. Draco loves blending in, being an anonymous part of a crowd. It's a novel feeling these days.
"You staying for dinner?" Harry asks through a spray of crumbs, as a peace offering for being lousy afternoon company, and also for that whole thing about not writing the book he promised her.
specifically, getting off in your head, is not that dire?” He shakes his head, still appalled with himself, and what Draco must think of him. He picks his tea up just for something to do with his hands.
, which was thrilling in its novelty. By that point Harry had figured it wasn’t a boozy, bumped-head fluke, or that Harry had a secret thing for getting off in risky places but that he actually just quite liked getting off with Draco. And then getting breakfast with him afterwards. He liked it less when they fought, which they managed to put off for the first year by pretending that neither of them had emotions beyond ‘kindly touch my dick, please’, and that Harry didn’t still have aching nightmares or that Draco wasn’t still terrified of naked flame. That had stopped working very well by Harry’s twenty-first, when Harry became aware that a) he had proper feelings for Draco, which might start with the letter L and rhyme with
Harry plucks distractedly at his lower lip with two fingers as he turns away, eyeing off the enormous shower. He strips off quickly, eager to wash the sleep fully away from himself. Once he's got the water to the right temperature, the warm stream of it sliding down his back, he indulges what else he's eager for and slips his hand around his mostly soft cock.
At first, Harry feels nothing, except the soft touch of Draco's fingertips against his skin. He wants to curl his face into the touch, but that's hardly surprising; he's wanted that for weeks. He isn't sure what he expected, perhaps a zap or a zing of something as soon as they touched, but he doesn't feel anything new―just the low rumble of excitement in his belly, the weighty hang of his cock between his legs, and now Draco's soft touch lingering over the stubble on his jaw.
Potter looks up sharply at Draco’s words. He scowls. It’s exactly as magnificent as Draco remembers, getting a rise out of Potter. He feels like he’s gaining a little of the upper hand back.
"What do you think―" Draco cuts himself off and swallows again. He pushes himself away from the wall, hips first, and starts to walk over to Harry. Harry can see the shape of his cock through the material of Draco's pyjama bottoms, the heft of it as it punches out the dark satin. Harry shifts a little, his own prick semi-hard and pressing against the soft fleece of his joggers. He doesn't try to hide that he's watching Draco walk. There's no point in hiding it now, and no need to. Harry feels giddy with that knowledge.
He spends as much time as he can outside the castle. It’s easy enough to sneak out,  and no one really pays him much mind anyway. None of his friends have returned this year; Pansy is in Italy with her family, and Goyle is still mourning Vincent’s death far too vividly to step foot back where it happened. Blaise was never going to return, and the other Slytherins want little to do with Draco, especially the first year’s. It’s a politically smart move ― Draco would have done the same, himself, back in the day. It’s terribly lonely, but it’s better than having to justify himself or try and explain anything he did during the war. Draco will take loaded silence over that, any day.
"I am." As conversations go, this one is amazingly circular. "So," Draco starts, coughing into his hand again. "I’m so shit at this bit," he mutters, almost to himself.
“Oh fuck.” Harry’s head dropped forward as he let go of the headboard, gripping his cock and fisting it loosely. He could feel his orgasm building, faster than he would have thought likely. He liked being eaten, feeling Draco’s mouth between his legs, and he loved how much Draco loved doing it. Usually, he needed a bit more ― fingers, Draco’s cock, something inside him. Tonight though, as he felt the puff of Draco's breath against his balls, as Draco sucked at him and spread his cheeks with his hands, tongue curling in deeper as Harry rode his face, Harry felt like every nerve ending in his body was centred on that one spot. He rocked his hips again, faster this time, felt the glorious burn of stubble against his skin as Draco pressed his face deeper.
“No you’re not,” Harry said, just to be contrary. He bit his lip, curled his fingers around each of Draco’s wrists. He hitched his legs up higher, thighs burning from the strain of it all and a delicious ache building inside him as Draco pumped his hips. “God, just keep fucking me, like that,” Harry ground out, “and like, ignore my dick.”
"My knick—are you fucking with me, here?" Draco hisses, then leans close once more. "Do you know that you are a missing person, Mr ‘
Draco frowns as he thinks. He feels wrongfooted and suddenly alert. The question was powerfully abrupt.
As expected, Draco finds the paper dry when he accepts it. Potter looks almost relieved to be handing it over, a tension draining out of his shoulders. His expression remains wary, however. Draco wants to open the folder, to devour all of its secrets, but he doesn't want to do it in front of Potter just now.
Draco turns to Harry, the impact of his annoyed glare somewhat softened by the bags under his eyes and the fact that his hair is still, frankly, a huge mess.
Potter makes another sound that Draco feels rumble over his lips rather than hears, before he's pulling Draco away to the side. Draco dizzily rubs the back of his hand over his mouth and once more lets himself be led. It's an exhilarating feeling.
“Oh hello, darling,” he coos, trying to shuffle Harry in the door and keep the dog from escaping. “Have you missed me, while I was out all night with this great lummox, getting shat on by comets?”
"What do you want, then?" Potter looks annoyed and wary, but under that, genuinely curious. Draco likes that expression on him.
"Honestly?" Draco lifts his head up, shaking his hair out of his eyes. His cheeks are flushed, his eyes bright. "Not usually. And definitely not in these tight trousers, they’re a fucking nightmare." He laughs. "But get these undone, and I’ll make an exception for you."
Potter takes them past Old Town, to a club Draco has avoided going to before. The line is surprisingly short, and the bouncer waves them through with friendly disinterest. It's starkly different to the place they've just visited, larger and more recently furnished. It's packed, the dirty thump of the music winding its way up Draco's soles and sinuously rattling his bones. The press of people around them is immediate, shirtless men and bright-eyed youths, high-heeled queens and steel-capped kings holding court on the dancefloor and amidst the throngs of glistening drinkers at the bars.
He sat right next to Harry on the dirt, his back against the clear glass greenhouse walls, sat next to him as if they hadn’t spent years hating each other, bickering and yanking on metaphorical pigtails and spitting hexes. As if Harry hadn’t pulled Draco out of the Fiendfyre and as if Draco hadn’t known exactly who Harry was at the Manor. He sat next to him as if that was something he was allowed to do, and something Harry might want, even though he looked wretched and bleary-eyed and Draco hadn’t slept the night through in weeks. He sat next to Harry, shoulder to shoulder and pulled his cloak around himself, until Harry eventually shuffled closer to steal Draco’s warmth and Draco dropped the edge of his cloak over Potter, too.
It’s beautiful, a rush of light speeding across the black expanse. Harry’s got vague memories of seeing a shooting star when he was younger, when the Dursley’s deigned to take him on a camping trip with them. It was nothing like this; that shooting star was a brief flash, and then gone. This one seems to move slower, even though Harry reasons it must be moving at speeds he cannot comprehend. It has a huge, white tail, and it burns with the fiercest white light.
“I assume that's what you were doing,” Draco goes on, setting his amply buttered and mildly bitten toast down. He watches Harry closely, and Harry stares back like a fox caught in Lumos light. “I'm quite sure that would account for what I...felt.” Draco licks his lips, the apples of his cheeks still tinging the same faint pink Harry had seen on him earlier.
Harry scratched his cheek, aware he was babbling in a way he hadn’t around Draco in a long time; they were practically married for god’s sake, why was Harry coming over all shy now? They’d established they were both okay with being the carrier for the child they wanted to try and have, but the problem was they still hadn’t been able to make an actual decision regarding who would actually do it.
He composes a text instead, more words filling up the little screen right under his own already sent messages. It just says,
Draco shakes his head. “Leave it.” Draco pushes himself upright, then leans his weight fully onto Harry’s thighs as he stands. He’s right; his pyjama bottoms are a mess of lube and drying come, a damp patch at Draco’s groin where he came. He holds his hands out for Harry to take them. “Let’s just move beds, deal with this in the morning.” He pulls Harry upright against him. “And Nettle won’t sleep without me in there with her,” he adds, almost shyly.
"Merlin," Draco mutters, not bothering to hide his disdain as he scans the room. The decor is old, and not in a vintage way. It's decrepit. There's a cloying smell of old alcohol spilled on infrequently cleaned floors and musky fabrics, of decay and too-sweet incense burnt to try and cover it up. It smells like a badly kept funeral parlour. Draco half expects to see bouquets of dying roses hanging on the walls. The music is too loud, rattling the aged speakers as they do their best to blast the cacophonic sounds over a crowd of listless dancers. At the edge of the crowd, Draco thinks he senses a fellow vampire, but the barrage of sensory information is dulling his ability to tell. There's too much to take in here, in this fetid and too-hot room. Draco can't tell who is human and who is creature, who might be deadly predator and who is just here to drink and be prey.
“Poor her,” Draco agrees. His expression doesn’t change, but Harry feels Draco’s jealousy ebbing away. He’s not sure if that’s from Harry’s attempt at glossing over it, reminding Draco they are exes, or if Draco simply got a handle on himself. Either way, Harry does feel oddly pleased to know that it got to Draco, even though he feels unkind for that.
So, avoiding the light of day is essential. Sleeping during this time is not―and sleeping in a coffin is absolutely not required, unless Draco is inclined to be particularly dramatic. He finds dozing during the day calming though—it soothes something in him. Something
He’s been in Prague for just shy of two months now on his most recent case. He’s not ashamed to say that the first thing he did when he arrived was to find out the best places for those of his kind. It always pays to know the safe spots, beyond just where the general wizarding community can be found. The banks, the bars, the places it’s safe to be openly into other men, the places it’s safe to be openly inhuman. Draco’s hardly vulnerable, but he’s aware that he could be. Should someone follow him home, should there be threats upon the small Blood Suppositories set up across Europe to keep his kind in fresh donated blood without endangering anyone. At least that's what they're supposed to do; any vampire worth their salt will admit it does nothing to stop the craving for a fresh vein. That's why people hate creatures like him so much. It's only natural.
"I want an explanation," he responds. As Potter’s expression turns confused, Draco goes on. "You’re not going to give me a straight answer about why you’re here, fine, but I want
He hasn’t broached the subject with Potter. It’s possible he’ll have no idea what Draco is talking about, or he’ll feign ignorance, or he’ll disappear in the night at the first word of it. Draco doesn’t know enough yet to be able to make an informed decision, to take suitable action, and that’s what he deals in these days.
“I assure you it is not shit, horse or otherwise,” The Healer counters, somewhat stiffly. “We are all made of stardust, Mr Malfoy. The iron in your blood was forged in dying stars. Don’t imagine the magic that runs through you doesn't respond to that which runs through the most distant galaxies.”
“That tossing off would count as a heightened emotion?” Draco runs a hand through his hair, pushes it away from his forehead. It’s neatly brushed. Harry’s blushing so much he feels his eyeballs must be boiling in his head. “I wouldn’t have thought so either, but apparently you were having a rather good time.”
"Shit, yes, like that." Harry can barely breathe around how good it feels when Draco holds his fingers in place again, curling them up to massage his prostate once more. Heat pools at the base of Harry's spine and between his hips as Draco moves his fingers back and forth in small increments, bumping up against the bundle of nerves inside Harry again and again. Harry struggles to stay still, his mind growing fuzzy at the edge. All of his attention is focussed on the growing heat between his hips, the feels of Draco's fingers around his cock and inside him as Draco works him over.
Harry shivers at the feeling of Draco’s magic, so familiar in this new terrain, as Draco gently sends Harry's glasses sailing towards the bedside table. They land silently beside the lamp. Draco steps closer between Harry's parted legs.
“Merlin, you feel so good,” Draco mumbled, sucking at the skin of Harry’s throat. Harry bit his lip, stomach muscles taut and shoulders tense with the effort it took not to touch himself, but he was
Potter sits back in his chair, both arms folded across his chest defensively. He says nothing for what builds into a long and uncomfortable minute. Draco refuses to look away. He wants this.
The therapist he went to called it a lot of different things, but Harry still thinks it boils down to that in the end; he just wasn’t sure how to be still, or okay, or not expect a stab of pain in his forehead and peril at his door.
Incubus. Succubus. Night Mare. It doesn’t fit Draco’s understanding of any of these creatures. It’s drawn to him, but he doesn’t know why. It hasn't hurt him, but perhaps it just hasn’t found a way to yet. Draco can’t move in these dreams, but he isn’t sure if that’s the shadowy figure’s doing, or if it's the limits of his own mind. He’s lucid, aware of what’s happening, and perhaps this is where the being can exist, can find him―in that space between dreaming and awake, when things are strangest and reality feels paper thin.
Harry laughs, loud and weird, and oddly relieved at the conversation not going any deeper. He also, strangely, blushes about the wet shirt thing. Draco’s such a dick. Harry kind of likes it, now Draco’s stopped being such an incredibly
Draco stares down at him, chest heaving. His mind feels vaguely blank again, the euphoria of getting too much of a good thing, too much of what he wants, making his thoughts slow and syrupy. "Yeah," he croaks in response, threading the fingers of one hand through Potter's endlessly tangled hair. It's so much softer than he expected, than he thought it would be. And he
When Potter kisses him, it isn't surprising, but it is electrifying. Potter’s mouth is soft, gentle presses of his lips against Draco’s. It’s been so long since Draco’s kissed someone. It’s dizzying, intoxicating. Draco winds his fingers into the soft curls at the nape of Potter’s neck, feels the sweat-dampened tangle of them. He almost isn’t sure how to react, how to lead this dance. He isn't sure he has to, though. He thinks he can let go here, let Potter run the show. Potter's skin is still feverishly hot, a mania lying just under the surface. Draco wonders for one mad moment if Potter is thinking the same thing that Draco had earlier—that this could very likely be the last night they see each other. Draco wonders if he's kidding himself that this could mean as much to Potter—
"I’m so bad at this bit," Draco repeats, breath gusting against Harry’s face. "The talking bit. Feelings." Draco makes a face, pulling back a little to give Harry space. Harry feels himself tilting forwards, almost chasing the contact. He sways back. He must look like an idiot. He has no idea what his face is doing. His brain has entirely clocked out. "But I like you so much," Draco goes on. "
soul in order to reside there with it. And that space is now vacant. It’s searching for something… to fill it, the hollow there. It’s fractured." Potter swallows thickly, blinking rapidly as his eyes become bright. "Like his was," he croaks. He sniffs, and wipes at his cheek. "But it’s not like with him. I don’t know what it wants, what it’s looking for from people. I don’t why I’m doing it," Potter says, deeply distressed. "And I’ve read so much. So many cultures have creatures like this, myths about―" Potter looks at Draco his voice sounds rough, and thick. "About beings that feed on souls," he says. Potter’s voice has grown so soft, a barely there croak. I’m terrified. I’m terrified that
“Seem so, yeah.” He hands the scroll back to Draco. “Right, well.” Harry suddenly isn’t sure what to do with his hands. He feels abruptly aware of his nakedness, that he’s starkers in Draco’s bed. The events of the past night come rushing at him. “Guess we’d better head in,” he adds after a moment longer in which Draco simply stares at him. Harry swallows, and tries to relax around the tension he can feel building in his shoulders.
Harry takes a breath, and then another. He nods, never breaking eye contact with Draco. “Sure,” he murmurs, his voice barely above a whisper. “Of course,” he says again, more assuredly. His heart is trying to beat its way out of his chest, his stomach turning giddy circles.
The lights come right back on again, of course, leaving Draco dizzy and confused, and with a coppery tang in his mouth, and suddenly things slot into place. The man kissing his neck, a sharp pain in his throat, a dizzying high that turned into just being dizzy, and alarm bells fading out as Draco faded out with them. The whopping great big
“Err.” Harry can feel himself flushing at the suggestion of physical intimacy. He wonders, suddenly, if this means Draco can feel that Harry is feeling embarrassed, or worse that he’s interested, and chances a glace in his direction. Draco looks similarly stricken, flushed a lobster blush, but for all Harry knows that’s all his own embarrassment, Merlin, he’s confused already.
The door creaks gently, the faintest sound, as Draco pads into the room on bare feet. He’s shirtless; Harry can see him well enough by the light of his bedside lamp, casting them both into long shadows across the polished floors. Harry doesn’t move from his position at the end of his bed, leaning back on one hand and legs spread wide. Curiously, he doesn’t feel any embarrassment at Draco seeing him like this. If anything, he’d spread his legs wider if he could.
And deep down, Draco knows there is something that borders on romantic in it too, at least for Draco. It’s the lack of filter; he can’t lie to himself about it anymore. He likes coming here because it’s his spot, and he likes coming here at night because he wants to see Harry, and be near him. Draco arranges his cloak around his lap, and then half over Harry’s knee as well. It’s all part of the routine now, the sharing of space and warmth. They’ve talked so little and yet fallen completely in sync here. Draco thinks there’s definitely a romance to that, whether Harry feels it too or not, even if they never acknowledge it. Draco will have this.
Draco doesn’t look entirely convinced, but he nods, a smile lingering on his lips. Harry wants to kiss him again, so he does, soft at first and then slipping into something deeper. His fingers press at the nape of Draco’s neck, keeping him close, as Draco slips one of his own hands up the back of Harry’s shirt. Harry stifles a moan, shuffling closer until his chest is pressed against Draco’s, the heat from his body slipping over onto Harry’s. Harry angles his groin away, his cock chubbing up in his pants, not quite enough to be obvious but getting there. He means to keep his kisses light, and sweet, but he’s waited so long and his self-control has never been amazing. He wants to eat Draco whole, right now. But still, he makes himself stop.
"You better not be a person." He sets his tea down, turning to face the cat fully and stare it down. "That would be really weird and uncool and awkward," he elaborates, aiming for a tone of Disappointed, Not Angry, and realising distantly that he’s actually having a conversation with a cat in a breadbin and doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on regarding what things count as ‘weird’. Still. He is kind of waiting for a reply.
“No touching,” he whispers as Harry moves to go in, almost brushing past him. Harry rolls his eyes, trying and failing to suppress the goosebumps that prickle over his neck where Draco’s breath ghosted for just a moment. Harry makes an exaggerated show of ducking to avoid any contact with Draco as Draco slides his hand up the door and over Harry’s head.
“Fuck,” he mumbled, feeling giddy and stupid and revoltingly happy, and not a small bit terrified too. “It worked.” He turned slightly stunned eyes to Draco, who was looking a little bit stunned himself as he casually held his own ― dull red ― paper slip.
If he cuts himself, he’ll be healed by the next day without so much as a mark to show where the injury had been. If he’s scorched by the sun, though, he’s not sure it will ever truly heal. Three years later, and he still has a scar on his palm from the burn.
He sort of…knows it’s the second one, really. First of all, Draco really is exceptionally fit, Harry doesn’t need to exaggerate that in his head. And secondly, Harry might be great at avoiding dealing with unpleasant things, but he’s at least okay at admitting they’re happening. He just…puts off addressing them. Ergo, he’s quite aware at this point that his feelings for Draco are more than friendly, that a lot of them originate from below his waist and between his legs (because Harry is a hotblooded perv and Draco is hot), and that worryingly even more of these feelings originate…from that private little place in his chest. It’s not love, but it’s a fondness that borders on unbearable at times, makes his face heat and his skin prickle and his mind go a bit white when he thinks too hard about it. And as with all things of this nature, it’s not going away on it’s own, instead getting a little bit stronger with every flirty message Draco sends and every stupid, giddy smile that message subsequently brings to Harry’s face. It’s going to bite Harry in the arse eventually, or he’s going to have to be up front about how he feels, but for now he’s living in limbo and it will have to do. He’ll pretend to write his book. He’ll pretend to be just friends with Draco. He’ll deal with the fallout when it’s happening;
―if he’s just feeling his own curiosity and interest here, or if this is something that’s echoing back at him from Draco. Harry’s wondered before if Draco’s interested in him, in touches that linger just slightly too long, in looks that seem like Draco has words that want to follow them. When they drink too much together and walk home to one or the other’s house, the backs of their hands brushing as they amble along, with far too often a frequency to be anything other than deliberate. Harry can read Draco these days, he thinks, better than he used to, but he can’t read this. It could be wishful thinking, his own longing turning into a skewed interpretation of what is merely affectionate friendly on Draco’s part. The problem, Harry thinks, is that he doesn't know how to read himself when it comes Draco, and what he feels about him. Times like now, when Draco steps close enough to touch and with those grey eyes boring through him, Harry feels like Draco is giving him all the information he needs, but Harry just doesn’t know how to process it.
Draco shakes his head, still trying to digest this information. "I doubt my father did, either," he says honestly. His opinion of his father is presently lower than dirt, and he’s certain the diary was deliberately given to the Weaselette, but still. Draco doesn’t think his father knew about what it really was.
Draco presses his lips together, then runs his tongue over then. "No." Draco's smile returns. "Nor I," he whispers, bringing his fingers to Harry's cheek.
Harry wakes up with a hangover, his face smooshed into his pillow and still in the same shirt he wore last night. Martha the cat is sleeping in prawn-pose on the chair by the bed, which seems to exist solely to house Harry’s discarded clothes, and he’s proud that he and Ginny didn’t get too drunk at the pub to forget to bring her home. He thinks most of the damage actually occurred after she walked him to his house, the pair of them tipsy but not legless, and then decided to raid the sloe gin stash Harry’s kind neighbour gave him as a housewarming gift. Ginny left around 1am, picked up for a Side-Along by her housemate Gloria (safety first, there’ll be no drunken Flooing or Splinching on Harry’s watch, thank you), after forcing Harry to promise to take Wednesday off―properly off, with relaxing and genuine consideration of his future and wellbeing―and have a bit of a break from feeling rubbish about his book.
. Beside him, Harry can see Draco has started rubbing at his temples. Oddly, he feels as if it's soothing his own wretched headache, too.
It took ages for them to get on good terms, and rightly so. Harry wasn’t going to become chummy with the likes of Draco Malfoy just because his then-wife Astoria was best friends with Harry’s agent and Agatha kept dragging Harry to parties and events that Draco and Astoria were at. That was not on Harry’s career agenda, making friends with Draco; Harry decided this the first time he saw Draco, Astoria and baby Scorpius at an event. Draco was just as pointy and snooty looking now as he had been in first year, and he could get stuffed. Harry wasn’t even going to be arsed saying hello to him, or to Astoria, or to his frankly fucking adorable son, Jesus what a cute baby. But nevermind all that, Harry was not interested in being polite, regardless of chubby-cheeked newborns.
He thinks about waiting a bit to send his reply, so that it won’t be painfully obvious he was sitting there waiting for the message, but in the end he figures, fuck it. He thumbs the send button.
His words are polite, and his tone measured, but Harry becomes aware of a stirring in his stomach, at the base of his spine. It’s familiar, and it takes him a moment, as he distractedly stirs his tea, to identify it as jealousy. It squirms strangely inside him, and he frowns in confusion before he realises, it’s not his. The stab of jealous discomfort at the mention of Harry’s ex is coming from Draco.
"Oh, Aggie." Harry tries to frown at her disapprovingly, but feels his lips tick up into a smile at the same time. "It’s like you don’t even
“I hardly anticipate that, based on last night.” Draco twists his mouth, as if deciding what to say next. “And based on the fact that I'd still fancy you even if you had no idea what you were doing in bed,” he confesses.
Draco fights not to roll his eyes. "It’s just a pen, Potter, for pity’s sake, not a serpent." He grabs Potter's arm before either of them can think better of it. He’s got to write his bloody address on
Draco’s father has never hit him before, never raised his voice. Lucius has been subdued since the war ended, since his side lost and crumbled. Draco had never entertained the idea that there would be a closeness between them after the war, but he never anticipated the seething resentment his father apparently festered towards Draco, either. Draco’s no saint, but his father has done much worse. This is simple fact, and one that must have been eating a hole in Draco’s father’s heart for some time considering the strength with which his fist hit the wall beside Draco’s head.
"Unlikely." Draco sits up a little straighter, an idea forming in his head. It’s wonderful, and terrible, and he can already feel he’s going to act on it. He hasn’t been this excited by something in months. Years. "Not for someone like me."
It’s long been an observation of Harry’s that Draco is stunningly good looking, a fact he’s made peace with knowing and tucked away inside his chest with the other things he’s not sure how to make productive use of. It still blows him away, though, that Draco can look so attractive while his hair is sticking up like a messy patch of straw and there’s craggy creases in his cheeks from the pillow.
“You can stay.” Harry sniffed, wiped the back of his hand across his face. It left a smear of dirt on his cheek. “I know you come out here sometimes. I don’t mind if you stay, but if you take the piss out of me for this,” he gestured at his face, at the tear streaks on it, then dropped his hand back into his lap, “I’ll hex you unconscious.” The dull Lumos light from his wand cast strange shadows on his face, eerie shadows forming under his cheekbones. He still hadn’t looked at Draco.
Draco stubs the cigarette out on the windowsill then quickly wipes the moisture from his face. He heads down the narrow stairs to the door.
Draco suppresses a groan at that, the rhythm of his hips stuttering. He opens his mouth against Potter's throat, presses his tongue against the gentle yet vital pulse point there.
"A lot of places," Potter replies. His breath ghosts along the side of Draco's neck again, over the soft skin behind his ear.
“Always did think the hair was a dye job,” Harry agrees, then laughs and leans away as Draco reaches over to thump him on the shoulder. “Ow, ow, okay, the hair is natural, I take it back.” Harry keeps grinning as he rubs at his arm with his free hand. Defeated, he slides off the log and onto the ground below. It’s damp, not quite muddy but definitely not dry. It’s almost soothing after the horrid texture of Harry’s previous seat.
Harry raises his eyebrows, huffing in faux indignance. “Oh, it’s me who’ll be shit at sex, will it?”
, he needs to respond to her or she’ll come kick his door down. He badly wants to put it off forever. He can’t imagine what could be so bad to Draco about being in Australia right now; Harry would much rather be in another country, he muses, than sat here pissing his day away for the umpteenth day in a row.
Harry’s breath catches in his throat. “Oh.” He licks his lips, teacup raised half way to his mouth. “I. Um.” His eyes flit over Draco’s face, lingering at the cupid’s bow of his lips and the tilt of his smile, the narrowed interest in his eyes. His mind is racing, his pulse a rabbit flutter. “Let me know if it...happens again,” he says, before he’s even really made sense of what’s going on here. He just knows he needs to say something, to poke at this and see what happens. He feels like he’s unravelling a tapestry, pulling at a thread he’s been trying to get at for months and finally watching it come loose in a glorious shower of colour.
When he does sleep, he doesn’t dream. He can’t recall the last time, in fact. That alone would make this dream memorable, even if all that happened in it was him eating a liquorice wand or something equally ordinary. What he does dream, though, is far from mundane.
Harry sits alone, at the nice table in the nice enough pub, and tries to take Ginny's words in. There's wisdom in there, and an answer to his predicament too. He thinks of all those hours, days, spent sitting at his typewriter and being able to produce nothing, listening to the radio and quietly panicking. His novel sits abandoned, a mess of expectations, the joy long gone from creating it. The only thing he's enjoyed working on is his silly little cat tales, and he knows this, knew it days ago. It's refreshing, and nice, to write nonsense and just for fun, a bright spot in his days―along with talking to Malfoy. He thinks of Draco's messages, on parchment and on screen, of his long fingers making drunken paper cranes and the fall of his hair across his cheek. Those three kisses, and how much they mean something. How much Harry
because it sounds like begging, and it is. It’s pathetic. Worst of all, there’s a real possibility that friendship isn’t in the cards anymore, and if that’s the case, Harry doesn’t want to know. Not right now, anyway.
When he steps out of the Floo of his own rented flat, he finally draws in a shaking breath. It catches in his lungs like he's breathing in fire.
“Mmm.” Harry pressed his thumbs next to his lips, running one around Draco’s rim, before licking a long wet stripe from Draco’s perineum to his balls. He sucked one into his mouth, tasted the salt of Draco’s sweat, the bitter tang of his come, then moved lower once more. He opened his mouth, pressing his tongue inside, listening for the telltale hitch of Draco’s breath. If there was ever a better way to get Draco to stop talking ― stop talking coherently, at least ― Harry had yet to find it. He pushed his tongue deeper, fingers tense against Draco’s arse cheeks as Draco rocked his hips, fucking back against his face. Harry inhaled sharply, moaning as his cock ground against the bed sheets before he pulled back.
He’s dressed to impress. Draco is aware that if tonight is successful, if Potter receives the information or whatever it is he’s so ardently seeking from this necromancer, then this very well might be the last time he and Potter meet. They’ll have no reason to, once Potter has what he wants, or needs, or whatever he’s being cryptic about. If that be the case, Draco wants to leave him with the best lasting impression he can.
No, Potter is not here because he’s a vampire. So he must be something else, Draco reasons. Or he’s a hunter and he’s here to off them all. There are people like that around, who hate the so-called darker creatures of the world, want to see them all burn. If Potter is here for that, though, then he’s done an astounding job by even getting in the door. Even finding out where The Opal is, for that matter, let alone gaining enough trust to sit there calmly enjoying a pint.
He potters around his kitchen for most of the morning, making toast and tea and digging around for Paracetamol. He has a Floo call with Hermione, long overdue, and makes plans to properly catch up with them the week after next. He Floos Teddy and Andromeda too, and gets a genuinely riveting update on Teddy’s pet Tortoise and the gnomes in their garden. Impulsively, he owls Dean a copy of his cat story, which Dean’s been asking to see and which Harry has been feeling uncharacteristically shy about doing. Today, he figures fuck it. Harry’s written silly things before which Dean has attached charming doodle-drawings to, and Harry would be genuinely thrilled if he did that here, too. The only thing stopping him has been the deep weighted feeling of this story being nothing but procrastination from what he really
Harry scowls. Malfoy has a point, actually, not that Harry’s thrilled that Draco is currently ensconced in a big creepy death mansion full of lizards.
He knows it’s his fuck up. He shouldn't have gotten carried away and sent Draco such a word vomit of feelings and gibberish. For all that his life has felt like it’s covered way more than the average adult wizard’s has, he knows he’s got fuck all experience when it comes to relationships and being emotionally healthy in any way when it comes to his feelings. Knowing this doesn’t help the fact that he’s just tanked one of the most unexpectedly important friendships in his life, in spectacularly awkward fashion.
Draco’s hair caught on the mattress as he laughed. “You know, we don’t need to do this,” he said archly, letting Harry lift his legs around his waist. Harry looked at him quizzically through his messy fringe.
One week later, and Miss Eventide’s party was awful. Harry nearly fell asleep twice, he ate too many creamy dips and crudites and felt sick, and Draco drank a bottle of champagne and got the giggles in the middle of Evelyn’s speech.
Harry groans into his elbow, half a laugh and the rest sheer embarrassment, and then sits upright once more. He straightens his glasses, then brushes his hands down his shirt. He slumps in his chair. “Merlin. Can I apologise enough for this? I am fucking...
Draco motions towards the kitchen with his head, then raises one eyebrow to punctuate the question. “Cup of tea, then?” he asks, and then as if reading Harry’s mood, adds, “or straight to bed? You look frightful, if I can be honest.” He smirks. “Shall I set you up in the guest room?”
"Where are my manners, will you take a seat?" Draco offers, gesturing at the kitchen table. The chair nearest Harry wooshes backwards in a soft gust of Draco’s magic. "I made us tea."
Draco chuckles. "Well, I’m not sure Penne really goes that well with tea." He stays standing close, hedging Harry in against the counter and the open cupboard door. He smells lovely. This close up, Harry can breathe in a deep lungful―woodsy cologne and green apple shampoo―and can see the spots on Draco’s cheekbones and tip of his nose where he’s caught a bit of sun.
He sends copies to all of his friends. He sends flowers and an edible arrangement to Aggie. He throws his typewriter in the bin.
Potter breathes out on a laugh. "I don't want you to fuck off." He's smiling still. Draco likes the sight of it so much. Potter sighs. "You did listen to me last night, didn't you." He's not asking. His voice sounds resigned, but Draco hears that he's seeking confirmation all the same.
"Oi!" Harry frowns, pouring himself some more Mimosa out of the jug they’ve ordered to ‘share’ and which Harry is essentially finishing off himself. "Hedwig was a majestic name for an amazing bird, and you called an owl Pigwidgeon, so I think you’ll find, shut up." Harry salutes her with his champagne flute, then pokes out his tongue.
in the morning. Draco likes to say it was the shock of seeing Harry sat on his sofa, but they both know it was the third bottle of bubbles. Besides, Harry had to stay over. He couldn't expect the babysitter to stay the night, and Harry was more than happy to entertain Scorpius in the morning. Truth be told, Draco probably threw up because he felt so guilty about getting sloshed when he had Scorpius to look after. Harry wasn’t going to judge him; he didn’t know the first thing when it came to parenting. Scorpius always looked happy when Harry saw him, so Draco must be doing it right.
It’s in a part of the city that Draco has had scant reason to visit. There’s something unpleasant about it, to him at least. He suspects there is another vampire in the area. There’s a lingering bad taste in his mouth as Draco waits near an alleyway. One that has nothing to do with the cigarette he’s distractedly smoking.
Harry stares into his tea, some of the badly strained leaves lazily floating to the surface before he prods them back down with the back of his spoon. It reminds him vaguely of Divination, of Ron’s made-up predictions and Hermione's exasperation and Trelawney’s sickly, cloying perfume. Harry wonders what these tea leaves might have in store for him today, were he able to actually read them.
“Bottoms up,” he said softly, chinking his vial against Harry’s. Harry huffed a laugh, pulling the cork stopper on his and trying to get a grip on the butterflies in his stomach as he lifted the vial to his lips.
Despite all this precedent, though, the year that Draco turns nineteen there are three things which really stand out as vying for first prize in the ‘Shit on Draco Malfoy’ Olympics:
was obvious.” He rests his thumb just under Harry’ navel. “Still so much to learn about me, Potter,” he teases, a wicked slant to his lips and in his eyes.
The man frowns as he mulls Draco's words over. Soon enough, he leans back, clearly satisfied with the dreadfully obvious code they've supplied.
He can't stand being seen by Potter. The feeling hits him hard, and sudden, and he's standing before he really registers it. His body knows what it's doing; it's running this show.
It's a gay club, but that's of course not why Draco has avoided it before tonight. Its size, its popularity, the fact that it is entirely Muggle―this is what has kept Draco at bay. It's hot in here, and overwhelming. So many people, alive and vibrant and pumping vivacious blood through glorious veins riddled with chemical substance. Draco has to shut his eyes, fingers holding onto the back of Potter's open plaid shirt so as not to lose him in the crowd. It's too much, the feeling of being a shark amongst tender shoals, a wolf in a field of lambs.
"Ah," Draco nods in understanding, forehead rubbing against Harry's. He kisses him once more, before sitting back on his haunches. His hands return to the hem of Harry's joggers. "It's ridiculous," he says again, looking up at Harry through his lashes as he urges Harry to lift his hips. "How much I've wanted you," he slips the material down Harry's thighs, running his hands against Harry's skin in their wake. "These past months." They both gasp as Draco leans down and kisses the head of Harry's cock, pressing up against the material of his pants. "And these past weeks." Draco looks up at Harry again, as he pulls the waistband of Harry's briefs down too. Harry lifts his hips once more, his cock springing free. It juts out in front of them, right before Draco's slightly parted lips. Draco rests his hands on Harry's thighs. "And how much I want you now," he finishes, before ducking forwards and sealing his lips around the head of Harry's cock.
"And did you like it?" Draco flicks his tongue out, sliding it up against the length of Harry's cock. He flattens his tongue as he reaches the head, slipping his mouth back over it and sucking briefly before pulling off again just as quickly.
It’s a habit of Harry’s recently, watching Draco when he’s unaware. He makes the oddest expressions, is the thing, and seems quite unable to hide what he’s feeling. It’s written right across his face: happiness, pleasure, distaste, amusement. Harry’d spent so much of his Hogwarts years thinking of Draco as this crafty, sneaky arsehole. A year or so into their Auror training, Harry amended that thinking a little. Draco was crafty, and he could be deeply sneaky when necessary, but he wasn’t as much of a deceptive genius as Harry had thought. He had just been a teenager, and then a man, and while unpredictable in his moods, he wasn’t that hard to read. Harry felt triumphant about this first, at having found a perceived weakness. Slowly, though, their unexpected friendship bloomed and Harry's animosity ebbed away to be replaced with a grudging respect, and then a tangible fondness. This knowledge was now another part of why Harry liked Draco.
"Yeah," he replies, voice rough as he brings both hands to cup Harry's head and tilt it back before he leans down, pressing his lips to Harry's.
“Thanks,” Draco says, again, just because he can. He tests the unfamiliar first name on his tongue, finds he likes it, and then creeps his fingers across his thigh and over to his left arm. He settles them on Harry’s loosely gripping hands instead, skips over the healing patch on his own arm without touching it. It feels like a minor victory. It might be one.
, which is lovely and embarrassingly makes Harry tear up. He’s had a hell of a few days; he lets himself off the hook for this one. Aggie politely doesn’t call him out on it when he wipes his wet cheeks on her suit jacket shoulder pads, or mention his red-rimmed eyes.
“Porkies.” Harry grins at Draco, still wriggling around as he tries to get comfortable on the blasted log. “Look at you, you’ve gone all Cockney.”
Draco realises, on the third day that he dozes and before the evening of their scheduled meeting with Darya, that he’s also keeping a secret of his own from Potter in turn.
Harry makes a face. "Does she look like a Tina?" He gestures at the cat, sitting on the chair next to him in her basket and licking her front paw.
He feels a bit like something has got to give, like he's a moose teetering precariously on ice that's getting thinner; it seemed fun at first, and within his grasp, but now his antlers are weighed down with snow and shit metaphors.
"It’s true." Potter steps back, appraising the fence as if he intends to scale it. "He made several. Innocuous objects, or meaningful ones. Some significant only to him. The diary your father gave to Ginny Weasley was one." Potter turns to look at Draco. The glare of a nearby streetlamp reflects off his glasses, obscuring the expression in his eyes from Draco’s view. In contrast, Draco suspects his own face is plain to read. He feels blindsided by this information.
It feels like he's coming forever, the way all truly good orgasms do―and not at all how a quick morning wank usually feels. Harry gasps, working himself through it and looking down at his hand as he wrings the last of his orgasm out of himself. He struggles to catch his breath for a moment, shower spray beating against his back and come swirling down the drain. He leans his forehead against the hand pressed against the wall to give himself a moment to recover, and to wonder how hard up for it he must have been for it to have felt like
“Hmm? Oh it was good, cheers.” Harry helps himself to some apple juice as well as his tea, then finally makes a decision and plops a toasted English muffin on his plate. He hisses when he finds it’s still scaldingly hot, charmed to feel fresh out of the toaster. He eyes off the fruit platter.
