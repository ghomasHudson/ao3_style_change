Harry’s mind was swirling. How had he not heard of IMF? Will they be fair in their investigations? Professor McGonagall was already moving away, no doubt trying to alert the key players to the upcoming investigation. There is nothing he could do about it now, so he decided it would be best to keep working and keep distracted. He turned and took one last look at Draco, seated now gazing out, lost in his thoughts. He had seen him try to help a few people but they either shied away or simply refused so he had moved off to the side awaiting his fate. Harry still couldn’t believe what he had done. When Harry jumped from Hagrid’s arms, Draco shot across the courtyard, throwing his wand to Harry. It was the bravest, dumbest, and out of character move, he had seen. If Voldemort had not been so stunned by Harry’s revival he would have certainly been killed mid run, and then to leave himself wandless as well. It very well saved everyone present and ended the war. Harry felt an ache in his chest. It had begun after the escape from the room of requirement, but with all that was happening he had assumed it was stress and nerves getting the best of him. Now however with the fight over he didn't know why it was still happening. Glancing over again at Draco, Harry wanted to go over to him but felt he would be rejected. While he didn't think that Draco would still be holding to childish rivalries, Harry was the last person Draco wanted comfort from since Harry represented everything that was causing Draco’s world to implode. McGonagall was walking toward Draco, a softer look on her face than last time they had faced each other when she ordered Filch to bring the Slytherins to the dungeons.
“We’ve been doing some research this morning before you arrived,” Narcissa began with a look that showed they had learned little about the boys’ condition. “Inspector Jankowski,” she nodded her head to the corner by the desk where a man sat in a chair that neither had noticed, “has got a list of all of the texts from the manor that maybe of help. They will be acquired by an IMF official and screened. That should take about two days, but we can continue to work without them for the time being.”
“Any new symptoms presenting for either of you, especially of a sexual nature?” she continued. Draco shifted uncomfortably while Harry nearly fell off the couch.
“That was the complete opposite of how I grew up,” Harry began, sounding unsure if he wanted to reveal this about himself. Draco knitted his brows, confused but stayed quiet, letting Harry compose himself. Finally, he sighed and smiled at Draco. “I suppose it’s best to start with a clean slate. No secrets or misunderstandings.”
“It’s quite alright, we were just on our way to start our interviews,” Barnes smiled as Mrs. Weasley. Ginny released Harry looking a little embarrassed and stepped back towards her mother. “If you are going to be around for a bit I can have someone find you when we take a break so you can visit?”
“It’s very well known in academic circles that the Black family are the guardians of a secret horde of knowledge on bonding,” she continued. “If this is true then Narcissa could be invaluable in this matter.”
Harry had moved his chair closer to Draco and had also held his hand under the table to try and comfort him, but with each toss of her hair or coy smile in Harry’s direction, his anger flared anew.
“Thank you, Minerva. You’ve always been a fair woman. I do have quite an extensive understanding of bonding that has been passed down through the Black family.”
“I know but I think that it is probably for the best. It will be good to get everything out. No more secrets.”
“Well is he ok? I was worried how he would be treated by other Death Eater after helping me in the courtyard,” Barnes smiled a little bigger at this.
“I think I should floo Inspector Barnes about this and hold him here,” Pomfrey said composing herself now that she had a plan formulating.
Draco froze at these words. He knew very well that there was a way to break the bond, but both parties had to agree to the break, and breaking the bond would leave permanent changes in both people, unlike with a magically induced bond. Harry was also taken off guard. He was still very unsure about all of this. He could see the expectant looks on the Weasley’s faces waiting for him to agree to breaking the bond excitedly but he couldn’t. Draco had been his enemy for years, but he was different, and Harry wanted to see this through.
They all jumped when they heard rustling behind them. They looked over to see Mrs. Weasley standing in the doorway to one of the bedrooms.
“I’m alright dear, it’s just going to take a while,” she responded quietly. “We finished with arrangements much sooner than we expected so we wanted to come see you all and to lend a hand with rebuilding,” She said louder for everyone to hear. “The funeral will be the day after next. George is here too, he’s in our tent just behind yours,” With the mention of the surviving twin the atmosphere in the tent darkened a bit. Hermione got up to check on the dinner and asked Mrs. Weasley come help her. Harry sat down next to Ginny with Ron on the other side of him on the couch. She gently reached out and grabbed his hand. A gesture of comfort, but it did little good. Harry felt the knots return to his stomach at the thought of all those lost in the battle, lives, and families forever changed by the evil that had threatened them. His mind wandered back to Draco, a young man whose family was at the heart of that evil returning. Why can’t I get that boy out of my head?
“I think the same is in order for you lot.” Harry noticed that as they were talking Ron and Hermione had also come over with McGonagall and Neville following close behind. “We have tents set up near the lake. You’ll stay there while we are investigating. Once we have finished with you, you may return to your homes. We will try to complete this as quickly as possible but with so many people we thought it best to keep everyone close and deploy as many investigators as possible. Since you four have played such a large part in all this I have decided to handle your questioning personally and it also means you will probably be here the longest.” Barnes explained. Ron opened his mouth to speak but Barnes was already aware of what he was going to ask. Holding up his hand he responded, “I am aware Mr. Weasley that you and many others have tragically lost members of your family and you will, of course, be given time to attend any services.
“Molly, I know you are upset but there is no reason to be throwing out baseless accusations,” McGonagall stepped into the conversation now. She had been just as shocked as everyone but had regained her composure.
“So, even though we are complete opposites, there is something about our magic that is similar and bonded?” Harry asked confused.
Draco walked out of the tent. “Sorry to have kept you waiting Inspector,” Draco said ignoring the rueful look on her face. She made her dislike of him clear but he was trying to behave, being in enough trouble as it was, but he was struggling to keep his upper crust, pureblood ideology in check. He no longer believed in many of those ideals but years of training and habit were hard to break.
Harry got up from the chair and sat next to Draco on the couch, the feeling of needing to be close to him was creeping up in him again. He didn’t fight it. Draco reached out and took Harry’s hand, squeezing it gently.
“Why don’t you boys try some of the activities on the list that you were given?” he asked. They both looked at him like he had two heads. “Look, I know this isn’t easy, but the more you fight it, the worse it will be.” They both knew he was right, even if they didn’t want to admit it.
“It’s alright but you should really try to stop stressing. Voldermort is dead and we are handling the Death Eaters. You need to concentrate on healing and being there for your friends,” Barnes rested his hand on Harry’s shoulder giving it a gentle squeeze. Harry looked down feeling tears stinging at the corners of his eyes. He knew Barnes was right but without a mission or a problem to focus on, he would be forced to face his feelings which he had suppressed for so long.
“Would you like a sandwich? You must be starving,” Wilcox said offering Draco one of the sandwiches on a plate.
“Mrs. Weasley, please, I’m tired of fighting and hate. I know this isn’t ideal, and I’m asking a lot of you even after you and your family have given me so much, but please can we please be civil? At least until we figure this out,” Harry said, getting up and going to her. She seemed to be thinking over everything, but her expression was quickly softening. “I can’t bear to lose anyone else, please.” Harry had tears welling in his eyes, as did Mrs. Weasley. With a swift movement, she enveloped Harry in a hug, both crying.
I would like to apologize for the delay in getting this chapter out. As an avid reader and someone with little patience, nothing is worse than waiting for the next chapter. Work and school have been very busy but I am hoping to get the next chapter out much sooner and have already started on it.
“Yes, I will have his guards moved up to the castle,” Barnes replied. “Now, if you’ll excuse me I must contact Justice Harrington about this.” With that, he swept out of the room.
“That’s just idiotic,” McGonagall said sternly. “She has nothing to gain by leading us astray or for that matter harming Harry.”
“You know exactly what I’m talking about. Slightly off readings? Did you do something to throw off her readings so you could stay here longer?”
“I think we need to make new accommodations for Harry and Draco. We don’t know if or how far they can be separated,” McGonagall spoke next. “Inspector Barnes I would like to keep them in the Castle for better protection. I can set up a room just down the hall if you are ok with this.”
“I see,” said McDaniels that said he only partially believed him. He began waving his wand over Draco and muttering spells pausing at times to take in the information that he was receiving. “Well, I think that is all I need. Madame Pomfrey would you join me in the hall?”
I would like to apologize to everyone for the long delay in the update. Life had been a bit of a whirlwind but I wanted to get going on this again. I missed writing this fic since the story has been rolling over and over in my head during my break. I also want to thank those have stuck with me as well.
“Yes, a little, thanks,” Draco responded. He noticed Ramirez was seated in a chair reading. She had not looked up or acknowledged Draco since handing him his clothing.
Harry awoke the next morning after a fitful night of sleep. He had had several nightmares and was still feeling drained when he crawled out of bed. Ron and Hermione were already awake and Hermione was busy in the kitchen of the tent making breakfast for them. Harry smelled the eggs and toast coming from the kitchen and walked in, taking a seat at the small table.
“Molly, I know how hard this is. I’ve lost several people very special to me, and as much as that hurt I can’t imagine if one had been my child. But Potter has very solid reasons for testifying and I believe it is the right thing to do.” At this Mrs. Weasley seemed to calm again.
“What are you playing at?” she hissed at him taking a step forward her wand never wavering from him.
Draco was struggling to keep his composure through this discussion. He hated being talked about like he wasn’t even there or a child. He also wanted to fill in their gaps in knowledge about bonding. For centuries the pureblood families had worked to understand and manipulate both magically induced and spontaneous bonds. It was crucial to continuing the great pureblood lines and to garner political clout. Arranged marriages were common then and bonds were used to assure these marriages remained strong. They also needed to overcome the spontaneous bonds that could lead purebloods to marry half-bloods or worse muggles. The family that is the guardians of this secret knowledge were the Blacks, whom Draco’s mother was a member of. She had passed down much of this knowledge to Draco over the years. He had assumed that over the centuries other wizards had also figured this information out, but it was clear they had not.
“I think that is all for today. We will pick this up tomorrow,” Barnes said leaning back and looking at the stack of parchment resting on the table now filled with precise writing of the Steno-Quill. He stood, as did Harry and Hermione and shook their hands. “Let’s meet back here tomorrow morning at 9:00 and finish this up?” They both nodded their assent and turned to leave.
“You haven’t allowed the bond to finish initiating?” She accused more than asked. “Don’t you know how incredibly dangerous that could be for the two of them?”
“Arthur, I think it’s time we go back to the tent,” Mrs. Weasley said grabbing her husband’s hand and heading for the door. She paused her hand reaching for the knob, she looked at Draco, who took a small step back and then turned back to Harry.
For the next two hours, Madame Pomfrey and Narcissa tested the Harry and Draco’s bond and found that separation into another closed room for about 15 minutes was the maximum that the bond would allow before symptoms would begin to happen. For Harry it was chest pain and tightness. Draco seemed to have stomach upset and nausea. They did not push the bond further and immediately brought the boys back together once both became symptomatic. Surprisingly, Draco was the first to have symptoms.
“Come with me young man,” said Inspector Wilcox with a distinctly New England American accent. “We’ll get you settled in and changed.” Draco glanced back at Harry and then walked off with Inspector Wilcox. Harry watched as he walked away, head down. Inspector Barnes began talking again.
Everyone arrived and greeted Harry warmly, completely ignoring Draco except for Hermione and Mr. Weasley. They sat down at the table, Harry making sure that Draco was on one side of him and Ginny ended up on the other side of him. Harry didn’t mind at first, but she soon began to flirt with him, subtly at first with innocently touching his arm or rubbing his shoulder. By the end of dinner, she had placed her hand on his leg several times, and he had brushed it away each time. Harry was becoming very uncomfortable with her behavior but didn’t want to cause a scene. He also felt a sense of anger that he knew was coming from Draco.
Draco nodded his head as she spoke to him, her hand resting on his shoulder. As she went on he looked to the ground and then shook his head no to something she said. She squeezed his shoulder and began to walk away. She glanced over, Harry tried to look away quickly but knew he had been caught. She looked at him with a look that seemed to say “don't just stare at him, go talk to him”. Harry got up and with hands shaking he made his way over to Draco.
Out on the lawn, Harry had fallen into a deep sleep, exhausted from the day. Suddenly he was overcome by a heavy wave of fear and anxiety causing him to wake suddenly. He sat bolt upright a sheen of sweat on his face. His heart was racing and he was shaking slightly. Then the wave hit him again but it wasn’t like how he normally woke. He had not been having a nightmare and this second wave that passed through him was causing a physical reaction in him but it was like it was coming from outside of him. He wanted to call to Hermione and see if she knew what was happening but he felt stupid after the years of waking like this he would bother her now. He lay back down and tried to clear his mind and go back to sleep.
“Well it looks like you have been bonded Mr. Malfoy,” McDaniels stated. Draco let his head fall. “But you already knew that, didn’t you?” Malfoy nodded. “Do you know who you are bonded with?” McDaniels hedged.
“Not a clue,” McDaniels answered without hesitation. “But I’d wager 10 galleons he does,” He said pointing to the door to the exam room.
“Ok, I should get back to the tent and help mom with the rest of the unpacking,” Ginny said trying not to sound hurt and disappointed. Harry hated hurting anyone but his mind was such a jumble at the moment he needed some alone time to try and sort it out.
“Shh, no need to be sorry, this is nothing you could help. I have to know; do you want this?” Draco looked at her for a beat trying to decide how to answer. She would know instantly if he lied to her. No matter how good he became at lying to others she could always see right through him.
“I’m going to need to discuss this development with the Judiciary Panel,” Barnes said breaking Harry from his thoughts. Harry moved a step closer to Draco as they lowered their hands, he was disappointed that he had to let go but he wasn’t sure why. It had been only a few days prior that Draco was his greatest nemesis and now Harry was disappointed he couldn’t continue to hold his hand. It didn’t last long. He felt Draco move closer to him as well, his hand brushing Harry’s, then one deft movement Draco entwined their fingers and squeezed gently. Harry squeezed back letting him know he approved of this.
“Don’t get a big head, she was the only one willing to do it,” Ramirez cut in. Madame Pomfrey turned to scowl at the woman.
“Yes Mr. Potter,” Barnes replied with a slightly raised eyebrow. Harry glanced back at the group and then Barnes who nodded and stepped a few feet away to speak with Harry.
“I’m doing ok, how are you, Mrs. Weasley?” Harry asked hugging her back. She had been the only really maternal figure in his life and it killed him to see her having to suffer the loss of one of her children especially since he felt it was his fault.
“Both are healthy and adapting well to the bond. It’s growing stronger. I can easily detect it now with common detection spells. I do detect they are fighting it a bit, not intentionally. Both are very closed off emotionally and that is definitely slowing the process,” Pomfrey reported.
“I’ve been doing some reading on bonding. They didn’t give specifics, but it did say that it was possible to break a spontaneous bond like you can with a magically induced bond,” Ginny said in an upbeat tone.
Harry, already feeling an ached in his chest, felt his stomach drop and the ache grow stronger at the mention of planning for Fred Weasley’s funeral. It was his fault that so many had died. Ron, Hermione, and all the Weasleys had tried to comfort him, telling him how if it hadn’t been for him many more would have died at the hands of Voldermort. Despite knowing this, Harry couldn’t help feeling extreme guilt.
“We can discuss this more with them, but I think returning to Hogwarts would be best. Since we know so little of how this bond is going to act Narcissa and I can be close by and it is familiar to both,” Pomfrey added jumping into the conversation.
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Draco said as he squeezed Harry’s hand again. Harry also thanked her and squeezed back.
“Listen to me Molly, I know you are in pain right now, but Draco had no involvement in this. This is a spontaneous bond. No one did this to them,” McGonagall said sternly. Molly looked like she was going to argue but then her shoulders sagged, she tossed one more look at Draco and then walked back to her husband. A few tense moments passed before Inspector Barnes spoke.
“I want to be transferred to another assignment. I didn’t join the investigation department to babysit a spoiled Death Eater.” At this last statement Narcissa visibly bristled, her mouth pursing and her jaw and neck muscles tightening. Barnes was also not pleased with this outburst.
Draco merely nodded, not trusting his voice to respond. He was beginning to regain control of himself. He hoped that whatever they thought was going on would come back negative and he would be allowed to return to his tent. The high emotion and being so far from Potter again was making the ache in his chest grow. He reached up unconsciously and rubbed the center of his chest.
The group quickly finished dinner and moved to the seating area. Draco sat behind Harry so he could be close without being involved, his mother beside him, and they talked quietly while the others visited. Mr. Weasley informed Harry that Fred’s funeral would be the day after next. They would be sure to work out a plan to get him to the funeral tomorrow. At this, Ginny came into the conversation.
“It’s going to be a long day and you both should really eat something more substantial,” Wilcox said looking over his paper and raising a cup of tea to his lips.
“I think we should also go as well,” Hermione said knowing it wouldn’t be long before Ron would be losing his temper as well. Ron opened his mouth to argue but Hermione had already grabbed his hand and was pulling him towards the door. “We’ll be back to see you soon Harry.” With that, both had left the room.
As he walked towards his tent he noticed a few people standing outside of a tent about 50 yards from his own tent. It was clearly one of the Inspectors with their royal blue robes. A younger woman with a dark complexion and jet-black hair. The other had his back to Harry. He had on jeans and a sweater. As Harry got closer he could now make out Draco’s distinctive blonde hair. Harry had been thrown by the Muggle clothing at first, Draco had never worn Muggle clothing before. He actually looked good in it. Harry fought the urge to continue past his own tent and go over to him remembering Barnes reasoning for keeping them apart. He did not want to do anything that might cause problems for Draco at his hearing. Instead, he slipped into his own tent feeling better knowing Draco was ok and so close to him.
“Nothing, just don’t want to be playing babysitter for this whole investigation is all,” Ramirez spat, he contempt flowing freely. Wilcox features darkened but he did not respond to her.
“They’re all full,” Pomfrey replied. “We’ll bring him in here.” With a flick of her wand, she transfigured a chair into an exam table. The three walked back out to the main room, Harry and his friends and Molly were waiting expectantly. Pomfrey smiled trying to provide some calm to the situation. “Healer McDaniels needs to get some potions from St. Mungo’s sent over. They should be here soon so we’ll have you wait in my office,” she motioned to her office and the four went inside.
Draco began to feel the fear and anxiety creep up in him again. They knew they had to know. Why else would they be doing all of this workup?
“Did you think we were just going to sit around having tea with each other for the rest of our lives?” Draco asked with a hint of his old sarcasm. He had tried to stop himself, but it was out before he could stop it. He knew he needed to be more tolerant and patient with others and Harry especially, but it was hard. In reality he was just as nervous thinking about the physical aspect of the bond.
“Of course, write down what you would like and we will have them reviewed. If they are deemed acceptable then you can have them. Also, I wanted to go over some things that will be happening in the next few days. First, you will have a medical exam by a healer tomorrow. All detainees are getting this to ensure that there is no lingering spells or jinxes affecting them.” At this Draco unconsciously reached up and rubbed the center of his chest which was still aching.
“Could I have a moment with you two?” Hermione asked. Draco and Harry looked at each other, and then Harry nodded.
“We believe the bond started when Harry saved Draco in the Room of Requirement. Unfortunately, it was only a partially initiated bond. It was just discovered a short while ago,” Madame Pomfrey continued the story.
She crossed to Draco in three steps and wrapped her arms around him, pulling him in tight for a hug. This surprised everyone including Draco, the others since she seemed like a cold woman, and Draco since he was certain her question meant her disapproval.
Everyone sat down on the couches and chairs of the sitting area, Madame Pomfrey in her usual nurse’s uniform, any remnant of yesterday’s disheveled state gone. Mrs. Malfoy too also looked completely different. Washed up her hair pulled back into a simple updo and a basic black dress and deep purple robe. Even in such simple attire she still had an air of nobility to her.
“Healer McDaniels I am sure we have taken enough of your valuable time if you would like to return to the wounded,” McGonagall said dismissing the healer. She then conjured a Patronus, spoke to it with a brief message and sent it off. “While your room is being prepared I wanted to have a word with you boys. This is going to be an extremely trying time for you both and I want you to know that whatever you need, either of you, I’ll do my best to help.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other. They felt like animals being studied in a lab. Harry knew they had to be cautious and that he and Draco’s situation was very different than normal, but he still hated being the odd ball. Why couldn’t he just be normal.
Draco tried desperately to rein in his emotions, knowing that last wave when Ramirez pulled her wand had probably been felt by Potter. He pressed his hands into the table to not show the shaking.
“Not exactly Harry. Your magical signature is what muggles would call a spirit. Despite how different you and Draco may appear, you are clearly more compatible than you can see,” Narcissa clarified. “But as long as you’re willing, we can help you through this.”
“Unfortunately, Inspector Barnes, I’m not going to be able to provide you with much. Yes, this is a spontaneous soul bonding of their magical signatures. It was only partially initiated because of the stress of the battle and was completed in front of you just moments ago. Beyond that I can only give generalities. Every bond is unique especially these types. They follow some similar patterns like allowing the bonded parties to have a greater distance between them and for longer periods than the external magically induced bonds but how far and how long varies greatly. We simply have to carefully test it in a controlled environment,” Narcissa explained in her matter of fact tone.
“But we can talk about that and much later. We'll be interviewing you and everyone else present at the battle. That includes you too Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco looked down at the Dark Mark on his forearm as he changed, disgusted by it and himself. Disgusted that he had once been foolish enough to believe in this creature and his ideas. Disgusted that he had not been stronger at resisting being branded. He finished changing and pulled back the curtain.
“How dare you speak to my daughter that way! The only you aren’t rotting in a ramshackle dorm is because your Death Eater son has managed to latch onto Harry. You need to learn your place!” Molly’s face was red as she pointed at Narcissa, who had turned and listened to her tirade impassively, which seemed to irritate Molly further.
“Yeah, I just had some questions about tomorrow is all. Everything is good,” Harry managed a small smile to the group and Mrs. Weasley got up to give him a hug.
“what’s going on? Harry, you look awful!” she said her motherly instincts kicking in. The other two related to her what Harry had told them. She looked at them for a moment then said, “We’re taking you to the hospital wing.”
“Ginny dear, take it easy. I didn’t bring you along to interrupt while Harry is trying to help the investigation,” Mrs. Weasley scolded as she came up behind.
Turning their attention back to Draco they walked into the other exam room. Ramirez was at attention as soon as she saw Barnes walk in with the others.
“I know that most guys my age would be all over the chance to, you know, but it’s just never something I had time to consider or think about. I’ve only kissed two people before,” Harry said not able to look at her.
Once Harry finished telling him about Hagrid coming to find him and the lengths his aunt and uncle had gone to keep him from going to Hogwarts, Draco then picked up the storytelling and began giving more details of his childhood allowing himself to open up for the first time and detail some of the not so nice things of his past like a controlling and overbearing father.
The time passed slowly in mostly silence, occasionally broken by quiet talk between Draco and his mother. Harry had so many questions for both Draco and Narcissa, but he didn’t feel now was the time. Perhaps it was their pureblood, high society upbringing but both seemed very unapproachable and distant. It may also have been their chosen side’s recent loss in the second wizarding war. Harry could only imagine what was going through their heads. After what seemed like hours but was probably only 45 mins, Barnes and McGonagall returned.
A snort came from behind Pomfrey. “If it’s nothing then I’ll just take him back to the tent and when the healers aren’t so busy helping those who deserve and need it, then they can look at him.” Ramirez clearly didn’t want to wait around any longer than she had to and if he wasn’t dying then that was good enough for her. Pomfrey, however, was having none of it.
“Of course, prisoners are to be monitored at all times,” Ramirez replied with a cold look. Draco clearly understood what she was doing, asserting her power and reminding him that it didn’t matter that he wasn’t with everyone else he was still nothing more than a disgusting Death Eater, not worthy of basic privileges like privacy.
“The same for me, you know how protective of my student,” McGonagall added. Narcissa’s face softened at these words.
“Mrs. Malfoy thank you for joining us. I’m afraid we have a bit of a situation with your son and Harry Potter,” Barnes said once she had been introduced to him and Healer McDaniels, the only two she didn’t know in the room. As he spoke her eyes became wide and darted between Draco and Harry. “It seems that Draco and Harry have bonded, at least partially.” This was the first time her face betrayed any discernible emotion.
“Ending a magically induced bond and a spontaneous bond are two very different things, Ms. Weasley. Magically induced bonds only superficially attach magical signatures. Spontaneous bonds actually entwine the signatures, merging pieces of each person’s signature with the other. Breaking that bond leaves permanent damage to both magical signatures and, in turn, to each person. Perhaps you should understand what you are speaking about before tossing out such things with impunity.” Narcissa turned to return to her seat when Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.
“Can you really help us understand what’s happening?” Harry asked ignoring the thanks. He had only done what was right and didn’t want any more praise. His mind had been a swirl of emotion and thoughts. He knew that he liked both men and women but had never given any thought to Malfoy as a potential love interest. His opinion of him had drastically changed over the last year and he did want to get to know Malfoy better, but this much?”
“That’s simple, the Boy Who Lived wanted to only give his testimony in person. He just defeated the most feared wizard in the world. A request like that wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. It’s keeping them away from everyone coming and going from the ministry. Being seen arriving and leaving together will be hard to explain away,” Narcissa replied. Barnes smiled. This woman was quick on her feet and crafty.
“I’m sure it was very similar to yours, just in a non-magical family. I was spoiled and got whatever I wanted. I wish they hadn’t, but it’s what they felt was best.” Draco replied in a clipped voice, looking almost ashamed.
“That was said for the others present. Despite coming into this situation late we have been able to gather quite a bit of information thus far as well as listening to the rumblings from Death Eaters we have captured. Your family is not in high regard with them at the moment and you especially,” Wilcox gave Draco a wane smile and opened the flap.
“Sexual nature?” he exclaimed finding his voice. He looked from Pomfrey to Narcissa to Draco, his heart beginning to race. He felt naïve and stupid that he hadn’t thought of this, of course the bond would pull them together not just romantically but also sexually. It also frightened him to the core. He had only kissed two girls before. Unlike most teenage boys he had spent the last few years looking over his shoulder and trying to stay alive, sex had not been high on his list of concerns.
“I... I don’t know what you are talking about,” Draco stammered sliding back on the table trying to keep the distance between them. His heart was racing and his head was spinning. What the hell was this woman’s problem?
They walked across the green lawn marred with black marks from stray spells hitting the grown. The afternoon was bright and sunny with a gentle breeze. Harry looked around him taking in the destruction around him contrasted with blossoming flowers and chirping birds. All of the casualties had been removed and royal blue robed wizards were hurrying around collecting evidence, cleansing areas of residual dark magic, and interviewing survivors. As he continued to walk with Hermione and Barnes, he heard someone call out his name. He turned to see someone running towards him. He turned to see a flash of red hair streaking towards him, then suddenly a body was pressed against him their arms wrapped around him.
“Come sit down, we need to go over some things with you.” Wilcox motioned to a chair close to Ramirez, who finally put down her book. She looked put out and irritated. “As you can see Draco you are not being housed with the other detainees but you will be under many of the same rules. Inspector Ramirez and I will be watching over you. You are allowed out of the tent, there is a perimeter that has been set up that will prevent others from entering and you from leaving. That perimeter extends to and includes the tree and rock outside if you wish to sit by them. If you need anything you need to request it of one of us. We will make sure you have basic needs like clothes, food, toiletries, etc but if something else should come up then let us know. Any questions?”
The next morning the boys were awakened by Wilcox after a night of fitful sleep. Breakfast was laid out on the table, but neither was very hungry and only picked at it while Wilcox read an American Wizarding newspaper.
“I won’t take much of your time, but I just wanted to say that I’ve also been doing some reading, and while I have a lot to learn about bonds, I do know this is not something to be taken lightly. We’ve had our differences Draco, but if there is anything either of you needs, I’m here to help.”
“Molly just showed up with Potter looking just as bad as bad as Malfoy. I remember helping her through her bonding with Arthur years ago. She has the same symptoms Malfoy is having, and she believes Potter is going through the same.”
“Actually, yes sir, I had wanted to ask you about Draco…” Harry asked, trailing off, hoping that his inquiry wouldn’t be met with scorn or suspicion. Barnes gave a half smile and motioned for him to take a seat.
“Harry!” Ginny said excitedly as she hugged him. Harry instinctively brought his arms up around her to return the hug. Hermione and Barnes stopped noticing the exchange. “I’ve been going crazy wanting to see you! Everything happened so fast after the battle,” Ginny continued as she squeezed him tighter and then pulling back to look at him. He forced a small smile for her and told her he had missed her too.
“Thank you, sir. It's nice to meet you. I'm sure most of what you heard is exaggerated greatly,” Harry replied shaking Investigator Barnes.
Harry and Draco had lunch and kept to themselves for most of the afternoon. Inspector Wilcox continued to watch them subtly as he read his book. He had been instructed to try to encourage them to get to know one another rather than staying apart.
“I didn't think that you'd want to see me,” Harry replied not quite looking at Draco, his voice quiet.
“Inspector Barnes, I hate to interrupt but I feel that we should notify Mr. Malfoy’s parents of this development. They are in the detainee camp, aren’t they?” McGonagall asked fixing Barnes with a look that didn’t leave room for argument.
“Madame Pomfrey why don’t you take Draco to the exam area for his check,” Narcissa interjected sensing the tension and anxiety in the group. “Harry why don’t you and I talk while Draco is examined.”
“Harry! What’s wrong?” Hermione asked jumping up from the couch and going over to him. Ron followed close behind.
It was finally over thought Harry as he looked out over the destruction of the Hogwarts castle. So many had lost their lives but it was finally done now. Harry’s mind was still spinning trying to wrap his brain around how his life was going to change. His eyes fell on someone with platinum blonde hair and black suit, both very disheveled. His shoulders were slumped looking out over the lake, Harry assumed trying to avoid seeing the destruction wrought by Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry felt bad for Draco, his whole world was crumbling around him. Everything he had known was gone. Draco could be the biggest prat on the face of the planet but he still didn’t deserve this. Nor did he deserve the choices he was forced to make over the last few years. Being forced to decide between the safety of his family and doing something you didn’t want to do. Harry could see it in Draco’s eyes when he was in the Room of Requirement. Professor McGonagall was coming towards him, clearly with something important to tell him.
“It’s about Malfoy…Draco. I’m not asking for special treatment but I’m worried about him. He helped us a great deal in these last few months and in the last moments of the battle. I know there were some wrongs on his part but I believe they were done to save his or his family’s lives. I am not sure he will be safe with the other Death Eaters.” Harry kept his voice low and tried not to hurry his words since he was so nervous. His brow knit in concern. Barnes looked at him appraisingly for a few moments then nodded.
Barnes had Wilcox and Ramirez take Harry and Draco to the rooms that had been readied for them while he stayed behind to talk with Narcissa, Pomfrey, and McGonagall who had stepped out to instruct the inspectors where the rooms were. Once everyone was gathered again Barnes lead the discussion.
“Here you are,” she said, arms outstretched. “This has several changes of clothes and some toiletries. Unfortunately, we were only able to acquire muggle clothing.” Her tone clipped and to the point.
“I’ve looked after this boy since the day he arrived at this school and I would have found a way to be here even if someone else had volunteered,” She responded making Ramirez’s neck muscles tighten with irritation. “Now, have a seat Mr. Malfoy, this won’t take long at all. I just have to run some basic diagnostic spells on you to make sure you weren’t hit with any stray spells or curses you may not have realized.
Everyone nodded and murmured their agreement to this plan and heading in their separate directions with Narcissa and Inspector Barnes heading to the boys’ suite just down the hall. When they arrived, they found the two sitting on the couch, each pushed to one side or the other. Clearly the bond was trying to push them together, but old habits die hard. Ramirez immediately jumped up from her chair with Wilcox following more languidly.
I know this is a bit of an odd point to end but I really wanted to get this up. I have been playing with this chapter for about two weeks and I really want to move into some alone time with the two and spend some time with that building the relationship.
“That was exhausting. We should head back to the tent and get something to eat,” Hermione said looking at Harry who seemed to have spaced out. ”Harry?”
“I think I can help with getting them in and out,” McGonagall spoke again. “I’ll send a patronus to Kingsley Shacklebolt to connect the fireplace in my office to his at the Ministry for a brief time. The Minister for Magic has a private elevator to the Judiciary Chambers. He can take them down and through the back entrance to avoid any on lookers and do the same when they leave.”
Barnes, McDaniels, and Pomfrey all looked at one another, knowing that he was lying to them but at this point, there is no reason to push him about it. Pomfrey and McDaniels left to go run diagnostics on Harry. Barnes stayed behind with Draco. Time seemed to crawl by until McDaniels and Pomfrey returned from examining Potter. When they walked back in they nodded to Barnes, confirming what was already known.
“I’m sorry for how I’ve treated you in the past. It was ignorance and fear, which is not an excuse, but all I can do is apologize,” Draco replied sincerely.
I feel like I have done this on every chapter I write but my apologies. I did not intend for this to languish for so long but life got out of hand. I had some inspiration watching Harry Potter over again and hope to update this. I am working on the next two chapters as this goes up
Once alone again Ramirez spun around her wand pointed at Draco, who was taken off guard, his mind whirling with thoughts about what the healer may discover.
Healer McDaniels brought out his potions and began giving them to Draco with the accompanying spells, making notes on his parchment. After about half hour of this, he finally set down his wand.
“I know, but we need to allow the bond to complete. Boys, come over here please,” she gestured to each boy. They both approached after a moment’s hesitation. Each still unsure of this. Once they were both close enough to her she placed a hand on each of their shoulders. “Now to complete this you just need to make physical contact with each other. A handshake should do and shouldn’t be too difficult.” She removed her hand and stepped back as they raised their hands. It seemed like an eternity, Harry looked deep into Draco’s grey eyes. Gone was the hard, cold detachment of years past. Now a softer more vulnerable pair of grey eyes looked back at him. With one final beat, Harry grasped Draco’s outstretched hand.
“My little dragon,” she whispered to him as she hugged him close. “I’m not upset, I asked you because I know you would know for certain if there was a bond,” She continued comforting Draco.
It was when the snatchers had brought Luna Lovegood to Malfoy Manor that he truly began to change his thinking. Luna, a relation of his by some distance, was a sweet, intelligent and caring person that had done nothing to anyone. She was being used to coerce her father into providing information to the Death Eaters. It was at this time that Draco began to change his thinking. He rarely slept and would sneak off to the library and read up on Dark Wizards of the past. A few times he came across parallels to the Muggle world which he also researched. He was astounded at how an idea could destroy so many if peddled by the wrong sort. Some may think it odd that Draco would help Harry in the battle but he knew that if he and his family had any chance of living then Voldermort had to be destroyed. Sadly, sitting in this tent was his consequence for being in line with the Dark Lord.
“I quite agree, that wouldn’t be fair. Perhaps just Mr. Weasley could visit and relay back to the others. Despite his and my husband’s spats, he is the more sensible of them.” Narcissa said her tone flat as she tried to keep the condescension that would have previously laced her response.
Out in the tent, Harry had been laying quietly almost back to sleep when he felt the wave of anxiety and fear coming over him again. He also felt the ache in his chest surge to almost a crushing pain. Scared he decided he had to get Hermione. He stumbled out of bed. Grabbed his glasses and wand muttering lumos. In the cone of light, he looked to the other side of the tent to find an empty bed. She must still be with the Weasleys. He threw on his jeans and shoes and walked the few yards to their tent. Peeking inside he saw Hermione and Ron seated on the couch talking softly and hold hands. He pulled back and rapped on the flap to make some noise before entering. They looked up at him as he entered looking pale and sweaty.
“How could we possibly trust anything she would tell us? She could harm Harry.” McDaniels continued.
“I’m not sure to be completely honest.” Harry looked at her quizzically. He had not known Professor McGonagall to be anything but to the point. “I’ve just received word that investigators from the International Magical Federation are on their way to investigate Voldemort and the Death Eaters. The Chancellor has convened a special judiciary panel to look into this.”
“This boy is just as deserving of quality healing as anyone else,” she chided Ramirez. “He will stay here until we can completely clear him. Is that understood young lady?” Pomfrey watched as the use of young lady cut through the Inspector, her own game being played on her. She nodded curtly and Pomfrey bustled out of the room.
“Can I have books?’ Draco asked lenitively. He was clearly being treated special and did not want to push things but he knew that if he had hours of free time he would need something to do or he would go crazy.
“Let’s press on,” Barnes said clearing his throat first. “So, there is no way that they can safely remain the way they are even though they have already done so for two days?” he asked skeptically.
“We think we might know what is causing the abnormal readings on you Mr. Malfoy. However, to be certain we need to do some additional testing. This will require some potions be sent from St. Mungos. They will be here within the hour but you’ll have to wait here.”
Draco followed behind Inspector Wilcox as he led him down behind the castle and instead of veering to the right to the remains of the Quidditch Pitch where the dorm-style housing had been hastily constructed, he veered left toward the lake. Draco followed, not saying anything for the moment. They continued walking, taking an indirect path, staying close to the forest then finally moving into the clearing to a small tent near the edge of the forest.
Harry was becoming very anxious, so much so that it was smashing into Draco. Without thinking, he got up and went to Harry putting his arm around him. Molly caught this out of the corner of her eye.
“Of course. Tomorrow will be longer than today. I have a lot more questions and gaps to fill in after Voldermort’s return so I imagine he will be free about the same time you are.”
“I’m sorry, Harry, dear. I don’t want to lose you either. I felt that’s what was happening.” She kissed his forehead and gave him another hug. “I think we should be going now.” They all gathered their things and headed to the door. Hermione held back.
“Did your reading happen to mention the consequences of breaking the bond?” Narcissa asked her tone clipped.
“Let’s get this going then. I need to know how far we can keep them, so I can begin to get Draco’s testimony. Plus, the Weasley’s and Ms. Granger have been pestering me to allow them to see Harry, so I am allowing a visit after dinner tonight.”
“Crabbe unleashed a Fiendfyre that he couldn’t control, it quickly consumed the room. Ron, Hermione and I found brooms and were heading out when I saw Draco and Goyle clinging to a pile of thing, I made Ron go back and I picked up Draco and he picked up Goyle. We made it out just in time.” This was the first time Harry had spoken since initially learning of the bond.
By lunch time it was apparent that the boys were being worn down by the testing and they were brought back to their rooms for lunch. Originally they were to come back but the decision was made to allow them to stay in their quarters with a list of activities to help them get to know one another.
Draco gave Harry a smile half smile, but with none of the usual sneer that always used to lace his smirks toward him. Draco reached up and gently rubbed his chest a bit. The gesture made Harry realize the ache in his own chest. Before he could say anything more he heard footsteps coming towards them. Harry turned to see who was coming. McGonagall approached with a man walking next to her, a royal blue robe flowing around him and a bright official seal embroidered on the left chest. He was tall with jet black hair and tanned skin; his posture ram rod straight.
“Inspector,” Harry said holding up his hand. “I don’t mean to interrupt but I had wanted to ask you about attending Fred Weasley’s funeral. Mr. Weasley sent word that they had moved it a few days out to allow for some family to get here.”
“But sir, I…” Barnes put up his hand stopping her in mid-sentence. She closed her mouth and headed out of the room.
Draco wasn’t hungry but he knew he needed to eat to regain his strength. It was not going to be easy in the coming days and weeks for him.
“That would be lovely, thank you, inspector,” Mrs. Weasley replied. She turned to Ginny. “We best be going and find your father. There is a lot of work to be done getting this place right.”
“Let’s look at the list,” Draco suggested grabbing the parchment from the table that they had been given. They couldn’t agree on any of the items, so they decided just to talk instead.
“I’m sorry Narcissa, we didn’t mean to put them in harm’s way. I would never knowingly place anyone especially my students in danger,” Madame Pomfrey cut in looking genuinely concerned.
Harry rose from his chair, thanked Inspector Barnes again and left to return to the tent. His mind raced as he walked back to the tent. Why was he so worried about Draco? He was grateful to Draco for all that he had done for him but it still didn’t explain this feeling that he had to make sure Draco was ok, and an urge to be near him. This had started about an hour ago while still giving his interview with Hermione. He began to get this feeling that he had to go to Draco, be close to him. He couldn’t explain it and it was freaking him out. Barnes telling him that he could see him tomorrow had eased the anxious feeling that had been building a bit but not much.
“I need information and answers. We are in a very difficult time immediately after Voldermort’s fall from power and death. I now have the most revered person in the wizarding world bonded to the son of one of the most prolific Death Eaters by an ancient magic known to very few people. As you can imagine trying to accommodate this bond without punishing Harry or seeming to give preferential treatment to Draco is going to be nearly impossible. So, I need as much information as I can. Narcissa, what more can you tell me?” Barnes asked, showing for the first time, tension in his normally calm demeanor.
“I believe that is up to Mr. Malfoy. He is of age now so alerting his parents is his discretion.” They all turned to Draco for his response.
“Harry there is nothing to worry about. As yours and Draco’s relationship grows, you’ll become more comfortable and eventually you both will know it’s the right time to become intimate.” Harry nodded not feeling especially calmed by this but knowing he had no choice but to deal with this.
“And what about me?” Draco finally spoke since back in the hospital wing. Everyone turned to looked at him.
“Who Malfoy is bonded to, it’s Potter,” she said clarifying her statement. McDaniels blanched like Pomfrey had just moments before.
“What do you mean?” Healer McDaniels asked folding his arms across his chest. He clearly was defensive with his lack of knowledge.
“I think you’re right Madame Pomfrey, and I’ll be here to monitor the house arrest. IMF is estimating at least six months to get through the investigation and hearings for those involved as well as assist in the rebuilding of Hogwarts. Mrs. Malfoy would you join me in speaking to Draco and Harry? Headmistress I’ll be by your office in the morning to see about the floo to the Ministry and then we can all meet for breakfast and begin testing this bond.”
“I understand how important this is to Potter, but I doubt it will be safe for me to be in a room of my former enemies, especially when they are mourning one of their own,” Draco continued. Harry could feel his anger start to rise in him at Draco’s words and flat tone. Then Draco turned to him and he could see the fear in his grey eyes and the anger dampened but was replaced with a nagging anxiety about what both were going to have to give up because of this bond.
“Inspector Ramirez will be here shortly with clothing and supplies,” Wilcox said sitting down in a chair.
“I’m afraid not at the moment,” Harry’s heart sank. He wasn’t even sure why he wanted to see Draco or what he would say but there was something in him telling he needed to see him. He felt the sharp ache in his chest that had been almost gone suddenly return. Barnes obviously detecting Harry’s reaction quickly followed up.” He will be going through his medical clearance exam this evening and then his interrogation tomorrow. Once these are done then you can see him. With his hearing approaching it would not look good to have him getting outsider visits prior to giving his statements,” Harry nodded his understanding, the ache in his chest dulling a note but still very much there.
This chapter was longer than my previous chapters but I had a lot of ground to cover. Hope you enjoy.
“Like I said, I need some potions to do more in-depth testing, and I’ll be requesting them from St. Mungo’s but I’m almost certain. It fits with his complaint of the chest pain as well.”
“I apologize for Inspector Ramirez’s behavior,” Barnes said looking at Narcissa and Draco. “We’ve come to talk with you both about how things will happen heading forward.”
“Him? There is no way that Harry is bonded to that pompous prat!” she spat. Harry saw the anger cross over Draco’s face at her words but quickly regaining his composure.
“I don’t think it should be at the expense of seeing his, for lack of a better word, family. Especially since Draco has had you here this whole time.”
He turned the water on and splashed his face then looked in the mirror at his gaunt disheveled appearance. So different than the haughty, bratty kid of years past, spoiled beyond belief by his parents. He didn’t blame his parents, they had only wanted the best for him but they had never denied him anything and bowed to his whims. It wasn’t until Voldermort had returned that reality had come in a slapped Draco down. That was when he truly learned what the consequences of the pureblood ideology he had drummed into him really were. He was horrified at himself but more so the others around him. He was forced to make terrible choices to keep his family and himself safe.
“Well, now you are aware. Partially initiated bonds are very unstable and dangerous. They can go from seemingly fine to needing to be within inches of each other to not be physically ill in moments. Once initiated they are much safer.”
Inspector Wilcox emerged soon after Draco finished, and the boys separated themselves, still not comfortable with being close with others around. Wilcox busied himself in the small kitchen, preparing dinner. With a flick of his wand, the little four-person table expanded to be able to accommodate the additional guests.
“Almost done now, just two more spells, but everything is looking good,” Pomfrey smiled at Draco as she waved her wand. Draco began to relax; maybe possible partial bond would slip by. Then Madame Pomfrey’s brows knitted with a questioning look and she mumbled something about being odd. Draco felt as if a block of ice had been dropped into his stomach. He paled and his palms began sweating. He was trying to keep his anxiety in check but it wasn’t working. He was certain that if the bond was discovered between him and Potter that he would be accused of casting it as a way to protect himself even though it had spontaneously occurred. Why it had was still a mystery to Draco but even if he knew it wouldn’t change things now.
“Well if you both are ready let us head up to the castle and start getting your story down,” Barnes said shifting topics and taking the light off of Harry. Both of them nodded and headed out behind Inspector Barnes.
They both wordlessly forced down a bit of egg and a half of toast. Satisfied, Wilcox gathered the dishes onto the tray and in moments it had disappeared. Harry and Draco had already showered and dressed before coming out to breakfast so with a nod he turned raised his wand and muttered a few words. A flash of blue light came from around the door then swung open.
“Yeah, I lived in the cupboard under the stairs once I was too big for a crib till the summer after my first year at Hogwarts.”
“Oh Draco,” she pulled him close again, assuring him with her hug that he had nothing to worry about. “This certainly wouldn’t be how I hoped this would happen, but I love you Draco and I want you to be happy.” She pulled away from Draco and returned her attention to Inspector Barnes. “Thank you, but I doubt that you brought me here just to tell me this.” Her demeanor had taken a professional rather than defensive tone. She was a smart woman who knew that they needed something for her.
Mr. Weasley was on his feet at this point, trying to calm and restrain his wife. Ron and Ginny were staring daggers at Draco as he attempted to comfort Harry. Ginny was the only one to speak.
“That will work fine thank you,” Draco responded quietly and took the package to his corner of the tent.
Draco was sitting on a piece of broken stone wall, his back against what had once been the side of a window opening. His eyes were closed and one foot was resting on the opening and the other on the ground. Harry approached cautiously not sure how he would react to him.
Draco sat tense on the edge of the exam table hoping that these diagnostics would not give her any indication of what was happening within him Being from a pureblood family he had been taught a great deal about bonding, both spontaneous and magical since bonding was a way for families to become dynasties, merging power and money to grow stronger. Draco couldn’t be certain but he was very sure that the symptoms he was experiencing were from a partially initiated bond. It occurred when Harry had grabbed him in the room of requirement, saving him from the FiendyFire. Being that both of them were under such immense stress and emotion the bond could not fully initiate.
Ramirez looked like she wanted to punch someone. “Is this really necessary?” she asked exasperatedly.
She led him up the lawn along the forest line like Wilcox had done, turning towards the back side of the Castle. Once they reached it they walked along the wall till they entered the courtyard and then the main entrance. They climbed the stairs to the fifth floor and walked down a long corridor till they reached the entrance to the hospital ward.
A knock came at the door before he could say more. McGonagall walked in briskly and motioned Barnes aside. They spoke briefly in whispers and then excused himself before leaving with McGonagall. Harry looked to Draco and Narcissa, but they both seemed to be just as lost as he was.
“Oh I'm almost certain it has, but from what little Professor McGonagall has told me, you are still a talented young wizard that has accomplished much for someone your age,” Investigator Barnes smiled again at Harry.
Draco blanched seeing the glint in Molly’s eye. He had been afraid something like this would happen. This would be turned around on him. Suddenly McGonagall reached up and grabbed Molly’s shoulder and turning her around.
“I think it would be best to turn in early. We have another long day tomorrow,” Wilcox said hesitantly. Both nodded their agreement and went to their room. They each changed and slipped into bed with the drapes open, neither saying anything.
“I agree,” McDaniels said nodding. “And I’ll floo St. Mungo’s immediately and I should have the potions within the hour.
“Potter this is chief investigator Maxwell Barnes from the justice division of IMF,” McGonagall said as she neared. Investigator Barnes smiled at Harry and nodded.
“Come in!” called Barnes through the door. “Ah Harry, what brings you back? Did you forget something?” Barnes looked questioningly at him.
“It just aches now and then. Probably just stress from the past few days is all,” Draco replied not looking at the healer.
Harry and he were in a precarious state and to leave them as such would be dangerous, especially if they were trying to keep them apart. There was a way to break the bond, however, it was a very complex process that required both parties to submit to the breaking, but it could only be done once the bond had been initiated. Sadly, he knew that no one would listen to him about any of this. He only hoped that they would abide by the healer and keep them as close as possible.
“I am willing. I still don’t feel I understand this but if this is what is meant to be then I am willing to try, but doesn’t the bond need to be completed first?” At this Narcissa’s features hardened and she turned on the healer and Barnes.
Madame Pomfrey walked back into the exam room to find a still ashen Draco and an impatient inspector Ramirez eagerly waiting for news.
“I believe you Molly, but ah it just took me by surprise. I need to get one of the other healers to assist. I’ll be right back,” Pomfrey bustled away to find McDaniels. Once she returned with the healer Barnes had also arrived and she motioned for him to follow her into her office. “We’ll be back in just a moment, Molly.”
