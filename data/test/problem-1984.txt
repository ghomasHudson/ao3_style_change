He regretted paying up to have an extensive in-flight drinks menu.
“Draco, if you don’t stop staring at the door every five seconds, I’m going to bloody murder you,” Blaise muttered, kicking his friend under the table.
Closing my eyes to the near-blinding stadium lighting, I breathe in the unique combination of broom polish, leather, and grass that has become so familiar. Then, grabbing my trusty Firebolt Xtra, we start the march to the pitch.
The letter came up clean, so he cautiously opened it and scanned for the signature… Hermione Granger. His eyes immediately jumped back to the top of the note, desperately needing to know what was written.
“Isn’t that the one that promises to be a ‘full-feature gastronomic experience’ or some pretentious bullshit like that?”
“Oh, before I forget... you need to tell me if you want a ticket to Sunday’s match,” Ginny interrupted his thoughts, and Draco nodded absentmindedly.
Admittedly, whenever I’d pictured Draco over the years, I’d never thought of blue hair, tattoos, and nipple piercings. The last one, especially, had been a shock. A very welcome shock. I’d never known how much two little pieces of metal could turn me on. But the reactions a gentle tug could elicit….
“I like you, Draco. After that night… I thought we would be something. An us. But then we got interrupted, and we didn’t have time to explore what something meant.”
“Granger. Potter. Fancy running into you here,” he greeted in what was most likely the most cordial tone he had ever used with them.
That’s when he saw him: the familiar head of platinum blond hair, long and tied back in a silky ponytail. Their eyes met, and Harry sucked in a breath at the stormy grey eyes that stared back at him. He couldn’t look away. He nodded in acknowledgment and stood up.
He would never admit that the teasing was just what he needed to stay calm, but his best friend knew. They both had grown up in households where any sign of weakness was punished, and it had created an unspoken bond between them.
“Malfoy… Draco… what…?” Harry incoherently mumbled, pulling out of their embrace and turning away from Draco, who just wanted to reach out and give comfort. But this both was and wasn’t the James Smith he’d been rooming with, flirted with, and had just impulsively kissed. And the metaphorical line between him and Harry Potter was not the same as his Muggle roommate with the motorbike.
The air smells funny.  Dad tells me it’s the sea.  I don’t know if I like it.

supposed to be a wedding. He felt even more daft thinking back to his thought process during the ceremony.
“Harry, this is Capucine, she’s an abstract expressionist and will be teaching us today. We met at a gallery in Paris last year, and her work is sublime.”
Harry walks by “Dragon Designs” twenty times before he allows himself to peer through the windows. He cups his hand over his eyes to see better and inspect the art on the walls. If he were being honest with himself, he also hopes to catch a glimpse of a certain attractive former classmate that he hasn’t seen since Hogwarts.
Draco could see the slight tremor of Neville’s hands. Despite Neville’s mastery of his field and his famous acts of bravery, there was still a hint of the shy boy who had disrupted every Potions class with a mistake.
Draco let his hand fall.
“Cheers,” Draco raised his glass to clink the rims and take a sip. His mouth was dry from nerves. “Actually, do you remember Colour Harvest?”
They ate out often, both for Draco's work and for dates. Draco had always loved his job, but his meals definitely tasted better with good company. His editor even claimed that his reviews and critiques were less acerbic and biting than they had been.
“Will he be back to tuck me in tonight?”
Blaise followed suit shortly after that, claiming that he needed to rest for an early morning in front of the Wizengamot. Harry didn’t seem to remember that Blaise had told them just last week that he was taking the day off to visit his boyfriend at Hogwarts.
Of all the weird dreams his head makes him live through, this one is up there in what-the-fuck-ness. For sure.
Harry is standing at the platform, his three children waving goodbye and Ginny next to him, tears on her face because all three of them are now going. It seems only yesterday they were waving little James off. Harry heard it said way too many times but children do grow up fast.
"Yeah, thanks."
"Good thinking," Harry replies, and when he sees that Ginny is not making any attempts at moving, he grabs some powder himself and walks towards the floo. He looks back at his wife -who's sporting a crease between her lovely eyebrows- and smiles.
"So..." He says, quick to change the subject. "You said something about flying without a broom?"
Harry stares at a crack on the ceiling and wonders how long it’s been there. From where he is resting on the bed, he can see the paint starting to peel towards the bottom half of it. Or maybe it's the top? The paint starting to peel already is a bad sign. He told Ginny they should’ve used muggle paint and damn if he wasn’t right. Magical paint is shit. It was barely three months ago when they repainted the entire house. The
"Is she getting any better?" Ron asks, mouth full. He gets a slap in the head from Hermione for that.
After the meal is over, Harry is helping Molly in the kitchen when Hermione finds him. She takes a cloth and starts drying the pots and pans harry had been scrubbing.
stick it back but that’s hardly a permanent solution. He doesn’t want the whole ceiling paint to fall in one piece.
“I know. I really am sorry. You could ask Ron to come over more often, maybe?”
The way to the forest should be a long one since it looks miles away. However, they do not need more than a handful of steps to find themselves well into it. A trail disappears into the trees so that it's not possible to see its end. However, Harry knows where it leads. He had been in the Forbidden Forest enough times to recognize it. At one point he's pretty sure they walk past the same clearing where eleven-year-old Harry saw Professor Quirrell sucking on a unicorn.
He was always proud of the second or third looks others inevitably gave him when he passed. Today, however, he worried it could jeopardise the mission since he had such a small window of time. He could not cock it up.
“Why steal in the first place, then? To prove you can?”
“Well, Harry, I will keep that in mind, but I do what I want,” Draco shot back. He had always had a comeback ready, but the playfulness of his words was new.
“You ‘don’t know where’-”
“Bristol.”
I can’t bring myself to say the words to explain, so I just leave it at, “We have to find Draco.”  I let them read the note for themselves — or at least, whatever few words are still legible on that parchment.
Draco minded, of course, but he said he didn’t.
thing, which confirmed those moments meant just as much to Harry as they did to him.
Quidditch. He and Harry had played against each other often at Hogwarts. Harry had a natural talent for being a Seeker and, had he wished, could have played professionally. Draco, meanwhile, had worked hard to be a worthy opponent but always played better against Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw when he was less... distracted.
One. Two. Three. Four.
He opened his eyes, seeing a blur of what seemed to be a face topped with blond hair. Draco? How did he get here?
Draco pushed his magic towards that mental image, forging a path between the hotel room he was standing in and the nearby museum. He could feel his body heat, and sweat formed on his brow as he continued deepening and strengthening that connection. He used to hate the squeezing sensation of apparition, but the stretching of this new and exhausting type of transportation was worse. Still, it was the only truly untraceable option.
Harry failed to muffle a groan when Draco’s hand continued its trajectory, tracing over his perineum and finally, circling his rim as an invitation.
Malfoy came back from the loo and settled into the other armchair, his entire frame tense. They needed to have a long conversation alone after this meeting and clear the air. Harry still didn’t agree with Draco’s original decision to face VILE alone, but he understood it.
“Hogwarts is sentient, so I’m not sure why Malfoy Manor couldn’t be.”
He’d always been attracted to Harry and had fantasised about him off and on throughout the years, but meeting as adults changed everything. He could still picture Harry’s crooked smile when he had extended his hand and offered to let bygones be bygones. After agreeing, Harry had taken a casual swig of beer, nodded his chin to indicate Blaise and Neville making out on the couch and asked, “Thoughts?”
But here Potter is,
He fights his instinct to close his eyes, trying to hold onto their connection as long as possible. Even as he sees how utterly destroyed he looks. Even as he feels Draco release inside him. Even as his entire body spasms and his toes curl. Even as their strangled shouts reverberate in his mind.
The next week his palms are sweaty as he enters the parlor. He’s had days to come up with an idea for the design. He’s pored over Dragonology books in Grimmauld Place’s library for ideas and even tried sketching. Embarrassingly, Ron asks why he’s drawing squirrels.
Eventually, I hear more adult voices downstairs — Hermione and Ron.  That means it’s already 5 pm.  I should go downstairs to greet them, but I can’t bring myself to get up.
“Oh, we’re definitely watching,” her wife Pansy said, smirking at him from across the table.
It was difficult for him to get the words out. He and Theo’s friendship had always focused more on their work and interests instead of their emotions. As he confided his love for Harry, Theo’s eyebrows lifted, and his lips twitched.
Reclining on the bed, Harry waves his hand at the window to allow the messenger to come in and drop off the morning paper. Which it does at my feet, along with a small package as it hoots in my face as if to complain before swooping out again.
He had nothing against their former classmate. He just didn’t know him well. When he had asked Blaise why they were dating, he got the unhelpful response, “I have an excellent eye for quality. Pity you don’t have good taste.”
No one else on the task force seemed particularly enthused by Harry’s theory of multiple thieves, but he was intrigued, and it shed a different light on his day’s work.
Draco left one hand on Harry’s hips while the other wrapped around his prick. He stroked roughly over and over.
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up when he came home and had the sense he wasn’t alone. He knew that the Black family home had layers of protections and Dark magic, but given his work... one could never be too careful.
how Hermione usually feels in a bookstore?
He had stopped wondering.
“Help me take off my jeans, then. My hands are sticky.” Harry laughed heartily as he held up his hands, moving off the bed to make it easier for his trousers and pants to slide to the floor.
It’s odd — I’m more nervous than I’d been facing Voldemort. (Not that I’d ever admit
Merlin’s saggy balls… he didn’t just look pathetic. He
“I heard from Meehan, who heard from Robards, that all the tests are coming back saying it’s real.”
“God, Harry… so glad you suggested this.”
“That too.”
“Beautiful.”
“It’s fun — a little messy, and you can talk while you work and drink.”
I want to explain that it’s not like that. I did the only thing I could do. I’m just a bathroom.
“Fine. I am willing to help, but anything illegal is off limits for me. I won’t destroy my career for Malfoy or Zabini. But I’ll talk to Mum about organising a dinner for everyone, and we can see what people think,” Ron relented.
“OY! I’ll arrest you if you try!” Ron retorted indignantly as he walked by.
I wipe my eyes quickly and pick him up.  Regulus Hyperion Potter-Malfoy. He’s the best gift you’ve ever given me.  He’s so little in my lap, and I can’t help but wrap him in my arms, holding him to my chest.  He’s a physical embodiment of our love, and just like how I refuse to let you go, I can’t let him go.
I smile when I see the table—Harry’s left me dessert (chocolate mousse, my favourite) and a note on one of those ingenious Muggle postey notes. His writing is atrocious, cramped and uneven, but my heart flutters in anticipation. He’s such a thoughtful and attentive boyfriend. But as I read the note, my stomach clenches.
Embarrassingly quickly, even though Harry doesn’t seem to mind.  More embarrassing is how he cleans me, forgoing any relief for himself because I’m already dozing off.
“Mm... I am. Now, before we head to the Burrow, I have a gift for you.” Harry grinned and handed over a box with green wrapping paper.
I can’t bring myself to eat breakfast, my stomach churning as the blood pumps through my body, which is gearing up for the inevitable fight. We won’t come to literal blows, but my body is preparing all the same.
“You can keep calling me Potter, or if you want to be more formal, Auror Potter or Mr Potter are also acceptable,” Harry sassed with the best snide tone he could muster, testing the waters.
I love hearing how his mind works: the creativity he has and the connections he makes.  I wonder if I would have been as open and honest as a child if it had been allowed.  Instead, I took etiquette classes on how to act properly.
He looks so small as he pulls himself together. Almost frail. He looks as lost and miserable as he often did as a child, and I feel the need to protect and comfort him.
I remember our first date at a small restaurant in Paris.  It didn’t matter that he had asked me first nor that we were already friends; I needed it to be so impressive that he would wonder what else could top it and agree to a second date.
“Harry, what the… Harry, come here!”
I’m not a writer; I just work in a bookstore. And it isn’t love, not quite. Or, at least, not yet, but there’s definitely affection and attraction and anxiety and a bunch of other words that start with other letters of the alphabet.
“Seems like a wide net.”
When he finally returned to the table, their dessert had arrived. Harry had his spoon poised to take a scoop of the bowl of dark chocolate mousse infused with port wine and mint.
As I go through my morning with Reg, my back hurts.  I have to sit while we pick out clothes, and I brush his hair.  He talks so much, and while sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming, today it’s nice to just listen.
Everyone mostly left him and Harry alone as they went back to their conversations or greeted people as they arrived. People were surprisingly pleasant to him, despite knowing his past. Still, he could not stop himself from self-consciously pulling on his sleeve to make sure it hid the faded Dark Mark.
staring at him from the checkout line. The librarian, who’d been trying to get his attention, finally snapped at him noisily. James blinked and turned back to her with a sheepish grin.
“Ah,” James chuckled awkwardly, stepping out of the strange metal room. The door slid shut behind him. “And you are?”
Draco moved to get up, and the pain returned. He thanked Merlin that he had brought healing potions in case things went sideways. As he turned his back to Harry to walk to the emergency kit, he heard a gasp.
“We’ll only get caught if you do something stup…” Blaise started before Neville interrupted him.
Every Saturday morning, Harry woke up alone.
Logically, the hotel room can’t be as tiny as it feels. But the walls feel like they’re closing in on me as the potential headlines flash through my mind:
One of my favorite parts of the day is “scaring away the monsters.”  Reg insists, and it gives me a chance to shoot a cleaning charm under his bed.  Afterwards, I get to release my frustration by screaming.  Reg joins me, and we always end up giggling.
“If it’s close to here, it can’t be shit. You’re also wearing a lovely suit. Honestly, I never expected based on how you dressed at Hogwarts that you actually have good taste in fabrics and understand tailoring. But, anyway, that suit screams you can afford to treat yourself, and, more importantly,
“We also still don’t know
“No buts.  We love you and need you.  Right, pumpkin?”
“I’m so, so sorry. There’s a bathroom right across the hall.”
Wooden signs hang from brownstone facades. Every building is connected, and many have separate stores on the ground and first floors. There are stairways leading to basement shops, and the occasional sight of a doorbell and keypad indicating entrances to apartments above the storefronts.
Draco enjoyed the casual banter throughout the meal and relaxed as it felt like all the other outings they had been on together, even if those almost always included one or a couple of their friends.
“On that note, I’ve modified my map to include the signatures of the aurors and VILE agents who have shown up so far. That way I can warn you if their magical signatures are near you. Shame we can’t get full visuals,” Blaise pivoted back to the original conversation.
It’s the truth. It’s been the best day of my career, and I’m still basking in the afterglow of endorphins from the match. Not that I’d tell the Muggle that, if he even cared to know.
Draco wondered how Harry seemed so at ease and confident. He, too, wanted to look sexy and composed. Instead, he worried that he looked awkward, squirming to find the best position as he lay back on the bed. As he fidgeted, the bed creaked and the headboard lightly thumped against the wall.
“I couldn’t wish for a better friend than you. You’re my best friend, and I’m so glad we met again after Hogwarts because I can’t imagine my life without our friendship. I never imagined someone doing all of this for me, so thank you for the best birthday ever,” Harry whispered, as though speaking more loudly would disrupt the magic of the moment. He rolled onto his side to face Draco on the massive bed.
I squint. Surely, he has to be joking. But there’s no smirk playing at his lips, just an increasingly annoyed furrow of the brow as the silence continues.
Their tentacled partner pulls them from the still waters near the shore. Neither can contain their moans as their cocks rub together as they are jostled. The friction sends shockwaves of pleasure through Harry’s body. As the water grows more turbulent, his arousal heightens. His anticipation grows. He could come
“This is my next class. See ya, Draco!”
Swirling his hands through the water reminded him of how long it had been since he had left his ex. He mentally calculated: 2 years and 3 months (give or take) of single life. Not that he couldn’t pull, but it was hard to find a suitable match with his job and fame.
Desperation seeped through his entire body. Weren’t Gryffindors all about doing the right thing? Wasn’t Harry?
Draco’s brow furrowed. Did that mean his actions had no real value? That every action he had taken, despite his good intentions, was all for nought?
I beat the chocolate, eggs, and butter like I always do. I used the rich Swiss milk chocolate he picked up last week in Zurich (the one I studiously avoid looking at the price tag of because even if we have vaults too full to use in our lifetimes, there really should be a limit to the cost of a consumable.) But it didn’t taste as good on my tongue because mousse is meant to be shared. And I was alone.
“You went to Paris to get these?”
“Harry, are we really just going to ignore the crimes he’s committed? We took an oath. It’s our bloody job to arrest him. And instead, you’re planning on inducting him into the Order!” Ron ranted.
“You’re doing great, Harry. Next we’ll try the
I can already hear the roar of the crowd. As the home team, the patriotic chants of “USA” drown out the cheers for Britain. I don’t mind. The energy is palpable, and it feels like magic is swirling all around us, rushing through my body as my heart pumps in rhythm with the chants.
It finally registers in my brain: there’s a Compulsion Charm and some other unknown spell at work. I wouldn’t have noticed it if I were a Muggle, but these are
I regret leaving my wand on the bedside table.  If I had it, I could cast a cleaning charm.  I’m too ashamed to look at the floor to see if there are any droplets or a puddle of urine.  I wouldn’t be able to bend down to clean it up the muggle way anyway.
The next week, Harry asks Draco about
I’m devastated to pull myself away from him, but I won’t be able to leave if I stay longer.  I look at him one last time from the doorway, and he gives me a sleepy smile.
His favourite room in the house was the smaller library, which, at least, theoretically was always supposed to be near silent. This library was a magically curated selection of works from the main library, based on the topic you desired when you entered. It was while restoring this room that he and Blaise had discovered the existence of his great-uncle.
“You’re not… disgusted?”
Harry opened the door and gestured for Draco to enter first. The maitre d’ immediately recognised the pair, eyes lighting up as he came over to greet them.
Harry nodded, and Draco refilled the forgotten glass that Harry had used earlier. No change in Harry’s expression.
It was the complete opposite of the pureblood estates he knew. Even when Malfoy Manor had been destroyed, the foundation had been strong. The sprawling estate had been modernised with successive generations, but all additions were made to match the style of the original facade. This house looked like it was held up entirely by magic, with odd angles and some rooms jutting out atop the floor below.
So I wait, grin widening every time he tries to shoot a surreptitious look at me. Oh, I’m
“You can change the colour, I just needed to see your face first. Totally worth it.”
“Draco, please. What’s going on?” Harry asked as he sat down on a wooden bench.
Inhale for four. Hold for four. Exhale for four. Rest for four.
I love almost everything about Draco.
“That you’re gay.”
His eyes focused on Harry at another table, talking animatedly to Marcus. The older wizard was more subdued but was responding with actual words. Draco was used to grunts from his own interactions with Marcus, and he wondered if there was mutual interest.
I’m still hungry afterwards but don’t want to face the crowd downstairs.  I tiptoe through the hall to get the granola bars in the library, cringing as I hear the floors creak under my weight.  It’s impossible to be stealthy when you’re this pregnant.
“I’m glad.” Draco took a swig of his Firewhiskey. He hoped the dim lighting hid his flush; if not, he’d blame it on the alcohol. If Harry noticed, he didn’t comment.
“You coming back Sunday?”
him I’d meet him after.”
His fingers tightened on the glass when the man shamelessly asked Harry if he wanted to dance with a wiggle of his hips as if Draco wasn’t sitting right there.
“So no more dinner dates. You know... Blaise and I really love trying new activities together. We went to a paint night just last week!”
“So... Harry, was it? Welcome to Miami. If you’re interested,
Draco came back to England shortly before Ginny and Pansy’s first date. As their relationship had progressed, he became more accustomed to hanging out with former Gryffindors. Then, he met Harry again at the couple’s housewarming party when Pansy and Ginny moved in together.
“Got it. Wait... LDL?”
I send the note fluttering off to HR and turn my gaze to Harry. I slowly, suggestively, run my hand up his thigh. His eyes darken with anticipation.
Having only dated Muggles since leaving Wizarding Britain, I’d forgotten how much magic could… ease getting down and dirty. (With much less emphasis on the dirty.) How had I ever lived without cleaning and lubrication spells? But Harry had applied them deftly with a lazy wave of his hand.
After the War, Harry had testified on behalf of Draco and his family; then they lost contact for three years while Harry went through auror training and Draco travelled the world to find himself. It was as he’d moved from country to country that he’d fallen in love with trying different cuisines and found his calling.
But they’re together now. It’s been years, but they’re mostly happy now.
My teammate on the Tornadoes, Costa, winks and salutes as he flies past me before they settle to wait for the referee to release the balls.
Blaise’s and Draco's jaws dropped at Neville’s take. He thought that bloody Harry Potter, the Chosen One, and the auror in charge of investigating them would… help? How? This was Draco’s problem with Gryffindors. The idea was reckless.
“Is this Spain?” I ask, and he says yes.
“Seeing as I have the only known Invisibility Cloak, they probably aren’t expecting it,” Harry agreed.
“You.”
“Since we’ve been wasting so much time... is it too early to ask yours or mine?”
When Hermione excused herself to go to the loo, he watched as Charlie's eyes followed her out. Draco was pretty sure Charlie focused on Hermione's arse in particular, but he personally didn't want to think about it too much.
Dad’s head is in the fire to Floo call someone.  He asks about a trip to Spain.  When he finishes up his call, he looks surprised to see me when he turns around.
“You’re looking at him,” Oliver chuckled.
I steal some of kitchen’s energy to turn the sink on. It was a well-intentioned reminder, but instead he looks terrified.
“He might have been a bloody prick, but at least he had good taste when it comes to self-care,” Harry thought wryly while watching the bath bomb fizz. His back relaxed with the release of the lavender scent.
Preferably in the next month or two? Draco stared at the couple. The situation was worse than he had thought: his friends probably had money riding on his success or failure. He debated if he wanted to know who had the least faith in his dating skills. Or was it just a lack of faith in Harry’s ability to see the obvious?
his housemate. Then again, he wasn’t interested in Pansy now… or back then.
As I walk back to our home, my head starts to throb, and the light hurts my eyes.
I hug him tightly.  He smells like his toothpaste — strawberry because he hates mint.
I’ve known Master Malfoy since he was little and couldn’t reach the sink without a stepping stool. I’ve seen him grow up, go to school, then move out. The years without him were lonely. I thought we, Malfoy Manor, were dying then. Losing our sentience as our humans dwindled and disappeared. As the love of a family disappeared. But he came back and brought Master Potter, and WE came back, as well.
“I’ve been to Seville before, so even though it’d be easier with a Portkey and is a bit far, I could Side-Along Harry. Even if they’re expecting me, they wouldn’t be expecting two people,” Draco theorised.
It was only later when Harry slipped in during the dead of night and asked how the interrogation had gone that Draco knew for sure why the worst Aurors in the department had been assigned to him.
The realization hits, and it’s more painful than the migraine that was splitting my skull open earlier.  Without me in the picture, they could have a normal life.  Reg might grow to hate me even more, but it would be for the best.
I can’t wait anymore.
“Li won’t actually come in,” I try to reassure him. “Look, I’ll be right back.”
Harry blinked rapidly at Granger’s question as if trying to force himself out of a daze. “Um…”
Draco looked up from his Potions essay as someone else set their books down on the table. Granger. Merlin, he was done for.
Draco smirked to himself, bringing a piece of toast up to his mouth to hide his face. It wouldn’t be his voice, he’d made sure of it—the spell to disguise his voice had been one of the easier ones to figure out, in the grand scheme of things. His own voice, which he liked to think of as somewhat distinctive, would be replaced with a voice impossible to identify.
And sure enough, Weasley grimaced but stomped his way over and sat down between Hermione and Draco. Which, of course, left the only spot for Harry right next to Draco. Dear Merlin, this would not be good for his heart.
As he was learning, though, causing a stir without being the center of attention was just as fulfilling, if not more so. To be honest, Draco was tired of putting on a show for whoever was watching, acting like he was expected to instead of how he wanted to. It was bloody annoying in the best of times, exhausting and dehumanizing at the worst. But this latest scheme of his—now, that was the real him. Draco took great satisfaction in ignoring his father’s voice in his head that told him things like
Weasley cackled delightedly. “Merlin, someone’s flirting game is top notch today.” He scanned the room. “I know everyone is listening, so if you’re the one sending these messages, send a hint in your next letter, will you? Or at least tell how you did the spellwork, I’m sure George would love to get his hands on this. Whatever it is, it’s bloody brilliant!”
Draco pulled back, partly out of shock and partly out of the need to look at Harry’s face to make sure he wasn’t joking. “I—you—what?”
“No, don’t be sorry,” said Harry, squeezing him harder. Draco was suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of Harry’s scent, and Merlin, that made it hard to think. His mind was going in circles, still unable to fully comprehend what was going on. “I’m so glad it was you.”
“Well, why didn’t you say anything sooner?”
“Point taken,” Harry said, dragging a hand through his hair bashfully. Draco noticed that Harry’s hair was still kinked from the braids Draco had given him yesterday, taking a page from Luna’s book. “I guess I’m the idiot.”
“So,” she said.
There was a warm hand under his chin, and suddenly Draco was no longer looking down at the table, but rather up into Harry’s searching eyes. His eyes were alight with something, but Draco didn’t think it was anger. Still, he couldn’t help but flinch at the intensity of Harry’s gaze.
“She had some theories about the spellwork on your mystery Howlers that she wanted to run by me.” He risked a glance up at Harry’s face. “You don’t have any ideas who it is, do you?”
In the grand scheme of things, being on the sidelines wasn’t too bad. Draco had expected to be hated, stomped all over and spat upon by those who felt he owed them reparations for his part in the war. But as bitter as people were, he seemed to have escaped their derision; perhaps there had been an unspoken agreement in the Wizarding World to let bygones be bygones and not start more decades of pointless fighting.
“We were just discussing some Charms theory, would you like to join us?”
Draco swallowed, not sure he wanted to hear the answer, but asked, “Is there anyone you would like it to be?”
Hermione had a pensive look on her face. “Hence the turn of events at the Manor, I suppose, and the wand during the final battle…”
“Well, yes…It was a stupid crush at first, of course, but by then, well, I—I loved him. I couldn’t—” Draco swallowed a sudden sob. He’d always been prone to mood swings, but even more so since the war. And with his feelings for Harry thrown into the mix, he was a disaster. The Mind Healer he had seen over the summer liked the phrase “emotional fragility due to an unstable environment during childhood.” Draco preferred “messed up,” euphemisms be damned. “I couldn’t see him die, even if it meant getting tortured or killed. He deserved so much more than what he got.”
Draco scoffed again, but both his heart and his mind were racing with thoughts of Harry. “If you say so.”
Ever since the rather embarrassing incident in the Common Room, Harry had been popping up where Draco least expected it and sprouting all these weird facts in order to start a conversation. For the first few days, Draco had jumped each time Harry came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder, but now, Draco was used to the fact that Harry would appear to walk him to class or drag him off to the kitchens for an afternoon treacle tart snack, rambling about some muggles tried to use pigeons just like wizards used owls.
Draco watched the other side of the Great Hall furtively, doing his best to appear completely absorbed in his breakfast. But that was hard to do, especially when he saw the school owl he had chosen the night before make its way towards the Gryffindor table.
Hermione had sent Draco a sorrowful glance when Harry repeated the contents of the message aloud, but Draco just looked away. He didn’t deserve her pity for this; he had gotten himself into this deplorable situation all on his own, and he deserved whatever suffering that brought him.
It was Harry’s turn to look away and hide his face, but Draco could still see the pink tips of his ears. “Maybe. Secret.”
So here Draco was, sitting in his usual breakfast spot with a sense of dread building in his stomach. There was no way he could actually eat his breakfast, not like this. But he had appearances to keep. It wouldn’t do to have anyone getting suspicious of him now. Besides, he wanted—no, he needed to see Harry’s reaction, no matter how much it hurt.
“I’ll go with you. Night, all!” Draco’s pride swelled as Harry also moved to leave, waving away the good-natured grumbling of those gathered.
and the design, he hasn’t thought about the placement or the size. The words “just like Charlie’s” are on the tip of his tongue, but Charlie’s ink is
I can’t believe Harry convinced me to let our children use my last name.  He said that we should start a new chapter for the Malfoy lineage.  I felt honored at the time.  Now I know: the Malfoy name should have died with me.  Even having the Chosen One as their father can’t erase the contamination of my name, of my past... of
“Rival athletes to gym buddies to lovers. This story is heartwarming, sweet, and sure to make you crave a smoothie! This mlm romance explores themes of sexuality, masculinity, and mental health.”
He shook off the thought of Las Vegas — if he and Harry were to wed someday, he wanted it to be a momentous occasion and not a drunken decision. For Harry’s sake. He was tempted, though.
“So did I. On a broom, I can focus singularly on the Snitch, and everything else falls away. It doesn’t help others, but it helps me.”
Taking in the surrounding room, I realize it’s a luxury suite with period furnishings. The low hum and faint bustle below is from a city waking up. The birds chirping in the trees on the Common, angry Boston drivers honking their horns as they slowly crawl to their destinations, and I can imagine the loud swears of pedestrians yelling at those same drivers as they cross the street. Or maybe barely audible on the street below would be the steady rumble of the Green Line underground.
“Happy Christmas, Malfoy! Lemme know if you can stop by the shop to try out some of the stuff in the coat. There’s even a modified tranquiliser gun in there! Or... we could try it out on ickle Ronniekins later...” George greeted.
Light tears turn into loud sobs that wrack through my body.  I put my fist to my mouth so Reg can’t hear me.  I don’t want him to see me like this.  I can’t let him see me like this.
“I’m glad we got to start over. Meet for the first time again long after Madam Malkin’s.” Harry’s voice was muffled by his hands as he continued to squat and made no effort to stand up.
I still see them at their worst. Sometimes it’s tears, like the heartbroken Master Malfoy of before, but usually it’s something more… dirty, and not in a fun way. To be perfectly honest, I’ve seen a lot of shit.
While Harry was gone, Draco tossed back the rest of his wine to find the courage to make up for his
“Hey!” Harry strolled into Draco’s flat with the usual morning coffee and pastries, putting them down on the counter. He then came over to the blond to give him a light kiss before throwing himself down on the couch next to Draco, as he always did now.
It’s another one of
the sex! How is it that we can’t even make time for our anniversary?” My words lose their heat as I say them because I never should have written those words on that post-it. I’m the one who put that scared and furious look in his eye and heaped on yet another stressor. “I just… need you too, Draco.”
I wonder where he’s gone and if he’s safe.
I kiss his forehead, and I can taste the salt from my tears on my lips.  I look back down at his confused face.  He’s probably scared and has no idea what’s going on.
“I told you, I’m celebrating.”
Harry comes into the loo and pulls me into his arms, and I bask in his warmth and lean on his sturdy frame.  He knows that I just need quiet and his presence.
amiably talking together.
Neville, at least, appeared sympathetic, although his pitying glances and murmured words of encouragement made Draco feel even more self-conscious.
And just like that, I feel like I’ve been transported back to the halls of Hogwarts, as a teenager unable to understand why I just didn’t want Pansy the same way I wanted
I finally drag myself up the stairs to our bedroom.  I curl up on his side of the bed and inhale the scent of his aftershave on his pillow.
“How much time would that take?”
In the morning, I love how he looks deliciously rumpled in his silk pajamas with his sleep mask pushed up onto his forehead mussing his platinum hair.
Except he wasn’t smiling last night, and I might never see that smile again.
He needed to get the diadem before VILE did, or it would be lost forever.
his eyes on me as he takes another casual sip of our overpriced wine.
“Your hair is the same shade as your cousin’s favorite. Teddy Lupin. He’s my godson, y’know. And a Metamorphagus. Your mother and Andromeda have been taking care of him.”
be serious!” Malfoy interrupted as he stood up, terror in his eyes. Blaise said nothing, but Harry glanced at him quickly and could see that his knuckles were white as they sank into the sofa below him. Neville’s hand moved to fully cover his.
He savoured the melange of flavours on his tongue, especially the earthiness of the roasted beets. The vegetables were high quality and harvested at peak ripeness.
“What’s that glow coming from over there?” a guard asked his colleague.
Over the next few days, the both of them were too busy with classes and orientation to talk much. On Thursday afternoon, Draco saw him in the library. He looked up from his physiology textbook to see Harr-
needed a shag.
“How do you know he doesn’t hate me? Has he told you?” Draco asked. He hated himself the minute the words left his lips because he saw realisation dawn on Blaise’s face.
Draco winced. He had chosen Capucine
“I’d rather just get takeaway on our way home from work.” He flashes me a look that’s hopeful, but afraid to be turned down (yet again). My chest tightens at the obvious pain in those bright green eyes, and it’s even worse knowing I put it there, no matter how busy things have been lately.
Harry splutters as his head bobs above the surface, pushing his black fringe away from his face, only to be splashed again as Draco slips in.
Draco picks up the wine bottle and slams it down right next to my glass before stalking off to help other customers again.
I stand in front of the toilet, with the faint pressure of my headache returning.  I try to focus as I fumble for my prick to relieve my bladder.  I can’t even see what I’m doing with my belly in the way.  I can’t tell if I’m making a mess.  I can only listen for the sound of the stream hitting porcelain.

unattractive.
James was the one to deepen the kiss first, wrapping one arm around Draco to pull him closer and bringing his other hand up to bury into his hair. He tilted his head so that their mouths slanted together and Draco moaned, “Harry.”
“We should limit the first trip to 5 minutes to be safe. We can’t risk the hat losing its power. It’s really a shame that only one adult can fit under the cloak—we used to fit three back as first years,” Harry sighed and rubbed his hands over his face as he always did when stressed. Knowing that Draco had visited the city before brought Harry comfort, despite his misgivings.
“Malfoy, don’t mess with me.” Harry’s frown was back, and his brows knit together with anger. “I’ve read all the reports hundreds of times. I’m giving you one chance and if you lie… that’s it.”
Four masked figures in black robes appeared with the telltale crack of apparition. Harry’s heart raced. The masks were not the same as the Death Eaters had worn, but the similarities were too close to be a coincidence.

“At the Manor,” Draco’s words come out clipped and posh as always, as though this is just something he
Merlin knows I’ve never wanted fame and have had too much of it my entire life, but I just expected him to… know. He followed Quidditch in school (cheering for the Tornadoes, which is now
“It’s perfect for this heat. Try it!”
An unknown owl dropped a letter in the middle of the ledger he was working in, then looped around to rest on the windowsill. He eyed the ivory envelope suspiciously, battering it with all the Dark magic detection spells he knew. After the war, he had received countless death threats (and a couple of unhinged marriage proposals), but they had mostly died down. The owl hooted as if insulted on behalf of its owner at the barrage of spells.
He had thought nothing in the wedding could surpass the colourful venue and the beauty of the floral arrangements, but the headpiece did. The headpiece he was here to protect instead of fantasising in the audience like a horny teenager.
Even though Draco recognised it was unfair, he wanted to mope and shut out the happy couple next to him. He felt even worse when Neville tried to comfort him. (Of course, his best friend — the wanker — once again found the situation absurd and hilarious).
“HARRY! HERMIONE! WE’RE HERE!” Ron bellowed from the floor below.
“Does it have to be so... red?” Draco complained, a little mollified by the explanation and unsure what the appropriate reaction was to a practical but hideous gift from a boyfriend.
My hand itches to confirm that it’s really him. That this is real, tangible, a night to remember. I want to reach out and run my hand through his hair, mussed from sleep and from being pulled tightly last night.
“I’ll show you the contract between my grandfather and the museum to loan it. If you can’t believe me, trust Neville. He suggested we tell you from the start. And…”
That settled it: Draco would take Harry to Florida.
Harry dutifully followed the instructions: he went home, bathed, had a nice wank, and went to the shops.
I’d nearly lost a finger to a Crup, been too embarrassed to be a Dom, and while I enjoyed visiting Charlie at the Dragon Sanctuary, it was too remote.
“Yeah. Are you?”
How much has Draco Malfoy changed in ten years? I’m desperate to know. If a wizard who’d barely stepped foot out of the Wizarding world until he was seventeen has managed to survive as a Muggle, then surely there are more changes, deeper changes, than the ones I’ve seen.
“Wait, Draco,” Harry whispered, “when you said you ‘met at a gallery’... you didn’t mean the Tate Modern, right?”
He looked into Harry’s eyes, and Harry nodded, a mirror of their first interaction earlier that evening.
He passed out.
He didn’t know if he had a chance at anything more than friendship. They had flirted at the wedding, but a lot had changed since then. It definitely was not the right time to start anything serious, but would a casual relationship cause more problems? Draco didn’t think any relationship with Harry could be casual given their history, anyway.
“I’ll be back.” Neville squeezed his shoulder and left with the woman. He watched as they let their bodies speak for them, and he craved the intimacy of that interaction. It wasn’t intimacy in the sexual sense, as he knew Neville had his boyfriend at home, but it was still sensual to an observer. It was a completely new side to Neville.
“…ry, it’s Neville. Hear him out,” a voice came through.
He heard about the incident, even though I thought I was careful when I mentioned it to Ron and Hermione.  I wonder if I could have been better about reassuring him last night because I did see the signs that he’d been crying, and I did nothing.  I wonder if I missed some other indication that he was unhappy because I thought it was just pregnancy stress and hormones.
“Bloody hell… fine… I’ll call you Pascal,” he gritted his teeth.
Harry looks over at the disbelieving tone — it’s the squirrel dragon doodle. Face burning scarlet as his Auror robes, Harry flips the parchment over to a stylized Hungarian Horntail with outstretched wings — a nod to the Triwizard Tournament.
“It’s nice to spend time with just the two of us,” he commented when there was a lull in the conversation after their main course came out.
“Thanks. So do you.”
, so you don’t just dance and go home with anyone.”
“Any new leads?” Harry asked the team.
He saw a playful gleam in Harry’s eyes. Harry coated his fingers liberally, then used his hand to cover what his mouth didn’t, furthering Draco’s sensation of being engulfed by warmth.
I pull the stack of letters out from the drawer of my bedside table, measuring the weight of the paper in my hands. His dogged pursuit, even if I’ve shied away, only offering scraps of responses along the way because I don’t know how to put words to the feelings I have.
I dim the lights twice and he stops cackling and stills. “You can hear me?”
“Not a fan?”
Not a Quidditch star.
“I could get used to this,” Harry murmured, and Blaise shot him a warning look for not paying attention and interrupting. Draco squeezed his hand tightly.
“Hi Draco, and is that... Harry Potter? I’ll introduce you to the team.” Draco’s former captain waved and walked over. Draco turned to peer over his shoulder at the mention of Harry.
Living in Boston, a city whose tourism industry mainly revolves around defeating the British back in the 1700s, it’s a question I’ve asked myself before. It’s not uncommon to walk around downtown, unintentionally along the Freedom Trail, and see historical re-enactors, coffee to-go cups in hand as they stroll around in red coats, prepared to surrender. There’s a whole museum literally devoted to dumping tea in the harbor. Which, honestly, is such a waste of perfectly good tea. Because tourists still actually do it, even though it’s littering and illegal.
“Have you asked Reg for help or about places Draco’s mentioned?  If something was on his mind, he might have let it slip without realizing.”
“Pascal.”
.  He cried the first time he saw the scars on my chest, and I couldn’t find the words to express that I’ve never blamed him because I would have done the same back then.
The explosions thoroughly absorbed his attention, even if he didn’t understand all the technology that caused them. He had grown up believing that wizards could easily defeat Muggles, but clearly, Muggles had their own ways of being destructive.
I had been greedy, letting myself accept Harry’s love and falling in love with him.  I knew I didn’t deserve him, and I still don’t, but I took advantage of his kindness and his heart.
I leave.
Apparently, the Malfoy ancestral wealth meant he still
They walked for five minutes without saying anything. It was a companionable silence following the exhaustive planning of the preceding hours.
He and Harry had formed a tentative friendship after that walk in Muggle London. He and Blaise had even been extended visiting privileges at the Black family home where Harry lived, and they often would all meet up in the evenings to research and eat takeaway. If Draco visited a bit more often than the others, he told himself it was because he had the most flexible hours since he didn’t have a traditional job.
He eyed the potion warily, not concerned for himself, but concerned that the Aurors might ask him questions that would make him reveal… it would be horrible. Destroy
“Harry!  What happened?  Is it Draco? Is it the baby?” Narcissa is beside herself as she rushes into the room from the fireplace.  Lucius is quiet, but he’s as agitated as his wife.
Despite their strong friendship, it had taken time for the two to get used to being in constant communication. Once, Blaise had forgotten to turn his earpiece off, and there were some things Draco never needed or wanted to know about his best friend. He shuddered and triple-checked his was off.
After the practice with the Magpies, Draco brooded at home before deciding to make one last attempt to win Harry over.
“Oh! So sorry to run, but look at the time! Right, Gin?” Pansy grinned as she tugged on her wife’s sleeve. Draco knew the smile meant they were leaving to give him “privacy,” but really would spy on the table from outside the restaurant.
The former Slytherins looked equally deflated, and the room fell silent beyond the crackling of the fire. Neville looked thoughtful and was the first to recover.
“Have you talked to Kingsley?” He asked finally.
“But the things are used!”
The team went to a nearby pub afterwards, and he learned just how much Quidditch players could drink. The first string Keeper winked and cheekily informed him it was only when someone else was paying.
“So fucking full.” A rare intelligible phrase in Harry’s babbling.
Draco didn’t need a mirror to know that he also must look like a madman, high on adrenaline.
I finally get to our flat.  It takes me multiple tries to get the key in the door.
“Malfoy, it’s nice to see you. I don’t know if you remember him, but this is my fiancé, Viktor Krum.”
I sometimes miss the times when we slept through the entire night without him telling me that our child is pushing on his bladder or having Reg come in after a nightmare.  But I wouldn’t trade our children for anything.
Draco blushed and wondered if it was true or just part of the restaurant’s gimmick.
After trying two meals, Draco couldn’t wait to see if the dessert would top the entrees. A mix of red and green would be brown — chocolate, maybe?
Since everything was unfamiliar, Harry insisted on exploring Muggle Rio and using a taxi to get to Ipanema. He had exchanged money earlier, but with the communication barrier, he could only hold out a handful of colourful bills and expect the driver to choose the right amount. He hoped they didn’t get ripped off.
Draco gently grasped his chin to drag Harry’s attention away from the sunset. Grey eyes stared down into his.
’d come over. The exact words used were:
We don’t have to wait long. Master Potter immediately reaches for his partner, giving the protective comfort that I couldn’t.
“Well, Malfoy and Zabini, seeing that Harry has the only Invisibility Cloak in the world and disillusion charms would be noticed or are prevented, how’d you do it?” As always, George was available to dispel tension.
My hands shake a little as I take it. I know I’ve worked hard to get where I am, but it still feels like the honor should have gone to someone else. Even though it weighs practically nothing, I can always feel the constriction of the band, and the pressure to bring out the best in myself and in my teammates.
“Why’d you choose those colours? What do they represent?” he asked, wishing he could just take a peek inside his crush’s head.
Harry was not the one-night-stand guy, nor the guy who usually shagged on the first date. He had always felt vulnerable exploring his sexuality, exposing his body to others, and trusting them to take care of him. He overanalyzed everything in bed, and nights often ended with him unsatisfied, even if he’d come.
Britain do?
Draco pulled his trousers down, then grasped Harry’s legs to pull them over his arms so the head of his cock would brush the rim, stretched and leaking from the previous spells.
Blaise shot him a quizzical look while Harry rose to his feet and took the American’s hand. Draco wished he’d dared to ask Harry first. There was no way Harry would go home with some random American Muggle, right?
I only wake up again when my alarm goes off.  Harry’s already at work.
If not for the reference to yesterday, I’d think it was a trap and that he was kidnapped and forced to write it.  That he didn’t mean any of the heartbreaking words written.  That he knows his worth.
“Then they should have fucking worked with us, not against us,” Lewis stated coldly, and the rest nodded in agreement.
Before his mind could process it, he heard a groan of pain, and then came a stretching sensation.
“We should’ve rescheduled if everyone was so busy. This wine is bloody good, by the way, so thanks. Cheers!” Harry toasted.
“I like you too, you know. I didn’t say it earlier, but I do.”
“For Britain!” I cry out, turning to face my teammates with the grin that’s been on my lips for the entire tournament.
get an invitation to almost any exclusive event, even on short notice. The Malfoy name had lost its luster in the war, but money talks.
like him, too. Their resemblance was difficult to ignore. He tried to think of a question that wouldn’t be too strange. “Where are you from, anyway?”
The auror stood up too, picking up his wand and running a field diagnostic spell and a few first aid charms he must have learned in training. He lightly ran his hands down Draco’s back, checking for sore spots and any bleeding, but the wound had clotted and dried during their discussion. His ministrations were practised, efficient, and Draco tried not to think about how those hands would feel in an alternate universe where he didn’t get caught.
Draco couldn’t help it - he closed his book and followed after James as he left the library.
The time finally came for Hermione, designated by her professional experience in arguing, to make their case. She had brought a Muggle binder full of notes to answer questions on the spot with evidence. Their preparation paid off as even Kingsley, who had the most thorough and difficult questions, eventually nodded his assent.
Harry could understand the foreigner’s perspective, but he remembered the Ministry refusing to believe him that Voldemort was back. The Ministry didn’t even take a stand against the Death Eaters until it was clear who would prevail. Kingsley had made significant reforms, but the bureaucratic culture was hard to change.
I won’t give empty promises, and I don’t want to hear his.
Pansy then had the gall to complain about taking an international Portkey because it was “rough on her delicate constitution.” (Draco had tried not to snort when he’d heard
“Fuck. Harry. Fuck. Wait.”
He had few people he trusted, but he wanted to trust Harry Potter. It was a new feeling, seeing as he only trusted Blaise because of 20 years of friendship. He trusted Neville only as an extension of that trust. Harry had hated him, fought with him, even accidentally nearly killed him. Even then, he had always been honest.
Hermione stood in front of the mantel with a friendly smile. As she often did in school, she had a smudge of black ink on her cheek, as though she had just been hard at work on an essay.
Maybe, for one night, I can have what my seventeen-year-old self only dreamed about.
She spoke in broken English, and Harry used his Muggle credit card to pay, frustrated at the paper trail it would leave, but there was no way to exchange his pounds to euros otherwise. He hoped this trip was worth it.
The entire day he marvelled at the closeness of the siblings. Being an only child, his parents had doted exclusively on him. He didn’t know how to follow the casual banter or the retellings of stories from decades before.
And these two Aurors looked like they’d be making use of it.
Fortunately, we gain an early lead. We’ve been playing well throughout the tournament, and it shows. I scan the stands near where I know Hermione and Ron are sitting, even if they’re too far away for me to see the details of their faces. They can’t stay for the night, but just knowing my family is there, cheering me on, helps.
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry blushed, and Pansy victoriously took the offending article of clothing to show her wife “what an utter twit Harry is.”
“Pardon?”
Harry understood his superior’s logic, but he still doubted. He didn’t know if he should trust his instinct or the instinct and experience of four colleagues.
And since it’s already 11:30 PM on a Tuesday and Draco still hasn’t returned from the Manor, I’ll be heading to bed alone. Again.
This morning, despite being a Saturday, his partner was there when he woke up, blond brows furrowed. A warm hand rested over the famous lightning bolt scar.
“Excuse us, Draco, Harry,” Hermione stated before pulling on her fiancé’s arm to lead him elsewhere. Draco looked in her general direction to acknowledge her words, but his gaze was drawn back to those emerald eyes.
Hermione shifted uncomfortably at her true plan being exposed. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration, pushing up his glasses towards his forehead. Ron could be dense with emotions but was always surprisingly good with strategy. They should have known he would catch on and see two moves ahead, as he did with chess.
“Any new wizards in your life?”
How stupid had I sounded then? Why didn’t he say anything?
The rapping on the door couldn’t come at a worse time.
“Someone’s eager, huh?” Draco laughed, running his tongue around Harry’s flat brown nipple, causing him to arch up into the touch. Draco ground his cock against the erection in Harry’s trousers.
Harry let out an audible moan of pleasure as he lowered himself into the water. Letting his head fall back, he actively focused on releasing the tension in his muscles. His back had been hunched over a desk for too long.
“Daddy and I looked everywhere for you because we love you.  Daddy’s lost now and because we love him, we need to find him.”
“You gave back the Salem Ring and scarab beetle amulet. Why?”
Harry vanished it. Draco groaned, seeing the wiry curls of hair smattered over Harry’s well-defined chest. He ran his fingers over the muscles, watching as Harry’s abdomen contracted at the touch.
“Is that Daddy’s trail?”
Draco’s heart sped up when he looked beyond her and saw Potter next to Krum. He stared. Potter stared back, eyes widened. Did he imagine it, or did Potter’s cheeks redden? When they were younger, Potter’s face would flush with anger when they saw each other. In Draco’s immaturity, he would needle Potter to provoke that very reaction because then at least he knew Potter was thinking of him. It was revenge for making him feel like a total git.
But no.
“New place in Slater?”
Draco’s eyes slid to Harry’s face, looking for any reaction to the word “relationship” instead of “friendship,” but there wasn’t one. No eyes widening in surprise, no upturn of the lips in excitement, and no frown of disapproval. Nothing.
“Pot— Harry, I’m not sure…”
After every match, our coach spends the next day reviewing every move made, analyzing for flaws and missed opportunities. Most of the time, I appreciate his meticulous methods, but I’d really thought the high of finally winning the World Cup would have given me a reprieve.
Both bride and family member were incapacitated and knocked to the ground before they could scream. Before one of the thieves could bend down and snatch the diadem, an invisible force grabbed it, and it hurtled towards Harry.
“Thank Merlin you’re already at Grimmauld Place. It looks like there’ll be a heist in the morning in Seville: a relic in the cathedral. It’s where Christopher Columbus is buried, so there’s significance for Muggles. We won’t have much time to scope out the site and develop a plan of attack first.”
I’m nearly lost in my thoughts again when Reg asks, “Where’s Daddy?”
“Yeah. Still on for dinner on Wednesday?”
? With a
“You came to ask for romantic advice from your single friend,” he dryly interrupted Draco’s explanation.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, let me bring you another.”
Time stands still as I let my eyes rove over his body, finding it both familiar and new. Not only is he wearing Muggle clothes, but it’s a tight t-shirt and jeans. Beyond the long teal hair up in a messy bun, tattoos cover his arms. Is the Dark Mark still there, hidden amongst the black ink, or is it long gone?
We know things, but can’t speak. That’s also why I can’t tell Master Malfoy that Master Potter has a tail now that both were seemingly too preoccupied to notice.
“Want to try a bite? I love it, but I’m not stupid enough to blunder through explaining flavours to a food critic.”
“Nope. I fly on a broom for national glory. I mean, why did you end up here?”
No way.
During the day, I love how he’s my Auror partner, with the highest solve rate in the Department thanks to his meticulous note taking (always written in dark green ink with flourishes on the Ds, Fs, and the Ts). We never talk about our personal life at work. It works better that way, I think.
If I were to report his disappearance to the Aurors, there’s a chance the press could catch wind of it and write a scathing story about a Death Eater abandoning his child.  They did so once already when Draco went on a promotional trip abroad for his book.
“Just a preview. I have champagne for after the festivities at the Burrow,” he whispered and pecked Harry’s lips before straightening and getting up to grab his coffee.
Draco had only ever used magic on others or on himself for this step. The intimacy of moving slowly, building the anticipation, letting a finger curl against the inner walls, was new. Instead of a hurdle to overcome, preparation felt like an adventure. Draco could twitch his fingers to unlock sounds and reactions. After Harry’s iron control earlier, Draco found each gasp, moan, and shiver precious. He thrived on them.
“Look, mate, I want you to get with Harry soon. I really do. Preferably in the next month or two.” Blaise clutched his sides as he spoke while trying to regain his breath, and his boyfriend gently cuffed him on the back of the head.
Not that I need the drink at this point. I’d take
The trio always met Tuesday mornings at the same café so he could sate his caffeine needs, even though Ginny always claimed he was a heathen for not ordering tea. Once in a while, Harry joined them, but usually, it was just Draco third-wheeling the couple. Would that change if he and Harry started dating? Would they have double dates instead?
Draco’s more compact body provided less wind resistance and, at a certain point, it wasn’t a question of skill. A muscular body pushed hard against him, trying to knock him off his trajectory, but it was too late. His fingers stretched out just a little farther than Harry’s and closed around the flying ball.
As the Seeker, I take to the air last. I push off the ground firmly, my broom shooting straight up before I warm up with barrel rolls. I’ve never understood the need to show off with stupid tricks, but management
Draco sat with his hands propping him up beyond him, and Harry kept his hands in his lap, trying to hide his nerves. He leaned into the bare shoulder of the man next to him, enjoying his solidity and warmth.
With those words, Draco spiralled into despair. All of his friends (except oblivious Harry) told him that he was over dramatic as he sat in his flat, curled up in blankets, eating chocolates, and proclaiming that he’d be single forever. He had spent years gathering up courage, then months of extensive planning, and literally tens of thousands of Galleons in his attempts to woo Harry.
“In sixth year, you found me crying next to the lake when I couldn’t find Trevor anymore. You told me that while no one could replace him, you would help me pick out an owl and offered ‘Rovert’ as a name.”
“They were
I wonder if Draco will notice the difference.
“Let’s go!  I miss Daddy and he’s probably scared without us!” I grab his hand like we do when we go on adventures and when we cross the street.
“I’m fine.”
“What do you recommend, Draco?” Harry asked, not even glancing at the wine list. Draco took pride in how his friend deferred immediately to his expertise.
I want to cry all over again at his words.  I love how Draco, who always masked his true feelings with layers of insults and arrogance as a child, became a father who pushes for open communication of emotions.  I asked him once about it, and he said that our son would only really understand happiness and right from wrong if he understood that all feelings are acceptable, even anger and sadness.
Harry blinked. “
We walk towards the water, and Dad uses a spell that swirls gold and shows footprints heading in the same direction as we are.
“I am a super thief who has international escapades.” Blaise’s voice started coming into the blond’s ear with a hint of static. “Sorry for the delay, but I guess it’s too late to warn you that Potter is right next to y – Nev, mmm… stop that…” Draco wished he could berate Blaise for being a shit partner out loud. The string of curses he suppressed would impress any sailor.
“Well, there has to be a catch. I told you they’re fucking playing us,” Lewis added. His partner nodded.
He had found evidence that there were also unaccounted for wizards at the scenes in London and Paris. Curiously, London aurors never reported the signature glow as the protection charms broke. Had Red Hat (as many aurors had taken to calling the thief) not been present at the first scene?
“What makes you think it’s posh?”
I finally see a good opportunity to talk, as Hermione suggested, about places Draco might have mentioned lately.
“No, this is all me. All
I’m astounded. How do I respond to that?
True to his word, Draco arranges everything for Harry’s birthday. Anticipation sizzles over Harry’s skin as they stand on the shore of the Black Lake. Stark naked.
“He’s really changed. So has Draco. It’s been about five months. Sorry for not telling sooner,” Neville blushed.
on this new life. Perched on a high top chair, Harry Potter looks deliciously rumpled as he sips his wine. His hair is unruly as ever. Stylish blue acetate frames have replaced ill-fitting round glasses, and he is wearing an expensive navy wool suit that clings to his body in a way only adequate tailoring can achieve.
All I can do is coach Draco through square breathing, counting off the rounds of four steadily. I’ve learned a thing or two over the years of visits with Mind Healers unpacking trauma, painful memory by painful memory, but I’ve never helped someone else with those same techniques.
“I go to estate sales.”
Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak and reached out to squeeze Draco’s arm. Draco wore the red coat and used a partial transfiguration charm on his face to hide his features. They had decided it would be too difficult for both of them to be invisible and move together for the first visit.
It’s true. We haven’t made love in a while. It’s not that I haven’t wanted to. It’s just that I’m tired. And never home. I feel as though pulled in a multitude of directions, and there’s not enough of me to go around. Right now, my family and friends need me. Father is ill (he was never quite the same after Azkaban) and Mother needs my support. Pansy’s going through a rough breakup, and next week is Vince’s birthday, which is always hard for Greg.
“Then it’s fine. I won’t even ask you to come watch me play. That doesn’t matter to me. Wait… fuck… let me be clear: you’re more than welcome to come, but it’s fine if you don’t want to.”
The last three years have been amazing. We’re brilliant as Auror Partners, and at home there’s nothing I love more than sharing a meal (Harry’s an amazing cook) and then curling up by the fire together to catch up on reading. But lately there’s been less time for that.
“What are you in the mood for?”
He regretted it as soon as he saw the smug look of victory on Harry’s face.
When he asked, Harry’s eyes had lit up as he replied, “It’s a date.”
“I love you, too.”
“Baby, please,” Harry tried pleading with him a little louder, yanking the blankets away in time with his words.
Silver eyes met green again, narrowing skeptically to consider their options. “The American kind? Like the ones we had at that lumjohn pub in California on our honeymoon?”
If it had been any other year, Malfoy would have had his wand drawn and pointed aggressively at Harry’s neck by now. As it was, the blond looked too bloody knackered to be arsed to do anything about the golden boy’s presence in his precious social bubble. He didn’t signal Crabbe or Goyle to respond to Harry either. He looked indifferent which, for some unearthly reason, pissed Harry off to no end.
“Let….me…..see….your….chart,” Harry said again, slower this time in a perfect imitation of Draco’s own appalling manners. “If you’re a good match for Tracey then you’re probably a good match for me as well.”
Harry blinked blankly a few times before speaking again, “Wait a minute, I have to go through the charts of all of the girls and all of the boys to make my list? That’s…That’s double the work!”
Ron looked beseechingly to the sky. “Merlin help me.”
“Tell me, Potter,” Malfoy sneered halfheartedly, “does the Weasel always have to tell you rudimentary things that we have known all our lives?”
Pansy and Tracey gasped in unison at his language. Crabbe, true to his reputation as the dumber of the two henchman, actually responded to his rhetorical jibe, “Draco and us would never work out. Greg and I are Cancers. He’s a Gemini. ”
Harry peeled Draco’s arms off his waist and pushed him towards the bathroom, “Go shower, you sneaky bastard.”
Ron shrugged, “Our ascendents don’t match, mate. You should look for a Sagittarius, Aries or Aquarius ascendent. If you want to look that deeply at all. There’s more to compatibility than your star chart.”
“Yes, but —”
“Bloody hell. Sometimes I forget all about those muggles you lived with until you say something daft like that. There is no stigma about homosexuality in the wizarding world. We can have babies with anyone because of, you know, magic so it never much mattered who you married so long as you were in love.”
Ron shrugged. “Alright, mate. You still need to check all their charts though. You could have one of those platonic matches Luna was blathering to you about last weekend.”
Harry hadn’t been expecting that frank response. His forehead creased as his eyebrows drew together as he frowned. “Er, because we’re boys? And boys like girls?”
“What??”
Harry spluttered indignantly, drawing himself up to his full height before answering magnanimously, “No.”
“That’s why Draco is so mouthy,” She joked, earning herself nothing more than a pair of cold grey eyes rolling in her direction. Harry found it interesting that this Tracey girl could get away with bad mouthing Malfoy like that. Her voice lowered and she leaned towards Harry conspiratorially, “Geminis are notoriously talkative! And the men have a bit of a reputation for causing trouble, too.”
“Good Lord.”
“You’re a Scorpio?” Harry asked Pansy excitedly, pleased that he could finally contribute meaningfully to this conversation. She nodded at him. “That’s a water sign!”
Harry dropped his quill and stared at his friend with his mouth hanging ugly and open. He was absolutely baffled. “Do you like boys, Ron??”
“Whatever you want, babe.”
“Yes, your majesty.”
Draco gentled his hand against Harry’s cheek tenderly. “Of course it’ll be perfect, Harry. It’s you. Now go and make me some pancakes before I tire of your insecurities entirely!”
“You may begin comparing those charts, children. By the end of the lesson, I expect you to have a list of five students who might potentially be your most suited match.”
“And a fresh pour-over of the Colombian coffee with firewhisky cream and fairy sugar?”
“And you wouldn’t be able to do much better than Greg or Vincent,” Malfoy muttered softly at a volume that was obviously meant for only his two bodyguards to hear. Harry heard it anyway, but Pansy and Tracey were too busy whispering to one another about whether she should approach Ron to pay Malfoy any mind.
“But what’s this house thing?”
“They deserve perfect, babe. I can’t just be fine. Everything has to be perfect.”
“Would you like to compare charts with me?” A petite dark skinned girl with long pink box braids and arresting onyx eyes offered him a tentative response. Harry couldn’t be entirely sure, but he thought her name was Tracey or Tricia. Lisa was also a possibility. Harry really wished that he was better with names. There were even two Gryffindor girls in his year that he could hardly place. Eloise and Sally? Sally-Anne and Tricia? He was hopeless. The girl continued regardless, undeterred by his inner guessing game, “I’m a Libra with an Aries ascendent.”
“Tall stack? With bananas and whip cream?”
“You’re hardly sleeping anymore,” Harry couldn’t fully make out his husband’s response to that one, but he knew it was something persnickety from the clipped, garbled words and the tone of his voice. When a handful of shoves to Draco’s back brokered no response, Harry knew it was time to pull out his ace in the hole.
“Alright students, settle in on your sofas and chairs now. Please take out your personal charts. We will be considering our own romantic futures for the next month. Someone is this class is your best astrological match and it is up to you to convince me that you’ve found them in no less than three feet of parchment.”
“Oh, well I did extra digging for us because I already love you and figured it’d be easy to write the whole assignment on the two of us, but our rising signs really screwed up our potential.”
“Baby, I really need you to get up,” Harry prodded his husband forcefully for what felt like the millionth time that morning. He’d been waiting for Ron and Hermione's wedding since Draco was no more than a recurring nuisance in his periphery and he was not going to let his blond spouse ruin it by sleeping in too late. He wasn’t even being that hyperbolic about it either. He had been bubbling over with nerves since three in the morning, pacing divots into their floorboards between the closet and the bathroom with his excessive energy.  Even the magical mirror, meant to lift the gazer’s spirits, was becoming vocally derisive of him, sick to death of watching Harry alternately practicing his speeches or hopelessly attempting to smooth down his hair. The mirror was so desperate for a break from his blathering that it had encouraged him to shower twice already.
“Yes, Potter. Gemini and Libra are both air signs. That means they form a trine,” He spoke very slowly and enunciated each of the syllables like Harry was a toddler or as if he was an incredibly rude tourist speaking their first language at a troll’s pace to people that were casually multilingual. Harry wanted desperately to punch that smirk off his awfully thin and chapped lips. “A trine is an auspicious aspect for harmony.”
“Well,” Ron huffed with all the might of someone readily coming around to the idea of spending hours searching for his soul mate. “Might as well start with you, mate. What’s your sun sun again?”
Professor Trelawney was feeling under the weather that week. Honestly it is too much to expect that a woman gifted with the unpredictable ability of foresight should be able to wrangle countless classrooms of teenagers day in and day out during dragon flu season. She was exhausted, physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually exhausted. Which is why she was disregarding all of her predetermined syllabi and pivoting completely to focus on astrology until she was feeling better. Astrology was easy and allowed for the students to be very self-sufficient. In essence, it was the perfect excuse for her to nap herself back to health on her divan in the corner while the teenagers prattled and gossiped through whatever assignments she thought up.
“You could do a hell of a lot worse than Ron,” Harry snapped at her.
Draco dove back under the covers and turned his back on Harry. “I will not be getting up before ten, Potter. You know the rules. Don’t interrupt my beauty sleep.”
Draco poked his head out from under the duvet and arched an eyebrow condescendingly over his no longer sleep addled gaze. It was abundantly clear to Harry that he did not believe a word of that empty threat. “What time is it?”
“And hot fudge and sprinkles on top?”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “Yes, yes, that’s great actually. Ron said I should be looking for an Aries ascendent to complement my Leo ascendent.”
“Yeah, mate,” Ron laughed. “But if it makes you feel better, I think I’ve ruled us out as a perfect match. Our planets actually match up fairly well, but our houses are way off. It’d never work.” Ron seemed more than a little put out. “We can still be friends though.”
“Ew!” Pansy’s voice rose to those unseemly heights once again. “As if, Potter. It’s bad enough that Greg and Vincent are on my list.”
“This is pretty basic stuff, mate. Do they not have horoscopes in muggle papers?”
“You’re a Leo Rising, see?” Ron pointed to his ascendent on his chart.  “And I’m a Taurus rising. Basically that puts your sun in your first house and my sun in my eleventh house. It’d never work. Our values are too out of whack.”
The sixth years were her first class of the day. Typically the group of Gryffindors and Slytherins were her most rambunctious and least productive class. It was especially hard to divine anything with them when Harry Potter was such an overwhelming presence in the group. If he hadn’t been nearly the entire reason she was gainfully employed, she’d have half a mind to kick him out of her classroom altogether. As it was, she was begrudgingly grateful to the doomed boy for gifting her a livelihood.
Draco looked at him, at his messy black hair, his too-green eyes behind wire-framed spectacles, the charming crooked smile, his
In between wheezes, Draco jokes, “Wonder what… your Boggart… is now.”
“For what? Shits and giggles? To best other thieves? I guess it makes sense that Red Hat is just fucking with everyone. That explains becoming visible just enough to be seen but not recognised and wearing a fucking bright red hat,” ranted Lewis. In his head, Harry preferred to refer to him as “the loud American who swears a lot.”
Charlie Weasley had recently returned from Romania to teach Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts after Hagrid moved to France. Privately, Harry and Draco both agreed that he was very fit after years as a dragon keeper. They weren't the only ones who seemed to think so, as Hermione had confided drunkenly once at his and Harry's flat.
Entering the bookstore, there are brightly colored shelves everywhere each with a little plastic sign popping up at the top to indicate the content of each bookcase. The far side of the room features café seating and there’s a neon sign by a stairwell with giant arrows to show that used books are downstairs, more books on the second floor, and the bar on the third (21+).
And finally, at night, I love how he holds me tight in his arms and kisses me on the forehead when he thinks I’ve nodded off before he has. Of course, I also love other things he does…
Harry spotted Neville across the room, raising an eyebrow and flicking his eyes between Harry and his choice of partner. Harry’s face flushed, and he wondered if his smile was as dopey as he felt.
, he added in his head. There was no way it could be him, after all, and Draco knew it. He was setting Harry up for disappointment.
“What kind of hint is ‘You’d never guess without a hint’?” Draco heard Weasley grumble. The Golden Trio had settled in the library for the weekly afternoon of mandatory study time, as dictated by Granger, and Draco had parked himself nearby, hidden on three sides by towering bookshelves and complete with a sturdy Disillusionment Charm just in case. He had hoped, correctly of course, that Harry and Weasley would be so desperate to avoid studying that they would try to draw Granger’s attention away with a good mystery.
“Take a guess, Harry,” Draco drawled, pulling back a bit shooting Harry a rather unimpressed look. Though Harry’s idiocy was rather helpful—it was helping Draco to realize that Harry was being entirely serious, and that he wasn’t somehow possessed. “We weren’t even talking until a few weeks ago. How was I to know you wouldn’t smash my face in and dump my body in the lake?”
But Draco was used to being in the spotlight in one way or another, and this sudden lack of any attention whatsoever was remarkably disorienting. He was used to creating a stir, to eliciting reactions from people, whether those reactions were good or not. Admittedly, he found himself floundering a bit without the motivation to constantly conduct himself in a proper manner to uphold his reputation.
“I’m sorry, I—”
~/~/~/~/~
For as incorrigible and snobbish as Draco had acted towards his teachers in years past, he truly loved learning in a way that only someone like Granger would understand. Those hours spent in the library, poring over book after book and piecing together the bits of knowledge they offered to perfect his charms—well, Draco hadn’t enjoyed himself quite so much ever, really, and certainly not since the end of the war. It provided an escape from worrying about his mother, all alone in the manor after his father had been exiled to France. And while Draco had felt horribly guilty since fourth year about being a downright git to Harry, he couldn’t deny that riling Harry up wasn’t fun.
And he had told Harry so in the previous day’s letter, told him that today would be the last one. That as much as Draco loved writing to Harry—though he didn’t give his name, of course—that the pain was too much to bear.
The next time Draco lifted his head from Harry’s shoulder to wipe at his eyes, the common room was empty. Most likely Hermione’s doing, he thought wryly. Honestly, he would be surprised if Hermione had chosen their spots on the couch to result in this seating arrangement. Far too cunning for her own good, and for Draco’s.
“Ronald!” Hermione hissed, elbowing Ron in the side. “Don’t you dare—”
“But…” Harry trailed off in confusion, and Merlin if that wasn’t the cutest reaction Draco could’ve hoped for. Before his heart could flutter any more at Harry’s cluelessness—why that was even remotely adorable, Draco had no idea—he stood up and joined the stream of students leaving the Great Hall to get to class.
It seemed as though the whole student body and even the teachers had stopped breathing as Harry warily opened the red envelope. Once again, a nondescript voice rang out, ranting about Harry’s idiocy. But there were no outraged comments, not this time—the silence persisted until the yelling had ceased, until Granger broke the silence with a gentle, “Well?”
And sure enough, the voice that rang out across the room was extraordinarily normal, impossible to place. “Harry Potter!” the voice screeched. “You are the biggest git I have ever met! I can’t believe the audacity…”
Draco stared at her hand in awe. This was definitely not how he had expected this conversation to end. “I—are you sure?”
Weasley groaned. “Come on, mate, are you not going to tell us?”
In the back of his head, Draco knew that the entire student body, not to mention all the staff, were currently watching their exchange. But he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when Harry was finally this close to him. “Four years,” Draco croaked, blinking rapidly to keep his tears in check. “I’ve loved you for four years, Harry. Don’t call me an idiot.”
. Draco turned back to his breakfast, a sense of triumph bubbling up in his chest.
?” Draco heard Weasley call. He glanced over to his left to see Harry and Weasley clambering through the entrance to the common room, and his breath caught. He didn’t know where Harry and Weasley had just come from, though based on several tiny little braids in Harry’s hair, they were probably with Luna, and it was so adorable it made Draco want to cry.
An involuntary scoff escaped Draco’s lips. “As if. He needs me about as much as he needs a Bludger to the face.”
Draco didn’t quite know what to say when Granger—Hemione, now—sat herself down beside him in the eighth-year common room. It just simply wasn’t done—nobody acknowledged his presence, and certainly not the Golden Trio. But here she was, poking his shoulder and demanding in a quiet whisper that Draco tell her how he’d spelled the Howlers. Needless to say, it drew quite a few stares.
“Come on, now, you,” he said gently, his voice loud and clear amid the silence. The owl hooted indignantly but hopped onto the finger Harry offered all the same.
“Oi!” came a yell from across the room. “Harry, mate, are you going to kiss him already, or what? We’re all waiting.”
“What do you mean?”
So, instead of talking with a friend, Draco spent the rest of breakfast definitely not watching Harry as he gazed about the room determinedly, no doubt trying to figure out who it was that was sending him the messages.
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry said quietly as he sat down so as not to disrupt Hermione and Weasley’s bickering. “I haven’t seen you around much this year.”
~/~/~/~/~
By the next morning, the mystery of Harry’s strange Howler had spread throughout the school, and nearly every student had been in the Great Hall since the beginning of breakfast in the hope of seeing another Howler arrive.
Hermione let out a fascinated hum and pulled a notebook from her bag to scribble some notes. “You’re right, I was making it too complicated. Still, that’s brilliant, being able to adapt such an obvious charm like that. I never would’ve thought of that. How many different layers are there?”
“Fair enough.” Hermione raised her voice. “Nothing to see here, everyone, move along.”
“Harry,” Granger interjected, and Draco could imagine the way she placed one hand on Harry’s shoulder while using the other arm to elbow Weasley in the side for his brutishness. Honestly, they were so predictable it hurt to think about. “You must’ve heard wrong. There wasn’t anything about you taking care of yourself—I don’t know who, but someone just yelled at you for being an idiot.”
But even so, Draco couldn’t bring himself to pull away from Harry’s grasp.
The abnormally hushed chatter in the Great Hall came to a complete standstill as an owl swooped down to perch himself primly on Harry’s head. Draco had chosen that owl from the school Owlery because he thought the little furry thing’s fiery personality would amuse Harry, and indeed, Harry chuckled at the new presence resting among his mop of hair.
Hermione gave him a stern look. “I’m serious. You should know how much he detests being idolized. And, well, I know you’ve seen him at his worst—yes, I know about the bathroom incident, don’t look so surprised. If you can still love him after that, then it’s real. He needs that.”
one, not an all-powerful savior. Draco knew Harry’s humanity all too well, and had scars crisscrossing his chest to prove it.
Hopefully, Draco thought, he would never find out.
“Draco,” Harry breathed, and then Draco was being pulled to his feet and wrapped in a hug. “Draco,” Harry repeated, this time breathing into Draco’s shoulder. Draco felt faint.
“Well, there’s the one to make the voice unidentifiable, of course. It’s the same voice for both messages. The base message is the one that everybody hears, because if it didn’t work, I’d rather have that message publicized than the other one. So the second layer is changing the base message to the real one for him. It’s really not that complicated once you understand how it works, but it took me a few weeks of research in the library to figure it all out. If you want some further reading, you might consider—”
Weasley’s statement sent the room back into excited chatter, and like everyone else, Draco turned back to his breakfast, though he didn’t have anyone to talk to. None of his Slytherin yearmates had returned after the war, and none of the younger ones wanted to associate with him. Which, Draco was willing to admit, was quite reasonable. If he was anyone else, he wouldn’t want to associate with himself either.
