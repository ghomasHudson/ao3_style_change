"We're barely 18, Potter," Malfoy noted, eyes wide.
"I can't find a way out of it," she admitted, voice tight and miserable.  Her fists clenched in her robe.  "I've looked everywhere, but all I've found is that the bonding is permanent, and if it isn't completed after being invoked, there will be dire consequences."
And then they were back outside, Harry wearing his new boots, trainers sent home with his dress shoes (despite Roger's desire to incinerate them once and for all).
Harry opened his mouth to protest, but then he was being swept further into the store.  His measurements were taken in a dizzying swirl, and then different fabrics were floating around him as Jacqueline and Narcissa discussed the merits of the various colors and patterns.
"I expect it was the year hiking the Forest of Dean that did it," Harry said mildly.  "Hiding from Voldemort, you know."
Hermione flushed.  "It's not important
Hermione touched his arm.  "I could always..."
Narcissa looked surprised.  "Of course.  She sends my bill directly to Gringotts.  It's rather gauche to carry that much money about in public."
"Two," Malfoy said, ignoring his interruption, "it would be better for you if the bond were with someone you already knew.  In fact, the ritual may have a stronger effect because we've actively tried to kill each other before, nevermind that we've both saved each other since. Three: while we would be required to consummate the bond once, we would not be expected to continue doing so.  After six months, we'll even be allowed to live separately should we so choose, not to mention take other lovers."
Ginny let out a soft breath.  "No.  I don't.  I never have."
Once his fingers were slick, he kissed his way down Malfoy's chest, licking and biting when the urge struck him.
When Harry finally lifted his head, Malfoy was staring at him with dark eyes.  A thrill curled through his blood, chasing away the nerves he'd felt.  He licked his lips, and Malfoy's eyes tracked the movement.
Ron shuddered.  "Can you imagine them working together?"
--" Molly sent him a warm look, one that usually came with 'Harry, dear.'  "--but I
"Cheers." Harry let his arm fall back across Draco's bare shoulders. He stroked across his spine, then slid his hand up to scratch lightly at the base of his skull.
"Feels,
"They're not tight at all," he realized.  "These are amazing."  He caught sight of his trainers as he moved again and flushed.  "I s'pose I'll need new shoes, too."
Harry had also seen Malfoy helping his friend escape the fiendfyre, and refusing to confirm Harry's identity, and lowering his wand at the last.
on breaking up with her?" Malfoy asked.
"The ritual they invoked calls on the Old Magicks, Potter.  Wild Magic.  It's... unpredictable at the best of times."  He fiddled nervously with his sleeves.  "If they break the terms of the arrangement by failing to follow through, we are all doomed for it.  Their efforts to prevent further war will incite a war worse than any we've yet seen."
"Not that it matters, but no.  Ginny wasn't my first.  We never did anything beyond kissing."
Kingsley balked, turning away with a grimace.  "Right, well.  Best avoid them, then, eh?"
He was really considering this.
"Oh, it must, must it?"  Harry slashed through his charms and stormed closer.  "And that's that, then, is it?  I'm meant to just go along with this like a lamb to bloody slaughter?  I
"Arthur wore this for our wedding, and Bill for his.  Merlin knows if Charlie will marry, but it's tradition for Weasley men to wear it on their bonding day, no matter the circumstances." Molly was smiling, tears gathering in her eyes.
“No! Don’t! We need to save Draco!” they begged, still in unison. It was starting to make Lucy a bit queasy.
“Leave them to it. They’re the ones who’ll get in trouble. Besides, did you see the size of that blunt?” There was a twinge of jealousy in Matthew’s voice as he came up behind Lucy and Amanda. “Draco’s probably off his tits and forgot to land. We’ll hear about the car wreck being fished out of the trees tomorrow morning.”
Lucy groaned as she felt Maggie jostling her awake.
I was torn as to whether or not to refer to Harry as Vampire or not. I figured that Harry as he appears in My Immortal is just SO far removed from how he behaved in the original series, it makes sense to just give him a totally different name as he may as well be a different character, but let me know what you guys think.
Thanks for all the positive comments so far! I'm glad you're enjoying my silly take on this. Again, sorry apologies for the chapter being shorter than I'd strictly like but in my defense, I don't have the meatiest of source material to work with. Pls continyu reviowing da stroy, GC r da best!!
“Oh yeah.” Jack sniggered, though Lucy wasn’t quite sure if that was because what he had to say was utterly hilarious, or just because he was high.
"Do you have any evidence to support this?" the auror continued.
“She murdered her?” repeated Lucy when they were sure the door was firmly closed. “Then Lupin raped the body?”
“Hey! What are you playing at?” Jack snapped, tugging his abused wrist out of her grasp and frowning.
Ebony was visibly dismayed by this. From seemingly out of nowhere, she drew a small silver dagger bearing the Malfoy family crest (in Lucy’s opinion, it was a decidedly ugly emblem in comparison to her own family’s, which was an ostentatious affair decorated with plumes, leaves, and a sea-green peacock under which the ancient Bonniface family motto, “Pulchritudo Vincit Omnia”, was written on a flowing banner). Though before Ebony had time to use it, she was startled by Vampire suddenly crying out in pain, and the dagger clattered to the floor.
"Vampire." Amanda corrected him, half-ironically.
“What, are they goffs too you poser prep?” Ebony asked, voice dripping with so much overdone sarcasm that Lucy wanted to cringe.
"Fair enough. I'll mention it to the others, I've got Ruth and Matthew in potions, then transfigurations with Tim this afternoon." Why not? Lucy thought as she swallowed a mouthful of soup.
“Albert?” Adam repeated derisively. “I thought his name was Albus?”
Lucy and Maggie looked at each other. “None taken.” Maggie whispered dryly.
“Now… Unless there are any more asinine interruptions to be had, we shall resume the lesson. Open your textbooks to page three-hundred-and-eighty-eight.”
As Lucy washed her face, Ebony strutted into the bathroom as well. She rinsed her face, dried it, then began to apply her characteristically dramatic makeup. Technically, the girls at Hogwarts weren’t really supposed to wear any makeup, though this rule had never been strictly enforced so most people tended to ignore it, though none ignored it quite as vehemently as Ebony. While Lucy preferred to maintain a fairly natural appearance, just a peachy flush on her cheeks and lips with a little mascara, Ebony’s inspiration seemed to be a cross between a mime and a skeleton. Every morning, she would apply a white mask of foundation, before adding bright red eyeshadow, thick black eyeliner, and black lipstick. To complete the look, Ebony would often cover her watery blue eyes with red contact lenses, though such a step was not present this morning.
“Draco runs in absolutely bollock-naked. Starts begging like a total bottom for Ebony to take him back because I guess he shagged Harry-"
“Well he started doing that again, but the weird thing was it was like EXACTLY the same thing, like verbatim.”
"No, who's playing?" replied Margot, raising an eyebrow.
Lucy’s group let out a collective gasp and huddled closer together once more, and Matthew drew his hand up to cover Lucy’s eyes in an attempt to keep her squeamishness at bay.
“Um, Ebony? Are you alright?” She asked. “It’s just you seem to be bleeding out of your eyes.”
“Yeah fucking right! Fuck off, you bastard!” She spat into his face as if the words were bitter on her tongue before tearing out of the room yet again, slamming the door behind her.
Matthew shrugged. “Sure we can. Everyone’s bound to be in bed by now.” He knitted his brow in concern. “Do you not want to?”
“He’s gone!” Lucy shouted ahead. As soon as the three up ahead heard this, they slowed and crumpled into a heap on the grass, as if her voice itself had struck them down. Matthew's pace slowed to a shaky walk, panting as he set Lucy down before falling beside his friends, running his hands through his sandy hair that clung to his sweaty forehead. Lucy was still so high on adrenaline that she found the patchy flush of Matthew’s cheeks and the sound of him gulping down great lungfuls of fresh air almost erotic. He noticed the look she was giving him and flashed her a wicked, toothy grin, sitting up and planting a kiss on her cheek with a loud smack.
I readily admit that this chapter is boring as fuck. Since in the original it's just a sex scene between Ebony and Draco, I couldn't see much opportunity to have Lucy and co interact with them without reaching in a pretty major way. So, I tried to mirror the events of My Immortal's chapter iv, just substituting Ebony and Draco with Lucy and Matthew (nothing as graphic though, for the time being at least I'm going to keep it family friendly pg 13 clean). MATTHEW IS SOO IN LUV wif her dat he is acting defrent! dey nu eechodder b4 ok!
Vampire began to snivel. “My Draco!” he wailed, crushing his face into Ebony’s shoulder.
“A glamour then, maybe. I don’t know!”
Just as Ebony and Vampire came back into sight, a powerful, cruel voice pierced the murk.
“I'm good at too many things! Why can’t I just be normal? It’s a fucking curse!” came Ebony’s final shout before flinging the door open and storming out, barely acknowledging the presence of the other two girls. Draco was left standing in the doorway, staring blankly at them, before awkwardly averting his eyes and scampering after Ebony like a nervous puppy.
“It must have been…” Lucy pursed her lips in thought. “Can’t have been since pseudo-Draco’s suicide.”
She joined the ranks of the first few students to be lined up outside the door, all muttering in discontent at their timetabling misfortune. Before long, Ruth appeared and came to stand by Lucy, fiddling with her hair that she was never quite happy with. Ruth Abelman was the type of person who could go through seven different hairstyles a day, and still be experimenting with it at dinnertime. After a few moments, the rugged wooden door opened with an obnoxious creak, and Snape emerged from the dank room in its place. The students fell silent.
As they rounded what felt like the hundredth corner in their chase, they collided head-on with Matthew, Tim, and Adam leaving the Astronomy Tower.
They kept going until they finally bumped into Dumbledore, who at first chastised them for running in the building, but upon seeing their grave expressions stopped to let them speak.
"Vampire." Amanda corrected him, shaking off a distinct feeling of deja vu.
Vampire glared sulkily at Jack and began to turn away, but then spotted Ebony approaching the forest.
“Just having a wander.”
Lucy began to chew on her tongue.
Amanda swallowed. "No, we don't, other than the fact that we firmly believe the person who claimed to have killed Willow is the sort of person who would be capable of that sort of thing." Her hands began to tremble slightly as she spoke.
“Where are they all coming from?” asked Amanda, sounding more curious than frightened.
Jack let out a groan of protest and disgust, while Lucy’s face settled into an expression of exhausted disappointment, like a tired mother who had given up on trying to discipline a naughty child. She was finding it increasingly difficult to be shocked by Ebony’s behaviour.
“What?”
“No, fuck off!” She commanded, storming off to her own dorm. Lucy was half-tempted to go after her, but in all honesty, she felt the need for a very substantial drink. Besides, if that was how Ebony was speaking to her friends, Merlin only knew what she'd say about a “prep” like her trying to console her. No, Lucy would far rather just go to the pub and get pissed out of her mind.
“Oh. Now you mention it… huh. Weird.”
Lucy nodded gravely. “When?”
In a fluid, comical motion, the three of them leaned in unison in the direction of Harry and Ebony.
“It serves that fucking bitch right.” Ebony cackled, turning her back to Maggie. They sat down side-by-side on B’loody Mary’s bed, pulling out her laptop and beginning to play The Nightmare Before Christmas. “Maybe Willow will die, too.” Ebony remarked offhandedly.
Mercifully, the bathroom was empty. Her slides squeaked on the wet floor as she approached the bath and turned on the hot tap, hanging her towel on a peg and inspecting her body in the mirror as she waited for the water to fill the tub.
“What the fuck is going on?” Lucy shouted at Maggie, struggling to be heard over the sound of Ebony’s gun.
Ebony paused for a moment and lowered her gun. “Huh?”
“Shall we eavesdrop?” Adam suggested.
Lucy glanced warily around the room. It was rustic, and a little dingy. The thin December sunlight reflected off the snow outside, barely helping the feeble ceiling lights in illuminating the room. The benches were wooden and uncomfortable-looking, like church pews. She could hear shuffling beyond the closed door.
The junior auror behind the entrance desk appeared determined to perpetuate every single stereotype of an auror known to man. Donut in hand, empty coffee cups piled around the perspex screen, nose buried in some outdated comic book. He seemed mildly offended by the presence of the three girls, as if his auror’s uniform was somehow a ruse and they were distracting him from his real job. “Can I help you?” He asked, eyes lidded with lack of interest.
Lucy sighed thoughtfully and looked up Ruth, who scrunched up her face and shook her head. “I’m not sure about it. I’m swamped with work, I know for a fact so is Luce because she’s copying my essay plan. You only want to go to stalk Ebony because you’re a sad case.”
Once dressed, Lucy and Maggie made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast, leaving Ebony and Willow - the fourth girl in their room whose mannerisms greatly resembled Ebony’s - to their preening in front of the mirror in the dorm. On the way, the girls joined up with Adam, a fellow Slytherin and close friend of theirs as he came out of the boy’s dormitory. They sat together in the Great Hall, and Lucy took a light breakfast of a cup of black coffee and a small jam pastry (she rarely had much appetite in the mornings, and eating much more than this too early often just made her feel queasy). While they ate, Dumbledore delivered a speech welcoming the students back for another school year and giving a few general announcements.
“I have found myself you mean old man!” Hagrid suddenly snapped at him. Lucy and Maggie leaned forward awaiting Dumbledore’s reply, but were only met with stunned silence. “You’re a liar, Professor Dumbledore!”
The back of the sofa on which Matthew and Lucy lay concealed them slightly, but still they froze. After a few too many moments of expectant silence, the pair slowly rose, revealing themselves.
“Fuck off.” Ebony snarled. “You know I fucking hate the colour pink anyway, and I don’t like fucked up pricks like you.” Lucy had to bite back a snicker at such a beginner mistake on Hagrid’s part.
"Not to ruin a beautiful moment," Tim began flatly with his usual unimpressed expression on his stern face, "but does anyone have a fucking clue where we are?"
I'm actually really happy with how this chapter turned out, and I managed to make it considerably longer than all its predecessors. Yes, Matthew is a total himbo, no I do not accept criticism. Since Tara's chapters start to get longer for a little while at this point in the story, I'll be trying to mimic that, therefore it might take me longer to update the next few. Please keep the comments coming in, it's always super encouraging to know that people are enjoying reading this even half as much as I am writing it.  c if dis chaptr is srupid!1111 it delz wit rly sris issus!
Roger and Narcissa spoke back and forth, but Harry had no idea what they were talking about.  Shoes, probably, but for all he knew they were discussing politics or something.
George snorted, and Ron patted his shoulder on his way to stand with Hermione.  "Not really mate, sorry," Ron said.
This isn't fair!"
Kingsley grimaced.  "There is... a very old custom, Harry.  You were meant to be informed before you got here."
tempting.  "How can I trust you?" he asked, ignoring the hope in his own voice.
"You're brilliant," Harry breathed, looping it over his head and tucking it into his robes, the dark green glittered as he moved.  "Honestly, Hermione, I'd be lost without you."
Harry didn't know what to say, so he didn't say anything.  Once she'd gone with a pop, Harry did the same, returning to Grimmauld Place to pack a bag.
"I was never going to say anything, but while we were apart," Ginny trailed off.  "I fell in love with Neville.  I was going to let the feelings pass, but..."
Harry tried to picture it.  "We wouldn't be able to stop them," he noted.
"Consummate?" Harry supplied with a wry smile.  "Yeah, they told me."
Draco Malfoy was beautiful, and from now on, he was Harry's. The thrill of that thought hit harder than Harry anticipated, somewhere dark, deep within his chest.
"What about Parkinson?"
Draco let out a little sigh, relaxing further against his side. Harry returned to playing with Draco's hair, and slowly, they fell asleep.
Harry smiled.  "If Neville hurts you...  Well, I'll heal your knuckles for you."
Harry flinched, but held his tongue.
"We're officially bonded," Draco said, voice soft. "No more war for our lifetime."
Harry shifted his weight to his knees and took his cock in hand to guide it into Draco. He fumbled a few times until Draco hooked a leg around Harry's hips and brough them sliding together like they were meant to fit, like they were alwayd meant to end up here.
Harry nodded and held still while she fastened the holster to his right arm. It felt sturdy and steadfast. His wand fit perfectly.
"Um.  Hello."
," George asked, eyes sparkling.  "That's some very regulated magic, Miss Granger."
, Harry.  It isn't invoked lightly."
"But we wouldn't be allowed to bond with anyone else."
life more miserable that it already was that year.  This would be a terrible idea."
Kingsley stepped toward him.  "Harry, please, just listen."
rival.  Draco's eyes, when they were open, unerringly found Harry's, again and again, the way they were meant to.  The same electricity from their arguments and Quidditch matches sped through Harry's veins, intoxicating.
"Where are we?" Harry asked.
He handed the note back to Julius, and then the bird was off again.
, no, but things tend to just happen to me."
Harry raised his eyebrows.  "Really?  That's never worked for me before.  Plus, they always either misquote me or call me a liar.  I'd really rather not speak to them at all, actually."  He smiled flatly.  "They treated me terribly as a child, I'd hate to see how they'll behave now I'm of age."
Harry sighed.  "Sure as I can be, I guess.  At least I know him."
, that feels--Put one in, already."
Harry didn't bother trying to remember the path they were taking.  He touched the key under his robes and took a steadying breath.
"Very well.  Unadorned.  Something classic and comfortable, I think."  Roger nodded and waved his wand through the air in a pattern Harry had never seen before.
Harry grimaced, but nodded.  "I think it's for the best.  I don't want to trap you in a relationship where you'll never have what you want."  He tipped his head back, eyes on the clouds drifting lazily overhead, pink with the sunset.  "And you don't want kids, do you?"
Harry leaned against him, fingers curled tight around the book.  "I'm going to have to hide this, you realize.  I'd never live it down if anyone found out I had something like this."
She huffed and cast a quick
Harry smiled weakly.  "And I do.  More than anything."  He let go of her hand only to wrap his arm around her shoulders.  "Are you going to tell Neville?"
A hand gripped his shoulder.  Hermione was breathing a little hard, like she'd been running.  The door behind them shut with a click.  "Sorry, I'm late.  Harry, I've read all about it, and we should talk about this in the other room."
Malfoy's expression softened almost imperceptibly; he was nervous too, Harry realized.
Harry lifted his wrist to his eyes. The mark he'd barely seen just after the ritual had now taken shape. It looked like a snake, a viper he thought, wrapped around the Sword of Gryffindor.
Ginny tossed her head back; her laugh rang out across the fields around them, startling a flock of birds into flight.
Harry shook his head, eyes on where his fingers were steadily disappearing. "No, I want you to feel good."
Malfoy leaned against the wall across from him.  His eyes slid past his hiding place, but he didn't move away.
Harry started to walk back down the hallway.
George found him after dinner, slinging an arm around his shoulders and steering him away from the rest of the family in a move that felt horribly lopsided.  Harry breathed through it, loss catching behind his ribs.
Harry stepped out of one of the Atrium's Floos and pulled the Invisibility Cloak's hood up at once.  Hermione stepped out beside him, and together they followed behind Kingsley, reporters swarming him at once.
"Do you have any strong preferences, Harry?" Narcissa asked while Jacqueline was gathering pre-made robes for him to try on.
"Thanks, Julius."  He scratched his head, took the letter offered, and handed him treats as he'd promised.
Harry slammed his fist into the wall and only barely kept from screaming.
Harry wanted him, wanted to be inside him, to give him whatever he begged for.  He pulled his fingers out and recast the lube charm.  With a suppressed moan, he spread the slick up and down his cock.
George laughed again.  "You'll be all right, Harry.  Malfoy gives you any trouble, and Ron and me'll set him to rights."
"Molly, love, Kingsley here was just telling us about his plans for getting Harry to the venue unaccosted," Arthur called.
Ginny slipped away from the loose circle of Weasleys and nodded toward the back door.  Harry followed with a grateful smile.
"Thank you, Harry."  She turned and led the way down the street, stopping outside a similarly unassuming door.  The door said only "Cobbler."
Footsteps approached his hiding place and then stopped across from him.  Harry reluctantly lifted his head.
"That's the idea."
"Nevertheless, if you ever need anything, you may always come to me."
Malfoy looked away from him, but shook his head.  "I don't hate you anymore."
."  Harry bit down on his shoulder, just enough to sting.
"Harry, mate, no person could ever compare to the wonders of dragons."  George patted his back.  "Mark me, no matter how Mum whinges, that brother of mine will never marry."
Malfoy was different than the child he knew, that much was certain, but how different?  Would they be able to get along?
Arthur laughed.  "Oh, but I am.  If you want unreasonable, I'll tell Molly, and you can try to convince her to compromise on the comfort and well-being of one of our boys."
"You made my life miserable for... what, five years?"  Harry tapped his foot to the ground.  Was he really considering this?  "You already pointed out, but we did
Because unless he was misunderstanding, the wizarding world now wanted to steal Harry's love life from him.  Dying for them wasn't enough, apparently.
“Today,” Snape began “We shall be continuing preparations for your N.E.W.T level exams. I still find it positively… miraculous that as many of you have managed to reach this point in your education, though I have decided to take this as a mark of my ability as a teacher than any of you having any particular talent or aptitude. Open your textbooks to page thr-”
She crumpled up all her dirty clothes into a ball and dropped them into the laundry chute, then wrapped her towel around her and shoved her feet into her slides.
“I’d probably say this weekend if we can. If we leave it later than that they might give us shit for not coming sooner.”
"If I didn't know any better, I'd say we were in the Forbidden Forest." Adam surmised.
“Adam was spot on.” Tim announced. He was holding a small piece of wood around the size of a tea tray under one arm. “We’re in the Forbidden Forest.” He presented the piece of wood to them, a sign that read in bold black lettering:
“Yeah, since they moved houses. I guess they got it into their heads that you can only be in Slytherin if you’re some kind of Bauhaus reject, so they’ve all got different names. Plus, apparently Granger found out she was adopted or something like that? I’ve only heard bits of the story, though, so I’m not sure how much I buy it.”
The group got back to the car park just in time to see Draco’s car leave. They began the return journey to Hogwarts a few yards behind the Mercedes. However, when Matthew and Adam began to descend back into the Hogwarts grounds, the Mercedes continued straight on over the castle.
Much to the two girls’ disappointment, Ebony’s bedside was far quieter for the rest of the day, aside from a fairly cringeworthy and uninteresting visit from Vampire and B’loody Mary.
The auror leant back in his chair, stroking the stubble on his chin. “Look girls, I appreciate that you’re worried about your friend, but without any kind of evidence I’m neither comfortable nor able to do anything about it right now.” Upon seeing the frightened look on Lucy’s face, he sat up again and gave a reassuring half-smile. “Of course, if the situation changes and you
“How did you know?” Ebony whispered, inches away from Vampire now.
Lucy and Adam looked at each other. "Draco's dead." Adam said softly.
For some reason, this seemed to only further incense Ebony. Lucy could see her eyes film over with tears, threatening to spill over there and then. Her lip trembled and her furrowed brow seemed to twitch. The class seemed to be holding their breath in eagerness to hear this response that she was taking so long to craft.
And yet, as she and Adam slunk out of the dungeons, there was an irritating, sobering voice at the back of her mind insisting that part of what had just happened was her fault. She and her cohort had hardly been the most pleasant to Draco, especially not since his conversion into gothic-ness. Had they gone too far? What had been his breaking point? Guilt began to creep through her very blood, its icy fingers clawing and gripping at her heart as she began to cry. Adam pulled her into a brotherly embrace when he saw the tears fall down her scrunched-up face, trying to calm her down but it was clear that he was thinking the exact same thing.
Suddenly, the temperature dropped and it began to sleet, and Lucy wrapped her robes tighter around her as Matthew drew her in closer.
It wasn’t long once Lucy and Maggie were admitted to the hospital wing for a checkup for Ebony to follow suit. Though Madame Pomfrey had pulled the privacy screen between Lucy and Ebony, it was easy for Maggie and Lucy to hear what was being said on the other side.
"Done questionable things of a sexual nature with the body." finished Amanda with an air of professionalism.
Still blanking her dorm-mates’ stares, Ebony slunk over to the record player in the corner of the room, clutching a Good Charlotte vinyl. Fearing for the safety of her own precious vinyls, Lucy lunged in the same direction and carefully removed Costello Music from the player before Ebony, shooting a glare at Lucy, dropped the needle onto her record. As the music began to play, Ebony returned to her bed and began to flick through a worn-looking copy of Twilight: New Moon while her wrist continued to bleed.
“Give me a second, I just need to grab something from the dorm.” said Adam, stopping his friends as they headed down the corridor to leave school.
“Matt! You’re not going to believe this shit!” Jack, with the amount of grace that would far better befit a small hurricane, burst through the door of the common room, blunt in hand.
Before they could continue squabbling, Lucy and Matthew whimpered again. Their companions first looked at them, then at what had caused them such distress.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“We’d like to file a missing persons report.” Said Maggie, stepping forward to the desk.
"Okay. And what relationship are you to Willow?" the auror continued.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
As I said, because these chapters are so short I'm just posting them together.
“Ebony, it’s not what you think!” Draco cried. Matthew and Tony doubled over and slammed their fists down onto the table, almost choking on their howls of mirth.
“Oi oi, don’t look now. What’s Draco going to make of all this?” Maggie nodded towards Draco who had just appeared at Ebony’s side. After whispering something into her ear, Ebony stood up and left the Great Hall with Draco, leaving Vampire alone and jealous-seeming to the viscera he was trying to eat. He noticed his three classmates looking at him in mock fascination, and responded by growling at them like he thought it might deter them rather than just adding to their reasons to ridicule.
Finally, they reached the surface and escaped through the cave, where, after Matthew had gained a bit of distance, Lucy spied their pursuer standing in the entrance. He stared out from the mouth of the cave at them as they fled, as if there were something preventing him from crossing the threshold, before his interest in them seemed to eclipse and he turned around, descending back into the depths of his lair.
They were all silent again for a moment. Nobody could quite look each other in the eye.
Adam suddenly approached through the courtyard, an amused smile on his broad face. “Tasty news.” he announced. “Concert in Hogsmeade tonight, My Chemical Romance. You’d think that the venues are following Ebony on Spotify or something from how well they seem to know EXACTLY who she listens to, but that’s neither here nor there. We going?”
“Allah Kedavra!”
Later that day, after supper, Adam was decimating Maggie at chess in the common room, and Lucy spied Draco approaching Ebony once again. She still couldn’t hear their exchange properly, but she did manage to extract a few words, including ‘Good Charlotte concert’ and ‘go with me’. Lucy nudged Adam in the ribs with the spine of the book she was reading.
Lucy was refusing to move, paralysed by nervousness. Maggie was starting to get irritated, and was running out of soothing words with which to coax Lucy off the wide stone steps to the auror outpost.
Now that WAS a dilemma. Risk arrest for wasting auror time, thought Lucy, or be made to do exercise? The former seemed far more appealing. She stood up tentatively.
The junior auror, whose name badge read JA Bailey, rolled his eyes and drew a deep breath, closing his comic book slowly and deliberately. “Sign in here please.” JA Bailey pushed a black book and a quill under the screen, then cast a silencing charm. He leant back into his little office and shouted something, settled back into his seat, and removed the charm. As Maggie scribbled, another auror appeared through the door next to the reception desk.
Suddenly, Lucy caught sight of (and pointed out to her friends) a small tattoo on Draco’s upper arm. It was a picture of a black heart being pierced by an arrow, with a banner around it displaying the word “Vampire”.
“So the timeframe’s plausible. But where would she have done it?” Maggie perched on the side of a sink and began to grind her heel into the floor.
“Weird.”
Lucy sighed. “If it were anyone else? Complete bullshit. From her? Not so much. If I didn’t know any better I’d say we ought to report it.”
Adam started his car and began to fly off, so Matthew followed suit and they flew in convoy to the venue. Once parked, they trailed into the mosh pit in time to hear the support act, another band that Lucy had never heard of called Simple Plan, perform. None of the music was particularly to Lucy’s taste, though she enjoyed the atmosphere. Every now and then, she caught a glimpse of Draco and Ebony, though they were never in the same place for long. She thought she saw them sneak backstage at the end of the concert, though she wasn’t quite sure. So many couples around them were dressed so similarly it could have been almost anyone.
“What?” Maggie’s mouth lay agape for a moment, then she smirked and shook her head. “Nah, you’re fucking with me. That didn’t happen.”
“Huh, wrong room.” Lucy said when they entered a large hall painted an aggressive shade of pink, then seemingly hastily painted over again with a watery black. Large posters of the Backstreet Boys dominated much of the wallspace. Lucy shrugged and turned back into the corridor, before Maggie seized her by the wrist.
“Yikes, what’s his major malfunction?” Maggie whispered to Lucy.
"See? Wasn't so bad." said Maggie.
Lucy stepped out of the Saab, craning her neck up at the sky.
Clearly alerted by the commotion, yet another figure began to approach, accompanied by the resonant clacking of sharp heels on the rugged stones. “Snaketail, what art thou doing?” The voice belonged to the form that the first young man had initially taken. The same black robes, tattered at the hem, the same skeletal white face, devoid entirely of a nose and lips set into a hard, thin line, and the same highly polished black boots that peeked out as he stepped closer.
But before Isaac could take off, a blinding flash burst from the rooftops a few streets away, as if a small star had just collapsed inside a building. Lucy and Maggie scrambled to the same side of the car and pressed their faces against the window. A trickle of people all running from the same direction became a stampede tearing through the narrow streets, running past the car so quickly it began to rock.
A pensive silence fell on the five of them. “Maybe it was some kind of copy? Not like a clone, but a model or a decoy or something?” suggested Jack.
“Whatever!” Ebony cried irritably.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
"Wasn't planning on it, but we could. I've not got any homework tonight. We don't have to stay for the whole thing if we don't like it or it gets too late."
“Who?” Jack asked aloud.
She pushed the door lightly, gingerly stepping over the threshold. The room was dark, but she could hear shuffling in the gloom.
Lucy and Matthew shrieked in horror, and latched onto each other. Tim, who had been listening more carefully, sneered.
Maggie showed no sign of moving, and no matter how many times Lucy tried to sink her shoulders back below the water and ignore her, she could feel Maggie’s expectant gaze slowly boring two holes into the back of her skull. “Fine! I’ll tell you.” She shuffled around to face her. “So I had Magical Creatures with Jack last period today, and like three-quarters through the lesson Ebony materialised out of nowhere and started talking to Vampire.”
Before Maggie could nudge Lucy and make a snide remark about the unfamiliar spell Hagrid had just cast, there was a sudden violent crack in the air, as if lightning had just struck the building, and a ball of black flames rose above them, visible to Lucy and Maggie over the screen. They stared, mouths agape and brows furrowed.
As Vampire was speaking, the five eavesdroppers found themselves unable to quench their curiosity an began to creep closer, but before they really understood what was happening, the room seemed to warp around them. The walls melted and shifted, until their surroundings were no longer recognisable. The air suddenly felt dank and close, and it took a while for Lucy’s weak eyes to adjust to the sudden darkness.
“Absolutely.” Lucy replied with gusto.
After that, the two of them finally sat down and the rest of their conversation was swallowed by the hum of chatter in the hall. Lucy, Maggie, and Adam settled back to their food, disappointed.
They sat down and listened to the morning's announcements, delivered today by Professor Flitwick, before starting their breakfasts. Lucy couldn't help but notice Ebony and Draco sitting a few seats away from each other, and every now and then one would glance shiftily up at the other before redirecting their attention to their food (if one could really call what Ebony ate in an average day food, so much questionably sourced blood surely could not be good for the digestive system).
"Yeah, fine, he was shagging Vampire while he was meant to be shagging her.” Matthew explained, filling in for Lucy and Ruth who had both now crumpled against a wall clutching at their sides and emitting a sustained, high-pitched wheezing sound that better resembled the whistle of a boiling kettle than anything that could be produced by human vocal cords.
“Huh?”
“Well, turns out he did it deliberately. They went there to shaaaag…” he drawled out his final word, leaning down to take another puff of the blunt that Matthew was still holding between his thumb and forefinger.
But before they could enter the dorm once again, they were stopped by the sound of arguing voices. Though the sound was dampened by the heavy wood of the door, Lucy and Maggie could clearly make out Ebony’s nasal whine.
FORBIDDEN FOREST: STRICTLY NO ENTRY
Lucy could have sworn she'd seen this before.
Tim thought for a moment. “With any luck, the whole teaching staff will be so confused by Draco coming back from the dead that there’s theoretically no reason why we should be noticed.”
“She thinks she’s a vampire. You kill them with a STAKE to the heart. She must have thought it was a STEAK, as in the food.”
The bell rang. Lucy got up from the windowsill and stretched. “There’ll be another surveillance opportunity for you sometime soon Adam, I wouldn’t worry about it.”
“Oh yeah, I have a confession.” B’loody Mary announced as if she had been listening. “After she got expelled I murdered her and then Lupin did it with her because he’s a necrophile.
“Clearly there is.” said Maggie, looking back at Ebony who had now thrown the steak to the side in frustration. She then climbed out of the bath and seized her towel (Lucy had no idea that Marylin Manson's merchandising was so broad), but before she could comment on Maggie and Lucy’s sudden appearance the three of them heard a stifled groan from outside. Their focus instantly snapped to the window, and had the events of that day not already been so utterly absurd, they would not have believed their eyes.
Now that Ebony had left again, Draco suddenly seemed to become aware of exactly where he was. A benevolent Ravenclaw (still sniggering) offered him a textbook with which to cover himself, though at this point the sight of his genitals had been seared into the minds of everyone in the room. First he met Vampire’s gaze, then Snape’s, but before Snape could unleash the tirade of abuse he undoubtedly had lying in wait behind his lips, Draco spun on his heels and darted into the corridor, presumably after Ebony.
After breakfast, Lucy attended her morning lessons. These included her favourite class, ancient studies, the subject she hoped to study at the University of Lyndenby (the universities of Todmore and Lyndenby were considered the Oxbridge of the wizarding world, two of the oldest and most prestigious institutions of magical higher education).
"We'll have missed our table by now." said Tim quietly, glancing down at his watch.
“Ebony! It has revealed that someone has-” Dumbledore began but stopped suddenly, running over to the window upon seeing Snape and Lupin clinging to their brooms in bloodied clothes, faces twisting in agony. “No!” He cried. He waved his wand frantically, but didn’t cast anything.
“We should get going.” said Matthew, standing up while looking at his watch. We should be able to slip into dinner without anyone noticing if we walk quickly.”
Though Ebony looked shaken about something, nobody could take either of them seriously enough to ask her what had happened.
Lucy turned around, followed shortly by Jack, but instead of Ebony adorning herself with raw meat again, they were smacked in the face with the sight of Vampire kneeling over her with his trousers around his ankles and her fishnet-clad legs wrapped tightly around his hips as they rocked back and forth to the pace of Vampire’s shaky thrusts.
“Oh it gets better! So are we ugly, or are we sluts? Or both?.” Lucy whispered back.
“Will you tell me what happened now? The boys are being super cagey.”
“What have you done?” He cried. Ebony was sitting down on a couch with the girl that Lucy recognised as Hermione Granger, but now went by B’loody Mary Smith, holding an arm around her shoulder. She already looked like she’d been crying when she looked up at Dumbledore. “Ebony, Draco has been found dead in his room. He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.” Dumbledore’s voice was softer now, though Lucy couldn’t help but think that there were more delicate ways of delivering the news.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Adam finally managed to steady himself enough to speak. He wet his lips. “Its Draco. He’s - he’s dead.”
"She didn't have the best behavioural track record, so we just assumed she'd been expelled." Amanda looked to her friends, who both gave an assenting nod.
“No!” the young man gasped, clutching at his chest with shaking, panicked hands as he fell writhing to his side. His fat body gave a few pained heaves before stilling entirely as his hands dropped limply. Ebony whined and began to cry.
Don't have masses to say about this chapter other than sorry it's taken this long to update. If uoureue a prep than du nat red it!!!!!!!!!!!
“They won’t, there’s nothing to worry about. If you’re right, then you’ve given them a valuable tipoff, and if you’re wrong it’s an honest mistake. There’s literally no grounds to arrest you.”
It was then that Lucy and Maggie suddenly became aware of a sort of… faint, wet, slapping noise. Confused, and a little troubled, they followed the sound until they reached the sunken baths, to see Ebony, half-submerged in steaming water, rubbing a piece of raw meat against her bare chest.
Before break had even ended, retellings of these events had been spread in various incarnations and had managed to circulate around Hogwarts twice. By the time Amanda spotted Draco and Ebony emerging from the Forbidden Forest once again, there wasn’t a single student that didn’t have a clear image in their mind’s eye of that potions class.
“Easy mistake to make.” Lucy quipped quietly, drawing a stifled snort from Maggie.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Dumbledore’s expression suddenly darkened. “No!” he spat bitterly. “I don’t give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco. Not after how much he misbehaved in school, especially with YOU, Ebony!” He jabbed a bony, accusatory finger at Ebony before turning his back to them. “Besides, I never liked him that much anyway.” He said before walking away.
“Uh-huh?”
“Right, go on.”
As if waking from a trance, Ebony suddenly balled up her fists and beat Vampire away from her. “Vampire you fucker!” She punctuated the insult with a sharp slap across his face. “Stop trying to screw me! You know I loved Draco!”
She kicked her legs for a moment while Vampire cautiously backed off, before beginning to stomp away, but before she was out of earshot Vampire gave a shout of pain and fell to his knees, clutching at his forehead in a very similar fashion to how he had a few days ago in the bathroom. “OMFG! No! My scar hurts!”
“What?” Ebony urged.
Draco’s face turned pink and twisted in anger. “Shut up! Shut up so much, all of you, you stupid fucking preps!”
Lucy still felt very much in the dark about who Volfemort was.
While Maggie and Adam made their way back to the Slytherin dorms, Lucy decided to spend the rest of the evening with Matthew in the Hufflepuff common room. The room was illuminated by the fire beginning to settle in the hearth, and was as good as empty, save for a trio of third years chattering quietly in their pyjamas by a table on the far side of the room. The pair sat down on the plush couch that faced the fireplace, and Matthew gingerly pulled Lucy in closer. Though they had been together for a little while, since the early summer term of last year, there was still a residual adolescent clumsiness to their interactions. Their cuddling was often slightly awkward, with stray limbs ending up in less than comfortable positions, and nervous kisses that sometimes didn’t quite line up properly. Nevertheless, Matthew and Lucy simply enjoyed being in each-other’s company.
"Harry!" Draco's voice cracked, and he cried out.
"I made sure no one would follow me.  If you want to shout at someone, now's the time.  Unless you want to make Granger cry some more," Malfoy drawled.  "But she's already miserable, and she
Harry's stomach grew tacky with cooling come. With a wince, Harry summoned his wand from wherever it had rolled, and cast a few quick cleaning charms on himself and Draco.
Malfoy's eyes trailed slowly down and back up.  He nodded once, like he was deciding Harry passed muster.
"You'll have to get there before Ginny does."  Harry bumped his shoulder against Ron's.  "I wish things could have been different."
Harry let out his breath slowly.  Ron's snoring picked up across the room, and Hermione mumbled at him until he shifted and stopped.
"I don't know."  Ginny looked over at him.  "We're breaking up, aren't we?"
Malfoy sighed.  "Look, Potter, here are the facts.  One: you need to marry someone on the losing side of the war.  If you don't, we'll all be doomed to another war, infinitely worse than the one we've just finished with."
"Do you know any...?" Malfoy started to ask.
George patted his shoulder.  "Don't look so surprised, mate.  We've got your back."
"What did he say?" Hermione asked.
"Oh," Harry murmured.  "I, er, I had no idea."
"Okay, I practiced a lot."  Harry nipped the side of his throat.  "Do you have a preference?"
She leaned into him, warm and solid.  "Did any of the other candidates catch your eye?"
Malfoy laughed and his head tipped backward with the strength of it.  "Who else would you choose?  Greg?  Theo?  Daphne?"  Malfoy kept laughing.  "Or are you actually expecting me to believe that you, a sentimental Gryffindor, are going to bond to a perfect stranger?"  He wiped his eyes as if his laughter had brought him to tears.
Ron shook his head.  "Ginny'll be okay.
Harry looked up, but Malfoy had one arm thrown over his face.  He was squirming, cock hard and straining.  Harry licked his lips.
"Wait, but he told me loyalty to his bondmate was important to him."  Harry's brow furrowed.  "But he also implied he would accept me resuming my relationship with Ginny?"  He glanced down at Hermione.  "When he said 'loyal,' he didn't mean 'faithful,' did he?"
"Bet you he asks me
Malfoy was going to be his husband.
"Is that Malfoy's bird?"  Hermione looked like she wanted to read over his shoulder.
Lemme know what you guys think!
Harry laughed, too.  "She'll have company.  Malfoy's going to help me say no, and he
"They might calm down if you'd give a statement, Harry."  Kingsley sighed.
The collective horror on his face and Narcissa's was almost funny.
But could Malfoy be that person?  He'd seen Harry at his worst, to be sure, and Harry had seen more bad sides of Malfoy than good.
Hermione bit her lip, glancing toward the other room where Arthur and Kingsley were still arguing.
Just because Malfoy was right didn't mean they didn't also deserve some leniency in exchange.
Harry snorted.  "Fine then."  He worked a second finger into him and got back to stretching him.  "It was Hermione, before she and Ron got together."
"You will," Harry agreed, and added another finger.
"You can always use this mess as an excuse."  Malfoy's tone was odd, like he was hiding something, his true reaction, maybe.
"From you and Fred?  What for?"
Narcissa's eyes glittered when he caught them.  Her manner was reserved, but even so, Harry could tell she was pleased.
“かわいい.” was all Ebony had to say is response.
Lucy cringed. What kind of pseudo-prophetic bollocks was that supposed to be?
“But that was, what, four weeks ago?”
“Oh.”
"We can't be certain since we don't really have any friends in common and we don't have any classes together, but we noticed she wasn't there in the dorm roughly a month ago." Maggie jumped in to rescue Lucy.
“Oh, I get it.” Maggie whispered to Lucy after a moment of stunned silence.
"Of course, Jacqueline."  Narcissa bowed her head, a tiny smile tugging at the corner of her lips.  "I'll be back with Draco for his fitting tomorrow, and you may tell him yourself."
Harry pulled them on.  They were much too large, but with a few spells, Roger had them shrink to fit perfectly.  They were snug without being constricting.
Harry frowned at his feet.  He tried to think about the fancy shoes he'd seen Dudley and Uncle Vernon wearing for church, but he just remembered them being ugly and shiny and ridiculous.  "I don't really like most of the... patterny things I've seen?"
"A-All yours," Draco agreed. "Harry, the ritual--"
He "No Commented" their way through the crowd, the Weasleys flanking him and falling in around Hermione and Harry.
a Slytherin."
Kingsley winced.  "Yes, I find that likely."
"About the same, but this time I could see he meant it."  She leaned her head back against his arm.  "I believe him, anyway.  And I do think he's your best option.  He was a jerk, but you've already seen him at his worst."
Harry blinked.  "What?"
Harry laughed under his breath.  Leave it to Hermione.  "Not until the war ended."
Hermione stepped out of his Floo and immediately locked it.  "Molly wanted to come by, and so did Ginny, but I thought one thing at a time might be best for now."
overdue for a new pair of shoes, young man."
"Yes, ma'am."  Harry snuck another look, but her expression had warmed again with her approval.  "You should probably call me Harry, since I'm going to be your son-in-law."
Narcissa sighed.  "I'm not surprised.  We'll make sure you leave with more than one set of dress robes."
"You're to be my son-in-law, Mr. Potter.  I'll not have you dressing poorly for formal events."  She finally looked at him, her grey eyes glacial.  "Am I understood?"
"Ooh, on second thought, I'll leave it to her.  Scariest witch I ever met, that one."
"I think I will.  Not right away, but... soon."  She leaned against his shoulder.  Her hair smelled like flowers and summer.  "I've missed him."
"Pansy?" Malfoy asked.  "She's queer, for one, and her family left for America before the dust settled."  He shrugged.
They were more comfortable than any shoe he'd ever worn, and if Narcissa's nod and Roger's grin were any indication, they looked good too.
Narcissa touched his shoulder.  Harry was starting to think it was her way of indicating approval.  "Let's see how they look on," she decided.
The blush returned with a vengeance.
Harry kept his pace steady and focused. "Mine now," he murmured against his throat. "All mine.  Forever."
Roger clapped him once on the back.  "May your future days be predictable and peaceful."
Harry glanced over the people gathered; their eyes were resigned, their shoulders slumped.  They knew already that he'd decided.
"Actively," Harry muttered.  "So you might antagonize me inactively?"
She shook her head.  "You shouldn't," she whispered.  "This ritual--it's
, you tosser, don't just
"Stay with your friends for a few days.  I will owl you when it's done."  Narcissa bowed her head.
Someone whose interests were bound up in his, someone he could trust.  Someone who knew some of what he'd been through...
"I wonder if people will think I'm under Imperius?"
Harry groaned this time, and Ron laughed, long and loud.
His blond hair was loose, framing his face and softening his features.  It shone in the torchlight, faintly gold.  His robes were a dark blue, almost black, with a glitter to them that looked like the night sky.
Despite himself, Harry was charmed by it.
Malfoy guided his head into a slow kiss, careful and chaste.  Harry moaned and pressed closer.  He didn't have much experience, and maybe it was just the magic, but this was the best kissing had ever felt for him.
"I'm not surprised.  She loves her son more than anything, I think.  I could see it today."
"No," he said.  "No, Hermione, this is too much."
Harry crooked his fingers and rubbed insistently at the little bump.  Draco cursed and whined and begged, the words spilling out of him without stopping.
"Too bad he didn't switch sides sooner.  That woulda been a sight to see," Ron acknowledged.  "He's still a prat, though, and if he hurts you, I'll kill him."
He'd bring it up with Kingsley before he went home.
"That's not,"
"Fuck," he breathed.
Harry turned over again.  Tomorrow evening, he would be bonded to Draco Malfoy.  No more putting it off, and no more ignoring it.
Julius took the letter in his beak and flew off silently into the night.  Harry watched him go until he was out of sight.  He shut the window and got back into bed.
"Yes,
The other people in the room hastily averted their eyes, like they were embarrassed for him, and Kingsley sighed again like Harry was the unreasonable one.  Was it unreasonable to expect his happiness to matter to
"Can I kiss you?" Harry asked.
Harry pulled her into another tight hug, and then, by mutual unspoken agreement, it was over.  They walked back to the house in their usual companionable silence; they kept several inches between them.
Malfoy liked men?
If the dress robes were this comfortable...  "Maybe," Harry hedged.
"Very noble of you."
"Stubborn bastard," Draco moaned. "Fuck me already!"
The bonding would be on the full moon at the end of the week.  He tried not to think about it.
.  Breaking up because she very reasonably isn't anywhere near ready to consider children, and I'm some kind of crazy person."
am I expected to give up this time?"
Beside her was her son, talking to Goyle, a woman who might be Mrs. Goyle fidgeting just behind them.
George's eyes twinkled merrily.  "That's half the fun.  Do read it, though.  There's some interesting stuff in there, and plenty that works for two men, y'know."
And then the amused façade dropped completely.
When they were told, Harry and Malfoy reached across the stone and clasped their hands arpund each other's wrists.  The officiant wrapped a red ribbon around them, starting at Harry's wrist and winding around and around until he reached Malfoy's.
Harry leaned against him.  "Thanks.  I'll take that."  He scratched the side of his nose.  "I'm getting married," he said aloud, testing out the sound.
Narcissa led him out the door.
The lift came to a jarring halt, and Harry pulled his hood back up, following Hermione out and into the hallway.
He snorted.  "Yeah,
They'd barely landed before Harry was pushing Malfoy up against the wall in the entryway.  "I feel like I'm burning," Harry breathed.
Harry was hardly aware of their passage through the house (distantly noting how much lighter the air felt, how clean everything looked); they stumbled up the stairs, pausing to kiss, knocking into the wall and kissing some more, before finally making it into his bedroom.  (Not much changed, but certainly more pleasant to be in, a fire burning warmly in the hearth, sconces lighting as they pushed inside.)
"Brilliant."  Though, the tension in the room implied otherwise.  "Then why do you look like someone just died?"
Hermione stared.  "I don't know.  I suppose you'll need to talk to him about that.  It hardly seems fair to him if that's the case..."
Harry felt the words like a blessing, a warm cloak drifting over his shoulders.
Narcissa frowned.  "No more expensive than they're worth.  I won't be canceling the order, and you will not be refusing this gift."
Harry tensed.  Damage control, he realized.  "Hermione, what
Harry stared.  Malfoy was serious, he realized.  "You really mean that."
"Yes, that does about sum it up."
had decided."
Harry froze.  "How expensive were they?"
"Kingsley," Harry said slowly.  "What
Oh God, he had to tell
Granted, he didn't have much experience with it either, but that hardly mattered.
"Harry, Harry, Harry," George said as they stepped out into the twilight, "I've given this a lot of thought--me and Fred, we'd discussed this before, see--and I've decided that the best made plans should not be wasted.  So I have a present for you."
Harry winced, but nodded.  "This is sooner than I intended, though."
Harry lifted his lips from Malfoy's neck.  "Lube charms?  I do.  Book from the twins.  I
He was getting married.
Harry pointedly stroked over the little bump again, tightening his hand around Draco's cock in the same moment. Draco arched with a surprised noise. "This can wait, don't you think?"
Harry snorted.  He could imagine that.
Narcissa's eyebrows rose in the same way Malfoy's did.  "You will only need to repeat the words, but you will be taking Draco back to your home when the ritual ends."
Draco's arm was still thrown over his face, but he was spreading his legs wider, arching his hips in invitation.
Malfoy curled a leg around Harry, holding him in place.  "The ritual."  Malfoy's arms looped around his neck.  "I think it's giving us a push.  Helping things along."
Harry licked his lips, cheeks unaccountably warm.
Harry shot Hermione a sly wink; she blushed and smacked him again.
"Walk around," Roger encouraged.  "See how they feel when you move."
"Good," she said, quiet and fierce.  "I... may have brought that up with Malfoy.  He seemed delighted at the prospect of telling off people who ask you for things you don't want to give."
The step creaked as Ron sat down beside him.  "Malfoy, huh?" he asked.  "You sure about that, mate?"
, you think he's fit," Ron groaned.  "Mate, come on, it's
Malfoy moaned and gasped as he moved down his body, fingers grasping at the comforter.
The ribbon shone blood red against their skin, and then seemed to sink beneath as Harry watched.  After a moment, even that faded, leaving behind a small mark on the inside of his wrist.
Harry slid one finger inside him, obliging.  He was warm and so, so tight.  He was going to be inside that.  He was really doing this.  His cock throbbed with impatience, but he ignored it.
Ron finally came down, tripping down the last few steps as he tried to finish straightening his new dress robes, something sedate and elegant.  He cleaned up well, now that he wasn't in some lacey monstrosity like the Yule Ball.
Harry hesitated to rip into it, too used to their usual newsprint wrapping. He glanced up, but she was nodding and urging him to open it.
"So you're
Harry nodded.  He closed the door behind him and took her arm when it was offered.  The disorienting pull of disapparation overwhelmed him, and then with a pop, he opened his eyes on an unfamiliar street.
"Roger," she greeted, kissing the air as she had with Jacqueline.  "I'm so pleased to see you've reopened.  We've missed you, of course, and Jacqueline sends her love."
Harry indicated the boots, embarrassed at their intensity.
Draco nodded behind his arm. "Yes, yes, fine, I take your point."
The otherwise plain door read "St. Germain" and said nothing else.  Harry would never have noticed it or even realized they were a tailor.
Pairs of unfamiliar people, parent-child if the resemblence could be trusted, filled the room.  The older member of the pair was almost invariably fussing over the appearance and posture of the younger.  Harry's eyes skimmed over them, brow furrowing with every unfamiliar face, until he met the eyes of Narcissa Malfoy.
"And don't worry, Harry, if Ron ever convinces Hermione to marry him, we'll give him the same."  George's grin was broad and cheeky as it ever was.  "And Percy, if he ever tricks someone into it."
Harry and Ron raised their eyebrows, and George leaned closer.
"And you're sure there are no cameras waiting, Kingsley?" Arthur asked, his voice low and dangerous.  "These boys don't deserve to be in the papers today on top of everything else."
"That works fine for me.  I've never been with another bloke, but I think the mechanics should be similar."  Harry bit his lip, wand sliding neatly into his hand from the holster (which he promptly removed), and focused on the lube charm from the book.
"And if I refuse?" he asked.
Narcissa nodded.  "Would you like to wear them out?"
The envelope was addressed to him in Malfoy's handwriting.  (Another thing he knew about Malfoy.)
"How should I know?  I've never had to live with you before," Malfoy snapped.  He sighed.  "Look, how many Ministry functions have you attended since the war ended?"
Malfoy crossed his arms.  "How could they?  You're immune."  Something occured to him; his brows rose.  "You've decided," he said, surprise clear.  "You'll pick me, then?"
Harry shook his head.  "No, she's not worth it.  And we made a deal with her.  No, the others are more of a concern than she is anyway."  Harry snorted.  "She's still afraid of you, you know?"
"Jacqueline," Narcissa said, "this is my future son-in-law, Harry Potter."
"Pity."  Jacqueline pointed at Harry.  "You will return later, and I will fit you for a full wardrobe.  Your clothes, they are terrible."
Harry laughed, and they walked back inside together.
"A full wardrobe?"
Harry sighed.  "I know.  And, no.  I don't.  Doesn't mean I don't think it could be a mistake."
Harry and George both snorted.
Molly handed him a small box wrapped with a shimmery white paper.
"I've only ever been to Madame Malkins," Harry admitted.  "I've never much liked clothes shopping."
"Malfoy," she said instead.  "Can I have a moment?"
, I don't know."  Draco's legs crossed behind Harry's back.  "I don't
Hermione's lips tilted in a slight smile.  "Good."
More people began to notice him, all falling silent one by one.  Malfoy met his eyes, but there was no spark of challenge there, just... resignation.
Malfoy to pose after the ceremony," Harry returned.
"Harry," Hermione hissed, "you're still wearing the Cloak."
"You better have," Malfoy gasped.  He pulled Harry's hair which sent a pleasant tingling through his scalp and down his back.
A bell rang above their head, and an older woman appeared from the back of the shop.  "Narcissa," she greeted, voice low and husky.
And then a pair of black leather boots with bold criss-cross stitching up the sides caught his eye.  "Oh," he said aloud.
This was
"Do you have any style preferences I should know about, Mr. Potter?" Roger asked.
He clapped Harry's shoulder and pressed a small leatherbound book into his hands.  Harry flipped it open and clapped it shut immediately, face hot.
Draco clutched greedily around Harry's cock; Harry moaned into his mouth. "How's it feel for you, Draco? Okay?"
"I like them."
Harry tried to look disapproving, but George's laughter was contagious, and soon they were holding each other up through waves of mirth.
Harry shook his head.  "No, no.  I won't lie to her.  I can't.  She deserves the truth."
Narcissa and Roger were on him at once.  "Which pair?"
Harry brushed a small bump in his efforts, and Draco arched with a cry.
Harry sat beside George, both of them watching the proceedings with interest.
have practiced."
Malfoy sketched a grin, a hollow imitation of anything Harry had seen from him before.  "I see you're not counting sixth year."
Started this on a whim, so let's see where this goes!  I've been working on this for about three months, and I've started the next chapter already.  Hopefully it doesn't get... too long.  haha;;
Warmth splashed across his stomach, and Harry groaned, kissing Draco's lax and pliant mouth. With a few more thrusts, Harry tumbled over the edge, unable to hold back any longer.
Harry bit his lip.
"It's a matter of public record," Kinglsey snapped.  "This is hardly some secret affair!  The vote was public, Arthur!"
Malfoy's eyes caught his, silver in the torchlight.  "You're not scared, are you, Potter?"
Kingsley pinched the bridge of his nose.  "Right.  Of course."  He sighed.  "The Wizengamot has voted nearly unanimously to invoke a... very old ritual.  One that should be enough to prevent another war breaking out in our lifetimes."
"I may have... made you a portkey," she mumbled.  "It'll take you directly to your house when you say its name."
"And how did you manage
Her accent reminded Harry of Madame Maxime.
Narcissa began to walk, so Harry fell into step beside her.  "My preferred tailor is on this street.  We're a few streets away from Diagon Alley's main thoroughfare."
Harry let his head thunk back against the wall.  "Bloody fuck," he breathed.
"It's not you I'm really worried about."  He frowned.  "The Wizengamot, they'll want this all over the papers, won't they?"
"And, what, you've decided to be okay with marrying me?" Harry asked.  "Even though you hate me?"
“No idea. I didn’t even know she was in our dorm.” replied Maggie just as quietly.
Harry shifted to wrap his arm around her shoulders.  "Thanks for looking.  If anyone could have found something, it would have been you."
"Worse than anything we've seen, yes."
Narcissa nodded.  "As I thought.  If it's at all as I remember, I can see why you would struggle with it.  Persistent Dark magic will have that effect on a building.  It requires specialized magic to cleanse, especially with a house as old as that one."
Malfoy nodded.  "Right, and I grew up in that world.  I've been navigating those functions since I was a child.  As your bondmate, I would be with you the whole night."  He cocked his head.  "I'm comfortable doing all the talking if that's what you want.  And if you don't want to go at all, I could write your refusal for you in such a way no one could claim offense."
Harry shot to his feet and threw his arms around her, hiding his face against her shoulder. "Now who's being ridiculous," he mumbled.
Harry stood up straighter.  That sounded too good to be true and
The cloth was smooth and cool against his skin, the collar was loose and comfortable.  He rolled his shoulders and moved his arms at Jacqueline's prompting.
The bell chimed as they entered, and a man poked his head out from behind a curtain.  "Narcissa, it's been too long!"
Harry rolled onto his stomach.  He knew a lot, but none of it added up into anything meaningful.  It was like looking at the Room of Hidden Things, all disparate odds and ends.
true, Potter, my mother intends to collect on the debt you owe her."  He shrugged.  "You can choose someone else, but it would be faster if you just chose me from the start, since she'll be making you choose me anyway."
Panting, he pulled out and rolled off Draco to one side. Draco turned toward him, resting his cheek on Harry's chest. Obliging, Harry wrapped an arm around him.
This would not be nearly as difficult as he expected.
?" Harry asked.  "How could it get
"Me, too."  Harry kissed the top of her head.  "At least I've already had my first time.  They couldn't take that from me."
Harry dropped his head against the wall.  Maybe if he ignored him, Malfoy would go away, and he could be left to deal with things on his own.
Harry knew, whatever Malfoy admitted about his father, that Lucius Malfoy was just as bad as Vernon Dursley, even if he apparently loved his son.
"Even if that
I married Lucius.  For all his faults, Lucius was a brilliant investor, and his wealth more than doubled before we had Draco."
Molly shook her head. "Don't be ridiculous," she scolded. "You're one of my boys.  Of course you'll wear it." She rested her hand on the top of his head. "It's all we have to give you."
And suddenly, the way he was hiding was unacceptable. Harry wanted, no,
Malfoy barked a laugh.  "Potter, you must be joking."  Harry's brow furrowed, and Malfoy stopped laughing.  "You're not joking.  I'm as straight as Pansy is, Potter.  I like men."
"I wanted to know how he convinced you to come back.  I thought you would have left entirely."  She pursed her lips.  "He said you just talked, and then he actually apologized to me."
so very proud of you for being so strong," she said.
Ginny curled her arm around his waist.  "I'll miss you, too.  And if Malfoy hurts you, I'll kick his ass."
"I think you can," Harry breathed. Nothing had ever felt this good before. Nothing had ever felt so
Harry pulled his fingers almost all the way out with a slight twist, surprised at how easily they slid inside even despite the tight clench of the muscle. He licked his lips.
Harry glanced back over his shoulder.  "Don't we need to pay?"
Once they were outside, Ginny slipped her hand through his, tugging him into the fields behind the house.  They walked for a few minutes in companionable silence, nothing but the sounds of crickets and the grass rustling around them.
Harry snorted.  "That'd hardly be fair.  And it doesn't change the fact that I made
Hermione smacked both of their shoulders with a huff.  "
The feel of Malfoy's chest against his back, of strong arms tight around his waist.  The way Charlie Weasley looked, fresh out of the battle.  In hindsight, the way he felt the first time he met Oliver Wood.  The mixed feelings he had about Cedric Diggory.
, feels good, Harry," Draco gasped. "Don't stop."
"Just because I can't see you, doesn't mean I don't know you're there."  Malfoy's voice was cool and smooth, unperturbed.  "This is definitely the hiding place you'd choose."
Kingsley raised his hands.  "I've done all I can, Arthur.  Please believe me."
"There's always the cloak, if you're avoiding the
Narcissa sighed.  "Harry, I suppose you may not know this, but the Malfoys were the wealthiest wizarding family
"This should be private in the first place," Hermione complained.  "Rituals like this are delicate, and they require concentration."
After a long, quiet moment, Hermione broke the silence.  "Did you want to talk about Ginny?"
Harry curled one hand around Draco's cock and slid the lubed one beneath him to begin preparing him.
"Send Roger my regards," Jacqueline said.  She waved them off and disappeared into another room.
, you two."  Harry glanced back at her, but her eyes were on Kingsley.  "It'll be both, obviously," she muttered.
"Loose collar, no lace."  Narcissa graced him with a smile that reached her eyes.  "I'll see it done.  Anything else?"
"Fuck."  Harry paused.  Considered.  "You said we'd have to consummate."
Jacqueline's eyes trailed over him slowly; Harry felt naked under her stare.  He flushed.
"My godson, Teddy, I want to raise him.  He's only about a year old, so I'd rather take over sooner than later."  He shrugged.  "Ginny doesn't want kids now, and she might not ever want them."
Malfoy called them a team, and Harry...  He wanted that, he realized.  Desperately.
"And Ginny doesn't want kids."  Hermione frowned.  "I'm sorry, Harry."
"Durable," Roger noted.  "You'll need a dress pair for your bonding, and an everyday pair."  He nodded to himself.  "Any plans on grand adventures in your future?"
Harry had done little more than set foot inside the Burrow before he was overwhelmed by several voices loudly debating what sounded like Harry's options for the ritual.
"Bedroom?" he asked.
Harry shrugged.  "It was with someone I love.  That's good enough for me."  He leaned his cheek against her hair.  "I wonder if Malfoy ever has."
"The day-to-day details of the arrangement can always be negotiated, but loyalty to one's bondmate is of the utmost importance."
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose.  "I'll meet the others before I decide, but... you're not wrong."  He let out a resigned sigh.  "Total war?"
And then Harry's eyes found Malfoy.
Harry startled.  Arthur thought of him that way, too?
Harry flipped the note over and summoned a quill from across the kitchen.
And then Molly was bustling down the stairs, fussing over their states of dress, tutting at Hermione's wild curls, and frowning over the state of Harry's hair.
Harry nodded.  "Actually, I did have a question.  No one has really...  I get the feeling I'm not being told something about the ritual.  Is there something I'm meant to bring or do, or am I really just repeating words over an altar?"
Harry nodded against her shoulder. "Thanks," he managed around the lump in his throat. His eyes were hot, but he managed to keep himself from crying.
"I'll manage," Harry said.
"Yes, I did."  Malfoy frowned.  "Is that going to be a problem?  It would only be the once, and then you can... resume your relationship with the girl Weasley if that's what you want."
Harry's shoes were removed, and his feet measured, and then Roger and Narcissa were discussing colors and styles and other things Harry didn't understand.
The young man smiled lovingly and tilted his head. “Ebony, I love you! Will you have sex with me?” He said as passionately as if he had asked to marry her.
"Isn't that wonderful.  You'll have Aurors taking care of that horrible Skeeter woman, won't you?" Molly asked.  "Seeing as she constantly harrasses poor Harry?"
His grin gained a bit of life, his eyes flashing with something between amusement and triumph.  "Maybe, but do you have a better one?  If Granger'd found a way out, you wouldn't be here."
His eyes drooped shut, and then, finally, he slept.
"He can be taught!" Jacqueline threw up her arms and resumed gathering fabrics.  "You see now.  I will be fitting you for a full wardrobe when you return, yes?"
"An arranged marriage, really?  What year is this?" Harry muttered.
Harry laughed, louder than he meant to, but some of the tension left him.  "You wish," he said, an echo from another time.
Hermione laughed softly.  "That's true."  She curled her fingers around his hand.  "I wish it could have been with someone you were actually attracted to."
The book was illustrated and pornographic.  The illustrations
"Skeeter's lurking," he said.  "Suggested I bring my cloak.  Do we have an exit plan?"
"Nothing gets past you, huh?"
Narcissa Malfoy stood at his door.  Her robes were true black and neatly pressed, not a hair on her head dared to be out of place.  She looked beautiful and untouchable.
"Are you ready?" she asked, her voice smooth and posh.
"Brilliant," Ron breathed.
"I have."
Harry sighed.  "You know they didn't.  What did you and Malfoy talk about?"
Malfoy's tongue brushed the seam of his lips, and Harry parted for him with another moan.  Malfoy tasted a bit minty, but mostly just like mouth, and Harry couldn't seem to get enough.
Narcissa chuckled.  "Not this time.  He needs dress robes for the bonding."
Draco Malfoy, the only son of the Malfoy line, the boy he once considered his rival, the unmistakable leader of their batch of Slytherins, was now spread beneath him and begging Harry to fuck him.
Molly's eyes flashed, hard and determined.  She patted Harry's head as she turned and strode into the other room.
Malfoy's expression gained an edge to it Harry didn't understand.  "No, Potter.  Marrying for love was never in my cards.  Even if this hadn't come up, I would have little choice in who I marry."
"Wait, what?  But I thought you and she..."
Harry snorted.  Somehow, despite the apparent insults, the tone still felt friendly.  Maybe it really wouldn't be so bad.
Harry tore his gaze away and looked at Kingsley, still the "Interim" Minister for Magic.
Harry looked back at the pairs of people, mind whirling.  Parents and children, and largely Slytherins, based on the faces he only vaguely recognized plus the Malfoys and the Goyles.
?  When was it
"I'll miss you," Harry said.
"Now, let me see how it looks, hm?" Molly asked. She held his arms and gave him a wide smile.
.  We're just trying to make sure you're well informed, Harry!"
Harry blinked.  He pulled out one of the slips of paper with his address on it and handed it to her.  "You can give this to the people you hire for the job."
Her eyes crinkled at the corners in what might pass for a laugh.  "Thank you for trusting me."
Harry thought about it, but shook his head.  "I don't want to look daft, but you'd hardly let me look like an idiot next to your son."
"Of course you have."  Roger turned his attention to Harry.  "Mr. Potter, a pleasure."  His eyes dropped to Harry's feet, and his nose wrinkled.  "You are
She breathed slowly and calmly, but Harry could still see something tight in her eyes.
Narcissa pursed her lips.  "Will you trust me to take care of it?"
The officiant, some much older wizard Harry had never seen before, spoke at length about responsibility and honor and duty for some time.  Harry lost track of it all, unable to really focus on it.
Roger pressed his lips together; Harry thought he might be trying not to laugh.  His eyes had a suspicious shine to them.
"There." Molly cupped his face in both her hands. "You'll find your happiness," she promised, "even if it isn't where you expect it."
Hermione sat beside him, their shoulders pressed together.
Harry snorted.  "Not Charlie?"
Narcissa paused and turned to take him in.  Harry tried to stand tall under her scrutiny.  She nodded once.
Molly held him close. "I know I couldn't take you in when you were younger, but you will always be one of my boys, Harry. Don't you forget that. We'll support you, even if it means accepting a Malfoy as an in-law."
"Bet you he asks you to pose for the papers," George said under his breath.
was getting married.
"So the bonding must be?  Kingsley, Harry deserves to have this moment be a private one and you know it.  Have the Aurors clear a path, or we'll be taking drastic measures."  Arthur's voice was harsher than Harry had ever heard it.
your friend, so I thought I might be a better target."
He tucked himself into the first alcove he found and cast as many spells as he could think of to make people walk past him.  He hated the cold wet eggy feeling of the disillusionment charm taking effect, but without his Cloak, it couldn't be helped.
"You're assuming I'll choose
Malfoy snorted.  "I think that makes you sane, honestly.  I felt similarly when Mother told me what the Wizengamot had decided, and then what
Harry didn't know about that, but obediently sat back down as they resumed their discussion about the dress shoes.
Harry laughed and obeyed. The first thrust had Draco sliding up the bed; Draco keened.
"Of course not, Harry, no one could possibly ask for more from you."
Maybe he'd never liked girls at all if this was what a man felt like.  "I want you to." Harry shifted his aim, ever so slightly.  "Please, Draco?"
Finally they were in the lift and on their way down to the proper floor.  Harry pulled his hood back with a sigh.
Harry threw a hand out for a quill and some paper.  At least this gave him something to do.  He grabbed a book off his nightstand and spread his paper out.
Harry laughed, hands dropping to hold Malfoy's hips.  His blood thrummed with magic and energy, and his cock throbbed.
Harry hummed.  George and Ron nudged his shoulders with a wink and an eyeroll respectively.  Hermione squeezed his hand.
"Thank you for letting me do this, Harry."  Narcissa touched his shoulder again.  "I know this is all happening very quickly.  Normally, you and Draco would be given more time to adjust to the match."
Harry let his eyes fall shut.  He was so tired.  "I can't do this again, Hermione," he admitted.  "I'm not going to keep sacrificing myself for the rest of the world.  I told Kingsley that if they volunteer me again, I'll refuse no matter the consequences."
Draco squirmed. "That was
"Silver lining," Hermione allowed.  "I'm so sorry, Harry.  I wish..."
He was getting
Kingsley led him down the line, introducing him to each of them.  Harry made a point of memorizing each face and each name, intent on seeing their willingness to make the sacrifice honored.
"What?"  Harry faltered, confusion overwhelming the anger.  "Why would she do that?"
Harry tried to guess how much money that meant, but couldn't picture it.
"Merlin, and here I thought the whole school knew.  All of Slytherin did."  He ran a hand through his hair, mussing it entirely.
against the window startled him out of his spiral.  An eagle owl was sitting on the sill, an envelope held in its beak.
