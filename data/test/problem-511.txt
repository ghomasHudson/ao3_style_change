Harry sighed “Look, guys, I appreciate the effort. I really do. But I don’t want to go back to a world in which everything I did was in the front page of a journal, in which I am judged by everything I did by everyone. In which I am not truly free.” He took a deep breath “But here? I am completely free here, I am happier than I have ever been. I have a home, a true home, and a family. I…don’t want to give that up for a world I gave everything for but that gave so little back.”
“Harry… it might be because of your harpy heritage. I read when a harpy goes under a lot of stress and gets traumatized, it might rely more on its basics instincts, you would stop thinking like an ordinary human and would begin thinking more like… an animal…” Hermione said. She feared Harry would lose himself to his harpy heritance, and saying what could happen, and what was probably happening, out loud only terrified her more “Harry, are you okay? After everything we went through, it would be surprising to say you are fine.”
“Calm down, Ron.” She said, putting down her book, an exasperated sigh leaving her lips “I thought we had more time…”
The brightness of the room hurt his eyes, his whole body ached and his throat was tight. It was like the time the twins convinced him drink half a bottle of fire whiskey with them. It wasn´t very pleasant.
The next day, Harry woke up from his nap and noticed something was off; there was a different smell in the air, one that didn’t belong to an animal or to a plant.
“It’s great to see you guys.” Harry said from the dinner table with his youngest, Lily, on his lap, her long dark hair being braided.
The pain began when the clock showed that it was no longer the day before, but that it was then july 31th, the day Harry Potter was born eighteen years before. The excruciating pain began at the base of his toes, and quickly spread though his whole body. The only way to explain what he was feeling would be that Harry was being lowered in lava.
“Yes” Hermione answered “The Potter family seems to have some harpy blood, but it was diluted along the generations. So it jumped a lot of your ancestors, and it ended up affecting you.”
“Oh My… Ron, I think Malfoy wants to court Harry!” She answered. She couldn’t be more surprised, for that was
And then, everything felt fine, he felt like the world was in complete order, unlike the days right after he killed Voldemort, in which he felt like the peace everybody worked so hard to build could crumble at any moment. He was at peace.
He called Draco and they went to their nest, he got in position and began laying his egg. It was painful in a way he had never thought would be possible. His mate’s hand was almost breaking when the egg came out and Harry finally could rest. He laid down on the nest and watched his mate care for their egg, cleaning it and putting between they so it could be warm.
“You’ve had a lot of wine tonight,” Draco says dumbly, because he doesn’t know how to react to the idea of Harry actually loving him.
Harry mouths the words back, or so Draco thinks he does, before pulling away and laying beside Draco, right where he belongs.
Harry does. Pulling out slowly, leaving only the head of his cock inside, before driving his hips towards Draco.
The first time I saw him, after we were both ready to set aside the past, he was working on a protection charm, and I watched for longer than I’d like to admit. There was no sign of the famed War injury in his devilish focus, his elbows stabilized in braces on the workbench as he toiled over a tiny metal pendant, enameling charms onto the surface like glass on copper. I knew it was protection magic from the smell, like peppermint and hospitals, sterile, stabile, and something else too.
“I’m perfectly fine, my sweet. You know I’m very fond of the gardens,” Narcissa’s warm smile is like the sun, replacing the coldness that has formed within Draco’s heart.
Harry is the first one to confess his love for Draco, of course. He was always better with words than him.
Lying here beside him, the scent of Dreamless still on Harry’s breath, and the shining mid-morning light across his chest, his hands are like aged bronze statuary, history etched across them like acid rain erosions. There’s my favorite freckle, two shades browner than his skin, right at the tip of his wand finger, which I imagine kissing anytime I see it. But I wouldn’t want him to know I’ve noticed such a thing.
All Draco can do is look at Harry in disbelief, unconsciously mouthing the words back at him. It isn’t a lie, but Draco isn’t exactly ready to say it back, even though Harry knows Draco has already loved him from the very beginning.
After a failed attempt to stop the tears from falling from his eyes, Draco leaves the bathroom with a heavy heart, casting a couple of moisturising charms to at least rehydrate his skin.
Draco turns his head to be met by the glorious sight of Harry peering down at him with utmost adoration in his eyes. Before Draco can ruin the moment with a snarky comment, Harry’s hands settle on the flesh of his arse.
I wonder what a proper palmister would profess about his future, about our future. Staring down at them, I want to imagine his heartline full and long, not only for the potential of our life together but for the very fact that Harry gives his heart freely and easily. There’s a deep crack across his life-line. He told me the story once, so late at night the sky was dishwater grey, said it into the pillow and the ceiling in the tight voice he reserves for talking about the War.
She saw a flash of the old Draco in how he poured their tea, raising the pot higher and higher until Pansy was sure he would spill. But it wasn’t the same as when he’d levitate the Malfoy silver until she snorted into her petit-four.
“Give off, Malfoy,” Harry said. He could barely see out of his fogged glasses. “I’ve won! You haven’t even touched the snitch. We’re on the ground and I have the snitch. I won.”
“See you boys in the morning,” Minerva said, her eyes twinkling, even in the shadow of her wide-brimmed pointed hat. Harry narrowed his eyes at her.
The judges conferred, then Edna withdrew the third-place ribbon. A buzzing filled his ears. No one turned towards him, so it wasn’t his. Then second place. Again, nothing.
“Actually,” Ron said, his eyes lighting up, “Mione mentioned that she was craving salad caprese. So I’ve been thinking—” and here he made a kind of rainbow gesture with his hands, “Caprese with green mango.”
“Hermione Granger,” the tweed woman said, sticking her hand out. Narcissa raised an eyebrow at it, because her hands were currently tied behind her back. “Sorry, didn’t—the key problem, Mrs. Malfoy Black—”
“Oh, no, no, no, no, no,” she whispered, pressing her hands together and then against her eyes and then together.
She practically collapsed into the empty seat in the Great Hall. Jesus, was she going to have to become one of those teachers who wore clogs?
Draco huffed. “Fine, Potter, maybe a concerned parent who just happens to be a cat burglar took it and they’ll throw this cursed necklace at me in the Great Hall.” He still didn’t seem terribly bothered.
“They could afford it, though,” Astoria realized. Lavender raised her eyebrows and did a kind of sideways head-bob that Astoria read as tentative agreement.
Lawyers working on it, etc., but I thought, the smartest witch of her age probably has some amazing ideas that the crusty old robes haven’t thought of (or might never think of, Merlin, the hourly billing I’ve been getting).
“HARRY AND DRACO ARE HERE, DROMMY!” Teddy yelled, wrapping his arms around both of them. “THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS!”
Andre handed him a small green glass jar marked with spindly handwriting. “My grandmother makes it,” he said. “She knew your grandda and I think she ripped off Sleekeazy a bit. Well, more like tweaked it a bit for more textured hair.” He shrugged. “She’s completely unrepentant and she doesn’t make money off it, so, please, even though you’re the heir, don’t sue us.”
She’d washed her hands of it when the revolution didn’t come, and buried herself in her books because that was where her power lay—a renewable power, that is—and she was the first, she was doing the best, she was working so hard. And Harry was doing what they did best: organizing and teaching and inspiring.
, he told himself over and over. Ron and Hermione hadn’t written him back. Tangled in his sheets. Sweating. His hands hadn’t stopped sweating. He ripped his pajama top off. He rested his head against the window. It fogged. The Black Lake shimmered in the moonlight.
Incomplete 7th year from Hogwarts; client raised an eyebrow at my suggestion of vocational training but did not remove his gaze from the ocean one can see out the window of this really quite grim little office they have here.
Neville was still standing squarely in front of Blaise. Like he was protecting him from the Malfoy on the steps of their castle; Blaise barely had time to shake himself for that ridiculously romantic thought before Neville had turned and muttered, “Are you ok, babe?”
“Uh, you know,” she said, because what do you say to your high school boyfriend who just got out of prison? Everything she thought of—her mandated charity work, her parents’ divorce, the bakery—seemed simultaneously dramatic, bland, pitiful, and delusional. There wasn’t anything that could summarize eight years.
He looked old, shifting from foot to foot beside Neville, his hands almost vibrating with the suppressed urge to fiddle. He’d been a bit of a tit, but, what kid brought up to pureblood nonsense would turn out with an ounce of sense? And they’d all been complicit in that, letting the wounds of unchallenged hatred fester. She ground her teeth.
Malfoy’s grey eyes were boring into his, daring Harry to say something cruel in response. Harry wanted to ask how a fucking blood purist could be so seemingly confident in his identity as a gay man. But what came out was,
“No need to thank me,” Ron said, “Just a small banner with ‘sponsored by the brains of Ronald B. Weasley,’ on the front of the podium, like.”
“My father found me and Theo Nott when I was fifteen. It was—” Malfoy shrugged his shoulders gently—“unforgiveable, apparently. The last of the Malfoys, a disgusting fag. My mother had to Crucio him to get him to stop beating me. She hid his wand for weeks. She convinced Voldemort that I was more use alive. That they could use me to get to you.”
Hermione and I have done a bunch of research about this problem and we’re quite sure we’ve come up with a solution, or a solution that we’re 86.7% sure will release them from the contract. Not great odds. 100% would be the best, but, fuck those lawyers. They were really good. In an evil way.
Turning it over in his fingers, Harry saw it was a silver cigarette case—a bit battered and dented and with a complicated family crest.
Sirius slammed a platter of French toast down on the table. “Bon appetit, my most beloved godchild and my favorite sexy werewolf doctor husband.”
“And that just leaves Rubeus and Pomona to the third-floor corridor and Harry and Padma get the dungeons.”
“What are you doing lurking about in hallways?” Padma said, a bit more slowly than usual. Ah, they’d been drinking.
Audrey’s eyes were wide and determined and she said in an undertone, “I can feel an Alina outburst all over this … must have ended up in the closet somehow … and then we didn’t know where …” she waved one hand at the other three and went back into the kitchen.
It was almost like the git could apparate inside the castle. Or maybe he just walked really fast and really silently. That seemed like the kind of skill you’d pick up if you had to live with Voldemort and his intimates.
He shot a piercing look at Blaise, then turned and followed Neville, without a single comment. Blaise stood in the doorway. There was a warmth suffusing him that had nothing to do with the growing heat of the day.
Luckily, before she had to try to explain non-magical particle physics (gravity had almost led to a familial schism two years ago), they heard the front door open and cheerful shouts filtered through the house. Hermione, snow melting in her hair, Ron, his freckled cheeks red with the cold, and Harry, cheerful red and green glitter splashed across their eyelids, entered the living room laden with presents.
“I’m a cool dad,” Bill said poutily. He pulled her hair gently and she shifted until she was laying on top of him. He smelled like whiskey and cinnamon, and she looked up at his neck, the white outline of the scars and the ginger bristles glowing in the fairy lights, and he was all hers.
“Good to see you, Draco,” Sirius said. He tilted the whiskey, swirling the melting ice with the amber liquid.
Shooting him a sideways glance, Malfoy said in a tone of studied ease, “Yes, my second book is coming out later this year. Florian wanted to go over the proofs, and why he won’t just send them by owl is beyond me.”
The therapist had suggested she counter with more positivity. The therapist also wore linen well into November.
was a disaster; Marcus tore his rotator cuff battering a bludger during a Wanderers’ friendly against the Magpies (the Magpies made it even worse), and it quickly became clear that his days as a beater were over. (Let the record state that Oliver was even more depressed than his husband who’d just suffered a career-ending injury.)
Florian Fortescue had grown up spending summers in his grandfather’s ice cream parlor. Florean. He was a Florian. Because the nurse didn’t believe his mum.
The rest of the faculty burst into questions, but Harry’s head was buzzing from Draco’s backhanded compliment.
Then they were stumbling back through the hallways, hissing at each other to be quiet and not wake up the students, muffling drunken giggles. Harry kept trying to yell, and Draco kept sort of leaping up to try to put his hand over Harry’s mouth, and Harry was taller but Draco was faster.
“I’ll give it back to you,” Draco said, straining to sit up without dislodging his arm from around Astoria’s shoulders. He was practically vibrating.
Arthur waited a moment, then said slowly, “He was just a boy, it’s true. Even if he could have made better choices.”
Yeah, whatever that meant. Why did Andre keep bringing up Malfoy? (Why did Harry keep bringing up Malfoy?) Harry stuttered out his thanks and downed the rest of his cocoa. He paused for a minute looking at a few snapshots of Andre holding a baby and Audrey peering over his shoulder, an older black woman handing a cup to Andre (they were both dressed in Pride of Portree jerseys), Andre with a ginger man and Oliver Wood—
Harry raised his eyebrows and ran his hands through his hair. Perry was really going to have to pay more attention if he wanted to pass the O.W.L. He was almost sure Perry had some kind of learning disorder, but as far as he knew, wizards didn’t seem to recognize alternative learning strategies, though that was definitely why his classes were mostly discussion and hands-on activities. Too much lecturing disadvantaged kids who struggled with paying attention. “Britney?”
“Harry,” she said, interrupting Ron’s flailed reenactment of some maneuver connected to the latest Cannons’ match because he’d done the same thing for her about fifty times last Saturday while yelling and jumping around in the living room. “Have you come across anything about marriage contracts and queer wizards in your research for the book?”
Minerva said with a smile, “Since we all will be chaperoning, I’m sure we can break up any of the more inappropriate maneuvers. If necessary, I’m sure a simple
I retain ownership of a coconut that you won in the shy coconuts game. “Game,” really. Lobbing a coconut at other coconuts seems to lack any kind of critical skill. You should have been a Chaser with that kind of arm.
Thank you for inviting me to your house. Your demonstration of the various corners of the internet was fascinating.
Luckily they were back to the thumping beat of Eminem before Harry could consider how he’d just asked Malfoy to dance and danced to a slow dance with him and he’d thought about Malfoy’s eyelashes, which was definitely not on, so he’d just go over there and separate Justin and Perry (he knew it!) who were making out quite vigorously and rubbing against each other frantically (“Less action,” Harry barked, tapping Perry on the shoulder with his wand)—who had approved of this music?! He had. Right. This was being hoisted by his own petard. Well and truly hoisted.
I reviewed the incident with Peggy, who was on desk at the time, and she said that you were extremely embarrassed, confused, and contrite about what happened at the library last Friday, indicating that what happened was clearly an accident. In the future, I would strongly recommend turning the volume off or wearing headphones before playing any video. Otherwise, books with the call numbers beginning 306.7 (sexual relations) might be a good place to start your research. As always, if you need help finding resources or have research questions, our staff is always available. The library is a safe space for all kinds of (quiet) research.
Harry held up his hands. “What, what, what?” They were following the syllabus exactly, and this week they were doing Shakespeare. Were these the sixth years? No, no, there were Justin and Perry arguing quietly in the back of the classroom, and Elspeth was definitely a fifth year. She’d been coming in after classes to discuss the Muggle Studies O.W.L. since the second day of school. She was positive that since she’d been born into a wizarding family in Hong Kong, she was doubly disadvantaged regarding British Muggle life. Harry had tried hinting to her that she needn’t worry because he was the one who’d rewritten the O.W.L. for the Ministry over the summer and therefore knew the test backwards and forwards.
As far as I remember the session, Draco didn’t actually say anything the entire time. Which was odd, because he’s usually … willing to share his views.
“Harry,” Ron said with a sigh, “please take a breath. It’s going to be ok. It’s just a B&E—it’s got nothing to do with Hogwarts or Voldemort or anything. This is like, low-level shit.”
Luckily, Andre answered the door. He was wearing a midnight-blue silk robe and had a mug of hot chocolate in one hand.
Then Blaise arrived, Draco pressed handouts with the general outline of the event into their hands and
He realized the fourth time that he’d forgotten to give Draco his Christmas present—the latest Tana French mystery—so the fifth time, he knocked, and left the wrapped tome outside Draco’s door when it became clear Draco wouldn’t answer.
He had a sudden flashback to finding Malfoy in the bathroom, sobbing into the sink. He’d been so pale then, and so skinny, and his whole frame had been wracked with his sobs. It had sounded like Malfoy was retching. And then Harry had—and then he’d used Sectumsempra, without even knowing—and then there was blood everywhere—and Harry had something in his eyes now and was blinking furiously. He wasn’t going to take his glasses off. That would be admitting he was crying. At himself. In Ron and Hermione’s bathroom.
“I mean, you’re a good man,” Luna said, “and it makes sense that you care. You’re a very caring person, Neville.”
Malfoy straightened his sleeves. “I hardly think pre-groping is appropriate at a school dance.” He cleared his throat. God, maybe he
“Oh, no, please,” he said, and shifted to awkwardly wrap one arm around her. She turned her face against his chest and sobbed. “Don’t cry.”
Yes. I’ll be in Northumberland for another two months and would like to request the ability to keep working with Draco for plant collection. He was amenable to this suggestion when I proposed it (if, of course, MoM approves). I have a grant that could pay hourly minimum wage, so if there is some kind of employment credit or part of Draco’s rehabilitation/probation process, I would be willing to fill out whatever paperwork is necessary.
“I don’t think we need to demonstrate,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “I think they can figure out what it’s for, generally speaking.”
Harry started seeing black spots swimming across his vision, and then Malfoy’s breathing sounded very far away, and then it was just black.
Blaise fought the urge to roll his eyes. Of course he was feeling the same. What kind of idiot wouldn’t want to spend all day kissing Neville. That couldn’t even be a rhetorical question. It was so obvious.
“Ginny and I broke up when I was nineteen. She and Luna got together a couple of months later. We—I mean, me and Ginny—we tried sleeping together and it was just awful. The kissing was fine but then, you know, she’s just more like a sister to me, and it turns out she’s also very, very into women, so it was a bit dry and all, and anyway–” Why was this all coming out to Malfoy, of all people? Even Ron and Hermione didn’t know about the disastrous sex attempt. They didn’t ask. He didn’t tell them. No, it was fine. It was all fine. This was fine. Here he was divulging intimate details to Draco Malfoy.
“This isn’t, uh,” Ron said. He was holding his chocolate ice cream (well, his chocolate and Seville orange ice cream with a swirl of bittersweet fudge, and a chocolate waffle cone, because Ron was a chocoholic, God what a gross word though) with a concerned expression on his face.
Malfoy had one hand on the brass knob. A silver ring glinted in the light from the candles along the staircase. Harry felt he shouldn’t leave without giving Malfoy a warning. That he was watching him. That he’d know if he got up to something tonight, or any night.
But after a friend approached her about brewing a potion to help their lover rekindle their sexual desire after a magical fire mishap, Vane began to reconsider. “They saw me together and explained how this accident had caused some physical or chemical barriers that they didn’t totally understand, but that neither of them could feel the sexual excitement they used to experience, even though both of them desperately wanted to. They wanted something that would help those feelings and emotions re-blossom.”
He moved around the kitchen slowly, doing everything by hand instead of using the wand that was clearly—up his sleeve? He used to wear it there, she remembered, flushing as she was thrown back to kissing him against the damp stone wall of the common room.
He laughed at his reflection. Same wild hair, same thin-rimmed round glasses, same scars. Same tall, skinny frame—he was now suspecting that he’d never put on weight, despite a heavy diet of treacle tarts and steak and kidney pie since he arrived in August.
“Well,” Sirius said, “we’re going to have a quiet Christmas Eve, just me and Remus and some of our presents—”
“My parents died when I was little,” Harry said, and then felt shitty for mentioning it. “But it’s nice knowing I look like both of them.”
She couldn’t keep his schedule straight. There was the non-magical class, some other thing about being anti-blood purity, the thing with Neville. She knew she should be properly tracking all this shit, but he still couldn’t leave the house unaccompanied and he didn’t even have a wand.
brief overview of non-magical medical treatments), genes/genotypes/phenotypes/DNA (and the recent research into the presence of magical genes that remain unexpressed in non-magic users), gender and sexuality, and some of the contemporary beauty standards (and more importantly, stereotypes) that pervade in the non-magical world. The last isn’t my favorite part, but MoM demands it, because this class is
Malfoy reached into his robes and withdrew a monogrammed handkerchief. Dabbing his eyes, he said, fighting to talk through his laughter, “I didn’t realize you thought about my ass so much during Quidditch.”
“Loons, you’ve gotten a letter from Nev!” she shouted to her better half, who was probably doing something mysterious and potentially dangerous with her eyebrows in the bathroom. She’d been in there too long at a not-pooing time.
Talbott considered this for a moment, and then shrugged. “So,” he said casually, “I’ll kill either of you if you mention it to anyone,” and Harry felt the magical air shift around the couch, and he knew it was some variant of an unbreakable vow. Talbott’s red eyes bored into him.
She walked across the room to where Harry had frozen, looked down into his tea cup, wrinkled her nose at his milky brew, and then looked straight up and him and hissed, “If you fucking hurt him, I’ll kill you.”
Minerva took off her hat and rubbed her forehead. Hagrid was sputtering and insisting that the slugs didn’t mean to hurt anyone.
“No worries, mate,” Neville said. He squeezed Blaise’s gloved hand, wrangled their conjoined hands into his pocket, then held out his other arm to Draco. “Let’s go.”
Narcissa pressed her fingers to her temples. The ceremonial room at the Manor flickered in and out of her memories. “It—they’re going to have to stay together for a day and a night,” she said, remembering Carteret’s intonations.
It was completely untenable to live like this, Harry thought as the Easter holidays drew to a close. He’d spent a week housesitting for Ron and Hermione, who’d fucked off to Ibiza (and not invited him, he thought crossly), and when he’d returned to Hogwarts, he’d been ordering all his food to his room, panicking about running into Draco in a studentless castle. Each time he saw him, he was filled with the most horribly animalistic desires—and Harry was terrified, terrified that he’d hurt Draco, that Draco didn’t want him, that Draco could somehow read his mind and see all the depraved things Harry wanted to do to him, with him.
The thumping started again, then there was a bit of crashing in his room, and fuck, maybe she’d overdone it once again.
Teddy flew up to him, grabbing his arm in a clumsy dismount, and gave Harry a long look. “You and Uncle Draco have the same Patronus species,” he said seriously. “Drommy told me that’s something that happens when you get married.”
“So he’s coming up this weekend. I tried to make the cottage a bit more … sophisticated? He was in Prague for a few years after the war, and I don’t know what he’d think of—”
Even the other faculty and staff seemed to be buzzing with excitement. He looked around and noted each of his peers, from Filius and Pomona at the far end, to the nattily-dressed Flying instructor Andre Egwu, deep in discussion with Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and Head of Hufflepuff Audrey Oliver-Winger, a plump woman with a tangle of silvery hair escaping from a crown of braids and flowers, just about the last person anyone would assume had experience in the Dark Arts. They had been at Hogwarts together in Charlie’s year and were as thick as thieves. Mr. and Mrs. Hardbroom, the head of the hospital wing and the librarian respectively, conferred with Mervyn Pentangle, who taught Divination. Bastian Khan, the Head of Slytherin and current Professor of Ancient Runes, seemed to be lecturing transfiguration professor Adelaide Murton. She rested her chin on one hand and twirled one of her long braids around her finger and nodded occasionally. Bastian had passed the coaching role of Slytherin’s Quidditch team over to Addie at the end of last year, and he still had very definite ideas.
“Just because a lot of wizards and witches have a hard time accepting that not everyone’s as straight as a fucking board doesn’t mean these kids should think they’re abnormal—”
Harry decided to overlook that statement and said, “I thought you gave me Sirius’s cigarette case. I just thought it was stuck closed. I didn’t know it did anything.”
Susan had been several lines ahead, to where Neville had outlined his search methods, and that, frankly, was where the entire problem lay, because you couldn’t just set out to look for a phellodendron. They could tell you were coming. You had to wander around with nothing in your head except a general admiration of nature’s beauty and then, bam! They’d stop feeling shy and lower their chlorophyll levels enough for their crystalline iridescence to shine.
“So, what, exactly, did you learn with Professor Malfoy? Elspeth, let’s let someone else give the summarized version—Perry?”
“There wasn’t much time for introspection during the war, but I spent some time in London and hashing stuff out with Harry, who was working towards understanding their gender identity, and I realized I was asexual.”
Harry undid the bands and opened it. There were magical duplications of documents written in spindly old handwriting, a magical photograph of a dignified and elderly couple labeled “Monty and Effie”—were those his grandparents?— and snippets from the Daily Prophet and other wizarding newspapers, all about the Potdar family and then the Potter family, his parents’ wedding announcement, and—
Three hours later, after a spirited argument with Filius regarding the relative merits of CDs versus the Frog Choir (“nothing can compare to the bass of synchronized croaking!”) and an off-key bellowing of Happy Birthday (to which Alina sat, smiling, with her fingers in her ears, before blowing out her candles), he and Draco had managed to conceal themselves in the invisibility cloak inside the Oliver-Winger’s front closet.
He was in a nice, but worn, black robe, which, with his hair tucked behind his ears, reminded her of when she’d first seen him in his Hogwarts robes at age eleven, prancing around the Manor lording it over her that she wouldn’t be going to school until next year. And fuck, that reminded her of the marriage contract, but now was really not the place or time, because Draco seemed a few roses short of a bouquet at the moment.
“Such an important question,” Hermione said with a broad smile. Shuo’s shoulders relaxed. “It was hard to convince Ronald of the relative merits of muggle condoms, but he wasn’t ready to be a father at seventeen, and once I told him it was condoms or abstinence, he got on board pretty quickly. Luckily, nowadays, condoms are relatively well-known and understood in the wizarding world. I think it’s maybe a bit more complicated for me as we’re approaching the decision of when we want to have kids. In the muggle world, it’s pretty physically damaging to the mother’s body, but as you know, in the wizarding world, while anyone can carry a child, it has typically been a female role. And then, add on decades of patriarchal oppression in both worlds, and it’s a risky prospect for a woman’s health and career. In a heterosexual relationship, the woman is expected to stay at home with the kids.”
“Oh, damn,” Harry said. He felt a bit daft, standing in the snow with his feet starting to get damp and his hands on Draco’s hips. Maybe he should move them back up again. But that would be admitting that they’d slid down.
Addie leapt to her feet and attempted to transfigure the canaries into paper planes, but they seemed to retain a malicious capacity and drove the students from the hall. Padma couldn’t stop giggling and slapping her knee (which Harry had never, ever seen her do).
Harry snorted, flipped a piece of French toast onto their plate, and was reaching for the syrup when Sirius yelped, “The fucking icing sugar!” He levitated it over to the table and released a powdery cloud.
“No, no, it’s fine, don’t worry.” Harry panicked. It was supposed to be a casual invitation. But why was Draco blushing? Did he think it meant something more? Did he think Harry wanted to thank him in some lewd way? Just inviting him up and dropping to his knees and—Harry blinked a few times.
“You,” Harry said, poking a finger into Malfoy’s (well-muscled) shoulder. His robes were quite soft and a midnight blue. Definitely stretch velvet, the way they caressed his biceps and then Harry’s mouth was saying, “are very confusing and also you look nice, so there's that.”
What he did instead was cough and stand up. Pull his sleeves down over his hands. Bang his shin. Lurch over. Curse.
“It’s not!” she said, and stamped her foot. Whether it was a stupid English thing or a Weasley family thing made no difference. It wasn’t real.
Audrey blinked at Draco several times and wound a long strand of silvery hair around her index finger. “Oh, my dear. How did you think I got this job?”
Harry looked up to find the table empty and Minerva striding out of the Great Hall. To preserve his dignity he chose not to run after her.
Malfoy looked taken aback. “Crushing you? Muscular thighs?” He blushed. “Barely, Potter, I tackled you.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Fuck off, Potter. One, I can find whatever I need, and two, I tip the elves extra extra at Christmas.”
“Always pessimistic, Chang,” Ollie said with a quirk of his eyebrow. “Was it growing up in Ireland in the 90s?”
I’ll ask Andy if I can bring you over to my apartment so I can show you on the computer. Explaining it in writing would take too long.
“I believe Professor Malfoy is referring to one of my more, uh, practical lessons regarding contemporary Muggle life,” Harry said smoothly. He pushed his chair away from the table, stood, and shrugged out of his robes before stalking over to stand behind Malfoy.
Hermione looked a bit confused for a moment, and then swung back into focus with more facts about diaphragms and spermicides.
“Yes,” Harry said. “You’re—” and then he was stuck. He couldn’t exactly say, I want you there, and he also couldn’t say you’re a flamboyantly gay man, and we haven’t got one of those at the meetings because Bastian is polyam and Mervyn is about one thousand years old and I don’t know think he even knows students have clubs, but Harry didn’t want him to think he just wanted to tick off the “gay man” box or something, and then his thoughts were getting all twisted and too much time had passed so he just. Left it there.
She tried to keep her voice even because Harry hadn’t grown up with parents so of course they’d imprint on the first adult who was even kind of nice, but, Jesus fucking Christ, she wished they’d imprinted on Hagrid. Sure, he wasn’t super responsible, but at least he wasn’t actively leading Harry down a cryptic path towards death.
Her face lit up and she said, “Thank you, Professor Malfoy,” and then buried her face in the book, flipping to chapter five immediately. Harry felt a hand on his elbow steering him towards the drinks table.
Harry rolled his eyes. “What, are you biphobic or something? Don’t think bi is gay enough? Think I ought to be ashamed?” He was enjoying Malfoy’s flustered expression. “I did think the third puff was a bit low, but Luna assured me that my uh, lower torso would increase sales. I’m still not sure about that, but, you know, gotta please Luna.”
Sirius levitated Harry’s mug away from him. “I’ve got a kettle on the boil now,” he said with a half-exasperated, half-loving sigh that always settled Remus’ heart. “You know he can’t taste for shit so he always burns the coffee and then—”
Potter takes a sip of the lemongrass-flavored water with a rueful expression. “I’ve kind of given up, honestly. It’s really hard to meet people like, normally, and I don’t know if I’d want to subject anyone else to this level of public scrutiny. I’d love to find a partner, but that doesn’t seem like it’s in the cards right now. I have too much shit to do, anyway.”
“Fucking love, dude.” Harry cracked his knuckles. “That’s what saved me. My mum, she loved me so much, Voldemort’s Avada Kedavra couldn’t hit me. That’s what the scar’s from,” he said, pushing his hair up.
“I’m not giving it you until you sit up,” he said with a cross look at Harry’s slouched form. “You’ll spill all over the couch and then it’ll be even worse than it is now.”
“And Kreacher can’t put in any Black family trivia,” Draco said suddenly. “It’s impossible to mime the Great Division of the 1878 Railroad Wand Incident.”
Harry buttered his toast and glanced about for Malfoy. He shouldn’t be expecting him. He never came to breakfast. Anticipation of the first match that thrummed in his veins. A good spar with Malfoy spiced up a Quidditch match like nothing else. But he’d promised Padma to give Malfoy a chance. Whatever that meant.
Harry looked … about the same as usual: frazzled, slightly irate, and fidgety. Their hair was a little limp with grease, their trainers were scuffed, and their flannel was pulled down over their hands. They bit their lip on one side and squinted one eye at Hermione.
was great, except Hufflepuff was already first in the school Quidditch tourney. We’re impartial, though, so, good job, Puffs!
Draco opened his mouth, tilted his head, closed his mouth, tilted his head a different direction. He took the iPod out of his pocket and then said unconvincingly, “It’s out of battery.”
Leaning back into the cushions, he waited until the deluge of questions—and Ron’s chanting “I knew it!” over and over—settled a bit and then he held up his hands.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Harry said and then continued in Parseltongue, “I can speak two languages too, Malfoy, so up yours.”
“It’s just,” Astoria mumbled between sobs, “I burn Susan wherever I touch her, and when you touch me, it’s like a golden glow. But I don’t want it.”
“I, er... Neville suggested that it might be a good... you know... I didn’t finish my NEWTs and I’m a felon... so, well, anyway, you don’t need a degree... It’s just a set of tests.”
Harry could hardly stand still the day of Alina’s birthday party. Audrey hadn’t been acting any differently; her dot was always in logical places on the map; he and Draco had both made it through several weeks without having any encounters with cursed jewelry. They’d been spending evenings in the library searching for sex-related necklaces in the former Restricted Section, now open to all students, except for the really dangerous books, which Mrs. Hardbroom kept in little cages behind the reference desk; they hunched over desks and whispered to each other until late into the night. It felt a bit like a research project with Hermione.
“For years, there’s been debate among the animal rights community whether it’s appropriate to ride dragons,” he says, throwing a chunk of meat in a corral. “But since dragons don’t speak human, and we haven’t unraveled the finer details of the korak-roar, eagle moan, or Farnese shriek, human scientists have few methods of delving into dragon psychology. Once you see things from their perspective, their behavior starts making more sense.”
“Ah,” said Malfoy with a raised eyebrow, “It tends to be more literal in the wizarding world. When one says ass,” he gestured with one hand, his silver ring glinting in the sunlight, “one tends to mean it.”
Gesturing at the tomato, which Malfoy hurriedly wiped away with his hand, he shrugged. “You know, cooking, cleaning, gardening, whatever. When they let me out.”
“Potter, do you think the Slug Club is a name that would succeed in the real world? No, but at least it has panache. It’s the assonance.”
“Essays due on Hamlet’s characterization next class. Two feet.” Grumbling ensued, but they all filed out and left Harry in silence. Twirling his quill, he hunched over his desk and began to plan.
“I thought this was going to be more of a dance scene,” she said and pushed herself into a sitting position. “It’s like, canapes and talking about the economy.”
Harry stumbled backwards, spilling tea all over his arm, just as Draco swanned in with a cry of surprise.
Harry’s alarm blared again and Ulula started screeching in protest. He groped around for his sports gear. He didn’t have Quidditch leathers anymore, just joggers and trainers, but he did have the Nimbus 2005, so Malfoy could suck on that.
Draco listened—fuck, Harry had forgotten about the fingers in the mouth bit, that was a bit weird—and he closed his eyes and nodded along as the beat picked up.
She opened her eyes. Harry was resplendent in some kind of glittering mesh top and high-waisted black pants. A definite look. Harry understood sparkles.
Hermione untangled herself and pressed a kiss onto the top of Harry’s head. “You don’t; when’s the last time you took a proper bath?”
“Va te faire enculer,” Narcissa spat and struggled to right herself. The ropes binding her legs suddenly released and she glanced around.
Talbott barked out a laugh. “I believe Dr. Malfoy has done more than enough to mend his previous errors. Though I’m not too sure about the several chapters on poisons in the copy of
Harry saw the flecks of gold in his grey eyes. Malfoy’s eyelashes were so long and almost clear? How had he never noticed that before? How was it possible to have hair that didn’t seem to have any color? A woody scent wafted across the six inches between them. Harry’s mouth went dry. He attempted to swallow.
Draco blinked rapidly. “It’s not, it’s not—Mr. Lupin didn’t—” he dropped his voice to a whisper, “curse Sirius?”
“Hug?” Andy asked, suddenly afraid that she’d overstepped. Let him reestablish the boundaries. She wasn’t going to feel bad if he didn’t want one. She wouldn’t. She would be an adult about it all.
Malfoy’s eyes were wide with innocence and—oh shit. Too much innocence. Too much fucking innocence and he’d fucking planned this. Malfoy pressed his lips together, but he couldn’t stop the corners of his mouth quirking up in a shit-eating grin. Well, two could play at that game. Malfoy may be underhanded, but Harry had sass Malfoy could only dream of.
But then when they’d accidentally catch each other’s eyes at a faculty meeting, Draco would turn crimson. And that seemed to indicate something else.
Harry closed his hand over Malfoy’s wrist. His mouth was dry. This was so much worse than he’d imagined.
Blaise scrunched his nose up. “No, like, not us like, you and me. Us, like, gay people. Queers. Bisexuals. Pansexuals. LGBTQIA people.”
Narcissa cleared her throat. She’d broken him of using filler language by age five. “Look,” she said, turning to Sirius and Hermione, “Can you just—” she waved a hand, “as a Muggle from television would say, Give us some space.”
“You’re not with the Weasley girl?” Malfoy’s eyes were on his nails again and he sounded suspiciously casual, given his recent apoplectic outburst.
The Dutch baby swayed as Sirius levitated it towards the table. Remus made a noise in the back of his throat, then summoned a trivet and slid it under the cast iron skillet.
The WAWFAN meeting with Draco was a success. He’d sidled in five minutes early, poured himself a cup of tea, and settled into an armchair at the back. He didn’t push in or make himself known, but when Justin crowed, “And we have a new face, so let’s all welcome Professor Malfoy,” he did a little wave. And then he was mobbed after the meeting. Harry could barely see his blonde hair popping out from the crowd of students surrounding his chair.
“Well, Hermione and I have been doing some research because Astoria, that’s the younger Greengrass girl who was the er, other party, in said blood marriage contract, she doesn’t exactly want to get married to Draco because she’s a lesbian who wants to get married to er, someone named Susan, so, that’s great, but also not great, because of the whole—”
“And then I hired you as my research assistant,” Neville said, “because you weren’t entirely shit at digging.”
This party was a total wash. Daphne hadn’t invited anyone from Gringotts, Astoria had just stuck to the gays, so it was like Hogwarts 2.0 except for Percy’s boyfriend who obviously didn’t want to suck her face because he was busy debating VAT with the American. Henry. Horace?
Scrambling to her feet for the second time in less than five minutes, Narcissa sighed. “Yes, darling, I can see that.”
Harry took a deep breath. “I don’t know if the two of you know who you’re dealing with. This is Malfoy. Malfoy!”
Fleur sighed and pressed a kiss into baby Gabrielle’s soft hair. She still smelled like baby. Fleur’s heart choked. Soon she’d be like Victoire, running around and bashing her toes and talking, but right now, just for a few more months, Gabrielle would still smell like baby.
Harry flicked his eyes back to Malfoy, who, still holding one hand to his face, was staring at him with wide grey eyes.
After the meeting, Harry caught up with Draco in the hall. “Ta for the name-dropping, even if you couldn’t resist dragging me a little.”
Neville blushed to the roots of his hair. It was less blond now, but that happened to some people. It hadn’t happened to her.
“Sirius won’t let him be an asshat,” Bill said. “Plus he should know not to fuck with werewolves. We could get him.”
She was concentrating so hard on not allowing her leg to spread out to touch Parvati’s that she had no idea what they were discussing. Something something MACUSA, something auror, investigation, BAME mandate, non-magical blah, blah, blah.
“Cool,” Ron said. His brain was feeling kind of scrambled. Hermione came up behind him and scratched his neck. That didn’t help the brain scrambling.
And soon, all of his pain, from last night and  that he’s tolerated all his life, all melt away through the pleasure Harry brings him.
“You taste so good,” Harry mumbles against Draco, lips pressed right over Draco’s rim. “You feel so good against my mouth. You’re so good for me, Draco.”
Fighting was the very last thing Draco thought they would be doing the night before their wedding. Alas, here they are. Or here Draco is, rather, laying in bed
Draco expects Harry to retort, to be angry that Draco doesn’t seem to take him seriously. But Harry only laughs, the sound melodic along with the faint rustle of the tree branches dancing along with the summer wind.
Harry lays him down on the duvet, rough hands slipping under his shirt and caressing the soft skin of his torso. Harry’s left hand slides up, and settles right over Draco’s chest, where his heart is.
When I was born, I was the first in many generations of Malfoys to have fingerprints with more than one delta shape. I have three perfect arched triangles on each of my wand fingers and one thumb. They said it was a sign I’d be very powerful. It’s more likely a fluke in our mess of inheritance, as I’m no more powerful than the average wizard, much as my mother would like to pretend otherwise. I don’t mind it, though, as magic is not all that matters in this world, and my research has power unlike anything a wand can produce.
He lifts his face from the crook of his arm to watch Harry coat his fingers with oil. Once Harry grasps Draco’s cheeks again, he returns to burying his face into the sheets.
We’ll reach the beginning and the end of the labyrinth. Then I’ll ask him, face to face, hand in hand, as wizards do.
And then, Harry rolls his hips as he’s pressed flush against Draco, and Draco lets out a sound he would’ve been embarrassed about if he wasn’t so lost in a sea of heavenly pleasure.
The summer night in Barcelona radiates everything warm and beautiful. The world is under the canopy of a diamond sky; the stars scatter like freckles amongst the glow of the fireflies outside.
“Sometimes,” Draco admits. He wouldn’t call himself an extremely honest person, but with Harry, he is. Even just a little bit. “Are you?”
He turns on the faucet and cups both of his hands under it, collecting a decent amount of cold water to splash on his face. He looks at himself in the mirror and is met by a haunting sight.
“I love your scars,” Harry says, and a pang of uneasiness suddenly blooms within Draco. “I know you hate them, and I will never forgive myself for—“
Draco’s breathy laugh turns into a breathless moan when Harry turns him over on his stomach, kissing down his back and grasping his hips.
“Yes, but I wanted to get you lilies and cigarettes,” Draco replies, shyly handing the items to Harry.
He said my name, my full name and title too, without looking up. I approached the bench and watched as though disinterested, though I was anything but. That was the start to it, and more or less, the sum of it, though lately I’m allowed to watch him at work — for research purposes, I tell him, though I think he knows I love to see his mind at work — so long as I’m quiet, and I’m always quiet.
,” he says, breathless and strained all at once when Harry hits that spot inside of him that sends him into oblivion.
Privately, I wonder if he might have trouble reading. He’s a bit too proud to admit it, and I’d be a hypocrite if I faulted him for that.
If I’m ready for that — and it is an ‘if,’ as nothing is ever quite certain around him — I’ll take him to the labyrinth out by the Manor. I’ll walk with him and tell him these stories till we get to the center of the path. And when we walk back out, I’ll tell him all the things I want with him, all the futures I’m afraid to claim for myself.
Draco hasn’t even realised he’s started crying again until Harry leans his forehead against his, allowing Draco to look deeper in the infinite green of Harry’s eyes. They’re even more beautiful this close, if that’s even possible. Evergreen flecked with gold and silver, like a forest adorned with a million fireflies, like his favourite Matcha sprinkled with glimmering gold flakes.
All Draco can do is lay there, limp and so deliciously satisfied as Harry leans down and licks Draco’s come off his torso, briefly lapping at the head of Draco’s softening cock before trailing his mouth back on his lean stomach.
. He always initiates kisses with one gentle hand against my cheek, drawing me into him, asking my permission, though I always give it. I am less graceful, as I’m far more likely to grab him by the collar and kiss him senseless.
Draco casts a wandless cleaning charm before wrapping his arms around Harry, letting Harry press his ear against Draco’s chest where he can hear his heartbeat.
, like they’ve got all the time in the world. Draco shifts his hips in rhythm with Harry's fingers, a gasp leaving his mouth every time Harry touches his prostate ever so slightly.
Draco bites his bottom lip as another moan threatens to spill from his mouth when Harry fills him with his warmth.
Outside, the sky paints itself a palette of yellow and orange hues. A spark of golden light appears on the horizon as the twinkling stars fade away with the night.
Harry turns swiftly, his hair bouncing under the soft moonlight and his eyes holding the same grief as Draco’s. “Draco,” he echoes.
“I love you,” Harry reminds him, as if Draco will forget, especially with the way Harry looks at him like he hung the stars in the sky. “Let me show you how much.”
and all those rags make him out to be. I mean in the way that his eyebrows are just a little uneven, and the way that he hates any sort of facial product so his skin’s always a bit dry, and the way his teeth are a bit crooked — off-kilter, my mother would say — or the way that there’s a persistent ink smudge high on his cheekbone, like it prefers to be part of his skin, even if he hasn’t touched a quill in a week.
Before they Floo home, Narcissa stops Draco by the fireplace, kisses his cheek, and whispers, “You’ve chosen the right man, my darling Draco. I’m very happy for you.”
Harry turns to look at him, green eyes flecked with gold and brown skin decorated with freckles that look like constellations. He’s so young, innocence clinging on every fine line of his face that if Draco didn’t know him, he would assume Harry has never had a rough day in his life.
Of course, Harry takes this as an opportunity to slip his tongue between Draco’s lips. Draco moans into the kiss, more times than he can count, and Harry swallows the sounds like he’s desperate for it.
He inhales deeply. The pillow he has in his arms still smells of Harry — cigarettes and that rosewood perfume Draco gifts him every Christmas. Next to him is an empty space, where Harry should be, where Harry
For a moment, they both freeze, looking at each other as though time has paused and the world has stopped spinning.
Layers of sweat cover both of them like blankets; Draco moves against Harry’s cock, taking him deeper and deeper with each thrust.
“Thank you, Mother. I hope the Manor isn’t treating you too poorly,” Draco says, guilt blooming in his chest for leaving his mother alone in his ancestral home.
“I was young and stupid and I wish I had loved you back then,” Harry kisses the scar right below Draco’s jaw, and Draco melts into him right away. “But I love you now, every piece of you,
“I love your shoulders,” Harry says, almost too quietly that Draco strains to hear him even with the silence of the night. “How they’ve carried so much weight in the past…” he continues tracing every mark on Draco’s skin with his lips as though he’s building constellations out of everything Draco is.
His wandless magic is like no other. I’ve been training with a wand since I could hold it, honing my fine motor skills around the hilt, perfecting each flick of the wrist and spellwork’s motion. My wand is like an extension of my fingertips, but Harry, he moves like the magic is his breath. His pure, unbridled power pools into the palm of his hand like an afterthought. It’s like the way that smoke curls out of the corner of his lips when I catch him sneaking a cig in the garden; it’s that gentle twist of grey slipping from his lips like he can’t hold it all inside. I’ve never witnessed magic like it, and it’s only more powerful with his wand in hand.
Draco hums his favourite lullaby mindlessly as Harry peppers kisses along the back of his neck, mouthing at the freckles on his skin.
My real secret is hidden in the palm of his hands. See, the greatest joy of the flung-out way he sleeps is that I can curl up beside him and look at them. I’ll never tell him, but his hands are my favorite part of him. I’ve always thought that hands are supposed to say everything you need to know about a person, but I didn’t believe it till the first morning I spent staring at Harry’s.
Draco is running late for dinner on their five-month anniversary, so he thinks he might as well fetch a bouquet of orange lilies and a pack of cigarettes on his way home.
Gloom hugs Draco’s skin like an old friend, always bringing unwanted company whenever he loses sight of himself.
As expected, Harry is the first one to apologise, “I’m sorry,” he says, his voice rough and ragged as though he’s just smoked a pack of cigarettes within half an hour. He probably did — that’s what he does when he’s stressed — and doesn’t Draco
Draco, feeling a little more brave this time, repeats, “I love you, Harry,” before crossing the space between them and kissing Harry, mouthing his love into his mouth because his words simply aren’t enough.
When he’s sleeping like this and I'm running my fingers over the surface of his palm, lighter than a feather, I can’t help but imagine his touch on my cheeks, on my skin. In sleep, Harry is perfectly dormant, but awake, he is the opposite, alive, vibrant, moving and touching and
There are many things Draco would like to change after the war, but this moment is the only thing he wants to keep untouched.
“I’m sorry too,” Draco says, crossing the space between them and settling on the side of the bed opposite of Harry’s. He leans his weight on his left arm, causing Harry to look down at his left hand, where the black diamond of his engagement ring catches light from the lamp on their bedside.
Harry’s hands have all his stories, like a textbook of all the lives he’s lived. Some days, I wonder if I’ll get to see them grow wrinkled and gnarled. I wonder if his fingers will keep their careful grace, that perfect fineness that helps him cast delicate magic and tinker with his charms. Maybe his fingers will lose their straightness, the way my mother’s hands did, till they are bent with age and the weight of so many more stories yet to come. I hope I get to see it all.
“Dear gods,” he whispers exasperatedly to himself. “Get your shit together, Draco, you’ve got a wedding in a couple hours.”
Draco comes untouched with a shout of Harry’s name. He’s had plenty of orgasms before, most of them caused by Harry, but nothing will ever compare to
Harry steals the complaint right off his mouth by the roll of his hips, over and over again until the pleasure and Harry’s body pressed against Draco all become
Draco nearly sobs, both from the pleasure from Harry’s tongue and the meaning behind his words. If Draco can’t be good for the rest of the world, maybe he can be good for Harry.
The sunrise unfolds before him — a series of pastel-coloured swirls in the sky. He thinks of the next sunrise he gets to watch with Harry, and the sunset too. And the next ones after those…
And so Draco does the only thing he can think of doing, because, again, Harry was always better with words than him.
I have a secret. See, Harry’s a heavy sleeper. Sometimes, after a few wakeful nights (he gets nightmares, we all do, the War Generation), he’ll take a Dreamless and be out until the next noon. He sleeps on his back, arms and legs spread wide, as if he can’t help but take up the entire bed, and once he’s asleep, not even the house falling down around him would wake him back up. I don’t blame him, really, I envy the easy calm that settles over him when night falls. It’s like all sense of tension has drained away.
,” Harry says in echo of Draco’s habit. “You should’ve Apparated, you know,” he gestures exasperatedly to Draco’s soaked clothes.
The kiss deepens, like how Harry grasped the back of Draco’s neck and pulled him into a rough, drunken kiss on their third date at nineteen, like how Harry’s nipping at Draco’s bottom lip now, making Draco gasp in his mouth.
“So beautiful,” Harry says as though to himself, caressing the dip of Draco’s back like it’s the most precious thing he’s ever held. He leans down and kisses the dimples right above Draco’s arse, fitting his lips perfectly in the hollow of Draco’s spine.
Harry sits on their bed, his back towards Draco and facing the window with the view of the trees and fireflies outside.
Harry continues eating Draco out like it’s the last thing he’d do, never once failing to mumble how much he loves Draco as he does.
Addie clattered down the stairs, one arm around Padma’s waist. They were both flushed and giggling, and Padma gave Addie a kiss on the cheek as they separated.
“Long story short, Rakepick trained me, Bill Weasley, and Merula Snyde, you know, Perry’s mum? She’s an Unspeakable now?” Harry blinked. Perry was the child of all-around badass Merula Snyde? The witch who’d taken down a record number of Death Eaters? Perry was so … floaty. Harry had known they had the same last name, but he’d never really connected the dots.
With his eyes shut, Draco looked younger and more vulnerable, like one of those paintings of dead saints. He was almost peaceful. If only until his mouth opened again.
“He does seem to be reformed,” Hermione interjected. “He came around to ours last weekend? Two weekends ago? Anyway, he’s perfectly lovely, and he apologized to me—”
“George gave me the afternoon off. He’s hired like five Hogwarts kids this summer as interns so I never have anything to do.” Ron shrugged. “At least I feel like I’m doing something useful when I’m here. Otherwise I’d just go home and fuck around.”
“Ron didn’t want to leave the roast unattended,” she said, with a quick glance in the rearview mirror at Malfoy. “You know how he gets about basting.”
He was left tapping his fingers along the table as the rest of the faculty and staff filed into the headmaster’s office and gathered their tea things. The room was filled with a gentle hum of chat.
Hagrid patted Harry on the shoulder and almost sent him into the table. “Don’t worry, ‘Arry, he’s changed.”
But Snape, and Dumbledore, and now, Malfoy, now that he knew, they were all grey. Malfoy certainly darker than Dumbledore, but—Harry couldn’t stop a hiccup.
Then she bobbed her head a little bit, seemed to forget she was holding a teacup and attempted to clap, spilled tea all over herself, and started laughing. Minerva sent a drying charm her way as she sat.
Harry tried not to make an awkward face. Good, his teenage love life was now a topic of discussion. Great. This was fine.
He opened his eyes and looked down at the pale fingers rubbing the flannel of his sleeve. Malfoy blushed and drew his hand back. They both looked away.
“Technically it’s Ms. Black,” Narcissa said, hating herself before the words were out of her mouth. But any small error might compromise Draco’s life—if what Sirius had written had any ounce of truth in it, that is.
At least he used a refillable fountain pen instead of a quill. He had enchanted it to look like a white peacock feather. He was still a Malfoy. Though maybe it was the Black penchant for theatrics. God, Sirius would have laughed.
what did that even mean?! He sounded like a right berk. Malfoy seemed a bit confused as well, and maybe he had a cold, because he kept clearing his throat and he seemed a bit red.
Sirius raised an eyebrow at Remus. Fine, he owed him an ice cream, because Harry did bring up Christmas.
. It was also miles from the serious Malfoy who’d faced him and spilled out his past. How many versions of Malfoy were there? Was there one that was Draco?
Harry shrugged. Yeah, maybe he should have. But it was going to happen now; he could feel it in his stomach. It was the right thing to do. People weren’t supposed to be lonely on Christmas. Plus they couldn’t get Teddy the same things. That would be stupid and a waste of money and Teddy would be annoyed. (Teddy would not have been annoyed. He was a thoroughly unflappable child who didn’t care much about material objects beyond one ragged stuffed wolf he called ‘Lupy,’ and a framed portrait of his parents from the day he was born. But if Harry needed to think that, well, fine.)
“Oh, darling,” Fleur said, her maternal heart swelling as she wrapped an arm around them and drew them into her side. “They’re not like, picking him over you. They probably just thought Andromeda and this … Malfoy would be bored to tears and it would be sad and lonely. But you’ve got all the Weasleys and everyone! And isn’t it fun to be surrounded by forty-five of your nearest and dearest?”
Malfoy gave him an odd look, but complied, sending a patronus galloping across the room. Harry couldn’t see what it was, other than a large quadruped—Abraxan? Thestral? Unicorn? All three seemed fitting in different ways.
Pansy opened her mouth, closed it, and then opened it again. “I don’t believe in love,” she said finally, “Maybe I haven’t met the right person, or maybe my brain and heart just don’t get it. C’est la vie.”
Flapping her hands, she continued, “We were all supposed to be mini cursebreakers. But when we entered the vault with the dragon in it—” Draco gasped—“it turns out she’d abandoned my brother inside a cursed oil painting! And then she left us to deal with this dragon, completely alone! Disappeared! Like that!” She snapped her fingers.
“Go on, girl, go to Hermione and Ron’s.” Ulula blinked, pushed her head under his hand, and left after she’d been given a few scratches.
Andromeda Tonks’ address: The Howes, Otterburn, Newcastle upon Tyne. Andromeda Tonks and the client will be the only persons in residence. Premises secured by Aurors throughout April with wards holding until 2026 or when deemed appropriate to be removed; impenetrable to magical means of transportation specifically carried out by the client independently; owls unable to reach the client at this address unless addressed care of Andromeda Tonks; accessible via Floo Network for those on an approved list (currently: OP, Andromeda Tonks, myself, Neville Longbottom, Remus Lupin; in an emergency, any auror or sociatrix may use Probationary Protocol 45a to gain immediate access to the residence).
“No!" Harry roared back. "My mum's white family raised me and the last thing they wanted to talk about was the fact that I was brown!"
Harry leaned closer. His stomach turned. Before he could stop himself, he was running his fingers across where the snake coiled out of the skull’s eyes—the gentle bumps of the bleeding ink were almost unnoticeable beside the jagged white lines of scar tissue.
“There is the possibility that he might become ill, if he also attempts to pursue someone who is not Astoria,” Hermione said, looking uncomfortable. Sirius made a noise of disgust. “I can’t lie to her!”
Blaise yawned and wriggled his head into Neville’s chest. “It was actually nice. I got a lovely shirt and Draco has a proper non-magical outfit now, so he’ll pass his unit or whatever with flying colors. He insisted on green, but I let it slide. Can’t change all his spots in one day. But, he’s getting, hm, I don’t know. Softer.”
“You don’t want to go back to Pret,” Harry said. “We don’t have time, anyway. We’ve got to go get the … things.”
Padma punched him in the arm and laughed. “Good job, Potter. Between the sherwani and the dancing, you’re doing a good job of giving Malfoy an absolute coronary. I’ve never seen him this red and twitchy.”
“Oh, no, not like that!” Draco yelped. “No! It’s about narratives of immigration and emigration. Not about like, the Potter family.”
“Tomorrow you might need the coffee,” the older man said conspiratorially. “I can never sleep before the first day of classes.”
He felt it shining out of her, coating her house in the strongest magic known to mankind, turning a cottage into a fortress. How had he and Draco ever assumed they’d go unrecognized?
He hummed a bit and said, “Right, we’re going to have to be invited in. This is really advanced spellwork.”
“I never really understood why my brothers and sister were so obsessed with other people, when there are dragons in the world.” He paused here and stared at Norberta, the current matriarch of one of the subpacks. “School proms were … fun, I guess, because dancing is fun, but putting your tongue in someone else’s mouth seemed kinda weird. But when I had to Polyjuice into someone else during the war—” Weasley won’t reveal whom—“I realized that other people had all these sexual urges and desires like thrumming through their bodies. Which was like, cool to experience for a couple of hours but,” he laughed, and concluded, “How could you ever get anything done?”
Lavender turned it over in her fingers. “Yeah,” she said to Astoria. “That’s why it didn’t fucking work.”
Looking up, Harry and Draco saw Audrey and Talbott Oliver-Winger, seated next to each other on the sofa, wands out. The golden lamplight did nothing to soften their expressions.
Harry wasn’t about to let that go without a long comment about sherwani and how it was an important part of his heritage, and launched into said long-winded, somewhat heated comment when Malfoy stumbled back against the wall. Harry reached out and grabbed his shoulder, “Hey, hey, what’s up?”
Draco shot Harry a quick smile. “I have, of course, improved greatly on my fellow professor’s organization—” ah, there it was—“but I appreciate the blueprint he has laid down for curricular reform.”
He was looking good. He’d always been a cute boy, but over the years, he’d grown into himself. Physically, sure, but it was the confidence that had filled him out over the years. That and the improvement to his posture. He moved with a kind of studied grace.
Parvati was biting her bottom lip. “New beginnings.” That didn’t sound like a platitude. It was far too serious.
November first marked the start of the Quidditch season. The first match was Hufflepuff versus Slytherin. Addie and Patrick traded barbed remarks as they passed the HP sauce back and forth. No one else touched the stuff. Hufflepuff had easily won all the pre-season friendlies despite the extremely safe style of play Patrick coached them into. ("As a Healer," he told Harry one day, "I am allowed to have Views.")
“Oh, shit, right,” Harry said. He’d completely blanked about warming charms. He cast a quick one over the two of them.
“You are a catch, my darling,” she said approvingly. Blaise must know a good man when he met one. That was worth something.
“Even more. They came to fight too.” Padma’s voice cracked. “Mum said blood purity was ridiculous. ‘Trust me,’ she said, ‘this is nonsense.’”
Neville couldn’t tell if he was joking or if they ate rats in Azkaban. Draco was still so opaque, except in moments of high emotion. He just said the weirdest shit in the most casual tone and then became really intense and earnest about things like biscuits and certain plants and that one chicken they’d seen that had a fringe that covered its eyes.
Clinging to his broom, half on and half off, he darted forwards with his hand out, but as his fingers closed around the snitch, Malfoy’s hand closed around his.
And then Malfoy continued in a more demanding tone, “Potter, you’ve got to give me their Muggle address so I can write them a proper thank you note. Ron was saying he loves getting mail in that little box near the end of the lane.”
“Your parents are on their way from Hong Kong,” Bertram said. Astoria swallowed. “They, er, are taking this more seriously now.”
Malfoy lurked in the shadows of the large doors behind the first years. He turned to Padma for confirmation of this nefarious behavior but whipped his head back so quickly he missed her small smirk. Harry squinted and once again wished he could magically improve his vision. All he could tell from here was that Malfoy was all in black. Just like Snape. Suspicious already. He was much taller than the first years, but that didn’t mean much. They were eleven.
Irritation pricked Harry. “And it must have been really important to take precedence over supporting your students.”
He glanced over at Talbott Oliver-Winger, a man whose hair and skin were the same tawny light brown. He had high, sharp cheekbones and was wearing a full suit and bowtie. He smiled at his wife, then cast his glance around the room. When it landed on Harry and Draco, the smile vanished.
Bill shrugged. “You could always get some data about whether he’s likely to fuck with Remus. Or if I need to come, you know. Menace or something. Bare my canines.”
Harry found himself in a corner with a potted plant, looming over a little brown-haired girl on a divan. She looked up at him and said seriously, “It’s my birthday.”
Harry felt his world getting very small, closing in to just Malfoy’s tilted head and his slightly parted lips and—
“Vibed?!” Hermione interrupted. “He was using you as a child soldier to bring down an evil wizard. He was grooming you to die.”
“Right,” Harry said again, ignoring the burst of warmth along his left side. “Books first. You’ve got thirty minutes at Waterstones. That’s it.”
“I thought this was my room!” Malfoy yelped. “The window’s all fogged and I thought I left my light on and—shouldn’t you be at breakfast?”
Harry rolled his eyes and kept marking. You’d think seventh years would know your and you’re, but apparently not. He circled another grammatical error and put the end of his red pen back in his mouth.
“Sorry, pardon?” Fleur snapped back to the present, where her sister-in-law was asking if she wanted sparkling or still water.
267/250 (I think. Probably more. The lack of tracking is definitely my fault; Draco definitely exceeded 250 hours.)
“Why didn’t you tell me this before?” Harry hissed back, his sweaty hand sliding around on the stem of his wine glass.
Draco hummed and stood. He didn’t seem to want to continue the conversation, because he brushed some imaginary dirt of his dark green robes and said with finality, “I’ll come up with two people for the panel, and you provide the other two.”
“Nothing,” Malfoy said airily and while staring at the ceiling. “I was just exiting my room when Potter crashed into me. It’s nothing. A coincidence. Sheer chance. Combined with Potter’s inability to look where he’s going. Blind as a bat that one, completely and utterly—” he broke off and looked a bit abashed.
“Otto,” Hermione said. Narcissa’s heart stopped. It was a mistake, in the twilight, not every bearded man with a harsh gaze—but when he took her by the elbow, the flush that spread through her body proved it. “Can we just have another twenty-four hours so she can know what—er, happens with the contract?”
“Yep, definitely got a wand in there,” Lavender said, saluting Parvati’s ass with her glass. That sounded really normal. Harry elbowed her in the side before Parvati turned back around.
“Sirius modified it to combust and release once the level of sexual tension was ratched up to a nine,” Andy said nonchalantly.
Remus said Harry used to do the same thing. “It’s the abuse,” he’d said with a tight grin. “They don’t know what to expect, ever. There’s all this … re-learning to feel. Like, physically feel things.” He’d dropped some books at the cottage.
He’d transformed his robes into a long black wool coat. Under that, he had on a tight black polo neck tucked into black jeans. With black suspenders. And then he was wearing Doc Martens.
“Yeah, it’s been like, oh, goodness, five years?” Andromeda bit her thumb. “Six? Shit, I should know stuff like this. Ted used to have this calendar of everyone’s birthdays but I think I lost it or maybe Tonks took it to Hogwarts, I just don’t know, and then I never got another one, so I’m just all at sea now, but—”
Oh, so there was another person involved here. The name sounded familiar, right on the tip of her tongue, but then it escaped again.
And he decided, well, fuck it, and broke into an awkward rendition of the dance from Unk’s music video, which he’d shown in class a few weeks ago. Britney and Justin knew the backup dancers’ moves and rocked out besides him, drawing more and more of the student body into a dance circle. The fifth-year wizarding-born kids were trying to remember the moves they’d studied, and Harry did take a quick look around to see who’d been paying attention—Perry and Elspeth—though neither of them had any sense of rhythm and Perry gave up and began jumping up and down while shouting the lyrics—but Shuo had picked up the moves immediately and was twerking like there was no tomorrow.
Harry wanted Draco so badly. It was like a huge, flaming hippogriff of desire that threatened to overwhelm him, and he didn’t know if Draco wanted him back. It was like some switch had flipped and all the things he’d been noticing and not noticing about Draco suddenly signified that he, Harry James Potter, was irredeemably attracted to Draco Malfoy.
Harry shrugged and reached for another prawn. “Britney and Justin wanted me to, and we watched the music video in class. I had to get it on a DVD, believe it or not. God, I wish I could get the internet to work here, that would be so much easier, like, the things I had to do to that DVD player to get it to work ...”
Astoria started giggling. Draco was so fucking dumb sometimes. That was unfair. He was still mostly a wizard or whatever the right term for like, old school but
The rest of the party passed with a few more beers, a few more pieces of pizza, and a few more desires to touch Draco’s hair. The latter were not indulged.
“Ms. Black,” Narcissa said. “I would expect an auror to know that Azkaban dissolves marriage bonds.”
Perry stared at him and blinked. It seemed as though he were seeing Harry for the first time. Harry fought an urge to snap in his face.
“A partner would be jolly,” Harry said and sighed. “But everyone just wants the Boy Who Lived or whatever.”
“When I was at Hogwarts, we had a wonderful DADA professor. Patricia Rakepick. God, she was lovely. She had hair just like your Ron,” she said with a nod at Harry. She stared off into space for a few seconds until Talbott prompted her gently with “Your brother.”
Harry was a bit peeved. First Padma, now Hermione. How good was this bloody foreword? Words didn’t mean anything. They could get twisted around and were so often hollow. It was all about what people did. Not what people wrote. Brushing his teeth fiercely, he seethed at the mirror. Sure, Malfoy wasn’t a bad person anymore. Ok, we were there. That thought was fine. But he was still an annoying and poncy git who—well, maybe that was harsh—he was at least a highly grating person with an overly fastidious mind and a penchant for dog-earing Harry’s novels. He wasn’t evil. Nowadays, he wasn’t even bad. He was just irritating.
“So—” Harry gathered their hair into a bun. Which meant that they were thinking. Which usually, in Remus’ experience, was going to mean something that at the very least, would be complicated, and at the most, would be dangerous. Often for completely righteous causes, Remus would be the first to admit, but sometimes he wished Harry would just rest on their laurels.
“Working too hard, again?” Remus asked after Sirius had done his full bounding tackle and hair-ruffle and kiss routine.
Even wrapping his fingers around Malfoy’s wrist—the right one, with the tattoos that Harry hadn’t seen—he was burning. With curiosity. To see Malfoy’s mystery ink. Not to feel Malfoy’s smooth skin and gentle cashmere under his palm.
Harry took advantage of his silence to look around Malfoy’s quarters. The entire room was covered with a plush emerald rug, but it was barely visible between piles of paper and books and clothes. There were two armchairs by the fireplace (how come he got two?).
And a woman who’d spent twenty-odd years living in the country, so of course she knew that Malfoy’s woolen robes weren’t going to work for tramping around the wilds of Northumberland, but Neville guessed that there had been some, uh, disagreement.
Malfoy was breathing heavily (not that fit, Harry thought childishly and inaccurately), and he tensed his abs while craning his neck up to look at Harry.
“Oh, the one at the Ministry with Jason?” Hermione grinned. “I love Jason. We were interns at the same time.”
His wooden chair let out a whoosh of pink smoke and transformed back into a shoe, dumping Harry on the ground. He collapsed backwards and lay for a long time staring at the dark, broad beams of the ceiling.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Just pick something out, alright? Whatever you want.” They had to buy something. And he wasn’t about to demonstrate his proclivities in front of a colleague.
“Still blessed with keen observational skills, I see.” Malfoy folded his napkin and placed it under his saucer. He smoothed his hair and stood. His black robes stretched across his now broad shoulders and fell without wrinkles in a long swoosh of dark fabric.
“Potter, you know nothing.” Ginny rolled her eyes. “You think Edna would give gold to a subpar cake?”
They weren’t supposed to do this for two weeks. This had absolutely ruined his lesson planning. He’d have to move forward the staging, which meant costumes, which meant his weekend would be spent magicking up panniers and hose. Malfoy was going to pay for this.
“At least I’m still not sparring with my teenage nemesis,” Padma snarked. The coziness of the last half-hour must have been grating on her. And she noticed too damn much. She reached back and massaged her head while fixing him with a piercing gaze.
Harry wasn’t really sure where he was supposed to hold on—shoulders was going to bring the cloak up too high, and Draco’s elbows would pull it back from the front, so he just waited, hovering his hands about until Draco whispered, “Waist, you idiot,” and then Harry thought,
“I admire your work on elf legislation,” she said. Harry blinked. What the fuck was happening? Draco was determinedly staring at the mantle.
ended the stream). Harry was a bit abashed and brought him two lemon biscuits at the next faculty meeting.

Harry stared at Draco. How could this man have written a book about muggle history and not know what a sticky note was?
“My parents gave mine to me when I turned fifteen, but organizers are on the list of banned items because Filch had this absurd idea that you could use them to cheat in exams, which, of course, you can’t. Unless you’d modified the magic somehow.”
Jason tilted his head. Ron traced the movement with his eyes, wishing it was with his hands or his mouth, and fuck, this was wild.
“Coffee at dinner, Potter,” she said with a finger waggle and set off towards her office, spinning garlands of bats and cobwebs along the hallway as she went. “Don’t forget your costume!”
Ron and Hermione were exchanging some coded looks but Harry decided to ignore that and ask for more tart. He deserved it.
—but it was a bit late for that. Anyway, they’d recommended a shop. Harry hustled Draco into a taxi and then hustled him out again at the corner before the shop. No need for the cabbie to know too much of their business. Draco had been far too nosy about how the man knew all about how to use the “taxicab,”
“Anyway,” Hermione continued, “it’s all just a matter of figuring out what you can and are willing to compromise about. When we do have children, Ron has some, uh,” she coughed a little, “particular ideas about under which star signs children should be conceived.”
A week later, a tawny owl tapped its beak on Blaise’s window. Recognizing Neville’s crabbed handwriting, his heart sped up—one day it would be pure excitement, untinged with dread. One day.
“It was like she was shining from within, glowing with this kind of righteous rage, and then she came and wrapped her sweater around me, and it was like this mantle of calm descended over us.” Luna paused and rested her head on one hand. “Of course, she was still infatuated with Harry.”
You heard it here first—Conciliatio is coming to Diagon Alley in June 2006! Potter says the location will allow them to offer more services for the organization, which fights for an end to discrimination based on gender, sexual identity, heritage, species, and/or disability in the magical world.
Harry could feel the house settling and falling silent. There was only Draco’s breathing. And Harry’s own heartbeat, which seemed to have migrated into his head.
“As you know, the professorship for History of Magic has not yet been announced. Since Cuthbert had been with us for over forty years before we convinced him to retire this past May, we have had some trouble finding a good match for the school.”
“It’s medical,” Draco blurted, his eyes fixed on Harry. “She gets sick. There’s a blood marriage contract.”
Jason smirked and suppressed what was clearly the urge to roll his eyes, then said, “I’m sure you remember the ever-detailed-oriented Draco.” He sank into the empty chair next to Ron and stared at him. “This cake is amazing.”
Consider mental health evaluation. Revisit educational opportunities or vocational training possibilities (internships?) in a few weeks. Need to follow up with the people running those courses.
Without waiting for Malfoy, Harry kicked off. The first swoop was fantastic. It was futile to seek the snitch in the thick grey fog. Harry tried out some upside-down moves. God, he hadn’t flown since the summer, and his muscles ached already. They’d been flying for maybe two minutes.
“Ah, censoring yourself now. Sensible,” Draco said with a quirked eyebrow. “Griffin’s probably going to eat out on that for weeks.”
“What I didn’t understand as a teenager,” she says, “is that there was and is a difference between pure, mutually consenting desire, and manipulating someone into a false or chemically-induced desire. The latter is sexual assault, whether or not it leads to physical sexual contact.”
“Addie, come now, surely you can do better,” she said and struck a casting pose. “On the count of three—”
He continued bumping his way towards the high table, nodding and exchanging comments with students on the way. No one guessed correctly.
“What?” Harry hissed again. “Why didn’t you bring this up before? This might have been,” he exhaled through his nose, “helpful and relevant information.”
Because he had his students now, and they were as old as he and Malfoy had been, and he couldn’t imagine running into a bathroom and finding Justin or Britney sobbing their lungs out about having to kill Minerva but they just couldn’t bring themselves to do it and then having one of their peers absolutely shred them to pieces and leave them there—and fine. He was crying. That was fine. He’d just have to be silent.
“Counting the days since you saw me last, Malfoy?” Harry took the stairs two at a time. He vaguely wondered what Malfoy had been doing for those eight years. He hadn’t shown up for eighth year. None of the Slytherins had. Hermione felt particularly put out by that—“it’s not a very good reintegration into society, if they don’t feel safe enough to return to Hogwarts”—but Harry couldn’t find himself to care. Much. He kept imagining he saw Malfoy turning around corners. But here he was, in the flesh, no longer an apparition.
Draco snorted at this reference to a plant that burst into seven-foot-tall electric blue flames when its berries were at peak ripeness, so Neville pushed his luck a little. “It’s the mouth. If you closed it when you stared at gay people, the whole staring thing might be less noticeable.”
“I thought you were too much,” Harry managed. This conversation had veered off somewhere strange and he wasn’t really sure what these euphemisms were meant to euphemize. Was Malfoy coming onto him? “That’s what you said at the match.” Bolster that with some facts. Concrete facts.
Malfoy stood half-collapsed against the door with his blonde hair hanging down in front of his face for a few seconds, then, with a sudden flash of movement that had Neville gripping his wand, he tossed his hair back and straightened up.
“Yeah, I’m sure those pureblooded witches really dig this whole—” Harry managed to make a kind of frantic hand gesture—“whatever it is.” Malfoy’s ring wasn’t on the right finger for a wedding ring, it looked more like a signet, but surely, he had to be engaged to some fellow blood purist.
Harry gulped the water, stared at the card again, turned from the bar, then swiveled back, grabbed the coconut, shoved it in their pocket, grinned at Val, and disappeared into the crowd.
No. Well, maybe. Draco is still suffering mentally, though he would never admit this. I’ve worked with enough students to understand when someone might have been traumatized, and I think the Sociatrix Department should encourage Draco to seek mental health help. I’m not sure he would know what mental health is, so this topic might need to be handled gently.

“They’re on the third-year exams,” Hagrid said, stabbing one large finger into the table. “We’ve got to have ‘em.”
Anyway, this means that we are at a stalemate of stolen possessions where each owes the other nothing, unless, of course, you prefer the coconut, in which case I suppose I could return it to you.
Harry sighed. “Lemon creme. Or lemon-ginger. And he only takes one. Whatever, you’re right, blah blah blah.” Resuming his seam-unraveling, he grumbled, “It’s only because he could be dangerous. Like, he could be poisoning the milk or something. He still lurks about. Lurkingly.”
“Probably,” Draco said with a short laugh. “He was fucking stupid. And I never understood what happened to his nose.”
“It does, sir! How can you even like someone until you know them, like, really know them, and that doesn’t really have anything to do with what bits they have or whatever!” Perry seemed a bit outraged.
They wiped sweat off their brow with one long arm. Florian attempted to make his legs work normally.
Harry opened his mouth to argue but when he saw the set of Malfoy’s mouth, he collapsed back into the wet grass.
Florian Fortescue tapped the glass door and waited. He’d seen a few shapes moving around behind the brown papered windows, and if he knew anything about Harry Potter, they’d be in there, sweating away in the late summer heatwave without even thinking about taking a break.
Astoria shook her head, and then said brightly, “It’s been so nice having the iPod, Harry. We’ve spent a lot of time listening to it. It was really thoughtful of you to bring to Draco, and I’ve sort of shoved in and monopolized it. But your playlists are so good.”
“Ass like you, Malfoy,” he gasped. He’d be damned if he didn’t finish his insult thanks to an ill-timed flashback. Piña coladas, Potter, imagine the maraschino on the end of the paper umbrella. And the tiny slice of pineapple. Maybe he could kill Malfoy and flee. Just him and a beach and tiny cocktail umbrellas.
“Tell me what Blaise told you,” Harry said, leaning over Malfoy. He could be intimidating when he wanted to be.
“Jesus, Malfoy, what are you doing?” Harry scrambled to find a jumper and closed the window with a spell across the room.
Lavender dragged a chair over to Astoria’s side of the bed. Wrapping her arms around her, Lavender mumbled, “This better fucking work.”
“Huh,” Ginny said aloud and took the letter down the hall to the bathroom, where, sure enough, Luna had turned one of her eyebrows a shimmering green.
were murdering people, Florian had confessed to Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to actually kill someone.
Draco took a breath, sighed, and said, “Yes, fine, I’ll have the imps work up some magical photostats.”
Teddy was hovering on his broom in the middle of the ballroom, watching the two patronuses dance around each other.
“The paterfamilias has always been talented,” Kreacher intoned, “and I am sworn to carry out his wishes.”
“Hm,” Draco said and moved towards the door, “I’ll just take your hat.” He plucked it out of Harry’s hands before he could protest. “You have a hood.”
It wasn’t as though Malfoy was chummy. They did spend a few hours a week discussing upcoming lesson plans. Malfoy didn’t know much about the O.W.L. or N.E.W.T. reform, so Harry filled him in on the new standardized levels and the focus on experiential learning. Malfoy would roll his eyes and go off into some lecture (honestly) about how lecturing was a time-tested method that helped younger students form a narrative from a series of disconnected historical facts and how this was a much more age-appropriate introduction to historical research and methodology than digging through the archives, which they could get into if they decided to pursue a post-N.E.W.T. year or go on to graduate work in the field. Harry would groan and insist that lectures were tedious and multiple studies had shown that students actually remembered their hands-on lessons. That wasn’t friendliness. That was just two colleagues debating teaching methodologies. Once a week. For at least four hours. Usually over a scotch or two.
Trust you to become emotionally attached to a hairy fruit. I will bring it to your birthday party. I question your choice of Wetherspoons as a delightful birthday location (I have been learning things, you lout), but I shouldn’t quibble with the birthday human.
Harry wandered through the halls back to his room with his mind tangled with the problem of the sex ed panel. How had he gotten himself into this? Right, Britney. And Elspeth. The two of them were a disaster waiting to happen. But he already knew they’d both pass the O.W.L. with flying colors. He hoped they’d keep on for the N.E.W.T. level. And then Justin …
The client appeared alert and engaged throughout the meeting, a noticeable difference from a year ago. Dressed tidily in black robes.
“Ron,” Hermione said, approaching the table with a handsome man with dark curly hair and a very fucking cool short-sleeve button down shirt with frogs. “This is Jason, who was an intern with me at the Ministry, and now he does the non-magical education programs.”
At faculty meetings, Malfoy would linger near the tea cart and fuss with his cup (even though he took his tea black) or delay choosing his biscuit (even though he always settled on a lemon cream or lemon-ginger biscuit) until Harry had taken a seat, and then choose the one farthest  from Harry. That was fine. If Malfoy regretted sharing his murderous and bigoted past—even if it was fueled by a misguided desire to win his asshole father’s love—and chose to freeze Harry out, that was fine. Addie Murton and Bastian Khan seemed to have taken some kind of intrahouse-fueled sympathy on Malfoy and formed a buffer between Malfoy and Harry, always patting Malfoy’s arm or whispering asides during meetings. At the meetings, Malfoy rarely spoke, just spent them scratching away in a huge bound volume (suspicious).
“I’m not stupid, Potter. I’m an historian of early modern and modern European magical and Muggle history. I published an article on Galileo’s trial last year in
entrenched in the idea that magic users just need to learn how to “pass” long enough in the non-magical world if they get “stuck” until they can escape back into the magical world. Hence Dawlish’s pressure on me to include “beauty” as a key component of non-magical identity education; I’ve tried to massage the lesson, but ugh. It subtly reinforces the division between the worlds, because the magical world is just as influenced by the same Eurocentric beauty standards, but I’m not supposed to get into
He’d promised Padma. Chance number three, here we go. Be the bigger man. No, don’t think about that. Nope. Eyes forward, Potter.
Harry’s world was shifting quite a bit to the left. He shook his head. No, Malfoy was still there, examining one (perfectly manicured) hand and seemingly waiting politely for him to respond. Well, he definitely might have to hold off on murdering Malfoy, because it wouldn’t look good to his larger project of promoting tolerance to murder a fellow queer wizard, even if he was a fascist. (Or maybe a former fascist. But that remained to be seen.)
Thanks for letting me know about Draco’s confusion. Module 3 is titled “Identity and Biology,” and covers the wide variety of non-magical races (and how human race is a construct with very real and horrible historical and contemporary effects), body types and shapes, disabilities, illnesses and diseases (with a
“Your cake is fantastic,” Jason said, glancing down at his plate. “I did have to bump a pensioner out of the way to get the last piece, so I feel a little guilty about that, but—”
He’d missed Blaise and Hermione’s answers, but Luna was talking about how she’d realized when Ginny had defended her against some bullies at Hogwarts.
“If you’d told fifteen year-old me that my true love was one of the Weasley twins, I’d have slapped you.” Angelina shook her head, then her gaze softened as Fred entered the room. “They were terrors. Spotty, weedy, ginger terrors.”
Britney shook her head and smiled fondly at her. “It’s a metaphor; we reviewed this, and the most common euphemisms, like lollipops are—” The introductory beat of ‘1, 2 Step’ saved Harry from hearing the rest of that sentence as she screamed with joy and dragged Elspeth to the dancefloor. Elspeth was trying to copy Britney’s moves. Trying so hard. It was precious. Britney put her hands on Elspeth’s hips to try to establish a rhythm, but the minute she took them away, Elspeth was back to irregular jolting. Harry felt a surge of protectiveness.
But after that tense conversation, which ended with Kreacher tsk-ing his way back to his cottage, Sirius had said they shouldn’t say anything to Harry, not first. Harry had to bring it up. Which was a logical, reasonable plan, Remus figured. Or at least not illogical. But now, staring down at his unfinished crossword, he wondered if they’d fucked up.
Harry groaned. “Look, first, he’s one of Teddy’s only living relations, and it’s really hard to grow up without anyone related to you, even if you’re kind of adopted by one of the best families in the world,” Molly looked mollified, “and two, I’ve been working with him for like six months and he hasn’t done one shit thing. Not one. Like, he’s still kind of an arse, but just in a normal, prickly, posh way. Not in like, an evil, fascist way.”
“He’s at The Howes?!” Harry’s chair thumped to the floor. “Is that why you said we couldn’t go this summer?”
“Yeah, but he has me and Pansy and he doesn’t want anything else right now, so, like, whatever.” He popped the crust into his mouth, and then said, half around it, “I couldn’t handle that at all.”
“She’s my coworker! And my parents think Parvati and Lavender are roommates.” She ran her nail along a seam in her robes. “I don’t think I could do that, like, keep a big secret like that.”
“Oh, yeah,” Bill said, and Fleur could tell that he was fighting to keep the amusement from his voice. “Fucking devious, that.”
She turned to Hermione, who had one edge of her lip drawn between her teeth. Suddenly, Narcissa leaned forward and grabbed the other woman’s forearms. “You have to be sure they both have someone else in mind. It can’t be an abstract idea, of finding someone else you love, or the magic twists that fantasy into the person in front of you.”
“We can hardly fire him before he’s started, Potter,” she finished tartly, folding her napkin and laying it on the table. “Try giving him a second chance. If only to keep the peace at faculty meetings.”
Pomona Sprout cracked her knuckles and surveyed the greenhouse. It had been a relentless summer, fighting the overgrown plants back into some kind of submission so Neville wouldn’t be eaten alive—at one point, she might have said not literally, but after Hardcastle’s accident in Greenhouse Six—she shrugged, even though she was only thinking to herself, and grinned.
Here, Potter’s self-deprecating laugh doesn’t erase the thousands of Galleons from their personal fortune or hours of labor they’ve poured into promoting equality since coming out as nonbinary and queer in 1998.
Harry’s eyes snapped open. “How could you forget the dazzling lap dance I gave you when you tried to shoot down my DJ proposal? That was at a faculty meeting.”
Harry grabbed his elbow and steered him into the shop. A bell went off. Draco turned to him with wide eyes. “They know we’re here,” he whispered. “How is that not magic?”
Andre moved with a fluid grace that even his limp didn’t undermine. Harry knew he’d been the Keeper at Puddlemere United and then Pride of Portree until the crash.
Harry blew out of his nostrils. “One, that was S.P.E.W., two, it’s now an international organization that coordinates elf demands and strikes, and three, the name of my club is perfectly fine, and most of the kids just say ‘waw-fan,’ so, it’s fine. It doesn’t need to be marketable. It’s a Hogwarts club.”
And when Harry’s fingers intertwine with Draco’s, he shifts his hips, and sheathes himself into Draco.
And so he kisses Harry for as long as he can, until he runs out of air to breathe and all he ever knows of is the taste of
“We don’t have to get married if you don’t want to,” Harry says, his voice strained like he’s in pain from saying it aloud. “I can wait, Draco. No matter how long it takes.”
Heat flushes within Draco’s cheeks when he realises Harry’s watching his own come drip out of Draco’s hole.
Draco remains standing in the bathroom's doorway, afraid that if he opens his mouth, he’ll end up driving Harry away from him again.
A storm of grief and worry brews at the pit of Draco’s stomach. He knows Harry can very well protect himself, but he didn’t even bring his wand when he walked out in the middle of their argument.
Dinner remains forgotten for another hour and two as Draco and Harry get lost in paradise, tangled in the sheets as they make love for the very first time under a weeping sky.
Harry has always told him he can tell how Draco feels by his eyes, and so Draco flutters them closed. Vulnerability will always be something Draco has to keep working on. Harry helps a lot with it, always telling him it’s okay to hurt and to laugh and to live, but that doesn’t mean it takes all the weight off Draco’s shoulders.
Warm fingers caress his cheekbone, causing Draco to open his eyes, only to be met by the sight of Harry’s beautiful face half-dipped in the shadows, like an unreachable moon waning through an endless sky.
Harry kisses up Draco’s body, lips tracing every line of scar until he reaches Draco’s mouth. He kisses Draco slowly, and Draco cannot refrain from moaning when he tastes himself on Harry’s tongue.
“Well, I suppose you’re lucky I love you.” The words slip from Draco’s mouth like a secret he’s been keeping all along.
Having Harry’s lips on his for the very first time is worth every tear he has shed loving him from a distance.
“Is this okay?” Harry asks softly. Draco nods, and it takes the blink of an eye for him to realise Harry is kissing him. His lips are rough and bitten, and he tastes of honey and milk and
“What?” Draco asks. He heard Harry perfectly well the first time, but his confession still feels like something out of Draco’s wildest dreams.
Harry’s expression softens even more, a flash of admiration washing over his face and his eyes turning a brighter shade of green. “You didn’t have to.”
Narcissa divorced Lucius shortly after the war, leaving the Manor under Draco’s name after Lucius migrated to Greece. There he remarried and had a daughter named Lyra. Months after Lyra’s birth, Draco moved in with Harry, leaving the Manor to Narcissa.
I think Harry would have tried to join the Aurors anyway, but hated it, and I don’t think that only because I’m a great snob about the force. But he hates paperwork, hates it more than Voldemort — or so he says, some days, but that might just be an excuse to get me to do it for him. He wouldn’t last in the Ministry’s bureaucracy, all that red tape, form such-and-such. He’d hate every second he wasn’t making the world a bit brighter.
. The delicate movements of Harry’s body pressed against his own, Harry’s hands holding Draco’s, and Harry’s mouth,
With a heavy weight in his chest, Draco detangles himself from the blankets. He stands on his wobbly knees, uneasy legs walking him towards the bathroom.
He arrives roughly an hour late. The kiss Harry greets him with at the doorstep makes running through the wailing storm worth it.
“Are you still sad?” Harry asks out of nowhere, still looking at the calm waves under what’s left of the daylight.
I arrived promptly at his shop. I am always on time, especially for a date.  The nerves, as they so often do, had twisted up my stomach and seized the inside of my throat, but there I stood, just under the bell.
It’s all choices, every minute of every day. I choose to lie here, staring at the single scarred knuckle on Harry’s right hand, and the little white mark by his wrist from an ages-ago flyaway spark. I choose to let him touch me, to allow those hands to press deep affection into my skin. He treats me like his charmwork, like I’m tangible and beautiful, like he can see magic in me. The intensity he carries in his gaze scares me; it turns any gentle touch of his fingertips over my knuckles into an unspoken kiss.
Draco laughs, “Fuck off,” he says, his words a failed attempt at expressing annoyance. “Now I feel like I have to invest in anti-aging creams.”
Before Draco can collect his thoughts for a reply, Harry leans in, breath smelling faintly of cigarettes.
It’s minutes or hours later, Draco can’t tell, when Harry’s finally in all the way. His hips dig deliciously into Draco’s flesh with every little thrust, with Harry aiming to find the right angle. When he does, they both moan in unison. Harry shifts the slightest bit and punches another moan right out of Draco when his cock sinks deeper into him.
natters on about his beautiful eyes, and complains at least weekly how “terribly sad” it is about his bad shoulder. They forget that his hands still work perfectly, even if he isn’t suited for Auror work.
Draco kisses Harry, softly, like how he would’ve kissed him back when they were fourteen at the Yule Ball, like how Harry kissed him under their last sunset at Hogwarts at eighteen.
With a soft sigh, Draco presses his lips on the raised scar on Harry’s forehead before whispering, “I love the worst of you too.”
My favorite sort of kisses are the ones I press into his palm, against the back of his hand, or on his shoulder. I think he knows that I’m saying far more in those touches than I will ever announce out loud. I think he’s alright with it. He’s become accustomed to my many oddities.
two hours ago, right before an argument brewed from the depths of Draco’s insecurities and Harry’s obstinacy.
“No, it’s not that,” Draco replies, taking Harry’s hand in his and gripping it as though Harry will disappear if he doesn’t hold on to him tightly enough. “I just — I don’t know if… I’m good enough for
Draco shifts in an attempt to snake his arm down his torso so he can grasp his cock, but Harry stops him by holding both of his hands against the sheets.
The curses that leave Draco’s mouth would send him to hell if he believed in such a thing. Harry continues to lap his tongue against Draco’s hole as though Draco’s the sweetest thing he’s ever tasted.
“Draco,” Harry says once again, like Draco’s name is a promise at the tip of his tongue, like it’s the greatest promise he’s ever going to make in his life.
“I have never blamed you for them, Harry,” Draco says with a serious voice, staring up blankly at the ceiling. “We were sixteen.”
Lying here beside him, on our great big bed with the morning sun trickling in, it’s so quiet I can hear his heartbeat. It is as steady as he always is. I touch the thin line at the base of his exposed palm, my fingers so subtle it won’t wake him. He has ley lines across his palm, a little map of his life and magic.
They rarely fight these days, having burnt most of their anger and wrath during and after the war, when they were nothing to each other but people who had a rough history behind them.
Harry’s movements stutter, but he never stops rocking his hips and saying Draco’s name like it’s a prayer.
“That’s fifteen years from now,” Draco says fondly, thinking of the many years he’ll get to spend with Harry. “Such a long time…” he mumbles mindlessly.
They sit beside each other by the black lake, watching the sun dip on the horizon for the very last time as students.
